<HD>Studios' Web 'Plants' Lead to an Ethical Thicket</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ever since Harry Knowles burst to prominence with Aintitcoolnews.com,
the Internet has blossomed with hundreds of movie geek Web sites,
each one crammed with its own oddball assortment of news, reviews and
message boards devoted to "Star Wars," Quentin Tarantino and other
pressing matters. For movie fans, the sites represent authentic
participatory democracy--everyone's opinion or obsession carries
equal weight.</LD>
<LD>   But earlier this year, Chris Parry, a 32-year-old writer and
ex-production manager who runs the site efilmcritic.com, began
noticing a lot of very inauthentic postings. They read like outright
publicity plugs, or what Net denizens call "plants," most of them
touting films released by Universal Pictures.</LD>
<LD>   On May 30, filmfreak234 wrote: "Lemme just say that I really can't
wait to see undercover brother ... am I alone here? For one it looks
hella funny, and two its got denise richards. You just can't get
better than that combo!!!! Apparently harry knowles thinks so too.
You know, from aintitcool.com. He said it was the bomb. If you wanna
see what he wrote check out www.aintitcool.com and look for it on
your own ... I'm definitely stoked for this one."</LD>
<TE>   On July 9, fangoria17 wrote, enthusing about "The Silence of the
Lambs": "I can't wait until the prequel Red Dragon comes out this
fall. I watched the trailer for it at http://www.apple.com/trailers
and it got me really excited. Check it out and tell me what you
think."</TE>
<TE>   When Parry got a series of messages plugging "Blue Crush," another
Universal summer release, he became suspicious, because all the
messages, as he put it, "were obviously scripted and always had a
link to the trailer for the film." When he checked the IP, or
Internet Protocol, address of the messages, he discovered that they
originated from the same place, Universal Pictures' registered
corporate site, MCA.com.</TE>
<TE>   Parry's movie site wasn't the only one being "seeded" with fake
fan messages. Brian Renner, a 17-year-old high school student who
runs the site themovieinsider.com from his home in the Detroit
suburbs, received identical postings for the films "Undercover
Brother" and "Red Dragon." When he ran a check on their IP addresses,
they were the same as for the messages at Parry's site: Universal
Pictures.</TE>
<TE>   Renner also got several suspicious postings promoting Paramount
Pictures films, including "The Sum of All Fears" and "K-19: The
Widowmaker." On Aug. 13, he received a series of messages from
aptreke and aresolic, both hyping the "Star Trek 2: The Wrath of
Khan" DVD and a promotion that offered a free subscription to a
"Trek"-themed dial-up modem. To Renner, the postings sounded like ad
copy, not genuine fan messages. In one message, aptreke wrote: "Now I
have a 30-day free subscription to a Trek-themed dial-up. There's all
this content on my homepage now that is really unique.... Did anyone
else get this too and try it?"</TE>
<TE>   Renner discovered that the messages came from the same IP address,
one registered to Paramount Pictures. Both Parry and Renner say they
tried contacting the studios and e-mailed queries to the people
sending the suspicious postings, but never received a response. They
suspect other studios of planting messages as well, but most postings
were disguised by the use of a separate Internet service provider.</TE>
<TE>   "This is dirty tricks, not legitimate marketing," says Parry, who
adds that his site gets anywhere from 50,000 to 150,000 hits a week,
depending on the time of year. "It's also a slap in the face because
the studios are using our site to hype movies without paying for
advertising. After all, what's the difference between paying people
to pretend to be film fans Web sites across the country and paying
them to pretend to be happy customers in a testimonial TV
commercial?"</TE>
<TE>   These questions bring up issues about studio marketing ethics and
how they apply to the Wild West environment of the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't the first time movie studios have been caught using
questionable marketing practices. Last year, Newsweek revealed that
Sony Pictures had invented a fake film critic named Dave Manning,
whom the studio quoted in ads offering favorable blurbs. Shortly
afterward, Sony admitted that two employees had posed as moviegoers
in man-on-the-street testimonial TV ads to promote an earlier
release.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, rival studio marketers loudly decried Sony's
activities, saying they never used staffers or actors in TV
testimonial ads (though questions about their veracity in other movie
ads led the studios to stop using that type of advertising). But
different rules seem to apply for the Internet. In recent years, the
Web has been inundated by viral marketing, in which a variety of
companies have used teenage "street teams" or their own employees to
tout CDs, sci-fi DVDs, skateboards, sneakers, video games and teen
apparel.</TE>
<TE>   Universal Vice Chairman Marc Shmuger says his studio has regularly
used street teams to go online and talk up Universal films. He
insists they are not employees, but unpaid volunteers recruited by
the Universal Music and Video Distribution Group.</TE>
<TE>   "It's aggressive marketing, but it is not deceptive marketing," he
says. "This is a technique used everywhere in corporate America--it's
no different from the girls who go into bars to tout cell phones and
vodka. However inept these postings were, they were unpaid volunteers
expressing their unscripted enthusiasm. They were not posing as fans;
they were fans. We never knew the Web sites attempted to contact
them. If anyone asked who they were, there's no question that they
should have identified themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Paramount publicity chief Nancy Kirkpatrick said her studio had no
knowledge of any employees planting plugs for its films. "People who
go online say they're working for Paramount or an agency hired by
Paramount. We don't do anything without full disclosure."</TE>
<TE>   Other studios, which were not involved in these incidents, say
their staffers or hired teams don't hide their identities. "I won't
pretend that we've never put any seeding information into a Web site,
but we never do it covertly," says New Line interactive marketing
chief Gordon Paddison, who engineered the studio's groundbreaking Web
campaigns for the "Lord of the Rings" film series. "No one here is
allowed to pose as a fan. When I'm online, if someone asks who I am,
I say, 'I'm Gordon from New Line.' "</TE>
<TE>   Steve Peters, who runs argn.com, a site devoted to alternative
reality gaming, says his message boards are frequently invaded by
street team fans touting products. His site now has a discussion area
devoted whether viral marketing is a "valid approach" or merely
"insulting" lies.</TE>
<TE>   "To see someone posting as someone they're not really ticks people
off," Peters says. "I mean, if someone did that on TV, they'd get in
trouble, wouldn't they?"</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the producers of the new TV show "Push, Nevada" were
recently busted for hiring actors to pose as members of a supposedly
real-life Push, Nev., high school hockey team on a segment of "Good
Morning America." Because "Good Morning America" is on ABC, the same
network airing "Push, Nevada," ABC was pilloried by skeptical TV
columnists who found it hard to believe that the network or "Good
Morning America" wasn't in on the stunt.</TE>
<TE>   It seems that entertainment conglomerates practice a double
standard when it comes to the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   They have repeatedly blasted the Web as a haven for lawless
pirates who engage in unauthorized file-sharing of music and movies.
In a recent speech, News Corp. President Peter Chernin called the
Internet "a moral-free zone" whose future is threatened by rampant
piracy.</TE>
<TE>   Yet these same media giants have no qualms about using deceptive
marketing to publicize their products. It is widely believed, for
example, that studio staffers regularly go on Harry Knowles' site to
plant positive reviews of their films--or negative reviews of their
competitors' movies.</TE>
<TE>   These plantings have become commonplace ever since the runaway
success of "The Blair Witch Project," which was based in part on a
clever Internet viral marketing campaign.</TE>
<TE>   But subsequent attempts to create Web buzz have been less
fruitful, largely because the planted street-team messages are so
clumsily executed. "You can spot these guys right away, because no
real people write the way they do," Parry says. "No real person ever
says, 'Hey, check out the trailer here,' with a link to it."</TE>
<TE>   The people who run movie Web sites worry that these planted
messages are alienating rank and file fans, pointing to
aintitcoolnews.com, which now seems to carry more weight with
industry insiders than true fans. "I wish these studios realized how
unprofessional it is to plant things," Renner says. "If you read
these dumb messages, you'd think, 'Who was ever going to believe
'K-19' was a good movie anyway?' "</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The World Festival of Sacred Music wound up a colorful, 16-day array
of presentations Sunday night with a program celebrating the deep
belief in community that has underscored the event from the
beginning.</LD>
<LD>   Conceived in 1999 as a one-time series of concerts tied to the
millennium, it now will return as an established, triennial offering.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday's Greek Theatre production, like so many other concerts
large and small in the festival's run, emphasized the spiritual
aspects of music from around the globe. Less obviously but perhaps
more importantly, it also revealed the spiritual qualities that are
intrinsic to virtually all music.</LD>
<TE>   The mythological gods and heroes in the graceful music and dance
of the Balinese ensemble Cudamani, for example, represented an
approach to spirituality different from that of Western religions.
Yet the stimulus they provided for creative artistic expression was,
at its core, no different from the intentions of, say, a Bach
cantata. And Cudamani's brilliant performers, working together with
stunning cohesion--the musicians filling the night air with the
clanging sounds of metallophones, flutes and cymbals, the elegantly
garbed dancers moving with physical clarity--were both as superbly
coordinated and as compellingly entertaining as any Western ballet
performance.</TE>
<TE>   The Lifou Island Dance Theater of New Caledonia offered another
approach to the sacred roots of music and dance. As with Cudamani,
the ensemble--which has taken on the name "Ziethel" ("looking
up")--works toward resurrecting ancient legends by fusing them with
more contemporary performance styles. The result was a powerful
combination of rhythm, melody and visceral dancing. The group's
enthusiasm, deceptively well-crafted foot-stamping choreography and
unexpected blending of unison tribal chanting with choral harmonies
justifiably generated some of the most spirited applause of the
evening.</TE>
<TE>   Other highlights in the program included the talented Circle of
Friends, a pan-Middle Eastern group including members of Axiom of
Choice.</TE>
<TE>   The most receptive response of all, however, was reserved,
predictably, for the climactic appearance by the Grateful Dead's
Mickey Hart, leading a multinational band called Bembe Orisha ("party
of the spirits" in the Yoruban language, according to the program).
This global version of a Grateful Dead drum jam featured a clutch of
gifted drummers--Hart, Greg Ellis, Sikiru Adepoju and Humberto
"Nengue" Hernandez--in a searing display of spectacular rhythmic
pyrotechnics.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, emphasizing the festival's roots in humanity's discovery
of the vast spiritual powers present in the interplay between the
voice and the drum, Bembe Orisha featured the extraordinary singing
of Cuban-born Gladys "Bobi" Cespedes and Iranian-born, Indian-raised
Azam Ali.</TE>

<AU>HOWARD ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Good news/bad news for the new ABC comedy, "Less Than Perfect."</LD>
<LD>   It benefits from having as a lead-in "Life With Bonnie," another
new series that is off to a strong start in the ratings, giving "Less
Than Perfect" a potential audience rub-off.</LD>
<LD>   On the other hand, "Less Than Perfect" suffers by comparison with
Bonnie Hunt's smarter, funnier comedy, making this pairing
potentially risky for tonight's newcomer.</LD>
<TE>   "Less Than Perfect" is a workplace comedy whose major asset, Sara
Rue, is breezily self-effacing as Claudia Casey, who somehow wins a
highly coveted job as assistant to star news anchorman Will Butler
(Eric Roberts) on the prestigious 22nd floor of a large broadcast
entity after laboring in the mailroom as a "permanent floater."</TE>
<TE>   The show's title refers to Rue's roundish shape, making her
character a natural foil for slender colleagues who were entrenched
outside Butler's office long before she arrived, and who jealously
try to sabotage her while currying favor with the anchorman
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The likable Rue has an easy way with her material, but that
material isn't much. Aside from her personal appeal and laughs
generated by Andy Dick as one of her office allies in a future
episode, this show is one thudding brick.</TE>
<TE>   Its problems relate to overwriting and over-the-top acting. The
oily, super-vain Butler is such a familiar, broad stereotype and
all-around unsavory yutz, for example, that there's no explaining why
Claudia and her nasty rivals fawn over him. Roberts should return to
playing heavies, and the show's producers to the drawing board.</TE>
<TE>   "Less Than Perfect" will be shown at 9:30 p.m. Tuesdays on ABC.
The network has rated it TV-PGD (may be unsuitable for young viewers,
with an advisory for suggestive dialogue). Howard Rosenberg can be
contacted at howard.rosenberg@ latimes.com.</TE>

<HD>'The Misfits' Finally Gets Some Respect</HD>
<DH>Television* A KCET documentary interviews key players such
as Arthur Miller about the troubled film, which proved to be ahead of
its time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Plagued by a difficult shoot, burdened by bad reviews and marked by
the death of its leading man shortly after production was completed,
"The Misfits" suffered the biggest indignity--audience
indifference--when it was released in 1961. That's what makes the
growing appreciation for the drama during the last four decades
especially surprising.</LD>
<LD>   What seems clear now is that the hauntingly poetic drama--written
by Arthur Miller and directed by John Huston--was ahead of its time.
Now the somehow appropriately titled film is the subject of a "Great
Performances" documentary that airs Wednesday on KCET.</LD>
<LD>   As the documentary points out, "The Misfits" marked the final
screen appearances of its larger-than-life stars Marilyn Monroe and
Clark Gable. The latter died of a massive heart attack less than two
weeks after production wrapped.</LD>
<TE>   "I think audiences expected Gable to be dashing and heroic," says
Gail Levin, producer of the new documentary, "The Making of the
Misfits." "He's not. He's burned out. And she wasn't what you always
expected of her. I think rather than take it on its terms, the
audience took it on the audience's terms, so they didn't allow
themselves to find it."</TE>
<TE>   Levin, who first saw "The Misfits" on television as a teenager,
says her lingering affection for the film is what motivated her to
make the documentary. "It was so eerily close to the bone for all of
them. It couldn't have been better cast. It is just an extraordinary
moment in time. Everybody was who he or she [was]. And Huston was the
perfect person to direct this thing."</TE>
<TE>   Monroe plays Roslyn, a beautiful but troubled woman who has just
gotten a divorce in Reno when she meets up with two friends, the
aggressive flier Guido (Eli Wallach) and aging cowboy Gay Langland
(Gable). Added to the mix are aging rodeo star Perce Howland
(Montgomery Clift) and the much-married Isabelle Steers (Thelma
Ritter).</TE>
<TE>   The film ends in the desert with a disturbing and allegorical
roundup of wild mustangs--much to Roslyn's hysterical dismay--by Gay
and his friends.</TE>
<TE>   But there was more drama going on behind the camera than in front
of it. Shooting locations were difficult; the Miller-Monroe marriage
was crumbling before everyone's eyes, and her chronic lateness and
difficulty remembering lines caused the film to go over schedule and
budget. The only person Monroe would take direction from was her
acting coach, Paula Strasberg. And because of a drinking problem,
Clift was considered unstable.</TE>
<TE>   Nine photographers from the renowned agency Magnum
Photos--including Inge Morath, who later married Miller--documented
"The Misfits" production. Levin features these evocative photographs,
along with clips from "The Misfits," and interviews with Miller; cast
members Wallach and Kevin McCarthy; Huston's son, Tony; and others.</TE>
<TE>   Miller was the last person she approached about doing an interview
for the documentary. She decided she wanted to talk to the people
involved with financing and producing the project before getting to
the writer.</TE>
<TE>   The two met at lunch, arranged with one caveat from Miller: He
would not talk about Monroe. "But I did want to talk to him about the
role of Roslyn, which he specifically wrote for Marilyn. So when we
came to do the interview, I said to him, 'I know you don't want to
speak about Marilyn, but will you speak about Roslyn?' And he did.
But speaking about Roslyn was also like speaking about Marilyn. It
was always a little bit veiled."</TE>
<TE>   Those interviewed for the documentary were blunt about the
insanity surrounding the production. Even 40 years later, Ed Parone,
who was assistant to producer Frank E. Taylor, is still appalled by
Monroe's tardiness and the fact that no one scolded her for holding
up production. Script supervisor Angela Allen admits that she found
Monroe's behavior "despicable." And Nan Taylor Abell, the producer's
widow, recalls a particularly nasty fight between Monroe and Miller
in their hotel room, so venomous that Abell acquired another room
down the hall for Miller so he could work on the script.</TE>
<TE>   Wallach recalls that Huston was very understanding of Monroe, whom
he had directed in one of her first films, "The Asphalt Jungle" in
1950.</TE>
<TE>   "He never upset her or accused her or took it out on her," Wallach
says. "He said, 'Of course, my dear. We'll do it again. Don't worry.'
I found he was gentle and lovely with her. She was in a terrible
state because the marriage was breaking up."</TE>
<TE>   In general, Wallach says, Huston wasn't big on giving direction to
his actors. "His attitude was if you hire great musicians and you
wield a baton, they know how to play the instrument. You are not
going to tell him how to play it. His concern was to find the moments
of truth in every scene that was played."</TE>
<TE>   But Huston did give Wallach a bit of sage advice during a scene in
which the actor and Gable were being very drunk and loud at a bar.</TE>
<TE>   "After they shot it two times and while they were lighting the
scene, he came over to me," Wallach recalls. "He said, 'Eli, do you
know the drunkest I ever was?' I said no. He said, 'Yesterday.' And
then he walked away."</TE>
<TE>   Wallach couldn't believe his ears.</TE>
<TE>   "I had seen him ride a camel in a race with a horse at the rodeo
and he said that was the drunkest he ever was in his life. We started
to shoot and I thought, he's telling me that a drunk doesn't say,
'Listen I'm drunk' and act drunk. A drunk tries to be sober."</TE>
<TE>   The actor also says he doesn't believe that it was Gable's
insistence on doing the physically demanding stunts with the mustangs
at the film's conclusion that led to his fatal heart attack.</TE>
<TE>   Wallach says the actor, who was 59, was in good shape. "You have
to have a physical before you can do a movie," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "He had had all of his physicals. He had lost a little weight to
do it, but it was hot as hell out there," Wallach adds. "He was a pro
and at 5 p.m., no matter where we were in the shooting, he would stop
and go home. His wife was pregnant and his baby was born several
months after his death."</TE>
<TE>   Along with the 1956 film, "Baby Doll," written by Tennessee
Williams, Wallach is proudest of "The Misfits."</TE>
<TE>   "I feel richer for having done those two pieces. Sure, Arnold
Schwarzenegger can blow up half the city and that movie makes a lot
of money, but that is not a success to me. What is a success is that
these people experimented and tried."</TE>
<TE>   "Great Performances: The Making of the Misfits" can be seen
Wednesday at 8 p.m. on KCET.</TE>

<HD>What a Familiar Ring</HD>
<DH>Television* Returning shows and spinoffs top the new
season's ratings. CBS and NBC have a decisive lead, while ABC and Fox
struggle to play catch-up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite the traditional focus on which new programs are captivating
audiences, the first week of the prime-time television season
primarily underscored the durability of old favorites, as the usual
suspects and their spinoffs rounded up viewers.</LD>
<LD>   Preliminary results also reinforced perceptions that this season
will likely shape up to be a two-network race, with CBS edging NBC
overall last week--NBC did lead by a wide margin among adults ages 18
to 49, the key demographic to advertisers--while ABC and Fox lagged
far behind.</LD>
<LD>   The good news for the major networks is that people generally
returned--sometimes in record numbers--for programs they liked, an
ongoing concern as alternatives from cable to the Internet vie for
leisure-time attention. In fact, the aggregate audience for CBS, NBC,
ABC and Fox was virtually identical to the corresponding week a year
ago, with CBS' gains offsetting ABC's decline.</LD>
<TE>   The flip side for the networks is that it remains difficult to
inspire viewers to sample--and, more significant, stick with--new
series. Although several newcomers have gotten off to promising
starts, a few already are exhibiting signs of fading.</TE>
<TE>   Among the tried-and-true programs delivering in particularly
stellar fashion last week were "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,"
which cracked 30 million viewers for the first time; "Friends," with
its most-watched season premiere ever; and "Frasier," posting its
highest rating in two years, thanks to the Niles-Daphne marriage.</TE>
<TE>   The top-rated new program, meanwhile, was "CSI: Miami," in essence
a brand extension of the existing show, just as NBC has rolled out
additional lines from the "Law &amp; Order" factory.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, "Law &amp; Order" spinoffs "Special Victims Unit" and
"Criminal Intent" both won their time periods, the latter providing
the centerpiece of a solid Sunday drama lineup for NBC, which posted
respectable ratings for the nostalgic "American Dreams" and Los
Angeles-based crime show "Boomtown." The former was first in its hour
with more than 13 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media
Research estimates, while "Boomtown's" premiere ran a close second to
ABC's "The Practice."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Sunday yielded a mixed bag for ABC, as the second-season
premiere of "Alias" drew an estimated 11.7 million viewers--the
show's biggest audience since its debut--while the movie "Prince
William" landed with a less-than-royal thud, attracting only 7
million.</TE>
<TE>   As always, initial sampling can be deceiving. Fox's new drama
"John Doe," for example, performed well against reruns but saw the
audience drop sharply Friday versus the premiere of CBS' "Hack,"
starring David Morse as an ex-cop-turned-vigilante.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, ABC's "8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter"
slipped to 12.8 million viewers last week--a 26% drop from its
premiere--once original competition arrived. ABC would still be
satisfied if the show settled near that level, with the question
being how well the John Ritter comedy holds up in subsequent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Although ABC has some room for optimism regarding "8 Simple Rules"
and the Damon Wayans sitcom, "My Wife and Kids," which easily
weathered Fox's move of "The Bernie Mac Show" against it, the network
already faces some serious problems. The interactive drama "Push,
Nevada" may top that list, plummeting 45% from the previous week
against CBS and NBC's Thursday heavyweights.</TE>
<TE>   ABC officials have said the program will run at least one more
time but haven't committed beyond that. The network's new
back-in-time drama "That Was Then" also looked virtually dead on
arrival Friday, drawing an estimated 4.3 million viewers to finish a
distant fifth in its hour.</TE>
<TE>   The second edition of "The Bachelor" was left at the altar too,
with a tepid 9 million viewers. A sophomore jinx--or "been there,
seen that" mentality--has plagued many unscripted shows, with
"Survivor" a notable exception.</TE>
<TE>   In what amounts to a bookkeeping trick, ABC lobbied Nielsen to
relabel the opening installment a special, "The Bachelor Revealed,"
allowing the network to delete Wednesday's rating from the program's
season average and to promote this week's episode as "the season
premiere."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond CBS and NBC, the other standout was the fledgling WB
network, whose highlights included record tune-in for the second-year
premiere of "Smallville."</TE>
<TE>   Fox will televise the major league baseball playoffs this month
and thus preempt much of its regular prime-time lineup, creating what
competing networks hope will be a window of opportunity for some of
their programs.</TE>

<HD>A Smart and Gory 'Macbeth'</HD>
<DH>This gritty production of Shakespeare's classic, from A
Noise Within, is brisk, well-acted and benefits from Robertson Dean's
complex portrayal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You could think of Shakespeare's "Macbeth" as an older cousin of
today's action film. Chock-full of evil plots, freak-show characters,
steamy love scenes and bloody battles, it grabs theatergoers by the
shirtfront and pulls them along at breakneck speed.</LD>
<LD>   This sense of breathless adventure is especially pronounced in the
production that launches A Noise Within's 2002-03 repertory season.
Edited so that it clocks in at a brisk 2 1/4 hours, this staging by
company artistic directors Geoff Elliott and Julia Rodriguez Elliott
is gritty with period atmosphere, reaching a climax so gory that it
elicits a collective "eww" from the wide-eyed audience.</LD>
<LD>   It looks a bit like "Braveheart," but, still more, it calls to
mind Roman Polanski's brilliantly bloody 1971 film version of
"Macbeth."</LD>
<TE>   Shakespeare tells a cautionary tale about humankind's capacity for
evil in his fictionalized account of an early 11th century Scottish
nobleman. A valiant general, Macbeth lives in the good graces of his
king until a lust for greater power drives him to murder his way to
the top.</TE>
<TE>   Europe was just beginning to pull itself out of the Dark Ages in
Macbeth's time. The harshness of that life is evident in the grime
that seems to cover everything on stage. A smoky haze fills the air,
and the actors' faces and hands are filmed with dirt. Even when
wearing elegant fabrics in their grand banquet halls, these people
are never entirely clean.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson Dean is a fascinatingly complex Macbeth--part strapping,
handsome action hero, part sensitive, tortured soul. Strong as he
seems, he is powerless to resist temptation, especially by Julia
Coffey's ravishing Lady Macbeth. The ecstasy of their coupling after
the king's murder is as sexy as it is horrifying.</TE>
<TE>   The witches (Jill Hill, David Fenner and Marnie Crossen) who
shadow Macbeth are dusted white, giving them a ghostly pallor that
looks especially spooky when they're peering out from a
supernaturally lighted cave or hovering over their glowing caldron.
In a fun twist, they materialize at Macbeth's banquet to conjure the
bloody vision of the murdered Banquo (Stephen Rockwell) that gives
Macbeth--along with the audience-- such a start.</TE>
<TE>   Dean's musical baritone is one of the production's chief delights,
and it's at its richest during the "Out, out, brief candle" speech.
He almost seems to be singing a mournful art song in reaction to Lady
Macbeth's death. Moments later, he's so swelled with arrogance that
he can't imagine his demise at the hands of the raging,
grief-stricken Macduff (Brian McGovern).</TE>
<TE>   The downfall has been foreshadowed in Michael C. Smith's set
design, which perches Macbeth's throne atop a pile of dying embers
that soon will turn to dust.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles has seen more innovative "Macbeths," including the one
so artfully rendered over the summer by Sacred Fools. But A Noise
Within's production is intelligently staged and beautifully
acted--and now and again, it really sets the heart pumping.</TE>
<TE>   "Macbeth," A Noise Within, 234 S. Brand Blvd., Glendale. Oct. 13,
Nov. 10 and 24, 2 and 7 p.m.; Nov. 9, 2 and 8 p.m.; Oct. 16, 17 and
Nov. 13, 14, 27, 29 and 30, 8 p.m. Ends Nov. 30. $22-$38. (818)
240-0910. Running time: 2 hours, 15 minutes.</TE>

<DH>In 'Imaginary Friends,' Nora Ephron turns the war of words
between Lillian Hellman and Mary McCarthy into a smart comedy that
revels in wit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEAN MITCHELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN DIEGO--There may be no business like show business, but neither
is there any feud like a literary feud, and Nora Ephron, in writing
her first play, has convincingly made one into the other.</LD>
<LD>   "Imaginary Friends," her dramatization of the parallel and
conflicting lives of Lillian Hellman and Mary McCarthy, is a feast of
wit and language drawn from the words of her famous protagonists but
smartly shaped into a serious comedy with music (a handful of songs
by Marvin Hamlisch and Craig Carnelia) that grows into a hair-pulling
duel even Don King could appreciate.</LD>
<LD>   In this out-of-town opening that is headed to Broadway in
December, Swoosie Kurtz plays the craggy, contentious
playwright-memoirist Hellman, and Cherry Jones is the formidable lady
who was McCarthy, the critic and novelist. The two stage veterans
prove superb, embodying this pair of philosophically opposed American
writers who barely knew each other until a simmering enmity between
them boiled over into a public grudge match late in their lives.
Their relentless parry and thrust are so brutally in sync that the
two actresses will have to share any awards that come their way, as
some surely will.</LD>
<TE>   Ephron, screenwriter of "When Harry Met Sally ...," seizes upon
the inciting incident of McCarthy's denouncing Hellman as a liar on
"The Dick Cavett Show" in 1980 and works backward, filling in their
biographies from a vantage point beyond the grave. As their
individual life stories unfold on a stage often bare except for the
backdrop of an enormous red curtain (suggesting that they didn't make
it to heaven), the two wrestle with each another at every step down
memory lane.</TE>
<TE>   Recalling a more decorous time, Jones, as McCarthy, speaks with a
lyrical precision that is a model of elocution, mincing Hellman with
each carefully chosen syllable. But Kurtz, as the prepossessing
author of the Broadway hits "The Children's Hour" and "Watch on the
Rhine," gamely counterpunches with a cigarette-flavored growl that is
wounding in its own way. They seem evenly matched--and would a
dramatist have it any other way?</TE>
<TE>   This battle of wits never took place, but it might have, Ephron
suggests, much as Steve Martin imagined the meeting of Pablo Picasso
and Albert Einstein in his "Picasso at the Lapin Agile."</TE>
<TE>   Whether anyone remembers their work or that Hellman was a
Stalinist and McCarthy a Trotskyite ("I was the palest of pinkos") in
the 1930s hardly matters after a while because Ephron and director
Jack O'Brien ("Hairspray," "The Full Monty") have made their
intellectual catfight funny way beyond politics and the Partisan
Review. The women's ferocious but neatly calibrated put-downs of each
other become linguistic blood sport. And wholly entertaining it is.</TE>
<TE>   Repeatedly, McCarthy accuses Hellman of writing fiction and
calling it fact, while Hellman accuses McCarthy of writing fact and
calling it fiction. Therein lies the play's unsolved mystery, brought
to life memorably in a song-and-dance number with nimble ensemble
members Peter Marx and Dirk Lumbard, in straw hats, canes and tap
shoes, squaring off as Fact and Fiction.</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy hits Hellman with the charge that she fabricated the
incident in her memoir "Pentimento" that became the movie "Julia,"
arranging for herself the glorious role of saving Austrian Jews from
the Nazis. Hellman reminds McCarthy that her thinly disguised novel
about her Vassar classmates, "The Group," was "reviewed viciously by
some of your best friends."</TE>
<TE>   And so it goes, one delicious barb after another, funnier no doubt
in Ephron's imaginary dialogue than it would have been to either
woman in the flesh.</TE>
<TE>   "Was there a time when we might have been friends?" Hellman asks,
and that tantalizing possibility hovers over the evening as the clash
of preening egos masks similarities they seem to have overlooked
(although in death it might be a little late to find them). Their
multiple husbands and lovers become the subject of more argument, and
the accusation is made by each that the other married for career
advancement more than love. Whether Hellman did or did not sleep with
writer Philip Rahv becomes a recurring gag, used in the lyric, "I ran
the gamut from Rahv to Hammett."</TE>
<TE>   Another stage-seasoned actor, Harry Groener, provides a comic star
turn as all the men in their lives, including critic Edmund Wilson
(married to McCarthy) and writer Dashiell Hammett (Hellman's lover)
and most amusingly as pretentious Rahv and absent-minded poet Stephen
Spender.</TE>
<TE>   The workmanlike tunes by Hamlisch and Carnelia mainly provide an
excuse for light comic relief and mindless dancing--an occasional
break from the battering of wits. But the lyrics are suitably wry in
their own right, with the exception of an all-too-earnest number,
"Smart Women," sung ably by Rosena M. Hill, that appears to be an
attempt to remember the challenges that these writers faced in
pre-feminist America.</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien seems to have made every effort to offset the static
debate between two brainy women that is the heart of the show,
injecting sight gags, physical humor and the multimedia diversion of
a 20-foot-high TV screen carrying the image of McCarthy on "The Dick
Cavett Show" (intercut with the real Cavett) and later Hellman's
being interviewed as well.</TE>
<TE>   The wonderful Anne Pitoniak arrives before the curtain as a star
witness for the defense in the $2.5-million libel lawsuit that
Hellman brought against McCarthy but that never made it to trial
because Hellman died. Imagining that the woman who was evidently the
real Julia might have come to settle all these scores if Hellman had
lived is Ephron's inspiration for a climactic ending, and it doesn't
disappoint.</TE>
<TE>   What would Hellman and McCarthy make of Ephron's adoring fiction
that fixes them as antagonists joined forever in time? As shrewd
careerists, they no doubt would appreciate that these many decades of
literary and political fashion later, they are likely to be the talk
of New York all over again. Surely, neither would find anything false
about that.</TE>

<LD>   Young Musicians Alum</LD>
<LD>   Wins Conductors' Prize</LD>
<TE>   Bundit Ungrangsee, 31-year-old conductor and alumnus of the Young
Musicians Foundation in Los Angeles, took one of the two top honors
in the first Maazel/Vilar Conductors' Competition in New York's
Carnegie Hall on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors chose Ungrangsee and Xian Zhang, 28, of China, as the
competition's laureates from more than 360 conductors. Ungrangsee and
Zhang each receive a period of mentorship with New York Philharmonic
Music Director Lorin Maazel, several professional engagements to be
arranged by the competition and a cash stipend of $45,000.</TE>
<TE>   The competition, open to conductors under age 35, drew applicants
from more than 40 countries. Eight semifinalists were invited to New
York to perform for jurors last week.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Bangkok, Ungrangsee began as a classical guitarist and
earned a master's degree in music at the University of Michigan. He
launched his U.S. conducting career in 1996 as music director and
conductor of the Young Musicians Foundation Debut Orchestra in Los
Angeles. He served three years, until May 1999. Since September 2000,
he has served as associate conductor of the Charleston Symphony
Orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   The Maazel/Vilar finalists included Joana Carneiro, 26, of
Portugal, who in July began her own three-year term as music director
of the YMF Debut Orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rijksmuseum to Open Satellite Space at Airport</TE>
<TE>   Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum will open a satellite exhibition space at
the city's Schiphol Airport in November. Designed by Benthem Crouwel,
the space will cover about 1,700 square feet and will offer free
admission.</TE>
<TE>   Its permanent collection will include 10 Dutch Old Masters, among
them works by Rembrandt, Jan Steen and Pieter de Hooch. In addition,
several temporary exhibitions yearly will draw on collections of the
Rijksmuseum and other Dutch museums.</TE>
<TE>   Although many other airports, including San Francisco
International, have long included exhibition spaces in passenger
terminals, Rijksmuseum officials told the Art Newspaper that this is
the first time a museum has used an airport terminal as a permanent
exhibition space.</TE>

<TE>   POP/ROCK</TE>
<TE>   Elvis Album, Beatles Song Top British Charts</TE>
<TE>   If you think it will be strange having an Elvis Presley album
topping the U.S. sales chart when figures are announced Wednesday,
imagine what it's like in England, where they not only have Presley's
"Elvis: 30 #1 Hits" at No. 1 on the album charts, but also a Beatles
song on top of the singles chart.</TE>
<TE>   It's not the Beatles' original 1970 version of "The Long and
Winding Road" at No. 1 in Britain this week, but a new rendition by
Will Young and Gareth Gates, who gained fame in England through "Pop
Idol," the TV show that led to the "American Idol" program in this
country.</TE>

<TE>   El Rey Acts Are</TE>
<TE>   Seeking New Venues</TE>
<TE>   More venue changes for shows booked at the El Rey Theatre, which
has been closed for two weeks because of damage to the L.A.
building's ceiling: Midtown will play at the Palace tonight; Clinic's
Thursday show has been canceled and its Friday date has moved to the
Palace; Les Claypool has been rescheduled from Oct. 12 to Oct. 15 at
the Palace; Brad on Oct. 13 and Sparta on Oct. 14 both move to the
Roxy; and Patty Griffin on Oct. 14 has been relocated to the John
Anson Ford Amphitheatre.</TE>

<TE>   Ticketmaster gift certificates purchased in California may be

<TE>   Under terms of a settlement announced by that government agency,
Ticketmaster will pay more than $427,000 in civil penalties for
having violated state law since 1997 by continuing to put expiration
dates on gift certificates. The company will no longer do so and will
ignore any such date on certificates already issued, the district
attorney's office said.</TE>

<HD>Raising Their Voices for a Moral Imperative</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Opening his second season at the helm of the Los Angeles Master
Chorale, Grant Gershon showed that challenging music doesn't
necessarily mean music that's difficult to listen to. It can be music
that states a moral imperative or exhorts us to do something.</LD>
<LD>   In this case, two of the four works Sunday at the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion went beyond the front of the stage to engage and confront
the audience: Sharon Farber's "Haem Hashlishit" (Mother's Lament) and
Benjamin Britten's "Cantata Misericordium" (Cantata of Mercy).</LD>
<LD>   Farber's work, receiving its world premiere, was written in
response to the abduction and murder of Wall Street Journal reporter
Daniel Pearl early this year. Britten wrote his Cantata to honor the
100th anniversary of the Red Cross, founded to serve victims of war.</LD>
<TE>   The Farber piece was a late addition to the opening program of the
chorale's 39th season. Gershon received the unsolicited score in the
summer and was so taken by it that he added it to the agenda. The
chorale was able to get a translation of the Nathan Alterman poem on
which it's based into the program booklet, but unfortunately, without
a transliteration of the Hebrew, it was hard to follow the text.
Gershon introduced the work from the stage, as he did all the works.</TE>
<TE>   The a cappella setting of Alterman's poem, about nine minutes
long, is direct, chant-like, flowing and text sensitive. Mothers'
voices lamenting their sons' deaths (chorale members Deborah Mayhan,
soprano, and Tracy Van Fleet, mezzo-soprano) emerge from the group
and are reabsorbed by it, not so much in consolation--there isn't
any, there can't be any--as in witnessing and sharing.</TE>
<TE>   Britten's Cantata, an almost operatic setting in Latin of the
parable of the Good Samaritan, Jesus' answer to a lawyer's question
about who is our neighbor, expands the issue of responsibility. In a
masterly performance, the chorale was vehement in denouncing the
priest and the Levite who pass by the injured traveler and eloquent
in the final line addressed to the audience: "Vade et tu fac
similiter" (go and do likewise). The guest soloists, tenor Bruce
Sledge (the Samaritan) and baritone Robin Buck (the Traveler) were
somewhat pallid.</TE>
<TE>   Surrounding these two pieces were Verdi's Te Deum and Schubert's
Mass in A flat. Verdi's mighty work benefited from the 115 voices of
the chorale and a large chorale orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   But Schubert's Mass was overwhelmed. In fact, one audience member
remarked that there were more people on stage than Schubert ever met
in his life.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers signal Gershon's grand approach to the work. This was
large-scale, dramatic, at times fortissimo Schubert at the expense of
intimate, sweet and personal Schubert. But the master of poignant,
memorable melody did emerge, arrestingly in the line "Pleni sunt
coeli" in the Sanctus. An energized soprano, Elissa Johnston, and a
rather withheld mezzo-soprano, Leberta Clark, joined Sledge and Buck
as guest soloists in the quartet.</TE>
<TE>   In Verdi's Te Deum, which opened the concert, the chorale offered
mystery, sweep and glory, and proved that the master's powers at 82
were still in blazing force. Johnston was the lovely offstage
soloist.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Glendale Symphony Orchestra, a longtime community fixture facing
tight finances, will offer no concert season in 2002-03.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, executive director Pam Ellis said, the organization will
focus on presenting education programs and recruiting donors and
board members.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the only fiscally sound decision to make. You have to have
the money in the bank, and you have to have the ability to pay your
bills," Ellis said. "You can't expect professional musicians to do
this for nothing."</LD>
<TE>   Ellis was hired Aug. 19 following a grant of $65,000 from the
Ralph M. Parsons Foundation, and her top priority has been trying to
put the 78-year-old organization on a stable financial footing. She
is the orchestra's first full-time staffer in several years. The
orchestra's music director, Sidney Weiss, and the musicians are hired
performance by performance.</TE>
<TE>   Last season's Glendale Symphony season included three performances
at the Alex Theatre, the most recent an Aug. 17 "America the
Beautiful" program. Ellis said the orchestra's next performance may
come in the spring, but in the meantime, the organization will
continue its "ensembles in the schools" program with the Glendale
Unified School District and will stage its third tuba Christmas
event, which brings 250 tuba players together for holiday tunes.</TE>
<TE>   Over its history, the Glendale orchestra evolved from an outdoor
"community sing" ensemble to an accomplished indoor band, playing
with such noted conductors as Miklos Rozsa, Elmer Bernstein, Nelson
Riddle and Henry Mancini.</TE>

<HD>A New Face, but the Usual 'Shoot'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT SANDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It happens to nearly every show that's been on the air for a
substantial amount of time: that nagging feeling that there's
something, someone, more exciting out there. Call it the Seven-Season
Itch.</LD>
<LD>   So, with a new time slot and a new regular character, "Just Shoot
Me" begins its seventh season tonight at 8:30 on NBC with hopes that
viewers will remain passionate about watching. The strategy might as
well be summarized in a cover line for Blush, the fictitious fashion
magazine that is the series' setting: "How to Keep Your Relationship
Hot, Hot, Hot."</LD>
<LD>   Chances are, if such an article was to be written, the advice
would be stuff we've heard 100 times before, just as the introduction
of new characters to spice up TV series is stuff we've seen 100 times
before. (Perhaps the epitome of this was the addition of Robbie Rist
as Cousin Oliver on "The Brady Bunch," a move that lasted just six
episodes before the series ended for good.) Sometimes it succeeds,
sometimes it doesn't.</LD>
<TE>   The new face on "Just Shoot Me" belongs to Vicki Costa (Rena
Sofer, formerly of "General Hospital" and "Ed"), a hairstylist who is
your typical brash, opinionated Brooklynite. She bumps into publisher
Jack Gallo (George Segal), and Jack soon decides that she can help
him turn around the flagging fortunes of his magazine by simply
pointing out what she dislikes. (If only publishing were so easy.)</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, this causes much friction with the established
journalists who've spent so many years working, or sleeping, their
way to their current assignments. Indeed, Vicki's arrival is the
perfect excuse for Maya (Laura San Giacomo), Nina (Wendie Malick),
Elliott (Enrico Colantoni) and Finch (David Spade) to deliver a whole
new set of the nasty little barbs for which "Just Shoot Me" has
become popular.</TE>
<TE>   For those who never tire of watching such cattiness, this is good
news. But if you were hoping a fresh face would mean growth for the
series, judging from the season opener, you'd be sadly mistaken.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>On a wet Saturday night in Beverly Hills, it seemed that the crowd
inside the Gagosian Gallery was more interested in itself than in the
art: 35 pieces from the 1980s by Roy Lichtenstein. One woman walked
through the crowd leading her dog on a bright green leash. In an
upstairs hallway, another guest quizzed a friend on a new restaurant:
"Was the shish kebab good?" he asked. "Oh yes!" she answered. Yet
another guest noted the wall-sized abstract paintings: "Once you see
it, you sort of get it."</LD>
<LD>   Nearby, writer Salman Rushdie made tentative travel plans with an
acquaintance. "You really should come up," his friend said. Rushdie
agreed. To a reporter, he explained that he loved the "pure
abstraction" of the exhibit. But, alas, he couldn't afford the art,
which started at $250,000. "A few more of my books would have to
sell," he said. Robbie Robertson passed by on his way upstairs.</LD>
<TE>   A photographer's flash illuminated the arrival of Barbara Davis,
the reigning monarch of Los Angeles society. She lit up when she saw
Cassandra Lozano, a member of the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation. "You
gave us a piece of art!" Davis gushed, referring to a work that will
be auctioned off at Davis' mammoth charity gala: the Carousel Ball,
set for Oct. 15, which benefits the Barbara Davis Center for
Childhood Diabetes. Davis turned to admire one painting, which, like
the others in the gallery, featured a series of mathematically
precise angles, one jutting off a corner of the canvas. "He put one
little imperfection in there to trick us," she said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Barbra Berates Bush</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after she took the stage of the Kodak Theatre Sunday night
for a Democratic fund-raiser, Barbra Streisand began her tirade
against President George Bush and the Republican Party, blaming them
for everything from the struggling economy to bad air quality. She
substituted criticisms for the lyrics to her hit "The Way We Were."</TE>
<TE>   "Scattered pictures ... of the House we left behind," she sang.
"People ... see their savings slip away/As they see the world around
them get more frightening every day." She paused periodically during
the song to lecture the audience on what she sees as the failings of
Republicans and to blast Bush for having "the arrogance of wanting
unlimited power. I find George Bush and Dick Cheney frightening," she
said. "I find Donald Rumsfeld and John Ashcroft frightening....I find
bringing the country to the brink of a war, unilaterally, five weeks
before an election, questionable and very, very frightening."</TE>
<TE>   The event, which also featured performances by Barry Manilow,
comedian Steve Harvey and singers Three Mo' Tenors, raised $6 million
to help win a Democratic majority in the U.S. House of
Representatives.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Soggy Success?</TE>
<TE>   Party planners probably felt pretty safe scheduling an outdoor
event in Burbank for late September, but the rain fell--at times in
sheets--on Warner Bros.' bash celebrating the start of the new TV
season, held Saturday night at the studio's lot.</TE>
<TE>   Stars of such Warner Bros.-produced shows as "The West Wing"
(three-time Emmy winner Allison Janney called out winners of the
raffle prizes), "Smallville" and "The Drew Carey Show" mingled among
the crowd of studio executives, agents and the like, who were treated
this year to exhibition boxing matches as well as free-flowing drinks
and a wide variety of food to munch upon.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the real story was the weather, with the rain coming and
going throughout the evening, on more than one occasion sending
partygoers running for cover under whatever shelves and outcroppings
they could find.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paid-Up Dues</TE>
<TE>   When John Nelson III decided to enter the family business, his
father, director and former teen star David Nelson, had one piece of
advice: There are no shortcuts--you have to pay your dues. "In
Hollywood, there's this idea about the quick killing and getting out
of town," he said. "But the quick fix is not what it's about."</TE>
<TE>   So Nelson, then a teenager, went to work on his first film set,
fetching food and coffee. His skills in sandwiches got him up the
next step, assisting as a location scout. And, paying dues in
installments, movie by movie, he became a second assistant director,
then first assistant director. He worked with Christine Lahti, and
both John and Nick Cassavetes.</TE>
<TE>   "I was slowly climbing the ladder," said Nelson, "bigger and
better pictures."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the first movie produced by Nelson, "100 Mile Rule,"
premieres at the Hollywood Film Festival. It stars Jake Weber, Maria
Bello, David Thornton and Michael McKean.</TE>
<TE>   The movie is a morality tale of a man who, despite his happy
marriage, has a one-night stand while on a business trip. He suffers
the consequences when the woman decides to blackmail him. Nelson's
grandfather Ozzie Nelson even has a cameo--a video supposedly
containing explicit scenes of the one-night stand turns out to
feature old episodes of "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet."</TE>
<TE>   "It was a little hommage to my dad," said Nelson. "He thought it
was very funny."</TE>
<TE>   It was also a pointed moment in a story about a guy who loses his
moral bearings and stands to "lose everything in one fell swoop," he
said. The lesson? "You're never that safe. Whenever applicable,
always take the high road."</TE>
<TE>   Nelson admits that his life lessons may be boring, "but being a
regular guy is not a bad thing," he said. "Normal is seen as bad. But
normal to me is good."</TE>

<LD>JAZZ MODERNISM</LD>
<LD>   From Ellington and Armstrong to Matisse and Joyce</LD>
<LD>   by Alfred Appel Jr.</LD>
<TE>   Alfred A. Knopf</TE>
<TE>   286 pp., $35</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Jazz Modernism" is an erudite tome pulsing with bebop music,
drawing in the retina with classics of modern visual art and using
definitive examples of early to mid-20th century literary art to
establish the place of classic jazz in the great modernist tradition
of the arts.</TE>
<TE>   Focusing on jazz from 1920 to 1950--especially the groundbreaking
work of Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Fats Waller, Billie Holiday,
Jack Teagarden and Charlie Parker--"Jazz Modernism" attempts to draw
distinct parallels between these musical greats and those figures
whom Alfred Appel Jr. views as the jazz musicians' counterparts in
the visual and literary arts. Though the connections Appel traces are
at times tenuous, there's excitement and rhythm to the reading.</TE>
<TE>   Appel considers the paintings and drawings of Piet Mondrian, Henri
Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Fernand Leger and Joan Miro, for example,
along with the spare sculptures of Alexander Calder and the collages
of Carlo Carra (the book teems with art, 127 full-color
illustrations).</TE>
<TE>   He also investigates the literary art of James Joyce, Ernest
Hemingway, Nathanael West, William Faulkner and others. His intention
is to determine how these modernist artists may have been influenced
by the jazz of their era, and how their art, in turn, may have
affected the music.</TE>
<TE>   "Jazz Modernism" is written the way a jazz musician performs, with
spontaneity, riffs that spark our attention at times, and at others,
seem to drone on, moving in directions the reader may not be prepared
to follow. Jazz drummer Jo Jones becomes a kind of narrative
presence, given life by Appel to serve as "the interactive force
responsible for accenting the music ... making it all accessible."</TE>
<TE>   Jones is used erratically as a foil for Appel's broad
pronouncements. (Jones seems to appear and disappear throughout the
narrative at the author's whim.) We're told, for instance, that
Matisse's "Interior with a Violin Case" is "a good example of a needy
case." Appel explains: "If the violin is being played (the case is
empty), the sonic effect isn't enough for Jo Jones" who wants "to
transfuse and renovate Matisse's wishy-washy interior" to match the
dynamism of Matisse's "Jazz" series, which, "Jones must see as the
chromatic equivalent of so many riffs by Basie's brass and saxophone
sections .... "</TE>
<TE>   Are you digging it? If not, perhaps Appel's improvisational jazz
approach is less than successful. Rather than warming his audience up
and then leading us into the esoterica of his theories, Appel jumps
in with a hefty degree of arcane material, offering correlations
that, though self-evident to him, may require more explanation and
background for those not already converted.</TE>
<TE>   To be fair, these moments of confusion trade off with brilliant
licks of artistic syncopation, insight and delightful humor.</TE>
<TE>   Moving between visual, literary and musical art in this highly
liquid way, Appel outlines many lucid insights, as with this
description of Mondrian's basic geometry being an embodiment of
boogie-woogie: "Synesthesia rules and the painting swings," he writes
of "Broadway Boogie Woogie." "Listen especially to its driving
horizontal lines: 'Yellow white yellow / blue yellow yellow / red
yellow yellow yellow.' "</TE>
<TE>   Looking at the painting as we read these lines, we see his point.
At other times, though, his comparisons are indistinct, as in this
discussion of Louis Armstrong's "Shine": "Armstrong's scat attack
bounces the phrases around like grotesquely sprung eyeballs in some
of Picasso's preliminary drawings for 'Guernica' (1937); flying body
parts and vectors in comic-strip brawls and Tex Avery's animated
cartoons of the forties ... "</TE>
<TE>   The most intriguing part of the book is Appel's explication of
James Joyce's "Ulysses," particularly the Molly Bloom chapter, which
he hails as the century's greatest piece of vernacular prose. (Appel
is a professor emeritus of English at Northwestern University.)</TE>
<TE>   In jazz terms, he tells us, Molly's narrative pulse of 86 beats
per minute "is at least fifteen years ahead of its time ...," a
precursor of jazz. Though many have found that particular Joyce text
difficult to penetrate, Molly's "syncopations" become palpable, Appel
explains, if one punctuates the opening passages with slashes, which
he does on the page, adding a musical dimension to a piece of iconic
modernist writing.</TE>
<TE>   To get the reader in the right groove to appreciate Joyce, Appel
suggests the publication of a paperback volume containing only the
excerpted Molly Bloom chapter, packaged with a compact disc of jazz
performances set on or very close to Molly's metronomic beat.</TE>
<TE>   This is a great idea, and one which brings up a problem for those
readers lacking an encyclopedic grasp of jazz history and a extensive
library of original jazz recordings: Without the ability to hear the
music that Appel references, many of his riffs come off flat, if not
nearly silent.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the narrative is engaging, particularly Appel's depiction
of jazz musicians subverting the bland and at times racist material
they were asked to perform.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, "Jazz Modernism" provides, if not an ironclad argument
linking these artists, then a cogent demonstration of the modern
artists' quintessential ability to transfigure the banal into
original art--jazz musicians wholeheartedly included in that
"modernist" classification.</TE>

<HD>Besides a Great Idea, an Inventor Can Use a Patent on
Patience</HD>
<DH>Clever gadgets are the products not just of imagination but
also of elusive financing</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. MICHAEL KENNEDY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Back in 1983, John Picone had an inventive idea. If the electric
screwdriver was such a big hit, why not an electric wrench?</LD>
<LD>   At the time, Picone was working as a machinist, a major plus in
creating gizmos from scratch. Armed with his metalworking skills, he
set to work building the world's first electrically powered
adjustable wrench. By 1985, he had the wrench and the patent to go
with it.</LD>
<LD>   And therein lies one of the more vexing aspects of invention. When
Picone, of Oceanside, N.Y., conceived his wrench idea, he was a young
man. Only now, after almost 20 years of failed efforts to attract
funding, is his dream of marketing it coming true.</LD>
<TE>   His big break came when his wrench was the 1999 grand prize winner
of Hammacher Schlemmer's Search for Invention contest, which netted
him a cool $5,000 and enough buzz about his product to allow him to
move forward and attract financing for his own manufacturing
facility. His prototype was a hit at a recent national hardware
convention. "I could have sold a thousand of them," said Picone of
his $39.99 wrench, which grips a bolt with the flick of a
battery-powered switch.</TE>
<TE>   The wrench will soon be an item in the famed Hammacher Schlemmer
catalog--the oldest in the United States and one that specializes in
high-end gadgetry.</TE>
<TE>   Picone's long road to recognition is nothing new. In fact, for
inventors it's the norm. Lawrence Udell, the director of the
California Invention Center, said that less than 3% of all patents
issued earn more money than is spent on development--a figure that
can range from a few hundred dollars to millions. And he also said
most amateur inventors haven't a clue about how hard it is to move
from idea to market. That includes everything from building prototype
molds, obtaining patents, finding a manufacturer and, finally,
putting the invention on the market.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to discourage more than encourage," said Udell, whose
invention center was founded in 1995 at Cal State Hayward. "They
think all they've got to do is file for a patent and the world beats
a path to their door."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the idea of inventing the next must-have gadget is
alluring, hence the popularity of the 9-year-old Hammacher Schlemmer
contest. Even with its stringent entry rules, which include already
having obtained a patent, the contest has attracted more than 200
entrants this year, with inventions ranging from Space Age pool
heaters to global positioning pet trackers.</TE>
<TE>   The catalog company, which has been around for more than 150
years, prides itself on having introduced the first pop-up toaster,
electric razor, steam iron, microwave oven and cordless telephone,
among other now-common appliances. The winners of this year's contest
will be announced Oct. 29 at the company's Chicago store.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish more companies did it," said Joanne Hayes-Rines, the
editor of Inventors' Digest, who said the Hammacher Schlemmer contest
is a way to spotlight ingenious creations that might otherwise go
unnoticed.</TE>
<TE>   Take, for instance, the mashed-potato maker by Carmina O'Connor
that was a finalist in last year's contest. She actually went to
several stores looking for such a machine before finally realizing
that one did not exist. So she decided to make one herself, using
parts from other appliances she already owned. Once she concocted a
design, albeit a crude one, that would cook and mash (but not peel)
potatoes she applied for and received a patent on her machine. That
might have been the end of the story were it not for the contest.
O'Connor, of Chicago, submitted her idea to Hammacher Schlemmer after
receiving a flier in the mail inviting her to enter the invention
contest.</TE>
<TE>   When informed she was a semifinalist, she and her sister-in-law
stayed up all night piecing together the prototype with a glue gun.
Now the potato masher--looking like a cross between a bread machine
and a Cuisinart--is in the hands of an engineering company, which is
putting together a machine that, with luck, should be on the market
in about a year.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be great if we could get it out in time for next
Thanksgiving," she said.</TE>
<TE>   One thing about inventors, there are lots of them. The U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office has more than 6 million patents on file. The
first U.S. patent ever granted, in 1790, was for potash, an
ingredient in fertilizer and soap. In 1999, Patent No. 6,000,000 was
granted for the technology used to transfer data from computers to
Palm Pilots. Last year, more than 350,000 patent applications were
filed. There is even an inventor's hall of fame in Akron, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Next month, the U.S. Patent office will bring all living inductees
of that hall together for a luncheon at the Library of Congress. They
include such diverse inventors as the creators of Scotchgard and the
first personal computer. One member is James Fergason, whose liquid
crystal displays have revolutionized the world of consumer
electronics. He began inventing to supplement his income while
working for Westinghouse and now holds more than 140 patents. His
view is that most everyone has the capability to invent something.</TE>
<TE>   "My own approach has been to learn as much as I can about things
that are not common knowledge and then look at them from a little
different direction," he said. "People get in the habit of looking at
things in only one way. But if they look at things from a slightly
different angle, suddenly it's valuable."</TE>
<TE>   But only valuable if it actually exists. Andy Gibbs, whose Patent
Cafe is now compiling all patents ever issued onto a computer data
base, said most people think of a useful idea, then never do anything
about it. He calls them armchair inventors.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't bother to search, research, develop, invest and
learn the inventing process, you will forever remain in your
armchair," said Gibbs, whose Yuba City company will help evaluate the
inventions submitted to Hammacher Schlemmer.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most daunting difficulties for inventors is getting the
attention of companies that might manufacture their products. Udell,
of the California Invention Center, said part of the reason is that
major companies shy away from individual inventors for fear they
might later be sued for stealing ideas. But Udell said there are
other avenues inventors can use, including hiring a lawyer to
initiate the inquiry. Another source for inventors is the Licensing
Executive Society, whose members are involved in the various aspects
of intellectual property. The society has more than 10,000 members
worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great way for an inventor to find someone legitimate to
evaluate what they've got," Udell said. "It's a way for an inventor
to get some help for free."</TE>
<TE>   Udell and others also warn against companies that advertise their
ability to take an idea and get it to market. Said Hayes-Rines of
Inventors' Digest: "For the most part, these marketing companies do
almost nothing to put a product on the market. We need to teach
people what to do without spending a lot of money up front."</TE>
<TE>   Brown &amp; Michaels, an Ithaca, N.Y., law firm that specializes in
patents and trademarks, has compiled a step-by-step outline of how
bogus companies milk thousands of dollars from inventors by simply
stringing them along. "We have had many inventors come to our firm
over the years who have been taken by these companies," said the
report. "The lucky ones only got to the first stage, the unlucky ones
lost tens of thousands of dollars."</TE>
<TE>   According to the report, the typical marketing company asks for an
upfront fee of as much as $800, then responds to an invention idea
with a glowing report that is virtually a form letter. From there,
the bills increase dramatically for little or no work.</TE>
<TE>   "My rule is: Don't give up your job and don't dip into family
savings," said Udell.</TE>
<TE>   While most inventors don't make it off the ground, some do
persevere. One is Ed Dudkowski of Petaluma, Calif., who is about to
begin marketing a suitcase-sized device that takes the place of
cumbersome editing machines that now have to be trucked to a site. .
With this device, he can film and edit such things as amateur stage
productions, presentations and school programs with a portable
control room that weighs 25 pounds. "It's been easier to invent the
device than to market it," said Dudkowski. "I've spent the last year
writing a business plan and putting a marketing team together."</TE>
<TE>   Another is Mark Publicover, a former contractor from Saratoga,
Calif., who designed a contraption to protect children from falling
off trampolines. The idea came to him after a neighbor's daughter
took a nasty spill from one.</TE>
<TE>   Five years after building his prototype that surrounds a
trampoline with netting, Publicover finally turned a profit this
year, but not before going through a series of setbacks and more than
$1 million, much of that his own money. Now, he sells about 800
trampoline enclosures a day. They sell at various retailers and over
the Internet at about $200 apiece. The downside is that he is now
embroiled in a lawsuit against companies with similar products.</TE>
<TE>   Publicover said there were moments, especially in the early going,
when it seemed as if his invention didn't have a chance. As he put
it, "Nobody jumped. Retailers didn't think people would be compelled
to buy it." Then, as his funds were running out, Publicover scraped
together enough money to place a full-page ad in Disney Magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "Suddenly," he said, "the phone was ringing off the hook."</TE>

<LD>Anne of Austria, Queen of France</LD>
<LD>   Do you like to pick out your own clothes? Do you prefer wearing
fancy or casual things? We wear different clothes for different
occasions and activities. Think about how you look on picture day at
school or when there's a family portrait. Do you take extra time
combing your hair and choosing an outfit? Just imagine how special
your outfit would be if you were a king or a queen!</LD>
<LD>   The painter of "Portrait of Anne of Austria, the Queen of France,"
Peter Paul Rubens, was the most popular portraitist of his time. He
lived in Antwerp (a city in Belgium) but traveled all over Europe to
paint for royals, aristocrats, church leaders and other powerful
people in the 17th century.</LD>
<TE>   Portraits tell you about a person's identity. In this painting,
Rubens captures the queen's seriousness and elegance. She wears a
delicate crown, as well as a velvet dress, trimmed with lace and fur
and covered with jewels and gold embroidery.</TE>
<TE>   Do you think the queen would have dressed like this every day?
Probably. Her clothes were like a costume. They played a big part in
telling people that she was very important.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe you will be dressing up for Halloween later this month. Are
you still looking for just the right costume? The "Halloween and
Costumes" Family Day on Oct. 19 at the Norton Simon might inspire
you.</TE>
<TE>   You can also get ideas from the paintings and sculptures of kings,
queens, gods and heroes. For more information call (626) 844-6980 or

<DH>Antiwar movement reflects a different America than in past

<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"We want to poison your mind," teases the woman with slate-colored
hair outside First Baptist Church in Koreatown. Swathed in natural
fibers and sporting an anti-Dubya button, she's minding a table piled
high with books, pamphlets and stickers decrying the sorry state of
the planet--wars, corporate malfeasance, environmental
disasters-in-the-making, and so on--along with half a dozen copies of
the revolutionary rabble-rousings of Chairman Mao.</LD>
<LD>   Change a few names and haircuts, and the scene could be an outtake
from the American peace movement's tie-dyed past--Berkeley or
Chicago, circa 1960-something. But inside the Romanesque-Revival
church's packed sanctuary, a fired-up multilingual L.A. crowd mirrors
the complex and rapidly changing profile of Americans opposed to a
new war with Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   As the Bush administration turns up the rhetorical heat on Saddam
Hussein and an anxious world braces for a possible Desert Storm
redux, American peace activists are busy marshaling their own forces.
And while the choreography of dissent sometimes stirs up ghosts of
Selma, Vietnam and the anti-nukes protests of the early 1980s, the
current peace movement seems eager to find a voice and image suited
to a very different America than existed 40 or even 20 years ago.</LD>
<TE>   In that process, some observers say, peace activists are moving
beyond a singular, post-Vietnam cultural stereotype that depicts them
as clueless hippies hopelessly mired in the peacenik past, as
apologists for whatever power-mad dictator is on the prowl, or as
cynical trouble-makers of questionable patriotism whose "fringe"
antics give aid and comfort to America's enemies, as Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft has suggested.</TE>
<TE>   "Dissident political activity that's portrayed in this country
leads people to believe that anyone who gets out in the street must
be kind of crazy," says Robert Jensen, a professor of journalism at
the University of Texas at Austin, who became a marked man in the
Lone Star State last fall after writing several columns attacking
U.S. military policy in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   There was a vague feeling of the torch being passed at First
Baptist's recent two-hour rally, an evening of agitprop theater that
mixed old-time progressive sentiments with a newfound sense of
urgency. And if anyone present was worrying aloud about finding the
peace movement's next Martin Luther King, Tom Hayden or Helen
Caldicott, it was drowned out in a poly-lingual chorus of shared
convictions.</TE>
<TE>   Filling the pews of the 1,500-seat church were the movement's
traditional shock troops: trade unionists, middle-age progressives of
various creeds, battle-hardened veterans of the civil rights and
Vietnam War struggles. But clapping and singing alongside them were
young anti-globalization activists, interspersed with many Central
American and Asian immigrants, some of whose countries have suffered
their own, albeit less publicized versions of 9/11-style terrorist
atrocities.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the speakers and much of the symbolism were familiar.
Labor leader Maria Elena Durazo extolled a union member who perished
at the World Trade Center. Syndicated columnist Bob Scheer chastised
Taliban brutality and Washington demagoguery. Hollywood star Alfre
Woodard gave soothing line-readings from the Koran, the Bible and the
Bhagavad-Gita. Between speakers, a mixed-race choir delivered a thin
but plucky rendition of "Down by the Riverside."</TE>
<TE>   But the rally's emotional climax occurred when Kelly Campbell and
Barry Amundson, members of September Eleventh Families for Peaceful
Tomorrows, a group composed of relatives of 9/11 victims, embraced
beneath a giant video screen where images of the burning twin towers
had flashed by moments earlier. Barry Amundson, 32, is the brother of
Craig Amundson, a 28-year-old Army multimedia specialist who was
killed when the hijacked American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the
Pentagon; Campbell is his sister-in-law. Both were in Los Angeles to
voice their conviction that the response to last year's attacks on
New York and Washington shouldn't be more mangled bodies and grieving
relatives.</TE>
<TE>   "Join us in a new peace movement," exhorted the Rev. George Regas,
catching the evening's forward-looking tone. "We will change the face
of this earth!" Rising to its feet, the congregation roared its
approval.</TE>
<TE>   Less easily pigeonholed than their predecessors, and more reliant
on Internet mailing lists than sloganized placards, today's peace
activists are more globally attuned and media-savvy than the bearded
and sandaled legions of yore, some say.</TE>
<TE>   "Our general argument is the same one: that we've got to find
alternatives to war because we don't like the notion of killing
people," says Medea Benjamin, a former U.N. economist and Green Party
candidate for U.S. Senate whose face was on front pages from New York
to Hong Kong last week after she and a colleague heckled Defense
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld while he was testifying on Capitol Hill.</TE>
<TE>   But her group's message, Benjamin says, "has to be tailored almost
on a daily basis to what is the message of those who want to go to
war."</TE>
<TE>   "They have so much more access to the media and to the American
people that we're always on the defensive."</TE>
<TE>   Unfazed by polls that show a majority of Americans would support
going to war with Iraq to stop Saddam Hussein from amassing weapons
of mass destruction, today's activists say their aims aren't that
different from those of previous generations. What's changed is the
movement's composition, focus and tactics, which have been
conditioned by a sound-bite culture where world politics gets
simplified and perceptions often rule.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nonviolence Isn't a Fad</TE>
<TE>   In the calculus of the contemporary peace movement, two numbers
have logarithmic power: 9/11 and the 1960s. The first is a date that
no American will soon forget. The second is a cultural epoch that
simply refuses to go away.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell, co-director of Peaceful Tomorrows, says that while
taking part in marches over the last year she's been taunted by
people yelling, "Go back to the '60s! This is the '90s!" Never mind
that the '90s went out with the Clintons and high-tech start-ups.
What Campbell objects to is the hecklers' presumption that
nonviolence is somehow passe, a fad with no more intellectual staying
power than a lava lamp.</TE>
<TE>   "I was born in 1972. I don't appreciate being considered a
throwback," says Campbell, speaking by phone from her Bay Area home.
"I don't think war is a good idea under any circumstances. So
partially I believe that nonviolent alternatives to war are always
better. And that doesn't mean doing nothing. That means taking
actions."</TE>
<TE>   While professing their abhorrence of the Iraqi dictator, Peaceful
Tomorrows members have been crisscrossing the country this year
preaching nonviolent alternatives to the Baghdad street-fighting
scenarios being aired in Washington. Some members also have visited
Afghanistan to meet with families who lost loved ones during the U.S.
bombing campaign to oust the Taliban regime and Osama bin Laden's
terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   Their pacifist stance has surprised and angered those who thought
revenge and retaliation the only sane response to 9/11. But group
members say they don't want their personal tragedies used to justify
more bloodshed. "We don't really want to live with Saddam Hussein in
charge of Iraq," Campbell says. "On the other hand, what's the price
of killing a whole bunch of other people to get rid of Saddam
Hussein? That is not going to make us any safer in this country. It
is going to promote terrorism, if anything."</TE>
<TE>   Activists acknowledge that "make love, not war" can be a pretty
tough sell when Americans still live in fear of stepping on
commercial jetliners or taking a high-rise elevator. But David
Krieger, founder and president of the Santa Barbara-based Nuclear Age
Peace Foundation, predicts that more people will find the nerve to
speak out for peace if war draws nigh.</TE>
<TE>   "Many Americans have felt reasonably comfortable with going after
Al Qaeda and the Taliban," he says, "but I think doubts crept in with
the number of civilians that have been killed in Afghanistan. And I
think now, shifting gears to Iraq, that's a disconnect for many, many
people."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Young Recruits</TE>
<TE>   Despite the grizzled image some have of it, the peace movement
gained new recruits during the prosperous, relatively peaceful '90s
from young people who came to the cause via environmental and
globalization-related issues, says Jeff Guntzel, 27, co-coordinator
of Voices in the Wilderness, a 6-year-old Chicago-based group.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these folks are experienced in the anti-globalization
movement, and bring a new environmental awareness that we're wanting
to build on," he says. "But it has to go further than that."</TE>
<TE>   Guntzel says that Voices in the Wilderness devotes its resources
less to marching and picketing than to bearing witness to acts of war
and human rights violations. It also tries to be a conduit for
anecdotal, firsthand reports from areas of conflict and strife, the
kind of e-mail-like, personalized reportage that isn't always
available from the mass media. "We want to kind of learn the lesson
of the first Gulf War, when there was such a black hole of
information coming on Iraq," Guntzel says.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1996 the group has sponsored four dozen trips to Iraq by
members bearing small quantities of medicine--technically in
violation of U.N. sanctions that bar trade with the regime.</TE>
<TE>   "I had been to a protest here and there, but I was always
frustrated by protests because I felt like it didn't give me the
right venue for discussing an important issue," Guntzel continues.
"I'm very anti-slogan."</TE>
<TE>   Looking at this new generation of activists, professor Jensen
suggests that popular perceptions of the peace movement need
updating. "There's an image in people's minds of what a
left-progressive political activist is: a young person with green
hair and multiple piercings out in the streets of Seattle throwing
rocks," he says, referring to demonstrations against the World Trade
Organization meeting in Seattle in 1999. "These movements are much
more complex, much more deep."</TE>
<TE>   Jensen believes that the current movement against war with Iraq
comprises at least three distinct elements: traditional American
peace groups rooted in faith traditions, such as the Quakers; the
left-progressive wing of American politics; and Muslims and people of
Middle Eastern heritage.</TE>
<TE>   So far, he believes, serious, informed debate over the possibility
of war has been stifled by a simplistic mass-media culture and a
quiescent Democratic Party. "No one in the peace movement that I know
really looks to the Democratic Party to kind of carry the banner for
a global justice movement," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Some question whether the American left even functions as the
peace movement's base camp anymore. In an essay in the Aug. 23 issue
of the Nation, Adam Shatz observed that the 9/11 attacks and their
aftermath had created a crisis for the American left, wrecking
intellectual friendships and causing rifts not seen since the
McCarthy-Stalin era.</TE>
<TE>   "What the left needs to cultivate is an intelligent synthesis, one
that recognizes that the United States has a role to play in the
world while also warning of an imperial foreign policy," Shatz wrote.</TE>
<TE>   With or without the Democratic Party, the Old Left, the New Left,
love beads, the Port Huron Statement or the collected works of
Herbert Marcuse, the American peace movement has leapt into the
post-9/11 political fray. And what's wrong, some ask, with having a
peace movement that's made up of many different pieces and no clear
leaders or spokespersons?</TE>
<TE>   Krieger, briefly at home in Santa Barbara last week before heading
off to address an Indiana church group, argues that going to war or
not going to war shouldn't be a decision left only to preachers,
professional agitators and the relative few in any generation willing
to take a controversial stand or take to the streets. "I don't think
it's the responsibility of peace organizations to provide a
conscience for people," he says. "It's a responsibility that we all
share in a democracy."</TE>

<LD>Built for a gated community with no thought to cost or owners
associations' covenants, the custom homes for sale in Newport Beach
are so ostentatious that even ex-Tyco execs would find them
excessive. At $400 to $800 a square foot, these one-of-kind showcases
are feats of architecture and engineering, as well as displays of the
latest in construction materials and interior design.</LD>
<LD>   Granted, the neighborhood looks a little strange. A Hobbit
hideaway with stone walls and circular doors shares a cul-de-sac with
a wood-sided American classic, a sandstone castle sprouting a mermaid
weathervane, and a stoic brick fire station. And even though they
don't have garages, bathrooms or even closets, bidding for them is
expected to be robust.</LD>
<LD>   Why? It's for a good cause.</LD>
<TE>   All but one of the dozen playhouses on display at the Fashion
Island shopping center in Newport Beach will be auctioned Oct. 12 to
raise money for homeless shelters. HomeAid's Project Playhouse was
launched in Orange County 11 years ago and has branched out
nationally.</TE>
<TE>   Five other playhouses will be on view through Oct. 17 at the Oaks
Shopping Center in Thousand Oaks to benefit the homeless in Los
Angeles and Ventura counties. Both locations offer tours and drawings
to win one of the structures.</TE>
<TE>   At the auction, the highest bidders get a relative bargain. The
120-square-foot playhouses are valued at $50,000 to $100,000, but
they generally sell for a fifth of their cost. Making up the
difference are the designers, woodworkers and other professionals in
the building industry who donate time and materials to create these
small wonders.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looky-loos and those serious about building a dream home will see
plenty of fancy stuff--stucco that imitates stone, flat-screen TVs
set into walls and other trick treatments that can be translated to
full-size houses. However, few homeowners would approve the expense
of other options seen here, such as copper instead of galvanized tin
flashing and slate instead of clay tile roofs. And even your most
eccentric neighbor probably wouldn't install a fog or bubble machine
on his property.</TE>
<TE>   But this is not real life, says Michael Schrock of Urban Arena
Landscape Architecture &amp; Planning, who for 10 years has been letting
his blueprints run wild to benefit HomeAid, a nonprofit group started
in 1989 by the Building Industry Assn. "You see things on these
houses that you won't find at Home Depot."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Schrock designed a "Father of the Bride" house with mini rocking
chairs on the front porch and custom French doors leading to a
balcony. The patriotic red, white and blue interior has a faux
fireplace with a flickering red light, a water-hookup for the
porcelain kitchen sink and dormer windows illuminating an L-shaped
loft. Traditional pine floors and white walls conceal 21st century
wiring for high-speed Internet access, digital TVs and video-game
consoles.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping to playhouse scale, the front door is only 3 1/2 feet
high, but Schrock, a father who knows best, understands the
importance of adult access to kids' spaces. On one side of the house
is a 4 1/2-foot-high Dutch door that allows taller visitors a way
inside without having to bend like a paperclip. Painted gables and
other architectural details distract the eye from places where the
scale has been fudged.</TE>
<TE>   For all the liberties the design teams take, creating on a small
scale is restricting, says L.J. Edgcomb of Pulte Homes. After all, a
2-by-4 is still a 2-by-4. "We use regular materials to make something
small," he says. "We cut it down, but not so fine that it doesn't
hold up to the rigors of horseplay or it compromises the structural
integrity." For the two-story he built from Schrock's plans, Edgcomb
narrowed 4-inch-wide siding to 2 1/2 inches, and sliced 2-inch-wide
picket fence posts in half.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Despite long hours hunkered over saws and knuckles scraped from
working in tiny corners, the biggest problem is constructing a
transportable playhouse. Each team starts with an 8-by-10-foot wood
base. They build up and out from there, but cupolas, lookouts and
anything higher than 10 feet or extending beyond the base must be
detached when the completed structure is moved from the job site,
which is typically next to where an actual full-size home is being
built. "We go where the labor and materials are," Edgcomb says.</TE>
<TE>   After the auction, the hefty playhouses--some weigh tons--are
moved again, from the shopping center to their new owners' yards.
Eyebolts attached to the wood bases allow them to be hoisted by
helicopters and cranes over buildings and utility lines.</TE>
<TE>   As anyone who's ever endured a home construction project knows,
there are always additional costs. Moving the playhouses 15 miles
from the shopping center is included in the sale price, but one
generous supporter who paid $105,000 for two playhouses last year had
to write another check for $3,200 to have them trucked, then dropped
via cranes onto his Las Vegas property.</TE>
<TE>   But it's all for a good cause. Last year, Orange County's Project
Playhouse raised nearly half a million dollars from its tours, raffle
tickets and auction, and, since its inception, has built 34 shelters
and repaired others for those who need them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tours of these child-size neighborhoods are offered Saturdays and
Sundays. Tickets are $5 to $10. For more information on the
playhouses in Newport Beach, which are on view through Oct. 12, call
(949) 553-9510. For those in Thousand Oaks, through Oct. 17, call

<LD>She needed instruction in everything from filling out a job
application to cleaning a tub to deciphering the schedule of buses
she'd take to get to her hotel housekeeping job on time. She needed
financial help to buy groceries and pay for upkeep on the rickety
house our parents had left her when they died. She needed child care
for her young son during the hours she'd have to spend away.</LD>
<LD>   And most of all, my little sister--pregnant, unmarried and
unskilled, and just barely out of her teens--needed to be seen as
more than a woman reeking of failure, with an outstretched, empty
palm. She was not looking for a handout, but a hand up; she needed a
lifeline to succeed.</LD>
<LD>   Her redemption came through a welfare system that we've made sport
of disparaging. Job training, child care, transportation subsidies
... those were as important as that monthly check at helping her
steer away from poverty.</LD>
<TE>   That is still true today for millions of families, watching
anxiously as Congress considers changes to our nation's welfare
system, as its funding provisions expire this week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, welfare reform ushered in an era that was supposed
to promote self-sufficiency rather than dependency by imposing strict
deadlines on welfare recipients to find jobs or lose eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   The program has worked to cut welfare rolls and put millions to
work. More than half the adults who were on welfare when the laws
changed are no longer on welfare today. Los Angeles County sent more
than 150,000 people from welfare into the labor force in the first
four years of the welfare-to-work program.</TE>
<TE>   But does that mean it's a success? Depends on your measure.</TE>
<TE>   Surveys of former welfare recipients have found that most were
glad to be on the job, rather than on the dole, with between
two-thirds and three-quarters of them saying life had not been better
under welfare. But as many as a third of those who got jobs lost them
and landed back on welfare within a year. And 40% of those who left
welfare for jobs wound up poorer than when they relied on government
aid.</TE>
<TE>   Those numbers tell a story legislators need to hear. Most folks
would rather work than take a government check, but welfare reform
will only produce long-term effects if we give states the flexibility
to consider recipients' myriad needs.</TE>
<TE>   Too often the debate has evolved into a battle over welfare's
role. Promoters of toughening the rules say its primary role is to
get folks off the dole. Their critics say its aim is to protect the
well-being of children who would otherwise be raised in poverty.</TE>
<TE>   But do those things have to be at odds? Can't we recognize that
any welfare system needs to provide child care, education and
training, but that there is also value in holding any job, even a
low-paying one? Reforms in welfare may not lift all families out of
poverty but can pay dividends over time. And isn't part of ensuring
the well-being of children teaching them independence and
responsibility?</TE>
<TE>   Forsaking welfare for work doesn't tend to improve a family's
bottom line. Too many unskilled workers stuck in low-wage jobs
translates to too many families unable to earn their way out of
poverty. We need to make sure those children don't suffer by
providing access to medical care and working for educational parity.</TE>
<TE>   But children learn what they live. How do you measure the value of
seeing your parents work? Even when those parents are stuck in
low-wage jobs, there's a lesson for their kids to learn: If you want
a better life than your parents had, prepare to earn it, so that you
can take care of yourself.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was a bit of a family scandal when my sister ended up on
welfare in the 1980s. But in the three years until she married, got
job training and was able to leave welfare behind, those monthly
payments helped her meet her young son's needs. Back then, even
before welfare was reformed, there were opportunities for job
training for those who wanted to change.</TE>
<TE>   She found a job in hotel housekeeping. The work is hard, the pay
is low, the hours are long, the routine grueling. Her paycheck
sometimes barely stretches to cover her necessities. But she's made
her peace with making beds, scrubbing tubs, tending the messes
travelers leave, if that's what it takes to help provide for her
family. At home, she keeps a small file of commendations and
thank-you notes, from bosses impressed by her diligence and patrons
grateful for her extra touches.</TE>
<TE>   And she and her husband, both working full-time, have managed to
raise their only child, now 19, to understand that the tuition at his
parochial school, the jackets that he continually outgrew, the
collection of video games, his basketball shoes ... those came not
through the government's grudging largess, but from the effort his
parents made each day.</TE>
<TE>   Now, that young man rises early, takes two buses to the local
community college to study math and science and creative writing,
then rides another two buses to a grocery store, where he spends his
evening bagging groceries. He's saving for a car, then an apartment,
then preparing to raise his own family.</TE>
<TE>   That is the value of working versus welfare, measured not in a
quick calculation of paychecks and government benefits, but through
its deeper impact on succeeding generations.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, we owe struggling families opportunity--job training, child
care, education, and a playing field level enough to allow them to
rise.</TE>
<TE>   And those families owe something as well--a willingness to
sacrifice not just so that their children can eat, but so that they
can envision a future tied not to a welfare check, but to talents,
energy and dedication that, without a push, might go unrecognized.</TE>

<HD>Orphan Train Kid</HD>
<DH>Part 2 / The story so far: Archie's folks are thinking
about taking in an orphan.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>All week Archie thought about the orphan train. One minute he didn't
want any stranger moving in. He might be a nasty kid or eat more than
his share. The next minute Archie wondered if a boy might turn out to
be a help and a good pal too.</LD>
<LD>   One evening Archie sat carving a little horse from balsa wood.
While he whittled, he tried to imagine New York. He had never been to
any city in his life, so it was hard to picture one that was a hard
place for children wandering the streets alone. And who could imagine
having no Ma or Pa!</LD>
<LD>   Archie put the little horse in his pocket and went to his folks.</LD>
<TE>   "I guess it'll be OK to go down to the railroad depot tomorrow and
take a look," he told them.</TE>
<TE>   The next day Archie's family set out in their wagon and arrived
just in time to hear the engine whistle blow and see the train pull
in. A few other families came too.</TE>
<TE>   A lady stepped down from one of the train cars.</TE>
<TE>   "She must be the agent taking care of the children," Ma whispered.</TE>
<TE>   Several children followed, and the agent lined them up on the
platform.</TE>
<TE>   They were dressed in their Sunday best.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's go and meet them," said Pa. "There's a freckled boy,
wearing a cap ... maybe he .... "</TE>
<TE>   Looking at the children made Archie feel sad. One minute he wished
his family could adopt all of them so nobody would have to be an
orphan. The next minute he hoped that the other waiting families
would adopt them instead.</TE>
<TE>   Archie looked at the freckled boy. What did the boy feel? What was
he thinking? Archie wondered.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: Will Archie meet the boy on the platform?</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Smiler Levinson's latest title, "North Pole/South Pole," a
Holiday House easy reader science book, is out this week. This story

<LD>Once one of the richest Americans you never heard of, Philip F.
Anschutz has been getting so much publicity this year for his sports,
entertainment and telecommunications holdings that he's in danger of

may be worse punishment than turning over the $5 million that the New
York attorney general says Anschutz earned on allegedly sweetheart
stock deals awarded to him by brokerage Salomon Smith Barney.</LD>
<LD>   In a lawsuit filed Monday, Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer contends that
Anschutz, founder and former chairman of Qwest Communications
International Inc., and four other telecom executives reaped millions
of dollars on shares of hot new public companies they received in
return for giving Salomon lucrative investment banking work. The
62-year-old Anschutz, through a spokesman, denied any wrongdoing.</LD>
<TE>   Through three companies, Denver-based Anschutz controls more than
100 investments in a variety of businesses--telecom, technology, oil,
real estate, sports and entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   His holdings have made Anschutz worth $4.3 billion, according to
Forbes magazine, which recently ranked him as the 36th-richest person
in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, Anschutz is primarily a sports mogul: He owns
Staples Center and the Galaxy soccer team and is part owner of the
Kings hockey team and the National Basketball Assn.'s Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   His Anschutz Entertainment Group also is the developer and
operator of the $130-million Home Depot National Training Center, a
multi-sports complex set to open in June on 85 acres on the Cal State
Dominguez Hills campus in Carson.</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz also is a force in Hollywood. He bought three bankrupt
movie houses, including Edwards Theatres Circuit Inc. in Newport
Beach, and took the operation public this year as Regal Entertainment
Group.</TE>
<TE>   But for all his high-profile maneuvering, Anschutz has long been a
very private person.</TE>
<TE>   The last time he gave a news conference was in the early 1980s
when he tried to persuade the city of Denver to build a convention
center on his property instead of on the site the city had settled
on, said Jim Monaghan, a political consultant and sometimes spokesman
for Anschutz. The resulting brouhaha led the city to build on a third
site.</TE>
<TE>   Those who dislike Anschutz say he is opportunistic and not
civic-minded or generous with charitable contributions. But even
leading businesspeople request anonymity before criticizing
him--partly because many hope to do business with him.</TE>
<TE>   His privacy has allowed friends and business associates to portray
a man who is tenacious and forceful, yet quiet and rarely ruffled,
even in the most intense business discussions. After a long and
somewhat bitter campaign for the Denver convention center failed,
Anschutz was disappointed but moved on quickly to work on other
deals, Monaghan said.</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz bought the small Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad in
1984 and took control of the Southern Pacific Railroad four years
later, merging the two. The railroad gave him wide-sweeping rights of
way to lay fiber-optic cable. He sold most of the rail operation to
Union Pacific Railroad, keeping a 5.4% stake and the fiber-optic
network. He later spun off that network as Qwest and took it public.</TE>

<HD>264-Unit L.A. Complex Planned</HD>
<DH>Real Estate: Proposed $58-million apartment project is
aimed at young professionals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROGER VINCENT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Plans for a $58-million apartment complex near Staples Center in
downtown Los Angeles were announced Monday by developer Forest City
Residential West Inc.</LD>
<LD>   The 264-unit project, to be called Metropolitan Lofts, will be
built on the northeast corner of 11th and Flower streets.
Construction of the eight-story building, whose one- and two-bedroom
units are aimed at young professionals, is scheduled to begin in the
spring.</LD>
<LD>   "There are 3,000 housing units under development downtown, but
this is the first loft building being built from the ground up," said
Scott Johnson, a principal at Johnson Fain Partners, a Los Angeles
architecture firm known for such high-profile commercial projects as
Fox Plaza in Century City and Rincon Center in San Francisco. "We're
reinventing the model."</LD>
<TE>   Plans will be submitted to the city Department of Building and
Safety in December, a Forest City spokesman said. Financing will
include a $53-million tax-exempt bond from the California Debt Limit
Allocation Committee, a state program that offers low-interest loans
to developers of multifamily rental housing that includes
"affordable" units.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty percent of the Metropolitan Lofts units will be offered to
people whose incomes are less than half the state median. The least
expensive units will be offered at a third of the cost of market-rate
units, which will rent for $1,700 to $2,300 per month.</TE>
<TE>   The loft-style apartments will range in size from 690 square feet
to about 2,000 square feet. There also will be 11,000 square feet for
stores and restaurants or "live-work" units at street level, designed
for tenants who operate businesses out of their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Forest City executives have said that they want to build
market-rate and affordable housing in the South Park neighborhood
bounded by Olympic and Pico boulevards and Flower and Hill streets.
It is part of an 879-acre redevelopment zone created by the City
Council in May.</TE>
<TE>   The special district was set up to allow the Community
Redevelopment Agency to funnel property tax funds back into the area,
to condemn and acquire land and to relocate displaced residents and
businesses. The agency wants to create as many as 12,900 homes, a
quarter of which would be subsidized, over the next 30 to 45 years.</TE>
<TE>   The developer, a unit of Forest City Enterprises Inc. of
Cleveland, also plans to build housing next year in the 76-year-old
Subway Terminal Building, an empty 12-story structure on Hill Street
north of Pershing Square.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to downtown Los Angeles projects, Forest City has been
pursuing a number of developments in other cities. The company was
chosen to transform Denver's former Stapleton International Airport
into a 4,700-acre mixed-use urban community.</TE>
<TE>   Forest City Enterprises closed off 1 cent at $32.50 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Businesses Feel Pressure as Cargo Sits on Water</HD>
<DH>Commerce: The longer the West Coast ports are closed, the
more money importers and suppliers say they lose in delayed and
diverted shipments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON and EVELYN IRITANI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The lockout at West Coast ports caused ripples through the global
economy Monday as businesses from Hong Kong to Los Angeles scrambled
to reroute shipments, find backup supplies and figure out who may be
left holding the bag for delays that may quickly mount into the
billions of dollars.</LD>
<LD>   So far, the lockout has stranded at least 125 cargo ships loaded
with half a million shipping containers outside ports from San Diego
to Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   Produce suppliers already are losing money as their vegetables
shrivel on the docks. A Los Angeles recycler figures he has two more
days, tops, before unshipped trash makes his refuse yard immovable.
Some toy makers are worried that Christmas won't be coming if they
can't get their shipments from the Far East.</LD>
<TE>   "This is like being in the middle of a hurricane," said Charlie
Woo, president of Megatoys, a Los Angeles toy importer that has
containers of Christmas toys stranded on the water. "You know it is
coming, and there's nothing you can do about it."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the labor strife was not wholly unexpected, which gave
many companies time to plan. Some shipped goods early or stocked up
on inventory. But for most, the clock is ticking.</TE>
<TE>   The West Coast's 29 ports handle about half of the nation's
waterborne cargo and are the primary gateway for America's booming
trade with Asia. There are limited sea-based alternatives in North
America.</TE>
<TE>   The port of Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada, is already
operating at capacity, while the Mexican ports are small and
ill-equipped to handle large vessels. In fact, many modern cargo
freighters cannot fit through the Panama Canal to reach U.S. ports on
the East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Air cargo is an option. But logistics experts say it is simply too
expensive for heavy or low-margin goods such as toys, apparel,
furniture or agricultural commodities.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't take a container load and switch it over to air
freight," said Guy Fox, an executive vice president with the Redondo
Beach office of Global Transportation Services Inc., an international
logistics firm. "The cost will go up 100 times."</TE>
<TE>   The West Coast ports shutdown is the latest in a string of
developments weighing on the U.S. economy. Analysts worry that a
prolonged lockout or strike could quash the fledgling recovery,
particularly in California which is heavily dependent on
international trade.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, it isn't good either for the economy of California or
the United States," said Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the
Washington-based Institute for International Economics. "It's one
more hammer blow. The big question is how long it will last before
one side or the other gives."</TE>
<TE>   With West Coast ports refusing to accept cargo, the nation's
railroads already are struggling to prevent gridlock on the rails.
Union Pacific Railroad, which handles about 32,000 containers a week
from the West Coast, stopped accepting westbound export containers
Saturday and has started parking them in rail yards across the
country, said John Bromley, a railroad spokesman. The Burlington
Northern Santa Fe Railroad, Norfolk Southern and CSX railroads are
taking similar measures, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although some businesses will be able to withstand the effects of
a port shutdown for several weeks, others are feeling the economic
pain.</TE>
<TE>   Since Friday, Los Angeles produce supplier Dave Bouton has been
unable to ship three containers of tomatoes, lettuce and other
produce to Hawaii. He was forced to dump the week-old produce back on
the local market, costing him $30,000 in lost profit.</TE>
<TE>   Bouton said he could air-freight some of his produce, but it would
cost his Hawaiian buyers more, and ultimately that would slash the
amount of business he does there.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Bouton said, he was quickly exhausting the supply of
Ecuadorean bananas he brought in from the port last week. If he can't
retrieve his shipment later this week, he won't be able to supply his
local customers.</TE>
<TE>   "If this lasts a week or more, we'll start seeing some damaging
[losses]," Bouton said.</TE>
<TE>   Time also is running out for David Lee, general manager of Bestway
Recycling Co., which retrieves, sorts, bales and ships thousands of
tons of wastepaper from its four Los Angeles-area recycling centers.
About 90% of his refuse goes by cargo ship to China, where it is
recycled into corrugated boxes and other products.</TE>
<TE>   With nothing moving through the ports, Lee said, wastepaper
already is piling up at his facilities. He said that if the ports
aren't opened within a couple of days, he would be forced to convert
one of his facilities into a storage center, or search for a local
buyer, most likely at reduced prices.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not panicking yet, but it's getting tense," Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   Other industries face less time pressure. Southern California is
the U.S. headquarters for nearly all the leading Asian automakers,
and they all depend on the West Coast ports for delivery of cars and
parts from Japan and South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   But the top three Japanese automakers--Toyota Motor Corp., Honda
Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co.--make so many vehicles in the U.S. now
that a prolonged dock shutdown, they said, would not be catastrophic.
Hyundai Motor Co. and its Kia affiliate of South Korea are the only
significant players entirely dependent on imports.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, automakers try to have at least a 30-day supply of
vehicles "on the ground" in dealerships and at preparation
facilities. However, companies with hot-selling new vehicles that are
made overseas could develop spot shortages rather quickly. Nissan's
just-released 305Z sports car, for instance, is sold out at most
dealerships and buyers who have plunked down thousands of dollars in
deposits are anxiously awaiting cars that could be delayed for weeks
if the dock shutdowns continue.</TE>
<TE>   Parts are not as crucial an issue because, unlike cars, they can
be airlifted if necessary--although the costs would be staggering.
Honda, for instance, air-shipped tons of special high-strength steel
from Japan to manufacturing plants in Ohio and Alabama earlier this
year when U.S. supplies ran short. The company said it was still
cheaper to pay to fly the steel in than to idle its U.S. plants.
Honda said it buys 95% of the parts it uses for manufacturing cars
and trucks in the United States from U.S. suppliers and is not
terribly dependent on ocean shipping.</TE>
<TE>   John Carlsen, a director with Portland-based Cargo Claims
Management Systems, said his phone was ringing off the hook with
retailers, shipping lines and freight forwarders worried about who
would be responsible for paying for any losses related to the port
lockout. He said it would depend on how the contracts were written
and warned that there would be many months of legal wrangling ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all going to come down to the fine print," he said.</TE>

<HD>Courtney Love Settles Suit Against Vivendi Universal</HD>
<DH>Music: The singer is released from contract, increasing
doubts about artists' rights drive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Did Courtney cave?</LD>
<LD>   Rock singer Courtney Love, who sued the world's biggest music
company to expose the record industry's allegedly corrupt business
practices, had vowed never to settle. But she did exactly that on
Monday amid questions about the future of the artists' rights
movement she helped launch.</LD>
<LD>   After Love sued Vivendi Universal's Universal Music Group last
year to break her band's contract, the widow of Nirvana singer Kurt
Cobain complained about the "unconscionable and unlawful" business
and accounting practices of the major record labels. Since then,
dozens of stars have lined up to demand better contracts, health
benefits and other reforms.</LD>
<TE>   But after a series of legal setbacks, Love agreed to a settlement
that releases her from her record contract and provides her with
ownership of several unreleased recordings by her band, Hole. As part
of the settlement, Love gave permission to Universal to release
additional records by Nirvana, the seminal grunge rock band led by
her late husband, including a previously unreleased song. Universal
also will pay an estimated $12-million advance to be split among Love
and the two surviving members of Nirvana, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Love also announced Monday that she had settled litigation with
the two Nirvana members, Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic.</TE>
<TE>   Love vowed to continue to push for artists' rights in Sacramento
and Washington, "where this belongs," she said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   "We're glad that we have resolved this amicably and wish Courtney
well in all of her future endeavors," said Zach Horowitz, Universal
Music Group's president.</TE>
<TE>   After Cobain committed suicide in 1994, Love became a star in her
own right with her rock band. Hole achieved some commercial success
in the U.S., selling more than 3 million copies combined of its two
major albums.</TE>
<TE>   Love is the latest music star to sue her record label, only to
settle before trial. In June, the Dixie Chicks forged a new record
pact with an estimated $20-million signing advance just 10 months
after accusing their record company, Sony Music, of "systematic
thievery" and under-reporting royalties.</TE>
<TE>   But Love's case helped spur dozens of artists to activism and
forced the industry to defend its practices in front of lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   Still, a California Senate bill to repeal a provision of state law
that binds musicians to their contracts longer than other workers
died this summer amid heavy industry lobbying.</TE>
<TE>   To some musicians, Love's settlement underscored how difficult it
can be for them to take on the five major record conglomerates.</TE>
<TE>   Love's dispute with Universal erupted in December 1999, when she
notified the music powerhouse that she would no longer record for the
company because it had improperly acquired her contract from another
label. Universal sued Love in January 2000, demanding compensation
for five undelivered albums. Love countersued in February 2001,
claiming that the record industry's long-term contracts violate
California's so-called seven-year statute, which says entertainers
cannot be tied to any company for more than seven years.</TE>
<TE>   If the artists' rights bill became law, it could introduce a
free-agency system similar to ones in the film and sports industries.
To avoid testing the law, record labels typically have agreed to
rewrite the contracts of disgruntled stars.</TE>
<TE>   Nirvana members Grohl and Novoselic sued Love in December,
accusing her of trying to seize control of Nirvana's music for her
own financial gain. In addition to causing her legal bills to mount,
the lawsuit cast Love as a hypocrite in the artists' rights movement.</TE>
<TE>   Love initially scoffed at the idea of settling her case against
Universal, and the company braced for a full-scale legal war.</TE>
<TE>   But a series of rulings by Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge
Fumiko Wasserman winnowed the case down to a fairly common
breach-of-contract trial. Moreover, Universal raised the specter of
releasing a modest Nirvana greatest-hits CD package--without a
celebrated but unreleased Nirvana song Love still had claim
to--unless she resolved the lawsuit over her band, Hole. The Nirvana
track, "You Know You're Right," is believed to be the final song
recorded by the band. It appeared on the Internet several weeks ago
and has received airplay on radio stations nationwide, threatening
commercial sales of a Nirvana package.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wonderful settlement for the Cobain heirs and the other
surviving band members and the public," said Yale Lewis, Love's
attorney.</TE>
<TE>   In settling the contract case with Love, Universal will receive a
percentage of two of Love's future recordings at another record
company for a limited number of years. Universal also credited Love
with a few hundred thousand dollars in additional royalties. Perhaps
most important, Universal avoids testing the seven-year statute in
court.</TE>
<TE>   "This is why we need legislation," said Simon Renshaw, an artist
manager at the Firm, which handles acts such as the Dixie Chicks and
Staind. "These fights cost hundreds of thousands dollars a month. The
artist gets to a point where they say, 'I can't do this anymore. I
have to move on.' "</TE>

<HD>Fans Incensed Over Closure of Disney Club</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Firm plans to replace discount program with
a credit card. Members say it won't be the same.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Die-hard Disney fans say they are being shortchanged by the company's
decision Monday to shut down a discount club inspired by the
company's founder.</LD>
<LD>   The latest dispute between fans and Walt Disney Co.'s corporate
managers centers on the Burbank entertainment company's decision to
close the Disney Club by next year. The club, which at its peak a
year ago had half a million members, gives 10% to 20% discounts off
merchandise bought at the Disney Stores, theme park admissions, car
rentals and hotel packages at Walt Disney World and Disneyland.
Members also get privileges including a subscription to Disney
Magazine and advance screenings of movies.</LD>
<LD>   Disney said Monday it would replace the Disney Club with a
"co-branded" Disney/Visa credit card with which customers will be
able to accumulate points that can be redeemed toward discounts on
Disney merchandise and vacations. Although Disney would not comment
on the financial terms, such corporate alliances are lucrative and
important for Disney as it seeks to shore up its bottom line.</LD>
<TE>   Even so, the decision has incensed the typically passionate Disney
fans, who believe the company is relentlessly pursuing the bottom
line at their expense.</TE>
<TE>   For them, the club carries special significance because it was a
successor to the original Magic Kingdom Club, the storied group Walt
Disney created in 1958 to promote Disneyland to Southern California
businesses and their employees. And they're still smarting over
Disney's decision two years ago to shut down the Magic Kingdom Club
and replace it with a similar discount service charging a $39.95
annual subscription fee.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just one more thing they are taking away from guests," said
Arlen Miller of Orlando, noting the company's recent decision to
raise admission prices at its Walt Disney World theme parks. Although
Disney wouldn't discuss details of the planned card, customers will
get more and better services and discounts, said company spokesman
Gary Foster. Disney does not expect to charge an annual fee for the
card, which it will introduce next year. Points will be accumulated
based on general credit card purchases.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not forgotten these club members," Foster said. "We do
feel like we're developing a program that is going to be much better
than the Disney Club."</TE>
<TE>   Disney informed club members that the club will be disbanded Dec.
31 of next year. The company will stop taking memberships by year's
end.</TE>

<HD>Personal Incomes Rebound in August</HD>
<DH>Economy: Report shows a 0.4% rise. Consumer spending
increases 0.3%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. wages, salaries and other personal incomes rebounded in August,
while spending increased for a third straight month, albeit at a
slower pace than in July, according to data reported Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Despite downbeat reports recently from big retailers, many
economists say overall consumer spending should hold up in coming
months.</LD>
<LD>   Incomes rose 0.4% in August after no change in July, the Commerce
Department said. Consumer spending on goods and services rose 0.3%
after a 1% jump in July, the report said.</LD>
<TE>   Personal incomes are 3.5% higher than they were a year ago, giving
consumers the wherewithal to spend, analysts said. That's vital for a
sustainable recovery because spending accounts for two-thirds of the
economy.</TE>
<TE>   Disposable income, or the money left over after taxes, increased
0.4% in August, twice the July rise.</TE>
<TE>   The personal savings rate rose to 3.6% in August from 3.5% in
July. The figure includes current income from wages, salaries,
businesses and government payments.</TE>
<TE>   Home refinancing is providing extra spending money as homeowners
take advantage of falling mortgage rates, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Spending on durable goods such as autos and appliances rose 1.4%
in August after surging 5.2% the month before, Monday's report
showed. But spending in other areas barely grew. Spending on
nondurable goods rose 0.2% after increasing 0.3% in July; spending on
services rose 0.2% after jumping 0.6% in July.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The National Assn. for Business Economics, releasing the latest
forecast by a panel of 32 of its members, said Monday that it
expected the economy to grow by 2.4% this year and 3.2% in 2003. The
group said its forecasting panel saw little threat of a new
recession.</TE>
<TE>   "Economic growth may not be supercharged, but it is solidly
positive," said Tim O'Neill, economist at Harris Bank in Chicago and
incoming president of the group.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The House Government Reform Committee has scheduled a hearing for
Oct. 10 to examine why the Justice Department has failed to conclude
an investigation into alleged fraud surrounding the $3.2-billion sale
of Executive Life Insurance Co. in 1993, two years after it was
declared insolvent and seized by the California Insurance
commissioner.</LD>
<LD>   A few years after the deal was closed, a whistle-blower produced
documents that allegedly showed that French bank Credit Lyonnais was
the true purchaser of the Los Angeles-based insurer. At the time of
the sale, state and federal laws prohibited foreign banks from owning
insurance companies.</LD>
<LD>   The revelation sparked several lawsuits that accuse Credit
Lyonnais of hiding behind phony investors to conceal its acquisition.
The suits are seeking to recoup policyholder losses by recovering the
profit allegedly made by selling the insurer's junk bonds. State
authorities have estimated that profit was at least $2 billion.</LD>
<TE>   The whistle-blower also prompted the U.S. attorney's office in Los
Angeles to investigate and recommend charges against the bank. That
recommendation has been awaiting a Justice Department decision for
more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Justice Department said he had no comment, as
did a lawyer for Credit Lyonnais.</TE>

<HD>Winnick Involved in Deals, E-Mails Show</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Documents add pressure on Global chairman in
advance of House testimony today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Global Crossing Ltd. Chairman Gary Winnick was directly involved in a
frenzied push for sales at the telecommunications firm in 2001--a
time when the company was making questionable deals to mask its
deteriorating finances, according to documents made public Monday.</LD>
<LD>   In a series of company e-mails sent to Winnick or copied to him,
Global Crossing executives discuss ways to tap the personal influence
of Winnick and others to help the company land "big deals" in time to
meet financial targets, according to copies of the correspondence
released by the House Energy and Commerce Committee's oversight and
investigations panel.</LD>
<LD>   The disclosures put additional pressure on Winnick in advance of
his scheduled appearance today before the House subcommittee, when he
is expected for the first time to answer questions publicly about
Global Crossing's collapse.</LD>
<TE>   The evidence appears to contradict his attorney's contention that
Winnick was not involved in the company's controversial "swap" deals
because he was not a hands-on chairman.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on what we've uncovered to date, there are going to be a
lot of tough questions for Mr. Winnick about using these questionable
capacity swaps to meet Wall Street expectations," said Rep. James C.
Greenwood (R-Pa.), who will chair the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing operates a worldwide fiber-optic network, built
with billions in bank debt and funds raised in stock and debt
offerings on Wall Street. Dragged down by its crippling debt amid an
industrywide slump, the company filed for bankruptcy protection Jan.
28.</TE>
<TE>   For months, Winnick has resisted participating in a public hearing
involving Global Crossing, citing ongoing investigations by the
Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission into
his stock sales and possible wrongdoing at the company.</TE>
<TE>   His appearance today was made mandatory by a subpoena, and it was
widely assumed that Winnick would decline to testify by asserting his
5th Amendment right against self-incrimination. Sources said Winnick
had struggled with his attorney's advice not to testify and
ultimately decided to answer questions at the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Tagliarino, a spokesman for Winnick, confirmed that the
chairman intends to testify. He declined to discuss the issues raised
by the e-mails.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Global Crossing also declined to discuss the
specifics of the documents released Monday, but said that the
committee is publicizing "selected documentation" and that the deals
discussed should be viewed in context to better understand their
meaning. The same information was provided to the SEC and other
investigators, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   In a June 11, 2001, e-mail, Winnick recounts a recent conversation
with Enron Corp.'s then-Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling about
forging a deal between the two firms. That deal was never completed.</TE>
<TE>   One e-mail, marked "URGENT" and dated Aug. 18, 2001, from the
former president of carrier sales, Patrick Joggerst, underscores the
personal involvement of the company's top executives: "Gary Winnick,
[former CEO] Tom Casey and [former President] David Walsh have asked
carrier sales and corporate development to work together to come up
with creative deals that we can tee up for 3rd and 4th quarter this
year."</TE>
<TE>   A memo from June 5, 2000, by then-CEO Leo Hindery to Winnick,
Casey and Co-Vice Chairman Lodwrick Cook bluntly warns that Global
Crossing is destined to fail because of overcapacity and too many
companies chasing the same customers.</TE>
<TE>   "The stock market can be fooled, but not forever," Hindery said in
the memo. He urges the executives to consider selling several units,
boost the company's image and then sell the firm to the highest
bidder.</TE>
<TE>   "Hindery was telling the big three--Winnick, Casey and Cook--that
the gig is about up, and they'd better get out while the getting is
good," said Ken Johnson, spokesman for the House committee.</TE>
<TE>   That memo could represent the first evidence that the top
executives might have known as far back as mid-2000 that the company
was on the way down. That would call into question stock sales dating
to the last half of 2000, not just those in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick will appear alongside several current and former Global
Crossing executives, including Walsh; Chief Financial Officer Dan
Cohrs; Joseph Perrone, executive vice president for finance; and
former general counsel James Gorton.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick, who has personified the company since its founding in
1997, was the firm's largest shareholder and one of its biggest
beneficiaries through salaries, bonuses, consulting fees and the sale
of more than $600 million in Global Crossing stock over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators suspect that Winnick and others knew that the
company was on the verge of failing when they sold company stock in
early and mid-2001, and also knew that the firm's condition was not
yet known by the public or other shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   At least seven directors and officers sold shares from March to
May of that year, but Winnick's sale has been in the spotlight
because of its size: He sold nearly 10 million shares worth about
$124 million on May 23, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Employee e-mails and testimony indicate that Winnick's last stock
sale came after top executives had begun warning internally that
Global Crossing's deepening financial crisis might trigger a default
on key bank agreements--an event that could have accelerated the
company's bankruptcy filing by six months.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick's attorney repeatedly has said the chairman's stock trade
was legal and proper. He and others also have asserted that Winnick
was not involved in day-to-day operations at Global Crossing and thus
didn't know inside information about the company's worsening
condition when he sold the stock.</TE>
<TE>   To former employees at Global Crossing, the idea is laughable.</TE>
<TE>   Interviews with current and former employees paint a picture of a
man who involved himself in almost everything, even the tiniest
details.</TE>
<TE>   They said Winnick personally managed every aspect of an elaborate
renovation of the company's Beverly Hills offices, picking out light
fixtures and paint colors. He made changes to the cafeteria menu,
ordered flowers replaced, chose the color of the company's logo and
the font to be used on its letterhead and other documents.</TE>
<TE>   The company paid Winnick a handsome annual salary and periodic
bonuses, an unusual move if the chairman was not involved in the
company's operations.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the last year for which figures are available, Global
Crossing paid Winnick $785,833 in salary, plus a $1-million bonus and
$55,635 in other compensation. In 1999, he collected a $169,615
salary and a $850,000 bonus.</TE>

<HD>Neil Portnow Named Grammy President</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Veteran record executive Neil Portnow has spent the last few years
persuading Hollywood studios to hire his company to provide music for
their films. Now he's about to become familiar with a whole new kind
of drama.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, Portnow was named president of the Grammy organization,
the Santa Monica-based nonprofit that has been engulfed in
controversy for years. Portnow, 53, according to people who have
worked with him, is a low key diplomat who will probably remain
firmly behind the scenes and offer a drastically different management
style than his predecessor, C. Michael Greene, who resigned earlier
this year amid misconduct allegations.</LD>
<LD>   Portnow, formerly chief of West Coast operations for Zomba Group,
declined to spell out his plans for the National Academy of Recording
Arts &amp; Sciences, as the Grammy organization is officially known. He
is expected to officially start his new job in the next few weeks.
But Portnow said Monday that, "to have this opportunity, at this
time, to be more a part of the good work the academy does, is a real
privilege and honor for me."</LD>
<TE>   Greene abruptly resigned from the organization in April, after the
organization's chairman, Garth Fundis, called an emergency board
meeting to review allegations of sexual harassment against the
controversial Grammy chief.</TE>
<TE>   Fundis said Monday that "Neil comes to us with superb credentials
and a unique skill set that perfectly matches what we were looking
for in a new president."</TE>
<TE>   Portnow has served as a volunteer executive in the Grammy
organization for two decades, and most recently worked for two years
as treasurer and secretary of the Grammy's national board of
trustees.</TE>
<TE>   Portnow has yet to finalize a contract with the organization, but
is expected to receive a maximum of about $750,000 in salary and
bonuses as Grammy chief--less than half of Greene's controversial
compensation package, sources said. Portnow also is open to departing
from Greene's custom of appearing on the Grammy telecast to tell
viewers about piracy or other industry issues. Portnow may either
forgo the traditional speech or tap a recording artist to make the
presentation, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Music industry figures who know Portnow, also say he will probably
bring a more decentralized approach than Greene, who was often
criticized internally for his autocratic style.</TE>
<TE>   "He is very liberal in his ideas and trusts people around him, and
he is open to listening a lot more," said Jeff Blue, a senior talent
scout at Warner Bros. Records, who broke into the business signing
artists for Portnow at Zomba. "That's the type of leadership the
Grammys need. I think it was much more rigid before."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say Portnow is well-suited to handle the various tasks
of running the unique organization, including fund-raising and
maneuvering record-label politics.</TE>
<TE>   "Neil is an exceptional leader. He will bring passion, commitment
and integrity to the job," said Zach Horowitz, president of Universal
Music Group, the world's biggest record company.</TE>
<TE>   Born in New York, Portnow broke into the record industry as a
guitarist, then became a music producer. He has worked as a talent
scout for RCA Records and Arista Records, and spent the last 14 years
working for Zomba Group, the independent music giant that is being
acquired by German conglomerate Bertelsmann. As chief of West Coast
operations, Portnow has tried to develop a "one-stop shop" for
television and film producers in search of compositions, soundtrack
material and other music services. Most recently, the approach has
been adopted by the producers of such films as "Jimmy Neutron: Boy
Genius."</TE>
<TE>   Portnow comes to the organization at a time when the future of
several high-profile ventures is in doubt. For example, the start-up
Latin Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, an offshoot launched by
Greene, turned in such a dismal ratings performance for its broadcast
on CBS two weeks ago that executives are uncertain whether it will
return to television.</TE>
<TE>   "An academy is a place that strives for excellence," Portnow said.
"And for people to want to belong to an academy, the level of
professionalism and good work needs to be there. That's what we need
to be."</TE>

<HD>Infogrames to Cut Jobs, Close Sites, Sources Say</HD>

<LD>Infogrames Entertainment will slash two-thirds of its staff in France
in an effort to stem wider than expected losses, sources at the
company said. The Lyon, France-based video game publisher also will
close two of its seven European studios in the next few months,
sources said.</LD>
<LD>   An Infogrames spokeswoman confirmed a "restructuring in Europe,
primarily in France," but declined to comment on the number of jobs
affected, citing French labor laws.</LD>
<LD>   The company employs 692 workers in Europe, 410 of them in France.
Sources said the company will cut 280 jobs in France, plus an
undetermined number elsewhere in Europe. No layoffs are expected at
its U.S. operations, which employ 778.</LD>
<TE>   Infogrames last week posted net losses of $78 million on $758.5
million in revenue for its fiscal year ended June 30. Losses from
operations were $33 million, more than three times analyst
projections of $10 million. Much of the red ink came from its
European operations. Its U.S. business, Infogrames Inc., contributed
$419 million in sales, an operating income of $1 million and a net
loss of $10.9 million in fiscal 2002.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. branch, regarded as the healthier portion of the company,
ended its fiscal year with just $6 million in cash. The company is
counting on the holiday season to improve its cash flow, with
releases such as "Superman" and "Unreal Tournament 2003" expected to
do well.</TE>
<TE>   Infogrames, which borrowed heavily to break into the U.S. market
in the last three years, faces pressure from creditors to pay back
two convertible bonds worth $400 million by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Infogrames' U.S. subsidiary fell 3 cents to $2.22 on
Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>9 IPOs Last Quarter-- the Fewest Since 1977</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. companies are going public at the slowest pace in a quarter
century.</LD>
<LD>   Just nine companies completed initial public stock offerings in
the third quarter, according to data tracker Thomson Financial in New
York. Dozens more canceled sales as the plummeting stock market
sapped demand.</LD>
<LD>   The number of deals in the quarter was the fewest for any quarter
since 1977, said Jay Ritter, a University of Florida professor who
tracks IPO history.</LD>
<TE>   The IPO market has collapsed as the long bear market has worn on
and investors have lost their appetite for risky new shares. Scandal
has tainted the market amid allegations that brokerages in the late
1990s used hot IPO shares to woo additional underwriting business
from corporate executives.</TE>
<TE>   In the heyday of technology IPOs, more than 100 companies were
going public each quarter. For example, the fourth quarter of 1999
saw 152 companies sell IPOs, raising a total of $24 billion,
according to Thomson Financial. Last quarter's deals raised $5.5
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Companies that went public last quarter generally sold their
shares for less than they expected. Finance company CIT Group, for
example, sliced its offering by a third before finding willing
buyers.</TE>
<TE>   Kirkland's Inc., a retailer of home decorating items, also raised
a third less capital than planned.</TE>
<TE>   LeapFrog Enterprises Inc. was the last company to go public. The
maker of educational toys, which is backed by Michael Milken and
Larry Ellison, sold shares July 24. The stock was sold at $13, the
low end of the company's expected range of $13 to $16. The shares
have risen since the offering, closing at $18.90 on the New York
Stock Exchange on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Kirkland's stock has risen to $17.10 from the IPO price of $15.
But CIT shares have fallen to $17.98 from their IPO price of $23.</TE>
<TE>   The immediate outlook remains bleak for most companies planning
IPOs, bankers said. "We do not expect a dramatic turnaround soon,"
said Stuart Bernstein, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.'s co-head of equity
capital markets for the Americas.</TE>
<TE>   Among firms that may try to sell shares is DoveBid Inc., which
organizes online auctions. DoveBid may try to go public this week.</TE>
<TE>   Cinema chains Loews Cineplex Entertainment Corp. and Cinemark may
try to sell shares in the fourth quarter. Cinemark postponed its
offering in July and hasn't rescheduled a date. Platinum Underwriters
Holdings Ltd., the reinsurance unit of St. Paul Cos., may try to
resurrect its offering, which was scrapped in July.</TE>

<HD>Liquid Audio Sells Patents to Microsoft</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Potentially bolstering its appeal to entertainment companies,
Microsoft Corp. has acquired patents from Liquid Audio Inc. covering
the secure delivery of digital movies, music and other media through
the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   Redwood City, Calif.-based Liquid Audio, which announced the pact
Monday, will receive $7 million and a license to keep using the
technologies covered by the patents, the company said.</LD>
<LD>   Microsoft already is a leading provider of digital rights
management technology for downloadable music from the major record
companies, with Liquid a top competitor. "The rights that we've
acquired today we view as being important to efforts down the road
with regard to DRM technologies," spokesman Jon Murchinson said.</LD>
<TE>   The software powerhouse is embroiled in a patent fight with
InterTrust Technologies Corp. of Santa Clara, Calif., which says that
Microsoft's latest operating system and numerous other products
infringe its security and rights management technologies. Talal
Shamoon, an InterTrust senior vice president, said Liquid Audio's
patents won't have any effect on the dispute. Murchinson declined to
comment on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Digital rights management software is a key tool in the emerging
business of delivering songs, movies, books and games electronically.
The software enables companies to place rules for how a digital file
may be used, such as letting consumers play a song twice for free
before requiring them to buy or discard it.</TE>
<TE>   Although Liquid Audio has struggled to sell its vision of digital
delivery to the major record companies, the company's patents cover
at least two technologies that are particularly significant to
distributing entertainment online.</TE>
<TE>   One protects identifying information hidden on a watermark within
a file, even if the file is compressed. Microsoft officials have been
skeptical about the effectiveness of watermarks, but Hollywood
studios are eager to see them deployed to help fight piracy.</TE>
<TE>   The other enables online distributors to limit the countries or
territories where their files can be delivered. These restrictions
are critical to the music and movie industries' business models, in
which the rights to songs and films are parceled out on different
terms to partners around the world.</TE>
<TE>   The deal comes as Liquid Audio is being acquired by Alliance
Entertainment Corp. of Coral Springs, Fla., a leading distributor of
CDs, DVDs, videotapes and games. Dissident Liquid shareholders are
trying to block the transaction and liquidate the company, but
company officials say they expect the sale to be completed by the end
of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Liquid Audio Chief Executive Gerald W. Kearby said his company
"will be concentrating on the distribution aspect of our business
rather than the technology aspect" after the merger, so it made sense
to "get out of the tech game and concentrate our engineering on
distribution."</TE>

<HD>Losses Continue as Quarter Ends</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Pessimistic forecasts send investors fleeing.
The Dow's close at 7,591.93 is its lowest since August 1998.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks ended the third quarter with a thud Monday as major indexes
closed out their worst quarterly performance since 1987. Investors
ran for cover after reduced retail sales forecasts and weak
manufacturing data fanned fears about corporate profits.</LD>
<LD>   The selling, especially intense in the first hour of trading,
helped drive major European indexes to multiyear lows.</LD>
<LD>   "People are tremendously disillusioned with the current news, and
they don't see any real catalyst" for higher stock prices, said
Philip Dow, director of equity strategy at RBC Dain Rauscher. "It's a
very difficult time."</LD>
<TE>   How bad is it? The Wilshire 5,000 total market index, the broadest
measure of the U.S. stock market, fell 17% in the July-to-September
quarter, erasing about $1.9 trillion in market value, according to
Wilshire Associates, which calculates the market gauge. That
represents about $7,000 for each U.S. citizen.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average, off 240 points in the
early going, closed down 109.52 points, or 1.4%, at 7,591.93. The
loss came on the heels of Friday's 295-point swoon and marked the
Dow's lowest close since August 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index slid 27.10 points, or 2.3%,
to 1,172.06--its lowest close since September 1996. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 index fell 12.09 points, or 1.5%, to 815.28. The S&amp;P 500
remains above the multiyear low of 797.70 it reached July 23.</TE>
<TE>   Losers beat winners by 6 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange and
on Nasdaq in active trading.</TE>
<TE>   September has been the worst month for stock performance over the
last half century, and it lived up to that reputation this year. For
the month, the Dow sank more than 12%, Nasdaq fell almost 11% and the
S&amp;P 500 slid 11%--its biggest one-month decline since tumbling 14.6%
in August 1998.</TE>
<TE>   For the quarter, the Dow lost 17.9%, Nasdaq 20% and the S&amp;P 17.6%.
It was the biggest quarterly decline for the Dow and the S&amp;P since
the fourth quarter of 1987, when the stock market suffered its last
major crash.</TE>
<TE>   "The real problem is sentiment," said Brian Pears, head of equity
trading at Victory Capital Management. "With every earnings cut and
every soft economic number ... people are starting to price in a
worst-case scenario. People are getting nervous."</TE>
<TE>   An already sluggish climate took a turn for the worse when major
retailers scaled back sales forecasts Monday. Wal-Mart Stores, the
world's biggest retailer, fell $2 to $49.24 after ratcheting back its
September sales forecast.</TE>
<TE>   And after the market closed, Target, another major discount
retailer, said its September sales would fall short of forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the government reported that growth in consumer
spending and personal income fell short of expectations in August.
And the Purchasing Management Assn. of Chicago reported that its
index of area business activity fell to 48.1 in September. A reading
below 50 indicates that business is contracting; this was the first
such reading in seven months.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago index is considered an indicator of the national
purchasing managers report, to be issued Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The labor dispute at the Los Angeles port also is a potential
threat to the U.S. economy if it isn't resolved quickly, analysts
said.</TE>
<TE>   The news of economic weakness and falling stock prices once again
drove investors to the haven of Treasury securities. The yield on the
benchmark 10-year Treasury note slipped to 3.6% from Friday's close
of 3.66%. Gold, another haven from volatile markets, rebounded from
recent losses, gaining $4.20 to $323.90 an ounce in New York trading.</TE>
<TE>   In Europe, the sell-off was broadly based--only 35 of 300
top-listed companies managed a gain.</TE>
<TE>   Key indexes fell 4.8% in Britain, 5.9% in France and 5.1% in
Germany. The FTSE Eurotop 300 index closed down 4.8%. The index lost
14.5% in the third quarter and is down 46.7% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Insurers and banks were the worst hit among European firms on
concern about the crumbling value of their stock portfolios.</TE>
<TE>   In Japan, stocks fell 2% in early trading today.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Intel dropped 73 cents to $13.89. The chip-making giant's chief
executive again said a turnaround in the computer industry would not
come until corporate profits rebound. The SOX index of semiconductor
stocks lost 3.4%.</TE>
<TE>   * Other technology heavyweights also slumped. Cisco Systems fell
75 cents to $10.48, Microsoft dropped $1.51 to $43.74, and Oracle
lost 54 cents to $7.86.</TE>
<TE>   * McDonald's fell 71 cents to $17.66. Moody's Investors Service
cut its outlook for the company's debt to "negative" from "stable,"
saying McDonald's earnings may fall as competition rises.</TE>

<HD>Role of Peregrine Exec in Question</HD>
<DH>Probe: John Moores was on watch when irregular accounting
practices began that led the software firm to seek bankruptcy
protection.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER and RALPH FRAMMOLINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Peregrine Systems Inc. ousted its top management amid an
accounting scandal in May, the San Diego software company turned to
the man who built it from a tiny firm to a $13-billion enterprise:
John J. Moores.</LD>
<LD>   The multimillionaire owner of the San Diego Padres baseball team
seemed like a natural choice. A self-described computer nerd, he had
served on the board for 13 years, including a decade-long stint as
chairman. Moores took the company public after buying a controlling
stake and personally co-signed on corporate loans.</LD>
<LD>   But now that the company has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection; been accused of "possible fraud" by one of its former
auditors, KPMG; received a subpoena from the Justice Department and
also faces an investigation by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the choice of tapping Moores as corporate savior raises a
critical question: Is the man brought in to help clean up Peregrine
partly responsible for the mess?</LD>
<TE>   The company's records show that the questionable accounting that
landed Peregrine in federal Bankruptcy Court last week started on
Moores' watch. Peregrine is restating its finances from April 1999
through December 2001 and says revenue may have been inflated by as
much as $250 million.</TE>
<TE>   For 16 of those 33 months, Moores was chairman of the company.
Over that span, he sold nearly $371 million in Peregrine stock. All
told, Moores and entities affiliated with him have sold nearly $611
million in Peregrine shares, reducing their stake in the company from
62.5% at the time of its public offering in 1997 to about 3% today.</TE>
<TE>   The stock, which peaked at more than $80 a share in 2000, closed
Monday at 6 cents in over-the-counter trading.</TE>
<TE>   Citing pending litigation, Moores declined to discuss his current
or previous tenure as Peregrine's chairman, or the allegations of
fraud at the company. Peregrine officials say that its board, which
typically met once a quarter, had no idea about the company's
financial troubles.</TE>
<TE>   A recent internal investigation, led by law firm Latham &amp; Watkins
and the accounting forensic team of PricewaterhouseCoopers, found
"that the outside directors were in the dark about the accounting
improprieties," said Meryl Young, a Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher attorney
who is representing Peregrine and its outside board members in a
series of lawsuits filed by shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Peregrine has sued former auditor Arthur Andersen for not catching
the accounting shenanigans sooner and alerting the board. When Moores
and other board members were finally told of the problems last April,
"they immediately did all the right things," Young added. "They're
fulfilling their job now."</TE>
<TE>   But the shareholder lawsuits paint a picture of a company
where, at the very least, Moores ignored his responsibilities as chairman.
And some critics are incredulous that Moores is being positioned
today as the one who can resurrect Peregrine.</TE>
<TE>   "Moores wouldn't know what a white horse looks like, let alone do
what it takes to be a company's savior," said Bert Hochfeld, managing
director at Montauk Capital Markets Group and a former employee who
resigned from BMC Software Inc., a Houston company that Moores
started in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   For Moores, the stakes are huge.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the 40 lawsuits filed against Peregrine name Moores as
a defendant. One of San Diego's most well-known--and
controversial--citizens, the 58-year-old Moores is a generous
philanthropist and also serves as chairman of the UC Board of
Regents. As chairman of the Padres, he found himself at the center of
a political corruption scandal involving the team's new downtown
sports stadium; he was cleared in the case, though a city
councilwoman who received gifts from Moores was forced to resign and
pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of not reporting the items.</TE>
<TE>   If Moores is implicated in the scandals at Peregrine,
shareholders' lawyers conceivably could go after his personal assets.
San Diego attorney Jeffrey Krinsk said he intends to ask a federal
judge this month to put Moores' holdings, including the Padres, into
a "constructive trust," which does not freeze a person's assets but
pools them together to ensure that they are not drained.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that he sat late at night with his cohorts by a dim
lamp and mapped out a way to convert shareholder money to his
benefit," Krinsk said. Nonetheless, Krinsk maintains that Moores may
be liable because he failed to recognize the accounting problems.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, current and former employees--many of whom refuse
to speak on the record for fear of being sued by Peregrine--tell of a
corporate culture that pushed the rules. The company's financial
statements, these employees said, were built in part on an unorthodox
accounting procedure known as "burn." Burning is the practice of
booking sales months before they close, and often for far more cash
than they actually bring in, to help a company hit its quarterly
revenue target.</TE>
<TE>   "This was common and openly discussed in the management ranks,"
said a former regional sales director. "I remember being at an
executive meeting at Peregrine's headquarters and my boss telling me,
'When I walked into this job, I inherited $80 million in burn.' When
you're that far behind before you even start, you cannot succeed.
This was a house of cards waiting to blow up."</TE>
<TE>   For the company's detractors, there are only two possibilities:
Either Moores knew what was going on and didn't stop things, or he
was so out of touch that he didn't see the abuses occurring right
down the street from his venture capital firm on High Bluff Drive.</TE>
<TE>   Moores has deep roots in the business-software industry. After
working in his 20s and 30s as a programmer at IBM Corp. and Shell Oil
Co., Moores co-founded BMC with less than $1,000 in savings. More
than a decade later, the Houston-based company was worth billions and
had gone public--a deal led by Moores and Charles Noell III, who now
serves on Peregrine's board of directors. Moores sold his stake in
BMC in 1992 for about $400 million.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Moores and his venture-capital firm JMI Equity
bought a controlling interest in Peregrine. Its future seemed bright.
The Internet boom was just beginning and demand for the company's
products was high.</TE>
<TE>   Employees recount stories of Moores, when he still lived
in Houston, stopping into Peregrine's San Diego-area offices and
offering to take a number of workers to lunch on his personal jet.
"The people who came back said they couldn't believe that even the
faucets in the bathroom were gold," recalled one former employee.</TE>
<TE>   Moores was no less generous to his adopted hometown, showering
millions on charities and cancer research. "He came in like a mafia
don, spreading money around," said former state Senate President Jim
Mills, a close observer of the local scene.</TE>
<TE>   Peregrine's core business focused on making software to help
corporations manage their sales and marketing teams. Later, its
product lineup included software that, among other things, tracks
computer downtime and manages real estate.</TE>
<TE>   The company went public in April 1997 at $9 a share, and the stock
price rose steadily to more than $45 the following year. Six months
after the IPO, Moores began selling chunks of stock. A spokeswoman
for both Moores and JMI said the stock sales were steady and
automated, with the amounts falling within federally regulated
limits. Peregrine and JMI officials say it was only logical for
Moores to shed his stock. After building Peregrine, they said, any
smart venture capitalist would want to cash out the investment.</TE>
<TE>   One shareholder lawsuit, which examined SEC filings, lays out a
different scenario. It alleges that Moores knew Peregrine was
misstating its revenue and earnings--and that he picked up the pace
of his stock sales during his last 16 months as chairman, when the
questionable accounting practices occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Moores stepped down as chairman in July 2000, making way for Chief
Executive Stephen P. Gardner to assume the post.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, the company continued to "burn," and the domino
effect of pre-booking sales seemed to grow more intense over time.</TE>
<TE>   "When I went to Peregrine, there were comments that there was so
much software out there that has to be burned," said former employee
Roger Justice, who joined Peregrine's offices in Bethesda, Md., in
2001.</TE>
<TE>   When Justice attended a sales training seminar at the company's
San Diego headquarters last February, he said, he was startled to
hear a colleague mention that he would have to make sure that one of
his accounts burned $20 million of pre-sold software before he would
see a nickel of commission.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the first time I said, 'Something ain't right here' in
my own mind," said Justice, who left the company at the end of that
month as part of one of Peregrine's many rounds of layoffs.</TE>
<TE>   In one deal, described in an e-mail from a Peregrine employee
obtained by The Times, the company prematurely booked the sale of a
software and services contract with Citigroup Inc.'s Global
Technology Infrastructure Group in Tampa, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup had committed "in principle" to making the acquisition,
but contract negotiations were "still several months away from
completion," according to the e-mail. Peregrine, however, booked the
deal in September 2000 after it got a nonbinding letter of
acquisition from Citigroup. The actual sale wasn't completed until
the following quarter--in December 2000. Citigroup acknowledged the
deal but declined further comment.</TE>
<TE>   Charles La Bella, a former federal prosecutor who is now
Peregrine's senior counsel, said the burn practices were discovered
and detailed in the Latham &amp; Watkins internal investigation earlier
this year. "It was a topic that was addressed," La Bella said. "We
turned over our results" to the SEC and the Department of Justice.</TE>
<TE>   About the same time, Peregrine fired Gardner and its chief
financial officer. Moores retook the post of chairman. Gary
Greenfield, formerly president and CEO of e-business development
company Merant, replaced Gardner as CEO.</TE>
<TE>   One of the first things Greenfield did was call the staff
together. Things would get better, he promised. Moores was back.</TE>

<HD>Music Distributors, Retailers to Settle Price-Fixing Case</HD>
<DH>Antitrust: Agreement with states includes refunds for
consumers and CDs for libraries, schools and hospitals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The five largest music companies and several retailers have agreed to
pay $143 million in cash and CDs to resolve long-standing allegations
of price fixing.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement, announced Monday, ends more than two years of
legal wrangling between major record labels, three retailers and
state attorneys general nationwide over the industry's "minimum
advertised pricing" practice, which prosecutors alleged violated
antitrust laws and illegally inflated the cost of CDs.</LD>
<LD>   As part of the settlement, the retailers and record labels refused
to admit wrongdoing, but agreed to pay $67.4 million to be refunded
to consumers and send states $75 million worth of compact discs for
use in libraries, public schools and hospitals.</LD>
<TE>   California officials on Monday were figuring out how best to
refund the state's share--$6 million--to consumers and distribute
nearly $9 million worth of CDs to public schools and libraries. While
the details are being worked out, distributing cash refunds might
become too unwieldy, said Sandra Michioku, a spokeswoman for
California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is to get the refunds to as many people as possible for
the amount they were overcharged," Michioku said. "But if there is a
huge flood of claims, and California consumers would only get a very
small amount, like $1, then we might have to do something that would
provide a greater public benefit" such as sponsoring a free concert.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement amounts were determined by market share. According
to court records, Vivendi Universal's Universal Music Group, the
largest music distributor, must pay the most--$40.6 million in cash
and CDs. AOL Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Music Group agreed to pay
$29.4 million in cash and CDs; Sony Music $27.2 million; Bertelsmann
$27.8 million; and EMI Group's EMI Music $15 million.</TE>
<TE>   The retailers--Musicland Stores Inc., Trans World Entertainment
Corp. and Tower Records--must pay a combined $3 million, according to
court records.</TE>
<TE>   The pricing practice at the center of the dispute began nearly a
decade ago, when big-box retailers including Best Buy and Circuit
City began offering cheaper CDs to attract customers, siphoning
business from smaller retailers including Musicland Stores' Sam
Goody, Trans World Entertainment's Spec's Music and Tower Records. At
the time, the retailers who felt they were being undercut asked the
major record labels for help. The labels agreed to cover a portion of
the retailers' advertising costs if the stores sold CDs at a
"suggested" retail price.</TE>
<TE>   But the agreements soon led to allegations of price fixing.</TE>
<TE>   The music companies abandoned the practice two years ago to end a
separate investigation by the Federal Trade Commission.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The state action--lead by New York's and Florida's attorneys
general--sought to win a refund for consumers who bought a music CD
from 1995 to Dec. 22, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   After struggling with how best to reach scores of consumers who
might not have kept sales receipts, prosecutors took a different
tack: They pressed the music companies to provide the bulk of the
award in music CDs for public facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "We think this is a way to benefit the entire class," New York
Assistant Atty. Gen. Linda Gargiulo said.</TE>
<TE>   The music companies and retailers have denied any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Said Universal Music Group: "We believe our policies were
pro-competitive and geared toward keeping more retailers, large and
small, in business."</TE>

<HD>Qwest President in E-Mail: 'I Will Take the Fall' for Deal</HD>
<DH>Telecom: House panel is puzzled by the message he sent to
another executive in 2000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The president of Qwest Communications International Inc. agreed to
"take the fall" for a potentially risky deal the company pushed to
finalize in June 2000 in order to meet Wall Street expectations,
according to documents released Monday by congressional
investigators.</LD>
<LD>   In one puzzling e-mail exchange, Qwest President Afshin Mohebbi in
the second quarter of 2000 suggested misrouting a contract for
telecommunications capacity and then routing it as intended because
the deal was needed since others were falling through.</LD>
<LD>   "I know it is risky. I will take the fall for it!" Mohebbi said in
response to a June 13, 2000, e-mail from Qwest Executive Vice
President David Boast. "If we could do this (which I'm not sure we
can), then all we have to do is get audited, get caught and get
screwed!"</LD>
<TE>   "We're not sure what it means, but it sure seems shaky," said Ken
Johnson, a spokesman for the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee
said. "You can sense the desperation to do a deal."</TE>
<TE>   The release of the documents come a day before Mohebbi is slated
to testify before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
investigations.</TE>
<TE>   The panel is probing whether Qwest Communications and Global
Crossing Ltd. used network capacity swaps to artificially inflate
profits.</TE>

<HD>Retailers See September Declines</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major retailers scaled back sales forecasts Monday as consumers
fretting about job losses and a disastrous stock market stayed away
from stores in increasing numbers.</LD>
<LD>   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ratcheted back its September sales forecast,
the third month in a row that the world's biggest retailer has been
hurt by the shaky economy and consumer insecurity.</LD>
<LD>   The speed and extent of the decline in Wal-Mart's expected sales
growth--3% to 4% at stores open at least a year from estimates of 4%
to 6% at the start of the month--has provided some of the strongest
evidence yet that consumer spending, which has kept the anemic
economy aloft, may finally be foundering.</LD>
<TE>   "This is in line with our view that the consumer continues to be
cautious. The West Coast dockworkers situation adds additional risk
to the fall and Christmas season unless it's resolved quickly," said
Todd Slater, an analyst with Lazard.</TE>
<TE>   The Bentonville, Ark., discounter's dim outlook was echoed by
other major retailers, including department store heavyweight
Federated Stores Inc., which said its sales could be flat compared
with earlier expectations of 3% to 5% growth.</TE>
<TE>   Target Corp., the second-largest U.S. discount chain, said sales
last week at stores open at least a year were "well below" the
company's plan for all of its chains. The retailer had forecast a
monthly same-store sales increase of 3% to 5% at its Target stores
and slightly lower for the overall company.</TE>
<TE>   September same-store sales will be slightly less than year-earlier
levels as consumers curtailed spending on men's and children's
clothing, it said.</TE>
<TE>   J.C. Penney Co. also said same-store sales at its department
stores in September were tracking below expectations with a decline
in the low single digits on a percentage basis, compared with its
previous forecast for same-store sales that were flat to up slightly.</TE>
<TE>   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Wal-Mart shares fell $2
to $49.24, and Target shares dropped $2.39 to $29.52. J.C. Penney
shares slid $1.68 to $15.92 and Federated fell $1.73 to $29.44.</TE>
<TE>   "The economic downturn's impact on consumers has been lagging and
we're finally seeing them hit home," said Frank Badillo, a senior
economist with Retail Forward. A falloff in gas prices late last
year, mortgage refinancing, tax rebates and tax cuts are among the
factors that helped blunt the initial effect of the downturn, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart said its earlier sales forecast was based on "too
optimistic" assumptions about the amount of business lost in the
post-Sept. 11 period last year.</TE>
<TE>   September was supposed to be a profitable month for retailers
because last year's attacks kept shoppers away, making for easy
year-ago comparisons. Wal-Mart was one of a few retailers with strong
year-ago figures to match, because consumers stocked up on
necessities such as groceries and eschewed discretionary spending.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Wal-Mart said its quarterly earnings would match Wall
Street estimates for a jump of more than 20%, ranging from 40 to 41
cents per share for the third quarter.</TE>

<HD>Fidelity Investments to Cut 5% of Work Force</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fidelity Investments said it will eliminate 1,695 jobs, or 5.4% of
its work force, after 2 1/2 years of falling stock prices thinned
assets under management at the mutual fund company.</LD>
<LD>   The job cuts come after last October's announcement that the
company would trim 760 jobs, or 2.3%, of the work force.</LD>
<LD>   Fidelity spokeswoman Anne Crowley said the cuts will be felt in
most of the business units of the closely held Boston-based company,
which has more than 31,000 workers. No fund managers or analysts will
lose their jobs, she said.</LD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Napster Inc.'s unsecured creditors sued German media powerhouse
Bertelsmann, alleging that it mischaracterized its equity investments
in the defunct music-swapping site as loans.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed Friday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware,
also says Bertelsmann's claims shouldn't be given priority over other
creditors. Redwood City, Calif.-based Napster filed for bankruptcy
protection in June.A bankruptcy judge blocked Napster's sale to
Bertelsmann on Sept. 3 after ruling that conflicts of interest by
Napster chief executive had tainted the transaction.</LD>
<LD>   The suit says the designation of Bertelsmann's investments as
loans was fiction and "there was never any expectation that these
moneys would be repaid."</LD>
<TE>   Bertelsmann spokeswoman Paula Batson said the company has no
comment.</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Labor Department filed a court brief that says Enron Corp.
executives could be personally liable for retirement plan losses by
workers who are suing the company.</LD>
<LD>   The Labor Department's friend-of-the-court brief, filed in federal
court in Houston, says if executives continue to offer company stock
as an investment option in its retirement plan with knowledge of
Enron's problems, "They are personally liable for the losses."</LD>
<LD>   The filing details the government's position on employers'
responsibilities to company-sponsored 401(k) plans and for the first
time outlines its position on the Enron case.</LD>
<TE>   Many workers lost retirement savings that were heavily invested in
Enron stock as the price steadily declined last year. Overall, the
20,795 participants in Enron's 401(k) plan had about 63% of their
assets invested in company stock.</TE>
<TE>   The court brief was written in opposition to motions filed by
former Chief Executive Kenneth L. Lay and others to dismiss the
lawsuit.</TE>

<HD>Executives Sued for IPO Profits</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Spitzer charges five, including Anschutz and
Ebbers, with giving underwriting business to a brokerage in return
for hot stocks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Five telecom industry executives, including Los Angeles sports mogul
Philip F. Anschutz and former WorldCom Inc. chief Bernard J. Ebbers,
were sued Monday by New York state on charges that they steered
business to a big Wall Street brokerage in exchange for hot stock
offerings.</LD>
<LD>   The civil suit by New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer alleges that
the men directed corporate finance work for their firms to Salomon
Smith Barney, the brokerage arm of Citigroup Inc., in return for
sweetheart deals on initial public stock offerings in recent years.</LD>
<LD>   Wall Street's practice of personally rewarding executives with
coveted IPOs is known as "spinning" and is the subject of several
probes by state and federal regulators. Spitzer is the first
regulator to formally bring charges.</LD>
<TE>   The complaint seeks the disgorgement of $28 million in spinning
profits made when the executives sold their IPO shares.</TE>
<TE>   The suit also seeks disgorgement of an additional $1.5 billion the
executives reaped by selling shares of their own firms. Spitzer
alleges that those gains were ill-gotten because Salomon analysts
touted the companies' shares to the public as part of the scheme.</TE>
<TE>   The other executives named are Joseph Nacchio, former chief
executive of Qwest Communications International Inc.; Stephen
Garofalo, chairman of Metromedia Fiber Networks Inc.; and Clark
McLeod, former CEO of McLeod USA Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Some legal analysts said the allegations may be difficult to
prove, and that Spitzer may be more interested in using the evidence
to press his broad conflict-of-interest investigation against
Salomon.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said the executives violated securities laws. "The CEO was
personally bought off by being given IPO allocations," he said at a
news conference. "It was wrong. It shouldn't have happened."</TE>
<TE>   The men were charged with fraud, failure to disclose financial
dealings and personal enrichment at the expense of their firms. The
suit seeks disgorgement of the gains to the companies.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for Ebbers and Nacchio denied the charges.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Macey, a Cornell University securities-law professor,
said Spitzer's case is on firm legal ground. "It seems there was an
expectation of a quid pro quo," Macey said. "Why else would [Salomon]
give these IPOs to [the executives]? There were plenty of other
people clamoring for them."</TE>
<TE>   The executives clearly would have broken the law if they had
accepted cash in a suitcase in return for sending business to another
firm, Macey said. "The only twist is that instead of money in a
suitcase the money is in these hot IPOs."</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer stressed that under New York's tough securities laws he
does not have to prove an explicit deal between Salomon and the
executives--just a failure to disclose the stock gains to investors.</TE>
<TE>   Spinning has been widespread on Wall Street for years but has come
under intense scrutiny in the last year amid the host of financial
scandals that have rocked Wall Street and corporate America.</TE>
<TE>   Documents released by congressional investigators in August
revealed that Ebbers earned $11 million in profits on 21 IPO shares
allocated to him by Salomon between 1996 and 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz, former chairman of Qwest, received shares in 57 IPOs,
earning $5 million, Spitzer's complaint said. Nacchio earned more
than $1 million from 42 IPOs, the suit says. Garofalo took part in 37
IPOs, earning $1.5 million. McLeod made $9 million on 32 deals.</TE>
<TE>   Reid H. Weingarten, an attorney for Ebbers, said his client had no
quid pro quo with Salomon. "These were not perks. He was willing to
take the risk, but there were no guarantees," Weingarten said. "He
also didn't feel he had to give any business to [Salomon]."</TE>
<TE>   Charles Stillman, an attorney for Nacchio, said in a statement
that the allegations were "totally false" and that Nacchio will be
"completely vindicated."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Anschutz Corp. said the IPO shares went to
Anschutz's more than 100 companies and that Anschutz himself did not
personally receive any IPO shares. The firm said the suit is
"absolutely without merit."</TE>
<TE>   Garofalo's attorney declined to comment. McLeod couldn't be
reached.</TE>
<TE>   Salomon earned $240 million in investment-banking fees from the
executives' companies in the late 1990s, the suit said.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer's suit grew out of his office's broad investigation of
Salomon and its stock analysts. Along with other regulators, Spitzer
is probing whether analysts at Salomon and other big Wall Street
firms hyped stocks to please executives of the subject firms, in the
hope of winning banking work.</TE>
<TE>   Much of Spitzer's suit is taken up with details about the
practices of Salomon and its former top telecom analyst, Jack
Grubman. The complaint includes several bluntly worded e-mails from
Salomon brokers deriding Grubman's bullishness and bemoaning the
losses suffered by investors after many hyped telecom stocks
collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   "Grubman is an absolute disgrace to our firm as an 'analyst' ...
[and] the damage he has caused to [small investors] is a disgrace,"
one broker said in an e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   The suit also states that top Salomon officials expressed worries
about analyst conflicts of interest, but did not remedy them.</TE>
<TE>   John Hoffman, head of Salomon's global equity research, noted at a
senior management meeting apparently in early 2001 that the firm had
no "sell" ratings and only one "underperform" rating on the 1,179
stocks it covered. In a handwritten note, he labeled that "ridiculous
on its face."</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer did not charge Salomon in his suit, probably because
Spitzer is in talks with the firm to resolve his investigation,
analysts said. Likewise, the suit does not charge Grubman.</TE>
<TE>   Salomon refused to comment Monday. Grubman's attorney said that
the former analyst played no role in IPO allocations and that his
recommendations reflected his "honestly held views."</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer probably disclosed the allegations against Salomon to put
public pressure on the firm to acquiesce to his settlement demands,
analysts said.</TE>

<HD>Firm May Face Fines on Exports</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>U.S. export-control officials have accused Sun Microsystems Inc. of
violating federal regulations in the sale of computer equipment to
Egypt and, through a reseller in Hong Kong, to China.</LD>
<LD>   The Commerce Department's Office of Export Enforcement warned the
company that it could be subject to fines or even denial of export
privileges if Sun is found to have broken the law.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Clara, Calif.-based Sun disclosed the February accusation
Monday in its annual filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The firm said it was negotiating with the Commerce
Department and that it was "reasonably likely" it would reach a
settlement that would not have a material effect on its operations.
But the export officials warned that Sun was likely to face
additional charges.</LD>
<TE>   "We do not believe the evidence would support the extreme sanction
of a denial of export privileges," Sun wrote in its filing. Slightly
more than half of Sun's revenue comes from overseas.</TE>
<TE>   Sun spokesman Andy Lark said he didn't know how the hardware in
question was used. He said China was barred from receiving the goods
when it did so in 1997, and the issue in the 1998 sale to Egypt
involved improper notification to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   This is the second time in recent years that Sun's China dealings
have triggered federal action.</TE>
<TE>   Also in filings Monday, Sun named former SEC Chief Accountant Lynn
Turner and former Sun Chief Financial Officer Mike Lehman to its
board. It said Packet Design Chief Executive Judith Estrin had
resigned from the audit committee of its board. Sun does business
with Packet Design, and Sun CEO Scott McNealy, Chief Scientist Bill
Joy, and two nonexecutive directors have interests in that firm.</TE>

<HD>Taft-Hartley Act Is Ultimate Weapon</HD>
<DH>Labor: Observers say if President Bush invokes the law to
end the port shutdown, he could reap political as well as economic
benefits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Although the Bush administration moved cautiously Monday to intervene
in the West Coast ports shutdown, few observers doubt that the
president will act quickly to end the lockout if the two sides can't
settle their differences within days.</LD>
<LD>   Most administration attention now focuses on the 1947 Taft-Hartley
Act, which gives the president the power to call for an 80-day
cooling-off period. Observers say if Bush ultimately invokes the act
and ends the shutdown, he is likely to reap political as well as
economic benefits.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, it is hard to imagine an issue better framed for a
Republican president to tackle than another economic crisis spilling
out of Democratic California and, this time, arguably triggered by a
keystone of the Democratic coalition: organized labor.</LD>
<TE>   Although members of the International Longshore and Warehouse
Union are being locked out by management, the shipping companies and
terminal operators say they had no choice but to shut down the ports
after what they characterized as an orchestrated slowdown by workers.</TE>
<TE>   "I do think if the president invokes the Taft-Hartley law, it
could be very helpful," said Stephen Kinney, a Los Angeles-based
partner of the GOP polling firm Public Opinion Strategies. "To take
some kind of action instead of sitting on the sidelines would be
fitting with his character and show his decisiveness."</TE>
<TE>   Most of Bush's encounters with organized labor since coming to
office 20 months ago have been combative. In March 2001, for
instance, he issued an executive order preventing a strike by
mechanics at Northwest Airlines. He went on to help push pilots and
flight attendants into settlements with Delta and American airlines.</TE>
<TE>   Within months of the Sept. 11 terror attacks, he cited national
security concerns to abruptly end union representation at several
Justice Department agencies.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, he has become embroiled in a political slugfest
over whether employees of his proposed Homeland Security Department
can be safely granted civil service job protection.</TE>
<TE>   But none of these fights provided the clear political sightlines
that the battle over the Pacific ports appears to offer. Finally, the
administration seems to believe, Bush can be seen as standing up to
union intransigence and doing so in the name of protecting the
economy and the nation's security.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the White House sees this as ... an opportunity for Bush
to look Reaganesque," said University of Texas economist James K.
Galbraith.</TE>
<TE>   In the fall of 1981, only 10 months after taking office,
then-President Reagan caught nearly everybody by surprise--and
secured his reputation for forceful action--by firing striking
members of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers union.</TE>
<TE>   From the GOP point of view, Bush has an even more appealing target
in the ILWU than Reagan did in the air-traffic controllers' strike.
That's because the ILWU is one of the most aggressive unions left
standing after decades of dwindling labor power, and its members are
some of the most highly paid blue-collar workers in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Labor historians said that there will be a special irony if the
weapon the president ultimately uses against the union is
Taft-Hartley. It was the 55-year-old law's requirement that labor
leaders--but no other economic actors--sign anti-Communist pledges at
the start of the Cold War that marked the ILWU as the most radical of
American unions. Then-union leader Harry Bridges refused to sign,
causing a politically jittery Congress of Industrial Organizations to
drive the longshoremen out of the labor federation.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials were cautious Monday about any mention of
Taft-Hartley. But the head of a national group representing firms
that depend on West Coast ports felt no similar caution.</TE>
<TE>   Robin Lanier, executive director of the West Coast Waterfront
Coalition, an industry group, said that if the two sides don't
swiftly reach a settlement, the administration should do "whatever it
needs to reopen the ports, and that means invoking Taft-Hartley."</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents
shipping lines and U.S.-based terminal operators in the dispute,
painted the lockout as a last-ditch maneuver. But some labor experts
said it appeared designed to provoke government intervention and
revive stalled contract talks.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever the facts about the slowdown, the lockout is a tactic
aimed at bringing in the Bush administration through Taft-Hartley,"
said William B. Gould IV, a former chairman of the National Labor
Relations Board. Gould said a port shutdown could allow the
administration to meet the law's requirement that there be a "threat
to the national health and safety."</TE>
<TE>   Proving to a federal court, which must approve any presidential
back-to-work order, that such an emergency exists can be tricky.
President Carter tried but failed during a national coal strike at
the height of the energy crisis in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason if no other, Bush administration officials moved
carefully Monday, saying only that they wanted the two sides in the
fight to come to Washington on Thursday to meet with federal
mediators. But Republican political operatives were far less
controlled.</TE>
<TE>   "President Bush has a 65% approval rating where [Gov.] Gray Davis
has 42%," GOP pollster Kinney said.</TE>
<TE>   "Even in this state, the president is seen as decisive," and
getting involved in the port shutdown is only going to make him
appear more decisive.</TE>

<HD>Tyco Woes Creating Problems for Auditor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tyco International Ltd. has become a headache for its outside auditor
PricewaterhouseCoopers, whose work is being scrutinized by
investigators poring over several controversial deals that happened
on the accounting firm's watch.</LD>
<LD>   PricewaterhouseCoopers said Monday that it is cooperating as an
"information provider" with the Manhattan district attorney's office
on its probe of Tyco. A spokesman for the firm declined to comment on
the information requested.</LD>
<LD>   Tyco also confirmed Monday that the conglomerate's accounting
treatment of nearly $100 million in secret loans is part of the
second phase of an internal investigation led by lawyer David Boies.</LD>
<TE>   One key question for the Boies team is whether audits by PWC
uncovered about $96 million in unauthorized payments to a group of
employees that included former Chairman L. Dennis Kozlowski.</TE>
<TE>   The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Manhattan prosecutors
are investigating whether the accounting firm knew about the secret
bonuses and the methods used to hide them.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal at Tyco is the latest embarrassment for
PricewaterhouseCoopers.</TE>
<TE>   In July, the firm agreed to pay $5 million to settle charges
brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission that its auditors
approved improper accounting and that it violated independence
standards. It was the second-largest payment by an accounting firm to
the market's top regulator.</TE>
<TE>   During Kozlowski's tenure, Tyco became a lucrative client for
PricewaterhouseCoopers, which collected $50.1 million in fees from
the conglomerate in 2001. Before his indictment, Kozlowski also
served as chairman of the audit committee at defense contractor
Raytheon Co., which paid PricewaterhouseCoopers $84 million in fees
in 2001, out of which only $4 million was for audit services.</TE>
<TE>   A senior SEC official said the relationship between Tyco and
PricewaterhouseCoopers could merit additional scrutiny from agency
investigators.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC official, who requested anonymity, said agency
investigators would want to know the substance of discussions, if
any, between PricewaterhouseCoopers leaders and Tyco executives about
the secret loan payments, for example.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Shares Dip Amid Sale Doubts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal's share price dropped 8% on Monday in response to
complications standing in the way of the sale of its Italian TV arm.</LD>
<LD>   The world's second-largest media firm needs the sale of Telepiu to
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. to meet its goal of nearly $5 billion in
asset sales by year-end to reduce its massive debt.</LD>
<LD>   But the Financial Times reported Monday that the nearly $1-billion
deal was in jeopardy after News Corp. uncovered "due diligence"
problems.</LD>
<TE>   That news came on top of a European Union warning that the deal
would have to be cleared by EU regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi and News Corp. declined to comment, but sources close to
Vivendi attempted to shrug off the complications.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's American depositary receipts closed down $1.01 to $11.39
on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The former water utility's shares have fallen 80% this year as the
company wrestled with nearly $30 billion in debt inherited from
ousted Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier.</TE>
<TE>   Chairman and CEO Jean-Rene Fourtou apparently jumped the gun by
announcing the long-awaited sale of Telepiu to News Corp. as a
"scoop" to journalists at a presentation last week.</TE>
<TE>   Cancellation of the proposed deal would be an embarrassing setback
to Vivendi's no-nonsense chairman, anxious to avoid the gaffes and
U-turns that undermined his predecessor.</TE>

<DH>Money always made America's Cup run over; now it buys
insider knowledge</DH>

<AU>GERARD WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>AUCKLAND, New Zealand</DL>
<LD>Halsey Street starts alongside a saturated sports ground, Victoria
Park, and runs downhill, ending as a watery cul-de-sac, with seagulls
fluttering and foraging among mounds of trash.</LD>
<LD>   If you judge an address by the companies it houses, this is the
most expensive half-mile in the Southern Hemisphere. Gathered here,
barbed-wire cheek by key-padded jowl, are the 10 syndicates that will
contest the 31st America's Cup, which started Monday night (Pacific
time) with the challenger series for the Louis Vuitton Cup.</LD>
<LD>   Over the next five months, sailing syndicates with budgets
totaling more than half a billion dollars will be reassembled and
sent out to sea from here. Their destinies will unfold in slow
motion--the top speed of a 79-foot, 50,000-pound America's Cup yacht
is 9 1/2 mph. Often, those fates will be apparent even before each
race is underway, since the crucial part of these sailing contests is
establishing the best position at the start.</LD>
<TE>   Here, on the other side of the international date line, it's the
world of Larry Ellison of Oracle and Otto Plattner of SAP; the place
for a meeting of the minds and needs of Paul Allen, co-founder of
Microsoft, and Craig McCaw, onetime father of cellular telephone
communications. Somewhere in there too, is a lawyer turned
$30-an-hour tennis coach. Their common interest is 1 mph of boat
speed.</TE>
<TE>   The story starts with money, or the lack of it. In April, 2001,
McCaw's companies were losing $15 million a day, by the estimate of
Fortune magazine. OneWorld Challenge, the altruistic $75-million
America's Cup campaign McCaw had founded in partnership with the
Seattle Yacht Club "to win the oldest trophy in sports in the name of
the World's oceans" was starting to look like an indulgence.</TE>
<TE>   So McCaw undertook what the London Times called "the world's
biggest garage sale." Foremost among the sale items was Tatoosh, a
303-foot luxury yacht, about to be launched at shipyards in Kiel,
Germany. Tatoosh was built for $150 million. The asking price was
reported to be $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   The buyer was Paul Allen, shortly to become a sponsor of OneWorld
Challenge through the commitment of $10 million from his TechTV in
San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   OneWorld Challenge was undergoing further budget cuts. At a
meeting in mid-May in Seattle, the syndicate members--sailors,
designers, technicians, support staff--were told they were going to
have to feel some of the owner's pain.</TE>
<TE>   McCaw, who to that point had spent $30 million, said he would quit
the campaign unless they agreed to release him from their contracts
and take discounts on their pay.</TE>
<TE>   "At that time, our future looked pretty bleak," says Bob Ratliffe,
communications director of OneWorld Challenge and a spokesman for
McCaw. "Wages were substantially cut. That was voluntary. We had to
make some tough decisions. The team came to me and that was one of
the first things put on the table. The guys said they would be
proactive."</TE>
<TE>   All except Sean Reeves, the team's rules advisor and operations
manager.</TE>
<TE>   Reeves, 41, is a commercial lawyer in Auckland. This was to be his
third America's Cup campaign. The first two were as Team New
Zealand's rules advisor, the jungle guide every syndicate employs to
help it through the thicket of America's Cup rules.</TE>
<TE>   Reeves had shared a desk with Team New Zealand's figurehead and
patron saint, the late Sir Peter Blake, who was killed by pirates at
the mouth of the Amazon last December, and believed he had a working
knowledge of how to run a Cup campaign.</TE>
<TE>   After New Zealand's successful defense of the Cup, in February
2000, there was a scramble by syndicates to recruit its team members.
In 26 cases, money won out over national pride.</TE>
<TE>   Russell Coutts and Brad Butterworth, Team New Zealand skipper and
tactician, respectively, joined the Swiss Alinghi syndicate. Others
would soon be gone, including the rules advisor.</TE>
<TE>   Recollections vary as to the extent of influence Reeves wielded in
the recruiting of his former teammates, 12 in all. The pick of them,
though, was boat designer Laurie Davidson, 78, with a festering
resentment for the lack of individual credit his work had received
during the successful Team New Zealand campaign.</TE>
<TE>   New Zealand, population 3.7 million, was at first aghast, and then
defiant at the defections.</TE>
<TE>   "There's more where they came from," sniffed an editorial in
Auckland's New Zealand Herald.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes called the Pacific Peso, the currency of Australia and
New Zealand fluctuates between 40% and 60% of the U.S. dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Now the defectors were being paid in U.S. dollars. Gary Wright,
OneWorld Challenge's chief executive, estimates salaries were
increased by 200%-400%, to about $200,000, in some cases, and $1
million or more for senior positions.</TE>
<TE>   Davidson was paid $1.5 million for eight drawings of a new
America's Cup boat. According to an undated contract signed by Reeves
and Wright, Reeves' pay would escalate from $40,000 a month in 2000,
to $50,000 a month in 2001, and $60,000 per month for 2002. Bonuses
would range from $250,000 for reaching the semifinals of the Louis
Vuitton Cup, to $2 million for winning the America's Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my retirement," Reeves remembers one of his countrymen
telling him after he had signed.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys were chasing bonuses," Reeves said. "These guys were
doing everything to win, including crossing that boundary of taking
[Team New Zealand's] stuff with them, and it was endemic."</TE>
<TE>   In a submission last February to the America's Cup Arbitration
Panel, the body charged with divining the meaning and intent of the
America's Cup Protocol, OneWorld acknowledged that some of its guys
had taken stuff--carbon-fiber specifications, photographs of secret
miniature model tests, computer programs and spreadsheets--that had
been used to assemble NZL 57 and 60, the winning boats for the
previous Team New Zealand campaign.</TE>
<TE>   But, they added, none of it was important, and it hadn't been used
anyway.</TE>
<TE>   The Kiwis disagreed. Their submission to the panel said three of
the six former team members with laptop computers containing Team New
Zealand files had not been returned to be purged of relevant
information as requested. A fourth team member had opened a design
file the day before he took his laptop in. Another had kept a copy of
a file that "could fairly be said to contain a distilled
representation of most of TNZ's intellectual property."</TE>
<TE>   The observations rankled. In an unpublished letter to the daily
and Sunday newspapers in Auckland, OneWorld's Wright said that this
was not the way Peter Blake would have handled the situation.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a man who felt that differences like this should be
settled out on the water," Wright told The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Instead it was left to the arbitration panel, five practicing and
former judges and lawyers, from Europe, Australia and New Zealand to
sort out. Except that they had legal problems of their own.</TE>
<TE>   Some syndicates were dragging their feet about signing a
commitment not to sue the panel --which held the power of competitive
life and death over them--if they weren't happy with panel decisions.
The panel also was seeking a separate indemnity against lawsuits from
parties with interest in the outcome of its decisions, such as a
sponsor, but with no direct connection to any syndicate.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is, what would happen if the panel disqualified a
syndicate?" a source close to the panel said. "It's a very gray area.
We're dealing with very wealthy men who would have no compunction in
funding a lawsuit."</TE>
<TE>   By early August, the panel had been provided with an insurance
policy, covering it for $25 million in legal costs.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, it announced its decision: OneWorld Challenge had
breached rules relating to the possession, if not use, of other
teams' information. The penalty would be the deduction of one point,
the equivalent of a first-round win in the round-robin challenger
series.</TE>
<TE>   OneWorld, though, had been fighting a legal war on two fronts. The
second was in Seattle, where it had sued Reeves in U.S. District
Court, alleging he had breached a confidentiality agreement, signed
after he and the syndicate had parted ways in May 2001, by trying to
sell information to other syndicates.</TE>
<TE>   Reeves, paid $600,000 in severance, counter-sued for defamation.
Neither side gave much heed to the non-disparagement clause in their
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a tennis coach now," Reeves said. "I'm just a little guy. I
make $30 an hour, coaching people in tennis in wet, old New Zealand
in the winter. I'm hardly a high flier here."</TE>
<TE>   This lack of status made no difference to District Court Judge
Barbara Rothstein, who dismissed Reeves' defamation complaint and on
Thursday ruled that Reeves had breached the confidentiality
agreement, finding him liable for damages and OneWorld Challenge
legal fees totaling at least $750,000.</TE>
<TE>   Reeves, who had previously told The Times his legal fees were
being paid by friends of the family of his American wife, suggested
to the New Zealand Herald that he would not pay the money.</TE>
<TE>   So, why?</TE>
<TE>   Why the premium on, and pilfering of design and construction
information that will be 3 to 5 years old by the time it is used?</TE>
<TE>   Why throw such stupendous amounts of money at a sporting trophy,
even one that is 151 years old?</TE>
<TE>   To answer the first: America's Cup yachts are designed to certain
specifications, most notably, 79 feet of above-water length, and a
total weight of 27 1/2 tons. Within those restrictions is the
requirement to design for an almost infinite number of variations,
the result of an object racing under maximum stress through two
different and constantly changing elements: wind and water.</TE>
<TE>   "The difficulty of yacht design is that you have an extra problem
created by the water," says Dave Egan, a designer with the Italian
Prada team. "If you are building an aircraft or a car, the flow is
always around it. With a boat, as it changes speed, the amount of
wave or surface it encounters changes."</TE>
<TE>   On most teams, after each day on the water, there are changes to
the boat requested by the sailors and/or the designers. These changes
are made, simulated on computer, tested, fed into another computer,
which checks the effects on everything else aboard, and then the boat
goes back onto the water. Time is as critical to preparation as
money. Time can be saved with the availability of proven designs and
computer programs.</TE>
<TE>   To answer the second: The dismissal of the America's Cup as simply
the indulgence of a few billionaires is tempting but not strictly
accurate. Apart from the cachet of holding a trophy first contested
off the south of England in 1851, the savvy Cup holder virtually owns
a license to print money. He can run the event at a time and location
of his choosing, under rules of his devising. It's like throwing the
world's most exclusive party, and knowing that there will always be
guests willing to pay whatever is necessary to get in.</TE>
<TE>   The holder of the Cup also gets broadcasting, merchandising and
staging rights to the event.</TE>
<TE>   Dyer Jones, of the New York Yacht Club, chief executive of the
organizing committee for the Louis Vuitton Cup, puts the total
broadcasting rights value at $10 million, as does Bill Koch, the
Cup-winning skipper of America3 in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Merchandising can return as much as $40 million. The jackpot,
though, is the staging rights.</TE>
<TE>   "The big money in the America's Cup isn't in the TV rights or the
merchandising rights," says Koch. "It's in the real estate."</TE>
<TE>   Auckland's Viaduct Basin was a relatively decrepit fishing port
until the mid-1990s, famous only as the place where the Greenpeace
vessel, Rainbow Warrior, was sunk by French agents in 1985. After New
Zealand's America's Cup victory off San Diego in 1995, $55 million
was spent to upgrade the area.</TE>
<TE>   With this, and the subsequent announcement by the Royal New
Zealand Yacht Squadron that the competing teams would be based at the
Basin, the value of the surrounding land soared. What was once
derelict open space, is now covered by restaurants, cafes, bars and
apartments.</TE>
<TE>   From Halsey Street in the City of Sails, this space looks like the
place where everything happened at once: the future, progress, money,
fame, all jammed into six years and 10 acres</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>They're Wild About the Wild Card</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>For all the ridicule directed at Bud Selig, the Angels are enormously
grateful to the commissioner this morning. Selig pushed hard for the
adoption of the wild-card format, and without it the Angels would be
sitting at home, rather than participating in the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels won 99 games this season, a club record. But the
Oakland Athletics won 103, and under the old format, second place
would have been good for nothing.</LD>
<LD>   In 1995, the first year of the wild-card format, the Seattle
Mariners trailed the Angels by 13 games. The Mariners acquired Andy
Benes and Vince Coleman, shooting for the wild card but never
dreaming the Angels would cough up that huge lead.</LD>
<TE>   "If there wasn't a wild card, Seattle would have given up. It
ended up costing us," Angel outfielder Tim Salmon said. "Now, I'm
glad there's a wild card. If we won 99 games and didn't make it ...</TE>
<TE>   "We got ripped off in '95. It's made the difference for us this
year."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   John Lackey, who never has pitched in relief in either the major
or minor leagues, will be available in the Angel bullpen for the
first two games of the series. If the Yankees knock out a starter
early in the game, Lackey and Scot Shields are the Angels' options in
long relief.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels still might start Lackey in the fourth game of the
series, as originally planned, but they are thinking harder about
bringing back Jarrod Washburn on three days' rest, even if they lead
the series. That will depend in part on how many pitches Washburn
throws tonight.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees, as usual, have a ridiculous assortment of riches on
what Manager Joe Torre calls "the best staff I've ever had." The
Yankees did not have room for Sterling Hitchcock on their playoff
roster, despite his 2.35 postseason earned-run average. They sent
starters Orlando Hernandez (2.48 postseason ERA) and Jeff Weaver to
the bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees traditionally use closer Mariano Rivera in the eighth
and ninth innings during the playoffs, but Torre said he would not
ask Rivera to pitch before the ninth inning this fall. Rivera was
activated Sept. 21 after missing five weeks because of a sore
shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Monday was the first day of the off-season for the Cleveland
Indians, and their first order of business is to determine whether
interim Manager Joel Skinner should be hired for the full-time job.
General Manager Mark Shapiro has said he plans to interview other
candidates before making a decision, with Angel pitching coach Bud
Black believed to be atop the list.</TE>
<TE>   Should the Indians hire Black, the Angels have no obvious
candidate to replace him. Mike Couchee, the Angels' top minor league
pitching instructor, has been fired. Mike Butcher, the triple-A
pitching coach this season, has been promoted to replace Couchee and
could be a candidate. Former Dodger Claude Osteen, the pitching coach
under Manager Mike Scioscia at triple-A Albuquerque in 1999, also
could be a candidate.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels haven't participated in the playoffs in 16 years, but
the last two teams that returned to the playoffs after even longer
droughts fared well. In 1995, the Indians made their first playoff
appearance in 42 years and advanced to the World Series. In 1987, the
Minnesota Twins made their first appearance in 17 years and won the
World Series.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' traveling party includes six players not on the
playoff roster--catcher Sal Fasano, infielder Alfredo Amezaga and
pitchers Mickey Callaway, Dennis Cook, Al Levine and Aaron Sele. The
Angels cannot make a roster change during this series, even in case
of injury. If they defeat the Yankees, the Angels can shuffle their
roster before the American League championship series, so they want
the extra players to keep working out with the team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shields rejoined the team Monday after a whirlwind weekend in
which he said he slept for a total of three hours. He made his first
major league start Friday, flew to his Michigan home for the birth of
his first child--a girl, Kayla--Sunday, then flew here Monday, for
October baseball in Yankee Stadium. "I don't think it can get any
better than this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS' JARROD WASHBURN</TE>
<TE>   (18-6, 3.15 ERA)</TE>
<TE>   vs. YANKEES' ROGER CLEMENS</TE>
<TE>   (13-6, 4.35 ERA)</TE>
<TE>   Yankee Stadium, 5:15 p.m. PDT</TE>
<TE>   TV--Channel 11.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KLAC (570), XPRS (1090).</TE>
<TE>   Update--Washburn is 13-3 on the road this year; Clemens is 9-1 at
home. Washburn loves to face Alfonso Soriano (0 for 8) and Jason
Giambi (.231) and hates to face Bernie Williams (.444), Raul Mondesi
(.444) and Derek Jeter (.333). Clemens loves to face Scott Spiezio
(.115), Garret Anderson (.205), Troy Glaus (.211) and Tim Salmon
(.235) and hates to face Darin Erstad (.389), Adam Kennedy (.333) and
Brad Fullmer (.296). Scioscia said the Angels' regular-season
platoons would remain in effect, with designated hitter Fullmer and
second baseman Kennedy starting tonight against right-hander Clemens,
and Shawn Wooten and Benji Gil replacing them Wednesday against
left-hander Andy Pettitte.</TE>

<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>The Arizona Diamondbacks won the World Series last year by beating
the New York Yankees, the nation's sentimental favorite.</LD>
<LD>   In the National League division series that begins Tuesday night,
Arizona will face a St. Louis Cardinal team that overcame the deaths
of pitcher Darryl Kile and broadcaster Jack Buck to win the Central
Division.</LD>
<LD>   "People look at us and say 'Oh, a team of destiny,' " Cardinal
pitcher Matt Morris said.</LD>
<TE>   "But it's not always a fairy-tale ending."</TE>
<TE>   Arizona Manager Bob Brenly said his team sympathizes with the
Cardinals, but can't let that affect anything once the game begins.</TE>
<TE>   "Being a manager for the last two years, I cannot tell you the
admiration I have for Tony La Russa and his staff and the entire
Cardinal organization for what they have endured this year," Brenly
said.</TE>
<TE>   "What the Cardinals have had to go through is something we would
never wish on anybody.... We sympathize with all of the families
involved.</TE>
<TE>   "In the context of playing the game on the field, we don't feel
sorry for them and we don't expect them to feel sorry for us."</TE>
<TE>   Morris (17-9) finds himself in a familiar position as starter in
Game 1 of the division series against the Diamondbacks, who will
counter with Randy Johnson (24-5).</TE>
<TE>   Morris had two outstanding outings in Games 1 and 5 of last year's
division series against Arizona, but lost to Curt Schilling both
times.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my first time facing Randy, actually squaring off,"
Morris said. "I get to see what his fastball looks like up close."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's loss to the Cardinals in Game 2 last year was his lone
defeat of the postseason. He went 5-0 after that, including a record
three victories in the World Series. Since that October loss, Johnson
is 29-5.</TE>
<TE>   He won his third consecutive Cy Young Award last year, then had a
better season in 2002, becoming the first NL player since Dwight
Gooden in 1985 to win pitching's "triple crown" of wins (24),
strikeouts (334) and earned-run average (2.32). His reputation as a
postseason flop seems ancient history.</TE>
<TE>   La Russa plans to have three left-handed batters in the lineup
against Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "With the guys we have now, our left-handers hang in there real
good against left-handers," La Russa said. "The way Randy is, he's
just as tough against a right-hander. He's just different."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson has great respect for the Cardinal lineup, which already
was powerful before the trade that brought Scott Rolen from
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   "The St. Louis Cardinals lineup you are going to see probably is
the best lineup in all of the postseason, in my estimation," Johnson
said. "You don't have two or three hitters you need to be careful
with, you have four or five that command your attention."</TE>
<TE>   Arizona plans to go with a three-man rotation. Johnson would come
back on a four days' rest if there is a Game 4 on Sunday, and
Schilling would go on three days' rest in Game 5 on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "We're here to win, so we're going to find a way to break
through," La Russa said. "We will have eight tough outs in that
lineup."</TE>
<TE>   Asked what he would do if he faced the Cardinal lineup, Morris
said, "I might drop the ball and walk off."</TE>
<TE>   Morris has had a trying year, emotionally and physically. He was a
good friend of Kile.</TE>
<TE>   "I think about him every day," Morris said.</TE>
<TE>   Just as he was recovering emotionally from that loss, Morris
injured a hamstring.</TE>
<TE>   "He took a savage hit when Darryl died. It was tough on him to put
it all back together and I think he has shown a lot of great
qualities to do it," La Russa said.</TE>
<TE>   While the Cardinals rely on the big bats of Rolen, Albert Pujols,
Jim Edmonds, Edgar Renteria and Tino Martinez, among others, Arizona
has lost its best run-producer, Luis Gonzalez, and its best clutch
player, Craig Counsell, to season-ending injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the Cardinals swept three from the Diamondbacks in St.
Louis, which means very little, both sides agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything changes now," Schilling said.</TE>

<HD>What's Behind the TV Schedule</HD>
<DH>Media: ABC Family Channel inherits first round from Fox
Family. Fox says baseball set up playoff game times.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A look at baseball's postseason television schedule, which wasn't
completed until Sunday night, might prompt one to ask, "What's wrong
with this picture?"</LD>
<LD>   What are baseball playoff games doing on the ABC Family Channel?
And why are the St. Louis Cardinals and Arizona Diamondbacks on ABC
Family tonight at 8? That's 11 p.m. EDT.</LD>
<LD>   Kids in the East will have to stay up until maybe 2 a.m. on a
school night to watch the whole game.</LD>
<TE>   But as many as 12 first-round games will be televised by ABC
Family, which inherited them from Fox Family. Those are the games
that used to be on NBC. Last year, though, you may recall, they were
on Fox Family.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the Walt Disney Co. bought Fox Family, so Fox Family
became ABC Family.</TE>
<TE>   Disney got the postseason baseball rights to the divisional
playoff games that were carried by Fox Family last season and chose
to keep those games on ABC Family, which reaches 84 million homes, as
opposed to ESPN, which reaches 87 million.</TE>
<TE>   Such high-profile programming provides a big boost to ABC Family.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Cosgrove, the network's executive vice president, said:
"Essentially, the divisional playoffs provide us with good ratings
and a good promotional base to bring in new viewers, particularly
male viewers."</TE>
<TE>   ESPN, which is also owned by Disney, will produce the telecasts
for ABC Family and provide the announcers. So all the bells and
whistles ESPN offered during the regular season, such as ESPN K Zone
and Player Mic, will be seen on the ABC Family telecasts.</TE>
<TE>   The announcing teams include Jon Miller and Joe Morgan, Chris
Berman and Rick Sutcliffe, and Dave O'Brien and Tony Gwynn.</TE>
<TE>   ABC Family's role in the playoffs ends after the first round. The
two league championship series will be on Fox--with the exception of
Oct. 9, when Fox Sports Net will televise a game at the same time Fox
televises one. And the World Series, beginning Oct. 19, will be on
Fox.</TE>
<TE>   The first two games of the Angel-New York Yankee series will be
televised by Fox, with the network's A team of Joe Buck and Tim
McCarver announcing.</TE>
<TE>   Because those teams come from the nation's two largest media
markets, one might assume Fox picked them as the featured attraction
the first two nights of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Goren, Fox Sports president, said that wasn't the case.</TE>
<TE>   "In sports, it's often suggested we have more control over the
scheduling process than we actually do," Goren said. "We can ask for
certain things. It doesn't mean we always get what we ask for.</TE>
<TE>   "In this case, this was the best schedule that baseball felt they
could put together. Basically, we got a call [Sunday] night telling
us what the schedule was."</TE>
<TE>   The schedule is set through Friday, with Game 3 of the
Angel-Yankee series at Edison Field Friday at 5 p.m. to be televised
on ABC Family, with Miller and Morgan announcing.</TE>
<TE>   On radio, the Angel-Yankees series will be broadcast on KLAC (570)
and the rest of the Angels' radio network, with Rory Markas and Terry
Smith; on ESPN Radio--KSPN (1110) in Los Angeles--with Dan Shulman
and Dave Campbell; and on Spanish-language XPRS (1090), with Ivan
Lara and Jose Mota, Dodger coach Manny Mota's son.</TE>
<TE>   The schedule for the four divisional best-of-five series after
Friday will be determined by baseball.</TE>
<TE>   If there is a Game 4 in the National League series between Atlanta
and the San Francisco Giants, Buck is planning to do double duty in
San Francisco Sunday. He'll work the St. Louis Rams and 49ers in the
afternoon at 3Com Park, then hustle over the Pac-Bell for the Braves
and Giants that night.</TE>
<TE>   As for Fox's coverage of the first two games of the Angel-Yankee
series, producer Michael Weisman said, "One of the challenges for us
will be introducing the nation to the Angels....</TE>
<TE>   "People don't know that [pitcher] Ramon Ortiz is the team barber,
or Tim Salmon is known as Kingfish, a nickname given to him by
[analyst] Rex Hudler."</TE>
<TE>   Weisman said Fox has prepared a feature on Manager Mike Scoscia
that includes his playing days with the Dodgers, and pitching coach
Bud Black will be wearing a microphone tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing I've noticed about the Angels is just how happy they
are to be here," Weisman said. "I've been producing baseball off and
on for 30 years and I've never been around a team more cooperative."</TE>
<TE>   It figures that the Yankees would be in the featured series.</TE>
<TE>   "They have been the dominant team in baseball in recent years,"
Goren said.</TE>
<TE>   That's the main reason Fox wanted the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   "I think sometimes there is a misconception that just because you
have big-market teams, it guarantees ratings," Goren said. "Just go
back to the most recent NBA Finals, with the Lakers and Nets, in
effect a New York team. They didn't generate necessarily high
ratings. [There was a 17% drop-off from the season before]. And the
1991 World Series with Atlanta and the Minnesota Twins was very
successful."</TE>
<TE>   That World Series averaged a 24 rating. No other Series since 1987
has averaged a higher rating. Last year's seven-game Series between
the Yankees and Diamondbacks generated a 15.7 rating.</TE>
<TE>   Goren said of regular-season ratings: "We were going along real
well until about four or five weeks ago, where in September we did
give back a good margin. We'll end up the season flat."</TE>
<TE>   After this weekend's numbers are figured in, Fox expects to have a
season average of 2.6, the same as 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The arrival of football, plus the fact there were title races in
only two divisions, contributed to the late-season ratings decline
for baseball. As for the playoffs, Goren is hoping for a run similar
to last season.</TE>
<TE>   "We were up 25% for the divisional series, 12% for the league
championship series and 27% for the World Series," he said. "When you
get down to reading the postseason, there are multiple factors, Maybe
the biggest are how competitive the games are and length of the
series."</TE>

<KH>AROUND THE MAJORS</KH>
<HD>McRae and Pujols Fired as Managers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Managers Hal McRae of Tampa Bay and Luis Pujols of Detroit were fired
Monday after their teams tied for the worst record in the major
leagues.</LD>
<LD>   The Devil Rays and Tigers each finished 55-106. But neither McRae
nor Pujols was completely to blame, insisted the men who fired them.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not making him a scapegoat," Tampa Bay General Manager Chuck
LaMar said. "I'm responsible for the personnel. I think he could've
won more games with better talent."</LD>
<TE>   McRae accepted a position as an assistant to the general manager.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's many people that could've walked into this
situation that would have made a significant difference in the number
of wins we had," Tiger President Dave Dombrowski said.</TE>
<TE>   Pujols replaced Phil Garner in April after an 0-6 start. The
Tigers' 1-0 loss at Toronto ended their poorest season since they
went 53-109 in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   McRae replaced Larry Rothschild on April 18, 2001, and managed the
Devil Rays to a 58-90 record over the rest of the season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An employee of the Florida Marlins was allegedly asked to put a
padlocked bag containing a pound of marijuana aboard the team's
charter flight from Montreal, club officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Luis Perez, a former bullpen catcher for the Marlins who
now has a similar job with the Montreal Expos, asked Florida video
coordinator Cullen McRae before last Thursday's game in Montreal to
bring the bag back to Pro Player Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   When McRae and team equipment manager John Silverman opened the
bag in Montreal, they found the marijuana and turned it over to
police, Silverman said.</TE>
<TE>   Perez was arrested Friday on charges of drug possession with
intent to export. He pleaded not guilty and was given conditional
release after posting a $5,000 bond.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Average attendance in the major leagues dropped 6.1% this year,
its second consecutive decline and the biggest decrease since the
season after the 1994-95 strike.</TE>
<TE>   This year's average of 28,168 was the majors' lowest since 1996
and was down from 30,012 last year, according to figures compiled by
the commissioner's office.</TE>
<TE>   Talk of a possible strike dominated baseball news in July and
August, perhaps contributing to a decline that worsened in the last
six weeks of the season.</TE>
<TE>   The largest decline was experienced by the Milwaukee Brewers. In
their second season at Miller Park, the Brewers saw attendance
decline by 841,888 or 30%.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Ruben Rivera, infielder Donnie Sadler and left-handed
pitcher C.J. Nitkowski were granted free agency by the Texas Rangers
after all three refused outright assignments to triple-A Oklahoma.
Meanwhile, third baseman Hank Blalock had arthroscopic surgery on his
right elbow to remove a bone spur and loose bodies.... Cincinnati
shortstop Barry Larkin underwent surgery to remove bone spurs from
his right big toe. Red infielder Juan Castro is to undergo
arthroscopic surgery today to clean out loose material in his left
knee.... Pittsburgh Pirate first baseman Kevin Young, catcher Jason
Kendall and pitcher Josh Fogg had arthroscopic surgery, one day after
the season ended. Young, who has a history of knee problems, had
floating tissue removed from his right knee. Kendall had a cyst and
bone chips removed from his left foot. Fogg needed a shard of glass
removed from his right foot.... Often injured pitcher Wilson Alvarez,
shortstop Chris Gomez and reliever Tom Martin were released by the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays.... Bill Virdon, who has more than 40 years of
major league experience as a player, manager and coach, has retired
after two seasons as the Pittsburgh Pirates' bench coach.</TE>

<LD>Jerry Greene of the Orlando Sentinel credits Denver Bronco
quarterback Brian Griese for an imaginative excuse for not being able
to practice--twisting his ankle when his dog, as he says, "clipped"
him on some stairs at home causing him to fall.</LD>
<LD>   But Griese's excuse ranks third on Greene's Best Football Excuse
list behind two Miami Dolphins:</LD>
<LD>   * "No. 2: Famed kicker Garo Yepremian once showed up for a game
with a badly injured big toe. At first he said he had kicked a tire
on his car, then admitted that he had dropped his bed on his foot.</LD>
<TE>   * "No. 1: Nose tackle Alfred Oglesby, drafted in 1990, missed a
practice and said it was because he had been kidnapped and left in
the Everglades."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the record for most seasons with one club
in the major leagues?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's about time: Laura Vecsey of the Baltimore Sun on the Harlem
Globetrotters' recent induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame:</TE>
<TE>   "Their credentials are beyond question or compare.... We're
talking generation after generation of wildly skilled ballhandlers,
shooters, ambassadors of the game, entertainers.</TE>
<TE>   " ... We're talking Meadowlark Lemon, Goose Tatum, Marques Haynes.
We're talking Fred 'Curly' Neal, a bald-headed star long before
Charles Barkley, who could spin a ball on his finger, dribble a ball
like it was a yo-yo."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Big time stuff: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle: "It's
true we are no longer the global power in men's basketball. But there
are so many sports that Americans still dominate.</TE>
<TE>   "I stress the following is only a partial list: dog Frisbee,
channel surfing, touchdown dancing, father-son mugging,
basketball-mascot dunking, rodeo, midget wrestling, nude skydiving,
prison handball, video games, base throwing for distance and
hog-calling."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There's a solution: Steve Jacobson in Newsday: "One other last
word on the issue of no women members allowed at the home of the
Masters. Restrictions on women at golf clubs abound--like those that
forbid women to play on Saturday morning or prohibit them from
sitting at the window table in the restaurant on Saturdays and will
exist until the women say no more.</TE>
<TE>   "The wives of the members ought to read 'Lysistrata,' in which the
women of the Greek cities involved in the Peloponnesian War refused
to lie with their men until there was peace.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless that's of no interest to golfers."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1944, the St. Louis Browns recorded a
final-day 5-2 victory over the New York Yankees and clinched the
first--and only--pennant of their frustrating 44-year history.</TE>
<TE>   The Browns lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in six games in the
World Series.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Brooks Robinson and Carl Yastrzemski share it, 23
years with the Baltimore Orioles and Boston Red Sox, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Gil Lebreton of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, writing
before the St. Louis Rams had fallen to 0-4 by losing to the Cowboys:
"The Rams multi-motion, fire-drill offense was widely christened as
'The Greatest Show on Turf.' Now the headline writers, even in St.
Louis, are twisting the knife--'Greatest No Shows on Earth.' "</TE>

<TE>   STRENGTHS: Went 55-15 in games started by Johnson or Curt

Veteran group knows what it takes to win it all after beating the
Yankees in 2001.</TE>

<TE>   KEYS TO THE SERIES</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals are among baseball's hottest teams, having won 21 of
their last 25 games after a power surge by newcomer Rolen. They beat
Johnson three times last year--including once in the postseason--and
defeated Schilling twice this season. Expect more scoring than last
season, when the Diamondbacks eked out a 3-2 division series win over
the Cardinals but scored only 10 runs in the five games.</TE>

<HD>Odom Plays Waiting Game</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Clipper forward hasn't played since Jan. 18
and still has no timetable for his return from a second badly
sprained ankle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All dressed up but in no shape to play, Lamar Odom went through the
rituals of Clipper media day Monday at Staples Center. He donned his
No. 7 jersey and oversized shorts, laced up his high-tops then posed
for photographers, answered reporters' questions and signed
basketballs and other collectibles.</LD>
<LD>   Odom needed crutches to get around, however, looking as helpless
as he had when the season ended in April. His sprained right ankle is
no closer to being sound enough for him to play than it was last
spring.</LD>
<LD>   There's no timetable for Odom's return, although he hinted that it
might be December before he can be a regular contributor. It's been a
week since a hard cast came off and was replaced by a soft one.</LD>
<TE>   "Obviously, he's one of our best players, if not our best," Coach
Alvin Gentry said the day before the team opened training camp.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to see him ready to go, but you deal with it. We
have to stay on top of his rehab. I don't think it's anybody on the
team's fault that it didn't heal properly. [Odom] has to make sure he
does his part. We have the [medical] people to take him through his
rehab and get him back out there.</TE>
<TE>   "But the main responsibility falls on Lamar."</TE>
<TE>   Elton Brand, who underwent arthroscopic knee surgery last week,
and Keyon Dooling, who has an ankle injury, also won't be ready for
the opening of training camp today at Palm Desert. But it's Odom's
ankle that concerns the team most.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no idea," Odom said when asked when he believed he would
play again. "It's a bad injury. All I can do is give it time to heal
and be ready to play in the second part of the season.... I want to
be healthy at the end of December and January, when we have to make
our push for the playoffs. I can't get too down just because I hurt
my foot. There's a lot worse things going on in the world. Don't you
watch CNN?"</TE>
<TE>   More than one Clipper official complained privately during the
off-season that Odom was not taking his rehabilitation sessions as
seriously as the team had hoped, and it was feared that he would not
be fit to play once training camp began.</TE>
<TE>   And that was before Odom reinjured his ankle while working out at
Loyola Marymount.</TE>
<TE>   He originally hurt it after stepping on a stray basketball while
attempting a dunk in February. That was after he had injured his left
wrist--and eventually needed surgery--after taking a fall in a
December game against the Detroit Pistons. And that was a month after
the NBA had suspended him for eight games for violating the league's
anti-drug policy for the second time in less than a year.</TE>
<TE>   Odom hasn't played since Jan. 18.</TE>
<TE>   Pressed for an anticipated date for Odom's return, Gentry said he
couldn't give one.</TE>
<TE>   "It all depends on how his rehab goes," Gentry said. "With Lamar,
it's a wait-and-see thing. It's hard to put a definitive number on
when he will be back. He has to make sure he does his part."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry had hoped that Odom would be ready to join his teammates
today because the coach has a few new ideas about how to improve the
team's play after last season's 39-43 record and ninth-place finish
in the Western Conference, five games out of the eighth and final
playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   With the addition of point guard Andre Miller in an off-season
trade that sent Darius Miles to the Cleveland Cavaliers, Gentry hopes
to increase the Clippers' defensive pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough," Gentry said, speaking of Odom and the other injured
Clippers. "Obviously, we won't have those guys out there [today].
They won't have their timing down. Training camp is where you develop
team chemistry and learn to play together."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the record, Quentin Richardson made it clear that the double
tap of his fists to his forehead to celebrate a key play will
continue, even with Miles in Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll represent on the East Coast and I'll represent on the West
Coast," Richardson said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers signed four free agents Monday: guard Jason Crowe,
forwards Mike Batiste and James Head and center Jason Lawson. There
are 19 players on the training camp roster.</TE>

<LD>A consumer's guide to the best and worst of sports media and
merchandise. Ground rules: If it can be read, heard, observed,

<LD>   What: The Definitive Guide to Fishing in Central California</LD>
<LD>   Author/Publisher: Chris Shaffer</LD>
<TE>   Price: $24.95</TE>
<TE>   Where available: www.fishingcalifornia.net.</TE>
<TE>   The author says that within two years, "I will have fished more
waters than anyone in the state."</TE>
<TE>   Chances are, he already has. This 528-page guide, which follows a
Southern California version and precedes a Northern California
version, includes practically every fishable body of water in an area
from Santa Barbara to San Jose; Bakersfield to Stockton, and Mojave
to Sonora Pass, including the Eastern Sierra.</TE>
<TE>   To complete the color photo-illustrated book, Shaffer not only
visited every one of them, in many cases he claims to have donned a
mask and snorkel and plunged in to see first-hand how prolific the
fisheries might be.</TE>
<TE>   The author says that helped him come up with a more accurate
rating system, and it's hard to fault some of his ratings: A perfect
10 for Crowley Lake, a nine for June Lake, Bridgeport Reservoir and
nearby Twin Lakes, and a one for Mono Lake, which has no fish but
warrants a rating simply for being the otherworldly tourist
attraction it is.</TE>
<TE>   Without a doubt, the book is a handy reference guide, especially
for adventurous anglers looking to get off the beaten path.</TE>
<TE>   With fall upon us, Shaffer lists Edison Lake above Fresno as one
of his favorite fisheries because its enormous brown trout are just
now becoming active.</TE>
<TE>   The catch: "There's only one way to Edison Lake by car--Kaiser
Pass Road--and it's one of the most dangerous and frightening paved
roads I've ever driven," he writes.</TE>
<TE>   Another hot spot: Grassy Lake in the Minnow Creek Drainage,
reachable via 16-mile hike but "where catching a fish on each and
every cast is expected." All in all, the glossy book is well
researched and informative, containing fish-stocking information and
listing available facilities, directions and phone numbers. If there
is a drawback it's that some of the color photos are either too small
or of poor quality and fail to do the fisheries justice.</TE>

<KH>DUCK REPORT</KH>
<HD>Veterans Headed for Waiver Wire</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Correcting mistakes was the Mighty Ducks' order of business Monday,
as team officials prepared to make veterans Jason York, German Titov
and Denny Lambert available for Friday's NHL waiver draft.</LD>
<LD>   They were identified early in training camp as expendable, when
they were put in the minor league practice group after the first
week. The anticipated moves demonstrate a change in philosophy for
the penny-pinching Ducks, who appear willing to absorb the contracts
of the three players. York is owed $4 million over the next two
seasons. Titov will make $1.5 million and Lambert $550,000 this
season.</LD>
<LD>   If they are not claimed Friday, the Ducks can assign one or more
to minor league Cincinnati. General Manager Bryan Murray said he
tried to trade the three, but found no takers. He has given their
agents permission to pursue deals.</LD>
<TE>   "We have people here who have gone by them at this time," Murray
said. "We finished 13th in [the Western Conference] and we have to do
something. We have to show the players that we want to have a
contending team."</TE>
<TE>   York and Titov were to have helped the Ducks become contenders.
Both were signed to multimillion-dollar contracts as free agents by
former general manager Pierre Gauthier, Titov in 2000 and York in
2001. Neither lived up to expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Lambert, on the other hand, played his enforcer role well last
season. But the Ducks have decided that Kevin Sawyer can fill that
spot by himself this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I have really mixed feelings," Sawyer said. "These are friends
and teammates. This puts a little pressure on me to do my job every
night. But at the same time, they are showing confidence in me."</TE>
<TE>   Lambert played in only two exhibition games, and was ejected at
the start of one. Titov played in one, York in three, including the
Ducks' 7-4 loss to the Kings on Sunday. He was on the ice for four
King goals and was out of position on two.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough, because they are all good friends," team captain Paul
Kariya said. "But this is the first [Duck] camp I can remember where
there are a lot of guys fighting for spots. If a player is not doing
his job, someone is going to jump in and do it."</TE>
<TE>   The moves increase the opportunities for younger players who have
been impressive during camp. Defenseman Kurt Sauer and forwards
Alexei Smirnov and Stanislav Chistov all could make the roster.
Sauer, in particular, has been impressive, even though he is straight
out of juniors.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to energize this franchise a little bit," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks play an exhibition at Minnesota tonight. Ilya Bryzgalov,
who will probably be sent to Cincinnati, will start in goal. Forward
Joffrey Lupul, ticketed for another year of juniors, will get his
second start.... The Ducks released tryout goalie Marc Magliarditi on
Monday.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tennessee's starting tailback, Cedric Houston, will miss Saturday's
game against Arkansas because of a torn ligament in his left thumb.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Phillip Fulmer said Houston was hurt in the Volunteers'
35-14 win Saturday over Rutgers. He had surgery Monday and will be
out 10 days, meaning he could be back in time to play against Georgia
on Oct. 12.</LD>
<LD>   Houston started the first three games for No. 10 Tennessee (3-1,
0-1 Southeastern Conference) but deeply bruised his thigh early in
the Florida game Sept. 21. He remains Tennessee's leading rusher this
season with 193 yards in 28 carries and three touchdowns.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina State tailback T.A. McLendon broke a bone in his
right wrist but is expected to recover in time to play in the
Wolfpack's next game on Oct. 12. McLendon is scheduled to have
surgery today.... Police at Florida are investigating a break-in to
Kentucky's locker room in which a robber stole several hundred
dollars from the wallets of Wildcat Coach Guy Morriss and his
assistants. Kentucky lost to No. 6 Florida, 41-34, last Saturday....
Vanderbilt quarterback Jay Cutler was suspended from the team for an
unspecified violation of team rules.... Ohio State released Derek
Morris from his national letter of intent, school officials said....
Eastern Kentucky Coach Roy Kidd, 70, will retire at the end of the
season after 39 years and more than 300 victories. Kidd (310-121-8)
told players of the decision Sunday night.</TE>

<LD>Longtime Baldwin Park football Coach Tony Zane is fighting the
Baldwin Park Unified School District's decision to ban him from
coaching because of an irregular heartbeat.</LD>
<LD>   Zane had to watch from the stands as the Braves played Covina
Gladstone Friday, after school district officials learned of his
condition earlier in the week. Assistant Larry Davis coached Baldwin
Park (0-2-1) during the 7-7 tie.</LD>
<LD>   Zane, who is taking medication for his condition, said he planned
to meet with his doctor and an attorney this week. The 61-year-old
said he has suffered no ill effects while coaching since being
diagnosed with the condition four years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Carolyn Wertz, the school district's assistant superintendent,
said officials would be willing to consider new evidence regarding
Zane's condition.</TE>

<TE>   Westchester's defending state champion boys' basketball team,
already facing scrutiny over the eligibility of transfer student
Gabriel Pruitt from Compton Centennial, is involved in another
controversy surrounding the transfer of Ray Reese from Carson.</TE>
<TE>   Carson officials are alleging that a Westchester assistant coach
engaged in "undue influence" in helping the 6-foot-4 Reese transfer
two weeks ago, according to Carson Assistant Principal Rosie
Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez said she has not filed an official complaint and is
waiting for Westchester's response after informing the school and
City Section of her concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Reese started as a freshman last season at Carson. He played
during the summer for a travel team coached by a Westchester
assistant coach.</TE>
<TE>   Westchester was previously directed by the City Section to
investigate the eligibility of Pruitt. He lives in the Manual Arts
district but received an opportunity transfer to Westchester.</TE>

<DH>Riverside Poly builds a water polo power</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER YOON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Riverside Poly boys' water polo team would like to play in the
Southern Section Division I playoffs, just to see.</LD>
<LD>   They'd like to lock horns with Newport Harbor, Corona del Mar and
Long Beach Wilson, even if just for one year. Something tells them
that they could compete with the best if given the chance, but they
can't seem to get anyone to take them seriously.</LD>
<LD>   They are from Riverside, after all, and everybody knows that isn't
a hotbed for water polo.</LD>
<TE>   Right?</TE>
<TE>   Not exactly. Riverside Poly has established a tradition in water
polo, a sport most often associated with beach communities and Orange
County. The Bears have won six Southern Section titles, including the
last two in Division V, and are the top-ranked team in the division
again this year.</TE>
<TE>   But it is Division I or II titles, not Division V, that earn you
entry into the fraternity of water polo elite. So despite its
impressive resume, Poly continues to fight for respect.</TE>
<TE>   "There is kind of an attitude that we don't know what we're doing
out here and that kind of bothers us," Poly Coach Mark Colwell said.
"But it's hard to compare if we don't play the top teams. How do I
know if we're as good as them unless we play them?"</TE>
<TE>   The Southern Section divisions are broken down geographically,
meaning that Division V, contested primarily by schools in San
Bernardino and Riverside counties, isn't necessarily inferior. But
Division I and II are seen as the highest levels of competition
because they are made up mostly of schools from Orange County and
Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   But Poly made a respectable showing at the South Coast tournament
in Orange County over the weekend. The prestigious tournament
featured eight of the top 10 teams in Division I and six of the top
10 in Division II. Poly finished ninth for the third consecutive
year.</TE>
<TE>   The Bears defeated Laguna Beach and defending Division IV champion
Santa Barbara and lost to La Jolla The Bishop's, a team that also
defeated Newport Harbor and Corona del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we've actually shown we can play with these teams," said
Mike Looy, a senior two-meter man for Poly. "If we play four quarters
of our best polo, we'd be right with them."</TE>
<TE>   The water polo tradition at Poly started with Al Jennings when the
school opened in 1965, but it took off when Dave Almquist took over
as coach in 1977.</TE>
<TE>   Almquist, now the coach at Riverside College, fought hard to get
respect for Poly water polo. He drove to Orange County and met with
coaches from established programs. He lobbied to schedule games and
gain entry into tournaments against top teams. Finally, he persuaded
Bill Barnett of Newport Harbor to give him a chance.</TE>
<TE>   Almquist won four Southern Section titles in his 20 years. His
success earned him a spot as one of Barnett's assistant coaches on
the U.S. men's national team from 1984-88, including the silver
medal-winning Olympic team in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to play in Orange County," Almquist said. "That's where
you find the best competition and we wanted to compete at that level.
I think Riverside polo gets some respect now. There are still some
people in certain areas with the attitude that we can't play, but
it's going away."</TE>
<TE>   One disadvantage Poly continues to face is the lack of a
regulation-sized pool on campus. Most elite teams have them. Another
problem has been the absence of an age-group program to develop young
players.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in Riverside, kids don't exactly dream of becoming
water polo stars. Cody Bartley, the team's leading scorer this year,
didn't consider the sport until a friend mentioned it to him in
junior high.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't even know there was such a thing as water polo," Bartley
said. "And when I tried it, I hated it."</TE>
<TE>   The age-group dilemma has changed. About four years ago, Riverside
Aquatics, a swim club, began a water polo program. Last summer, that
team took third in a national club tournament. Several of those
players are in the freshman class at Poly this year.</TE>
<TE>   "The advantage Orange County schools have always had is that they
get kids who have played all their lives," Colwell said. "We're just
now starting to see the benefits of an established age-group
program."</TE>
<TE>   There is no official movement to get Poly into Division I or II.
To do so would require navigating red tape and convincing other
Sierra League members to join the movement.</TE>
<TE>   So for now, Poly will have to remain content occasionally rubbing
elbows with the elite in tournaments and using those experiences in
pursuit of another Division V title.</TE>
<TE>   "I always thought it would be fun to play in Division I or II,"
Colwell said. "But we take a lot of pride in Division V."</TE>

<LD>   L.A. Loyola vaults from sixth to second after romping to the
Division I title of the Bell-Jeff Invitational at Griffith Park on
Saturday. Although it's unclear if the cumulative time (74 minutes 26
seconds) of the Cubs' top five runners was the fastest run on the
2.8-mile course, the time is 12 seconds faster than a highly regarded
McFarland team ran at the Bell-Jeff meet two years ago. Chino Don
Lugo, with defending state Division I champion Erick Maldonado racing
again, makes its debut in the top 10.</LD>

separate themselves from the pack. The only motivation for Long Beach
Wilson, Rollings Hills Estates Peninsula and Goleta Dos Pueblos might
be breaking 200. All have been under 210 regularly, and Wilson came
close with a 200 last Tuesday at Recreation Park. The Bruins shot 186
two days later, but that was at par-32 Catalina Country Club.

<TE>   Top-ranked Corona del Mar takes on seventh-ranked Rolling Hills
Estates Peninsula today. The Sea Kings were the last team to deny
Peninsula the Southern Section Division I title in 1997. Corona del
Mar hopes to be at full strength, but No. 1 player Anne Yelsey has
yet to play a match and is questionable because of an injured knee.
Second-ranked Palm Desert took over the top spot in the Division II
poll by beating No. 6 Fullerton Troy with depth and doubles strength.
Irvine Woodbridge has tested itself with perhaps the strongest
schedule around. The Warriors went 2-1 last week, defeating Mission
Viejo Capistrano Valley and No. 10 Irvine University while falling to
No. 4 Dana Point Dana Hills.</TE>

finishing second at the Las Vegas Durango tournament, going 6-0
before losing to San Jose Archbishop Mitty in the championship. Los
Alamitos finished fourth at the tournament, Manhattan Beach Mira

<DL></DL>
<LD>This is not what Michael Cammalleri expected when he signed with the
Kings two months ago, giving up his senior season at the University
of Michigan: a red-eye flight home to Toronto late Monday night to
gather himself and then on to Manchester, N.H., to join the Kings'
team in the American Hockey League.</LD>
<LD>   Cammalleri and Jared Aulin were among three players reassigned
Monday by the Kings, leaving only one of the club's ballyhooed
foursome of off-season rookie forward signings, Russian right wing
Alexander Frolov, still on the roster. Cammalleri and Aulin will join
Yanick Lehoux, who was shipped out last week.</LD>
<LD>   Also sent to Manchester was rookie defenseman Joe Corvo.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought I had a pretty strong camp ... and thought I was
progressively getting better," said Cammalleri, who had been
considered a strong candidate to join one of the Kings' top two
lines. "But I guess decisions have been made."</TE>
<TE>   They were made based on performance, Coach Andy Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, if we're being fair in analyzing the camp from Day
1, we feel we have some players that are playing better than them,"
he said of the rookies. "It's not so much them coming up short. It's
other guys stepping up."</TE>
<TE>   Among the 32 players remaining are four rookie forwards, one of
them Scott Barney, 23, who sat out the last three seasons because of
back injuries. The others are Frolov and enforcers Kip Brennan and
Ryan Flinn. Derek Bekar, a 27-year-old veteran of one NHL game, also
made Monday's cut.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty forwards, nine defensemen and three goaltenders remain on
the roster, including defenseman Aaron Miller, who will start the
season on injured reserve, and rookie goaltender B.J. Boxma, who will
be reassigned shortly.</TE>
<TE>   The final cuts, trimming the roster to 23, are expected next week.</TE>

<DH>Pro basketball: O'Neal and Bryant, confident in bid for
fourth straight title, have some pointed remarks for the Kings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kobe Bryant stood to the side of the gym in El Segundo on Monday
afternoon, having reflected on pending fatherhood (a daughter is due
he and wife Vanessa in February), the next Olympics (he's feeling
pangs of participation) and Shaquille O'Neal's return from toe
surgery (everyone, including O'Neal, is rather optimistic).</LD>
<LD>   He covered his shoes (wearing Converse, mulling options, expected
to sign big with Nike), the $55-million contract extension (offered
by the Lakers, not yet accepted by Bryant) and the yoke-like
shoulders he carried through the gym door ("I just went from big to
bigger, from thick to thicker, from swoll to swollen," he said,
laughing).</LD>
<LD>   And, while O'Neal's recovery and Bryant's game were good places to
start on a media day that lacked Coach Phil Jackson, who had a tooth
extracted and probably preferred that process to this, most
conversations turned eventually and predictably to the Sacramento
Kings, convinced Laker nation will be overthrown come spring.</LD>
<TE>   Bryant shrugged and offered a see-you-there smile.</TE>
<TE>   "We ain't going nowhere," he said. "We're right here. They know
where they can find us."</TE>
<TE>   If not at the ring ceremony on Oct. 29, then perhaps on Christmas
Day, the first regular-season game between the Western Conference
finalists. Then, likely, in a playoff series come May. There will be
opportunity to settle this.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever, O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they have what it takes yet," he said. "They have a
lot of good guys, but they have the type of guys that the older they
get, their skills deteriorate. We have guys, the older we get the
better we get. Me being one. Kobe being one. I don't think they'll
ever have what it takes, because they don't have an answer for Kobe
and they don't have an answer for me. They don't have an answer for
Phil. They don't have an answer for our system."</TE>
<TE>   He took a breath.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about momentum," he said. "It's all about luck. It's all
about the way you feel. We've been lucky a few times. We've been
playing good. We have a great organization. One day, it's not going
to be our turn. But I don't think we'll lose it to them."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings don't view it that way. Just recently owner Gavin Maloof
was quoted as saying his club would be "one of the greatest teams
ever" this season, so presumably he'll get to finish that dance atop
the scorer's table.</TE>
<TE>   There's time for all of that.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers start camp today with a mind for a fourth consecutive
NBA championship. O'Neal, not yet three weeks out of surgery, walked
without a limp for the first time in at least a year. Wary of the
anti-inflammatory medication that masked last season's pain, O'Neal
hasn't had even an aspirin since the day after the procedure. He
appeared not the least concerned that his recovery would proceed
without complication, though he and team officials clung to the six-
to eight-week predictions by O'Neal's surgeon. He could not say he
would be playing by opening night, and Laker officials see
Thanksgiving as a worst-case scenario.</TE>
<TE>   If camp could accomplish only one thing, it would be to produce a
healthy, focused O'Neal. If they could ask for two things, the Lakers
would wish for a conditioned O'Neal too. But he appeared trim, almost
certainly leaner than he was at any time last season, and eager to
play again on two sound feet.</TE>
<TE>   While he admitted there were times this summer when he'd gaze into
a mirror and say, "I have three?", the love ends today.</TE>
<TE>   "Once [camp] starts, nobody cares how many championships we've
won," he said. "I want to play like I have no championships at all."</TE>
<TE>   Which, then, brings us to the World Championship, and the stirring
sixth-place finish by a dozen or so uninspired NBA players, a group
that lacked both Laker stars. O'Neal and Bryant said they watched the
debacle, even as league officials and other observers laid some of
the blame for the failure at their vacationing high-tops.</TE>
<TE>   "They can take shots all they want," Bryant said. "But, you have
to know what's important to you. My family's more important to me. My
wife is expecting a child. You want me to go play in the ... World
Championships this summer? I'm not going to do it."</TE>
<TE>   That being said, Bryant said he would consider playing for the
U.S. team in Athens.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say so," he said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, who has an Olympic gold medal, wasn't so eager.</TE>
<TE>   "No, no, no, no," he said. "Especially if George Karl is going to
be the coach."</TE>
<TE>   If Bryant were inclined, General Manager Mitch Kupchak not only
would allow Bryant to play, he would encourage it.</TE>
<TE>   "I would hope so," Kupchak said. "I would hope that's exactly how
all our players feel in this country.</TE>
<TE>   "From our perspective, there's an obvious risk, in fatigue,
burnout. But, can I stand here and say we don't want our players to
participate in the Olympics? I can't say that."</TE>

<HD>Athletics Stand in Way of Twins' Vision Quest</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>The Sons of Contraction are now the Darlings of October, the
warm-and-fuzzy baseball team from America's hinterland that escaped
Commissioner Bud Selig's guillotine and is looking to write a
storybook ending to a season that almost never was.</LD>
<LD>   The Minnesota Twins, it seems, should be happy to be here, happy
to be opening the best-of-five American League division series
against the heavily favored Oakland Athletics today in Network
Associates Coliseum, happy to scrounge for whatever scraps of
recognition and national attention they can find in a series that
will be broadcast by the ABC Family Network opposite the daytime
soaps.</LD>
<LD>   After four straight 90-loss seasons from 1997-2000, the Twins have
returned to the playoffs for the first time since 1991, that magical
worst-to-first season in which they won their second World Series in
five years, but they take exception to those who say they should be
satisfied by their AL Central title.</LD>
<TE>   "You hear people say we have nothing to prove--we have everything
to prove," said Torii Hunter, Minnesota's Gold Glove center fielder.
"We want to win. We want to take it all the way. A lot of people say
we have no chance; we have a big chance. I know we've never been
here, we don't have any postseason experience, but we're ready to
play."</TE>
<TE>   Does that quote have a familiar ring to it? It could have come
from any of the A's two years ago. Way back in 2000, it was the A's
who were brash, young and cocky, an inexperienced team that won the
AL West and took that no-fear attitude into the postseason, losing to
the New York Yankees in a five-game division series.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland went 102-60 last season and again lost to the Yankees in a
five-game division series--after winning the first two games in New
York--and now the A's are the playoff veterans looking to squelch the
upstart.</TE>
<TE>   "They're very excited to be here, but they're not scared, they're
not intimidated one bit," A's third baseman Eric Chavez said of the
Twins.</TE>
<TE>   "They're ready to prove to the world they belong. I see a lot of
ourselves in them. They have a lot of confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Whether that confidence translates into runs against one of
baseball's best rotations will determine whether the Twins upset the
A's. Oakland will go with a three-man rotation of right-hander Tim
Hudson (15-9, 2.98 earned-run average), left-hander Mark Mulder
(19-7, 3.47) and left-hander Barry Zito (23-5, 2.75), a trio that
gives the A's a decided advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "They're three of the best pitchers in baseball," said Brad Radke,
the Twins' Game 1 starter. "It's almost like Randy Johnson and Curt
Schilling--automatic wins."</TE>
<TE>   The Twins have a solid rotation, a deep bullpen, they're more
athletic and have more speed.</TE>
<TE>   They have enough pop to drill the occasional three-run home run,
but they're at their best in low-scoring, close games, preferably in
their artificial turf-covered Metrodome, where they are 54-27,
compared to 40-40 on the road.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, some believe if the Twins can split two games in Oakland,
they could finish off the A's in Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   "They're scrappy," Oakland closer Billy Koch said. "They have some
power, and they can bunt for hits.</TE>
<TE>   "They move guys over, hit and run ... quite frankly, they're
annoying."</TE>

<TE>   *TWIN ANALYSIS</TE>
<TE>   STRENGTHS: The Twins led the league with a .987 fielding
percentage, and their superior team speed plays well on the
artificial turf in the Metrodome, where Minnesota is 54-27 this
season. In his first year as a closer, left-hander Eddie Guardado is
1-3 with a 2.93 earned-run and 45 saves in 51 opportunities, striking
out 70 and walking 18. He has two reliable set-up men in left-hander
J.C. Romero, who is 9-2 with a 1.89 ERA in 81 games and has limited
opponents to a .213 batting average, and right-hander LaTroy Hawkins,
who rebounded from last season's 1-5, 5.96-ERA disaster to go 6-0
with a 2.13 ERA in 65 games.</TE>
<TE>   WEAKNESSES: The Twins have lacked discipline on the basepath,
often getting thrown out at third base, and they have the league's
worst stolen-base success rate, 56%. There are six left-handed
batters in the Twin lineup, and Minnesota hit .252 against
left-handers and was 23-29 against left-handed starters, which could
be a problem against an Oakland team that features two dominant
left-handers in Mark Mulder and Barry Zito. The Twins don't have an
abundance of power, and they have only two players with postseason
appearances on their playoff roster, pitchers Rick Reed and Mike
Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   KEY RESERVES: OF Bobby Kielty (.291, 12 HR, 46 RBIs), INF Denny
Hocking (.250, 2 HR, 25 RBIs).</TE>

<TE>   A'S ANALYSIS</TE>
<TE>   STRENGTHS: The Diamondbacks and Braves may have a better one-two
pitching punch, but few can match the three-deep rotation of the A's,
which features right-hander Tim Hudson and left-handers Mark Mulder
and Barry Zito, who have combined for a 57-21 record this season.
Despite the loss of slugger Jason Giambi to the Yankees and leadoff
batter Johnny Damon to the Red Sox, Oakland is still potent in the
middle of the order with Miguel Tejada, Eric Chavez and Jermaine Dye.
Closer Billy Koch finished with an 11-4 record, 3.27 ERA and 44 saves
in 84 games, and he pitched in several high-intensity situations
during the A's stretch run.</TE>
<TE>   WEAKNESSES: The A's starting pitching is strong, they seem solid
at closer, but they are not very deep in short and middle relief.
Chad Bradford, the team's primary set-up man, has struggled in the
last month, and that could put more pressure on Jim Mecir, Jeff Tam
and Cory Lidle, the team's fourth starter who will move to the
bullpen for this series. With the exception of leadoff batter Ray
Durham, Oakland has little team speed. Terrence Long can be shaky in
center field, David Justice has little range in left, and teams have
been going from first to third on right fielder Dye with regularity.</TE>
<TE>   KEY RESERVES: OF/IF John Mabry (.275, 11 HR, 40 RBIs), DH Olmedo
Saenz (.276, 6 HR, 18 RBIs), C Greg Myers (.222, 6 HR, 21 RBIs)</TE>
<TE>   TEAM BATTING: .261 (Ninth in AL).</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It would be a stretch to describe that 1999 season with the
Albuquerque Dukes as living hell, even though Mickey Hatcher comes
close to doing just that.</LD>
<LD>   Realistically, it was more like living handcuffed.</LD>
<LD>   It was as if every managerial move by Mike Scioscia was
second-guessed or dictated by Rick Sofield or Jim Benedict, the drill
sergeants who were Kevin Malone's minor league field supervisors,
even to the point of Scioscia summoning one pitcher and Benedict
sending in another, even to the point of requiring Sofield's
permission to conduct infield practice, even to the point of Scioscia
canceling an off-day workout because of blazing heat and being
overruled by the cadre.</LD>
<TE>   "Brutal," said Hatcher, Scioscia's hitting coach then and now.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't believe how bad it was."</TE>
<TE>   Hard to believe, indeed.</TE>
<TE>   One minute you're on the inside track to becoming Tom Lasorda's
successor as Dodger manager--"no question about that," said Fred
Claire, the former Dodger general manager--and the next you're a
whipping boy, almost every decision questioned by a new
administration seemingly intent on wiping out every link to what
could be considered Dodger continuity and tradition--23 years in
Scioscia's case.</TE>
<TE>   Now, of course, no one has to be told how it played out.</TE>
<TE>   It is three years later, three years since Sheriff Malone and
posse basically forced Scioscia to leave Dodge and the Dodgers, three
years since he was basically plucked out of the unemployment line by
Bill Stoneman in what many thought was strictly an inexpensive hire,
and Scioscia is leading his red-clad, blue-collar Angels into Yankee
Stadium tonight for the opening game of the division series with the
New York Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   The man in the other dugout is Joe Torre, whose Yankees have won
four of the last six World Series, but it is Scioscia who is drawing
the playoff buzz, who is being touted as the American League's
manager of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Vindication?</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia laughs.</TE>
<TE>   Why would he need vindication? What does he have to prove, and to
whom?</TE>
<TE>   Malone is gone, fired as Dodger general manager and unable to get
a professional baseball job, and Scioscia has only rewarding memories
of those other years as catcher, bench coach and minor league
catching coordinator with the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   No bitterness, he says, no time for it.</TE>
<TE>   After all, he adds, how many qualified baseball men never get the
opportunity he received from the Angels?</TE>
<TE>   Well, OK, if what he has done in restoring stability and
continuity in Anaheim, in winning the respect of his players and
providing a foundation that was the springboard to 99 wins and the
club's first playoff appearance in 16 years (a period in which the
Angels made 13 managerial changes), if all of that doesn't represent
vindication in the context of that infuriating Albuquerque season,
maybe the word is satisfaction.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, but that's not Scioscia either.</TE>
<TE>   The credit here, he says, belongs to the players and to Stoneman
and Bill Bavasi, the general managers who put the Angels together.</TE>
<TE>   What happened in '99 is forgotten history, he says, and the Angels
have simply taken the first step toward the goal of being a perennial
contender.</TE>
<TE>   "That's where this organization needs to be, that would be
satisfaction," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Hatcher doesn't disagree. He suggests, however, that his boss may
be hiding his true feelings regarding '99, absorbing the hit as he
did when catching and unwilling to open old wounds, burn any bridges
or disrupt his current focus.</TE>
<TE>   "Our hands were tied that year," Hatcher said. "It was very
frustrating for Mike and for me. I mean, it was as if the years of
loyalty to the Dodger organization meant nothing, as if everything we
felt in our hearts about the Dodger organization had been ripped out,
and how sad is that to say?</TE>
<TE>   "I'll always have praise for [former Dodger owner] Peter O'Malley,
and it's great to see how Jim Tracy and Dan Evans have brought the
Dodgers back, but it was pretty clear after '99, with the people that
were running it then, that neither Mike nor myself had the future
with the organization we once thought we did or hoped we did."</TE>
<TE>   And now?</TE>
<TE>   "Well," said Hatcher, "for Mike to turn around and get this
opportunity, to put a plan in place as he did, to accomplish what he
has, there's terrific satisfaction.</TE>
<TE>   "I know Mike feels that because I certainly do."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia left the Dodgers after that '99 season. It almost
happened at the end of the '98 season when Davey Johnson was hired as
manager and brought in his own coaches. Scioscia, who had spent two
years as bench coach under Lasorda and Bill Russell, was saved from a
guillotine that claimed such longtime Dodgers as Reggie Smith, Mark
Cresse and Greg "Goose" Goosen, among others, by the organization's
fear of a fan backlash.</TE>
<TE>   He agreed to manage triple-A Albuquerque because he felt it was a
missing piece in his resume. He had no choice but to leave after the
exasperation of '99.</TE>
<TE>   "There were definitely clashes and differences of opinion that
year," Scioscia said, "but that's going to happen when a new regime
comes in and some of it's healthy.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't leave because of that. I left because I wanted to be at
the big league level and that wasn't going to happen with the
Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   "I came out early that winter to give myself the best shot at a
big league job."</TE>
<TE>   A call to Malone, now vice president of development at the
Master's College, was not returned.</TE>
<TE>   Said Claire, who had been fired during the '98 season: "I heard
all the stories about what Mike went through in '99 and it was
absolutely brutal. When [Stoneman] called for a referral, I said,
'Hire him, you'll never regret it.' I mean, all of us knew Mike was
someone with the gift and makeup to be a major league manager. Every
time I talked to him he would say, 'Don't rush me, Fred.' He wanted
to be as prepared as he could be."</TE>
<TE>   Practice. Preparation. Performance.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia said there is nothing special about his philosophy but
that there is no excuse for failing to go hard at every aspect of it.</TE>
<TE>   He has been persistently positive, dogmatically insistent--even
when the Angels were 6-14--that this was a championship-</TE>
<TE>   caliber team ("This is no fluke," he would reiterate Monday) and
so here they are, ready to follow the Scioscia dictate of one game at
a time against the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   For Torre, no surprise.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankee manager said he saw the aggressive, hard-nosed
transformation of the Angels under Scioscia begin last year, sensed
the respect the players had for him because of his credibility as a
player and saw the "fire in his eyes" when he served as an All-Star
coach this year.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the players take a hint from that," Torre said.</TE>
<TE>   Among those players, said Darin Erstad, are no egos or big-name
superstars, "only guys who love to play and grind it out and I think
that's how Scioscia played, from what I've heard, and it's certainly
what he demands."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that will serve the Angels well again, enabling them to
overcome their lack of postseason experience and this business of
Yankee Stadium mystique.</TE>
<TE>   In another borough and time, Scioscia hit a series-turning home
run off Dwight Gooden in Game 4 of the 1988 National League
championship series, helping a similarly underdog and grind-it-out
Dodger team eliminate the Mets before upsetting the heavily favored
Oakland A's in the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "This team," he said of the Angels, "has the same heart and focus
but more talent than that team."</TE>
<TE>   It also has Scioscia to tell them what the postseason is like, but
"there's no such thing as an injection of playoff experience. You've
got to go through it for yourself."</TE>
<TE>   And that's where the Angels are, about to discover October for the
first time in 16 years. And the manager who provided the road map,
who restored stability where so many others had failed, said: "I
don't think we've found a magic button or anything like that. All
we've tried to do is establish an environment conducive to success,
but the accomplishment is that of the players."</TE>
<TE>   In that Albuquerque environment of '99, Scioscia would have been
happy if the pitcher he had called for was the one who showed up.</TE>

<HD>Warner Out 8-10 Weeks Because of Finger Injury</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kurt Warner will be sidelined eight to 10 weeks because of a broken
pinkie on his throwing hand, the latest blow for the winless St.
Louis Rams.</LD>
<LD>   The two-time most valuable player was injured in the first quarter
of Sunday's 13-10 loss to the Dallas Cowboys, which dropped the
defending NFC champions to 0-4, their worst start since 1963. Warner
will have surgery today.</LD>
<LD>   "He's very upset, but he understands," Coach Mike Martz said.
"There's nothing you can do about it."</LD>
<TE>   Two years ago, Warner had surgery on the same finger on his right
hand and missed five games.</TE>
<TE>   It will take longer for him to heal this time because it's a
compound fracture. Martz described the injury as a "T-shaped break at
the base of the finger."</TE>
<TE>   Warner will have pins inserted into his pinkie and should begin
moving the finger in about a month.</TE>
<TE>   The pins will come out after five weeks and X-rays will monitor
the healing process during rehab.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vinny Testaverde has been benched, and the New York Jets will turn
to Chad Pennington to spark the team's mistake-riddled offense.</TE>
<TE>   Pennington, who played most of Sunday's 28-3 loss at Jacksonville
that dropped the Jets to 1-3, will make his first NFL start next
weekend against Kansas City. Pennington, a first-round draft pick in
2000, replaced Testaverde early in the loss to the Jaguars after the
38-year-old Testaverde bruised his shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Offensive lineman Richmond Webb tore a muscle in his chest and is
expected to miss the rest of the season, leaving the Cincinnati
Bengals with yet another major problem.</TE>
<TE>   The Bengals (0-4) will give top draft pick Levi Jones his first
NFL start Sunday in Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago Bear linebacker Warrick Holdman will miss the rest of the
season after having surgery to repair torn cartilage in his right
knee.</TE>
<TE>   Holdman, the Bears' second-leading tackler last season, was hurt
in the first quarter of Sunday's overtime loss in Buffalo. He will
need three months to recover, Coach Dick Jauron said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Seahawk starting guard Steve Hutchinson will be out at
least eight weeks because of a broken right leg and tight end Jerramy
Stevens, the team's top draft choice this year, will be sidelined for
a minimum of three weeks because of a sprained left ankle.</TE>
<TE>   The injuries came in Sunday's 48-23 victory over Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miami Dolphin kick returner Albert Johnson probably will miss the
rest of the season after tearing a knee ligament.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who missed last season with a torn anterior cruciate
ligament in his right knee, tore the same ligament in the left knee
in Sunday's 48-30 loss to Kansas City.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Tennessee Titans probably will be without leading receiver
Derrick Mason and starting cornerback Samari Rolle for at least three
to four weeks. Mason separated his left shoulder and Rolle strained
his right hamstring during Tennessee's 52-25 loss at Oakland on
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Washington Redskin Coach Steve Spurrier said that Kevin Lockett
will start at wide receiver against Tennessee and either Danny
Wuerffel or rookie Patrick Ramsey will get the nod at quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans Saint first-round draft pick Donte Stallworth is
expected to miss next week's game against Pittsburgh because of an
injured left hamstring.</TE>

<HD>Angels Aren't Scaring Anyone in New York</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>I'm sitting in Mickey Mantle's Restaurant on Monday afternoon across
from Central Park, talking up the Angels because no one else is here,
and Celda, the bartender, tells me she's from Santa Monica.</LD>
<LD>   Now I'm celda here, of course, so I'm thinking to myself of all
the gin joints in New York, just my luck, I've probably run into the
only fan in town who doesn't share my fascination with this
Angel-Yankee series--especially after I've made fun of her name and
tell her I celda do that.</LD>
<LD>   "Not quite fascinating," Celda says, and I hope that's an olive
she's dropping into my drink, because I've heard stories about
something called, "Ecstasy," and since I'm married, I know I'm not
supposed to experience anything like that.</LD>
<TE>   "The Angels are just going to be another notch in the Yankees'
belt," Celda says, and I wonder if every Dodger fan is rooting for
the Yankees to beat the Angels, and make Anaheim fans feel as
miserable as Dodger fans.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm no Dodger fan," Celda says, and loud enough so everyone in
the restaurant can hear, and I'd imagine every October shouts like
this can be heard most everywhere in the country: "I'm no Dodger
fan."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IN MY quest to understand the atmosphere that surrounds this
Angel-Yankee series here, I remained at the bar for hours, which is a
good tip for journalism students who want to work at a big paper some
day--do your bar work.</TE>
<TE>   At some point I think I remember speaking to Stefanie Colombatto,
and asking where she was from and what her major was.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm from Orange County," Colombatto said, which probably meant
Anaheim, because everyone I know who lives in Anaheim likes to tell
people they live in Orange County, hoping they might think they
really live in Newport Beach or San Clemente.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no interest in the Angels," she said, and while it made
absolutely no difference to me that Colombatto was extremely
attractive, I decided I'd sit there as long as it took for her to
gain an interest in the Angels, because as we know, only a month ago
no one in Orange County had any interest in the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care about the Angels either and I've got a plane to
catch back to L.A. in an hour," said Gary Nickerson, and so I told
him, "Goodbye."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I WALKED around the restaurant hoping to find someone who might be
concerned about the challenge the Angels pose to the Yankees, but
there were reminders everywhere of the Yankees' 26 World Series
titles.</TE>
<TE>   I made a note of a Mickey Mantle poster, however, that read: "Kids
(8 to 80), Get Mickey Mantle's Batting Secrets Free," and will pass
the address along to Adrian Beltre: Lifebuoy, Box 1443, New York 46,
New York.</TE>
<TE>   I noticed Duke Snider's 1956 Dodger jersey, as well as other items
from the world of football, basketball and boxing, but I couldn't
find anything in the room to suggest the Angels were even in
business. Lots of mention of Mickey, but not one of the mouse.</TE>
<TE>   "The Angels have that Little League-sized guy playing for them,
don't they?" Long Island's Ed Simpson said. "How can they expect to
beat the Yankees if they're playing Little Leaguers?"</TE>
<TE>   I said the Yankees aren't playing the Dodgers, and Simpson's
friend said, "We've got Roger going for us in the opener," and I said
we got that guy who was falsely accused of some sexual thing going
for us.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson said, "The atmosphere in the stadium is just going to be
electric."</TE>
<TE>   Our guys are used to that, I said. "They play in Edison Field."</TE>
<TE>   This was more like it, a little passion, some intensity and I
promised everyone I'd be back Wednesday night and the drinks would be
on sports editor Bill Dwyre if the Angels win the first two games. I
thought it would be impossible, but I think I have some people
rooting for the Angels now, and even liking Dwyre.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IT WAS Fan Appreciation Day at Dodger Stadium on Sunday, and some
fans left feeling downright unappreciated. The Dodgers started a
lineup of minor league players who failed to score, and while they
gave a new car away last year on the final day, this year they did
not.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw the Dodgers field a minor league team and I watched a
boring game," Michael Lewis said. "At the very least I thought
there'd be a chance to win a decent prize in appreciation for
suffering through this season, but they gave gas logs, Avenger
tickets and other prizes I can't remember. I really feel
appreciated."</TE>
<TE>   Lonnie Wagman e-mailed to say, "This was an insult to the
3,331,000 fans who were loyal to this team through their
tribulations. We were there to show appreciation to our team, where
were they? We know they weren't resting up for the postseason. And
the so-called prizes were the worst; the booing was quite intense."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger vice president Derrick Hall, who is in charge of making
things right or making them sound right, said, "We heard from a
number of people who were really excited to see those young guys,"
while admitting the team also heard from unhappy fans.</TE>
<TE>   He said the team gave away around 100 prizes, "and this year," he
said, "we gave away more trips than ever before."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Dodgers provided the Giants with a nice trip to
Atlanta to play the Braves in the first round of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes from the New York Times:</TE>
<TE>   "The first Times' Computer Ranking of 2002, has Notre Dame ranked
as the No. 1 college football team in the nation."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately there are glitches in the machine: USC is ranked No.

<HD>Galaxy Is Hamstrung Against the Wizards</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ and GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Peter Vagenas limped around the Rose Bowl after Galaxy practice
Monday morning, electrodes strapped to his sore right hamstring. The
Galaxy midfielder might have had control over the intensity and speed
with which the leg was stimulated, but that was all he had power
over.</LD>
<LD>   His leg not healing as quickly as he'd like, a frustrated Vagenas
is doubtful for Wednesday night's decisive Game 3 of the Galaxy's
first-round Major League Soccer playoff series against the Kansas
City Wizards.</LD>
<LD>   "It's my worst dream come true, to be honest," said Vagenas, who
played 76 minutes of the Galaxy's 4-1 loss at Kansas City on Saturday
night.</LD>
<TE>   His strained hamstring, suffered in training the week of Sept. 16,
had forced him to sit out the Galaxy's 3-2 overtime win in Game 1
last Wednesday and its 1-0 regular-season finale victory over San
Jose on Sept. 21 that gave the Galaxy the Western Conference crown
and the No. 1 seeding for the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been, in my opinion, the best team [in MLS] the whole
season and it's made up of great individuals, players one through
20," said Vagenas, 24, who also missed the first eight games of the
season because of a strained lower back.</TE>
<TE>   But in Game 2, Kansas City picked apart the Galaxy midfield and
Preki, the Wizards' 39-year-old offense-minded midfielder, has been
having his way with the Galaxy.</TE>
<TE>   Preki's five points (two goals, one assist) have him tied with
Galaxy forward Carlos Ruiz (two goals, one assist) and the Columbus
Crew's Freddy Garcia (two goals, one assist) for the league's playoff
scoring lead.</TE>
<TE>   Making Preki's accomplishments against the Galaxy all the more
frustrating is that Vagenas has had success containing Preki in his
career.</TE>
<TE>   But that was when Vagenas was sound. Should Vagenas be unable to
go Wednesday, the Galaxy may duplicate its lineup of Game 1, when it
started Chris Albright at forward, moved Cobi Jones to the midfield
and had midfielder Simon Elliott pick up most of the defensive duties
against Preki.</TE>
<TE>   Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid will also have to determine which way to
go with playmaking midfielder Mauricio Cienfuegos, whom he benched to
start the second half of Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   Cienfuegos, like Jones an original member of the Galaxy from 1996,
said the entire team was to blame for Saturday's blowout loss, not
just the midfield.</TE>
<TE>   "We came onto the field thinking we were the superior team,"
Cienfuegos said. "It was one of those nights where you take the field
believing in yourself but at the end, nothing works."</TE>
<TE>   And with the Galaxy midfield in seeming disarray, the biggest
question before Game 3 involves Vagenas and his hamstring.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as the team's concerned, my injury is the least of our
[worries]," said Vagenas, who limped through his first goal-less MLS
season after getting three goals in each of his first two MLS
campaigns. "I have every faith that these guys will get the job
done."</TE>

<TE>   Meza Fired By Atlas</TE>
<TE>   Enrique Meza, former coach of Mexico's national team, was fired as
coach of Atlas of Guadalajara after the Mexican league team was
routed, 5-2, at home Sunday by Queretaro and fell to 3-7. No
replacement was named.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Paraguayan striker Jose Cardozo remained the league's
top goal scorer when he increased his tally to 13 goals in 10 games
by banging three past hapless goalkeeper Jorge Campos in Toluca's 5-0
rout of Puebla.</TE>
<TE>   Club America remained unbeaten at 8-0-2 when it tied Monterrey,
0-0, but the defending league champion did lose interim Coach Mario
Carillo, who stepped aside to make way for the return of Manuel
Lapuente, who had taken a two-month leave of absence.</TE>

<TE>   South Korea Wins Again</TE>
<TE>   South Korea virtually assured itself a place in the quarterfinals
of the Asian Games when it routed Oman, 5-2, in Pusan, South Korea.
Lee Chun-Soo scored two of the goals, with Cho Sung-Hwan, Kim Du-Hyun
and Lee Dong-Gook getting the others for South Korea, which defeated
the Maldive Islands, 4-1, in its opening game.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Peter Velappan, general secretary of the Asian Football
Confederation, criticized South Korea's "Red Devil" fans for not
turning out in the same large numbers they had for the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "They are either asleep or have lost their energy and excitement
for football all of a sudden," Velappan said. "It is like inviting a
guest to your house and then leaving before they arrive."</TE>

<TE>   Wembley Comes Down</TE>
<TE>   Demolition work has begun on Wembley Stadium in London, site of
the 1948 Olympic Games made famous by the achievements of such
athletes as Emil Zatopek and Fanny-Blankers Koen; the 1963
heavyweight title fight between Henry Cooper and the then-Cassius
Clay, later Muhammad Ali; and innumerable historic soccer games,
among them England's 1966 World Cup triumph over West Germany.</TE>
<TE>   A $1.17 billion, 90,000-seat stadium will replace the one being

<TE>   Lalor To Spirit</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego Spirit of the Women's United Soccer Assn. acquired
U.S. women's national team midfielder Jen Lalor from the New York
Power as part of a five-player, two-draft-pick trade, the largest in
WUSA history.</TE>
<TE>   The Spirit also obtained forward Wynne McIntosh and the first pick

<LD>Rites of passage are important to teenagers. They don't forget their
first dance, first kiss or first speeding ticket.</LD>
<LD>   Two years ago, quarterback Brian White of Mission Viejo Trabuco
Hills High achieved what he viewed as a meaningful milestone by
beating his father, Mark, in a game of one-on-one basketball.</LD>
<LD>   "That was an exciting day, a big accomplishment," Brian said.</LD>
<TE>   Added his father: "I was gasping for air and he was laughing."</TE>
<TE>   Mark was a starting linebacker at Bowling Green. He's a big man--6
feet 3 and 260 pounds. Since T-ball, he has been Brian's constant
workout partner, coach and friend. He's the one who approved buying
10 footballs at $25 apiece and purchasing a net last summer so his
son could throw the ball repeatedly to improve his accuracy.</TE>
<TE>   All summer, Mark, 40, would try to intimidate Brian as if he were
encountering a real linebacker.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd chase him down so he had to learn to throw under pressure,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The son wants to experience playing college football like his
father, and he's going to get the chance.</TE>
<TE>   White is a 6-5, 220-pound senior with a relentless work ethic that
will open doors to his dream.</TE>
<TE>   "He's by far the best I've coached in terms of being able to go on
to the next level and be a success," said Trabuco Hills Coach Bill
Crow, in this 36th year of coaching.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, White rarely had time to throw. It was a weekly
exercise in survival. After games, he'd come home battered and
bruised.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it was tough telling where the black and blue was and
where the skin tone was," Mark said.</TE>
<TE>   White never lost confidence. He kept trying to get better. He knew
that life as a quarterback requires taking hits and showing
leadership in good and bad circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   He committed himself this summer to raising his game. He threw
over and over into the net.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd throw balls until his arm fell off," Mark said.</TE>
<TE>   He ran "net burners" in 90-degree temperature with his uncle,
running back and forth across a tennis court, hurdling over the net
even when he was exhausted.</TE>
<TE>   He attended football camps at Washington, Ohio State and Colorado,
determined to improve.</TE>
<TE>   "I came away from each camp learning something different," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   White's early-season play for Trabuco Hills (2-1) indicates that
his quarterback skills are rapidly improving.</TE>
<TE>   In a game against Laguna Hills, he completed 17 of 22 passes for
281 yards and four touchdowns. Last week, he rallied the Mustangs
from a 14-point, second-half deficit to tie Villa Park before losing,
31-24. He finished with 258 yards passing.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, White didn't let a 25-yard interception return for
a touchdown on the opening series affect him. He showed resiliency,
patience and maturity. Afterward, even though he and his teammates
received a loud, piercing lecture from Crow for mental mistakes, he
was already looking forward to his next chance.</TE>
<TE>   "I still have a lot of improvement to do," he said. "This game was
a perfect example. I'm not perfect and neither is anyone else on this
team. There's stuff we need to do."</TE>
<TE>   It takes years of experience to play quarterback. Most are only
good enough to play at the high school level because they can't cross
the mental and physical barriers that separate high school from
college.</TE>
<TE>   Because of White's size, strength and athleticism, he has the
physical makeup to play in college. He was a three-sport athlete
until giving up baseball last season. And his father has been
patiently preparing him for what he'll face in college, where
everyone is good and no one succeeds by taking a shortcut.</TE>
<TE>   That fateful day when White beat his father for the first time in
basketball meant something. Everything changed. The boy was no longer
a boy. The father was no longer the best athlete in the family.</TE>
<TE>   A rite of passage was complete, with more to come.</TE>

<HD>Blanton Makes Most of His Opportunity</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA tackle Ed Blanton did not know he would make his first start
until less than 24 hours before the team took the field against San
Diego State. The redshirt freshman had never practiced with the first
team.</LD>
<LD>   Yet when senior Mike Saffer broke a rib while coughing on Friday,
Blanton was thrust into the lineup. And Blanton made an impact
befitting his 6-foot-9, 330-pound build.</LD>
<LD>   "He's the mountain man," UCLA Coach Bob Toledo said. "He didn't
give up a sack, he knew who to block. He's athletic, tough,
competitive and gives great second effort."</LD>
<TE>   Toledo told Saffer, who was in street clothes for the game, to
give Blanton pointers every time he came off the field. In the second
quarter Saffer said to the coach, "He doesn't need my help. He's
doing a great job out there."</TE>
<TE>   After watching film, Toledo concurred.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just hoping this kid could get us through the game," he
said, "and we found a guy with a great future."</TE>
<TE>   Blanton will continue to start until Saffer is ready to return,
which could be sooner than anticipated. Saffer said Monday that he
thinks he can play against Oregon State, although trainers said that
is wishful thinking.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With the beginning of UCLA's Pacific 10 Conference schedule, Drew
Olson's stints spelling Cory Paus are over.</TE>
<TE>   The freshman quarterback appeared in three of the four
nonconference games, to gain experience in case of an injury to Paus.
Olson completed four of eight passes for 46 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Olson's best moment came in the opener against Colorado State when
he led the Bruins to a decisive score. But since then, he has made
rookie mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   "These games count now and Cory is playing until the game is
decided," Toledo said. "Drew has learned a lot, and he has a lot more
to learn."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After rushing for 76 yards against San Diego State, Manuel White
has pulled even with Akil Harris at tailback on the depth chart.
White is still listed as the starting fullback as well.</TE>
<TE>   "When we come out in one-back sets, Manuel will be the one back,"
Toledo said. "He's got to stay on the field."</TE>
<TE>   White is the Bruins' leading rusher with 231 yards, averaging 4.8
yards a carry. Harris gained 38 yards in 20 carries in the last two
games.</TE>

<TE>   C.J. Niusulu has a court hearing in his hometown of Barstow today.
The freshman defensive end is charged with felony battery stemming
from an incident at a drive-in theater in July.</TE>

<KH>USC REPORT</KH>
<HD>Riley Getting Better</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC's defense is ranked No. 1 in the nation, and senior nose tackle
Bernard Riley said Monday that the Trojans are positioned to maintain
their lofty status despite a Pacific 10 Conference game with
preseason favorite Washington State this weekend.</LD>
<LD>   "As long as we keep doing the things we did against Oregon State,
there's no telling how good we can be," Riley said.</LD>
<LD>   Riley, a senior who is coming back from off-season surgery on his
right knee, rotated in for 21 plays during USC's 22-0 victory over
Oregon State, his longest stint this season.</LD>
<TE>   He made two tackles, pressured quarterback Derek Anderson and kept
Trojan sophomore Mike Patterson fresh to do the same.</TE>
<TE>   "We need him for his senior leadership and for the rush he gives
us inside," said Ed Orgeron, USC's defensive line coach. "He did a
heck of a job and is getting better and better."</TE>
<TE>   Riley, who is 6 feet 3 and weighs 320 pounds, started the first
five games last season before tearing ligaments in his knee. He was
limited because of soreness during training camp and said he still
feels discomfort after games and practices, but not enough to keep
him from helping a unit that is giving up only 205 yards a game.</TE>
<TE>   "When you think about your injuries that's when you get hurt
again," he said. "I just go out there with the mentality that it's
better.</TE>
<TE>   "The more playing time, the better. But as long as we win, it
doesn't matter."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Redshirt sophomore Jason Leach worked with the first-team defense
in place of senior free safety DeShaun Hill, who participated only in
light drills after injuring his left shoulder against Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   Hill said X-rays taken Monday showed no fractures and that he will
play Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Leach tackled Oregon State punter Carl Tobey at the Beavers'
12-yard line after a low snap to set up USC's second touchdown. He
also made another tackle and helped shut down Oregon State's passing
attack.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to approach it like I'm going to start," Leach said.
"DeShaun's probably going to come back, but I have to be ready."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To shore up the continuing depth problem at receiver, walk-on
cornerback Forrest Mozart moved to offense. Sandy Fletcher switched
from safety to receiver last week but suffered a high ankle sprain
against Oregon State. Grant Mattos, who missed the Oregon State game
because of an abdominal strain, practiced and might be available
against Washington State, but Jason Mitchell is still having back
problems and probably will not play, Coach Pete Carroll said.... Left
tackle Jacob Rogers, who suffered a sprained knee Saturday, underwent
an MRI exam Monday and did not practice. He will practice lightly the
rest of the week and could play against the Cougars, Carroll said....
Running back Darryl Poston sat out practice because of continuing
back problems.... USC's Oct. 12 game against California at the
Coliseum will begin at 3:30 p.m. and will be televised nationally by
Fox Sports Net.</TE>

<LD>A man arrested with a gun in his luggage as he boarded a London-bound
plane was released from Swedish custody, as prosecutors admitted they
did not have evidence that he intended to hijack the flight.</LD>
<LD>   Kerim Chatty, 29, was held for four weeks on suspicion of planning
a hijacking and illegal possession of a weapon.</LD>
<LD>   Chief prosecutor Thomas Haeggstroem said he had not ruled out the
hijacking charge but decided there was not enough evidence to keep
Chatty in jail as the probe continues. However, Chatty must remain in
the Stockholm area and report regularly to police.</LD>

<LD>A top suspect in Rwanda's 1994 genocide has been arrested in Congo
and sent to face charges before an international tribunal, in a move
hailed by Rwandan government officials and massacre survivors as a
step toward justice.</LD>
<LD>   Tribunal authorities said Tharcisse Renzaho, who was governor of
Kigali, the Rwandan capital, and its vicinity during the genocide,
was arrested in Congo on Sunday and flown to the tribunal in Arusha,
Tanzania.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors believe Renzaho was one of the organizers of the 1994
massacre, which lasted 100 days and killed 800,000 people, mostly
Tutsis and moderate Hutus.</LD>

<LD>Thousands of businesses in crime-plagued Rio de Janeiro shut down
after powerful drug lords reportedly ordered a lockdown.</LD>
<LD>   Police pleaded for storekeepers--including some in the city center
and the posh South Zone, with its famous Copacabana and Ipanema
beaches--not to cave in to the pressure.</LD>
<LD>   Gangs control hundreds of Rio's shantytowns and often order shops
and schools to close when a prominent gang member is arrested or
killed. Media reports said Monday's shutdown was ordered to protest
jail conditions for notorious drug lord Luiz Fernando da Costa, also
known as Freddy Seashore.</LD>

<LD>Former Bosnian Serb commander Ljubomir Borovcanin has been indicted
on charges of genocide for the 1995 slaying of as many as 8,000
Muslim men and boys in the eastern Bosnian enclave of Srebrenica, the
U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague said.</LD>
<LD>   Borovcanin was secretly indicted Sept. 6, but judges unsealed the
indictment after prosecutors decided there was no reason to continue
keeping it secret. A prosecution spokeswoman said Borovcanin had been
about to turn himself in but had disappeared.</LD>
<LD>   Borovcanin, 42, was involved in numerous opportunistic killings
after Serbian forces captured men and boys from the U.N. "safe area"
of Srebrenica, the indictment said.</LD>

<LD>New American food sales to Cuba reached nearly $90 million Monday at
an agribusiness fair aimed at whetting the Communist island's
appetite for U.S. farm products and chipping away at the 40-year U.S.
trade embargo, Cuban officials said.</LD>
<LD>   As the fair neared the end of its last day Monday, Cuban officials
said they had signed contracts for about $89 million in U.S. farm
products--almost double what they initially hoped for.</LD>
<LD>   Deals for as much as $13 million more in sales were still being
discussed and will probably be announced in coming days, said Pedro
Alvarez, head of the Cuban food import concern Alimport.</LD>
<TE>   "The embargo has been weakening," President Fidel Castro said
Monday afternoon after signing one of the largest contracts of the
fair, a $17.1-million deal for corn, soybeans, soybean oil and turkey
drumsticks with Cargill Inc. of Minneapolis.</TE>

<HD>EU Sides With U.S. on War Court</HD>
<DH>Justice: Ministers reach a deal to bar extradition of any
accused American officials or military personnel if Washington
guarantees that suspects will be tried at home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>BRUSSELS</DL>
<LD>The European Union agreed on a compromise plan Monday to spare
Americans the fate of standing trial in the new international war
crimes court, but the bloc immediately came under criticism for
caving in to U.S. pressure.</LD>
<LD>   EU foreign ministers reached a deal among themselves that in
effect prevents them from extraditing U.S. soldiers or government
officials to the International Criminal Court as long as Washington
guarantees that any Americans suspected of war crimes will be tried
in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration has asked countries for blanket exemptions
from the court, fearing Americans could face politically motivated
trials stemming from peacekeeping or other military operations in
areas of war or crisis. So far, a dozen nations have signed immunity
deals with the U.S.</LD>
<TE>   But critics of the EU move said the bloc papered over its own
fundamental disagreements on the issue to end a standoff that has
compounded weeks of transatlantic tension over Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The foreign ministers approved guidelines under which member
states can agree not to hand Americans suspected of war crimes over
to the court.</TE>
<TE>   "If individual states stay within these red lines ... the court
will not be undermined," Danish Foreign Minister Per Stig Moeller
said. "There is no concession here. There is no undermining of the
ICC."</TE>
<TE>   The agreement may open the way for Britain, Italy and Spain, whose
leaders are President Bush's closest European allies, to strike
immunity deals with the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Those EU members that oppose such accords may nevertheless apply
other, existing agreements to keep Americans out of the court. For
instance, soldiers stationed abroad are usually exempt from
prosecution in the nation where they are based under existing
accords.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher declined
to take an immediate position on the latest proposals. "We'll study
the details of the European Union's decision very closely, and we
look forward to discussing it in more detail with member states," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The EU foreign ministers said they will not exempt their nationals
from any trial in the ICC, the first permanent international tribunal
to judge individuals for war crimes, which opened for business in The
Hague in July.</TE>
<TE>   EU governments have been under pressure from human rights groups
and the European Parliament not to give in to Washington's push for
immunity deals.</TE>
<TE>   The human rights group Amnesty International dubbed Monday's
agreement "a step back" and said it gave a green light to non-EU
countries that had been hesitating to sign immunity deals with the
United States.</TE>

<HD>Weapons Inspectors Report Progress in Talks</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: A member of U.N. team says the Iraqi delegation
has been 'positive, businesslike' but that critical issues remained
unresolved.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VIENNA</DL>
<LD>United Nations weapons inspectors reported progress Monday in their
first day of discussions with Iraqi representatives but said crucial
issues, including those involving access to sensitive sites, remained
unresolved.</LD>
<LD>   The talks are slated to be completed today.</LD>
<LD>   Weapons inspectors are pushing for agreement from the Iraqis to
give them greater freedom to search for nuclear, biological and
chemical weapons and ballistic missiles than they had when they left
in December 1998.</LD>
<TE>   "They've been positive, businesslike, and they are coming with a
desire to reach an agreement," Mohamed ElBaradei, the director
general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said of the
Iraqis. The IAEA is responsible for nuclear arms inspections.</TE>
<TE>   "We aim to restore as much of 'any time, any place, unfettered
access' ... as possible," he said.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. resolutions setting up the weapons inspection system, first
instituted after the Persian Gulf War in 1991, require "immediate,
unconditional and unrestricted" access to all sites. But those
conditions gradually eroded, and the Iraqis ultimately refused
altogether to cooperate with the inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   The Vienna talks, held at IAEA headquarters, are the first test of
Iraq's willingness to cooperate since Baghdad agreed Sept. 16 to the
unconditional return of the inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   A senior diplomat close to the talks said U.N. officials had made
clear to the Iraqis that they could show good faith by offering to
open up sites where inspectors' freedom previously had been limited.
Those include the so-called presidential palaces, actually a number
of sprawling compounds around the country.</TE>
<TE>   Unless the Iraqis open them voluntarily, new action by the
Security Council will be necessary. Access to the palaces was
restricted by a 1998 memorandum approved by the Security Council,
according to senior diplomats. Because the status of those sites is a
Security Council matter, the U.N. officials in Vienna are not
broaching the subject officially.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the status of dozens of places, including the
Ministries of Defense and Intelligence, to which the Iraqis have
limited the inspectors' access, is a significant topic.</TE>
<TE>   ElBaradei and Hans Blix, the U.N.'s chief weapons inspector, who
is responsible for chemical and biological weapons as well as
ballistic missiles, led the U.N. team in the meetings. Amir Saadi, a
special advisor to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, led the
nine-member Iraqi delegation.</TE>
<TE>   Blix said that in previous discussions aimed at restarting
inspections, the Iraqis had been unwilling to focus on the most
important issues. On Monday, however, they came "willing to talk,"
Blix said. He described the Iraqi negotiators as businesslike and
knowledgeable.</TE>
<TE>   The Vienna discussions are taking place in the midst of an
aggressive political campaign by President Bush and British Prime
Minister Tony Blair to win the backing of other U.N. Security Council
members for a tough new resolution authorizing the use of force if
Iraq fails to disarm quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said Monday that he was pleased
with progress during negotiations at the U.N. and abroad over the
weekend on a new U.N. resolution.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty much unfolding the way I thought it would," he said
in an interview on PBS' "NewsHour With Jim Lehrer." Powell said the
Bush administration is committed to a single resolution that outlines
a three-pronged U.N. strategy to force Iraq to disarm, resisting
pressure from France and Russia to leave the issue of using
force--should Baghdad fail to surrender its deadliest weapons--to a
second resolution.</TE>
<TE>   But France, Russia and China are still objecting to the
U.S.-British proposal. Still, some new resolution seems likely.</TE>
<TE>   A British envoy handed the draft of the U.S.-British proposal to
Chinese officials in Beijing on Monday, but China continued to oppose
the push for a new resolution authorizing the use of force.</TE>
<TE>   In Moscow, Russian President Vladimir V. Putin showed no sign of
softening Russia's stance.</TE>
<TE>   Before meeting Monday in Moscow with visiting Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon, Putin said Russia's position remains that no
new Security Council resolution is needed. "Today's main task is to
bring international observers back to Iraq in order to solve the
problems," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Russia has strong economic ties with Iraq, including potentially
lucrative agreements to help Baghdad develop its oil industry
whenever U.N. sanctions are lifted. In recent years, Russia has
functioned as Iraq's chief defender among the permanent members of
the Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   But there was speculation in Moscow on Monday that Russia might be
willing to abandon the Iraqi regime if it receives a green light from
the U.S. to pursue Chechen rebels in neighboring Georgia. Russia
believes separatist fighters have been using Georgia's Pankisi Gorge
as a refuge.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq on Saturday rejected the U.S.-British proposal for a tough
new weapons inspection program. It is unclear how it would respond to
new demands from the Security Council that are less stringent.</TE>
<TE>   A new resolution could have a large impact on the inspectors' work
by opening up more sites for surprise inspections.</TE>
<TE>   Although it looms in the background at the Vienna talks, a
possible new resolution has not come up so far. Senior diplomats
close to the talks said they thought it was unlikely that one of the
elements of the resolution--an armed force to back up the
inspectors--would make much difference.</TE>
<TE>   One of the sticking points so far in the talks is the status of
"sensitive sites," dozens of buildings including such government
agencies as the Ministries of Intelligence and Defense.</TE>
<TE>   While inspectors were permitted to enter these sites in the past,
the Iraqis limited their numbers and required that they be
accompanied by a senior Iraqi official. The latter demand often meant
delays of several hours before inspectors could enter--potentially
enough time to hide evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Other unresolved issues include whether inspectors will be allowed
to open two new bases inside Iraq and whether they will be able to
fly and land where they need to in order to do the inspections.</TE>
<TE>   At the Pentagon on Monday, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld
said Iraq has stepped up attacks in the past two weeks on U.S. and
British aircraft patrolling "no-fly" zones established over northern
and southern Iraq after the Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   "With each missile launched at our air crews, Iraq expresses its
contempt for the U.N. resolutions," Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   Since its offer two weeks ago to readmit weapons inspectors,
Rumsfeld said, Iraq has fired on coalition aircraft in the no-fly
zones on 67 occasions, including 14 times last weekend. Since the
beginning of the year, coalition planes have come under fire in the
zones 406 times, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld's comments came during a lengthy presentation in which
the Pentagon for the first time aired footage of American and British
planes coming under Iraqi fire. The presentation might have been
designed in part to deflect criticism over more aggressive moves by
the United States in recent weeks in the no-fly zones.</TE>
<TE>   For years, coalition pilots have mainly returned fire on weapons
sites. But Rumsfeld ordered a change over the last six months,
broadening the list of targets coalition pilots could strike. Last
week, American and British warplanes hit an airport and radar
facility in southern Iraq. Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Monday that the U.S. was recently
successful in striking a "major node" of the fiber-optic cable that
links Iraq's air defense system.</TE>

<DL>YAMOUSSOUKRO, Ivory Coast</DL>
<LD>Government soldiers claimed Monday that they had inflicted heavy
losses on rebel forces in Ivory Coast, while French troops in jeeps
with mounted guns scoured the countryside in search of isolated
Westerners who might need rescue in case of all-out war.</LD>
<LD>   Trying to avert a bloody showdown, West African foreign ministers
flew into the commercial capital, Abidjan, on Monday to talk with the
rebels and try to persuade them to agree to a cease-fire.</LD>
<LD>   Mediators included foreign ministers from Nigeria, Ghana and Togo.
The delegation planned to meet with the shadowy rebels, Ghanaian
Foreign Minister Hackman Owusu-Agyeman said, confirming that the
envoys had managed to identify those they believe are leading the
insurgency.</LD>
<TE>   Launching their rebellion with a bloody coup attempt Sept. 19,
rebels took and held control of the central city of Bouake and of
Korhogo in the north. Insurgents since have grabbed other cities,
splitting what was once one of West Africa's most stable nations into
rebel- and loyalist-held zones.</TE>
<TE>   Western military officials on Monday reported clashes across the
north, with one front line around Tiebissou, north of Yamoussoukro,
the capital.</TE>

<HD>Koizumi Shakes Up His Cabinet</HD>
<DH>Japan: Key among the prime minister's changes is the
replacement of the top banking regulator in bid to clean up the
sector and boost the economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE REITMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>An official who already serves as the minister for economics and
fiscal policy will take on responsibility for cleaning up Japan's
banking sector as Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi responds to
growing international pressure to revive the economy.</LD>
<LD>   As part of a Cabinet shakeup Monday, Koizumi fired a top economic
advisor who had balked at instituting aggressive financial reform
measures. He reappointed a dozen ministers, including most of those
holding key posts. Five were replaced, including the agriculture
minister, who had been criticized for his handling of Japan's "mad
cow" disease outbreak, and the defense minister, whose agency had
been criticized for collecting data on those who submitted freedom of
information requests.</LD>
<LD>   But the most significant change was the replacement of Hakuo
Yanagisawa, who as head of the Financial Services Agency was Japan's
top banking regulator. He had objected to using public money to help
banks write off their nonperforming loans.</LD>
<TE>   Yanagisawa's job will be assumed by Heizo Takenaka, who will
continue in his Cabinet post as economics and fiscal policy minister.
Yanagisawa and Takenaka were known to disagree about how best to
resolve Japan's bad-loan mess.</TE>
<TE>   Koizumi termed the nonperforming loans the biggest obstacle to
reforming the economy, which he says is his top priority.</TE>
<TE>   "The bad loans have been a shackle on reform," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the few Cabinet ministers who are not members of parliament,
Takenaka, 51, previously taught economics at Keio University and has
taught at Harvard. Past banking regulators, including Yanagisawa,
have been career bureaucrats, long viewed as being too cozy with the
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Takenaka vowed to "fix whatever needs fixing."</TE>
<TE>   The Financial Services Agency has put the total of nonperforming
loans--those made by banks to companies that haven't kept up with
interest payments--at $400 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Takenaka has said publicly that the figure is too low. Analysts
suspect that the true figure might be two or three times higher.
Banks have been reluctant to write off the bad loans or set aside
reserves to cover them for fear of eroding their capital base.</TE>
<TE>   Koizumi's vow to get tougher on the bad-loan problems came after
Japan was embarrassed in a Washington meeting of international
finance ministers and bankers last weekend. The International
Monetary Fund urged Japan, which remains the world's second-largest
economy, to vigorously promote restructuring of its banking and
corporate sectors and clean up its bad loans.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese officials couldn't seem to agree among themselves about a
solution to the banking problems. Finance Minister Masajuro Shiokawa
said he told U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill that it was
possible to inject public money into the cleanup effort. But
bureaucrats at Shiokawa's ministry denied that he had talked about a
bailout. Shiokawa later angrily insisted to reporters that he had
meant what he said. Shiokawa was one of those reappointed Monday by
the prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill said he left the meeting with Shiokawa without a clear
sense of Japan's course.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not come away with an understanding of how these particular
interventions are going to contribute to the change," O'Neill said.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's economy has been mired in deflation and a decade-long
slump. Its stock market, which peaked in 1989, has tumbled to 19-year
lows. Businesses have failed and land values have plummeted. Because
property values have plunged, many loans are believed to exceed their
collateral property values.</TE>
<TE>   The Financial Services Agency was set up in 1998 to review bad
assets and force banks to write them off. Legislation was enacted
that called for aggressive penalties against banks with inadequate
capital. But so far, relatively few of the loans have been disposed
of.</TE>
<TE>   Opinion is divided about whether Takenaka can change Japan's
financial course.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Feldman, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Japan Ltd.,
heralded Takenaka's appointment as "a new dawn."</TE>
<TE>   "They need somebody on top with a different way of thinking," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Tetsuro Sugiura, chief economist at Mizuho Research
Institute in Tokyo, said that if Takenaka moves too aggressively he
could make Japan's economic problems worse.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's central bank was so concerned about the nonperforming
loans that it said last month it would purchase stock shares from
banks to help them accelerate the disposal of bad loans.</TE>
<TE>   Koizumi said that the government and the Bank of Japan are
coordinating policy and that he hopes to resolve the problem by 2004.</TE>

<HD>China's Leader Campaigning for Cult Status</HD>
<DH>Politics: The president wants people to say 'Jiang' with
the same reverence as 'Mao' and 'Deng.' The trouble is, he's just not
exciting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>It's hard to create a cult of personality when so many people think
you don't have one.</LD>
<LD>   That's the tough lesson China's No. 1 leader, President Jiang
Zemin, has learned, despite a media offensive by his handlers that
would put many U.S. politicians to shame.</LD>
<LD>   He kisses babies, sings at state banquets and hires pollsters to
tell him how he's doing. His face is plastered on billboards and book
covers. Like his two iconic predecessors, Mao Tse-tung and Deng
Xiaoping, he goes swimming for the cameras to demonstrate his vigor.</LD>
<TE>   But to many Chinese, Jiang, 76, still cuts a colorless figure.</TE>
<TE>   "Jiang Zemin is like an old lady," one veteran Communist Party
member in Beijing said disdainfully.</TE>
<TE>   By all accounts, the bespectacled, bookish-looking Jiang is
desperate to be elevated into the Chinese pantheon alongside Mao, the
founder of the People's Republic, and Deng, the mentor who plucked
Jiang almost out of nowhere to be his successor.</TE>
<TE>   Yet despite holding all the most important titles in
China--president, party secretary and head of the military--Jiang is
far less powerful than the two men before him, who ruled with
absolute authority based on their status as heroes of the Communist
revolution.</TE>
<TE>   These days, Jiang's leadership is under the microscope as China
gears up for its 16th Communist Party Congress, a crucial political
gathering held every five years and due to begin Nov. 8. All eyes are
fixed on the Chinese president to see whether he will step down from
his post of party chief, as widely expected, or hang on to power.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever his intentions, there is no question that Jiang and his
supporters have been trying for years to burnish his image through an
aggressive public-relations campaign, including frequent photo ops
with world leaders such as the one he will no doubt participate in
with President Bush at the American leader's Texas ranch this month.</TE>
<TE>   Jiang's concern--some call it an obsession--about his public
persona is not simply a function of vanity, although those who have
met him say there seems no shortage of that. It is also, analysts
say, a political ploy, part of a wider effort over the last decade to
strengthen his position and ensure that his influence endures even if
he steps down in November.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Skepticism in Air</TE>
<TE>   Jiang doesn't boast the pedigree of Mao or Deng. At the same time,
20 years of breakneck social and economic change have given rise to a
better-educated, more sophisticated and more skeptical Chinese
populace than ever before, open to outside influences and
information--some of it highly unflattering to its unelected leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Hence Jiang's unrelenting media blitz, which aims to establish him
firmly in the public's eyes as the rightful heir to the throne.</TE>
<TE>   Jiang, observers say, has spent more time and effort cultivating
his image than other Chinese leaders, going so far as to discreetly
hire a PR firm back in 1997 to find out how people rated his
performance in presiding over Hong Kong's return to Beijing's
control.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a new situation," said Victor Yuan, the founder of
an independent polling firm in Beijing that has researched popular
attitudes about government. "In the U.S., politicians, at least on
the face of it, say they try to please the public. Here, people are
not voters; they still [can only] listen to their leaders. But those
leaders are starting to think about public opinion."</TE>
<TE>   Such opinion still has extremely limited impact on a system that
eschews public accountability. Power in China continues to flow
mainly from back-room deals, tight political control and other
undemocratic practices by the Communist Party.</TE>
<TE>   But the current regime has staked its legitimacy on its ability to
deliver prosperity to the nation's 1.3 billion people and to turn
China into a major player on the world stage. Popular opinion can no
longer be written off, even if it's not yet the direct key to power.</TE>
<TE>   Gone are the days when Mao or Deng could remain the unquestioned
ruler of China whatever the results of his policies.</TE>
<TE>   Mao was revered as the Great Helmsman despite disastrous mistakes
such as the Great Leap Forward of the 1950s--a collectivization
program in which a staggering 30 million people died of
starvation--and the anarchic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.</TE>
<TE>   Deng, too, remained "paramount leader" through and after the 1989
Tiananmen Square massacre, although he held no formal titles by the
time of his death except honorary president of a charity and of
China's Bridge Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Jiang is a cautious technocrat, not an inspirational revolutionary
or visionary. His political credentials come from a Shanghai
university and a Soviet car factory, not the legendary Long March of
the 1930s, the crucible that yielded the early leaders of the
People's Republic.</TE>
<TE>   He has had to rely instead on astute political maneuvering to
knock off his rivals ever since Deng anointed him party chief right
after the Tiananmen Square massacre.</TE>
<TE>   His handlers have striven to portray Jiang as a modernizer in tune
with the times, a progressive thinker who wants to broaden the
Communist Party to include not just its traditional base of peasants
and workers but China's new elites: its small but increasingly
influential middle class, its professionals and intellectuals, and
its entrepreneurs.</TE>
<TE>   Jiang's awkwardly named and somewhat confusing political
philosophy, the "Three Represents," is widely seen as an attempt to
co-opt these growing elites by inviting them to join the party.</TE>
<TE>   "He tries to please everybody," said one public-relations
consultant who has advised the government and asked not to be
identified. Some of Jiang's attempts to drive home his right of
succession have been embarrassingly ham-handed. One newspaper article
a few years ago featured photos of Mao and Deng reading the People's
Daily, the party mouthpiece. A third picture showed Jiang mimicking
them almost down to the pose.</TE>
<TE>   His emphasis on image even dictates his choice of clothes. When
the country celebrated 50 years of Communist rule in 1999 with a
massive parade through downtown Beijing, Jiang was the only one of
China's leaders up on the viewing platform wearing a Mao suit. The
others wore Western dress and clapped stonily as marchers went by
hoisting huge pictures of Mao, Deng and Jiang.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps more than any other of his duties, Jiang relishes his role
as a world statesman--and plays it up as much as possible. The
national evening newscast, seen by hundreds of millions of viewers,
airs almost nightly footage of Jiang trotting the globe or receiving
tribute in Beijing from small, poor countries that most Chinese have
never heard of.</TE>
<TE>   The cameras also track him on highly staged walkabouts among
ordinary Chinese, whose flesh he presses and infants he dandles on
his knee to show himself a beneficent leader in touch with the
average Zhou.</TE>
<TE>   But the results aren't always encouraging.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ridicule and Apathy</TE>
<TE>   Many Chinese think Jiang looks ridiculous and sycophantic bursting
into English for foreign dignitaries or indulging his habit, which he
apparently thinks charming, of serenading them with snatches of
Chinese opera.</TE>
<TE>   Others find it hard to care even enough to poke fun at the "Three
Represents," which he is lobbying hard to have written into the
Communist Party charter at the party congress. This would guarantee
that his influence on China's direction would continue.</TE>
<TE>   A survey of young people found that only 11% could name even one
of the "represents." Scoffers say the philosophy should be enshrined
in the party charter, alongside "Mao Tse-tung Thought" and "Deng
Xiaoping Theory," under the heading "Jiang Zemin's Opinions."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see Jiang as a particularly popular leader," said Joseph
Fewsmith, an expert on Chinese politics at Boston University. "I
think there is a real disconnect between the public, which is more
interested in making a living, and the leadership, where party
mechanisms and control over ideology remain important."</TE>
<TE>   But Jiang lacks the charisma of Mao. And despite the best efforts
of his spin doctors, many still do not see him as path-breaking like
Deng, who instituted the market-oriented reforms he continued.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless he has been sure of his next move, he has generally not
moved. This has given his administration a lackluster character
because he is not associated with forceful or visionary leadership,"
Fewsmith said. "But it has helped him stay in power."</TE>

<DH>Mideast: A report by Amnesty International says Israel and
the Palestinians alike have 'repeatedly violated' children's right to
life.</DH>

<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Two years of conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants have
taken a heavy toll on children, the human rights group Amnesty
International said Monday in a report that sharply criticized both
sides.</LD>
<LD>   In a fresh reminder, Palestinian authorities said two boys were
shot to death by Israeli soldiers Monday in clashes in and near the
West Bank city of Nablus.</LD>
<LD>   Amnesty said 250 Palestinian children and 72 Israeli children were
killed in the conflict from September 2000 until the end of this
August. Since the beginning of the current Palestinian intifada, or
uprising, the report said, "children have been targeted in an
unprecedented manner."</LD>
<TE>   "The patterns of killings ... show how the right to life of
Palestinian and Israeli children has been repeatedly violated as a
result of the systematic failure of the Israeli authorities,
Palestinian armed groups and the Palestinian Authority to comply with
... international human rights and humanitarian law," the report
said.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials expressed regret over the deaths of Palestinian
children, but they drew a distinction between those deaths, which
they said were accidental, and those of Israeli children, who they
say are deliberately targeted by suicide bombers and other
assailants.</TE>
<TE>   "There's never been a soldier ... who ever looked with anything
but the deepest regret at the death of a child," said Capt. Jacob
Dalal, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces. "I wish the same
could be said of the other side."</TE>
<TE>   Spokesmen for the Palestinian Authority did not return repeated
telephone calls. Palestinian officials maintain that Israel's
military occupation has made it impossible for them to control
radical groups that have carried out suicide bombings, although they
have denounced such attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Amnesty did not accuse Israel of deliberately targeting children,
but it said the country has been guilty of "unlawful and excessive
use of lethal force" in violation of international law. Most of the
deaths of Palestinian children have occurred when Israeli soldiers
responded to demonstrations and rock-throwing by opening fire with
either rubber-tipped bullets or live ammunition, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   The death of 10-year-old Rami Khalil Barbari on Monday morning was
apparently one such death. Palestinian officials said Rami was with
other children throwing rocks at soldiers at the Balata refugee camp
near Nablus when they were hit with live ammunition. Rami was shot in
the head and died; three other boys were wounded.</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli army spokesman said soldiers at the camp exchanged
gunfire with Palestinians but were unaware that they had hit anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Later, another boy, Mahmoud Hamze Zaghloul, 11, was killed in
Nablus. Hospital officials said he was shot in the chest in another
rock-throwing incident. The army said a youth who appeared to be a
teenager was shot as he was about to throw a Molotov cocktail at
soldiers. The Nablus clashes also left a 21-year-old Israeli soldier,
Sgt. Ari Weiss, dead and 38 other people injured, many of them
children, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The Amnesty report said it is improper for Israeli forces to use
live ammunition or even rubber-tipped bullets--which can be
lethal--in the presence of children.</TE>
<TE>   Dalal, the Israeli military spokesman, said the army's "general
policy" is not to fire at or around children, although he stressed
that "a 17-year-old throwing a Molotov cocktail does not fall into
that category." He said children have often been killed in cross-fire
or because they were mixed in with adult combatants.</TE>
<TE>   Amnesty defines a child as anyone under 18, and it cited many
instances in which Israeli troops have fired on groups composed
entirely or primarily of children, often preteens. It also criticized
Israel for attacks on residential areas during which children were
killed.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not clear what instructions, if any, have been given to IDF
soldiers about the targeting of children," the report said, referring
to the Israeli military. However, it added, the sheer number of
children killed, and the fact that most of them were hit in the head
or upper body, suggests that Israeli forces "have consistently
breached international standards regulating the use of force and
firearms."</TE>
<TE>   Amnesty was also harsh in its criticism of Palestinian officials
and, especially, the radical groups that have carried out suicide
bombings against Israeli civilians. Of the Israeli children killed in
the conflict, 70% have died in such attacks, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   In the worst of these attacks, in June 2001, a suicide bomber blew
himself up among a group of young people waiting outside a nightclub
in Tel Aviv, killing 21 people, 12 of them under 18.</TE>
<TE>   Amnesty said the bomber, a member of the radical group Hamas,
"must have anticipated that many children would be among the
victims."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the report concluded, Palestinian armed groups "make no
distinction between military objectives and civilians, including
children."</TE>
<TE>   In chiding the Palestinian Authority, Amnesty acknowledged that
Israel may have made it difficult for the governing body to exercise
control over armed groups. However, the report said, "this does not
lessen in any way" the authority's obligation to prevent attacks on
civilians.</TE>

<HD>Unlike in '90, Fear of U.S. Defines U.N. Iraq Debate</HD>
<DH>Analysis: Diplomats say respect for American resolve has
given way to qualms about bullying.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>At first glance, America's fast-unfolding confrontation with Iraq
seems eerily like a replay of the crisis that led to the 1991 Persian
Gulf War.</LD>
<LD>   In the fall of 1990, efforts to build support for a U.N. Security
Council ultimatum to Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein were led by
Britain and the United States. The move was accompanied by
hand-wringing on the part of council members who thought the
conditions were too tough, by Iraqi accusations of American
imperialism and by rhetoric that the future of the United Nations was
at stake.</LD>
<LD>   And like last week, there was even a rare instance when the United
States failed to back Israel in the Security Council as Washington
worked to gather Arab support.</LD>
<TE>   But appearances deceive.</TE>
<TE>   The global environment in which the United States confronts Iraq
today has changed dramatically. And despite America's unchallenged
supremacy, the environment seems far less friendly than a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   During the intervening years, a political and psychological gap
has grown between the United States and the world it so dominates--a
gap created by forceful displays of American military superiority in
Iraq, Kosovo and Afghanistan and by a kind of diplomatic decoupling
from even its closest allies on major issues. Since 1990, the United
States has declined to join an international criminal court and a
global ban on land mines and to sign the Kyoto Protocol to reverse
the deterioration of the world's environment.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration's uncompromising rhetoric about acting
unilaterally to oust Hussein has only magnified this distance. The
expectant mood that permeated U.N. headquarters in late fall 1990 has
been replaced by a deepening sense of foreboding as the Security
Council prepares to debate a new American draft resolution on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Respect for the United States remains, but diplomats here say the
admiration that once accompanied it has been replaced by something
else: fear. These diplomats say the U.S. has dropped persuasion as
its main tactic and replaced it with intimidation.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, "there was great excitement that the most powerful
country was gathering together the world community to meet this
challenge," recalled David Malone, a former Canadian ambassador to
the United Nations who now heads an independent New York think tank
focused on U.N. activities. "That excitement and support have been
replaced by apprehension and fear.</TE>
<TE>   "The Security Council is operating under great pressure to
accommodate the United States, but the trouble is, this
administration is seen as the ugly American," Malone said. "They
don't make their case. They just bully when they can."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fear of Extinction</TE>
<TE>   A senior U.N. official who declined to be identified agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's as if the United States has put us on notice that we have a
week or two to get our act together or they are going on their own,"
he said. "There's a lot of fear around here because if we lose the
Americans, we might be able to go on for a time, but not very
effectively."</TE>
<TE>   Dragooning reluctant allies into a conflict with Iraq or mounting
a unilateral attack could prove costly for the U.S. later on,
analysts say. They say it would be harder for the administration to
persuade Europeans and other allies to help with peacekeeping and
rebuilding in Iraq, work that Americans have left mainly to others in
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "Managing postwar Iraq is not going to be just extremely difficult
but also extremely expensive," Malone said.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity,
rejected the accusations of intimidation as "unfair."</TE>
<TE>   "The president made a strategic choice to go to the U.N., and
we've been open in our consultations," the official said. "The
president and the secretary of State have been on the phone with a
number of leaders. I wouldn't call that bullying at all."</TE>
<TE>   There have also been reports that the Bush administration has
engaged in quiet, behind-the-scenes horse-trading, offering
inducements of economic assistance, postwar business deals in Iraq
and weapons to countries willing to join the fight.</TE>
<TE>   But John Chipman, director of the International Institute of
Strategic Studies in London, said President Bush has a much harder
case to make today than his father did 12 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "The objective was very different," Chipman said. "Then it was
straightforward: Eject Iraq from Kuwait. Now it's regime change, and
that's much more questionable. Whatever the grounds, it's hard for
many to swallow."</TE>
<TE>   To veteran diplomats here, the contrasts in America's aims, its
role and its tactics are striking.</TE>
<TE>   In the autumn of 1990, with the Cold War just over, the Iraq
crisis seemed to bring the United Nations to the verge of rebirth,
not irrelevance.</TE>
<TE>   The diplomats recall a speech seven weeks before the Security
Council vote on Iraq when the previous President Bush used soaring
language in an address to the General Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.N. is now fulfilling its promise as the world's parliament
of peace," he declared.</TE>
<TE>   In the days prior to that vote, then-Secretary of State James A.
Baker III traveled to four continents to make the case against
Hussein in each capital of the Security Council's 14 other member
states.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Difference in Tone</TE>
<TE>   In the early diplomatic going here this time, a Security Council
diplomat said the tone from Washington seemed far different.</TE>
<TE>   "The Americans are not prepared to do a lot of negotiation," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The diplomat added that there was a second message from the
Americans: A veto by permanent Security Council members France or
Russia of a resolution authorizing military action against Iraq would
not prevent an attack. It would just mean the Americans would go it
alone.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts believe America's sheer strength will enable the
administration to get what it wants from its hardball tactics.</TE>
<TE>   If the United Nations fails to back the United States, and
Washington subsequently acts alone against Iraq, that would seriously
erode the Security Council's role in world affairs and the influence
of its member states, the analysts say. Two of the biggest losers
would be France and Russia, whose Security Council veto power is both
a symbol of former greatness and a real political tool.</TE>
<TE>   Diplomats here believe France, Russia and others may be willing to
accept a far harsher resolution on Iraq than they would prefer in
order to preserve the Security Council's relevance and their own
voice.</TE>
<TE>   Obtaining a portion of postwar spoils distributed by any successor
government in Baghdad also is an incentive to back the United States.
Diplomats here cite the example of Afghanistan, where a new
U.S.-influenced government determines who will receive lucrative
reconstruction contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "All these countries have much more to gain by cooperating with
the United States than opposing them," said a senior U.N. diplomat.
"You don't want a country as powerful as the United States to be your
enemy."</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ANKARA, Turkey</DL>
<LD>Atomic energy officials said Monday that a substance seized by police
near the Syrian border was not weapons-grade uranium as Turkish
authorities first reported, according to the state-run Anatolian news
agency.</LD>
<LD>   Atomic Energy Institute chief Guler Koksal said the material was
harmless, containing zinc, iron, zirconium and manganese.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement ended days of speculation that the substance
might have been destined for neighboring Iraq, which the United
States accuses of trying to smuggle in nuclear material for a secret
weapons program.</LD>
<TE>   Police, acting on a tip, recovered the material in a taxi last
week near the Syrian border. Two Turks who were trying to sell the
material as uranium were released from custody.</TE>
<TE>   The seizure alarmed intelligence agencies around the world when
the Turkish police at first said it weighed 33 pounds. On Sunday,
police said the material weighed only 5 ounces. The disparity
occurred because authorities initially included the weight of the
lead container.</TE>

<HD>Sonar Tests a Likely Link to Whale Deaths</HD>
<DH>Probe: An initial study shows ear and brain trauma in
mammals that washed up in the Canary Islands during military
exercises held there.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 15 beaked whales that beached themselves last week on the Canary
Islands off northwest Africa during a multinational naval exercise
suffered ear and brain trauma that may have been caused by
high-intensity sonar, according to a preliminary analysis.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Michel Andre, a veterinarian leading the investigation, noted
Monday that "necropsies showed the presence of unspecific lesions,
including in the brain and the hearing system, consistent with
acoustic impact."</LD>
<LD>   If a final analysis confirms these findings, it would be the
second time that scientists have direct evidence linking mass
stranding of whales to bursts of powerful active sonar used by U.S.
and other warships.</LD>
<TE>   An exhaustive study of a similar stranding of whales in the
Bahamas 2 1/2 years ago showed that intense bursts of midfrequency
sonar tore apart delicate tissues of whales' inner ears and brains,
leading to hemorrhaging, disorientation and death.</TE>
<TE>   In the Canary Island strandings last Tuesday and Wednesday, nine
whales washed ashore dead, two were spotted dead and floating in
nearby coastal waters, and six beached whales were pushed back to sea
in the hope they would survive. The whales washed ashore on the
islands of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote.</TE>
<TE>   All were beaked whales, which look like very large dolphins. The
three types of beaked whales that washed up ranged from 15 to 24 feet
in length.</TE>
<TE>   The mass stranding took place during maneuvers for "Neo-Tapon
2002," a multinational exercise hosted by the Spanish navy, which had
invited 11 other NATO member countries to participate, according to
the Spanish military.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Navy sent the Norfolk, Va.-based destroyer Mahan to join
the exercise, which included as many as 58 ships, six submarines and
30 aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   The maneuvers were cut short at the request of the Canary Islands
government after the dead whales were discovered.</TE>
<TE>   "Spanish defense officials immediately initiated an
investigation," said U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr. Pauline Storum. "It would be
inappropriate to speculate on the cause of the stranding."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization declined to
comment directly, saying it was a national issue for Spain and the
Canary Islands, which are a part of the nation.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Spanish military, so far it has reported no connection
between the maneuvers and the dead whales. In addition, neither U.S.,
NATO nor Spanish military officials have detailed what kind of sonar
systems were deployed during the exercise.</TE>
<TE>   The nine whales that washed ashore dead underwent necropsies on
the beach. Two of the whales were too badly decomposed for tissues to
be preserved for analysis and a third suffered extensively from
parasites, said Vidal Martin of the Society for the Study of
Cetaceans in the Canary Archipelago.</TE>
<TE>   The heads of six whales were removed and taken to the veterinary
school at Gran Canaria's University of Las Palmas. Preserving the
head is a prerequisite for laboratory analysis of the type of
injuries that can be caused by sonar, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The preliminary analysis showed hemorrhaging around the brain and
thin-walled soft tissue in the head, Martin reported Monday. "At the
moment, this veterinarian unit is studying the auditory system," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The stomachs of seven of the beaked whales contained fresh squid
and crustaceans, suggesting that the animals had recently been
feeding before they beached themselves, Martin said.</TE>
<TE>   Martin and other researchers have reported similar mass strandings
immediately after naval exercises in 1985, 1988, 1989 and 1991.
Another mass die-off was reported in Greece after a 1996 NATO
exercise involving active midfrequency and low-frequency sonar.</TE>
<TE>   But researchers were unable to retrieve fresh tissues to determine
the cause of the deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Active sonar systems, unlike passive listening devices, emit loud
bursts of sound that detect the presence of an enemy by the echo that
bounces back.</TE>

<LD>Firefighters struggled Monday night to douse a blaze in a
40-foot-long cargo container aboard a ship docked in Long Beach and
idled by the West Coast port lockout.</LD>
<LD>   Smoke from the fire was spotted shortly after 8 p.m. by a crewman
on the container ship OCL New York. The container held imported
clothing and fabric.</LD>
<LD>   "It's been difficult fighting this fire because the container is
stacked high on the ship," said spokesman Mike Garcia of the Long
Beach Fire Department. "We are in search of a crane operator in hopes
of having the container pulled off of the ship so we can extinguish
the fire and prevent it from spreading."</LD>
<TE>   "There is no indication of arson," he said, "but we will
investigate the cause."</TE>

<HD>Port Closures Start Taking Economic Toll</HD>
<DH>Labor: Businesses call for federal intervention before
losses begin to snowball. Negotiators report little progress in
breaking the impasse.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Economic losses mounted Monday as a management lockout of West Coast
union dockworkers continued, idling ships at 29 ports and prompting a
business coalition to call for federal intervention.</LD>
<LD>   In San Diego, produce rotted aboard ships that could not be
unloaded. In Seattle, 2,400 cruise ship passengers were temporarily
stuck on board until a deal was reached that allowed them to
disembark. In Oakland, a container ship attempting to put to sea was
blocked from doing so by union supporters in small boats.</LD>
<LD>   West Coast ports handle about half the nation's seaborne cargo. A
five-day shutdown could cost the U.S. economy an estimated $4.7
billion--with the losses snowballing to $19.4 billion if the shutdown
were to last 10 days, according to a study commissioned by the
shipping lines.</LD>
<TE>   The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service tried to defuse
tensions by calling for both parties to meet in Washington on
Thursday, but it was unclear whether the meeting would take place.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiators for shipping lines and the International Longshore and
Warehouse Union met for two hours Monday afternoon in San Francisco
but made little progress, according to both sides. Negotiations were
set to resume Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Maritime Assn. ordered an indefinite lockout beginning
Sunday night, saying the union staged "devastating" slowdowns along
the coast through the last week. The group said it was cheaper to
close terminals than to try to operate under a slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   The association, which represents international shipping lines and
terminal operators, said the lockout would continue until the union
signed a new contract or agreed to extend the old one. The old
contract barred the union from staging slowdowns, association
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing that the shutdown could last through the week and beyond,
a business group called for federal intervention.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to understand the ports have been closed, essentially,
for three days," said Robin Lanier, executive director of the West
Coast Waterfront Coalition, which represents Wal-Mart, Target, Home
Depot and other major retailers and manufacturers that use the ports.
"If we get much past the fifth day, this thing is really going to
start to hurt."</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials, who have been meeting with shipping
executives and major users of the ports since June, maintained a
studied distance from the dispute Monday, saying only that they hoped
the two sides would agree to mediation. But they hinted that they
would act swiftly if there was a failure to reach a settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point we're urging both parties to resolve their
differences and avail themselves of the [mediation] services," White
House spokeswoman Clare Buchan said early Monday. Later in the day,
White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer noted the gravity of the
West Coast port shutdown, saying: "If it goes on for even a short
period of time, it's a problem for the economy."</TE>
<TE>   About $300 billion in goods moves through the ports annually, from
personal electronics and shoes to car parts and building supplies. A
UC Berkeley study estimated that port traffic supports 4 million jobs
nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   ILWU President James Spinosa offered a glimmer of encouragement
Monday when he told reporters for the first time that he would
consider mediation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a possibility," he said from the union's San Francisco
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Spinosa said he would meet with a representative of the Federal
Mediation Service today to discuss how the service could help break
the stalemate. However, in a statement issued late Monday, Spinosa
reiterated that the union "has made no decision thus far regarding
the use of mediation." An official with the shipping association also
would attend, a source familiar with the negotiations confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   Spinosa said the 10,500-member union was leery of seeking federal
help because administration officials had intervened early in
negotiations in a manner the union said favored the shipping
industry. A Department of Labor official confirmed in August that he
had been in frequent contact with both parties since negotiations
began in May but insisted that the administration was neutral and
merely wanted to avoid labor disruptions.</TE>
<TE>   Despite encouragement on the mediation front, both sides issued
inflammatory rhetoric Monday and appeared to maintain rigid positions
on the key issues separating them.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations have bogged down on the employers' desire to
modernize the ports with technology, such as scanners and remote
cameras, that would eliminate hundreds of union jobs. In exchange,
the union wants to set minimum staffing levels, expand its
jurisdiction to all technology-related jobs and control all
information once it enters the ports. The shipping group has resisted
those demands.</TE>
<TE>   Shippers have few options for moving transpacific goods. The union
controls all U.S. ports on the West Coast, and ports in Canada and
Mexico are too small to handle the large container vessels now used
to ferry goods from Asia to the United States. Most vessels are also
too large to fit through the Panama Canal or to dock at East Coast
ports.</TE>
<TE>   The ILWU is known for its solidarity and strength, and it is
unlikely that nonunion workers would attempt to cross picket lines.
Also, skill sets for many union port workers, from crane operators to
gate clerks, are highly specialized and few others can do the work.</TE>
<TE>   The union, whose members earn about $80,000 to more than $150,000
annually, has used those factors to its advantage, and shipping lines
claim they gave in to unreasonable demands in 1996 and 1999 after
cargo movement was slowed. This time, they said, they will not back
down.</TE>
<TE>   "The employers locking out a union on the West Coast is something
you could never see before," said an industry official who asked not
to be identified, fearing retribution from the union. "But they have
had it and can't take anymore. We have no revenue coming in, so for
us to agree to a lockout was pretty difficult. But we feel it's
necessary, and we are more united than ever."</TE>
<TE>   Spinosa lashed out at the shipping association for allegedly
provoking the crisis, and he refused to sign an extension of the
labor contract, which was due to expire July 1 and was extended on a
day-to-day basis through Sept. 2.</TE>
<TE>   The 29 ports from San Diego to Seattle were first closed Friday
night for what the shipping association called a 36-hour cooling-off
period. But work disruptions continued after the ports reopened
Sunday morning, leading the association to close the ports
indefinitely starting Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   Monday morning, scores of protesters turned out at dozens of
closed gates in Los Angeles and Long Beach, which receive about 60%
of trade along the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   But the demonstrations did not appear to be well-organized. At the
new Pier 400 terminal in Los Angeles, ILWU Local 13 members walked
about in small groups. One protester started a chant, "What do you
want? When do you want it?" but there was no response.</TE>
<TE>   Some protesters questioned the tactics of union leaders, but a
veteran dockworker urged them to remain unified.</TE>
<TE>   But a picket line near the Evergreen terminal was more organized
and a union leader kept the members chanting.</TE>
<TE>   In the small port of Vancouver, Wash., a handful of workers manned
picket lines at terminal entrances, braving wet, chilly weather and
holding signs reading "Unfair Lockout."</TE>
<TE>   Brad Clark, president of ILWU Local 4 in Vancouver, is a
third-generation longshoreman who remembered when his father went out
on strike for 160 days in 1971. "We got free hot dogs and beans and
drank powdered milk to save money," Clark said. "Now, we're preparing
for the worst and we're in it for the long haul. This is a fight for
our survival."</TE>
<TE>   Along the coast, at least 125 ships holding an estimated 500,000
containers were stranded, with dozens more scheduled to arrive each
day this week.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego, the Wild Jasmine out of Australia was laden with
hundreds of thousands of rotting oranges, port authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally, we would have two or three ships working," said wharf
manager Bruce Cummings. "You'd see bags of fertilizer, cement, fruit
being discharged."</TE>
<TE>   At Port Hueneme in Ventura County, a ship loaded with bananas and
one filled with liquid fertilizer sat idle as dockworkers were sent
home another day without work.</TE>
<TE>   Despite some confusion and concern, cruise ships were able to load
and unload passengers in San Diego and Seattle after operators
negotiated directly with union officials.</TE>

<HD>A Big Win for Farm Workers</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Davis signs two bills mandating mediation in
disputes. Growers call the new laws unconstitutional.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGG JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis, caught between protests from the United Farm Workers
union and political pressure from influential growers, on Monday
signed legislation giving California farm laborers the right of
mandatory mediation in deadlocked contract negotiations.</LD>
<LD>   Davis waited until the last possible day to act on the
controversial pair of bills, the focal point of one of the
Legislature's most riveting battles this year. He made repeated
efforts to prevent the legislation from reaching his desk, then later
negotiated with UFW representatives to limit the scope of the two
measures he signed Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Representatives of California's $27-billion agricultural industry
condemned the legislation as unconstitutional and said it would force
many family farms out of business and cause food prices to rise.</LD>
<TE>   For the UFW, after years of decline and internal divisions,
winning the right of mandatory mediation marks a triumph
unprecedented since the passage of the 1975 agricultural labor
relations law.</TE>
<TE>   Under the companion bills--Senate Bill 1156 and Assembly Bill
2596--farm workers can ask the state Agricultural Labor Relations
Board to impose mandatory mediation in cases where contract
negotiations with growers have stalled, beginning in January. The
bills limit the number of cases a party may bring to 75 and set a
Jan. 1, 2008, expiration date on the remedy.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation, which only applies to agricultural workers,
exempts farmers who employ fewer than 25 people.</TE>
<TE>   Farm workers, who have maintained a vigil outside the Capitol for
weeks, greeted the news with shouts of joy.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very excited," said UFW President Arturo Rodriguez,
son-in-law of UFW founder Cesar Chavez. "Farm workers are like all
working people: All they want is to be treated with respect and
dignity. This ensures that is going to happen. It's definitely going
to improve people's lives."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' action marks the first changes in the state's landmark 1975
Agricultural Labor Relations Act, signed into law by Gov. Jerry
Brown, whose chief of staff was Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Growers reacted with anger and dismay.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Tom Nassif, president of the Western Growers
Assn., which represents 3,500 farmers in California and Arizona,
expressed shock and anger that Davis "has signed into law legislation
so patently illegal and potentially destructive to the California
farmer. This at a time when our industry is under attack by a flood
of foreign imports and a weak farm economy."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Webb, a lobbyist for the association and key player in the
legislative battle over the bills, said there was a "good
probability" that growers would challenge the law on constitutional
grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Growers contend that the new law actually imposes binding
arbitration--not mediation--on negotiations between farmers and farm
workers.</TE>
<TE>   "The mediator is imposing terms of the contract," Webb said. "They
can call it what they like, but this is binding arbitration.
California agriculture is the only major industry in the nation that
is going to have this draconian measure imposed on it, and that's
unfair. The current system does work. Our fears are [the new
legislation] is going to drive costs up for the family farmer, make
it more difficult for them to compete with other states and other
countries."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement announcing his decision, Davis said the legislation
would "offer a blueprint for addressing the most serious failings in
the system when negotiations between growers and farm workers cannot
be resolved."</TE>
<TE>   Davis noted that in nearly 60% of the cases in which a farm
workers union has won an election, the union hasn't been able to get
a contract from management.</TE>
<TE>   Under the system laid out by the legislation, the mediator will
have the power to propose the terms of a binding contract if the two
sides can't reach an agreement after 30 days of mediation.</TE>
<TE>   Either side can appeal the contract terms to the labor relations
board. The board's decision can be appealed to the state Court of
Appeal or California Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   The mediation will only apply to negotiations for first contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Latino legislators, who united in unanimous support for the UFW
legislation, praised Davis for signing the bills.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very pleased," said Assemblyman Tony Cardenas (D-Panorama
City), whose father picked produce in the California fields during
the 1940s and 1950s after emigrating from Mexico. "I think the Latino
community is going to show a lot of appreciation for this."</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas was one of dozens of legislators who joined a series of
marches, fasts and vigils organized by the UFW to pressure Davis to
sign the bills.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope what this says is that Gray Davis appreciates farm
workers," Cardenas said. "When farm workers vote for a union, the
growers shouldn't be able to hide behind their high-powered lawyers."</TE>
<TE>   Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco), who carried the
original bill and subsequent versions in the Senate, had denounced
Davis for trying to prevent the legislation from reaching his desk.
Burton had warned that a veto would be the worst mistake of Davis'
political career and would damage the governor's relationship with
the Democrat-dominated Legislature, but he was gracious in victory
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm relieved," Burton said. "He was under tremendous pressure
from growers, but I always had faith that he would do the right
thing. We're grateful that he did. It's one of the best feelings I've
ever had in public life."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the legislation said grower predictions of failing
farms and rising food prices as a result of the bills were wildly
overblown.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know anybody who wouldn't mind paying a little more for
food for these people to have a decent standard of living for
themselves and their children," Burton said. "I don't see it as
hurting the economy."</TE>
<TE>   UFW leaders and their supporters say loopholes in the 1975
labor-relations law--exploited by unscrupulous growers, they
contend--made the passage of new legislation necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "This fixes a broken law and will help farm workers have a
fighting chance to win a fair contract with corporate growers," said
Art Pulaski, secretary-general of the California Labor Federation,
the state's largest labor group. "Farm workers put food on our
tables, but many are too poor to put food on their tables. This law
will correct a long injustice for the poorest in the state."</TE>
<TE>   In deciding whether to sign the legislation, Davis faced a
dilemma: He could support poor farm workers, a constituency
championed by Latinos and liberals, or side with California's most
important industry and the growers who have contributed hundreds of
thousands of dollars to his reelection campaign.</TE>
<TE>   With the election looming Nov. 5, Davis faced equally complex
political calculations: He could shore up his base by signing the
bill or veto the bill and curry favor in the Central Valley, an area
crucial to a victory by GOP challenger Bill Simon Jr.</TE>
<TE>   The UFW and its supporters in organized labor and elsewhere
mounted a massive campaign to pressure Davis to sign the bill.
Celebrities including Warren Beatty and Martin Sheen and AFL-CIO
President John Sweeney were among the dozens of figures who made
personal appeals to Davis to sign the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   The UFW also waged a public campaign of marches, vigils, fasts and
pickets to keep the issue in the public eye and on Davis' radar
screen.</TE>
<TE>   "Those of us in Sacramento have been seeing images five or six
times a day of people fasting, praying, sitting around the Capitol,"
said Barbara O'Connor, who heads the Institute for the Study of
Politics and Media at Cal State Sacramento. "I think it's been
effective. It has kept his toes to the fire."</TE>
<TE>   Other statewide officeholders--including Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante,
Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer and Treasurer Phil Angelides--came out in
support of the UFW legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "I do think that this year the governor is particularly vulnerable
to issues that resonate with his traditional liberal constituency,
and this is one that the liberal wing of the party has traditionally
been behind," O'Connor said.</TE>
<TE>   The political risk for Davis is "losing big-agriculture Democrats
because it's a bread-and-butter liberal issue."</TE>

<HD>Davis Builds Big Lead in Race</HD>
<DH>Times Poll: Gains show attack ads seem to be working. Many
aren't happy with the governor but call him the better of two
unsatisfying choices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gray Davis has opened a substantial lead over Bill Simon Jr. in the
race for California governor, as disenchanted voters turn to the
incumbent Democrat as the better of two unsatisfying choices,
according to the Los Angeles Times Poll.</LD>
<LD>   The survey, completed Sunday night, suggests that Davis' attack
strategy against Republican Simon has paid off: After a
multimillion-dollar barrage of critical TV ads, the Los Angeles
businessman is now viewed negatively by about half of those likely to
vote. Davis' image, in turn, has improved slightly over the last few
months.</LD>
<LD>   More significantly, although Davis receives poor marks on issues
such as handling the state budget, energy and his personal ethics,
likely voters said the governor would still do a better job in those
areas than Simon.</LD>
<TE>   Overall, Davis was leading his Republican rival 45% to 35% among
likely voters, with 7% supporting other candidates and 13% undecided.
When a lower turnout scenario was factored in--with fewer than half
of registered voters casting ballots--Davis extended his lead over
Simon to 46% to 34%.</TE>
<TE>   The poll found a strong Democratic tide running through
California, with the party's nominees leading all seven down-ballot
contests for offices such as lieutenant governor, treasurer and
attorney general--often by substantial margins.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the higher-profile measures on the Nov. 5 ballot were
getting mixed receptions. Proposition 49, the Arnold
Schwarzenegger-backed measure to promote after-school programs, was
supported by 55% of those surveyed and opposed by 31%. Proposition
52, which would allow same-day voter registration, was trailing with
39% in favor and 51% opposed.</TE>
<TE>   As the campaign heads into its final five weeks, Californians are
plainly discontented with both the direction of the state and their
choices of who will occupy the governor's seat for the next four
years. Though that can cause a certain amount of volatility among
voters, in this case Democrats appear to be benefiting.</TE>
<TE>   More than half, 51% of registered voters, believe that the state
is heading in the wrong direction, up from 40% in February. And 65%
of those likely to turn out next month said they wished there were
other candidates running, besides Davis and Simon, with a plausible
shot at winning the governorship.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like choosing between two bad apples," said Chris DeLong, a
32-year-old government worker and registered independent from
Sacramento, who considers Simon too conservative but questions Davis'
trustworthiness. In a follow-up interview, DeLong said he is leaning
toward a vote to reelect the governor only because he worries that
his support for a third-party candidate would be wasted.</TE>
<TE>   The dissatisfaction transcends party lines, although Democrats are
somewhat more contented with their gubernatorial nominee than
Republicans. Only about a third of Simon supporters were satisfied
with their choice, compared to more than four in 10 Davis supporters
who were satisfied with their candidate.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, I'll do anything to keep Gray Davis from being elected
again," said Barbara Pouliot, 41, a Republican from Fullerton. "I
can't think of a single thing that he's done right." That said,
Pouliot suggested that Simon "just doesn't have the experience to be
governor. It's the best of a bad choice."</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, Dolores Halden, a 70-year-old Republican and retired
nurse in Sunnyvale, used words like "opportunist" to describe Davis.
Still, she finds him more honest than Simon, who "seems pretty
sleazy" in his business dealings. Above all, Halden said, she wishes
that she had other choices at the top of the Democratic and
Republican tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' lukewarm standing with Californians would normally signal
trouble for an incumbent, particularly since he has spent millions of
dollars to plead his case over the television airwaves.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, likely voters are divided in their impressions of the
governor, with 48% having a favorable view of Davis and 51% an
unfavorable impression.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest reason for unhappiness with the incumbent was his
performance during last year's energy crisis, cited by nearly half of
likely voters with an unfavorable opinion of Davis.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months evidence has emerged that major energy companies
gamed the deregulated California electricity market, contributing to
the state's energy problems. But Elizabeth Carlton, apparently
speaking for many, said Davis is still somewhat to blame. "He should
have been able to detect what was going on and do something about
it," said Carlton, 84, a retired Oakland homemaker who is a
registered Democrat. "That's his job."</TE>
<TE>   On another major issue facing California, more than half--52%--of
likely voters disapproved of Davis' handling of the state budget. He
received better marks for his record on education--the governor's
stated No. 1 priority--but still only 49% approved. Thirty-nine
percent disapproved.</TE>
<TE>   On the broader leadership question, Davis boosted his standing
somewhat since the last Times Poll in February. At that stage, fewer
than half of registered voters described Davis as a decisive leader.
In the latest survey, 51% said he fit that description. (The figure
was 50% among likely voters.)</TE>
<TE>   But despite the political danger usually posed by such middling
ratings, most of the likely voters surveyed still believe that Davis
would do a better job on most issues than Simon. On education, crime,
domestic security, the economy and general leadership abilities Davis
was favored over Simon by seven percentage points or more among
likely voters. Even on energy, likely voters were evenly split over
which candidate would do a better job, with Simon favored only
slightly, 39% to 37%.</TE>
<TE>   The contest for governor is Simon's first run for political
office. He was the surprise winner in the March GOP primary and
enjoyed a burst of favorable publicity after upsetting former Los
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan. But months of daily pounding by
negative Davis TV spots have badly hurt Simon's image, with 51% now
having a negative impression of the Republican nominee.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the challenge facing Simon over the next five weeks is
stark. Davis was leading his opponent among likely voters of all age
groups, education and income levels. The governor was predictably
ahead in the Democratic-leaning Los Angeles region and the San
Francisco Bay Area. But he was virtually tied with Simon in
Republican-tilting areas outside California's two biggest
metropolitan centers.</TE>
<TE>   Many of Davis' TV spots have focused on Simon's business record,
and the criticism has clearly taken hold. Of those with a negative
impression of Simon, close to half said their feelings stemmed from
doubts about his honesty and integrity.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like Simon," said Republican Wesley Wolfe, 59, of
Westchester, who developed his negative view "primarily from Davis'
ads." He doesn't much care for the governor either, Wolfe said, but
would probably back him as "the lesser of two evils."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the campaign, Simon has attacked Davis' prodigious
fund-raising, calling him a "coin-operated" governor who runs a
"pay-to-play administration" that favors big campaign donors. Davis
has repeatedly denied any connection between the money he raises and
the policies he pursues.</TE>
<TE>   But the poll found little evidence that Simon's assault has dented
Davis: By 44% to 27%, likely voters said they believed that the
incumbent has more honesty and integrity to serve as governor than
his challenger.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the way politics is," Maxine Bracy, 67, a Los Angeles
teacher, Democrat and Davis supporter, said of the governor's
fundraising. "I don't think anyone can win unless they're extremely
rich. So they have to raise money."</TE>
<TE>   Two contentious issues--abortion and gun control--have so far
played little role in the race, as Simon has sought to downplay his
stance and Davis has focused instead on his opponent's business
record and personal integrity.</TE>
<TE>   Simon opposes abortion in most instances and is against the
adoption of more gun controls. Davis, in contrast, has signed
legislation broadening abortion rights and extending curbs on
firearms.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about abortion, 57% of likely voters said it should be legal
most of the time. Of those, nearly six in 10 were backing Davis. Of
the 38% who said abortion should be illegal save for a few
exceptions, just over half supported Simon.</TE>
<TE>   On gun control, just about half of likely voters, 48%, said they
favored a further crackdown on firearms. Of those, six in 10 were
backing Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 16% who favored fewer restrictions on guns, Simon was
supported by just about seven in 10 likely voters. The GOP nominee
was also outpolling Davis among those who believe that the current
restrictions are just about right, leading 44% to 34%.</TE>
<TE>   The Times Poll, under the direction of Susan Pinkus, interviewed
1,171 registered voters Sept. 25-29. There were 679 likely voters.
The margin of sampling error for registered voters is plus or minus 3
percentage points. For likely voters it is 4 points.</TE>

<TE>HOW THE POLL WAS CONDUCTED</TE>
<TE>The Times Poll contacted 1,171 Californians registered to vote,
including 679 likely voters, statewide by telephone Sept. 25-29.
Telephone numbers were chosen from a list of all exchanges in the
state. Random-digit dialing techniques were used so that listed and
unlisted numbers could be contacted. The entire sample was weighted
slightly to conform with census figures for sex, race, age,
education, region and registration. The margin of sampling error for
registered voters is plus or minus 3 percentage points; for likely
voters it is 4 points. For certain subgroups the error margin may be
somewhat higher. Poll results can also be affected by other factors
such as question wording and the order in which questions are
presented. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish.</TE>

<HD>New Alliance Rises to Fight Secession</HD>
<DH>Campaign: The coalition of council members and lobbyists is
called a 'city hall power elite' that the breakup movement is trying
to defeat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY L. RABIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles City Council members have joined prominent local
lobbyists, the city's police union and a leading developer in the
fight against secession--raising ethics concerns and long-term
implications for governing the city.</LD>
<LD>   The partnership, known as the Public Safety Coalition, is the
latest campaign committee to oppose secession by the San Fernando
Valley and Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   A majority of the council's five-member Public Safety
Committee--Chairwoman Cindy Miscikowski and Council members Jan Perry
and Jack Weiss--have teamed up with the Los Angeles Police Protective
League, the union that represents LAPD officers. Together, they
helped host a $500-per-person fund-raiser Monday night at the Toluca
Lake home of developer Ed Roski Jr.</LD>
<TE>   There are grass-roots efforts on both sides of the secession
debate as well, but the fusion of public officials and private
interests against the proposed breakup has helped shape the
discussion. Secession critics say the coalition reflects the breadth
of their campaign to defeat the measures Nov. 5, but advocates of
Valley and Hollywood cityhood say the link between City Hall and
special interests is precisely what they aim to break.</TE>
<TE>   They contend that the deals cut in order to defeat secession will
put local leaders in debt to the lobbyists, union leaders and
developers who helped them win.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Katz, head of the campaign committee supporting Valley
secession, said the lobbyists raising money for the coalition
represent significant special interests.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the exact same people who run L.A.," Katz said. "These
people are in there for the long haul. They are protecting their
investment in City Hall."</TE>
<TE>   To raise money needed to open a new front in the campaign against
secession, members of the Public Safety Coalition gathered Monday in
hopes of collecting $100,000 for mailings targeting Valley voters.
Miscikowski, Perry, Weiss and Councilman Tom LaBonge were listed as
special guests. Reporters were not allowed to attend.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss said the coalition is an important part of the effort to
defeat Hollywood and Valley cityhood measures. He said he hopes the
money it raises "carries the message to Valley voters" that secession
would be bad for public safety.</TE>
<TE>   Katz disagreed and said the guest list "reads like a City Hall
power elite field trip to the Valley."</TE>
<TE>   Records show that Roski's development firm, Majestic Realty Co.,
is the largest single donor to L.A. United, Mayor James K. Hahn's
campaign to oppose secession.</TE>
<TE>   Fran Inman, a senior vice president of Majestic, said Roski is
actively involved in the fight against secession because he lives in
the Valley and loves Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "He thinks we belong together. The city just needs to stay
together to remain a leading city in the world," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Roski also believes that uncertainty about the city's future
created by the secession movement is bad for business, Inman said.
She added that Roski therefore believes it is important from a
business perspective to defeat the secession effort in both the
Valley and the entire city.</TE>
<TE>   To pass, Proposition F in the Valley and Proposition H in
Hollywood must get a majority vote in both the breakaway region and
in Los Angeles as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   "If it passes in the Valley and doesn't in the rest of the city,
the dysfunction is still going to be obvious," Inman said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Roski is participating in the secession debate, he
continues to have other interests in the workings of city government.</TE>
<TE>   He is part of a team that wants to build a mega-entertainment,
hotel and retail complex next to downtown's Staples Center. He's also
one of the names behind a dormant proposal to build a football
stadium downtown.</TE>
<TE>   To accomplish his development plans, Roski needs the help of the
City Council, which can authorize public money for those projects and
assist with assembling land.</TE>
<TE>   Lobbyist Steven Afriat, a political consultant tapped by
Miscikowski to spearhead the coalition's campaign against secession,
also has business before the council. He represents, for instance,
companies that receive a share of the Police Department's towing
contracts and lobbies on growth and development issues.</TE>
<TE>   The host committee for the fund-raiser includes other City Hall
regulars, each with an interest in decisions by the mayor and
council:</TE>
<TE>   * Arnie Berghoff is a lobbyist for Sunshine Canyon dump operator
Browning Ferris Industries. The expansion of the dump has long been a
source of irritation in the Valley, where some residents believe City
Hall ignored their concerns.</TE>
<TE>   * Julie Butcher is general manager of Service Employees
International Union Local 347, the largest city employee union.</TE>
<TE>   * William Delvac is an attorney who helped Roski get millions of
dollars in public subsidies to build Staples Center and assisted in
negotiations over building a football stadium downtown.</TE>
<TE>   * Maureen Kindel and George Mihlsten are successful lobbyists.
Kindel was active in the city's debate over forcing cable companies
to open their lines to Internet service providers. Mihlsten has
represented Roski and fellow Staples Center developer Philip
Anschutz.</TE>
<TE>   * Fabian Nunez, a Democratic candidate for the Assembly, was a
lobbyist for Los Angeles Unified School District and past political
director of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor. In addition
to running for office, he is campaigning for passage of a school
construction bond measure that will appear on the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   * Lobbyist Ken Spiker Jr. is the billboard industry's chief
lobbyist at City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   * And Howard Sunkin, a well-known lobbyist for Cerrell &amp;
Associates, represents numerous clients, including Adelphia cable
television and billboard interests.</TE>
<TE>   The coalition is only the latest of secession opponents with roots
at City Hall. Besides the mayor, Council President Alex Padilla and
Councilmen Nick Pacheco, Eric Garcetti and LaBonge have established
committees.</TE>
<TE>   Miscikowski said the Public Safety Coalition grew out of previous
efforts to promote bond issues to build fire and police stations.</TE>
<TE>   The councilwoman, whose district until recently included parts of
the San Fernando Valley, said she opposes secession because the
Valley "just can't get the same or better services for less money."
If secession passes, the only alternative will be to cut services,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Miscikowski said coalitions are an important part of the political
process. Just because some lobbyists are helping council members try
to defeat secession does not mean that the current alliance would
color future decisions, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss agreed, saying he makes decisions based on an issue's
merits, not on lobbyists and campaign contributions.</TE>
<TE>   If the Valley secedes, Weiss said, the new city would have few
options for police protection--to start its own force from scratch or
contract with the LAPD or Sheriff's Department for services.</TE>
<TE>   Valley voters need to know that "when it comes to public safety,
bigger is better," Weiss said. Remaining a part of Los Angeles offers
the Valley the best protection in the event of an earthquake, a North
Hollywood shootout or a terrorist act, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Weiss and other council members defended the alliance
between elected officials and leading lobbyists, others have
questioned whether that relationship is appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   "How is the public supposed to ignore the fact that such large
amounts of money" are being raised by lobbyists, asked LeeAnn Pelham,
the executive director of the city's Ethics Commission. "Lobbyists
have a stranglehold on the money," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the council has been unwilling to act on the Ethics
Commission's proposals to restrict the ability of council members to
vote on issues involving lobbyists who double as political
consultants for the same officials, she added.</TE>
<TE>   She urged the council to take swift action to enact the reforms in
order to establish "an arm's length distance between money and
governmental action."</TE>
<TE>   Afriat opposes the commission proposals to restrict the ability of
lobbyists to run campaigns. He said "it's just ridiculous" to assume
that "because somebody pays us, then they owe us something."</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, he said, it's simplistic to presume that when people
contribute to a cause like opposing secession that they do so only
because of their future business interests.</TE>
<TE>   "People who do business with the city of L.A., who have
relationships with the city of L.A., are, of course, going to
respond" to anti-secession fund-raising appeals, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Roski's campaign contributions are not the reason he was
successful in winning approval for creation of an entertainment
district next to Staples Center, Afriat said.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Roski did well before the City Council because he built a
beautiful [arena] in downtown Los Angeles," Afriat said.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking for the secession effort, Katz cast the matter in
different terms.</TE>
<TE>   He said the downtown stadium issue is not dead but merely
hibernating until after the election. And he predicted that once the
election is over "you'll see a football stadium, a redevelopment area
and the question of public subsidies has been bought and paid for by
special interest money."</TE>

<HD>FDA Studies Cancer Risk From Baked, Fried Foods</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Concerned about a chemical only recently discovered in food, the Food
and Drug Administration said Monday that it was starting an
investigation to see whether people risk getting cancer from eating
fried and baked goods.</LD>
<LD>   The chemical, acrylamide, has for years been designated as a
possible or probable carcinogen--a cancer-causing agent. But no one
thought it was in food until last year, when Swedish scientists
announced they had found it in fried foods, and some breads and other
foods baked at high temperatures.</LD>
<LD>   The World Health Organization confirmed the findings and urged
further research.</LD>
<TE>   "It is clear that acrylamide is a problem," FDA Deputy
Commissioner Lester Crawford said. "It doesn't need to be in food."</TE>
<TE>   But no one knows whether acrylamide causes cancer in people, and
if so, what amounts are dangerous, what foods it is in or whether it
can be removed.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA is busy testing baby food, canned beans, cereals,
chocolates, cookies, crackers, French fries, infant formulas, nuts,
nut butters, potato chips, meat and other foods, Dr. Lauren Posnick
of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Nutrition told a public
meeting on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   She said her team had sampled 150 of 600 targeted foods.</TE>
<TE>   French fries and potato chips had a varying amount of acrylamides,
some with a high amount. Some crackers and nuts also contained the
compounds.</TE>
<TE>   Acrylamide has been found to cause cancer in laboratory animals
but never has been linked to human cancer.</TE>

<HD>AOL to Start Issuing 'Amber Alerts' on Web</HD>
<DH>Safety: Officials worry notices of missing children may
become too common. The online service would join a planned national
system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARIANNE ARYANPUR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Internet provider America Online and the National Center for Missing
and Exploited Children are launching an online version of "Amber
alerts," the system that has been used in more than 15 states to try
to locate missing children, officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The initiative, which AOL said is the first of its kind, allows
its customers who register online for the service to receive e-mail
alerts via computer, mobile phone or pager that a child is missing.
Under the Amber alert system, when law enforcement concludes that a
child is missing, officials immediately release the information to
participating local media such as television and radio. In some
states, such as California, the public is also notified through road
signs.</LD>
<LD>   "Now, law enforcement has just added AOL to that list," said
Tatiana Gau, AOL senior vice president of integrity assurance. As
soon as law enforcement officials notify AOL that an alert has been
issued, AOL will forward the alert to those paying customers, over
age 13, who request the notice.</LD>
<TE>   "What this offers across the country is the ability to essentially
use a secondary response system that reaches people online," said
Ernie Allen, president of the National Center for Missing and
Exploited Children.</TE>
<TE>   AOL will officially unveil the program today as President Bush,
members of the National Center for Missing Children, law enforcement
and parents of abducted children convene at the White House's first
conference on missing, exploited and runaway children.</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Kay Bailey
Hutchison (R-Texas) are sponsoring legislation that would set up a
nationwide Amber alert system and provide federal funds to states and
counties that do not have resources to make the program work.</TE>
<TE>   The Amber system--which stands for America's Missing: Broadcast
Emergency Response--was named after Amber Hagerman, a 9-year-old girl
who was kidnapped and murdered in Texas in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   The missing children's center estimates that 30 children have been
rescued with help from Amber alerts in six years.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question that Amber alerts have been successful in
capturing suspects and in returning children safely to their
families," said Los Angeles Police Department spokesman Sgt. John
Pasquariello.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing that we need to be concerned about is
oversaturation or overuse of the system where we get into a 'cry
wolf' situation where people may start ignoring the alerts."</TE>
<TE>   "What is most important with this system is that it is reliable
and that we use it [judiciously]."</TE>
<TE>   While Gau acknowledged the potential for dulling the public's
attention, she said AOL will issue alerts only to those of AOL's 26
million U.S. members who register to receive them. It will function
like the company's existing alerts, which issue news and weather
warnings to registered members.</TE>
<TE>   According to AOL officials, members will also have the option of
receiving alerts from nearby states, so that a user from California,
for instance, could receive alerts from Nevada and Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   The joint initiative comes after a summer of missing child cases
that garnered national media attention--one of the most prominent of
which involved 14-year-old Elizabeth A. Smart, who was abducted from
her Salt Lake City bedroom while her parents slept.</TE>
<TE>   Pasquariello said media coverage contributes to the notion that
missing child cases are on the rise. "The reality is that children
aren't abducted at epidemic rates," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 63 cities, states and counties that presently have Amber
alerts, 58 have signed up for the AOL service, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "We know in these cases that time is the enemy and that if we can
provide people with timely and reliable information through this
online system, we can help solve these cases," Allen said.</TE>
<TE>   The AOL service is a "step in moving toward national coordination
efforts on Amber alerts," Gau said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Jeb Bush issued a temporary stay of execution for one of the
nation's only female serial killers because of questions about
whether Aileen Wuornos is mentally competent to drop her appeals.</LD>
<LD>   Bush also issued a similar stay for Rigoberto Sanchez-Velasco, a
triple killer who also dropped his appeals. He had been scheduled to
die by lethal injection Wednesday, and Wuornos, convicted a decade
ago in a widely publicized series of killings, was set to die Oct. 9.</LD>
<LD>   However, both executions will be carried out as scheduled if three
psychiatrists who examine the death row inmates today conclude that
the condemned killers are competent to be executed.</LD>
<TE>   Under state law, the standard for competency is understanding that
execution will result in death and why the sentence is being imposed.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Eleven female workers who claimed they were raped or sexually
harassed by their supervisors at DeCoster Farms will share in a
$1.5-million settlement.</LD>
<LD>   The deal announced by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission settles a discrimination lawsuit filed on behalf of the
Mexican women in August 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Iowa Ag-Construction Co., which recruits workers for several egg
farms in northern Iowa, also was named in the suit and agreed to the
deal. Neither company admitted liability.</LD>
<TE>   The suit claimed that five of the women, who worked as egg packers
at four DeCoster Farms plants in Wright County, were raped or abused
by supervisors, who threatened to have them fired or killed if they
did not submit. Identities of the women were not made public.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the settlement money will go to the Iowa Coalition Against
Domestic Violence, and $125,000 will be held for victims who may come
forward later, the federal commission said.</TE>

<LD>   Faced with a choice between endorsing the controversial bill
passed by Congress and shutting down U.S. diplomatic activity, Bush
put his signature on the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for
2003, which gives the administration more than $4 billion for running
the State Department.</LD>
<LD>   In a written statement, Bush said U.S. policy regarding Jerusalem

<LD>   Jason Koller, 29, was elk hunting northeast of Soda Springs on
Saturday with his 50-year-old father, Nolan, when Jason came across a
mother bear with cubs.</LD>
<LD>   "The wind was in our favor, so there was no scent for the bear to
pick up, and she just walked right into him," Nolan said.</LD>
<TE>   Hearing the commotion, Nolan sprinted to help his son. When he
arrived, Nolan said the bear was on top of his son, mauling him.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing Nolan, the 200-pound bear got off Jason and charged. Nolan
waited until the bear was close, then shot it through the neck.</TE>
<TE>   The arrow stopped the bear cold and killed it, a state official
said.</TE>

tried to pass through airport security in Atlantic City with a pair
of scissors and two box cutters, the FBI said.</LD>
<LD>   The man apparently had no ties to terrorism, a U.S. official said.</LD>
<LD>   Nikolay Volodiev Dzhonev, 21, was charged with attempting to board
an aircraft with a concealed weapon, a felony, the FBI said.</LD>
<TE>   He was being held on $100,000 bail, but the FBI said he would
probably be released on his own recognizance.</TE>
<TE>   Dzhonev was arrested Sunday as he was about to board a flight to
Myrtle Beach, S.C.</TE>
<TE>   A search of his backpack turned up scissors embedded in a bar of

<HD>Counterculture Figure's Trial in Slaying Begins</HD>
<DH>Court: A prosecutor says Ira Einhorn killed his
ex-girlfriend and left her in his closet in 1977.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Ira Einhorn jealously murdered his former girlfriend in a classic
case of domestic violence, and even wrote a poem after he struck
another ex-lover with a bottle and tried to strangle her, a
prosecutor charged Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The poem was titled "An Act of Violence," Assistant Dist. Atty.
Joel Rosen told the jury during opening arguments in the trial of the
onetime counterculture figure.</LD>
<LD>   "Suddenly it happens. Bottle in hand I strike away at the head. In
such violence, there may be freedom," Rosen quoted Einhorn as
writing.</LD>
<TE>   "He had his own little bizarre philosophy of violence," Rosen said
as Einhorn stared intently at the jurors. "This defendant believed in
the use of violence when breaking up a relationship."</TE>
<TE>   Einhorn, 62, fled Philadelphia just before going on trial in 1981
on charges of killing Helen "Holly" Maddux and placing her body in a
locked trunk in a closet of his apartment. He remained a fugitive in
Europe until his capture in France in 1997 and used legal maneuvers
to avoid extradition until last year.</TE>
<TE>   In his opening statement, defense lawyer William T. Cannon said
Einhorn left the city because he believed the district attorney was
withholding information that could help him during the trial and was
"not playing with a fair deck."</TE>
<TE>   Cannon said the "$64,000 question" in the case was who killed
Maddux and put her body in the trunk.</TE>
<TE>   Maddux, a former student at Bryn Mawr College, had decided to end
a stormy five-year relationship with Einhorn, the prosecutor said,
and had traveled to Philadelphia after threats that he would throw
her belongings into the street.</TE>
<TE>   "I just have to go down and get Ira off the wall," Rosen quoted
Maddux as telling her new boyfriend before she arrived at Einhorn's
apartment on Sept. 10, 1977.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the last day anybody saw Holly alive again," the
assistant district attorney told the court. "She literally
disappeared off the face of the planet. Nobody heard from her at
all."</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor said Einhorn ran "for one reason only: He didn't
want to face the evidence at his trial" and came back "kicking and
screaming."</TE>
<TE>   "Even after 25 years, the case is overwhelming against the
defendant," Rosen concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Einhorn, whose lawyer promised he would take the witness stand in
Common Pleas Court, contends that the CIA framed him because he had
learned of secret government mind-control experiments.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things that attracted Holly to Ira was his great
mind," Cannon told the jury, "not a mind stupid enough to keep a body
in his closet."</TE>
<TE>   The lawyer characterized Einhorn as a philosopher, futurist and
leader of the counterculture underpinnings of Philadelphia decades
ago. He said his client had once run for mayor and was appointed a
Kennedy fellow at Harvard in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   Rosen said there would be testimony that downstairs neighbors were
so distressed by a foul-smelling liquid dripping from Einhorn's
closet that they had to move out of their apartment.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor said witnesses would testify hearing "loud thumps
upstairs" and a woman screaming about the time of Maddux's
disappearance, that Einhorn had refused to let workers into the
closet and had stopped subletting his apartment when he was
traveling.</TE>
<TE>   Rosen said Einhorn attempted unsuccessfully to move the trunk and
had asked two girls to dump it in the river "because it was filled
with secret Russian papers."</TE>
<TE>   When the prosecutor was finished, many of the jurors looked
stricken--prompting Cannon to begin his opening argument with a
question.</TE>
<TE>   "Ladies and gentlemen on the jury," he said, "anyone think the
case is over right now?"</TE>
<TE>   The lawyer said Maddux was preparing to rent an apartment only a
block from Einhorn's home, and they had made reciprocal
wills--indicating that the relationship was not over.</TE>
<TE>   Cannon said that he would present three witnesses who would
testify seeing Maddux after the date the prosecution said she was
killed and that experts called by the defense would dispute
laboratory tests and autopsy findings during the murder
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   While a fugitive in 1993, Einhorn was tried in absentia in
Philadelphia and found guilty of murder. No defense lawyer was
present during the proceedings, and he was sentenced to be executed
upon his return.</TE>
<TE>   But after his capture, courts in France found the trial held
without Einhorn intolerable and temporarily freed him.</TE>
<TE>   In response, the Pennsylvania Legislature passed a law granting
Einhorn a second trial with the promise that he would not receive the
death penalty if convicted. As part of the arrangement, the first
conviction was thrown out.</TE>

<HD>Senate May Put Off Action on Homeland Security</HD>
<DH>Legislation: A stalemate over worker rights may give way to
debate on an Iraq war resolution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>For months, Democratic and Republican congressional leaders have
declared that creating a Department of Homeland Security is a
priority.</LD>
<LD>   But after four weeks of stalemate, the Senate is on the verge of
postponing action on legislation to do so as it prepares to debate a
White House request for a resolution authorizing possible war with
Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Today, the Senate is scheduled to vote on a motion to cut off a
Republican-led filibuster on homeland security and force a vote on a
Democratic plan. Lacking the required 60-vote "supermajority" needed
to end the filibuster, the motion is expected to fail as Republicans
and Democrats split largely on party lines over a matter involving
the rights of employees in the proposed department. Several similar
attempts to wrap up the bill in recent days have also foundered.</LD>
<TE>   Afterward, according to a Democratic leadership aide, the Senate
could set aside the homeland security bill to begin debate on Iraq as
early as Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   No one is ready to call the homeland security bill dead. The
Republican-led House passed its version in July, and Senate
Democratic leaders indicate that they will return to the issue after
dealing with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   But with lawmakers at an impasse on key personnel and management
issues for the new department, time is running out for compromise as
Congress nears adjournment. The approach of the Nov. 5 elections is
raising the political stakes even higher.</TE>
<TE>   In the first national elections since the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, no candidate wants to be accused of standing in the way of a
federal initiative to fend off terrorist threats to cities, towns,
coastal waters and national airspace.</TE>
<TE>   Some senators in close-fought races, such as those in Georgia and
South Dakota, may be vulnerable to such arguments, however.</TE>
<TE>   Day after day, President Bush has used the White House bully
pulpit to remind voters that Congress has failed to give him a bill
he requested in a nationally televised speech on June 6. The
president usually points to the Senate as the reason for the delay.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer reiterated
the importance of the homeland security bill, which would authorize
the most significant government reorganization in more than 50 years,
folding all or part of 22 federal agencies into one Cabinet
department with as many as 170,000 employees.</TE>
<TE>   The department, larger than all others except Defense and Veterans
Affairs, would take over duties now performed by the Coast Guard, the
Customs Service, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the
Transportation Security Administration, the Secret Service and other
offices in the executive branch. The concept is to bring a new focus
to domestic security by having all of the agencies report to one
Cabinet secretary.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to protecting our country, and it's unimaginable
that the Senate would fail to act on homeland security," Fleischer
told reporters on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans, who with few exceptions back the president, are
laying plans for fierce attacks against Democrats if the bill is not
finished soon. They criticize Democratic senators who oppose Bush
administration proposals to preserve the president's current
authority to suspend collective bargaining rights for workers in
sensitive posts and to expand his authority to hire, fire, demote and
promote employees in the name of fighting terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   In Georgia, for instance, GOP Rep. Saxby Chambliss, who is
challenging Democratic Sen. Max Cleland, sent the incumbent a letter
on Monday urging him to do what the state's other Democratic senator,
Zell Miller, has already done: back the Bush position on homeland
security.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot understand why you have chosen to obstruct the
president's efforts to increase our nation's security," Chambliss
wrote to Cleland.</TE>
<TE>   In a heated South Dakota race, Republican Rep. John R. Thune,
challenging Democratic Sen. Tim Johnson, has made a similar point.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Allen, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial
Committee, said Democrats are siding "with the unions over the
president's call to move things forward on homeland security. It has
the potential to be an issue. People are talking about this."</TE>
<TE>   Tovah Ravitz-Meehan, spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee, said, "The American people want a thoughtful
discussion and debate on this issue. That's why these people are
elected to Congress, not to rubber-stamp things."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats contend that they are not blocking the bill, and
Cleland, who has co-sponsored a homeland security bill with Sen.
Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), depicts himself as a leader on the
issue. The Democrats point out that it is the Republicans who are
filibustering a Democratic-favored compromise on worker rights.</TE>
<TE>   Under that compromise, brokered by Sens. John B. Breaux (D-La.),
Ben Nelson (D-Neb.) and Lincoln Chafee (R-R.I.) and supported by
government unions, the president would have certain powers to
overhaul civil service rules for the new department but would have to
accept some limits on his ability to suspend collective bargaining
rights.</TE>
<TE>   In a speech on the Senate floor, Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.)
denounced what he called the president's refusal to bend.</TE>
<TE>   The White House position, Dorgan said, "is either our way or no
way, and if it's not our way, we intend to go to fund-raiser after
fund-raiser and criticize" Democrats. Dorgan said congressional
Democrats could claim credit as the first to push for a Homeland
Security Department, proposing a government reorganization months
before Bush did.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Robert F. Bennett (R-Utah) replied that Bush and his
Republican allies were merely holding out for a bill that would give
the administration the greatest leeway in creating and managing the
new department.</TE>

<HD>Ozone Hole Called Smallest Since 1988</HD>
<DH>Nature: Phenomenon is linked to large weather patterns,
which caused the hole to split in two.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>This year's Antarctic ozone hole is the smallest since 1988, but this
has little to do with earthly activities and much to do with weird
weather in the stratosphere, government scientists said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The ozone hole has split into two pieces, a new wrinkle on a
phenomenon scientists first observed in the 1970s and have tracked as
one measure of the effect of pollution.</LD>
<LD>   The 2002 edition of the ozone hole covers about 6 million square
miles, well below the 9 million square miles seen for the last six
years at this time of year. Late September is generally the time
scientists see the most ozone loss.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the smallest ozone hole since 1988, but that's still a
lot of ozone loss," said Paul Newman, an ozone researcher at NASA's
Goddard Space Flight Center outside Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The ozone layer shields Earth from the sun's ultraviolet
radiation, a cause of skin cancer in humans and potentially deadly to
crops and animals. Without it, there would be no life on this planet.</TE>
<TE>   The small size of this year's ozone hole is caused by unexpectedly
large weather patterns in the stratosphere, the layer of the
atmosphere about six miles to 30 miles above Earth's surface where
the ozone layer is found.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, stratospheric weather in the extreme Southern Hemisphere
is placid, allowing for a large ozone hole to open up, Newman said.
This year, mammoth weather patterns pumped ozone into the southern
polar region and warmed it.</TE>
<TE>   "The warm air actually shuts down ozone loss," Newman said.</TE>
<TE>   The strange stratospheric weather also caused the ozone hole to
divide into two lobes, instead of staying in one blob generally
centered over Antarctica, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The ozone hole is caused by the chemicals chlorine and bromine,
which are in chlorofluorocarbons and halons, human-made chemicals
once used in hair spray, refrigerators and car air conditioners.</TE>
<TE>   Chlorofluorocarbons and halons were banned in 1995 because of
their destructive effect on the ozone layer, but they are so
long-lasting that at this rate, the ozone hole will not disappear
until 2050 or so, Newman said.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ANNAPOLIS JUNCTION, Md.</DL>
<LD>A lieutenant colonel at the Army War College pleaded guilty Monday to
killing his wife, saying he beat and strangled her as they fought
about his use of the Internet to find pornography.</LD>
<LD>   Lt. Col. David Bartlett Jr., 46, reached a plea deal with
prosecutors in the slaying of his 39-year-old wife, Suzanne.</LD>
<LD>   Bartlett pleaded guilty to unpremeditated murder, the military
equivalent of second-degree murder. Prosecutors, who had charged him
with premeditated murder, dropped counts of assault and obstruction
of justice.</LD>
<TE>   Bartlett faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole
at sentencing next month.</TE>
<TE>   According to Bartlett, the couple argued for several days after
his wife discovered he had been viewing pornography on the Internet.
On March 19, he said, he beat her with an iron pestle and strangled
her with a computer cord after she harassed him, called him names and
shoved him.</TE>
<TE>   Her body was found floating in a creek.</TE>

Hart Senate Office Building, which police sealed for 40 minutes after
the discovery of a piece of paper with the word "smallpox" on it.
Workers were told to remain in their offices as police tested the
paper, but nothing was found on it. "There is no threat here," said
Capitol Police Chief Terry Gainer, who said the paper looked like
notes about testing or being tested for smallpox. Anthrax spores were
detected in the building last October, necessitating a three-month
shutdown.</CP>

<HD>Officials Skeptical as Detainees Say Sept. 11 Was First in
a Trio</HD>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Sept. 11 attacks may have been planned as the first of three
terrorist strikes in the United States, each progressively bigger and
more devastating than the last, U.S. officials said Monday, citing
recent interviews with captured Al Qaeda operatives.</LD>
<LD>   Two U.S. officials said the information comes from several
sources, including detainees at Guantanamo Bay. But they stressed
that it has not been corroborated and that the sources may be
unreliable or purposefully deceptive.</LD>
<LD>   "We've heard it from more than one source," one of the U.S.
officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "The national
security [investigators], of course, are thinking chemical,
biological and nuclear [attacks].... It's pretty chilling stuff, but
we don't have all the information."</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the trial of Zacarias Moussaoui, the only person
charged in the United States in connection with the Sept. 11 attacks,
was postponed from January until June after Moussaoui and his standby
legal team complained about the overwhelming amount of materials he
has to examine and the recent disruption of his trial preparation.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. marshals conducted several lengthy searches of Moussaoui's
cell and an adjoining work room to recover several dozen classified
documents that the Justice Department inadvertently handed over to
him among hundreds of thousands of pages of discovery materials.
Justice Department officials said they believed Moussaoui did not
read any of the classified materials, which were in stacks of other
documents and not marked as classified.</TE>
<TE>   In postponing the trial, U. S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema said
Moussaoui could never get through all of the government documents
provided to him by the scheduled trial date of Jan. 6, and that the
recent government searches also took away time from his efforts to
act as his own lawyer and prepare his defense.</TE>
<TE>   "Although this is the second continuance sought in this case, the
court finds that all parties have demonstrated compelling reasons for
justifying an extensive continuance of pretrial and trial proceedings
which outweigh the interests of the public and the defendant in a
speedy trial," Brinkema wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Failure to delay the trial, she added, "could result in a
miscarriage of justice and would not provide all the parties a
sufficient opportunity to adequately prepare for a trial."</TE>
<TE>   Brinkema also ordered that Moussaoui be given a bigger cell after
he complained that the rooms were too small to hold all of the
paperwork, computer disks and videotapes. The documents have been
provided to Moussaoui--who is being held in solitary
confinement--because he is acting as his own lawyer, although he has
a court-appointed team of defense lawyers standing by.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui's cell was so packed with court documents that some were
piled high on the toilet, said one person familiar with his
incarceration. "It was not a good situation," said the source. "My
understanding is that it is piled floor to ceiling and that if some
of it fell, it would bury him."</TE>
<TE>   Brinkema agreed, describing the tiny, windowless space as being
both "inhumane and an unreasonable barrier to his ability to work
with the materials produced to him."</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui, a 34-year-old Frenchman of Moroccan descent, has been
charged with six counts of conspiracy, four of which carry the death
penalty. He has denied playing any role in the hijackings but has
admitted to being a member of Al Qaeda and has called publicly for
the destruction of the United States and Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui, whose court filings are often filled with colorful
language, had filed a "Motion to Get a Bigger Cave to Prepare the WTC
(World Top Circus)"--an apparent reference to the World Trade Center,
described in some court documents as the WTC. His motion for a delay
in the trial was titled, "Motion to Get Time Out Added in the Dirty
Game of U.S."</TE>
<TE>   The second postponement is unusual for the Eastern District of
Virginia, which is known as the "rocket docket" for its speedy
trials.</TE>
<TE>   Since Moussaoui's indictment late last year, the Justice
Department has pressed for an early court date and opposed two
previous motions by Moussaoui and his defense team for continuances
in the case. One of those requests was granted in August, and the
trial date was pushed back from its initial September date.</TE>
<TE>   Brinkema set May 27 for the start of jury selection and June 30 as
the first day of trial.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors in the Moussaoui case also released more
information about a mysterious phone number they said connected
Moussaoui to one of the 19 hijackers in the Sept. 11 attacks. Last
week, the prosecutors alleged the link by saying that hijacker Ziad
Samir Jarrah had a business card on him with a phone number that had
been called by Moussaoui. Jarrah is believed to have been the pilot
of the hijacked plane that crashed in a Pennsylvania field after some
passengers confronted the hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui's defense team, in a court motion, sought more
information about the alleged link, calling it a "thin reed" at best.
On Monday, Paul J. McNulty, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of
Virginia, said the charred business card recovered in a Pennsylvania
field also had an address on the back, and that both the address and
phone number were used by Ramzi Binalshibh, a man authorities say was
meant to be the 20th hijacker before he was kept out of the country.
Binalshibh later wired money to Moussaoui and tried to help him take
his place on a plane, some authorities have alleged.</TE>
<TE>   "Thus the connection between defendant Moussaoui and Jarrah is far
more than a 'thin reed' as argued by standby counsel," McNulty wrote.
"The connection is Binalshibh."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities on Monday also expressed caution about the recent
disclosures by some Al Qaeda prisoners warning of more major
terrorist attacks. Since days after Sept. 11, authorities have said
they were concerned about a possible "second wave" of attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The indications that there might be at least two other major
attacks in the works is being aggressively investigated, authorities
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is serious but the attitude is, 'What are you going to do
about it?' " said one official. "If there was anything of a huge
scale, bigger than Sept. 11, in the pipeline, we think we would have
been given a clearer picture, that somebody would have said
something."</TE>
<TE>   "You can't dismiss it out of hand," added a second U.S. official,
"but it would be wrong to attach too much significance to comments
along those lines because they are not corroborated."</TE>

<HD>Torricelli Drops Reelection Bid, Clouding Battle for Senate</HD>
<DH>Politics: Hurt by ethics issue, N.J. Democrat alters the
picture on upper house control, sets off a legal battle over
replacing him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Embattled Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.) withdrew from his race for
reelection Monday, scrambling the national battle for control of the
Senate and inciting a legal confrontation over whether New Jersey
Democrats can place a new candidate on the ballot.</LD>
<LD>   Damaged by revelations about expensive gifts he had accepted from
businessman David Chang, Torricelli was trailing in recent polls to
Republican nominee Doug Forrester, manager of a pharmaceutical
benefits management firm.</LD>
<LD>   National Democrats considered Torricelli, who was completing his
first Senate term after 14 years in the House, their most endangered
incumbent.</LD>
<TE>   His decision to step aside could give Democrats, who have gained
increasing support in New Jersey, an improved chance of holding the
state's seat--and their razor-slim 50-49 Senate majority--if they can
resolve the swirl of political and legal questions about replacing
him on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "I will not be responsible for the loss of the Democratic majority
in the United States Senate," Torricelli declared in a lengthy and
emotional speech in Trenton, N.J. "I will not allow it to happen."</TE>
<TE>   His voice cracking, his words teetering at times between defiance
and self-congratulation, Torricelli presented an extended list of his
achievements, but acknowledged that the questions about his ethics
had eclipsed all other campaign issues.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot talk about war and peace or economic opportunity or the
environment or the sanctity of our Constitution.... I can't be
heard," he said. "My voice is not so important that it cannot be
substituted."</TE>
<TE>   But exactly how that substitution could occur is shrouded in
confusion and controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Though the New Jersey Democratic State Committee, with 110
members, has the formal authority to name a successor, in practice
party insiders said the decision would be made by top party officials
and New Jersey's Democratic Gov. James E. McGreevey within 48 hours.</TE>
<TE>   The state Democratic Party plans to file suits today in state and
federal courts to have that new nominee replace Torricelli on the New
Jersey ballot, said Rich McGrath, the party's communication director.</TE>
<TE>   But Republicans instantly signaled they would fight in court any
effort to place a new candidate before the voters. Alex Vogel,
general counsel of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said
New Jersey law barred the parties from replacing their candidates
less than 51 days before the election--which as of today is 35 days
away.</TE>
<TE>   "If there were to be exceptions to the [state] law, it is highly
unlikely that fear of losing an election would be one of them," said
Sen. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.), head of the NRSC.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Forrester said any effort to put a new candidate on the
ballot would "disregard the clear letter of the law."</TE>
<TE>   Speculation on the replacements Democrats would turn to focused on
four names. Several sources said the top choice was former Sen. Bill
Bradley, who decided against seeking reelection in 1996, creating the
vacancy that Torricelli filled. As of Monday night, party officials
had not reached Bradley, who ran for the Democratic presidential
nomination in 2000 and lost to Al Gore. He has been working as an
investment banker.</TE>
<TE>   But most Democrats generally consider him unlikely to enter the
race.</TE>
<TE>   The other likely possibilities, one party strategist said, were
former Democratic Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, a frequent Torricelli
antagonist who stepped down in 2000 after three terms, and Reps.
Frank Pallone Jr. and Robert Menendez.</TE>
<TE>   Torricelli's announcement came just two days after the release of
a poll that showed him trailing Forrester, 47% to 34%.</TE>
<TE>   The senator's aides had questioned the survey's accuracy, but one
senior Democratic official said the campaign's private polling also
showed a precipitous decline over last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The deterioration followed the release of a previously undisclosed
Justice Department memo on Torricelli's relationship with Chang, who
is serving a federal prison sentence for making illegal campaign
contributions to the senator's 1996 campaign.</TE>
<TE>   After a lengthy investigation, the Senate Ethics Committee in July
"severely admonished" Torricelli for accepting a succession of
personal gifts from Chang, including an expensive television and CD
player, while trying to help the businessman receive repayment of a
debt from North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "The committee is troubled by incongruities, inconsistencies, and
conflicts, particularly concerning actions taken by you which were or
could have been of potential benefit to Mr. Chang," the committee
wrote Torricelli.</TE>
<TE>   The panel's finding hurt Torricelli politically, and his situation
suffered again last week when a federal court ordered the release of
the memo from Justice Department prosecutors on the case.</TE>
<TE>   In January, the prosecutors decided not to press charges against
Torricelli. But in the memo, written in May during the sentencing
phase of Chang's trial, prosecutors concluded there was "substantial
corroborating evidence" for Chang's allegations that he provided
Torricelli with thousands of dollars in cash and expensive gifts for
himself and girlfriends. Those allegations went well beyond the gifts
addressed in the ethics committee investigation.</TE>
<TE>   In the letter--whose release Torricelli fought--prosecutors said
that while "the government found Chang's statements ... to be
credible," they did not prosecute because they believed that the
businessman's "fraudulent and deceptive conduct" had undermined his
potential credibility to a jury.</TE>
<TE>   Another hammer dropped on Torricelli last week when a television
station in New York City aired, without commercial interruption, a
38-minute jailhouse interview with Chang.</TE>
<TE>   Chang claimed to have provided Torricelli with more than $150,000
in cash and gifts. Torricelli has denied the allegations. But the
network reported that investigators had tracked $31,000 in cash
spending by Torricelli over a five-year period when he withdrew just
$9,000 in cash from personal accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations against Torricelli have been the centerpiece of
Forrester's campaign. After the prosecutors' letter was released last
week, Forrester called on Torricelli to resign.</TE>
<TE>   Torricelli had tried to depersonalize the campaign, arguing that
the ethics questions surrounding him shouldn't eclipse other
concerns, such as abortion rights, gun control, the environment and
control of the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Yet he showed no sign of succeeding in shifting the focus away
from his personal problems, as he acknowledged Monday. In his
remarks, Torricelli appeared less contrite than frustrated, as he
listed his accomplishments, said again he had "not done the things I
have been accused of doing," and asked, "When did we become such an
unforgiving people?"</TE>
<TE>   Torricelli's departure is likely to improve the odds of the
Democrats holding the seat, several local analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Ross Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers University, said one
risk for Democrats is that voters will see the shift as a backroom
deal that raises "the whole specter of boss-ism."</TE>
<TE>   But, Baker added, Torricelli's resignation will force Forrester to
alter his strategy. With Torricelli gone, Baker noted, Forrester must
now swim upstream against the state's increasing tilt toward the
Democrats over the last decade. In 2000, for instance, Gore carried
the state over George W. Bush by more than 500,000 votes.</TE>
<TE>   "Voters weren't punishing the Democratic Party; it was very
personal [to Torricelli]," Baker said. "Now, Forrester will really
have to make more of his own credentials."</TE>
<TE>   But if the Democrats can't recruit Bradley or Lautenberg--the two
possibilities with statewide name recognition--any other replacement
will face a daunting challenge in becoming quickly known in this
sprawling state, divided between the New York City and Philadelphia
media markets.</TE>
<TE>   Abrasive and ambitious in equal measure, Torricelli frequently
broke with his party on some issues, as he did to support President
Bush's tax cut last year. But his views were often overshadowed by
his intense, acerbic personal style, which led to his nickname, "the
Torch."'</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Torricelli chaired the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee and proved to be an indefatigable fund-raiser and able
strategist. He received partial credit for the Democrats' surprise
gain of five seats in the election.</TE>
<TE>   He cited that work in his speech Monday, saying he "could not
stand the pain" if his failings now cost Democrats their fragile
Senate majority.</TE>

<HD>Ukulele Strikes a New Chord</HD>
<DH>Once a kitsch staple, the instrument is being discovered by
thousands of 'lapsed guitarists.' And the rebirth isn't confined to
Hawaii.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM MURPHY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HONOLULU</DL>
<LD>In the beginning there was the guitar, and the guitar ruled. There
was Eric Clapton playing his hymn to "Layla," there was Jimi Hendrix
celebrating the national anthem on his Stratocaster, George Harrison
gently weeping on six strings.</LD>
<LD>   In the middle of all that came Tiny Tim, strumming what could have
been described only as a musical mutant: four sweet little strings
and a diminutive body you clutched to your chest like a baby. It had
a C chord you could play with one index finger and you tuned it by
singing a ditty on open strings: "My Dog Has Fleas."</LD>
<LD>   The ukulele captured the national imagination--for about as long
as it took Tiny Tim to tiptoe through the tulips in 1968. By the
1970s, the little ukulele was once again set aside in favor of its
more muscular six-stringed sibling. It was put away in garages, sold
at flea markets, relegated to tiki torch hotel lounges in Hawaii and
classics such as "Princess Poo-Poo-Ly Has Plenty Papaya (And She
Loves to Give It Away)."</LD>
<TE>   In testament to the enduring power of the ridiculous over the
transcendent, the ukulele--not as melodious as a banjo, not as
elegant as a mandolin, an instrument upon which power chords sound
like wind chimes--is making another comeback.</TE>
<TE>   By the thousands, baby boomers described by music marketers as
"lapsed guitarists" are admitting to themselves that they will never
stretch their fingers into a guitar F chord again and are buying
ukuleles instead. They're going to workshops, spending $10,000 on
rare collector models, buying uke CDs.</TE>
<TE>   "The uke is coming out of the closet," says Ian Whitcomb of
Altadena, a ukulele musician, songwriter and musical historian. After
years of relative anonymity, Whitcomb now plays gigs all over town
and has written ukulele tracks for movies such as "Stanley's Gig" and
"The Cat's Meow." This summer, he was invited to the prestigious
Oregon Festival of Music.</TE>
<TE>   UkuleleWorld.com, based in Texas, gets as many as 15,000 hits a
month from places as far away as Namibia, Peru and Macedonia. In
Japan, Hawaiian uke stars sell out concerts and home-grown
celebrities such as Yuji Igarashi and Kazuyuki Sekiguchi attract
standing-room-only crowds.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., a Ukulele Hall of Fame Museum is in the planning
stages on the East Coast (a site has not yet been identified).
Ukulele workshops are scheduled this month in Illinois, Missouri and
New Jersey; and in Santa Monica, McCabe's Guitar Shop recently sold
out its annual UKEtopia concert, attracting the biggest turnout ever
for an evening of ukulele gospel and roots music, titled "O Strummer,
Where Art Thou?" Southern California's first ukulele festival is
scheduled for Oct. 19 at Tracy High School in Cerritos and the
Artesia Community Center.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere, though, has the ukulele become so much a cultural
institution as in Hawaii. After long years of exile in tourist hotels
with the old guys in flowered shirts, the ukulele in the last few
years has become hip, the instrument a new generation of Hawaiians
has adapted as a modern rock art form and a statement of Hawaiian
pride.</TE>
<TE>   Young Hawaiians are flocking to the hyper-uke sound of 25-year-old
Jake Shimabukuro of Oahu, whose intense, whirlwind strumming has been
compared to Hendrix's. (He even does an electric version of "The
Star-Spangled Banner," following it with Niccolo Paganini's "Caprice
No. 24," a classical violin piece.)</TE>
<TE>   In Hawaii, the resurgence took off in a big way in 1991, when Troy
Fernandez of the Ka'au Crater Boys stunned young audiences by playing
an electrified uke like a lead guitar: hot and fast. Around the same
time, a 700-pound ukulele songster named Israel Kamakawiwo'ole became
wildly popular in Hawaii--and developed a large cult following on the
mainland as well--after his gentle single "Over the Rainbow" hit the
charts and served as background music in EToys commercials. (The song
was later featured in the NBC show "ER.") "Iz," as he is known,
claimed he was "a Hawaiian man with a heart 10 times bigger than his
body," and when he died in 1997, 20,000 people came to his memorial
in the state Capitol rotunda.</TE>
<TE>   Musicians used the ukulele to sing about the growing ethnic
consciousness of native Hawaiians, in songs such as "Maui Hawaiian
Sup'pa Man." At the same time, a new generation in Hawaii and on the
mainland began to rediscover old standards such as the famous "Aloha
Oe," with words penned by Hawaii's last monarch, Queen Liliuokalani.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of what's going on is the renaissance of Hawaiian music from
back in the '50s," says Mike Young, a Unitarian minister in Honolulu
whose son plays a $400 Kamaka ukulele. "On any given day now, for no
reason in particular, roughly half the kids at school here will have
ukes in their hand, playing them at recess."</TE>
<TE>   It was in Hawaii that the instrument came into its own in the late
19th century, when Portuguese settlers traveled to Honolulu, their
small, stringed braguinhas in hand. The locals listened in rapture to
the Portuguese folk songs, and several Portuguese entrepreneurs
opened shops to begin crafting what the Hawaiians came to call the
ukulele.</TE>
<TE>   The phenomenon spread to the mainland in 1915, when ukulele
performances at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition's
Hawaiian Pavilion in San Francisco touched off a frenzy of
ukulele-buying. Millions more were sold during the 1950s, when radio
and television personality Arthur Godfrey played his on the air, and
it was firmly ensconced in the national cultural fabric when Webley
Edwards hosted his weekly radio broadcast, "Hawaii Calls," from the
courtyard of the Moana Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a call from Hawaii," Edwards would announce, as an
assistant ran with a microphone down to the water to catch the sound
of the Waikiki surf. "And here we meet again beneath the mighty Moana
Banyan, beside the sea, the great panorama of bee-you-tee-ful Waikiki
Beach before us." Then came the sound of slack key guitars, and the
ukulele.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the '50s, the ukulele had pretty much gone
underground again. A few hard-core fans still played records by Cliff
"Ukulele Ike" Edwards (better known for "When You Wish Upon a Star,"
better loved for his uke) and George Formby, but it wouldn't be until
the end of the next decade that Tiny Tim would bring the ukulele to
"Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In" and the "Tonight" show.</TE>
<TE>   Even today, Shimabukuro can get away with playing a ukulele
plugged into a Marshall amplifier. But for most of the world, the
ukulele is meant for whimsical Tin Pan Alley tunes and moonlit
Hawaiian beaches with palms whispering in the trade winds.</TE>
<TE>   It is one of the few accompanying instruments in the world that
cries out for awful lyrics: songs such as "Yaaka Hula Hickey Dula"
and "If You Like a Ukulele Lady, Ukulele Lady Like-a You."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Beloff's Flea Market Music in Studio City has published
ukulele arrangements for everything from '60s hits to gospel. But his
first love was always the old Hawaiian sheet music from the '40s
(written, of course, not for Hawaiians but for the mainland haoles
who frequented their hotels)--the ones with the cover art of a
beautiful woman sitting under a palm tree with a luminous moon rising
over Diamond Head.</TE>
<TE>   What amazed him, he said, was how easily the old tunes could be
adapted to the four strings of the ukulele. It was like they were
made to be played on the uke. Beloff, who moved to Southern
California in the early 1990s to run Billboard magazine, published a
songbook of ukulele arrangements for such classics as "Singin' in the
Rain" and "Five Foot Two." It took off, and Beloff quit his job in
1998 to devote his life to ukuleles. Now, he markets 12 ukulele
songbooks, several CDs and the fluke, the beginner's instrument he
helped design.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, George Harrison showed up at his house with a
friend, another ukulele enthusiast. "He comes in and grabs a ukulele
and just starts singing: 'I'm leaning on a lamppost at the corner of
a street, in case a certain little lady comes by,' " Beloff recalls.
"Then he starts singing 'All My Loving.' And we're singing 'All My
Loving' in my living room with George Harrison on a uke! It was just
too cool."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the secret of the uke's charm, says Geoffrey Rezak, who
recently formed the Ukulele Society of Connecticut, is that you don't
have to be a George Harrison to play it.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I wasn't very musical. I didn't have any talent, and I
wasn't going to take any lessons from anybody. But they say you have
four strings and four fingers, and sure enough, I started playing. I
play 'America,' 'Five Foot Two'--I'm playing songs that actually make
me cry sometimes. But the notes are so high on a ukulele that it's
hard to be sad."</TE>
<TE>   The instrument "has a pleasing plangency," says Whitcomb, who has
the distinction of having beaten Tiny Tim to the punch in the 1960s
when his "Where Did Robinson Crusoe Go With Friday on Saturday Night"
became a hit (on the West Coast, anyway).</TE>
<TE>   "There's a kind of sadness to it, a sad, romantic sound, but also
when it's plucked it has a liveliness to it," Whitcomb said. "All I
know is, whenever you strum a uke, people's faces all light up with
smiles."</TE>
<TE>   This summer, the ukulele went back to its roots, Waikiki Beach,
where a crowd of thousands filled Kapiolani Park for the 26th annual
Ukulele Festival. It was organized by one of the world's leading
ukulele producers, Roy Sakuma, formerly a groundskeeper for the city
of Honolulu. The festival featured performers from Hawaii, the
mainland, Canada and Japan, along with 800 schoolchildren from all
over Hawaii as young as 5.</TE>
<TE>   Enthusiasts from as far as California and Georgia toted their
ukuleles over for the week, propping them up next to picnic baskets.
Beloff was there. So was Herb Ohta of Honolulu, considered the
greatest living ukulele player, and Lyle Ritz, one of L.A.'s
best-known studio guitarists during the 1950s and '60s, who moved to
Oahu a few years ago to play jazz-inspired ukulele full time.</TE>
<TE>   As the stars wound down their performances, Beloff called on those
in the audience to pick up their ukuleles and join in.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, let's have a mass tuneup," Beloff said, plucking the top
string loudly. "There's your top G string. My. C: Dog. Has, E string.
Fleas." The crowd hits "fleas" with a flourish and settles in with a
sense of anticipation to "Under the Boardwalk." Someone holds up big
chord charts under the stage: C! G-7! C!</TE>
<TE>   "We're here in the center of the ukulele universe," Beloff said
happily. "So what else could matter?"</TE>
<TE>   Up on the stage, the Langley Ukulele Ensemble from the small town
of Langley, Canada, rocks into "Proud Mary." School administrator
Peter Luongo has nurtured a ukulele-in-the-schools program there for
21 years; now, the ensemble of current and former students has a
catalog of CDs and tours internationally.</TE>
<TE>   "We set a strategic plan, to say we were going to double the
number of kids studying ukulele. It's tripled," Luongo said.</TE>
<TE>   From "Rolling on a River," they go soft--time for that old
big-moon standby, "The Hawaiian Wedding Song." Luongo takes the crowd
back, back to what it must've been like, listening in the Monarch
Room at the Royal Hawaiian, under the crystal chandeliers and pink
brocade, with the surf of bee-you-tee-ful Waikiki Beach lapping
outside.</TE>
<TE>   I will love you longer than forever, promise me that you will
leave me never.</TE>
<TE>   In the front row, Richard Sparks, a retiree from Spokane, Wash.,
reaches over and takes the hand of his wife, Laura, just as he did 47
years ago on their wedding day. The ukuleles titter like birds.</TE>

<HD>Senators Seek the Right Words to Sway Democrats on Iraq</HD>
<DH>Congress: White House unlikely to trade major concessions
for extra support, sources say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As the Senate prepares for a potentially divisive debate this week on
a resolution authorizing military action against Iraq, negotiations
continued Monday for compromise wording that could increase support
for the measure from Democrats.</LD>
<LD>   Sources close to the talks say the White House is still not likely
to make major concessions to Democrats who want more emphasis on
diplomatic efforts to disarm Iraq and U.N. support for possible
action against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   But with the talks proceeding Monday, Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.) dropped plans to open debate on the resolution
today, postponing it at least until after a Wednesday morning meeting
that the White House called with congressional leaders.</LD>
<TE>   At issue is whether the Bush administration will accept further
concessions to expand support for the resolution among Democrats who
think the president has requested powers too broad and unchecked by
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure how far each side is going to move, but the goal
still remains to get the broadest bipartisan support possible," said
Kori Bernards, a spokeswoman for House Minority Leader Richard A.
Gephardt (D-Mo.).</TE>
<TE>   The push to alter the war authorization was given a bipartisan
boost in recent days as Sen. Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, a respected
GOP leader on foreign policy, joined Senate Foreign Relations
Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) in pushing an alternative
resolution that would be more limited than President Bush's plan.</TE>
<TE>   Sean McCormack, spokesman for Bush's National Security Council,
said the proposal was "too narrowly focused" because it dealt only
with enforcing U.N. Security Council language dealing with weapons of
mass destruction, rather than upholding authority to act against
Hussein in response to Iraqi support for terrorism and threats
against its neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution submitted by Bush two weeks ago requested
open-ended powers to challenge Iraq and promote "peace and security
in the region." That measure is sure to be amended--if only to
incorporate changes that the administration agreed to last week in
response to complaints from members of both parties that the measure
was too broadly worded and should include some consultation with
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   But even those changes were not enough for many Senate Democrats.
And partisan cross-fire over Iraq continued Monday as Republican
leaders criticized the three House Democrats--including Californian
Mike Thompson of St. Helena--who traveled to Baghdad over the
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Thomas M. Davis of Virginia, chairman of the National
Republican Congressional Committee, attacked Rep. Jim McDermott of
Washington for suggesting while in Baghdad that Bush would "mislead
the American people."</TE>
<TE>   "This conduct is outrageous," Davis said. "It is important that
both political parties repudiate these statements, which are far
outside the mainstream of rational political discourse."</TE>
<TE>   The third House member to travel to Iraq was Rep. David E. Bonior
of Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   One GOP senator--Charles Hagel of Nebraska--continued to sound a
cautious note about Bush's push to topple Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "Regime change in Iraq should not be considered as either a
military 'cakewalk' or nation-building on the cheap," Hagel said in a
speech. "We must plan for and think through the 'day after'
scenarios, the costs and commitment to rebuilding Iraq's political
culture and economy."</TE>

<HD>CNN Is Anything but Mickey Mouse</HD>
<DH>Ted Turner has to save the network from being swallowed by
Disney.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEN BODE</AU>
<BD>Ken Bode, a professor of broadcast journalism at
Northwestern University, was moderator of PBS' "Washington Week in
Review" from 1994 to 1999.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Let's not bury the lead. It is time for Ted Turner to take some of
the $2 billion that the money magazines say he has and buy back CNN,
endow it and have it run as the all-news channel it was conceived to
be.</LD>
<LD>   CNN is once again being shopped around. In previous iterations
there was a prospective merger with CBS News or a takeover by NBC.
This time the rumor is that AOL Time Warner will spin off CNN and
allow it to be absorbed by Walt Disney Co. and merged with ABC News,
the stepchild news division owned by Disney.</LD>
<LD>   When Turner initially agreed to sell CNN to Time-Warner, Time's
chief executive, Gerald Levin, called CNN the "jewel in the crown."</LD>
<TE>   It turned out that Levin didn't know what he was buying. All he
knew was that CNN had worldwide reach. That it was the network that
every U.S. newsroom tuned to; that it was the one Boris Yeltsin kept
on in his office, Fidel Castro in his kitchen and Saddam Hussein in
his bunkers. When President Clinton fired cruise missiles at Baghdad
(in response to Iraq's attempt to assassinate former President Bush),
the White House had to call CNN President Tom Johnson to ask what had
been hit.</TE>
<TE>   For working reporters in both companies, the Time-CNN merger
seemed to promise a natural symbiosis. Two strong news organizations
with worldwide reach--one television, one print--was a merger that
appeared to add value to both. Then the culture clash set in.</TE>
<TE>   A team of Time executives paid a visit to CNN's Washington bureau
to examine the new acquisition. They found veteran correspondent
Bruce Morton in his office, and the joshing began. When one of the
blue suits from Time mentioned that they couldn't wait for the day
when they only had to write 150 words, Morton replied, "And we at CNN
can't wait for the day we only have to do it once a week."</TE>
<TE>   On the Time side, once the bean counters and executives began to
understand the vicissitudes of cable television and the
competitiveness of the ratings cycle, the joshing soon turned sour.</TE>
<TE>   One executive complained that Time sends out more Christmas cards
than CNN has viewers. On the CNN side, there was a feeling that the
new owners had no appreciation for what they did, which was cover
real news, worldwide, at less cost than anyplace else in television.</TE>
<TE>   The culture clash morphed into a form of tissue rejection.</TE>
<TE>   Driving to work one day, I heard the news that AOL had bought Time
Warner. Does NPR have it backward, I thought? Time must have bought
AOL. Even at the time of the stratospheric rise of the dot-coms, was
it fathomable that an Internet start-up could purchase a worldwide
publishing conglomerate like Time Warner?</TE>
<TE>   But it was true, and CNN was a small part of the deal, albeit
advertised once again as a priceless part of the package.</TE>
<TE>   Now, like the rest of the Nasdaq overachievers, AOL's stock is
tanking, and the geniuses are looking to unload CNN. If the plan to
merge CNN with ABC News goes through, CNN will become a tiny slice of
the enormous Disney pie.</TE>
<TE>   Disney is one of those enterprises with a huge CEO salary and
ailing market prospects. The last time Disney share prices plummeted,
company executives traveled to Washington to explain to the ABC News
bureau why it would have to sacrifice jobs to the corporate bottom
line.</TE>
<TE>   Next time, it could be CNN producers and correspondents whose jobs
are on the line.</TE>
<TE>   The core value of CNN is not duplicated anywhere else in
television news. It is the network the world turns to when there is
real news to cover, especially foreign news.</TE>
<TE>   ABC, NBC and CBS already have responded to budget constraints by
closing down foreign bureaus. If there is a major labor demonstration
in Paris, all the footage on those networks looks the same because
they all buy it from independent contractors in Europe. CNN has news
crews and correspondents on the ground, reporting from 31 bureaus
around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings and Dan Rather could gather for a quiet
breakfast in the coffee shop of the Baghdad Hilton and no one would
notice. If they were joined by Christiane Amanpour, there would be
100 autograph seekers in five minutes.</TE>
<TE>   If ABC News and CNN are merged, it will be a major step toward
that great nirvana to which we seem to be heading when all television
news looks the same.</TE>
<TE>   Competition used to be considered a healthy thing in journalism,
but with this deal, there would be less of it.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's accountants would quickly find cost savings by closing
competitive CNN-ABC bureaus in Beijing, London, Moscow and perhaps
even Washington. Ted Koppel and "Nightline" would find a new home at
CNN.</TE>
<TE>   Then, when Disney stock slides again, the rest of CNN's overseas
bureaus would be on the chopping block.</TE>
<TE>   In the entertainment-based corporate culture of Disney, news has
no particular value except what it contributes to the bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   Where are you, Ted Turner? CNN is the most important of the many
things you created. Buy it back. Then, if President Bush decides to
blow up the Baghdad Hilton, at least your old network will still be
around to cover the war.</TE>

<HD>Germ of a Message Lies in Silence Over Stem Cells</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD>James P. Pinkerton writes a column for Newsday in New
York. E-mail: pinkerto@ix.netcom.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Milly Kondracke sits in a wheelchair, unable to care for herself,
unable to communicate. Her devoted husband, Morton--the couple will
celebrate their 35th wedding anniversary next week--can only hope she
understands him when he tells her he loves her. Morton Kondracke, of
course, is one of the best-known journalists in Washington, but he is
much prouder of his role in combating Parkinson's disease, which has
afflicted his wife since 1987.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last decade, he has become deeply involved in efforts to
energize Parkinson's research and medical inquiry overall. "I am an
advocate," he says firmly. That advocacy has been successful; indeed,
it's about to go further--rolling over President Bush on the issue of
stem cell research.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, Kondracke published "Saving Milly: Love, Politics, and
Parkinson's Disease." In it, Milly emerges as a tragic symbol, a
symbol to galvanize support for the next round of research, which
Kondracke and most other experts believe will require the expanded
use of embryonic stem cell tissue. And so the political battle is
joined, although it won't be much of a fight.</LD>
<TE>   Embryonic stem cells are derived from fetal tissue--typically,
from a 5-day-old blastocyst, a clump of perhaps 100 cells about the
size of the period at the end of this sentence.</TE>
<TE>   At such an early stage of development, embryonic stem cells can be
converted to any other kind of human cell and thus can be used to
treat a variety of ailments, including diabetes, Alzheimer's and
Huntington's, as well as, potentially, spinal cord injuries.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder so many high-profile victims of disease and accidents,
including Michael J. Fox, Muhammad Ali and Christopher Reeve, have
made common cause on the stem cell issue. Put bluntly, in political
terms, it's a battle between glamorous celebrities and a dwindling
band of religiously oriented conservatives, one of whom, at least in
theory, is Bush.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 9, 2001, Bush went on national television to offer a
compromise: Although no additional stem cell "lines" could be
federally funded, research could continue on existing lines. Further
discussion of the issue was blanked out by Sept. 11, but now it is
cresting again.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 22, California Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation
permitting stem cell research in the Golden State; three days later,
a parade of experts testified before the U.S. Senate about the
deleterious effect of the Bush restrictions on medical progress.</TE>
<TE>   That same night, Nancy Reagan appeared on "60 Minutes II" to talk
about the impact of Alzheimer's on her husband--followed up by an
authorized leak to the New York Times in which she lamented that "a
lot of time is being wasted" because of Bush's strictures. "A lot of
people who could be helped are not being helped," she added.</TE>
<TE>   And what does Bush have to say in response? Not much. He assembled
a commission, which Kondracke dismisses as "stacked" to the right. In
fact, the commission was a model of fairness and balance--which might
explain why it barely agreed with the Bush position, endorsing a
four-year moratorium on stem cell research by a 10-7 vote. Still,
Kondracke is correct when he says that its final report will have "no
effect at all" in stopping continuing research.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the president hasn't addressed the issue since April.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is busy on other issues, of course. And that's the point. A
president can fight only so many wars. Meanwhile, science marches on,
defying politics.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 16, the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center at the University of
Texas announced that it had launched the first clinical trial to
mifepristone as a cancer treatment. Mifepristone is better known as
RU-486, the "morning after pill" that has been opposed by the last
three Republican presidents. It's interesting that the chairman of
the board of visitors at M.D. Anderson is one of those Republican
presidents, George H.W. Bush.</TE>
<TE>   From all this "quietly looking the other way," it seems obvious
that neither Bush worries much about the fate of blastocysts and
fetuses.</TE>
<TE>   For religious conservatives, that may be disappointing news, but
for most Americans, anxious for research to continue, anxious for
cures, that silence is golden.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Saddam Hussein does not shiver with dread at the thought of oil
drills burrowing into the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Reserve.
Some Republican senators apparently hope Americans are simple-minded
enough to believe that tapping this off-limits source of Alaska oil
would bolster the administration's threatened war on Iraq. But it's
not true.</LD>
<LD>   If drillers found the oil that's probably puddled beneath this
delicate ecosystem, it would take oil companies eight to 10 years to
get it to refineries. Even then, these relatively modest deposits
would have a negligible impact on U.S. imports from the Middle East,
experts say. The petroleum industry is likely to find far more oil in
other parts of the world than they would get from the Arctic, and far
sooner.</LD>
<LD>   If the United States really wanted to make the world's oil
suppliers nervous, it would require cars and light trucks to get
better gas mileage. The current standard, an average of 27.5 miles
per gallon, was adopted in 1986, but the actual fuel efficiency for
all vehicles has declined to 24.6 miles per gallon since then.</LD>
<TE>   When the Senate took up Bush's energy plan this year, it defeated
efforts to approve tougher mileage rules on the claim that auto
makers would have to stop producing big sport utility vehicles,
putting mothers and children at risk in puny lightweight
vehicles--again, the Americans-are-simpletons strategy.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Bush's passion to drill in the Arctic rides piggyback
on his energy bill toward a critical crossroads.</TE>
<TE>   The 17 Senate members of the conference committee appointed to
work out differences in the Senate and House versions of the bill are
expected to vote today on whether to include a go-ahead to drill in
Alaska's delicate reserve in the final measure. The Senate rejected
Arctic drilling. The House voted for it, and last week House
conference committee members upheld that position.</TE>
<TE>   There are nine Democrats and eight Republicans on the Senate
conference committee. Usually members uphold positions already
adopted by the full house.</TE>
<TE>   There's a chance that won't happen in the Senate committee. Sen.
John Breaux (D-La.), an early drilling advocate, is the pivotal vote.
We encourage him to uphold the decision of the Senate majority to
protect Alaska's unique habitat for elk, polar bears, musk ox and
snow geese.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, which dodges responsible conservation measures such as
gas mileage restrictions while handing dubious subsidies to the oil
industry, is bad enough as it is. The nation would be better off
without any energy bill if the Senate committee allows Bush's backers
to slide through, on a war-fever gambit, potentially disastrous
drilling in the wildlife refuge.</TE>

<HD>Iraq Endgame at the U.N.</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Saddam Hussein and the White House are moving at diplomatic warp
speed, each maneuvering for advantage with the U.N. Security Council.
Even the resolution the White House has submitted to Congress
formally authorizing U.S. action against Iraq is aimed in large part
at forcing the U.N.'s hand. If the Bush administration is willing to
compromise on its timetable, and if the U.N. is willing to demand
unhindered weapons inspections inside Iraq, war can still be
avoided--or if undertaken, attract the support of key U.S. allies.</LD>
<LD>   Baghdad is pursuing its own two-track policy of threats and
accommodation. After warning the U.S. of bloody consequences last
week if it launches a war, Iraq is now moving to cooperate with U.N.
weapons inspectors in talks at the International Atomic Energy Agency
in Vienna.</LD>
<TE>   The Vienna talks between Iraq and the U.N. are led by Hans Blix,
chief U.N. weapons inspector since March 2000. In 1998, inspectors
left after being stymied by the Iraqi government, and Iraq has not
permitted them to reenter. The talks are intended to establish
practical details for the return of inspectors, including where will
they stay, the location of their headquarters and how their security
will be guaranteed. On Thursday, Blix is to report his findings to
the Security Council. Blix has said he assumes no locations will be
out of bounds, that a tougher new U.N. resolution will not, for
instance, exempt "presidential sites," as the last resolution did.</TE>
<TE>   The question now is just how tough the new resolution will be. The
U.S. and Britain have demanded, in a draft resolution, proven Iraqi
compliance with unfettered inspections on a timetable of 30 days.
Nothing should be excepted, they say, especially Hussein's
presidential palaces, where intelligence analysts believe the weapons
the regime most wants to conceal are stored. The talks on a
resolution have bogged down as the Russians and French balk at what
they see as excessively tough language. Although the administration
should be ready to compromise on its timeline and wording, it should
not budge on the principle of unhindered inspections.</TE>
<TE>   Capitol Hill, when it comes to compromise, is another matter. The
administration wants to make it crystal clear that if the U.N.
doesn't come through, the U.S. will launch its own attack on Iraq.
However, the language of the proposed resolution is too sweeping,
giving the president carte blanche for "regime change" just about
anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   The administration has indicated that it will pull back from such
language, but lawmakers should make sure the presidency isn't
transformed into a global James Bond 007, license unlimited.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. and its allies should ignore Iraqi sleight of hand and
get an inspection resolution passed. Nothing else would do as much to
test Hussein's own willingness to save his nation from war.</TE>

<LD>When 29 West Coast ports that handle about half of the nation's
oceangoing cargo shut down, the already shaky U.S. economy shuddered.
Eighteen-wheelers sit idle, dispatchers twiddle their thumbs and
retailers wonder if they'll get merchandise to fill their shelves.</LD>
<LD>   That's why longshoremen and the shipping lines that pay them owe
it to Americans to accept the Federal Mediation and Conciliation
Service's offer to attempt a brokered settlement to the ongoing labor
dispute that on Sunday led the association that represents ship
owners to close the ports.</LD>
<LD>   Mediation is voluntary. It can take months to generate results
while workers continue at their jobs. But the lockout is costing the
ailing economy an estimated $1 billion daily.</LD>
<TE>   The Bush administration, despite its recent overtures to labor
with its steel tariffs and courtship of the carpenters union, has
signaled its willingness to invoke the Taft-Hartley Act and force
ports to reopen for an 80-day cooling-off period.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't just a West Coast fight. What happens here will set the
template for Eastern ports in 2004. The Pacific Maritime Assn., which
represents international shipping lines and U.S. ports, wants control
over clusters of low-paying clerical jobs being created by
automation. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union worries
that it will lose members unless it absorbs the jobs created as
automated cranes read shipping labels and hand-held scanners replace
labor-intensive pencil-and-paper systems. UC Santa Barbara professor
Nelson N. Lichtenstein describes the clash as a classic case of
workers pushing to claim jobs the new technology generates--while
owners focus on cost-cutting.</TE>
<TE>   Longshoremen believe that they must, as an East Coast union leader
recently said, "capture any and all work relating to the movement of
cargo on and off the docks." The ship owners and port facility
operators are as adamant that they will control the changing face of
labor on the waterfront.</TE>
<TE>   Management should recognize that some jobs merit inclusion in the
union. The union, meanwhile, needs to reassess the support that its
well-paid members would win from other unions, independent truck
drivers, factory workers and others whose paychecks could be
jeopardized by a strike.</TE>
<TE>   Mediation would give both sides time to find a middle ground.
Management has agreed to meet with federal mediators. Union leaders
should join them at the table and make every effort to avoid a strike
that would disrupt manufacturing at U.S. plants that rely on imported
parts--as well as frustrate consumers who buy everything from
imported cars to electronics, garments and housewares.</TE>

<HD>Hawaii Consumers Could Be Stranded</HD>
<DH>Shutdowns: The state imports about 80% of the goods its
residents need. Many already have stocked up on essential items.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A protracted work stoppage at West Coast ports could lead to trouble
in paradise--or at least to a shortage of toilet paper.</LD>
<LD>   Life in Hawaii has not been dramatically altered by the closure of
West Coast ports. But a prolonged shutdown could affect the economy
of the island chain, which imports about 80% of the goods its
residents consume, most of which come via container ships across the
Pacific.</LD>
<LD>   "Almost all of our domestic cargo arrives via the West Coast
ports," said Warren Sugimoto, administrative services officer with
Hawaii's harbors division. "If the [work stoppage] lasts awhile, it
will have a major impact. If it's very short term, the impact would
be negligible."</LD>
<TE>   Hawaii imports about $10 billion of products by ship every year,
the vast majority from the mainland United States, said state
economist Imada Iboshi. The list of goods includes such essential
commodities as food, clothing, automobiles and fuel. The state also
is dependant on the shipping industry to export its agricultural
products, namely pineapple and sugar.</TE>
<TE>   The slowdown in shipping comes at a delicate time for the nation's
50th state, which is still regrouping after being hit hard by the
drop in tourism after last year's Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Hawaii's economy is fragile now," said Leroy Laney, professor of
economics at Hawaii Pacific University in Honolulu. "It's emerged
from the recession that went into effect after 9/11 last year, but
Japanese tourism has come back very slowly. We're certainly not in a
boom period."</TE>
<TE>   The flip side, others said, is that Hawaiians are accustomed to
living life an ocean removed from the mainland United States and
already had begun stocking up on nonperishable consumer goods. A
number of merchants and some consumers said they had not begun to
feel the effects of the dispute between shipping lines and the
dockworkers Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Several weeks ago, when the threat of a dock strike first loomed,
consumers said they began stocking up on certain items.</TE>
<TE>   Honolulu resident Wallace Zoller, strolling through Booth District
Park in central Honolulu with his granddaughter Monday, said he
wasn't concerned about shortages. "I feel comfortable that
everything's going to be OK.</TE>
<TE>   "In any case," he added with a grin, "I do have a stock of toilet
paper and rice right now."</TE>
<TE>   Shipping line Matson Navigation Co., which carries the majority of
Hawaii-bound goods from the West Coast, said islanders began
increasing shipments of nonperishable goods--everything from
construction material to bathroom tissue--after the International
Longshore and Warehouse Union entered contract talks with West Coast
shipping lines and terminal operators last summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Prior to July 1, [shipping] customers began building up their
inventories," said Matson spokesman Jeff Hull.</TE>
<TE>   In a typical week in early fall, he said, four Matson ships would
leave various West Coast ports for Hawaii, loaded with about 3,000
containers total, translating into $8 million in revenue for the
shipping line. He wouldn't say how much the loads have increased in
recent months but said that "a protracted shutdown will be costly" to
Matson's parent firm, Alexander &amp; Baldwin Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, with paper products in good supply, the Outrigger
Hotels &amp; Resorts in Honolulu was working with suppliers to create a
cushion of perishable goods for its restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   "We use a lot of local produce ... but from a meat and poultry
point of view, we're probably 80% reliant on the mainland," said
Barry Wallace, senior vice president of operations for Outrigger. "We
can fly things in, but that raises the cost and limits the quantity,
and it would complicate life considerably."</TE>
<TE>   While many merchants were concerned about getting supplies in,
others were worried about the inability to ship cargo out.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be devastating for us if this goes on for a while," said
Rose Saxby, owner of Puna Certified Nursery Inc., a major foliage
grower on the Big Island.</TE>
<TE>   "We have 10 containers of houseplants waiting to go out from Hilo
Harbor [on the Big Island], and we may have to unpack them," she
said.</TE>

<LD>In "Containment Has Run Its Course" (Opinion, Sept. 29), Robert
Lieber mouths all the usual platitudes about Saddam Hussein being a
dangerous man and jumps to the simplistic conclusion that we've just
got to do something forceful. Like President Bush, he doesn't even
try to answer the questions that need to be answered before starting
another shooting war: Why must we escalate to maximum force rather
than even attempt more inspections? What assurance is there that a
"changed" regime in Iraq would be any better than the present one?
And at what cost in lives, money and lost alliances around the world?</LD>
<LD>   Why don't we talk about the U.S.' sorry history of helping men
become monsters and then saying, "There's a monster! Better take him
out"? We allowed Manuel Noriega to be a drug-running thug until he
became inconvenient; then the elder Bush declared, "A drug-running
thug! Take him out!" We trained Osama bin Laden. We helped Hussein
fight Iran though we knew he was using poison gas. Bush would have us
live in the comfortable myth of white hats and black hats, good
versus evil, studiously overlooking our government's role in raising
the evil.</LD>

<TE>   I am outraged at the Michael Ramirez cartoon of Sept. 27 ("The
tail gunner," Commentary) depicting Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.) as a tail gunner shooting at Bush.</TE>
<TE>   I am neither "pro" nor "anti" our president. I am strongly pro our
country, our Constitution, our world and peace. How dare the
cartoonist suggest that senatorial debate on a subject so grave
should not take place? It is the essence of how we choose to live and
the reason that our form of government has thrived and will continue
to thrive.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Congress will give the president the powers he is
requesting, but for God's sake let them talk about it and weigh the
pros and cons and then make their decision. And let's not attempt to
stifle reason and opposition.</TE>

<TE>   The Democrats lack credibility on Iraq. Many of the Democratic
politicians who oppose meaningful action to rid Iraq of weapons of
mass destruction are the same ones who opposed taking action against
Iraq when it invaded Kuwait 11 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Had their advice been followed then, Iraq would today control
Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf states. It would also have atomic
weapons as well as massive supplies of biological weapons. They were
wrong then and they are wrong now.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, many Americans asked the
question, "Why do they hate us?" A partial answer can be derived from
the debate about invading Iraq. Pundits and politicians have
discussed many of the consequences of an invasion, including American
casualties, the necessity of occupying Iraq for years, the increased
likelihood of terrorism and the effect on the stock market and oil
prices. Yet hardly anyone mentions the Iraqis who will be killed.</TE>
<TE>   During the Gulf War, the United States killed tens of thousands of
Iraqis. This time we can expect the number of Iraqi dead to be even
greater, since overthrowing Hussein will require invading Baghdad
itself. Those whom we will kill have mothers and fathers, sons and
daughters, husbands and wives.</TE>
<TE>   So the answer to the question "Why do they hate us?" is this:
because the price of gas is more important to Americans than the
deaths of 100,000 Iraqis.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Regarding "Comic Salve for Thin Skins" (editorial, Sept. 26) and
Steve Lopez's Sept. 27 column, "Patrons at Real-Life Barbershop Have
No Problem With Movie," let me be quick to say that this is not a
call for censorship or a boycott, but a call for sensitivity. I am
not calling for a boycott of the movie "Barbershop." My only concern
is about the issue of dignity.</LD>
<LD>   I enjoy good comedy. I have long enjoyed the humor of a diverse
group of individuals, from Redd Foxx to Pigmeat Markham. I enjoy the
comedy of Richard Pryor, Bill Cosby and Steve Harvey just as I enjoy
Billy Crystal, Robin Williams, Ellen DeGeneres and David Letterman.
However, the disparaging references in "Barbershop" to Rosa Parks and
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. crossed the line from comedy to tragedy
and from fun to insults.</LD>
<LD>   Today, I hear people of all ages refer to the civil rights
movement in the past tense. This is not a generation gap. This is an
information gap. Civil rights is not a "was" issue, a struggle that
took place "back then." It is not something that should be relegated
to history. It is as current as Donovan Jackson getting his head
slammed onto the hood of a car in Inglewood.</LD>
<TE>   King was the father of the modern civil rights movement. There are
certain historical figures who should never be disrespected, even for
the sake of a few laughs. Their lives represent too much deep meaning
and painful history to demean them through caricature.</TE>
<TE>   Some say that the reaction to the lines in "Barbershop" by the
families of King and Parks were knee-jerk reactions, taken out of
context. People are aware that these odious comments were made in a
particular scene and that they were called into disrepute by the
other people in the shop. I am aware of how the scene played out. I
am also well aware that our own life experiences color how we view
things. Perhaps the pain is etched too deeply into my soul to allow
myself to react any differently. In the end, it is my shortcoming. I
do not see King in abstract terms. I marched with him. I watched him
struggle for us.</TE>
<TE>   I was born in the segregated South and could not attend certain
movie theaters. That is my frame of reference, which is not
dissimilar from millions of Americans who now live in a changed
society, thanks in large part to the actions of King and Parks. We
went on to fight for inclusion in Hollywood. We will continue to
march for and fight for opportunities for writers, producers, actors
and financiers, just as we will keep fighting for civil liberties and
free speech. We admire these artists and are proud of their
breakthroughs. However, the price for glory cannot be too expensive.
Our dignity must remain non-negotiable.</TE>

<LD>By locking out the longshoremen not once but twice (after publicly
threatening to do so several times), management has made it clear
that it never intended to sit down at the table with the
International Longshore and Warehouse Union and bargain in good faith
(Sept. 30). Rather, its plan all along has been to get the federal
government involved in these negotiations in the hope that the feds
could succeed in pulling off what it (the Pacific Maritime Assn.) has
been unable to do, i.e., break the longshoremen's union. But that's
not going to happen. Even invoking the 80-day "cooling-off" period
mandated by the Taft-Hartley Act will not prevent union dockworkers
from honoring their oath of solidarity. In this age of sellouts,
corporate betrayals and phony patriotism, how refreshing is that?</LD>

<TE>   It's very hard to have sympathy for these incredibly overpaid
blue-collar workers who are making $80,000 to $150,000 a year. I am
sure they work very hard at their jobs and have families to support,
but there are many others in professions who also serve the public,
such as teachers and police, who make half that amount. Furthermore,
these inflated salaries cost all of us money, through higher prices
on merchandise. The PMA should stand its ground.</TE>

<TE>   A billion dollars a day is being lost because of the lockout of
longshoremen by the PMA--and the shadow presence of the Bush
administration. Each hour is critical to the nation's economy, yet
the negotiations start in the afternoon and hardly seem to be in good
faith. For the union to protect its workers is the raison d'etre of
the ILWU. In light of the billions of dollars generated because of
the work by longshoremen, it seems little enough to ask of the PMA to
come to an agreement, and soon.</TE>

<LD>"Showing Faith in Discretion" (Sept. 27) is a real eye-opener. I have
long been concerned by the excessive influence exerted on our
national government by evangelical Christians. This excellent piece
exposes what is nothing less than an insidious, illegal, unregistered
lobby abetted by members of Congress. If members were found to be
accepting largess from and furthering the cause of an Islamic
organization, would the regulatory powers that be look the other way?
I think not. Will they do anything about the Fellowship? Not likely.</LD>

<LD>There is a simple way to get rid of commercial spam ("State
Prosecutors Trying to Delete Spam," Sept. 28). Make it illegal to
hire someone to send unsolicited advertising (including political) on
behalf of another person or company (kind of like pandering). The
advertisers must have their contact information, or some way to sign
up (in the case of porn sites) on the spam or they wouldn't be able
to make a sale. Hit them with big fines and they'll stop hiring the
spammers, who will then go out of business. Just follow the money.</LD>

<LD>As I leave the 10 Freeway and pass the Convention Center to reach the
downtown section of the northbound Harbor Freeway, I never mind being
caught in traffic. It gives me more time to study my favorite
painting. As an aging art major, I have studied a great many
paintings in a great many of the world's museums and art galleries.
Kent Twitchell's three-panel mural of musicians of the L.A. Chamber
Orchestra, on the right of the freeway at 7th Street, is my favorite.</LD>
<LD>   Each of the 12 portraits on that mural is exquisite. The slower
the traffic, the more closely I am able to study each of those faces.
If the traffic comes to a complete standstill, that is even better.
But lately, instead of feeling soothed when I study the mural, I have
found myself getting angry. Trees are growing in front of the mural.
They have now grown to the level of the eyes of the woman on the
left. Her violin is long gone, as is her green dress.</LD>
<LD>   Can nothing be done before it is too late? Why did someone allow
fast-growing eucalyptus trees to be planted there? How could that
person be so shortsighted? Trees grow. Is it the responsibility of
the city, or the people who own the parking structure, to move them
or trim them? Can't we get something done before those exquisite
faces are gone forever? Surely I'm not the only person in this city
to whom that mural gives tremendous pleasure.</LD>

<HD>New Security Staff Starting at 4 Airports</HD>
<DH>Safety: Federally trained passenger and baggage screeners
will replace private hires at Burbank facility, among others.
Officials expect minimal inconvenience.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Starting today, Burbank, San Jose, Sacramento and Palm Springs
airports will become the first commercial airfields in California to
begin using federal security personnel to screen passengers and
carry-on baggage, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The four airports join more than 100 others nationwide that
received federally hired and trained screeners for some or all of
their terminals, officials said. Other airports in the state,
including Los Angeles International Airport, are expected to be
federally staffed by Nov. 19, the mandated deadline for implementing
tougher passenger-screening measures.</LD>
<LD>   Together, the four airports will have 495 federal security
officers, each of whom received more than 100 hours of technical and
customer-service training, said David Steigman, a spokesman for the
Transportation Security Administration in Washington, D.C.</LD>
<TE>   Because the federal employees were subject to stricter hiring
standards, passengers are likely to notice "greater professionalism,
greater attention to detail" by the airports' new security staff,
Steigman said.</TE>
<TE>   The time it takes for passengers to walk through metal detectors
and have their belongings X-rayed should be about the same, airport
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "It should be seamless to the passengers," said Noelle Knell,
spokeswoman for San Jose International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   At Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport, passengers can expect to be
processed even more quickly with the opening this week of an
additional screening station, bringing the total number of passenger
checkpoints to four, said spokesman Victor J. Gill.</TE>
<TE>   The federal screeners will replace about the same number of
security staff employed by private companies contracted by the
airports, Steigman said.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, 1.4 million people applied for 33,000 screener jobs.
About 19,000 are in training or have been deployed, transportation
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike private security screeners, many of whom are paid minimum
wage, the federal workers are paid $23,600 to $35,400 a year.</TE>
<TE>   To be hired, applicants must be physically fit enough to lift 30
pounds and pass an eye exam for distinguishing color--a necessity for
scrutinizing items passing through X-ray machines, Steigman said.</TE>
<TE>   They must also be U.S. citizens and pass a test for English
proficiency at the ninth-grade level. Some civil rights groups have
objected to the nationality and education criteria as being
discriminatory to minorities, but Steigman said the agency employs
more nonwhites, in percentage terms, than the U.S. labor pool.</TE>
<TE>   Although all airports are expected to meet the deadline for
improving passenger screening, many have reported they are unable to
implement new baggage-screening technology in time.</TE>
<TE>   Steigman said the transportation agency anticipates granting
extensions to 35 to 40 airports, but declined to name them.</TE>
<TE>   Although all passenger checkpoints at Burbank and Palm Springs
will be staffed with federal screeners, only Terminal A at Sacramento
and Terminal C at San Jose airports will receive the new personnel
today. Other terminals at those facilities will be staffed by
November, officials said.</TE>

<HD>American Is Killed in Australia Plane Crash</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Expert on counterterrorism was one of six
victims. His wife had given up her seat so others could take the
flight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An American counterterrorism expert on his honeymoon and five other
people were killed when a small plane crashed on an island in
Australia's Great Barrier Reef, officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Christopher Le Gallo, 30, had been married less than 10 days when
the Piper Cherokee went down Thursday on Hamilton Island, about 370
miles north of Brisbane. Officials said his wife, Laura, 25, was not
on board the plane because she had given up her seat so four members
of a New Zealand family could fly together to nearby Lindeman Island.</LD>
<LD>   Both the husband and wife worked as counterterrorism experts in
the national and homeland security branch of Science Applications
International Corp., a large, employee-owned research and engineering
firm based in San Diego, said Ron Zollars, a spokesman for the firm.</LD>
<TE>   Zollars said the Le Gallos had worked at the company's offices in
McLean, Va., where the CIA is based.</TE>
<TE>   Reports published in Australia said Christopher Le Gallo was the
son of Andre Le Gallo, a business intelligence consultant in San
Diego who said earlier this year that he is a former CIA agent who
worked for Enron for five years before starting his own firm.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Le Gallo and Laura Koepfler were married Sept. 21 in
Virginia and flew to Australia for their honeymoon, officials said.
They said the couple had been scheduled to make the flight to
Lindeman Island together, but Laura Le Gallo took an earlier flight
so Kevin Bowles, 47, his wife, Joanne, 46, and their children
Michael, 6, and Sophie, 9, could fly together on the six-seat
airplane.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said the single-engine plane apparently tried to turn
back after lifting off from the Hamilton Island airport. The plane
slammed into a low hill, killing the 27-year-old pilot, whose
identity has not been released, and his five passengers.</TE>
<TE>   The accident, which may have been caused by mechanical failure,
was being investigated by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   Several relatives of the deceased and about 60 residents of the
small resort island attended a memorial service Monday for the six
who died.</TE>

<HD>Witness Can't ID Defendant as His Stabber</HD>
<DH>Courts: Testimony begins in trial of Oak View resident also
accused of helping to kill a homeless man near the Ventura River.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Standing shirtless before a jury Monday, a 21-year-old man pointed to
scars on his back and arms to show where he was stabbed during a
violent confrontation with three teens at Ventura's beachfront
promenade last year.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel McGrath removed his shirt and turned his bare back to the
jury after describing how he was stabbed four times while walking
with his pregnant ex-girlfriend. McGrath identified defendant Robert
Coffman as one of the attackers but could not say whether Coffman
wielded the knife.</LD>
<LD>   Coffman, a 19-year-old Oak View resident, is charged with
attempted murder in the July 1, 2001, assault. He is also charged
with murder in connection with the fatal beating of a homeless man on
the same stretch of beach the night before.</LD>
<TE>   Defense attorneys concede that Coffman was involved in the two
incidents, but they contend his role was less than what prosecutors
allege.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony in Coffman's trial got underway Monday, and McGrath was
one of the first witnesses called to the stand. He told jurors that
three months before the stabbing, he was threatened by 15-year-old
Kenny Valentine, who mistakenly suspected him of showing disrespect
to an elderly family member.</TE>
<TE>   McGrath testified that on the night of July 1, Valentine saw him
on the promenade with his ex-girlfriend and confronted him, saying to
his friends, "This is the one that was talking trash about my
grandmother."</TE>
<TE>   McGrath said he tried to explain to Valentine that there was a
misunderstanding but Coffman slapped him. McGrath said he was later
knocked to the ground, he thought by Valentine, and then stabbed.</TE>
<TE>   On cross-examination, McGrath acknowledged that he had never seen
Coffman before and was unable to pick him out of a police photo
lineup. He was unable to identify the third teen. He also admitted
that he previously identified Valentine as the likely stabber.</TE>
<TE>   In other testimony Monday, county Medical Examiner Ronald
O'Halloran said that the homeless man found beaten near the beach on
the morning of June 30, 2001, died from multiple blows to the head.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors contend that 58-year-old James Clark, a military
veteran who camped in an area near the mouth of the Ventura River
known as Hobo Jungle, was kicked, beaten and stoned by four teens,
including Coffman, as they walked to a beach party and bonfire.</TE>
<TE>   Two maintenance workers found Clark dead in his sleeping bag the
morning after the assault, according to court testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Autopsy results indicate Clark sustained a fractured skull, a
crushed kidney, a broken rib and numerous bruises and abrasions. At
death, the 5-foot, 6-inch man weighed 123 pounds, including his
clothes and sleeping bag.</TE>
<TE>   O'Halloran was unable to pinpoint which blows came first or
whether they were caused by rocks, boots or a marijuana pipe found at
the scene. However, he said, autopsy results suggest the kidney wound
occurred some time after the head injuries and possibly during a
separate assault.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony is scheduled to resume Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>OCTA Bus Drivers Seek Vote to Oust Teamsters</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saying they are unhappy about their wages and union representation,
bus drivers from the Orange County Transportation Authority on Monday
stepped up their demand for an election to replace the Teamsters with
a more transit-oriented union.</LD>
<LD>   After a two-month petition drive, Teamsters opponents said they
have at least 330 signatures from OCTA's 1,100 drivers--more than the
number required to call an election if the state determines the names
are valid.</LD>
<LD>   "We want a transit union, not a trucking union," said Curtis
Gamble, an OCTA coach operator who is coordinating the effort to oust
Teamsters Local 952. "They don't really understand the issues bus
drivers have to deal with."</LD>
<TE>   Many OCTA bus drivers, Gamble said, are concerned that their pay
is low compared with other drivers' around the state and that transit
workers are underrepresented in the Teamsters' hierarchy.</TE>
<TE>   Top pay for OCTA drivers is about $19 an hour; operators in Los
Angeles County make $22.50 an hour. The local union's seven-member
executive board, Gamble said, has only one bus driver.</TE>
<TE>   The dissident group plans to file the petition Jan. 1 with the
Mediation and Conciliation Service within the state Department of
Industrial Relations. Agency officials will determine whether 30% of
OCTA's drivers signed the petition, the amount needed for an
election. A vote could be held as early as Jan. 10, Gamble said.</TE>
<TE>   Teamsters Local 952 has represented OCTA's drivers for more than a
decade. Any new union would take over after the authority's current
labor contract expires April 30, 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Kelly, secretary treasurer of Local 952, said there is a
dissident faction within OCTA that would like to have the United
Transportation Union take over. United Transportation used to
represent the drivers, but was replaced by the Teamsters in a close
union election in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   United Transportation, which represents transit and rail workers
across the country, has not decided whether it would represent OCTA's
drivers if the Teamsters are voted out. United Transportation has
asked Gamble to stop mentioning the union in literature his group is
using for its campaign, and Gamble said he has complied.</TE>
<TE>   There are two other national labor organizations for transit
workers--the Amalgamated Transit Union and the Transport Workers
Union. But Gamble said they are unlikely candidates for OCTA's
drivers because they are members of the AFL-CIO and cannot represent
workers until a year after a union is voted out.</TE>

<HD>Consultant to Oversee Film Permit Agency</HD>
<DH>Accountability: The organization's finances are under
scrutiny. Former L.A. city administrator will recommend an auditor
and develop fiscal policies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TED ROHRLICH and ANITA M. BUSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>City and county elected officials responsible for overseeing the
Entertainment Industry Development Corp. admitted Monday that they
have done a poor job overseeing Los Angeles' film-permitting service
and voted to hire a consultant to help.</LD>
<LD>   The consultant, former Los Angeles city Chief Administrative
Officer Keith Comrie, will be asked to study the 7-year-old
experiment in privatization and recommend changes to improve its
financial accountability to public officials who make up a majority
of its executive committee.</LD>
<LD>   County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, a member of the executive
committee, introduced the proposal, which also banned the
organization's controversial practice of making political
contributions. Yaroslavsky made the motion at an emergency meeting of
the executive committee "to begin to rehabilitate the credibility of
this organization."</LD>
<TE>   EIDC President Cody Cluff and his organization have been under a
cloud for more than three weeks since the district attorney's office,
saying it was unable to get the EIDC to turn over financial documents
voluntarily for an audit, obtained a search warrant and raided both
the organization's office and Cluff's house. An affidavit that
prosecutors used to obtain permission for the search alleged that
Cluff had used hundreds of thousands of dollars in public funds for
political contributions and lavish spending.</TE>
<TE>   Cluff maintains that he has done nothing wrong because he believes
the EIDC is a private organization and his job requires him to court
Hollywood executives to persuade them to keep filming in Los Angeles.
The EIDC is largely funded by fees it charges film and television
production companies to help them get government filming permits.</TE>
<TE>   City, state and county lawyers have had conflicting opinions about
whether the EIDC is a public agency in disguise. The distinction is
critical in deciding whether or not the political contributions were
a misuse of public funds, an issue which the district attorney's
office is investigating.</TE>
<TE>   Comrie's job will be to recommend an auditor to do a forensic
breakdown of the EIDC's $5-million budget, recommend changes to
bylaws and operating procedures, develop fiscal policies and work
with lawyers to resolve the organization's public or private status.</TE>
<TE>   Comrie, who retired as the city's chief budget officer in 1999,
endorsed the idea of merging separate city and county film permit
agencies into the EIDC in 1995. In 1998, he backed the idea of
extending its contract with the city and county for 10 years. He said
at that time the EIDC was doing a good job. It was not immediately
decided how much Comrie would be paid for his consulting work.</TE>
<TE>   Comrie's past association with the organization drew catcalls from
some agency critics, who called it a potential conflict of interest.
Yaroslavsky lauded Comrie as someone of the highest integrity.</TE>
<TE>   Donna Wells, in-house legal counsel for the EIDC, defended the
corporation's political contributions, saying that all staff members
were encouraged to become involved in their communities and recommend
which candidates and causes should receive donations from the EIDC.
Final decisions were made by Cluff.</TE>
<TE>   The EIDC stopped donating to political candidates in mid-2001 but
continued giving to initiatives, including $10,000 to a city bond
measure to build more police and fire stations and $25,000 to Mayor
James K. Hahn's anti-secession campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Wells also defended Cluff's spending practices. The district
attorney's office has said that Cluff received $300,000 in
reimbursements in one year for expenses. Wells said that Cluff paid
for office expenses such as furniture, equipment, promotional efforts
and travel on his personal credit cards. She said they were
"reasonable and appropriate amounts that are absolutely essential" to
the EIDC.</TE>
<TE>   During the meeting, Yaroslavsky and other elected officials
acknowledged that they had little familiarity with how the entity
operated.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my first meeting," said board member and Supervisor
Gloria Molina, who said her staff members had sat in for her in the
past.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilwoman Wendy Greuel said she did not have a copy of the
organization's bylaws.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky said he did not have a copy of its budget. "Is there
an approved budget?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Cluff answered that "the budget is approved annually at the board
meeting" and sent to all executive committee members.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky's motion was quickly and unanimously embraced by the
executive committee as, in Yaroslavsky's words, "a great solution for
us."</TE>
<TE>   The EIDC board consists of all 15 Los Angeles City Council
representatives, all five county supervisors and film industry and
labor representatives. Some of the elected officials on the board
received political contributions.</TE>
<TE>   The board meets once or twice a year. But the executive committee
is supposed to be more hands-on. In 2000 and 2001, executive
committee meetings were canceled three times for lack of quorums.
Three meetings were held. On Monday, executive committee members said
they intended to conduct a performance review of Cluff but ran out of
time. The executive board will now meet every two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky's motion requires more frequent meetings, executive
committee approval of raises and co-signing of checks of more than
$1,000 by an in-house lawyer of the chairman of the executive
committee. The donation to the anti-secession movement, which has
since been returned to the EIDC, has drawn the wrath of Valley and
Hollywood secession activists. At Monday's meeting, Hollywood
secession activists said that all board members who had received
donations should recuse themselves from deliberations about the
EIDC's future.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Jimenez of the Hollywood Independence Committee told the
executive committee that the EIDC's spending money "against
grass-roots ballot measures is not only questionable but really
morally wrong." She called it "Filmgate."</TE>

<HD>Science Grant Is Awarded to UCI</HD>
<DH>Education: National foundation gives $14.2-million to
develop teachers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UC Irvine announced Monday that it has been awarded a $14.2-million
grant from the National Science Foundation to develop teachers in
those disciplines for preschool through 12th-grade classes.</LD>
<LD>   "What this does," said Juan Francisco Lara, the university's
assistant vice chancellor and director of its Center for Educational
Partnerships, "is define UCI as the preeminent leader in math and
science education in California. This is where the epicenter is. It's
revolutionary, and I'm just so excited."</LD>
<LD>   Under the terms of the grant, the university will provide
after-school and Saturday development classes for math and science
teachers serving three Southern California school districts: Compton,
Newport-Mesa (westside Costa Mesa schools) and Santa Ana.</LD>
<TE>   Among the estimated 100,000 students in those districts,
university officials said, are a large number who are poor or not
fluent in English.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to training teachers, Lara said, the university will
direct an "aggressive outreach" to encourage some of its 22,600
undergraduate students to consider careers as science and math
teachers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a national problem," he said, "and the problem is that, in
general, instruction in math and science at the secondary level is
uneven across the state. Most universities [in discussing outreach]
are talking about students already enrolled in their graduate
schools. I'm talking about freshmen and sophomores and juniors. With
a serious, aggressive outreach effort, we could probably come up with
10% of the student body who would say 'Sure, I'll consider it.' "</TE>
<TE>   The grant--to be disbursed over the next five years--is the second
largest in the university's history and the largest from the science
foundation, said Tom Vasich, a UC Irvine spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   This is by far the most exciting educational outreach program that
the university has ever taken part in," he said. "It really enters us
into something much more far-reaching than what we've done in the
past."</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine was one of seven educational institutions
nationwide--and the only one in California--to be awarded the science
foundation grants.</TE>
<TE>   The others are the University of North Carolina; University of
Texas, El Paso; Baltimore County Public Schools; University of
Wisconsin, Madison; University of Kentucky and Rutgers University in
New Jersey.</TE>

<HD>Remains Found at Hellman Site</HD>
<DH>Archeology: State Coastal Commission orders a halt to
grading for houses after Native American graves are unearthed in Seal
Beach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State officials have halted construction of a gated community in Seal
Beach after the discovery of the remains of at least 18 Native
Americans on land a local tribe considers a sacred burial ground.</LD>
<LD>   The cease-and-desist order by the California Coastal Commission is
the latest twist in the 21-year history of the Hellman Ranch, a
196-acre property between the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station and
the San Gabriel River that has been so controversial that local
leaders once received death threats over plans to develop there.</LD>
<LD>   While Native American activists picketed the Heron Pointe project
Monday afternoon, a representative of developer John Laing Homes said
the company had reached an agreement with official representatives of
the Tongva people to conduct extensive archeological testing on the
site.</LD>
<TE>   "John Laing Homes is sensitive to the privacy of Native American
descendants, and any recovery of remains we are managing with the
dignity and respect they deserve," said Joanie Madrid, Heron Pointe
project manager.</TE>
<TE>   The commission issued the stop-work order last month, halting the
grading of pads for 70 single-family homes on 18 acres of the ranch.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Douglas, the commission's executive director, said the
agency's staff asked the developer to halt work once the remains were
found.</TE>
<TE>   "The concern is that the cultural values here be respected, and
that the remains that were found be respected and dealt with in a
manner that is consistent with the Native Americans' desires," he
said. "It was a very significant site from our perspective."</TE>
<TE>   Douglas said he issued the order only after the developer refused
to halt work voluntarily.</TE>
<TE>   Madrid disagreed, saying the grading was stopped Sept. 14--two
days before the order was issued.</TE>
<TE>   Commission staff members are scheduled to meet today with the
developer and Native American groups in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas said he is not interested in penalizing Laing Homes, only
in making sure that the remains are handled properly.</TE>
<TE>   The agency issued final approval for the project late last year,
allowing development near the San Gabriel River and requiring 150
acres to be sold eventually for conservation and wetlands
restoration.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, the commission had added special conditions to the
development permit after a tribal elder testified about the
importance of the site, which may have been a burial ground.</TE>
<TE>   Allowing Native American monitors and an archeologist to oversee
excavation work and grading, and temporarily halting work after
significant finds occur, were among the requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Madrid said the developer has reached an agreement with the
monitors, and the "most likely descendant" of the local tribe, who is
assigned by the Native American Heritage Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The developer will excavate more than 100 test sites. Finding
bones or artifacts will lead to additional digs.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal is to find anything that is in the ground," Madrid said.
"We've been working very closely with Native Americans all along."</TE>
<TE>   But one Native American monitor said there is no agreement on what
to do with the remains, and other issues are also unresolved.</TE>
<TE>   Remains now are being stored and will eventually be reinterred.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan David, who said 20 sets of remains have been unearthed and
expects more to be found, disputed the developer's assertion that it
has worked with the Native American community.</TE>
<TE>   David said that at one point, he and another monitor had to stand
between a burial site and bulldozers to stop it from being destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   "My job is to ensure the safety of the ancestors and artifacts out
there," he said. "Beyond that, it's my duty as a Native American to
stop somebody from desecrating a spiritual area, specifically a
burial site."</TE>
<TE>   Madrid, however, said no confrontation occurred and that the story
was being spread by a monitor who opposes any development. "That
never happened," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas said Monday that one of the reasons he issued the
cease-and-desist order was to avoid confrontation.</TE>
<TE>   A handful of activists continued picketing the site Monday
evening, carrying signs reading "Save Hellman Ranch," "Save the
Wetlands" and "Save the Native Burials." Passing drivers honked their
support.</TE>
<TE>   Andy "Young Plow" Morales said he would like to see all
development stopped.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to preserve the land, to protect the land and to
protect the buried ancestors," said Morales, the son of the chief of
the Gabrielino-Tongva Nation. "Our ancestors have been dug up and
disturbed.... How would [the developer] like it if Native American
people go to their ancestral land, dig up their ancestors and put
them in boxes or museums or throw them away in the trash and abuse
them?"</TE>
<TE>   The ranch, which had been in the Hellman family since the 1880s,
was the subject of many development plans over the years. The latest
project is much smaller than earlier proposals that called for as
many as 1,000 multiple- and single-family homes.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, several proponents of development--including then-Seal
Beach Mayor Gwen Forsythe--said they had received bullets in the
mail, prompting an FBI investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Similar mailings were made to officials tied to Bolsa Chica and
Newport Beach projects; all parcels were thought to contain Native
American remains. No arrests were ever made.</TE>

<HD>Mold May Force Razing of Planned High School Site</HD>
<DH>L.A. Unified: Though cleaned up, the Sun Valley DWP
structure the district is buying may have a recurring problem. Final
decision awaits further study.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles Department of Water and Power building in Sun Valley
that was due to be sold and converted into a sorely needed high
school next year may have to be knocked down because of toxic mold,
school district officials said.</LD>
<LD>   To ease overcrowding in the east San Fernando Valley, the Los
Angeles Unified School District announced plans two years ago to buy
the Anthony Office Building from the city for $50 million and open it
as a high school by last summer.</LD>
<LD>   When mold was discovered in February, the district changed the
opening date to July 2003. Now officials fear that the mold is a
chronic problem that can be eradicated only by razing the building,
which would delay the opening of a new school by several years.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a real travesty," said Los Angeles Board of Education
member Julie Korenstein, who favors tearing down the building. The
project "just seems to get worse, worse and worse."</TE>
<TE>   Although medical studies are disputed, mold has been blamed for
severe allergies, migraines and respiratory problems. It has also
become an emotional and expensive issue for many school districts.</TE>
<TE>   At L.A. Unified's controversial Belmont Learning Complex, a review
on the growth of possibly toxic mold is underway, with the results
due soon, said Jim McConnell, the district's chief facilities
executive.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike at Belmont, where $175 million has been spent on
construction and the capping of hazardous gas, the district made a
$500,000 refundable deposit a year ago on the Anthony Office Building
and now has six months to close escrow.</TE>
<TE>   If it completes the transaction, the district would have to
mitigate mold problems as they arise or level the structure and start
from scratch.</TE>
<TE>   A final decision will be made pending the findings of an
environmental study of the building being conducted by the DWP.</TE>
<TE>   "Our main concern is the safety of the kids and the public's
confidence in us," said Roderick Hamilton, senior facilities
executive for L.A. Unified, explaining that the district decided
several months ago that it could not meet the July 2003 deadline
after the DWP said the mold could return.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the school district's concerns, DWP officials say the mold
was cleaned up earlier this year and its 700 employees who work in
the customer phone services and billing branches housed in the
structure have nothing to fear.</TE>
<TE>   The four-story building's air quality, which is tested every other
week, has been deemed safe for now, said Hal Lindsey, DWP director of
corporate safety.</TE>
<TE>   City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo filed a $20-million lawsuit in July
against the building's contractors, blaming the mold on shoddy
workmanship. The lawsuit alleges that water was trapped inside the
building's walls because of design and material defects. The suit
also contends that 20 office workers have complained of respiratory
problems.</TE>
<TE>   In a prepared statement, officials for McCarthy Building Cos.--the
lawsuit's chief defendant and the building's primary contractor--said
they "strongly contest" the city attorney's allegations. "We are
confident we will be proven correct in our position," said Mike
Lenzen, corporate communications director for the St. Louis-based
company.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed school would have enrolled 800 to 1,200 students to
help relieve Francis Polytechnic High, across the street from the
Anthony Office Building on Arleta Avenue. Francis Poly has 3,600
students on a campus built for 3,000.</TE>
<TE>   The new high school would have been the first in the Valley since
1971 and the first of 23 planned in the district for completion by
2007.</TE>
<TE>   Some have criticized the speed with which the City Council
approved the proposed sale of the building to L.A. Unified two years
ago. The school district was under pressure to go forward quickly to
get the school opened by July 2002, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Ruth Galanter had no knowledge of the mold when she
resisted the potential sale of the building two years ago but had
reservations about the how much research was done about the site's
financial value, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone was anxious for a good headline," said Galanter, whose
new district includes the Anthony Office Building. In hindsight, she
said, nobody should buy a building with mold.</TE>
<TE>   School board member Korenstein said the deal was done quickly to
help two groups with desperate needs: The DWP wanted the money and
L.A. Unified wanted the space. The board, however, "needed a great
deal of investigation on the property," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the delays are a major setback, Board of Education
President Caprice Young said the district must impose safeguards to
prevent another situation like the Belmont Learning Complex.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason we don't own [the Anthony Office Building] yet is
because the environmental [study] is being done cautiously," Young
said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis has signed a bill that exempts the Orange County
Sanitation District from fines as long as it acts in good faith to
upgrade sewage treatment by 2013.</LD>
<LD>   The district holds a federal waiver from the Clean Water Act that
allows it to discharge dirtier sewage than nearly all other sewage
plants in the nation. Earlier this year, the district's board of
directors voted not to seek renewal of the waiver, which expires next
year, and to instead upgrade to full secondary treatment.</LD>
<LD>   Because of recent changes in state law, the district would have
faced mandatory minimum fines of $3,000 a day for noncompliance since
it technically would not have a waiver in place yet needs 11 years to
complete the upgrade.</LD>
<TE>   The bill holds those state fines in abeyance as long as the
district implements the higher-grade treatment by 2013.</TE>

<HD>Agnes Ann Green, 90; Science Teacher Pushed for Women in
Chemistry</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Agnes Ann Green, 90, who advocated for the advancement of women in
chemistry during a long career as a science educator at Immaculate
Heart College and other area institutions, died Thursday of lung
cancer at her home in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Sister Agnes Ann was a member of the Immaculate Heart community
for 70 years. She taught chemistry at the college from 1942 to 1978,
and was a visiting professor for many years at other schools,
including Loyola Marymount University, Occidental College, Whittier
College and Cal Poly Pomona.</LD>
<LD>   In 1972, she became the first female chairman of the Southern
California section of the American Chemical Society. She formed a
committee of female chemists to examine the status of women in the
field and to press for equal employment opportunities.</LD>
<TE>   To draw attention to the inequities, she often cited statistics
showing that in 1970 women made up only 2% to 3% of the chemistry
faculties at U.S. universities, but held almost 23% of the master's
degrees and 8% of the doctorates granted that year.</TE>
<TE>   She also noted that many companies only hired female chemists for
their lower-paying jobs. "We don't send our graduates to them," she
told The Times in 1972, when she chaired Immaculate Heart's chemistry
department.</TE>
<TE>   Green was born in Alvin, Ill., and moved to San Bernardino with
her family in 1926 when she was in high school. After graduating from
Immaculate Heart College in Hollywood, she earned a master's degree
at USC and a doctorate at Stanford University.</TE>
<TE>   She was a founding member of the California Assn. of Chemistry
Teachers and served as its president. She joined the American
Chemical Society in 1942. In 1988, the society honored her with its
first Agnes Ann Green Distinguished Service Award for her
contributions to the field.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Leroy F. Greene, 84, who served 36 years in the California
Legislature before his retirement in 1998, died Sunday of peritonitis
at Mercy General Hospital in Sacramento.</LD>
<LD>   Greene, who was born in Newark, N.J., earned an engineering degree
at Purdue University and went to work for the state of Indiana
building bridges. After a stint with the Tennessee Valley Authority,
he went overseas in the Army Corps of Engineers.</LD>
<LD>   He moved to California in 1949 to work with the state Division of
Architecture in Sacramento, and three years later formed his own
company, Leroy Greene and Associates Consulting Engineers.</LD>
<TE>   Greene, who represented much of Sacramento, was first elected to
the Assembly in 1962 and to the Senate in 1982. He was best known
statewide for chairing the Assembly and Senate Education committees
and the state allocation board that dispenses school construction
funds. As an engineer and staunch advocate of public education,
Greene championed hundreds of bills requiring seismically sound
school construction and promoting educational issues.</TE>
<TE>   Other bills he introduced covered a wide range--measures
prohibiting the sale of previously frozen meat as "fresh"; requiring
public service buildings to be fire- and earthquake-resistant; and
legalizing bingo and prostitution.</TE>
<TE>   Blunt and often entertaining, Greene once proposed printing a
legislator's speech upside down so that then-Gov. Jerry Brown could
read it while meditating and standing on his head.</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert P. Lieb, 88, a veteran character actor on Broadway, television
and film, died Saturday in Los Angeles of complications from
intestinal surgery earlier this year.</LD>
<LD>   Lieb, who was a native of Pelham, N.Y., attended New York
University before becoming an actor. He made his quiet debut on
Broadway, he often joked, as a body falling out of a closet in the
1940s hit "Mr. and Mrs. North."</LD>
<LD>   Roles followed in the original casts of "Two Blind Mice" and
"Inherit the Wind."</LD>
<TE>   Lieb appeared in numerous television shows, most notably in his
long-running role as employer George Baxter's brother-in-law, Harry
Thompson, in the series centered on the Baxters' maid "Hazel."</TE>
<TE>   Lieb was also remembered for his role as the arresting Officer
Flaherty in the often-repeated "Twilight Zone" episode "The Night of
the Meek." The Christmastime show featured Art Carney as a department
store Santa, who, after being fired for drinking, discovers he is the
real Santa Claus. Lieb's daughter, Bon Appetit magazine editor
Barbara Fairchild, invited friends and colleagues to watch annual
December reruns on the Sci-Fi Channel.</TE>
<TE>   On the large screen, Lieb appeared as the seedy attorney for John
Huston's character in "Myra Breckinridge" (1970), and had small roles
in such films as "Angel in My Pocket" (1969), "How to Frame a Figg"
(1971) and "Mystery Men" (1999).</TE>
<TE>   In addition to appearing on several television series, including
"Alf" in the 1980s, he had parts in such TV movies as "Dangerous
Heart" (1994).</TE>

<HD>Accused Priest Waives Extradition</HD>
<DH>Church: Pulled off a cruise ship by Alaskan officials, he

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles priest charged with molesting seven girls who was
plucked off a cruise ship headed for Russia has waived extradition,
Alaska court officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   G. Neville Rucker, a retired priest, will be returned to Los
Angeles as soon as bad weather clears in the Aleutian Islands and he
can be flown 800 miles to Anchorage, where he will be met by Los
Angeles police detectives, said Greg Wilkinson, an Alaska state
trooper.</LD>
<LD>   During a hearing in the Unalaska District Court, Rucker waived his
right to an extradition hearing and told the judge his attorney
advised him to return to California. Bail was set at $1 million.</LD>
<TE>   Rucker was one of seven priests removed by Cardinal Roger M.
Mahony from the ministry earlier this year when he implemented a
zero-tolerance policy for those who previously abused minors.</TE>
<TE>   One of those priests, Michael Wempe, was sued Monday by a
39-year-old former altar boy. Richard Kirby of Leesburg, Va., alleges
that Wempe, a retired priest, molested him between 1975 and 1977
while serving at St. Jude Church in Westlake Village. Two others have
sued Wempe.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators are probing at least
four allegations of sexual abuse against Wempe.</TE>
<TE>   Rucker, 82, was arrested Friday by Alaska state troopers aboard
the cruise ship ms Volendam after the U.S. Coast Guard, at the
request of the LAPD, ordered an unscheduled stop in the remote port
of Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The ship was on a 64-day Pacific Circle cruise that began Sept. 23
in Vancouver, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   "We pulled him off the ship and put him on a tugboat in heavy
seas. We had him harnessed and surrounded so he had no opportunity
... to fall overboard or jump overboard," Trooper Kim Babcock said.</TE>
<TE>   Rucker is charged with 23 counts of lewd conduct with a child.
Prosecutors allege he molested seven girls--all under 14--between
1947 and 1976.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference outside the Los Angeles County Courthouse on
Monday, Kirby said he was not only humiliated by the abuse he
suffered decades ago, but again after he wrote an opinion piece with
Mahony in The Times that advocated an "open and accountable"
relationship between the church and victims.</TE>
<TE>   "Since July, I have been depressed and disappointed by the
cardinal's deceptions and my role in telling people the church was
changing. I feel the same as when I was abused 25 years ago," Kirby
said.</TE>
<TE>   Kirby said he felt misled by Mahony's pledge to help victims of
sexual abuse by priests.</TE>
<TE>   His attorney, Jeffrey Anderson of St. Paul, Minn., has asked a Los
Angeles County Superior Court judge to stop church officials from
collecting data from sexual abuse victims for use in their defense
against future litigation. The lawsuit also names Mahony and the
archdiocese, and alleges they conspired to conceal information about
Wempe, then used Kirby as part of their public relations campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney J. Michael Hennigan, who represents the archdiocese,
called Kirby's request for an independent court official to collect
data on abuse "preposterous" and "a publicity stunt."</TE>
<TE>   He said the archdiocese takes histories from only those victims
demanding money to settle out-of-court claims. He said Kirby asked
for $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   "I think our relationship with him soured after that," Hennigan
said. "We're struggling to deal with staffing issues, and he wants $2
million."</TE>

<KH>BEHIND THE WHEEL</KH>
<HD>Big Rig Drivers on the Hook for Dings, Dents</HD>
<DH>If your car is peppered with tiny rocks flying out of a
gravel truck, the law is on your side. Just call (800) TELL-CHP.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Snap. Pop. Bang.</LD>
<LD>   You are speeding down the freeway behind a hulking, gravel-hauling
big rig and you hear these sounds. They are the sounds of your paint
job and windshield being buffeted by tiny rocks hurled from the back
of that truck.</LD>
<LD>   In a matter of seconds, your pride and joy--the fuel-injected baby
you lovingly wash, wax and shine--has a complexion like the surface
of the moon.</LD>
<TE>   This is a fairly common problem. Paint chips and dents caused by
flying rocks are responsible for about 5% of California's $3-billion
auto body repair industry, according to experts.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Yoo of Los Angeles has a brand new Audi, and there is
nothing he hates more than having some 18-wheeled behemoth spraying
his car with gravel. He wrote to Behind the Wheel, wondering if he
has any recourse.</TE>
<TE>   Question: "Shouldn't they be held liable for damage to vehicles
following behind?"</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Not only are truckers who let their load spill on other
motorists liable for your damage, but they can face fines if they are
caught in the act by police.</TE>
<TE>   A 1990 state law requires trucks carrying gravel, sand and other
loose materials to cover their loads to protect other motorists.</TE>
<TE>   If your car is being assaulted by one of these gravel-laden
trucks, call (800) TELL-CHP (835-5247) and report the culprit. Your
insurance can pay for your damage or you can try to identify the
owner of the truck and file a claim.</TE>
<TE>   Your chances of getting reimbursed are much better if you jot down
the license plate of the truck and the time and place your car came
under attack.</TE>
<TE>   A California Highway Patrol spokeswoman, Anne DaVigo, recommends,
if the rocks flying from a truck are the size of cantaloupes and
threaten to kill someone, that you dial 911 and report it.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic in Southern California is bad enough. We shouldn't have to
add killer boulders to our commuting worries.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of debris on the freeways, J. Giorgini of Los Angeles
wrote to say that he has solved one of the greatest Southern
California mysteries: Who is producing all that garbage that litters
the side of our freeways?</TE>
<TE>   He said he was driving behind a garbage truck and looked up to see
a hail of debris blowing from the top of the truck, sprinkling
drivers and the freeway with cups, fast-food containers and those
ubiquitous plastic grocery bags.</TE>
<TE>   Giorgini suggests that the waste management industry is helping to
keep itself in business by distributing a good chunk of its inventory
on the way to the landfills.</TE>
<TE>   Q: "Am I the only person who has made such observations?"</TE>
<TE>   A: It is probably a pretty common occurrence but if you ask folks
in the waste management industry to comment on this, they act as if
you are reporting a UFO sighting.</TE>
<TE>   Arnie Berghoff, a spokesman for Browning Ferris Industries, which
operates the Sunshine Canyon Landfill in Granada Hills, said the laws
of physics prevent a garbage truck from spewing debris on the
freeway.</TE>
<TE>   He said the trucks that collect garbage from your home compact the
refuse with a hydraulic arm and then pack it into a sealed metal
container in the back of the truck before getting on a freeway. Many
of these garbage trucks then haul their loads to transfer centers,
where the trash is loaded into 18-wheel big rigs and taken to distant
landfills. These rigs, like gravel-hauling trucks, are required by
law to cover their loads, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But isn't it possible that some errant trash could blow out of
these trucks? "It's possible but highly unlikely," Berghoff said. Ah,
that's exactly what the government keeps saying about UFO sightings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Continuing on the theme of garbage on the freeways, Rod La Rocque
of La Habra wrote to ask why he often sees Caltrans sweepers
operating on the freeways at mid-morning and early-afternoon hours.
He noted that most cities in Southern California schedule their
sweepers to clean city streets before dawn to avoid creating a
traffic problem.</TE>
<TE>   Q: "Why can't Caltrans do the same with the freeways?"</TE>
<TE>   A: According to officials at the California Department of
Transportation, routine freeway sweeping is scheduled only for
off-peak hours. (Caltrans defines off-peak hours as 9:30 a.m. to 2:30
p.m. and after 6:30 p.m.)</TE>
<TE>   The exception to this rule is when sweepers are called to clean up
after a messy traffic accident.</TE>
<TE>   But a Caltrans spokeswoman, Deborah Harris, said the agency tries
to make sure the sweepers are not adding to our worsening traffic
congestion. "If a sweeping operation is causing a backup of 15
minutes or more, then the operation is suspended," she said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Edward Elson of Anaheim wrote to say that he has a big problem
with the flower plaques installed on the sound walls near the
junction of the Garden Grove and San Diego freeways around Garden
Grove. To be blunt, Elson thinks the plaques are ugly. What's more,
he wonders if Caltrans is creating a hazard by decorating sound walls
with designs that could distract motorists.</TE>
<TE>   Q: "The 85% of drivers who are alone in their vehicles cannot look
at them without taking their eyes off the road ahead. So what purpose
are they intended to serve in the first place?"</TE>
<TE>   A: The flower plaques you see along the freeway are part of a
larger Caltrans effort to build and design sound walls with a bit
more aesthetic appeal. Caltrans officials don't think the flower
plaques or any of the sound wall designs will distract anybody.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Caltrans is simply thinking ahead to 2025, when freeway
speeds are expected to drop to 20 mph and motorists will have nothing
better to do but gaze at the decorative barriers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally, demonstrating that it often takes a bit of ingenuity
to drive in Southern California, Troy Mitchell of Granada Hills wrote
to explain how he resolved an annoying problem that plagues motorists
who drive clean-air vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   State law allows solo drivers in nonpolluting vehicles such as
electric- and natural gas-powered cars to use the carpool lanes. But
the law is not common knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell wrote: "I get yelled at, cursed out and flipped off every
day by fellow commuters who think I'm breaking the law."</TE>
<TE>   "My solution to this road rage is a cheesy blow-up doll. She sits
next to me in the passenger seat. Now people think I'm crazy but they
are not angry anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Only in L.A.</TE>

<HD>Health Secretary Tackles the Growing Shortage of Nurses</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Thompson will seek extra education funds. He also
touts new rapid response team.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY TRICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson said Monday
that he is asking Congress for additional money for nursing
education, and he pledged to put his energy behind funding that the
American Nurses Assn. says it needs to inject the profession with new
blood.</LD>
<LD>   Thompson also announced the creation of the National Nurses
Response Team, a nationwide mobilization similar in concept to the
National Guard, to respond to bioterrorism or disease outbreaks.</LD>
<LD>   "In the coming years, projections are that there simply won't be
enough [nurses] to meet the vital health needs of our citizens," he
said at a news conference. "If those numbers continue, we're going to
be faced with a potentially dangerous shortage of nurses within the
next two decades."</LD>
<TE>   The response team program will compile a list of specially trained
volunteer nurses willing to be deployed for two weeks to respond to a
shortage of health-care professionals. The team could be used for
mass vaccinations in the event of a bioterrorism attack, or to treat
injuries at natural disasters.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara A. Blakeney, president of the nurses association, which
represents the nation's 2.6 million registered nurses, said that 900
nurses have volunteered, and that 2,000 are expected once word
spreads. The volunteers will be trained, compensated for their time
and will be able to resume their jobs once deployment ends.</TE>
<TE>   But to be a success, more nurses are needed, Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   His pledge to help find more funding for nursing education comes
as his department, in a report released in July, estimates that the
number of nurses nationwide is lagging behind the need. By 2005, for
example, California is predicted to have 162,645 registered nurses,
but it will need 181,054--a shortage of 10%. By 2020, if the trend
continues, California will need 263,673 registered nurses, but will
have only 55% of the need filled--142,978 nurses.</TE>
<TE>   One place the shortage is being felt is at UCLA Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   "The difficulty we're facing in California is not having enough
nursing schools, the lack of four-year and two-year programs," said
Heidi Crooks, its senior associate director of operations and patient
care. "It's not a lack of interest."</TE>
<TE>   Having more faculty and resources for training is dependent on the
number of nurses attending postgraduate programs, which is directly
tied to the number of students enrolling in nursing programs,
Blakeney said.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson and the nurses group have a California ally in Congress
in their effort to increase the number of registered nurses. Rep.
Lois Capps (D-Santa Barbara) played a key role in passing the Nursing
Reinvestment Act, which President Bush signed in August.</TE>
<TE>   The act, for which appropriations have not yet been provided,
expands programs to help nursing students repay loans and creates
additional scholarships. In exchange, graduates are required to work
in nursing for four years. It also provides loan repayment for nurses
with advance degrees who agree to teach in nursing schools.</TE>
<TE>   Blakeney and Thompson said Monday that funding the act, which
carries a $250-million price tag, is key to recruiting and retaining
nursing students, and therefore is critical to the nation's health.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson also asked Congress to increase funding for nursing
education from $93 million to $100 million for the coming fiscal
year.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in seven years, college nursing programs have
seen enrollment increase, said Kathleen Ann Long, president of the
American Assn. of Colleges of Nursing and dean of the University of
Florida's College of Nursing.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been lots of publicity given to the nursing shortage,
and employing agencies are letting students know there is more
interest and a better working environment," she said.</TE>

<CX>   Nursing -- An Oct. 1 story in Section A on the growing nursing
shortage said the American Nursing Assn. represents the nation's 2.6
million nurses. Although the association does claim to represent the
interests of the nation's registered nurses, the organization has a
membership of 180,000.</CX>

<HD>Webber Needs a Timeout Now</HD>

<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Chris Webber barely paid attention to the weekend scene at the
Standard hotel's rooftop bar in downtown Los Angeles. Dancers grooved
to the DJ's beats, people sipped expensive drinks and swimmers
wearing minimal-to-no clothing frolicked in the pool.</LD>
<LD>   We were talking ball.</LD>
<LD>   Webber, in town last week to film a shoe commercial, thinks the
Sacramento Kings' signing of Keon Clark was the best off-season move
in the NBA this summer. He says Mike Bibby is a rock-solid 200 pounds
and ready for some fierce ballin'. He predicts Hedo Turkoglu will
blow up this season.</LD>
<TE>   But if you think that franchise and its star player can forget the
excruciating loss to the Lakers in Game 7 of the Western Conference
finals, think again.</TE>
<TE>   "Dog, it hurt worse than The Timeout," Webber said.</TE>
<TE>   He continued, talking about how he cried in the locker room
afterward, but I couldn't get past that first statement.</TE>
<TE>   Worse than The Timeout?</TE>
<TE>   That's saying something. You remember The Timeout. The 1993 NCAA
championship game, the Superdome, Michigan vs. North Carolina,
Webber's Wolverines down by two points with 11 seconds left. Webber
had the ball, then called a timeout the team didn't have. In the
books it's recorded as: Technical foul--Michigan bench. In sports
lore it's one of the biggest blunders ever, worthy of its own capital
letters</TE>
<TE>   It's defined Webber ever since. That's why his whole summer, from
the bitter loss to his indictment on charges of lying to a grand
jury, has made him want to get back to Before.</TE>
<TE>   Back to the days in high school and the two-year run of the Fab
Five at Michigan. Back to when ball was fun, when they would run up
and down the court and yell at each other and dunk on guys and play
with passion.</TE>
<TE>   Back to the way he played even in the 39 minutes 49 seconds of
hoops that preceded The Timeout.</TE>
<TE>   He was, perhaps, a shot and an overtime away from being the most
outstanding player of that game. People don't remember he had 23
points, 11 rebounds and three blocked shots that night. They remember
The Timeout.</TE>
<TE>   I remember how he faced the national media and took the blame. And
that relates to his current, more serious predicament.</TE>
<TE>   Webber, his father and his aunt were charged with conspiring to
obstruct justice and lying to a federal grand jury investigating
Detroit basketball booster Ed Martin's illegal gambling operation.</TE>
<TE>   Martin said he gave Webber $280,000 while Webber was at Michigan
and in high school. Webber denies accepting that much money, and he
said he didn't lie to the grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always been a stand-up guy," Webber said.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would I lie?"</TE>
<TE>   He said he hasn't talked to Martin since he was a teenager--and
the investigation has made him think back to the good aspects of
those days.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation has reinforced my love for ball," Webber said. "The
time I was 14 years old and a 55-year-old man wearing a gold chain
and Jordans came around us kids.</TE>
<TE>   "I love basketball more, I love my life more, I love God more.
Hopefully, this is all for a reason."</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't think the charges--which carry potential jail sentences
of from two to 10 years--will affect his play, but he's sure the
constant questioning about them will get tiresome.</TE>
<TE>   He is so confident he will not be convicted that he wishes the
trial could begin earlier. (It could begin next summer, but
prosecutors are trying to move up the start date.)</TE>
<TE>   He's confident about his team's chances of dethroning the Lakers
as well. He thinks Clark gives them a weakside shot-blocker, and a
guy who can extend starting center Vlade Divac's career by a couple
of years. Webber worked out hard this summer, and said Bibby worked
out even harder. While Webber wouldn't leave the gym before he made
500 shots, Bibby wouldn't break out until he made 1,000.</TE>
<TE>   But he doesn't want his guys talking smack. Someone came up to
Webber at the Standard and told him that Bibby said the team would
win 70 games this year. Last week, co-owner Gavin Maloof said the
Kings should be "one of the greatest teams ever" and that "we believe
that last year we had the better team."</TE>
<TE>   Webber can't do anything about the owners, but he wants the
players to shut up.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't a fairy tale," he said. "This is real."</TE>
<TE>   No cone of silence for the Lakers. After pretending not to hear
questions about the Kings at media day Monday, Shaquille O'Neal
finally said, "I don't think they'll ever have what it takes" to beat
the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Webber doesn't hate the Lakers. He loves O'Neal's game. Loves Kobe
Bryant's game. Respects all of the veteran savvy utilized by Robert
Horry.</TE>
<TE>   Webber took to heart the words Horry said with a minute left in
Game 4. Webber felt confident the Kings were going to win, and let
Horry know about it.</TE>
<TE>   "I just play the game, man," Horry responded. And Horry kept
playing ... right up until the final seconds, when Divac batted a
rebound his way and Horry fired up the three-point shot that won the
game and saved the Lakers' season.</TE>
<TE>   Webber could learn a lot from Horry. Webber needs to keep playing,
right through the end.</TE>
<TE>   He passed up shots in crunch time last season. He and King Coach
Rick Adelman said he was fulfilling his role as a playmaker. But now
Webber realizes if he's going to be the franchise player with the
$122-million contract, he has to be the one to shoot the ball when
the game's on the line.</TE>
<TE>   And he needs to get past that final barrier.</TE>
<TE>   "I think when you're as great a player as he is--he's one of the
elite of the elite--to get truly validated you need to win a
championship," Steve Fisher, Webber's college coach, said on the
court in Sacramento before Game 7.</TE>
<TE>   "People continue to say, 'Well he never won one in college, he
hasn't won one in the NBA.' Well I know, because I was with him,
we're not even close to being there without him. And right here,
they're not even close to being where they are without him. And yet,
until he can put that ring on his finger, he won't be able to have
that kind of inner peace."</TE>
<TE>   The fans at the Standard didn't antagonize him. He said he gets

<DH>Rivera and fellow relief aces hold key to October success</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New York Yankees are all about October, so they rested closer
Mariano Rivera three times this season and kept their fingers
crossed.</LD>
<LD>   Rivera needed time off because of shoulder and groin injuries, and
was recently activated, the Yankees hoping to begin another long
postseason run. Now, though, the most successful reliever in playoff
history no longer has an aura of invincibility. The Arizona
Diamondbacks broke through against Rivera while winning last season's
World Series, and the seven-year veteran may be out of sync after his
lengthy layoff.</LD>
<LD>   Each playoff team has a capable closer as the best-of-five
American and National League division series begin today, inspiring
confidence in would-be pennant winners as the stakes rise with every
pitch. The Angels face the Yankees at Yankee Stadium, and Troy
Percival joins Billy Koch of the Oakland Athletics, Eddie Guardado of
the Minnesota Twins, Byung-Hyun Kim of the Diamondbacks, John Smoltz
of the Atlanta Braves, Robb Nen of the San Francisco Giants and Jason
Isringhausen of the St. Louis Cardinals on the list of closers
seeking the postseason spotlight.</LD>
<TE>   "Mariano not only has proven he's great during the season, he's
proven he's the best in the postseason," said Percival, who converted
40 of 44 save opportunities to help the Angels earn the AL wild-card
berth.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that he's stepping up his game, that is his game. I want
to go out and prove as well that my game will be the same, regardless
of the situation."</TE>
<TE>   Rivera tops the all-time list with 24 postseason saves, and the
cut-fastball specialist had a streak of 23 when he was summoned to
preserve a 2-1 lead in the eighth inning of Game 7 at Bank One
Ballpark last November. The Diamondbacks completed a dramatic two-run
rally on Luis Gonzalez's one-out, bases-loaded, broken-bat single
over a drawn-in infield in the ninth, giving them a stunning 3-2
victory and denying the Yankees their 27th Series title.</TE>
<TE>   "The Yankees are the epitome of the idea that no one guy is the
single reason for a team being a success, but they know he's a big
key for them," San Diego Padre closer Trevor Hoffman said. "Having
him back right now is obviously huge for them. It was important for
him to get the rest he needed, and I think he can bounce back."</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees' career leader with 243 saves, Rivera was 6-0 with an
0.70 earned-run average in 51 playoff appearances before that final
game against Arizona, and had not suffered a blown save since the
1997 AL division series against the Cleveland Indians. Rivera
struggled this season, though, because of his strained pitching
shoulder and strained groin, failing to record at least 30 saves for
the first time as a full-time closer. He went 1-4 with a 2.74 ERA and
28 saves in 32 opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question how good [Rivera] is--he's awesome--but it's
not like he's unbeatable," Angel center fielder Darin Erstad said.
"When he comes in, you're not like, 'Geez, here you go.' That's
really not the way it is."</TE>
<TE>   In 24 career appearances against the Angels, Rivera is 2-2 with 12
saves and a 4.75 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   Rivera was called into five playoff games in the eighth last year,
but Manager Joe Torre, concerned about the right-hander's shoulder,
said he planned to use Rivera only in the ninth this time around.
Although the rest of the bullpen bridged the gap en route to the
Yankees' fifth straight AL East title--setup man Steve Karsay was
perfect in seven save chances--Rivera remains the centerpiece of the
team's playoff plan.</TE>
<TE>   "In the six [previous] years we've been in the postseason, he's
been a main character," Torre said. "He's like a regular player for
us. If you lose your shortstop, center fielder, closer or catcher ...
that's a pretty good category to be in.</TE>
<TE>   "With Mo down there, it's still our strength. You can't win games
unless you finish them."</TE>
<TE>   Said Yankee starter Roger Clemens, "Mo's still the best at what he
does."</TE>
<TE>   Postseason games are usually low-scoring, magnifying every move
and putting more emphasis on relief pitching. Rivera has been a
security blanket for Torre, and that's the best thing a manager can
have in scary playoff moments.</TE>
<TE>   "It's huge, because if you go to the playoffs, you're going to
play some tight ballgames," said Padre Manager Bruce Bochy, whose
club won the 1998 NL pennant. "It's such a pressure situation, and
your closer is probably going to handle it better than anybody else.</TE>
<TE>   "And those last three outs are ... there's just so much intensity.
Then if you get into a one-run ballgame, the intensity seems to
heighten more on those final outs. You need to have a closer who can
get it done. For me, to have somebody like Trevor when we were there,
it gives you a great sense of security and confidence."</TE>
<TE>   And a shaky closer is a playoff team's worst nightmare.</TE>
<TE>   "Your closer can make you or break you in the playoffs," said
Dodger left fielder Brian Jordan, who played on the Braves' 1999 NL
pennant-winning club. "You saw what happened when Kim couldn't close
the door for Arizona last season. All of a sudden, it was like,
'Bam!' The Yankees knew they had a chance the next time they faced
that guy, and it was true the whole World Series."</TE>
<TE>   Arizona's submarine-style closer gave up a tying two-out, two-run
home run to Tino Martinez in the bottom of the ninth inning in Game
4, and Derek Jeter's walk-off homer in the 10th.</TE>
<TE>   In Game 5, Scott Brosius delivered a tying two-out, two-run homer
in the ninth, leading to an eventual Yankee victory and 3-2 lead in
the Series. Arizona won the title by taking the final two games, and
Manager Bob Brenly stuck with Kim, who rebounded this season with 35
saves in 41 chances.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really care what happened then," Kim said through an
interpreter, "as long as I'm confident right now."</TE>
<TE>   That's the key, managers said.</TE>
<TE>   "Kim had a rough time against the Yankees, but he's come back and
had a good year for 'em," Bochy said. "Anything can happen, but
closers are so mentally tough, they can handle it.</TE>
<TE>   "Saving a game during the year is a crisis situation too. It's a
lot of pressure for 162 games, so it shouldn't ruin your year if
things don't go right in the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Smoltz, a starter before switching to the bullpen last season,
established an NL record with 55 saves this year and is the major
leagues' all-time leader in postseason victories. Nen was with the
Florida Marlins' 1997 Series-winning team, and Isringhausen was on
Oakland's playoff clubs the previous two seasons. Percival, Koch and
Guardado are newcomers to playoff pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "The job I'm in is pressure-packed every time I go out there,"
Percival said. "I put a lot of pressure on myself, no matter the
situation, so to go out there in a playoff game, I can't see it
making any difference for me."</TE>
<TE>   We'll find out soon enough.</TE>

<KH>AMERICAN LEAGUE PLAYOFFS ANGELS VS. NEW YORK</KH>
<HD>Issue Is Underage Blinking</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Angel 'kids' are new to postseason game, but
they're confident they won't be intimidated by playoff-tested
Yankees, or hostile Yankee Stadium.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>To the young and impressionable visitor, Yankee Stadium is a haunted
house, especially in October. No one here expects the plucky little
Angels to challenge the mighty Yankees anyway, and the player whose
performance is most critical to the Angels' success sounded awfully
young and impressionable Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm going to stand out there," Jarrod Washburn said, "and I'm
going to say, 'Holy ... ! We're playing in Yankee Stadium, in
October, against Roger Clemens and the New York Yankees!' And I'll
say, 'This is pretty cool!' "</LD>
<LD>   In the next breath, Washburn insisted he could control his
emotions, and he'd better. Washburn starts tonight, against Clemens,
in the Angels' first playoff game in 16 years.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels adjusted their rotation so Washburn, their ace, would
start the series opener. No question, really. He won 18 games, most
by an Angel pitcher since 1991. He beat the Yankees this year. He
went 13-3 on the road. He gave up one home run in September.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond statistics, the Angels rave about Washburn's fearlessness.
Clemens has been so good, for so long, that he started against the
Angels in their last playoff game--in 1986, for the Boston Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Clemens has no fear, and he is not above putting a little fear
into the hearts of opposing batters by throwing fastballs high and
tight--the higher and tighter, the better.</TE>
<TE>   But this is all new to Washburn, in a stadium in which he should
not succeed, facing a lineup against which he should not succeed.
Washburn throws virtually nothing but fastballs, and the Yankees have
hit more home runs than any other playoff team, 71 more than the
Angels. With the spacious outfield here and all the fly balls likely
tonight, center fielder Darin Erstad ought to put on a prime-time
fielding clinic.</TE>
<TE>   And, at Yankee Stadium, the bleacher creatures do not just sit in
the bleachers. Tonight--yo, it's nothing personal--Washburn will be
the most hated man in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it," he said. "Even in high school, every time we went to
someone else's place, I was always the hated guy. I've always loved
it, and I have no idea why."</TE>
<TE>   Said closer Troy Percival: "It's hard to explain why he won't be
affected, but he won't be. He'll probably be out there thinking about
going hunting."</TE>
<TE>   If Washburn loses tonight, the Angels might be thinking about
going hunting as soon as next week.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Appier, who starts the second game, has lasted a total of 15
innings in his last three starts. Ramon Ortiz, who starts the third
game, hasn't lost since Aug. 9, but the Angels wouldn't take the
chance of starting him at Yankee Stadium because he is so excitable.</TE>
<TE>   "Jarrod is more calm out there," catcher Bengie Molina said. "He's
the right guy for the part. He gets pumped up, but at the right
times. Ramon, you've got to be with him all the time, telling him to
calm down."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels lodged modest objections to the local perception that
they are little more than first-round fodder for the Yankees. The
Yankees won 103 games, four more than the Angels, but the Yankees
played Tampa Bay nine more times than the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't a fluke," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said. "These
guys know they're a good team, they've shown it and they're ready to
move on. When a team wins 99 games, I don't think you can put any
other tag on it but championship caliber."</TE>
<TE>   First baseman Scott Spiezio offered a polite retort to the
Angels-are-just-happy-to-be-here conventional wisdom. "If you lose in
the playoffs," he said, "no one remembers you were there."</TE>
<TE>   Washburn remembers opening day, when he started for the Angels, on
national television. He was fired up, so much so that he figured his
adrenaline would fuel his fastball. The first five batters reached
base, and Washburn put the Angels in a 4-0 hole in the first inning.</TE>
<TE>   "I threw a little harder," he said, "and a lot straighter."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia said Washburn got a "rude awakening" that night and has
learned his lesson. Pitching coach Bud Black, who played for the
Kansas City Royals, compared Washburn's mental strength to that of
former Kansas City stars George Brett, Hal McRae and Bret Saberhagen.</TE>
<TE>   "Some guys really relish going into a hostile environment," Black
said. "He feeds off a hostile environment, where so many players
might let it affect them in a negative way.</TE>
<TE>   "His mental makeup is what sets him apart from so many other
players."</TE>
<TE>   The environment cannot get more hostile. Tonight, it's feeding
time.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>He showed up early, stepping alone into the Bronx sunlight, tiny red
shorts, high red socks, an accidental tourist.</LD>
<LD>   David Eckstein draped himself over the Yankee Stadium dugout
railing and stared.</LD>
<LD>   High above home plate, a couple of guys were carefully hanging the
aging red, white and blue bunting that seemingly has not changed
since Babe Ruth played.</LD>
<TE>   "Careful," shouted one. "This hasn't been out of the bag since
opening day!"</TE>
<TE>   Out in left field, another guy was guarding the monuments that
will shadow the Angel bullpen, Mickey Mantle over one shoulder, Joe
DiMaggio over another.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sacred in there," the guard said.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the glistening white center-field facade, an elevated train
roared past, the sound of an October crowd after a playoff home run
in the most spooky postseason spot in sports.</TE>
<TE>   Inside Eckstein's head, thoughts raced.</TE>
<TE>   "Something magical happens here," he said later.</TE>
<TE>   He paused, wrinkled his nose.</TE>
<TE>   "If we are overwhelmed by it, they are going to eat us alive."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The last time the New York Yankees played a postseason game here,
one of them hit a ninth-inning, two-run, two-out, game-tying World
Series home run.</TE>
<TE>   For the second consecutive day.</TE>
<TE>   In the stands, thousands held hands and swayed and sang, "New
York, New York" long after midnight.</TE>
<TE>   For the third time that week.</TE>
<TE>   When the Angels take the field today for the first game of their
division series, they will be battling not only a team, but a chill.</TE>
<TE>   Just as your kitchen is a different place at dinnertime, Yankee
Stadium is a different place in October.</TE>
<TE>   It's as tangible as the steam coming out of the mouths of cursing
fans.</TE>
<TE>   It's as pungent as the odors wafting from the nearby Bronx
fast-food joints.</TE>
<TE>   Yankee history fills every corner of this aging palace with photos
and plaques and wrinkled old cigar-chomping men.</TE>
<TE>   With the timing of Yogi and the toughness of Gehrig, it is a
history that awakens every fall to remind the team of who it is.</TE>
<TE>   "Have you been here? Then you know it," Yankee shortstop Derek
Jeter said. "I don't know how to explain it other than ... the game
is never over."</TE>
<TE>   During last year's World Series, the Arizona Diamondbacks' Curt
Schilling didn't believe in it, even laughed about it.</TE>
<TE>   Mystique and aura?</TE>
<TE>   He said they "sound like dancers at a nightclub."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the Yankees beat the Diamondbacks in consecutive
games here on consecutive game-tying, ninth-inning homers, a banner
was unfurled over a Yankee Stadium wall.</TE>
<TE>   "Mystique and Aura Appearing Nightly," it read.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever it is, it's real.</TE>
<TE>   "Definitely a different animal here," Yankee first baseman Jason
Giambi said. "I've been on the other side, and it's great to be on
this side."</TE>
<TE>   Since this four-championship dynasty began its run in 1996, this
chill has appeared at the oddest times, making people do the oddest
things.</TE>
<TE>   In that first year, in the league championship series, a
12-year-old boy named Jeffrey Maier lunged out of the right-field
stands to grab a ball and give Jeter a home run that inspired a
pennant.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, even though the Yankees eventually lost the Series,
they were hosts of President Bush's perfect pitch and those two
perfectly amazing comebacks.</TE>
<TE>   In between, there was that October game when two shaken San Diego
Padre relievers threw wildly enough to lose an entire World Series in
about seven minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the time Chad Curtis hit a 10th-inning home run
that essentially ended a World Series in about five seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Yankee Stadium is where Roger Clemens, jacked up beyond reason,
threw a broken bat at Mike Piazza.</TE>
<TE>   And Yankee Stadium is where, at the start of tonight's game, I
fully expect him to throw a fastball at Eckstein.</TE>
<TE>   It's the style of a pitcher who has won 19 of his last 21
decisions here.</TE>
<TE>   Said Clemens: "I'll try to break him down the best I can."</TE>
<TE>   It's the manner of a team that recklessly approaches October home
games as if playing with a stacked deck.</TE>
<TE>   "Derek Jeter was telling me the other day how this is a magical
place, and how it rubs off on everybody," outfielder Rondell White
said. "I can't wait to see."</TE>
<TE>   Neither can the Angels, although they have no idea what they will
find.</TE>
<TE>   Although they are an enviable 17-16 at Yankee Stadium since 1996,
they are acutely aware that none of those games was during the fall.</TE>
<TE>   "We know we can beat them here, but what does that mean now?" Tim
Salmon said. "I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   They are aware that, also since 1996, they have the majors'
second-best record against the Yankees at 35-34.</TE>
<TE>   Which means nothing when it's 11 p.m., and you can see your
breath, and the dugout toilet is clogged, and thousands are chanting
about your ex-wife, and Babe Ruth is on the video board, and here
comes Mariano Rivera.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been here 10 years, and right now I feel like a rookie,"
Salmon said. "It's all new to us. We have to try to figure out ways
to keep us ready to play."</TE>
<TE>   This being only a best-of-five series, they will have to do it
quickly. The Yankees are watching. The Yankees know.</TE>
<TE>   "When people come here for the first time in the postseason,
something happens," Jeter said. "They get flustered. You can see it
on people's faces."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels must prove they are not like other teams, and, to have
a chance in this series, they must prove it tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Beating Clemens in Yankee Stadium in October is like beating
Lombardi in Lambeau Field in December.</TE>
<TE>   The easy part is overcoming greatness. The real pain is scaring
away those ghosts.</TE>

<HD>Notre Dame, USC Enjoy High Times</HD>
<DH>Football: In curious outcome, the schools are ranked Nos. 1
and 2 by New York Times computer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In news that may or may not be fit to print, Notre Dame and USC
premiered at No. 1 and No. 2 in the first New York Times college
football computer rankings released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Does this mean Notre Dame and USC are going to meet for the
national title?</LD>
<LD>   Well, no. That's all but impossible, given that the teams play
against each other in the regular season Nov. 30.</LD>
<TE>   Does this mean USC has the inside track to snag one of two bowl
championship series title-game spots?</TE>
<TE>   That's another big fat "No!"</TE>
<TE>   Do the New York Times rankings mean anything?</TE>
<TE>   Frankly, they will mean more on Nov. 30 than Sept. 30, and even
then, not that much.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Times' is only one of seven computers being used in
this year's BCS rankings, a four-pronged ratings system used to
determine which teams will play in the national title game Jan. 3 in
the Fiesta Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   USC's splendid position in the first New York Times' rankings
represents only a glimpse of a photograph that is not close to being
developed.</TE>
<TE>   "I will say this 5,000 times," John Paquette, Big East Conference
associate commissioner and BCS spokesman, said Monday, "The computer
is only 25% of the formula and we're using seven computers."</TE>
<TE>   So, USC fans, you do the math.</TE>
<TE>   The four BCS formula parts include poll average, losses, strength
of schedule and computer average, plus a quality-win bonus deduction
for victories over teams that finish in the top 10.</TE>
<TE>   In the computer component, a school's worst ranking is discarded,
the point total coming from the average of the six others.</TE>
<TE>   The schools with the two lowest cumulative point totals in the
final BCS standings advance to the title game.</TE>
<TE>   The first BCS standings will not be released until Oct. 21,
primarily because the BCS commissioners think it takes more than four
games to get accurate readings in the often wildly fluctuating
computers.</TE>
<TE>   If you believed the New York Times, the Oklahoma-Texas game Oct.
12, possibly the game of the year in college football, would be a
wire rewrite match-up between No. 11 and No. 29.</TE>
<TE>   Also, how does the New York Times explain 4-0 Kansas State being
15 spots behind USC, a team it defeated?</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Pete Carroll, for one, can't explain it.</TE>
<TE>   "They beat us. They ought to be ahead of us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   These discrepancies are one reason why some BCS computer
operators, such as Peter Wolfe in Los Angeles, have not yet begun
publishing weekly rankings.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how crazy early-season computer rankings can get: Among
other BCS computer rankings being published, USC ranks 33rd in
Richard Billingsley and 13th in the Colley Matrix.</TE>
<TE>   Far more important than the computers in the BCS system are poll
average and losses. The BCS commissioners' off-season decision to
eliminate margin of victory from the computer component has shifted
more power to the writers' and coaches' polls.</TE>
<TE>   It is all but impossible for a school to finish first or second in
the final BCS rankings without finishing fourth or better in the poll
component.</TE>
<TE>   This week, USC is ranked 18th in the Associated Press poll and
20th in the ESPN/USA Today coaches' poll, giving the Trojans a No. 19
poll average.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, USC has a lot of rungs left to climb.</TE>
<TE>   Also, nothing hurts more in the BCS than a defeat, and USC's loss
at Kansas State has already cost the Trojans a full BCS point.</TE>
<TE>   Each BCS computer has its own formula for determining team
strength. The New York Times' computer has its own wrinkles, one of
which is the way it calculates a ranked school's opponents' won-lost
record. For instance, Notre Dame's victories over Maryland, Michigan,
Purdue and Michigan State are not counted against those schools for
poll purposes.</TE>
<TE>   Confused?</TE>
<TE>   Listen to this early-season appraisal from BCS rankings man Jeff
Sagarin, who had USC at No. 4 last week.</TE>
<TE>   "Suppose there are 20 'key' games left to be played amongst the
elite teams," Sagarin responded in an e-mail query. "And suppose each
game could be considered a coin flip. Well that means there are
roughly 2 to the 20th power ways the elite teams can finish with each
other. And 2 to the 20th power is 1,048,576, which is pretty large."</TE>
<TE>   Bottom line?</TE>
<TE>   It's early.</TE>
<TE>   Wait until November.</TE>

<HD>Ad Aired in Error, Police Union Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Police Protective League on Monday distanced itself
from one of its own anti-secession television commercials, saying
that the spot was mistakenly aired after union officials had rejected
it.</LD>
<LD>   The ad portrays a police SWAT unit disappearing from a photograph
of the bloody 1997 North Hollywood bank robbery shootout, and warns
that the San Fernando Valley could lose "the protection of specially
trained LAPD officers" if secession wins. The spot aired Thursday on
KCBS-TV Channel 2 and KCAL-TV Channel 9.</LD>
<LD>   Police Protective League President Mitzi Grasso said the union
decided not to air the ad "because it just didn't sound the way we
wanted it to sound." She would not elaborate.</LD>
<TE>   Secessionists have accused the union of fear-mongering in its
campaign against a municipal breakup.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't be in the least surprised if they're withdrawing it,"
Sharon Jiminez, spokeswoman for the Hollywood secession campaign,
said of the ad. "Because it's bad.</TE>
<TE>   " ... First of all, the SWAT team officers are smiling as they
make an arrest, which is highly inappropriate," Jiminez said.</TE>
<TE>   The ad opens with the sounds of police sirens over a still image
of the bank robbery. "Today, Valley residents receive the protection
of specially trained LAPD officers," a narrator intones darkly.</TE>
<TE>   "And tomorrow?" the narration continues, as the SWAT unit
disappears. "In times like these, secession may not be worth the
risk."</TE>
<TE>   The police union has vowed to spend $400,000 on radio and TV ads
to fight secession by the Valley and Hollywood. The breakup measures
are on the Nov. 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Grasso said union officials rejected the ad when it was presented
to them last Wednesday by their media consultant. She did not know it
had aired the next day until a reporter informed her, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as I know, it was not supposed to be released--that's the
one we rejected," Grasso said. "I'm trying to figure out why it got
put on the air."</TE>
<TE>   But Mike Nelson, spokesman for KCBS, said that the union paid for
the ad and that it was placed into the rotation for the two stations,
which are both owned by Viacom.</TE>
<TE>   "We accepted it, and we ran it," Nelson said. The spot has since
been pulled, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Grasso said that as of late Monday, the union was still working on
language for a revised ad.</TE>

<HD>D.A. Bucks Plans to Retire on Ranch</HD>
<DH>Career: Ventura County's Michael Bradbury decides the quiet
life can wait. He will leave office two months early to join an L.A.
law firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So much for riding off into the sunset.</LD>
<LD>   When Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury announced last
year that he would not seek reelection, he said he planned a
retirement of family and friends, and of watching sunsets astride his
favorite cutting horse, Montana, on his Hang 'em High Ranch near
Ojai.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the veteran prosecutor says he will leave office two months
early to become a highly paid partner in a Los Angeles law firm
trying to expand its business in Ventura County and the Central
Coast.</LD>
<TE>   After 24 years as a tough-talking district attorney, the cowboy
lawman will turn over the prosecutorial reins to top deputy Greg
Totten, who won the office in March.</TE>
<TE>   Bradbury notified the Board of Supervisors on Monday that he will
resign Nov. 1 instead of leaving office at the end of his sixth term
in January.</TE>
<TE>   Bradbury, 60, the longest-serving prosecutor in Ventura County
history, will report three days later to his new job at Weston,
Benshoof, Rochefort, Rubalcava &amp; MacCuish, a 70-attorney business law
firm based in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   He will work in a Westlake office with new partner and longtime
friend Charles Cohen, a top land-use lawyer in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "I've decided I'm kind of a Type A personality, and it would be
hard for me to retire at this time," Bradbury said. "Finally, the
realization that I'm not ready to quit sunk in. I need to keep
working. I need to keep doing something. Maybe I'll be ready when I'm
65."</TE>
<TE>   A principal role for Bradbury will be to hustle Ventura County
business for his new firm. But he also plans to return to the
courtroom as a trial lawyer for the first time since the 1980s to
handle big civil cases in Los Angeles, he said. He will avoid Ventura
County courts.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be difficult to find a judge where there would not be a
need to disclose a conflict or to disqualify [the judge]," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the 28 judges on the Ventura County Superior Court are
former prosecutors from Bradbury's office, and he recommended them
for appointment by the governor. Indeed, Bradbury considers his main
legacy the high-quality attorneys he recruited or promoted and who
later went on to judgeships and top legal practices.</TE>
<TE>   Bradbury leaves behind a $157,000-a-year position as head of the
state's 10th-largest district attorney's office. He was first elected
in 1978, and his tenure at least doubles that of any other Ventura
County top prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   After 33 years in the district attorney's office, he will receive
a retirement benefit of about $135,000 annually. He would not
disclose his new wage, but said it is far more than he currently
earns. He said he was surprised at the law firms' interest once word
got out that he was in the market for a job.</TE>
<TE>   "I was offered more money at other [Los Angeles] firms," he said,
" but it's never been about money. I like the people at this firm.
And they've been very fair."</TE>
<TE>   Steven Weston, a principal partner for Bradbury's new employer,
said he expanded the firm into Ventura County a couple of years ago
by recruiting Cohen as a partner. Then Cohen introduced him to the
Ventura prosecutor. They have been talking seriously for six months,
Weston said.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike is incredibly impressive," he said. "You start talking to
him and it's like, 'Wow, what a guy!' I told him, 'You can work in
Westlake. You can work the hours you want.' He's got young children.
So he could do the things he wants to do, and the things our firm
wants him to do, too."</TE>
<TE>   In his new job, Bradbury's primary responsibility will be to help
the Weston firm expand from its three-lawyer Ventura County base,
which now focuses on land development.</TE>

<HD>State Joins U.S., N.Y. to Fight Terror</HD>
<DH>Intelligence: Agencies will be able to gather and analyze
information to avert attacks in what could be a model for the nation,
officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM OVEREND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Law enforcement officials in California have joined forces with two
partners who add a national dimension to local efforts to block
potential terrorist activities.</LD>
<LD>   The partnership links the state's anti-terrorism information
system with the New York Police Department's terrorism division and
the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency.</LD>
<LD>   State officials say there is no other information system like it,
but predict that it could become a model for an increasingly broad
national intelligence-sharing program.</LD>
<TE>   The new partnership was announced by Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer and
Gov. Gray Davis last week, but officials said New York City and
California have been working together for more than two months on
some anti-terror investigations.</TE>
<TE>   The Defense Intelligence Agency is expected to play an important
role in the partnership by providing analysts to help interpret
intelligence gathered on both coasts and to provide additional
intelligence available on identified suspects.</TE>
<TE>   The federal agency is responsible for protecting military forces
and bases against terrorist plots. The dozens of major military bases
in California attracted the military to the state's anti-terror
intelligence network, the California Anti-Terrorism Information
Center, known as CATIC.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Manavian, chief of criminal investigations for the state
Department of Justice, declined to discuss specific cases under
investigation, but outlined some hypothetical ways the partnership
could work.</TE>
<TE>   California might have suspects under surveillance who are
routinely in touch with New York City connections, for example.
Officials could alert New York to that, and agents there could start
their own surveillance or wiretapping operations, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Or New York officials could alert California agents to suspects
believed to be headed toward the state.</TE>
<TE>   Manavian believes that potential funding sources for terrorists
include Middle Eastern and East European drug rings operating in the
United States. He said the partnership could include sharing of
information on terrorist links to drug organizations.</TE>
<TE>   "The relationship with New York City is like gold," Manavian said.
"They have something like 500 cops in their terrorist unit, and they
are completely committed to sharing information."</TE>
<TE>   There are about 100 agents, investigators and analysts from the
state Department of Justice and 28 local, state and federal agencies
in California's CATIC system. They operate from offices in Los
Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego, Riverside, Fresno, San Francisco,
Santa Ana and Redding.</TE>
<TE>   CATIC was established to track information from 100,000 law
enforcement officers in California and to share it with agencies
ranging from the smallest police departments to the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say CATIC is working with law enforcement agencies on
443 open cases believed to be terrorist-related. There have been more
than 3,400 inquiries to CATIC about working cases, and the network
has caught overlapping investigations in almost 400 of those.</TE>
<TE>   Manavian describes it as the grass-roots intelligence collection
agency in California. Now, he said, it will be an even more
effective, with a national dimension that draws on the resources of
street cops on both coasts.</TE>
<TE>   And the involvement of the federal intelligence agency will
provide additional analysis capability to help detect patterns in
random bits of information, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Better analysis of all the information we have been getting has
been a major goal for us this year, and the defense department
analysts will help enormously," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the communication will be on secure computer and telephone
lines, Manavian said. Initially, four CATIC staffers will be assigned
to the project and others will be added as needed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This partnership will enable law enforcement officers to identify
potential terrorists and share information coast-to-coast," Lockyer
added in a statement. "This will help us prevent future attacks on
American soil."</TE>

<HD>ACLU, Lawyer to Get Voice on LAPD Decree</HD>
<DH>Police: Judge overseeing court-ordered reforms gives rights
advocates official status in the case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The federal judge overseeing reform of the Los Angeles Police
Department agreed Monday to give the American Civil Liberties Union
and a civil rights lawyer, Stephen Yagman, official voices in the
process.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys for the city and the U.S. Justice Department, parties to
a consent decree that placed the department under court oversight in
2000, had balked at allowing Yagman and the ACLU to intervene.</LD>
<LD>   Patricia Glaser, a private lawyer representing the city, argued
that adding parties to the case would complicate and impede
implementation of the reforms.</LD>
<TE>   The court's independent monitor "will be undermined by everybody
coming in and saying, 'Your honor, what about this? What about that?'
" Glaser told U.S. District Judge Gary A. Feess.</TE>
<TE>   Feess said he is willing to give it a try. "I don't know how this
is going to play out," he said. "We'll take it one step at a time."</TE>
<TE>   In April, a federal appeals court overruled Feess and stated that
the Los Angeles Police Protective League had a legal right to
participate because some of the reforms involve employee contract
issues.</TE>
<TE>   The court said, however, that Feess had been correct in denying
mandatory intervention to individuals and community groups on grounds
that, presumably, the government was protecting their interests.
Nevertheless, the appellate court strongly encouraged Feess to allow
the grass-roots groups to join the case, because "they have suffered
from the unconstitutional police misconduct that forms the basis of
the United States' suit" against the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Appearing before Feess on Monday, the ACLU's legal director, Mark
Rosenbaum, said giving community groups official status in the case
with the right to file court motions would spur the Police Department
to comply with the decree.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenbaum cited a recent report by the court's independent
monitor, Michael Cherkasky, that the department was out of compliance
with 29 of 58 reforms required under the consent decree.</TE>
<TE>   "The hard facts are that this decree is not being effectively
enforced," the ACLU lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenbaum said that he did not mean to disparage the efforts of
the Justice Department, the court monitor or Feess, but that
effective enforcement of the reforms requires input from the
community.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to itself, the ACLU represents the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, Homeboy Industries, the Asian Pacific American
Legal Center, Radio Sin Fronteres and 12 individuals.</TE>
<TE>   Yagman said he wanted to intervene partly because of the wealth of
information he has amassed from two decades of suing the LAPD for
alleged civil rights violations. He also told Feess that issues
raised in the consent decree case were likely to affect pending civil
suits arising out of the Rampart Division police corruption scandal,
in which officers were accused of unjustifiably beating, shooting and
planting evidence on suspected gang members.</TE>
<TE>   Yagman represents a large number of Rampart litigants. It was the
Rampart case that triggered the Justice Department's lawsuit that led
to the consent decree.</TE>

<HD>Court Opens Way for Armenian's Deportation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court has cleared the way for the possible
deportation of a community leader from Little Armenia who was once
convicted of plotting to transport dynamite to bomb the office of a
Turkish diplomat.</LD>
<LD>   The decision reverses the ruling of a federal judge who granted
citizenship to Viken Yacoubian after the Immigration and
Naturalization Service refused his application, in part because of
his past terrorist  activities.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said the judge had abused
her discretion and should have left the matter for the INS to decide.
Yacoubian, the principal of the Rose and Alex Pilibos Armenian School
in Hollywood, could face new INS proceedings.</LD>
<TE>   A teenager when he committed the crime, the 39-year-old Yacoubian
eventually became a highly regarded member of the Armenian American
community in Los Angeles. A co-defendant, Viken Hovsepian, 42, also
could be deported.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether the actions of their youth justify deportation under our
immigration laws is a question for the political branches of
government. Judicial sympathy only functions within prescribed
parameters of the law," wrote appellate Justice Diarmuid F.
O'Scannlain.</TE>
<TE>   Yacoubian, Hovsepian and two other men were arrested in November
1982, after FBI agents seized dynamite in the baggage claim area at
Logan International Airport in Boston. The explosives had been flown
from Los Angeles as part of a plan to bomb the Philadelphia office of
the Turkish consul general.</TE>
<TE>   Yacoubian served a two-year prison term. His record was eventually
expunged under the federal youth corrections act.</TE>
<TE>   Yacoubian's attorney was not available for comment.</TE>

<HD>$14.2-Million Grant Awarded to UC Irvine for Science
Education</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UC Irvine announced Monday that it has been awarded a $14.2-million
grant from the National Science Foundation to develop teachers in
those disciplines for preschool through 12th-grade classes.</LD>
<LD>   "What this does," said Juan Francisco Lara, the university's
assistant vice chancellor and director of its Center for Educational
Partnerships, "is define UCI as the preeminent leader in math and
science education in California. This is where the epicenter is."</LD>
<LD>   Under the terms of the grant, the university will provide
after-school and Saturday development classes for math and science
teachers serving three Southern California school districts: Compton,
Newport-Mesa (westside Costa Mesa schools) and Santa Ana.</LD>
<TE>   Among the estimated 100,000 students in those districts,
university officials said, are a large number who are poor or not
fluent in English.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to training teachers, Lara said, the university will
direct an "aggressive outreach" to encourage some of its 22,600
undergraduate students to consider careers as science and math
teachers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a national problem," he said, "and the problem is that, in
general, instruction in math and science at the secondary level is
uneven across the state. Most universities [in discussing outreach]
are talking about students already enrolled in their graduate
schools. I'm talking about freshmen and sophomores and juniors. With
a serious, aggressive outreach effort, we could probably come up with
10% of the student body who would say 'Sure, I'll consider it.' "</TE>
<TE>   The grant--to be disbursed over the next five years--is the second
largest in the university's history and the largest from the science
foundation, said Tom Vasich, a UC Irvine spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "It really enters us into something much more far-reaching than
what we've done in the past," he said.</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine was one of seven educational institutions
nationwide--and the only one in California--to be awarded science
foundation grants. The others are the University of North Carolina;
University of Texas, El Paso; Baltimore County Public Schools;
University of Wisconsin, Madison; University of Kentucky and Rutgers
University in New Jersey.</TE>

<HD>State Loses Claim to $740 Million in U.S. Health-Care Funds</HD>
<DH>Insurance: Money, expected to be freed soon, is for
children in Healthy Families plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California was forced to relinquish, at least temporarily, about $740
million in federal funds on Monday, because it had been unable to
spend the money for children's health care within three years, as
required.</LD>
<LD>   But, to the relief of state officials, Congress is expected to
extend the deadline on spending the money because about three dozen
other states are in the same position.</LD>
<LD>   The problem, health experts say, is that California got a slow
start enrolling children in its Healthy Families program, which
covers youngsters whose families earn too much to qualify for
Medi-Cal but not enough to afford private health insurance.</LD>
<TE>   And now, because of the state's budget problems, Gov. Gray Davis
has postponed a much-anticipated expansion of Healthy Families that
would cover low-income parents. The expansion would have allowed the
state to draw down more federal matching funds. For every $1 the
state spends on the program, the federal government provides $2.</TE>
<TE>   Under the law creating the Children's Health Insurance Program,
states have three years to use their annual federal allocations
before the money is redistributed to other states. Ultimately, if the
money is not spent, it returns to the U.S. Treasury.</TE>
<TE>   California has paid a steep price for its slow start. In the last
two years, it has given up claims to $706 million in unspent federal
money from fiscal years 1998 and 1999, according to the Managed Risk
Medical Insurance Board, which administers Healthy Families.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the federal government allocated $855 million to
California, but officials spent only $2 million that year, the agency
said. In 1999, the state spent $68 million and received an additional
allocation of $851 million.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for the poor say California officials have made unwise
budget choices, which now leaves them with a predicament.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel that the governor and Legislature could have moved much
more quickly in expanding the program and using up some of the
funds," said Jim Keddy, director of the PICO California Project, a
faith-based network of local organizing groups. "It's a misuse of
funds that should be spent on California families."</TE>
<TE>   Grantland Johnson, California's secretary of health and human
services, said the spending guidelines created by the federal
government have made it impossible for the state to spend its
allocation within the time frame. He said the governor has asked the
state's congressional delegation to get more time for California.</TE>
<TE>   When Davis took office in January 1999, Johnson said, about 50,000
children were covered under the Healthy Families program. "As I
speak, we cover about 600,000 kids, which is an 11-fold increase," he
added. "There's no other state that has matched that effort."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has been working with the
Senate Finance Committee to craft a solution. Her spokesman, Howard
Gantman, said that "the state still needs to step up its efforts to
ensure no eligible child is uninsured."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Scully, administrator of the U.S. Centers for Medicare &amp;
Medicaid Services, said he had urged Congress to pass a bill giving
relief to California and other states.</TE>

<HD>Burial Site Discovery Halts Development</HD>
<DH>Seal Beach: Native American remains are found at Hellman
Ranch. Builder says it's working with monitors, but one says issues
are unresolved.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State officials have halted construction of a gated community in Seal
Beach after the discovery of the remains of at least 18 Native
Americans on land a local tribe considers a sacred burial ground.</LD>
<LD>   The cease-and-desist order by the California Coastal Commission is
the latest twist in the 21-year history of the Hellman Ranch, a
196-acre property between the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station and
the San Gabriel River.</LD>
<LD>   While Native American activists picketed the Heron Pointe project
Monday, a representative of developer John Laing Homes said the
company had reached an agreement with official representatives of the
Tongva people to conduct extensive archeological testing on the site.</LD>
<TE>   "John Laing Homes is sensitive to the privacy of Native American
descendants, and any recovery of remains we are managing with the
dignity and respect they deserve," said Joanie Madrid, Heron Pointe
project manager.</TE>
<TE>   The commission issued the stop-work order last month, halting the
grading of pads for 70 single-family homes on 18 acres of the ranch.
Peter Douglas, the commission's executive director, said the agency's
staff asked the developer to halt work once the remains were found.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas said he issued the order only after the developer refused
to halt work voluntarily. Madrid disagreed, saying grading was
stopped Sept. 14--two days before the order was issued.</TE>
<TE>   Commission staff members are scheduled to meet today with the
developer and Native American groups in Long Beach. Douglas said he
is not interested in penalizing Laing Homes, only in making sure that
the remains are handled properly.</TE>
<TE>   The agency issued final approval for the project late last year,
allowing development near the San Gabriel River and requiring 150
acres to be sold eventually for conservation and wetlands
restoration.</TE>
<TE>   Madrid said the developer has reached an agreement with the
monitors, and the "most likely descendant" of the local tribe, who is
assigned by the Native American Heritage Commission. The developer
will excavate more than 100 test sites. Finding bones or artifacts
will lead to additional digs.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal is to find anything that is in the ground," Madrid said.
"We've been working very closely with Native Americans all along."</TE>
<TE>   But one Native American monitor said there is no agreement on what
to do with the remains, and other issues are also unresolved. Remains
now are being stored and will eventually be reinterred.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan David, who said a total of 20 sets of remains have been
unearthed and expects more to be found, disputed the developer's
assertion that it has worked with the Native American community.
David said that at one point, he and another monitor had to stand
between a burial site and bulldozers to stop it from being destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   "My job is to ensure the safety of the ancestors and artifacts out
there," he said. "Beyond that, it's my duty as a Native American to
stop somebody from desecrating a spiritual area, specifically a
burial site."</TE>
<TE>   Madrid, however, said that no confrontation occurred and that the
story was being spread by a monitor who opposes any development. A
handful of activists continued picketing the site Monday evening.</TE>
<TE>   Andy "Young Plow" Morales said he would like to see all
development stopped. "Our goal is to preserve the land, to protect
the land and to protect the buried ancestors," said Morales, the son
of the chief of the Gabrielino-Tongva Nation.</TE>
<TE>   "Our ancestors have been dug up and disturbed.... How would [the
developer] like it if Native American people go to their ancestral
land, dig up their ancestors and put them in boxes or museums, or
throw them away in the trash and abuse them?"</TE>

<HD>Kin Lose in Court on Israel Bequest</HD>
<DH>Law: A judge rules against the survivors of a Laguna Hills
man who left $5 million to that nation's institutions. Pair seeking
money say uncle was hoodwinked.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County judge on Monday refused to void the will of a Laguna
Hills millionaire whose relatives say was conned out of his fortune
by the state of Israel.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge James P. Gray said 88-year-old Simon Lechtuz
was of sound mind when he bequeathed $5 million directly to Israel's
military, the Israel Institute of Technology and Hadassah Medical
Center. Relatives say Lechtuz was coerced into the deal by a false
promise that he would be buried in Israel.</LD>
<LD>   But the judge said that claim was never proved.</LD>
<TE>   "Mr. Lechtuz certainly had the hope that he would be able to be
buried in a cemetery in Israel, but this he knew was not a condition
to his bequest in his will," Gray said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the plaintiffs--Lechtuz's niece, Yoseffa Teitel, and
nephew, Philip Linder--argued that Lechtuz was fooled by legal fine
print and wanted his estate divided among his relatives in the United
States and Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Although his will said he wished to be buried in Israel, Lechtuz
was buried by a county public administrator at El Toro Memorial
Cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   The relatives, most of whom had never met Lechtuz, paid for him to
be exhumed and reburied in Haifa, Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Gray said this did not entitle the relatives to Lechtuz's fortune.</TE>
<TE>   "He simply was not interested in leaving any of his money to his
nieces and nephews," Gray said.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Lechtuz was quoted as saying, 'I'm not close to relatives.
They didn't do anything for me; let them earn it themselves.' "</TE>
<TE>   Charles H. Kanter, the lawyer representing Israel and its Los
Angeles consulate, said it was unfortunate that Lechtuz was buried in
a secular county cemetery, but that it was not Israel's fault.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened was, there were no nieces and nephews around when
he died, and when you die alone you get buried by the public
administrator," Kanter said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was buried even before the state of Israel knew he died."</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiffs' attorney Gary Kuist said relatives were considering an
appeal.</TE>

<LD>It's youth soccer season, and during one game a Long Beach coach was
trying to persuade a 9-year-old that he was destined to score the
next goal.</LD>
<LD>   "This ball has your name on it!" the coach exclaimed. "This ball
has your name on it!"</LD>
<LD>   The literal-minded lad replied: "No, that's not my ball."</LD>
<TE>   Unclear on the concept: A multipurpose waffle maker that can,
among other things, remove the wrinkles in your clothes (see photo)
caught the eye of Lynn Gill of Rolling Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Wonder if these ducks have AFLAC? Reinhard Koehler of San Gabriel
discovered that the city of Bishop is a risky place for quackers
crossing the street (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Prince Linus of Denmark? With another report from the road, Judi
Birnberg of Sherman Oaks came upon a St. George, Utah, group that is
willing to let Shakespeare go to the dogs--or at least to Snoopy (see
accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Ouch! That price hurts! Paul Herbert of Yorba Linda quipped that a
use has been found for a common nuisance (see photo). Actually, "bed
bug" is trucker terminology.</TE>
<TE>   No need for the SWAT team: Crime is rare in Laguna Beach, but
residents keep police busy with unusual phone calls, including two
that involved matters of low finance.</TE>
<TE>   The Coastline Pilot said that police heard "from a resident in a
drive-through who claimed that his order was incorrect and the
employee refused him change."</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the Lagunan who "contacted an officer thinking she
might have received more money from an ATM than she requested."
Police confirmed that she had received the right amount.</TE>
<TE>   Which reminds me: I worked as a clerk in the snack shack for my
son's Little League team one afternoon and regrettably was a bit
sloppy when it came time to make change. I was supposed to give one
kid 50 cents back but instead handed him three quarters, realizing my
mistake too late and too embarrassed to say anything.</TE>
<TE>   He studied the coins in his hand for a moment, trying to make a
moral decision. Then he looked over at the sign that said: "Krispy
Kreme Donuts, 75 Cents." I don't have to tell you what he decided. (I
dug into my pockets and contributed the missing quarter to the cash
register.)</TE>
<TE>   Her kind of billing: Angelyne, occupation unknown, the mysterious
character who stars in her own billboard ads, is running for the City
Council of the proposed burg of Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, surveys show that secession will most likely fail in
Tinseltown. If so, her election would be meaningless, but in keeping
with her career. As Angelyne bragged years ago: "I'm the first person
ever to become famous for doing nothing."</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Dodger season ticket holder Michael Horowicz said that
the other night when the score of the Dodger game was 0-0 in the
eighth inning, Nancy Bea Hefley, the always-attentive stadium
organist, played "I've Got Plenty of Nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Hey, maybe that could be Angelyne's campaign song!</TE>

<LD>Gov. Gray Davis has signed into law a bill that exempts the Orange
County Sanitation District from state fines as long as it acts in
good faith to upgrade sewage treatment by 2013.</LD>
<LD>   The district holds a federal waiver from the Clean Water Act that
allows it to discharge dirtier sewage than nearly all of the nation's
16,000 sewage treatment plants. This year, the district's board of
directors voted not to seek renewal of the waiver, which expires next
year, and instead to upgrade to full secondary treatment.</LD>
<LD>   Because of recent changes in state law, the district would have
faced mandatory minimum fines of $3,000 a day for noncompliance,
because it technically would not have a waiver in place yet needs 11
years to complete the upgrade.</LD>

<LD>Orange County health officials closed the waters off the Harbor
Patrol dock in Dana Point Harbor on Monday after learning that a
vessel pump-out station has been leaking for an unknown period of
time. The station is used to unload sewage from boat toilets.</LD>
<LD>   The waters off the dock are used by divers working on boats; they
will remain off-limits until water-quality tests show they are safe.
Swimming in sewage-tainted water can cause gastrointestinal problems;
eye, ear, nose and throat infections; and viral diseases such as
hepatitis.</LD>
<LD>   The closure is the 25th time this year that Orange County waters
have been deemed unsafe because they were tainted by sewage.</LD>

<HD>Shows Will Go On, Thanks to a Supporting Cast of 340</HD>
<DH>Arts: A fund-raising drive brings in $200,000 for Ventura's
Rubicon Theatre, enough to save this season's programs.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Rubicon Theatre Company brings world-class acting talent to the
city of Ventura, but because of a sluggish economy its financial
performance lately has been dismal.</LD>
<LD>   Things got so bad that five weeks ago the board of directors
decided something or someone had to give. Five families who support
the theater donated $95,000 and challenged others to match that
amount.</LD>
<LD>   As of Monday, 340 people have chipped in to give the Rubicon more
than $200,000, enough to break even for this year's season and give
the financially strapped company breathing room.</LD>
<TE>   Karyl Lynn Burns, one of the Rubicon's founders, said support for
the theater in Ventura was "groundbreaking" in light of the general
financial downturn in support of the arts and last week's closing of
the Music Theater of Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   A sagging stock market and a sputtering economy account for most
of the drop in giving, Burns said.</TE>
<TE>   But theater supporters came to Ventura's Pierpont Inn on Monday to
celebrate the company's new-found solvency.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Kearney, a financial advisor with Merrill Lynch and president
of the Rubicon board of directors, said the theater company was still
finding its way financially.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a board fully committed to becoming financially
successful," he said. "We can pay off our payables this year, but we
are still not flush with cash."</TE>
<TE>   The Rubicon began in November 1998 with a production of "Jesus
Christ Superstar." Staffed largely by volunteers, actors and
musicians had to fly themselves in to perform. The company's home is
at the Laurel Theater on Main Street in Ventura. One-third of its
funding comes from ticket sales and the rest from donations.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say the theater lets them watch nationally known
performers in their own backyard. They also said thousands of Ventura
County schoolchildren have benefited by attending the performances.</TE>
<TE>   "It's now a destination for people coming into the area," said
Cynde Magidson, who along with her husband, Steve, donated $25,000 to
the theater. "And the actors love performing here because the
community treats them so well."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Dee Dee Lynn Magno, star of Broadway's "Miss Saigon,"
came from Los Angeles to sing for and support the theater.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope to play at the Rubicon myself someday," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Emmy Award-winning actor Joe Spano of "Hill Street Blues" and
"NYPD Blue" also attended. Spano has performed in a number of Rubicon
productions and says it reminds him of his early days with a small
theater company in Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Television and movies are one thing, he said, but performing live
gives him the most satisfaction.</TE>
<TE>   "In theater you are there when it all happens," he said. "And I
also discovered when I worked here, that I loved the people here."</TE>
<TE>   Burns said the company overextended itself recently and plans to
pare down productions and programs next year.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have many sold-out performances, but we just have to
hunker down and weather this current economic climate," she said.</TE>

<LD>One man was fatally shot and another seriously wounded during a
vehicle-to-vehicle shooting in Woodland Hills that police detectives
said Monday was carried out by three men in a white Cadillac sport
utility vehicle.</LD>
<LD>   Dana Benson Sherman, 32, of Escondido died early Monday, nearly a
day after he was taken to Northridge Hospital Medical Center with a
gunshot wound in his chest.</LD>
<LD>   A 29-year-old Woodland Hills man driving the car was hit twice in
the legs and taken to Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Woodland Hills,
said Los Angeles Police Department homicide Det. Rick Swanston of the
West Valley Division.</LD>
<TE>   Police were at a loss for a motive.</TE>
<TE>   Sherman, his brother and the driver were riding in a 1999 Nissan
Altima that had stopped at a traffic light at Califa Street and
Canoga Avenue just after midnight.</TE>
<TE>   A Cadillac Escalade EXT with tinted windows, 22-inch chrome wheels
and a small pickup bed pulled up in the next lane.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the men in the SUV pulled out pistols and shot at the men
in the Altima, who were unarmed, Swanston said. More than a dozen
shots were fired.</TE>
<TE>   Sherman's brother, a 19-year-old Panorama City man, was not hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities withheld the names of the survivors of the shooting.</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles police appealed for help Monday to find a gunman who
killed a 20-year-old Cerritos woman as she tried to shield her
toddler, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Krystle Tashell White died after being confronted by a group of
teenage boys near the intersection of 83rd Street and Avalon
Boulevard in South-Central Los Angeles about 7:20 p.m. Wednesday. She
was riding in a car with a 26-year-old male friend and her
22-month-old son.</LD>
<LD>   According to LAPD Detective Rudy Lemos, four or five young people,
16 to 20 years old, rode alongside the car on bicycles and confronted
the occupants, issuing gang challenges.</LD>
<TE>   White got out of the car, told the youths that neither she nor her
companion was a gang member, asked them to leave her alone and got
back in.</TE>
<TE>   One of them then fired several shots through the window, striking
her in the lower torso. At the moment she was shot, White was leaning
over toward her son in the back seat, apparently trying to shield
him.</TE>
<TE>   White died from her wounds. Police said her companion was cut by
glass and her son was unhurt.</TE>
<TE>   White was a devoted mother who took her son everywhere, her aunt,
Ramona Fluker, said.</TE>
<TE>   She worked as a caregiver in a group home for developmentally
disabled people, Fluker said.</TE>
<TE>   Family members said Monday that the family is stricken, and eager
for the killer to be caught.</TE>
<TE>   "You have no idea the devastation," said an aunt, Tina Rosado.
"You don't know what this does."</TE>
<TE>   White is survived by her son Corey Walker Jr.; fiance Corey Walker
Sr.; parents Kevin White Sr. and Tracy White; and siblings Kevin Jr.,
James, Taylor and Tyler.</TE>
<TE>   Lemos asked anyone who has any information about the killing to
call (213) 485-1383, or call after hours, (213) 485-2504.</TE>

<HD>NRA Strongly Backs Simon</HD>
<DH>Politics: Group vows to defeat Davis, who has signed
gun-control legislation. Its endorsement is expected to help the
Republican with conservatives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The National Rifle Assn. on Monday announced its endorsement of
Republican Bill Simon Jr. for governor, saying "we will do everything
we can" to defeat the Democratic incumbent, Gray Davis.</LD>
<LD>   The NRA endorsement could help Simon solidify his conservative
base, but it complicates his efforts to appeal to
moderates--particularly women and suburbanites--whose votes he needs
to beat Davis.</LD>
<LD>   The governor has showcased his support for gun control in
television ads that depict Simon as too conservative for mainstream
Californians. Davis angered the NRA last week by signing a law that
removes gun manufacturers' liability protection.</LD>
<TE>   Chris Cox, the NRA's chief lobbyist, said Davis "has handled the
2nd Amendment about as well as he's handled California's energy
crisis."</TE>
<TE>   "Gray Davis does not trust California's hunters, sportsmen and
law-abiding gun owners to protect themselves and their loved ones,"
Cox said. "What Gray Davis has demonstrated is his utter disregard
for common sense."</TE>
<TE>   The gun liability legislation, he said, "jeopardizes a legitimate
American industry by holding them responsible for the criminal acts
of those that ought to be incarcerated."</TE>
<TE>   Cox declined to say how much money the NRA might put into Simon's
campaign. "We will certainly do everything we can to communicate to
our members that Gray Davis is probably the worst governor in the
country when it comes to defending their 2nd Amendment freedoms," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon reiterated his opposition to gun control in an interview
Monday morning on a conservative radio talk show on KRLA-AM 870 in
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have enough gun laws, and I think we should have a
moratorium on new gun legislation," Simon said. "What we ought to be
doing is enforcing our gun laws."</TE>
<TE>   The Simon campaign welcomed the NRA endorsement.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pleased that a group that permits safe use of firearms
supports us," campaign spokesman Mark Miner said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis spokesman Roger Salazar said, "Bill Simon ending up in the
hip holster of the NRA underscores how out of step he is with
Californians."</TE>
<TE>   The NRA announcement came on a day when Simon was emphasizing tax
cuts and other conservative themes at the Richard Nixon Library in
Yorba Linda.</TE>
<TE>   In a speech to nearly 200 supporters, he renewed his pledge to cut
capital gains taxes and roll back state regulations that apply to the
timber, agriculture and home-building industries.</TE>
<TE>   Simon also accused Davis of undermining California's economy by
hitting employers with higher costs for electricity and for insurance
to cover workers injured on the job.</TE>
<TE>   Davis campaign spokesman Gabriel Sanchez denied that there has
been any "mass exodus of businesses leaving the state," saying that
900,000 jobs have been created in California since the governor took
office.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Davis released three new television ads Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Two of them promote the governor's record on crime, health care
and other issues. The third, the latest in a series of Davis spots
that question Simon's record as an investment banker, says that the
U.S. Justice Department was "suing Simon's company for defrauding the
Postal Service."</TE>
<TE>   "Bill Simon: If we can't trust his business practices, how can we
trust him in the governor's office?" a narrator asks.</TE>
<TE>   The ad refers to a federal government lawsuit against Pacific
Precision Metals Inc., a company owned by William E. Simon &amp; Sons,
the candidate's family investment firm.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said he had not seen the ad, but called it "just another lie
by Gray Davis."</TE>
<TE>   He said his firm had invested in Pacific Precision Metals, but "I
had no personal involvement myself. Neither myself nor our firm are
being investigated."</TE>
<TE>   "It's about time we start talking about what the citizens of
California really want to hear about," Simon said. "And that's his
track record and my vision. His track record is failed."</TE>

<HD>40% of Local Juniors Fail High School Exit Exam</HD>
<DH>Education: Poor results on the state test in Ventura County
put principals and teachers on alert. The students have seven more
chances.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At least 40% of Ventura County 11th-graders have not yet qualified
for high school graduation because they have failed the math section
of the state's new exit exam, according to results released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The students will have seven more chances to get through both the
language and math sections of the California High School Exit Exam
before June 2004.</LD>
<LD>   But the results so far mean teachers and principals have their
work cut out for them in the next two years, particularly when
dealing with students still learning English and those who come from
poor homes, said Charles Weis, Ventura County superintendent of
schools.</LD>
<TE>   "It's serious business now," Weis said. "It's time for every high
school to examine their own curriculum and instruction to make sure
standards are being taught in those classrooms for all kids."</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, 52% of students scheduled to graduate in 2004 still
must pass one or more sections of the exam, a state report said. The
test, a mix of multiple-choice questions and essays, covers language
arts material that is supposed to be taught by the 10th grade, and
mathematics concepts through Algebra I.</TE>
<TE>   The test scores came from exams given to more than 6,300 Ventura
County sophomores in the spring. Combined with results from the same
class in spring 2001--when thousands of ninth-graders took the exam
voluntarily--77% of local students have passed the language portion
of the test and 60% have passed in math, according to estimates
calculated by Weis' office.</TE>
<TE>   Among individual school districts, results varied widely.</TE>
<TE>   For example, in affluent Oak Park, 99% of this year's juniors have
passed the language test and 91% have passed in math, leaving only a
handful of students who need to worry about the test this year.</TE>
<TE>   "It was pretty mind-boggling to me," said Principal Cliff Moore of
Oak Park High School.</TE>
<TE>   But across the county in working-class Oxnard, 51% of 11th-graders
still must pass the math test, and 31% have yet to clear the language
portion.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Davis, superintendent of the Oxnard Union High School
District, said the numbers concern him.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is the key challenge to high school education," Davis
said. "All of these students must pass or they won't receive a
diploma. That's a real problem to California."</TE>
<TE>   Tutoring sessions before and after school have been offered on
many campuses for the last two years, and several districts set up
optional exit-exam intensive courses this summer.</TE>
<TE>   But providing extra help is only one piece of the puzzle,
educators said. Students must realize the seriousness of the exam and
take advantage of the special programs being offered, Weis said.</TE>
<TE>   Convincing them has proved difficult, however, in some of Ventura
County's lowest-performing districts, where a greater percentage of
students also must deal with social issues such as poverty and
neighborhood violence on a daily basis. As a result, some school
officials are shifting from optional assistance to required
intervention.</TE>
<TE>   At Oxnard Union's six high schools, students who didn't pass the
language test in the spring were automatically enrolled in a new
remedial reading course this fall, Davis said. The course curriculum
is based strictly on the subject matter covered in the exit exam.</TE>
<TE>   Students may only opt out of the class and replace it with an
elective after they pass the language section of the test, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Similar efforts are underway at high schools in Fillmore and Santa
Paula, which have among the lowest exit-exam passing rates in the
county, according to state data.</TE>
<TE>   At Fillmore High School, 66 juniors have failed both sections of
the exam. They are all enrolled in a remedial reading class in
addition to the regular 11th-grade English course and a before- or
after-school math tutorial class, said Assistant Supt. Martha Tureen
of Fillmore Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   Of particular concern, she said, are those students classified as
English-language learners. Fewer than one-third of them passed the
language portion of the test countywide last spring.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Paula, where at least 60% of juniors haven't yet
qualified for graduation, high school officials are preparing to
launch a special exit exam "academy" that would focus on remedial
math and reading concepts.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be a tunnel toward passing the exit exam," said Supt.
Bill Brand of Santa Paula Union High School District.</TE>
<TE>   But such approaches are drawing criticism from some teachers, who
question whether students will be robbed of a well-rounded education
as a result.</TE>
<TE>   "The majority of our kids are already passing the exam two years
before they graduate," said Alicia Reynolds, a teacher at Puente High
School in Oxnard. "I think we will figure out a way to get the others
through it. But whether or not that actually results in a quality
education remains to be seen."</TE>

<HD>D.A. Bucks Plans to Retire to His Ranch, Will Join L.A. Law
Firm</HD>
<DH>Career: Michael Bradbury decides the quiet life can wait.
He tells Ventura County supervisors he will leave Nov. 1, two months
early.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So much for riding off into the sunset.</LD>
<LD>   When Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury announced last
year that he would not seek reelection, he said he planned a
retirement of family and friends, and of watching sunsets astride his
favorite cutting horse, Montana, on his Hang 'em High Ranch near
Ojai.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the veteran prosecutor says he will leave office two months
early to become a highly paid partner in a Los Angeles law firm
trying to expand its business in Ventura County and the Central
Coast.</LD>
<TE>   After 24 years as a tough-talking district attorney, the cowboy
lawman will turn over the prosecutorial reins to top deputy Greg
Totten, who won the office in March.</TE>
<TE>   Bradbury notified the Board of Supervisors on Monday that he will
resign Nov. 1 instead of leaving office at the end of his sixth term
in January.</TE>
<TE>   Bradbury, 60, the longest-serving prosecutor in Ventura County
history, will report three days later to his new job at Weston,
Benshoof, Rochefort, Rubalcava &amp; MacCuish, a 70-attorney business law
firm based in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   He will work in a Westlake office with new partner and longtime
friend Charles Cohen, a top land-use lawyer in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "I've decided I'm kind of a Type A personality, and it would be
hard for me to retire at this time," Bradbury said. "Finally, the
realization that I'm not ready to quit sunk in. I need to keep
working. I need to keep doing something. Maybe I'll be ready when I'm
65."</TE>
<TE>   A principal role for Bradbury will be to hustle Ventura County
business for his new firm. But he also plans to return to the
courtroom as a trial lawyer for the first time since the 1980s to
handle big civil cases in Los Angeles, he said. He will avoid Ventura
County courts.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be difficult to find a judge where there would not be a
need to disclose a conflict or to disqualify [the judge]," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the 28 judges on the Ventura County Superior Court are
former prosecutors from Bradbury's office, and he recommended them
for appointment by the governor. Indeed, Bradbury considers his main
legacy the high-quality attorneys he recruited or promoted and who
later went on to judgeships and top legal practices.</TE>
<TE>   Bradbury leaves behind a $157,000-a-year position as head of the
state's 10th largest district attorney's office. First elected in
1978, his tenure at least doubles that of any other Ventura County
top prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   After 33 years in the district attorney's office, he will receive
a retirement benefit of about $135,000 annually. He would not
disclose his new wage, but said it is far more than he currently
earns. He said he was surprised at the law firms' interest once word
got out that he was in the market for a job.</TE>
<TE>   "I was offered more money at other [Los Angeles] firms," he said,
"but it's never been about money. I like the people at this firm. And
they've been very fair."</TE>
<TE>   Steven Weston, a principal partner for Bradbury's new employer,
said he expanded the firm into Ventura County a couple of years ago
by recruiting Cohen as a partner. Then Cohen introduced him to the
Ventura prosecutor. They have been talking seriously for six months,
Weston said.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike is incredibly impressive," he said. "You start talking to
him and it's like, 'Wow, what a guy!' I told him, 'You can work in
Westlake. You can work the hours you want.' He's got young children.
So he could do the things he wants to do, and the things our firm
wants him to do, too."</TE>
<TE>   Weston said he marveled at the references on Bradbury's resume. "I
said, 'I'm upset, I don't see President Bush's name on here.' He
said, 'I could put it there.' " Bradbury, a Republican, was a
finalist last fall for the U.S. attorney post in Los Angeles, and he
withdrew his name from consideration for appointment to the federal
bench earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   In his new job, Bradbury's primary responsibility will be to help
the Weston firm expand from its three-lawyer Ventura County base,
which now focuses on land development.</TE>
<TE>   "Along that [Freeway] 101 corridor the potential clients just
stick out--the large high-tech companies, labor and employment, and
we're very interested in breaking into agriculture," Weston said. "Of
course, Mike has a lot of contacts there."</TE>
<TE>   Bradbury might also help create a white-collar crimes unit at the
firm, Weston said. "I've spent a lot of time with Mike talking about
ways we could work together and expand the firm," he said. "We're
looking at Mike for the future."</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, Bradbury's future looked a lot slower.</TE>
<TE>   He'd planned nothing more strenuous than playing with his two
sons--Mike, 6, and Sean, 4--and appreciating the Yosemite Valley
lithographs of his artist wife, Heidi, a former elementary school
teacher.</TE>
<TE>   He also figured to hone his roping and riding skills on some of
the 12 Arabian and quarter horses the family keeps on a 10-acre
ranch. He'd also tend a mule and a donkey, some pigs, sheep and
goats, six dogs and a pack of cats.</TE>
<TE>   And he and his wife would continue their quest to adopt another
two young children.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of children who need good homes, and we have a
lot of love," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Those plans are still alive. But during the last 18 months, as his
time to leave the prosecutor's office approached, Bradbury said he
began to worry that he'd decided to retire too soon.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had friends, CEOs and hard chargers, retire," he said. "And
after six months or a year, they were restless and unhappy and
questioning their value. I thought at first it wouldn't bother me.
But then I decided it would be hard for me to truly retire."</TE>
<TE>   As for Totten, Bradbury's hand-picked successor, the district
attorney said he thinks the office might be in even better hands than
during his own tenure. At 48, Totten is older and more experienced
than the 36-year-old Bradbury was when he took over.</TE>
<TE>   "He's generally more talented, more compassionate and caring,"
Bradbury said. "I'm not saying I lack compassion, but I'm one of
those guys where it's, 'Damn the torpedoes and take the hill.' Greg
is more reflective."</TE>

<HD>Delay in Exit Exams Weighed Due to Failures</HD>
<DH>Education: Only 48% of the Class of 2004 have passed the
English and math portions of test, results show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State officials are discussing whether to postpone enforcement of
California's new high school graduation exam because so many students
are failing the test.</LD>
<LD>   Less than half of the state's current 11th-graders have passed
both the English and math portions of the exam, according to results
released Monday. Members of the Class of 2004 are supposed to be the
first in California to prove their competence in the two subjects
before they can be awarded a high school diploma.</LD>
<LD>   They have two more years to pass the exam, but the results have
educators worried even at this early stage. Next year, the California
Board of Education is expected to review whether it is fair to stick
to the schedule or delay the requirement for a future class.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't want to eliminate this important tool, but we have to be
reasonable," said Marion Joseph, a member of the state Board of
Education. "[It's not] going to be acceptable if half the kids don't
pass."</TE>
<TE>   Rae Belisle, chief counsel to the state education board, agreed.
"I think it's pretty clear that if we don't get better performance,
there's a serious question about continuing the consequence for
2004," she said. "No one is going to sit there with half the kids
graduating from high school in 2004."</TE>
<TE>   Reed Hastings, the state board president, said that a low passage
rate could leave the exam open to legal challenges about its
fairness. A legally defensible goal would be a pass rate above 90% by
the end of a graduating class' senior year, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But he said it is too soon to predict whether the board will push
back on the timetable. "The data is worrisome for us getting above a
90% cumulative pass rate, but it's not definitive," he said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Most current 11th-graders first took the test voluntarily two
years ago. Those who passed both parts satisfied the graduation
requirement; those who failed either part--or both--had to retake the
test in 10th grade last spring.</TE>
<TE>   Over those two years, 48% of the Class of 2004 has passed both the
English and math sections of the test--which are geared between the
sixth- and 10th-grade levels in the material and knowledge. For
example, the math test includes algebra but not calculus.</TE>
<TE>   The results also show a wide achievement gap between affluent and
poor students, and between youngsters of different races.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly two-thirds of whites, and almost three-quarters of Asians,
have passed both tests over the two years, but less than one-third of
African Americans and Latinos have equaled that mark.</TE>
<TE>   Civil rights groups say the results reflect inequities in
California's schools.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at what resources poor students and students of
color have, it's abominable. Those need to be corrected," said John
Affeldt, managing attorney with Public Advocates Inc., a public
interest law firm in San Francisco that has filed a suit charging the
state with offering substandard education in poor neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "These students are not receiving the same level of teachers,
textbooks and facilities in which to learn. We have to provide them
the resources to succeed."</TE>
<TE>   The gulf between rich and poor was striking in some cases.</TE>
<TE>   Take the Oak Park Unified School District, which serves one of
Ventura County's most affluent pockets. There, 98% of current juniors
who took the exam last spring passed the English portion and 91%
passed the math portion. In working-class Oxnard, 35% of 11th-graders
who took the math test last spring passed, and 58% cleared the
language portion.</TE>
<TE>   Farther south, in the mammoth Los Angeles Unified School District,
which includes wide swaths of low-income areas, 45% of the students
who took the exam last spring passed English, and 21% passed math.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of our youngsters that are going though the system are
totally inadequately prepared for the 10th grade," L.A. Unified Supt.
Roy Romer said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Romer said, the low scores are an opportunity to address
the many challenges of large urban high schools that operate with
large class sizes, shortened calendars and other hurdles.</TE>
<TE>   This school year, the district launched a phonics-rich literacy
program for secondary students who read below the third-grade level.
Romer said the district also will offer a new course focusing on the
math and English standards tested on the exit exam.</TE>
<TE>   Holding up two new course booklets during a news conference, Romer
said that he would order principals to set up after-school, weekend
and intersession programs for students who are having trouble with
the exit exam.</TE>
<TE>   He also offered students an extra year at adult school, "a 13th
year" to work on English and math skills needed to pass the exam.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a system in which the culture has been to give [students]
a D and let them pass," he said. "We're going to change that, but
it's not going to change overnight."</TE>
<TE>   The high school exit exam is a key piece of Gov. Gray Davis'
testing and school accountability program.</TE>
<TE>   Starting next year, the results will be factored into the state's
annual school rankings.</TE>
<TE>   Educators say the tests have had a significant impact in schools,
forcing teachers to pay closer attention to California's new academic
standards while prompting students to get more serious about their
studies.</TE>
<TE>   Educators said the most prepared students took the exam
voluntarily in ninth grade, leaving less able students to try again
in 10th, 11th and 12th grade.</TE>
<TE>   "We've eliminated the 'quick studies' and are getting down to
those students who are English-learners or just need a lot more
help," said Mary Dalessi of the Anaheim Union High School District.
Dalessi said her district will try to counter that trend by providing
supplemental instruction.</TE>

<HD>Mickey Newbury, 62; Songwriter Left Imprint on Country
Music</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mickey Newbury, part of a wave of Texas musicians whose literate
songwriting helped change country music in the 1960s, has died. He
was 62.</LD>
<LD>   Newbury, best known for "An American Trilogy," his arrangement of
three Civil War-era tunes that Elvis Presley used to close his
concerts, died Sunday in Springfield, Ore., after struggling for
years with respiratory illness, his longtime manager, Robert
Rosemurgy, said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Newbury gained more recognition for the 500-plus songs that he
wrote than for his own performances of them.</LD>
<TE>   Besides Presley, the list of nearly 400 musicians who have
recorded Newbury's songs includes Ray Charles, B.B. King, Willie
Nelson, Linda Ronstadt, Keith Richards, Perry Como and Nick Cave.</TE>
<TE>   At one point in 1968, four Newbury songs simultaneously held the
No. 1 spot on the pop, country, R&amp;B and easy-listening charts. The
pop hit was "Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was
In)," the first charted single for Kenny Rogers, then with the First
Edition.</TE>
<TE>   But Newbury rarely crossed to the sunny side of the street, a
tendency he addressed in "Sunshine" from his 1973 album "Heaven Help
the Child": "Sunshine, you may find my window, but you won't find
me/Sunshine, I got my friend the darkness here tonight to hide me."</TE>
<TE>   It's not that Newbury was never happy, Rosemurgy said. "When
people would ask why he didn't write more happy songs, he'd tell
them, 'If I'm happy, I play golf; if I'm sad, I'll write a song.' "</TE>
<TE>   The way he expressed that sadness, in uncommonly erudite songs of
lonely people desperately seeking friendship, love or spiritual
salvation, won him the admiration of many of the music world's most
esteemed songwriters.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a great effect on my songwriting," Kris Kristofferson said
Monday. "The importance of the melody together with the words was the
first thing I picked up from him. It just blew me away, when he got
it just right, how simple lyrics and simple melodies worked in a way
to break your heart.</TE>
<TE>   "Just in the last few years I'd been on kind of a campaign hoping
to get someone to recognize him and give him his flowers while he's
living. He has a body of work that's really impressive."</TE>
<TE>   Kristofferson met Newbury in Nashville in the mid-1960s, when both
were eking out livings while trying to establish careers as
songwriters.</TE>
<TE>   Newbury had gravitated to Nashville after growing up in Houston,
where he had become enamored in his youth with the blues and R&amp;B he
heard on late-night radio broadcasts from stations in Chicago,
Memphis and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   He formed his first band, the Embers, while in high school and
toured with the Drifters, Clyde McPhatter and other R&amp;B performers,
often as the only white act on the bill.</TE>
<TE>   He also came under the spell of Beat Generation writers, including
Jack Kerouac, and began tapping that literary bent when writing song
lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   In the early '60s, the Nashville music establishment was difficult
for outsiders to crack, especially high-minded, literary ones. But
some of Newbury's songs had caught the attention of legendary country
music publisher-manager Wesley Rose.</TE>
<TE>   Newbury landed a contract with the Acuff-Rose publishing house in
1964, and got his first hit in 1967 when Don Gibson recorded his song
"Funny, Familiar, Forgotten Feelings."</TE>
<TE>   Once a few hits began to emerge in the late '60s, a raft of fellow
Texas musicians that also included Nelson, Waylon Jennings and Townes
Van Zandt started making inroads.</TE>
<TE>   Newbury got his own record deal with RCA, but he didn't dent the
charts until 1971, after he had switched labels twice.</TE>
<TE>   "Frisco Mabel Joy," the biggest seller of his career, reached No.
58 on the Billboard album chart. It included "An American Trilogy,"
which he created during a 1970 performance at the Bitter End West in
West Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time, there was a lot of civil rights activity and lot of
criticism of the song 'Dixie' as being racist," Rosemurgy said.
"Mickey's position was that there was nothing wrong with the song,
but it was always played in a marching tempo, so he decided to make a
ballad out of it.</TE>
<TE>   "The owner of the club asked him not to do it because it would be
controversial, but Mickey went on live and started to do it with that
very slow tempo. As he was singing it, he continued with the chorus
of the 'Battle Hymn of the Republic'.... He was just improvising, and
into his head popped the verse from 'All My Trials,' the Jamaican
slave song, and it was written live. The audience was stunned. They
sat quietly for a time, then broke into a spontaneous standing
ovation."</TE>
<TE>   After marrying in 1972, Newbury and his wife, Susan, moved to
Oregon, where her parents lived.</TE>
<TE>   Newbury stopped recording for most of the '80s and gave concerts
rarely. He released an album in 1988, and starting in 1994, he began
working to reissue his '60s and '70s albums in an eight-CD boxed set
that came out in 1998. He also wrote and recorded new songs. His most
recent album, "Winter Winds," was released in February, and he had
finished one more before his death, Rosemurgy said.</TE>
<TE>   Fans from around the world met with Newbury in 1999 and 2000 at
gatherings organized to let him mingle with listeners.</TE>
<TE>   "People came with stories," Rosemurgy said, "and some were really
compelling--like someone who had lost their only child and how his
music helped them get through. It was really special for an artist to
get that validation that his music had reached all these people. So
he did get the flowers while he was alive, and that was nice."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Newbury is survived by four children,
Christopher, Annaleah, Stephen and Laura; his mother, Mamie; and a
brother, Jerry. No funeral services or memorial have been set.</TE>

<HD>Valley Man Appreciates Waking Up in L.A.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES RICCI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a sense, Dick Healy has become a prisoner of his fellow Angelenos,
who, though famously restless and migratory, thirst for a warm,
familiar place.</LD>
<LD>   When Healy left the corporate banking business 15 years ago and
opened his custom coffee roasting business, he did not intend it to
become a coffeehouse where regulars drop in for a few sips of
neighborliness while anonymous traffic whizzes past on Ventura
Boulevard.</LD>
<LD>   For one thing, his narrow store, the Coffee Roaster, in Sherman
Oaks measures scarcely 500 square feet from the front door to the
sign on the back wall that reads, "We Wake Up the Valley." Bulky,
fibrous sacks of raw coffee beans and an ever-churning roaster occupy
the front of the place. Shelves of coffee-making paraphernalia and
bins of newly cooked beans line the walls. Room remains for only two
counter stools and one little table with a pair of chairs. Two more
tables are on the sidewalk in front.</LD>
<TE>   For another thing, serving coffee drinks, especially at prices 30%
to 40% lower than those at the Starbucks just down the street, is a
money loser. "It's just marketing," Healy says. "I didn't try to
foster it. I got forced into it. My business is selling pounds of
coffee."</TE>
<TE>   Each day, approximately 300 visitors sidle through the Coffee
Roaster. What they seek, beyond organically grown coffee from Sumatra
and La Minita hacienda in Costa Rica, is "community, that sense of
identity," the very same thing that has driven many residents of the
San Fernando Valley to conclude they must secede from Los Angeles and
form their own, more sociable city.</TE>
<TE>   Healy, however, is among those Valleyites who often go unmentioned
in all the easy talk from both pro- and anti-secessionists about how
Valley residents rarely venture "over the hill" to mainland Los
Angeles, and mainlanders seldom find reason or desire to travel in
the opposite direction. He loves living in the Valley, his home for
25 of his 64 years, but also relishes other parts of Los Angeles and
the feeling of being part of a big, variegated city.</TE>
<TE>   A father of three and grandfather of four, he is an L.A. Chamber
Orchestra season ticket-holder, and drives downtown to work out at
the L.A. Athletic Club three times a week. He dines weekly in the
Larchmont area and East L.A. He volunteers at the soup kitchen run by
St. James Episcopal Church in the Mid-Wilshire district.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike those who bewail the incoherence of Los Angeles, he finds
in the very amorphousness, vastness and near-chaotic diversity of the
city a specific civic character.</TE>
<TE>   "The point is, L.A. has it all," he says. "In New York, you just
sit on your stoop and the world comes to you. In L.A. you have to
define yourself, figure out what you want and then go find it--but
it's here. I love L.A. I love the city. I love the concept."</TE>
<TE>   The idea that the Valley is a separate social entity yearning for
political affirmation as a new city does not ring true for many
Valleyites, Healy maintains, particularly those who live in the
southern Valley within easy reach of the Santa Monica Mountains.
There, a person can almost feel the thrum of the Los Angeles Basin on
the other side.</TE>
<TE>   "The vast majority of my customers do not favor secession," he
says. "It's probably a socioeconomic thing. They tend to be
professionals or in the entertainment industry, people who are
connected with what's over the hill. Lots of people move to this part
of the Valley because they can't afford to live the same way on the
other side of the hill.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't even know how to get to Chatsworth, and I'm not being
facetious. I know it's over there somewhere. In terms of identity,
I'm closer to the Civic Center than I am to Northridge, and this"--he
sweeps his hand over the broad vista of Ventura Boulevard prosperity
outside his shop--"certainly doesn't look like the northeast Valley."</TE>
<TE>   None of which is to say Healy doesn't sympathize with many of the
secessionists' beefs, particularly those that relate to City Hall's
unresponsiveness to neighborhood needs.</TE>
<TE>   Council districts, for example, are so immense and have been so
gerrymandered over the years that no council member can adequately
represent them, he says.</TE>
<TE>   From Healy's perspective, though, the problem is not that city
government is too large, as some secessionists have maintained, but
that it's too small. More council members are needed, he says, and
smaller districts with more natural constituencies.</TE>
<TE>   He would also like to see a borough system installed to further
tighten city government's focus on neighborhood well-being while not
endangering "a city infrastructure that's been in the making for a
hundred years."</TE>
<TE>   The secessionist movement, Healy says, is really a search for more
socially connected self-hood, a magnified version of what is enacted
every day in his shop.</TE>
<TE>   "People in L.A., and not just in the Valley, are trying to find a
closer identity. I'm not sure a new city of the size being proposed
achieves the kind of efficiencies that the pro-secession people say
it will. But even if the Valley secedes and becomes its own city,
I'll still go down the Hollywood Freeway to L.A.. And it will still
be only 13 miles from here."</TE>

<HD>No Licenses for Illegal Immigrants</HD>
<DH>Bills: Davis vetoes measure despite vows of support, citing
national security, as he faces deadline for legislation in his first
term.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL and DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis vetoed hard-fought legislation Monday that would have
allowed illegal immigrants who are longtime residents to receive
driver's licenses.</LD>
<LD>   Davis had promised last year to sign such a measure and had worked
on a compromise for months, but said in his veto message that "the
tragedy of Sept. 11 made it abundantly clear that the driver's
license is more than just a license to drive; it is one of the
primary documents we use to identify ourselves."</LD>
<LD>   The action prompted a sharp rebuke from a lawmaker who had been
among his closest legislative allies. Assemblyman Gil Cedillo (D-Los
Angeles) called Davis' veto "another example of failed leadership"
and of "putting politics ahead of public safety."</LD>
<TE>   Facing a midnight deadline to decide the fate of the final batch
of bills for his first term, Davis also:</TE>
<TE>   *  Vetoed a measure that sought to prevent companies from shipping
possibly radioactive waste to local dumps.</TE>
<TE>   *  Vetoed a second measure opposed by Silicon Valley manufacturers
that would have added $10 to the cost of television sets and computer
monitors to pay for their disposal.</TE>
<TE>   *  Signed a bill aimed at lightening the load of students'
backpacks.</TE>
<TE>   Also falling to his veto pen were bills that could have raised
auto insurance rates for some drivers and given Indian tribes the
power to block development on land they deem sacred.</TE>
<TE>   Tribes, whose casino revenue makes them the biggest contributors
to politicians, claimed the bill would merely ensure long overdue
respect and protection to sites and objects sacred to American
Indians. Davis called the bill too broad, but went out of his way to
express reverence for Indian sites and directed his aides to work
with advocates on a compromise.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the bill, SB 1828 by Senate leader John Burton (D-San
Francisco), included builders, local government, and business groups.
They asserted the bill was so broad it would give tribes the power to
kill highway, school, housing and other necessary projects.</TE>
<TE>   In perhaps his most surprising action, Davis vetoed the driver's
license bills, measures that stirred such emotion that some advocates
went on hunger strikes demanding that he sign them. Davis' aides
spent long hours negotiating a compromise with Cedillo.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature approved Cedillo's original bill, AB 60, last
year. Not wanting to veto it outright at the time, Davis, who has
courted Latino voters, urged that the Legislature take the bill back,
and come up with a compromise.</TE>
<TE>   "It is just nothing but politics and not public policy," Cedillo
said. "Here is a man who calls me and gives me his word that we would
get it done.... What we see is that the governor only responds to
powerful interests, and he may believe that the Latino community
isn't powerful enough."</TE>
<TE>   For a time, it appeared as if a deal had been reached when law
enforcement officials, including Los Angeles Sheriff Lee Baca,
embraced Cedillo's original bill and its companion,  SB 804 by Sen.
Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles). The bills would have allowed illegal
immigrants to obtain licenses if they passed all driving tests,
underwent criminal background checks, were applying for legal
residency and could prove they were employed and had lived in
California for at least 15 months in the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   Cedillo's efforts were complicated by fears about security. Before
Sept. 11, 2001, 15 states were considering ways to grant driver's
licenses to illegal immigrants. Progress stalled after the terrorist
attacks, as it became clear that some of the terrorists had obtained
phony licenses.</TE>
<TE>   " Cedillo had been trying to win approval of the legislation since
he was first elected in 1998. People had told him of having their
cars impounded because they were caught driving without licenses. The
lawmaker contends that by making it impossible for nearly 1 million
illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses, state law creates a
class of uninsured and untrained drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Another action that stirred criticism was Davis' veto of the
radioactive dumping bill. The bill, SB 1970 by Sen. Gloria Romero
(D-Los Angeles), would have barred business from recycling low-grade
radioactive waste into consumer products or disposing of it in public
dumps and industrial landfills.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor's folks are intent on deregulating these
businesses," Romero said. "This was a big victory for corporate
America. But the big losers are men, women and children of
California."</TE>
<TE>   In his veto message, Davis said Romero rejected his suggestions
and sent him a bill that lacks "sound scientific basis." Davis said
the bill would have forced businesses, universities and medical
facilities to ship dirt and concrete that pose no health risk to
out-of-state disposal facilities at a cost of hundreds of millions of
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   As Davis vetoed the bill, administration officials announced a
moratorium on radioactive waste dumping in local landfills, even
though they said they doubt such dumping takes place. They also vowed
to begin work immediately on regulations governing such dumping at
more secure industrial landfills.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials said their actions Monday would help
protect public health while ensuring that important sectors of state
commerce, particularly the biotech and health care industries, could
continue to operate.</TE>
<TE>   With election day five weeks away, the issue took on a political
tone. Davis' Republican challenger, Bill Simon Jr., rebuked Davis for
battling a proposal to create a radioactive waste dump at Ward
Valley--"a dry, secure and distant location."</TE>
<TE>   Without Ward Valley, businesses have little recourse but to
dispose of such material in other landfills. Simon alleged that the
administration has been "caught allowing this waste to be dumped
right next to residential homes and schools."</TE>
<TE>   In other action, Davis signed legislation that could reduce the
weight of school children's backpacks. The bill, AB 2532 by
Assemblyman Rod Pacheco (R-Riverside), directs that the state Board
of Education establish maximum weight standards for school textbooks
by July 1, 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Given that school lockers are scarce at many public schools,
children must lug their books in packs that weigh up to 40 pounds.
Parents, students and some health experts have complained that the
weight is damaging their backs.</TE>
<TE>   "This will lighten their loads," Pacheco said. "Kids suffer back
and spine-related problems."</TE>
<TE>   The governor also signed a bill eliminating a 19-year-old
exemption from conflict of interest laws for information technology
contracts. The loophole was intended to give the state flexibility
when dealing with what was then a fledgling computer software
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also signed legislation related to:</TE>
<TE>   *  Banking, prohibiting Wal-Mart from acquiring a small industrial
bank in Orange County to process customer credit and debit card
payments. Several other retailers, labor unions and others opposed
Wal-Mart's attempt at getting into banking in California. AB 551 by
Assemblyman Lou Papan (D-Millbrae).</TE>
<TE>   *  Abandoned babies, requiring that students in sex education
classes be informed that state law permits parents to surrender
custody of a newborn at a hospital emergency room without facing
criminal penalties. AB 2817 by Assemblyman Ken Maddox (R-Garden
Grove).</TE>
<TE>   *  Rampart, allowing people who already have served their
sentences appeal to have their convictions overturned if they were
convicted with the use of false evidence. It applies to about two
dozen people convicted by testimony provided by officers enmeshed in
Rampart scandal. SB 1391 by Burton.</TE>
<TE>   *  Malpractice, requiring that the state Medical Board disclose on
its Web site instances in which physicians settled at least three
medical malpractice lawsuits of more than $30,000 within the last 10
years. The law is aimed at providing patients with the same lawsuit
settlement information available to medical groups, hospitals and
HMOs. SB 1950 by Sen. Liz Figueroa (D-Fremont).</TE>
<TE>   *  Conflict, imposing criminal penalties against consultants who
disclose inside information gained as they work for the state or the
California Independent System Operator, a quasi-state agency that
manages much of California's electrical transmission grid. The bill
came about because of allegations that Perot Systems Corp., which
helped create the Independent System Operator, tried to sell to
energy companies information about how to manipulate California's
electricity market. AB 2578 by Assemblyman Kevin Shelley (D-San
Francisco).</TE>
<TE>   *  Tenants, allows people to request inspections before they
vacate, have an opportunity to clean or make repairs to avoid having
money deducted from their deposit. The law also increases the
penalties for landlords who illegally withhold deposits. AB 2330 by
Assemblywoman Carole Migden (D-San Francisco).</TE>
<TE>   The governor vetoed several bills related to:</TE>
<TE>   *   E-waste. Davis rejected legislation to create a fund to pay
for the disposal of televisions and computer monitors. More than
10,000 televisions and computer monitors are discarded daily in
California. Each contains as much as five pounds of lead, a highly
toxic substance. Last year the state banned landfills from accepting
computer monitors and televisions, but there is no alternative for
disposal. SB 1523 by Sen. Byron Sher (D-Stanford).</TE>
<TE>   *  Insurance. At the request of Insurance Commissioner Harry Low,
Davis killed legislation that would have allowed automobile insurers
to offer discounts to customers who have continuously purchased
coverage. The measure, sponsored by Mercury Insurance Co., would have
required those ineligible for the discount to pay higher rates. SB
689 by Sen. Don Perata (D-Alameda).</TE>
<TE>   "Gov. Davis protected motorists against surcharges that would have
particularly penalized the poor and armed forces personnel now [in]
service overseas," said Harvey Rosenfield, a consumer activist.</TE>

<HD>2 Dead, 60 Hurt as Bus Driver Knifed</HD>
<DH>Crime: Police arrest passenger who caused Greyhound from
L.A. to roll over on Interstate 5.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At least two people were killed and up to 60 others were injured
Monday night after a passenger on a Greyhound bus out of Los Angeles
attacked the driver with a knife, causing the bus to overturn west of
Fresno, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   A man was arrested in a field of sagebrush near the scene of the
wreck that occurred just before 9 p.m. on Interstate 5 near the
Manning exit, said Fresno County Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt.
Jeff Johnson. The suspect has not been identified.</LD>
<LD>   "This was not an accident," Johnson said. "We do know there was
one attacker. There may be a possible second suspect involved, but
we're not sure yet."</LD>
<TE>   As many as 10 people suffered critical or serious injuries, and up
to 50 others had minor injuries, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The driver, Johnson said, "was attacked in the head and throat
area and was in serious or critical condition while they were
treating him at the scene."</TE>
<TE>   The bus full of passengers had left Los Angeles and was en route
to San Francisco, he said. The speed limit at the site is 70 mph, but
it wasn't immediately known how fast the bus was going when it
careened out of control and landed on its side.</TE>
<TE>   Emergency crews were flown to the scene of the crash, and the
injured were being taken to hospitals by helicopter and ambulance.</TE>
<TE>   David Boyd, director of emergency services at University Medical
Center in Fresno, said the bus driver was taken there in serious but
stable condition. Other patients were taken to hospitals in Coalinga,
Madera and Hanford.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty people were taken to a community center near the crash
site, where they were being interviewed by investigators.</TE>
<TE>   There was no word late Monday on what the motive might have been
for the attack or whether there were other vehicles involved.</TE>
<TE>   The bus came to rest in a remote portion of western Fresno County.
Interstate 5 was closed to northbound traffic by 10 p.m. at the site
of the accident along the heavily traveled north-south route. The
Fresno County Sheriff's Department was continuing its investigation
late Monday.</TE>

<HD>Cell Phones, Pagers Going Back to School</HD>
<DH>Education: A state ban is repealed, and districts are
reconsidering their blanket prohibition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL WILLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like cigarettes, switchblades and gang attire, cell phones were once
high on the list of items outlawed at California public schools.</LD>
<LD>   No more.</LD>
<LD>   School districts throughout the state now are clearing the way for
students to carry--and, in limited circumstances, even use--cell
phones or pagers on campus.</LD>
<TE>   The policy switch comes a month after Gov. Gray Davis signed
legislation allowing districts to permit the use of "electronic
signaling devices" at schools, rescinding a ban adopted in 1988 when
police and school officials feared that drug-dealing students were
using pagers in their trade.</TE>
<TE>   Today's proliferation of cell phones and their proven safety
benefits, illustrated during deadly shootings at high schools in
Littleton, Colo., and Santee, Calif., helped drive the policy change.</TE>
<TE>   Today, school board members in Irvine and Corona will consider
ending bans on cell phones and pagers, weighing common-sense benefits
against the disruptions teachers may face when the devices start to
ring and chirp in the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   "I really see the policy as one that allows students to use cell
phones when it is appropriate, especially before and after school,"
said Tony Ferruzzo, principal of Northwood High School in Irvine.
"It's also very important to parents, and allows them to keep in
touch with their kids."</TE>
<TE>   Many other school districts around the state, including those in
Los Angeles and Long Beach, are beginning to review the new law and
have not yet proposed policy changes.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal before the Irvine board would allow students to use
cell phones, pagers and two-way radios on campus during lunch, during
extracurricular activities, in an emergency or in any circumstance
under which a doctor determines the device is essential to the
student's health. At other times students would be required to turn
the devices off.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see what the big deal is; everyone already has them,"
said Chris Lavery, 17, a senior at Irvine High School, who pulled one
from a pocket of his baggy pants Monday during lunch. "When I'm at
school, I just put it on silent mode. My folks bought it for me. I
call them, and use it to call my friends after school."</TE>
<TE>   After a recent car accident, Lavery used his phone to call his
parents: "If I didn't have it, I'd have been in big trouble."</TE>
<TE>   State lawmakers banned cell phones and pagers when the devices
were still expensive and unusual, and when police felt they were
primarily used by students selling drugs. Since the 1999 shootings at
Columbine High School in Colorado, however, states have started to
revisit those blanket policies. In the past two years, Maryland and
Kentucky have repealed bans.</TE>
<TE>   "The world has changed; everybody has a cell phone," said state
Sen. Liz Figueroa (D-Fremont), who sponsored the legislation allowing
the devices on campuses. "There are number of situations where having
a cell phone has been a safety benefit."</TE>
<TE>   Figueroa said students and staff at Columbine used cell phones to
alert police and to contact their parents when they were trapped
inside the school during the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The senator said the "common sense" legislation was first proposed
to her by a leadership class at James Logan High School in Union
City.</TE>
<TE>   "They're already there.... It's something that a lot of districts
ignored and students ignored. Parents wanted their kids to have cell
phones to communicate before and after school," said Rick Pratt,
assistant executive director of the California School Boards Assn.,
which lobbied for the policy change.</TE>
<TE>   David Smoller, spokesman for the Capistrano Unified School
District, in southern Orange County, said the superintendent's staff
is proposing changes similar to those in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   In general, parents have strongly supported allowing cell phones
on campus, said Thomas Pike, assistant superintendent for student
services at the Corona-Norco Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   "There are the day-to-day issues of safety. Students can contact
their parents to let them know they have to stay late," Pike said.
"Allowing students to maintain contact with their families is an
important issue to be considered."</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are disadvantages. Along with the possibility that
phones may ring during class, students also can use text messaging
available on many cell phones and pagers to pass electronic notes in
class.</TE>
<TE>   "They do it right now, even though they're not even supposed to
have cell phones," said Naomi Terrazas, 17, a senior at Irvine High
School, who was using her cell phone to talk with her aunt after
class on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   School administrators realize that might be a problem, but said
they will handle that the same way they handle improper use of cell
phones now: They'll confiscate them.</TE>
<TE>   At Northwood High in Irvine, students caught using a cell phone or
pager on campus have it taken away, and it is returned at the end of
the day, along with a note parents must sign. If a student violates
the restriction a second time, the phone is confiscated and the
parent must pick it up.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, as far as a phone ringing on campus, it just doesn't
happen," said Ferruzzo, the principal.</TE>

<HD>State Ponders Delaying Exit Exams Due to Failures</HD>
<DH>Education: Only 48% of the Class of 2004 have passed the
English and math portions of test.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State officials are discussing whether to postpone enforcement of
California's new high school graduation exam because so many students
are failing the test.</LD>
<LD>   Less than half of the state's current 11th-graders have passed
both the English and math portions of the exam, according to results
released Monday. Members of the Class of 2004 are supposed to be the
first in California to prove their competence in the two subjects
before they can be awarded a high school diploma.</LD>
<LD>   They have two more years to pass the exam, but the results have
educators worried even at this early stage. Next year, the California
Board of Education is expected to review whether it is fair to stick
to the schedule or delay the requirement for a future class.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't want to eliminate this important tool, but we have to be
reasonable," said Marion Joseph, a member of the state Board of
Education. "[It's not] going to be acceptable if half the kids don't
pass."</TE>
<TE>   Rae Belisle, chief counsel to the state education board, agreed.
"I think it's pretty clear that if we don't get better performance,
there's a serious question about continuing the consequence for
2004," she said. "No one is going to sit there with half the kids
graduating from high school in 2004."</TE>
<TE>   Reed Hastings, the state board president, said that a low passage
rate could leave the exam open to legal challenges about its
fairness. A legally defensible goal would be a pass rate above 90% by
the end of a graduating class' senior year, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But he said it is too soon to predict whether the board will push
back on the timetable. "The data is worrisome for us getting above a
90% cumulative pass rate, but it's not definitive," he said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Most current 11th-graders first took the test voluntarily two
years ago. Those who passed both parts satisfied the graduation
requirement; those who failed either part--or both--had to retake the
test in 10th grade last spring.</TE>
<TE>   Over those two years, 48% of the Class of 2004 has passed both the
English and math sections of the test--which are geared between the
sixth- and 10th-grade levels in the material and knowledge. For
example, the math test includes algebra but not calculus.</TE>
<TE>   The results also show a wide achievement gap between affluent and
poor students, and between youngsters of different races.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly two-thirds of whites, and almost three-quarters of Asians,
have passed both tests over the two years, but less than one-third of
African Americans and Latinos have equaled that mark.</TE>
<TE>   Civil rights groups say the results reflect inequities in
California's schools.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at what resources poor students and students of
color have, it's abominable. Those need to be corrected," said John
Affeldt, managing attorney with Public Advocates Inc., a public
interest law firm in San Francisco that has filed a suit charging the
state with offering substandard education in poor neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "These students are not receiving the same level of teachers,
textbooks and facilities in which to learn. We have to provide them
the resources to succeed."</TE>
<TE>   The gulf between rich and poor was striking in some cases.</TE>
<TE>   Take the Oak Park Unified School District, which serves one of
Ventura County's most affluent pockets. There, 98% of current juniors
who took the exam last spring passed the English portion and 91%
passed the math portion. In working-class Oxnard, 35% of 11th-graders
who took the math test last spring passed, and 58% cleared the
language portion.</TE>
<TE>   Farther south, in the mammoth Los Angeles Unified School District,
which includes wide swaths of low-income areas, 45% of the students
who took the exam last spring passed English, and 21% passed math.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of our youngsters that are going though the system are
totally inadequately prepared for the 10th grade," L.A. Unified Supt.
Roy Romer said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Romer said, the low scores are an opportunity to address
the many challenges of large urban high schools that operate with
large class sizes, shortened calendars and other hurdles.</TE>
<TE>   This school year, the district launched a phonics-rich literacy
program for secondary students who read below the third-grade level.
Romer said the district also will offer a new course focusing on the
math and English standards tested on the exit exam.</TE>
<TE>   Holding up two new course booklets during a news conference, Romer
said that he would order principals to set up after-school, weekend
and intersession programs for students who are having trouble with
the exit exam.</TE>
<TE>   He also offered students an extra year at adult school, "a 13th
year" to work on English and math skills needed to pass the exam.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a system in which the culture has been to give [students]
a D and let them pass," he said. "We're going to change that, but
it's not going to change overnight."</TE>
<TE>   The high school exit exam is a key piece of Gov. Gray Davis'
testing and school accountability program.</TE>
<TE>   Starting next year, the results will be factored into the state's
annual school rankings.</TE>
<TE>   Educators say the tests have had a significant impact in schools,
forcing teachers to pay closer attention to California's new academic
standards while prompting students to get more serious about their
studies.</TE>
<TE>   Educators said the most prepared students took the exam
voluntarily in ninth grade, leaving less able students to try again
in 10th, 11th and 12th grade.</TE>
<TE>   "We've eliminated the 'quick studies' and are getting down to
those students who are English-learners or just need a lot more
help," said Mary Dalessi, testing coordinator in the Anaheim Union
High School District.</TE>
<TE>   Dalessi said her district will attempt to counter that trend by
providing more supplemental instruction, including a summer school
preparation course at each campus next year and a mandatory senior
year class for those who still haven't passed in two years.</TE>

<HD>Better Faithful Than Fickle, Crow Longtime Angels Fans</HD>
<DH>Sports: Today's playoff start is occasion for righteousness
and a little scorn by die-hards who know of dashed hopes.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>High above home plate at Edison International Field is Section 422,
where the true Angels fans sit.</LD>
<LD>   Not those front-row season ticket holders, whose bankrolled
companies shell out big money for prime seats. Or the
Johnny-come-latelies sporting their spankin' new red caps now that
the Angels are finally winning.</LD>
<LD>   No, these are the die-hards. Make that the long-suffering
die-hards. And now their time has come.</LD>
<TE>   "I sat here for soooo long in misery," lifelong Angels supporter
Dave Irvin, 24, of Fountain Valley said at Friday night's game
against Seattle, the first of three to mark the Angels' last home
stand of the regular 2002 season.</TE>
<TE>   "Every inning of every home game," bragged his uncle Jim Irvin,
47, of Lake Forest before Dave corrected him: "Every out of every
inning of every home game."</TE>
<TE>   Now, as they eagerly await today's playoff game against the
Yankees--the Angels' first postseason appearance in 16 years--they
feel superior to all those other fans, as if this team is part of
them.</TE>
<TE>   The newcomers are "all Laker fans; they're all Red Wing fans. Five
years ago, they were Michael Jordan and Chicago Bulls fans," scoffed
Dave Irvin.</TE>
<TE>   His uncle agreed. "You can just tell. They can't name five people
on the [team]."</TE>
<TE>   The fans in Section 422 take credit for the Rally Monkey. They say
they were the first to bring stuffed monkeys the day after his image
first popped up on JumboTron screen, inspiring a come-from-behind
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "How many fans can say they made their mark on the team?" Jim
Irvin asked. "We made our mark."</TE>
<TE>   The two dozen Section 422 faithful have formed an unlikely bond in
this most unlikely of places. Over the course of more than 10 years,
they've forged friendships--even an impending marriage--over their
devotion to the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   They celebrate birthdays and anniversaries. Off-season, they
gather for parties and holidays.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to love baseball," said Jerry Didion, 45, of Mission
Viejo. "And you have to love the people you're sitting with."</TE>
<TE>   They toss around words like dedication, commitment and
perseverance--characteristics of a real fan, they said. They list the
Angels' loss to the Boston Red Sox in the 1986 American League
championship series as one of the most heartbreaking moments in their
lives. In that game, the Angels were one strike away from the World
Series when Dave Henderson hit a home run off pitcher Donnie Moore.</TE>
<TE>   It was the last time the Angels made it to postseason play.</TE>
<TE>   Many of them can say with pride: "I was there." It is practically
a badge of honor they wear as they look around the newly packed
stands with a bittersweet feeling.</TE>
<TE>   What would be worse, said Didion's wife, Aimee, 45, is sitting in
a sold-out stadium with half the crowd rooting for the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   "If they stay fans, great," she said of the fair-weather crowds
around her Friday. "I love this."</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Rivas, 16, of Santa Ana is the kind of fan she means. He's
been cheering the Angels on for a whopping two months.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, since they started winning," Daniel explained. "Last year, I
liked the Yankees. I even bought the hat. I basically like whoever's
winning."</TE>
<TE>   Don't tell Section 422 old-timers--who still were trying to decide
Monday where to watch today's game--that the odds are stacked against
their team. Or that the Yankees have been to the playoffs every year
since 1995 and to the World Series four years in a row, while no
player in today's Angels starting lineup has ever played in the
postseason.</TE>
<TE>   That's another trait of true fans: They never stop believing.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they have a shot to win the World Series," Dave Irvin
said, discounting the team's late-season losing streak. "Every team
has got to go through that. Now we've got it out of our system. I
don't care if I'm down by 10. I think I'm still in the game."</TE>

<HD>Voters to Consider Signups at the Polls</HD>
<DH>Election: Registration plan, backers say, would increase
participation. Opponents fear fraud.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Californians this November will weigh one of the most significant
changes to state elections in years: whether to allow voters to walk
into a neighborhood polling place, register to vote and cast a ballot
all at once on election day.</LD>
<LD>   The brainchild of businessman Rob McKay, an heir to a Taco Bell
fortune, Proposition 52 would make California the seventh state to
allow same-day voter registration. Noting that voter participation in
California has been declining steadily for three decades, supporters
say the proposal is an overdue step to make voting more convenient.</LD>
<LD>   Opponents say it could open the way for widespread voter fraud.</LD>
<TE>   Turnout in California, which requires voters to be registered 15
days before an election, has ranked in the bottom six of the 50
states during the last two presidential elections.</TE>
<TE>   It hit a historic low in March, when only one-third of registered
voters--or one-fourth of those eligible to vote--cast ballots. By
contrast, in Minnesota, which has had election-day registration since
1973, 69% of the voting-age population cast ballots in 2000, the
highest turnout in the country.</TE>
<TE>   A recent study by political science professors at Caltech and MIT
found that, in states that allow people to register at the polls,
nearly nine out of 10 people of voting age were registered in 2000;
elsewhere, the average was three out of four. Two-thirds of the
voting-age public cast ballots in states with same-day registration
in 2000, compared with just half everywhere else.</TE>
<TE>   The study concluded that California voter participation could jump
by as much as 9% with election-day registration, because the state
has an exceptionally young and mobile electorate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just not acceptable in a democracy to have this unhealthy a
level of voter participation," said McKay, who describes himself as a
liberal and who helped bankroll San Francisco's living wage campaign
and the Los Angeles bus riders union. McKay sees his initiative as a
way to bolster civic participation. "If you vote, you are a heck of a
lot more likely to go to your kid's school board meeting."</TE>
<TE>   But opponents--who include California's top elections official,
Secretary of State Bill Jones--fear that the state's already strapped
poll workers would be over-burdened with the additional
responsibility of verifying the identifications of an unpredictable
number of newcomers. That, foes assert, could threaten the very
integrity of the state's elections.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want people writing about California what they are
writing about Florida," Jones said, although Florida, with widely
publicized polling difficulties in two recent elections, does not
have election-day registration. "If you are going to bring thousands
of new people to polling places who aren't registered to vote, you
are going to place a lot of pressure on those polling places."</TE>
<TE>   Who Benefits?</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally in California, efforts to boost voter turnout have
been widely presumed to benefit Democrats, and the California
Democratic Party is a supporter of election-day registration. But the
California Republican Party has not officially opposed the measure,
and GOP politicians have been careful to knock down any perception
that they are against increasing the voter rolls.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 52 is headed for a close vote, early polls suggest.
Here is how it would work:</TE>
<TE>   * People qualified to vote in California would be able to register
at their local precincts the day of an election, as long as they
could provide proof they lived in the area. Voters registered
elsewhere because they had lived in another part of the state could
also reregister on the spot, if they could prove their new place of
residence.</TE>
<TE>   For proof, a prospective voter would need to show only a current
California driver's license or a state identification card. Two other
forms of identification could be used as an alternative, from a list
including military IDs, property tax records, credit card bills,
income tax returns, student IDs or ordinary mail addressed to the
voter's new residence. People could even cast ballots without
identification if they obtained sworn written statements from people
who vouched for them in the presence of poll workers.</TE>
<TE>   * Every polling place in the state would have a separate area
dedicated to processing election-day registration, and at least one
precinct worker would be trained to do the ID checks. Ballots by
newly registered voters would be counted along with the rest, but
poll workers would prepare a list of them, and elections officials
would check the list against other records to make sure no one had
voted twice.</TE>
<TE>   * If election officials suspected someone of committing voter
fraud, they would have to submit a complaint to local prosecutors.
Violators would be subject to jail time and fines of as much as
$20,000. If two or more people engaged in a wider conspiracy, they
would face prison terms as long as five years.</TE>
<TE>   "For someone to engage in voting fraud, the downside is enormous"
under Proposition 52, said Dan Tokaji, chairman of California Common
Cause, a political watchdog group that endorsed the measure. "It will
be a great thing for California democracy. It will increase
registration and participation, especially among groups that have not
been a big part of the process: younger people and people of color."</TE>
<TE>   Though supporters note the ID requirement is stricter than is now
applied for registration and voting, opponents call it dangerously
flimsy. They worry that fraud would become prevalent--particularly in
small city and school board races where a few dozen votes can reverse
an outcome. And they contend election officials would be too
overwhelmed to catch fraud.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of us who think our current system is not secure
enough. This goes in the opposite direction and makes it worse," said
Assemblyman Ken Maddox (R-Garden Grove), co-chairman of the
opposition campaign. "The only thing needed to register on the day of
an election is a name and a few pieces of junk mail."</TE>
<TE>   California legislators, notably former Assembly Speaker Bob
Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks), tried in recent years to pass same-day
registration laws to stimulate the state's electorate. But the
efforts failed, amid opposition from election officials who predicted
disaster and campaign consultants who grumbled that election-day
registration would make it harder to determine who was likely to
vote, and thus, who should be targeted for political advertising.</TE>
<TE>   The unwillingness of state leaders to act led McKay to try to do
it himself.</TE>
<TE>   Though he grew up, amid great affluence, in a politically
conservative household in Palos Verdes, McKay, 38, has said he
developed liberal views and a passion for social justice. He has
decided to use his family's fast-food fortune to take same-day
registration directly to voters, he said, because he is convinced
that, over time, it would accomplish much more than just getting
people to the polls.</TE>
<TE>   McKay's father, Robert McKay Sr., was the architect who designed
the distinctive Spanish-style Taco Bell buildings for the franchise
founder, Glen Bell. The elder McKay later became Taco Bell's
president, and helped turn the small Southern California company into
a national chain. He then parlayed his taco profits into great wealth
with sagacious investments in a number of fledgling firms, including
U.S. Robotics.</TE>
<TE>   The McKay family is reportedly now worth several hundred million
dollars. The younger McKay serves as managing partner of McKay
Investment Group, its venture capital firm. But he is better known
for his philanthropy as director of the McKay Foundation, a San
Francisco organization that helped grass-roots groups in
South-Central Los Angeles begin to rebuild after the 1992 riots.</TE>
<TE>   Rich White Men</TE>
<TE>   It has become a California cliche for rich white men to step into
the political arena and spend millions on initiatives--often as a way
to publicize themselves and further their aspirations for statewide
office.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a vehicle for Rob McKay to introduce himself to the
voters," McKay said, adding that he would "most likely not" ever
become a candidate.</TE>
<TE>   McKay has spent $2 million to date on the initiative, and stated
matter-of-factly during an interview that he planned to spend at
least $3 million to $5 million more. He has assembled a campaign team
featuring leading Republican and Democratic lawyers and consultants,
and secured endorsements across the partisan divide, from former Los
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, a Republican, to former Democratic
Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa. Gov. Gray Davis has not taken
a position on the measure.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an act of patriotism for me, to support this," said Los
Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca. Opponents have also lined up a
bipartisan array of endorsements, weighted more heavy with local
elections officials and prosecutors, including Sacramento County
Dist. Atty. Jan Scully and Riverside County Registrar-Recorder
Michelle Townsend. But they have so far failed to raise money to
counter McKay, who is planning television advertising.</TE>
<TE>   McKay and others note that there is no evidence that election
fraud is more common in the states with election-day registration:
Minnesota, Idaho, Maine, New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Wyoming. They
also point out that, counter to claims that same-day registration
would bring out liberal Democrats, neither party has received an
advantage in those states.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Minnesota Secretary of State Mary Kiffmeyer described
her state's record with election-day registration as mixed. It has
undoubtedly led to higher turnouts: 18% of those who voted in the
1998 governor's race, which was won by former professional wrestler
and Reform Party candidate Jesse Ventura, registered on election day.
But she said it has also led to long lines and confusion at polling
places.</TE>
<TE>   She suspects it is also leading to more voter fraud, and plans to
focus soon on increasing safeguards to minimize the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "We do have documented cases of fraud in every county every year.
Convictions, however, are hard to come by," Kiffmeyer said. "You need
to have integrity with your access. It is just as important, and I
highly recommend that California be careful about maintaining its
integrity."</TE>

<HD>Broncos Dog It, Lose to Ravens</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Highlighted by McAlister's 108-yard
touchdown, Baltimore scores 31 points in dominant second quarter as
Denver loses its first game, 34-23.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK HEISLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Nice week for the Denver Broncos. First, their quarterback gets
knocked down the stairs by his dog. Then a bunch of Ravens fly over.</LD>
<LD>   In a Monday Night Nightmare they'll never forget, the Broncos fell
from the ranks of the unbeaten with a resounding splat as the winless
Baltimore Ravens, who had scored seven points in two games, dropped
31 on them by halftime and won, 34-23.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, the Broncos helped.</LD>
<TE>   First, they had a punt blocked that led to a 13-yard touchdown
drive.</TE>
<TE>   Then their defense blew its collective gasket, drawing five
penalties in six plays, worth 51 yards, helping the Ravens get close
enough for a 23-yard field goal. These included a pass interference
on cornerback Deltha O'Neal, an unsportsmanlike conduct for bumping
an official that got O'Neal ejected, a late hit by linebacker John
Mobley and a taunting penalty on lineman Trevor Pryce.</TE>
<TE>   Then, when they thought nothing else could go wrong, Coach Mike
Shanahan sent Jason Elam out to try a 57-yard field goal with one
second left in the half, saw it fall short ... and watched
Baltimore's Chris McAlister return it a record 108 yards for a
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "Well," said a taciturn Shanahan, "Baltimore came to play. They
did the job they needed to do. We got behind the eight-ball and
couldn't recover."</TE>
<TE>   The AFC West was a combined 12-2, with three of the four teams
(Broncos, Raiders and Chargers) unbeaten. This was supposed to be a
warmup for next week's big Charger-Bronco game.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, quarterback Brian Griese also had a tender ankle, which
he sustained, he said, in a fall down the stairs of his home, after
his golden retriever, Bella, knocked him off balance.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the Griese's dog story wasn't theoretically possible but
it was as if all of Denver went "Huh?" in unison.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe I'd have told that one," teammate Shannon Sharpe
said last week.</TE>
<TE>   "So, the dog stood up on his hind legs and gave him a push? OK.
You might want to get rid of that dog or put him in the circus, one
of the two."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Ravens had been more like an expansion team than
the one that won the 2001 Super Bowl and went 10-6 last season.
Salary cap problems forced them to break up their fearsome defense,
with only four starters (cornerback McAlister, linebackers Ray Lewis
and Peter Boulware and end Mike McCrary) left from the title team.</TE>
<TE>   Their offense was anything but fearsome but only four starters
remain from that championship unit.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis did his 60-second war dance Monday coming out of the tunnel
in pregame introductions, as usual--"I told the team just before we
came out to follow me, match my passion, match my energy," he
said--but let's face it, it worked better when he had better
teammates.</TE>
<TE>   But the Broncos started making mistakes and the Ravens started
making plays.</TE>
<TE>   With Denver up, 3-0, tight end Todd Heap, who had 256 yards
receiving in one-plus seasons, jumped over Bronco safety Kenoy
Kennedy to catch a 23-yard touchdown pass.</TE>
<TE>   Then Raven rookie safety Ed Reed burst through the middle of the
Bronco line to block Tom Rouen's punt, setting up a 13-yard drive for
a touchdown and 14-3 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Broncos took their five penalties, leading to a 23-yard
field goal, making it 17-3.</TE>
<TE>   Then Bronco fullback Mike Anderson juggled a pass and Lewis
snatched it for an interception at the Bronco 36. On the next play,
Heap outjumped another Bronco, linebacker Al Wilson, and hauled in a
33-yard pass at the three.</TE>
<TE>   Two plays later, Redman threw a fade to the 6-5 Heap, who
outjumped his third Bronco, safety Sam Brandon, for the touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Then, McAlister ran back Elam's missed field goal, taking it eight
yards deep in the end zone, hesitating as if he would stay there,
then finally coming out at the urging of Lewis who came back to help,
which he did with a crashing block that jackknifed Bronco Keith
Burns.</TE>
<TE>   So McAlister took off down the left sideline and didn't have to
stop until he reached the other end zone.</TE>
<TE>   The Broncos came out to play in the second half but that was one
half too late.</TE>
