<LD>A tearful, overwhelmed Halle Berry declared, "This moment is so much
bigger than me" when she became the first African American to win a
best actress Oscar. The triumph was not hers alone, she said, but
belonged to past and current black actresses who have struggled in
Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   More than three months later, Berry's words still ring true--but
in a way she likely did not anticipate.</LD>
<LD>   Caustic remarks by Angela Bassett in the July 1 issue of Newsweek,
in which she criticizes the sexual nature of Berry's Oscar-winning
role in "Monster's Ball" while subtly questioning Berry's choice in
taking on the part, has reignited a fierce debate inside and outside
the African American entertainment community about Berry and the
bittersweet significance of her victory.</LD>
<TE>   From the set of Showtime's urban drama "Soul Food" in Toronto, to
the tables of the Starbucks cafe in South-Central Los Angeles, quiet
discussions and heated arguments erupted last week surrounding
Bassett's remarks and Berry's portrayal of a downtrodden mother and
waitress who finds sexual release and romantic comfort in the arms of
a white prison guard who she is unaware has helped put her husband to
death in the electric chair.</TE>
<TE>   As for Bassett, the lightning rod for many African Americans
concerns that relationship, which is solidified by explicit sex
scenes between Berry and Billy Bob Thornton, whose character is
initially shown as a racist.</TE>
<TE>   Said Felicia D. Henderson, executive producer of "Soul Food":
"After all this time has past, so many want to stand up and applaud
Halle. But others say, 'Isn't it sad that she had to be the sexual
object of a white man? It shows that it's a man world, with sexism
and racism.' "</TE>
<TE>   Some performers have accused Newsweek and other media outlets of
attempting to spark a feud between two of the industry's top black
actresses. Vanessa Williams, one of the stars of "Soul Food," said,
"These sisters love each other. It's so annoying that the media would
make this into something divisive. Why would the media try to tear a
sister down?"</TE>
<TE>   But others attribute the discourse to the continuing uneasy, mixed
reactions of African Americans toward "Monster's Ball" that have
surrounded the film since its release late last year. The continuing
sensitivity over the role has cast an unexpected shadow over Berry's
accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been a no-win for Halle Berry," said Lee Bailey,
publisher and executive producer of the Electronic Urban Report, a
Web site linked to the "Radioscope" entertainment program. "She is
still getting flak from black folks. It's overwhelmed her historic
achievement. The role is still a source of irritation. And it's
wrong. There's a lot of hatin' going on."</TE>
<TE>   Producer-director Roy Campanella II said, "I felt Halle delivered
a brilliant, exceptionally fine performance. She deserved the honor.
Unfortunately, to have a discussion of 'Monster's Ball' is to look at
what it says about the racial psyche. And that's been associated with
her. She's not the issue. But she's becoming the issue."</TE>
<TE>   Campanella, who is developing an ABC movie on singing legend Lena
Horne, added that he felt the material in "Monster's Ball"
"associates a level of animalistic sexuality to black women in a
manner that could easily be seen as demeaning. I believe Angela has a
valid point."</TE>
<TE>   In the Newsweek interview, Bassett--one of the actresses Berry
praised in her Oscar acceptance speech--says she had turned down the
lead in "Monster's Ball" because she found the relationship between
the two characters demeaning.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't going to be a prostitute on film," she says. "I couldn't
do that because it's such a stereotype about black women and
sexuality." Although she emphasized she was not criticizing Berry,
she appeared to contradict herself in adding, "Film is forever. It's
about putting something out there you can be proud of 10 years later.
I mean, Meryl Streep won Oscars without all that."</TE>
<TE>   Later in the article, Bassett said she loved Berry's performance.
She also said, "I would love to have an Oscar. But it has to be for
something I can sleep with at night."</TE>
<TE>   Response was swift.</TE>
<TE>   Actress Vivica Fox said in an "Access Hollywood" interview last
week that Berry saw the role as an opportunity "to shine,"
acknowledging that all actresses may not agree with the choice:
"Don't be trippin' on Halle! Halle got it down! OK, don't hate!
Congratulate Halle!"</TE>
<TE>   Syndicated columnist Liz Smith said Bassett's comments came across
as "sour grapes." Cultural experts weighed in on talk shows such as
Tavis Smiley's program on National Public Radio. Bassett was accused
of being jealous of Berry because her career has not blossomed as
much as she anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   The issue provoked vibrant talk at community hangouts such as
Starbucks and Eso-Won Books in Baldwin Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Atwine, a mental-health worker and substance abuse
counselor, said while sipping coffee at Starbucks that some viewers
had difficulty with the explicit sex scenes: "People still have
difficulty seeing interracial relations on screen."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, he respected Berry's choice. "I respect her for the
person she is and how she's portrayed herself in the media and on
talk shows. She had a chance to read the script, so she knew what was
in it before she accepted it. It's her right to do the part, and I
have to love her for it."</TE>
<TE>   The furor closely mirrors the sentiment that broke out when Hattie
McDaniel became the first African American performer to win an Oscar
in 1940 for her portrayal as the O'Hara family's beloved Mammy in
"Gone With the Wind."</TE>
<TE>   Although her breakthrough was celebrated, McDaniel was also
criticized by the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored
People for the stereotyped role.</TE>
<TE>   Fueling the current debate is Bassett's contention that she turned
down the female lead in "Monster's Ball." Tom Ortenberg, president of
Lions Gate Films, which produced the movie, said Bassett was never
offered the role.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody was ever offered the role of Leticia except Halle Berry,"
he said. "Anyone who says anything to the contrary is misspeaking."</TE>
<TE>   For now, Berry is not responding to Bassett or anyone else about
the furor. "There is nothing I need to add to that," she said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesperson for Bassett on Friday said, "Angela supports Halle
1,000%, and her comments were about her choices and her preferences,
and not Halle's.''</TE>
<TE>   Still, the debate is likely to continue for a while. Malinda
Williams, another of the stars of "Soul Food," the only drama on
television to feature a predominantly black cast, said the continuing
dispute over Berry is because of all "the pent-up emotion" and
frustration built up during decades of African Americans being
overlooked for Oscars.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been building inside us for so long, and it's very
heated," she said. "This has forced us to say, 'How do we feel about
this? What choices do we have?' It's really created a dialogue. All
of us on the set have sat around talking about this, and we all have
differing opinions."</TE>
<TE>   She added that she felt too much attention had been focused on the
"Monster's Ball" sex scenes. "So Halle did a sex scene. What's so
shocking about that is beyond me. One person is more comfortable with
showing their sexuality than another. Things like this go on every
day.</TE>
<TE>   Nicole Gibson, another "Soul Food" star, called Berry's
performance "a stunning example of focus and drive. It should inspire
dialogue. And it should inspire action as well, for performers to put
energy into projects they are proud of."</TE>
<TE>   Ortenberg said what Bassett really illuminated was the lack of
great roles for women, particularly women of color.</TE>
<TE>   He said the discussion about Berry continues because "she played a
character with faults. Her character is very real, and her choices
hit close to home. It provokes a level of discomfort. Halle is to be
applauded [for] the fact that she made this role so much her own that
she can provoke that kind of passion."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, several observers have pointed out that while Berry
has been the subject of controversy, relatively little negative
attention has been leveled at Denzel Washington, who won a best actor
Oscar for his role as a corrupt, malicious cop in "Training Day."</TE>
<TE>   Washington was the first black performer to win the best actor
Oscar since Sidney Poitier won it in 1963.</TE>
<TE>   While Berry's character demonstrates grief, compassion and love,
Washington's character has few redeeming qualities. He murders a
friend, steals money, dabbles in narcotics, sets up his partner, has
an illegitimate child and terrorizes almost all who come into contact
with him.</TE>
<TE>   One customer at Eso Wan, David E. Fossett of Los Angeles, a
contestant coordinator for game shows, suggested those criticizing
Berry should take a harder look at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "Denzel's role was demeaning too, to African Americans and cops.
But men have it easier. We can get away with a lot. And Denzel, he
has such a reputation of being like a Sidney Poitier."</TE>
<TE>   Added Lee Bailey: "There's definitely a double standard. It
involves sexuality. Women can't engage in that without being whores
...</TE>
<TE>   "Halle is in a class by herself. She is an outrageously beautiful
woman who is getting over. People are jealous of that."</TE>
<TE>   Lorraine Toussaint, one of the stars of Lifetime's "Any Day Now,"
said she hoped the controversy and the furor over Bassett and Berry
would soon dissipate.</TE>
<TE>   "These are two of Hollywood's elite," said Toussaint, who is
joining the cast of NBC's "Crossing Jordan" this season. "We can't
afford to waste time and energy on this. My thought is that a step
forward by one is a step forward for all. To think anything else is a
waste of time."</TE>

<HD>2 Families Worth Knowing</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Howard Rosenberg</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ordinary Latinos spent years as one of U.S. television's invisible
minorities, as the Frito Bandito, van loads of illegal immigrants and
gangbanger stereotypes were passed off as a majority.</LD>
<LD>   But now it's 2002. ABC did brisk business recently with its
self-effacing, middle-class comedy "The George Lopez Show," and on
Wednesday nights, "American Family" and "Resurrection Blvd." are
making it a good summer for East Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   You know, the area where newscasters rarely venture except to
chronicle shootings and tykes smacking pinatas on Cinco de Mayo. Yes,
the same Latinodom that TV's entertainment crowd for years mentally
segregated behind yellow police tape and dismissed as a wasteland
inhabited by human graffiti unworthy of exposure to mainstream
America.</LD>
<TE>   Not that some Latinos don't match their stereotypes, as do some
blacks, Jews, Italians, Arabs, you name it. Stories of the vastly
more numerous Latinos were rarely told on TV, though.</TE>
<TE>   The industry had its priorities. It was Mafia yes, Morales no.
Networks that embraced coldblooded mobsters with thick tongues and
necks were terrified by commonplace Latinos living much like other
Americans. You say you want a series? Maybe manana.</TE>
<TE>   Only many years later did manana finally arrive.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, CBS rejected the first-rate pilot for filmmaker Greg
Nava's "American Family," starring Edward James Olmos as a Boyle
Heights barber and Korean War vet who is rigidly conservative. That
series is in reruns now, though, after recently ending its first
season on PBS as one of TV's highest-achieving dramas. And best-kept
secrets, unfortunately.</TE>
<TE>   Those petite ratings are a mystery, for its well-written
characters are appealing, its acting superior, its stories widely
applicable, its values universal while shaded realistically by ethnic
influences. It's rich and atmospheric, witty and a major tug on your
heartstrings, all with no trace of phoniness. Your loss if you're
missing it.</TE>
<TE>   Created by Dennis E. Leoni, ongoing "Resurrection Blvd." has
merit, too, as it enters its third season on Showtime, where it first
surfaced with the continuing African America series "Soul Food."
Credit Showtime for saying yes to "Resurrection Blvd.," and the
series for providing work for so many Latinos, on and off camera.</TE>
<TE>   "American Family" and "Resurrection Blvd." are both about large
East L.A.-based families that straddle two cultures while trying to
reconcile tradition with modernism. Each is headed by a high-minded
widower. Each has characters easy to like and respect. Family members
in each series enjoy success and are sent crashing back to earth by
failures and tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   On "Resurrection Blvd.," it's the Santiagos. Their stern patriarch
is gym owner Roberto (Tony Plana, finally freed from typecasting as a
villain) whose prizefighting tradition has rubbed off on his sons.
Carlos (Michael DeLorenzo) is middleweight champ. Miguel (Mauricio
Mendoza), a former boxer, now promotes fights. And kid brother Alex
(Nicholas Gonzalez) was robbed of the title through treachery.</TE>
<TE>   Lou Gossett has joined the cast this season as a mysterious
ex-convict and former champ who looks ominously like a low blow
waiting to happen. Not that the Santiagos are asking for more
problems, notably after last week's season opener.</TE>
<TE>   It began joyously with Roberto's daughter, Yolanda (Ruth Livier),
about to marry not another Latino, but white-bread Luke Bonner (Brian
A. Green). Recalling the family's initial resistance to the marriage,
he compared himself to Tony singing "Maria" in "West Side Story."
Great line.</TE>
<TE>   One moment Luke was assuring Alex that he adored Yolanda; however,
the next he was gunned down in a food mart robbery. End of Luke, end
of marriage, another instance of the cross-fire of violence--Carlos
became champ only after recovering from gunshot wounds--that
separates this series from "American Family."</TE>
<TE>   Yolanda is a USC law student, and Alex is again heading for a
career in medicine. Their younger sister, Victoria (Marisol Nichols),
has a snazzy boutique job on her resume, and their sexy Aunt Bibi
(Elizabeth Pena) holds solid as their surrogate mom. Yet
"Resurrection Blvd." is never quite able to shake the stereotype of
Latinos existing on the edge of mayhem. Time after time, life
clobbers this family the way Carlos pounds the heavy bag while
training. In this context, the show's signature shot of the downtown
skyline in the distance might as well be the Emerald City.</TE>
<TE>   Creatively, "American Family" lives in another neighborhood, from
its cinematic look and superior storytelling to the work of Olmos,
who's never been better than here, his raspy whisper resonating
uniquely, his great, cratered face a battlefield of emotions.</TE>
<TE>   Jess Gonzalez (Olmos) has two daughters. One is Nina (Constance
Marie), a lawyer whose work on behalf of immigrant rights outrages
her father ("Keeping illegal aliens in this country? You idiot!").
Another is Vangie (Rachel Ticotin), a fashion designer living in
Brentwood with her husband and kids.</TE>
<TE>   One of his three sons, Conrado (Kurt Caceres), is a doctor. Cisco
(A.J. Lamas), is a budding filmmaker. Estaban (Esai Morales) is a
former gang member on parole after taking the rap for his druggie
girlfriend, Laura (Seidy Lopez), with whom he has a son, Pablito
(Austin Marques).</TE>
<TE>   Estaban wants to get his life together. But that won't happen
easily, based on a tenderly directed episode that found his ballerina
girlfriend (Kate del Castillo) leaving him for New York, and his
rescue of heroin-addicted Laura from an overdose appearing to cost
him his freedom and son.</TE>
<TE>   Jess is visited regularly by his sister, Dora (Raquel Welch), and
visions of his beloved late wife, Berta (Sonia Braga). Those memories
induce crescendos of sentiment that come in waves, but never
gratuitously.</TE>
<TE>   It's another difference in the two series. The buttons pushed
manipulatively by "Resurrection Blvd." push themselves on "American
Family."</TE>
<TE>   As they did in an hour recalling the highs of Jess' marriage to
Berta, along with lows that included her learning from him that she
had an inoperable brain tumor.</TE>
<TE>   And as they did when "American Family" captured with acute clarity
America's screeching, abrupt U-turn after the terrorism of Sept. 11.
The episode began with high comedy, then abruptly went grim, as
America did, with the attacks on the twin towers. Seamlessly mingled
with that were Jess' memories of a bloody night in Korea as a GI,
when he barely survived in the snow after bundling off a tiny orphan
he hoped to save.</TE>
<TE>   In the freezing whiteness, he imagined Berta had come to comfort
him. It was poetic enough to stir anyone's deepest feelings. But
short-lived, for a comrade was cut down, and the child Jess fought so
hard to rescue died, too. No faux sugary endings here, or in the
Sept. 11 calamity whose coverage on the screen kept snapping Jess
back to the present.</TE>
<TE>   This was as good as anything on television this year, as "American
Family" waved Old Glory from East L.A., reminding those who'd
forgotten that patriotism comes in colors other than red, white and
blue.</TE>

<LD>`Nellyville' Is Poised to Upstage Eminem's `Show'</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Who's going to be king of the charts this week?</LD>
<TE>   On the album front, look for St. Louis rapper Nelly to unseat
Eminem after five weeks at No. 1. Sales of Nelly's "Nellyville,"
which was released last Tuesday, were outpacing those of Eminem's
"The Eminem Show" at a rate of about three to one at Tower Records
stores during its first week, says Tower Southwest region director
Bob Feterl.</TE>
<TE>   Retailers expect Nelly's first-week total to be in the 600,000 to
700,000 range when figures come in Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The initial single ['Hot in Herre'] has been getting huge
airplay, there's been lots of TV exposure for him and he's coming off
a huge record," says Feterl, referring to "Country Grammar," Nelly's
2000 album that has sold 7.8 million copies in the United States,
according to Nielsen SoundScan.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's a surprise to anyone how well it's doing,"
says Feterl, "but hopefully that will continue. I think it's too
early to say that [this year's overall sales slump] is turning
around, because they've been so poor for so long. But with Eminem and
now Nelly, it's a good first step."</TE>
<TE>   On the singles front, the King may reign once again. RCA Records
general manager Richard Sanders predicts that Elvis Presley's "A
Little Less Conversation" will be the top-selling single in the
nation, thanks to a new hip-hop remix by Dutch DJ JXL that received
widespread exposure in a Nike commercial shown during World Cup
games. It was released commercially in the U.S. last Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   These days, singles need sell only 4,000 or 5,000 copies some
weeks to top the singles sales chart. But if the Elvis single gets
enough radio airplay to put it atop Billboard's Hot 100 chart, which
measures both sales and radio airplay, it will create a dilemma for
RCA Records officials: Do they include it with a new single disc of
Presley's No. 1 hits modeled on the Beatles' massively successful "1"
album? The single has already hit No. 1 on the British charts, which
technically qualifies it for inclusion because the set, like the
Beatles "1," combines Presley's U.S. and U.K. chart-toppers.</TE>
<TE>   The obvious answer might seem to be "of course," but Sanders notes
that existing promotional and marketing materials for the album--due
this fall--have been created around the title "30 No. 1 Hits."
Additionally, those 30 tracks clock in at about 76 minutes, generally
considered the maximum for standard CDs. "We're exploring putting it
on as a bonus track," Sanders says.</TE>

<TE>   Thousands Expected at Anime Expo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The popularity of Japanese animation will be underscored this week
when an estimated 15,000 to 18,000 people are expected to attend the
four-day Anime Expo trade show that begins Thursday at the Long Beach
Convention Center.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the biggest venues in the nation for the industry
people to announce what their plans are for the year and to interact
with fans and learn what they are interested in," said Jennifer
Vancil, vice president for public relations of the Anaheim-based
Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation, a nonprofit
corporation that is sponsoring the 11th annual show.</TE>
<TE>   This year's show will include an appearance by Maria Kawamura, one
of Japan's most popular animation voice actresses.</TE>
<TE>   "When I talk to people about anime," Vancil said, "I try to
explain that it isn't a genre, it's a media, because you can find any
kind of story that has the label 'Japanimation' attached to
it--preschoolers to dramatic stories, the whole range. There is
something for everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Movies such as "Princess Mononoke" and "Pokemon" have popularized
anime in the U.S., although many Americans still view animation
largely as a children's genre because of Disney's dominance in the
field, Vancil said.</TE>
<TE>   In Japan, she explained, "animation doesn't carry the stigma that
it's only for kids. They have a lot of programming for adults, and
that includes action-style movie animation, dramatic style animation.
Just as we have action movies that are very violent, they also will
have action animation that is very violent."</TE>
<TE>   "Japanimation," as Vancil calls it, is usually edited down for
children for distribution in America, allowing it to become more
mainstream. She noted that the Cartoon Network averages four to six
hours a day of anime programming, including a new children's show
called "Hamtaro."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, she said, membership in her group has grown an average
of 28% to 33% in the 11 years since the trade show began. To attend
the four-day show, memberships are available at the door at a cost of
$20 for children and up to $50 for adults. For more information,

<HD>Hollywood's Bowl of Fame</HD>
<DH>Newman, Battle, Peters and Harrison are enshrined on an
enchanting evening of music.z</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The idea of a Hollywood Bowl Hall of Fame may have seemed to be yet
another excuse for a self-congratulatory awards show when it was
launched in 2000. But in retrospect, with talent ranging from Garth
Brooks and John Williams to Stevie Wonder, Marilyn Horne, Monty
Python's Eric Idle and John and Bonnie Raitt already inducted, it has
turned out to be a better than anticipated way to celebrate the
venue's impressive diversity.</LD>
<LD>   And as Friday night's third annual Hollywood Bowl Hall of Fame
event illustrated, it's also an excellent excuse to present a
crackling good evening of first-rate entertainment.</LD>
<LD>   With Randy Newman, Kathleen Battle, Bernadette Peters and the late
George Harrison as the 2002 inductees, and Esa-Pekka Salonen
conducting the Los Angeles Philharmonic, there was every reason to
expect that the quality level would be high.</LD>
<TE>   The essence of that quality was immediately established by the
arrival of soprano Battle--elegantly introduced by actor Anthony
Hopkins--singing a program clearly certifying her extraordinary vocal
mastery. Smoothly negotiating the intricate musical challenges of
Handel's "Let the Bright Seraphim," she shifted to a lyrical
rendering of "Summertime" enhanced by her ravishing tone and
concluded with the classic spiritual "He's Got the Whole World in His
Hands." Between numbers, Janet Jackson introduced a set of film clips
displaying brief views of Battle in action.</TE>
<TE>   Newman received a whimsical introduction from animation director
John Lasseter, who brought along a video clip of characters from the
film "Toy Story" praising the new inductee. Newman's capacity to be
simultaneously humorous, touching and ironic was present everywhere,
from the Coplandesque score for "The Natural" (performed gracefully
under his baton by the Philharmonic) to the fuzzy warmth of "You've
Got a Friend in Me" and the sardonic boosterism of "I Love L.A."</TE>
<TE>   The most touching portion of the evening was the Harrison tribute
and induction, handled by Monty Python's Eric Idle. Speaking with
great warmth about his close friend, Idle introduced a video clip
displaying Harrison in his many phases, from youthful Beatle to
mature solo artist. Climaxing the segment, singer-keyboardist Billy
Preston and a chorus of vocalists sang Harrison's "My Sweet Lord,"
without quite managing to capture the soaring soulfulness of
Harrison's original version.</TE>
<TE>   Peters was introduced by Joel Grey, who used the assignment as an
opportunity to offer an a cappella number of his own. When Peters
finally arrived, stalking the stage like a true Broadway diva, she
offered a somewhat mannered rendering of "Some Enchanted Evening" and
a bland reading of the bland Richard Rodgers song "Something Good."
She finally hit her full stride with "There Is Nothing Like a Dame,"
transforming the "South Pacific" guy's classic into a sleek and
sensual female anthem.</TE>
<TE>   The exceedingly full evening also included amusing passages by
humorist Fred Willard and actor Eric McCormack and a performance of
"Ode to Joy" by young musicians acknowledging the program's
dedication to the Philharmonic Assn.'s educational outreach program
"Music Matters."</TE>
<TE>   The festivities were bookended with performances by the
philharmonic and Salonen of segments from Prokofiev's "Romeo and
Juliet" Suites and the torrid final movement of Tchaikovsky's 4th
Symphony.</TE>

<HD>It's a Bountiful Summer</HD>
<DH>Season's crop of hits has had staying power</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD NATALE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If only the stock market was doing as well as the box office, the
economy would be back on track by now. The sizzling summer of 2002
continued its blazing run last weekend with the Adam Sandler comedy
"Mr. Deeds" premiering to a strong $37.6-million estimated opening,
continuing Sony Pictures' winning streak for the season.</LD>
<LD>   Once again the weekend was well ahead of the comparable period
last year, with the top 12 movies grossing an estimated $132 million,
12% better than the final weekend in June last year, when "A.I."
premiered to $29.3 million.</LD>
<LD>   Thus far the season (from May 2 to June 23) is running 27.5% ahead
of last year, according to Paul Dergarabedian, president of the
tracking firm Exhibitor Relations. Factoring in a 3.5% increase in
ticket sales over last year, that's still a 23% surge in attendance.</LD>
<TE>   The attendance increase is due primarily to two movies,
"Spider-Man," which has sold almost $396 million in tickets, and
"Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones," which has done an
estimated $286 million to date. "Spider-Man" is currently the fifth
highest grossing movie of all time and about to become the third
highest grossing movie in first release (Both "Star Wars" and "E.T."
have grossed more but added to their totals after being reissued).
Only "Titanic" and "The Phantom Menace" have done better in initial
release.</TE>
<TE>   Another key factor this summer is that the hit films are generally
playing stronger and longer, unlike last year, when spectacular first
weekend grosses were followed by drops of 50% or more in the second
weekend attesting primarily to how effective marketing is with
impressionable teens than overall audience satisfaction. But in
addition to youth-oriented movies this summer, there have been a
number of movies skewing to an older audiences, such as "Minority
Report," "The Sum of All Fears" and "Bourne Identity, " that have
demonstrated staying power.</TE>
<TE>   "In years' past exhibitors were nervous about releasing upscale
movies during competitive summer months," explains Warner Bros.
distribution head, Dan Fellman. "But hits like 'Sum,' 'Bourne,' and
our two movies, 'Insomnia' and 'Ya Ya Sisterhood,' show that
counterprogramming is working very well. In the future you probably
won't hear that complaint from adults: 'gee, there's nothing for me
to see' [in summer]."</TE>
<TE>   Success for Sandler</TE>
<TE>   The latest summer hit, "Mr. Deeds" represents a return to
prosperity for Sandler after the disastrous "Little Nicky," which
grossed only slightly more in its entire run than "Deeds" did its
first weekend--this despite poor reviews for "Deeds." The makeup of
the audience was broader than expected, according to Sony
distribution-marketing chief Jeff Blake. "Not only did we get the
teens, but because of the romantic comedy elements, we got young
adults and date night audiences as well."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the seesaw battle for box office dominance between
"Lilo &amp; Stitch" and "Minority Report" last weekend resumed with the
former inching ahead. "Minority" might have pulled in front for its
premiere, but the availability of kids all week long vaulted the
Disney animated film to first place for the entire week and kept it
aloft in its second weekend with an estimated $22.2 million (only a
37% drop) and almost $78 million in 10 days. With adults flocking to
theaters over the weekend, "Minority Report" came in just behind with
an expected $21.6 million (down 39%) and $73.4 million so far.</TE>
<TE>   The upcoming Fourth of July holiday weekend will mark the midway
point of the summer with fireworks expected when "Men in Black II"
premieres Wednesday. Also entering the fray are the animated
"Powerpuff Girls" and the live-action "Like Mike."</TE>
<TE>   The record opening weekend for "Spider-Man" ($114 million), had a
huge impact on the overall summer box office, noted Dergarabedian.
"It set up a situation where there were a lot of satisfied
moviegoers, and that momentum has carried through."</TE>
<TE>   Geoff Ammer, Sony's head of marketing explained, "That first week
in May has become the jump start for summer, and there is pressure to
deliver for the whole industry. When you plant your flag on that
date, you'd better have the goods. It's the only time even your
competitors are rooting for you." After a surprisingly strong
premiere, "Scooby-Doo" has been playing more like a film from last
summer, dropping off substantially from week to week. Third weekend
on "Scooby" was down another 50% to an estimated $12.2 million in
3,447 theaters and almost $124 million to date.</TE>
<TE>   Because "The Bourne Identity" and "Sum of All Fears" are playing
to an older audience, the attendance pattern has been more
consistent. "Bourne" was down only 28% its third weekend in 2,663
theaters for an estimated $10.8 million and $72.5 million to date.
"Sum" still has some life left in it, with $4.8 million predicted
over the past weekend in 2,486 movie houses and $105 million to date.</TE>
<TE>   There have also been a number of solid mid-range hits such as
"Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood" ($55 million in four weeks,
with about $4 million over the past three days), "The New Guy,"
(about $29 million to date), "Undercover Brother" (more than $37
million) and the independent hit "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" (almost
$20 million so far). Though they were a bit more expensive, films
such as "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron" ($70 million so far),
"Unfaithful" (about $52 million) and "Insomnia," ($64 million), have
also done substantial business.</TE>
<TE>   The only major disappointments were two poorly timed releases that
had been postponed in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks,
John Woo's war drama "Windtalkers" (about $33 million in three weeks)
and the Chris Rock-Anthony Hopkins action comedy "Bad Company"
(stalled in its fourth week at about $28 million).</TE>
<TE>   More to Come</TE>
<TE>   The remainder of the season looks to be a "roller coaster"
according to Dergarabedian. "Some weeks will be good, others
spectacular," he says. "The rest of the summer has movies with big
concepts and big stars as opposed to last summer when most of the
movies were concept-driven."</TE>
<TE>   Part two of the summer has a roster of talent that includes Tom
Hanks ("Road to Perdition"), Harrison Ford ("K:19: The Widowmaker"),
Mel Gibson ("Signs"), Mike Myers ("Austin Powers: Goldmember"), Eddie
Murphy ("The Adventures of Pluto Nash"), as well as a number or
concept driven titles like the action movies "XXX," "Eight Legged
Freaks," and "Reign of Fire," and several family titles including
"Stuart Little 2," "Spy Kids 2" and "The Country Bears."</TE>
<TE>   Dergarabedian is comfortable predicting a $3.6-billion final tally
for the summer, and it could go higher if all the expected hits live
up to their potential and one or two surprises emerge.</TE>
<TE>   With about $4.5 billion in tickets sold, the industry is looking
at its first $9 billion year ever.</TE>

<HD>Pink Performs With Arena Aspirations</HD>
<DH>In a high-energy show recalling early (and uneven) Madonna,
her rebel rock and R&amp;B dance tunes go over big with an eclectic
crowd.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NATALIE NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pink decided to "Get the Party Started" right off the bat Friday,
launching her Wiltern Theatre performance on an upbeat,
outta-your-seat note with that hip-gyrating hit from her
multimillion-selling sophomore collection, "Missundaztood."</LD>
<LD>   The rising young singer was justifiably pumped up as her first
headlining tour neared its end. (She also played the venue on
Saturday.) After all, the 22-year-old Pennsylvanian achieved her
success by following her own rebel-dreamer instincts rather than
being shaped by her record company--as she has said was the case with
her hit 2000 debut, "Can't Take Me Home."</LD>
<LD>   She disliked being lumped with teen-poppers, but that didn't keep
her from joining in last year's ubiquitous remake of Patti LaBelle's
"Lady Marmalade" with junior divas Christina Aguilera, Mya and Lil'
Kim.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, the Wiltern audience included gaggles of tween girls and
their good-natured chaperons, but gay couples and assorted hipsters
were a significant presence among those who got their pink on,
sporting hair, sunglasses, halters, T-shirts, ribbons, backpacks,
pants and more in the hue of the pop-rocker's name.</TE>
<TE>   All apparently were united in their affection for Pink's blend of
I-just-gotta-be-me heartland rock, R&amp;B-flavored dance numbers and
anthems of inner turmoil. The diversity was reminiscent of an early
Madonna concert. And the grinning, bouncy Pink displayed some of the
Material Girl's blond ambition as well.</TE>
<TE>   The 90-minute set felt like an arena tour in training, complete
with costume changes, a sponsor plug, a 30-second guest solo by
ex-Guns 'N Roses guitarist Slash and a stage flanked by ramps and
staircases.</TE>
<TE>   Video presentations lent extra weight to such bombastic triteness
as "My Vietnam," a ballad that clumsily equates growing up today with
the deadlier travails of her veteran father's generation.</TE>
<TE>   A blend of Pink's own songs and outside material provided
cross-generational appeal while revealing the breadth and depth of
her pop inspirations. Her racially and gender-mixed quintet nimbly
slipped from crunchy rock to swinging soul-pop, and Pink's voice
adeptly handled the mid-tempo anthem "Don't Let Me Get Me," the
jangly, R&amp;B-flavored "Missundaztood" and the resilient rocker "18
Wheeler."</TE>
<TE>   Her strident-to-histrionic medley of such Janis Joplin numbers as
"Me and Bobby McGee" and "Piece of My Heart" was ill-advised, but
Pink's enthusiasm for honoring her influences provided a sweet moment
to former 4 Non Blondes leader Linda Perry, a key collaborator on
"Missundaztood," who was cheered mightily when she joined Pink for
"Lonely Girl." Pink's instincts have certainly proved fruitful. But
although her playful sexuality and need to twist things up was often
refreshing and fun, occasionally her impulses were misguided--notably
a segment in which she ended a flirtatious moment with a female
dancer by slapping the woman to the floor.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt she thought she was underscoring some point, or maybe
being ironic, or possibly it was a joke. But, really, for all of
Eminem's misogynistic bluster, could even he get away with doing
something like that on stage in 2002?</TE>
<TE>   Oh, well. Madonna had her questionable moments with the
naughty-girl antics too, and it certainly didn't hurt her in the long
run. So why shouldn't Pink be allowed a few missteps on her way to
the top?</TE>

<HD>Forceful Footwork Drives Noche Flamenca</HD>
<DH>Ensemble offers a balance between passionate expression and
controlled display of technique.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Forget storytelling, scenery-chewing, corps dancing and pop-star
glamour. Noche Flamenca is a company that focuses on the essence of
this antique Andalusian Gypsy art.</LD>
<LD>   Over the weekend, in the 250-seat Founders Hall at the Orange
County Performing Arts Center, Martin Santangelo's 9-year-old,
Madrid-based ensemble emerged from darkness and continually defied it
in solos and duets of vehement self-assertion and deep integrity.</LD>
<LD>   There was no emotional overkill: Even in the most flamboyant
outbursts of song or dance, the tension between personal expression
and technical display led to startling changes of attack, as if the
performers suddenly felt they had revealed too much and retreated to
the safety zone of virtuosity.</LD>
<TE>   Thus the sensuality and need in a duet for Noe Barroso and
Alejandra Zaballos reached a flashpoint several times Thursday. But
the dancers always abandoned this closeness for a mocking,
confrontational style that relied on matched-step combinations
without risking passion.</TE>
<TE>   A sense of inner truths, cautiously guarded but ultimately
irrepressible, dominated a severe, haunting solo by Soledad Barrio.
Wearing a simple dress and shawl that made her torso look block-like,
Barrio established powerful contrasts between her weighty, forceful
footwork and the bare arms that kept curling toward the light,
pulling her upward.</TE>
<TE>   No easy Spanish elegance here and no glorification of suffering.
Instead, Barrio's lunging turns, gutsy lashing of her skirt and
backbends that looked forced from her at gunpoint depicted a woman of
fierce self-possession momentarily overwhelmed by her feelings but
determined to master them. Like the Barroso/Zaballos duet, her solo
remained deliberately unresolved--an installment in an ongoing life
cycle. Similarly, Barroso's duet with Bruno Argenta teemed with
dramatic implications, but never quite became a challenge. Instead,
the men sustained a wary, isolated standoff, letting audience
imagination take the relationship to its next phase.</TE>
<TE>   More conventionally finished solos came from Elena Martin and
Argenta, both interacting with singer Manuel Gago as if he held some
mysterious power over them. Martin performed a showpiece with a cane:
a kind of third leg that sometimes accented the rhythms of her
dancing but elsewhere defined high-velocity counter-rhythms. Three
men with canes added to the percussive intricacy of the solo but
Martin kept the total effect grounded in her taut concentration.</TE>
<TE>   Argenta proved unforgettably unpredictable, building some passages
out of rapid changes of stance rather than steps, but elsewhere
launching brief flurries of spectacular footwork ornamented with
ballet turns. Only at the end did he offer sustained high-speed
steps, and even here air turns provided the final exclamation point.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the intimacy of the venue, Noche Flamenco didn't perform
unplugged--the guitars and singing remained overamplified, leaving
the refined guitar duet for Miguel Perez Garcia and Jesus Torres (who
also composed the company's original music) harsh in tone. Sung
without any translation or summary in the house program, Gago's solo
wrenched periodic long-held cries of anguish from him, but reached
its peak in the accelerating, rhythmic rapport with Garcia near the
end.</TE>
<TE>   The admirable skill and taste of Noche Flamenca would make the
company an ideal introduction to an art that is often abused and
distorted on world stages. But Founders Hall doesn't provide ideal
sightlines: The audience sits on three sides of a platform stage, and
although many rows in the side sections are raised, much of the
center section isn't, and offers only an obstructed view of the
dancing.</TE>

<LD>If this noisy summer of box office braggadocio proves anything, it's
the durability of the moviegoing experience, a phenomenon that has
outlasted and transformed itself through every prediction of its
demise from TV to pay-per-view.</LD>
<LD>   After falling since its World War II-era heyday, American movie
spending during the last 18 months has hit some of its highest levels
in generations. Clearly, some of the growth is the result of
ever-rising ticket prices and movie release tactics that saturate the
marketplace to inflate opening-weekend box-office numbers.</LD>
<LD>   But in other respects, the boom appears to be living up to its own
hype, reflecting a true resurgence in an American pastime, despite
the proliferation of other entertainment choices.</LD>
<TE>   Movies aren't just surviving, they're also thriving:</TE>
<TE>   * Movie ticket sales in 2001 reached their highest total in 40
years. Box-office receipts for 2002 are running about 20% higher,
with $4 billion spent since January, according to Exhibitor Relations
Co. Inc., a box-office tracking firm.</TE>
<TE>   * Blockbusters are climbing the charts: "Spider-Man" has become
one of the 10 biggest-grossing films of all time, and "Star Wars:
Episode II Attack of the Clones" should reach the $300-million mark
soon. More potential blockbusters lie in wait: "Men in Black II,"
"Austin Powers in Goldmember" and "XXX" open this summer, and "Harry
Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" and "The Lord of the Rings: The
Two Towers" are due at year's end.</TE>
<TE>   * High-grossing movies have been premiering almost weekly,
beginning with "The Scorpion King" ($36.2 million) in April and
continuing with "Spider-Man" ($114 million), "Scooby-Doo" ($56.4
million) and two studios claiming the top spot for the weekend of
June 21 ("Lilo &amp; Stitch" and "Minority Report," each with grosses of
more than $30 million.)</TE>
<TE>   * Four of the 10 top-grossing films of all time have been released
in the last four years.</TE>
<TE>   "The numbers really are astronomical," said John Fithian,
president of the National Assn. of Theater Owners. "We're seeing
increased moviegoing across age demographics and across social
demographics."</TE>
<TE>   A combination of factors continues to raise movie attendance:
saturation releases, the proliferation of multiplexes, the release of
a variety of films that appeal to different age groups and genders,
and more marketing than ever before.</TE>
<TE>   In 1946, movies lured 46% of the American public every week.
Today, it's 14%. Still, movies continue to draw while other mass
entertainments have stagnated or declined. Attendance has dropped
this season at major league baseball, NFL and NBA games. Prime time
television audiences for major networks continue to fall as cable
channels proliferate. In pop music, sales of blank CDs outstripped
sales of recorded music for the first time last year.</TE>
<TE>   Why do Americans still go to movies when it's so easy to dial up a
pay-per-view feature? "We're drawn to the 'electronic campfire,' "
says Roderick Nash, professor emeritus of history at UC Santa
Barbara. "We can rent movies and watch TV, but we still feel the need
to gather together as groups around some object of interest."</TE>
<TE>   It's also about storytelling, says Michael Marsden, a provost at
Eastern Kentucky University and an editor of the Journal of Popular
Film and Television. Bring on the stories, even if they are sequels.
"Repetition is not a sin. We like repetition with a variance that
becomes the point of interest for us in the storytelling process," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   So audiences continue to gather at the movies, especially drawn to
spaces that have captured some of the flash, the neon, the sense of
occasion of the grand movie palaces of the 1930s and '40s. Those
grand movie palaces made it acceptable for people of all classes to
go to the movies, Marsden said.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent weekend at the Irvine Spectrum, "Star Wars" was
showing 23 times a day. So Ryan Huttenberger, 17, of Lake Forest met
his friends there, knowing there would be plenty to do while waiting
for his film in an entertainment mall filled with restaurants, ice
cream shops, video-game parlors and other teens.</TE>
<TE>   "It might be an hour wait, but here, there's stuff to do," said
Huttenberger. "Stuff" includes checking out "the scene" and "the
honeys."</TE>
<TE>   Lea Deakin of Oceanside turns out for movies about half a dozen
times a year and only for event movies or special-effects movies.</TE>
<TE>   "The vibe, the energy of opening nights of certain movies: There's
something about opening night. The crowd's into it," Deakin said.</TE>
<TE>   They're into it because they've bought into the hype. According to
the Motion Picture Assn. of America, production expenses decreased in
2001 while marketing budgets increased. On average, studios spent
$78.1 million on a film ($47.7 million for production and $31.01
million for marketing.)</TE>
<TE>   But receipts made it all worthwhile, MPAA Chairman Jack Valenti
said in his address on the industry's financial health in March 2002
at ShoWest, a convention of exhibitors, studio representatives and
concession vendors. With more than $8 billion in receipts, 2001 was
the "greatest box-office year in film history," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Big-budget movies don't get made unless they're marketable, said
producer Tom Pollock, a partner at the Montecito Picture Co. and
former head of Universal Studios. "Sometimes the movies are really
good, and sometimes the movies are not very good, but they're still
marketable," Pollock noted.</TE>
<TE>   When a studio can market a movie and convince the public it's an
"event," people feel compelled to go. Tom Sherak, a partner at
Revolution Studios and former head of distribution at Fox, said event
movies that deliver lift attendance sky-high.</TE>
<TE>   "If 'Spider-Man' wasn't a good movie, with all the marketing in
the world it would have been an event to open, but it wouldn't have
stayed an event," Sherak said.</TE>
<TE>   Studio marketing departments are widening the net demographically.
They're not interested in just attracting males in their teens and
20s, they're after the whole family.</TE>
<TE>   A quick spin through the 10 top-grossing domestic films of all
time reveals only G through PG-13 ratings. "Titanic," "Star Wars" and
"E.T." inhabit the top spots; further down the list are "Harry
Potter" and "The Lion King."</TE>
<TE>   Candi McDaniel of Villa Park takes her children to the movies
year-round but more frequently during the summer, often returning to
a movie if one of the children wasn't able to go on a previous trip.
"It's an outing. It's different than being at home," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Taking the kids to the movies remains relatively cheap, at least
compared with some other entertainment options. In the last decade,
ticket prices have increased 34%, and still the median price per
ticket across the nation for last year was $5.66. Four movie tickets,
at $5.66 each, cost $22.64. Four lower-priced seats for a weekend
performance of "The Lion King" cost $128.</TE>
<TE>   Four of the lowest-priced tickets to a Laker game cost $64, but
that's not the total cost of the evening. According to Team Marketing
Report, a family of four spends an average of $145 to $300 at a live
sports event.</TE>
<TE>   Movie admissions approaching $10 take a bite out of a
17-year-old's allowance. But Huttenberger says it just forces him to
be choosier. "It makes you judge if it's worth the money."</TE>
<TE>   Fithian thinks that better movie houses have contributed to the
boom. In the last seven or eight years, theater owners have gone
through the biggest building and remodeling phase of their history,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The recent bankruptcy reorganization of some theater chains helped
owners shed older properties.</TE>
<TE>   "Most movie theater companies have upgraded with innovations like
stadium seating and digital sound systems," Fithian said.</TE>
<TE>   With movies playing more often, in nicer theaters, is there a
limit?</TE>
<TE>   "We've always said, 'Can it expand?' And now it seems to be
happening," said Sherak. "When you see a $200-million weekend in May,
if the pictures in June live up to it and July and August live up to
it, you're looking at a business [in which] not only box office will
be up, but admissions and attendance will be up."</TE>

<LD>In the increasingly competitive concert market, it's tempting to try
to be bigger than your rivals. But as the biggest rock acts, from U2
to Bruce Springsteen, have learned, less sometimes is more.</LD>
<LD>   Insomniac Promotions, the organizer of Saturday's Electric Daisy
Carnival, seems to have learned that lesson. Held at Long Beach's
picturesque Queen Mary Events Park, the all-day, no-frills show was
remarkably free of the pomp that threatened the L.A. festival scene
last year.</LD>
<LD>   This year's model still featured carnival rides, a glittery
fashion show on the main stage and more than 30 DJs, but the vibe
among the estimated 6,200 attendees was decidedly chill.</LD>
<TE>   The main attraction was BT, who spun in the sun at 6 p.m. Though
he resists being called a DJ, he looked a lot like one onstage as he
engaged the appreciative crowd with heavy showmanship and a mix that
drew liberally from his albums.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor, who preceded BT on the main stage, got the crowd pumped
with a set that utilized old-school techno beats with great success.</TE>
<TE>   On the outer stages, Philadelphia's King Britt, with a genial
house set that had just the right mood for the afternoon, and Jason
Blakemore, whose set was well divided between the futuristic sounds
of progressive music and quirkier dance beats, provided some of the
highlights.</TE>
<TE>   As is often the case at festivals, though, the real stars were the
organizers, who by scaling back set a high standard for the rest of
the summer rave scene.</TE>

<HD>May, Versatile Studio Guitarist, Takes Spotlight</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They're the unsung heroes of the music world, the so-called studio
musicians who can shift genres, chameleon-like, fulfilling any
musical requirement with ease and flair. Like the dancers in Broadway
musicals, they have spent years mastering their craft, only to spend
most of their time playing supportive backup roles.</LD>
<LD>   Saturday night at Spazio in Sherman Oaks, guitarist Tim May, who
has played for everyone from Frank Sinatra and Lionel Richie to
Celine Dion and Arturo Sandoval, took advantage of the opportunity to
step into the spotlight, leading his own quartet. As it turned out,
May's most significant accomplishment for the evening was the
inclusion of several other versatile musical artists in his
group--trumpeter-fluegelhornist Warren Luening, bassist Dave
Carpenter and drummer Bob Zimmitti. Although the selections--mostly
chosen spontaneously or played on the spot from written music--were
generally familiar items, Luening and Carpenter, in particular, are
always worth hearing.</LD>
<LD>   Sticking with the darker-toned fluegelhorn for most of the
numbers, Luening was especially impressive in an up-tempo romp
through "I'll Remember April." Spinning out breathtakingly long
lines, searching for--and almost always finding--appealing melodic
content in his improvisations, his laid-back but inventive playing
was one of the high points of the set.</LD>
<TE>   Carpenter, a versatile player who seems as content with lyrical
balladry as he is with hard-driving funk and edgy envelope-stretching
music, provided a number of equally splendid musical moments. On "Old
Man's Bass," he took advantage of May's funk-based line to launch
into a solo balancing swing, virtuosity and invention. Despite the
program's high points, however, the synchronization between May,
Zimmitti and Carpenter often slipped apart, not exactly what one
might expect from players accustomed to every imaginable musical
setting. May's single string solo lines were surprisingly awkward
sounding, occasionally slipping away almost completely from the
rhythmic time of Zimmitti and Carpenter.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, his work on an untitled ballad was far superior, as
was the solid backing he provided on "All the Things You Are." These
caveats aside, it was a distinct pleasure to hear and see gifted
background players.</TE>

<HD>PBS Offers Retooled 'Wall Street Week'</HD>

<LD>"Wall Street Week With Fortune" has finally made its initial public
offering, but as with most of the market's IPOs these days, there
isn't much to get excited about. Unlike the dregs of the dot-com IPO
days, however, it's no disaster.</LD>
<LD>   The timing was right as the successor to "Wall Street Week With
Louis Rukeyser" premiered Friday night, unveiling hosts Geoff Colvin
and Karen Gibbs. Amid a wave of scandal, the stock market finished
its worst first half year in three decades, so there was plenty to
talk about with guests Robert Rubin, the former Treasury secretary,
and portfolio managers James Chanos and James Barrow.</LD>
<LD>   Colvin and Gibbs know their stuff but face a tricky task following
the affable Rukeyser, who split with PBS in April after 32 years and
joined CNBC, where he now does a competing program.</LD>
<TE>   Maryland Public Television, which produces "Wall Street Week" with
new partner Fortune magazine, struck a balance in revamping the show:
The pace has been quickened in a bid to reach a younger crowd, but
only from second to third gear so as not to unnerve longtime fans.
The format still features opening remarks, a main guest and a
round-table talk. At one point Colvin sounded like vintage, bullish
Rukeyser when he advised viewers to take the long view: "Bail out of
stocks? No way."</TE>
<TE>   Colvin, the editorial director of Fortune, and Gibbs, a Fox News
and CNBC alum, have a promising chemistry: He's nerdy, she's smooth.
They kept Friday's discussion lively but at times seemed to pull
punches.</TE>
<TE>   Colvin hinted at a debate with Gibbs that never came: Despite
Enron, Tyco, etc., she thinks most of corporate America is on the
up-and-up; he fears a rise of the down-and-dirty.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin easily brushed off a Colvin hardball: Can anyone trust
analysts from brokerages such as Salomon Smith Barney (a unit of
Rubin's employer, Citigroup) amid all the talk about conflicts of
interest in the industry? Rubin called it a "manageable conflict,"
and Colvin moved on.</TE>
<TE>   Though Rubin was the star guest, Chanos--known for smelling the
Enron rat well before the rest of Wall Street and cashing in on the
stock's fall by selling shares "short"--offered the sharpest insights
into the crisis plaguing U.S. markets. He noted that none of the
frauds now making headlines was detected by outside auditors, and in
a poke at a current short-sale target, he said Yahoo's stock option
costs last year, "buried in the footnotes" of financial statements
per U.S. accounting standards, exceeded the company's revenue.</TE>
<TE>   If the new "Wall Street Week" is hardly a radical remake, that can
be taken as reassuring. Unlike Wall Street itself, it never needed
major reform.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Wall Street Week With Fortune" airs Fridays at 8:30 p.m. on KCET
and Saturdays at 6 p.m. on KOCE.</TE>

<HD>'You I Them': Program in Search of Thematic Unity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With more than three dozen guests joining 15 company members, Adam
Parson's strongly performed "You I Them" program, Friday at the El
Portal Theater, served less as an introduction to his new Commonality
Dance Company than a pop dance extravaganza covering all possible
bases.</LD>
<LD>   For instance, two different hip-hop crews, a tap group and a
couple of modern dancers dropped in, performing non-Parson
choreographies that sometimes outclassed Parson's own segments. For
its edge, detail and parodistic wit, nothing Friday beat Selatin
Kera's contribution to the "Versions" sequence, and Gregg Russell's
comic oh-so-tired tap quintet slumped its way to glory as well.</LD>
<LD>   Parson can efficiently string together familiar step-combinations,
deftly sustain a style and use his sense of humor to freshen stale
commercial formats. However, he often exposes the technical
limitations of his dancers by throwing steps at them that they can't
smoothly execute, and he badly needs to develop his sense of
structure.</LD>
<TE>   His "Conference" finale, with separate groups alternating and then
merging to India-style rhythm-syllables, had exactly the purposeful
organization that his work otherwise lacked, though his most serious
miscalculation on Friday turned out to be combining clenched
pantomime with over-the-top showpiece dancing in the hollow "My Arms"
dance drama. In format, the individual dances supposedly answered 17
questions about life--everything from "Have You Ever Met Someone
Whose Spirit You Can Actually Feel?" (a solo for the majestic Mecca
Andrews) to "Who Actually Wins in War?" (martial arts moves for seven
scowling guys in sci-fi uniforms).</TE>
<TE>   Much of the time, however, the questions seemed afterthoughts,
attempts to lend thematic unity to a self-promotional showcase. But
the unity needed to be onstage, not just in the program booklet, and
the fine dancers assembled for the project might have been better
served by greater creative risk.</TE>
<TE>   Among the soloists, Val Halon gave maximum impact to everything
Parson assigned her, and Dominic Chaiduang brought warmth and charm
to the "Different Corner" solo. Masako Ehara and Mark Meismer also
appeared prominently--but, alas, in pieces that tended to diminish
them. Besides Parson and the choreographer guests previously
mentioned, Mandy Moore, Jayson Wright, Cindera Che and Keith Clifton
contributed segments to the program.</TE>

<HD>Cheerleaders and Butoh Dance Create an Offbeat 'Pupplica'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICTORIA LOOSELEAF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not often one encounters a trio of balladeering cheerleaders,
the severity of butoh dancing and guitar licks worthy of Jerry Garcia
in one performance.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, it would be rarer still for such a bizarre blend to work.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, "Pupplica," a 70-minute opus presented by the
performance-art collective known as Isle of Pines and accompanied by
the musical group BartMule, although tinged with occasional elements
of beauty and depth, crumpled under a meandering veil of artifice at
Highways Performance Space on Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   The series of disconnected monologues ostensibly dealt with what
the program notes called the "ruins of excess, family narratives and
archetypes of consumption." The text was written by Isle of Pines
member Arnie Saiki and narrated by BartMule guitarist Daniel Bess.</TE>
<TE>   Ably danced by Sherwood Chen, Boaz Barkan and Robert Scott (the
other Isle of Piners), the plethora of crouching would have done
director Ang Lee proud.</TE>
<TE>   When not in the throes of butoh--silent screams, backbends and
gnarled finger gestures--the dancers made use of Saiki-created
puppets as they shared the journey of Straw Hat Man, a character
embodying the spirit of labor, while responding to subjects that
veered wildly from teacup reflections and malls to--gulp--revolution.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, between the rah-rahs and cartwheels of a cheerleading
squad--Kelly LaPlante, Diana Larios and Carlos Mora--there may have
been some meaning to "Pupplica's" manifesto; instead, one felt like a
voyeur at a sock hop in an insane asylum.</TE>
<TE>   BartMule, composed of Bess (who also played guitar), Kirstin Ashe
on vocals and marimba, Peter Nelson on drums, Roger Park on bass, and
Saiki on guitar and vocals, offered a bevy of well played but benign
tunes about best friends, parents and ennui, the accent, alas, on the
llast.</TE>

<HD>Latest 'Mystery' a Change of Pace</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT SANDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to deduce that "Mystery!" has
changed.</LD>
<LD>   PBS has moved the 22-year-old series from its regular Thursday
night slot to Mondays, repositioned it as limited summer programming
and made plans to air "Mystery!'s" first American production in
November. And although this season's first installment, "Forgotten,"
is indubitably British, it doesn't much resemble the adventures of
Holmes and Dr. Watson, Brother Cadfael or Inspector Morse.</LD>
<LD>   "Forgotten" is not so much a traditional whodunit as it is a
psychological thriller, in three parts, the first of which airs
tonight at 9 on KCET and KVCR. You know it is going to be different
from its stiff-upper-lip predecessors early on, when Ben Turner (Paul
McGann) and his lovely wife Natalie (Zara Turner) engage in some
passionate snogging. Rather than a period piece, it is set in the
late 1990s, in the rolling countryside of the Cotswolds, in the
quaint village of Brompton-on-the-Water.</LD>
<TE>   During a festival, young Katie Longden disappears, only to be
found strangled with a jump rope. Chief Inspector Paris (Kathryn
Howden)--who speaks with a lilt reminiscent of Mrs. Doubtfire and,
though younger, resembles her a wee bit too--takes on the case.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, to assume that "Forgotten" closely follows Paris'
investigation, as many other mysteries might, would be a
miscalculation. Instead, the series focuses on Ben, who,
coincidentally or not, served a prison sentence for the strangulation
of a young girl with a jump rope 20 years prior. He's since faked his
own death, changed his name and built an idyllic life with the wife
and daughter (Karis Copp) he adores.</TE>
<TE>   Yet he cannot escape his past, as embodied by Rachel Monroe
(Amanda Burton), mother of the first child killed. Rachel checks in
to the Turners' B&amp;B, demanding, with a fervor bordering on psychosis,
that Ben tell her where her daughter's body is buried.</TE>
<TE>   "Forgotten" is full of twists and turns, but it ends rather
inelegantly. Here's hoping that in two seasons' time, "Mystery!"
won't meet the same fate, due to lack of funding.</TE>

<HD>Ignoring True Story Doomed 'Windtalkers'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH R. VALENZUELA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reviewing the box office return of "Windtalkers," which has been
characterized as "another disappointment for MGM" (" 'Scooby-Doo'
Fetches Biggest June Debut," by Richard Natale, June 17), confirms
that audiences are not as stupid as Hollywood thinks.</LD>
<LD>   "Windtalkers" is an overblown, bloated excuse for a two-hour
explosion. Though purportedly the story of the Navajo "code talkers,"
in fact the real purpose of "Windtalkers" was clearly to create a
vehicle for yet more white male stars. The fact that "Windtalkers" is
a box office disappointment is no surprise, as it is a movie steeped
in insincerity and butchering of the truth.</LD>
<LD>   My father, Edward Valenzuela, was raised on the Papago Reservation
in Tucson, Ariz., and was a decorated World War II veteran. Of
Mexican and Native American descent, he epitomized patriotism and
American values. He told me of the Navajo young men who went from the
reservation to the front lines of the Pacific theater to provide
communication assistance during World War II.</LD>
<TE>   This story intrigued me, and I met with the head of the Navajo
Code Talkers Assn., Sam Billison, in 1999 to pursue research and
investigation for a screenplay on the code talkers. What was so
striking from interviewing Billison and other code talkers was their
ultimate patriotism for a country that had relegated them to a
reservation yet relied on their expertise to prevail in World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Billison's story tells the richness of what makes America the
country it is today--a combination of people from different
ethnicities, different backgrounds and different religions, combining
their energies to create a single great nation.</TE>
<TE>   Upon completing my script--which centered on the lives of three
teenagers who left the reservation, joined the code talkers and
served in the military with as much patriotism and honor as any other
soldier--I began shopping it around town. At the same time, a similar
story was being promoted by producers, who had the interest of John
Woo as a director, which became "Windtalkers."</TE>
<TE>   I learned about the "Windtalkers" project and spoke with one of
its producers, explaining that I would be happy to share the research
and interviews I had gathered while writing my script, with no
request that I be given any credit. I said I would sign any release
to ensure that I would never sue the producers or the studio for any
type of copyright infringements.</TE>
<TE>   The response I got was, essentially, that America wants to watch
adult male stars, and since my movie would concern the issues
surrounding three Native American youth, it would not attract a box
office return.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the producer advised me that their take on "Windtalkers"
would concern the stress and turmoil surrounding the conflict the
white soldiers would have when facing the prospect of having to shoot
a code talker rather than allow him to be captured. In the end, the
false take on the Navajo code talkers--focusing on the two white male
leads and ignoring the essence of the true story--has shown itself in
the box office flop the movie has become. The American audience,
diverse in its thinking and its taste, will no longer accept such
"Hollywood myths."</TE>
<TE>   The lesson for MGM, and any other studio that is looking to create
positive box office return, is that "Windtalkers" is compelling
evidence that promoting the white male as the focal point is not the
way to tell every story.</TE>

<HD>Looking for Hip From Outside the In Crowd</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I've decided that an element of my cultural education that is
severely lacking is being able to determine what's in and what's out.
Listening to friends who are masters of hip, I began to feel a woeful
lack of insight into those places in L.A. preferred by the young and
the restless, as it were.</LD>
<LD>   Since so many conversations revolve around restaurants, I chose
this as a starting point. To hear my friends talk, food and sex are
the primary concerns of the Today Generation, and I felt I ought to
have a little more expertise in one or the other.</LD>
<LD>   When I mentioned this to my wife, she said, "It had better be
food," and so it is.</LD>
<TE>   I'm not including nightclubs that may or may not be in because I
know nothing about the places where you pop happy pills and dance
your panties off to unbearable noises they call music.</TE>
<TE>   When I came to town 30 years ago, restaurants were as scarce as
IQs over 100. There were Chasen's, Scandia, Perino's, Big Boy and the
Tick Tock Cafe. Now there are restaurants around every corner, some
out and some in and some in and out, and books by the hundreds that
list and rate them.</TE>
<TE>   I don't actually know what kind of food is in, but was told it's
steak and sushi. I realize that's a strange combination of health and
death, but there's no explaining it. Well, maybe there is, up to a
point. An in place must be reasonably new, have decent food, a young
chef, beautiful customers and remain in business for at least three
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   And, oh yes, it must be noisier than a hog farm.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent night, for instance, I was pleased to dine at one of
the newer in restaurants, called Katana. It's an upstairs sushi place
on Sunset Boulevard that embraces all of the qualities required of
being in.</TE>
<TE>   If you are older than 26 and weigh more than Calista Flockhart,
however, forget about Katana. You don't belong there if you're too
fat to expose your navel. I am over 26, weigh about two Flockharts
and won't show my navel under any circumstance, but it's not good
business to toss a newspaper columnist into the street. So I got in.</TE>
<TE>   I realized instantly that this was an in place because (1) it was
jammed with the aforementioned young, skinny, beautiful hip people
and (2) the noise approached the sound level of a departing 747.
Adding to it as we entered the dining area was the sudden burst of
shouting by a number of attendants at the sushi bar.</TE>
<TE>   It is meant as a form of greeting, but could well be mistaken for
the sudden appearance of Britney Spears at a stag party. Each time
someone entered, they shouted and I jumped. It was, as you can
imagine, a nervous evening for me.</TE>
<TE>   Loud noises are a condition of our culture. They simultaneously
define fun and blast away the haunting unpleasantries that might
otherwise fill our minds. Women don't laugh, they scream. Men don't
talk, they bellow. Conversation is barely possible under these
conditions. I have only a vague notion of what was said. The food was
fine, but at 110 decibels, I couldn't hear myself eat.</TE>
<TE>   Mastro's is the steak house we visited. The same beautiful, skinny
people who ate sushi at Katana eat red meat at Mastro's, but they're
older and not nearly as noisy, decibel-wise; not a departing jet or
artillery fire at close range, but the first balcony at the L.A.
Philharmonic. I can take that.</TE>
<TE>   Mastro's has a small, downstairs "convenience" bar for those who
stumble in off the hard, lonely streets of Beverly Hills and need an
instant martini. Seated at the bar in plain sight of the front
doorway as we entered were two women who were doubles for all of the
other beautiful women who inhabit the in places. There's got to be a
factory somewhere that clones the type and sells or rents them to the
in places for the few weeks that they remain in.</TE>
<TE>   There's a downstairs dining area for people with noise aversions
and an upstairs bar/dining room for those conditioned to conversing
in smiles and gestures. The women here are grown-up versions of the
Katana babes who now either run major corporations or are with rich,
old men who run corporations. No flashing navels here, just a kind of
sexy dignity that goes along with being able to afford a $39 steak.</TE>
<TE>   Over a period of weeks I found myself at restaurants called Jar,
Nic's, Lucques, Alex, JiRaffe and some others I no longer recall.
They were in at one time or another, but may no longer be regarded as
such. As far as I know, the restaurants I like have never been in,
but that's just as well. Les Sanglier, Mirabelle and the Grill on the
Alley tend to attract people with taste who are not necessarily
skinny or beautiful, just tired of the ins and outs of the in
restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   But you've heard all this from a guy who loves hot dogs and
meatloaf, so don't take my word for it. I've been known to frequent
places that advertise "Eats," and even Spam appeals to me under
certain conditions. Sauteed, of course.</TE>

<LD>LOVE, WAR, AND CIRCUSES:  The Age-Old Relationship Between Elephants
and Humans, By Eric Scigliano, Houghton Mifflin Co., 358 pages, $25</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Civilization, we all know, has been the severest threat to
wildlife. But need it always be so? In the final episode of his
inspiring television series, "Civilization," the British art
historian Sir Kenneth Clark, having guided his audience through
centuries of painting, sculpture, literature and music, reminded
viewers that humans will also be judged by how well we treat other
species: "our sisters and brothers," as he charmingly called them.</LD>
<TE>   It is not only that kindness and decency are the hallmarks of the
truly civilized person, but also that other species which inhabit
this planet are (like Mayan temples, Impressionist art, Beethoven
symphonies, Shakespearean plays) creations worth cherishing.</TE>
<TE>   But being human and being humane are not always the same. Although
we pride ourselves on our capacity for foresight, too often we are
seduced by short-term goals. The relationship between humans and
elephants, as examined by Eric Scigliano in "Love, War, and
Circuses," provides a sobering but not entirely discouraging glimpse
not so much into elephants as into us.</TE>
<TE>   Where Shana Alexander's "The Astonishing Elephant" offered
information about everything from elephant sex organs to digestive
tracts, Scigliano's chief interest is in what humans have made of
elephants. This includes the use of elephants in war, literature and
religion, the slaughter of elephants for ivory, the Asian tradition
of elephant handling, elephants in circuses and zoos, a bizarre
scheme to revive North America's Ice Age mammoths via frozen DNA, and
the underreported but impressive efforts of conservationists in
India, Sri Lanka and Burma to preserve elephants and their
environment. Because there have been so many books on the African
elephant, Scigliano, who first saw them as a boy in Vietnam, devotes
more attention to its smaller cousin, the Asian elephant.</TE>
<TE>   Although not as closely related to humans as the great apes,
elephants (like cetaceans and bears) are curiously more appealing to
most of us. Stately and dignified in mien, they seem to exude wisdom
and benevolence.</TE>
<TE>   Immensely powerful, they are also capable of great gentleness and
delicacy. And yes, Scigliano confirms, they have long memories. Not
only do they remember friends and hold grudges, they've been known to
pick up a paintbrush and express themselves artistically.</TE>
<TE>   And they have critical taste, too, judging by a story Scigliano
recounts of an elephant ballet choreographed by George Balanchine
with music by Igor Stravinsky. Although the elephants danced nicely
to waltzes and marches, they reportedly "flapped their ears in pain
at the Stravinsky music."</TE>
<TE>   How the elephant became the Republican Party mascot is another of
the many tales recounted in this book. (It began with a political
cartoon by Thomas Nast in 1874.) Adlai Stevenson noted the aptness of
the identification: "a thick skin, a head full of ivory, and as
everyone who has seen a circus parade knows, proceeds best by
grasping the tail of its predecessor."</TE>
<TE>   But life with humans has been more work than play. In Asia, for
about 4,000 years, elephants have been used to drag heavy loads.
(Scigliano describes how they are still instrumental in harvesting
teakwood.)</TE>
<TE>   Over and above this utilitarian role, the Asian elephant figures
prominently in Hindu and Buddhist lore. Visiting Sri Lanka, Scigliano
notes political campaign ads by the United Nationalist Party, which
has made the big beast its symbol: "The Elephant ... is strong enough
even to haul a nation out of a rut. Place your trust in the Elephant.
He will never let you down." Although some elephants have been caught
in the cross-fire of this nation's strife between Buddhists and
Hindus, Scigliano reports that both sides have tried to avoid harming
them. Cash crop agriculture, alas, poses a greater danger, as farmers
force the foraging behemoths off their land.</TE>
<TE>   As human population continues to spiral exponentially, will zoos
be the only places where future generations encounter them? Some
zookeepers are pouring much effort and money into breeding and
raising elephants in captivity. Scigliano makes a case that this
would be better spent helping conservationists in places such as
Burma, India, Sri Lanka and Africa who are working to save the
elephants.</TE>
<TE>   "Love, War, and Circuses" is crammed with fascinating material on
everything from natural history to religion, but it lacks a central
organizing principle and a cohesive narrative. But there's so much to
be said about this gargantuan creature and the role that man and
beast have played in each other's histories, it is difficult to tie
it all up into one neat bundle.</TE>

<HD>Commandments for the Unfaithful</HD>
<DH>A 'guide to infidelity' spells out some rules for carrying
on affairs</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARNELL JAMESON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walk into most any bookstore and you'll find scores of books on
etiquette. Social etiquette. Wedding etiquette. Etiquette for kids.
But the etiquette of having an affair?</LD>
<LD>   "The reality is affairs are wrong and immoral, but if nearly half
of all married people end up having an affair, shouldn't someone be
out there telling them how to do it right?" asks Judith Brandt, who
has written "The 50-Mile Rule: Your Guide to Infidelity and
Extramarital Etiquette" (Ten Speed Press).</LD>
<LD>   Certainly, one little dalliance gone wrong can ruin everything.
(If the film "Unfaithful" doesn't convince you, watch Michael Douglas
squirm in "Fatal Attraction.") But an affair done well, argues
Brandt, can be "the spice of life."</LD>
<TE>   Judicious journalism requires us to point out that adultery has
been a no-no since Moses came down the mount with those rules carved
in stone. But beyond the biblical imperatives and the fact that
adultery is illegal in 27 states, extramarital affairs break hearts,
wreck homes, cost a bundle (not just in hotels and restaurants, but
later in legal fees and alimony), and leave you vulnerable to disease
and blackmail. That said, we can responsibly move on.</TE>
<TE>   "A successful affair is one that enhances your life without
disturbing it," says Brandt, who works by day as a marketing
executive for National Lampoon magazine and writes under a pseudonym
to maintain her privacy. To help those inclined to stray to play it
safe, or at least safer, Brandt's book, which given her magazine
employment one might think is a parody, is quite serious. She posits
her 20 rules for affairs, which she's gleaned from private
confessions and personal experience. (While not currently "involved,"
Brandt--who's in her mid-40s, has no children, and lives in South
Pasadena with her ex-husband, which shows you how complicated
relationships can get--has been the other woman in affairs with
married men.)</TE>
<TE>   Chief among her rules: Lovers should live and work at least 50
miles apart, and preferably a state or two away. "People are so
lazy," she says. "They go for proximity and don't think about what
happens when you dump this person then have to see them at work every
day. What happens when your former squeeze sees your wife at the
company picnic? Let's not even mention ... sexual harassment."</TE>
<TE>   Some of Brandt's other rules:</TE>
<TE>   * Don't get caught. Phone bills, gift receipts, that extra key on
the key ring, a sudden interest in fitness, better grooming, new
positions in the bedroom--all are kisses of death.</TE>
<TE>   * If you get caught, deny everything. "Admitting to an affair,"
notes Brandt, "almost always leads to misery. The spouse really
doesn't want to believe it, and a confession only leads to hurt, rage
and months--sometimes even a lifetime--of distrust."</TE>
<TE>   * Practice safe sex on both sides; whatever you do, don't make a
baby.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't take affairs personally. In other words, don't delude
yourself into thinking this will lead to something permanent. (Only
5% of affairs end in marriage, the book asserts, and those mostly end
badly as well.)</TE>
<TE>   * Compartmentalize your relationships. Keep the world of your
affair completely separate from your married world. The only affair
more foolish than the office romance is one with someone in the
social circle you share with your spouse, Brandt says. So why risk so
much for someone you hardly know? Chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   New love is heady stuff. "Documented chemical changes take place
in the brain during the beginning stages of a relationship," says
Janis Spring, Yale University clinical psychologist and author of
"After the Affair" (Harper Collins), one of the bestselling books on
infidelity. "These changes are very powerful. Suddenly, this new
person makes the sky seem like a different color."</TE>
<TE>   The unfaithful partner hasn't thought through the consequences an
affair will have on a partner or family, Spring says. "Responsible
people get swept up in the overpowering chemistry of affairs and do
very self-destructive things."</TE>
<TE>   Hence Brandt's book, which she bills as both a warning and a
guide. "I'm trying to give people some perspective. People tend to
look at these relationships as some titanic new love, when the fact
is every relationship has a cycle. At first, feelings are extremely
intense, but they won't always be. I'm trying to help people make
sense of that so they can put affairs in perspective and act
appropriately."</TE>
<TE>   Brandt also presents an evolutionary argument for why men are
compelled to spread their seed and women seem on the make for men
with resources. She blames unbridled biology for these unfaithful
urges, often reducing the hot hook-up to a mere "gene exchange."
Spring doesn't buy that. "People often believe their drive to be
unfaithful is biological, but when you question these people you find
there are other factors operating that are putting conflict and
distance in their marriage." Brandt argues that affairs can actually
keep marriages intact by helping disenchanted partners release the
emotional and sexual pressure that may be driving them to divorce.
But that, observes Spring, means relying on some shaky premises: That
no one will find out. That no one will get hurt. That you can
compartmentalize.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfaithful partners believe that they can lead two lives, but
what happens is they become obsessed with the lover. The affair then
absorbs all the juice in the marriage and there's nothing left to
give at home. An affair doesn't save a marriage, it paralyzes a
marriage."</TE>
<TE>   Then maybe it's time to move on, says Brandt, a certifiable cynic
when discussing lasting love. Having one lover for life is a quaint
and ideal notion, but not terribly realistic, she says, noting that
love today parallels career changes. "People used to be more loyal.
They used to stay with one company for 30 or 40 years, then get the
gold watch. Now people have 10 different jobs during a 40-year
career, and as many meaningful relationships. Because there's more
opportunity, people trade up, move on and get canned."</TE>
<TE>   Though chock-full of tips and rationalizations to aid and abet the
affair-minded, "The 50-Mile Rule" and all its admonitions could just
as easily scare readers into lifelong faithfulness. "The fact is,"
says Brandt, "this is a high-stakes game. Some people are cut out for
it, and others are not. Fidelity is easier. I wouldn't say it's
always better."</TE>

<LD>California's First Fourth of July</LD>
<LD>   Remember the first time you and your family celebrated the Fourth
of July? You probably saw a parade and had a picnic lunch; maybe you
played a baseball game and saw fireworks in the evening. Did you see
a lot of American flags?</LD>
<LD>   American flags flying on the Fourth of July are a common sight in
California, but this was not always the case. The first time the
American flag was raised in our state is believed to have been on
July 4, 1829. California was part of Mexico at that time. Americans
living near San Diego wanted to celebrate U.S. Independence Day. They
worked at a nearby hide depot, where cattle hides were prepared for
market. For their Fourth of July party they raised a flag made of
colored shirt cloth over one of the buildings at the depot. We think
this was the first time the American flag flew over California soil.</LD>
<TE>   You can see a diorama, or model, of this site in the California
History Hall of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.
What you see is very much like the setting for the first Fourth of
July celebration in 1829. Look closely and you will see the U.S. flag
on top of one of the buildings. For general information about the
museum, call (213) 763-3466 or visit www.nhm.org.</TE>

<HD>On Emerald Pond</HD>
<DH>The lotuses of Echo Park Lake beckon once again with their
vibrant blooms</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Rutten</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In less self-conscious times, Los Angeles was the epicenter of
American exoticism.</LD>
<LD>   And if the spirit of uninhibited fantasy that gave rise to
apartments that resemble Moorish villas, shaped restaurants like hats
and combined crocodile farms with beer gardens has a surviving visual
symbol, it is the water lotuses of Echo Park.</LD>
<LD>   At regular intervals, the lotus bed at the northwest end of the
park's 16-acre lake, across the street from the sanctuary where Aimee
Semple McPherson once held forth, is suddenly carpeted with broad
green leaves. Gradually, tall green spires topped with bullet-shaped
bulbs emerge. And then one morning the bulbs open in spectacularly
spiky blossoms whose hues somehow suggest both Chinese silks and
Santa Ana-tinged sunsets. As one flower after another appears, groups
of strollers, photographers and plein-air painters gather on the path
alongside one of the largest stands of water lotuses outside Asia.</LD>
<TE>   Strangely, no one knows how the plants came to be in the lake.
Historical sources even are unclear on whether they first appeared in
1923 or 1924. Since then, stories concerning their beginnings have
proliferated along with the flowers. One says they were quietly
planted by congregants of nearby Chinese churches, who missed a
familiar food plant. Another attributes their presence to a grieving
gardener forced by eviction to vacate a house and garden that
included a pond.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the case, the lotuses found a home whose exotic origins
matched their own. A little more than 100 years ago, the place now
occupied by Echo Park was an arroyo through which a natural stream
ran. In 1868, the Los Angeles Canal and Reservoir Co., which had
taken over the pueblo's zanja madre or mother ditch, dammed the
stream to create a reservoir that could be used to power a nearby
woolen mill and to water the vineyards and walnut groves that
stretched south of the site. In less than a decade, the reservoir and
adjoining land passed into the hands of two developers who in 1888
donated the whole parcel to Los Angeles for use as a public park.</TE>
<TE>   The city's superintendent of parks was Joseph Tomlinson, an
English immigrant, who saw in the site a chance to re-create the
hilly Derbyshire garden that had been his favorite childhood
playground. He capped the spring and created the existing 16-acre
lake, which now is filled with city water. The lush planting scheme
Tomlinson pursued on the surrounding 15 acres of land forever muffled
the distinctive echo that had given the arroyo--and today's park--its
name.</TE>

<HD>Who'd Replace the Crafty Queen?</HD>
<DH>With Martha Stewart facing an uncertain future, candidates
are coming out of the wall sconces.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROY RIVENBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Inquiring minds want to know: Will Martha Stewart go to the slammer
for insider trading and, if she does, who will take her place? To
find out, we constructed a time machine using metal alloys we mined
with a melon baller, physics equations we derived while baking
cranberry-pecan tarts and jet fuel we hand-pumped from a backyard oil
well and refined with a salad spinner.</LD>
<LD>   We then traveled to January 2003, where we found Martha sitting in
stir, trading 15 cartons of cigarettes for a gallon of heirloom
rose-colored paint to brighten her cell. Here's a rundown of other
developments in the Marthagate scandal:</LD>
<LD>   Jan. 22, 2003: A federal judge sentences Martha to four years in
prison for SEC violations, obstruction of justice and "just being
generally annoying." Within hours, celebrities begin jockeying to
become "the next Martha Stewart." Al Gore is the first to announce
his candidacy. Armed with position papers on window treatments and
squash-planting, he taps Sen. Joseph Lieberman to become
"vice-Martha."</LD>
<TE>   Jan. 24: In prison, Martha volunteers for kitchen duty, preparing
a sumptuous banquet of grilled mystery meat with a cilantro mint rub
and an herb salad grown in the prison yard.</TE>
<TE>   Jan. 28: Professional litigant Michael Newdow, looking for a fresh
challenge after getting "under God" banned from the Pledge of
Allegiance, files a lawsuit to have the entire Gregorian calendar
system declared unconstitutional because it's based on the birth of
Jesus and violates the separation of church and state. The Supreme
Court agrees and, after drawing numbers from a hat, officially
changes 2003 to 1548. Out of work, God applies for the Martha job.</TE>
<TE>   Jan. 30, 1548: Martha remodels her jail cell with hand-embroidered
shiv cozies, aluminum foil votive candles and window coverings
fashioned from dental floss.</TE>
<TE>   Jan. 31: Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge throws his hat in
the ring to succeed Martha Stewart, saying, "America won't truly be
secure until the hues of our living rooms resonate with the color
palettes of our plush natural cotton bath towels."</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 1: Using nothing but a bar of soap and a rusty whisk, Martha
creates intricately patterned doilies for Florida's electric chair.</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 2: Exploiting the popularity of his TV series, Ozzy Osbourne
proclaims himself "the new Martha #@$%-ing Stewart. All I need is a
bloody cookbook and my empire will be complete."</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 3: Parole--it's a good thing. Martha is released from prison.
Fox TV immediately recruits her for its next "Celebrity Boxing" show,
where she and the Prince of Darkness duke it out for the title of
Diva of Domesticity. Other celebrity matches on the program include
Capt. Kirk versus Mr. Spock; Thing from "The Addams Family" versus
the Hamburger Helper hand; Mr. T versus Mr. Coffee; and the
Backstreet Boys versus five steam rollers.</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 4: After beating Ozzy to a pulp, Martha issues a revised
Pledge of Allegiance in which Americans are united as "one nation,
under Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc., with liberty and
decorative wall sconces for all."</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>MILAN, Italy</DL>
<LD>The spring 2003 man is a relaxed and discerning dresser. After
decades of dictated styles, the male customer is learning to pick and
choose in the ever-growing menswear market and designers are letting
him make up his mind.</LD>
<LD>   The ideas offered during the five-day Italian menswear previews
last week ran the gamut from three-piece, pinstriped suits to bikini
beachwear. Overall, the look is casual rather than formal, with a
touch of luxury and Asia in embroidered silks and satins.</LD>
<LD>   Lucky is the man who is a faithful Giorgio Armani customer. This
round he will rediscover the pleasure of ultra-light fabrics in soft
grays and blues that have made the Armani suit the softest uniform on
Earth.</LD>
<TE>   He will also be able to indulge in exotic fashions, from Nehru
shirts to jodhpur trousers, from kimono tops to wide fisherman pants.
Floral printed shirts and trousers, which have made a big comeback
this season, lend a holiday--but never touristy--feel to the
collection. The latest Armani jacket has a wide lapel, a narrow
waist, and follows the hips.</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Lauren, who made his Italian debut in January, opts for a
more formal approach. Staged here in his downtown palazzo decorated
in the trademark "welcome to my home" style for which he is famous,
the luxury Purple Label collection tells a tale of garden parties,
crew races and nights in the Ivy League bar.</TE>
<TE>   Superbly woven cotton tweed jackets are worn with lightweight gray
slacks, a contrasting vest complete with watch chain, bold tie and
striped shirt with white round collar. Class is a way of life to the
Lauren boys who wear their hair in a wispy pageboy parted on the side
and can afford to shed socks under formal footwear.</TE>
<TE>   Calvin Klein continued his minimalist story with sleek suits in
techno Japanese fabrics, or crumpled linen.</TE>
<TE>   Dolce &amp; Gabbana brought the whole family to the beach, setting up
everything from sand to pails, beach balls to tables and umbrellas in
the middle of the runway. The collection was based entirely on
Americana sportswear: baseball jackets and caps, surfer shorts,
extra-large cargo pants and the omnipresent distressed jeans.</TE>
<TE>   Donatella Versace took a tougher view of fashion fun with her
secondary Versus line, sending her boys down a dark runway for some
black-leather and chain-gang entertainment. The lights dimmed as
tough guys in chain-belted, tight black leather trousers, heavy-duty
black leather bomber jackets over printed shirts and sharp studded
boots marched down the runway to blaring heavy-metal music.</TE>
<TE>   But the sexiest thing seen on the runways was Tom Ford's Gucci
guy. He's rich, relaxed and even risque, but never rough nor raunchy.
He wears his clothes with a casual nonchalance, as symbolized by the
straw hat he sports with every outfit, tipped at a perfect cocky
angle.</TE>
<TE>   Ford's "California Dreamer" likes his pants tight at the waist but
loose on the leg. His jacket is tapered with an extra-long sleeve,
and although he prefers to be bare-chested he doesn't shun a shirt
and tie. His mood is definitely Eastern, with silk bomber jackets
embroidered with erotic scenes, sumptuous kimono robes, silk slippers
and his hair tied in a tiny ponytail.</TE>
<TE>   "My man is a rock star in love with Japan, a country both very
relaxed and very sensual," Ford said after his much-applauded show.</TE>

<HD>Creating a Parish Comfort Zone</HD>
<DH>Priest's openness about church scandal strengthens his tie
with his flock</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BROCKTON, Mass.</DL>
<LD>White- haired and bespectacled, the priest looked befuddled. Oh dear,
he muttered, where is that little turkey?</LD>
<LD>   That is Father Frank Cloherty's fond shorthand for the 200 or so
children at St. Patrick Roman Catholic Church, "because it's easier
than remembering all those names." The term seems fitting in this
bustling parish southeast of Boston--a mix of immigrants and old-time
residents in a tough industrial city. Like babes in the barnyard, the
kids flock to their pastor.</LD>
<LD>   These young parishioners and their parents are well aware that a
terrible cloud has settled over many who wear the Roman collar. They
have heard the term "pedophile priest" at home, in Sunday school and
in the very sanctuary where Cloherty delivered an angry homily on the
topic when the sexual abuse scandal first exploded in January. These
784 families--nearly 3,000 people--are as outraged as anyone about
sexual misconduct in the priesthood, and about a church hierarchy
that for decades covered it up.</LD>
<TE>   Yet parish offerings are up since January. Attendance has not
wavered. Social gatherings continue, bringing together families from
diverse origins. No one flees or slams the door when the priest drops
by the house unannounced, sometimes in jogging clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Youth groups flourish with such abandon that at one recent outing,
a dozen or more teenagers playfully pelted Cloherty with water
balloons.</TE>
<TE>   "People here really care about this parish," said Ellen Vellios, a
member at St. Patrick for half her 64 years. "I think we are all
trying to work together to understand this thing."</TE>
<TE>   Though more than 100 priests from the Boston archdiocese have been
named in the scandal, St. Patrick appears to have escaped direct
experience with a pedophile priest. Still, the issue is close to
home, because for several months Cloherty has been doing double duty:
commuting to a nearby church whose priest was removed after a
38-year-old allegation against him surfaced.</TE>
<TE>   Cloherty--known here as often as not as Father Frank, or sometimes
just Frank--also has insisted that the topic be on the table at St.
Patrick. He convened "listening sessions" days after the scandal
broke. And right from the beginning, said pastoral associate Jeanne
LaFond, "he expressed his feelings about what was going on."</TE>
<TE>   The 66-year-old priest was so upset, she remembered, that
"actually he started to break down a bit, so some people in the
congregation went up to him and gave him a hug."</TE>
<TE>   More than simple respect, that strong level of comfort between
pastor and parishioners characterizes St. Patrick in particular--and
on a broader level, many churches made up of new immigrants and a
wide range of incomes. In such parishes, the crisis among members of
the Catholic hierarchy may only have driven worshipers closer to
their pastors.</TE>
<TE>   They are relieved to be worshiping in a setting that has not been
directly hit by the crisis. They continue to draw strength from their
faith and from each other. They spare no wrath for leaders such as
Cardinal Bernard Law, archbishop of Boston. But their faith
transcends the hierarchy.</TE>
<TE>   "What I have seen is that the more evident it has become that the
bishops have really failed the church, the more people have warmed to
their local clergy," said Paul F. Lakeland, a professor of religious
studies at Fairfield University in Connecticut. "There's a closeness
between people and pastor that might not have been there before the
bishops started to fail them."</TE>
<TE>   In a setting like St. Patrick, parishioners agree that Cloherty
was courageous for standing up so early and airing his own
indignation, almost in defiance of his superiors.</TE>
<TE>   "But what are they going to do?" asked Lakeland, who studies
Catholicism in America. "Move him to a poorer parish?"</TE>
<TE>   Diplomatically, Cloherty describes his parishioners as "not
wealthy." Many fall under the rubric of the working poor. But there
are also professionals--lawyers and architects--for example. A year
ago, the average weekly offering at St. Patrick was $3,000. Since
January, that figure has grown to $3,600.</TE>
<TE>   About 50% of congregants here are Hispanic, representing 17
Spanish-speaking countries. There are also new immigrants from Haiti
and Cape Verde (off the west coast of Africa), and about 5% of
worshipers are from Southeast Asia.</TE>
<TE>   It would be tempting in this setting to talk about building
bridges. But really, said lifelong parishioner Nick Allard, 17,
"There's a lot of different people, and we do a lot to accommodate
each other."</TE>
<TE>   The small choir shuns robes and sings to the accompaniment of
maracas, a tambourine and conga drums. Though there are seven
Catholic churches in this city of 94,000, Cloherty jokes with
unfortunate honesty that many choose this brick edifice two doors
from a Salvation Army rehab center just to hear his miserable
Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   In a homily, he also quipped that over the years, some
parishioners have accused him of "becoming Protestant" because of his
sweeping interpretation of the Scriptures. On this same Sunday,
before baptizing a baby named Miguel Angel, Cloherty invited
7-year-old Nathan Lom to help act out a liturgical lesson that
involved bopping the priest with tree branches.</TE>
<TE>   A Diverse Congregation</TE>
<TE>   Julie Lom, Nathan's mother, credits the diverse congregation for
promoting such a relaxed relationship with the pastor. As is the case
in her husband's home community in central Mexico, Lom said, "We see
him as a person and not as a priest. He is more or less like an
equivalent, not up on some pedestal."</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the scandal broke, Lom questioned her four sons
intensely. After that, she said, she felt comfortable sending them on
outings or to the movies with Father Frank.</TE>
<TE>   "My older son Moises--he is 13--works at the rectory on Sundays by
himself. He is there with all the priests, but I feel completely
safe," said Lom, a registered nurse. "I know that may sound naive to
some people, but I do. I feel very safe at this parish."</TE>
<TE>   In turn, Cloherty has refused to change some aspects of his job.</TE>
<TE>   "I know there are some priests who now say they will never be
alone with an altar boy in the sacristy," he said. "Give me a break.
Why should I engage in radically different behavior? I don't see it."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Cloherty admitted he does think twice now before hugging a
child. He seldom initiates physical contact with the "little turkeys"
in his parish--and when he does, he makes sure another adult is
present.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly has made me more guarded," he said. "But I can fool
around with them in other ways. I can make jabbing remarks, for
instance. The issue is that they need attention. They don't need to
be hugged all the time."</TE>
<TE>   For Cloherty, the bigger issue is clericalism--as he put
it--"protecting the image of the church, and doing so at the expense
of putting people at risk."</TE>
<TE>   The son of Irish immigrants who spoke Gaelic at home, Cloherty was
trained more than 40 years ago as a diocesan priest. A seminary
classmate was John J. Geoghan, the former priest whose conviction in
January unleashed the crisis. In 1984, Cloherty filed a sexual abuse
complaint on behalf of a boy against Geoghan with the Boston
archdiocese. Nothing happened, he said.</TE>
<TE>   He offers no defense for sexual misconduct by priests, and
strongly faults the church.</TE>
<TE>   "It did not in any way prepare us for a life of celibacy," he
said. "The church has to take responsibility for that."</TE>
<TE>   Ten years into his tenure at St. Patrick, Cloherty has pressed his
congregants to seize the crisis as an opportunity. "I believe firmly
that the leadership in resolving this has to come from the lay
people," he said. "We have an emancipated lay people. They don't need
someone in quotation marks to be their 'Father,' telling them what to
do."</TE>
<TE>   Rallying Cry</TE>
<TE>   At parties where chorizo is served alongside Asian rice, this kind
of openness has made the crisis almost a rallying cry. Tammy
Fernandez, 18, says that at her mother's weekly Bible study group,
"This has been an ongoing conversation. It has to be, because this is
something we have to deal with."</TE>
<TE>   Fernandez, bound for college in the fall, welcomes what she sees
as a healthy willingness to address a fundamentally distasteful
topic. "Where my parents come from"--the Dominican Republic--these
subjects before might have been taboo, but now they talk about it.
They'll talk about it openly. They'll try to get those feelings out
in the open, and I guess that kind of carries over into conversations
with the English-speaking community, where we try to be open with
each other."</TE>
<TE>   As a first-generation American, Fernandez said St. Patrick has had
a central role in her life. She worked last summer as an
administrator for the church-owned cemetery. On Sundays, she
sometimes attended the general Mass at 10 a.m., then stuck around for
the Mass in Spanish at noon. "Other kids had Brownies and sports,"
she said. "I had the church."</TE>
<TE>   This reliance on her church--the assumption that it will be there
to back her up--makes Fernandez typical of many new Americans, said
David Pilgrim, a professor of sociology at Ferris State University in
Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   "The church has been, for good and bad, a tremendous agent for
assimilation for immigrant groups--and the Catholic Church, more than
any other church, was a major assimilationist tool," said Pilgrim,
who studies race relations and religion.</TE>
<TE>   "More than a sanctuary, more than an anchor, the church is an
answer-giver. And of course, if you are an immigrant, you want
answers."</TE>
<TE>   Many parishioners at St. Patrick may be furious about the scandal,
Pilgrim said, "but I think the people who are the most disillusioned
are not the most recent immigrants. If you think about the role
religion plays in peoples' lives, when you have a tragedy or a
travesty--when you have these soul-shaking events occurring--that's
going to drive these people closer to their faith. I don't want to
sound simplistic. But that's what they have."</TE>
<TE>   Cloherty knows that in two years the archdiocese may reassign him.
He would like to stay on at St. Patrick. But if he does move, his two
requirements for a new parish are that it be urban and poor.</TE>
<TE>   For now, he presides over a congregation that seems almost to have
grown stronger in the face of crisis. Allard, an altar boy who thinks
nothing of spending time alone with his priest, said the sense of
solidarity at St. Patrick is hard to explain. But like faith, he
said, it is there.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure where it came from," he said. "Maybe God gave it to
us."</TE>

<HD>The Fourth Without a Flag</HD>
<DH>Part 1</DH>

<AU>LAEL LITTKE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was the Fourth of July in Turkey Creek. The Fourth was
Picnic-and-Patriotic-Program-and-Parade Day. It was also Glory
Halliburton's day because Glory was going to carry the big flag that
would lead the parade.</LD>
<LD>   That is, if Mayor Bassett could find the big flag.</LD>
<LD>   "Mama," Glory said, "what will happen if the mayor doesn't find
the flag?"</LD>
<TE>   Mama was sewing the red vest, white shirt and blue skirt that
Glory would wear to lead the parade. "We'll just hope he finds it,"
she said over the whir of her sewing machine.</TE>
<TE>   Glory was worried. Mayor Bassett was very absent-minded. He
couldn't remember where he'd put the big flag after the parade last
year.</TE>
<TE>   It wouldn't be Glory's day if the flag weren't found. Sugar
McCrary would love to lead the parade. But Glory had written the
winning essay in a contest at school. She'd started it with, "I was
named after Old Glory, and it is part of me." The judges had chosen
her to carry the flag.</TE>
<TE>   "Can we go to Mayor Bassett's general store and help him look for
the flag?" Glory asked.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't go," Mama said. "After I finish your costume, I have to
hem red sashes for the Singing Mothers to wear in the parade with
their white dresses and blue ties." She pointed to a stack of red
cloth.</TE>
<TE>   The Singing Mothers were going to sing "The Battle Hymn of the
Republic" while the Turkey Creek School Band played.</TE>
<TE>   "Well," Glory said, "may Quentin and I go to Mayor Bassett's
store?" Glory's brother Quentin was only 5, but his sharp eyes might
spot the flag.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," Mama agreed, "then go straight to the park from there." Her
forehead creased in a worry line. "It's getting late. I'll have to
take my sewing basket to the park to finish the sashes."</TE>
<TE>   "I'll help when we get there," Glory said. "Come on, Quentin.
Let's go to Mayor Bassett's store."</TE>

<HD>Study: Baby Walker May Delay First Steps</HD>
<DH>Infants who use the device are slower to crawl, stand, walk</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA MARSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baby walkers may keep curious children--and their parents--happy, but
that peace and quiet comes at a price.</LD>
<LD>   Use of the devices, in which babies are able to propel themselves
about even though they can't walk or crawl, may delay an infant's
normal motor development. In a study of 190 healthy babies,
researchers at University College in Dublin, Ireland, discovered that
those who used walkers were slower to crawl, stand and walk than
children who didn't. They calculated that each 24 hours of walker use
postponed the moment that a child could walk unaided by 3.3 days and
stand unaided by 3.7 days.</LD>
<LD>   Some previous studies had indicated that walkers encourage
walking, exercise and mobility, but the new research confirms the
results of a similar 1999 U.S. study.</LD>
<TE>   "The importance of this research is that it dispels the myth that
baby walkers help a child learn to walk--quite the opposite is
actually the case," said Dr. Gary A. Smith, director of the Center
for Injury Research at Columbus Children's Hospital in Columbus,
Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with baby walkers, say experts, is that infants can
move around without carrying their body weight. Consequently, a
child's muscles don't develop normally, and the nervous system is
deprived of the sensory information required to learn how to walk.
"The delays are not long lasting and kids do catch up," said Smith,
who pointed out that infant walkers are also associated with
thousands of injuries a year.</TE>
<TE>   "A better--and safer--alternative is stationary activity centers
that don't have wheels. Infants are occupied, but they aren't able to
move around and get into trouble," he said.</TE>

<HD>Snake Oil Salesmen Weren't Always Considered Slimy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Snake oil"--it's not a flattering phrase, and definitely not
anything we'd want to plaster on a bottle of some cure-all we were
trying to sell.</LD>
<LD>   But presumably there was a time when the two small words were a
fabulous selling point--when they conjured up images of potency,
trustworthiness and miracle cures. Perhaps there were even books
titled "Snake Oil: Nature's Miracle Medicine" (because people, after
all, were far less sophisticated than today).</LD>
<LD>   In fact, the history of the term is a little slippery to track
down. Some historians, for instance, say there never was such a thing
as real snake oil.</LD>
<TE>   "The term has nothing to do with snakes or serpents," writes Dr.
William S. Haubrich in his book "Medical Meanings" (1997, American
College of Physicians). Instead, he says, the story goes like this:</TE>
<TE>   Native Americans in the Pennsylvanian backwoods would rub cuts and
scrapes with a slimy, tar-like oil seeping from the ground. Then
settlers came along, observed this habit, and decided to bottle the
slimy goop and sell it. They called the brew "Seneca oil," after a
native tribe, to give it the oomph of a "mystical Indian remedy."
Sometimes this was mispronounced Sen-ake-a oil. And thus, eventually,
came "snake oil."</TE>
<TE>   But others who've delved into the topic say there really were
snake oils that--at least from outward appearance--had rattlers front
and central on the ingredient list.</TE>
<TE>   We heard this from researcher Joe Nickell of the Committee for the
Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (which
investigates quack science as well as spaceship sightings). Nickell,
while researching an article on snake oil, stumbled upon a yellowed
newspaper clipping from 1880 that described an old trapper who killed
rattlesnakes, extracted oil from their bodies, then sold it for a
dollar an ounce for its "great curative powers."</TE>
<TE>   "The article makes it clear that people were going out and getting
rattlesnakes and squeezing the life and the grease out of them," he
says. Nickell has seen antique bottles, too, with "snake oil" boldly
emblazoned on them. He's seen a later bottle, too, with "antiseptic
liniment, known as snake oil" written on it--this one, he believes,
from a time in the early 20th century when the government was
beginning to crack down on fraudulent cure-alls.</TE>
<TE>   The most colorful snake oil salesman, however, was a late 19th
century cowboy known as Clark Stanley, the self-proclaimed
"rattlesnake king." Stanley mesmerized crowds at fairs with his
antics, though instead of demonstrating vegetable dicers and slicers
or miracle floor mops, he slaughtered rattlesnakes and pressed their
juices.</TE>
<TE>   Stanley's snake oil was for external use only, like a liniment,
and was purported to treat a whole slew of things such as pain,
rheumatism, lumbago, animal bites and scratches. It sold for 50 cents
a bottle.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in 1917, came the government's crackdown. A shipment of the
liniment was seized and chemically analyzed. "They found it to be
basically mineral oil," says Nickell. Minor ingredients included
camphor, turpentine and hot pepper--which presumably acted like
modern-day liniments, bringing relief by providing distracting heat.</TE>
<TE>   Still, one California doctor thinks that the term "snake oil"
should be rehabilitated. Dr. Richard Kunin of San Francisco says he's
analyzed oil extracted from two rattlesnake species among others and
found them to be good sources of omega-3 fatty acids.</TE>
<TE>   And Chinese medicine makes good use of the snake for ailments such
as gout, eczema, coughs and more--though not particularly the oil,
says Dr. Ka-Kit Hui, director of UCLA's Center for East-West
Medicine. Snakes (whole animals or parts of them, such as the venom,
skin or gall bladders) are prepared in a variety of ways: fried with
herbs in wine, boiled in soup. Then the extracts are either drunk or
applied topically.</TE>
<TE>   Hui doesn't recommend stewing up your own rattler brew, though:
"The snake has to be prepared correctly to properly extract the
toxins," he says.</TE>

<LD>There was a time when swimming was my life.</LD>
<LD>   I spent two to four hours a day in the pool, depending on the
season. My hair turned to straw, and my skin sweated chlorine, even
when I was dry. I felt more comfortable in Lycra than corduroy. I
swam in junior high, high school and college. I was in the best shape
of my life, and when it all ended, I was so burned out that I never
wanted to swim again. At least not in a pool. Not with stopwatches,
splits and sets.</LD>
<LD>   It's been 15 years now, and the sound of my coach's screaming has
faded to an occasional flashback. It's not that I never get in the
pool. I do. But I never really push myself like during my swim team
days. And I miss feeling fast and sleek as a mermaid. With summer
here, and warm bikini days ahead, I long for that toned all-over
workout that regular swimming provides. So last week I decided to
attend a masters swim workout at the Stuart M. Ketchum Downtown YMCA
in Los Angeles. Many YMCAs and sports clubs have masters swim teams.
Some teams compete in a masters circuit; others are mostly an
opportunity for someone to work out harder than they would on their
own, with the camaraderie of a team practice.</LD>
<TE>   At the Ketchum Y, the masters team practices from 6:30 to 8 a.m.
Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and from 7 to 8:30 p.m. Thursday. Three
of the four days swimmers work out independently, following a workout
plan that is posted by the pool. On Wednesdays, the coach turns up,
to hound the swimmers and put a little fear in the soul.</TE>
<TE>   I got nervous thinking about it.</TE>
<TE>   I arrived at 6:30 a.m. and no one was there. The lifeguard said
the masters swimmers usually drift in a little later.</TE>
<TE>   "Doesn't look too hard," he commented. "You just have to be
consistent."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, around 6:45 a.m. an obvious swimmer wandered in and
picked out every accessory possible--kickboard, pull buoy, paddles
and mini-flippers.</TE>
<TE>   She introduced herself, and we shared a lane. She said the coach
usually arrived around 7.</TE>
<TE>   The workout plan was up on the wall: 3,600 yards (about two
miles)! More than I had done since college. We started out with
600-yard warmups, 200 yards of freestyle, 200 kicking, 200 pulling.
It was fun to have someone next to me, a companion to blow bubbles at
as I powered down the lane and through my clumsy flip turns.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, we hit the core of the workout: 20 x 50 yards, individual
medley order, which means butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke and
freestyle. That was followed by a second set of 20 x 50-yard
freestyle. Butterfly used to be my stroke. I started swimming so I
could learn to swim butterfly. I used to stand in front of my bedroom
mirror as a child, practicing getting my double kick to match my
arms--just like my swim coach ordered.</TE>
<TE>   We did first one, then a second set of individual medleys. I was
feeling good, skimming over the water. By the third set, though, I
could barely get my arms out of the water on the butterfly. The
stroke works when you are strong, but it falls apart when you are
weak, sliding from graceful and smooth, like a dolphin, to jerky and
convulsive, like a panicked bird.</TE>
<TE>   That's when our coach, Nora Wei Yue Zhong, appeared on the deck,
stopwatch in hand.</TE>
<TE>   Zhong is a former swimmer for the Chinese National Team and also
swam for USC. She has been coaching the masters group for 18 months
and said two to four swimmers attend the masters swim workout
regularly. Others drop in occasionally. Some swimmers want to get
fit; some are training for ocean swimming events or triathlons. Zhong
said few of her masters swimmers at the downtown Y are former
competitive swimmers.</TE>
<TE>   "They are just people who want to swim faster and have me help
their strokes and give them feedback," Zhong said. "It is really for
fitness purposes, not for any competitive reasons."</TE>
<TE>   But of course competition plays into the workout, which is
precisely why it is so much more effective than working out on your
own.</TE>
<TE>   Zhong timed us as we swam against each other and the clock. There
is nothing like someone standing over you, and calling out your
times, to make you swim faster. It is an unbelievable motivator.</TE>
<TE>   Nora called out our times every 50 yards. When we stroked in
panting for air, she got us off the wall and paddling hard into the
next 50. Almost immediately I was so overheated I could barely see
out of my goggles. But there was no slacking off. No hanging on the
walls.</TE>
<TE>   My arms were dragging on all my strokes. My lane-mate was leaving
me in the dust.</TE>
<TE>   Between 50s Nora offered critiques on our strokes. "Good
butterfly," she said. "Roll your shoulders more on the backstroke.
Pull your shoulders forward more on the breaststroke. Like this." She
stood above me and demonstrated how it should work.</TE>
<TE>   My times seemed to be going up five seconds every 50 yards. I
tried to remind myself that you can't compare your 35-year-old
corporate desk-bound self to your life as a college athlete. Still,
it was a sobering reminder of age, fitness and how rarely I really
push myself. My strokes are still smooth--no competitive swimmer ever
loses their stroke completely--but I lose strength quickly.</TE>
<TE>   I pushed and pushed, and swam for an hour. I couldn't even finish
the workout. My tired arms scraped the water like paddles; my goggles
were so steamy I was swimming blind. I swam a few cool-down laps and
sat slumped on the edge of the pool like a ball of mozzarella, while
the masters class regulars powered by me. I didn't even know if I
could make it to the showers.</TE>
<TE>   The lifeguard was right. It didn't look hard. But it would take at
least a month to become consistent.</TE>
<TE>   I ate my second breakfast at 8 a.m. (Swimming is the one sport
that gives me an immediate appetite, rather than suppressing it.)
When I got to work at 8:30 a.m. I could sit still and concentrate
with uncharacteristic focus. I didn't even need coffee.</TE>
<TE>   My arms and shoulders were sore the next morning, but I felt like
an athlete again. For a day.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Infertility may strain a marriage, but studies have shown that most
couples weather the storm quite well. Now researchers are taking a
closer look at why some couples come through infertility treatment
with a stronger marriage and what goes wrong in those cases when the
relationship suffers. Their conclusion: The husband's involvement
plays a pivotal role.</LD>
<LD>   Forty-eight couples recruited from three fertility practices in
the Los Angeles area completed several questionnaires and
evaluations, including an analysis of a recorded conversation between
the husband and wife about their difficulty conceiving a child.</LD>
<LD>   Communication between the couple was positive--and the quality of
the marriage was better--when husbands believed that having children
was important, wanted to participate in the effort to overcome the
infertility and wanted to talk with their partners about it. Even
when the wife's level of involvement was low, the researchers found
that a husband's involvement could have a positive effect on the
marriage.</LD>
<TE>   Lauri A. Pasch, assistant professor of psychiatry at UC San
Francisco and the study's lead author, is now conducting a larger
study that will evaluate 500 couples being treated for infertility.
For now, she says, a couple can be sure they're treated as a couple
by asking that both of their names be on the chart. And because wives
are more likely to undergo the treatments, the woman can help involve
her husband by being sure the doctor explains the options to both of
them.</TE>

<TE>   Reduced-Fat Foods Don't Necessarily Mean Reduced Calories</TE>
<TE>   Low-fat foods have been a big hit with Americans. More than 90% of
us eat them, and there's now a reduced-fat version of almost any
treat you love to eat.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is, with so many low-fat and fat-free cakes, cookies,
ice creams and sweet rolls available, we may be eating more snacks
and desserts than if we only had full-fat versions to choose from. In
fact, according to a recent American Heart Assn. statement, some
foods made with fat substitutes have the same or more calories than
the full-fat ones.</TE>
<TE>   The AHA statement was published in the association's science
journal Circulation to clarify some of the misconceptions about fat
substitutes and weight loss. For instance, reduced fat doesn't mean
reduced calories. Depending on what a fat substitute is made of, the
number of calories varies from almost nothing to nine per gram, which
is the same as a gram of fat. "You need to look at the number of
grams of fat and calories per serving and how many servings are in
the package," says Judith Wylie-Rosett of the Albert Einstein College
of Medicine in Bronx, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Fat substitutes can be made from carbohydrates, protein and, yes,
even fat. Olestra, for example, is a "fat-based" substitute. Because
it interferes with absorption of certain fat-soluble nutrients and
vitamins, Wylie-Rosett, who is also the author of the AHA statement,
suggests limiting your portion of chips or other Olestra-containing
snacks to 1 ounce.</TE>

<TE>   Spring Mattresses Keep More Dust Mites Away</TE>
<TE>   Sleeping on a spring mattress instead of a foam one may be a good
idea for the allergy-prone.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers in Norway who analyzed samples from the mattresses of
50 schoolchildren with asthma and 102 healthy children reported that
the risk of finding dust mite feces was four times higher in foam
mattresses than in spring mattresses. Foam mattresses with no fabric
covering had eight times more evidence of dust mites, the tiny
creatures whose airborne droppings permeate homes.</TE>
<TE>   People with allergies do all sorts of things to minimize their
nighttime exposure to mites, but all of the usual methods have their
drawbacks. Vacuuming is at best a short-term solution. Plastic
mattress covers are uncomfortable; sprays designed to kill the mites
don't penetrate deeply enough into mattresses, and their toxicity is
uncertain. Sleeping on a spring mattress could reduce the exposure to
mite allergens by four to eight times, says Dr. Morten Schei, a
coauthor of the study.</TE>

<TE>   Study Finds Mothers Do Well at Checking Children's Moles</TE>
<TE>   Parents, especially mothers, are nearly as good as dermatologists
at checking moles on their children. Researchers in Australia, where
the incidence of skin cancer is considered an epidemic, found that
when parents were given instructions on how to identify moles, their
counts were close to those done by a trained expert. Having a great
many moles is a risk factor for melanoma, a deadly form of skin
cancer, so parents may want to track an increase in moles in their
children.</TE>
<TE>   More than 300 children were included in the study, and moms did
most of the counting. About half of the children were fair- or
red-haired and blue-eyed, the skin type that is at greatest risk of
developing skin cancer later in life.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first study to evaluate parents' ability to identify
moles when they're told what to look for. Regular tracking of a
child's moles helps parents know if their child is at risk of skin
cancer and needs extra sun protection; it also starts a pattern of
routine skin exams that should become a habit when kids grow up.</TE>

<TE>   Exercise Helps Older Women Lose the Belly, Researchers Discover</TE>
<TE>   Older women may have the advantage over men when it comes to
getting rid of belly bulge. A new study of the effects of regular
strength training in older people found that they all lost fat and
gained muscle but that women had more success in shedding deep
abdominal fat.</TE>
<TE>   The 30 men and women, ages 61 to 77, exercised three times a week
for 25 weeks on various resistance machines. All of the participants
maintained their weight within 2 pounds of their starting weight, but
the men managed to shed 9% of their total body fat, on average, and
women lost 6%. Researchers using CT scans to measure the loss of deep
fat at the bellybutton found that women had lost 12% of their deep
fat, and men lost almost none.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have a good explanation for this difference," says
researcher Gary R. Hunter, of the University of Alabama at
Birmingham. "I expected the men would lose more. As [men] get fatter,
we accumulate a higher proportion in that area, and we expected
[that] as you got leaner, the process would reverse."</TE>
<TE>   More encouraging were the changes in muscle. The men gained about
4 pounds of muscle, and the women gained 2, with the changes
resulting in an increased ease in being physically active as well as
burning more calories.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time fat distribution changes have been
compared between older men and women following resistance training,"
says Hunter.</TE>

<HD>Lighter Moods Without Drugs</HD>
<DH>Alternatives from talk therapy to exercise are helping
people with depression when medicines don't fit the bill</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Antidepressants are now taken by tens of millions of Americans, and
many people credit them with changing, or even saving, their lives.</LD>
<LD>   But they're not for everyone.</LD>
<LD>   The most-prescribed medications, SSRIs (selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors) such as Paxil, Prozac and Zoloft, have a host of
potential side effects, including loss of libido, insomnia,
restlessness, weight gain, headaches and anxiety. Little is known
about the effects of long-term use. Furthermore, the drugs can be
prohibitively expensive for people without health insurance. The
lowest dosage of Paxil, for instance, costs about $70 for a 30-day
supply.</LD>
<TE>   For some people, the drugs simply don't work. Last year, 111
million prescriptions were written for SSRIs, a 14% increase from
2000, according to IMS Health, a market research firm. But a 2000 New
England Journal of Medicine study found that the medications fail to
help one-third of people suffering from mild to moderate depression
and half of those suffering from chronic depression.</TE>
<TE>   "The benefits of prescription drugs aren't as great as we all
believed," says Dr. Daniel F. Kripke, a psychiatrist at UC San Diego
in La Jolla who studies depression treatments.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers still don't understand why the medications, which
boost the production of the brain chemical serotonin, aren't
effective for everyone.</TE>
<TE>   But they have begun to study alternatives. Among the most
promising are psychotherapy, light therapy, supplements and good
old-fashioned aerobic exercise. Acupuncture, yoga, massage and
relaxation techniques may also offer temporary relief, as can dietary
changes, such as avoiding caffeine or loading up on fish rich in
omega-3 fatty acids, which purportedly spike serotonin levels.
Serotonin is a brain chemical that regulates mood.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Cumming, a 46-year-old San Diego man, tried light therapy to
ease his depression in 1998. "In less than a week, I felt like a
major cloud had been lifted," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, people suffering from severe depression shouldn't
experiment on their own with these techniques, caution experts. But
used under the supervision of a trained professional, they can
provide an alternative to medication. For people with milder
symptoms, these antidotes might be all they need to banish the blues.</TE>
<TE>   The Talking Cure</TE>
<TE>   Traditional talk therapy fell out of favor in recent years because
drug therapy was considered to be easier, cheaper and less
time-consuming. But a form of psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral
therapy, could bring face-to-face treatment back into the limelight.
In this form of therapy, patients learn coping strategies to
counteract the obsessive thoughts of failure, inadequacy and
pervasive gloom that typify depression.</TE>
<TE>   "Psychotherapy has really been undersold as a treatment for
depression," says Robert J. DeRubeis, chairman of the psychology
department at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. "But
cognitive therapy works just as well as medication, even in severely
depressed people." In a 2002 study conducted at Vanderbilt University
in Nashville and the University of Pennsylvania, SSRIs were compared
with cognitive behavioral therapy in 240 patients suffering from
moderate to severe depression. Although the medication group got
better more quickly, after four months, 57% of patients in each group
had improved.</TE>
<TE>   Those who showed improvement were then followed for an additional
year. During the follow-up period, cognitive therapy patients fared
much better: Three-quarters of them remained symptom-free, compared
with 60% of patients on medication, and 19% on a placebo.</TE>
<TE>   "People treated with cognitive behavioral therapy get well and are
more likely to stay well because they've learned skills to deal with
their depression," says DeRubeis, one of the study co-authors. "And
for someone who is prone to multiple episodes of depression, this is
a good alternative to SSRIs."</TE>
<TE>   Traditional therapy, in which patients rummage through the debris
of their childhoods to pinpoint the source of self-destructive
behaviors, doesn't appear to work as well in banishing the blues,
researchers say.</TE>
<TE>   Light Against Darkness</TE>
<TE>   For years, light therapy has been used to treat seasonal affective
disorder, a type of depression that afflicts about one in 10 people
who live in places with short winter days and extended darkness. Now,
growing evidence indicates that being bathed at least 30 minutes a
day in bright artificial light may be as effective as an
antidepressant at any time of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The therapy approximates the brightness of sunlight using a
specially designed light box that emits 5,000 to 10,000 lux, which is
a measure of the amount of light received in the eye. The brightness
is equivalent to the intensity of sunlight about 40 minutes after
sunrise.</TE>
<TE>   The mood-boosting effects can kick in almost immediately,
researchers say. In comparison, antidepressants may require a month
of use before their effects are felt.</TE>
<TE>   Cumming, who tried the therapy as a last resort after nearly a
year of severe depression, was surprised by the results--as was his
doctor. His depression had proved resistant to conventional
medication.</TE>
<TE>   He now periodically sits in front of a light box when he feels
himself backsliding into depression.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists speculate that when people's body clocks, or circadian
rhythms, get out of sync, they produce too much of the hormone
melotonin, creating a biochemical imbalance in the brain region that
regulates mood, energy and sleep. "Somehow, the bright light shifts
the body clock," says Kripke, who has researched light therapy for
more than two decades.</TE>
<TE>   In a 2002 study of 16 pregnant women with major depression, an
hour's exposure to a 10,000-lux light box improved their symptoms by
49% after three weeks, a response rate comparable to antidepressants.
Scientists are gearing up for a larger, five-year test of this
therapy on pregnant women.</TE>
<TE>   "This is important because the use of medication by pregnant women
is not risk-free and there is possible harm to the unborn fetus,"
says Michael Terman, a study co-author and psychiatry professor at
Columbia University in New York. "If we can nip the depression in the
bud during pregnancy, we may also be able to prevent postpartum
depression and its often horrific effects."</TE>
<TE>   Supplemental Remedies</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most popular alternative remedy for depression is St.
John's wort. Although two recent studies found that it didn't work as
well as a placebo in alleviating major depression, the herb has shown
promise in treating mild depression.</TE>
<TE>   Side effects include nausea, heartburn, insomnia and an increased
sensitivity to sunlight. It also can weaken the effect of
prescription medications such as the blood thinner warfarin, the
heart medication digitalis, some AIDS drugs and oral contraceptives.
Still, "people should consider it as an option, especially if they
haven't done well on other medications," says Dr. David Mischoulon, a
psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School.</TE>
<TE>   Another dietary supplement, SAM-e, may also help combat
depression. Produced from a yeast derivative, SAM-e was introduced to
the U.S. in 1999. Backed by 40 studies done in Europe, the
over-the-counter remedy was touted as a fast-acting antidote to
depression with none of conventional medication's side effects. Some
depression sufferers find SAM-e (short for s-adenosylmethiodine, a
substance found naturally in the body that is believed to fuel dozens
of biochemical reactions) more tolerable than an SSRI.</TE>
<TE>   Timothy Dickey, for instance, a 33-year-old Los Angeles writer,
took Prozac for more than a year but didn't like the numbing effect
it had on his emotions, or the dry mouth and mild anxiety it caused.
With SAM-e, he says, his depression vanished within days. "I feel
more resilient and fortified against the daily stresses of life that
in the past would have gotten me down," says Dickey, who takes a
20-milligram tablet each day.</TE>
<TE>   Growing anecdotal reports about the efficacy of SAM-e, which seems
to work by enhancing the action of two mood-regulating brain
chemicals--serotonin and dopamine--have prompted mainstream doctors
to take a look. Harvard researchers are now testing the supplement in
combination with SSRIs such as Prozac and Zoloft on severely
depressed patients whose symptoms aren't eased by conventional drugs.</TE>
<TE>   SAM-e, however, may trigger episodes of mania in people with
bipolar disorder. It's also difficult to know if you're getting a
therapeutic dose of SAM-e in supplements sold in health food stores.</TE>
<TE>   "A few brands are OK," says Dr. Richard P. Brown, a Columbia
University psychiatrist who's used SAM-e successfully on several
severely depressed patients who didn't respond to antidepressants.
"But a lot of them are mediocre or worthless. That's why people
should consult with their doctors before they use them."</TE>
<TE>   Acupuncture</TE>
<TE>   Acupuncture may be an effective mood enhancer as well. In a 1999
study conducted by University of Arizona researchers, 34 women
suffering from major depression who underwent eight weeks of
acupuncture treatment reported an elevation in mood similar to that
provided by antidepressants. The finding reinforced earlier studies
in the former Soviet Union and China. The Arizona researchers, along
with scientists at Stanford University, are conducting a larger study
of 150 women.</TE>
<TE>   "While the initial results were encouraging," says Rachel Manber,
a Stanford University psychologist and research team member, "they
aren't conclusive.... But this might be a viable option for women who
are pregnant or lactating and don't want to take medication."</TE>
<TE>   Rx: Exercise</TE>
<TE>   Numerous studies have shown regular exercise to be an excellent
antidote for mild to moderate depression. And over the long haul,
researchers say,  it may work better than medication in controlling
symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   "We still don't understand the mechanisms behind this--whether
it's a change in brain chemistry or they just feel better because
they mastered something challenging," says James Blumenthal, a Duke
University psychologist and coauthor of a 2000 study on the long-term
effects of exercise.</TE>
<TE>   "But we do know it works."</TE>
<TE>   Duke researchers studied the effects of exercise on 156 volunteers
over age 50 who were diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. The
test subjects were given a regimen of exercise, medication or a
combination of both.</TE>
<TE>   After 16 weeks, all three groups' progress against depression was
similar, although those who took antidepressants got faster relief
from their symptoms. However, a follow-up study 10 months later found
that the exercise groups had a significantly lower relapse rate than
those on medication only. And the more participants exercised, the
better they felt.</TE>
<TE>   That's certainly what happened to Gary Watkins. Every winter, the
56-year-old Durham, N.C., man would lapse into an ever-deepening funk
as the days got shorter. He tried an SSRI, but it stunted his
emotions, so he stopped taking it. Yet he knew he had to do
something.</TE>
<TE>   Enrolling in the Duke University study got him started on a
regular exercise regimen that he continues to this day.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to get yourself moving when you're depressed," says
Watkins, who still works out on the treadmill on his lunch hour and
runs cross-country. "But for me, exercise is the best way to control
my depression."</TE>

<HD>Light Therapy May Help Diabetics' Vision</HD>

<LD>Sleeping with a light on may help prevent diabetics from developing a
serious complication that can lead to blindness, according to a new
study by British researchers.</LD>
<LD>   The research, published last week in the British science journal
the Lancet, suggests that even exposure to ordinary light levels
through closed eyelids could prevent diabetic retinopathy, a
condition that affects up to half of all diabetics.</LD>
<LD>   Diabetes can damage tiny blood vessels in the light-sensitive
tissue at the back of the eye, called the retina, causing them to
weaken and cloud vision.</LD>
<TE>   Diabetic retinopathy has no early warning signs. The blood vessels
can bleed and leave a few specks of blood or spots which may
disappear but sometimes do not clear. Large hemorrhages can happen
more than once and often occur during sleep.</TE>
<TE>   Standard treatments for the condition include laser surgery or, in
advanced cases, an eye operation called a vitrectomy to remove the
leakage. The drawbacks are that both treatments can be costly and can
lead to side effects such as loss of peripheral vision.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers from Cardiff University in Wales found that oxygen
inhalation increased retinal cell activity. Exposure to light
decreases the amount of oxygen consumed by the retina, lessening a
diabetic's chance of visual impairment.</TE>
<TE>   When Neville Drasdo, a Cardiff researcher, and his colleagues
studied the impact of nighttime light on seven patients with Type 2,
or adult onset, diabetes and eight healthy volunteers, they found it
helped to counteract the impact of the darkness in the diabetics.</TE>
<TE>   The findings of the small study "encourage the belief that there
may be a major breakthrough in the prevention of [diabetic
retinopathy]," said Drasdo, a professor in the university's
department of optometry and vision sciences. "However, more research
is needed before we could recommend immediate implementation of the
idea. Some adverse effects might be possible."</TE>
<TE>   Drasdo said it is unknown at this stage how much of an effect
sleeping with the lights on would have or what kind of light would be
necessary.</TE>

<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As we were recently reminded, super-sizing fast food may seem
economical, but it turns out to be a drain on the wallet and a lousy
nutritional bargain.</LD>
<LD>   A study presented two weeks ago by the National Alliance for
Nutrition and Activity, a group of 225 national, state and local
health organizations, found that:</LD>
<LD>   * Double Gulp, the 64-ounce soft drink at 7-Eleven, costs $1.26,
or 42% more than the 16-ounce Gulp and packs 450 additional
calories--more than you'd get in a McDonald's Quarter Pounder.</LD>
<TE>   * At Subway, a 12-inch tuna sub costs $4.82, or $1.23 more than
the 6-inch sub. The 12-inch sub also has 840 calories--420 more than
the 6-inch.</TE>
<TE>   * A double-scoop chocolate chip ice cream cone at Baskin-Robbins
costs $1.62 more than a Kids scoop (yes, adults can order them, too)
and delivers 390 additional calories. That works out to 129% greater
cost for 260% more calories.</TE>
<TE>   * Super-sized fries at McDonald's will set you back $1.90, nearly
double the $1.03 cost for the small size--and add an extra 400
calories.</TE>
<TE>   "We all love to get a bargain," says Margo Wootan, director of
nutrition policy at the Washington-based Center for Science in the
Public Interest, which was involved in the study.</TE>
<TE>   With super-sizing, she says, "you may get more food, but you're
still paying more money to get it, and you don't need those extra
calories."</TE>
<TE>   So if you're not going to save money--or your health--by upsizing
your fast food, what can you do to eat well on a budget? It's a topic
close to many readers' hearts.</TE>
<TE>   Hit the farmers markets about half an hour before closing time,
suggested one person in a recent online discussion:</TE>
<TE>   "They sell produce at insanely low prices because they can't keep
it fresh overnight. I've been able to score lettuce heads for 12
cents apiece and a pound of fresh tomatoes for about 50 cents. And
don't forget about fresh corn: always filling, tons of ways to cook
it and some places it's about 10 to 12 ears for a couple of bucks!"</TE>
<TE>   Another person recommended shopping at large ethnic markets: The
markets feature "a host of items--including tofu in various
forms--for a fraction of the cost at organic markets, noodles in
every shape and size, including fresh udon and lo mein, tortillas in
bulk, dried mushrooms and many different kinds of dried and canned
beans."</TE>
<TE>   A native of India makes her own yogurt for both taste and cost.
Her recipe: Boil whole milk (you can also use lower-fat varieties).
Turn off the heat and let it cool to a lukewarm temperature. Then
pour into ovenproof containers and add a teaspoon of plain
store-brought yogurt to each container. "This is only for the first
time," she noted. (After that, use the yogurt you made for the
starter.) "I can hear my kids screaming, 'Mom can we finish all the
yogurt off or do you need it for the next batch?' Then preheat the
oven to about 170 degrees, turn off the oven and plop the containers
inside. Next morning, you will have perfect yogurt. You will never
buy yogurt from the store once you have tasted homemade yogurt."</TE>
<TE>   Another reader pinches pennies by going meatless for part of the
week. Without that expense, she said, "you can splurge on special
veggies or fruits, or throw it back in the family budget."</TE>
<TE>   A reader from North Carolina uses her bread machine to make
whole-grain loaves for less than a dollar each--a bargain if you
happen to have a bread maker. If you don't, there are better ways to
shrink your food budget, including buying "a billion and one bean and
rice dishes," as the reader noted. "Just about every culture has its
own version ... chickpeas and Indian curry over rice, Armenian
lentils and bulgur wheat, black beans and rice with salsa. All cheap
and yummy and healthful."</TE>
<TE>   One Washington resident on a limited budget makes a game of
grocery shopping. "At the beginning of the week, I load up on basics:
deli turkey, cheese, chicken breasts, beans (usually black beans or
whatever is on sale), frozen veggies, oatmeal, yogurt, whole-wheat
tortillas ... then use those basics to create meals throughout the
week. I supplement daily with fresh produce that I pick up on the way
home from work, as that is relatively cheap and goes bad fairly
quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Another reader noted that some markets will knock off up to 5% on
case or bulk orders.</TE>
<TE>   To arrange for the discount, "call ahead and talk to the
department head," says Dean Shaffer, grocery team leader for the
Whole Foods store in Washington.</TE>

<HD>Hopes for an Age-Old Remedy</HD>
<DH>Researchers say guggul tree extract, used for more than
2,500 years in India, lives up to its reputation in lowering
cholesterol.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- A traditional remedy approved in India for lowering
cholesterol appears to work, researchers say, and in a way that might
lead to the development of improved drugs.</LD>
<LD>   The resin of the guggul tree has been used in Indian traditional
medicine for more than 2,500 years, and more recently has been
enlisted to fight high cholesterol.</LD>
<LD>   David Moore of the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston found the
guggul extract lives up to its reputation.</LD>
<TE>   "It really does lower cholesterol in a number of clinical studies
in the Indian literature," Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   Writing in a recent issue of the journal Science, he said it has
been used in Indian Ayurvedic medicine since at least 600 BC to treat
obesity and other disorders. Moore's team found the steroid
guggulsterone, the active agent in the guggul extract, blocks
activity of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) on cells.</TE>
<TE>   FXR helps regulate cholesterol by affecting levels of bile acids,
which are produced from cholesterol and released by the liver. "Bile
acids are the only way that cholesterol has to get out of the body,"
Moore said in a telephone interview. "We knew that FXR was a key
regulator of cholesterol metabolism."</TE>
<TE>   Moore wanted to study FXR more, so he looked for compounds known
to lower cholesterol whose mechanism of action was not understood. "I
spent quite a lot of time clicking around the Internet," he said. He
found guggulsterone, along with niacin--a B vitamin regularly
prescribed for cholesterol patients--and red wine.</TE>
<TE>   Red wine and niacin were not strongly enough involved with FXR to
interest him, but gugulipid, available in health food stores in the
United States, was.</TE>
<TE>   Tests in mice showed guggul extract lowers cholesterol by blocking
the effects of FXR. "We put mice on a high cholesterol diet for a
week, and measure cholesterol levels in the liver," said Moore, who
worked with colleagues at the University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center in Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   "In normal mice, you feed them cholesterol and the cholesterol
level in the liver goes up. But if you feed them cholesterol and give
them guggulsterone at the same time, the cholesterol levels stay the
same," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mice bred to lack FXR did not respond to guggul.</TE>
<TE>   Moore, who with colleagues has set up a small biotechnology
company, said it might be possible to more specifically target FXR
with a drug. The company has patented FXR. "As a pharmaceutical
company, you are not going to be interested in producing something
that is already available, but you are going to be interested in
producing something that is better," Moore said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"A New Way to Treat Alcoholism" (June 17) offers hope for a more
scientific solution to the problem. Unfortunately, the article also
shows that the medical establishment continues to act as if
Alcoholics Anonymous were a self-help support group when in fact it
is a religious organization. No one attending an AA meeting can
escape the fact that the "cure" that is offered is basically
conversion to a belief in God.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, despite the tent-revival ethos of it, most--if not
all--alcohol and drug treatment centers rely heavily on AA to help
their patients recover. This muddle of medical practice, pop
psychology and religious revivalism may work for a chosen few who
have the gift of faith, but it also may account for the high failure
rate among alcohol and drug abuse patients, which even the best
treatment centers acknowledge is a major problem.</LD>
<LD>   A rational scientific approach is long overdue, and may be the
only hope for those patients who are not amenable to religious
conversion.</LD>

<LD>In "How Patients' Rights Can Harm Treatment" (June 24), the

to be discharged to a setting where his compliance can be monitored."
How brisk. How efficient. And how wrong.</LD>

prescribed, there are many valid reasons why others might prefer
other approaches. Unfortunately, many psychiatrists today are
primarily trained to only prescribe pills, and have little else to

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I lift weights at home alone at 4:30 a.m., and I don't have
anyone around to spot me. What would be my maximum weight, and how
can I test it on the bench press without risking injuries?</LD>
<LD>   ERIC WEEKS</LD>
<LD>   Olema, Calif.</LD>
<TE>   Answer: Let's look at this mathematically. The amount of weight we
can lift 10 times is roughly three-fourths of the maximum any of us
could lift once. So if you can do 10 repetitions at 100 pounds, your
maximum is likely to be about 135 pounds (100 divided by 0.75).
Although this is great in theory, I wouldn't put it into practice
without a spotter, because the intensity of our strength-training
sessions varies from day to day. If you're particularly tired one
day, for example, you could get hurt.</TE>
<TE>   But training to failure (performing an exercise until you
physically can't push or pull the weight anymore) isn't the only way
to gain strength. For example, because an old inner-ear injury now
limits the amount of heavy weight I can lift, I've been using
pre-exhaustion training (supersets to build maximum muscle without
the need for maximum weight) to gain strength. Here's an example:</TE>
<TE>   * Load a weight you can lift safely six times onto your
bench-press bar.</TE>
<TE>   * Choose a second move that isolates your chest (such as dumbbell
flies) and use a weight that will let you do 12 repetitions.</TE>
<TE>   * Do five repetitions of the bench press, then immediately do six
to 10 chest flies.</TE>
<TE>   * Rest two to three minutes and repeat both exercises.</TE>
<TE>   Aim to do four sets.</TE>

<LD>American Council on Science and Health</LD>
<LD>   acsh.org</LD>
<LD>   Background: The council is an independent, nonprofit consumer
education group that focuses on food, nutrition and environmental
issues, drawing on the knowledge of about 350 doctors, researchers
and policy experts. The Web site functions as a magazine of articles
and essays on popular topics.</LD>
<TE>   What Works: The site is skeptical on almost any topic, whether
it's hysteria over the threat of a "dirty" nuclear device or worries
that fried food is causing cancer. By simply exposing the lack of
evidence behind many health claims--that we need to drink eight
glasses of water a day, for instance, or that drinking green tea
prevents cancer--the site provides a soothing antidote to the endless
miracle cures and health fears being shopped in ads and news stories
each day. The information here comes mostly in small bites, though,
in news releases, short essays and commentary from the council's
president. For more depth, you'll have to pay for pamphlets and other
publications.</TE>

<LD>Kelly Hall, 34, was in fantastic shape, routinely biking 100 to 200
miles a week in preparation for last year's AIDS Ride from Boston to
New York. Usually, she trained with other riders, who made it a point
to take food and hydration breaks. But one day last June, Hall
decided to ride alone, despite the 95-degree heat.</LD>
<LD>   The first 50 miles, around Concord, Mass., were a breeze. "I
thought I'd do another 25," she recalls. She drank a little Gatorade,
a sports drink designed to restore normal blood levels of
electrolytes, but relied mostly on water, constantly sipping from the
70-ounce CamelBak water supply on her back.</LD>
<LD>   Halfway through the last loop, hyponatremia, a relatively rare but
potentially fatal condition in which blood levels of sodium sink
dangerously low, "hit like a ton of bricks," says Hall. She finished
her ride "really, really slowly," got back to her car, threw up,
drove home and threw up again. She made it to Brigham and Women's
Hospital, where she had a grand mal seizure.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly the same thing happened to Sarah Snyder, 45, who was
training with friends for another long, benefit ride. She, too, was
in good condition and, she too, dutifully sipped water for 56 miles.</TE>
<TE>   But after her ride, she threw up violently and was rushed to the
hospital, where she drifted in and out of consciousness for 18 hours.
"You drank too much water. You screwed up your sodium," the doctors
told her.</TE>
<TE>   Full-blown cases of hyponatremia (sometimes called water
intoxication) are relatively rare, roughly 0.1% to 4% of people who
sweat steadily for hours in grueling, long-distance events, says
Scott Montain, a research physiologist at the U.S. Army Research
Institute of Environmental Medicine. The incidence of hyponatremia
appears to be highest in events lasting more than four hours,
especially at high temperatures. But the prevalence of warning
symptoms is much higher--up to 27% of athletes who seek attention in
a medical tent during a long race.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, conscientious athletes get in trouble because they
adhere too diligently to one recommendation (drink lots of fluids)
but ignore another (keep electrolytes up). (Electrolytes are charged
particles such as sodium, potassium, calcium and bicarbonate that
must be kept in near-perfect balance). For most marathoners, Montain
says, the real problem is drinking too much water, not failing to
take in enough sodium.</TE>
<TE>   Women in particular, may be at risk, some researchers believe, in
part because they may be too dutiful about drinking water.</TE>
<TE>   "When you sweat, you lose both water and salt," says Dr. Soheyla
Gharib, medical director of the women's health center at Brigham and
Women's Hospital. "If you replace only water, the salt level in the
blood gets diluted."</TE>
<TE>   And that can be disastrous. Normally, the body tries to keep
positively and negatively charged electrolytes in balance to keep
cells electrically neutral, says Dr. Ronenn Roubenoff, associate
professor of medicine and nutrition and director of human studies at
the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center at Tufts
University. Though sodium is probably the most important electrolyte
for endurance athletes to worry about, he says, "an imbalance of any
one of the electrolytes can be harmful."</TE>
<TE>   Normally, sodium is plentiful in the blood and relatively low
inside cells. But when the concentration in the blood gets too low
compared to the amount inside cells--either because a person drank
too much water, took in too little sodium, or both--water rushes into
cells. "Water follows sodium as day follows night," Roubenoff says.</TE>
<TE>   The result is dangerous swelling--particularly in the brain--that
can lead to brain damage, coma and death. Curiously, hyponatremia can
occur whether a person is dehydrated, normally hydrated or
overhydrated because any of those conditions can happen while blood
levels of sodium are too low, adds Roubenoff.</TE>
<TE>   Further complicating things is that the symptoms of hyponatremia
can be easily confused with those of heatstroke and heat exhaustion.
With heat exhaustion (also called exertional heat injury), people
feel ill, become nauseated, have muscle cramps and may feel dizzy
standing up quickly. With heatstroke, people have all those symptoms
plus mental status changes--that is, confusion about who and where
they are and what day it is. People with genuine heatstroke also
typically have extremely high body temperatures.</TE>
<TE>   With hyponatremia, people also feel very ill and may have mental
status changes but don't have the high temperatures of heatstroke.
They also vomit forcefully and repeatedly and, unlike those with heat
exhaustion, do not feel better by resting and cooling off.</TE>
<TE>   Treatment of hyponatremia may involve restricting fluid intake and
promoting urine production, but some people also need intravenous
saltwater (saline) with a high concentration of salt, until blood
electrolytes return to normal. Resetting the water-salt balance "must
be done carefully and slowly," cautions Dr. Gabriel Danovitch,
professor of medicine at UCLA School of Medicine, because overly
rapid correction of electrolyte imbalance can cause further problems.</TE>
<TE>   As dangerous as the condition is, even people like Snyder and Hall
who wind up with severe hyponatremia can have happy endings. Snyder
"feels as good as new" and has stockpiled sports drinks and plans to
get back to biking soon.</TE>
<TE>   And Hall? She did give up biking for the rest of last summer, but
the consolation was that she had more time to plan her wedding.</TE>

<HD>One Key to Prevention: Watch Your Sweat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Judy Foreman</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To protect yourself against hyponatremia, start by paying attention
to how much you sweat.</LD>
<LD>   In general, women sweat less than men and their ability to
regulate core body temperature (and sweating) may vary with different
phases of the menstrual cycle. Individuals also vary considerably in
how much sodium they lose in sweat. You may be a heavy sodium loser
if your sweat burns your eyes, tastes salty or leaves a cakey-white
residue on your skin. Sweat contains one to two grams of sodium per
liter--and since it's easy to lose a liter of perspiration in a long
race, that means you're losing this much sodium too.</LD>
<LD>   You can replace two grams of sodium with about a half-teaspoon of
salt. You can also make sure you're getting enough sodium by drinking
sports drinks such as Accelerade, Cytomax, Gpush or Gatorade instead
of plain water during long events. (Check the labels for sodium
content; some brands have twice the sodium of others.)</LD>
<TE>   Sports drinks also typically contain carbohydrates, which provide
energy and help with water and sodium absorption. These sports drinks
are similar to Pedialyte and other oral rehydration solutions used to
treat children who become dangerously dehydrated.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't like sports drinks, you could take salt tablets, but
they may make you nauseated. At the very least, you can eat salty
foods before and during a big event.</TE>
<TE>   You can gauge how much fluid you're losing by weighing yourself
before and after half an hour of exercise. (Don't drink anything
between weigh-ins.) If you lose a pound in half an hour, your sweat
rate is two pounds per hour, which means you need to replace that
much fluid. (Two pounds of fluid is 32 ounces.)</TE>
<TE>   As a practical matter, you're probably not in any danger from
dehydration unless you lose more than 2% to 3% of your body weight
during exercise, but you can't rely on thirst to guide you because by
the time you're thirsty, you may already be dehydrated. So the goal
is to adjust your fluid intake to how much you sweat.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, for ordinary mortals who work out for less than an hour,
sports drinks are unnecessary--and plain old water (along with the
salt you normally get in food) will do just fine, says Roger
Fielding, an exercise physiologist at Boston University.</TE>
<TE>   For endurance athletes doing events longer than an hour and
sweating profusely, it's probably wise to drink 6 to 8 ounces of
fluid every 20 minutes to prevent excessive dehydration and
hyponatremia, says Scott Montain, a research physiologist at the U.S.
Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   For events lasting longer than two hours, you're probably better
off with a carbohydrate-electrolyte sports drink than plain water.
But don't drink more than 40 ounces (1 1/4 quarts) per hour--that's
erring toward excess fluid intake, cautions Montain.</TE>

<HD>The Sauna: A Good Sweat or a Bad Risk?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BENEDICT CAREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For millions of Americans, a few minutes in the sauna or steam room
is akin to therapy: They bare themselves, get good advice, sweat a
little--and walk out minutes later feeling somehow cleansed. If there
are serious health risks from all that heat, they seem mostly
reserved for bad guys in old mobster films who got locked in.</LD>
<LD>   Yet YMCA officials now say otherwise. Late last month, the YMCA of
Metropolitan Los Angeles abruptly and permanently shut down all its
steam rooms and saunas. The closures, in eight of its 26 facilities,
followed a June 4 fire that authorities believe started in a sauna
and caused $1 million in damage at the Westchester YMCA.</LD>
<LD>   The fire prompted the YMCA to closely examine all health and
safety risks in the heated rooms, said Larry Rosen, president of the
Los Angeles YMCAs.</LD>
<TE>   "What doctors tell us is that the rooms should not be used before
or after strenuous exercise--and that's exactly when people use
them," he said. Rosen said the YMCA stopped building the heated rooms
in new facilities 16 years ago, because of growing concerns over
their safety. Because people in saunas and steam rooms are behind
closed doors, it is difficult for YMCA staff to monitor them for
signs of trouble, Rosen said. "We simply have no way of preventing
people from using them improperly."</TE>
<TE>   The most serious health risk is heart failure, doctors say, and
it's significant, especially in those who have an unstable heart
condition. Once in a steam room or sauna, the body works to cool
itself. At first, blood pressure and heart rate go up slightly, as
blood is pumped to the skin to vent fluids, according to Dr. Susan
Lewis, an orthopedic surgeon at the Center for Sports Medicine in San
Francisco. As muscles relax, blood pressure begins to drop, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now the heart is working harder but getting less blood flow,"
Lewis said. "If you have someone in not great shape, with a heart
condition, blood flow is already restricted. That's when you get a
problem, like a heart attack."</TE>
<TE>   Rosen would not say how many serious problems have occurred in
YMCA saunas and steam rooms. "All I can say is that we get about one
incident a month, from dizziness to something more serious," he said.
Though he didn't know the rate of serious injury on basketball courts
or in pools, Rosen estimated that about 75% of emergency calls made
from YMCA locations come from the eight facilities with saunas and
steam rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Other Southland clubs said they have had no problems with their
saunas and steam rooms, and have no intention of closing them.
"They're very popular," said Ken Marshall, manager of the Spectrum
Club in Los Angeles. "Some people don't even work out. They just come
in to take a shower and a steam or sauna."</TE>
<TE>   Most healthy people can easily handle heat immersion of 110
degrees (in a steam room) to 180 degrees (in a sauna) for a short
period--five to 10 minutes, doctors say. The exceptions include
children younger than 12; people who are on medications that affect
blood pressure or heart rhythm; and pregnant women, whose bodies are
already diverting significant amounts of blood to the baby, said Dr.
Paul Thompson, a cardiologist at Hartford Hospital in Hartford, Conn.
"For most everyone else," he said, "I don't think [saunas and steam
rooms] are dangerous at all, if they're used responsibly."</TE>
<TE>   It's when people "tough out" long sessions of more than 10 or 15
minutes in the heat--often after having worked out--that they can get
into trouble, Lewis said. Though the first symptoms of heat
exhaustion, dizziness and headache, usually send people heading for
the door, some healthy people may feel more confusion than pain, she
said. "They may not realize they're not feeling so great, and pass
out from heat exhaustion," she said. "The 45-year-old CEO trying to
sweat it all off, or 18-year-old on the wrestling team trying to make
weight, sitting there in his sweatsuit: Those are the sorts of people
we typically treat for this."</TE>
<TE>   In an analysis of 158 deaths that occurred in spas, hot tubs and
saunas between 1985 and 1990, researchers at Oregon Health &amp; Science
University in Portland identified several major risk factors, besides
heart disease: seizure disorders, such as epilepsy; and the use of
drugs such as alcohol and cocaine, which elevate blood pressure and
heart rate. Seven of the deaths occurred in saunas; and 151 in spas
or hot tubs, more than a third of which were children under age 12,
many of whom drowned. In a larger review of 21 of the most
scientifically rigorous sauna studies, researchers at the University
of Ottawa in 2000 concluded that a five- to 10-minute sauna bath at
normal temperatures was safe even for heart disease patients, as long
as their condition was stable, said lead author Marja Leena Keast, a
heart rehabilitation specialist.</TE>
<TE>   The American College of Sports Medicine recommends temperatures of
between 170 and 180 degrees for saunas, and between 100 and 110 for
steam rooms. For those who've never immersed themselves in such heat,
experts recommend starting slowly. "In places like Finland and
Germany and Japan, people are acclimatized," Keast said. "They're
taking saunas or steams once a week for most of their lives."</TE>
<TE>   Many YMCA members are peeved about the closures. At the Hollywood
YMCA last week, printouts of angry e-mails were pasted to the steam
room door and members gathered to read and grumble. Some members have
canceled memberships, others have written letters of protest and a
few have accused the YMCA of trying to trim insurance or staff costs
at the expense of members. Rosen says cost savings were not a
consideration.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a premium differential to cover the risks of saunas and
steam rooms," he said, "but we're self-insured. It was not a money
decision for us." He said he has fielded more than 130 calls, letters
and e-mails protesting the closure, and at least a third of those
people have canceled their memberships or say they plan to do so.
"They're walking out really mad," he said, "and we're sorry to lose
them."</TE>
<TE>   Longtime users believe the benefits of a sauna or steam outweigh
any risk. "I know the benefits I get: It's good for my skin, for
mental clarity; I walk out feeling like a new person," said Chuck
Spain, 46, a longtime member of the Downey YMCA. "For 150 years the
'Y' has been teaching common sense, and now it's trying to regulate
common sense. If there's a risk, I'm willing to take it."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond any potential health benefits, some longtime YMCA members
say the sauna and steam rooms served a social purpose as well. "I'd
go to the Hollywood 'Y' to play handball, get my clock cleaned by
some guy twice my age, then go get a steam," said Richard Beedle, a
51-year-old insurance broker. "There were always a few wise, old
birds in there talking. I loved just listening to them."</TE>
<TE>   Said Spain: "There's a camaraderie in the steam room. It's a
community in there.... It's not only good for the body. You're
communing with people."</TE>

<HD>UV Protection Comes at Any Price</HD>
<DH>Sunglasses* Cheap brands are as likely to block ultraviolet

<LD>Although sunglass claims increase each year, their most important
health feature--blockage of ultraviolet, or UV, rays--is as likely to
be offered on $10 drugstore shades as on designer brands, according
to the American Academy of Ophthalmology.</LD>
<LD>   Exposure to UV radiation increases the risk of cataracts, a
clouding of the eye's natural lens. In 1988, doctors who studied 838
Chesapeake Bay watermen found those who wore no eye protection had
three times as many cataracts as the others. UV exposure can also
lead to macular degeneration, retina damage that is the major cause
of blindness among Americans older than 55.</LD>

screens out UV-A rays--which constitute more than 90% of ultraviolet
radiation and are most intense in the early morning and
afternoon--and UV-B rays, most pronounced at midday. Widely available
spectrum scans--which measure the UV light passing through a
lens--let consumers check for UV protection before buying.</LD>
<TE>   Sunglass standards set by the American National Standards
Institute, a nonprofit, nongovernmental organization, are voluntary.
But Commerce Department regulations bar manufacturers from falsely
labeling claims like UV protection.</TE>
<TE>   Even contact lenses that claim to be UV-absorbing have not been
proven to shield against sun-caused eye diseases, and the academy
recommends that people who wear contacts use sunglasses as well. The
American College of Preventive Medicine reports that UV light, most
intense in summer, is increasing worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Other sunglass features that merit attention, according to eye
experts, include:</TE>
<TE>   * Optical clarity. Wearing lenses that are optically precise and
distortion-free helps prevent eyestrain and fatigue. Test for
distortion by turning your head while looking through the glasses at
a pole or a tree; a pole that appears to waver indicates a minor
distortion. The priciest lenses aren't always the best here. A study
in the Journal of the American Optometric Assn. found that Revo and
Serengeti, the two most expensive of six designer sunglasses tested,
had the poorest optical accuracy.</TE>
<TE>   * Fit. Glasses should be close-fitting and large enough to cover
your entire eye, including your eyelid. Wraparound lenses may offer
added protection.</TE>
<TE>   * Tint. Get whatever color pleases you. According to the academy,
darker-tinted sunglasses don't block more UV rays than
lighter-colored lenses.</TE>
<TE>   * Polarized lenses. Useful for driving, boating and fishing, these
minimize the sun's reflection or glare from smooth surfaces like
pavement or water. Polarization, however, has nothing to do with UV
protection.</TE>
<TE>   * Infrared protection. While sunlight contains some infrared
light, research has not linked it closely with eye disease.</TE>
<TE>   * Blue-blocking. Scientists disagree on whether blue light poses a
risk to the eye, but this is not a high-priority summer concern,
since the greatest exposure to blue light comes from snow reflection.</TE>
<TE>   * Mirror-coated. A thin metallic coating reduces the amount of
light entering your eyes and may be handy to hide behind, but it
doesn't protect fully against UV rays.</TE>
<TE>   Parental note: Infants and children are more vulnerable to UV
damage than adults. Eye experts recommend keeping children out of the
sun between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., when UV rays are strongest. Since eye
damage from the sun is cumulative, they also recommend wearing
sunglasses year-round.</TE>

<HD>Diet That Helps the Heart Includes Whole Grains</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By now, most people know that reducing saturated fat and
cholesterol-rich foods can reduce the risk of heart disease. But
scientists are now convinced that eating more whole grain foods could
also protect our arteries.</LD>
<LD>   For centuries, grains such as wheat, corn, oats and rye have been
the mainstay of the human diet. From pasta in Italy to rice in China,
the variety of grain products eaten throughout the world is nothing
short of amazing. Yet today, the majority of grain is eaten in
refined form. This means that the dark outer parts of the grain--the
germ and the bran--have been removed through the milling process,
leaving just the starchy white endosperm for our consumption.</LD>
<LD>   In the case of wheat, for example, this endosperm can be ground
into refined white flour and used to make white bread. But milling
and refining do not just change the color of our cereal-based foods.
Milling results in major losses of vitamins, minerals and protective
plant nutrients, all of which are present in highest quantities in
the germ and bran.</LD>
<TE>   These include vitamin E, the vitamin B complex, and minerals like
zinc, selenium, iron, copper, magnesium and phosphorous. Proteins and
fibrous carbohydrates along with plant estrogens called lignans are
also lost. It is these nutrients and supernutrients that appear to
work together to help protect the heart.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers believe this action comes from the substances'
combined antioxidant action, which helps reduce damage to artery
walls and the buildup of cholesterol at such damaged sites. Studies
have shown that eating almost three servings of whole-grain foods a
day lowers the risk of heart disease by almost a third.</TE>
<TE>   The protective effects of whole grains also extend to cancer. In
the colon, for instance, they appear to counter the effects of
cancer-causing substances, increase fecal bulk and bind potential
carcinogens, speedily removing them from the bowel before they have
time to cause disease.</TE>
<TE>   In recognition of these properties, the Food and Drug
Administration allows some food labels to tout the benefits of
whole-grain foods in reducing the risk of heart disease and some
cancers.</TE>
<TE>   That said, it is important not to become too carried away with the
idea of the benefits of bran. Whole-grain cereals also contain
special types of fiber called phytates, which reduce the body's
absorption of minerals such as calcium (crucial for strong bones).
This effect is particularly strong when the grains are eaten in an
uncooked form, such as in unprocessed bran that is added to foods.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, however, it's a good idea to swap refined breakfast
cereals for whole-grain versions, white bread for whole wheat and
white rice and pasta for brown. Not only will you be helping your
heart, the fiber will make you feel fuller for longer. And they taste
great too.</TE>

<LD>Question: Why do jets leave a white trail in the sky?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: The cloud-like trails--called contrails, short for
"condensation trails"--are produced when water vapor in the engine
exhaust condenses and freezes in the cold atmosphere. The same effect
is seen when an automobile is started on a cold morning or when
people exhale in cold air. In those cases, however, the "clouds" do
not persist because the humidity in the air is low. How long the
contrails persist is a reflection of atmospheric conditions and can
be used to predict the weather. A thin, short-lived contrail
indicates low humidity, a sign of fair weather. A larger,
longer-lasting contrail can be formed when the air is very humid and
additional water vapor from the atmosphere freezes onto the ice
particles emitted from the plane; such a contrail suggests a storm is
coming.</LD>

<LD>Genes from genetically engineered canola are able to spread to other
fields but have only a modest effect, according to a study that found
pollen fertilizing seeds more than a mile away. Australian
researchers reported in the June 28 issue of Science that they
collected seeds from 63 fields near a canola crop that was
genetically modified to be herbicide-resistant. Canola is used to
make cooking oil.</LD>
<LD>   They found that the herbicide resistance spread to 63% of the
other canola fields and that the percentage of resistant genes in
seeds from those fields ranged from 0.2% to less than 0.03%. Some of
the fields were up to 1.8 miles away from the gene-modified crop. The
team said that the findings did not indicate any threat but that it
may be impossible to prevent with certainty any mixing of
gene-modified and conventional crops once the engineered crops are
planted in large fields.</LD>

<LD>British archeologists have found an Ice Age site they hope could
provide the strongest evidence yet that Neanderthals hunted mammoths.
Finds at the dig near Thetford in East Anglia, England, included
remains of mammoths, woolly rhinoceros and reindeer in close
proximity to several hand axes, thought to be for butchering animals.
The 50,000-year-old site, centering on a group of ponds, is thought
to have been a watering hole where Neanderthals, predecessors of
modern humans, may have herded in or awaited their prey.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists have hotly debated whether the squat, muscular
Neanderthals actually hunted large animals rather than scavenging
dead ones for meat. "This is the best evidence we've ever had for a
Neanderthal kill site; certainly in Britain, but it is also one of
the best in Europe," said David Miles, English Heritage's chief
archeologist.</LD>

<LD>Caffeine, a common stimulant, can kill slugs and snails and can
discourage slugs from munching on treated plants, suggesting a
possible approach to environmentally friendly pest control for
gardens and cropland, Hawaiian researchers reported in the June 27
issue of Nature. A team at the U.S. Department of Agriculture
research center in Hilo found, for example, that when they let slugs
bury themselves in potted soil and then applied a 2% caffeine
solution to the dirt, 92% died within two days.</LD>
<LD>   In another experiment, slugs tended to avoid eating cabbage leaves
that had been treated with caffeine. The team also found that
caffeine solutions killed mature orchid snails. It is not clear how

<HD>Tailing Comets for Clues to Life</HD>
<DH>NASA plans this month to launch Contour, its latest probe
to explore these celestial balls of dust and ice, which hold secrets
older than Earth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY SINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Comets are among the last of the solar system's mysteries, holding
secrets from the time before the birth of the planets. Scientists
have long been fascinated by these strange brews of ice and dust that
have been lighting up Earth's sky for billions of years.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists believe that early in the formation of the
solar system, the young Earth was bombarded with a rain of comets.
They have wondered if these small and mysterious visitors delivered
organic molecules to Earth that became the seeds of life.</LD>
<LD>   "Are we, indeed, the progeny of comets?" asked Joseph Veverka,
chairman of Cornell University's astronomy department.</LD>
<TE>   NASA is hoping its latest comet probe, Contour, will help answer
that tantalizing question. The spacecraft is scheduled to launch this
month from Cape Canaveral, Fla. Its launch window extends through
July 25.</TE>
<TE>   Contour (Comet Nucleus Tour) will embark on a four-year (and
perhaps longer), comet-chasing journey to study one of the "least
understood bodies of our solar system," said Veverka, who is the
mission's principal investigator.</TE>
<TE>   The spacecraft is expected to collect a treasure trove of gas,
dust and images as it makes the closest approach yet to the small
(often just a few miles wide) nugget of ice and dust at a comet's
core. The probe aims to come within 60 miles of its target, analyzing
chemical compounds in the comet's tail and snapping the best nucleus
pictures to date in the few minutes before its approach.</TE>
<TE>   Contour is NASA's second mission dedicated to cometary
exploration. It is part of a series of probes that will visit at
least five comets over the next decade, heralding a "golden age" of
cometary science, said Colleen Hartman, director of NASA's Solar
System Exploration Division.</TE>
<TE>   Contour is scheduled to make contact with comet Encke in 2003,
followed by an encounter with Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   One of its key missions is to explore the diversity of comets,
said Donald K. Yeomans, a scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena and one of the leaders of the Contour science
team.</TE>
<TE>   Encke is "a tough, blackened old comet" that has been in a close
orbit around the sun, he said. Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 is a "young,
fragile object" that journeyed to the inner solar system much more
recently. It broke into pieces in 1995, giving scientists
unprecedented access to the comet nucleus.</TE>
<TE>   Contour's instruments will collect data on the comets' composition
as it flies through the haze of speeding dust surrounding its
targets, sending information to Earth for detailed analysis.</TE>
<TE>   The information will help determine if the air we breathe, the
water in our oceans and the ingredients for life came from comets.</TE>
<TE>   A silver plate on the front of the spacecraft will collect specks
of dust, which will be analyzed by a spectrometer to determine their
chemical composition.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists will look at the ratio of deuterium, a heavy form of
hydrogen, to regular hydrogen in comet ice. If the ratio is similar
to that of Earth's water, it is likely that comets were the source of
our oceans, Yeomans said.</TE>
<TE>   By measuring gas ratios, the scientists will be able to determine
if Earth's atmosphere came from comets. Analysis of the comet's
organic molecules will help determine if they are similar to complex
compounds found on Earth.</TE>
<TE>   Contour will take detailed pictures of each comet's nucleus. These
images will be 25 times better than those taken by the European Space
Agency's Giotto, which flew by comet Halley in 1986 and was the first
spacecraft to get close enough to see a comet's core.</TE>
<TE>   Analysis of Giotto's data revealed that Halley was 80% water and
that the surface of the comet was covered in a layer of organic
molecules.</TE>
<TE>   NASA's first comet-chasing expedition was Deep Space 1, which was
launched in 1998. Its primary mission was to test instruments for
solar system exploration, but it flew by comet Borrelly in 2001,
collecting data that confirmed that comets are rich in complex
organic molecules.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers have also used telescopes to analyze the compounds
emitted from comets and found differences in the composition of comet
water that are linked to their area of origin.</TE>
<TE>   Measurements from telescopes and spacecraft show that water from
comets Halley and Hale-Bopp, which are thought to have originated far
from the sun, have a higher deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio than the
water in Earth's oceans.</TE>
<TE>   Comet Linear (named after the Lincoln Near Earth Asteroid Research
observatory) is thought to have formed in the warmer regions near
Jupiter. It is the first comet whose water seemed to have the same
isotopic composition as Earth's. Linear's nucleus mysteriously
vanished in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Contour's future after its two comet encounters is wide open. NASA
engineers have designed the spacecraft to be durable and flexible
enough to chase a bright new comet if one should appear in the
Earth's neighborhood, as Hale-Bopp did in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The spacecraft will use Earth "swingbys," in which Contour will
loop around the sun and return to Earth, to redirect its path toward
a comet without using excess rocket fuel. Its comet encounters will
take place very close to Earth--so close, in fact, that amateur
astronomers will be able to see the comets with binoculars.</TE>
<TE>   In 2004, NASA will launch its next mission, Deep Impact, which is
designed to send a copper projectile crashing into the surface of
comet Tempel 1. The projectile will create a crater so that the
mother spacecraft can make observations of its internal composition.
If successful, Deep Impact will be the first mission to probe beneath
the surface of a comet nucleus.</TE>
<TE>   The Stardust spacecraft, which was launched in 1999, is scheduled
to fly near comet Wild 2 in early 2004 and return to Earth two years
later with the first samples of comet dust.</TE>
<TE>   The European Space Agency's Rosetta will be launched in
January and will make the first attempt to land on a comet. It is
scheduled to reach its target, 46 P/Wirtanen, in 2011.</TE>
<TE>   Yeomans said the wealth of comet information that will be gleaned
in the coming decade could have another payoff: If comets turn out to
have usable quantities of water and other materials, they could be
the "fueling stations and watering holes of interplanetary
colonization."</TE>

<HD>The 100-Million Species Question: What Are They?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PRIYANKA SHARMA-SINDHAR</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An eclectic band of scientists, Silicon Valley millionaires and media
celebrities is mounting an ambitious effort to catalog every living
species on the planet within the next 25 years.</LD>
<LD>   From the bright sunflowers in the local park to the white-tailed
deer in Siberia, from the wild yam in South Africa to the pink
dolphin in the Amazon River--every living plant and animal is
supposed to make it onto the list.</LD>
<LD>   It is a grand--and perhaps overly optimistic--project, given that
it has taken Homo sapiens 2 1/2 centuries to identify just 1.5
million to 1.8 million species. Some scientists, such as Harvard
sociobiologist Edward O. Wilson, believe there could be well over 100
million species of animals, plants, insects and other living
organisms on Earth.</LD>
<TE>   But despite the size of the task, supporters of the All Species
Inventory Project believe the process of scanning all life on the
planet will eventually pay big dividends.</TE>
<TE>   "Discovering and understanding the diversity of life on Earth is
not just a grand intellectual challenge--it is also critically
important," said David M. Hillis, professor of integrative biology at
the University of Texas at Austin. "The fact is that we are largely
ignorant of our own planet and how it works."</TE>
<TE>   So far, about 70 scientists from around the world have joined the
effort, which is being organized and managed by the not-for-profit
All Species Foundation in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   The list of advisors to the foundation includes Oxford
evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, Wired magazine founding
editor Kevin Kelly and Whole Earth Catalog creator Stewart Brand.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation hopes that names like these will help draw the
estimated $3 billion to $5 billion it will take to complete the
directory. It is focusing its fund-raising efforts on the enormous
private wealth generated by the New Economy.</TE>
<TE>   The organization's founding grant of $1 million came from
foundation advisor Evert I. Schlinger, professor emeritus of
entomology at UC Berkeley. In addition, the Gordon and Betty Moore
Foundation, established by Intel Corp. co-founder Gordon Moore, has
contributed $56,000; and Shel Kaphan, Amazon.com's first employee and
former chief technology officer, has contributed $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   While few scientists dispute the value of an inventory of life,
some have questioned the effectiveness of the project, saying that
cataloging every living thing is simply unrealistic.</TE>
<TE>   "These sorts of things are very useful to raise public
consciousness, but what worries me is that it is inherently
unachievable," said Craig Moritz, professor of molecular evolution at
UC Berkeley. "Why are we, as scientists, making some sort of promise
that we can't deliver on? We're never going to know all the species
that are out there."</TE>
<TE>   But the project members believe they can make enormous headway on
their admittedly ambitious goal through the use of high technology.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a few advantages that the next 25 years offer, which
the previous 250 years did not," said Richard Pyle, an ichthyologist
at the Bishop Museum in Honolulu and a consultant to the foundation.
"My interest is deep coral reefs. Just 10 to 15 years ago, the cost
and time required to just get a person to those depths was
astronomical.</TE>
<TE>   "Recent advances in diving technology, however, now allow me to
access this realm at costs that are less expensive than before."</TE>
<TE>   The Internet also opens possibilities for organizing and
collecting information for the project. While it used to take
taxonomists many months, sometimes years, to distribute information
about new species, they can now post their news on the Web in a
matter of minutes. They can also build online databases, which will
help them organize and coordinate their research.</TE>
<TE>   Such improvements in technology, along with the development of new
scientific tools such as rapid DNA sequencing, give these biologists
reason to hope--and count.</TE>
<TE>   "In the absolute sense, we won't ever know for sure," said Hillis,
of the University of Texas. "And there likely will be a few
occasional species that will continue to be discovered....</TE>
<TE>   "However, we will know that we are essentially complete when we
can take a random sample of organisms from any spot on Earth and
identify them all. Right now, we can't begin to do that for any spot
on Earth."</TE>

<HD>Adelphia May Keep Area Cable Units</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Interim CEO says now that the firm has filed for
bankruptcy protection, it won't necessarily look to sell what it
doesn't have to.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adelphia Communications Corp. may decide to keep its cable systems in
Southern California rather than sell them as previously considered,
said Erland Kailbourne, in one of his first interviews since becoming
interim chief executive of the company in April.</LD>
<LD>   Though the company had put systems, including those in Los
Angeles, up for sale in an effort to reduce debt and avoid
bankruptcy, Kailbourne said "everything changes" as a result of
Adelphia's Chapter 11 filing last week. He said the company would not
necessarily look to sell cable properties if it doesn't have to.</LD>
<LD>   Adelphia is Southern California's largest cable provider, with 1.2
million customers in neighborhoods from Eagle Rock to Pacific
Palisades and in Orange County.</LD>
<TE>   Kailbourne said Adelphia finalized $1.5 billion in financing from
its lenders Friday to operate and emerge from bankruptcy. He said the
company has petitioned the court for money to pay all city franchise
fees, programmers and employees. Part of the money will be earmarked
for upgrading systems with digital technologies needed for new
services such as high-speed Internet access.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles is very important to us, and the [bankruptcy]
financing will give us the money to build out our systems to
strengthen our position," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kailbourne said he would fly to Los Angeles in the next three
weeks to meet with Adelphia's local employees, as well as politicians
and city regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles regulators have threatened to revoke Adelphia's five
franchises if service deteriorates. The city also has been concerned
that bankruptcy would delay payment of franchise fees. Adelphia owed
the city a payment of about $1.7 million that was due Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm reaching out to mayors and regulators in all our markets to
tell them that my major mission is to rehabilitate this company and
right the wrong that has taken place," said Kailbourne, who took
charge of Adelphia after founder John Rigas and his three sons were
forced to relinquish control amid disclosures that private family
partnerships had borrowed $3.1 billion backed by the company without
shareholder knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   Kailbourne said he expects to recruit one or two board members
with cable industry experience within the next month or two, and a
new chief operating officer by the time the firm submits a
reorganization plan to the Bankruptcy Court, within the next 120 to
150 days.</TE>
<TE>   Four independent board members have been running the company since
the Rigases were forced to step down as directors.</TE>
<TE>   Rumors surfaced late last week that Adelphia was talking to cable
pioneer Amos Hostetter about an operating role. Hostetter, who is
based in Boston, sold his cable company, Continental Cablevision,
during an industry consolidation in the mid-1990s that turned him
into one of the biggest individual shareholders of AT&amp;T Corp., the
nation's leading cable provider.</TE>
<TE>   Sources say the timing could work well since the widely respected
Hostetter soon could be free of his obligations as an AT&amp;T board
member because of a pending merger of the telecommunications giant's
cable unit with Comcast Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Other names that have surfaced for either board seats or a
management role are Gerald Kent, a telecommunications investor who
until recently was chief executive of Charter Communications Inc.,
Paul Allen's cable company; and Leo Hindery Jr., the former president
of AT&amp;T Broadband who now is chairman of Yankee Entertainment and
Sports Network.</TE>
<TE>   "I have had conversations with a couple of those people,"
Kailbourne said of the three veteran cable executives. "All of those
executives have excellent reputations."</TE>
<TE>   Industry executives say reducing Adelphia's debt could be made
more difficult by the sharp downturn in cable values in recent weeks.
Buyers may not be willing to make acquisitions using their stock in
these times. Charter, which came closest to buying Adelphia's Los
Angeles systems, backed away when its shares plummeted, making
bankruptcy inevitable. Charter's shares are down about 75%. In
contrast, Adelphia shares have lost 99% of their value since March,
when the accounting scandal first surfaced.</TE>
<TE>   "The industry has been under stress," Kailbourne acknowledged.
However, he said Adelphia, which is under investigation for its
accounting practices, is in better shape than many in bankruptcy
because its assets exceed its liabilities and it generates steady
revenue from nearly 6 million cable customers nationwide.</TE>

<HD>Debt Puts Strain on Cable Stocks</HD>
<DH>Telecom: High cost of operating and improper accounting at
some firms weigh down the sector.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the wake of the WorldCom Inc. scandal, cable TV stocks have been
battered by Wall Street more than any sector other than
telecommunications.</LD>
<LD>   At the core of the cable meltdown is the industry's heavy debt.</LD>
<LD>   Debt has always been an issue for investors, but it's become a red
flag after several high-profile bankruptcies. Last week, Adelphia
Communications Corp., the nation's sixth-largest cable operator,
which is under a tower of debt, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection. And with $30 billion in debt, WorldCom appears to be
headed for bankruptcy as well.</LD>
<TE>   Heavy debt made these companies vulnerable. But what toppled both
were accounting practices that some executives and analysts said
raise suspicions about the accuracy of financial reports in all
capital-intensive businesses in which there is so much leeway in how
to book operating expenses.</TE>
<TE>   "Both cable and telecommunications march to the same metrics, and
these metrics are subject to abuse," said Leo Hindery Jr., chairman
of Yankee Entertainment and Sports Network and former president of
AT&amp;T Broadband, the nation's largest cable operator. "The cable
industry is getting crushed because investors know the companies
fudge their numbers. There needs to be standards that are commonly
defined and unimpeachable."</TE>
<TE>   Cable stocks already were down because of an accounting scandal at
Adelphia, and they fell further last week. The hardest hit were firms
with the most debt: Cablevision Systems Corp. shares fell 26% last
week and are down 80% this year, while shares of Charter
Communications Inc., which fell 12% last week, are down 75% this
year.</TE>
<TE>   The bonds of Cablevision and Charter were trading last week as if
the companies were on the verge of bankruptcy. Some bonds of Charter
were trading at 70 cents on the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   "They both need capital but don't have access to the equity
markets, and Charter already has too much debt," said Oren Cohen, a
principal at hedge fund Trilogy Capital.</TE>
<TE>   Charter Chairman Paul Allen could draw on his billions of dollars
to reduce the company's debt, according to sources close to the
Microsoft Corp. co-founder.</TE>
<TE>   Earnings Not a Measure</TE>
<TE>   Like telecommunications companies, cable operators are judged on
Wall Street by three main criteria--subscriber, revenue and cash flow
growth. Earnings, the gold standard by which most companies are
measured, are not used as a ruler in the cable industry because the
profits come and go, depending on capital investments.</TE>
<TE>   Charter posted a $1.2-billion operating loss last year, while that
of Comcast Corp. was $746 million.</TE>
<TE>   Though cable companies enjoy steady streams of cash, they spend
even more to keep their networks up to date. Since Congress
deregulated the phone and cable industries in 1996 to ignite
competition, cable companies have spent $60 billion to upgrade their
networks with digital technologies for high-speed Internet access and
telephone service.</TE>
<TE>   "They've become cash alligators rather than cash cows," Hindery
said. "It takes a lot of money--a lot of debt--to be in this
business."</TE>
<TE>   Because of this, Wall Street has deemed cash flow a better measure
of a cable company's health than earnings. Media analysts use a gauge
of cash flow known as EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization. This tool is used to give a picture of
how much cash a company generates from ongoing operations to pay
debt, interest and capital expenditures.</TE>
<TE>   But the measurement is not foolproof. Companies can book some
expenses as capital expenditures, treating them as assets that can be
depreciated over time. Doing so improves EBITDA and in the case of
WorldCom was the difference between a profit and a loss.</TE>
<TE>   Improper Accounting</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom originally reported a profit in 2001 of $1.4 billion
instead of a loss by improperly accounting for $3.9 billion in
operating costs over the last five quarters. Instead of recording
fees paid to local telephone firms for connecting its long-distance
calls as operating expenses immediately, WorldCom accounted for them
as capital expenditures--or assets--and depreciated those costs over
several years.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia did much the same thing. The cable firm took certain
marketing, labor and programming costs that should have been
recognized immediately and spread those costs over many years. As a
result, Adelphia overstated its fiscal 2001 cash flow by $210
million.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a zillion things you can do to fool with the numbers,"
said Frank Biondi, an investment advisor and former chief executive
of Universal Studios and Viacom Inc. "The problem is, there are
guidelines but no standard rules for fixed-asset accounting."</TE>
<TE>   UBS Warburg media analyst Christopher Dixon said, "Companies [that
use] EBITDA are coming under pressure. This is part of the WorldCom
meltdown."</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts said investors are overreacting to the accounting
scandals and are unfairly punishing entire industries for the abuses
of a few companies.</TE>
<TE>   "It's irrational that cable stocks are off by 60%," Dixon said.
"This is a great business with very stable revenue and cash flows.
This is panic behavior. People are running scared."</TE>
<TE>   Dixon said it is widely known on Wall Street which companies most
aggressively use EBITDA. Cohen and Dixon said Cablevision and Charter
fit into this category.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Comcast and rival Cox Communications Inc., considered to
be the most conservatively run cable operators, fell only 3% and 5%,
respectively, last week.</TE>
<TE>   One debate within the cable industry is how to account for labor
costs to install new services.</TE>
<TE>   "Ask seven cable companies how they do it and you'll get seven
different answers," Biondi said.</TE>
<TE>   Another area prone to manipulation is accounting for fees
collected by cable operators for launching new channels.</TE>
<TE>   Industry executives said these fees must be booked over the life
of the contract, but some cable operators account for them
immediately by booking them as advertising income, thus propping up
sales.</TE>
<TE>   A firm's number of subscribers, which is used by Wall Street to
value cable, phone and Internet business, also is subject to
interpretation. America Online Inc. has long been suspected of giving
free Internet service to customers who ask to be disconnected to
continue counting them as subscribers. Adelphia, DirecTV and AT&amp;T
Broadband recently have revised their subscriber counts downward.</TE>

<HD>It's Mostly Snore Time at NYC Computer Expo</HD>
<DH>'There was nothing that really made you step back and
look,' one attendee says, as many exhibitors present warmed-over
products.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM KRANE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In a further sign of the technology sector's tarnished gleam,
companies exhibiting their latest wares at this year's TechXNY
convention turned to B-grade show biz gags to lure crowds to their
booths.</LD>
<LD>   "It's all old hat," said Stephen Widmer, 35, who grimaced as a
juggler tossed bowling pins in front of the Veritas Software Corp.
display. "They're showing the same things as last year."</LD>
<LD>   Last week's three-day conference, which featured forthcoming
computer-related devices and software programs, was a slimmed-down
version of its previously sprawling self.</LD>
<TE>   Display booths filled only about half of the cavernous Jacob K.
Javits Convention Center, with the remainder of the floor--jammed in
previous years--walled off and empty.</TE>
<TE>   Perennial attendee Eugene Voll, 45, said he usually spends an
entire day wandering, gawking and loading up on vendors' pamphlets
and giveaways.</TE>
<TE>   This year Voll lost interest after a few hours.</TE>
<TE>   "There was nothing that really made you step back and look," he
said, leaving the showroom with an all-but-empty bag.</TE>
<TE>   Not that there weren't any new devices on display.</TE>
<TE>   But most were warmed-over versions of products that hit the market
long ago.</TE>
<TE>   Forthcoming items, such as Microsoft's tablet PC software and
wireless Mira monitor, had been announced elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft Corp. executive Jeff Raikes opened the conference with a
limited demonstration of the company's Windows XP operating system
for the tablet PC, a laptop-like computer that allows the user to
enter data with a stylus, translating handwriting into digital text.</TE>
<TE>   Raikes merely announced that the long-awaited software would begin
selling on Nov. 7, and that PC makers--such as Fujitsu Ltd., Toshiba
Corp. and Acer--would have compatible machines ready by then.
Attendees didn't get to see a test of the software's accuracy in
converting handwriting scrawl into digital text.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft's Pocket PC Phone Edition--a combination hand-held
computer and cell phone--will start selling this summer, with service
by VoiceStream Wireless, Raikes announced.</TE>
<TE>   Kyocera Corp. also displayed a personal digital assistant phone,
the 7135 Smartphone, that runs the competing Palm operating system.
Its release is expected this fall.</TE>
<TE>   But several companies, including Kyocera, Handspring Inc., Nokia,
Research in Motion Ltd. and Audiovox Corp., offered similar devices
months ago.</TE>
<TE>   IBM Corp. and Toshiba trotted out devices with built-in Wi-Fi
wireless networking, a technology furiously touted last year. Both
companies added the capability to laptops, and Toshiba installed it
in a $599 hand-held computer, the e740, which began selling last
week.</TE>
<TE>   One of the more interesting items was UnitedHome software sold by
Listman Home Technologies, a package that allows a home's stereo
system and other electronics to be networked through a PC.</TE>
<TE>   The whole network is controlled from the couch, on the home
television screen, by toggling keys on a wireless keyboard.</TE>
<TE>   A consumer version of the software will sell for $200 to $300 in
September.</TE>
<TE>   For those seeking to use laptops away from a power source,
Toronto's Electrovaya proffered unobtrusive lithium batteries that
promise eight to 12 hours of power for $399 or 12 to 16 hours for
$499.</TE>
<TE>   PoGo Products of Brea, maker of an ultra-thin portable CD player
and a tiny MPEG video player, also had a trio of tiny MP3
recorder-players that let users skirt copy-restricting technology
emerging in some music CDs.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of "ripping" CD tracks with the help of a computer, the
PoGo RipFlash devices use a simple patch cord to cleverly grab the CD
signal as it's being played through a stereo.</TE>
<TE>   The simmering war over standards for digital video recording came
closer to resolution, with Hitachi Ltd., Panasonic and Samsung
announcing they would begin selling multi-format DVD recorders that
operate on three competing standards.</TE>
<TE>   The machines, which will begin selling in the fall, will still
compete with a fourth format used by Philips, Sony Corp., Compaq,
Dell Computer Corp. and others.</TE>
<TE>   Asked which standard might prevail someday, Brandon Jasionowski of
the Recordable DVD Council just shrugged.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone's stubborn," he said.</TE>

<HD>Americans Pack Up for July 4</HD>
<DH>Many are shelving economic, terrorism concerns for long
weekend travel</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE HARRIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Neither economic concerns nor terrorist threats stand to interfere
with Fourth of July travel plans this year, as an estimated 37
million Americans prepare to descend on theme parks, campgrounds,
beaches and resorts over what for many will be a four-day weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Holiday bookings appear not to be affected by the disclosure that
the FBI is on heightened alert after intelligence reports indicating
that major Independence Day celebrations could be targets of
terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   "It's important to keep everything in perspective," said Cheryl
Mimura, a spokeswoman for the FBI in Los Angeles, where agents have
been contacting organizers of July 4 fireworks shows and festivals to
get a handle on crowd estimates and security measures. "It's good,
actually, to see that people are getting on with life."</LD>
<TE>   Las Vegas expects 261,000 visitors and 90% of its rooms to be
filled--in both cases a 4% increase over last year. Visitors
apparently are ignoring a report--dismissed by the FBI--from a man
who claimed to have overheard a cell phone discussion naming Las
Vegas as a terrorist target on Independence Day.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise on Catalina Island, where hotel rooms are booked solid
and people are seemingly paying no attention to an uncorroborated
report claiming Al Qaeda operatives were headed there for the long
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people are just finally tired of it all," said Rob
Powers, a spokesman for the Las Vegas Convention &amp; Visitors
Authority. "They want to get away, get out. And it's a perfect time
to celebrate their patriotism too."</TE>
<TE>   With the Fourth of July falling on a Thursday this year, many
people are expected to make it a four-day weekend. That is expected
to put the Fourth this year behind only Thanksgiving and Memorial Day
as the busiest travel weekend, according to the Automobile Assn. of
America, edging out Labor Day weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The Auto Club estimates that 36.7 million Americans will travel at
least 50 miles July 4-7, up from 36.4 million for the holiday weekend
last year.</TE>
<TE>   For the summer, 52% of Americans are planning to take vacations
this year, compared with 48% last summer. And many are going whether
they can afford to or not.</TE>
<TE>   According to a survey released this week by AmeriDebt, about 40%
of this year's summer vacations will be financed with credit
cards--and a third of those who plan to use them say they won't be
able to pay off the entire amount when they return.</TE>
<TE>   Still, travelers will be spending the same amount or more on their
vacations this year, said Wayne Russum, a researcher with Opinion
Research Corp., which conducted the survey.</TE>
<TE>   "There seems to be an almost stubborn need for people to take a
vacation, regardless of their financial health," Russum said.</TE>
<TE>   Because most July 4 vacationers will be traveling by car or
recreational vehicle, including at least 8 million people in the
Western states, regional destinations such as San Diego, Palm Springs
and Santa Barbara stand to benefit the most, according to the Travel
Industry Assn. of America.</TE>
<TE>   Air travel, however, is expected to drop nearly 5% from last
Fourth of July weekend, with 4.4 million people planning to take
flights. Post-Sept. 11 jitters, airport security hassles and fewer
airfare bargains continue to steer people away.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, RV rentals and campground reservations for the
weekend are up 25% and 15% over last year, respectively, as people
opt to hit the road on shorter trips that are closer to home.</TE>
<TE>   The country's two largest RV rental companies said they have been
sold out for the Fourth of July for months.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless you own an RV, you'll be hard-pressed to find one
available now," said Ken Sommer, spokesman for the Recreation Vehicle
Industry Assn. in Virginia. "And unless you've planned ahead, you
probably won't find a place to park it."</TE>
<TE>   Theme parks, too, are preparing for a busy holiday, with hotels at
Walt Disney Co.'s Disneyland Resort in Anaheim sold out for the
four-day weekend and nearly booked for the rest of the summer, a
reservations agent said.</TE>
<TE>   To keep people coming throughout the summer, Disney last week
announced the return of last summer's admissions discounts for
California Adventure, which let children ages 9 and under get in
free.</TE>
<TE>   Though the FBI won't specify what major celebrations agents will
focus on this year in light of the terrorist threats, a recent
Washington alert cited high-profile events that are likely to draw
large crowds.</TE>
<TE>   Security measures have been increased at theme parks since Sept.
11, and officials said they will keep those measures in place for
Fourth of July crowds. Disneyland, for example, has added uniformed
and undercover police to patrol the parks, and Knott's Berry Farm and
Six Flags Magic Mountain conduct bag checks of all visitors upon
entering.</TE>
<TE>   But terrorist threats aren't changing many plans for holiday
travel, according to the Travel Industry Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Of those surveyed who said they were cutting back on their trips
over the Fourth of July, 19% cited security concerns--down from
one-third who were leery of traveling over New Year's.</TE>
<TE>   About 28% said lack of time off work, economic worries or other
responsibilities were keeping them home.</TE>
<TE>   On Catalina, where the Fourth of July holiday typically accounts
for 15% of total summer business, merchants expressed relief that the
weekend still promised to be strong even after the recent threat.</TE>
<TE>   Some hotel workers said several visitors have called to ask about
the report, which was widely covered on the news, but they did not
choose to cancel their trips. Just four groups canceled their
day-trip tickets to Catalina last week on various boat services,
according to the island's Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   "This is probably the biggest holiday for us, and it's even bigger
when it's a four-day weekend," said Joe Turner, who rents tandem
bicycles in Avalon. "So to hear we're going to be packed as usual is
like music to our ears ... or the ching-ching of the cash register."</TE>

<HD>Southland Manufacturing Showing Further Decline</HD>
<DH>Economy: Job drops have been steady. Experts warn steps are
needed to preserve industrial base.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern California remains the nation's top manufacturing center,
but a steady slide in factory jobs signals that the region's
industrial strength is waning, according to a report to be released
today by the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The agency's study contends that manufacturing is at a crossroads,
with further declines inevitable unless policymakers take aggressive
steps to preserve the region's industrial base and the nearly 1
million factory jobs in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San
Bernardino and Ventura counties.</LD>
<LD>   Average annual manufacturing employment in the five-county area
declined by 26,300 jobs in 2001, with 19,400 more losses projected
this year. Over the last decade, Los Angeles County, the heart of the
region's industrial base, has lost about 169,000 factory jobs,
representing nearly 22% of its manufacturing work force. Nearly half
of those jobs were in the defense industry, whose average hourly wage
was $19.36.</LD>
<TE>   The trouble, said LAEDC chief economist Jack Kyser, is that many
policymakers believe that manufacturing left Southern California when
the defense industry collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the vast majority of the region's manufacturers are small
and medium-size companies without the name recognition of Boeing Co.
or Northrop Grumman Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, although the average California factory job still pays
$15.68 an hour, Kyser said the industrial sector gets scant attention
from public officials, many of whom are more interested in high-tech
and other "new-economy" pursuits.</TE>
<TE>   "We've taken our eyes off the manufacturing ball," Kyser said.
"It's a big reason why the recent census figures show that the middle
class is disappearing and poverty is up."</TE>
<TE>   One of the few bright spots on the region's manufacturing
landscape has been the Riverside-San Bernardino area. The area has
posted a string of strong gains in factory employment since the
mid-'90s because of its abundant available land for industrial
projects.</TE>
<TE>   But even the Inland Empire saw its factory job growth stall last
year in response to the nation's steep manufacturing downturn.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, apparel and textile making remains the
largest manufacturing industry, with about 107,000 jobs, followed by
transportation equipment, instruments and fabricated metals. In 2001,
the county's 605,700 factory jobs ranked it just behind Chicago's
606,600. If it were a separate state, the five-county area's 996,800
manufacturing jobs would rank it fourth in the nation, behind
California, Texas and Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   The LAEDC recommends a plan to preserve manufacturing in the
region, including reusing industrial land to create more factory
sites, providing better vocational training for factory workers as
well as educating policymakers about the importance of manufacturing
to the region's economy.</TE>

<HD>Listen.com Gets Rights to Catalogs</HD>

<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alarmed by the sharp drop in CD sales and steady rise in Internet
piracy, the major record companies finally are picking up the pace of
their lumbering efforts to distribute songs online.</LD>
<LD>   In a milestone for the record industry, Listen.com today is
expected to become the first online music service authorized to offer
songs on demand from all five major record companies--something that
a host of pirate services have been doing for years. Listen.com is
expected to announce a deal with Universal Music Group today, giving
the company a complete set of major-label licenses.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Warner Music Group has granted online music distributor
FullAudio Corp. the right to sell downloadable songs that can be
burned onto CDs--a first for both companies. The move lets privately
held FullAudio expand beyond music rentals, enabling subscribers to
make permanent copies of downloaded songs for an extra fee.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts said the label-backed services still have flaws that will
make it hard for them to compete with unauthorized free sources of
music online, such as the Kazaa and Morpheus file-sharing networks.
But the industry-supported services are improving at an accelerating
pace as the major labels open their catalogs, cut prices and reduce
restrictions on songs delivered online.</TE>
<TE>   File-sharing networks have been growing in popularity since 1999,
when a free service by Napster Inc. started grabbing headlines by
letting consumers copy virtually any song they wanted from other
users' computers. These services helped popularize MP3 files, which
could be freely duplicated, burned onto CDs or moved to portable
devices with no loss in fidelity.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the first industry-backed services to let subscribers
play or download songs on demand didn't appear until late last year.
And all of these services were handicapped by limited selections and
restrictive formats that made it hard or even impossible to move
songs from a computer to a stereo, car or portable device.</TE>
<TE>   James Glicker, president of music services at FullAudio, said the
main problem has been getting the labels' management and artists'
representatives to recognize that they have to change the way they do
business.</TE>
<TE>   "The record companies haven't integrated new media into their
overall strategy. They're coming around, though," Glicker said,
adding, "I think people will be surprised what comes out over the
next six months."</TE>
<TE>   What's motivating them is CD sales, which fell 4% in the U.S. in
2001. They're particularly alarmed by the sharp decline in sales of
many hit albums after their first week in stores, a phenomenon that
Glicker blamed on home CD copying.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence Kenswil, president of Universal Elabs, said he has not
had problems convincing top Universal executives that the company
needed to act. But Kenswil agreed that some industry executives
didn't respond to the changes wrought by the Internet because they
didn't feel the urgency.</TE>
<TE>   "When sales start dropping, it means, guess what? It's no longer a
long-term or medium-term consideration, it's a short-term
consideration," Kenswil said. "To that extent, I think people are
realizing there's no putting it off anymore."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest Internet music company left behind in the shifting
marketplace may be MusicNet, an online distributor co-owned by AOL
Time Warner Inc., EMI Group, Bertelsmann and RealNetworks Inc.</TE>
<TE>   MusicNet negotiated licenses early last year that didn't enable
subscribers to accumulate music over time, burn downloaded songs onto
CDs or move them to portable devices.</TE>
<TE>   Spokeswoman Ann Garrett said the company expects to win better
licenses shortly. She added, "We know that the current service has
its flaws, so we will be putting out a version that will meet
consumers' needs."</TE>
<TE>   Listen.com operates Rhapsody, an online jukebox and subscription
radio service.</TE>
<TE>   As far as its customers were concerned, Rhapsody's main problems
were the gaps in its lineup of songs and the inability to move songs
from the computer to a car stereo or an MP3 player.</TE>
<TE>   The company is trying to solve the portability problem by
negotiating new licenses with the labels that will let subscribers
burn songs onto CDs for an extra fee, said Sean Ryan, the company's
chief executive. It also plans to roll out a wireless delivery option
later this year that will allow subscribers to listen to songs
through new mobile phones.</TE>
<TE>   The deal with Universal--the largest of the five labels and home
to such hit-makers as Eminem, U2 and Nelly--should go a long way
toward plugging holes in Listen.com's lineup, said analyst Phil Leigh
of investment firm Raymond James &amp; Associates. And by bringing all
five major labels' music together, Listen.com is likely to find
numerous new distributors for Rhapsody--particularly companies
providing high-speed Internet connections, Leigh said.</TE>
<TE>   FullAudio's deal with Warner Music will enable subscribers to burn
onto CDs selected songs by Warner artists for about $1 per track.
It's a surprising turnaround for Warner, which had previously limited
CD burning to a few singles.</TE>
<TE>   "Most consumers listen to music in CD players," said Paul Vidich,
a Warner Music Group executive vice president. "By making our
downloads burnable, we are making this new electronic format
competitive with the physical CDs that we sell in retail stores."</TE>

<HD>WorldCom May Be in for a Grilling</HD>
<DH>Probe: String of broken promises in Washington by firm has
created hostility that could play a role when officials face
congressional inquiry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- WorldCom Inc., once the toast of Washington, will get a
tougher reception this month when it comes to Capitol Hill to face
inquires about its accounting scandal.</LD>
<LD>   Through a series of broken promises and political missteps,
WorldCom has managed to squander nearly all of the goodwill it
enjoyed after it bought long-distance carrier MCI Communications Inc.
and promised to deliver better telephone and Internet services to
consumers.</LD>
<LD>   "They are not going to get a good reception on the Hill," said
Blair Levin, a telecommunications analyst for Legg Mason Wood Walker
Inc. and a former chief of staff at the Federal Communications
Commission. "The level of hostility and anger is going to be high."</LD>
<TE>   Resentment against the company in Washington has been building for
years, unlike on Wall Street, where WorldCom only recently incurred
investor wrath after its disclosure last week that it wrongly listed
$3.9 billion as capital expenses in 2001 and 2002.</TE>
<TE>   It started when WorldCom reneged on a promise to keep MCI
headquartered in Washington and dispersed employees to nearby
suburban Virginia and WorldCom's Clinton, Miss., headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Then WorldCom embarrassed federal regulators by failing to make
good on a pledge to offer residential local phone service in
competition to the regional Bell telephone companies. It wasn't until
April of this year that WorldCom struck a deal with Tampa, Fla.-based
Z-Tel Technologies Inc. to offer bundled local and long-distance
phone service in about 40 states. And critics said the program has
not been aggressively marketed.</TE>
<TE>   Opposing Lawmakers</TE>
<TE>   But in perhaps its most damaging gambit, WorldCom spent last year
battling powerful lawmakers who will have huge influence on the
company's fate.</TE>
<TE>   The company was one of the leading opponents of the Internet
Freedom and Broadband Deployment Act sponsored by House Energy and
Commerce Committee Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.). WorldCom
argued that the measure, which would free the Bell companies from
federal rules requiring them to share their data lines with rivals,
would make the Bells unregulated monopolies with vast power over
telephone service and Internet access.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom--a relative newcomer on Capitol Hill with few political
favors to dispense or collect--drew particular ire from Tauzin and
Michigan Rep. John D. Dingell, the ranking Democrat on the House
Energy and Commerce Committee, for its high-profile opposition to the
measure.</TE>
<TE>   It also didn't help that WorldCom--which has made $7.5 million in
political contributions since 1989--has funneled a good share of the
money to Tauzin's political enemies.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), who has opposed Tauzin on a
number of key telecom measures including Tauzin's broadband bill, was
the top Senate recipient of WorldCom money, with $32,166, according
to the Center for Responsive Politics. Rep. Charles W. "Chip"
Pickering, a Mississippi Republican who has defended his hometown
company in its broadband dispute with Tauzin, was the top House
recipient of the firm's money from 1989 to 2002, receiving $82,050 in
contributions.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom spokesmen in Washington, Mississippi and Texas could not
be reached for comment. But House Energy and Commerce Committee
spokesman Ken Johnson said it would be "idiocy" to view the
committee's inquiry into WorldCom as payback for its opposition to
Tauzin's broadband bill.</TE>
<TE>   "We pray that WorldCom survives," Johnson said. "We're not out to
get WorldCom; we are out to get the people that defrauded investors
in WorldCom."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, more is at stake for WorldCom in Washington than public
embarrassment.</TE>
<TE>   Experts said the FCC may be pressured to crack down on WorldCom
and other telecommunications carriers, especially if the nation's
consumers face any disruptions in phone or Internet service. What's
more, there already are nearly half a dozen bills circulating in
Congress that seek to curb the kind of accounting activity that led
to WorldCom's downfall.</TE>
<TE>   Additional Legislation</TE>
<TE>   Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez) introduced legislation last month
that would prohibit executives and corporate directors from receiving
insider company loans of more than $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   Former WorldCom Chief Executive Bernard J. Ebbers was forced out
of the company after collecting about $400 million in personal loans
from WorldCom that contributed to WorldCom's financial downfall.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't afford to wait for the next corporate deception,
followed by the next round of layoffs," Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.)
said in a radio address on behalf of Democrats that was aired
Saturday. "We need to take action to restore public trust in our
financial markets. And that begins with restoring public confidence
in the accuracy of financial information."</TE>
<TE>   The action will start July 8, when the House Financial Services
Committee summons WorldCom's top current and former executives to
testify. Asked to appear are CEO John W. Sidgmore, former Chief
Financial Officer Scott D. Sullivan and Ebbers. Salomon Smith Barney
telecom analyst Jack Grubman, who once was one of WorldCom's most
bullish supporters on Wall Street, also was subpoenaed.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Tauzin and Rep. James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), chairman of
the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations,
have written to WorldCom, demanding that the company turn over
various financial audits, business records and "indefeasible right of
use" contracts by July 11. The latter documents, which are agreements
to buy communications transmission capacity, figured prominently in
the recent congressional investigations of telecom firm Global
Crossing Ltd. Experts said IRUs have been an invitation for financial
sleight-of-hand because they can be used to cloud the difference
between corporate capital and operating expenses.</TE>
<TE>   With Washington poised to take on the latest financial scandal,
however, some experts cautioned lawmakers that they run the risk of
further damaging the nation's financial markets if they use the
WorldCom hearings to grandstand.</TE>
<TE>   "Aside from any sort of political gamesmanship that might go on, I
think there is a real public service that needs to be done, and that
is to restore the confidence the American public has in publicly
traded corporations," said Harold Furchtgott-Roth, a former
Republican Federal Communications Commissioner, now a fellow at the
American Enterprise Institute.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is a perception that the practice of cooking accounting
books is widespread, that will have a devastating effect on investor
confidence."</TE>

<HD>MGM/UA Marketing Chief Replaced</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: The change comes after several box office
disappointments, including the recent 'Windtalkers.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANITA BUSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a string of big-budget box office disappointments, MGM/UA has
replaced its worldwide marketing and distribution president, Robert
Levin, and has reorganized its distribution reporting structure.</LD>
<LD>   Former Universal Pictures marketing executive Peter Adee will take
the post of president of worldwide marketing but will not have
responsibility for distribution. Erik Lomis, a 10-year MGM
distribution executive who was promoted to president of the division
in September, will oversee distribution and report directly to Chris
McGurk, vice chairman and chief operating officer of MGM/UA. In
addition, international distribution will report to McGurk.</LD>
<LD>   The move comes at a critical time for MGM. The studio recently has
seen several of its high-profile, big-budget films perform poorly at
the box office, including "Rollerball," "Hart's War" and
"Windtalkers."</LD>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, the studio issued a warning to Wall Street that
nearly doubled its projected loss for the year to a range of 85 cents
to 89 cents, blaming poor performance of "Windtalkers." The wartime
action film had a production budget of about $115 million; it opened
to an anemic $14 million.</TE>
<TE>   It's not unusual for film studios to place blame on their
marketing staffs when pictures, whether poorly reviewed or not, have
lackluster performances at the box office. Levin's departure comes
just four months before the next installment of the studio's biggest
franchise, the James Bond film "Die Another Day," opens in theaters.</TE>
<TE>   Studio sources peg the "Windtalkers" domestic marketing budget at
about $35 million with about $15 million to $20 million more spent on
the film's international release. Part of the marketing costs were
incurred because of an interruption in the film's ad campaign that
came about as a result of MGM's postponement of the film's release.
Not only did MGM suffer some post-Sept. 11 jitters in handling a
war-themed film, but the studio also wanted to avoid recording hefty
production costs last year.</TE>
<TE>   Levin resigned after only a year in the post. During his tenure,
he also worked on ad campaigns for the box office hit "Legally
Blonde," "Jeepers Creepers" and "Ghost World" and on the Academy
Award campaign for "No Man's Land." Previously, he had served as
president of marketing at Sony Corp.'s Columbia TriStar Motion
Pictures Group and oversaw marketing at Walt Disney Co.'s film
division.</TE>
<TE>   "Recently, Bob Levin approached us recommending we seek a
replacement for worldwide marketing at MGM," McGurk said in a
statement released Sunday. "We immediately began a search for his
successor. While we feel extremely fortunate to bring aboard an
executive of Peter's caliber, at the same time, we wish Bob nothing
but the best."</TE>
<TE>   Adee worked on several campaigns for Universal during his year and
a half as president of marketing, including "The Fast and the
Furious" and "American Pie II."</TE>

<HD>Seeking Equilibrium in a Short Trading Week</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Times Staff and Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street opens this week wondering if Friday's heavy trading
volume in stocks, coinciding with the nearly flat performances of
major indexes, suggests the scandal-rocked market has reached some
semblance of equilibrium in the near term.</LD>
<LD>   Stocks rallied for much of the session Friday amid soaring volume,
as investors made bets, or closed out bets, on the last day of the
second quarter. The New York Stock Exchange recorded its
fifth-heaviest trading day, as more than 2.1 billion shares changed
hands.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average gave up early gains to close down
26.66 points, or 0.3%, at 9,243.26. The Nasdaq composite, however,
added 4.01 points to 1,463.21.</LD>
<TE>   A big chunk of Friday's volume was tied to the annual
"rebalancing" of the Frank Russell Co. stock indexes. Institutional
investors who seek to mimic the performance of those indexes were
busy buying stocks that were added to the indexes and selling those
that were deleted.</TE>
<TE>   The index shuffle aside, some analysts were heartened that the Dow
suffered only a fractional loss for the week and that the Nasdaq
index gained 1.5% after five straight weekly declines.</TE>
<TE>   Considering the battering that many stocks suffered early in the
week on news of WorldCom Inc.'s dramatic earnings restatement, the
market's ability to bounce back was viewed by some analysts as a sign
that prices may be bottoming after months of losses.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless we get hit by unforeseen catastrophic news, it will be a
week where the market tries to consolidate around present levels,"
said Peter Cardillo, strategist for Global Partners Securities in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   Investors may begin to look ahead to second-quarter corporate
earnings reports. Operating earnings for the blue-chip Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 companies are expected to rise 3% from a year earlier,
signaling the start of a profit turnaround from the recession,
according to earnings tracker Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, many investors remain wary about high stock
valuations, the threat of more corporate bombshells and the
possibility of a new terrorist attack on U.S. soil. And with key
market indexes hanging just above the lows reached Sept. 21, any
renewed selling could send the market to fresh 3 1/2-year lows.</TE>
<TE>   "We are at a somewhat crucial level," said Ed Hemmelgarn,
president and chief investment officer of Shaker Investments. "But
there seems to be movement, some buying. If we can hold at these
levels where we were at in September, that's pretty positive."</TE>
<TE>   Investors will have fewer trading hours in which to buy or sell
this week: The market will be closed July 4 and will be open for half
a session Friday, with trading ending at 10 a.m. PDT.</TE>

<HD>June Report Expected to Show Job Growth</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News, Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A U.S. economy that's recovering from recession is starting to create
the jobs necessary to keep it going, a report this week is expected
to show.</LD>
<LD>   Economists predict that the Labor Department's report Friday on
employment trends will show that businesses added 75,000 workers to
their payrolls in June.</LD>
<LD>   The unemployment rate probably rose to 5.9% from 5.8% a month
earlier. That would reflect that job seekers are entering the labor
force faster than positions are being created.</LD>
<TE>   Hiring at some companies such as Microsoft Corp. is starting to
pick up in tandem with sales, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Still, widespread employment gains are months away, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "Caution is the order of the day" until business confidence,
profits and demand begin to rise in earnest, said Chris Rupkey,
senior financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   After growing at a 6.1% annual rate in the first three months, the
economy slowed to a 2.7% pace in the second quarter, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of 55 economists. Growth may pick up to a 3.2%
rate in the third quarter and 3.5% in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   To ensure the rebound stays intact, Federal Reserve policymakers
kept their benchmark short-term interest rate at a four-decade low of
1.75% last week. The strength of demand "remains uncertain" in coming
months, the central bankers said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Other economic reports expected this week:</TE>
<TE>   * Today, the Commerce Department will report on May construction
spending. Analysts expect a 0.2% increase, matching April's rise.</TE>
<TE>   The Institute for Supply Management will report on manufacturing
activity in June. It's expected to say that manufacturing expanded
for a fifth straight month.</TE>
<TE>   Factories have picked up the pace after businesses reduced
inventories by a record $119.3 billion in the final three months of
2001 and an additional $27.7 billion in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   * Wednesday, the Commerce Department will report on May factory
orders. A 0.6% increase is expected by economists. That would match
April's rise.</TE>
<TE>   The Institute for Supply Management will report on service-sector
activity in June.</TE>
<TE>   The report is expected to show that the service sector expanded
last month, but at a slower pace than May.</TE>

<HD>Owing Back Dues Depends on Union Security Provision</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: In 1970, I hired on as a part-time employee while I went to
school. Eventually, I went full-time with a seniority date of
November 1973.</LD>
<LD>   At the time, union membership was not required of employees. Later
agreements made union membership mandatory for new hires.</LD>
<LD>   At no time did I join the union or pay union dues or fees. For 30
years, I had been told that I had been "grandfathered in" as a
pre-union-era employee and was exempt from such fees.</LD>
<TE>   After a corporate merger, the union signed a new contract. Now I
am receiving letters contending I owe nearly $1,000 in back dues.</TE>
<TE>   Could that be correct?</TE>
<TE>   --R.M., Mission Hills</TE>
<TE>   Answer: You need to find out the facts immediately to avoid
possibly being fired by your employer for nonpayment of union dues.</TE>
<TE>   First, you should meet with the head of your union's dues
department.</TE>
<TE>   Ask that person to guide you through the dues requirements in the
union contract and the union's constitution. Be sure to find out
whether the contract contains a union security clause requiring your
employer to terminate employees for nonpayment of union dues.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the contract contains a union security clause, you cannot
be charged dues for periods before the union security provision went
into effect. In addition, you cannot be charged back dues if you were
not given written notice of your dues obligation, detailed
information about how the amount was calculated and an explanation of
the consequences of failing to pay.</TE>
<TE>   If the labor contract does not contain a union security clause,
your union may be able to sue you to recover delinquent dues payments
if you were given proper notice of your dues obligations.</TE>
<TE>   If you are dissatisfied with the union's explanation, you should
consult an attorney or the National Labor Relations Board.</TE>

<TE>   Fairness of Policy on Holiday Pay Questioned</TE>
<TE>   Q: At my company, field techs work four days for 10-hour shifts,
while office personnel work five days, in eight-hour shifts.</TE>
<TE>   But on major paid holidays, such as Christmas and Labor Day, my
fellow field techs and I are paid only for eight hours, rather than
our normal 10-hour workday. When we questioned the policy, we were
told that if we wanted to be paid for 10 hours, we would have to use
two hours from our vacation pool.</TE>
<TE>   My human resources rep says it's company policy.</TE>
<TE>   Is this policy legal?</TE>
<TE>   --D.F., Rancho Santa Margarita</TE>
<TE>   A: There is no law that requires an employer to provide for paid
holidays. However, if an employer has such a policy, then it can be
legally enforced.</TE>
<TE>   Your employer has a right to define how many hours it will pay for
holidays. If it is the company's policy to pay for eight hours per
holiday, then that is all it is legally required to do.</TE>
<TE>   The problem here, however, is possible vagueness. Perhaps the
employer never specified the hourly limitation but just said you
would be paid for your full workday.</TE>
<TE>   It depends on how the company policy reads. Look at your employee
handbook or any other company memo explaining the holiday pay
program.</TE>
<TE>   If you want to look at fairness, however, the employer could argue
that it is really appropriate to pay for only eight hours.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, you would be receiving a windfall benefit, constituting
one-fourth of your weekly pay, compared with one-fifth of the weekly
pay received by those working five-day weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Even if you have an argument that company policy specifies pay on
a "daily" basis instead of an hourly limitation, keep in mind the
employer could redefine and clarify the policy at any time.</TE>
<TE>   You might win a temporary battle over the amount to be paid for
one past holiday but harm a long-term relationship with an employer
who can change the policy in the future. Evaluate whether it is
really worth it.</TE>

<TE>   Workers' Comp May Cover Injury at Lunch</TE>
<TE>   Q: Are employees covered under workers' compensation when they are
injured on company property during lunch?</TE>
<TE>   --J.P., Altadena</TE>
<TE>   A: An injury is covered under the workers' compensation law if it
arises "out of and in the course of the employment."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, if there is a "working lunch," during which the
employee is performing any responsibilities for the employer, or if
there is any restriction on the employee leaving during the lunch
period, workers' compensation would apply. It is even a possibility
that it also would apply if the injury simply happened on company
property.</TE>
<TE>   The answer to your question may also depend on whether you are
salaried or hourly. Courts have held that a salaried employee is paid
during the entire workday, including the lunch hour.</TE>
<TE>   A salaried employee may be considered to be acting within the
"scope of employment" at all times during the day, including lunch
breaks, and therefore might be covered under workers' compensation.</TE>
<TE>   So the answer is probably, but maybe not.</TE>

<KH>EXECUTIVE ROUNDTABLE</KH>
<HD>Getting a Handle on Rising Health-Care Costs</HD>
<DH>Many companies will see double-digit premium hikes in the
next few years. Business owners can take steps to decrease the blow.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Executive Roundtable is a weekly column by TEC International, an
organization of more than 7,000 business owners, company presidents
and chief executives. TEC members meet in small peer groups to share
their business experiences and help one another solve problems in a
round-table session. The following question and answer are a summary
of a discussion at a recent TEC meeting in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Question: My medical benefits insurance carrier raised my premiums
a whopping 20% this year and has warned they are likely to go up even
more next year. Several of my associates have complained of equal or
larger increases. What's behind this sudden hike in benefits costs
and, more important, what can small-business owners like me do about
it?</LD>
<TE>   Answer: After several years of relative quiescence, the medical
benefits ogre has decided to once again raise its ugly head.</TE>
<TE>   In the next few years, most companies probably will experience
double-digit health-care inflation, with some seeing increases as
high as 50%. Although many factors contribute to this complex issue,
experts point to four primary causes, the first of which is a grossly
inefficient health-care system.</TE>
<TE>   In the second half of the '90s, managed care helped to rein in
costs by shortening hospital stays, providing alternatives to
hospitalization and reducing unit costs. However, this rationing of
care failed to address the core problem. In order to get a handle on
spiraling costs, the health-care system needs to upgrade information
systems, reduce processing errors, lower medical costs through more
efficient delivery and lower overall administrative costs.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the health-care economic model needs a major overhaul.
With the current system, under which employees spend someone else's
(their employers') dollars, most consumers have little or no economic
incentive to make informed, prudent health-care choices.</TE>
<TE>   Third, unhealthful lifestyle choices contribute to a significant
portion of health-care costs. For example, health-care experts
estimate that 50% of all premature deaths in America occur as the
result of poor lifestyle choices, while up to 70% of all deaths from
heart disease or cancer are lifestyle-related. Lifestyle also
contributes to obesity, diabetes, stroke and other major health
issues.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, America is rapidly aging, and older people use a
disproportionate share of medical services and consume the majority
of pharmaceutical drugs.</TE>
<TE>   As the population continues to grow older, this trend will play an
increasing role in rising health-care costs.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, problems of this size and complexity will take time to
solve. In the meantime, what can you do to get a handle on your
health-care costs? Experts recommend the following:</TE>
<TE>   Challenge the status quo. Recognize that you don't automatically
have to accept double-digit increases in your health-care costs, that
there are viable alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   Finding these alternatives, however, requires the same amount of
due diligence and prudent shopping as with major purchases in other
areas of your business.</TE>
<TE>   Define the parameters. Set a target figure for next year's
health-care spending. Then work with your insurance carrier to come
up with the best array of benefits it can provide at that level.</TE>
<TE>   Empower people to make good lifestyle choices. Provide your people
with the knowledge and tools they need to take better care of
themselves. Offer employee wellness programs that help people
implement the lifestyle changes they need to make. Use incentives and
rewards to motivate people to make good lifestyle and health-care
choices.</TE>
<TE>   Consider self-insuring. Not all companies can self-insure, but
it's worth exploring this option with your broker. For those that
can, self-insuring offers a major tool for limiting cost increases.</TE>
<TE>   Consider aggregating costs. The legal and regulatory issues
involved in aggregating costs vary from state to state and region to
region. However, for companies that can join together to increase
their populations and share costs, aggregation can significantly
lower premiums.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, don't abdicate your responsibility in this area by
dumping it entirely on your HR person. Instead, learn all you can
about the options and alternatives available in the marketplace and
work with your HR specialist to determine which ones make the most
sense for your business.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, educate your employees. Give them the knowledge
and information they need to become prudent consumers of health-care
services.</TE>
<TE>   You can't forestall the inevitable increase in health-care and
insurance costs, but with a little initiative and due diligence on
your part, you can limit its effect on your business.</TE>

<HD>Hacker Writes Book, Minus His Escapades</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Barred by the terms of his probation from messing with computers,
ex-convict hacker Kevin Mitnick has turned to writing about them,
baring the tricks of his former trade in a forthcoming book.</LD>
<LD>   An advance copy of the book, "The Art of Deception," describes
more than a dozen scenarios in which computer network administrators
are duped into divulging passwords, encryption keys and other coveted
security details.</LD>
<LD>   But it's all fiction. Or so said Mitnick.</LD>
<TE>   Those seeking Mitnick's version of his lawless escapades will have
to wait. Personal details are carefully expunged from the book, which
uses fictitious names of hackers, victims and companies.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the Kevin Mitnick story," said Mitnick, 38, of Thousand
Oaks, who served five years in federal prison for stealing software
and altering data at Motorola, Novell, Nokia, Sun Microsystems and
USC. He was released in January 2000 and is on three years'
probation.</TE>
<TE>   "This book isn't about my cases, it's creating fiction stories
with the same techniques I've used and others have used," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mitnick said his message is aimed at computer security
professionals, to help them stop people like him. But he also said
his tricks would make good fodder for the dishonest.</TE>
<TE>   "The information can be used for good or bad," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mitnick is best known for leading the FBI on a three-year manhunt
that ended in 1995 when agents collared him in an apartment in
Raleigh, N.C. with the help of a top academic security expert.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The personal computer market, which shipped its 1 billionth unit in
April, is on track to ship another billion by 2008, according to a
study released today by Gartner Dataquest.</LD>
<LD>   To reach that milestone, the market must combat falling sales
brought on by a weak economy and a lack of new products.</LD>
<LD>   The market went south in 2001 for the first time in more than 15
years. About 38.7 million PCs were shipped between April 2001 and
April 2002, less than one-third the number shipped the previous year.</LD>
<TE>   To expand PC sales, companies will have to offer machines that are
smaller and less expensive than today's computers, Gartner said in
its report. Many consumers purchased new PCs in anticipation of the
Year 2000 bug and have not needed to upgrade to new computers.</TE>
<TE>   Gartner anticipates an annual growth rate of 9%, reaching the 2
billion mark by 2007 or early 2008.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>AT&amp;T Wireless Services Inc. has installed software that will enable
customers to use their phones to locate other AT&amp;T Wireless users.</LD>
<LD>   The Find Friends capability is part of the mMode mobile-Internet
service AT&amp;T Wireless introduced in April, said Andre Dahan,
president of the company's mobile multimedia services unit. The
function uses the nearest AT&amp;T Wireless transmission tower to provide
approximate locations, such as intersections, he said.</LD>
<LD>   Customers whose phones work on upgraded AT&amp;T Wireless networks in
about 18 cities may use Find Friends for no additional charge if they
buy mMode, offered for $2.99 to $12.49 a month, he said. About 35% to
45% of customers who've bought upgraded phones since April are
signing up for mMode, and 55% of those are choosing the $7.99 monthly
plan, he said.</LD>
<TE>   The Find Friends service is optional, and customers--who have to
agree to be placed on the other user's list to be located--may opt
out at any time, Dahan said. They get a short text message each time
someone tries to find them.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft Takes New Approach to Security</HD>
<DH>Computers: The software giant is creating a system that
will have built-in privacy functions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE WALKER</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's tough to plug holes in a ship's hull once it's at sea, or to
reattach an airplane's wing in flight. Yet that's akin to what the
computer industry has been trying to do with security: append layer
after layer of protection onto the world's increasingly connected
computer networks, all as one big afterthought after another.</LD>
<LD>   Afterthoughts on that scale rarely work, so we read daily about a
fresh crop of electronic heists, filched identities, hacked Web sites
and computer viruses.</LD>
<LD>   Now Microsoft Corp. is saying, "Let's start over." The company
whose software helped launch the personal computing revolution three
decades ago announced last week that it wants to redesign the
computer so it will have built-in security and privacy functions,
including some etched onto special chips to be made by Intel Corp.
and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.</LD>
<TE>   The hyper-ambitious project, code-named Palladium, is supposed to
create a platform on which Microsoft and other developers could write
all sorts of new software applications for managing security,
privacy, copyrights and even spam.</TE>
<TE>   The idea, said project manager Mario Juarez, is to create a
virtual vault inside the Windows operating system. In it, each user
could create personal "safe-deposit boxes" for storing encrypted
information. The information would be accessible only to those
software programs, Web sites and people whom the computer recognized
as being authorized to see it.</TE>
<TE>   The notion of hard-wired authentication rings alarms for
conspiracy theorists who sense a plot by which Microsoft might exert
even more control over what kind of software could run on future
computers. The Redmond, Wash., behemoth dismisses such talk as silly.</TE>
<TE>   "No one will necessarily, by design, have to call up Microsoft or
the government to get authorization," Juarez said.</TE>
<TE>   Some technologists are skeptical for other reasons, noting that
Microsoft is infamous for releasing software riddled with huge,
hacker-friendly holes.</TE>
<TE>   "Why should we trust them that this will be any different?" said
Bruce Schneier, a cryptography specialist who wrote the book "Secrets
and Lies: Digital Security in a Networked World."</TE>
<TE>   Yet some consumer advocates and champions of personal privacy
cautiously support Palladium. Nobody questions that more security is
needed.</TE>
<TE>   "It has the potential to put users in more control over their
information if it's done right," said Ari Swartz, associate director
of the Washington-based nonprofit Center for Democracy and
Technology.</TE>
<TE>   It could turn out that Microsoft's initiative is little more than
a public relations campaign to buff up a corporate image devastated
by an antitrust case and hackers taking continual glee at exposing
weaknesses in the company's software.</TE>
<TE>   But whatever the reason, Microsoft is on a tear about security. In
January, founder Bill Gates sent a memo to the entire staff, saying
the company's "highest priority" would be making its products secure,
rather than adding features.</TE>
<TE>   That's the backdrop for Palladium, which appears to be as much
idea as project at this point. Juarez acknowledged last week that
though code writing has begun, it will be several years before
Palladium becomes a product, and even longer before software
applications are written to take advantage of it. There are many
hurdles to overcome, not the least of which involve getting computer
makers to install the chip, helping users to understand the system
and persuading developers to create products that run on it.</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics question whether Microsoft is creating something to
empower consumers or trying to engineer new ways to elbow out
competitors.</TE>
<TE>   But former National Security Agency officer Ira Winkler said the
concept seems fundamentally sound because it would embed security
directly into devices, potentially making it more prevalent and
requiring less work from computer users.</TE>
<TE>   "Security has to be a basic part of information technology,"
Winkler said. "If you leave it to a user to secure themselves, they
won't do it."</TE>

<HD>Snapping on a Whim</HD>
<DH>Panasonic's SV-AV10 is worth a shot for frivolous
picture-taking</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATT MOORE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's summer, which means plenty of weekend getaways. But without
pictures to wow my friends at the office, it's as if those quick
trips never happened.</LD>
<LD>   No longer.</LD>
<LD>   Though I'm no avid shutterbug, I've been hungering for a small,
portable digital camera to snap stray shots of whatever piques my
interest, be it a passing car or a street performer. The only dilemma
has been price versus quality.</LD>
<TE>   Panasonic's SV-AV10 is a solid compromise.</TE>
<TE>   The price is decent, between $350 and $400. About the size of a
deck of cards, the unit is compact enough to fit in my pants pocket.</TE>
<TE>   If only it were a bit better, I'd be in paradise.</TE>
<TE>   The device, part of Panasonic's "e-wear" line of highly portable,
small electronic gadgets, is a perfect camera to have when you're out
with friends or just want to take a few snapshots.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the camera for highly detailed pictures of your best
friend's wedding. It's one for recording the frivolity of the
reception because it is easy to use with just one hand and is
incredibly light, weighing about 3.5 ounces.</TE>
<TE>   It's also feature-laden. Besides snapping pictures, it can record
audio and video and play MP3 music files.</TE>
<TE>   But what it boasts in ingenuity it lacks in practical use.</TE>
<TE>   First, some basics. The SV-AV10 uses SD Memory Cards, a light and
small storage medium that can handle multiple file formats, including
MPEG4 video, JPEG images and MP3 audio.</TE>
<TE>   The SV-AV10 comes with a 64-megabyte card, which is fine for
holding hundreds of pictures, a few minutes of video and some audio
files. It'll also use 128-MB cards, but there's only one slot for one
card, so if you fill one up, you've got to turn off the device, pull
out the card and put in another.</TE>
<TE>   Getting the information onto the PC isn't convenient. You can't
hook up the camera directly. Instead, the cards have to be put in a
Universal Serial Bus reader-writer that comes with the camera. That
means you have to take the reader with you if you want to e-mail
pictures during your trip.</TE>
<TE>   Using the SV-AV10 is fairly simple: Turn it on, flip open the
2-inch liquid crystal display viewfinder and decide whether to shoot
some stills or go for full-motion video.</TE>
<TE>   The menus are bright, colorful and easy to navigate. Once you've
found your subject, press the button on top and the shot is done or
the video rolls for as long as you'd like--at least until the memory
runs out.</TE>
<TE>   The quality of the images, though, leaves something to be desired.</TE>
<TE>   During the day, my shots were relatively clear, but the small,
quarter-inch CMOS image sensor with a 320-by-240 maximum resolution
doesn't boast any zoom, so you have to be close to your subject.</TE>
<TE>   Shooting at night isn't a problem with the built-in flash.</TE>
<TE>   The pictures lose luster beyond any size larger than a 3-by-5-inch
print. However, putting them on a Web site is ideal because they're
small.</TE>
<TE>   The video component is a nice touch, but don't expect to shoot any
serious homage to Kevin Smith or make your film school opus. The
motion is a bit jerky and sometimes the voices don't sync with the
picture, but at least the camera does let you include audio.</TE>
<TE>   A caveat: The built-in flash works only with photos, so nix any
ideas of shooting movies in the dark.</TE>
<TE>   If audio is your goal, you can listen to a card full of MP3s using
the ear buds that are included. But you can only skip tracks; you
can't fast forward to the middle of a song.</TE>
<TE>   It's not a deal killer, but I didn't like having to endure the
beginning of Chicane's "No Ordinary Morning" when all I really wanted
to hear was the chorus.</TE>
<TE>   My chief complaint is the lithium battery. When I used the device
to play MP3s, the battery spiraled down in only two hours or so. That
meant I had to drag the power brick around to keep it juiced up.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, it's a fun audio-video device, but the lack of detailed
pictures means it'll forever be consigned to casual use. If Panasonic
can develop the same thing in the same size but with better imaging,
it'll be a serious contender.</TE>

<HD>Next United Airlines CEO Faces Daunting Task</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A bailout from Uncle Sam isn't the only thing being sought by United
Airlines. The ailing carrier also is searching for a new chief
executive--a job that comes with a double-edged sword of opportunity
and risk.</LD>
<LD>   United and its parent, UAL Corp., are headed by Jack Creighton,
69, a UAL director who became interim CEO last summer after James
Goodwin resigned under pressure.</LD>
<LD>   While Creighton is dealing with United's unions to broker a
recovery plan and secure a $1.8-billion federal loan guarantee, the
airline is looking for his permanent replacement.</LD>
<TE>   UAL offers a chance to turn around an icon of American
business--the kind of challenge and potential reward that a
risk-taking executive craves. But the risk of failure, and its
attendant publicity, is just as great.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really a hot seat," said aviation consultant Michael
Boyd.</TE>
<TE>   United's new CEO will run what's still among the most prestigious
airlines in the world, with 84,000 employees and $17 billion in
annual revenue. But United also is in big trouble, beset with
seemingly intractable problems. The company has been hammered by the
falloff in business travel and the post-Sept. 11 drop in overall air
travel. UAL lost an industry record $2.1 billion last year and is
expected to lose more than $1 billion this year.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the CEO's power to make changes is tempered by the fact that
the airline's employees control 55% of UAL's stock and have seats on
its board.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their shared interest in UAL's performance and stock
price, relations between both sides have deteriorated for years.</TE>
<TE>   That's why many observers don't expect United's next CEO to come
from within its own ranks, except perhaps for United President Rono
Dutta, who has been praised for such strategic moves as building Los
Angeles into a United hub.</TE>
<TE>   Other potential candidates for the post also might be scared off
because labor's clout at United could block a new CEO from making
"some of the really hard choices that are necessary" to fix the
carrier, said Ron Kuhlmann, vice president at Unisys R2A, an airline
consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been talking about this [search] in recent days, and we
couldn't think of anybody crazy enough to do it," Kuhlmann said. UAL,
which hired executive-search firm Russell Reynolds Associates,
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   UAL's board faces another hurdle: It's "in the market for a new
CEO at the same time that Tyco International is looking for a CEO,
TRW is looking and Dynegy is looking," said Peter Crist, vice
chairman of Korn/Ferry International, another executive-search firm.
"When you have a lot of big fish in the water, you have limited
options" in finding the right CEO, he added.</TE>
<TE>   There are several airline executives who might qualify, but UAL's
board might want someone with labor experience from outside the
airline business, to bring a fresh viewpoint.</TE>
<TE>   Creighton is a former CEO of timber giant Weyerhaeuser Co. Gerald
Greenwald, who ran United from 1994 to 1999, came from the auto
industry. Leo Mullin, CEO of Delta Air Lines, was a banker and
utility executive. Continental Airlines' CEO, Gordon Bethune, came
from Boeing Co.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Mulally, CEO of Boeing's commercial airplanes group, is among
those being suggested as a candidate, but he's said he's not bidding
for the job. Another, American Airlines President Gerard Arpey,
already is in line to succeed Donald Carty as CEO of the world's
largest carrier.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a list of other people United might be considering:</TE>
<TE>   * Richard Anderson: Chief executive of Northwest Airlines. He gets
good marks for improving the service and balance sheet at the No. 4
U.S. airline--once dubbed "Northworst" by critics. But he already has
his hands full: Northwest continues to lose money like most of the
major carriers.</TE>
<TE>   * Douglas Steenland: Northwest's president. Assuming Anderson
stays put, Steenland might seek United's job because he's unlikely to
succeed the 46-year-old Anderson for some time. But he was named
president only last year and could be reluctant to jump ship. He and
Anderson declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   * Frederick Reid: President of Delta. Same situation as Steenland
in that he's unlikely to be CEO of Delta any time soon because Mullin
is 59. Reid, 51, became Delta's president only last year but is an
airline veteran. "Fred has told his staff that he's not a candidate
for the job," a Delta spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   * David Calhoun: President of General Electric Co.'s aircraft
engines group. At 45, he's headed various units at the conglomerate
and took over the engines business only two years ago. But GE's
reputation for excellent managers precedes it; former GE executive
Bob Nardelli now runs Home Depot Inc. Calhoun declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   * Gordon Bethune: A proven turnaround artist. He joined
Continental when it was near death in 1994 and turned the airline
into a heralded comeback story. He might be tempted to fix United,
but at age 60 he's plenty busy getting Continental back to
profitability.</TE>
<TE>   * Larry Kellner: Continental's 43-year-old president. Given
Continental's turnaround, "our management team ends up on a lot of
recruiters' wish lists," the airline said.</TE>
<TE>   * Karl Krapek: He unexpectedly resigned in January as president of
United Technologies Corp., where he also once headed its Pratt &amp;
Whitney jet engine unit. Krapek, 53, was in line to be UTC's next
CEO, but he quit for unspecified personal reasons. He couldn't be
reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   * Greg Brenneman: Formerly Bethune's No. 2 at Continental and also
credited with the airline's recovery. At age 40 he's often mentioned
as a potential airline CEO. He planned to head Hawaiian Airlines and
Aloha Airlines after their planned merger, but the deal fell apart
earlier this year. He just became CEO of the consulting arm of
PricewaterhouseCoopers. He declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   * Ron Woodard: Former head of Boeing's commercial airplanes
division until he was fired in 1998 because of costly production
snags at Boeing; he was succeeded by Mulally. Woodard, 59, now
happily runs a small Seattle maker of industrial motor equipment. He
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   * Rakesh Gangwal: A former United executive who was chief
executive of US Airways until November, when he left to pursue
financial management. Gangwal couldn't be reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>Tensions Rise Over Vivendi Leadership</HD>
<DH>Media: Key board members ask Messier to resign as Bronfman
family attempts to arrange an emergency meeting on his future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANITA BUSCH and RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tensions between Vivendi Universal's besieged Chief Executive
Jean-Marie Messier and key board members reached a boiling point over
the weekend, with some members renewing their calls for Messier's
resignation.</LD>
<LD>   The Bronfman family, which owns 5% of the company's shares and is
its single largest shareholder, is trying to convene an emergency
board meeting as early as today to take another vote on Messier's
future as head of the Paris media giant, according to a source close
to the board.</LD>
<LD>   The Bronfmans were livid that Messier survived a vote of
confidence last Tuesday, after he garnered critical support from
European board members, who were said to be reluctant to replace
Messier in the absence of a strong French successor.</LD>
<TE>   Messier's future last week became even more tenuous after Bernard
Arnault, a key board member and ally, resigned because of
frustrations over Messier's handling of recent decisions, including
the selling of a stake in the company's utility business and a recent
complex stock repurchase deal with Deutsche Bank, which fueled
concerns that Vivendi would face a cash crunch.</TE>
<TE>   Last week's meeting exposed a deep divide in the 14-member board
between French and North American board members, including the
Bronfmans. The family has three representatives on the board: Edgar
Bronfman, former Universal Studios head Edgar Bronfman Jr. and Sam
Minzberg, who represents Charles Bronfman. All five of the North
American board members called for Messier's ouster.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Bronfmans and other board members believe they have
enough support to oust Messier when an emergency board meeting can be
called. Several board members have identified a French executive
outside of Vivendi who could step in to replace Messier, according to
the source.</TE>
<TE>   The Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition Sunday
night that some French directors were weighing nominating Jean-Rene
Fourtou, the vice chairman of the supervisory board of Franco-German
pharmaceutical company Aventis, to succeed Messier, at least on an
interim basis. Fourtou, the Journal reported, is a respected
executive in France who used to be CEO of Rhone-Poulenc before it
merged in 1999 with Germany's Hoechst to create Aventis.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg News reported that other possible candidates include
Thierry Breton, who was chosen by the French government in 1997 to
turn around Thomson Multimedia, which sells RCA brand televisions in
the U.S., and Thierry Desmarest, CEO of Total Fina Elf, Europe's
third-largest oil company. Breton and Desmarest have denied being
approached for the job.</TE>
<TE>   "There can't be too many people knocking on Vivendi's door these
days," Valerie Cazaban, who helps manage equity at Stratege Finance
in Paris, told Bloomberg.</TE>
<TE>   The Bronfman family has seen an enormous drop in the value of its
holdings this year as Vivendi's stock prices have fallen more than
60% amid concerns about Messier's leadership, long-term strategy and
the company's debt.</TE>
<TE>   Since taking the helm of Vivendi, Messier has orchestrated a
series of acquisitions to transform a 149-year-old French water
utility into the world's second-largest media company. Among them was
the $34-billion purchase in December 2000 of Seagram Co.'s Universal
Studios and French pay television and film company Canal Plus.</TE>

<HD>WorldCom to File SEC Report</HD>
<DH>Telecom: The document is to explain under oath the firm's
accounting problems and its financial standing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA HALL</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc. will file today a report under oath to federal
regulators detailing its $3.9-billion accounting error, as internal
and external investigators probe its corporate records to determine
if the problem began before 2001, sources familiar with the situation
said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The Clinton, Miss.-based company faces charges of fraud for
accounting irregularities that allowed it to hide $1.2 billion in
losses over the last five quarters--making it one of the largest
accounting scandals in U.S. history.</LD>
<LD>   "We're demanding that they make a statement under oath, telling
the American public exactly what went on there and what their true
financial condition is," Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman
Harvey L. Pitt said Sunday in an interview on ABC's "This Week."</LD>
<TE>   "If there's even an iota of false statement in there, people will
pay heavily. If the truth is in there and people get to know at least
what the circumstances are, then we'll have an informed market, and
there won't be insiders who can play games with the unsuspecting
public," Pitt said.</TE>
<TE>   New accounting scandals from WorldCom and office equipment maker
Xerox Corp. added to the investor distrust created by last year's
collapse of energy trader Enron Corp. and left Wall Street bracing
for more bombshells.</TE>
<TE>   Two congressional committees subpoenaed testimony and documents
from WorldCom executives, while President Bush said the Justice
Department will hold accountable those responsible for any corporate
wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   "WorldCom was the last straw. I think Congress will now pass
something. With midterm elections in the fall, no one wants to hear
the public say, 'You haven't done anything about this,' " said
Margaret Blair, a visiting professor at Georgetown University Law
Center who specializes in corporate governance.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom must provide a detailed report to the SEC before the
stock market opens today. The report, which will be released to the
public, is expected to give investors and lawmakers a clearer
understanding of WorldCom's true financial standing and shed light on
how many executives at the company participated in the scandal,
sources said.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom declined to comment on the report.</TE>

<HD>Xerox Case Isn't Over, SEC Chairman Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKY STAMAS</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Xerox Corp. still is under investigation for inflating
its revenue, and the Securities and Exchange Commission will hold
company officials responsible for any wrongdoing, Chairman Harvey
Pitt said.</LD>
<LD>   The world's biggest copier maker, in a delayed annual report filed
Friday, restated equipment sales from 1997 to 2001 by $6.4 billion,
more than twice as much as the company acknowledged in April.</LD>
<LD>   "Everyone who may have been involved--individuals, officers,
directors and accountants--is still under investigation," Pitt told
ABC's "This Week." "And before much longer, we're going to make all
of them responsible for what they've done."</LD>
<TE>   By shifting the timing and makeup of sales, Xerox was able to meet
earnings forecasts. Xerox was fined a record $10 million by the SEC
in April because of the false reporting of about $3 billion in sales.</TE>
<TE>   The Xerox restatement may lead to new penalties, Pitt said. "We're
not finished with the Xerox case."</TE>
<TE>   Regulators have stepped up scrutiny of corporate accounting since
Enron Corp. filed for bankruptcy protection in December after
overstating income by about $1 billion over four years. The SEC on
Wednesday charged WorldCom Inc., the No. 2 U.S. long-distance
company, with committing fraud by hiding $3.9 billion in costs.</TE>
<TE>   Concerning Xerox's accounting woes, most of the sales came from
transactions in Latin America that should have been reported as
rental revenue, the company said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Former Xerox Chairman Paul Allaire and former Chief Financial
Officer Barry Romeril may be among the executives under
investigation, analysts said. Xerox's auditor, KPMG, also has been
under investigation, its chief executive, Eugene O'Kelly, has said.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt said the change from the $3-billion shortfall disclosed in
April and the $6.4-billion restatement was "a big difference."</TE>
<TE>   "We told this company, 'Not only must you disclose and restate
what we know, we want to know everything,' " Pitt said. "That's what
they've now done. And now those who are responsible will pay."</TE>
<TE>   Pitt turned aside a question by ABC's Sam Donaldson about whether
he will resign. "I took an oath of office and I'm proud of what we're
achieving, and there's more to come," Pitt said.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC is working with Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D-Md.), chairman of
the Senate Banking Committee, in trying to strengthen supervision of
financial reporting, Pitt said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm for whatever Congress does in the end," Pitt said. "The
problem with writing things in stone, however, is that legislation is
very difficult to undo."</TE>

<HD>INS Covers More Ground Than Homeland Security</HD>
<DH>Don't move the agency to a new department.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. ALEXANDER ALEINIKOFF</AU>
<BD>T. Alexander Aleinikoff is a professor at the
Georgetown University Law Center and a senior associate at the
Migration Policy Institute. He was general counsel and executive
associate commissioner of the INS from 1994 to 1997.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The location of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in the
federal government has traditionally reflected the priorities of the
day. In 1913, the Bureau of Immigration was placed in the newly
created Department of Labor. In 1940, when internal security concerns
were paramount, the INS was transferred to the Department of Justice.
So it is not surprising that President Bush would now propose moving
the INS to a new Department of Homeland Security.</LD>
<LD>   The terrorist threat facing the U.S. is overwhelmingly of foreign
origin--all the Sept. 11 hijackers were noncitizens. And it is widely
recognized that the INS needs a thorough overhaul. Thus, transfer of
the INS to a new department seems both prudent and necessary.</LD>
<LD>   Nonetheless, the temptation should be resisted. This quick-fix
solution would undermine reform of the INS, deflect the agency from
its core missions and hinder the formulation of coherent immigration
policy.</LD>
<TE>   The vast majority of immigrants entering the U.S. are from Latin
America and Asia. More than 750,000 green cards are issued each year;
most go to immigrants joining family members or taking jobs for which
there are no available U.S. workers. An additional 60,000 or so
people enter as refugees or are granted political asylum (although
the number of refugees admitted post-Sept. 11 is lower).</TE>
<TE>   The INS also adjudicates several hundred thousand applications for
naturalizations each year. Furthermore, the agency's Border Patrol
makes about 1 million arrests annually at the southwest border; the
vast majority of those picked up there are Mexicans.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign nationals who participate in terrorist activities or
organizations are not entitled to residency cards, enter as visitors
or naturalize. Thus, ensuring there are no terrorists among those
granted admission or citizenship is a crucial function of the INS.
But it is a small part of its overall work.</TE>
<TE>   Of the more than 1 million people stopped at or near the border or
deported from the U.S. each year, only a handful are disqualified on
terrorist grounds. To place the INS in a Department of Homeland
Security, then, is dramatically out of proportion to its tasks.</TE>
<TE>   Based on similar reasoning, why shouldn't the department absorb
the Bureau of Prisons, which imprisons terrorists. Indeed, it is
curious that the Bush proposal leaves the FBI--also part of the
Department of Justice--out of a new department even though the
bureau's work is much more closely related to the fight against
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Equally important, moving the INS to Homeland Security would have
a dramatic influence on the formulation of immigration policy. The
central immigration issues on the table--such as negotiations with
Mexico, temporary worker proposals, more effective removal of
criminal aliens and modification of the overly harsh 1996 immigration
legislation--have little or nothing to do with the fight against
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The debate over restructuring the INS, even after Sept. 11, has
focused on how immigration policymaking and execution can be improved
within the government. It was widely agreed that this requires an
elevation of the agency's functions. But placing the INS as a subunit
in one division of a new department would only further submerge
policy formulation. And it would inevitably view all immigration
issues through the lens of fighting terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, INS officers have a vital role in preventing
terrorists from entering the U.S. The INS stands to benefit from the
centralization of intelligence analysis in a Homeland Security
Department. The agency also can contribute information about patterns
of entry and exit of groups and people. It might even be sensible to
consider plans to merge parts of agencies that work at the border,
such as the Border Patrol and customs. But none of this argues for
placing the entire immigration function and immigration policymaking
in a department established to fight terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   It is easy to see why the Bush administration--exasperated at INS
incompetence--might think that putting the troubled agency in a new
department would be a stimulus for change. But the important task of
reforming the INS would be buried in a Department of Homeland
Security. And the formulation of policy with vital economic, social
and demographic consequences for this nation would be disserved.</TE>

<HD>These 'Teachers' of Democracy Haven't a Clue</HD>
<DH>No Arab nation meets Bush's goals for Palestinians.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRIDA GHITIS</AU>
<BD>Frida Ghitis' latest book is "The End of Revolution: A
Changing World in the Age of Live Television" (Algora Publishing,
2001).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The grand irony of President Bush's plan for the Middle East is that
it sets goals for the Palestinians that none of the United States'
Arab friends in the region could meet. Bush called on the Palestinian
people to "build a practicing democracy based on tolerance and
liberty." All three--democracy, tolerance and liberty--are as
plentiful in the region as forests are in the desert.</LD>
<LD>   Adding to the irony, the president promised that Arab countries,
along with the U.S. and Europe, would help the Palestinian people
build their new democratic institutions. To advocates of political
change in the Arab world, the promise that the same despotic regimes
that put them in prison would help someone else build democracy must
seem peculiar indeed.</LD>
<LD>   Are the Palestinians supposed to learn from, say, Saudi Arabia, a
country where, according to the Human Rights Watch report for 2001,
"freedom of expression and association were nonexistent rights,
political parties and independent local media were not permitted, and
even peaceful anti-government activities remained virtually
unthinkable"?</LD>
<TE>   In fact, before the crisis of the last months, Palestinians living
under the rule of the Palestinian Authority enjoyed more political
freedoms than did most Saudis. This is particularly true of women,
who in Saudi Arabia remain second-class citizens, affording men all
the rights of discrimination. Women are not allowed to travel or get
an education or a job without permission from a male guardian.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the matter of freedom of religion, a subject about
which the Palestinians could teach Saudi Arabia a lesson or two.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the Palestinians can turn to that other good friend of the
U.S.--Egypt--in their search for an education in democracy. That's
the country in which the president won election for a fourth term in
1999, garnering close to 94% of the vote. Now, there's a popularity
rating even President Bush could envy. The Egyptian president, now in
his 21st year in power, faced no opposition. No pesky problems with
hanging chads and butterfly ballots in Egypt's democratic process.</TE>
<TE>   In terms of liberty and tolerance, it's hard to think of Egypt as
the ideal teacher. Religious minorities, political activists and many
others are subjected to the harsh rules of the country's state of
emergency, in place since 1967. And there too, women face the horrors
of so-called honor killings and rampant domestic violence. The U.N.
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women recently
expressed its grave concern about the government's lack of action to
protect women from marital rape, violence in detention centers and
other forms of aggression.</TE>
<TE>   Other countries in the region have made modest progress toward
democratic reform, but not a single one has reached a level that
could qualify it to teach another nation about democracy. In Jordan,
a country ruled by one family since independence, the young King
Abdullah II has continued his late father's slow and careful march
toward greater democracy.</TE>
<TE>   Several Arab countries in the Middle East, particularly in the
Persian Gulf region, are making tentative steps toward democracy, but
the area remains the least democratic in the world. The wave of
democratization that washed over the globe in the last decade somehow
managed to bypass the Arab world. The responsibility for that
belongs, to a large degree, to the U.S. and much of the West,
obsessed with stability in the oil-rich region. Propping up the
despotic regimes of "friends" and "moderates" in the region was seen
as crucial to protecting the flow of oil.</TE>
<TE>   Claiming now that Arab nations will show the way to democracy in a
future Palestinian state is disingenuous at best. The reality is that
the prospect of a true Palestinian democracy is a frightening one for
many of the region's kings and dictators.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians working to develop a real democracy, one with
personal freedoms, a free press, freedom of religion and tolerance
for differing ideas and beliefs, could hardly do worse than imitating
the United States' Arab friends in the region.</TE>

<DH>Medical residents need good supervision, not more sleep.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC SIEGEL</AU>
<BD>Marc Siegel is an assistant professor of medicine at
NYU and author of "Bellevue," about medical residents' training
(Simon &amp; Schuster, 1998).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, which
oversees doctor training throughout the United States, is imposing a
new set of rules that will limit the hours that medical residents can
work. Beginning July 1, 2003, the maximum workweek will be 80 hours,
with no more than 24 hours worked consecutively. These limits, if
followed, could irrevocably change the system for training doctors,
and not entirely for the better.</LD>
<LD>   The age-old caste system for residency training is based on role
modeling and continuity of patient care, where fledgling interns
learn responsibility by doing the rounds with their supervising
residents and following through with their patients.</LD>
<LD>   It is incorrect to assume that sleep deprivation alone is what can
lead to untoward patient outcomes. The greater risks lie with poorly
motivated residents who lack adequate guidance.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, one could easily argue that "shift mentality," wherein an
intern or resident is quick to go home and leave behind a
deteriorating patient, leads to worse outcomes than fatigue.</TE>
<TE>   In part it is the sleepless nights that form a doctor's mettle.
Essential skills learned under military-type rigor are not soon
forgotten and are essential to good doctoring. And many specialties
require emergency middle-of-the-night calls throughout a doctor's
career--it is the on-call shift that prepares a young doctor for the
later demands of practice.</TE>
<TE>   But residents should not be deprived of sleep or kept from going
home in order to perform menial clerical and administrative tasks on
behalf of the hospital. The reason for staying must be strictly
medical.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, bleary-eyed residents are often stuck with
administrative duties that include piles of paperwork. It is not good
for the morale of these new doctors to see nurses and aides going
home while the doctors stay behind to fill out forms.</TE>
<TE>   It is not right for hospitals to use doctors-in-training as
slaves. Residency is an apprenticeship, a complex combination of
learning and simultaneous practitioning. Doctors, molting into
practitioners, are being prepared for future crises that they will
have to manage alone. Just last month in the intensive care unit at
my hospital, a patient was brought back from a middle-of-the-night
cardiac arrest and apparent stroke by the one resident who knew her
case well.</TE>
<TE>   A greater concern than hours is supervision. Eighteen years ago in
New York a young woman named Libby Zion was diagnosed and treated
improperly because of inadequately supervised--not
sleep-deprived--residents. She died. The result of this case was New
York's laws to limit residency hours, yet adequate supervision, the
real problem, was not ensured. This year, an undertrained doctor at a
New York teaching hospital was left in charge of a ward of sick liver
transplant donors and recipients, and a liver donor died.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the accreditation council is too heavily
represented by hospitals to consider a more important step--hiring
more residents. That step would be expensive, and hospitals are
already feeling the pressure of decreasing reimbursements and lengths
of stay. But without more doctors, patients are sure to suffer. If
residents now must go home early, who will stay behind to replace
them?</TE>
<TE>   Overtired residents may one day not be able to keep up with the
ever-deepening pool of technical medical knowledge. For now, however,
no matter how many or how few hours they work, or how early or how
late they go home, insufficient supervision remains the greater
problem.</TE>

<LD>Resign or die. That's what Colombia's narco-guerrillas have told the
nation's municipal  officials. The intention is just as clear as the
threat: The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, wants to
discredit the government by making it unable to protect democratic
rule.</LD>
<LD>   The threat "to kidnap or kill" officials who refused to resign was
issued directly to some officeholders, as well as in a news interview
of FARC's military commander at his hide-out in the mountains of
Cundinamarca near Bogota.</LD>
<LD>   The government has a duty to stand up to the rebels. And it
obviously can't wait for President-elect Alvaro Uribe to take office
next month.</LD>
<TE>   As Times staff writer T. Christian Miller reported Saturday, the
government's battle in parts of rebel territory may be all but lost,
at least for now. City councils have resigned, judges and mayors have
fled, police are gone. Urban centers survive on a heavy military
presence.</TE>
<TE>   As for the rest of the municipalities, the government should
evaluate the levels of risk and provide the most protection to the
most-endangered officials. A few may have to hole up in army
garrisons for a while.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first time the government has endured threats by
the guerrillas, who act increasingly like the forces of the late
Cambodian butcher Pol Pot. In their 38 years of war against the
people of Colombia, FARC comandantes have burned voting cards to
disrupt elections, exploded car bombs on busy streets, blown up
bridges, knocked down power lines and blocked roads to create
economic chaos. During a fight in May with right-wing paramilitaries
in Bellavista, guerrillas killed 119 civilians, including 46
children, who had sought shelter in a church.</TE>
<TE>   The new threat is bigger, aimed at the heart of the democratic
process.</TE>
<TE>   Anne Patterson, U.S. ambassador to Colombia, has offered armored
cars, bulletproof vests and telephones to mayors and other Colombian
civil employees.</TE>
<TE>   Such assistance from the United States should help some. But what
Colombia needs most are signs of solidarity from its neighboring
countries.</TE>
<TE>   The people and the governments of Brazil, Venezuela, Panama,
Ecuador and Peru must unequivocally condemn this latest provocation
of the FARC. One of them could be next if the narco-bandits get away
with murdering a democracy.</TE>

<HD>Pull In Phone Monopoly ...</HD>
<DH>Rates in California could soar if the PUC loses its
regulatory muscle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the state Senate passes a bill by Assemblyman Roderick Wright
(D-Los Angeles), residential and business customers in California
could end up being gouged $3 billion in inflated phone bills over the
next five years.</LD>
<LD>   AB 2958, which would strip the California Public Utilities
Commission of most of its power to regulate monopoly phone companies,
resoundingly passed the Assembly in May. Its principal beneficiary,
SBC Communications, Pacific Bell's parent company, had expected it to
sail through the Senate. After all, the Texas-based company has
contributed nearly half a million dollars to state legislators'
campaigns in just the current election cycle.</LD>
<LD>   However, the Senate Energy, Utilities and Commerce Committee
postponed a vote on the bill that had been set for last week. We can
only hope that the committee's chairwoman, Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina
del Rey), has begun to see AB 2958 for the shameful outrage it is.</LD>
<TE>   The bill would prohibit the PUC, at least until 2007, from using
either of its two tools for ensuring just and reasonable phone rates.
The first tool, "profit sharing," allows the PUC to require phone
companies to split profits in excess of 11.5% with customers. The
second compels phone companies to pass along to customers some of the
cost savings they gain from installing more efficient equipment.</TE>
<TE>   It's not as though the PUC has regulated with a heavy hand. In
fact, the requirement that equipment-efficiency savings be passed on
to customers has never been invoked. But without such limits on the
books, the companies, which are monopolies in most California cities,
will have no incentive to be fair to consumers.</TE>
<TE>   SBC began fiercely stumping for the Wright bill in February, after
a PUC audit found that SBC, by understating its net operating income
by almost $2 billion from 1997 to 1999, had kept $350 million in
excess profit it was supposed to share with California consumers.
Wright, who received $14,000 in campaign donations from PacBell's
political action committee in 2002 alone, promptly threatened to
drastically cut back the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, the PUC's
consumer advocacy arm, which had estimated that Wright's bill could
cost consumers $3 billion. Then AB 2958 sped to the Assembly floor.</TE>
<TE>   There, legislators struck by a collective amnesia over how their
meddling in electricity deregulation in the mid-1990s led to
disastrous energy price hikes and supply shortages, passed the bill
66 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   SBC says it disputes the state's audit and plans to appeal the
findings. Though the company has every right to challenge the math,
it should not be allowed to kill the mathematicians or cripple the
PUC, an agency that Californians had the good sense to create by
constitutional amendment in 1911 to prevent gouging by utility
monopolies.</TE>
<TE>   We encourage Bowen to get rid of the measure in committee. If that
fails, the full Senate should remember what voters thought of
electricity deregulation. If that fails, Gov. Gray Davis should not
hesitate to veto this anti-consumer, lobbyist-driven legislation.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>During last year's frantic energy struggles, the state cobbled
together costly solutions to keep the lights on and didn't pay much
attention to where the energy would come from. Mostly, as it turns
out, from natural gas. Aside from being a nonrenewable fossil fuel,
natural gas is subject to price swings and perhaps market
manipulation. With the crisis under control, the Legislature should
focus on increasing California's use of renewable energy.</LD>
<LD>   A hearing is scheduled today on a long-stalled bill, SB 532, by
Sen. Byron Sher (D-Stanford), that would significantly boost
production of renewable energy sources over the next 10 years.
Lawmakers should get this bill moving and onto the desk of Gov. Gray
Davis for his signature.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, the measure has been held up by public and private
electric utilities' demand for a complicated financing mechanism tied
to estimates of the future price of natural gas. The utilities argue
that such a mechanism would keep down the cost of some renewables.</LD>
<TE>   As one sponsor of the bill notes, the Assembly Utilities and
Commerce Committee, where the bill languishes, is a "hotbed of
utilities' influence." But utilities surely recall the skyrocketing
gas prices of two years ago, a chief cause of the energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Because of uncertainties about cost, the utilities are reluctant
to sign long-term contracts for renewable energy, primarily solar,
wind, geothermal and biomass using agricultural waste. But the
generally smaller firms that produce this power need the contracts to
finance installations.</TE>
<TE>   The goal of the Sher bill--to have 20% of the state's electric
power coming from renewable sources at the end of 10 years--is
certainly realistic. Southern California Edison gets 12% to 14% of
its power from renewable sources now, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric 10% and
Sacramento's municipal utility about 10%. Sempra, serving the San
Diego area and parts of Orange County, and the Los Angeles Department
of Water and Power lag far behind.</TE>
<TE>   The utilities and renewable energy suppliers need to work out a
simple funding mechanism that would be administered by the Public
Utilities Commission, which has about $70 million a year available to
subsidize renewables.</TE>
<TE>   Renewable energy enjoys strong public support. The utilities lost
a lot of public trust during the energy crisis. Sher's measure would
give them a boost, and utilities and lawmakers should embrace it, not
complicate it to death.</TE>

<LD>Re " 'The Body' May Be Gone but the Spirit Will Rock On," Commentary,
June 25:</LD>
<LD>   Matt Bai understands very well the electoral appeal and political
significance of Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura. Whereas term limits
failed to turn out professional politicians and create a new
generation of citizen-politicians, Gov. Ventura was truly that
citizen-politician. Due to the existing political realities, his
background as a professional wrestler and an entertainer told him
when to exit the public stage.</LD>
<LD>   The establishment and elites of the Democratic and Republican
parties should never again dismiss the likes of Ross Perot, Jesse
Ventura and Sen. John McCain. To do so will be at their own electoral
risk.</LD>

<LD>I let out a loud "whoopee" when I read The Times' June 27 front-page

"under God" add-on to the original Pledge of Allegiance. And thanks
for publicizing the history of the pledge. Too few citizens even
realize that the original wording was " ... and to the Republic for
which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice
for all."</LD>
<LD>   I was 11 when they thrust the "under God" edit upon the pledge. I
was offended then as a nonbeliever, and as a firm believer in the
absolute separation between church and state, became more so over the
years. I have refused to utter "those words" when reciting our pledge
for over 47 years. Let the old pledge be restored--glorious, proud
and free. God can go elsewhere.</LD>

<TE>   Newdow's successful prodding of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals to make a momentously myopic decision regarding the Pledge of
Allegiance is ironic on two counts. First, a major contingent of the
American populace will now actually pay attention to the flag salute,
rather than mumbling through it with minds engaged elsewhere, and may
even ponder what it means. Second, Newdow's daughter, purported to be
"injured" by having to endure the pledge in her second-grade class,
will now no doubt be subjected to harassment beyond her father's
wildest dreams. If he was so determined to be the prickly hair on the
tail that would wag the national dog, he should have left her out of
it.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt cooler judicial heads will prevail and overturn this
ruling, as The Times' well-stated editorial ("A Godforsaken Ruling,"
June 27) suggests. In the meantime, those who take the phrase "under
God" seriously can begin by expressing their heartfelt views in a
civilized manner. God is not honored by obscene phone calls to
Newdow, or anyone else.</TE>

<TE>   Re the Newdow ruling on pledge: This is what makes America great
and worth living in; when a regular citizen can challenge the
government and win a ruling in his favor. For people like me who have
grown up in oppressive countries where you couldn't breathe a word
against the ruler, this is a breath of fresh air. This is what makes
the flag worth saluting.</TE>

<TE>   I'm an atheist and, for heaven's sake, I find it absolutely
ridiculous that people with too much time on their hands choose to go
after such petty, worthless issues as the phrase "under God." To
Michael Newdow I say, go get involved with the Wilderness Society or
women's shelters, volunteer at orphanages or hospitals, be a mentor.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of teaching your daughter to really make a difference,
you're showing her how "cool" it is that this country allows
attention-hungry individuals to get their picture in the papers by
way of frivolous lawsuits.</TE>

<TE>   I am a "born-again atheist" and have been for more than 10 years.
I proudly sing our patriotic songs and loudly say the Pledge of
Allegiance in its entirety. However, while most people say the word
"God," I am saying the word "guard." And with George W. Bush taking
away our freedoms day by day, I think I'm singing the right tune.</TE>

<TE>   Gosh, there must be a lot of different Gods around, because so
many different people champion so many different causes all in the
name of God. To settle the current controversy perhaps all we need is
enlightenment. We need to know under whose God, or under which God,
it is that we are indivisible.</TE>

<TE>   Politicians are often criticized for pandering to the masses, but
in light of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals' decision on the
Pledge of Allegiance, who can blame them? Politicians of all stripes
immediately ridiculed the court's well-reasoned opinion (probably
without reading it) and, indeed, it would have been political suicide
to have even suggested that the court's opinion should be read and
considered before passing judgment.</TE>
<TE>   Politicians know the bottom line: that the general public has as
much of an interest in independent thought as a herd of sheep.</TE>

<LD>Re "Health Care Takes Deep Cuts," June 27: Other countries forced to
make similar draconian cuts in their public health systems have seen
outbreaks of dangerous infectious diseases that otherwise could have
been tracked, contained or cured. The cutbacks the Los Angeles County
supervisors were forced to make have increased the probability of
just such an outbreak here.</LD>
<LD>   I would strongly advise the well-to-do in our community not to
think of this as a problem confined to the poor and indigent among
us. It potentially affects everyone. There is no such thing as a
private epidemic.</LD>

$13.4-million Animal Health and Conservation Center--to treat animals
from "rhinos to geckos"--and in the same section of the paper an
article saying that the L.A. County supervisors voted to close 11 of

to me that ignoring the Ralph M. Brown Act is the least of its
violations. How about the rules of compassion and humanity?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Tapping Into Jews' Fears" (June 26), about Morton Klein and his
organization, was offensive to me and I am sure to him. Rather than
reporting on the compelling evidence he brings forward of hatred
toward Jews among Arabs, you chose to focus on his supposed agenda.
Those like Klein who inform us of the true nature of Arab feeling are
the ones reporting the real news, while you look everywhere else.</LD>
<LD>   Billy Wisse</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is not surprising that Klein, pooh-poohed for so long as
extreme, is now in the mainstream of Jewish political positions on
Israel. What is dismaying is the purblindness of the Jewish
establishment in America for decades. Had anyone troubled to look at
schoolbooks in Gaza and the West Bank, even 20 years ago, they would
have found that from the first grade on, children were being taught
arithmetic with problems set like this: "My father killed two Jews on
Saturday, and my brother killed three Jews today. How many Jews have
we killed?"</TE>
<TE>   It is more than Yasser Arafat sending out suicide terrorists. It
is an entire society that has been corrupted into evil from
kindergarteners on.</TE>
<TE>   Jascha Kessler</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In "Bush Declares His Path" (editorial, June 25) you rightly ask
the question, "What criteria will the U.S. use to determine who is an
acceptable representative of the Palestinians?" Perhaps an equally
compelling question is what standards is your paper using to make the
assertion that "Arafat himself was democratically elected"? Here is a
trivia challenge to anyone who thinks Arafat was democratically
elected. Against whom did Arafat run in the 1996 elections? If you
answered Samiha Khalil, a 78-year-old grandmother with no political
experience, you would be correct.</TE>
<TE>   It is no wonder that former CIA Director James Woolsey commented
at the time that Arafat was essentially elected the same way Stalin
was. For the sake of peace in the Middle East, let's hope that
President Bush has a better understanding of democracy than your
paper's editorial board.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After digesting Bush's latest Middle East peace plan it's hard to
know whether to laugh or cry. Thirty-five years of illegal occupation
and this administration arrogantly chooses to remain clueless. Bush's
misbegotten plan, so full of one-sided ifs and buts and insults to
the Palestinians, guarantees only one result--that the conflict will
continue. It's high time that other nations, particularly the
Europeans, get involved, end the occupation and bring this bloody
exercise in colonial conquest to a close.</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Doug Elmore, 63, a former All-Southeastern Conference and University
of Mississippi quarterback, died Friday at Hospice Ministries in
Jackson, Miss. No cause of death was given.</LD>
<LD>   Elmore, inducted into the Ole Miss Sports Hall of Fame in 1990 and
the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame in 1993, played on three of
Johnny Vaught's greatest teams at Ole Miss, when the Rebels were
29-3-1. Elmore played in two Sugar Bowls and one Cotton Bowl. He was
also an all-SEC centerfielder on the baseball team.</LD>
<LD>   The Reform, Ala., native was quarterbacking the Rebels in 1959 in
one of the most memorable games in SEC history, a 7-3 loss to
Louisiana State University marked by Billy Cannon's electrifying
89-yard punt return Halloween night. The loss cost Ole Miss an
undefeated season and probably the national championship. Behind
sophomore Elmore, Ole Miss drove from its 32 to the LSU 2. It came
down to fourth-and-goal with 18 seconds left. Elmore tried to score
off left tackle but was stopped at the 1.</LD>
<TE>   Elmore was drafted by the Washington Redskins in 1962 and played
one season in the NFL. He played in the Canadian Football League in
1963 for Calgary, then coached one year as an assistant at
Southeastern Louisiana College before entering the insurance business
in Jackson in 1965.</TE>

<HD>Irv Kaze, 75; Radio Sports Talk Host</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irv Kaze, who after a multifaceted career as a sports executive
became an award-winning radio sports talk show host, died late
Saturday night after suffering a heart attack. He was 75.</LD>
<LD>   Kaze was taken to Glendale Memorial Hospital after collapsing in a
Glendale restaurant. He never regained consciousness and was
pronounced dead about 11:30 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier Saturday, he had done his regular weekly talk show, "Irv
Kaze on Sports."</LD>
<TE>   Kaze, who had the distinction of working for both George
Steinbrenner and Al Davis during his long and distinguished career as
a sports executive, seemed to know just about everyone in sports.</TE>
<TE>   And everyone seemed to know the affable Kaze.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, he was able to land some of the biggest names in
sports as guests on his radio show over the last 10-plus years.</TE>
<TE>   Kaze began doing his show for KRLA-AM (870), formerly KIEV, in
April 1992. John Wooden was his first guest, and was back on his 10th
anniversary show during this year's NCAA Final Four weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Six times Kaze was named L.A.'s best radio talk host by the
Southern California Sports Broadcasters. His show was the longest
running sports talk show in this market.</TE>
<TE>   Kaze was born Sept. 2, 1926, in Worcester, Mass. His family moved
to Brooklyn when Kaze was 1 and after his father died six years
later, he and his mother moved in with his mother's parents in Jersey
City, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Kaze went to high school in Jersey City and attended New York
University.</TE>
<TE>   While in college, he worked as a sportswriter for the New York
Post.</TE>
<TE>   He later moved to Southern California and did publicity for the
Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League. He moved up to the
parent Pittsburgh Pirates when the Dodgers moved from Brooklyn to
L.A. in 1958.</TE>
<TE>   With the Pirates, Kaze helped develop the "save" rule in baseball
for relief pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   He also spent two years with CBS Sports in New York, during which
time he helped develop the "checkered" center line for the National
Hockey League, which the league still uses.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to L.A. as the first public relations director of the
Los Angeles (now Anaheim) Angels.</TE>
<TE>   When Davis became commissioner of the American Football League in
1966, Kaze joined his staff.</TE>
<TE>   After the AFL merged with the National Football League, he became
business manager and assistant to the president of the San Diego
Chargers for seven years.</TE>
<TE>   Other baseball stints included time with the National League as
administrator for communications. Among his responsibilities was the
development of the league's centennial program and promotion, which
included a CBS-TV film on the league's 100th year.</TE>
<TE>   Turning to basketball, he served as vice president and general
manager of the San Diego Clippers during the team's inaugural years.</TE>
<TE>   Kaze returned to New York to be the media relations director for
Steinbrenner's New York Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   Kaze rejoined Davis when the Raiders moved to Los Angeles in 1982,
and served as the team's senior administrator for eight years.</TE>
<TE>   Kaze had both a Super Bowl ring from his time with the Raiders and
a World Series ring from his tenure with the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   He later served as commissioner of the Continental Basketball
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Besides being honored by the Southern California Broadcasters,
Kaze was honored by the New York Baseball Writers Assn. He was also a
member of the Orange County Sports Hall of Fame and the Southern
California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcaster Keith Olbermann, who is now with ABC Radio, said, "He
was such an extraordinary man and I have known no one in his field
who worked so long yet preserved so much of his humanity and good
humor."</TE>
<TE>   Olbermann said that his eulogy for Kaze today on his "Speaking of
Sports" program would include the comment: "There was no stadium or

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Major league baseball teams called Roland Latina "the Glove Doctor."
Latina, the retired chief glove designer at Rawlings Sporting Goods
Co. in St. Louis, died Tuesday of cancer at his home in Belleville,
Ill. He was 78.</LD>
<LD>   Latina was born in East St. Louis, Ill., and was a gunner for the
Navy during World War II. He worked for Rawlings at its St. Louis
headquarters for 39 years until 1986, and designed two major
trademark features in today's gloves--the closed-back glove with an
index-finger opening, and the basket web.</LD>
<LD>   In the 1970s, he worked with Hall of Famer Johnny Bench to design
a new catcher's mitt when the Cincinnati Reds catcher kept his
throwing hand behind his back while he caught.</LD>
<TE>   The designer's father, Harry "Doc" Latina, also worked at
Rawlings. At one time, father and son held about 90% of all baseball
glove patents in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The Latinas' glove designs were used by Stan Musial, Mickey
Mantle, Brooks Robinson and Roberto Clemente, among others.</TE>
<TE>   Besides his wife, he is survived by three daughters, Ronda Latina
and Cynthia Schuessler, both of Belleville, and Linda Mitchell of
Freeburg, Ill.; a sister, Carol Logan of Pekin, Ill.; and six
grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Maia Wojciechowska, 74; Author of Books for Children and
Young Adults</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a child in Poland in the 1930s, she parachuted out of an airplane
three times before she was 11. And at 12 she fled the invading Nazis
with her mother and two brothers through Romania and Italy to join
her father, the chief of staff of the Polish air force, in France.</LD>
<LD>   As a young woman, she worked briefly as an undercover detective
and raced motorcycles in the United States. She also developed a
passion for bullfighting and had a stint as a matador in Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   But Maia Wojciechowska, who died June 13 at the age of 74 after
suffering a stroke in Long Branch, N.J., found her greatest fame as a
Newbery Medal-winning author of books for young adults and children.</LD>
<TE>   Wojciechowska wrote 19 published books, including "The Hollywood
Kid," "Tuned Out" and "The Rotten Years." Her adventurous life and
plucky nature inspired her to create characters who courageously
confront their problems.</TE>
<TE>   She also wrote the autobiographical "Till the Break of Day:
Memories, 1939-1942" and, in 1980, successfully entered the world of
adult fiction with her critically acclaimed novel, "The People in His
Life." The book was published under her former married name, Maia
Rodman, and was based on the life of Ernest Hemingway, whom she had
spent a day with at his home in Cuba in 1952.</TE>
<TE>   Hemingway praised Wojciechowska at the time for her understanding
of bullfighting, and they maintained a long correspondence on their
shared passion.</TE>
<TE>   Bullfighting served as the subject of two of Wojciechowska's
children's books, "The Life and Death of a Brave Bull" and "Shadow of
a Bull," which earned her the prestigious Newbery Medal in 1965. The
award is presented annually for the most distinguished contribution
to American literature for children.</TE>
<TE>   "Shadow of a Bull" is the story of a Spanish boy who dreams of
becoming a doctor but is expected to fight and kill his first bull at
12, emulating his father, a champion bullfighter who died in the
ring.</TE>
<TE>   Calling Wojciechowska "a magnificent writer," a reviewer for The
New York Times Book Review described "Shadow of a Bull" as "an
eloquent, moving book."</TE>
<TE>   Newbery Medal committee members agreed that the novel, which has
been translated into 18 languages and is now in its 68th printing,
"epitomizes all humanity's struggle for conquest of fear and
knowledge of self."</TE>
<TE>   In her Newbery acceptance speech, which she directed to her young
readers, Wojciechowska discussed her commitment to write about the
problems that confront young people, including pressures to conform.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to give you a glimpse of the choices you have before you,"
she said, "Of the price that will be asked of you.... When you know
what life has to sell, for how much, and what it can give away free,
you will not live in darkness."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Warsaw on Aug. 7, 1927, Wojciechowska contracted
tuberculosis from her wet nurse and didn't speak until she was 4 1/2
years old.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a very sadistic governess who used to delight in
frightening me about things like ladies who ate bad children," she
told the Bergen Record newspaper in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   She said that when she did speak for the first time--at the dinner
table on Christmas eve--her first words were, "Why must the world be
so cruel?"</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up to cultivate courage," she told the Record. "My big
thing was to fear nothing--maybe God. I was scared doing things like
jumping with a parachute, but I did it."</TE>
<TE>   After fleeing to France during the war, her family sought refuge
in Spain and Portugal before arriving in the United States in 1942.
Wojciechowska's father, who had been chief of staff of the Polish air
force in Britain, became air attache to the Polish Embassy in
Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   After the family moved to Los Angeles, Wojciechowska attended
Sacred Heart Academy and in 1946 dropped out of Immaculate Heart
College in Hollywood after a year.</TE>
<TE>   Married in 1950 to author Selden Rodman, she published her first
book two years later, "Market Day for Ti Andre," a story for children
illustrated by a primitive artist she and her husband had met on
trips to Haiti.</TE>
<TE>   While married to Rodman, she visited Hemingway and his fourth
wife, Mary, at their home in Cuba. Wojciechowska already knew
Hemingway's second wife, Pauline, and had taught tennis to two of the
author's sons in Key West.</TE>
<TE>   "I suppose because I adored Hemingway I remember that day so
well," she told The Times in 1980 when her Hemingway-inspired novel
was published. "His book 'Across the River and Into the Trees' had
just come out and was attacked as the most sentimental slush. He was
very upset about the reception to this book, which he obviously
liked, and I said to him, 'My God, you have earned the right as a
writer to write a sentimental love story if you want to.'</TE>
<TE>   "And so he liked me for that, and he liked me for being pregnant,
and also a third thing that was dear to him, I had seen Manolete, a
bullfighter who was the best bullfighter in the world. Hemingway said
I understood more about bullfighting when I first saw it than any
woman he had ever talked to."</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1960s, Wojciechowska, whose long resume included
masseuse, waitress, Radio Free Europe translator and professional
tennis player, worked as a literary agent in New York and served as
publicity manager for Hawthorn Books.</TE>
<TE>   Her commitment to quality children's literature led her to found
her own publishing company, Independent Books, in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   She divorced Rodman in 1957. Her brief second marriage to a poet
and antique restorer, Richard Larkin, ended in divorce in 1973.</TE>
<TE>   She is survived by two daughters, Oriana Rodman of Santa Fe, N.M.,
and Leonora Wojciechowska of Garfield, N.J.; and her brothers,
Zbigniew Wojciechowska of Laguna Hills, and Christopher Wojciechowska
of Pebble Beach.</TE>

<HD>Marine Life Withers Under a Wave of Human-Caused Diseases</HD>

<AU>OSHA GRAY DAVIDSON</AU>
<BD>Osha Gray Davidson is author of "Fire in the Turtle
House" (Public Affairs, 2001).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is hardly news that the oceans are in trouble. After all, it's
been more than three decades since the late Jacques-Yves Cousteau
first introduced millions of television viewers to the glories of the
undersea world and to the havoc that humans had already begun
wreaking on marine life.</LD>
<LD>   But even the old Frenchman-of-the-sea himself would be shocked by
the conditions we've created in the oceans today, especially in
coastal waters, the shores and bays where most people come to know
and enjoy the sea. These waters are sick and growing sicker by the
day. In recent years, a startling number of marine epidemics has been
burning through populations of sea creatures to the point that
extinction threatens some species.</LD>
<LD>   Some of these plagues are old and well-known, reawakened with
unexpected virulence. Others are caused by pathogens new to science.
After years of speculation, two recent studies go much further than
ever in implicating humans in this "marine metademic." A study
published recently in the journal Science suggests that ocean waters
heated by global warming are allowing bacteria, fungi and viruses to
reproduce faster and range farther, unchecked by the older, cooler
cycles of climate.</LD>
<TE>   Global warming plays an important role, but it alone doesn't fully
explain the devastating marine outbreaks. For years humans have also
been flooding coastal waters with nutrients. Agricultural runoff from
fields and giant feedlots flows into rivers and eventually finds its
way to the sea, providing a veritable smorgasbord for disease-causing
organisms.</TE>
<TE>   This overabundance of nutrients--and the introduction of human
sewage in some places--plays a critical role in the marine metademic.
Take the case of elkhorn coral. This magnificent branching coral was
once the most abundant reef-building species in the Caribbean. Now it
is virtually wiped out.</TE>
<TE>   The result is an ecological catastrophe: a shift from
spectacularly biodiverse coral reefs, sometimes called the "rain
forests of the sea," to algae-covered rubble. The puzzle of this
massive die-off was partly solved when a team of scientists announced
recently that it had isolated the agent responsible for one of the
diseases: the bacterium Serratia marcescens. The name may be
unfamiliar, yet it is not an exotic deep-sea pathogen but one
commonly found in human feces and sewage.</TE>
<TE>   The list of human insults to the ocean goes beyond global warming
and introduction of nutrients. We overfish nearly everywhere,
eliminating herbivorous fish that once kept harmful algae in check.
We drain wetlands and dredge channels and harbors, turning clear,
sandy-bottom areas into muck-covered wastelands, a perfect medium for
microbes. We're turning our coast into a giant petri dish, a
pathogen-friendly environment in which microbes flourish at the
expense of sea life.</TE>
<TE>   It is possible to return our coastal waters to health, but it will
require action on a number of fronts. We must fight global warming by
implementing the Kyoto Protocol and by stopping the absurd dithering
over whether the problem even exists, as the Bush administration
continues to do. We must include agricultural runoff under the Clean
Water Act; increase the number of marine protected sanctuaries where
aquatic life can regroup from human assaults; and fully fund the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</TE>
<TE>   A century before Cousteau opened our eyes to the wondrous world
beneath the waves and the destruction we're causing there, the father
of modern pathology, Rudolph Virchow, wrote that "epidemics are like
signposts from which the statesman of stature can read that a
disturbance has occurred in the development of his nation that not
even careless politics can overlook." It is past time to heed the
many watery signposts alerting us that all is not well in the nation
of the sea.</TE>

<LD>A bomb was found attached to the car of an American hospital worker
in Saudi Arabia, and what was called a "suspicious object" was
located on a Briton's vehicle, according to the U.S. Embassy.</LD>
<LD>   The devices, both found in the capital, Riyadh, were removed
without incident, the embassy said.</LD>
<LD>   It said an American employee at King Faisal Specialist Hospital

in an election seen as a challenge for democracy in Bolivia, South
America's poorest country.</LD>
<LD>   Since Bolivia's political system requires majority support for an
outright victory, the president will be chosen by a new Congress from
the two top vote-getters--multimillionaire Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada
and longtime Cochabamba Mayor Manfred Reyes Villa.</LD>
<LD>   Sanchez de Lozada, president from 1993 to 1997 and an owner of
Bolivia's largest mining company, had 21.7% of the vote, while Reyes
Villa had 20.2%, according to local media projections, based on
unofficial results from 93% of the votes.</LD>

<HD>Dispute May End U.N. Role in Bosnia</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: U.S. clashes with allies in a failed bid to win
global court immunity, then vetoes an extension of Balkans
peacekeeping mission.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>In a rare and heated confrontation with its closest allies on the
Security Council, the United States moved Sunday to halt U.N.
peacekeeping operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina after the council
refused to grant U.S. participants immunity from the new
International Criminal Court.</LD>
<LD>   Drastic American action is necessary to protect U.S. peacekeepers
from "politicized prosecutions before a court whose jurisdiction over
our people the government of the United States does not accept," U.S.
Ambassador John D. Negroponte said shortly before vetoing what was
once expected to be a routine six-month extension of the Bosnian
missions, established in the wake of a U.S.-brokered peace pact in
1995.</LD>
<LD>   The International Criminal Court entered into legal force today,
despite U.S. opposition, and Sunday's veto was part of a continuing
Bush administration campaign to shield U.S. soldiers and officials
abroad from court prosecutions.</LD>
<TE>   "This decision is not directed at the people of Bosnia,"
Negroponte told the council, suggesting that the missions there might
be continued without U.N. resources or leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "We will stand by them and by our commitment to peace and
stability in the Balkans. The fact that we are vetoing this
resolution in the face of that commitment, however, is an indication
of just how serious our concerns remain about the risks to our
peacekeepers."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. veto Sunday capped weeks of negotiations with Britain and
France, fellow veto-wielding members of the council and strong
backers of the new court. But the allies failed to avert a collision
with Washington on the issue. The United States is the only member of
the United Nations to announce its intention to protect all of its
citizens from prosecution by the international court.</TE>
<TE>   "While we understand the U.S. concerns concerning the court, we do
not share them," Jeremy Greenstock, the British ambassador here, said
crisply after the U.S. veto. In the council debate that preceded the
U.S. veto, Greenstock and other European ambassadors argued that the
International Criminal Court treaty protects peacekeeping forces from
democracies with strong independent judiciaries.</TE>
<TE>   Privately, European diplomats have voiced mounting resentment in
recent weeks at what they describe as intense U.S. pressure to grant
American soldiers and officials abroad blanket protection from the
court, which has now been ratified by every member of the European
Union.</TE>
<TE>   Such a move would undercut the court before it begins work, the
Europeans argue. Giving any peacekeepers immunity from war crimes and
genocide prosecutions would be especially damaging to the court's
authority in places like Bosnia, East Timor and Central Africa, they
say.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Americans are convinced that their concerns are not
being taken seriously, but we think that our commitment to the court
is not being taken seriously," said one European diplomat, who asked
not to be named.</TE>
<TE>   After the U.S. veto, council members scrambled to arrange what
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called "an orderly wind-down" of
the U.N.'s Bosnia operations, which include a 1,500-strong police
training mission with 46 U.S. members and a larger force, endorsed by
the U.N. but led by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, with
2,500 U.S. troops. The council agreed to extend both for 72 hours,
until midnight Wednesday, but diplomats said this was only to give
force leaders time to end or reorganize their operations.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. mission in Bosnia is coming "to an abrupt end for reasons
that are unrelated to the vitally important work that it is
performing to implement the Dayton peace agreement," Annan said after
the U.S. voted against the extension.</TE>
<TE>   Without its U.N. mandate, which includes direct U.N. financing and
management, the police training mission in Bosnia would have to cease
operations entirely, officials here had said earlier. But the
European Union, which was scheduled to assume control of the mission
in 2003, might be able to accelerate its takeover, Annan suggested
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The NATO force could remain in place under its own authority,
American diplomats here said, adding that the United States has no
immediate plans to withdraw its troops. But because of statutory or
constitutional constraints, Germany, Ireland and other contributors
cannot participate in peacekeeping forces that lack explicit U.N.
authorization, according to U.N. legal advisors. Commanders of NATO
forces in Bosnia plan to discuss the dispute in a meeting in Brussels
today, Greenstock said.</TE>
<TE>   As Negroponte made clear Sunday, the U.S. action was aimed not
primarily at the Bosnia operation but at all U.N. peacekeeping
missions, which must normally be reauthorized every six months.
American diplomats said Sunday that a complete withdrawal from all
U.N. peacekeeping operations is possible if immunity from the
international court cannot be granted. Though the United States
provides relatively few troops to U.N. peace missions, its
participation is considered crucial in politically sensitive regions
like the Balkans and the Middle East, and it provides about a third
of the overall U.N. peacekeeping budget.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not a question of one mission or another, it is a question
of peacekeeping in general, and until we reach a satisfactory
resolution of this issue, it is going to come up over and over
again," Negroponte told reporters here.</TE>
<TE>   In council debate Sunday, British and French diplomats assailed
the policy with unusual vigor. The U.S. position on the Bosnia
mission "is difficult for us to understand," said Jean-David Levitte,
the French ambassador here, noting that U.S. troops had been serving
there for seven years without any special exemptions from the
U.N.-authorized war crimes tribunal at The Hague. And Greenstock,
normally a staunch defender of the United States in council
proceedings, suggested that if Britain is confident that it can keep
its peacekeepers from ever appearing before the new tribunal, the
United States should have even less to fear, both as a nonsignatory
nation and as the globe's sole superpower.</TE>
<TE>   But Negroponte said that, "with our global responsibilities, we
are and will remain a special target, and cannot have our decisions
second-guessed by a court whose jurisdiction we do not recognize."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. was alone in its opposition to renewal of the Bosnia
mission Sunday. And it failed to win support for a proposed
resolution that would grant immunity from the court to all U.N.
peacekeepers from nonsignatory nations--a category that now applies
exclusively to U.S. personnel.</TE>
<TE>   American officials have rejected as inadequate bilateral
agreements protecting U.S. forces against possible international
court prosecutions, though Bosnia and other countries that host
foreign peacekeeping forces have said they would be open to such
arrangements. European diplomats have discussed other possible legal
guarantees with U.S. officials here; one would invoke a provision of
the International Criminal Court treaty that lets the Security
Council request a 12-month hiatus in any court prosecution or
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   But these formulas implicitly acknowledge the court's legal
authority and might not satisfy opponents of the court in the Bush
administration and in Congress, diplomats and other observers here
said. American diplomats said Sunday that they did not have
authorization from Washington to pursue such legal compromises.</TE>
<TE>   Court proponents, meanwhile, saw Sunday's action as the initial
salvo in what they expect to be an increasingly aggressive Bush
administration campaign against the new tribunal. "This is the first
U.S. blow against the court, but it surely won't be the last," said
Richard Docker, an expert on the International Criminal Court at
Human Rights Watch.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the U.N. building Sunday, a knot of protesters from U.S.
human rights groups waved placards urging council members not to
surrender to "U.S. blackmail" against the court.</TE>
<TE>   As of Sunday, the International Criminal Court treaty had been
formally ratified by 74 of the 139 countries that originally signed
the document, with more ratifications expected by Tuesday. Delegates
from signatory countries are gathering here this week to adopt rules
for the selection of prosecutors and judges, who are expected to
assume their posts at the new court's headquarters in The Hague early
next year.</TE>

<HD>Five Years After Hand-Over, Hong Kong Feeling a Bit Blue</HD>
<DH>Asia: The former British colony has a struggling economy,
weak leaders and diminishing rights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HONG KONG</DL>
<LD>Just behind the computer monitor on the desk of his 12th-floor
office, Chief Secretary Donald Tsang keeps a framed Fortune magazine
cover from 1995 with this prediction: "The Death of Hong Kong."</LD>
<LD>   Published more than two years before the then-British colony
returned to Chinese rule, the article sketched a doomsday scenario
that included People's Liberation Army soldiers strolling the streets
to enforce the diktats of hundreds of recently arrived Communist
Party officials.</LD>
<LD>   Five years after capitalist Hong Kong passed into the hands of
Communist China, Fortune's forecast seems excessive, its death notice
premature.</LD>
<TE>   But as Tsang and others in this Special Autonomous Region mark the
fifth anniversary today of Hong Kong's hand-over, the outcome of this
fascinating political experiment remains loaded with question marks,
and the dangers to Hong Kong are far more subtle than initially
believed.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the experiment faces a disturbing set of
difficulties--problems that include a struggling economy, an erosion
of personal freedom, and weak leaders who appear to have no clear
path or vision for the future.</TE>
<TE>   Collectively, these problems have sapped much of the optimism and
spirit that enabled a community mainly of refugees fleeing the
mainland's turmoil in the wake of World War II to transform Hong Kong
from a sleepy British imperial outpost into an energy-charged global
financial center.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no sense of security for our future now," said Mandy Ho,
a secretary. "The politicians all seem lost."</TE>
<TE>   Said a 40-year-old civil servant named Hueng, who declined to
provide his first name: "I'm worried about unemployment, that
business will move to the mainland. I don't believe in the ability of
our leaders."</TE>
<TE>   In part, Hong Kong's problems have to do far less with Beijing's
political control than with China's emergence as an increasingly open
global economic power. China's entry into the World Trade
Organization ended Hong Kong's lock on the country's international
trade, reducing it in effect to just one of several large Chinese
trading centers.</TE>
<TE>   Shanghai looms to challenge Hong Kong's historical role as the
dominant commercial center. Hong Kong's lucrative position as a
middleman in the trade between Taiwan and mainland China appears also
about to end as Beijing and Taipei search for ways of opening direct
trade links across the Taiwan Strait.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Hong Kong clings to one of its few remaining claims: an
efficient, corruption-free center for financial services.</TE>
<TE>   Hong Kong had yet to fully recover from the 1997 Asian financial
crisis when it was hit by last year's economic decline and then by
the aftershocks from Sept. 11. The result of all this has been record
unemployment, plummeting property values, low public morale and civil
service pay cuts. This year's expected economic growth of 1% is a
fraction of the 7% projected for the mainland.</TE>
<TE>   Signs on the region's buses urge, "Bounce Back Hong Kong" but do
little to brighten the public mood.</TE>
<TE>   Under the terms of the hand-over, Hong Kong became part of China
yet kept considerable autonomy and human rights under a formula that
became known as "one country, two systems."</TE>
<TE>   But the percentage of those feeling optimistic about Hong Kong's
prospects as a part of China dropped from 62% in early 1997 to 26%
this May, according to figures gathered by the Hong Kong Transition
Project, which has tracked public attitudes about the region's
transfer to Chinese rule.</TE>
<TE>   In a discussion with reporters last week, the territory's
financial secretary, Anthony Leung, found himself comparing its woes
to those of Japan before adding quickly, "I just hope it won't take
as long as Japan to correct them."</TE>
<TE>   Hong Kong's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, is widely seen as part
of the region's problem rather than a source of solutions.</TE>
<TE>   A much-ballyhooed reform scheduled to go into effect today that
transforms his Cabinet from one of job-secure civil servants to
political appointees seems for many more like a rearranging of deck
chairs than a serious streamlining for a new start.</TE>
<TE>   The Tung era's leading commercial initiative, an information
technology industrial park called Cyberport, is widely seen as a
flop. Handed to a property baron's son two years ago for development
as an incubator for innovative ideas, it languishes today on the
south side of Hong Kong island, a symbol more of the failures of
crony capitalism than of the seeds of Hong Kong's future.</TE>
<TE>   With polls showing that less than 20% of the public wanted Tung to
seek another term, there is little enthusiasm among those who realize
that today also marks the start of his second five-year tenure as
Hong Kong's leader.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody's happy with the government under these circumstances,"
Leung said. "But whether everyone should tag this to Tung Chee-hwa is
another question. This [economic] correction would have happened
whoever took over."</TE>
<TE>   The distinct lack of enthusiasm for Tung's reelection underscores
worrisome shortcomings in the promised development of Hong Kong's
democratic political system. Although the territory's de facto
constitution still carries a commitment to full electoral democracy,
progress toward that goal has been slow.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 6.9 million Hong Kong Chinese, a grand total of 800
handpicked residents--all of them approved by Beijing--reelected Tung
this spring. That's double the 400 who voted Tung into office just
before the hand-over, but any move toward full electoral
participation seems years away.</TE>
<TE>   There is also concern about a gradual erosion of human rights,
political freedoms and the rule of law since Beijing's takeover. The
prime actors in this aren't Beijing hard-liners or PLA jackboots, as
many had predicted. Instead, the weakening has been initiated largely
locally, either by Hong Kong's leaders trying to guess Beijing's will
or as the result of simple self-censorship.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence of this erosion is abundant.</TE>
<TE>   Last month alone, Hong Kong immigration officials refused entry to
Chinese American human rights advocate Harry Wu, then questioned
distinguished U.S. scholar Perry Link for 40 minutes before allowing
him in. Link, co-author of a book called "The Tiananmen Papers" about
the debate within the Chinese hierarchy surrounding the tumultuous
1989 student revolt, said he had never been stopped on several
previous trips to Hong Kong.</TE>
<TE>   "It says a lot about the promise of five years ago that the one
country, two systems would hold for 50 years," he said. He said the
mere fact that he was pulled aside and questioned will probably
intimidate at least some colleagues from coming.</TE>
<TE>   Tight restrictions on groups such as the Falun Gong spiritual
movement, outlawed on the mainland, are also cited as examples of
Hong Kong authorities following Beijing's lead--possibly on their own
initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Sonny Lo, a Hong Kong University political scientist and
Transition Project member, said he believes that a further erosion of
freedoms is inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a clash of civilizations between China and the West," he
said. "And 150 years of Western influence [under the British] can't
compete with thousands of years of influence from China."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the difficulties, no one--not even Fortune--is predicting
Hong Kong's demise as a major commercial center. In a more recent
issue, the magazine dismissed the territory's goal of becoming the
New York of Asia but conceded that if it succeeded in integrating
economically with fast-growing Guangdong province and the rest of
southern China, Hong Kong could become the Chicago of China.</TE>

<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>JERUSALEM -- An Israeli tank shelled a house in the West Bank city of
Nablus on Sunday, killing a suspected Hamas bomb maker whose work is
blamed for the deaths of at least 100 Israelis in suicide bombings.</LD>
<LD>   Israel also started building a towering electronic fence that will
protect three sides of Jerusalem against Palestinian attacks, Defense
Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said on a visit to the area. In the
assault in Nablus, the army said, special forces killed Mohammed
Tahir, described as a local leader of the militant Islamic movement
Hamas. Attacks attributed to Tahir included the June 18 bombing of a
Jerusalem bus that killed 19 people and the June 1, 2001, attack on a
Tel Aviv disco that killed 21, the army said.</LD>
<LD>   A Tahir aide was also killed and another Hamas activist was
seriously hurt, the army said.</LD>
<TE>   The army on Sunday oversaw the evacuation of two tiny,
unauthorized outposts for Jewish settlers in the southern West Bank,
near Beit Haggai and Maale Hever, army radio reported.</TE>
<TE>   Israel has almost 150 government-authorized settlements in the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip, where about 210,000 Israelis live.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Sunday, a bomb exploded on a railway in central Israel as
a passenger train passed by, damaging one car but causing no serious
injuries, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The explosion took place just north of the city of Lod, and police
said they believed that the device was planted during the night. A
Palestinian was detained for questioning near the site of the
explosion, police said.</TE>

<HD>Rocket Man Poised to Shoot to Presidency</HD>
<DH>India: Election of A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, father of nuclear
program and a Muslim, would signal armed might as well as respect for
minorities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI</DL>
<LD>Choosing a president is India's way of putting its best face forward,
and the likely election of a national hero known as the Missile Man
sends a message to the world.</LD>
<LD>   India's Parliament and state assemblies are expected to vote on
the largely ceremonial post in mid-July, and the power brokers appear
to have settled on their candidate: A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, 71, the
father of India's nuclear missile program.</LD>
<LD>   He also happens to be a Muslim, like most of the people in
neighboring Pakistan--India's main nuclear rival--and like thousands
of Indians driven from their homes by Hindu mobs during weeks of
unrest in the western state of Gujarat.</LD>
<TE>   Kalam's surprise nomination by both the ruling coalition and the
opposition is meant to say that India respects its minorities--and is
a nuclear power that shouldn't be toyed with, political observers
say. It may also be a political masterstroke for a Hindu nationalist
government that needs the kind of popularity boost that a rocket
scientist can deliver.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, when war with Pakistan seemed close and the threat of
nuclear strikes loomed large, Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee was struggling to find a replacement for incumbent President
Kocheril Raman Narayanan.</TE>
<TE>   Narayanan, a favorite of the opposition Congress Party, rose from
the poverty and discrimination that have cursed low-caste Dalits for
centuries. He studied at the London School of Economics and served as
India's ambassador to several countries, including the U.S. and
China, before being elected president in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Narayanan is following tradition and stepping down after one term
in office. A disappointed Vice President Krishnan Kant is accepting
that Vajpayee won't allow him to follow tradition and succeed
Narayanan.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves Kalam with little competition, especially since
Congress Party leader Sonia Gandhi joined Vajpayee in nominating
Kalam for president.</TE>
<TE>   The quirky bachelor, respected as much for his humility as his
unabashed faith in nationalism and nuclear deterrence, is a living
symbol of the country's new sense of power and pride. He also is the
attack-proof candidate Vajpayee sent his strategists looking for.</TE>
<TE>   Only India's raucous left wing is trying to deny Kalam the
presidency, although its candidate, Lakshmi Sehgal, 87, has been
quick to point out that she admires the nuclear scientist and has
nothing against him personally.</TE>
<TE>   But having Kalam, the brains behind India's nuclear weapons
program, as head of state "is sending a wrong signal at a time when
the India-Pakistan border is tense," she told reporters recently.</TE>
<TE>   Sehgal knows a thing or two about war herself. She was a brigade
commander in the rebel Indian National Army that fought British rule
in the 1940s and says she is now fighting a political battle to
preserve a fragile Indian unity and women's rights.</TE>
<TE>   Although India's presidents usually are far removed from
day-to-day governing, the splintering of the country's politics often
leaves disputes for them to resolve.</TE>
<TE>   If, as expected, no single party wins a majority in the next
scheduled national legislative elections, in 2004, it could fall to
Kalam to decide which of the leading parties should be allowed to try
to form a government in Parliament, where the prime minister is
chosen not by direct, popular vote, but according to how many seats
his party or coalition loyalists control.</TE>
<TE>   Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party, which isn't likely to win a
majority of seats at the polls, may be betting that Kalam will return
the favor of his elevation to the presidency by giving the BJP first
crack at forming a government, even if the Hindu nationalist party
and its allies don't win a convincing electoral victory.</TE>
<TE>   Kalam has no political experience, which makes him attractive both
to the politicians who may hope to manipulate him and to the millions
of Indians who are fed up with the corrupt, and often inept,
political establishment.</TE>
<TE>   The Hindu extremist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh movement, or RSS,
normally doesn't have many kind words for India's Muslim minority,
but it is overjoyed by the nuclear cachet that Kalam would bring to
the presidency.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not concerned about his religion at all," said Seshadri
Chari, editor of the movement's newspaper, the Organizer. "He is a
good Indian, an ideal Indian."</TE>
<TE>   Chari, whose organization often questions the patriotism of
India's roughly 140 million Muslims, said he considers Kalam "a good
Muslim, and we want all Indian Muslims to emulate him."</TE>
<TE>   "He has a vision of a great India, a powerful India, and we share
that vision," the editor added.</TE>
<TE>   Chari is such a fan of Kalam that he tracked down a speech the
scientist gave six months ago and printed it in a recent edition of
the Organizer.</TE>
<TE>   It quoted Kalam praising Israel, a close military ally of India,
for having news media that he said were much more positive than
India's and more willing to trumpet their nation's achievements.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in Tel Aviv once, and I was reading the Israeli newspaper,"
Kalam said, according to the Organizer article. "It was the day after
a lot of attacks and bombardments and deaths had taken place. The
Hamas had struck.</TE>
<TE>   "But the front page of the newspaper had the picture of a Jewish
gentleman who, in five years, had transformed the desert land into an
orchard and a granary. It was this inspiring picture that everyone
woke up to."</TE>
<TE>   It's the kind of lateral thinking that served Kalam well as a
scientist but could get him into trouble as a head of state.</TE>
<TE>   For now, he's getting away with saying whatever comes to mind and
publicly scolding pushy journalists at news conferences who shout the
next questions when he hasn't finished answering the last one.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the most common criticism has focused on Kalam's rather
unpresidential look: his scientist's pen in the shirt pocket, his
preference for sandals over shoes, and his haircut, a silver-gray
Prince Valiant with parted bangs.</TE>
<TE>   A front-page "Special Report" in the Indian Express newspaper
interviewed Kalam's New Delhi hairstylist, Ahmed Habib, who said the
scientist's cut "suits his face and complements the texture of his
hair."</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper devoted its lifestyles page to a presidential
"make-over," which transformed Kalam into a chiseled, windblown bad
boy, complete with Nehru jacket. The spread included an interview
with an old friend of Kalam, Amar Singh, who said he had broached the
hair issue, unsuccessfully.</TE>
<TE>   "When Dr. Kalam landed in Delhi to file his nomination papers, I
told him, 'I have been getting calls from friends asking me to cajole
you into changing your hairstyle,' " Singh told the Express.</TE>
<TE>   "But he firmly refuses to change anything about his dressing,"
Singh added.</TE>

<HD>Brazil Gets 'Biggest Happiness'</HD>
<DH>Reaction: The people whose identity is perhaps most bound
up with soccer exult in the penta, their team's fifth time as World
Cup champions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RIO DE JANEIRO</DL>
<LD>They danced and they sang, they prayed and shouted obscenities at
their television screens here and across Brazil, where soccer is
something between a sport and a religion.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, after 67 agonizing minutes, their team scored a goal. And
then another. When the final whistle blew, everything was as it
should be: Brazilians were lifting the World Cup trophy.</LD>
<LD>   "Brazil had to win, it couldn't be any other way," said Luiz
Carlos Cavalcante, a nightclub singer who joined about 2,000 people
celebrating on the sands of Rio's Copacabana beach. "This is the
biggest happiness in the world for us."</LD>
<TE>   After the victory, people jammed town squares and streets in every
corner of this country to celebrate. About 50,000 Brazilians cheered
shoulder to shoulder across the wide expanse of Avenida Paulista in
Sao Paulo, South America's largest city. And more than 100,000 people
converged on Ramos Plaza in the center of Belem, at the mouth of the
Amazon River.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps nowhere on Earth is a nation's identity as linked to a
sport as Brazil's is to soccer. So it came as little surprise that
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso praised the victory Sunday as
proof of the strength of the Brazilian character. And proof, too,
that Brazil has the right stuff to reverse its declining economy.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole world saw the courage of the Brazilian people. They saw
we are capable of organizing ourselves and winning," said Cardoso,
who watched the game in Brasilia, the nation's capital. "And they
will see the same thing in the economy. We can organize our home
affairs and triumph there as well."</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, Brazil's national currency, the real, has dipped
in value, and financial markets have suffered precipitous declines.
Before the World Cup competition started in late May, the prevailing
pessimism made people here doubt that their team could come out on
top.</TE>
<TE>   Then the squad attained a string of victories and made the final.
Brazilians dared to dream of winning the penta, or fifth World Cup
championship. Ronaldo, the team's star striker, had become a symbol
of national renewal and hope, returning to lead the team after being
sidelined for the better part of two years with knee injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Even the usually staid Rio newspaper Jornal do Brasil got caught
up in the excitement. A front-page banner headline proclaimed Sunday
"The Most Awaited Day of the Century."</TE>
<TE>   Most Brazilians expected their team to beat the Germans. But many
also harbored fears of a terrible defeat, like the one Brazil
suffered in the World Cup final in 1998, when Ronaldo contracted a
mysterious illness the day of the game. That loss helped prompt a
slew of conspiracy theories and congressional hearings on the decline
of Brazilian soccer.</TE>
<TE>   "All of us know that, for Brazil, to finish second is to finish
last," said the team's coach, Luiz Felipe "Big Phil" Scolari.</TE>
<TE>   In the hours before the game kicked off, legions of Brazilian
reporters and analysts picked apart every detail of the team's
preparations, including Ronaldo's strange crescent-moon haircut.</TE>
<TE>   "All 174 million Brazilians are anxious. There is a tremendous
sense of expectation," said Mario Zagallo, who won four World Cups as
a player and coach. Zagallo said he had little doubt Brazil would
triumph this time too. "The technique, the determination and the art
of Brazil" would win out, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Most here shared that hope.</TE>
<TE>   "Soccer is a language that you speak in Brazilian," said Alberto
Massad, a 31-year-old fireman who joined the crowd watching the game
on a big-screen television on Copacabana beach.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd had begun forming before dawn on what would soon become
a sultry June day. A group of drummers tapped out a samba beat as the
game kicked off at 8 a.m. But the mood turned tense and quiet as the
minutes ticked off without a Brazilian goal.</TE>
<TE>   At halftime, one group of women sat on the curb, clasping hands,
weeping and praying, while others worked off the tension by dancing
with a shuffle on the sand-covered sidewalk that runs along the
beach.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't even watch. It's too stressful," said Eugenia Abrahao, a
Portuguese teacher.</TE>
<TE>   After Brazil scored and the clock ticked down to victory, the
tension gave way to songs and chants.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many people in this country who can't buy food, who
can't buy a shirt," said Ediluna Gomes, a hairstylist. "This is their
reward," she said, looking up at the screen, where the Brazilian team
was taking a victory lap.</TE>
<TE>   The celebrations lasted well into the night throughout Brazil,
sounding a note of unity in an ethnically diverse and often
conflicted country.</TE>
<TE>   In the Coroa Vermelha reserve in the northeastern state of Bahia,
native Pataxo Indians swapped their usual red tribal paint for the
green and yellow of the Brazilian flag.</TE>
<TE>   "We are descendants of the Indians, of the first Brazilians who
were found here," Capim Bara, a Pataxo tribesman, told the Reuters
news service. "Our country has fought, and now we won."</TE>
<TE>   Expatriate Brazilians in Portugal and Italy also took to the
streets. But in Bolivia, the celebrations were muted. At least three
dozen Brazilians were arrested in the Bolivian city of Cochabamba.
They had forgotten it was election day in that country, and all
public demonstrations were prohibited by law.</TE>

<HD>Last Straw for Small Investors?</HD>
<DH>Stocks: Analysts fear corporate scandals could drive out
those hanging on through bear market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO and KELLY YAMANOUCHI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The stock market peaked 27 months ago, and with every new decline
since then the same question has been asked about individual
investors: How much can they lose before they can stand to lose no
more?</LD>
<LD>   For some Americans whose trillions of dollars in savings helped
drive the great 1990s bull market, the threshold of pain may finally
have been crossed.</LD>
<LD>   Bob Friend, a Redondo Beach aerospace engineer who has invested in
stocks for 20 years, says he plans to move more of his investments
into interest-bearing bonds, or perhaps gold, in the next month.</LD>
<TE>   Stung by his portfolio losses and disheartened by mounting
revelations of corporate fraud--the latest WorldCom Inc.'s bombshell
last week of $3.9 billion in accounting irregularities--Friend says
his faith in the market has waned.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a complete lack of trust in corporate leadership," he
said. "I think the lack of ethical behavior has destroyed investor
confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Comments like those are sending a chill through Wall Street.
Individual investors were a big source of fuel for the stock market's
unprecedented gains in the 1990s, a decade in which the total value
of the 5,000 largest U.S. stocks soared from $3.4 trillion to $14
trillion--a wealth boom that, in turn, helped power the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps more important, the public's willingness to largely stay
in the market through the devastating decline of the last two years
may have kept stocks' losses from becoming far worse.</TE>
<TE>   Now, some analysts fear that many small investors are on the verge
of giving up on the market.</TE>
<TE>   "The new concern is that we have lost a generation of individual
investors, much the way we did after the Great Crash" of 1929, said
Edward Yardeni, market strategist at brokerage Prudential Financial
in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Souring on Stocks</TE>
<TE>   Investors also soured on stocks en masse in the 1970s, after the
market plunge of 1973-74. Measured from 1972 to 1981, the net gain in
the blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index was a minuscule 3.8% as
investors stayed away.</TE>
<TE>   The worries about another lost generation of investors may yet
prove to be overblown. What's more, even if Americans have had their
fill of stocks, it isn't clear that the implications would be dire.
The economy doubtless would survive without a rising stock market.
Savings that might have been earmarked for equities would simply flow
elsewhere--into banks, for example, or the real estate market.</TE>
<TE>   The housing market, red hot this year while stocks have fallen,
already appears to be luring money that might otherwise have gone to
Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   But an equity market that stalls out, or declines further, could
make it far more difficult for U.S. companies to raise capital needed
to grow. Likewise, poor returns in the stock market would change the
financial outlook for the tens of millions of people whose retirement
nest eggs still are locked up in stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Even now, many older Americans must rethink their retirement
spending plans as share prices have tumbled. The S&amp;P 500 has dropped
35% from its record high in March 2000. That is the deepest sustained
decline in the index since it dived 48% in 1973-74 amid the Arab oil
embargo, surging inflation and President Nixon's resignation.</TE>
<TE>   An investor whose retirement portfolio has tracked the S&amp;P 500,
and who had $500,000 at the market peak in 2000, has $325,000 now.</TE>
<TE>   More exasperating for investors has been the duration of this
slide and the volatility along the way. Twice in the last 15 months,
stocks staged sharp rallies that appeared to mark the end of the bear
market. Instead, the rallies quickly gave way to renewed downturns.</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P 500 hit a three-year low on Sept. 21 in the aftermath of
the terrorist attacks. The market then rocketed in the fourth quarter
as investors bet that the U.S. military would prevail in Afghanistan
and that the economy would soon emerge from recession--both correct
bets, as it turned out.</TE>
<TE>   But as 2002 dawned, many stocks crumbled anew. And last week,
long-distance titan WorldCom's revelation that it understated
expenses by $3.9 billion over the last five quarters, effectively
hiding a sea of red ink behind phony profit statements, triggered a
wave of selling that drove the S&amp;P index briefly below its close on
Sept. 21.</TE>
<TE>   There are various ways to measure "bull" and "bear" market cycles.
But if the S&amp;P 500's dip last week below the September low means the
bear market didn't end after the terrorist attacks, it is now 27
months old. For the S&amp;P index, that would be the longest decline
since the 1940s.</TE>
<TE>   A Third Year in the Red</TE>
<TE>   The harsh financial reality for many buy-and-hold investors is
that their portfolios are deep in the red for a third straight
year--a rarity in modern market history. If the trend holds through
December, this will be the first time the market has fallen three
consecutive calendar years since 1939-41.</TE>
<TE>   Investors in the giant Fidelity Magellan stock mutual fund, for
example, lost 9.3% in 2000, 11.7% in 2001 and are down 14.6% this
year.</TE>
<TE>   The erosion of stock values has left more investors mulling Will
Rogers' famous line about investing: "I am not so much concerned with
the return on capital as I am with the return of capital."</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, Americans have pumped $203 billion into regular
savings accounts at banks and savings and loans, Federal Reserve data
show. By contrast, through May net new purchases of stock mutual
funds totaled $72 billion, according to the funds' chief trade group.</TE>
<TE>   That is a dramatic shift from years past. In 2000, stock mutual
funds attracted $310 billion in new money while savings accounts took
in $142 billion.</TE>
<TE>   At Charles Schwab Corp., the nation's largest discount brokerage,
customer trading volumes have dropped more than 25% in two years as
interest in the market has ebbed.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Carichner, a 27-year-old Web site developer in Los Angeles,
says he is keeping all of his savings in a money market account, even
though interest rates on those accounts are typically less than 1.5%.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel that it's safer," Carichner said. "When I first got out of
college, the stock market seemed like an amazing place to supplement
your income and get ahead very quickly. Now I think you really need
to know what you're doing, whereas before it seemed you could just
throw anything against the wall and something was going to stick."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, by now most Americans know some of the fundamental
reasons the 1990s bull market died: The economy had peaked after a
stellar 10-year expansion; the Federal Reserve had raised interest
rates to counter what it believed were inflation threats; and,
perhaps most significant, technology stocks had begun to implode
after being driven to stratospheric price levels by rampant
speculation rooted in the popular mania over the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Just as technology shares enjoyed incredible gains in the late
1990s, they have borne the brunt of the market's losses since March
2000. The tech-dominated Nasdaq composite stock index peaked at
5,048.62 in that month. It now stands at 1,463.21, down 71% from the
peak, as once-star stocks such as those of Intel Corp., Cisco Systems
Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc. have collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   That loss rivals the near-90% decline in the Dow Jones industrial
average between 1929 and 1932.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the early 1930s, however, this bear market hasn't coincided
with an economic depression. Indeed, the 2001 recession was one of
the mildest on record, as measured by the decline in gross domestic
product. Consumer spending has remained surprisingly strong,
especially on autos and homes.</TE>
<TE>   But for many U.S. companies the recession's effect on profits was
crushing, amid high debt loads, rising foreign competition and a
downturn in spending by other businesses, particularly on tech
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   At the start of this year, worries about companies' earnings
remained the market's most vexing problem, as investors questioned
how long it would take for profits to get back on a growth track.
Earnings, after all, are what ultimately drive stock prices.</TE>
<TE>   Fear of more terrorist attacks also has weighed on investors'
confidence, since stocks represent a bet on future prosperity.</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, however, blame for the market's ongoing decline has
been laid at corporate America's door: The succession of accounting
scandals and tales of executive chicanery--from Enron Corp. to
WorldCom--have left investors angry and disgusted.</TE>
<TE>   The revelation by WorldCom, parent of the MCI long-distance
network, drilled deep into a public nerve. "It makes people lose
faith in the system," said Allan Spring, a 45-year-old computer
programmer in Irwindale.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Kahn, head of a $65-billion stock portfolio at Barclays Global
Investors in San Francisco, said investors' collective doubt about
the trustworthiness of corporate financial data "is much more serious
than [the issue of] a lot of stocks that were overvalued coming back
to fair value."</TE>
<TE>   The accounting scandals "are what could drive individual investors
out of the market," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned With Timing</TE>
<TE>   Yet instinctively, some small investors sense that bailing out of
stocks at a time of crisis is a foolish move. Spring said he is
tempted to shift his money into bonds, gold or money market accounts,
"but then this other side of me says that once I do that, [stocks]
will turn around."</TE>
<TE>   Some market experts say that while the corporate scandals may chip
further at investors' confidence, the public's turn away from stocks
had already become self-reinforcing.</TE>
<TE>   In his April 2000 book "Irrational Exuberance," Yale University
economics professor Robert Shiller described the late-1990s bull
market as a spectacular financial bubble that would inevitably be
followed by a long period of lousy returns on stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Just as investors' bullish behavior fed on itself as stocks
rocketed from 1995 to early 2000, so too their pessimism would feed
on itself once the market began to slide, Shiller wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Many investors, he said, will become far more interested in
preserving whatever capital they have left. That could become an
acute concern for the ranks of near-retirees who plan to start
tapping their savings in a few years.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview last week, Shiller said he is not optimistic about
a market rebound and that he sees no reason to change his view that
buy-and-hold investors in U.S. blue-chip stocks will earn no net
return through the end of this decade.</TE>
<TE>   That was a heretical view in 2000, but "I'm not so unique
anymore," Shiller said. "As the market goes down, all kinds of
theories that didn't seem plausible begin to look more plausible."</TE>
<TE>   The fundamental problem, he said, is that the average big-name
stock still is overvalued by historical standards.</TE>
<TE>   A common way to measure a stock's relative value is to compare the
price with the company's earnings per share, excluding one-time
charges. Based on Wall Street's average earnings expectations, the
S&amp;P 500 index is priced at about 20 times this year's estimated
earnings per share.</TE>
<TE>   But the historical average price-to-earnings ratio for blue-chip
shares is about 14, Shiller said. For the market just to be valued at
average levels, then, the S&amp;P 500 index should be 30% below its
current value.</TE>
<TE>   Yet many experts say there are good reasons for above-average
prices on stocks, and good reasons to expect investors to stay in the
market, unlike after the plunge of 1973-74.</TE>
<TE>   What's different from the late 1970s is that the U.S. economy
enjoys low inflation, high worker productivity and low capital-gains
taxes, said Jay Mueller, economist at Strong Capital Management in
Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   All of those factors benefit the stock market, he said. In
addition, stock investing is automatic for millions of investors
today, via retirement savings plans. People tend to be slow to make
changes in how they allocate those dollars, and there is no sign this
year of any wholesale selling of stocks in retirement accounts.</TE>
<TE>   But investor surveys, and anecdotal evidence, suggest more
investors are growing wary. And in a weak market, even a small number
of new sellers can tip the scales, driving prices lower.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Trust Co., which periodically surveys wealthy households
(defined as those with annual gross income of $300,000 or more, or
net worth greater than $3.75 million), in June found that 25% of 150
respondents said they have sold off some or all of their stocks since
March 2000. But the majority--52%--said they are "waiting to see what
happens."</TE>
<TE>   'I'm Not Giving Up'</TE>
<TE>   For many individual investors, the decision so far has been to
halt new purchases of stocks, while holding on to what they have.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not giving up on stocks, but I'm putting my money into more
liquid, more secure investments until I feel the storm has passed,"
said investor Alton Pabom, an auditor in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said, "I know it [the market] is coming back for sure.
The U.S. economy is very resilient. I still maintain the optimism
that it will bounce back, so I'm not selling."</TE>
<TE>   Wei Chi, manager of global diversity for oil company BP North
America, said he isn't planning to invest any additional money in the
stock market for the next three to six months. "Now, it's just wait
and see if the crisis is resolved," he said, referring to the
corporate accounting scandals. But he continues to hold on to stock
investments meant to finance his children's college education.</TE>
<TE>   Chi, 49, worries more about the scandals' effect on younger
people's view of the market as a long-term investment. "For the
younger investors, it's very discouraging. It may actually scare them
away for a long time," he said.</TE>

<HD>California Health Officials to Track New HIV Cases</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Only those who developed AIDS monitored
previously.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Public health officials in California today will begin requiring
physicians and laboratories to report new HIV cases to the state,
hoping to better track the disease as it spreads and better target
prevention and treatment dollars.</LD>
<LD>   The new policy is a departure from the practice of tracking only
cases of AIDS, which meant the state often learned of infections 10
or more years after they had occurred.</LD>
<LD>   But health advocates and experts remain deeply divided about
whether the state's new reporting system will succeed. California is
adopting a controversial tracking method--used in only nine other
states--in which HIV cases are traced by alphanumeric codes, rather
than by name, to protect patients' privacy.</LD>
<TE>   Thirty-four other states, including New York, track or soon will
track HIV cases by name. Legislators and public health officials in
those states have taken the position that identities are necessary to
more easily communicate with doctors, eliminate duplication of
records on the same individual and link HIV databases with registries
for other diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Some states also use the name system to gauge whether patients
receive timely treatment and assist physicians in notifying sexual
partners.</TE>
<TE>   California requires such name-based reporting for 80 diseases,
including AIDS, syphilis, anthrax, measles and food poisoning. Many
physicians, and some AIDS advocates, say HIV should be no different.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as we treat it [HIV] as something special and separate
and so dreaded that you can't even talk about it, then it's going to
reinforce that view," said Michael Weinstein, president of the AIDS
Healthcare Foundation in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of a names-based system also say that states already
have the names of HIV-positive patients on file if they receive care
through Medicaid or federally funded treatment programs.</TE>
<TE>   Those who prefer using codes say that HIV remains a stigmatizing
disease, and that the prospect of having names reported would be
enough to keep some patients from being tested for HIV.</TE>
<TE>   "There are ways to create a system that will minimize those fears,
if not eliminate them, while giving us the data we want anyway," said
Fred Dillon, policy director for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Perception itself has been enough to shift the debate. Both sides
acknowledge that there have been few, if any, recent breaches of
security in states that use names in reporting.</TE>
<TE>   A 1998 report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention found problems with the use of codes, also known as unique
identifiers, in Texas and Maryland. Codes were incomplete.
Authorities had difficulty following up on specific cases with
treating physicians. And states were unable to find out whether
patients belonged to known risk groups, such as gay men or
intravenous drug users.</TE>
<TE>   The accuracy of patient counts is important because, beginning in
two years, the federal government will begin distributing treatment
money on the basis of each state's number of HIV and AIDS cases. The
government's funding formula is now based solely on AIDS cases.</TE>
<TE>   A panel of the Institute of Medicine, an arm of the National
Academy of Sciences, is studying the issue of HIV reporting, trying
to determine the reliability and accuracy of different systems and to
learn whether they should be tied to federal funding for treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly is a problem if you want to give out federal funds
in a formula and the formula is based on a process that differs from
state to state," said Michael A. Stoto, a senior statistical
scientist at the Rand Corp. in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   The CDC favors names reporting, calling it the "simplest, most
reliable and feasible method currently available," but the agency has
not banned the use of codes.</TE>
<TE>   The experiences of other states may provide some indication of how
California's unique-identifier system will fare. Texas began using a
code system in 1994, but dropped it in favor of a names system in
1999.</TE>
<TE>   Texas doctors were required to inform health officials of gender,
race and date of birth for all HIV cases. In many cases, doctors left
blanks in their reports.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't really getting us solid numbers we could use," said Dr.
Sharilyn Stanley, associate commissioner for disease control and
prevention at the Texas Department of Health.</TE>
<TE>   Stanley said coded HIV reporting is an "unbearable obstacle" for
physicians because it requires them to track patients in a different
way from their normal procedure. "That costs money to the [doctor]
and he isn't going to do it, because he doesn't have the time," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities are handcuffed in other ways because of code
reporting, critics say. If a private physician is having trouble
notifying patients or their partners of HIV test results, the state
couldn't try to reach them. Early notification is critical because
infected people may not be seeking treatment and may be unwittingly
passing the virus on to others.</TE>
<TE>   Since January, Connecticut has allowed patients to choose between
reporting by name or reporting by code. More than 90% of patients
have allowed their names to be reported, said Dr. Joxel Garcia,
Connecticut's commissioner of public health.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, all cases were reported with unique identifiers.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been no major concern," Garcia said. "We don't want to
be the big brother of the patient, but we want to be the partner of
the patient. We will be here to protect them."</TE>
<TE>   In Maryland, officials are standing by their coded reporting
system. The system has improved markedly since the CDC reported on
the state's early problems in 1998, said Dr. Liza Solomon, director
of AIDS administration at the Maryland Department of Health and
Mental Hygiene.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe that you use a surveillance system to find
individuals," Solomon said. "You do it to provide information on
what's happening across a community with changes and trends."</TE>
<TE>   Maryland has used its system successfully to identify centers of
HIV transmission in northwest Baltimore, for example. As a result,
the state has reallocated HIV prevention funding to that area,
Solomon said.</TE>
<TE>   California is one of the last states to begin tracking HIV cases,
in large part because of a tug of war between supporters of public
health and defenders of civil liberties.</TE>
<TE>   As early as the 1980s, activists fought efforts to close gay
bathhouses, citing personal freedom. Even today, some civil liberties
groups oppose mandatory HIV testing for pregnant women, even though
health officials say it would enable physicians to prevent infected
mothers from transmitting the virus to their babies.</TE>
<TE>   In West Hollywood, the hub of Los Angeles County's gay population,
many people expressed relief Sunday that the state will track HIV
using codes, not names.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not so much, 'Will the state know?' as much as, 'Who else is
going to?' " said Peter Siegel, 51, an entertainment consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Even a code-reporting system may discourage people from getting
tested, said Ramiro Centeno, 33. "People are so paranoid about other
people finding out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A report released last year by the California Department of Health
Services said the number of residents living with HIV and AIDS
probably ranged from 107,837 to 124,305. The number of new cases each
year probably ranged from 6,788 to 8,988, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Under California's new reporting system, laboratories would assign
a patient a code if a test showed the presence of HIV. The code would
be based on the patient's birth date and gender and the consonants in
the patient's last name.</TE>
<TE>   The treating physician would add the last four digits of the
patient's Social Security number to the code and report it to the

<HD>Natural History Museum Picks Architect for a Radical
Renovation</HD>
<DH>Building: The New Yorker plans to demolish all post-1920s
additions to the Exposition Park complex.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Museum of Natural History of Los Angeles County has selected New
York-based architect Steven Holl to design a $200-million to
$300-million renovation and expansion that would radically alter the
existing complex in Exposition Park.</LD>
<LD>   The scope of the renovation would rival the recent plan to tear
down and rebuild the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.</LD>
<LD>   Museum officials, who are to announce Holl's selection today,
stress that this is a preliminary plan. Nonetheless, Holl's strategy
calls for the demolition of all of the post-1920s additions,
retaining the original 1913 Beaux Arts  structure and the four
1920s-era diorama halls.</LD>
<TE>   Holl, 54, who has emerged as one of the most celebrated American
architects of his generation, was selected over four other entrants:
the Swiss team of Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron; the
Boston-based Rodolfo Machado and Jorge Silvetti; Norman Foster &amp;
Partners of London; and David Chipperfield, also of London.</TE>
<TE>   The museum's officials have yet to raise any money for the
project. But at a time when the county is suffering from severe
budget constraints, they insist that the bulk of the funds will be
raised from private donations. As much as a third, however, could
come from government sources, including a possible county bond issue.</TE>
<TE>   A master plan will be publicly unveiled in fall 2003 and a
schematic design in 2004, in time for the start of a major capital
campaign. Construction is to begin in 2006, with completion in 2009.</TE>
<TE>   The existing museum, a public and private partnership, is a jumble
of mismatched additions that the board considers inadequate for the
institution's exhibition goals and storage needs.</TE>
<TE>   The original structure is part of a formal Beaux Arts scheme that
extends across the Rose Garden to the east. In 1927, the museum
completed its first major addition, a 250,000-square-foot wing. But
because of the Great Depression, museum officials were never able to
raise the money needed to complete the building's facade. In 1958,
the Jean Delacour Auditorium was added, and the North Wing addition,
whose Brutalist concrete facade overlooks USC, was completed in 1974.</TE>
<TE>   Holl's plan would restore the original 1913 domed Beaux Arts
structure, as well as the existing diorama halls. The unfinished
exterior of the 1920s addition would be stripped away, and the new
building would slip over the halls like a sleeve, extending to the
west and forming an L-shape that would flank two sides of the
existing south lawn. Parking would be relocated underground, tucked
underneath this new wing.</TE>
<TE>   This configuration would allow Holl to anchor the museum in a
series of landscaped parks, each with its own identity. The Rose
Garden would retain its formal relationship with the original museum.
The south lawn would become a bus drop-off for school groups, as well
as the museum's main entry, and would overlook a broad reflecting
pool. To the north, the removal of the 1970s addition and a nearby
parking lot would make room for a large "science garden" overlooking
the USC campus. Holl envisions this park as an extension of the
museum's exhibition space that could be used for shows on sustainable
housing, garden exhibitions and the like.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed addition, which would house the majority of the
museum's collections, rests within these three garden areas, its form
pierced by a series of big, amoeba-shaped courtyards. A three-story
lobby would cut through the center of the structure, linking the
south lawn to the science garden. A narrow, sliver-like tower, which
would house museum offices, would rise out of the structure's roof to
the east.</TE>
<TE>   These forms have an environmental function. The courtyards, for
example, are conceived as gigantic valves that would serve to pump
air in and out of the building. A chimney stack set inside the tower
would suck hot air out of the underground parking structure.</TE>
<TE>   But the design also is part of a larger idea about how best to
reorganize the museum's collections. The museum is now organized as a
series of independent collections, which Holl likens to the structure
of a tree with a number of independent branches. In its place, Holl
suggests a "rhizomatic" plan, in which the various departments are
connected via nonlinear paths, so the collection could be experienced
in a variety of ways. In this diagram, the courtyards would act as
social gathering places, with enormous ramps spiraling up to the
museum's upper floors.</TE>
<TE>   A benefit of the scheme, which has not been released to the public
due to its preliminary nature, is that it can be phased in over time
without shutting down the museum. The addition could be completed
first and then opened for exhibits as demolition and renovation
proceed on the existing buildings.</TE>
<TE>   The selection of Holl is part of a broader effort to return the
traditional Beaux Arts  park to its former splendor and make it a
showplace for contemporary design. The first step in this
transformation occurred in 1983 with the completion of Frank Gehry's
aerospace museum, a building whose compact, fragmented forms were
decorated with a jet mounted on its facade and a giant ball balanced
on its roof. The nearby California Science Center, designed by Zimmer
Gunsul Frasca and completed in 1998, was a lesser work but still
contemporary in spirit.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, construction has begun on a project that will
transform the existing armory building into a Science Center school
and research facility designed by Thom Mayne of the Los Angeles-based
Morphosis. Plans are underway for other enhancements, such as a
$30-million community recreation center and a 2,100-space parking
structure.</TE>
<TE>   Holl rose to prominence in the early 1980s, with the construction
of a series of small but innovative houses on the East Coast. The
best of these were marked by a haunting, poetic quality. A 1981
housing proposal for New York City, never built, set a row of small
apartment towers along an abandoned section of the elevated train
tracks. Linked by a narrow, internal garden, the buildings seemed to
float just above the downtown skyline. In a later design for a house
in Martha's Vineyard, the architect created an exterior framework of
stud walls and rails that evoked the skeleton of a beached whale.</TE>
<TE>   Among Holl's most admired projects is a 1991 housing project in
Fukuoka, Japan, built at a time when most architects had given up on
the idea of designing large-scale housing projects. Large,
cube-shaped openings--which served as entries to the apartments--were
carved out of the structure's simple concrete form. In back, a series
of reflecting pools was set between the building's finger-like forms,
reflecting light up into the interior.</TE>
<TE>   Holl's first major museum project was the 1998 Kiasma Museum of
Contemporary Art in Helsinki, Finland. The museum was conceived as
two interlocking bars, the form of one seeming to wrap over the
other, enclosing a soaring interior atrium. More recent projects
include a major addition to the Nelson Atkins Museum in Kansas City,
Mo., whose boxy glass forms evoke shards of glass scattered across a
lush green landscape, and an undergraduate residence hall at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, which Holl refers
to as a "sponge building" because of the large, amoeba-shaped rooms
carved out of its hulking, concrete interior.</TE>
<TE>   If there is a weakness in Holl's work, it is a tendency to clutter
up his buildings' bold forms with unnecessary gestures. In the 1996
Makuhari housing project in Chiba, Japan, a series of small bug-like
apartments is embedded into the roof of the housing block's concrete
shell, a bizarre gesture that adds nothing to the success of the
design. A losing competition design for LACMA included a rooftop
sculpture garden scattered with a series of strange, rock-shaped
light wells that together resembled a moonscape.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Holl's selection for the Natural History Museum adds
him to an increasingly long list of celebrated architects who,
collectively, are rebuilding the city's civic landscape. Such
projects now include the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels,
designed by Spanish architect Jose Rafael Moneo and scheduled to open
in September; Gehry's Walt Disney Concert Hall, opening in 2003; and
a new LACMA, designed by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas and scheduled
for completion in 2008.</TE>

<HD>Fire Poles Slide Into Disuse</HD>
<DH>Safety concerns and a proliferation of one-story stations
are helping to push the polished-brass fixtures into obsolescence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ZANTO PEABODY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The brass fire pole, that abiding image of firehouse tradition, may
be going the way of the Dalmatian.</LD>
<LD>   No one knows how many of the poles in the nation's 49,200 stations
stand idle or have been removed, but clearly their use is on the
downward slide.</LD>
<LD>   A few poles have even been replaced with slides. Many poles being
installed in new fire stations are mostly decorative.</LD>
<TE>   "The pole has become something of an anachronism," said Carroll
Wills, spokesman for the California Professional Firefighters. "If
you've got a midnight call and ... you're still groggy--trying to get
adrenaline flowing--a jump on a sheer drop of 30 feet might not make
that much sense."</TE>
<TE>   Others say modern safety measures defeat the notion of sliding for
speed. The holes surrounding the poles at a Santa Monica station, for
example, will be sealed with doors, a now customary safety
precaution.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Wills said, "It's a fire station and, by gosh, a station
should have a fire pole."</TE>
<TE>   The image has endured so strongly that firefighters giving station
tours almost always ride the awe-inspiring brass pole.</TE>
<TE>   When asked recently, all the students in a third-grade class at
Roosevelt Elementary in Santa Monica said that they believe polished
brass is the route of choice among the nation's bravest. And one of
the coolest parts of the job.</TE>
<TE>   But when kids are out of earshot, firefighters will say they
usually spend more time polishing the brass poles than riding them.</TE>
<TE>   Kelley Needham, an architect who specializes in firehouse design
at WLC Architects in Rancho Cucamonga, said most of the poles in his
latest designs are firehouse chic requested by city administrators,
not firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm putting two in Santa Monica, although they weren't used in
the station we tore down," Needham said. "Some cities are asking for
three or more poles in a single station."</TE>
<TE>   Fire poles date back to the late 19th century, when firefighters'
living quarters were built above garages in urban stations where land
was scarce. In the firefighting game of seconds, it was quicker to
grab the pole than to stagger down a staircase.</TE>
<TE>   Poles were first made of wood and, later, of brass. At least one
turn-of-the-century brass pole is still used in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   One State Outlaws Poles</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the cool and daring concept of poles has crashed into
the reality of fragile ankles and burning hands. Pole sliding isn't
even in some fire academies' curricula.</TE>
<TE>   "No one tells you the brass pole heats up your hands," said a
Clemson University architecture professor, Don Collins, who is also a
captain in the university's fire department. "New guys have a
tendency to let go and fall. I know of one firefighter who was so
eager to slide on the pole and broke his leg the first day on the
job."</TE>
<TE>   (For the record, you're supposed to control your speed with your
legs, not your hands.)</TE>
<TE>   The state of Washington in 1997 outlawed poles altogether for new
stations.</TE>
<TE>   Louis Flores, who specializes in fire station safety for the
state's Department of Labor and Industries, said Washington also
requires rubber landing pads in old firehouses with poles.</TE>
<TE>   "There are inherent hazards in sliding down a pole--like the
landing can cause compression and shock on the back," Flores said.</TE>
<TE>   Collins is scheduled to lecture on the shortcomings of
single-story firehouse design during a September symposium sponsored
by the Fire Industry Equipment Research Organization.</TE>
<TE>   Collins and a group of East Coast fire chiefs got the idea to meet
from a bunch of Southern California chiefs who met 15 years ago to
discuss the advantages of one-story stations.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing requires cities to build flat fire stations, but the
International Assn. of Fire Chiefs for two decades has recommended
them as a safer alternative to multistory stations.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the decision to move away from poles has forced
communities into one-story fire stations that are not always the best
design, either," Collins said.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a single event, like a pole sliding death, that started
it," he said. "It's more like a series of little events and
conversations that told us we are in a different era."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Fire Department has wavered on the poles.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters use them in about 40 of the 112 stations where the
living quarters are above the truck bays, 30 feet above the ground.
But in the 15 stations built since 1985, the dorms were lowered,
allowing firefighters to easily take the stairs.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with Proposition F funds, the city will return to a two-story
design with brass poles for 19 new stations and will add separate
poles for paramedics.</TE>
<TE>   "Multiple poles are an efficient way to transition from upper to
lower floors when you have as many people in a station as we do,"
said Capt. Norm Greengard of the Los Angeles Fire Department. "Plus,
it's 200 years of tradition unhampered by progress."</TE>
<TE>   Turning to Steel Slides</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Anthony, manager of the Boston-based McIntire Brass Works,
the nation's leading maker of brass poles, said the world is divided
into two types of firefighters--polers and non-polers.</TE>
<TE>   "The type of fireman who says he hates poles and will never use
them is the same type of person who'll say he will never drive a
Chevy just because it's a Chevy," Anthony said. "They say that, but
there's really nothing they can think of to beat it."</TE>
<TE>   Looking for another way to hurry downstairs, the Ontario
International Airport Fire Department installed 30-foot
stainless-steel slides into its garage, a pair of only a handful
around the country.</TE>
<TE>   They're not just fast. They're almost too fast, according to Capt.
Robert Helsom.</TE>
<TE>   "We probably [will] have a couple of injuries down the road,"
Helsom said. "Other than the novelty of the slide, it's probably just
as good to take the stairs."</TE>
<TE>   The novelty of the slide also has worn off in Birmingham, Mich.,
believed to be home of the first firehouse slide. Chief David
Edginton said the city put in slides in 1955 and five years ago
spurned poles and slides.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe liability is the case with both Dalmatians and poles,"
Edginton said.</TE>
<TE>   You might wonder what Dalmatians, spiral staircases and brass
poles have to do with firefighting anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Before the internal-combustion engine, horses tugged fire wagons.
Dalmatians, which have an affinity for horses, ran off other dogs
that might spook the horses.</TE>
<TE>   In the station, the horses sometimes tried to climb the stairs, so
firehouse designers in the 19th century responded by building spiral
staircases--too difficult for horses to go up, and not much better
for firefighters going down. Hence, the poles.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles replaced its last horse-drawn wagon in 1921.
Dalmatians have been relegated mostly to children's books.</TE>
<TE>   But "I don't think we're going to get away from poles completely,"
said Collins, the architect and firefighter. "It just makes sense in
most cities to build two stories. And whether or not people use it,
poles are going to be there."</TE>

<HD>If WorldCom Lies, 'People Will Pay,' SEC Chief Says</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Blunt warning on report due today comes amid
parties' sparring on debacle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The nation's chief stock market regulator Sunday warned that "people
will pay heavily" if there is any untruth in a report due today from
WorldCom, explaining how it inflated profits by almost $4 billion.</LD>
<LD>   As the political stakes in the WorldCom scandal rise, Securities
and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt seemed to build on
comments by President Bush--who in his Saturday radio address vowed
that "the federal government will be vigilant in prosecuting
wrongdoers" to ensure public confidence in American business.</LD>
<LD>   "We're demanding that they make a statement under oath, telling
the American public exactly what went on there and what their true
financial condition is," said Pitt, a Bush appointee, speaking on
ABC's "This Week." "If there's even an iota of false statement in
there, people will pay heavily."</LD>
<TE>   The blunt warning came as last week's news about WorldCom--the
latest in a series of corporate scandals--sparked Democratic
accusations that Republicans oppose effective oversight of business
and that Pitt himself is part of the problem. The White House,
meanwhile, repeatedly in the last few days has urged corporations to
report their finances honestly and openly.</TE>
<TE>   Uncertainties about the economy are adding to the political
anxiety, with a recent national survey pointing to slipping public
confidence in the president's handling of the economy.</TE>
<TE>   The June poll by the Pew Research Center for the People and the
Press found that approval for Bush's handling of the economy fell to
53% in June from 60% in January. Just one third of voters said the
president was doing all he can to jump-start the economy--down from
48% in January.</TE>
<TE>   "The upcoming congressional election may be as much a referendum
on domestic concerns as on the war on terrorism, as the public's
economic anxiety increases and its frustration with Washington
mounts," the pollsters concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the two political parties are scrambling to put
together new legislation to safeguard investors and ensure the
integrity of financial reports.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican-controlled House already has passed bills that are
supposed to enhance the security of pensions, as well as to
strengthen accounting standards and disclosure requirements so that
firms are not able to misrepresent their financial standing.</TE>
<TE>   In the Senate, a Democratic bill to strengthen oversight of
accountants is expected to reach the floor sometime after the July 4
recess. But disputes remain over important details of such
legislation.</TE>
<TE>   The partisanship stepped up a notch Saturday when former Vice
President Al Gore ripped into Bush's economic policies and denounced
the administration's choice of Pitt to serve as watchdog of the
nation's financial markets. Pitt is an attorney who formerly
represented investment banks and is seen as friendly to the Wall
Street establishment.</TE>
<TE>   "They picked a fox to head that chicken coop," Gore said in a
campaign-style speech. "They picked the principal lawyer and lobbyist
for the Big Five accounting firms who, before coming to the
government, went and pleaded with the SEC to open up the loopholes
for the accounting companies."</TE>
<TE>   But as they seek to lump the Republicans together with business
scandal, the Democrats might have their own problems on the issue of
corporate governance.</TE>
<TE>   A new report by the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks
campaign contributions, found that WorldCom has doled out its
donations with an even hand, particularly over the last year.
Democratic hopes of tethering the GOP to WorldCom's woes might not
prove convincing, the researchers concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after news of the WorldCom scandal broke, the National
Republican Congressional Committee issued advice to Republican
office-seekers on how to handle the corporate accountability issue.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, it reminded candidates that 178 Democrats had
voted to deregulate the telecommunications industry in 1996.
Democratic efforts to politicize the WorldCom debacle are "extremely
hypocritical," according to the candidate alert.</TE>
<TE>   Some also contend that recent scandals may reflect an approach to
business that predates the current Bush administration. The boom
years of the Clinton era fostered an "anything goes" climate that
critics say was reflected in lax oversight.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything that I'm hearing are things that I inherited when I
got the job," Pitt said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   How the brouhaha ultimately plays out may depend more on whether
it deals a long-lasting wound to the economy than on the intricacies
of legislation on corporate accountability or the war of words in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, a bad economy and a bad stock market is bad for the
party in power," said William Kristol, editor of the conservative
Weekly Standard. But he maintained that unless such damage is severe,
Democrats could find it difficult to translate the misdeeds of
financial executives into a major issue that would make a big
difference in a local campaign.</TE>

the state toy.</LD>

President Theodore Roosevelt in the Mississippi Delta.</LD>
<TE>   After three days without success, the president was offered a
captive bear to kill, and he refused.</TE>
<TE>   A political cartoonist depicted Roosevelt's humane act, and toy
bears thereafter became widely known as teddy bears.</TE>
<TE>   Hillman Frazier was one of two state senators opposing the bill,
calling it a frivolous distraction at a time lawmakers should be
working harder to support Medicaid and education.</TE>

Frazier said.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DEADWOOD, S.D.</DL>
<LD>DEADWOOD, S.D. -- Firefighters battled a wildfire Sunday that had
burned to the ridge above this Black Hills gambling town and forced
thousands of residents and tourists to evacuate.</LD>
<LD>   The 4,500-acre blaze was about 35% contained early Sunday, and
officials praised a relatively small crew of about 200 firefighters
for saving the historic gold mining town.</LD>
<LD>   "When I first drove in here, I thought we were going to lose a lot
of Deadwood, and it's because of you, we didn't," fire coordinator
Joe Lowe said to a group of firefighters Sunday morning.</LD>
<TE>   Wind drove the fire back toward town Sunday afternoon, but its
path toward homes was blocked by land that had already burned, Lowe
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're catching it as it approaches the back of the houses," Lowe
said.</TE>
<TE>   A bulldozer line from the south end of town to its northeast end
was nearly complete, but whether it would hold the fire was
uncertain, Lowe said.</TE>
<TE>   The fire burned two homes and six other buildings, and forced
1,380 residents and countless tourists to flee.</TE>

<HD>Arizona Firefighter Held in Setting Blaze</HD>
<DH>Crime: Authorities say the contract employee wanted to make
sure he had work this summer. More than 450,000 acres have burned so
far.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CIBECUE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Driven by the hope of good summertime work, a contract firefighter
started what would turn into the worst wildfire in Arizona history,
authorities alleged Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Leonard Gregg, 29, a part-time firefighter for the Bureau of
Indian Affairs, was one of the first summoned to combat the blaze.</LD>
<LD>   "This fire was started with a profit motive behind it," U.S. Atty.
Paul Charlton said.</LD>
<TE>   Gregg was arrested Saturday night and appeared in federal court
Sunday morning in Flagstaff, Ariz., looking tired and bewildered.</TE>
<TE>   At one point during the brief hearing, he said: "I'm sorry for
what I did."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Magistrate Stephen Verkamp swiftly interrupted, telling Gregg
that this was not the time to admit guilt.</TE>
<TE>   Gregg is accused of starting two fires June 18, one of which was
quickly snuffed out. The other rushed up the steep mountains north of
here, driven by high winds and feeding on bone-dry scrub brush and
ponderosa pines.</TE>
<TE>   The so-called Rodeo blaze spread north, causing the evacuation of
tens of thousands of people in the towns of Show Low, Pinedale,
Linden and other communities.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the fire allegedly started by Gregg merged with
another, the Chediski fire, which authorities believe was started by
a lost hiker as she signaled a helicopter. By Sunday, the fire had
consumed more than 452,000 acres and about 440 homes.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of Show Low, Pinedale and parts of Linden began
returning Saturday just hours before Gregg was arrested. Show Low was
largely untouched, but parts of Pinedale and Linden were all but
burned to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Paxon--a U.S. Forest Service spokesman whose calm, folksy
manner has soothed thousands of anxious evacuees--called word of the
arrest "gut-wrenching."</TE>
<TE>   "It causes a lot of angst and heartburn and questioning," Paxon
said. "Too bad for everyone.... There is going to be some watershed
damage that will last 100 years, not just a year or two."</TE>
<TE>   Gregg--a native of the Fort Apache Indian Reservation, where the
fire started--said he put matches to dry grass to start the blaze,
according to a complaint filed in federal court. The document also
alleged that before anyone had reported the fire, Gregg told a woman
that he had to rush home because there was going to be a fire call.</TE>
<TE>   Held in the Coconino County Jail in Flagstaff, Gregg faces 10
years in prison, a $500,000 fine, and the possibility of having to
pay restitution. He never expected the blaze to grow so large,
according to the complaint, and "just wanted to work on a fire crew."</TE>
<TE>   Because more firefighters are needed during the warm summer and
fall months, federal and state agencies frequently contract some of
the work to private companies. In Arizona, contract firefighters such
as Gregg must pass a safety and training course, earning what's
called a "red card," to be allowed on the fire line.</TE>
<TE>   Gregg is the second government employee to be charged with
intentionally setting a forest fire this season.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the U.S. Forest Service fired Terry Barton, who was
charged in Colorado with sparking the Hayman fire, which has burned
137,000 acres and 133 homes since June 8. Fire officials in Colorado
announced Sunday that the fire was finally contained.</TE>
<TE>   Although Show Low, Heber-Overgaard--which lost more than 200
homes--and other towns have received most of the media attention
since the massive Arizona wildfire started, more than 60% of the
burned acreage lies on reservation land. And the reservation was
desperately impoverished before the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   More than half of White Mountain Apache tribal households fall
below the poverty line. Unemployment on the reservation stands at
60%.</TE>
<TE>   The fire has ravaged the tribe's small but lucrative timber
industry, closed its casino for two weeks now and probably killed
thousands of elk. A tag to shoot a bull elk on the reservation costs
$20,000.</TE>
<TE>   Some here were devastated to learn that a Native American
firefighter had been charged with intentionally setting the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the last thing we needed," a woman named Mary, who asked
that her last name not be used, said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas Massey, chairman of the tribe, said: "It doesn't matter if
he's a tribal member or nonmember. We found who he was" and arrested
him.</TE>
<TE>   More than 4,500 firefighters continued to battle the blaze Sunday,
mostly on its west and south flanks.</TE>
<TE>   They benefited from slightly lower temperatures and milder winds,
and continued to fortify the fire line around the Forest Lakes
neighborhood near the town of Payson.</TE>
<TE>   Two days ago, 600 homes were threatened there as the fire began
roaring up nearby canyons. But after a series of successful nighttime
back-burns and then Sunday's favorable weather, officials were
optimistic that the community would hold.</TE>
<TE>   On the northwest perimeter of the fire, residents of
Heber-Overgaard continued to be kept from their houses Sunday. Along
with residents of Linden and other communities, about 4,000 people
still haven't been allowed to return home.</TE>
<TE>   More than 25,000 others, however, began trekking back to their
towns Saturday. And Sunday, fire officials expressed cautious
optimism that the devastating and fast-moving inferno might finally
be slowing to a halt.</TE>

<HD>Questions of Sincerity Over Bush's Vision for the Mideast</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The debate about President Bush's speech last week on the Middle East
boils down to a dispute over his sincerity. At home and abroad, his
supporters argue that his call for fundamental political and social
reform offers Palestinians a defined path not only to statehood but
more prosperous, stable and orderly lives. His critics believe Bush
has established a set of conditions he knows the Palestinians can't
meet as a pretext to indefinitely freeze negotiations toward
independence. From that angle, the real goal isn't reform, but delay.</LD>
<LD>   Adding to the suspicion is Bush's long-standing skepticism of
nation-building. Bush's plan for the Palestinians will require an
international reconstruction effort as ambitious as the Clinton
administration interventions in Bosnia, Kosovo or Haiti that most
conservatives, and Bush himself in the 2000 campaign, disdained.
Candidate Bush portrayed Clinton's forays into nation-building as a
luxury that distracted from the real work of defending American
interests abroad. It's a bit jarring to hear Bush now say that the
best way to advance the American interest in a peaceful Middle East
is to build a new Palestinian state.</LD>
<TE>   Bush advisors note that his criticism as a candidate focused on
the use of American military forces to provide security for
nation-building, an idea not yet on the table in the Middle East. But
Clintonites, like Eric Schwartz, a former senior White House advisor
for peacekeeping, charge that the Bush team has neglected the civil
side of nation-building, weakening the American capacity to help
other nations build government institutions. "They are not as well
organized, and not as well equipped and not as inclined to manage
these sorts of issues," charges Schwartz, now a fellow at the U.S.
Institute of Peace, an organization that provides financial support
to nonprofit groups to promote the peaceful resolution of
international conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   The only way for Bush to quell these doubts is to produce a
vigorous plan to implement the sweeping changes that he proposed in
his speech. No one disputes the need. Every study of the Palestinian
Authority has portrayed an administrative and legal chaos. Overlap,
confusion and corruption in the delivery of basic services are
widespread; clear lines of authority are rare. Hillary Rodham
Clinton's health-care plan looks simple by comparison.</TE>
<TE>   The result, which may be the point, is an absence of effective
legislative or judicial checks on the authority of the executive
branch headed by Yasser Arafat. Only in May, with international
pressure growing, did Arafat finally sign the Basic Law (in effect,
the Palestinian constitution) the Legislature approved in 1997 to
demarcate, at least on paper, the separation of powers between the
three branches of government. But since Arafat at times has simply
refused to enforce court decisions he opposes, and has consistently
blocked the Legislature's efforts to exercise its ostensible
oversight and budgetary authority, it's not clear how much that paper
is worth.</TE>
<TE>   To his credit, Bush last week addressed all of these problems. He
pledged American and international assistance to help the
Palestinians write a new constitution, establish a truly independent
judiciary, strengthen the Legislature, consolidate and restructure
its security forces, reform its finances and hold fair elections.</TE>
<TE>   In other cases that required such a fundamental civic overhaul,
such as Kosovo or East Timor, the U.N. has temporarily run the
country as a trusteeship while trying to strengthen the local
capacity and expertise, notes Schwartz. Though probably the best
answer, that's not politically feasible for the Palestinians, who
aren't going to surrender the limited sovereignty they already
exercise. Which means that any progress toward the goals Bush
established will demand strenuous intervention, led by the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   The problem won't be devising plans to create better Palestinian
institutions; it will be creating a political environment that makes
those plans viable. Already there is no shortage of ideas. CIA
Director George J. Tenet has been meeting with Palestinian officials
to consolidate their security forces; World Bank President James D.
Wolfensohn recently presented National Security Advisor Condoleezza
Rice with proposals for cleaning up a Palestinian governmental
finance system that might make even Arthur Andersen blush. And the
White House recognizes the U.S. will have to pony up more dollars to
implement Bush's vision.</TE>
<TE>   More Palestinian terrorism, though, would quickly test Bush's
commitment. If he continues aid after more attacks, he'll face
charges of rewarding violence; if he curtails it, he'll risk
derailing the reform process he's presented as the long-term solution
to violence. For now, Bush officials say the administration would
stay the course so long as a reforming Palestinian government makes a
good-faith effort to stop the terrorists. But that's much easier said
before the bodies are bleeding on CNN.</TE>
<TE>   The political challenges in Palestinian society are equally
complex. While polls show a hunger for reform, the external pressure
may make Palestinians rally around Arafat--raising the issue of
whether a reform effort could coexist with a democratically reelected
Arafat. It's also unclear how any of these structural changes, much
less fair elections, can occur while the Israelis have reoccupied
Palestinian territories so comprehensively. Tanks aren't the best
backdrop for campaign rallies.</TE>
<TE>   And even if reduced violence eventually allows Israel to pull back
(as Bush urged), the more fundamental question is whether any
moderate Palestinian alternative can emerge without concurrent
progress toward independence and peace. "The conditions that bring
moderates and reformers to the fore are conditions where those
people's vision [of peace] have credibility to the Palestinian
people," says Amy Hawthorne, an expert on Arab governance at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.</TE>
<TE>   The essential contribution of Bush's speech was to declare
Palestinian reform a precondition for negotiation and independence.
He's right to conclude that negotiations without reform are a
dead-end. But he may find it just as difficult to advance reform
without negotiations.</TE>

<DH>Terrorism: Post-9/11, 'people here feel more and more under
siege,' one person says of task force tactics in raid on underground
services.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAGGIE FARLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>On the corner of Atlantic and Court streets in Brooklyn, in the time
it takes to savor a tall latte at the Starbucks a block away, you
could send cash across the world, buy a black market visa to Yemen or
create a whole new identity.</LD>
<LD>   To New York's joint terrorism task force, it was the perfect setup
for would-be terrorists, the kind of underground network that once
may have supported America's attackers as they prepared their fatal
mission of Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   To the hard-working Middle Eastern population here, these services
are simply the dark edge of the necessities of immigrant life,
sometimes abused but mostly ignored as they try to carry on under a
lingering shadow of suspicion.</LD>
<TE>   Days like last Wednesday are designed to make the rest of the
nation feel safer. Starting at 6 a.m., armed, body armor-clad
officers of the FBI, Customs Service and the Immigration and
Naturalization Service swarmed the neighborhood, knocked down doors
and arrested 19 people, mostly of Yemeni extraction. Sixteen were
accused of money laundering, one was charged with fraud and two with
forging identity documents.</TE>
<TE>   The headlines the next day said that authorities had gotten their
men. But to this diverse community--not just to the couple whose door
was broken down by mistake at dawn, or the old man who said he had a
machine gun pointed at his head or the women whose husbands
disappeared into detention months ago--the sense of security that
much of America is seeking seems increasingly elusive.</TE>
<TE>   "It's odd," said Emira Habiby Browne, executive director of the
Arab-American Family Support Center in Brooklyn. "While the rest of
the country seems to slowly forget the impact of Sept. 11, people
here feel more and more under siege."</TE>
<TE>   The neighborhood of Cobble Hill, three blocks from Brooklyn's
state and federal courthouses, seems an unlikely spot for a terrorist
base. The bustling main road, Court Street, is lined with sycamores
and flanked by blocks of swanky brownstones. On a single block,
diners can choose from Tex-Mex, Indian, Middle Eastern and Chinese
restaurants, or a meat-and-potatoes joint. And sprinkled betwixt the
new shops are small storefronts and kiosks offering help to people
who speak better Arabic than English--help to send money to their
home countries, to fill out immigration and tax forms and to bring
their families here.</TE>
<TE>   Among the recent arrivals in the neighborhood were Arabic-speaking
FBI agents, who hung around for six months, trying to win people's
trust and observe how business is done. They benefited from an Arabic
custom, residents say: hospitality to newcomers. "We all remember
being new immigrants here, how hard it is," said Hassan Al-Faqieh, a
restaurateur. The agents were welcomed and absorbed into the
community.</TE>
<TE>   Their attention ultimately focused on two service centers. One,
the Old Glory Cosmopolitan Translation and Service Bureau, operated
from a kiosk inside a 6-by-12-foot supply closet in a popular Yemeni
restaurant. The restaurant owner said Saturday that he had allowed a
countryman to use the space two months ago, in hopes that the service
would bring in more customers. "Not," he said, "the FBI."</TE>
<TE>   The other service center, Saba Travel, is a small office at the
top of a dark stairway, behind a brown door now marred with the dents
of FBI battering rams. The owner, Abdorabah M. Gaisi, hadn't sold
airline tickets in years but specialized in immigration applications,
neighboring travel agents said.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI agents suspected more. Earlier last month, on different
occasions, an FBI agent wired with a recording device bought a Yemeni
divorce decree and birth certificates stamped with Yemeni government
seals from each place. He wasn't asked for any identification, and
the kiosk proprietor, Ali Hamdi, simply made up the fictional
mother's name, according to the agent's affidavits for arrest and
search warrants. Each document cost $70 and took less than an hour to
make.</TE>
<TE>   The agent also stated that the Saba Travel office had counterfeit
seals from federal and state agencies that could be used to make fake
U.S. documents.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a delicate time, and if you're doing something wrong, you
should pay for it," said Ismail Hassan, a real estate agent and
notary who lives next door to Saba Travel. "But I know this man. He
may have documents to facilitate immigration to America, but he is
not engaged in criminal activity to aid and abet terrorism." Hassan
waved his arm toward the sidewalk filled with shoppers and baby
strollers. "There are no terrorists in this neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI and the U.S. attorney's office say they're treating the
cases as white-collar crime involving fraud and the illegal transfer
of money, not necessarily as terrorism cases.</TE>
<TE>   But in the post-Sept. 11 world, everything is suspect. Arab
business owners say they are accustomed to occasional polite but
unscheduled drop-ins from "the feds."</TE>
<TE>   Those who look even slightly Arab have taken to carrying their
passports around, even if they're U.S. citizens, because sometimes
they are stopped and questioned. Travelers to the Middle East are
cautioned not to take along the usual gifts from the U.S.--batteries
and thermoses--because they have been mistaken by airport security
for bombs.</TE>
<TE>   And most significantly for this neighborhood, a traditional method
of remitting money without using banks--called hawala, a global
network thought to have been used by the Sept. 11 hijackers--has come
under intense scrutiny since the terrorist attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   In Cobble Hill, if someone wanted to send money to Yemen,
sometimes they would ask Saad Almontaser, 30, for help.</TE>
<TE>   A grocery store owner and vice president of the Yemeni American
Assn. in Brooklyn, everybody knows him as "the neighborhood guy."
People avoid banks because they don't know enough English to fill out
the forms, or their home villages are too far from a bank branch, he
said. Western Union charges a hefty commission on both ends.</TE>
<TE>   Almontaser would put people in touch with others who were going
back to Yemen and could carry cash or checks to families, or arrange
for someone to make a payment here to be collected in a remote Yemeni
village the next day.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday morning, FBI and customs agents broke into
Almontaser's building, broke down the wrong family's apartment door,
then finally took the grocer away in handcuffs in front of his young
children, accusing him and 15 others of illegal transmission of more
than $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Hawala is a community service," he said Saturday, receiving
greetings from friends in the Yemen Cafe after being released on
bail. "It's not a crime. I always knew where the money was coming
from and who it was going to. It didn't come from anything illegal.
It didn't go to criminals. And not to terrorists either."</TE>
<TE>   Almontaser is caught in a cultural gap, he said, and it is
especially ironic because he is constantly trying to push his
community to be more integrated in the United States. Raids,
undercover agents and wiretaps just increase the gulf in the
neighborhood, and make people question how much longer they can stay
here.</TE>
<TE>   "Sept. 11 hurt everybody, but we have been hurt three times over,"
he said. "As Americans, as part of the Muslim community and as
Yemenis."</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- The nation's largest city is eliminating glass and
plastics from its recycling program today in what recycling advocates
say is the first significant rollback of such a program in the United
States.</LD>
<LD>   "No other big cities have taken a step back like this, and I'm not
even familiar with any smaller cities taking out elements of their
recycling programs," said Laura Haight, senior environmental
associate for the New York Public Interest Research Group. "It's
unprecedented. People ... are looking very closely at this."</LD>
<LD>   Starting today, sanitation workers will collect only paper and
metal for recycling.</LD>
<TE>   Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg says the change will save the
deficit-troubled city $40 million in the coming fiscal year.</TE>

<HD>Brazil Beats Germany to Win Cup</HD>

<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YOKOHAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>YOKOHAMA, Japan -- Soccer, according to an old saying, is a game in
which 22 people run around for 90 minutes and in the end Germany
wins.</LD>
<LD>   It's time to update the saying.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday night, Brazil regained its status as the sport's
unquestioned leader, its star player achieved a measure of redemption
and a nation reeling from an economic crisis found a new hero.</LD>
<TE>   In front of a crowd of 69,029 at Yokohama International Stadium
and a worldwide television audience in the hundreds of millions,
Ronaldo scored both goals in a 2-0 victory over Germany that gave
Brazil a record fifth World Cup title. The two goals also tied
Ronaldo, the scapegoat for Brazil's loss in the World Cup finals four
years ago, with Brazilian soccer icon Pele as the country's leading
goal-scorer in the World Cup with 12.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we played a great game," Ronaldo said. "We brought joy to
millions of people, and I think it will take some time for me to see
and figure out what happened."</TE>
<TE>   Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso was more certain of
the impact of the victory. Speaking in Brasilia, the capital, he said
the national team's victory showed the "courage of the Brazilian
people" and gave the country faith that it could overcome an economic
crisis that has hit hard at Brazil's financial markets and the
national currency, the real.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil's victory sparked celebrations--most of them peaceful--in
all of the nation's major cities, where the game began at 8 a.m.
local time. In Sao Paulo, Belo Horizonte and Belem, people jammed
major avenues and town squares, chanting "Brazil, five-time
champions!"</TE>
<TE>   About 2,000 people gathered to watch the game on Copacabana beach
in Rio de Janeiro, squinting at a large-screen television whose image
was partly bleached out by the morning sun.</TE>
<TE>   "We will dance all day today, and tonight and then tomorrow too,"
said Maria Angelita de Lima, a Rio street vendor who took the day off
from her job selling tourist knickknacks to join the celebrations
with her grandson.</TE>
<TE>   The victory sparked a surge of national pride. Television stations
debuted new samba songs commemorating the team's penta, or fifth
world championship.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole world is talking about Brazil today. They are seeing
that Brazil is an important country," said Francisco Horta, a
television commentator in Rio.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone was overjoyed by Sunday's outcome.</TE>
<TE>   Among those present at the game were German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder and Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder, who had traveled to Japan from the Group of 8 summit in
Alberta, Canada, as a guest aboard Koizumi's private jet, is running
for reelection in a few months, and a German victory would have
boosted his chances.</TE>
<TE>   It also would have made German Coach Rudi Voeller only the third
person in history to win the World Cup both as a player and as a
coach, joining Brazil's Mario "Lobo" Zagalo and Germany's Franz
Beckenbauer.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Voeller will have to try again in 2006, when Germany
hosts the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Millions of fans across Germany who had come out to watch the game
on big screens took the defeat in stride, waving huge black, red and
gold flags and honking car horns to celebrate second place.</TE>
<TE>   In Berlin, fans wrapped in oversize German flags invited others
wearing Brazil's colors to join an after-game party, complete with
firecrackers, air horns and free beer.</TE>
<TE>   Again and again, the crowd sang the song that became an unofficial
German national anthem in recent weeks, a paean to the team's coach:
"One Rudi Voeller, there's only one Rudi Voeller," set to the music
of "Guantanamera."</TE>
<TE>   "Honestly, we should be happy with the result," one German fan
said. Referring to Brazilian players, the fan added: "We have neither
a Ronaldo, nor a Rivaldo, nor a Ronaldinho. But we do have a Rudi
Voeller, who has formed a team out of nobodies."</TE>
<TE>   And they had Oliver Kahn, the German goalkeeper who had allowed
only one goal in his team's previous six games. But Ronaldo put the
ball past him twice in the span of 12 second-half minutes, and the
Germans had no answer.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was just reward for Brazil, which swept through Asia's
first World Cup unbeaten in seven games and more than made up for the
disappointment of 1998, when it was defeated by France in the final
in Paris on a night when Ronaldo was completely out of sorts.</TE>
<TE>   As a 17-year-old on Brazil's 1994 World Cup team, Ronaldo had
watched the final from the bench as Brazil defeated Italy on penalty
kicks at Pasadena's Rose Bowl. This time around, the world was
watching him.</TE>
<TE>   "I assume that in Brazil there are great celebrations and that
people are overjoyed," said teammate Rivaldo, whose shot Kahn failed
to handle in the 67th minute, allowing Ronaldo to score the first
goal off the rebound.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo scored another goal in the 79th minute, and it was all
over but the shouting.</TE>
<TE>   The streets of Yokohama were crowded with fans who wanted to
experience the atmosphere of a World Cup final, especially one
involving two of the game's superpowers.</TE>
<TE>   In the 72-year history of the quadrennial tournament, Brazil and
Germany had never played each other, a remarkable statistic
considering that the Brazilians were four-time champions and the
Germans had won three times.</TE>
<TE>   And so Brazilian fans, some outrageously costumed and all
producing a cacophony of noise from horns, drums and whistles,
mingled happily with German fans on the streets around the stadium,
while market stalls did a brisk trade in hats, pins and other
souvenirs.</TE>
<TE>   Among the items being sold--for 2,000 yen (about $16)--was a
two-tone scarf made in England, with one half celebrating Brasil and
the other half Deutschland.</TE>
<TE>   Taking in the street scene, and more often than not photographing
it, were the citizens of Yokohama, who appeared alternately bemused
and amused by the goings-on.</TE>
<TE>   Some got into the spirit, however, and even the traffic police,
accustomed to more orderly behavior, put on a brave smile as the
parade of shouting, dancing and laughing fans wandered this way and
that en route to the stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Some Japanese even got into the act. One man walked a long-haired
Dachshund--a German breed--through the throng, with the dog sporting
a miniature version of the yellow No. 6 jersey worn by Brazilian
midfielder Roberto Carlos.</TE>
<TE>   The party atmosphere pervaded the game itself and, like the 63
matches that preceded it, the final was unmarred by the violence or
hooliganism that World Cup organizers had feared when South Korea and
Japan were awarded the 2002 tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Asia's first World Cup, in fact, passed almost without a hitch,
give or take a few ticketing problems and some logistical
difficulties associated with co-hosting.</TE>
<TE>   In the long run, the World Cup might lead to even closer
cooperation in the region.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an idea for greater soccer exchanges between China,
Japan and South Korea, as well as North Korea," South Korean
President Kim Dae Jung told Cabinet ministers last week. "There
should be further discussions to energize this idea."</TE>
<TE>   For the time being, Asia's fans will be happy to cheer for Ronaldo
and company.</TE>
<TE>   Soccer, according to an increasingly popular saying, is a game in
which 22 people run around for 90 minutes and in the end Brazil wins.</TE>

<HD>Suspect Captured After Chase</HD>
<DH>Police: The armed man, who is wanted on suspicion of
murder, leads officers on a wild ride to Ventura.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Firing shots at pursuing officers, a man wanted on suspicion of
murder led authorities on a wild chase that zigzagged across several
Ventura County freeways Sunday night, ending with his arrest at an
equipment yard on Ventura's west side.</LD>
<LD>   After an hourlong standoff, the suspect, who was not immediately
identified, was taken into custody by sheriff's deputies just after
9:30 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   Officers with the California Highway Patrol, the Sheriff's
Department and the Ventura Police Department took part in the chase,
which began just before 7 p.m. on California 150 in Ojai. It ended
when the suspect was blocked in by pursuing officers at a dead-end
near Seneca Street and Ventura Avenue.</LD>
<TE>   CHP officers shut down California 33 between the southbound
junction with the Ventura Freeway and the Shell Road offramp about
8:45 p.m..</TE>
<TE>   Officers rerouted traffic onto Ventura Avenue as the suspect sat
in a white Lincoln Continental smoking a cigarette and drinking what
appeared to be alcohol. Few details were available about the suspect,
who was allegedly carrying two stolen handguns, one a .357 magnum and
the other a .45.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's deputies began the chase in Ojai and continued their
pursuit south on California 33 and onto the southbound Ventura
Freeway. The suspect then turned eastbound on California 126,
attempting a series of dangerous maneuvers and firing a handgun at
pursuing officers, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   CHP officers put down spike strips at several locations on
California 126 and also in the northbound lanes of the Ventura
Freeway at the Mussel Shoals offramp. Twice, as the suspect was
heading in the direction of the spike strips, he abruptly changed
routes and headed in the opposite direction.</TE>
<TE>   Pursuing officers reported hearing shots fired from the vehicle as
it headed eastbound on California 126 near Wells Road. At one point,
the suspect drove the wrong way in a westbound stretch of California
126 between Kimball and Wells roads as motorists swerved to avoid a
head-on crash.</TE>
<TE>   Entering the Ventura Freeway, the suspect slowed to about 25 mph
as officers cleared the freeway in both directions.</TE>
<TE>   The driver then headed northbound on the Ventura Freeway, weaving
across three lanes before making a U-turn on a dirt divider at the
Padre Juan overpass just before the Mussel Shoals spike strip.</TE>
<TE>   The pursuit ended when the suspect exited California 33 at Stanley
Road and hit a dead end. Sheriff's deputies shot out the car's tires
as it sat parked next to a Quonset hut on the equipment yard
property.</TE>
<TE>   With sheriff's SWAT team officers pointing high-powered rifles at
him and helicopters hovering overhead, the suspect emerged from his
car and paced back and forth briefly before surrendering. Residents
of the neighborhood watched from their windows as the scene unfolded.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Deputy in Coma Following Fiery Accident</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: Crash in Dana Point occurs as he and another
officer are investigating a shooting. He is in guarded condition
after surgeries.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County sheriff's deputy remained in a coma Sunday after his
patrol car crashed and burst into flames during the hunt for a
drive-by shooting suspect, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Mike Gaard, 33, who received multiple fractures and
lacerations in the accident Saturday, was in a medically induced coma
at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center, where officials listed
him in guarded condition. The 12-year veteran of the department
already has undergone several operations, including reconstructive
surgery.</LD>
<LD>   Gaard's partner and passenger, Reserve Deputy Henry Gould, 41,
suffered a dislocated shoulder and a shattered knee. He was in stable
condition at Mission Hospital. Both deputies are married and have
children.</LD>
<TE>   Jon Fleischman, a Sheriff's Department spokesman, said the
accident occurred about 10 p.m. Saturday as Gaard and Gould were
investigating a drive-by shooting in San Clemente. No one was wounded
in the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The deputies were assigned to a K-9 unit when their patrol car
collided with a minivan at Pacific Coast Highway and Camino
Capistrano in Dana Point. Fleischman said that Gaard tried to veer
from the van before they hit.</TE>
<TE>   The police car rolled several times, sailed about 20 feet and
caught fire on an embankment. Other deputies put out the blaze and
removed their injured colleagues from the wreckage. The cause of the
accident is under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "Having seen the vehicle," Fleischman said, "it is a miracle that
the two deputies are alive."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said that Gaard suffered some swelling of the brain
and was placed in a medically induced coma to relieve the condition.
His status has improved from critical to guarded. He is expected to
remain in the coma for some time, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the four occupants of the van received broken bones. They
also were treated at Mission Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff's patrol dog was unhurt.</TE>

<LD>Not even the Terminator could bring people out to the first
multicultural festival in Westminster, which was hampered all weekend
by small crowds.</LD>
<LD>   About 400 people came Sunday afternoon to hear actor and health
enthusiast Arnold Schwarzenegger promote his latest cause, the After
School Education and Safety Program Act. The November ballot
initiative would provide elementary and junior high schools with
matching state funds for after-school programs.</LD>
<LD>   Organizers of Multi-Cultural Festival 2002 were expecting 20,000
to attend the three-day event, which was an attempt to unite the
local Vietnamese community with other cultures and ethnic groups. But
only a few hundred people turned out Friday and Saturday. Sunday's
crowd fell well short of the 8,000 that was projected.</LD>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger, who is currently shooting "Terminator 3," spoke
for about five minutes on his desire to give every child a place to
go after school.</TE>
<TE>   "Our children are our No. 1 investment, and they are not getting a
fair shake," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Too many kids are unsupervised between the hours of 3 p.m. and 6
p.m., and that's when teenage crime and pregnancies happen. More
after-school programs are the answer to the problems."</TE>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger was part of a salute to veterans, which included a
tribute to sculptor Tuan Nguyen, who created the Vietnam War Memorial
Statue.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, a Miss America Inter-Nationale contest was held and the
queen--Casey Burns, 20, of Long Beach--was crowned Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   Planning for the festival began in January by the Friends of the
Abbey, the Vietnamese Community of Orange County and the
Asian-American Senior Citizens Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Vendors of Mexican food, Polynesian dancers and the USA Country
Cloggers, a dance troupe, came together at the festival. The grounds
across from the Civic Center on 13th Street were filled with game
booths, soft-drink vendors, rides and exhibits as well as Vietnamese
and Thai cuisine.</TE>
<TE>   Ann Tran, 37, a dentist from Orange, said she brought some of her
cousins from Torrance to show them what's happening in the Vietnamese
community, but she was disappointed by the festival's lack of
support. "This is sad," Tran said. "I think it's not working because
it's not advertised."</TE>
<TE>   However, Sheryl Daniel-Park, an African American visiting from
Baltimore, saw a festival advertisement Friday on Beach Boulevard.
She strolled around the grounds Sunday but she too was disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   "Multicultural to me means all different cultures," Daniel-Park
said. "I have not seen any African American people since I've been
here."</TE>

<HD>9/11 Fervor, Fire Danger Make Fourth Even Riskier</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY and CHRISTINA ESPARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the aftermath of Sept. 11, many Americans are expected to
celebrate the Fourth of July with extra gusto this year by buying
fireworks and shooting them off.</LD>
<LD>   But the West is burning, and the bone-dry landscape of California
is as ripe as it ever has been for fires.</LD>
<LD>   So here in a state that writer Wallace Stegner described as "land
of little water--and big consequences," thoughts of a bottle-rocket's
red glare and fireworks bursting in air have communities from
Sacramento to San Diego on increased alert.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities are promising more patrols and less tolerance for
dangerous behavior. They are pleading with the public to attend
organized shows. Officials said they are walking a fine line, trying
to prevent risky behavior that could spark fires without
extinguishing the public's renewed sense of patriotism.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest danger lies in Southern California, where no end is in
sight to a dry spell, and fire season has arrived weeks ahead of
schedule, already consuming more than 75,000 acres and destroying
dozens of homes.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Fire Authority Chief Chip Prather has gone so far as
to ask the public not to buy or use even "safe and sane" legal
fireworks, a move that has ignited criticism among charities that
benefit from the sales.</TE>
<TE>   Prather and his peers say the stakes are too high and they are
taking no chances.</TE>
<TE>   "Our current drought situation is so dangerous that any
nonprofessional discharge of fireworks runs the risk of causing a
tragedy of major proportions," the chief said.</TE>
<TE>   With forest fires in Arizona and Colorado in mind, Prather added:
"Anyone who thinks those kinds of fires can't occur here is wrong.
This area is very vulnerable to a widespread fire that could destroy
property and homes and even cost lives."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   State's Laws Are Tough</TE>
<TE>   Although it is not among the eight states that outlaw all
fireworks, California ranks as one of nation's tougher regulators.
The state is among 19 that allow only "safe and sane" devices,
including party-poppers and cone fountains. Even these are prohibited
in more than half of California's 476 cities. Statewide, more than 20
types of fireworks are banned, including firecrackers, bottle
rockets, M-80s and large sparklers.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, anything is illegal if it flies through the air,
scurries on the ground or explodes--in other words, if it's out of
control," said Karen Terrill, spokeswoman for the state Fire Marshal.
"These things are not toys. They burn people's houses down, they set
the wild lands on fire, and they cause a lot of injury."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, fireworks caused 286 fires, $451,000 in damages and 213
injuries in California, according to the Fire Marshal's office.
Terrill said the numbers have dropped gradually since 1996, when
nearly 1,000 fires caused $9.2 million in damages.</TE>
<TE>   This year could reverse the trend, and not just because of dry
conditions. The National Council on Fireworks Safety reports that
sales and use of fireworks could reach record levels as Americans
unite after the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We know this year, based on what we've heard from dealers in the
industry, that sales are brisk," said council spokeswoman Ann
Crampton. "If you're choosing to celebrate that way, you need to take
extra care."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sales Ban Is Rebuffed</TE>
<TE>   Sales booths opened Friday in cities across Southern California
where "safe and sane" fireworks are allowed, providing cash for the
charities and service groups that operate them. Efforts by Prather
and other authorities to discourage or ban these sales outright have
been rebuffed by opponents, who argued that the ban would be
ineffective and hurt groups with noble causes.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities agree they cannot stop people who want to shoot off
their own fireworks from getting them from counties or states where
they are legal, or smuggling them from Mexico. And this year, they
also know that by the time they catch someone in the act, it may be
too late.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement is beefing up most in cities where backyards bump
up against or blend in with the back country. It's here where one
wind-borne ember could ignite a deadly blaze.</TE>
<TE>   In many of these communities, officials are stepping up patrols,
educating the public through fliers, direct mail and road signs, and
asking citizens to help by looking out more than usual for
mischievous behavior and fires.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, where about half the cities can sell
approved fireworks, extra patrols are designated for fire-prone areas
like Malibu, the scene of devastating brush fires in 1993 and 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Lynn Mohr, who works in Malibu, remembers watching homes
burn.</TE>
<TE>   "There's brush everywhere here. If it caught on fire, the
hillsides will be ablaze," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Laguna Beach, where a 1993 canyon fire destroyed 450 homes and
caused more than $500 million in damage, 13 additional firefighters
and two additional engine companies will be on hand. More signs than
usual have been posted around the city and at beaches to remind
residents and visitors that fireworks are banned.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters Get Ready</TE>
<TE>   To shore up coverage across Orange County, the Fire Authority's
seven investigators will all be on duty, and all 150 units will be on
patrol at least a portion of the day. Two helicopters will be
standing by, and an extra strike team with five engines and battalion
chief will be available for any calls.</TE>
<TE>   Rangers at state parks and national forests are also gearing up
for a busy holiday, knowing that there are always problems, even when
visitors follow the rules. Dave Reider, regional spokesman for the
U.S. Forest Service, warned that even the heat from a car engine can
spark a disaster.</TE>
<TE>   "You could spit on a flat rock and start a fire," Reider said,
using a firefighters' adage. "We're always concerned about the Fourth
of July. But the situation in Southern California is extremely
dangerous this year. The last thing we need is more human-caused
fires."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Penalties Are Stiffer</TE>
<TE>   For those caught with fireworks, the penalties are getting
stiffer.</TE>
<TE>   In Northern California, Sacramento and Placer counties will impose
their "No More Mr. Nice Guy" policy for a third straight year. Under
these guidelines, considered among the toughest in the state, anyone
caught using or possessing illegal fireworks is subject to up to a
year in jail and a $5,000 fine. If a child is around, child
endangerment charges will also be filed, and could lead to a minimum
of 45 days in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, citations typically draw fines of up to $500 and a year
in jail, but in many cases are dropped in favor of warnings. But Ray
Rodriguez, Los Angeles County fire inspector, said "things are so hot
right now, I don't know how nice a deputy or a police officer is
going to be."</TE>
<TE>   In Montebello, 12-year-old David Veiga promised to be safe as he
arrived at a fireworks booth with an adult. Veiga said he always is
supervised by adults, keeps a bucket of water nearby, uses only legal
fireworks and lights them with special long matchsticks called
"punks."</TE>
<TE>   But the thought of outlawing fireworks upsets him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be very, very mad. It would be unfair," he says. "It's the
Fourth of July; everybody wants to have fun."</TE>

<DH>Probe: Driver returns to where autistic girl was hit in 'a
tragic accident, not a crime,' police say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The driver of a sport utility vehicle that struck and killed a
5-year-old autistic girl near her Laguna Niguel home probably will
not be charged, authorities said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Early reports called the accident a hit and run. But Orange County
sheriff's Lt. Greg Russell said it appears that the driver returned
to the scene. He said investigators still are checking the vehicle.
"If it does turn out this is the vehicle, then the person did return
to the scene," Russell said.</LD>
<LD>   Because Myla Richard stepped into traffic from a center island on
Crown Valley Parkway, near Moulton Parkway, the driver would not be
charged. Russell called the incident "a tragic accident, not a
crime."</LD>
<TE>   Myla slipped out of her house through a dog door Friday night,
wearing only a diaper. She climbed over a 2-foot block wall, opened a
wooden gate and walked down a 100-foot slope covered with ice plant
and shrubs.</TE>
<TE>   Myla crossed three lanes of Crown Valley to get to the traffic
island. Several drivers stopped their cars when they saw her. An
animal control officer stopped, turned on her vehicle's flashing
lights and tried to reach Myla.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the child put her hands over her ears and stepped into
traffic heading the opposite direction. She was struck by an SUV and
thrown about 50 feet.</TE>

<HD>Veterans Win Fight to Save Gymnasium</HD>
<DH>Retrofitting: Work will begin Tuesday on a $2-million
project at North Hills VA facility, following three-year lobbying
effort.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIMA A. HAYNES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly every morning for a decade, 79-year-old Steven T. Palmer
worked out the kinks in the gym and pool at Sepulveda Ambulatory Care
and Nursing Home.</LD>
<LD>   But in 1999, the Department of Veterans Affairs shuttered the
North Hills facility in response to a report on damage caused by the
Northridge earthquake.</LD>
<LD>   The decision outraged Palmer, a World War II Navy veteran, who
then mustered other veterans who used the facility to push the VA to
repair it.</LD>
<TE>   "That swimming pool and gym were my life," said Palmer of Panorama
City. "It kept me active--and out of the nursing home."</TE>
<TE>   So Tuesday, when construction workers officially break ground,
Palmer and his group will celebrate their victory in the battle to
keep the gymnasium alive.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of their three-year lobbying effort, Congress
appropriated $2 million for an earthquake retrofit project for the
gymnasium. Crews will demolish and rebuild inside walls, showers,
locker rooms, offices, the gym floor and sections of the foundation,
said Ed Amador, engineer and project manager.</TE>
<TE>   The swimming pool, however, will remain closed, and the veterans
will have to make do with an existing therapy pool in a nearby
building.</TE>
<TE>   The retrofit project is expected to take a year to complete.</TE>
<TE>   Reps. Howard P. "Buck" McKeon (R-Santa Clarita) and Howard Berman
(D-Mission Hills), who were instrumental in securing federal funding
for the project, are expected to attend the groundbreaking ceremony,
scheduled for 2:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The project comes at a time when veterans say their benefits are
slowly being eroded.</TE>
<TE>   A Veterans Affairs official announced in March that the department
is considering a plan to move rare and expensive patient diagnostic
procedures from North Hills to its West Los Angeles facility as a
cost-saving measure.</TE>
<TE>   Agency officials argue that the potential changes are necessary
because annual federal appropriations have not kept pace with the
rising number of veterans seeking care.</TE>
<TE>   Although a final decision has not been made, those who rely on the
clinic for medical and counseling services say the move could portend
the closure of the North Hills facility, which primarily serves
veterans in the San Fernando Valley and other parts of northern Los
Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   "The opening of the gym is a small bit of tokenism because we are
[losing] everything else," Palmer said. Even so, former Air Force
Sgt. David E. Thomas said the gym's reopening will go a long way
toward healing veterans' physical and emotional wounds.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of guys--especially those with physical problems or drug
and alcohol problems--felt like the gym was their only way to connect
with society," said Thomas, a 44-year-old computer programmer from
Encino. "When that gym closed, they suffered greatly."</TE>

<HD>Roquemore Leads Irvine Valley College</HD>
<DH>Education: The new leader had been vice president of
instruction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RAY HERNDON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Glenn R. Roquemore, officially becomes president of Irvine Valley
College today, following his appointment last week by trustees of the
South Orange County Community College District.</LD>
<LD>   Roquemore, who had been vice president of instruction at the
college for the past two years, was chosen to head the two-year
college after a nationwide search, said officials for district, which
includes IVC and Saddleback colleges.</LD>
<LD>   Raghu P. Mathur, IVC president until he became chancellor earlier
this year, said Roquemore "knows, understands and is qualified to
address the needs of the college," which saw near-constant discord
between faculty and administration during Mathur's presidency.</LD>
<TE>   In a statement, Mathur said Roquemore brings to his new position
"an extra dimension of experience in technology, in addition to
strong interpersonal skills to work with all internal and external
constituencies."</TE>
<TE>   Roquemore said he felt honored "to have gained the trust of the
board of trustees, the chancellor and the college. I appreciate the
support of the faculty, staff and administration of Irvine Valley
College."</TE>
<TE>   Before moving into administration, Roquemore had 27 years of
academic and research experience in geology and geophysics. He earned
bachelor's and master's degrees from Cal State Fresno, and his
doctorate from the University of Nevada. He has taught at Cal State
Long Beach, San Diego State University, and was a lecturer at UC
Irvine for seven years.</TE>
<TE>   Roquemore joined Irvine Valley College in 1990 as professor of
geology, and was named vice president of student services in 1998,
and vice president of instruction two years ago.</TE>

<HD>Abductor Turns Gun on Himself</HD>
<DH>Crime: Woman kidnapped in Irvine flees after car gets
stuck. Man commits suicide as sheriff's deputies close in.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 24-year-old man who abducted a woman at gunpoint in Irvine, forcing
her to drive off with him, killed himself with a bullet to the head
as sheriff's deputies closed in, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The dead man was identified as Rajeev Mathur, 24, of Lake Forest.
He apparently didn't know the woman, who was not injured, authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   The incident began at 12:30 a.m. Saturday, when Allison Olszewski,
21, was parking in the carport at the Stanford Court Apartments in
the 600 block of Stanford Court in Irvine.</LD>
<TE>   Mathur pulled a gun and demanded she unlock the passenger door of
her Saturn. Once inside, he told Olszewski to drive south on the San
Diego Freeway, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Back on surface streets, the car hit a curb at El Toro Road and
Santa Margarita Parkway in Lake Forest, and either broke down or
became stuck. Orange County sheriff's deputies did not know if
Olszewski hit the curb on purpose.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly afterward, deputies received a call from a witness driving
by who told them Mathur was pointing a gun at Olszewski and forcing
her to push the car. She was screaming.</TE>
<TE>   When six sheriff's patrol cars and a helicopter arrived at the
scene, Olszewski made a run for it, sheriff's Lt. Greg Russell said.</TE>
<TE>   Mathur ran after Olszewski and fired two shots either at her or
into the air, Russell said.</TE>
<TE>   She was not hit.</TE>
<TE>   Mathur then ran from deputies along a bike bath and under a
freeway overpass.</TE>
<TE>   As a deputy was aiming an assault rifle at Mathur, he stopped and
shot himself in the head, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Paramedics declared him dead at the scene.</TE>

<HD>Living Wage Proponents Plan Petition Drive</HD>
<DH>Ventura: Backers of higher pay by city contractors, a
proposal the council rejected in March, hope to let voters decide the
issue in 2003.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Supporters of a failed bid for a living wage law in Ventura said they
will use tonight's City Council meeting to launch a petition drive
aimed at putting the issue before voters next year.</LD>
<LD>   "It's important that the Ventura City Council know that this issue
is not going away," said Das Williams, a spokesman for the
Ventura-based Living Wage Coalition. "But I think it's important we
have a civil discussion."</LD>
<LD>   Williams will be joined at the council meeting by a mix of college
students, church leaders, union representatives and community
activists.</LD>
<TE>   Supporters will hold a candlelight vigil outside the council
chambers before going inside to speak about the issue during the
public comment period. More than two dozen speakers are expected to
address the council, supporters said. At least 50 others are expected
to attend the council meeting in a show of support.</TE>
<TE>   Coalition members also will announce plans to start a petition
drive to get the required signatures from 15% of registered voters in
time to have the living wage issue on the ballot for the fall 2003
election.</TE>
<TE>   Each member of the coalition will be urged to use his or her
allotted five-minute speaking period as a show of protest to the
council, said Stuart Dilg, one of the event's organizers and a member
of the coalition.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my responsibility to do something like this," said Dilg, 19,
a Buena High graduate who attends Emory University in Atlanta. "It
represents to me the movement for responsible capitalism. We need an
era of ethical business where workers are not exploited."</TE>
<TE>   Between his shifts as a busboy at a downtown Ventura restaurant,
Dilg has spent his summer break rallying new support for the petition
plan among religious leaders and members of the Interfaith
Ministerial Council.</TE>
<TE>   He said tonight's gathering "is one way we are showing the City
Council we are not going to give up. They have to face this issue.
It's a type of civil disobedience."</TE>
<TE>   Council members insist they made their opinion clear on the
question of a living wage for Ventura when they turned down the
ordinance three months ago.</TE>
<TE>   By a 5-2 vote in March, the City Council rejected a proposal that
would have forced companies doing business with the city to pay their
employees at least $9 hour.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the Living Wage Coalition have said that more than
5,000 households in Ventura have a principal income of less than
$7.50 an hour, and at least 8,600 city residents collect public
assistance from the county. Opponents have countered that the
ordinance would force companies doing business with the city to face
the choice of laying off workers or losing their businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Despite impassioned pleas by supporters, the council balked at the
plan after a study by its staff determined it would cost the city
$400,000 to $800,000 annually.</TE>
<TE>   The council's decision and the debate over a living wage law
followed similar discussions elsewhere in Southern California,
including the city and county of Los Angeles, Santa Monica, San
Fernando and Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, the Oxnard City Council passed a living wage
policy, which orders companies doing business with the city to pay
workers $9 an hour. Because it's a policy and not a law, Oxnard can
immediately cut ties with a company not complying but cannot impose a
fine, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura City Councilman Jim Friedman said he voted against the
ordinance because whatever benefits it may have offered workers were
outweighed by "a society overburdened by laws."</TE>
<TE>   He said the city already pays its employees well over the minimum
wage of $6.75 per hour.</TE>
<TE>   "My suggestion is that they need to go to Sacramento and get the
legislators there to change the [minimum wage]," he said. "It would
be legislating higher costs to our taxpayers for no better service.
It doesn't make sense to me."</TE>

<HD>Brakeless Bikers Defy Gravity, Geography</HD>
<DH>Messengers: Nonstop action delivers a rush for San
Francisco's downhill racers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>In this city of steep climbs and killer hills, Nestor Guzman runs
with a posse of gonzo bicycle messengers pursuing a fad considered
the ultimate in courier cool: riding with no brakes.</LD>
<LD>   Five days a week, the athletic 22-year-old braves arduous inclines
and hair-raising descents on a fixed-gear "track" bike--an ultralight
cycle designed for competition on banked ovals called velodromes.</LD>
<LD>   What it is not designed to do is stop, which for Guzman makes it
exciting. "I don't want brakes," he said. "I'd rather pit my skills
against the world."</LD>
<TE>   Defying laws against bicycles without brakes, Guzman and other
couriers personify the machismo of maximum danger, pulling a stunt
tantamount to tightrope walking without a net.</TE>
<TE>   For these young thrill-seekers, track bikes raise the stakes among
a cocky messenger crowd already riding a razor-thin line of safety on
their daily dash through near-impossible traffic.</TE>
<TE>   In this devil-may-care subculture dominated by iconoclasts with
tongue studs and pink hair--men and women who wouldn't be caught dead
in an office job and who often ride without helmets--track bikes
define the outermost realm of road peril.</TE>
<TE>   Couriers describe the addictive rush of steering a brakeless
bicycle when the only way to stop is through a host of complex moves,
from zig-zags to controlled skids in which riders buck the rear wheel
sideways down the slope like a snow skier slowing his descent.</TE>
<TE>   The track bike rage has swept cities nationwide, including Los
Angeles and San Diego--most often on flatter, gentler terrain.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking with the indestructibility of youth, Guzman said riding a
track bike on this city's vertigo-inducing hills provides an
adrenaline fix: "I love skidding down a hill past dumbfounded
tourists who say, 'Oh my God! He doesn't have any brakes!' If you're
young, that's the kind of thing you live for."</TE>
<TE>   Without shift cables to snap, derailleurs to rust, brake pads to
fail, track bikes embody what Guzman calls "elegance and simplicity."</TE>
<TE>   Some fellow messengers say he forgot one word: "stupidity."</TE>
<TE>   Because even in freewheeling San Francisco--where the bike-riding
culture carries political weight--police, messenger firms and older
couriers say track bike Turks cross a serious line of irresponsible
behavior. Citing chronic knee damage and accidents, many wonder
whether it's time to rein in such risk-takers.</TE>
<TE>   Veterans riders dismiss the bikes as "suicide rockets" and
"leg-beaters" for the unhealthy pounding they impose on a rider's
knees. Many track bike aficionados display the scars of their
stubbornness, bearing incisions from knee surgery to repair
everything from ligament pops to cartilage tears.</TE>
<TE>   Though there are no statistics on track bike injuries, San
Francisco officers ticket couriers for violating a state Vehicle Code
section requiring all bicycles to have brakes enough "to make one
braked wheel skid on dry level clean pavement."</TE>
<TE>   Some courier firms also outlaw track bikes. The backlash has even
hit New York, which gave birth to the brakeless trend years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen track bikes mow down more innocent people than I care
to count, and I just don't want to be a part of that anymore," said
Mike McGinn, owner of Specialized Legal Services in San Francisco.
"If one of my guys runs somebody down on a bike without brakes, how's
that gonna look in court?"</TE>
<TE>   Guzman ignores such critics, preferring the kick of riding a bike
on which the pedals constantly rotate and there is no coasting, not
even downhill. And he handles San Francisco's cliff-like grades like
Steve McQueen in that famous car chase in the 1968 movie "Bullitt."</TE>
<TE>   Guzman blows through stop signs and red lights. He rides against
traffic on one-way streets and cruises along double-yellow lines with
only an elbow's room between passing vehicles on either side.</TE>
<TE>   Moving up a steep North Beach hill, he stands and pedals briskly
to gain momentum with the quickness and grace of a gazelle. With no
brakes on the descent, Guzman locks his legs so the pedals no longer
turn, throwing the back wheel into a series of sideways skids.</TE>
<TE>   With a grimace, he said his knees throb at the end of his
eight-hour shift.</TE>
<TE>   In three years, Guzman's been grazed a dozen times as he dodged
menacing cabbies, lumbering buses and driver's-side doors from parked
cars that suddenly swing open into his path.</TE>
<TE>   "These track bikes are a young man's game," he said. "It's like
how young guys go for fast sports cars, while the older dudes settle
for the family station wagon. I'm not ready for that yet."</TE>
<TE>   For Paul Bouganim, six years on a track bike resulted in surgery
to remove the bursa, or fluid sac, from between the bones in his
right knee. His leg bandaged, he walks with a pronounced limp.</TE>
<TE>   "These bikes ruin your knees," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why he continues on his track bike, the 27-year-old
responds: "I'm stupid." Then he fingers a 3-inch scar and winces. "It
hurts really bad today. With a geared bike, I could ease through the
pain. But I'm stubborn."</TE>
<TE>   For Bouganim, the art of riding a track bike provides a bit of ego
compensation in a business world that each day delivers countless
slights and disrespects.</TE>
<TE>   From grouchy secretaries to dismissive security guards, it's a
white-collar society that fails to appreciate his efforts to overcome
obstacles ranging from traffic jams to street construction--often
using the sidewalk as a last resort--to ferry a package across town
faster than any automobile.</TE>
<TE>   Clearing perhaps $100 a day, messengers race around with oversized
delivery pouches and walkie-talkies on their backs. Being able to
handle a track bike that no arrogant $400-an-hour lawyer in town--and
even few fellow couriers--would dare ride offers a sense of pride.</TE>
<TE>   Says Bouganim, who sports a praying mantis leg tattoo: "Not
everybody can do this."</TE>
<TE>   About a third of the city's 300 couriers use track bikes. Many
stick to the flatlands around the federal courthouse, while others
tackle hills so difficult they're often forced to walk their bikes.</TE>
<TE>   Prefaced by signs reading "Sharp Crest Ahead" and "Abrupt Grade
Change," the steepest hills can easily make runaways of cars whose
parking brakes aren't properly set.</TE>
<TE>   One section of Filbert Street in Russian Hill features a 31.3%
grade, among the nation's steepest slopes for a city street--an
incline only slightly less pronounced than the ski jump course used
at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Utah. This urban landscape is so
precipitous that cycling stalwarts who have endured the French Alps
have complained that the hills are too difficult.</TE>
<TE>   This being San Francisco, couriers talk in mystical terms of the
Zen of zero bike maintenance and of "being one with the bike" for
their level of control in the saddle. Knowing they cannot stop
quickly, they pay more attention to traffic--making them safer
cyclists, or so they wish to think.</TE>
<TE>   And they liken the frames to the first bicycle sketches by
Leonardo da Vinci in the 1500s. "Aesthetically, it's incredibly
sexy," said courier Griffin McPartland. "It just stirred something in
my gut."</TE>
<TE>   The track bike trend hit San Francisco in 1996, during an
international bike messenger contest. The competitors included Richie
Ditta, a redheaded New Yorker who drew stares with his brakeless
bike. Now 29, Ditta recalls the stir among local couriers, many of
whom had never seen such a cycle.</TE>
<TE>   "It took the rebel image to a new level," he said. "It's like
skateboarding: One person thinks it's cool; then somebody else gets
into it."</TE>
<TE>   But "Dr. Crank," advice columnist for a local bike messengers'
newsletter, says track bikers should get a life.</TE>
<TE>   "If looking cool is your primary concern, then by all means ride a
track bike. If you want to get the job done in the right manner, then
ride a geared bike," he writes. "To do otherwise is to perpetuate the
myth that bike couriers are more interested in hanging out and
looking cool than working hard."</TE>
<TE>   During a recent afternoon rush hour, a track bike rider pounded
through traffic without brakes or helmet, and no hands on the
handlebars.</TE>
<TE>   Observed a fellow no-brakes courier: "Now there's a guy with a
death wish."</TE>

<HD>Standoff Torpedoes Budget Deadline</HD>
<DH>Finances: Assembly Republicans block passage on the day
before the fiscal year begins.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI and MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- A partisan standoff in the Assembly on Sunday over $4
billion in new taxes caused Gov. Gray Davis to miss a midnight
deadline for signing a new state budget by the start of the fiscal
year.</LD>
<LD>   Assembly Republicans halted passage of the budget, saying that it
spends too much money and does too little to avoid the billions of
dollars in tax hikes necessary to close a $23.6-billion deficit. The
plan failed 49 to 26, five votes short of passage.</LD>
<LD>   The Assembly is scheduled to meet again today.</LD>
<TE>   Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) said he was
disappointed and voiced frustration over what he described as months
of trying to negotiate with his GOP counterpart, Dave Cox of Fair
Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't consider the word 'No' to be negotiating," Wesson said.
"Now the clock's ticking. Being the optimistic person that I am, I
would hope we'd begin negotiating in earnest."</TE>
<TE>   Davis, meanwhile, compared spending cuts proposed by the GOP with
cotton candy, suggesting that they lacked substance.</TE>
<TE>   "I am disappointed in the Assembly Republicans. They proved they
had one goal and one goal only, which is to obstruct passage of the
budget."</TE>
<TE>   The budget cleared the Senate on Saturday after a lone Republican,
Sen. Maurice Johannessen of Redding, joined the Democratic majority
in supporting it. In the Assembly, however, four Republican votes are
needed to approve the plan, which then goes to Davis for his
signature.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats accused Republicans on Sunday of holding up the budget
to embarrass Davis, who is running for reelection against GOP
candidate Bill Simon. Republicans brushed the contention aside and
took turns attacking the document, saying it raids transportation
funds, borrows heavily against the future and raises taxes.</TE>
<TE>   The spending plan and a variety of related bills would double
vehicle license fees paid by motorists to raise $1.3 billion in the
new fiscal year. The package also would increase the state excise tax
on cigarettes by 63 cents for a total tax of $1.50 per pack to raise
$650 million.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Rod Pacheco (R-Riverside) unleashed a blistering
attack on the spending plan. He accused Democrats of "financial
insanity" and described the document as "worthless trash."</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Tony Strickland (R-Moorpark) said the plan is more
than Californians can handle.</TE>
<TE>   "They can't afford your tax increases," Strickland said. "They
can't afford your spending here in Sacramento."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats lined up to defend the plan and their efforts to reduce
spending.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked everywhere we could to find savings, in every corner of
the state," said Assembly Budget Committee Chairwoman Jenny Oropeza
(D-Long Beach).</TE>
<TE>   In a sign that perhaps all is not well in the Democratic caucus,
Assemblywoman Helen Thomson (D-Davis) warned that the state could
hurt people by adopting the plan because it contains too few new
taxes, and that she would only reluctantly vote to support it.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hurting real people," Thomson said. "What saves me today is
that I know there [aren't] going to be 54 votes."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans and Democrats traded barbs over a decision by
Democrats to pass a measure that diminished the need for Republican
support on a $1.7-billion education funding shift sought by Davis to
help balance the budget.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Republicans had withheld their support for the plan in an
effort to get Democrats to sign off on a GOP proposal to earmark $400
million in the 2003-04 fiscal year to help make funding between rural
and urban schools more even.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Democrats approved a measure Sunday that re-appropriates
$1.7 billion in current year money for community colleges and K-12
schools to the California State University system, so the money can
later be appropriated back to community colleges and public schools.
The change did not require Republican support.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what happens when you try to paint one side into a
corner," said Assemblyman Thomas Calderon (D-Montebello). "We just
painted a new door."</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman George Runner Jr. (R-Lancaster) described the
Democrats' actions as a "shell game."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a high-handed manipulation of the law," Runner said. "And
you can do it, but it doesn't serve the state of California well."</TE>

<HD>Latest in Anaheim Is Also What's Oldest</HD>
<DH>Neighborhoods: Once a German colony, the historic heart of
town is abuzz with home renovations and even houses in motion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not so long ago, real estate agent Meghan Shigo had to beg people to
"take a chance" on the old homes in the historic heart of Anaheim,
the original colony settled by Germans.</LD>
<LD>   Now, home buyers--many of them young professionals--are engaged in
bidding wars, snatching up the Craftsman bungalows and Colonial
Revivals sometimes before Shigo has had a chance to put up a "For
Sale" sign.</LD>
<LD>   Shigo isn't sure which came first, the demand for homes or the
neighborhood's transformation. One thing is clear: The Anaheim
Historic Colony District is being reborn.</LD>
<TE>   Prodded by residents, city officials have embarked on a major
preservation campaign that includes property tax breaks for those who
restore their homes and moving old houses slated for demolition.</TE>
<TE>   "This was an area where the city bought old homes, knocked them
down and built apartments," said Jim Granger, one such
homeowner-renovator. "Now, they buy apartments, knock them down and
bring in old homes."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the change came after 1997, when residents encouraged the
city to designate the area the Anaheim Colony Historic District. In
1999, the city published a preservation plan that details homeowner
guidelines and several goals and projects--many of which are just now
coming to fruition.</TE>
<TE>   Before Granger bought it, a "watered-down Victorian" called the
Hatfield House was nearly demolished to make way for an Auto Zone
store. But the city stepped in, bought the 96-year-old house for a
dollar, moved it to an empty lot and sold it to Granger, who promised
to refurbish it.</TE>
<TE>   It sat for three years while paperwork was completed. Granger is
now starting to move his family in.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Caution, Homes Crossing</TE>
<TE>   More than 25 transplanted homes are sprinkled throughout the
2-square-mile Colony District, bounded by North, South, East and West
streets. All of them probably would have been razed for development
were it not for the residents' and the city's heightened interest in
preservation.</TE>
<TE>   Seven more homes are being moved as part of the city's most recent
project on Lemon Avenue. Three already have been refurbished and
converted into low- and medium-income housing; the other four will be
moved today. "Everything we do really goes to enhancing the sense
that downtown is the heart of Anaheim and, in particular, this colony
community," said Brad Hobson, the city's deputy executive director
for community development.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the city sponsored a tour of several historic homes.
It has erected monuments marking the Colony's borders, opened a new
park complete with mural reproductions of historic packing labels,
and installed antique-style light posts.</TE>
<TE>   When it gets the chance, the city's redevelopment agency is buying
and saving old homes and buildings, including the last standing
citrus packing plant, which it hopes to convert into a museum with
offices or eateries.</TE>

<TE>   Tax Incentive Kicks In</TE>
<TE>   Residents are also beginning to see the results of a Mills Act
program launched last year. The act is a state-sponsored economic
incentive program offering lowered property taxes for owners of
"qualified historical properties" who pledge to preserve, restore and
maintain the historical and architectural character of those
properties. Owners of such homes, which must be included on the local
or national historic registry, can apply for the program.</TE>
<TE>   The owners save up to 55% in property taxes for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Since the city began the program--now the eighth largest in the
state--55 homeowners have applied. Shigo, the real estate agent, can
see the difference.</TE>
<TE>   She points out the paint jobs, landscaping and new shingle roofs.
Next, the city will help residents buy bronze Mills Act plaques to
help identify the designated homes.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl Hill, 83, has lived in her gabled Colonial Revival home for
47 years. The property tax saving means little to her because she has
lived in the 1919 home for so long. But she filed a Mills Act
application for the prestige of it. Plus, if she ever decides to
sell, the tax saving could be transferred to the buyer for the next
10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Hill repainted her home a pale yellow and put on new cedar
shingles. The roofing job cost $15,000--$1,000 more than she paid for
her home.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it," Hill said. "We have had more people stop, knock on
the door and ask if they can see the house."</TE>
<TE>   Even though 15 to 20 people call Shigo each week about the homes,
she still considers the historic district one of Orange County's
best-kept secrets.</TE>
<TE>   A 1,000-square-foot bungalow in Anaheim costs about $250,000.
Larger homes generally go for $350,000 to $400,000. Comparable old
homes in Orange or Fullerton, both known for their historic
neighborhoods, cost about $70,000 to $100,000 more, Shigo said.</TE>
<TE>   Lety Rodriguez, 36, bought one of Anaheim's relocated and
renovated homes after looking elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Anaheim needs to work on marketing, because I ran into it
by accident," Rodriguez said. "This is a great neighborhood....
Orange has beautiful homes and a lot of old, restored bungalows, but
they're just out of my price range. I also looked in Fullerton. The
only difference really is the ZIP Code."</TE>

<HD>6 Killed in Crash of 2 Small Planes</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: The aircraft were on a pleasure flight through
mountains in Santa Barbara County.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH, RICHARD O'REILLY and TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Sunday morning jaunt by a group of pilots from the San Fernando
Valley turned tragic when two of their small planes flew into a
mountain in southern Santa Barbara County, killing six.</LD>
<LD>   Eight aircraft were flying in single-file formation at a low
altitude when the two front planes flew into mountainous terrain five
miles north of Monte Arido in Los Padres National Forest, according
to Kathy Goode, a U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman.</LD>
<LD>   Pilots and passengers in the six trailing planes watched in horror
as the two Beechcraft Bonanzas crashed several hundred feet below the
6,000-foot ridgeline, one of the highest in the area.</LD>
<TE>   "The lead and No. 2 went into a box canyon that they couldn't get
out of," said Craig Schulze, a Burbank resident who was a passenger
in one of the trailing planes.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities could not immediately confirm the identities of the
victims, believed to be five men and a woman. Schulze said some of
the victims were part of a close-knit group of pilots based at
Whiteman and Van Nuys airports.</TE>
<TE>   About 150 firefighters battled a 75-acre wildfire that was sparked
by the crashes, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Some of the
firefighters descended with ropes to battle the flames in the steep
terrain. The blaze was extinguished by late afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   The informal group liked to make Sunday morning trips to the coast
or other destinations, Schulze said. On Sunday, they were heading for
Oceano County Airport near Pismo Beach, where they planned to have
lunch before returning to Van Nuys Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Schulze, who began flying with the group this year, said he and
others had flown four planes from Whiteman Airport in Pacoima to join
the other aircraft at Van Nuys Airport on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The fleet of four-seater planes left Van Nuys about 10:30 a.m.,
Schulze said, and the route took them over rugged, mountainous
terrain.</TE>
<TE>   After the two lead planes crashed, the remaining aircraft broke
formation and circled the area for 15 minutes. Upon seeing rescue
helicopters arrive, they turned south, back toward the Valley,
Schulze said.</TE>
<TE>   As four of the planes returned to Whiteman about 1:30 p.m., somber
friends met the fliers with hugs and silence.</TE>
<TE>   There were sad discussions in various hangars at the airport as
pilots, spouses and friends tried to understand how the accident
happened.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the returning pilots told friends they barely cleared the
ridge where the two Bonanzas crashed, according to witnesses who
asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   The Bonanzas, both built in the 1960s, were worth about $100,000
and could cruise at nearly 200 mph. That V-tail model is no longer
manufactured but long enjoyed a reputation as the best of its class.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, the group flew in single-file formation with the lead
plane lowest and each other plane following at a safe distance, above
and to the right of the plane ahead, according to sources familiar
with the group.</TE>
<TE>   That formation allows each pilot, sitting on the left side of the
plane, the best view of the planes ahead.</TE>
<TE>   In most cases, the FAA has no rules about how low planes can fly
over unpopulated areas. However, every pilot is responsible for
maintaining adequate terrain clearance.</TE>
<TE>   Pilots who have taken special training for mountain flying noted
that most small airplanes are unable to outclimb steeply rising
terrain, and thus pilots must begin their climbs early to make sure
they aren't trapped at the heads of canyons.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very difficult time for those who survived it as well, who
lost their friends," Schulze said.</TE>
<TE>   But he said he would not allow his friends' deaths to deter him
from the pastime they loved.</TE>
<TE>   "I still enjoy flying," he said.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Deputy in Coma After Crash</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County sheriff's deputy remained in a coma Sunday after his
patrol car collided with a minivan and burst into flames during the
hunt for a drive-by shooting suspect, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Mike Gaard, 33, who received multiple fractures and
lacerations in the accident Saturday, was in a medically induced coma
at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center, where officials listed
him in guarded condition. The 12-year veteran of the department
already has undergone several operations, including reconstructive
surgery.</LD>
<LD>   Gaard's partner and passenger, Reserve Deputy Henry Gould, 41,
suffered a dislocated shoulder and a shattered knee. He was in stable
condition at Mission Hospital.</LD>
<TE>   Jon Fleischman, a Sheriff's Department spokesman, said the
accident occurred about 10 p.m. Saturday as Gaard and Gould were
investigating a drive-by shooting in San Clemente. No one was wounded
in the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The deputies were assigned to a K-9 unit when their patrol car
collided with a minivan in Dana Point. Fleischman said that Gaard
tried to veer away from the van before they hit.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the four occupants of the van suffered broken bones.</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff's patrol dog was unhurt.</TE>

<HD>Police Rough It Amid Affluence</HD>
<DH>Public safety: It's been a struggle to get Sausalito
residents to approve a new headquarters to replace rickety,
overcrowded trailers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VERONIQUE de TURENNE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>SAUSALITO</DL>
<LD>Plastic pink flamingos guard the Sausalito Police Department, this
upscale city's only trailer park. They add a touch of class to the
five rickety buildings perched on uncompacted landfill at the edge of
the San Francisco Bay.</LD>
<LD>   The trailers shimmy in high winds. Their hollow doors swing shut
unaided as the buildings sink and settle into the unstable ground.
Mold? Yes. Mice? You bet. An earthquake hazard? Absolutely. But
despite five years of fund-raising, planning and public meetings, a
new building for Sausalito's finest remains a tantalizing dream.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this year, Sausalito voters rejected plans for a
$7.8-million, 22,500-square-foot headquarters for the city's police
and firefighters. Too big and too much, opponents said. Too out of
character with the small city's quaint and artsy vibe.</LD>
<TE>   Testimony during a series of tense public hearings included advice
by a feng shui expert and earned Sausalito a spate of mocking
headlines in newspapers from USA Today to the New Delhi Times. Last
month, however, a steering committee of 32 residents met to start
planning from scratch. The group hopes to leave the bad feelings in
the past.</TE>
<TE>   "The vote against the safety building was very divisive for
Sausalito, but we hope that's behind us," said John Ferrell, a leader
of the opposition. "The good news is there were enough people who
cared about their town to fight City Hall and win, which was the real
story here. Of course, that's not as cute and clever as making it
about feng shui."</TE>
<TE>   City leaders find the fight neither cute nor clever. Planning for
the safety building began soon after a 1995 flood evicted the police
force from its home of 93 years. In five years, the city held 31
public meetings, lined up $2.3 million in private donations, sent out
thousands of informational fliers, hung banners across the proposed
building site and spent $273,000 on studies and architects.</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't until the city erected "story poles," a skeleton of
wood and netting that outlines the shape of a building, that
opponents took action. Upset at the size of the building, which
extended 242 feet and closed off a residential street, they sued the
city. Under a negotiated settlement, city leaders agreed to put the
matter of the new safety building to an advisory vote.</TE>
<TE>   Residents turned out in record numbers and voted down the proposed
building.</TE>
<TE>   "The residents of Sausalito are nothing if not passionate about
the quality of life in their community," City Manager Dana Whitson
said. "After the vote, the council dusted themselves off and decided
to get on with it, with a community-based planning process."</TE>
<TE>   That process, which city leaders said must be complete by
December, includes revisiting all phases of decision-making. Four
subcommittees of eight people each are devoted to choosing a building
site, funding, architecture and what the facilities should include.</TE>
<TE>   A quick tour of the existing police and fire facilities should
make planning easier.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters go to sleep each night in a brick building that could
come down around their heads. Their dorm is a single large room
filled with metal cots topped with sleeping bags.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like an orphanage," Whitson said. "All that's missing are
plates of gruel at the foot of each bed."</TE>
<TE>   The fire station, expanded three times in 60 years, includes part
of a gas station that was towed across the street and attached to the
main building. Cracked walls, rank carpets and unexpected steps up
and down between rooms give the place a Dickensian squalor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a challenging way to live and work," said Capt. Charlie
Casalnuovo, a 19-year veteran of the department, which includes 19
firefighters, paramedics and officers and an administrative aide.
"There's a lot of stuff we need, like a compressor room for the scuba
gear, a room for the medical gear, a place to wash our turn-out gear,
which this building was never meant to provide."</TE>
<TE>   The city's police force of 22 sworn officers and five support
staff fares no better.</TE>
<TE>   The Emergency Operations Center is a metal locker equipped with
two telephones, some manuals and a box of tools. The room it sits in
serves as squad room, briefing room, library, office, equipment room
and, when all five doors to the room are closed, as the place rape
victims are interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   Down the hall behind a hollow door is the armory, where weapons
and ammunition are stored. A ceiling tile with a smoke alarm attached
has fallen to the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "Oops," said Sgt. Scott Wyatt. "The way these buildings are put
together, a change in the air pressure blows the tiles off the
ceiling."</TE>
<TE>   Out back in a weedy lot sits the cargo container that serves as
the Police Department's evidence locker. Frigid in winter, sizzling
in summer, the double doors swing open to emit a complicated scent of
fungus, marijuana, old blood and sweaty clothes.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our cold storage," Wyatt said, and pointed to the type of
mini-fridge found in college dorm rooms. "It kind of puts us in a
tough spot when we try to recruit good people to work here."</TE>
<TE>   And to get good people to stay.</TE>
<TE>   "I have trouble looking our police officers and firefighters in
the eye, knowing they're dedicated to my safety and I can't do
anything to assure theirs," said J.R. Roberts, Sausalito's mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts said he's glad city residents took an interest in the
process, but wonders why they stepped in so late.</TE>
<TE>   "For a community in an affluent city like ours to have facilities
in this condition is a travesty--it puts our community at risk,"
Roberts said. "The steering committee has to do its work quickly and
well."</TE>
<TE>   And if December rolls around without a new plan in place?</TE>
<TE>   "Then the City Council will move forward, no matter what," Roberts
said. "Our lives and our safety depend on it."</TE>

<HD>9/11 Fervor, Fire Danger Make Fourth Even Riskier</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the aftermath of Sept. 11, many Americans are expected to
celebrate the Fourth of July with extra gusto this year by buying
fireworks and shooting them off.</LD>
<LD>   But the West is burning, and the bone-dry landscape of California
is as ripe as it ever has been for fires.</LD>
<LD>   So here in a state that writer Wallace Stegner described as "land
of little water--and big consequences," thoughts of a bottle-rocket's
red glare and fireworks bursting in air have communities from
Sacramento to San Diego on increased alert.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities are promising more patrols and less tolerance for
dangerous behavior. They are pleading with the public to attend
organized shows. Officials said they are walking a fine line, trying
to prevent risky behavior that could spark fires without
extinguishing the renewed sense of patriotism.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest danger lies in Southern California, where no end is in
sight to a dry spell, and fire season has arrived weeks ahead of
schedule, already consuming more than 75,000 acres and destroying
dozens of homes.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Fire Authority Chief Chip Prather has gone so far as
to ask the public not to buy or use even "safe and sane" legal
fireworks, a move that has ignited criticism among charities that
benefit from the sales.</TE>
<TE>   Prather and his peers say the stakes are too high and they are
taking no chances.</TE>
<TE>   "Our current drought situation is so dangerous that any
nonprofessional discharge of fireworks runs the risk of causing a
tragedy of major proportions," the chief said.</TE>
<TE>   With forest fires in Arizona and Colorado in mind, Prather added:
"Anyone who thinks those kinds of fires can't occur here is wrong.
This area is very vulnerable to a widespread fire that could destroy
property and homes and even cost lives."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   State's Laws Are Tough</TE>
<TE>   Although it is not among the eight states that outlaw all
fireworks, California ranks as one of the nation's tougher
regulators. The state is among 19 that allow only "safe and sane"
devices, including party-poppers and cone fountains. Even these are
prohibited in more than half of California's 476 cities. Statewide,
more than 20 types of fireworks are banned, including firecrackers,
bottle rockets, M-80s and large sparklers.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, anything is illegal if it flies through the air,
scurries on the ground or explodes--in other words, if it's out of
control," said Karen Terrill, spokeswoman for the state Fire Marshal.
"These things are not toys. They burn people's houses down, they set
the wild lands on fire, and they cause a lot of injury."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, fireworks caused 286 fires, $451,000 in damages and 213
injuries in California, according to the Fire Marshal's office.
Terrill said the numbers have dropped gradually since 1996, when
nearly 1,000 fires caused $9.2 million in damages.</TE>
<TE>   This year could reverse the trend, and not just because of dry
conditions. The National Council on Fireworks Safety reports that
sales and use of fireworks could reach record levels as Americans
unite after the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We know this year, based on what we've heard from dealers in the
industry, that sales are brisk," said council spokeswoman Ann
Crampton. "If you're choosing to celebrate that way, you need to take
extra care."</TE>
<TE>   Sales booths opened Friday in cities across Southern California
where "safe and sane" fireworks are allowed, providing cash for the
charities and service groups that operate them. Efforts by Prather
and other authorities to discourage or ban these sales outright have
been rebuffed by opponents, who argued that the ban would be
ineffective and hurt groups with noble causes.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities agree they cannot stop people who want to shoot off
their own fireworks from getting them from counties or states where
they are legal, or smuggling them from Mexico. And this year, they
also know that by the time they catch someone in the act, it may be
too late.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement is beefing up most in cities where backyards bump
up against or blend in with the back country. It's here where one
wind-borne ember could ignite a deadly blaze.</TE>
<TE>   In many of these communities, officials are stepping up patrols,
educating the public through fliers, direct mail and road signs, and
asking citizens to help by looking out more than usual for
mischievous behavior and fires.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, where about half the cities can sell
approved fireworks, extra patrols are designated for fire-prone areas
like Malibu, the scene of devastating brush fires in 1993 and 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Lynn Mohr, who works in Malibu, remembers watching homes
burn.</TE>
<TE>   "There's brush everywhere here. If it caught on fire, the
hillsides will be ablaze," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Laguna Beach, where a 1993 canyon fire destroyed 450 homes and
caused more than $500 million in damage, 13 additional firefighters
and two additional engine companies will be on hand. More signs than
usual have been posted in the city and at beaches to remind residents
and visitors that fireworks are banned.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters Get Ready</TE>
<TE>   To shore up coverage across Orange County, the Fire Authority's
seven investigators will be on duty, and all 150 units will be on
patrol at least a portion of the day. Two helicopters will be
standing by, and an extra strike team with five engines and battalion
chief will be available for any calls.</TE>
<TE>   Rangers at state parks and national forests are also gearing up
for a busy holiday, knowing that there are always problems, even when
visitors follow the rules. Dave Reider, regional spokesman for the
U.S. Forest Service, warned that even the heat from a car engine can
spark a disaster.</TE>
<TE>   "You could spit on a flat rock and start a fire," Reider said,
using a firefighters' adage. "We're always concerned about the Fourth
of July. But the situation in Southern California is extremely
dangerous this year. The last thing we need is more human-caused
fires."</TE>
<TE>   For those caught with fireworks, the penalties are getting
stiffer.</TE>
<TE>   In Northern California, Sacramento and Placer counties will impose
their "No More Mr. Nice Guy" policy for a third straight year. Under
these guidelines, considered among the toughest in the state, anyone
caught using or possessing illegal fireworks is subject to up to a
year in jail and a $5,000 fine. If a child is around, child
endangerment charges will also be filed, and could lead to a minimum
of 45 days in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, citations typically draw fines of up to $500 and a year
in jail, but in many cases are dropped in favor of warnings. But Ray
Rodriguez, Los Angeles County fire inspector, said "things are so hot
right now, I don't know how nice a deputy or a police officer is
going to be."</TE>
<TE>   In Montebello, 12-year-old David Veiga promised to be safe as he
arrived at a fireworks booth with an adult. Veiga said he always is
supervised by adults, keeps a bucket of water nearby, uses only legal
fireworks and lights them with special long matchsticks called
"punks."</TE>
<TE>   But the thought of outlawing fireworks upsets him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be very, very mad. It would be unfair," he says. "It's the
Fourth of July; everybody wants to have fun."</TE>

<HD>3 Golden Eagles Fly Circles Around Capture Team</HD>
<DH>Nature: Removal of the nonnative predators that prey on the
foxes of Santa Cruz Island is stymied by fog and by the evasive
maneuvers of increasingly wily birds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Heavy fog and some nifty flying helped the last three golden eagles
on Santa Cruz Island foil an intense air and land campaign by
wildlife managers to remove them from Channel Islands National Park.</LD>
<LD>   The fox-eating eagles outfoxed pursuers in a helicopter by diving
into fog banks, ducking under trees and zipping below jagged
ridgelines. The two-week effort ended last week with the eagles still
free and scientists pondering their next move.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't have a next plan right now," said Brian Latta, a
biologist from the UC Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group who
has spent three years capturing golden eagles on the island. "We are
thinking about anything that might work."</LD>
<TE>   Removing the eagles, powerful predators not native to the islands,
is vital to the park's plan to release endangered island foxes this
October. In the past, the eagles ate foxes to the brink of extinction
until most of the foxes were put in kennels, awaiting the eagles'
departure.</TE>
<TE>   There are now 91 foxes living in captivity on Santa Cruz, Santa
Rosa and San Miguel islands, and the eagles have instead taken to
eating feral piglets.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1999, biologists have removed 22 golden eagles from
65,000-acre Santa Cruz Island, using folding bow nets baited with pig
carcasses and hidden in the ground.</TE>
<TE>   When the eagle steps on the net, the trap snaps shut. Captured
birds are fitted with radio transmitters, driven some 800 miles to
Goose Lake in far northeastern California and released. None have
returned.</TE>
<TE>   But nabbing the wily birds has proved challenging, with the
remaining three wise to mistakes made by their captured comrades.
They don't fall for the bow nets anymore, and they elude helicopters
by disappearing into fog or hiding in the trees.</TE>
<TE>   "In 2000, we caught 11 eagles in four months; last year we caught
five in a year," Latta said. "Each successive generation gets harder
to catch."</TE>
<TE>   The latest effort was done with near military precision. The
island was blanketed by 18 to 20 spotters from almost every branch of
the National Park Service.</TE>
<TE>   Carrying binoculars and radios, they set off at 6 a.m. each day
and, stationed on mountains and promontories, watched the skies until
6 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "You would tend to see them soaring along ridge tops," said
spotter Kate Faulkner, head of natural resource planning for the
park. "You didn't get a lot of time to see the bird as it moved
through your area."</TE>
<TE>   Once a bird was seen, its position was called in to a command post
where a helicopter pilot, a biologist and a net gunner were standing
by. Within five minutes, they were in the sky chasing the eagle.</TE>
<TE>   When the bird tired and landed, the helicopter hovered over it and
a crew member would try to fire a net from what resembled a modified
shotgun. The net entangles the bird, and Latta takes it from there.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the 'mugger,' the guy who gets the bird," he said. "You put a
hood on them, which calms them immediately, then wrap up the feet.
They are so big you can cradle them in your arms."</TE>
<TE>   Golden eagles can stand 3 feet high with wings stretching 8 feet
across.</TE>
<TE>   Net guns were first used to capture golden eagles in the open
grasslands of Wyoming, but this is their first application west of
the Rockies, park officials said. The rugged island terrain,
unpredictable weather and numerous trees have proved formidable
obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   In one case, a golden eagle landed five times but repeatedly
eluded capture by scampering under a tree and hiding near a cliff
where it couldn't be safely netted.</TE>
<TE>   Rhonda Brooks, who managed the recent project for the park
service, said foggy weather reduced flying time to about four hours a
day and high winds cut the effectiveness of net guns.</TE>
<TE>   "In order to be successful we need to have a lot of things going
our way," she said. "We have given chase twice now with two different
birds, but the areas weren't safe or practical to fire a net gun.
There isn't much that has been written on this subject. In a way, we
are writing the book on this."</TE>
<TE>   Removing the eagles is part of the $5-million island restoration
that seeks to eliminate nonnative species of plants and animals--such
as golden eagles, feral pigs and wild fennel--while restoring
original inhabitants, including the island fox and bald eagle. Four
bald eagles, which don't eat island foxes, were released on Santa
Cruz Island on June 25, and eight more will be freed in August.</TE>
<TE>   Faulkner said the foxes have bred so much that if they are not
released this fall, the park will have to build additional pens. She
also worries that keeping the animals in kennels heightens the risk
of disease or a fire that could wipe out an entire population.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important that we get them back into the wild as soon as
possible," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Several new methods to capture eagles are being reviewed,
including faster, more powerful helicopters that can maneuver in
tight spots. The hunt may be delayed until fog clears out in the
fall.</TE>
<TE>   Biologists said tranquilizer darts wouldn't work because of the
bird's thick feathers. Also, even if the drug penetrates the feathers
it would take five or six minutes to work.</TE>
<TE>   "The bird could fall out of the sky like a stone and die," Latta

<TE>   Killing the birds is, so far, out of the question.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no talk of lethal means," said Tom Dore, park spokesman.
"These are California birds and we want to do everything we can to
protect them. We have way too many options. Yes, it will cost more
money, but it's worth it."</TE>

<LD>A suspected drunk driver contributed to a chain of crashes Saturday
night on the Antelope Valley Freeway that injured several people,
including an off-duty LAPD officer who had stopped to help,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   About 11:35 p.m., the off-duty officer pulled over in his patrol
car to assist a 43-year-old Redondo Beach man whose car had struck a
concrete divider on the freeway south of San Fernando Road, the
California Highway Patrol said.</LD>
<LD>   A 34-year-old Tehachapi man failed to notice the accident and hit
the patrol car and three other vehicles. The officer, who was not
identified, suffered critical injuries and was taken to Providence
Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills. Six other people suffered
less severe injuries.</LD>
<TE>   The driver of the vehicle that initially spun out of control was
arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol and
causing injuries. His name was not released.</TE>

<HD>Hospital Linked to Two Deaths</HD>
<DH>Health: Legionnaires' kills patients at Good Samaritan.
Seven more become ill at the facility, which says outbreak has been
contained.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nine people have become ill since January, including two who later
died, with Legionnaires' disease acquired at Good Samaritan Hospital
in downtown Los Angeles, county health officials confirmed Sunday
night.</LD>
<LD>   One patient, a 55-year-old man, died June 15, said Dr. David
Dassey, deputy chief of acute communicable disease control for the
Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. The man, who was
admitted May 25, underwent several heart procedures, including bypass
surgery, while in the hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Details on the other patient who died were not available. It is
not clear whether the patients' previous medical conditions
contributed to their deaths.</LD>
<TE>   County health officials believe the patients became sick with the
respiratory infection because of the hospital's water system, which
contained the bacterium Legionella pneumophila. All of the sick had
undergone cardiac procedures at the hospital that ranged from
insertion of a temporary pacemaker to coronary artery bypass surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Eight of the nine also spent time on the same floor in the
hospital's main building, said Dr. Laurene Mascola, chief of acute
communicable disease control for the county. Dassey said all nine had
spent time there.</TE>
<TE>   "These are not persons who had specific defects in their
immunological systems, such as AIDS or chemotherapy, which would have
ablated their ability to fight infection," Dassey said. "It's very
interesting and doesn't make sense."</TE>
<TE>   Hospital and county officials believe the outbreak has been
contained, in part because of recommendations that all patients be
served bottled water, instead of tap water. The hospital also has
changed all shower heads and has performed a super-heated water flush
of its plumbing system.</TE>
<TE>   For a time, patients also were advised not to take showers because
they could breathe in the Legionella bacterium through the shower
mist, county officials said. In addition to the nine patients who
became ill at the hospital, Good Samaritan said county testing has
shown that some patients were exposed to the Legionella bacterium in
the community. In response, the 408-bed hospital said it is screening
all patients for pneumonia.</TE>
<TE>   "Through our work with the public health department and outside
certified testing facilities, at this time we have no evidence of
ongoing transmission of Legionella at Good Samaritan Hospital,"
President and Chief Executive Andrew Leeka said in a written
statement. "We have been assured by the public health department that
the hospital has taken all appropriate recognized measures to halt
further appearances of the bacteria."</TE>
<TE>   The general public is not at risk, Mascola said, because the
disease is not passed from person to person. She praised the
hospital's response, saying that employees and patients are probably
at no greater risk of being exposed to the bacterium at the hospital
than at home.</TE>
<TE>   The county did not intend to publicize the illnesses or deaths but
did confirm them after contacted by a reporter.</TE>
<TE>   Good Samaritan became aware of the first potential Legionnaires'
case acquired at the hospital in January, Mascola said.</TE>
<TE>   Laboratory tests confirmed the illness several weeks later, and it
was then reported to the health department in late February or early
March. Around that time, a second case was identified, Mascola said.</TE>
<TE>   Legionnaires' disease affects 8,000 to 18,000 people per year.
Most cases are acquired in the home or community, not in health-care
facilities. The disease is fatal in 5% to 30% of cases, according to
the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities in southeastern Pennsylvania are investigating an
outbreak of Legionnaires' at a nursing home there that struck 12
people, including two who have died.</TE>
<TE>   The last large cluster of Legionnaires' in Los Angeles County
occurred in late 1997 when eight cases were identified near a movie
studio in Culver City. Health officials determined that the cases did
not originate in a hospital or other health facility, but they were
unable to pinpoint the exact cause, Dassey said. All of the sick
patients lived or worked within blocks of one another.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, Legionnaires' outbreaks in the county were linked to at
least seven deaths. One outbreak at the Westwood Horizons retirement
home in West Los Angeles resulted in four deaths. A second at UCLA
Medical Center resulted in eight cases, including three deaths of
patients who were already gravely ill.</TE>
<TE>   Legionnaires' took its name in 1976 when an outbreak of pneumonia
afflicted people attending an American Legion convention in
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   All told, 29 people died and 221 more became sick. Symptoms of the
disease include fever, chills and a cough. Some patients also have
muscle aches, headache, fatigue, loss of appetite and sometimes
diarrhea.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, it takes two to 10 days between a person's exposure to
the Legionella bacteria and the onset of symptoms. Special tests are
required to confirm the diagnosis and distinguish the illness from
other forms of pneumonia.</TE>
<TE>   Legionnaires' often affects middle-age and older people,
especially those who smoke cigarettes or have chronic lung disease.
People with suppressed immune systems also are at risk.</TE>
<TE>   The bacterium is present naturally in the environment and can be
found in hot tubs, water tanks, humidifiers, cooling towers and
air-conditioning systems.</TE>
<TE>   Hospitals and research centers that are contaminated with the
bacterium often use a chlorine solution to kill it. Raising the
temperature of water heaters also affects the germ's ability to
multiply.</TE>
<TE>   If caught early, Legionnaires' is treatable with the antibiotic
Erythromycin. Sometimes, a second drug, Rifampin, is used.</TE>

<HD>Simon's Numbers Way Up--the Number of Advisors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATT MORRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is the Bill Simon campaign becoming California's political Million
Man March?</LD>
<LD>   In recent weeks, the campaign has added to its original stalwarts
and true believers some of the people from the Dick Riordan and Bill
Jones campaigns--as a peacemaking gesture--and the designated hitters
who've arrived from the White House, eager to have California in a
GOP pocket again.</LD>
<LD>   And now the campaign is reaching back to the Reagan
administration--Gov. Reagan--with the addition of Lyn Nofziger, a
World War II veteran and a first-string Reagan loyalist whose recent
public profile involved his support for the medical use of marijuana,
a position reached after the pain of his daughter's ultimately fatal
fight with cancer was relieved by marijuana.</LD>
<TE>   Also among the new names on the organizational chart: John
Peschong, a longtime California GOP power ranger and ally of George
W. Bush's Golden State main man, Gerald Parsky; former Gov. Pete
Wilson; and Ed Rollins, who most recently advised Jones'
gubernatorial campaign, and before that, ran former congressman
Michael Huffington's self-destruct campaign for Senate and served as
an unpaid advisor to Bob Dole's presidential campaign. Rollins
resigned from the Dole effort after a San Francisco political roast
for Willie Brown at which he referred to two Jewish congressmen as
"Hymie boys."</TE>
<TE>   Also getting their boarding passes: four new assistant campaign
managers, a press operations director and a deputy press secretary.</TE>
<TE>   All this the Davis campaign eagerly seized upon. "Does it occur to
anyone else," gloated Davis campaign-ops commander Garry South, "that
he may now have more campaign employees than he has donors?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Elective Surgery</TE>
<TE>   Summertime, and Los Angeles County's health-care system is flat
broke.</TE>
<TE>   Not this summer--although it's certainly true again--but the
summer of the year 2000, when L.A. County's leadership went, begging
bowl in hand, to the White House to get help in scraping together
enough dough to keep the hospital and clinic doors open.</TE>
<TE>   It had been President Clinton's emergency "this is the last you'll
get from me" billion-dollar bailout in 1995 that kept L.A. County
government solvent (and may have kept its leaders employed).</TE>
<TE>   But in 2000, the billion was running out and L.A. was back for
more. The man standing in the doorway of the Roosevelt Room: Chris
Jennings, Clinton's health-care policy advisor. As one Angeleno
recalled it, Jennings informed the county that its health-care
programs hadn't yet tightened their belts and didn't deserve another
bailout. Clinton-like, a second bailout did indeed materialize
nonetheless, but with the proviso that the money would be less every
year, meaning that by 2002, the county would have to cut
programs--which brings us up to the here and now.</TE>
<TE>   Today, George W. Bush is the name on the White House mailbox, and
Chris Jennings is 3,000 miles from D.C.--working for the Service
Employees International Union Local 660, the SEIU, which represents
the 5,000 Health Department workers who are about to be laid off in
the cuts supervisors approved last week.</TE>
<TE>   That is how Jennings, who once told the county it had to make
cuts, came to be standing on the steps of the Hall of Administration
urging the supes not to make some of the same cuts.</TE>
<TE>   How can this be? Jennings said the Clinton administration had not
really wanted the county to cut health care when it left it with an
$800-million hole in its budget. "It does not mean you have to move
immediately and immediately take drastic actions to reduce health
care," Jennings said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   End of Story</TE>
<TE>   Many politicians tend to think of the press as a criminal class,
but L.A.'s city attorney, Rocky Delgadillo, may have had better
reason than most last week.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo was waiting his turn to present an award at the L.A.
Press Club's annual awards dinner at Le Meridien hotel in Beverly
Hills when a couple of members of the Canoga Park Alabama gang walked
up to Delgadillo at his table.</TE>
<TE>   Six teenagers serving at Camp Gonzales for juveniles were invited
to the dinner by their mentors, some of whom work for the L.A. Daily
Journal and advise the teenagers on their twice-monthly camp
newspaper, Behind the Walls. Kid advocates Carol Biondi and Jo
Kaplan, who support the camp's mentoring program, paid for the six to
go to the dinner, right down to their new suits.</TE>
<TE>   The pair introduced themselves to Delgadillo and told him they'd
like to be taken off the list of 500-some gangbangers put under
curfew and injunction earlier this year in the west San Fernando
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Are you still in the gang? Delgadillo asked.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Then I'm not taking you off, he responded.</TE>
<TE>   The pair suggested that if Delgadillo just gave them their little
peace of Valley turf to run, there'd be more than a little peace;
they don't hurt other people, just other gangs, was their argument.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo countered that they should quit the gang, get jobs and
he'd take off the injunction. Sure, they want jobs, absolutely, but
they told him they don't want to leave the gang.</TE>
<TE>   One also complained to Delgadillo of being hassled by cops because
of the way he dresses. No, Delgadillo countered, it's because of the
giant "CPA" tattoo on your neck.</TE>
<TE>   One of their volunteer mentors, the Daily Journal's Katrina Dewey,
said the guys were just reporting on a story for their paper. The 1st
Amendment makes for strange bedfellows.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Foreign Entanglements</TE>
<TE>   For a time he was considered to be the heir apparent to Orange
County's then-sheriff, Brad Gates. But by the late 1990s, Assistant
Sheriff Dennis LaDucer had cost the county nearly a million dollars
to settle three of five sexual harassment suits filed by women in the
Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   LaDucer was fired in 1997, and wound up with a big job in Bosnia,
as deputy commissioner on the International Police Task Force.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the head of the U.N. human rights office in Bosnia told a
tribunal in England last week that LaDucer had been spotted in one of
Bosnia's most notorious brothels.</TE>
<TE>   A U.N. spokesman told The Times that a prostitute said she saw
LaDucer in the bar of a strip club/brothel, but "his presence was not
corroborated," and he was allowed to finish out his contract, which
ended last November.</TE>
<TE>   Madeleine Rees, who heads the U.N.'s human rights office in
Bosnia, told the tribunal last week that the prostitute had
identified LaDucer. The British employment tribunal was hearing a
case brought by a former U.N. police officer, a woman who claims that
she was fired after accusing colleagues of trafficking in Bosnian
women as sex slaves, and that 70% of the profits of Bosnia's brothels
came from men on the international task force.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. spokesman said 15 Americans working for the agency have
been shipped home for patronizing such establishments; sex
trafficking is such a problem in Bosnia that the U.N. has a
zero-tolerance policy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * Moderate Republican Brooks Firestone's fourth annual state
Republican Party alumni gathering at his Los Olivos ranch (alternate
name, "Let's Not Kill Each Other This Election") drew Bill Simon as
well as 2004 GOP Senate hopefuls Mary Bono and Doug Ose, both members
of Congress. The event also served up Danish pastries from nearby
Solvang and, natch, wine from the Firestone vineyards.</TE>
<TE>   * You read here last week that Ron Hartwig, who was manager of
Richard Riordan's failed gubernatorial campaign, gave $1,000 to Gray
Davis' campaign; Hartwig also points out that he gave $1,000 to Bill
Simon's campaign, which explains why he's big in PR.</TE>
<TE>   * Seen at Arianna Huffington's Brentwood home, at a launching
party for the book "50 Ways to Save Our Children" by Cheryl Saban,
wife of mega-media-mogul Haim Saban, was a cluster of gal-cabal power
rangers: L.A. City Councilwoman Wendy Greuel, L.A.'s Planned
Parenthood president Nancy Sasaki, political top ops Donna Bojarsky,
and L.A. school board member Caprice Young.</TE>
<TE>   * With a calendar full of feel-good events, like the
Multi-Cultural Festival 2002 in Westminster Sunday and Congress'
Horizon Award last week for working with young people, Arnold
Schwarzenegger looks more and more like a candidate for--something.</TE>
<TE>   * Rob Reiner, the father of the Prop. 10 four-bits-a-pack tobacco
tax and head of the California Children and Families Commission, let
it be known in a Town Hall speech last week that--even as L.A.
County's health-care system falters--work is underway to use Prop. 10
dollars "to deliver health care for every child age 0 to 5 in Los
Angeles County and ... we're going to get the job done."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   "You can actually bureaucratize a funeral procession? Never ceases
to amaze me...."</TE>
<TE>   --State Sen. Tom McClintock, the Thousand Oaks Republican,
commenting during a hearing on a bill by Assembly member Joe
Canciamilla--a Martinez Democrat whose family is in the mortuary
business--that would regulate funeral processions, some of which
evidently get unwieldy on public highways.</TE>

<HD>Year-Old Law Assists Many Drug Abusers</HD>
<DH>Treatment: Proposition 36 helps nonviolent defendants, but
lack of money is a problem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A California law designed to provide nonviolent drug offenders with
treatment rather than putting them behind bars has expanded
rehabilitation services and helped thousands of people, state
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   But many of these defendants are severely addicted or have mental
problems and cannot be adequately treated in regular rehabilitation
programs, the officials also said. In addition, some officials fear
that the current level of state funding will not be sufficient to
continue providing intensive treatment.</LD>
<LD>   Enacted one year ago today, voter-approved Proposition 36 requires
that those convicted of possession, use or transportation of drugs
for personal use be offered treatment rather than jail sentences.</LD>
<TE>   After the first six months of the program, at least 12,000
defendants were in treatment, officials said. Statistics are not yet
available for the full year.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very pleased that we have significant numbers of people
that are in treatment," said Del Sayles-Owen, deputy director of the
California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated one-third of the defendants referred for treatment,
however, either failed to show up or dropped out during the first six
months the law was in effect.</TE>
<TE>   Sayles-Owen said that some defendants do not succeed because they
don't have transportation. Others lack motivation, judges and drug
counselors said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are squandering a lot of resources on people who are not ready
for treatment," said Judge Michael A. Tynan of Los Angeles County
Superior Court. "It's distressing."</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, about half of the 7,500 defendants referred for
help were still in treatment by the end of May, Tynan said. Part of
the problem, he said, is that sanctions are not strict enough,
allowing defendants three chances to succeed before they face jail.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Stillwell, executive director of the IMPACT drug treatment
center in Pasadena, said fewer people are no-shows now than in the
first few months. "I'm not ready to give it an A or anything, but I
think we're on the right track."</TE>
<TE>   Kern County has come up with a new way to deal with retention,
deciding that an obvious solution would be to increase supervision.
Unable to afford more probation officers, the county hired interns
seeking certification as alcohol and drug counselors.</TE>
<TE>   A major challenge is the number of participants who suffer from
depression or severe bipolar disorder. "We're not sophisticated
psychiatric units," Stillwell said. "The average drug counselor is
just not equipped educationally to handle somebody who might be
suicidal."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA researchers have started a five-year evaluation of
Proposition 36 and published an article this spring that identified
several problems. In addition to the number of people not showing up
for treatment, it cited a large number of high-need cases and
insufficient future funding.</TE>
<TE>   Among many county officials who direct the programs under
Proposition 36, money is the top concern.</TE>
<TE>   The state allocated $60 million for start-up costs and $120
million for the year just ending. Though proponents say no one has
been denied treatment for lack of funds, county directors say they
have had to spend more money than anticipated on residential
treatment for severely addicted offenders.</TE>
<TE>   Though the original law did not set aside money for urine tests,
new legislation has provided $8.4 million for that purpose.</TE>
<TE>   The funding shortage affects both large and small counties.</TE>
<TE>   Butte County, for example, projected that there would be 600
participants. Even though only about 350 people have been sentenced
there under Proposition 36, the county has little room for expansion,
said Bradford Luz, the county's alcohol and drug administrator.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll have to get more creative about how we're using resources,"
Luz said.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 36 was designed to decrease the prison population,
save taxpayer money and reduce addiction rates.</TE>
<TE>   In 12 months, the number of convicts in state prison has decreased
by 3,272 to 158,089.</TE>
<TE>   "What we have seen is a dip in our inmate population as some
parolees are referred for Proposition 36, as opposed to being
re-incarcerated," said Russ Heimerich, spokesman for the California
Department of Corrections.</TE>
<TE>   But he said the exact effects of Proposition 36 could not be
quantified.</TE>
<TE>   The Drug Policy Alliance, which championed the law and is tracking
its progress, has reported that the number of treatment programs
jumped by 68% from 1,061 to 1,567 this year, and that there are 3,204
more residential beds.</TE>
<TE>   But alliance officials noted that some treatment programs do not
adequately address cultural, language and gender needs.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clara University School of Law professor Gerald Uelman said
that, despite the concerns, early results show that Proposition 36
appears to be doing what it was designed to do. "We've gotten a lot
more people into treatment, and I think we're going to save a ton of
taxpayer money," Uelman said. "What concerns me is whether we are
going to keep getting the funding we need."</TE>

<HD>Housing Plans Nourish Dream for Downtown</HD>
<DH>South Park: Some hope proposed 2,600-unit development will
help revitalize the area.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From the 32nd-floor restaurant atop the Transamerica Center, the city
blocks below look gritty and empty. But interspersed among the
abandoned warehouses, boarded-up shops and litter-strewn alleys are
the Palm restaurant, affordable housing, new lofts starting at
$300,000 and other pockets of revitalization.</LD>
<LD>   This neighborhood, part of an area known as South Park, has been
in the news most prominently as the proposed site of a football
stadium. However, since billionaire Philip Anschutz and his allies
abandoned their stadium dreams, another developer has proposed
building 2,600 residences there.</LD>
<LD>   Among the people who live, work or go to school in the
area--bounded roughly by 8th Street on the north, the Santa Monica
Freeway on the south, Figueroa Street on the west and Main Street on
the east--the response is as varied as the blocks themselves.</LD>
<TE>   Yasmine Hickman, who finished her first year at the Fashion
Institute of Design and Merchandising in South Park, said she would
never live in the area. "There's not really anything to do here," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   The 19-year-old Torrance resident said classmates from the East
Coast, expecting sunny, star-studded Los Angeles, were sorely
disappointed with their nearby student housing.</TE>
<TE>   And there's the safety factor. During the day, Hickman said, she
feels comfortable. "But when I took night classes, I was scared to
walk to my car."</TE>
<TE>   But others say the area has become much safer in recent years,
especially since Staples Center opened. "A long time ago, this was a
really, really dangerous place," said Yong Hwang, residential manager
at the Hope Village development. "It is upgrading. It's not dangerous
like before."</TE>
<TE>   She welcomes the proposed residential development, saying it will
help bring new energy to the area. As for whether people will live
there, she says Hope Village is incontrovertible proof.</TE>
<TE>   The building provides housing to 66 tenants. When it opened in
April 2001, 3,000 people applied for apartments. A three-bedroom unit
rents for about $750 a month, and there is a waiting list to move in.</TE>
<TE>   Hwang said the keys to creating a vibrant residential hub are a
grocery store, which is in the works, and parking.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Misa has lived at the Morrison Hotel, where the Doors shot the
cover photo for their 1970 album of the same name, for three years.
More resident-serving businesses are sorely needed, he agreed.</TE>
<TE>   Withing walking distance, there is little that you would find in a
normal residential neighborhood save a Bank of America and a Texaco
gas station. Aside from Hope Village, a handful of wholesalers, the
rundown Morrison Hotel and a "hostess-dancing" club, much of the area
is covered with abandoned warehouses, boarded-up stores and empty
parking lots that are full only during Staples events.</TE>
<TE>   Most businesses in the area are clustered near Staples and the
Transamerica Center. Near the sports and concert arena, there are the
new lofts that start at $300,000 and the pricey Palm steakhouse.
Serving the people who work in the skyscraper, there's a dry cleaner,
a travel agency, a taco stand, a burger joint and a Windows
restaurant--another upscale steakhouse that offers a stunning view of
the city.</TE>
<TE>   Civic leaders say these scattered properties could herald the
start of a renaissance, similar to the transformation that took place
in and around downtown San Diego's Gaslamp District.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an area in transition. That's the good news," said Carol
Schatz, president of the Central City Assn., downtown's leading
business advocacy group. "The fact that it's moving in the direction
of greater investment opportunities and rising property values is
extremely important. We need that."</TE>
<TE>   The organization hasn't taken a position on the proposed housing
development yet, but Schatz said housing for different income levels
is key to helping lure large companies into downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Jaime Ortiz, who works at Joe's Liquor, said an infusion of new
residents would bring new customers into the store, which is guarded
by a rusty metal security fence.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great idea," he said. But he's skeptical that the proposal
will become reality.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with Forest City Inc., the developer, have stressed that
their proposal is preliminary. The housing, both market-rate and
affordable, would be built on land stretching from Olympic Boulevard
to Pico Boulevard and from Flower Street to Hill Street.</TE>
<TE>   This area, which includes the 16 acres where Anschutz wanted to
build the stadium, is part of an 879-acre redevelopment zone created
by the Los Angeles City Council in May. The special district was set
up to allow the Community Redevelopment Agency to funnel new property
tax funds back into the area, to condemn and acquire land, and to
relocate residents and businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed development would help meet one of the agency's
primary goals: creating as many as 12,900 homes, one-quarter of which
would be deemed affordable, over the next 30 to 45 years.</TE>
<TE>   Forest City officials have said it will be more than a year--and
possibly several years--before the company can break ground on the
project, if it is approved. The company hopes to purchase some of the
parcels for the proposed development with the help of the CRA, which
has the ability to acquire land through the use of eminent domain.</TE>
<TE>   That's what worries Nelson Guzman, who was taking orders during a
brisk lunch rush at Los Molcajetes, a Salvadoran restaurant at Pico
Boulevard and Hope Street. His father opened the business more than
two decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't want them to do anything around here, because of
my father's business--we would have to leave," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Another man, who asked that his name not be used for fear of
reprisal, said razing some of the rundown buildings in the area that
are infested with cockroaches and rats and that attract drug users
would greatly improve the neighborhood. He has lived in a one-room
apartment at the Morrison Hotel with his wife and two children for
five years. "Even if I can't afford it, it's an excellent idea," he
said about plans for new housing.</TE>
<TE>   Rod Scott, who was delivering FedEx packages Friday afternoon on
Hope, said that if public money is involved, all the new housing
should be affordable.</TE>
<TE>   Scanning rows of abandoned buildings, he said, "In this area, I
would think so."</TE>

<HD>CHP Is Keeping a Low Profile on Highways</HD>
<DH>Safety: Sporty pursuit vehicles, with none of the standard
identifying marks, are intended to stem the tide of crashes involving
trucks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A stealthy surprise is in store for scofflaw truck drivers and others
who think they can avoid a ticket by spotting the distinctive
silhouette of a California Highway Patrol cruiser in the rearview
mirror and adjusting their driving accordingly.</LD>
<LD>   A fleet of sleek, low-slung and very fast white Chevrolet Camaros
is being put into traffic duty throughout the state as the CHP steps
up its fight against truck-involved collisions.</LD>
<LD>   In a shift from the familiar full-size black-and-white Ford sedans
with their conspicuous roof-mounted red-and-blue light bars, the
Camaros are intended to blend seamlessly into traffic and become
virtually impossible to detect from the elevated cab of a big rig or
in the rearview mirror of a passenger car.</LD>
<TE>   About 60 Camaros are being assigned to traffic duty. They are
unmarked, except for the CHP name and logo on the doors. No shotgun
is visible. The standard police push-bar bumper is gone.</TE>
<TE>   Gone, too, is the easily recognized light bar, which resembles a
ski rack and advertises that a CHP vehicle is in the vicinity.
Instead, the Camaros are fitted with extraordinarily low-profile
light bars that are only 2 inches high and all but impossible to
spot, even from a few feet way.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to keep folks off-guard a little bit," said CHP
Commissioner D.O. "Spike" Helmick. "We want them to think there may
be an officer behind them and slow down."</TE>
<TE>   The CHP said four of the new cars are planned for its Los Angeles
area offices. Nine are scheduled for San Bernardino, five for San
Diego and five for the Central Coast. The others are assigned to the
San Joaquin Valley and Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   The chief targets will be operators of 18-wheelers and other big
trucks and passenger car motorists whose aggressive driving
jeopardizes safety and threatens to cause truck crashes.</TE>
<TE>   In spite of periodic crackdowns on truckers under Helmick, the CHP
struggles to make a dramatic breakthrough in curbing such collisions.
A frustrated Helmick is hoping the Camaros may be the answer.</TE>
<TE>   "We've tried everything we know to get people to drive safer," he
said. "Maybe this is a tool that will get some attention."</TE>
<TE>   The California Trucking Assn., a trade organization of 2,500
member companies, is a strong supporter of the CHP's efforts to make
California safe from errant truck drivers. It favors the patrol's new
stealth campaign too.</TE>
<TE>   "The highly visible marked car is a deterrent in some
circumstances," said a spokesman, Warren Hayworth. But, he said, the
new stealth cars are "appropriate to get those who are very wary but
will misbehave when they think they're not being watched."</TE>
<TE>   Along an especially deadly stretch of Interstate 5 between
Stockton and Woodland, where truck crashes have become almost
routine, CHP officers with four Camaros have been trying new
enforcement tactics.</TE>
<TE>   They coordinate their operations with CHP planes and helicopters
overhead and with standard Ford police cars on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   The team began its work in April and has not yet compiled enough
results to draw firm conclusions. But CHP Capt. Doug Galbraith said,
"This is the edge that we think will make the difference."</TE>
<TE>   Since the late 1970s, the CHP has tried a variety of barely marked
vehicles, including Camaros and Mustangs, for special enforcement
assignments.</TE>
<TE>   But the Ford Crown Victoria sedan, painted white and a variety of
pastel colors, has been the car of choice.</TE>
<TE>   Helmick, noting that other states have adopted the Camaro for
patrol work, said the CHP wanted a car that was especially nimble,
offered a relatively large driver compartment, and was very fast.
Each car costs $25,479. This is the final year for production of this
model.</TE>
<TE>   Chevrolet reported the Camaro's top speed at 159 mph, but the CHP
was more interested in its acceleration abilities. From a standing
start, the Camaro can reach 60 mph in 5.6 seconds, the CHP said.</TE>
<TE>   Helmick noted that some Camaros already are seeing duty and that
the public's response has been favorable.</TE>
<TE>   "They like the concept," he said. "Citizens have been complaining
about trucks and [truck drivers] have been complaining about being
cut off by cars."</TE>
<TE>   Officer Kevin Pierce of Sacramento, one of the first officers to
try out the new vehicles, said the motorists most surprised when he
pulls them to the shoulder are those who didn't notice his white car
and blew past him at a great rate of speed.</TE>
<TE>   "At least once a day, I get somebody passing me at 85 to 90 mph,"
Pierce said. When those motorists are pulled over, he said, they
invariably blurt out, "I wouldn't have passed you if I knew you were
a police officer."</TE>

<HD>Big-Screen Farewell for Who Bassist</HD>
<DH>Hollywood: Showing of films featuring the band attracts
Entwistle's fans and their memories.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A film festival created to celebrate the Who, then hastily
transformed into a memorial for the veteran British rock group's
bassist John Entwistle, turned into an emotional wake Sunday for the
influential musician, who died last week in Las Vegas at 57 on the
eve of the band's new U.S. tour.</LD>
<LD>   Some 200 fans gathered at the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood as
much to mourn the loss of Entwistle, who apparently died in his sleep
of a heart attack, as to take in three movies featuring the dynamic
group best-known for its rock opera "Tommy" and such hits as "My
Generation."</LD>
<LD>   "Seeing them live was pretty much of a religious experience," said
Erica Childs, 32, of Burbank, outside the theater, shortly before the
screening of the first film, the 1979 Who documentary "The Kids Are
Alright."</LD>
<TE>   Childs, wearing an "I The Who" tank top and the surname of each
band member tattooed around her ankle, agreed with the decision by
Who guitarist and songwriter Pete Townshend and singer Roger Daltrey
to continue the tour, after an initial announcement that it would be
canceled. The first show is tonight at the Hollywood Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "There should be closure for them, their loved ones, their friends
and the fans," Childs said. "They shouldn't take away something
beautiful because of this."</TE>
<TE>   Traci Moore, 44, of Valencia, nodded in agreement, adding, "I
don't have any tattoos, but I have love in my heart for this band. I
feel like they were part of me. There's something in me that comes
alive, a part that's missing. But when I see them, I'm 100% alive
with their music."</TE>
<TE>   Inside the Egyptian a few minutes later, fans were greeted by a
photo of Entwistle on a stand in front of the blank screen. Many
openly wept as festival co-organizer Martin Lewis read statements
from Townshend and Daltrey, the two surviving members of the original
quartet. Drummer Keith Moon died in 1978 of a drug overdose.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, it is a fact of life that as we get older, more
and more of our friends disappear from our lives and death is like an
ever-encroaching shadow on us all," Daltrey's statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Recalling the band's performance at Madison Square Garden at a
benefit shortly after Sept. 11, Daltrey's statement continued, "It
proved to me once again what I have always believed: that music, of
any kind, has the power to lift people out of their grief and earthly
problems....I just hope that God has got his earplugs ready. Whatever
happens, he'll have to reinvent thunder, as it simply won't be loud
enough any more."</TE>
<TE>   Townshend's seven-sentence comment said, in part, "Pray for us
John, wherever you are. My immediate mission is to complete this tour
in good heart, and to remember John in my quiet and private times. It
is easy for me to smile when I remember John. I loved him
unconditionally."</TE>
<TE>   When the movies began, a cheer went up when each band member first
appeared on screen in "The Kids Are Alright," but it was loudest when
the camera turned on Entwistle in a clip from a late-'60s appearance
the Who made on the Smothers Brothers' musical variety show.</TE>
<TE>   The other Who films shown Sunday, part of a two-week "Mods &amp;
Rockers 2002" series of British films of the '60s presented by the
American Cinematheque, were director Ken Russell's 1975 screen
version of "Tommy" and "Listening To You--The Who at the Isle of
Wight Festival," a documentary of the group's performance at that
1970 British concert.</TE>
<TE>   The more musically attuned in the crowd noted Entwistle's
innovations as the instrumentalist who, along with Motown bassist
James Jamerson, lifted the bass guitar out of the musical background,
often giving it a prominence rivaling that of the lead guitar, drums,
and sometimes even the singer. Entwistle created the first prominent
bass solo in rock in the Who's 1966 single "My Generation."</TE>
<TE>   Other fans expressed as much sympathy for what Townshend and
Daltrey were going through as for their own feelings of loss.</TE>
<TE>   None of the fans surveyed criticized the decision to continue the
tour, for which British session bassist Pino Palladino is taking over
for Entwistle.</TE>
<TE>   "It's their decision, not ours," said Steven Spieczny, 37, of
Santa Monica. "To the extent they still want to share their music, I
respect that decision."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so impressed," added Moore. "That's the spirit of the Who.
They're survivors."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the shock fans felt at Entwistle's death stemmed from his
stoic, Gibraltar-solid stage presence that firmly anchored the band
as Townshend slashed at his guitar and leaped through the air,
Daltrey preened and swung his microphone like a lariat and Moon
bashed his drum kit in a madman's frenzy.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview two years ago, Entwistle had turned the Who's
signature rallying cry, "Hope I die before I get old" around when he
told The Times, "I always used to think that way....Now I hope I'll
get older before I die."</TE>
<TE>   Responded Moore: "So did we."</TE>

<HD>Astros' Saarloos Is Sent to Minors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Houston Astros returned top pitching prospect Kirk Saarloos to
the minors Sunday after three rough starts in which the right-hander
had a 17.65 earned-run average and two losses.</LD>
<LD>   He gave up 21 hits, including three homers, and 17 earned runs in
8 2/3 innings.</LD>
<LD>   The club promoted right-handed reliever Jim Mann from New Orleans
of the triple-A Pacific Coast League.</LD>
<TE>   Mann, 27, was 0-1 with a 5.14 ERA in six appearances with the
Astros earlier this season.</TE>
<TE>   Saarloos, 23, a former Cal State Fullerton star, was optioned to
New Orleans, a promotion from his last minor league stop at Round
Rock of the double-A Texas League.</TE>
<TE>   The Astros called him up in mid-June because of season-ending
surgery to starter Shane Reynolds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Deciding that Alberto Castillo was not the answer as Jorge
Posada's backup, the New York Yankees purchased the contract of
catcher Chris Widger from triple-A Columbus and designated Castillo
for assignment.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo, the catcher when Roger Cedeno stole home during
Saturday's game against the New York Mets, was batting .139 with no
homers and four runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   Widger was batting .244 with 10 homers and 39 RBIs in 61 games at
Columbus.</TE>
<TE>   He is a .240 career hitter with 50 homers and 183 RBIs in parts of
six seasons with Seattle and Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego Padres have agreed to terms with shortstop Khalil
Greene, a first-round draft pick who helped lead Clemson to the
College World Series this season.</TE>
<TE>   He is expected to join Eugene of the Class A Northwest League on
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Greene was drafted in the 14th round by the Chicago Cubs last year
but didn't sign and returned to Clemson.</TE>
<TE>   He batted .470 with a team-record 27 home runs and 91 RBIs this
season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The St. Louis Cardinals put outfielder J.D. Drew, who has been
suffering from tendinitis in his right knee, on the 15-day disabled
list. No surgery is expected, the club said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago White Sox took catcher Sandy Alomar Jr. off the 15-day
disabled list and recalled him from his rehabilitation assignment at
triple-A Charlotte.</TE>
<TE>   He has been on the disabled list since June 13 because of a
shoulder injury. He was batting .284 with four homers and 18 RBIs.</TE>

<HD>Braves Complete Sweep of Red Sox</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The Boston Red Sox couldn't wait to see interleague play end. The
Atlanta Braves, on the other hand, are sorry to see it go.</LD>
<LD>   Keith Lockhart doubled in the game-winning run during a four-run
10th inning as the Braves beat the Red Sox, 7-3 Sunday, to sweep the
three-game series at Fenway Park and win for the 10th time in 11
games.</LD>
<LD>   For the season, Atlanta went 15-3 in interleague play. Boston
finished 5-13.</LD>
<TE>   "Those teams really stuck it to us," said Red Sox outfielder
Johnny Damon, whose team lost for the seventh time in eight games.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta led, 3-0, before Brian Daubach, Trot Nixon and Nomar
Garciaparra hit solo homers to tie the score.</TE>
<TE>   Darren Bragg singled with one out in the 10th--his third hit of
the day--and one out later Lockhart fouled off three pitches with two
strikes on him before looping one down the right-field line to give
the Braves the lead.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a big hit," Lockhart said. "It put us ahead and the guys
followed behind us. That was certainly enough for this bullpen."</TE>
<TE>   Rafael Furcal made it 5-3 with a single on the 52nd pitch of the
day from Ugueth Urbina (0-3), who is usually a one-inning closer.</TE>
<TE>   Willie Banks yielded singles to Julio Franco and Gary Sheffield
before Chipper Jones reached and Franco scored when Banks botched a
throw to first.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Remlinger (5-0) earned the victory with two strikeouts in one
inning. The Braves won their 11th consecutive series and improved to
12-3 in the interleague era in Boston, the franchise's home for its
first five decades before it moved to Milwaukee and then Atlanta.</TE>

<LD>Rick Morrissey of the Chicago Tribune, commenting ruefully on the
struggling Chicago major league teams, the Cubs and White Sox:</LD>
<LD>   "Both teams appear to be going down together, as is usually the
case during a Chicago baseball season. It's what's called shared
experience. Of course, death in the family is a shared experience
too....</LD>
<LD>   "To say that both teams have come up short of expectations is like
saying Mike Tyson has come up short of sainthood.... Which team is
the bigger disappointment? Which member of the Capone gang had the
nicest personality?"</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: What do Ray Felix, Tom Hawkins, Howard Jolliff, Frank
Selvy and Rudy LaRusso have in common?</TE>
<TE>   Whoopee! Richie Whitt of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram: "Like him
or not, analyst Charles Barkley helped breathe life into TNT's
coverage of the otherwise unwatchable NBA draft.</TE>
<TE>   "When cameras showed a collage of mothers crying backstage,
anchorman Ernie Johnson melodramatically said, 'Ah, the tears of
joy.'</TE>
<TE>   "Barkley quickly interjected, 'Yeah tears of joy because they're
thinking, Damn I ain't poor no more.' "</TE>
<TE>   Chicken controversy: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle:</TE>
<TE>   "The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is leaning on
Barry Bonds to give up his gig as a pitchman for KFC Popcorn Chicken.</TE>
<TE>   "PETA says those chickens are pumped up on harmful steroids. The
chickens indignantly denied using 'roids. They insist their unusual
size is a product of hard work in the weight room."</TE>
<TE>   Hard to figure: Greg Cote in the Miami Herald:</TE>
<TE>   "The only three things on earth more confusing than the BCS [bowl
championship series] are the NFL formula for rating quarterbacks, the
directions for assembling a gas grill and the continuing gainful
employment of television's Tom Arnold."</TE>
<TE>   Makes sense: Blackie Sherrod in the Dallas Morning News:</TE>
<TE>   "All those batters who squawk loudly over called third strikes
might heed the old baseball axiom remembered by Bobby Bragan: 'If
it's close enough to call, it's close enough to hit.' "</TE>
<TE>   Nowheresville: Kansas City first baseman Mike Sweeney on being
ignored in All-Star voting despite leading the American League with a
.365 average:</TE>
<TE>   "That's what you get for playing in Kansas City."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1910, Chicago unveiled White Sox Park
(Comiskey Park), but the last-place St. Louis Browns spoiled the
occasion with a 2-0 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: They were among the original L.A. Lakers in the
1960-61 season.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Phil Mushnick in the New York Post:</TE>
<TE>   "Because self-promotion has always been one of Chris Berman's
strong points, SportsCenter's 'Plays of the Week,' last Sunday [June
23], anchored by Berman, include three clips of Berman hitting
practice golf shots at the Greater Hartford Open.</TE>
<TE>   "In other words, three athletes who did something noteworthy were
eliminated from ESPN's 'Plays of the Week' in order to indulge
Berman."</TE>

<LD>   What: "Peter Jacobsen Plugged In"</LD>
<TE>   Where: The Golf Channel, tonight, 7 and 10</TE>
<TE>   Heard any tennis jokes lately? Probably not. But you've no doubt
heard plenty of golf jokes. Something about golf lends itself to
humor.</TE>
<TE>   So it seems fitting for the Golf Channel to have a lighthearted
show such as this one, which makes its debut tonight. (The second
episode is scheduled for Aug. 5.)</TE>
<TE>   And who better to serve as host than golfer/funny man Peter
Jacobsen.</TE>
<TE>   It's not simply Jacobsen telling golf jokes, it's more Jacobsen
being Jacobsen, which means plenty of goofiness. Sidekick Matt
Griesser, known for his Sign Boy character in Foot Joy commercials,
adds even more levity.</TE>
<TE>   A hidden-camera segment in the first show has Jacobsen and
Griesser in front of a store offering "Golf Tips by a Pro" for $1 to
anyone passing by. It's amazing what they can talk their unsuspecting
"pupils" into doing.</TE>
<TE>   Other segments include a visit to the Indianapolis 500 and a bar
scene in which Jacobsen tells patrons about the time he tackled a
streaker on the 18th green at the 1985 British Open.</TE>
<TE>   There's also a mock instruction segment offering such things as a
putting tip that involves holding the putter in your teeth or
instruction on how to make a hole in one.</TE>
<TE>   The half-hour show ends with "Jake's Takes." In tonight's segment,
Jacobsen advocates making the Players Championship a fifth major.
This is intended to be a serious segment, although he somehow manages
to work "Gilligan's Island" into his commentary, which he concludes
with "That's my take, what's yours?"</TE>
<TE>   Jacobsen, a pro for 25 years who has won six PGA tournaments, is
also an accomplished guitar player who once headed a group known as
Jake Trout and the Flounders. The group also included Golf Channel
analyst Mark Lye, golfer Larry Rinker and the late Payne Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobsen, in the show's opening, plugs in an electric guitar,
which explains the "plugged in" part of the title.</TE>

<HD>Brazil Knows the Drill</HD>
<DH>Soccer: South Americans set themselves apart in winning
their record fifth championship behind Ronaldo's two second-half
goals.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YOKOHAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>Asia's first World Cup has entered the history books, and fortunately
they are illustrated volumes.</LD>
<LD>   The snapshots came tumbling out on a rainy Sunday night here,
where in front of 69,029 fans at the International Stadium, Brazil
defeated Germany, 2-0, on two goals by Ronaldo.</LD>
<LD>   Sorting through the images could take as long as it took Brazil to
win all seven of its games at Korea/Japan '02 and thereby claim a
record fifth world championship, the much-coveted "penta."</LD>
<TE>   There was, for instance, the picture of Pele, reaching up to hand
the golden World Cup trophy to Brazil's captain, Cafu, standing on a
tall pedestal amid a shower of silver confetti.</TE>
<TE>   There was the contrasting image of German goalkeeper Oliver Kahn,
sitting slumped against a goal post, staring vacantly into space,
until he was pulled out of his reverie and to his feet by teammate
Thomas Linke.</TE>
<TE>   There was the picture of Ronaldo and Rivaldo, two-thirds of
Brazil's "Triple R" offense, leaping the advertising boards at game's
end to cavort with a Brazilian flag in front of the massed yellow
ranks of Brazilian fans.</TE>
<TE>   There was the image of Germany Coach Rudi Voeller, swallowing the
hurt at having lost the opportunity to become only the third person
to win the World Cup both as a player and coach, walking over to
congratulate Ronaldo.</TE>
<TE>   There was the poignant picture of Cafu, who had made history by
becoming the first player to appear in three consecutive World Cup
finals, hoisting a Brazil shirt with the word "campeao" printed on it
and, scribbled beneath that, the name of Cafu's predecessor, Emerson,
who was sent home before the World Cup began when he injured his
shoulder during training.</TE>
<TE>   There was Brazil Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, planting a kiss of
delight on the bald head of defender Roberto Carlos and later walking
over to commiserate with the luckless Kahn.</TE>
<TE>   There was Ronaldinho, the third member of the "Triple R" line and
a player who worked tirelessly all night, leaping gleefully into the
arms of a teammate.</TE>
<TE>   There was the smiling image of Italian referee Pierluigi Collina,
bouncing the ball at midfield and knowing that he had called a
flawless game.</TE>
<TE>   There was the banner carried around the field by Brazil's players,
the one in Portuguese that read: "Povo Brasileiro Obrigado Pelo
Carinho," a heartfelt thank you to the people of Brazil for caring
about the team as much as they do.</TE>
<TE>   There was ... well, the images multiply and overlap, becoming a
blur of color, not unlike the rain of origami paper birds that
cascaded down from the stadium roof as music swelled as the end of
the World Cup drew near.</TE>
<TE>   Memorable for myriad reasons, the tournament is finally over.
Sixty-four games in 31 days in 20 cities across two countries adds up
to, well, exhaustion for one thing, but also a fine chapter in the
history of the sport.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's game marked the story's final passage, and Brazil and
Germany provided a spectacle fit for the occasion. The match will not
be remembered as a classic, but it was entertaining throughout, and
not as one-sided as a shutout might indicate.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil's goals came only after it weathered an uneasy first 30
minutes, during which Germany should have taken better advantage of
the South Americans' nerves. Once Brazil settled itself, the
Europeans' fate was sealed.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil's Kleberson clanged a shot off the crossbar before halftime
to signal his country's intent.</TE>
<TE>   Germany's Oliver Neuville banged a shot off the right post moments
after halftime to signal his country's resolve.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, it was Ronaldo who made the difference, grabbing the
all-important first goal in the 67th minute and adding a second 12
minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly for the Germans, the first came as the result of an
uncharacteristic error by their best and most reliable player, Kahn.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo started the move by slipping a pass to Rivaldo that cut
defender Christoph Metzelder out of the play. Rivaldo hit a shot that
didn't appear particularly dangerous, but Kahn bobbled the ball,
allowing it to roll off his hands and onto his chest and bounce away.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo was on the loose ball immediately, driving it into the
back of the German net before Kahn could get to it.</TE>
<TE>   The Brazilian reserves and fans celebrated as if the World Cup had
been won. The drums suddenly grew louder, the cheering more
confident. "Bra-zil, Bra-zil" rang out across the stadium. German
heads dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Voeller sent striker Oliver Bierhoff on in place of forward
Miroslav Klose, who had scored five goals in the first round but none
since. A few minutes later, Voeller replaced Jens Jeremies with
forward Gerald Asamoah.</TE>
<TE>   Neither move altered the course of the game, although a stinging
Bierhoff shot forced a smart save by Brazilian goalkeeper Marcos.
Then, in the 79th minute, Brazil struck again.</TE>
<TE>   Kleberson started the scoring sequence with a square pass and
Rivaldo threw the German defense into panic by intentionally allowing
the ball to roll past him to Ronaldo. That took Linke out of the play
and Asamoah was too far away to get to Ronaldo before he calmly
stroked the ball into the lower right corner of the net.</TE>
<TE>   With only 11 minutes left, Brazil was home safe and dry.</TE>
<TE>   Well, not so dry. The drizzle during the game grew stronger, but
it did nothing to dampen the celebration that followed, especially
that of Ronaldo.</TE>
<TE>   His two goals gave him eight for the tournament, earning him the
"Golden Boot" as its top scorer, and took his overall total in World
Cup play to 12, tying Pele's Brazilian record and leaving him only
two shy of the world record held by Germany's Gerd "Der Bomber"
Mueller.</TE>
<TE>   In 2006, when Germany stages the next World Cup, he can make both
records his own.</TE>

<HD>Kahn Falters at Wrong Time</HD>
<DH>Final: Germany's exceptional goalkeeper makes crucial
mistake after playing flawlessly throughout the tournament.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YOKOHAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>So this, then, was the wrath of Kahn: A water bottle angrily punted
against the side netting. Two padded gloves flung in disgust against
the back of the net. Two red eyes staring off in the distance while
Brazilians sang and danced 50 yards away.</LD>
<LD>   German goalkeeper Oliver Kahn, virtually flawless during his
team's relentless six-game march to the World Cup final, picked the
worst time possible for his first real mistake of the
tournament--bobbling a save in the 67th minute of a scoreless match
Sunday with Ronaldo lurking in the penalty area, far too close for
comfort.</LD>
<LD>   Ronaldo pounced on the rebound as Kahn scrambled on his stomach in
a vain attempt to collect the loose ball. Kahn looked up as Ronaldo
knocked the ball into the net, then buried his face in the wet turf.</LD>
<TE>   For only the second time in the World Cup, Kahn had been beaten
for a goal.</TE>
<TE>   But it was enough to send Germany reeling, on its way to a 2-0
loss at Yokohama International Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   It was the kind of save Kahn makes in his sleep, the kind of
mistake that will make sleep difficult in the nights and weeks ahead.
Brazil's Rivaldo hit a hard, low shot from the top of the box,
sending Kahn to his knees with both arms open, waiting to smother the
ball.</TE>
<TE>   But the ball, made slippery by a persistent drizzle, struck Kahn
in the chest, then in the arm and squirted out of his grasp. Kahn
lunged forward to retrieve the ball, but too late--Ronaldo already
was sprinting in to knock the ball just inside the right post.</TE>
<TE>   A dozen minutes later, Ronaldo struck again, from 17 yards. After
yielding one goal in his first 606 minutes of the World Cup, Kahn had
been hit for two in 12.</TE>
<TE>   After the final whistle sounded, Kahn spent several moments
flinging equipment around his goal before standing idly, numb, inside
the netting. Eventually, he propped himself against one of the goal
posts, then slid all the way down to the ground, taking a seat for
several minutes before two teammates walked over to help him to his
feet.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Brazil captain Cafu and referee Pierluigi Collina, they
tried to console Kahn, to little avail.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I can be consoled," Kahn said. "I am fully aware
that this is the only mistake I made in the seven matches of the
World Cup. That one mistake was brutally punished....</TE>
<TE>   "It's normal to make a mistake--but it's 10 times worse when it
comes in the final. You have to hold onto such a ball."</TE>
<TE>   Kahn showed up in the postmatch interview area with his right hand
wrapped in gauze and a bandage, the result of a torn ligament
sustained earlier in the tournament. He refused to blame the injury
for the bobble, but did allow that "it's a good thing that we are
going on our vacations now and I will give my body a rest."</TE>
<TE>   Kahn said he was proud of what his team accomplished at this World
Cup, leaving as "vice champions" after restoring "German football
back to where it belongs--in the top four."</TE>
<TE>   He said he appreciated Collina's gesture, but admitted he is
getting tired of losing important matches every time the Italian
referee works one of his games. Collina also was the referee when
Kahn's Bayern Munich team lost the Champions League final to
Manchester United in 1999 and when Germany lost at home to England,
5-1, last fall.</TE>
<TE>   "While he is a world-class referee, there is no doubting that he
just doesn't bring us luck, does he?" Kahn said. "With him, we lost
the Champions League final against Manchester. We lost at home to
England in that infamous 1-5 defeat. He just doesn't bring us luck.
Maybe it's four times lucky next time."</TE>

<LD>Pete Dalis accepted early on that the Mt. Rushmore of UCLA athletics
already was in place, that the larger-than-life images of basketball
coach John Wooden, charismatic athletic director J.D. Morgan and
football coaches Red Sanders and Terry Donahue were indelibly
chiseled in the psyche of Bruin followers.</LD>
<LD>   So Dalis carved his niche as the anti-icon, a self-described
nontraditional choice for athletic director, a furtive figure forever
lingering in the back of the room at news conferences and leading the
high-profile, high-pressure department by pulling nearly invisible
strings.</LD>
<LD>   Those who expect the Bruin men's basketball team to win the NCAA
title every year and the football team to occupy permanent residence
in the top 10 will quibble, but his mild-mannered methods made a
mark.</LD>
<TE>   In a 19-year tenure that ended Sunday in retirement, Dalis, 64,
leaves a legacy highlighted by 39 national championships, including
one in men's basketball. The department is financially sound and
enjoys a strong national reputation. The staff is experienced and
loyal.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, incoming Athletic Director Dan Guerrero faces
challenges--from fans who have seen enough of football Coach Bob
Toledo and basketball Coach Steve Lavin to a new Rose Bowl contract
to looming television negotiations--but he hardly is inheriting a
mess.</TE>
<TE>   Dalis, in fact, is nothing if not tidy. He provided Guerrero with
a comprehensive briefing document on the state of the department and
even escorted him around the Rose Bowl, walking through the athletic
director's duties on a football game day.</TE>
<TE>   A more melancholy stroll for Dalis is the one down memory lane. He
came to UCLA as a 17-year-old freshman in 1955, served as manager of
the football team while a student and took an administrative job on
campus upon graduating. It's the only place he has worked.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the place [where] I grew up, and I've been reflecting on
my time here for several months," he said. "It is quite a different
environment now. Westwood Boulevard was a public thoroughfare; you
could drive right through campus to get to Sunset. There were no
parking problems. There have been so many changes, and I have very
fond memories."</TE>
<TE>   Difficult ones too, including episodes early on that shaped his
views on NCAA rules enforcement and media coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Dalis was a football manager when the Bruins were rocked by
scandal. UCLA (as well as USC and other West Coast schools) was
charged with giving players $40 a month in violation of NCAA rules.
The Pacific Coast Conference, a precursor to the Pacific 10, put the
Bruins on three years probation beginning in 1956 and prohibited
seniors from playing in more than five games. The uproar led to the
dissolution of the PCC.</TE>
<TE>   "I was angry and disillusioned [with the PCC] because giving a
small amount of money to players was part of the culture nationwide,"
Dalis said. "I did not consider it a problem because that was the way
life was conducted. I was young, these were our friends on the
football team, and we didn't quite understand why this was happening.</TE>
<TE>   "I still feel there is a great deal of inconsistency in the way
penalties are laid out. Not with the Pac-10 necessarily, but with the
NCAA."</TE>
<TE>   The most painful task for Dalis, as athletic director, was
investigating infractions by UCLA that resulted in severe penalties.
Lowlights included the school forfeiting the 1995 national
championship in softball because of an ineligible player, football
players illegally using handicapped-parking placards in 1999 and star
tailback DeShaun Foster losing eligibility last fall because he
accepted the "extra benefit" of driving a car that did not belong to
him.</TE>
<TE>   "Having served on the Pac-10 compliance committee and having
appeared in front of the NCAA infractions committee more than once,
you see there is unevenness in how penalties are applied," he said.
"It's hard to explain to your student-athletes and their families and
to your constituency, particularly when you bare your soul and assist
in the investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Dalis was uncomfortable speaking to the media. His trepidation was
well founded in January 2001, when he did talk to Bruin beat writers
and said he had had a conversation with Rick Pitino, then the Boston
Celtic coach.</TE>
<TE>   That was a bombshell, calling into question the job security of
Lavin, a hot topic anyway. However, Dalis regarded his comments as a
preemptive strike because his conversation with Pitino had been made
public in New England earlier in the day.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have got out anyway," he said. "I had nothing to hide.
But if I had it to do over again, I wouldn't have mentioned it."</TE>
<TE>   Dealing with the media was not the only time Dalis found himself
longing for a less-complicated bygone era. For a lifelong
administrator sensitive to protocol and chain of command, receiving
floods of e-mails from Bruin fans addressing the perceived failings
of coaches became unnerving.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes they come at 3 in the morning, and typically there is
so much angst and anger you wonder about the personalities of the
people who send them," he said. "Accusations are made anonymously,
and you chase your tail."</TE>
<TE>   Dalis believes much of the recent criticism aimed at Lavin and
Toledo is unfair, although he acknowledges the two coaches he hired
six years ago have not reached their potential. Neither had previous
head coaching experience at the NCAA Division I level.</TE>
<TE>   "Terry Donahue says nobody is born a head coach, and it takes
quite a while for them to eventually put it all together," he said.
"[Lavin] hasn't gotten there yet. I'm not sure Bob is totally there
yet also. There really is a long gestation period."</TE>
<TE>   As for why he did not hire coaches with more experience, Dalis
points to the relatively low pay offered by UCLA. Lavin and Toledo
each earn $578,000 annually, a figure that includes shoe and apparel
endorsement money.</TE>
<TE>   "That was difficult for me," Dalis said. "I have presented plans
to secure a coach, but I was limited in what I was able to offer in
compensation. I have a sense that may be changing a little bit, but
to date, [senior administrators] at this university have not wanted
to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Dalis fired three men's basketball coaches--Larry Farmer, Walt
Hazzard and Jim Harrick--yet exhibited patience with Lavin. He gives
both the current basketball coach and Toledo high marks for their
commitment to UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "What people don't see is the influence a head coach has within
the athletic department," he said. "We need to win games, obviously,
but there is another context to what a head coach represents. If they
are good human beings and they represent the values of the
institution, that creates cohesiveness in the department. That
percolates up to other people.</TE>
<TE>   "Good people who want to be here and represent this institution
and its values are important."</TE>
<TE>   Dalis' own loyalty was a key reason he was hired in 1983 by
then-chancellor Charles Young. Dalis had been director of
recreational services and was the leading force behind building the
popular Wooden Center, a 95,000 square-foot recreation complex
serving all students.</TE>
<TE>   But Young saw more in Dalis, believing he could be trusted to rein
in an athletic department the chancellor believed had become
autonomous.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a feeling that the era of J.D. Morgan was gone," Dalis
said. "The chancellor saw a need to mainstream the athletic
department with the rest of the university."</TE>
<TE>   The beginning of Dalis' tenure coincided with schools gaining the
right to negotiate their own television contracts. Fees paid by
networks and cable decreased as the number of televised games
increased, resulting in a revenue shortfall for schools.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, the UCLA athletic department budget was in the red
for years, and the deficit grew to $3.2 million by 1990. Dalis
balanced the budget by streamlining his staff, cutting men's swimming
and gymnastics and by launching an endowed scholarship program.</TE>
<TE>   A portion of about 180 of UCLA's 273 grant-in-aids are offset by
the endowed scholarships funded by the interest from individual
donations of $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very attractive program, and I'm surprised how many people
have come forward we didn't even know," said Dalis, who credits
associate athletic director Rick Purdy for overseeing the program.
"It creates a really sound base."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Dalis became an elder statesman among Pac-10
athletic directors and in 1997 negotiated the conference television
contract with Fox. He also advocated a revenue-sharing plan generous
to conference schools in the Northwest even though UCLA games often
are the most lucrative.</TE>
<TE>   "I characterize Pete as smart, fair and effective," said Tom
Hansen, the Pac-10 commissioner. "He has an overarching sense of
balance and fairness. His wisdom and advice usually carried the day.</TE>
<TE>   "One of his fine qualities is he was able to look beyond UCLA's
interest in the most immediate sense and realize it was in UCLA's
long-term interest to have a strong conference with good
competition."</TE>
<TE>   Few programs nationwide were as competitive across the board as
UCLA's under Dalis, excelling in women's and Olympic sports as well
as enjoying triumphant moments in men's basketball and football.</TE>
<TE>   As Dalis moves into retirement, it is the anticipation of those
moments he will miss.</TE>
<TE>   "Athletics is a field that represents the world of possibility,"
he said. "It's a wonderful thing in this line of work that doesn't
exist in a lot of the other areas. Even when you don't win. There is
hope and renewal every year, like the changing of the seasons."</TE>

<HD>Quality Matchups Might Cost More</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>To the thousands of Dodger fans who invade Edison Field every summer,
drowning out everyone else by shouting "root, root, root for the
Dodgers" during the singing of "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" and
pledging their allegiance to the visiting team: You might pay more
for your ticket next season than the Angel fan sitting near you.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers and Angels played to sellout crowds all weekend in
Anaheim, with the total attendance of 130,341 setting a record for a
three-game series at Edison Field. The Angels are considering joining
the growing number of major league teams charging higher ticket
prices for more attractive games, said Kevin Uhlich, senior vice
president of business operations.</LD>
<LD>   Outside baseball, the idea of adjusting prices to consumer demand
is nothing new. That's why a Saturday evening show costs more than a
matinee, and that's why a reserved UCLA football ticket this fall
costs $25 against Colorado State, $32 against Oregon and $58 against
USC.</LD>
<TE>   The San Francisco Giants charge more for weekend tickets. The St.
Louis Cardinals charge more to see games from Memorial Day to Labor
Day. The Colorado Rockies charge as many as four different prices for
the same seat, depending in part on opponents, promotions and special
events.</TE>
<TE>   As an incentive to buy season tickets, and as a reward to loyal
customers, the Angels could consider hiking prices on single-game
tickets only. That's how a Dodger fan might pay more than an Angel
fan for a ticket in the same section.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' Ben Weber pitched eight seasons in the minor leagues,
another two in Taiwan and made his major league debut at 30. Weber,
normally a setup man for closer Troy Percival, pitched three hitless
innings Sunday to earn his first major league save. But, with rookie
John Lackey recording his first major league victory, Weber
graciously gave Lackey the game ball.</TE>
<TE>   "A win trumps a save," Weber said. "Plus, I can always go into the
ball bag, get another ball and pretend it was that ball. Twenty years
from now, no one will realize that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels haven't had a player voted into the All-Star team in 16
years, so it's difficult to imagine that Darin Erstad will win the
online fan voting for the last spot on the American League All-Star
team. Erstad is one of five finalists, along with Oakland's Eric
Chavez, Boston's Johnny Damon, Chicago's Magglio Ordonez and
Cleveland's Jim Thome. Balloting closes Tuesday. Erstad vowed he
would not log on and vote for himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I get yelled at enough for not going online and checking e-mails
from my friends," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Wooten's rehabilitation assignment, which started Friday at
Class-A Rancho Cucamonga, moves today to triple-A Salt Lake. The
first baseman-designated hitter is expected to join the Angels after
the All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers collide with the Arizona Diamondbacks tonight in the
first game of a three-game series between the National League West
rivals, but the Dodgers might not be at full strength because of two
collisions during the interleague series against the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Green was penciled into the lineup as the designated hitter
Sunday at Edison Field, but he was scratched shortly before the first
pitch because of a jammed left thumb suffered in Saturday night's
defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Green said he injured the thumb when he collided with Dave Roberts
while chasing a first-inning fly ball hit by Scott Spiezio. Roberts
made the catch.</TE>
<TE>   "It was sore last night," Green said. "I went down and started
swinging in the cage [Sunday] and I knew I wouldn't be able to go out
and be effective in the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to wait and see how I feel. As soon as I'm able to
contribute, I'll be back in the lineup. Hopefully, that will be
[tonight]."</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, second baseman Mark Grudzielanek suffered a slight
concussion after his head collided with right fielder Brian Jordan's
knee on a seventh-inning fly ball hit by David Eckstein. Jordan made
the catch.</TE>
<TE>   Grudzielanek stayed in the game after the collision but was
replaced in the eighth inning.</TE>
<TE>   "I called him off at the last minute and he tried to get out of
the way, but he couldn't," said Jordan, a former NFL defensive back.</TE>
<TE>   Grudzielanek, who is listed as day-to-day, said he did not lose
consciousness, but closed his eyes after the hit and was, "seeing
lights."</TE>
<TE>   "I feel it right between the temples--it's kind of pounding,"
Grudzielanek said. "You don't want to get hit by that guy. He's used
to doing that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger left-hander Omar Daal, who is nursing a slight left groin
strain, threw a bullpen session and felt no ill effects.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy said, "everything points to him taking the ball
for us," Tuesday against the Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After his team reached the official halfway mark of the season,
Tracy said he was pleased with his team's performance through 81
games.</TE>
<TE>   "We have nothing to be ashamed of at 50-31," Tracy said. "We turn
the page and start a new month. We have a big series coming up, we're
in first place and we don't have a lot to hang our heads about,
that's for sure."</TE>

<HD>Lackey Looks Like an All-Star</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Rookie outduels Perez and Angels beat Dodgers,
5-1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Lackey looked up at all the people, the thousands of Dodger fans
yelling and the thousands of Angel fans yelling back. He had never
pitched in front of this many people in his life. Yes, sir, this was
gonna be fun.</LD>
<LD>   Nervous? Intimidated? Maybe some other kid, but not this one.</LD>
<LD>   "He's got that stare on his face," Angel reliever Ben Weber said
after the Angels beat the Dodgers, 5-1, Sunday. "You can just look at
him and tell he's not scared."</LD>
<TE>   Lackey stared down the Dodgers, earning his first major league
victory before a raucous sellout crowd of 43,059 at Edison Field.
Lackey and Weber combined on a five-hitter, and Benji Gil hit a
three-run home run, powering the Angels over All-Star pitcher Odalis
Perez and the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels took two of three games over the weekend, ending the
Dodgers' run of nine consecutive series victories. But, on this first
day of July, summer appears promising enough to allow local fans to
dream of a Freeway Series in October.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers lead the National League West by 1 1/2 games over the
Arizona Diamondbacks, with another three games as a cushion in the
wild-card race. And the Angels, shrugging off the conventional wisdom
that they must win the American League West because the wild card
will come out of the AL East, are one-half game behind the Boston Red
Sox in the wild-card race and 3 1/2 games behind the Seattle Mariners
in the AL West.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought, coming into spring training, that we were good enough
to take the division," Angel pitcher Jarrod Washburn said. "Now we've
proven it, to ourselves and to other people."</TE>
<TE>   Perez, selected to the NL All-Star team before Sunday's game, lost
for the first time since May 24.</TE>
<TE>   He held the Angels hitless for five innings. Unfortunately for the
Dodgers, those innings were the third through the seventh, by which
time the Angels led, 5-0. Of the first nine Angel batters, seven got
hits.</TE>
<TE>   Perez attributed the rocky start to mild tightness in his pitching
arm.</TE>
<TE>   "I was feeling like it wasn't me the first two innings," he said.
"I came in and the trainer stretched me, and everything was better.</TE>
<TE>   "My fastball wasn't there. When I was trying to throw strikes, I
got hit."</TE>
<TE>   Lackey did nothing but throw strikes, with better results. He gave
up one run in six innings, striking out one but getting 12 of 18 outs
on ground balls. Of his first 34 pitches, 26 were strikes.</TE>
<TE>   "He threw great," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said. "He threw strikes
and pitched aggressively and forced us into a lot of early-count
swings."</TE>
<TE>   Said Weber: "Usually, kids come up and they're a little tentative,
and they want to throw breaking balls. He just says, 'Here it is, hit
it.' "</TE>
<TE>   On the surface, perhaps, the Angels appear silly for throwing a
rookie into their rotation in the heat of a pennant race. But he has
been absolutely unruffled by circumstances that could rattle many a
higher-paid pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   In his major league debut last week, before friends and family in
Texas and against a lineup featuring four potential Hall of Famers,
Lackey held the Rangers to three runs over seven innings. On Sunday,
before a sellout crowd and against the team that opened the series
with the best record in the majors, Lackey shut out the Dodgers for
the first five innings.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, he played high school football in West Texas, before
crowds of 25,000. Beach balls are not thrown there.</TE>
<TE>   "His poise is a big reason why we feel he's ready for the
challenge of the major leagues," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said.
"Even with his experience, he'll pitch well beyond what you might
think."</TE>
<TE>   Sure, the Angels could trade for a veteran starter. The Detroit
Tigers are shopping ace Jeff Weaver, and a Detroit scout watched
Lackey and the Angels on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "[Lackey's] got great makeup, and he's got great stuff," Angel
pitcher Dennis Cook said. "Why not him?"</TE>

<HD>Schilling Good Enough to Beat Indians for 13th Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>Curt Schilling says he didn't have his best fastball, breaking
pitches or control. Imagine what he might have done if he had.</LD>
<LD>   Schilling got his major league-leading 13th victory--and first in
four starts--with a five-hitter Sunday, leading the Arizona
Diamondbacks to a 5-2 win over the Cleveland Indians.</LD>
<LD>   Schilling (13-3) cruised from the opening pitch, and got his first
victory since June 8 and first complete game in 16 starts.</LD>
<TE>   "I didn't have much," he said modestly. "I wasn't good whatsoever.
They hit balls hard all day--right at us."</TE>
<TE>   The right-hander, who hadn't faced the Indians since 1990 in
relief for Baltimore, had a no-decision in his last start after
losing the previous two.</TE>
<TE>   But he got back on track against the struggling Indians, the AL's
worst hitting team, and improved to 8-0 in nine road starts this
season. Schilling walked one and struck out five.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked like Schilling didn't even work that hard," Indian
shortstop Omar Vizquel said. "But he got a couple runs and he has
such good command. He wasn't about to give us anything."</TE>
<TE>   Junior Spivey homered and the Diamondbacks took advantage of some
early wildness by starter Danys Baez (6-6), who walked four in the
first inning and didn't get through the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Thome hit his 24th homer and Ellis Burks homered for the
struggling Indians, who went 6-12 in interleague play and 11-15 in
June--their worst month since April 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Stevens, acquired in the trade that sent Bartolo Colon to
Montreal, played right for Cleveland. It was his first game in the
outfield since Sept. 2, 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling snapped out of his worst mini-drought in nearly two
years with a typical Schilling performance. Averaging less than one
walk per game, he has walked only 13 in 131 1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   "Curt's actually pitched much better," said Arizona catcher Damian
Miller. "But that just shows how good he is. He can get away with
things when he's not on."</TE>

<HD>Pooley Works Overtime to Defeat Watson</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The playoff matched five-time British Open winner Tom Watson against
qualifier Don Pooley, whose last big golf moment occurred in 1987.</LD>
<LD>   Watson, who earlier came back from a five-shot deficit, appeared
destined to add a U.S. Senior Open title to the U.S. Open crown he
won 20 years earlier.</LD>
<LD>   But Pooley made a 10-foot birdie putt on the fifth playoff hole
Sunday to end a battle with Watson and become the first qualifier to
win the U.S. Senior Open.</LD>
<TE>   More than five hours after the duo teed off at Owings Mills, Md.,
Pooley finally ended his 15-year winless drought</TE>
<TE>   Pooley qualified for the tournament by winning a playoff, and won
it the same way. The $450,000 first-place check was his biggest since
his last win on the tour, the 1987 Memorial.</TE>
<TE>   Watson's four-under-par 67 and Pooley's 70 left both at 10-under
274.</TE>
<TE>   After they battled through 18 holes and a three-hole playoff in
which the cumulative scores were totaled, they returned to the 18th
hole for a sudden-death format.</TE>
<TE>   Pooley made a 12-foot birdie putt, but Watson also made a birdie
from the same distance. Pooley then made the winning shot on the 77th
hole of the four-day tournament.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Annika Sorenstam's tuneup for next week's U.S. Women's Open was
like most of her year on the LPGA Tour--perfect.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam shot a bogey-free five-under-par 66 for a 12-under-par
total of 201 and a three-stroke victory in the ShopRite LPGA Classic
at Galloway Township, N.J., after Kate Golden let the lead slip away
with bogeys on four of the last five holes.</TE>
<TE>   The victory in the $1.2-million event was worth $180,000 and
pushed Sorenstam's earnings this year to $1,534,054, more than twice
the amount of the tour's No. 2 money earner, Se Ri Pak.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Colin Montgomerie might be forced to withdraw from next month's
British Open because of a persistent back injury.</TE>

<HD>One-Armed Outfielder Gray Dies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NANTICOKE, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Pete Gray, who became a major league ballplayer despite losing his
right arm in a childhood accident, died Sunday. He was 87.</LD>
<LD>   Gray was born with the name Peter Wyshner, but took the name Gray
when he entered organized baseball. He played one season in the
majors, hitting .218 in 77 games as an outfielder with the St. Louis
Browns in 1945.</LD>
<LD>   At the time Gray played, disabled athletes were often regarded as
sideshow oddities. Frequently, there were taunts and insults. "If
they insulted me, I didn't pay attention," Gray told The Citizens'
Voice of Wilkes-Barre, Pa., in a 1995 interview. "I mostly kept to
myself. That's why I got the reputation of being tough to get along
with."</LD>
<TE>   Gray was right-handed until he lost his right arm when he slipped
while riding on the running board of a truck and the arm got caught
in one of the wheels.</TE>
<TE>   After Gray learned to throw left-handed, a cobbler made a custom
glove for him, with most of the padding removed so he could hold it
loosely on his fingertips. That allowed him to discard the glove
quickly to field a softly hit ball with his bare hand or slide his
hand fully into the fingers to catch a fly ball or field a line
drive. The glove is in the Baseball Hall of Fame at Cooperstown, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   In his season with the Browns, he had 51 hits, including six
doubles and two triples. He had 13 runs batted in and struck out only
11 times.</TE>
<TE>   Gray was an accomplished bunter. In order to bunt, he would plant
the knob of the bat against his side, then slide his hand about a
third of the way up the shaft.</TE>

<HD>Inesperado's Victory Lifts Spirits of Grieving Owner</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Charles Kenis married Audrey Skirball in 1987, his racing
know-how was nil.</LD>
<LD>   "I have to go to Del Mar," Skirball said one day.</LD>
<LD>   "What for?" Kenis asked her.</LD>
<TE>   Kenis trailed along, and now, with the further help of trainer
Bobby Frankel, he stands in winner's circles, accepting trophies and
congratulations.</TE>
<TE>   Such an occasion was Sunday at Hollywood Park, where the 3 + U
Stable soldiered on, less than two weeks after the death of Skirball,
the 87-year-old philanthropist, on June 19. Inesperado, a recent
arrival from France, where Kenis has done business as a cognac and
wine importer, won the $182,600 Cinema Handicap with a gutty ride
from Kent Desormeaux, and later Super Quercus, a multiple Grade I
stakes winner, dropped into allowance company for his third straight
win.</TE>
<TE>   "I stopped by the cemetery this morning," said Kenis, referring to
his visit to Hillside Memorial Park. "I told Audrey they were
running, and she gave me the jockey instructions. She loved her
horses right to the end. She came to the track the Saturday before
she died. I would never be at the races except for her."</TE>
<TE>   Kenis has no plans to cut back on the stable. He's riding the same
crest as Frankel, who used Inesperado for his 20th graded stakes win
this year, after winning 36 last year.</TE>
<TE>   Kenis said that Frankel was responsible for the purchase of
Inesperado as well as Dripping In Diamonds, who'll run next Saturday
in the $200,000 Prioress Stakes at Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   Just when it looked like Regiment had to worry only about his
entrymate Johar in the stretch run of the Cinema, Desormeaux found
room on the fence with Inesperado to beat Regiment by a nose.
Regiment, who had won four straight, was the 1-2 favorite along with
Johar, who finished third, another half-length back.</TE>
<TE>   Running 1 1/8 miles on Hollywood's turf course in 1:47 3/5,
Inesperado earned $97,560--more than he banked for four wins in nine
starts in France--and paid $7.40 as the second betting choice.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trainers who were unwilling to enter horses Saturday for next
Wednesday's card changed their minds Sunday. There were 68 horses
entered for the eight races Wednesday and 101 entries for the 10
races on Independence Day. The trainers have been pressured by
significant premium increases for workers' compensation insurance.
"Hollywood Park has clarified their position," said Ed Halpern,
executive director of the California Thoroughbred Trainers. Halpern
said that the track has orally committed about $650,000 from vanning,
stabling and marketing funds to defray insurance costs.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Hollywood Park stewards will interview jockeys
Garrett Gomez and Felipe Martinez, who had a brief exchange after the
first race. In what was reportedly a one-punch fight before they were
separated, Martinez struck Gomez in the face, splitting his lip. In
the first race, won by Wicked Susan with Gomez aboard, Apollo's
Missile appeared to clip heels, went down and unseated Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   High Chaparral won the $1-million Irish Derby at the Curragh,
becoming the second horse in as many years to win that race as well
as the Epsom Derby.... According to the Daily Racing Form, Jason
Lumpkins, the second-leading rider behind Russell Baze in Northern
California, will remain on the fair circuit and skip Del Mar.</TE>

<HD>Sasaki Doesn't Feel Special After Losing</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kazuhiro Sasaki couldn't quite get excited about the All-Star game,
because this was a rare occasion when he didn't feel like one.</LD>
<LD>   Seattle's star closer yielded only his second and third earned
runs this season Sunday, and the Colorado Rockies rallied in the top
of the ninth inning to beat the Mariners, 4-3, at Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   Sasaki (2-2) blew his fourth save opportunity in 22 attempts, and
Seattle had its five-game winning streak end on the day Sasaki and
teammates Ichiro Suzuki and Freddy Garcia were selected for the
American League All-Star team.</LD>
<TE>   "This should have been a happy day because I was picked for the
All-Star game," Sasaki said. "I'm just thinking about the loss today
and I'm feeling really bad."</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 7, San Francisco 0--Tim Hudson pitched a five-hitter at
Oakland for his third career shutout, and the Athletics won for the
second time in six games. Hudson (6-7) won for the third time in four
decisions. He retired 14 of 15 batters during one stretch en route to
his first shutout since Sept. 9, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 13, San Diego 1--Raul Ibanez singled, tripled, homered
and drove in four runs for the second time in three days at Kansas
City, Mo. The Padres lost for the seventh time in nine games. The
Royals, after losing eight in a row, finished 5-1 in a six-game home
stand.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago Cubs 9, Chicago White Sox 2--Matt Clement shut down the
White Sox and Mark Bellhorn homered from both sides of the plate, and
the Cubs avoided a sweep at Comiskey Park. Clement (6-5) gave up two
runs and six hits over eight-plus innings, and matched his career
high with 12 strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 7, Montreal 5--Carlos Delgado hit a tiebreaking two-run
homer in the bottom of the seventh inning in what was possibly the
final game between the Canadian teams. The Blue Jays improved to
18-13 against the Expos, who could be contracted or moved after the
season.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 4, Milwaukee 3--Luis Vizcaino walked Dustan Mohr to
force in the go-ahead run in the bottom of the eighth inning at
Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Denny Hocking started the rally with a single against Glendon
Rusch (5-6). One out later, Matthew LeCroy singled. Vizcaino relieved
and struck out Torii Hunter. But he walked Bobby Kielty and walked
Mohr on a 3-and-2 pitch to force in Hocking.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 6, Detroit 2--The Pirates finished interleague play by
winning two of three from the Tigers at Detroit after going 1-8 in
their previous games against the AL.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 8, Baltimore 5--The Phillies rallied from four runs
behind at Camden Yards. Robert Person (3-4) pitched five innings for
his 50th career victory. Jose Mesa pitched the ninth for his 200th
career save and 20th this season.</TE>
<TE>   New York Yankees 8, New York Mets 0--Andy Pettitte (2-2) pitched a
three-hitter to win for the first time since April 5. Alfonso Soriano
and John Vander Wal each drove in two runs for the Yankees, who won
two of three in the Subway Series at Yankee Stadium. The teams split
six games this season.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 5, Florida 4--Brent Abernathy singled home Steve Cox
with one out in the bottom of the 12th inning at St. Petersburg, Fla.</TE>

<LD>All-Star inflections and reflections while watching the Angels knock
some glitter off Odalis Perez:</LD>
<LD>   * This has been billed as a golden age for shortstops, and
American League Manager Joe Torre will attempt to squeeze the entire
age into the July 9 game at Milwaukee.</LD>
<LD>   Torre selected four shortstops--Derek Jeter, Nomar Garciaparra,
Miguel Tejada and Omar Vizquel--as understudies to starter Alex
Rodriguez, leaving Alfonso Soriano as the only second baseman.</LD>
<TE>   Why not?</TE>
<TE>   All five shortstops are deserving, and there is no clear-cut
second base candidate behind Soriano, although Torre could have
selected Seattle's Bret Boone in tribute to his historic season in
2001.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, any of the shortstops can play an inning or two at
second. In fact, Vizquel, who is the only Cleveland representative
and might not have received that honor if Bartolo Colon hadn't been
traded by the Indians out of the American League on Thursday, has
already volunteered to switch.</TE>
<TE>   "I would play second if they wanted," he said. "I'd play right
field. I don't care. To me, the biggest honor is just to go to the
All-Star Game."</TE>
<TE>   * The Angels played to three sellouts during the interleague
series with the Dodgers, setting an Edison Field attendance record
for a three-game series, but are any of the Anaheim partisans even
aware they can still get Darin Erstad on the AL team?</TE>
<TE>   In a new process, Erstad is one of five players selected by
Torre--the others are Eric Chavez, Jim Thome, Johnny Damon and Miguel
Ordonez--to be voted on by fans for the final roster berth.</TE>
<TE>   Voting can only be done on the internet--at mlb.com and
espn.com--and only until 3:30 p.m. Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he wanted to make a final campaign speech, Erstad frowned
and dismissed his still possible selection.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the chance of it happening are negative 12," he said.
"I've never worried about that stuff anyway and I'm not going to lose
any sleep now.</TE>
<TE>   "When [Manager Mike Scioscia] told me about it, I kind of felt
like the last player selected in the NFL draft."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, but Erstad played before a lot of potential voters on the
weekend--"the atmosphere was electric," he said--and did nothing to
damage his candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   "We won two, that's more important," he said.</TE>
<TE>   * Garret Anderson celebrated his 30th birthday by being named the
only Angel representative, a deserved honor. Anderson plays on
birthdays, holidays, you name it. Only Rafael Palmeiro, among
American Leaguers, has played in more games in the last 5 1/2
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   * In the Dept. of What Might Have Been, the Dodgers, perhaps, have
become conditioned to seeing Mike Piazza and Pedro Martinez selected,
but that pain was exacerbated Sunday by Torre's selection of Paul
Konerko as a first base backup.</TE>
<TE>   The ongoing emergence of one-time phenom Konerko as one of
baseball's best hitters--he leads the majors with 70 runs batted in
and is batting .340 with 20 home runs--is a painful reminder that the
Independence Day trade of 1998 in which then general manager Tom
Lasorda sent Konerko and Dennys Reyes to Cincinnati for Jeff Shaw may
not yet challenge the Martinez and Piazza trades as the club's worst,
but is high in the top 10.</TE>
<TE>   On Lasorda's behalf, the contending Dodgers were desperate for a
closer at the time, Konerko had not responded to the opportunity when
Eric Karros opened the '98 season on the disabled list, and there
were doubts as to what other position he could play and if he could
ever fulfill the Dodgers' high expectations amid the pressure in L.A.
The Reds were also quick to trade him, sending him to the Chicago
White Sox at the end of the 1998 season for Mike Cameron.</TE>
<TE>   The current campaign has become the biggest and best of four
consecutive banner seasons in Chicago, or as Scioscia, who was
working in the Dodger system during Konerko's formative and often
frustrating time with that organization, put it: "Say what you will
about what happened in L.A., he's definitely having a monster year."</TE>
<TE>   * Perez wasn't at his best in Sunday's 5-1 loss to the Angels, but
his and teammate Eric Gagne's All-Star selections represented a
remarkable turnaround from the uncertain status of their careers--as
recently as March.</TE>
<TE>   Perez applauded National League Manager Bob Brenly for making a
"good decision" in his case, while Gagne proved that you can take the
boy out of Canada, but you can't take Canada out of the boy.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if his selection might provide a lift for the fans of his
hometown, Gagne said, "to me, that's the most important thing.
Baseball in Montreal is not doing well."</TE>
<TE>   The Expos, of course, are doing better than anyone might have
expected, but his point was understood. If a Canadian pitcher named
Claude Raymond, a 1966 All-Star, helped motivate the young Gagne,
maybe Gagne can inspire young players.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids there need it, especially if the Expos leave," he said.</TE>
<TE>   * The All-Star tenure of Texas catcher Ivan Rodriguez ended after
10 appearances and nine consecutive starts, while New York Met second
baseman Roberto Alomar had made 12 consecutive appearances.</TE>
<TE>   A back injury that sidelined Rodriguez for much of the first half
foiled his candidacy. Alomar is one of several new Mets who have
under-performed, too often a mysterious and disturbing development
during a career some consider worthy of the Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   Alomar finished second in the voting on the basis of name
recognition, but Brenly made the right decision in selecting Luis
Castillo as the backup to starter Jose Vidro.</TE>
<TE>   * Kazuhisa Ishii has helped pitch the Dodgers into the NL West
lead, but he pitched his way off the All-Star team by losing three of
his last four starts, including two against the Angels in which he
worked a total of only three innings and 3 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, it may have been a break. Ishii leads the majors in
walks, and the All-Star Game is long enough.</TE>

<HD>Da Matta Makes Sure It's a Very Big Day for Brazil</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cristiano da Matta had his silly moments Sunday, leading CART's
contingent of Brazilian drivers in a spontaneous decision that
produced some outrageous haircuts in celebration of their country's
World Cup victory.</LD>
<LD>   Then Da Matta made it one more win for Brazil, fighting off the
challenge of countryman Bruno Junqueira to win the Chicago Grand Prix
for the second time in three years.</LD>
<LD>   Still jubilant about Brazil's 2-0 victory over Germany earlier in
the day, Da Matta raced to his third consecutive victory, his fourth
of the year and sixth in nine races.</LD>
<TE>   Da Matta arrived at the track early enough to watch the soccer
match, celebrated with his fellow Brazilian drivers and joined them
in getting haircuts just like Brazil's soccer star Ronaldo--with the
whole back of their heads shaved to stubble.</TE>
<TE>   "After the game, I met with my engineers and you just start to get
into your work and forget about it," Da Matta said. "The happiness is
in the back of your mind all the time but, for me, driving is a lot
more important than soccer."</TE>
<TE>   Da Matta proved his focus was back on track, leading a race-high
82 laps, including the final 16 of 250 on the 1.039-mile Chicago
Motor Speedway oval.</TE>
<TE>   Junqueira followed his longtime competitor and friend's
Toyota-powered Lola across the finish line by 0.639 seconds--about
five car-lengths. Dario Franchitti, who started from the pole and led
the first 68 laps, finished third.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Greg Biffle won the NASCAR Busch Series GNC Live Well 250 for the
second year in a row after leading for much of the way.</TE>
<TE>   Biffle, who took the lead for the final time after pulling past
Scott Wimmer on Lap 132, has won three times at The Milwaukee Mile in
West Allis, Wis. Biffle held off Jason Keller for much of the race,
finishing ahead of him by 0.438 of a second. Wimmer finished third.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Sauter raced his three sons, Jay, Tim and Johnny, in the race
to mark only the second time in NASCAR history that four family
members competed together.</TE>
<TE>   Tim finished ninth, Johnny 12th and Jay 13th. Jim pulled out after
200 of the 250 laps because of brake trouble.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kenny Bernstein earned his first victory at the home track of his
sponsor, winning the top fuel division at the NHRA Sears Craftsman
Nationals in Madison, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Bernstein turned in a 5.056-second pass at 293.22 mph in his
Budweiser King Dragster to beat Andrew Cowins' 5.291 run at 263.87 in
the NY Yankee Dragster.</TE>
<TE>   John Force won the funny car division and Jeg Coughlin won the pro
stock category.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Doug Stewart of Malibu has proven himself at every level of the
USTA Southern California junior sectional tennis tournament over the
years.</TE>
<TE>   He proved he's ready for the next one with a 6-0, 6-2 victory over
Derrick Bauer of Marina del Rey in the boys' 18 division championship
match at Los Caballeros Racquet and Sports Club in Fountain Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Singer of Laguna Niguel won the boys' 16 title with a 3-6,
7-5, 6-3 victory over Sergy Vagramian of Glendale. Cosmina Ciobanu of
Brea, a 13-year-old who will be a freshman at Fullerton Troy in the
fall, defeated Alli Krasnopolsky of Los Angeles, 6-1, 6-3, to win the
girls' 16 championship.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tomislav Primorac scored an extra-man goal with two seconds left
to give Croatia a 10-9 winover the United States before 1,375 in a
FINA World League water polo match at the National Aquatic Complex in
Los Alamitos.</TE>
<TE>   Igor Hinic scored his second goal of the game halfway through the
fourth quarter to give Croatia its first lead, 9-8. With 11 seconds
left, Layne Beaubien was ejected, giving Croatia a man-advantage
opportunity. Primorac then scored the winning goal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An 11-year-old boy who collapsed and died while waiting to bat at
his ballgame Saturday in Berea, Ohio, died of heart failure,
according to preliminary autopsy results.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Mallone, of Berea, was taken to Southwest General Health
Center where he was declared dead, Fire Capt. Jim Clancy said.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses at the Berea Baseball Assn. game said the boy was in the
on-deck circle waiting to bat when he collapsed, according to Clancy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Fendt of Germany retained his position as president of the
International Luge Federation, beating American Dwight Bell. Fendt
was re-elected to a third four-year term during the organization's
50th annual congress at St. Wolfgang, Austria.</TE>

<HD>Kings, Ducks in Background</HD>
<DH>NHL: Cost-conscious area teams don't figure to be involved
as bidding for top unrestricted free agents begins today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sooner or later, the NHL's top free agents are going to figure out
that Southern California is the place to be and that it's cool to
play for less money because of the region's favorable weather and
atmosphere.</LD>
<LD>   At least that's what the Kings and Mighty Ducks are hoping.</LD>
<LD>   Just don't expect it to happen this summer, especially with a
potential work stoppage looming when the collective bargaining
agreement expires in two years.</LD>
<TE>   This summer's crop of free agents may not catch your eye right
away, but when you take a second look, there are plenty of players
who could make a difference between winning and losing for many teams
next season.</TE>
<TE>   Barring any late deals, forwards Bill Guerin, Tony Amonte, Teemu
Selanne and Bobby Holik, goaltenders Curtis Joseph, Ed Belfour, Byron
Dafoe and Mike Richter, along with defenseman Darius Kasparaitis,
head the list of players who become unrestricted free agents today.</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Bret Hedican could have joined them but chose instead
to re-sign Sunday with the Carolina Hurricanes for an estimated $18
million over six years.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings and Ducks aren't expected to be pursuing the top players
because neither wants to get into a bidding war against such
big-money teams as the New York Rangers, Detroit Red Wings, Colorado
Avalanche and Dallas Stars.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings' biggest splash of the summer probably came when they
exercised their option on goalie Felix Potvin last week.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings also exercised the buyout provision on Nelson Emerson's
contract, making the veteran forward an unrestricted free agent.</TE>
<TE>   Emerson, who will turn 35 on Aug. 17, was slowed by
post-concussion syndrome last season, playing in a career-low 41
games and contributing a career-low seven points, and was due to be
paid $2 million next season. His career totals include 195 goals and
488 points in 771 games.</TE>
<TE>   Also unrestricted free agents today after failing to reach terms
with the Kings are defenseman Philippe Boucher, 29, and winger Kelly
Buchberger, 35.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Kariya is a restricted free agent, meaning the Ducks could
lose him only if they don't match any contract offer he signs with
another team.</TE>
<TE>   In previous years, restricted free agents have not received much
attention. With NHL rules calling for five first-round draft picks as
compensation--as long as a team's payroll isn't too high--most teams
have usually decided that the price for available talent was too
steep.</TE>
<TE>   This summer may be different. There's a strong core of players who
may be worth the price because of their youth. Scoring champion
Jarome Iginla, who may be too costly for the cash-strapped Calgary
Flames, Hart Trophy winner Jose Theodore of Montreal, the league's
top young goalie, and Kariya are considered franchise players who are
restricted free agents.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings and Ducks are likely to give most of their attention to
free agents who may not demand top dollar but will have plenty of
competition for their services.</TE>
<TE>   The King would love to re-sign Boucher, unless the Stars beat them
to him.</TE>
<TE>   Boucher is expected to be in demand because of his affordability,
but the Stars' free-spending owner Tom Hicks is expected to drive up
the price for many mid-range free agents.</TE>
<TE>   Hicks not only has his sights set on big-time free agents such as
Guerin, Holik and Amonte, but he also has eyes for such players as
Boucher, Pittsburgh's Robert Lang, Vancouver's Andrew Cassels, St.
Louis' Scott Young and Dallas' Randy McKay.</TE>
<TE>   Iginla's situation will be followed closely. The Flames need
Iginla and in some ways, so does Canada. If Iginla remains with
small-market Calgary, Canadian fans will proclaim a huge victory in
keeping one of the league's top stars home.</TE>
<TE>   But if Iginla signs an astronomical deal with a team like the
Rangers or Red Wings, there will be complaints that there's no way a
non-U.S. team can truly compete for the Stanley Cup. The complaints
won't just be heard in Calgary but also in Edmonton, Ottawa and
Vancouver.</TE>
<TE>   Iginla and the Flames wanted to reach a deal before today. Both
sides still hope that an extension can be finalized, but things will
start to get heated if it's not done before late August because
that's when Iginla said he'll start to feel pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Another player to watch is Joseph, who turned down an offer from
Toronto. The Maple Leafs, ineligible to receive a compensatory pick
because of their high payroll, traded his rights to Calgary for a
2004 conditional draft pick.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings, who lost Dominik Hasek to retirement, are
interested in Joseph but may not be willing to pay his asking price.
Joseph could end up with the Rangers, who traded Richter's rights to
Edmonton for an undisclosed draft pick late Sunday.</TE>

<HD>Reds Rally to Tie for Division Lead</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Last month, the Cincinnati Reds blew an eight-run lead against the
St. Louis Cardinals. On Sunday, they got even.</LD>
<LD>   Reggie Taylor and Todd Walker hit two-run singles off Jason
Isringhausen in the ninth inning as the Reds rallied from six runs
down in the first inning for a 12-8 victory in the finale of a
three-game National League Central showdown.</LD>
<LD>   The first time, when the Reds blew an 8-0 first-inning lead in a
10-8 loss May 12, was their biggest collapse of the year. This was
their biggest comeback.</LD>
<TE>   "I think in the back of our minds that's been on our minds the
whole year," said Walker, who had four runs batted in. "For this win
to happen the way it did, I think it gives us a little justice."</TE>
<TE>   The Reds won two of three to move into a first-place tie with the
Cardinals, who have lost three of four. The Cardinals have lost the
finale in nine of their last 10 series.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'm like one of our fans--brokenhearted," Manager Tony La
Russa said. "Sometimes you break their hearts and sometimes they
break yours."</TE>
<TE>   A two-run double by Albert Pujols started a six-run first inning
for the Cardinals, who also got two-run homers from Tino Martinez and
Mike DiFelice.</TE>
<TE>   The Reds trailed, 8-6, entering the ninth before chasing
Isringhausen (2-1), who blew his second save in his last three games.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor's two-run single with one out tied the score and Walker,
hitless in 10 at-bats the first two games of the series, put the Reds
ahead by two with his fourth hit.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Sullivan (5-2) gave up one run and four hits in three
innings, striking out five and walking one.</TE>
<TE>   Pujols has 24 RBIs in 24 games this month. He's batting .395 (17
for 43) against the Reds with three homers and eight RBIs in 12
games.</TE>
<TE>   Home plate umpire Kerwin Danley collapsed after four innings when
the temperature on the field reached 95 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Danley was down for several minutes with cold towels wrapped
around his head, and had to be assisted from the field by two
Cardinal trainers.</TE>
<TE>   Danley, 41, never lost consciousness and said he felt better after
going inside. A three-man crew finished the game.</TE>

<HD>Greene Is Defeated in 100 Again</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SHEFFIELD, England</DL>
<LD>Dwain Chambers beat world record-holder Maurice Greene for the second
time in 48 hours, winning the 100 meters Sunday at the IAAF Norwich
Union Grand Prix Classic.</LD>
<LD>   Chambers followed his victory over Greene at the Bislett Games in
Oslo on Friday by leading a British sweep of the top three spots.</LD>
<LD>   Chambers stormed out of the blocks to lead the Olympic and world
champion at 50 meters and finished with a winning time of 9.95
seconds. Greene, who seemed to slow down after Chambers went past
him, finished sixth in 10.24.</LD>
<TE>   Greene lost consecutive races for the first time since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Chambers ran under 10 seconds for the first time this season.
Because of a tailwind, his time will not replace his official
personal best of 9.97.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Lewis-Francis finished second in 9.97. Jason Gardener was
third in 10.11.</TE>
<TE>   Chambers returned to the track 45 minutes after winning the 100
but finished second behind four-time Olympic silver medallist Frankie
Fredericks of Namibia in the 200. Fredericks won in 20.29 and
Chambers finished in 20.38.</TE>

<HD>Ronaldo Basks in Redemption</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>YOKOHAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>As the rain continued to fall, mingling with the glittering silver
confetti and rainbow-colored origami that floated around him, Ronaldo
squinted into the night and made a remarkable personal discovery.</LD>
<LD>   The World Cup isn't so heavy after all.</LD>
<LD>   Only 11 pounds, barely a foot tall, it's surprising easy to lift,
even after you've spent five weeks running all over Japan and South
Korea, on a bad thigh and a surgically rebuilt knee, trying to escape
the haunting memories of a lost weekend spent in Paris four years
earlier.</LD>
<TE>   Ronaldo clutched the trophy with both hands and held it over his
head, basking in Brazil's 2-0 triumph over Germany. It was quite a
change of pace from 1998, when the World Cup gripped Ronaldo so
tightly, he could barely function.</TE>
<TE>   On the morning of the 1998 World Cup final, Ronaldo lay in his
hotel bed, convulsing so violently his roommate, Roberto Carlos,
thought he was possessed. Carlos summoned another teammate from
across the hall, Cesar Sampaio, who reportedly saved Ronaldo's life
by keeping him from swallowing his tongue.</TE>
<TE>   Then 21, Ronaldo already was one of the richest and most famous
athletes in the world, twice selected soccer's world player of the
year. He was the reason Nike had poured hundreds of millions of
dollars into the Brazilian national team. He was the reason Brazil
was favored to defeat France that evening to claim its second
consecutive world championship.</TE>
<TE>   He was also a big, frightened kid, so scared of letting down his
country and his sponsors that he had doctors pump his throbbing knee
full of pain-killing drugs, so consumed by the pressure to produce
that his body quaked from the nervous overload.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo played that night in Paris, barely so. Looking spent and
timid, he appeared to sleepwalk through the match. Following his
lead, as it usually did, Brazil went down with scarcely a whimper,
losing, 3-0.</TE>
<TE>   Four years later, Ronaldo arrived in Asia with those numbers all
but tattooed on his forehead. Every time he was asked about it, which
was often, Ronaldo would either feign amnesia--I don't remember what
happened, he'd repeat--or ask for another question.</TE>
<TE>   Until Sunday night at Yokohama International Stadium, when Ronaldo
took another tack: put up two goals in the final, maybe shut some
people up.</TE>
<TE>   And if the first goal was something less than vintage Ronaldo--a
scruffy rebound, made possible only by German goalkeeper Oliver
Kahn's first mistake this tournament--it simply underscored how much
things had changed since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   This is a very different Ronaldo, still not fully recovered from
two knee surgeries that sidelined him for nearly three of the four
years between World Cups.</TE>
<TE>   Further hampered by a thigh injury he sustained in the
quarterfinals, Ronaldo wasn't going to blow by any defenders Sunday,
not even the plodders Germany regularly stacks around its goal,
hoping that Kahn stops everything that falls through the cracks.</TE>
<TE>   Here, Ronaldo has had to get by on guile. A toe-poke to defeat
Turkey in the semifinal, a rebound to break open a defensive quagmire
in the final. That's not Brazilian samba soccer. That's ... that's
... Germany!</TE>
<TE>   But no one wearing a yellow shirt was volunteering to throw it
back. This is a different Ronaldo, this is a different Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo's second goal was more like it: A right-side cross from
Kleberson across the top of the penalty area and a perfectly executed
dummy by Rivaldo, who let the ball skip past him to an unmarked
Ronaldo, who hammered a low 17-yard strike that beat Kahn just inside
the right post.</TE>
<TE>   Two goals in 12 minutes. Against a goalkeeper who had given up
only one goal in the previous 606.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the wildest dream," Ronaldo said. "I haven't had the time to
think about it. It's so marvelous. I am so happy."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe a little too happy.</TE>
<TE>   Winning the World Cup, Ronaldo said, "is better than sex ... Both
are hard to [do] without, but I am sure that sex would not be so
rewarding as the World Cup."</TE>
<TE>   This raised the eyebrows of hundreds of journalists, including
even the soccer-obsessed Brazilians.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo laughed and figured he'd better elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   "Sex I am going to do in a few moments," he said, laughing some
more. "But nothing can be so rewarding as the World Cup. Not that sex
is not good. But you see, a World Cup is only every four years. Sex
is not."</TE>
<TE>   The FIFA official overseeing the interview figured it was time for
another question. Anyone ... please.</TE>
<TE>   On short notice, the best anyone could muster was another mention
of 1998, asking Ronaldo to compare two performances separated by much
more than only four years.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have any debt with the Brazilian people," Ronaldo
tersely said. "I did not have any feeling that I owed them from
1998."</TE>
<TE>   Either way, consider the books balanced. Ronaldo led all scorers
at the 2002 World Cup, totaling eight in seven matches, all of them
Brazil victories. He has 12 career World Cup goals, tying him with
Pele and leaving him two short of Gerd Muller's all-time record.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo is 25. Knees willing, he should have at least one more
World Cup in him.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a very ambitious person," he said. "I will go for it."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, no success story this unlikely comes without a price.
And that price will come out of the scalps of thousands of young
Brazilian men, who already have begun following their hero to the
barber's chair to recreate Ronaldo's triangular-wedge cut.</TE>
<TE>   For days, soccer fans in Japan have been scratching their heads,
wondering what was happening on top of Ronaldo's, and inside it as
well. But now, after a historic night in Yokohama, at least the thing
has a proper name.</TE>
<TE>   The Pyramid of Success.</TE>

<TE>   Ronaldo's Goals</TE>
<TE>   1 vs. Turkey, June 3--Met a cross from Rivaldo on the right side
with a lunging volley from six meters, to tie the score, 1-1, in the
50th minute.</TE>
<TE>   2 vs. China, June 8--Took a pass from Cafu in the goal area and
tapped in an easy score to cap a 4-0 victory.</TE>
<TE>   3 vs. Costa Rica, June 13--Gave Brazil a 1-0 lead in the 10th
minute, taking a centering pass from Edilson and hitting a shot that
glanced off defender Luis Marin on its way into the goal.</TE>
<TE>   4 vs. Costa Rica, June 13--Three minutes after his first goal,
received a corner kick, fought off a defender and slotted a shot from
six meters between goalkeeper Erick Lonnis and the near post.</TE>
<TE>   5 vs. Belgium, June 17--Took a pass from Kleberson, who had broken
down the right side, and beat goalkeeper Geert De Vlieger in the 87th
minute for the clinching goal in a 2-0 victory.</TE>
<TE>   6 vs. Turkey, June 26--Dribbled through four defenders, then
finished with a toe poke to the far post past goalkeeper Rustu Recber
for the game's only goal four minutes into the second half.</TE>
<TE>   7 vs. Germany, June 30--Scored off a rebound in the 67th minute
after goalkeeper Oliver Kahn stopped but failed to control a hard
shot by Rivaldo.</TE>
<TE>   8 vs. Germany, June 30--Took a pass from Kleberson, courtesy of a
dummy by Rivaldo, just outside the goal area and beat Kahn with a
shot just inside the right post.</TE>

<DL>MEMPHIS, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>Len Mattiace had played very well at the St. Jude Classic, yet he
started the final round so far back he didn't bother checking a
leaderboard Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Mattiace won for the second time this year as he rallied from a
seven-stroke deficit by shooting a seven-under 64 to win the
tournament by a stroke.</LD>
<LD>   He pulled off the largest come-from-behind victory since Davis
Love III rallied from seven behind in 2001 to win at Pebble Beach.</LD>
<TE>   "I didn't look at the leaderboard. I didn't feel like I needed
to," Mattiace said.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I just needed to keep making birdies, so why look? I
looked on the 18th green and saw I had a two-shot lead at that time
and just tried to two-putt."</TE>
<TE>   Mattiace had a mistake-free day and turned in a bogey-free,
seven-birdie round that included five birdies on the back nine for an
18-under-par 266 and the $684,000 winner's check.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Petrovic, who shot a 68, finished second at 267.</TE>
<TE>   With the victory, Mattiace, who won the Nissan Open in February,
joined Tiger Woods (three) and Phil Mickelson (two) as the only
multiple winners on tour this year.</TE>

<LD>This series was about the Angels. It had to be.</LD>
<LD>   It had to be about the Angels staying close to the Seattle
Mariners and ahead of the Oakland A's. It had to be about the Angels
digging in and winning a crucial series, about the Angels making sure
they are part of the buzz as the All-Star game approaches.</LD>
<LD>   It had to be about the Angels gathering themselves after a
disappointing opening loss Friday. It had to be about the Angels
getting superb pitching two nights in a row against the Dodgers, who
had the best record in the National League until this loss.</LD>
<TE>   This had to be about the Angels convincing themselves that they
can win against good teams. Most of their fabulous recovery from a
6-14 start has come against the lesser teams of baseball. Much of
July and August will be spent playing the best American League
teams--Seattle, Oakland, Minnesota, the Yankees, the Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers had won their last nine series. They took sets from
Boston and Anaheim. They are in first place. Not by so much that
losing doesn't matter, but by enough so that it's not
season-threatening to have another team win two of three.</TE>
<TE>   Once only a game behind the Mariners, the Angels had come home
after a .500 trip trailing Seattle by 4 1/2 games. When you start the
season 6-14, you can't afford many .500 stretches.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming off that tough road trip," Tim Salmon said, "it is a big
deal to us to play really well, really solid and to win a series
against a team hitting the ball well, to beat a very tough pitcher.
When it gets down to it, we're in a very tough division and we're
going to have to beat a lot of very tough teams."</TE>
<TE>   This game, this 5-1 victory in front of a sellout crowd on a day
when the Dodgers sent out newly minted All-Star pitcher Odalis Perez,
came thanks to the unknowns.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie pitcher John Lackey, making his second major league start
and his first at home, was a nerveless competitor who fought his
wildness in the sixth inning. Lackey had allowed consecutive walks
after giving up a double. Bases were loaded, there was only one out.
The 23-year-old kicked at the dirt, stepped back, took his time, made
himself calm down. He got two groundouts, only one run scored, and
among his teammates Lackey earned respect.</TE>
<TE>   "That showed a lot of maturity," Benji Gil said.</TE>
<TE>   Gil had homered in the second inning, a three-run shot that gave
the Angels the 5-0 lead and the last runs they came close to scoring
off Perez. It was Gil's first homer of the season. It is the kind of
contribution good teams need from the non-stars.</TE>
<TE>   And Ben Weber was kind enough to give Lackey the ball at the end
of the game. Weber got his first career save. It might have made a
nice memento for Weber too, but it was given to the new kid.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shot in the arm," Salmon said after watching Lackey act as
if he belonged in the big leagues. "We're in a fortunate position of
having a lot of pitchers. When you've got a righty who can come out
and throw three hard pitches, it's great. With this kid, the game
goes fast. All of a sudden four, five innings have gone by, you look
up and think, 'Wow, not much has happened.' "</TE>
<TE>   The Angels need Lackey because the Mariners and the A's have
pitching. Great pitching. The A's have an All-Star pitcher, Barry
Zito. The Mariners have two, Freddy Garcia and Kazuhiro Sasaki.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels needed this series because they see in front of them a
newly healthy Seattle. Edgar Martinez is back and feisty and swinging
a very smart bat.</TE>
<TE>   They feel behind them Oakland surging. After sending the other
Giambi (Jeremy) to Philadelphia, it is as if the A's shed their
winter skin. They can't seem to lose. They were supposed to have
given up when Jeremy was sent off. Now they are only a game and a
half behind the Angels, who are 3 1/2 behind Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels needed this victory because Seattle lost Sunday and
Oakland won.</TE>
<TE>   "On the one hand," Salmon said, "it's too big a picture to make
one loss important. On the other hand, on a day when you can pick up
ground on the Mariners, it's a good win. On the one hand, we have
plenty of time and lots of games against the Mariners and A's. On the
other hand, we want to be close enough that those games count."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers head off to play at Arizona and St. Louis, and that's
a tough trip.</TE>
<TE>   It is this week, against the Diamondbacks and Cardinals, that the
Dodgers need to win, more than they did against the Angels this
weekend</TE>
<TE>   . "It's a challenging week," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said. "We
have a great opportunity to make a loud statement [before the
All-Star break] and then to continue to make it after the break."</TE>
<TE>   Beginning July 15, the Angels play 20 consecutive games against
either Seattle or the A's; against first-place Minnesota; against the
first-place Yankees; against the struggling Red Sox, who seem aimed
for wild-card contention with either the Angels or A's. It will be
the start of a brutal finish. In September the Angels will have 14
games against Oakland and Seattle; at the end of August they have a
seven-game trip to New York and Boston.</TE>
<TE>   That's the big picture Salmon talked about. That's why this series
had to be about the Angels. They need to know they can win big
series. This was a big series. They won.</TE>

<HD>Sparks' Streak Is Over</HD>
<DH>WNBA: L.A. falls to Houston, 60-58, for first
regular-season home loss in nearly two years. Cooper criticizes
Leslie.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Sparks and Comets claim it's just another game when they face
each other.</LD>
<LD>   So why does the winner walk away with an air of great satisfaction
and the loser looks as if she just drank a bottle of Tabasco sauce?</LD>
<LD>   Sunday, it was the Sparks who were left gagging, as they fell to
Houston, 60-58, before a sold-out Staples Center crowd of 13,141.</LD>
<TE>   The Sparks' loss ended their nine-game overall win streak and
their league-record, regular-season 28-game home win streak. (The
Sparks had dropped an 80-60 playoff decision to Sacramento at home
last year.)</TE>
<TE>   It was the first regular-season home defeat for the Sparks since
July 11, 2000, when Portland beat them, 80-77, at the Forum.</TE>
<TE>   Houston's victory was its sixth in a row, bringing the Comets
(12-3) within a half-game of the Sparks (12-2) in the WNBA's Western
Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Since neither team could shoot Sunday--the Sparks flailed away at
39% (23 for 59) and Houston was worse at 32% (18 for 56)--a victory
had to come from other avenues. Houston found them. First the Comets
locked up the rebounds, 37-29 (including a 14-8 difference on
offense). And at the free-throw line, the Comets made 21 of 25,
including 14 of 15 from Sheryl Swoopes, who had a game-high 20
points. The Sparks made eight of 14 free throws.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have two good teams coming together, you have to do the
little things that make the difference," said Houston center Tiffani
Johnson, who had a game-high 14 rebounds. "We had talked about
limiting them on the offensive boards, going after all the
deflections. L.A. is a great rebounding team, and they're very big,
so we thought if we could limit them on the boards we'd have a good
chance to win."</TE>
<TE>   The plan was perfect. The Sparks, who had a 25-24 halftime lead,
couldn't control the glass, so their offense had no rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   And Houston, whose 63.7 scoring average ranks 14th (out of 16
teams), kept the pace of the game as slow as chess by mail.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks' Lisa Leslie, who had three fouls in the first half,
and her fifth foul with 4:21 left in the game, was limited to seven
points , one rebound and four turnovers in 32 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Spark Coach Michael Cooper didn't mince words about his star
center: "It was the worst I've seen her in my three years here. She
didn't come ready to play." When asked why, Cooper replied, "You have
to ask her about that."</TE>
<TE>   Leslie accepted Cooper's criticism calmly. "Being a team captain I
have more responsibility when we lose," she said. "If he wants to
point the finger at me, here I am."</TE>
<TE>   Other Sparks spoke up in Leslie's defense.</TE>
<TE>   "She should be allowed one bad game. Nobody's perfect," said
Tamecka Dixon, who had 12 points. "We lost the game. We take it,
learn from it, get better."</TE>
<TE>   But DeLisha Milton, who had 14 points, went on to say what others
were feeling. "We didn't have the second effort today. We were
outhustled the entire game. And it really sticks in the craw when it
happens against that team."</TE>
<TE>   Led by Mwadi Mabika, who had a team-high 18 points, the Sparks had
one spurt when they went from a 33-29 deficit in the second half to a
46-37 lead with 8:50 to play. But Houston did not let the gap grow
wider than nine. The Comets reclaimed the lead at 52-50 when Johnson
put back a missed shot by Swoopes with 3:55 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Sparks tied the score two more times, they never
regained the lead.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to give a lot of credit to Houston. They put the bill to
us," Cooper said. "This [loss] does not make or break our season. But
we have three days of practice coming up, and we will work on some
things."</TE>
<TE>   Swoopes had about as bad a 20-point game as you can have. She made
three of 20 shots from the field and did not make a field goal in the
second half, but she made three free throws in the final 16 seconds
that helped put the victory away.</TE>
<TE>   "My shot wasn't there, so I had to find other ways to score,"
Swoopes said. "I will shoot three for 20 any day if we can get a
win."</TE>

<HD>Star Count: Dodgers 3, Angels 1</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Green, Perez and Gagne are named to NL team;
Anderson is added to AL squad.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Outfielder Shawn Green and pitchers Odalis Perez and Eric Gagne of
the Dodgers, and outfielder Garret Anderson of the Angels were chosen
Sunday to play in the 73rd major league All-Star game July 9 at
Miller Park in Milwaukee.</LD>
<LD>   All were selected as reserves by National League Manager Bob
Brenly and American League Manager Joe Torre after fans voted in the
starters.</LD>
<LD>   "The fact that we have three guys that made the club is a tribute
in a way to what has taken place here through the first half of the
season," said Manager Jim Tracy, who has the Dodgers in first place
in the NL West.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier this week, Tracy and Angel Manager Mike Scioscia were
selected as coaches for the NL and AL teams, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   This will be the second All-Star game for Green, who played for
the AL team in 1999 as a member of the Toronto Blue Jays.</TE>
<TE>   Green, who sat out Sunday's game against the Angels because of a
jammed left thumb, got off to a slow start this season but has
rebounded to bat .281 with 25 home runs and 63 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought for sure after the first six weeks of the season that I
would have three days off [during the All-Star break], so I'm
enjoying the fact that things turned around," Green said.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne, who leads the majors with 29 saves; Perez, who is 9-4 with
a 2.56 earned-run average, and Anderson, who is batting .298 with 15
homers and 60 RBIs, are among 25 players making their first All-Star
appearance.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I kind of play things down a little bit, but this is
something from a personal standpoint I am really excited about and
looking forward to," said Anderson, who celebrated his 30th birthday
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Mariner outfielder Ichiro Suzuki received 2,516,016 votes,
the most of any player for the second consecutive year. Chicago Cub
outfielder Sammy Sosa led the NL with 2,140,315. Sosa also was the
leading NL vote-getter in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Brenly selected six of his Arizona Diamondback players as
reserves. Torre had three of his New York Yankee players chosen by
fans and selected three more as reserves.</TE>
<TE>   The Boston Red Sox were the only other team with more than three
players on an All-Star team.</TE>
<TE>   The AL starters are catcher Jorge Posada, first baseman Jason
Giambi and second baseman Alfonso Soriano of the Yankees, shortstop
Alex Rodriguez of the Texas Rangers and third baseman Shea
Hillenbrand of the Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Suzuki, Manny Ramirez of the Red Sox and Torii Hunter of the
Minnesota Twins are the outfielders.</TE>
<TE>   The nine-man pitching staff features starters Derek Lowe and Pedro
Martinez of the Red Sox, Mark Buehrle of the White Sox, Freddy Garcia
of the Mariners, Roy Halladay of the Blue Jays and Barry Zito of the
Athletics.</TE>
<TE>   The closers are Eddie Guardado of the Twins, Mariano Rivera of the
Yankees and Kazuhiro Sasaki of the Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   The starting infield for the NL will be catcher Mike Piazza of the
New York Mets, first baseman Todd Helton of the Colorado Rockies,
second baseman Jose Vidro of the Montreal Expos, and third baseman
Scott Rolen and shortstop Jimmy Rollins of the Philadelphia Phillies.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants and Vladamir Guerrero of
the Expos join Sosa in the outfield.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Perez and Gagne, the NL pitching staff includes Tom
Glavine and John Smoltz of the Atlanta Braves, Trevor Hoffman of the
San Diego Padres, Randy Johnson, Curt Schilling and Byung-Hyun Kim of
the Diamondbacks, Matt Morris of the St. Louis Cardinals and Mike
Williams of the Pittsburgh Pirates.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to say I'm a superstar, but I deserve to be there
because I've been working hard," said Perez, a 24-year-old
left-hander who was acquired along with outfielder Brian Jordan from
the Atlanta Braves in a January trade for Gary Sheffield.</TE>
<TE>   One spot on each team is still to be determined by fan voting on
the Internet over the next two days at MLB.com and ESPN.com.</TE>
<TE>   Angel outfielder Darin Erstad, Cleveland first baseman Jim Thome,
Oakland third baseman Eric Chavez, Boston outfielder Johnny Damon and
Chicago outfielder Magglio Ordonez are the candidates in the AL.</TE>
<TE>   Versatile St. Louis infielder/outfielder Albert Pujols, San Diego
outfielder Ryan Klesko, Colorado outfielder Larry Walker, Pittsburgh
outfielder Brian Giles and Atlanta outfielder Andruw Jones are NL
candidates.</TE>

<DL>WIMBLEDON, England</DL>
<LD>What are Feliciano Lopez and Andre Sa doing in the final 16 at
Wimbledon?</LD>
<LD>   We thought they would be getting ready for some clay-court
tournament in Europe. Or isn't there some challenger event going on
in Chile?</LD>
<LD>   Everyone is chalking up the inclusion of folks such as Lopez, Sa,
David Nalbandian, Jan Vacek and Michel Kratochvil in the fourth round
as some weird oddity at Wimbledon. Stuff happens, even on grass.</LD>
<TE>   But put it this way: One of these players--Nalbandian, Wayne
Arthurs, Nicolas Lapentti or Arnaud Clement--will be in the
semifinals at Wimbledon. Nalbandian had never played here, and
Lapentti had won only two matches here in five previous appearances.
Arthurs and Clement have each reached the fourth round once.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the Australian Open in January should have been the first
clue, when Jiri Novak and Stefan Koubek landed in the quarterfinals.
Surprises were about to become the reality in the men's game, not the
exception.</TE>
<TE>   There have been eight different male winners of the last eight
Grand Slams, and No. 1-seeded Lleyton Hewitt of Australia is the only
one who could prevent it from being nine of the last nine. None of
the quarterfinalists at the French Open--Guillermo Canas, Albert
Costa, Andrei Pavel, Alex Corretja, Juan Carlos Ferrero, Andre
Agassi, Sebastien Grosjean and Marat Safin--remain at Wimbledon.
Costa, Corretja and Grosjean didn't even make the trip.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, Costa had a valid reason. After winning the French Open,
he was married to the mother of his twin daughters, and Corretja was
in the wedding.</TE>
<TE>   More and more, players are skipping this tournament for various
reasons, or showing up with little or no grass-court preparation as
far as tournament play. Wimbledon is in danger of slipping from its
lofty status as the world's most prestigious tournament.</TE>
<TE>   The Guardian newspaper ran pictures Saturday of Nalbandian, Xavier
Malisse, Clement and Arthurs, asking: "Would you queue all night to
watch these players?"</TE>
<TE>   Tim Henman could reach the semifinals with victories over
Kratochvil and the Sa-Lopez winner. It doesn't exactly carry the same
weight as Goran Ivanisevic having to beat Greg Rusedski and Safin to
reach the final four last year.</TE>
<TE>   What the Grand Slams need to do to maintain Wimbledon's relevance
is create more space between the French Open and Wimbledon. This is
already being considered and could happen as early as next year.
Three weeks, instead of the current two, is the time frame being
proposed. Four would be much better.</TE>
<TE>   It has always been a significant question: Why are two of the four
Grand Slams shoehorned into such a narrow time frame? French Open
finalist Ferrero said that a player who performs well at Roland
Garros has almost no chance of recovering and preparing properly for
Wimbledon. Results have proven him correct.</TE>
<TE>   Every other Slam has a decent lead-in period, and some might say
that the clay-court season is too long, anyway. U.S. Open officials
are trying to create more excitement around a more cohesive
hard-court season, wanting to showcase events combining men's and
women's tournaments or tournaments in back-to-back weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Here, with the public's considerable appetite for tennis, a
four-week grass-court season leading into Wimbledon could heighten
awareness and generate interest. Neither Venus nor Serena Williams
played a grass-court tuneup event--which hasn't seemed to hurt
them--but a longer season may persuade one or both to show up for a
tournament in England, Germany or the Netherlands.</TE>
<TE>   Second-Week Story Lines</TE>
<TE>   Best Possible Men's Result:</TE>
<TE>   * Henman title. No longer would we have to read about Fred Perry
being the last British man to win Wimbledon.</TE>
<TE>   * Rusedski beating Henman in the final. This might appeal to the
delicious sense of British irony, the Canadian-born man beating the
most British of players. Imagine the sense of strife on Henman
Hill/Rusedski Ridge?</TE>
<TE>   Best Possible Women's Result:</TE>
<TE>   * Monica Seles winning her first Grand Slam title since the 1996
Australian Open. Seles, even in her prime, only reached the final at
Wimbledon once. But we can all have one wish, right?</TE>
<TE>   * A decent final between Venus and Serena Williams. It doesn't
matter whether Venus wins her third consecutive Wimbledon title or
Serena becomes the first female since Steffi Graf to win the French
Open-Wimbledon double in the same year. Quite simply, a hard-fought
match would suffice and would end concern voiced by some about
Williams vs. Williams hurting women's tennis.</TE>
<TE>   Calling Danielle Steel</TE>
<TE>   There are well-known bad Hemingway writings contests. Today, we
offer a new category, bad Harlequin Sportswriting.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Pierce's match against qualifier Laura Granville brought
forth this excerpt in one leading British paper on Saturday:</TE>
<TE>   "Beneath the pale skin of tennis's ice queen lies a crackling
Gallic spirit just aching to burst through. It's what makes her so
exciting to watch. Though she holds herself stiffly and takes long,
slow strides, you know that the metamorphosis is just seconds away.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Hit it. Hit it. Hit it,' she shouted as if to a hard-of-hearing
schoolgirl. 'Just hit it.'</TE>
<TE>   "And she whacked the ball with all her fury but, as her temper
raged, so her precision waned."</TE>
<TE>   There's much, much more. But the idea comes across.</TE>

The title of "tournament's leading scorer" would seem lofty enough
for an event such as the World Cup, but leave it to FIFA to add some
glitz. Players now compete for The Golden Boot, given to the leading
scorer, as opposed to the Golden Ball, which goes to the most
outstanding player (and will be announced Tuesday). The top scorers
for all the Cups:
1930 GUILLERMO STABILE, Argentina 8
After sitting out Argentina's opener, Stabile got a chance to play
against Mexico when captain Manuel Ferreira had to return to Buenos
Aires to take a law school exam. Stabile scored a hat trick in that
game, and later scored twice in a semifinal victory over the United
States
1934 OLDRICH NEJEDLY, Czechoslovakia 5
A stylish forward for Sparta of Prague, Nejedly guided the Czechs
into the final by scoring an 83rd-minute winner in the quarterfinals
and all the goals in a 3-1 semifinal victory over Germany. The
Italians' physical play shut him down in the final
1938 LEONIDAS, Brazil 7
Leonidas scored a hat trick in Brazil's opener and wasn't the game's
leading scorer--Poland's Ernest Willimowski scored four in Brazil's
wild 6-5 victory. Inexplicably, Leonidas was held out of the
semifinals to rest for the final; the Brazilians didn't make it,
losing to Italy
1950 ADEMIR, Brazil 8
A star forward with Brazil's Vasco de Gama, Ademir teamed with Jair
and Zizinho in an offense that scored 22 goals in six games. But
after scoring four goals against Sweden, he was held scoreless in a
championship-game loss to Uruguay
1954 SANDOR KOCSIS, Hungary 11
One of the greatest scorers in soccer history, Kocsis had 75 goals in
68 internationals for the "Magical Magyars." He scored at least two
goals in each of his first four games but was shut out in a
championship-game loss to Germany
1958 JUST FONTAINE, France 13
The Moroccan-born Fontaine wasn't France's first choice, only playing
after Rene Bliard was injured. Partnering with standout playmaker
Raymond Kopa, he scored in all six of France's games, including four
in the third-place game
1962 SIX TIED 4
There likely weren't enough golden boots around to cover this group,
which included Florian Albert of Hungary, Valentin Ivanov of Russia,
Leonel Sanchez of Chile and Drazen Jerkovic of Yugoslavia. Garrincha
and Vava were also part of the group, leading Brazil to the title
1966 EUSEBIO, Portugal 9
Born in Mozambique, Eusebio starred for Benefica of Lisbon and later
in his career was a standout for Toronto of the NASL. He scored twice
in a victory over Brazil, and four times in the quarterfinals against
North Korea
1970 GERD MUELLER, Germany 10
The leading scorer for a career in the World Cup, Muller scored most
of his 14 goals in Mexico. He scored hat tricks against Bulgaria and
Peru, an overtime winner against England and two overtime goals in a
semifinal loss to Italy
1974 GRZEGORZ LATO, Poland 7
One of the stars of Poland's greatest generations of soccer players,
he scored twice in a victory over Argentina, had game-winning goals
against Sweden and Yugoslavia in second-round group play, and scored
a goal in the third-place game
1978 MARIO KEMPES, Argentina 6
The only foreign-based player who had been included in the host
nation's squad, Kempes was scoreless in first-round group play, but
finished with a flourish. In the final, his 104th-minute goal against
the Netherlands broke a 1-1 tie in overtime
1982 PAOLO ROSSI, Italy 6
Rossi started the World Cup under a cloud, having just come off a
suspension in a gambling scandal. But his hat trick against Brazil
and two goals in a championship victory over West Germany restored
him to hero status
1986 GARY LINEKER, England 6
Lineker was one of the top "poachers" of his era, a forward with a
nose for scoring goals. He scored a hat trick to singlehandedly beat
Poland, 3-0, then added two goals against Paraguay in the second
round and one in a loss to Argentina
1990 SALVATORE SCHILLACI, Italy 6
No one dealt better with the pressure of playing for Italy in an
Italian World Cup than Schillaci, a forward from Juventus of Turin,
who scored the winning goal in five games. He won the Golden Boot
with a penalty kick late in the third-place game
1994 OLEG SALENKO, Russia HRISTO STOICHKOV, Bulgaria 6
Neither player won their share of the Boot in a way that will inspire
legends. Salenko scored five of his six goals in one game against a
Cameroon team distracted by a feud with its national federation.
Stoichkov scored half of his goals on penalty kicks
1998 DAVOR SUKER, Croatia 6
Suker was the leader of the surprise team of the tournament. He
scored the lone goal in victories over Japan and Romania, and added
an 85th-minute goal to cap an upset of Germany. He won the scoring
title with a game-winning goal in the third-place game
2002 RONALDO, Brazil 8
After the failure of France '98 and two years of injuries, Ronaldo
promised to score in every game. He nearly did it, missing only in
the 2-1 victory against England. His two goals against Germany make
him only one of nine players to score at least that many in a final</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Playing without league-leading scorer Chamique Holdsclaw, the
Washington Mystics rallied from a 16-point first-half deficit to beat
the Charlotte Hornets, 56-55, Sunday before 18,372 at Washington.</LD>
<LD>   Holdsclaw was placed on the injured list before the game because
of a sprained left ankle she suffered during Friday night's game
against Portland. Holdsclaw will be eligible to return July 8 against
Orlando.</LD>
<LD>   "It's three games," Holdsclaw said. "The season is so long, and
we've been doing so well. I would probably be disappointed if we had
a losing record or something. But right now, I know that my teammates
can step up."</LD>
<TE>   Vicky Bullett did step up, making a three-point shot with 1:59
remaining that broke a 53-53 tie and lifted Washington to the
victory, its seventh consecutive at home.</TE>
<TE>   Ashja Jones led Washington (11-4) with 16 points. Andrea Stinson
led Charlotte (6-6) with 14 points.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 71, Sacramento 60--The Shock (1-13) rallied from an 18-0
deficit to end its WNBA-record 13-game losing streak with the victory
before 5,962 at Auburn Hills, Mich. Sacramento fell to 2-12.</TE>
<TE>   Portland 54, New York 44--Former Spark guard Ukari Figgs scored 21
points for the Fire (7-8), which held New York to three points over
the final 8:29 to beat the Liberty before 13,146 at New York. Crystal
Robinson had 17 points for the Liberty (8-8).</TE>
<TE>   Utah 79, Cleveland 62--Margo Dydek scored 19 points, grabbed 13
rebounds and keyed Utah's interior defense as the Starzz (9-4) won
before 7,129 at Cleveland. Ann Wauters scored 20 points for the
Rockers (6-7).</TE>
<TE>   Miami 65, Indiana 59-- Sheri Sam scored 19 points as the Sol (4-9)
won before 7,597, at Miami. Rita Williams scored 17 points for
Indiana (6-8).</TE>
