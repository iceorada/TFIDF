<HD>Looking for Mr. Goodheart in the Firehouse</HD>

<LD>"Has your taste in men changed?" I was making the rounds at a party
recently with my notebook at the ready.</LD>
<LD>   The woman understood my question. She had been reading these same
accounts about how manly sex appeal is undergoing a reevaluation. She
also had the forthrightness to say that what she sees in the media
doesn't necessarily reflect what her heart tells her.</LD>
<LD>   "No, not really," she replied.</LD>
<TE>   That's generally the response I'd been getting from women. I was
beginning to wonder if trend spotters weren't reaching too far. Then
this woman added, "But my feelings have changed about my son. If he
grew up wanting to be a fireman now, I'd feel differently."</TE>
<TE>   When mothers start talking about new aspirations for their sons,
it's a good sign that something is going on in the land.</TE>
<TE>   For one, I have my hopes. Maybe I will live to see the gentleman
resurgent. By that I mean a man who stands out by his purpose and the
manner in which he presents himself. The man who ignores the social
advice to "just be yourself" and instead strives to be something a
little better.</TE>
<TE>   It's not money but it is class that I'm talking about, and not
even class so much as one's principles and bearing. Few things in our
culture would cost so little and could get us so far, if only to
break the monotony of the last 20 years or so. Right, dude?</TE>
<TE>   Today's trend spotters in New York, in Washington, in Singapore,
in London, in Calgary--to name just a few--are generally discussing
the "new male" in terms of appearance. Thus, the hairy-chested man is
supposedly back. Slick is out. Women are said to be eyeing
firehouses, not Wall Street. Well, considering the state of the
economy and the gargantuan overtime paychecks of your average
fireman, I wonder if we don't simply have a case of digging for gold
in new locations. But I could be wrong, and these observations get us
only so far anyway.</TE>
<TE>   As I see it, half of being a man is what you are born with. If you
find yourself now possessing the "in" look, congratulations.</TE>
<TE>   But, fellows, before the rest of us rush out and get hair plugs
for our chests, let's consider the other half of manliness, that part
that we have some say in. Like the way we carry ourselves. And our
objectives.</TE>
<TE>   I'll take a stab at encapsulating what's really occurring: The
NYFD has gained respect over MBAs because firefighters displayed
selflessness, duty and honor. In threatening times, these attributes
no longer seem quaint but desirable. Some people run out of burning
buildings, some run in. Thank heavens for the courageous.</TE>
<TE>   That's it.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever trend emerges, or fails to emerge, has roots there. And
it's not strictly a matter of gender, either. Men change in tune with
the tastes of women according to the ageless quest for approval, so
this conversation is more accurately about cultural shifts.</TE>
<TE>   As it is, American life as reflected in athletics, commerce,
politics and show business is far too coarse. The Darwinian,
Reaganesque view that life is but brutal competition has exhausted
us. Coldbloodedness, the sneer, vulgarity, disdain, the knife in the
back, ostentation--attitude!--no longer define the novel, but the
ordinary. To stand out in this crowd anymore requires one to achieve,
truly, the monstrous. Think Enron.</TE>
<TE>   But just as people set trends, they become captive to them. So
even though there is widespread dissatisfaction with the values in
our culture, we have achieved only peripheral progress in the pursuit
of alternatives. Perhaps firefighters and tragedy have opened our
eyes to the possibility that a man just might be able to score a
touchdown with humility. Imagine the shock of that.</TE>
<TE>   Beneath the superficial, these inquiries about manliness speak to
our fundamental regard for each other. Decency, courtesy, kindness,
honor may be the codes by which some Americans live, but they have
not been the reigning imperatives of our pop culture. A man who finds
a bag of money on the shoulder of a highway is still portrayed in
headlines as strange, if not demented, for returning it.</TE>
<TE>   So, when I hear about the sex appeal of NYFD firefighters, I trust
that we are not speaking of goofy hats, Brooklyn accents, bitter and
sometimes bigoted union politics or tracking wet ashes into the
living room. And it's probably not a matter of hairy chests, either.
We are talking about what a mother wants for her son: a better heart
and a bigger purpose in life.</TE>

<HD>The Arab Tide Turns Against Bin Laden</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FAWAZ A. GERGES</AU>
<BD>Fawaz A. Gerges is a professor of Middle East and
international affairs at Sarah Lawrence College and author of the
forthcoming "The Islamists and the West" (Cambridge University
Press).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While the world awaits a determination of Osama bin Laden's fate,
many Arabs and Muslims are coming to terms with his destructive
legacy. Whether he is found dead or alive, he is unlikely to be
viewed as a hero or a martyr.</LD>
<LD>   The decisive military defeat handed to Bin Laden in Afghanistan
has discredited him in the eyes of most Arabs and has shattered his
well-constructed image as a holy warrior. He has lost the battle for
the hearts and minds of the "floating middle" of Muslim public
opinion.</LD>
<LD>   Even those Arab multitudes who initially flirted with Bin Ladenism
out of anger with the United States have now discovered that his
inflated rhetoric was more thin air than real. Not only did he not
put up a credible fight against the anti-Taliban forces and their
U.S. allies, but he lured thousands of deluded foot soldiers into a
deathtrap in Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   People in that part of the world are fed up with losers, who often
abuse their political naivete and who promise them the world only to
bring defeat and death in the end. Bin Laden's raw tribalism rings
true in Arab ears: "When people see a strong horse and a weak horse,
by nature they will like the strong horse."</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden proved to be less a strong horse than a paper tiger.</TE>
<TE>   As the dust settles on the field of battle in Afghanistan, Arabs
are recognizing the incalculable damage wrought by Bin Laden. With
the exception of a few naive souls intoxicated by the culture of
martyrdom, support for Bin Laden and his ilk appears to have
evaporated quicker than expected. Instead of seeing him as living up
to his claims of advancing the cause of Islam, Arab commentators
accuse him of hijacking a peaceful religion and making it, in the
eyes of many Westerners, synonymous with terrorism. They also blame
him for undermining the Palestinian cause.</TE>
<TE>   Equally important, Bin Laden's defiance and subsequent defeat will
also deepen the sense of Arab victimization and encourage Middle
Eastern regimes to suspend political reforms and crack down harder on
opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden had hoped that by killing thousands of innocent
Americans he could make the U.S. lash out angrily and murderously
against Muslims, thus precipitating a clash of civilizations. But the
Bush administration did not play into his hands, and the Muslim
community did not rise up. Although surveys showed that 40% of Arabs
sympathized with Bin Laden's criticism of the U.S. and the
pro-Western regimes it supports, they rejected his terrorist methods.</TE>
<TE>   Do not be misled by the noisy cheerleading for Bin Laden in some
Islamist quarters. Most Arabs and Muslims do not subscribe to Bin
Laden's apocalyptic nightmare and see through his inflammatory
rhetoric. It was only the majority's apathy that enabled the activist
pro-Bin Laden camp to misinform, propagandize and distort political
sensibilities in the Muslim arena.</TE>
<TE>   However, Bin Laden's loss of the propaganda war does not imply
that the United States has won. Poll results show that anti-American
sentiment is a staple of Arab politics. Today, to be politically
conscious in the Arab world is to be highly suspicious of the United
States, its foreign policies, values and institutions. In the eyes of
many Arabs and Muslims, Bin Laden or no Bin Laden, the United States
has become a scapegoat for the ills and misfortunes that befell their
world in the second half of the last century.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Ladenism taps into the Arab sense of victimization and the
deep reservoir of accumulated grievances against the United States.
With the Taliban vanquished and the Al Qaeda network in Afghanistan
destroyed, the challenge facing the U.S. is to tackle the deepening
anti-Americanism in the region by reassessing the efficacy and
fairness of its foreign policies.</TE>
<TE>   Yet there are limits to what U.S. policymakers can do to reduce
social discontent in the world of Islam. Arabs and Muslims must take
charge of their political destiny by seizing the initiative from Bin
Ladenism and charting a new liberal, humanist path. Blaming the
other--the West--is an easy escape from addressing the real
conditions that give rise to and sustain backwardness,
underdevelopment, extremism and intolerance.</TE>
<TE>   Will the defeat of Bin Ladenism serve as a catalyst for the Arabs
to rise to the challenge and fully join modernity?</TE>

<HD>Use Profiling Judiciously</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN TURLEY</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Turley is a law professor at George Washington
University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This week, profiling is under attack after a Secret Service officer
was removed from a flight on Christmas day. With the possible
exception of Afghan leader Hamid Karzai, American Airlines could not
have picked a worse person for an incident. The officer was an Arab
American on his way to join the security detail to protect President
Bush. The Secret Service officer immediately became the vehicle for a
full-court press by Arab American advocacy groups and civil
libertarians, who have had some legitimate grievances with the
security crackdown following the Sept. 11 attacks. However, with more
than 40 million people traveling each month by air, profiling may not
only be necessary but inevitable in the fight against terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   In this incident, the accounts from the pilot and the agent could
not be more different. To read the pilot's account, he was faced with
a "hostile" armed individual with suspiciously incomplete and
unreadable paperwork. To read the agent's account, he found himself
confronted by a pilot who could not overcome the mental block of an
armed Arab American on his airplane.</LD>
<TE>   One of these accounts is likely to be borne out in a lawsuit
announced Thursday by the agent's lawyers. However, this incident may
actually say little about profiling. We give authority to pilots to
use their instinct and judgment as the final line of defense against
terrorism. This pilot may have acted improperly or arbitrarily in
reviewing the facts but he was correct in questioning the agent and
demanding confirmation of his status.</TE>
<TE>   There is well-based opposition to profiling. There has been abuse
for years and profiling is prohibited in many states. Profiling has
been used to isolate groups such as young African American males for
legally permissible patdowns based on reasonable suspicion by police.</TE>
<TE>   The suggested use of profiling in airports, however, is different.
Where profiling of African Americans was based on a generalized
suspicion of criminal intent, the profiling of some categories of
Arab travelers is tied to a single defined crime and an established
nexus between certain groups and the current threat. The suggestion
that the questioning of Arab travelers is based on mere ethnic
prejudice is absurd.</TE>
<TE>   All 19 of the September hijackers were young Arab men. The vast
majority of Al Qaeda members and Taliban fighters are Afghan or Arab
men. All 22 people on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list are
Muslims and virtually all are Arab. This may have something to do
with the fact that the cause for the hatred spawning this terrorism
is centered in the Middle East and steeped in Islamic fanaticism.</TE>
<TE>   The reluctance to use a profile at airports for terrorism seems
designed to satisfy modern sensibilities at the cost of actual
security. Terrorism at airports is different from other crimes in
that it is sudden and terminal. Society can sustain some missed
opportunities in the "war on drugs," but a missed opportunity in the
war on terrorism is measured in body counts.</TE>
<TE>   A profile is merely a device used to identify potential criminal
actors based on statistical and case analysis. These profiles may
include nationality, physical description and other factors found to
be common for a crime. Where courts have long given great weight to
the "hunches" or instincts of experienced officers in making some
stops, a profile merely compiles the experience of hundreds of
officers into a diagnostic tool. When it comes to terrorism, the
common denominators among past cases is strikingly consistent and
predictive.</TE>
<TE>   None of this means that all profiling is legitimate. It would be
outrageous to use religion as a profile category despite the
uniformity of the religion of these terrorists. Moreover, nationality
or ethnicity should only be a factor and not the sole factor. If
every Arab American is being stopped, stereotypes rather than
statistics are controlling selection. The greatest injuries, however,
are not found in the stop itself. We should focus our intention on
the conduct of security staff after a stop is made.</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing that runs against the American grain so much as a
profile. This week, Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta likened
profiling at airports to the internment of Japanese Americans in
World War II because of their ethnicity.</TE>
<TE>   We need to gain a degree of perspective if we are to resolve the
issue of profiling. We are not talking about internments or arrests
but stops at airports. While it is important to keep our history of
racism in mind, we can be so blinded by our commitment to avoid our
past abuses that we refuse to see the obvious dangers before us.</TE>
<TE>   We would be better served as a nation if we stopped debating the
clear value of some profiling and instead discuss the conditions and
monitoring needed to ensure that it is not abused.</TE>

<HD>Mental Health Court Offers New Options</HD>
<DH>The innovative Los Angeles County program examines issues
bigger than guilt when dealing with troubled juvenile offenders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As judicial experiments go, it is modest in size, especially in
California, where criminal justice measures can sweep up thousands of
offenders virtually overnight.</LD>
<LD>   Still, a Los Angeles County attempt to rescue troubled teenagers
from criminal activity has the potential to transform how the
nation's largest juvenile justice system treats youths with mental
illness.</LD>
<LD>   In a courtroom next to the crowded Eastlake Juvenile Hall,
Superior Court Judge Clifford L. Klein presides over what is believed
to be the first juvenile mental health court in the country.</LD>
<TE>   The brainchild of mental health advocates, the court is distinct
from the dozens of others handling juvenile cases in Los Angeles
County because it focuses only on youths with diagnosed mental health
problems. The judge orders their treatment and monitoring to minimize
their chances of additional run-ins with the law.</TE>
<TE>   "It is one thing to talk about guilt or innocence," said Deputy
Public Defender Nancy Ramseyer. "Here we are looking at bigger
issues, like why a kid got involved in the system and how we can
prevent it from happening again."</TE>
<TE>   Like others assigned to the court, Ramseyer has years of
experience in the field of juvenile delinquency. She began working
with youths in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "It is completely different now. We didn't have all these kids
with mental health issues," she said. "Maybe it is better diagnosis.
Maybe it is because so many kids were born to families who couldn't
care for them and they wound up in the foster care system" without
adequate mental health care.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the reasons, Los Angeles County authorities say a
Probation Department survey last year found that a staggering 40% of
youths held at juvenile halls suffered significant mental health
problems. Consider that the county's three high-security juvenile
halls house about 2,000 youths, in addition to the thousands more
held at camps or in other facilities, and one begins to see the scope
of the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing the problem begins with representatives from various
agencies, including the district attorney's office. The group
determines which youths might benefit from the court's intervention.
Officials have decided that in the first year, they will limit the
caseload to about three dozen youths.</TE>
<TE>   Eligibility is based on criteria that include a diagnosed mental
disorder or developmental disability and the minor's competence to
communicate with an attorney. Also, a youth's record cannot be too
violent or the latest crime too serious.</TE>
<TE>   Complicated Problems Require Expertise</TE>
<TE>   "The problems that cause these kids to behave the way they do are
very complicated," said Michael Malkin, director of the Juvenile
Court's mental health services. "And for anyone to have an impact on
that behavior requires a lot of human effort by people who know what
they are doing."</TE>
<TE>   Klein said many of the youths sent to his court have not done well
at juvenile halls or other facilities.</TE>
<TE>   That was the case with a 14-year-old boy brought before the court
recently.</TE>
<TE>   Hyperactive and diagnosed as mildly retarded, the teenager has
long had problems in school, principally with reading. "He wasn't
really doing as well as the other kids," said his mother, Gwen.</TE>
<TE>   His learning disabilities fueled the boy's frustration, his mother
said, noting that in a pre-kindergarten class, he was suspended for
misbehaving. On the streets, he has been arrested for property crimes
such as stealing a bicycle.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in the early morning hours of Sept. 29, he was picked up joy
riding not far from the family's South Bay apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Under routine circumstances, officials said, he probably would
have been sent back to a juvenile hall without any individual focus
on his disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   But on Oct. 30, about a month into the new juvenile mental health
experiment, a judge in Inglewood referred the youth's case to Klein's
courtroom. And in late December, after a series of evaluations, the
teenager was released to the custody of his mother with an array of
court-ordered services.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning this week, he will attend a small special education
school that agreed to accept him after being impressed both by his
interest in learning and his mother's commitment. For her son's
interview appointment, Gwen, though sick with the flu, took three
buses to get to and from the school.</TE>
<TE>   "We really admire that," Klein said. "That's quite a commitment."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his specialized classroom instruction, the teenager
will receive after-school supervision that includes homework and
activities. Apart from schooling, he will undergo an evaluation at
UCLA's Neuropsychiatric Institute and get regular counseling.</TE>
<TE>   His mother, meanwhile, will receive services including weekend
respite care so she can shop or run errands.</TE>
<TE>   The county program also carries some restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   For example, from the time he returns home until he goes back to
school, the teenager will be required to wear an electronic
monitoring device that will alert authorities if he leaves the
apartment.</TE>
<TE>   The judge also told the boy that he must not get into fights or
hang out with old friends, many of whom are in gangs.</TE>
<TE>   Doing Well Is the Best 'Thank You'</TE>
<TE>   "We really don't want to put you back into juvenile hall," Klein
told the youth.</TE>
<TE>   Before ordering the boy to return with his mother in 30 days for a
status report, Klein made sure the youth understood the terms of his
release and asked if he had anything to say.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank you," the boy said, breaking into a grin.</TE>
<TE>   "The best 'thank you,' " Klein responded, "is to do well out
there."</TE>
<TE>   Outside court, with her son returned to her just days before
Christmas, Gwen called the new court "a blessing."</TE>
<TE>   Given his history, she said, plenty of people over the years "knew
my son had a problem, but nobody took the time to help."</TE>
<TE>   "But he came to this court and they have been great," she said.
"It's like they are breaking their backs for him."</TE>
<TE>   No one involved in the program believes that every teenager who
participates will never again get in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "What I tell the kids when I first meet them is that this is a
voluntary program, but if you work with me, we will make sure that
this is the last time you are incarcerated," Ramseyer said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if that is going to happen with every kid. But I
think in most cases, we will make that happen."</TE>

<HD>Chinese Film's Version of Mao Backfires</HD>
<DH>Movies* A state-sponsored tale of the leader's dealings
with a friendly Western journalist enrages the writer's widow, who
takes issue with the current regime.</DH>

<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>The real Mao Tse-tung hounded critics to death. But in the latest
version of history according to China's state film industry, Mao
treasures free speech and criticism of his regime.</LD>
<LD>   "Mao Tse-tung and Edgar Snow" tells the story of Mao and the
American journalist who met him in 1936, when China's future
Communist rulers were an obscure band of rural guerrillas.</LD>
<LD>   "Mao is anxious to create a fair society," Snow says in one scene.</LD>
<TE>   "It's right that he points out our problems," the silver-screen
Mao says when Snow later writes critically about his economic
policies.</TE>
<TE>   China has one of the world's few remaining Communist film
industries, and its state studios still turn out a stream of pictures
meant to give the ruling party's view of history.</TE>
<TE>   The propaganda films aren't popular with Chinese audiences, who
have more choices than they used to. China's film industry also
produces popular dramas and slapstick comedies. Some Hollywood films,
including "Titanic" and "Pearl Harbor," have played to large
audiences in theaters. And a huge selection of domestic and foreign
fare is available on $1 pirated home videos.</TE>
<TE>   "Mao and Snow" bombed at the box office and might have disappeared
into obscurity like most of China's cinematic propaganda. Instead, it
has backfired on its makers and provoked controversy by enraging
Snow's widow.</TE>
<TE>   Lois Wheeler Snow, who lives in Switzerland, where her husband
died in 1972, accuses the filmmakers of abusing his memory to support
a government that she says has betrayed his principles.</TE>
<TE>   Edgar Snow interviewed Mao early, traveling to the remote
Communist guerrilla base in western China. He stayed in China until
the early 1940s reporting on its civil war, which ended in 1949 with
Communist victory. His sympathetic book "Red Star Over China"
influenced American views of Chinese leftists.</TE>
<TE>   Snow is officially regarded as a "friend of China" and half of his
ashes are interred on the campus of Peking University.</TE>
<TE>   The movie shows Mao and his communists as earnest super-patriots.
Snow, played by American businessman John A. Gardner, a first-time
film actor, declares: "I love China. I will stand by her and fight
the fascists, Nazis and imperialists."</TE>
<TE>   Snow's widow is unhappy that filmmakers have included him in
efforts to promote the party, and she complains about their use of
material from "Red Star Over China."</TE>
<TE>   In a phone interview from Switzerland, Wheeler Snow said her
husband and Mao had a "very special relationship" based not on
personal friendship, but on mutual concern for the Chinese people.</TE>
<TE>   She become a critic of the government after the army crushed
pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Last year, she
threatened to remove Snow's ashes from the university after police
blocked her from visiting the mother of a protester killed in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   "The present Chinese leaders not only, in my belief, betrayed the
principles of the revolution, but they dare to assume they are
friends with Edgar Snow," Wheeler Snow said.</TE>
<TE>   Director Song Jiangbo said he canceled a screening for foreign
reporters after the controversy with Wheeler Snow surfaced.</TE>
<TE>   China's propaganda pictures increasingly use high-quality
photography and sound. "Mao and Snow" includes actors from the United
States, Canada and the Middle East, and scenes shot in Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   "Mao and Snow" is one of a batch of films released to coincide
with the 80th anniversary last year of the Communist Party's
founding. One recent week, it shared Beijing cinemas with "Mao
Tse-tung in 1925," about the party's perilous early years.</TE>
<TE>   Despite public ambivalence about such films, with their
heavy-handed scripts and one-dimensional characters, propaganda
bosses are calling for more. Television shows and films based on the
official version of Communist history are "effective textbooks for
education in patriotism and revolutionary tradition among Chinese
people," the party's propaganda chief, Ding Guangen, told a recent
meeting of the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Tuesday afternoon, barely a dozen people were seated
in the dark of Beijing's Capital Theater to see "Mao and Snow." Most
were employees of a state bank who got time off and free tickets.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't really compare it to a normal movie," said one man, who
declined to give his name. "It was better than 'Mao Tse-tung in
1925.'"</TE>
<TE>   Gardner was quoted by the official newspaper China Daily as saying
he wants to take the picture to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Young Americans should watch the film and learn more about Snow
and his friendship with Mao and China," Gardner was quoted as saying.</TE>

<HD>A Master Mixes Big Sounds in a Small City</HD>
<DH>Pop music* Renowned engineer Bob Ludwig expected to scale
back when he left New York, but stars seek him out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLARKE CANFIELD</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Maine</DL>
<LD>Bob Ludwig is a master.</LD>
<LD>   Just ask Bruce Springsteen. Or Eric Clapton. Or Lou Reed. Or any
of the hundreds of other musicians and record producers who make up
his client list.</LD>
<LD>   As a mastering engineer, Ludwig puts the final creative audio
touches on recordings before they are shipped off to be manufactured
into millions of compact discs.</LD>
<TE>   His company, however, isn't in a musical hotbed such as New York,
Nashville or Los Angeles. Instead, Gateway Mastering Studios is in
Portland, a small seaport better known for lobsters and lighthouses
than music.</TE>
<TE>   Ludwig moved to Maine for its quality of life nine years ago after
working in New York for more than 25 years. When he built his studio,
his business plan called for a 20% reduction of his workload.</TE>
<TE>   But business is so good, Ludwig's always booked three to four
months in advance. He masters about 270 albums a year--at an average
charge of $5,500 per album--and attracts some of the biggest musical
superstars to Portland.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been very lucky since we opened the doors," he said. "It
turns out I'm busier than in New York, which hardly seems possible
because I was really busy there."</TE>
<TE>   There's good reason why.</TE>
<TE>   "Bob's the Michael Jordan of the industry," said Doug Levine,
owner of Masterdisk Corp. in New York, where Ludwig was chief
engineer for 16 years. "He's referred to as one of the golden ears of
the industry."</TE>
<TE>   Gateway Studios is nestled under a parking garage, a couple of
blocks from downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, Ludwig's primary work spot is his mastering studio, where
he listens to recordings and makes the final adjustments. He does
things like make vocals louder or quieter, liven up instrumental
tracks, or simply bring the different musical parts into unison.</TE>
<TE>   Everything about this room is coordinated to enhance the music. In
fact, it was designed with custom software to mathematically
calculate the perfect listening environment.</TE>
<TE>   The studio's floor, for instance, "floats" above the concrete
foundation to minimize vibration. The 6-foot speakers are placed to
the inch, and the back wall and ceiling diffract sound waves. The
height of the ceiling, the length of the walls and each angle are
calibrated for perfection.</TE>
<TE>   Ludwig, 57, flips a switch and the sounds of the latest Art
Garfunkel album fill the room. They cut through the air with a
clarity and richness that you could scarcely imagine on a home stereo
system.</TE>
<TE>   In the last couple of years, Ludwig has expanded into DVDs, and he
now has 12 employees and another mastering studio.</TE>
<TE>   Hanging on the walls are framed gold albums he has worked on.
There are the Rolling Stones, Natalie Merchant, the Grateful Dead and
Def Leppard. Madonna, Foo Fighters, U2, Metallica, Dire Straits and
Sting. ZZ Top, Pink Floyd, John Mellencamp, Frank Sinatra. Tony
Bennett, Springsteen, Clapton. And on and on.</TE>
<TE>   Ludwig has mastered more than 7,000 albums in his career. Thirteen
have sold more than 10 million copies. He has won the top awards in
his profession.</TE>
<TE>   As Ludwig gave a tour one recent day, he received a phone call
from Lou Reed, asking about an upcoming album that Ludwig will work
on. They talked like old friends.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many engineers, Ludwig has a musical background. He has a
master's degree in performance and music literature, and once played
the trumpet for the Utica, N.Y., orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got a very musical ear, he's not just a technician," said
Bob Clearmountain, owner of Mix This! studio in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the accolades, Ludwig is soft-spoken and keeps a low
profile. He makes employees sign agreements to not disclose when
artists are coming to Portland to work in the studio.</TE>
<TE>   He cherishes living in Maine. In some ways, he said, being in
Portland has turned out to be an asset for his business. It's fairly
easy to fly to the city, he said, and it has a vibrant downtown
without the distractions of New York.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Walsh, an editor with Billboard magazine, said Ludwig
took a risk by moving to an out-of-the-way place and starting his own
company.</TE>
<TE>   "But obviously," Walsh said, "his gamble has proven right."</TE>

<HD>Sean Hannity Rushes In</HD>
<DH>The talk-radio host, best known as part of TV's 'Hannity &amp;
Colmes,' is picking up listeners and stations, including KABC-AM in
L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Talk-radio host Sean Hannity likes to say he's come full circle. It
looks as if he's made the trip more than once.</LD>
<LD>   As a child, the New York native surreptitiously listened to AM
talk radio in his bedroom. Now his three-hour show on WABC-AM leads
the afternoon ratings in Gotham.</LD>
<LD>   Fired from a college station for being too conservative, he got
his first paid gig by placing a classified ad in the trade journal
Radio &amp; Records, touting himself as "the most talked-about college
radio host in America."</LD>
<TE>   That same magazine's readers' poll named him "2001 Talk
Personality of the Year."</TE>
<TE>   And he got his start broadcasting at UC Santa Barbara's radio
station. Now he's back in Southern California, the latest addition to
the talk-show lineup on KABC-AM (790).</TE>
<TE>   "I love to talk to people. I love politics. For me, it's fun, and
the fact they pay me is just a bonus," said Hannity, 40, whose show
runs locally from noon to 3 p.m. weekdays.</TE>
<TE>   He's probably better-known as half of the conservative-liberal duo
on the Fox News Channel's "Hannity &amp; Colmes," one of the first shows
on the fledgling TV network in 1996. But he got his start in talk
radio a decade earlier, working in Santa Barbara, then Huntsville,
Ala., then Atlanta, before getting hired in New York by ABC Radio
Networks, which then took his show national on Sept. 10. It's now
heard on about 90 stations nationwide and will hit the century mark
sometime this month.</TE>
<TE>   "There hasn't been any new blood in the national talk-radio scene
for a while," said Al Peterson, news/sports/talk editor at Radio &amp;
Records magazine. "He brings a youthful experience that some hosts
don't have, and he's got a baby boomer perspective. He's got a new
energy, if you will."</TE>
<TE>   That energy emanates from the first moments of the show, when an
incessant Wagnerian chorus accompanies the opening, "From coast to
coast, from border to border, from sea to shining sea--Sean Hannity
is on."</TE>
<TE>   Hannity then spends the next three hours taking calls from
liberals and fellow conservatives, interviewing guests, chatting
about everyday events and mainly holding court on the news of the
day, viewed from his right-side perspective. He dissects the antics
of Britney Spears, labeling her a "belly-baring pop tart"; he
criticizes the U.S. government for not supporting Israel enough; and
he uses his rhetorical skills to steer wayward listeners who have
strayed too far left--a process he calls Hannitizing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a reverse brainwashing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His New York-accented, machine-gun delivery is loaded with
alternating rounds of humor and scorn. And the booming promos that
bookend the show's commercials exhibit the bluster and bravado
typical of conservative talk radio (one announcement: "The last
bastion of truth in a troubled time"), as well as a sense of humor
("The Sean Hannity Show: Even when he's wrong, he thinks he's
right").</TE>
<TE>   "It's smart and funny," said KABC program director Erik Braverman.
"If you're smart and funny, and listeners like you, you're going to
be a success."</TE>
<TE>   ABC officials hope Hannity will solidify the L.A. station's place
in the fight for the local talk-radio audience, with his show
anchoring the spot between Gloria Allred and Mark Taylor in the
morning, and Larry Elder in drive time. Peterson said it's just what
KABC needs to combat KFI-AM (640), with its more established lineup
that features as its cleanup hitter Rush Limbaugh--whom Hannity calls
the Babe Ruth of talk radio.</TE>
<TE>   The two have been friends for years, and Hannity filled in for him
several times in the last year when Limbaugh was seeking treatment
for his hearing loss. But Limbaugh will have to find a new
pinch-hitter, as Hannity is now on competing stations in many
markets. And though Hannity may be a protege, of sorts, and even
echoes Rush in some of his techniques, their two programs are
different.</TE>
<TE>   "Rush is really pretty much a one-man show most of the time. He
rarely deals with guests," Peterson said. Hannity, on the other hand,
includes callers and high-profile guests from the left. "He loves to
debate with liberals. That's what he eats for breakfast."</TE>
<TE>   "Any good talk show, it's got to be information and
entertainment," Hannity said. "If I talk to only people that agree
with me, it gets a little boring at times.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the left, over the years, has been all too willing to
silence conservatives. I'm not going to do what they're doing," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   He recently had the Rev. Al Sharpton on his show, after the New
York-based activist announced his bid for the presidency. They
naturally sparred on many subjects, but Hannity also conceded he was
smart, funny and devout.</TE>
<TE>   House Democratic leader Richard Gephardt and former Al Gore
campaign manager Donna Brazile have also been on the show. And former
first lady and junior senator from New York, Hillary Rodham Clinton,
has an open invitation. She has yet to accept.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be nice to her," Hannity insists.</TE>
<TE>   "He really appreciates a dialogue," said John McConnell, senior
vice president of programming for ABC Radio Networks. "He's not a
yeller. He doesn't hang up on people."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe because he knows what the other end of the phone is like. He
got his start in talk radio by regularly calling a show on KTMS in
Santa Barbara, offering opinions on the Iran-Contra hearings that so
fired up other listeners, they wanted to debate him, not the host.</TE>
<TE>   Hannity decided to eliminate the middleman and started his own
radio program at UC Santa Barbara, where a dearth of interested
broadcasting students allowed outsiders to get on the air. He was in
Santa Barbara, as he said, "loafing" with his sister, Therese, after
knocking around New York University and other colleges on the East
Coast, alternately studying political science and economics and
leaving school to work construction and make tuition money.</TE>
<TE>   That first incarnation of "The Sean Hannity Show" lasted about 40
hourlong episodes, before his bosses had heard enough. He got
canceled after a guest, a conservative author, talked about AIDS and
gay bathhouses.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very left-leaning station. They called Reagan and Bush
drug runners and drug pushers," Hannity said. "Controversy was only a
one-way street to the left. That wasn't fair."</TE>
<TE>   After the ad in Radio &amp; Records landed him the Huntsville, Ala.,
job, he moved to Atlanta and rose to No. 1 in the market.</TE>
<TE>   Hannity made appearances on CNN, "Phil Donahue" and "Sally Jessy
Raphael," and caught the attention of CNBC head Roger Ailes, who
brought Hannity to New York when he created the Fox News Channel in
1996. Shortly afterward, WABC hired him.</TE>
<TE>   McConnell wouldn't reveal the terms of the new contract Hannity
got with the national roll-out, saying only that it was multiyear,
and that "Sean's having a good Christmas."</TE>
<TE>   "When I started at the college station, I was the worst," Hannity
said. "I used to be a lot more confrontational and a lot more
combative than I am now.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a horrible host. You can't be 26 and be a good talk-radio
host. The more life experiences you have, the more interests you
have, the better off you are. You have some perspective."</TE>
<TE>   Peterson, of Radio &amp; Records, said the most important thing
Hannity has going for him is his attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got the killer instinct," he said. "He's a guy who has never
shied away from a challenge. And he's been pretty darn successful.</TE>
<TE>   "Who's the next Rush? Sean definitely has that potential."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sean Hannity can be heard weekdays from noon to 3 p.m. on KABC-AM
(790).</TE>

<HD>A Seasoned Chef Seeks Eating Kicks on the Road</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAMANTHA CRITCHELL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Anthony Bourdain, who prefers a leather bomber jacket to a
traditional toque, shuns the glitzy label "celebrity chef."</LD>
<LD>   Still, the executive chef at the two Les Halles restaurants in
Manhattan is a celebrity, thanks to the best-selling book "Kitchen
Confidential" and the follow-up "A Cook's Tour," which has a
companion series debuting Tuesday on the Food Network.</LD>
<LD>   Brad Pitt might even play Bourdain in a film adaptation of
"Kitchen Confidential."</LD>
<TE>   "It's supposed to be Brad Pitt, but who knows? I only know what I
read in the papers....I'd like Gary Oldman, someone a little beat
up."</TE>
<TE>   The book, subtitled "Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly," is
full of well-known "secrets" about the restaurant industry--including
the don't-order-fish-on-Monday-because-it's-not-fresh rule.</TE>
<TE>   Bourdain, a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America and the
author of two novels, intended the book to celebrate the hard life,
camaraderie and commitment of kitchen workers. "Kitchen
Confidential's" critics (mostly uptight food writers, according to
Bourdain) thought the book didn't give proper respect to chefs.</TE>
<TE>   "A Cook's Tour," a travelogue of exotic places such as Vietnam,
Cambodia and rural Mexico, offers a first-hand look at local cuisine
and likely will have a new set of critics, says Bourdain. He picks
the episode filmed in Portugal, featuring a medieval pig slaughter,
as a likely target.</TE>
<TE>   Bourdain, 45, grew up in Bergen County, N.J., and has lived and
cooked in New York for most of his career. The foods he missed most
on his nine-month global travels were scrambled eggs, smoked salmon
on a warm bagel, and hot dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Question: How did you map out your destinations for "A Cook's
Tour"?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: I was looking for kicks. I avoided France--Paris and
Lyon--which would be obvious stops for any sort of food-travel show.
[He did make a stop in rural France, however.] Italy, I avoided.
India. China. These are "mother cuisines" that require a certain
level of expertise ... and all the subjects have been covered well by
others. I was looking for off the road, and for places that when I
was reading Tintin comics as a kid sounded like cool places to go.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you speak any languages other than English?</TE>
<TE>   A: I speak Spanglish. Nueva Yorkeno--Mexican prison slang. I'd
fail at Berlitz but I could make myself understood in any kitchen in
America.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What was your favorite place?</TE>
<TE>   A: Vietnam was the one place that exceeded my hope--and I had very
high expectations for Vietnam. In every way, it was better than my
wildest dreams. Everything I wanted to find, I found, times
10....It's the best food per square foot of anywhere I've ever been.</TE>
<TE>   Q: The worst?</TE>
<TE>   A: Given the choice between returning to Berkeley [Calif.] for a
vegan potluck dinner and eating with the Khmer Rouge [in Cambodia], I
think I'd choose the Khmer Rouge again.</TE>
<TE>   Q: When did chefs become TV stars?</TE>
<TE>   A: The rise of interest in food and the rise of interest in the
glamorous chef, or TV-friendly chef, happened around the same time in
the early '80s when the idea of indiscriminate sex was revealed to be
not such a great idea. That's one theory ... it's the new porn.</TE>

<HD>Doing the Time Warp Again--and Again</HD>
<DH>Movies* Time travel and manipulation emerged as common
threads in the cinema of 2001 and look to continue this year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DESOWITZ</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leaping forward, looking back, tripping back and forth, uniting past
and present, time travel--both literally and figuratively--became one
of last year's dominant movie themes, a year in cinema that we might
as well dub "2001: A Time Odyssey."</LD>
<LD>   In "Planet of the Apes," man and ape ricochet throughout time to
play the ultimate game of "Survivor," getting closer in touch with
their primal instincts. In "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider," controlling
time becomes the ultimate power play. In "Donnie Darko," a troubled
teen (Jake Gyllenhaal) glimpses the future to repair a rift in a
parallel universe and to redeem his own existence. In "Black Knight,"
a selfish medieval theme park employee (Martin Lawrence) discovers a
sense of community by hurling back into the Middle Ages. In "Just
Visiting," a medieval count (Jean Reno) tumbles into the present,
finds his descendant and turns back the clock on his fumbled
marriage. In "Happy Accidents," a time-traveling rebel (Vincent
D'Onofrio) steps back nearly 500 years to find true love with a wary
gal (Marisa Tomei) who has given up hope.</LD>
<LD>   And in the recent "Kate &amp; Leopold," a Victorian nobleman (Hugh
Jackman) falls through a portal on the Brooklyn Bridge to find true
love with a contemporary marketing executive (Meg Ryan) who has no
time for romance.</LD>
<TE>   In keeping with the conventions of the time-travel genre,
destinies are fulfilled with pretzel logic. But these aren't mere
fish-out-of-water stories; there's more of a desperate urge to change
history and make up for the sins of the past, as if time itself were
running out.</TE>
<TE>   "At least until Sept. 11, we felt impervious--a kind of irony in
the way we viewed the world," said "Kate &amp; Leopold" director James
Mangold. "What turned me on was making a wildly improbable premise
and playing with real characters. Film is so magical in its ability
to play with time. Film is about time. It's inherent in the
cut--we're catapulted from one scene to another. The idea of
co-mingling periods is fun in pointing out the differences."</TE>
<TE>   As if these time-travel stories weren't enough, the year also gave
us a subcategory of films that manipulated time with greater
imagination: "Moulin Rouge" and "A Knight's Tale" conjure
anachronistic worlds in which rock and pop ring out like a bohemian
rhapsody in the former and an extreme sports anthem in the latter.
"From Hell" links past and present by making the case that Jack the
Ripper gave birth to the murder and mayhem of the 20th century. And
"Memento," "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" and "Iris" travel back and
forth through time to prove love's endurance and the precious power
of memory.</TE>
<TE>   When you add to the mix such 2002 films as the remake of "The Time
Machine" (Guy Pearce plays an American scientist from the 19th
century who travels in time to prevent the death of his fiancee),
"Possession" (the adaptation of the A.S. Byatt novel that also
contrasts the Victorian era with our own) and "Clockstoppers" (a high
school student freezes time and must figure out how to save his
father), you begin to realize this trend runs much deeper.</TE>
<TE>   "Moulin Rouge" director Baz Luhrmann certainly thinks so. "We are
in a period--and have been for a while--where we are deeply
interested in universality. It's how we've chosen to examine our own
social and economic realities. To look at our universality, we must
look at ourselves from a distance. And when you have a quick look at
where we are, who we are and what we're doing, you find that time
changes everything and yet the human condition remains the same."</TE>
<TE>   Cultural Factors Promote Nostalgia</TE>
<TE>   Why this sudden interest in time-travel movies? The arrival of the
new millennium? Nostalgia for the past? A vicarious impulse to erase
the excesses of the 20th century?</TE>
<TE>   Mangold attributes this trend to three cultural factors: the
phenomenal success of "Titanic," which opened the flood gates for
period pieces; the World War II nostalgia wave ushered in by "Saving
Private Ryan"; and the publication a few years back of "Timeline,"
Michael Crichton's novel about a historian who travels back to 14th
century France to save his professor, which is being made into a
movie next year starring Paul Walker ("The Fast and the Furious") and
directed by Richard Donner.</TE>
<TE>   But are deeper forces at work as well? Ever since the transforming
events of Sept. 11, there's been a lot of talk about changing our
lives to find deeper spiritual meaning. Reevaluating our priorities,
reconsidering our options and reclaiming time, making it more
worthwhile, now that we realize our lives could suddenly end with a
swift terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   For once the movies seem to have been ahead of us in anticipating
this spiritual longing by focusing on the subject of time, urging us
to shake off the irony and ennui and start reconnecting with each
other in more caring and compassionate ways.</TE>
<TE>   "What's exciting about these time-travel movies is they allow you
to explore human emotions," said "Donnie Darko" director Richard
Kelly. "They are ultimately existential works about the search for
meaning in an agnostic world."</TE>
<TE>   In "Kate &amp; Leopold," postmodern detachment pales in comparison to
Victorian gallantry; if we could only tear a page out of 19th century
romance and courtship, then this would be a happier society. Jackman
plays the perfect English gentleman: a forward-thinker weary of his
own time who knows how to treat a lady. He's also the inventor of the
elevator who isn't exactly blown away by 21st century technology. But
he is blown away by the way we live our lives: "What has happened to
the world?"</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, "Donnie Darko" explores the genre in a disturbing new
way. Gyllenhaal plays a paranoid schizophrenic at the end of the
Reagan era visited by a strange 6-foot rabbit that's nothing like
Harvey, offering horrifying visions of things to come.</TE>
<TE>   Only through a series of incomprehensibly destructive acts do we
come to realize that this high school terrorist is more Christlike
than antichrist.</TE>
<TE>   And in the end, we are left with a surprising sense of serenity in
knowing that we are all somehow connected.</TE>
<TE>   "I've opened up a big Pandora's box of ideas about choice and
fate," explained "Donnie Darko" director Kelly. "I wanted to do a
coming-of-age story for my generation from the '80s."</TE>
<TE>   Channeling the Present Into the Past</TE>
<TE>   "Moulin Rouge," meanwhile, redefines the musical for a 21st
century audience by channeling popular music of the 20th century
through the bohemian revolution of Paris in 1899. The end of the 19th
century was no more decadent or tumultuous than the end of the 20th
century, Luhrmann posits, so why not reinvent the "Orphic" myth of
love, art and death with a few silly love songs and "Hellzapoppin'"
theatricality?</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not you like the film, you can't help being impressed
by its boundless energy and sensory delights. Or cracking a smile
when Ewan McGregor first breaks into "The Sound of Music" during a
fit of inspiration.</TE>
<TE>   There's more of a haunting quality to "Memento," "A.I." and
"Iris," which use various time-tripping techniques to draw us closer
to their protagonists and the search for meaning in their lives.</TE>
<TE>   The slow reverse trajectory of "Memento" lulls us into the same
kind of fatigue and confusion as its memory-impaired protagonist (Guy
Pearce). He laboriously tries to solve his wife's murder, but his
inability to retain anything beyond the moment puts him in a
continuous loop more horrifying than "Groundhog Day." What
undoubtedly has struck a chord with viewers is the feeling of sensory
overload as well as the underlying denial of a painful past.</TE>
<TE>   And say what you will about "A.I.," but it's an ambitious and
uncompromising fable about the nature of fairy tales and parenting
over the course of time. After enduring an eternity of pain and
suffering, the robot boy (Haley Joel Osment) gets a second chance
with the adoptive mother (Frances O'Connor) who abandoned him 2,000
years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   In "Iris," the 40-year love affair between famed novelist Iris
Murdoch and husband John Bayley hurls back and forth between their
early romance at Oxford in the 1950s (portrayed by Kate Winslet and
Hugh Bonnerville) and their harrowing ordeal when she is stricken
with Alzheimer's in the 1990s (portrayed by Judi Dench and Jim
Broadbent).</TE>
<TE>   The effect of crisscrossing time periods as well as memories not
only reveals the shifting power struggle of their marriage but also
the terror of losing one's mind. At the same time, you sense their
passionate codependency. While Murdoch lives somewhere up in the
bohemian clouds, Bayley brings her down to earth with utmost
tenderness.</TE>
<TE>   A richer kind of crisscrossing occurs in the upcoming
"Possession," in which two contemporary literary scholars (Gwyneth
Paltrow and Aaron Eckhart) uncover a secret love affair between two
English poets (Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle) from the Victorian
era. As Paltrow and Eckhart plunge further into a Pandora's box of
passion while reading the other couple's intimate letters and
inhabiting many of the same places, they too eventually repeat
history by falling in love.</TE>
<TE>   Yet for all the repression associated with the Victorian era, the
modern lovers are unable to express their feelings as openly as their
predecessors, who do so obliquely through the beauty of poetry. But
"Possession" reminds us there are secrets embedded in the past only
time can unlock for us.</TE>
<TE>   However, Simon Wells, the director of "The Time Machine" remake
and the great-grandson of the book's author, H.G. Wells, stresses the
great paradox in trying to alter time: The very things that we think
we can change, he believes, "are the things we can't change and must
accept."</TE>

<HD>Lincoln Center's Chief Exits for Philadelphia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VERENA DOBNIK</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Lincoln Center, the world's largest performing arts complex, faces
yet another departure: its interim executive director is leaving to
become president of Philadelphia's new performing arts center, it was
announced Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Janice Price, 45, became interim director in October, when Gordon
Davis unexpectedly resigned as president. Price was previously a vice
president at Lincoln Center and has worked there for four years. Her
last day is Feb. 1.</LD>
<LD>   "We are a very closely knit group at the senior management level
of Lincoln Center, almost like a family, and so it is very sad to say
goodbye to a good friend like Janice Price," Lincoln Center Chairman
Beverly Sills said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   She said Price, a Toronto native, had not sought to become the
center's new president, whom Sills expected would be named in the
next two months.</TE>
<TE>   Lincoln Center experienced tumult in 2001. Davis resigned in
September after less than a year on the job; Marshall Rose, chairman
of the redevelopment project, resigned in October, months ahead of
plan.</TE>
<TE>   Sills has said that she hopes to retire, although she plans to
stay put until at least a new president is named.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Lincoln Center's renovation plans raised the conflicting
needs of theaters that house companies including the Metropolitan
Opera, the New York Philharmonic and the New York City Opera.</TE>
<TE>   Price will become president and chief executive officer of the
Philadelphia arts complex that houses the Kimmel Center, the new home
of the Philadelphia Orchestra. The $265-million center had its grand
opening last month in a lavish ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Price will earn $300,000
in her new post, a $15,000 increase over her Lincoln Center salary.</TE>
<TE>   The latest change at Lincoln Center comes a day after Mayor
Michael Bloomberg suggested that New York City might have to delay
its promise to fund $240 million of the center's $1.2-billion
renovation.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg, a recent vice chairman of the center, said construction
projects such as the planned Lincoln Center refurbishments probably
would be put on hold while the city recovers from the World Trade
Center attacks and the weakened economy.</TE>
<TE>   "We should continue with the planning, but you're not going to be
able to do things as fast as we can," the mayor said.</TE>
<TE>   The 16-acre complex has year-round performances of opera,
symphony, ballet, chamber music and jazz, while also offering film
and theater presentations.</TE>

<HD>Solid Crossover Appeal Bolsters 'Queer as Folk'</HD>
<DH>The Showtime series, returning for a second season, is
popular with gay men and heterosexual women.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNN ELBER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As might have been expected, "Queer as Folk" got mail, and lots of
it, in a first season that included sex between young gay men, and
lots of it.</LD>
<LD>   Unexpectedly, perhaps, it was mostly fan mail--about 100,000
messages from supporters versus a scant 100 from detractors,
according to Showtime's count. That was a pleasant surprise for
series creators Ron Cowen and Daniel Lipman.</LD>
<LD>   "We thought, 'Oh, my God, they're gonna come after us, there's
gonna be real nuts out there coming after us,'" Cowen said. "It
didn't happen."</LD>
<TE>   The Showtime series about a circle of friends tracked their
freewheeling night life and emotional ups and downs. AIDS, drug abuse
and harrowing gay-bashing also figured in the plot.</TE>
<TE>   The fleeting kisses and coy farce of quasi-gay shows like "Will &amp;
Grace," sanitized for broadcast TV and our protection, bear no
relation to the bold style of "Queer as Folk."</TE>
<TE>   The series became Showtime's highest-rated, doubling the cable
channel's prime-time average audience. It was renewed for a second
season, which begins Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The show, based on a hit British TV series of the same name--the
U.S. version is set in Pittsburgh but filmed in Toronto--turned out
to have crossover appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew there would be an audience among gay men for the show,"
said Jerry Offsay, Showtime's president of programming. "What we
didn't realize is that it would have as strong a following among
women as it did."</TE>
<TE>   The audience was fairly evenly split between gay men and
heterosexual women; Offsay and others at Showtime have kicked around
theories why. (Straight men tended to take a pass on "Queer as
Folk.")</TE>
<TE>   "The guys are really good-looking. It's a soap, and women like
soaps. It's a story about friends, and that's something that plays
well with women," Offsay said. "They came, they watched, they liked
it."</TE>
<TE>   Cowen and Lipman, writing partners for 25 years and a couple for
even longer, welcomed the expanded audience. But they didn't create
or shape the series to accommodate heterosexual viewers.</TE>
<TE>   Lipman recalled one magazine review that questioned the lack of a
"straight guide" to the series, and the response a reader sent in: "I
don't see a gay guide to 'Once and Again.'"</TE>
<TE>   "We've never written the show to try to guide people into this
world," Lipman said. "We've written it very specifically, and if
people get things, they get it; and if they don't, they don't."</TE>
<TE>   What he hopes they get is how much in human experience is
universal, whatever one's sexual orientation.</TE>
<TE>   "What the show is really about is boys becoming men," Lipman said.
"Some characters will succeed at that, and some won't. The show is
about maturing."</TE>
<TE>   The characters populating "Queer as Folk" are mostly young men,
attractive and single, whose adventures we follow at work, at home
and in bed.</TE>
<TE>   Brian (Gale Harold) is a handsome heel, successful and
self-absorbed. Michael (Hal Sparks) is his good-hearted childhood
friend who carries a torch for him. Teenage Justin (Randy Harrison)
is coming to grips with his sexuality.</TE>
<TE>   Also featured is a lesbian couple (Michelle Clunie and Thea Gill)
whose lives intertwine with the men.</TE>
<TE>   It was Justin who was brutally attacked by a homophobic classmate
at the end of last season.</TE>
<TE>   His recovery, and the assault's psychological effect on him and
others, will be explored in the second season.</TE>
<TE>   The series really hit its peak in the finale, Offsay said. It
emphasized the men's camaraderie and "hit the nail on the head of how
dangerous it can be sometimes being gay in America."</TE>
<TE>   The women will get more attention this time around; Showtime
thought they were underused last season. The rest of the ensemble
cast, including Sharon Gless as Michael's kooky but supportive
mother, also will be seen more.</TE>
<TE>   The show's first season had 22 episodes, which are out this month
on DVD and videocassette. The second consists of 20 episodes.</TE>
<TE>   Although the bedroom scenes are steamy, Offsay said they are no
more graphic than other Showtime fare about heterosexuals. "We don't
want to push it beyond that just for the sake of pushing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Queer as Folk" has not escaped criticism altogether. Some of the
loudest denunciations came from members of the homosexual community
who resented the show's depiction of gay promiscuity.</TE>
<TE>   The series' creators respond that they are not trying to represent
all of gay life, but a slice of it as lived by young singles.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there are a lot of people who think if you're going to do
a show about gay characters, it should be politically correct. Our
show is not politically correct," Lipman said. "It's not about a
doctor and lawyer who live in the suburbs and walk their poodle."</TE>
<TE>   The focus is specific but honest, Cowen said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing we're showing that doesn't exist in West
Hollywood, Chelsea, the Castro," he said. "In fact, the version we're
showing is a gentle version. What goes on in the world is even more
harsh and disturbing than what we're portraying."</TE>

<HD>Oscar Brown Jr. Finds Wisdom, Rhythm in Age</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every time Oscar Brown Jr. shows up in Los Angeles to deliver one of
his inspired performances, I'm mystified about why he does not
receive wider recognition. On Wednesday, in the kickoff set of a
five-night run at the Jazz Bakery, he came up with yet another
evening filled with wit, humor and tenderness underscored by the
empathetic, briskly swinging piano work of Billy Childs.</LD>
<LD>   In a Bakery booking two years ago, Brown devoted his set to the
rhymes and rhythms of his native Chicago. This time he concentrated
on age, noting at one point that he was celebrating his 75th birthday
and adding, "Actually, I'm not so much celebrating it as I am grimly
observing it."</LD>
<LD>   Fans of the veteran singer-poet, who was garbed in a rainbow of
youthful colors, know that--his protestations to the contrary--Brown
may be getting older, but he'll never be old. And what he offered in
material cunningly clustered within the concept of aging was wisdom
and insight surrounded by the aliveness of jazz rhythms--a metaphor
for who he is as an ever-youthful artist.</LD>
<TE>   After opening with a pair of New Year tunes, he dug into his own
set of lyrics to Thelonious Monk's "'Round Midnight," pausing in the
middle to insert some lines from his own anthem to aging, "This
Beach." A series of Charlie Parker lines followed: "Now's the Time,"
"Billie's Bounce" and "Barbados."</TE>
<TE>   "Now's the Time" captured the groove of the original blues as well
as the opening passages of Parker's classic solo; Childs' set of
choruses, driven by a left-hand walking bass line, added precisely
the right surge of rhythmic contrast. Brown transformed "Billie's
Bounce" into a tribute to a lady named Billie, whose 150 pounds were
"concentrated right where it counts." And "Barbados," titled "Badjian
Isle" in the Brown version, emerges as an "island of sunny fun and
moonlight romance."</TE>
<TE>   Equally delightful items followed: "Things Ain't What They Used to
Be" (continuing the theme of the evening) and Brown's classic
"Signifyin' Monkey." He persuaded the enthusiastic audience to sing
the chorus to a song pointing the finger at individual and societal
hypocrisy.</TE>
<TE>   In his most touching acknowledgment of the complexities of aging,
he added a single tune that was not his: Jacques Brel's lovely "La
Chanson des Vieux Amants" (The Song of Old Lovers), sung by Brown
with a deep understanding of the song's blending of compassion, pain
and survival.</TE>

<HD>Before There Was 'Tommy,' There Was the Who</HD>
<DH>A re-released live concert album, with songs from the rock
opera added as a bonus, shows off the group's enduring power.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Who's 1970 "Live at Leeds" album showcased the power and glory of
rock 'n' roll so well that it alone was probably enough to make you
want to form your own rock band, or at least become a disciple of the
music.</LD>
<LD>   One of three live albums from the '70s that have been re-released
in deluxe editions by the Universal Music group, it highlights this
week's edition of From the Vaults.</LD>
<LD>   The Who's "Live at Leeds," MCA. In the liner notes to this
two-disc edition, veteran British rock journalist Chris Charlesworth
points out that the original LP version of this album was designed to
remind rock fans of the group's hard-rock side at a time when its
identity was being blurred by its entry into the more ambitious world
of the rock opera "Tommy."</LD>
<TE>   Charlesworth repeats a frustrated comment from the period by Who
bassist John Entwistle: "Some people think the band's called Tommy
and the album's called 'The Who.'"</TE>
<TE>   "Leeds," then, was a documentation of the Who's great power
live--a power that was underscored when the surviving members of the
band virtually stole the show at October's Concert for New York City
from a cast that also included British rock vets Mick Jagger and Paul
McCartney.</TE>
<TE>   The original, explosive version of "Live at Leeds" contained just
six songs on one vinyl disc--"Young Man Blues," "Substitute,"
"Summertime Blues," "Shakin' All Over," "My Generation" and "Magic
Bus." The last two were extended versions that ran almost 25 minutes
together.</TE>
<TE>   When the album was reissued on CD in the mid-'90s, additional
songs from the concert (mostly non-"Tommy" material) were added,
giving the album more emotional balance. This edition gives us the
entire Leeds concert, including the "Tommy" tunes, and it's a marvel.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the fun is that you can turn it into three separate
listening experiences.</TE>
<TE>   By programming the CD player to give you tracks 5, 6, 10, 11, 12
and 13, you can listen to the original, high-octane version of "Live
at Leeds." Or you can just listen to "Tommy" by playing Disc 2. The
final option, of course, is to listen to the entire concert.</TE>
<TE>   Prince's "The Very Best of Prince," Warner Bros. If "Live at
Leeds" demonstrates the power of a rock group onstage, the heart of
this 17-track retrospective demonstrates the genius of Prince in the
studio.</TE>
<TE>   Because he can still draw on this classic material, Prince remains
a strong concert draw, even though his recordings in recent years
have been so unreliable that you no longer look forward to his new
output.</TE>
<TE>   In these vintage tracks, Prince fuses R&amp;B, funk, gospel and rock
in ways that are musically stirring and sociologically provocative.
The disc would have been stronger if Warner Bros, his old label, had
included some of his album tracks as well as the hits. Many of the
classic tunes are here, from the early "I Wanna Be Your Lover" and
"1999" to "Kiss" and "U Got the Look."</TE>
<TE>   For someone looking for a quick hit of Prince's most popular work,
this single-disc package is a solid investment. But Prince has been
such a prolific artist that you'd need several of his albums in a
truly comprehensive pop library. This one would be redundant in that
company.</TE>
<TE>   Lynyrd Skynyrd's "One More From the Road," MCA. If you grew up in
the South in the mid-'70s, this album might have been as much of a
motivator as "Live at Leeds." Until the Allman Brothers made the
music fashionable, the idea of a best-selling Southern rock band was
as unlikely in the 1970s as a best-selling Southern rapper was in the
1990s before Master P.</TE>
<TE>   Though Skynyrd wasn't as magical as the Allmans, the Jacksonville,
Fla., group brought a greater and more consistent sense of Southern
identity to its songs, including "Sweet Home Alabama," its celebrated
response to Neil Young's biting "Southern Man."</TE>
<TE>   By the time the original "One More From the Road" was released in
1976, Skynyrd already had four gold albums, but this was the band's
defining record. The album, recorded during the band's three-night
run at the Fox Theater in Atlanta, featured liner notes by film
director Cameron Crowe, who was then a contributing editor for
Rolling Stone magazine.</TE>
<TE>   In the notes, which are reprinted in the reissue booklet, Crowe
wrote, "It can be said very simply: On stage, Lynyrd Skynyrd are as
white-hot as a band can get. This is the first album to record them
exactly that way."</TE>
<TE>   This edition includes eight alternate versions of songs on the
original album, including three previously unreleased ones.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Frampton's "Frampton Comes Alive!," A&amp;M. There's not much
reason to listen to this two-CD-set album unless you were one of the
6 million people who helped keep it No. 1 for 10 weeks in 1976 and
want to hear it again, along with some previously unreleased tracks.
The music always seemed a bit too generic for lasting value, and time
has proven that impression correct.</TE>
<TE>   Al Green's "Testify: The Best of the A&amp;M Years," A&amp;M. Green may be
my favorite soul singer and performer ever, but this isn't his
classic work. The essential material is the pop-soul hits, including
"Tired of Being Alone" and "You Ought to Be With Me," that he
recorded in the '70s with producer Willie Mitchell for Hi Records.
Green made some appealing recordings in the '80s for the gospel label
Myrrh before signing with A&amp;M in 1985 and reuniting with Mitchell.
Little of the A&amp;M music, however, recaptures the spark of his earlier
work.</TE>
<TE>   The Rockets' "The Rockets," Varese Sarabande. The album's subtitle
pretty much defines the potential audience for this reissue: "The
band that became Neil Young's Crazy Horse." The Rockets were
contemporaries of Young's Buffalo Springfield in 1968 when this album
was released on White Whale Records, home of L.A. hitmakers the
Turtles.</TE>
<TE>   According to the reissue's liner notes, Young was a big fan of the
Rockets and often jammed with them. You can sense in the group's
bluesy, somewhat ragged, psychedelic style what interested Young so
much that he eventually took three of its members--guitarist Danny
Whitten, bassist Billy Talbot and drummer Ralph Molina--on the road
with him. The music's not memorable, but it is interesting in the
context of Young's history.</TE>

<HD>Hank Azaria's Midseason Journey</HD>
<DH>Television* Actor takes a wait-and-see attitude as he tries
to add his sense of comedy to his new sitcom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL E. HILL</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anyone familiar with Hank Azaria's Emmy-winning work in the earnest
and moving TV film "Tuesdays With Morrie" might be surprised to learn
that he has a new sitcom debuting next week.</LD>
<LD>   Imagine that, they might say.</LD>
<LD>   But might they watch "Imagine That"?</LD>
<TE>   NBC has tacked that title onto Azaria's show and dropped it into
the 8 p.m. Tuesday time period once occupied by the unsuccessful
comedy "Emeril."</TE>
<TE>   Azaria's is also the latest comedy to copy a formula that has
proved poisonous when it comes to sitcom success--the practice of
selecting a star to headline a show and then building the series
around him or her. Bette Midler, Geena Davis, Jason Alexander and
Michael Richards are among those who have gone this route and failed.
Richard Dreyfuss seems to be holding his own in CBS' "The Education
of Max Bickford."</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine That" also taps into the main character's fantasies, an
idea that has met with limited success in at least one other
show--"Inside Schwartz"--this TV season. Adding to counter-indicators
is a split earlier this year between Azaria, who is an executive
producer of the show, and the producer who was to run the show.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now," Azaria said, "we have five episodes we're going to
air. If people like them, we'll go forward." Then he would find a new
producer, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Azaria brings his comic sensibility and gift for impersonations to
this series centered on Josh Miller, a TV comedy sketch writer. The
inspiration for Miller's work often comes from his personal
fantasies, inserted into the action, with Azaria playing key roles in
those daydreams.</TE>
<TE>   A companion theme to the piece is Miller's reticence, which puts
him at a disadvantage in dealing with comic situations at home and in
the workplace.</TE>
<TE>   "The pilot is the closest to what my vision of the show was,"
Azaria said. "It's more about, to me, giving the show more of my
sensibility, to make it more real when we're not in the fantasy part
of the show."</TE>
<TE>   The charm Azaria displayed when he co-starred with Jack Lemmon in
"Tuesdays With Morrie" won him an Emmy. Most recently, he appeared in
"Uprising," a story of Jewish resistance in the Warsaw ghetto.</TE>
<TE>   Azaria also has a comic sense that may be less obvious. He had a
recurring role as the dog-walking neighbor in "Mad About You." And he
has an Emmy for his work on "The Simpsons," in which he provides the
voice for a number of characters, including Police Chief Wiggum and
Moe the bartender.</TE>
<TE>   In "Imagine That," Azaria's character has to cope with problems on
two fronts. At home, he has to deal with his ambitious wife, played
by Jayne Brook. She's a lawyer, which should be good for some
humorous asides, and their love life--or lack of it--is fodder for
much of the first installment of the series.</TE>
<TE>   The supporting cast features Katey Sagal, a veteran of "Married
... With Children." She plays Miller's boss, the head of the writing
team, who arrives at the office each day theme-dressed and ready to
claim Josh's ideas as her own.</TE>
<TE>   Joshua Malina, a familiar face from "Sports Night," plays Josh's
fellow writer and friend; Suzy Nakamura ("The West Wing") and David
Pressman play members of the writing staff; and Julia Schultz is
Josh's hot-dressing assistant.</TE>
<TE>   Azaria would like to combine all this with the smarts and
multi-character aspect of "The Simpsons": "One of the reasons I
wanted to do this show is so I can do a different character every
week. This show comes out of how much I enjoy doing that."</TE>

<HD>A Love Note to New York</HD>
<DH>The latest 'Sex and the City' installments were shot before
Sept. 11, yet they resonate with affection for and pride in the Big
Apple.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Howard Rosenberg</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"One of the best things about New York is that on any given night
there are a million things to do," writes newspaper columnist Carrie
Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) on her laptop. "One of the worst
things is trying to pick one."</LD>
<LD>   There are many ways to light a torch.</LD>
<LD>   Salutes to New York have been arriving in waves since Sept. 11,
surely all of them sincere and heartfelt testimonials to the
character, backbone and resilience of the wounded metropolis and its
residents.</LD>
<TE>   Among the tenderest, though, and surely the subtlest, is one that
was not even intended as a memorial.</TE>
<TE>   This is not a Gershwin tune or Woody Allen ode to his beloved
town. It's a love note to the city that originates, of all places, in
a bawdy comedy series about four women who worship orgasms, freely
use the fornicate word and tend to run through New York men like egg
creams.</TE>
<TE>   Emmy-winning "Sex and the City" is not about urban cutups, though.
Nor does it light G-spots like Broadway marquees, although its libido
soars. It long ago ceased being about just laughter or even sex,
having joined TV's tiny club of select comedies that touch minds and
hearts as well as funny bones.</TE>
<TE>   Yet how does such a series--one bolted to Manhattan geographically
and emotionally--address what happened to the twin towers at the
city's World Trade Center? How will it honor thousands of New York
victims when returning Sunday with the first of six new episodes that
finish out the season?</TE>
<TE>   Here's how: Without black crepe, teary tributes, huge swells of
emotion or overt references to tragedy. That's because this set of
half-hours was shot before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, executive producer Michael Patrick King has his
characters somehow meeting the challenge of that nightmare merely by
celebrating New York, as they always have done. There are no direct
references to ground zero, of course, only this poignant addendum
that King attached to the Feb. 9 season finale as it was edited:</TE>
<TE>   Dedicated to our City of New York ...</TE>
<TE>   Then, now, and forever.</TE>
<TE>   "When it happened, I thought, 'How do we keep going?'" King said
from New York about his series. "Well, we keep going the way the city
keeps going."</TE>
<TE>   King said that even if filming had not wrapped before the
terrorist attack, he "would never have done a specific Sept. 11
thing. That would seem somehow macabre." As for next season, there
will be references to what happened, he said, but "not a flashback to
where the girls were" on that day. "We'll try to find a balance."</TE>
<TE>   That may be dicey in these edgy times when just about any
contemporary series can be blindsided by news events. "I keep
wondering where people will be in June when [next season's] 12
episodes air," King said.</TE>
<TE>   His "Sex and the City" characters are still survivors, still works
in progress when resuming their lives on HBO Sunday. Carrie's live-in
nest with her tolerant fiance, Aidan (John Corbett), is under stress,
as is Charlotte's (Kristin Davis) marriage to middle-aged preppy Trey
(Kyle MacLachlan). Hot-blooded publicist Samantha (Kim Cattrall) is
naturally having torrid sex without strings, this time with her
equally robust client, hotel mogul Richard (James Remar). Yet that
alien sensation growing inside her: Could it be an attack of
monogamy? And pregnant Miranda's (Cynthia Nixon) belly and
self-doubts about motherhood are swelling as fast as Carrie's panic
about marriage.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm missing the bride gene," Carrie says in a coming episode. "I
should be put in a test tube and studied."</TE>
<TE>   No series--not even NBC's "Law &amp; Order" trio--has a New York state
of mind as this one does, albeit crimeless and slum-less. Manhattan
wallpapers "Sex and the City," from cabs and rent-control apartments
to a scene in the finale that was shot inside the Museum of Modern
Art with huge Pollock and Monet canvases as backdrops.</TE>
<TE>   NBC's "Seinfeld" had its New York coffee shop for chitchat, and so
does "Sex and the City," one difference being that, additionally,
these women make all of Manhattan their coffee shop. Some of the
show's best dialogues occur on the street. When Miranda tells Carrie
she "faked a sonogram" in the Jan. 20 episode, the city is bustling
around them. Just as the Columbus Circle fountain fills the frame
majestically when Carrie and Aidan have a pivotal talk about their
future.</TE>
<TE>   This episode affirms that outside events can sometimes imbue art
with meaning not intended when it was created. It is beautifully
written by Julie Rottenberg and Elisa Zuritsky and directed by Alan
Taylor, and its emphasis on walls separating people can be taken as a
metaphor for Sept. 11, when the unifying force of adversity caused
barriers dividing New Yorkers to come crashing down with the twin
towers.</TE>
<TE>   And how was King to know when he wrote and Martha Coolidge
directed the amazing, affectionate, appealingly sentimental season
finale, titled "I Heart New York," that a coming terrible event would
magnify its resonance? Or that its sweet nostalgic sadness would
deliver misty eyes and lumps in the throat related to real-life
suffering?</TE>
<TE>   How sentimentally does "Sex and the City" depart? There's a
carriage ride in Central Park under the stars, and instead of somber
funereal music, the stereo sounds of "Moon River" courtesy of Andy
Williams and Henry Mancini echo from an earlier time.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm always surprised when anyone leaves New York," says Samantha,
referring to a person they all know who is moving to Napa, Calif. "I
mean, where do they go?"</TE>
<TE>   So total is Carrie's devotion to the city (you might also call it
provincialism) that she, too, finds moving away unthinkable. "New
York, New York," she says to her traveling friend, trying to make
sense of this inexplicable act by someone she always found so
reasonable. "Aren't y'gonna miss it?"</TE>
<TE>   She doesn't get the reply she wants. Nor should she necessarily,
for the shine given the apple since Sept. 11 is largely cosmetic, and
the systemic problems confronting New York remain. When you hear
angry complaints about them again you'll know New Yorkers are finally
healing.</TE>
<TE>   But romantics will always have "Sex and the City."</TE>

<HD>Intriguing 'Mind' Nearly Passed Ron Howard By</HD>
<DH>Movies* The director initially had no time for what's
turned out to be the most critically hailed project of his career.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KALTENBACH</AU>
<BD>BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If 2000's holiday blockbuster "Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole
Christmas" hadn't eaten up a lot of Ron Howard's time, the veteran
director might never have made "A Beautiful Mind."</LD>
<LD>   This look at the career of mathematician and Nobel laureate John
Forbes Nash Jr. didn't come under Howard's stewardship until late in
the process. It was his longtime partner at Imagine Entertainment,
Brian Grazer, who first saw its potential and brought it into the
fold.</LD>
<LD>   "I knew about it and was intrigued by the story," Howard says.
"But it was Brian's project, and we never get in each other's way. A
project that Brian had nurtured I would never co-opt and try to
control."</LD>
<TE>   Early on, Grazer did ask his friend and partner if he was
interested. But Howard was still immersed in bringing Dr. Seuss'
crabby Christmas antihero to the big screen and had to take a pass.
"But I told him, if it gets to the point that I could make the
production start as early as another director, then I'd like to be
able to consider doing it.</TE>
<TE>   "Fortunately, after several flirtations with other directors and a
few false starts, it was still available to me [once 'Grinch' was
done]. So I took the script, re-read it, and about 36 hours later
said yes."</TE>
<TE>   The Christmas Day release "A Beautiful Mind" is considered an
Oscar contender (it's been nominated for six Golden Globes), and some
critics have called it the best movie of Howard's career.</TE>
<TE>   That's saying something, considering he's already been responsible
for "Splash," "Parenthood," "Cocoon" and "Apollo 13." But "A
Beautiful Mind," with its myriad twists, turns and misdirections,
brings something new to Howard's work. To say more about the plot
would spoil the host of pleasant, expertly crafted surprises awaiting
audiences; suffice it to say that, in the case of Nash, whose
struggle with mental illness continues to this day, his life was
rarely everything he believed it to be.</TE>
<TE>   "It definitely packs more surprises, more twists, than any of my
movies," Howard says. "But what really attracted me was the unusual
nature of his journey, the power of his journey and the idea that it
offers, in a very dramatic, fascinating, even suspenseful way, real
insight into this guy's life. And not only into his mental illness,
but also his genius, and the subculture of the academic elite."</TE>
<TE>   Howard's work on "A Beautiful Mind" further validates a career
decision he made nearly 25 years ago. A favorite of audiences since
he was 5 years old and began his run as Opie on TV's "The Andy
Griffith Show," Howard had nearly two decades of acting experience
under his belt before directing his first movie. On television, he'd
also appeared as the wholesome Richie Cunningham on "Happy Days"; in
the movies, his credits included everything from "The Music Man" and
"The Courtship of Eddie's Father" to "The Shootist" and "American
Graffiti."</TE>
<TE>   Even while working alongside Griffith, "I had a lot of curiosity"
about filmmaking, he says. "I didn't ask a lot of questions, but
people were always showing me things. I was looking through the
camera, I was learning about lenses, learning about sound, talking to
the directors--talking to them, as I got older, about why they chose
the camera angles they chose. It was, no question, a great learning
ground."</TE>
<TE>   His first commercial release as a director was "Grand Theft Auto"
(1977). Produced by the legendary Roger Corman, whose low-budget
films helped launch the careers of directors such as Francis Ford
Coppola and Martin Scorsese, it convinced Howard that becoming a
director was more than just what-ifs.</TE>
<TE>   "Professionally, our wrap party on that film was one of the
highlights of my life," he explains, "not because I was finished, but
because I realized when it was over that I had enjoyed the experience
of directing a film even more than I thought I would. I thought that,
this dream of mine, I was right to have this dream."</TE>
<TE>   Five years later, he directed "Night Shift," a comedy with his
"Happy Days" co-star Henry Winkler and Michael Keaton as
entrepreneurs who turn a morgue into a brothel. That film was his
first hit; 1984's "Splash," with Tom Hanks as a fruit wholesaler and
Darryl Hannah as the mermaid he falls in love with, was his first
smash.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, outside of the occasional Griffith or "Happy Days"
reunion, Howard has left acting behind. Last fall's "Grinch" proved
his biggest financial success; "A Beautiful Mind" should prove his
most aesthetically successful work--even more so than 1995's "Apollo
13," which earned Howard a Directors Guild of America award as the
year's top director.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Howard will receive the Oscar recognition he's so far been
denied; even when he was cited by the DGA for "Apollo 13," he wasn't
nominated for an Oscar--a strange oversight, given that many of the
same people vote for the two awards.</TE>
<TE>   And though he's too smart to count on anything, he's ready to
embrace an Oscar nomination, should it come his way.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody wants their films to be appreciated and respected at
every level," he says. "Of course, I hope 'A Beautiful Mind' is
accepted in that way. I wish I'd been nominated and won for 'Apollo
13.' I'd be lying if I didn't say that. But I don't know what factors
go into what is an impossible choice to begin with. It's never
[comparing] apples to apples anyway--God knows what colors those
choices."</TE>
<TE>   The subject of Oscars and Ron Howard, however, raises an
interesting issue. Howard isn't the only successful director whose
background is primarily as an actor on TV sitcoms--both Rob Reiner
("All in the Family") and Penny Marshall ("Laverne &amp; Shirley") come
to mind. Both have directed films that have received multiple Oscar
nominations. Neither has been nominated as best director either.</TE>
<TE>   So what gives? Is there some sort of conspiracy afoot, to withhold
Oscar recognition from sitcom-stars-turned-directors?</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard for me to believe that could exist, but ain't it
ironic?" Howard says with a laugh. "I kind of have to wear a bemused
grin and scratch my head. But I feel too good about the work I have
done; I know I could have been a legitimate candidate a few times."</TE>
<TE>   To put things in perspective, Howard recalls the heady days after
the release of "Cocoon" in 1985, when he was nominated for his first
DGA award. Campaigning heavily for award recognition, he showed up
pretty much everywhere, hitting the talk-show circuit, even serving
as host of NBC's "Friday Night Videos." But when the Oscar
nominations were announced, he hadn't made the cut. Among those who
did was legendary Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, for "Ran."</TE>
<TE>   "But then," Howard relates with a grin, "as a friend told me,
'Akira Kurosawa does not host 'Friday Night Videos.'"</TE>

<HD>Late-Night Inspiration in Knickknacks</HD>
<DH>xxx</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A visit to Mark Ryden's studio in Sierra Madre is like a trip to the
swap meet. In a space the size of a double garage, he gazes out over
a sea of knickknacks packed inch to inch, floor to ceiling. He roams
the room, shopping for inspiration: Odd little dolls, taxidermy
animals, tin robots and portraits of icons such as Col. Sanders and
Abraham Lincoln stare back at him.</LD>
<LD>   They are his muses.</LD>
<LD>   "It gets me in a creative mood. I can't imagine trying to create
images without looking at all this stuff. My inspiration comes from
them and flipping through books," Ryden says. "I have to see
something to trigger an idea. I can't imagine painting in an enclosed
blank room."</LD>
<TE>   Many of his treasures end up in his paintings. Images of raw meat,
religious icons and doe-eyed waifs collide in works that follow the
traditions of Bosch and Dali.</TE>
<TE>   Eight of Ryden's latest paintings, some drawings and a
limited-edition series of etchings will be on view in "Bunnies and
Bees," opening Saturday at the Grand Central Art Center in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Ryden creates pastel-colored paintings "of less-than-innocent
children in surroundings so compulsively packed with nutty detail as
to try the eye severely. A dollop of Mr. Ryden's drollery goes a very
long way," observed New York Times critic Grace Glueck in a review of
works at the Earl McGrath Gallery in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "The Magic Circus (Beth)," one of the larger oil paintings in the
Grand Central exhibition, shows a waif with brick-red hair standing
inside a jack-in-the-box-style container marked "Meat Show,"
surrounded by an assortment of bees, birds, sea creatures, bunnies,
balloons, other children, toys and a statuette of Jesus.</TE>
<TE>   Ryden's painstaking attention to minutiae verges on obsession.</TE>
<TE>   "I can get stuck on a single small element for days," he says.
"Like the star and the moon symbol in 'The Magic Circus.' It took me
days to figure out what to put there. It's actually an Islamic
symbol, and there's a string attaching it to a devil-like figure. The
connotation was completely unintentional when I painted it, but
looking at that detail suddenly becomes relevant these days."</TE>
<TE>   The paintings look like a cross between the fantastical world of
"Alice in Wonderland" and the Little Golden Books series. In "YHWH
(Dedee)," a barefoot little girl innocently encounters a
manifestation of God, represented as a three-eyed bunny totem.
("YHWH" is the purposefully unpronounceable Old Testament name of
God.) Another painting, "The Ringmaster (Shelly)," shows arms and
legs sprouting out of Lincoln's top-hatted head as he juggles cuts of
meat.</TE>
<TE>   In "Little Boy Blue," Ryden paints a paperboy on a tricycle in
pink shorts, shirt and cap with swastikas imprinted in baby blue on
his cap and sleeve.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Medford, Ore., in 1963, Ryden takes comfort in nostalgic
references to the past, from alchemy symbols to the toys and robots
of the '30s and '40s and the 1950s hipster color of pink. His father
made a living painting, restoring and customizing cars. Ryden grew up
in Southern California and graduated with a fine arts degree in 1987
from Art Center College of Design in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   He first made his mark as an illustrator of album covers for major
record labels in Los Angeles and New York. When he paints now, he
listens to mixes of '50s lounge music by artists such as Martin Denny
and Les Baxter.</TE>
<TE>   Ryden began exhibiting as a fine artist in group shows six years
ago and landed his first solo exhibition, "The Meat Show," in Los
Angeles in 1998. Grand Central is his second solo show in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   The father of Jasper, 8, and Rosie, 3, with his wife, Carolyn,
also an artist, Ryden spends his days juggling bills, bringing in
groceries and running a publishing business called Porterhouse, which
prints his limited editions.</TE>
<TE>   Domestic duties and the business side of art continually tug at
Ryden's creative flow. The paintings for "Bunnies and Bees" took him
two years to complete. It's in the wee hours of the night that Ryden
trolls swap meet treasures searching for something magical.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a mood thing. The sun goes down and there's a spirit and
energy," Ryden said. "Those are quiet, tranquil hours with no
interruptions. I put on music and get in my own world and start to
paint."</TE>

<HD>Creating a Providential Bridge Between Rich, Poor</HD>
<DH>Art* Students at the Rhode Island School of Design become
immersed in a far less privileged world via the Art ConText program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD LEWIS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PROVIDENCE, R.I.</DL>
<LD>The first sign that things are different at the Olneyville branch of
the city library is the colored portraits on the building's facade.</LD>
<LD>   The enlarged negatives are of people who live in this run-down,
forgotten section of the Renaissance City. They are from Guatemala,
Cambodia, Peru and Hong Kong. Some look happy, some sad, others
distant.</LD>
<LD>   Despite initial resistance, 17 students from the Rhode Island
School of Design met Olneyville's residents and used art to show who
they are. Their interpretations--reflected in videos, photos
sandblasted onto glass and a light fixture--are on display at the
branch library until March 2.</LD>
<TE>   The project's idea came from David McGee, a painter from Houston
who is a professor in residence for the semester in the school's Art
ConText program. McGee wanted to take his students, from privileged
backgrounds, into a world they knew little about and to highlight
people who live mostly anonymous lives.</TE>
<TE>   "These are people who no one's going to write about, but who mean
something to this community," McGee said.</TE>
<TE>   Tatiana Gelardi tutored 6- to 8-year-old Cambodian girls at the
library, but she wanted more insight into them and other children.</TE>
<TE>   So, for her project, the 22-year-old industrial design major made
a set of six cushions arranged in a pinwheel on which children could
draw. There, the youngsters could express their feelings through
sketches of their family, themselves or anything else.</TE>
<TE>   "What makes this special is their creativity, their energy and
absorbing me in what they do," Gelardi said. The children, besides
being friends, give her unfiltered opinions on her design ideas, she
says. "They're always really honest. Either they like it or they
don't."</TE>
<TE>   The school's students first visited Olneyville--a poor
neighborhood in the southwest section of a thriving city--in
September.</TE>
<TE>   They walked through the neighborhood of eroding buildings infested
with rats and trash clotted in abandoned lots. Their home base was
the library, set in a fading commercial district amid pawnshops, a
record store pumping rap music and a porn store in full view from its
windows.</TE>
<TE>   Initial Resistance to the Project</TE>
<TE>   Some of the female students were accosted on subsequent trips,
McGee said. Many students doubted the project would succeed.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed ridiculous in a way," said Devon Butler, a 21-year-old
photographer who created the pictorial exhibit on the library's
front. "It seemed like us versus them."</TE>
<TE>   "There was resistance to it," McGee acknowledged. "It's hard to go
up and meet people. When you see people walking around and you say,
'Can I take your photo?' and they say, 'Uh, uh, uh ...,'" motioning
with his arms as if pushing someone away.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the students chose people associated with the library,
said Jodi Apicelli, an employee there. The children participated
because they wanted to make friends, and the adults, mainly
immigrants, were eager to meet those entrenched in a land new to
them, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Others explored beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Howard Rhee chose a 21-year-old employee at the adult bookstore
next to the library identified only as Jorge, and created a biography
of sorts about him.</TE>
<TE>   Rhee said he was at first intimidated by the assignment.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe I'm not the most obvious candidate for someone to do that.
I could have easily done someone in my everyday walk of life," Rhee
said. "I felt like I wanted to push myself to meet someone I wouldn't
normally have met. I think that's what David wanted for us to do, to
go beyond our comfortable boundaries."</TE>
<TE>   McGee, 39, has painted oil-based portraits of people he met since
coming to Providence in early September. Nine of his works are on
display at the school's museum.</TE>
<TE>   His own pursuit was the inspiration for the class project. He said
the students' creations surpassed his expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "They were empowered by people they wouldn't have met," he said.
"They discovered their own sense of self by going outside their
selves. They not only learned something about themselves, but made
friends along the way."</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Bill Tush's exit from Cable News Network marks the end of an era that
predates even his 18 years on "Showbiz Today."</LD>
<LD>   Tush was working for Ted Turner before CNN was ever thought of,
back when Turner's Channel 17, a future superstation destined to
blanket the country, was seen only by Atlantans, few of whom watched
it.</LD>
<LD>   During nearly three decades at Turner Broadcasting, Tush served
his audience in a variety of on-air roles.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, he served his boss as a steadfast confederate,
an easygoing wise guy who, early on, was nothing less than the public
face of Turner's scrappy fledgling empire.</TE>
<TE>   Today that empire is vast yet dwarfed by the corporate leviathan
it's part of. Worse, last year's merger of TBS owner Time Warner and
AOL largely stripped Turner of his powers. Clearly, an epoch had come
to a close.</TE>
<TE>   All the more so now, with Tush gone.</TE>
<TE>   But why did he stay?</TE>
<TE>   "People have asked, 'Why didn't you leave years ago?'" Tush says.
"I'd answer, 'Why leave? It's too much fun!'</TE>
<TE>   "I went from working for a broken-down TV station to working for
one of the largest entertainment corporations in the world--and never
changed my resume. I mean, my resume says I weigh 155 pounds and I'm
single. That was three wives ago!"</TE>
<TE>   After spending the morning clearing out his office at CNN's New
York bureau, Tush, a boyish-looking 53, sits down to lunch. He looks
chipper, relaxed.</TE>
<TE>   "No regrets," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Or, rather, only one: The way news of his departure was lumped in
last month with the announcement of several CNN firings.</TE>
<TE>   He explains that his leaving was by choice, precipitated by CNN's
dearth of show business coverage (with a consequent lack of anything
for him to do) in the somber weeks after Sept. 11. The world changed
that day, and for the foreseeable future, Tush reasoned, so had CNN.</TE>
<TE>   He was ready for a change too.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't working for Ted anymore," notes Tush (whom Turner, in a
statement, called "as loyal as he is talented"). "I've been there 28
years, and my job always came first." But now, with Lisa, his wife of
three years, "I'm happy with my personal life for the first time in
my life. I'm not dying to be on television."</TE>
<TE>   It was in 1974 that the Pittsburgh-born radio personality broke
into TV by wangling a part-time job at Atlanta's WTCG (grandly
signifying "Turner Communications Group"), a local non-network UHF
outlet with a minuscule audience and scant programming besides pro
wrestling and old movies.</TE>
<TE>   Hired to tape announcements for an hour daily, he soon was on
camera as the overnight newscaster, reading wire copy between the
movies that ran until dawn.</TE>
<TE>   "Then, one night, someone in the studio threw a balled-up piece of
paper at me," Tush recalls. "It bounced off my head while I kept on
reading. And one thing led to another."</TE>
<TE>   With Turner's amused blessing, Tush and his cronies pushed to come
up with new foolishness night after night.</TE>
<TE>   Tush introduced a correspondent called the Unknown Newsman who
wore a paper sack on his head. Another night, just before air time,
he fed peanut butter to a German shepherd clad in shirt and tie. As
the pooch worked its jaws to swallow the goop, it appeared to be
co-anchoring the newscast.</TE>
<TE>   Here, a quarter-century ago, was Comedy Central's "The Daily Show"
stripped down to raw abandon, on zero bucks. Around Atlanta, Tush
began to gain a cult following.</TE>
<TE>   Then Turner had the wacky inspiration to transmit Channel 17 by
satellite. Just one result of the rechristened WTBS Superstation:
Tush became a hit in Alaska, where the hamlet of Valdez tapped him to
be grand marshal of its winter festival parade. He bought snow boots
and grabbed a flight.</TE>
<TE>   But he already had proved he was game for anything. "Besides the
crazy news, I hosted the Saturday and Sunday morning movies. I did
all the commercials. I moderated the public-affairs talk show."
Sometimes he pushed a camera or drove to the post office to pick up
the mail.</TE>
<TE>   "I had my own TV station to play with," he says. And, with it, a
mandate to play out the whims of his mercurial and charismatic boss.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, one day Turner returned from lunch with a
brainstorm. "He said, 'We're gonna start a variety show. We're gonna
have everything: comedy, singin', maybe even wrasslin'. You're gonna
host it!' I said, 'OK.'"</TE>
<TE>   Premiering on WTBS in January 1980, "Tush" proved to be an
inventive sketch-comedy hour with a troupe including Jan Hooks (who
went on to "Saturday Night Live" and "3rd Rock From the Sun") and
Bonnie and Terry Turner (creators of "That '70s Show").</TE>
<TE>   "Tush" ran for 22 episodes, then abruptly got the ax. "For some
reason Ted wasn't fond of it," recalls its star. "I said, 'So we'll
do something else fun.'"</TE>
<TE>   Soon Tush was jetting north each week to host "Atlantic City
Alive," a sort of $1.98 "Ed Sullivan Show" and "probably one of the
worst shows ever on television," he says with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   For a time he was dispatched to Los Angeles for an entertainment
talk show airing on Turner's new network, CNN.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in 1983, he helped introduce CNN's "Showbiz Today," which
brought him to New York.</TE>
<TE>   "I interviewed movie stars and TV stars. I did the Academy Awards
every year. I went to Cannes. I've seen and done things I never would
have done," says Tush, even now sounding a bit amazed.</TE>
<TE>   Then, idly envisioning the day he takes another job, he offers a
scenario.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had my choice," he muses, "I'd like to find a local UHF
station and do a crazy news show in the middle of the night."</TE>
<TE>   Grab the Jif! Cue the dog!</TE>

<LD>   'Mind' Leaves Some Things to Imagination</LD>
<LD>   Certain aspects of John Nash's life weren't explored in the movie
"A Beautiful Mind," in which Russell Crowe stars as the tortured,
Nobel Prize-winning mathematician who overcame schizophrenia. One of
them, Crowe said, was "a certain adventurousness in his sexuality,"
which Sylvia Nasar suggests in her biography of Nash.</LD>
<TE>   "And that was a big question for us, how far to go into that,"
Crowe tells Entertainment Weekly in the issue hitting the stands
today. "It was relevant to his character, but we didn't want to imply
that there was any possibility that schizophrenia and homosexuality
are related. That would be ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   If you look at the film closely enough, though, you'll notice a
reference to Nash's sexuality, observed Crowe, who received a Golden
Globe nomination and rave reviews for his effort. "There's a scene
where Nash is walking down a corridor at Princeton and he fixes a
young man walking towards him with a gaze. The extra turns around and
goes, 'Wow, what was that about?'" the 37-year-old actor said. "You
don't need a whole scene for everything--there are grace notes that
you can do."</TE>
<TE>   Crowe also discussed "Texas," his debut as a documentary
filmmaker, during a news conference in Beverly Hills. After putting
together video of himself and his rock band, 30 Odd Foot of Grunts,
playing and hanging out in Austin, Texas, he showed it to Miramax
chief Harvey Weinstein, who liked it enough to buy it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very raw, very rude, and it puts me in an incredibly bad
light," Crowe said of the movie, which premieres at the Sundance Film
Festival on Jan. 17.</TE>

<TE>   Slash Persona Non Grata at GNR Concert</TE>
<TE>   Former Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash's plan to check out his
estranged bandmate Axl Rose on stage last weekend was scrapped by
Rose's representatives, who informed him that he wouldn't be allowed
into the Las Vegas concert hall.</TE>
<TE>   Slash, who officially left GNR in 1996 and has remained alienated
from the temperamental Rose, had arranged through a friend to attend
Saturday's show at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, where
Rose was playing with his new Guns N' Roses lineup for only the
second time.</TE>
<TE>   That didn't seem like a good idea to Rose's manager, Doug
Goldstein. "We didn't know what his intentions were," Goldstein told
The Times this week. "If nothing else, it would have been a
distraction. Axl was really nervous about these shows. We decided on
our own not to take any risk."</TE>
<TE>   Goldstein sent an assistant to discuss the issue with Slash, who
agreed to cancel his reservation. Slash told The Times on Thursday
that four hotel security guards accompanied the representative to his
room and made it clear that he wouldn't be admitted to the show.</TE>
<TE>   "They said no way. I knew things were being blown way out of
proportion. It was like being grabbed by my hair and being ripped
back into the days of when I was in Guns N' Roses.... I was going to
see the show just like anybody else, and to be supportive, for what
that's worth. I spent the last six years trying to stay out of the
nastiness that does go on. If Axl had heard I was there and sent
somebody down to go, 'You want to come up and jam on "Paradise City"
or "Welcome to the Jungle"?' I would have done it."</TE>

<TE>   Local Group Tops 2001 Album Charts</TE>
<TE>   Linkin Park, the youthful-spirited Southern California rock 'n'
rap group, has a lot to celebrate these days. Not only was its
"Hybrid Theory" just declared the best-selling album of 2001 by
SoundScan, but the album also continues to climb the sales chart.</TE>
<TE>   The collection, which was released in the fall of 2000, sold 4.8
million copies last year to edge Shaggy's "Hotshot" as the year's
biggest seller by approximately 300,000 copies. During its months on
the chart, oddly, "Hybrid Theory" never registered higher than No. 7
until this week, when it jumped to No. 2.</TE>
<TE>   With sales of 263,000 copies last week, Linkin Park trailed only
Creed's "Weathered," which sold 398,000 to maintain the top spot on
the chart for the sixth consecutive week.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the year's 10 bestsellers, in order: 'N Sync's
"Celebrity," Enya's "A Day Without Rain," Staind's "Break the Cycle,"
Alicia Keys' "Songs in A Minor," Destiny's Child's "Survivor,"
Creed's "Weathered," the "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" soundtrack and
the sixth volume of the "Now That's What I Call Music" hits
collection.</TE>
<TE>   Total album sales for the year were 762.8 million, down 2.8% from
2000--the first time annual album sales have dropped since SoundScan
began monitoring sales in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Jorge Mester has signed a five-year extension to his contract,
ensuring that he will continue as music director of the Pasadena
Symphony through the 2006-7 season.... Backstreet Boy Nick Carter was
arrested on suspicion of refusing to follow police officers' orders
to leave a Tampa, Fla., nightclub after a fight broke out. The
youngest of the five-member pop group at age 21, Carter was charged
early Wednesday with a misdemeanor count of resisting/opposing a law
enforcement officer without violence. He was handcuffed, placed in a
squad car and released on his own recognizance. His first court
appearance is set for March 4, Tampa Police spokesman Joe Durkin said
Thursday.... Dan Aykroyd will trade on a bit of his "Ghostbusters"
fame when he launches a new talk show, "Dan Aykroyd's Out There," a
combination of celebrity talk and the paranormal, on the Sci-Fi
Channel this spring.</TE>

<HD>An Eloquence in Yek's Vibrant Paintings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For nearly five years, Yek has combined the razor-sharp graphics of
space-age cartoons with the seemingly infinite expansiveness of
atmospheric abstraction by using an airbrush to spray candy-colored
coats of paint on concave panels of various dimensions. Resembling
cybernetic sunsets, or neon-enhanced screen savers, his hyper-refined
paintings have the presence of portals: trippy windows out of which
whooshes all the air in the room. To stand before one is to feel an
irresistible tug on your body, not to mention your imagination.</LD>
<LD>   At Mark Moore Gallery, six dazzling new works by the Las Vegas
painter (who dropped his last name to prevent his art from being read
as a sign of his ethnic identity) make his earlier panels look
old-fashioned, almost quaint in the way they play two dimensions
against three. Picture the view through the curved windshield of the
Starship Enterprise when Capt. Kirk commands, "Warp speed ahead," and
you'll have an idea of the magnitude of the leap these paintings take
as they propel viewers into illusionistic deep space.</LD>
<LD>   They are a pleasure to see and a pain to describe. Like the art of
Edward Ruscha, which invites sophisticated explanations while making
them sound silly, Yek's abstract images leave words in the dust,
struggling to catch up with each painting's silent eloquence.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the action takes place in the top third of his square
panels, which measure between 3 and 5 feet on a side. For example,
the bottom third of "Glitch" is an expanse of nothing but warm
glowing gray. As your eye glides upward, it discerns five or six
faint vertical bands in which tints of aqua, blue and lavender become
increasingly evident. These tones intensify, becoming, in the top
third, eye-popping expanses of ethereal colors whose subtle
gradations and super-saturated tones make rainbows look dull by
comparison.</TE>
<TE>   To emphasize the crisp edges where these vertical bands meet, Yek
has adorned most of them with swooping arcs and curved vectors in
multihued magenta. Like a racing stripe with a mind of its own, this
broken linear element dances in fits and starts across the painting,
forming an indecipherable hieroglyph that makes visual, if not
linguistic, sense.</TE>
<TE>   The other five paintings orchestrate wildly diverse variations on
this format, which recalls Roy Lichtenstein's Pop paintings of
mirrors. Titled "Rough," "Sweet," "Clear," "Blink" and "Plush," they
flaunt Yek's skills as a colorist. Playing fiery fluorescent oranges
against soft pastel pinks and sizzling burgundies against
melted-chocolate browns, he even makes black look bright and vibrant,
abuzz with so much visual energy that you can't help but be drawn
into it.</TE>
<TE>   All of Yek's paintings employ Baroque theatrics to pull your eyes
outward and upward. You don't read them from top to bottom or left to
right as much as you scan them like split-screen monitors on which
single stories are told from five or six perspectives simultaneously.
If these heady works don't blow your mind, they'll expand it.</TE>

<TE>   Field of Dreams: "Elysian Fields," Won Ju Lim's Los Angeles solo
debut at Patrick Painter Gallery, makes a strong first impression. To
step into the large darkened space is to feel as if you've entered a
mysterious world where light and shadow dance around your capacity to
distinguish illusion from reality.</TE>
<TE>   The young L.A. artist has engineered this pleasantly disorienting
effect by placing dozens of abstract forms in the floor's center and
projecting nighttime images of an oil refinery on three walls.
Ordinary desk lamps shine like miniature streetlights over the
objects on the floor, casting long shadows and throwing errant
reflections on all four walls.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, the two- and three-dimensional components of Lim's
installation play off one another nicely, blurring the border between
objects and images by confounding distinctions between abstraction
and representation. As you keep looking, however, the elaborately
staged setup becomes too arbitrary and unresolved to sustain your
interest in a satisfying way.</TE>
<TE>   The elements on the floor are 3-D models of floor plans Lim copied
from catalogs for do-it-yourself home builders. Stacked atop one
another and laid out side by side, her plexiglass-and-foam core
sculptures look less like a jampacked urban plan and more like a
bargain bin filled with customized drawer dividers, homemade
organizers designed to keep the silverware from getting messed up.
Her video and slide projections are too generic to do much more than
register a vague interest in things architectural and cinematic.</TE>
<TE>   The best feature of Lim's exhibition is its dreaminess.
Unfortunately, this quality is better realized in photographs of her
installation than in the work itself. Bigger is not always better,
and scaling back can sometimes be expansive.</TE>

<TE>   Deliberate Frankness: Charles Karubian's 10 new oils on canvas use
the bold strokes of gestural expressionism to embody psychological
states of unexpected complexity. At Newspace Gallery, the young
artist's depictions of larger-than-life-size individuals standing
before blank backgrounds and even larger images of empty landscapes
give rise to a type of introspection rarely found in big figurative
pictures, especially ones in which bravura brushwork stands in for
the artist's indomitable ego.</TE>
<TE>   Karubian never gets in the way of viewers who want to look for
themselves. Although he paints with confident verve, covering chunks
of canvas with decisively applied smears of subdued color, you never
get the sense that his compositions are merely excuses to sling paint
around freely.</TE>
<TE>   The tried and true pleasures of making a painting take a backseat
to the experience of looking at a work. Across the worn surfaces of
each, pigment is doled out parsimoniously, as if it were too precious
a treasure to be used for such mundane purposes. Plenty of thinner is
mixed into each color, giving it the viscosity of a beleaguered soup
kitchen's main dish and the emotional tenor of a stingy barkeep's
watered-down whiskey.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the luck-gone-bad atmosphere of Karubian's strangely
endearing works is the dirty gray tint that suffuses their queasy
greens, jaundiced yellows, faded blues and soiled browns. It isn't
hard to imagine that all of the colors in his palette have been mixed
with the turpentine in which he washed his brushes. Such frugality is
true to the humility that suffuses the paintings, which, despite
their aw-shucks simplicity, are fueled by significant ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   The solitary people in the six anonymous portraits look as if
they'd be happier if you would just have the courtesy to stop staring
at them. Profoundly uncomfortable in their own skins, these generic
thirtysomethings give vivid form to the desire to disappear into
one's surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   But Karubian is too cruel a master to let them get away with such
escapist fantasies. Each of his rigidly frozen figures stands as a
monument to those painful pauses in conversations when easygoing
give-and-take grinds to a halt and one party feels so self-conscious
that he hopes a chasm opens beneath his feet and the earth swallows
him up.</TE>
<TE>   To stand before Karubian's paintings is to enter a series of
dialogues in which this happens with unsettling frequency. Even his
four landscapes are too discomfiting to get lost in. With uncanny
power, these stubbornly blunt pictures keep viewers riveted to the
here and now. This moment may not be fabulous or grand, but in
Karubian's hands, it bristles with unspoken intimacies.</TE>

<DH>Music* A tribute album to the late Webb Pierce, organized

legendary performer.</DH>

<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>Growing up in Seattle, country singer Gail Davies remembers spying
through heating vents with the other kids as her parents and their
friends danced to Webb Pierce's honky-tonk music.</LD>
<LD>   "To us, the coolest thing in the world was to be in that room with
the adults dancing to Webb Pierce," said Davies, who scored a string
of hits in the 1980s.</LD>
<LD>   "My first single when I grew up and got a record deal was
[Pierce's] 'No Love Have I.'"</LD>
<TE>   Davies, 53, has gathered an impressive group of country music
stars for a tribute album, "Caught in the Webb: A Tribute to the
Legendary Webb Pierce," on Audium Records.</TE>
<TE>   Dwight Yoakam, Robbie Fulks, Crystal Gayle, George Jones, Mandy
Barnett, Emmylou Harris, Allison Moorer, Lionel Cartwright, Willie
Nelson and Billy Walker are among those on the album.</TE>
<TE>   The music they celebrate hasn't dominated mainstream country since
Pierce's heyday in the 1950s and '60s. The songs, propelled by twin
fiddles and weeping steel guitar, talk about the temptations of
drinking ("There Stands the Glass"), two-timing ("Back Street
Affair") and love gone wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "I've worked with the same engineer for years now," Davies said.
"He came to me after the sessions and told me he couldn't get the
melodies to Webb's songs out of his head.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him that's because they have melodies. So much of the
stuff done today doesn't even bother with it."</TE>
<TE>   Pierce dominated country music in the 1950s with hits such as
"Wondering," "In the Jailhouse Now" and "Honky Tonk Song."</TE>
<TE>   Pierce was 69 when he died of cancer in 1991. By that time he'd
become better known for his colorful, sometimes abrasive personality.
His singing style--nasal and occasionally off pitch--is the stuff
that parodies of country music thrive on. He courted the attention of
Nashville tourists with a guitar-shaped swimming pool and a
convertible studded with silver dollars.</TE>
<TE>   One widely told story has a fellow country music star complaining
that Pierce made himself too accessible to tourists, compromising
their neighborhood's privacy. Pierce replied: "Well, you shouldn't
have moved so close to a star."</TE>
<TE>   The idea for the tribute album was born when Davies was
interviewed by a disc jockey for a show last February that marked the
10th anniversary of Pierce's death. She mentioned her desire to make
a tribute album.</TE>
<TE>   "The next morning I got an e-mail from [Pierce's daughter]
Deborah. It said that she and Webb's wife, Audrey, had heard the
interview and wanted to know if I was serious about doing a tribute."</TE>
<TE>   The three women met at one of Davies' Nashville shows and started
planning the album.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any money," Davies said. "I've had 18 hit records
and I don't know how many in the Top 10, and I've never seen a
royalty check from a record label in my life.</TE>
<TE>   "I decided I could sell my Rolex watch, which is the only thing of
value that I have left. Then the musicians, especially [the band]
BR549, said, 'Don't do it, don't sell your watch. Get the guys to
play for nothing.'"</TE>
<TE>   She announced that album proceeds would go to the Minnie Pearl
Cancer Research Foundation and the Country Music Hall of Fame and
Museum, then started making phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody said no," she said. "There were a few conflicts with
schedules, which stopped Mark Knopfler from being on it, but that was
all."</TE>
<TE>   The album was recorded in two daylong sessions last June. Several
stars backed out when told how quickly the album had to be recorded
to save money.</TE>
<TE>   "A couple of people I had to go, 'Look, if you can't sing, don't
come,'" she said. "I don't have time to do overdubs or 15 vocals. I
don't do Pro Tools [computer software used by many stars to correct
their voices if they hit bad notes].</TE>
<TE>   "You show up, you get two passes at your vocal....There were a
couple of people who panicked when I said that and backed out, but
their names will go unmentioned. Lovely people, but it was scary for
them."</TE>
<TE>   The result is a grab bag of talented singers, among them Grand Ole
Opry stars such as Walker and Charley Pride, mainstream stars such as
Pam Tillis and Nelson, and critical favorites like Fulks and Dale
Watson.</TE>
<TE>   Cartwright, who scored the No. 1 hit "Leap of Faith" in 1991,
expertly replicates Pierce's trademark vocal yelps on the No. 1 hit
from 1952.</TE>
<TE>   "I did it because Gail asked me," said Cartwright, who writes TV
background music. "There was a real good feeling on the sessions, no
pressure ... to come up with a hit, which was refreshing."</TE>
<TE>   Davies said she doesn't expect "Caught in the Webb" to spark a
honky-tonk revival.</TE>
<TE>   "The only other goal we had for it was to help get Webb into the
Country Music Hall of Fame," she said. "We recorded the album in
June, and they announced he was going in in August.</TE>
<TE>   "So there's no goal but to enjoy the music. And let people know
that there's more to Webb Pierce than guitar-shaped swimming pools."</TE>

<HD>Translating Tolkien for the Screen</HD>
<DH>Movies* David Salo followed languages to the letter in
writing Elvish for 'The Lord of the Rings.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNY PRICE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>MADISON, Wis.</DL>
<LD>David Salo is an expert in languages that exist only in the imaginary
world of hobbits and elves.</LD>
<LD>   He has immersed himself in Quenya and Sindarin, languages created
by author J.R.R. Tolkien for the inhabitants of Middle-earth in his
"The Lord of the Rings" trilogy.</LD>
<LD>   So when filmmakers adapting the fantasy epic wanted to translate
parts of their script from English into the two Elvish languages,
they turned to Salo, a graduate student in linguistics at the
University of Wisconsin in Madison.</LD>
<TE>   "I know it a lot better than most of the foreign languages I've
studied," the 32-year-old said.</TE>
<TE>   Salo, who is studying Tocharian, an Indo-European language spoken
in medieval China, said his interest in Tolkien's languages started
at age 6 or 7, when he read "The Lord of the Rings."</TE>
<TE>   The story follows hobbit Frodo Baggins on a quest, under the
guidance of the wizard Gandalf, to destroy the all-powerful ring
coveted by the dark lord Sauron.</TE>
<TE>   "All these neat names and words and you want to know, 'What do
they mean?'" Salo said.</TE>
<TE>   In the seven years between his undergraduate studies at Macalester
College in St. Paul, Minn., where he studied Latin and Greek, and
graduate school in Madison, Salo learned everything he could about
Tolkien's Elvish languages.</TE>
<TE>   When he heard about plans to film "The Lord of the Rings," he
wrote director Peter Jackson and the film's producers. His letter
made two points: It was important to get Tolkien's Elvish languages
right, and Salo could help. A few months later, the producers called.</TE>
<TE>   "I was shocked," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Before the film began shooting in New Zealand, Salo worked with
set and costume designers, writing short verses that could be
inscribed on swords and other props.</TE>
<TE>   Tolkien created many languages, including Quenya and Sindarin,
which Salo said are related the way English and German are.</TE>
<TE>   Quenya resembles ancient Greek, while Sindarin is modeled on
Welsh, Salo said, but Tolkien took borrowed elements of Latin,
Finnish and Hebrew.</TE>
<TE>   Some sample words: In Sindarin, the word for hobbit is periain,
ang is iron, duath means darkness; hir means lord. In Quenya, parma
means book, anga is iron, heru is lord, lumbule is darkness.</TE>
<TE>   Translating dialogue took educated guesses on Salo's part, since
Tolkien never published a guide.</TE>
<TE>   "He gives little hints here and there. So you look at that, you
look at the patterns, and you extrapolate," Salo said.</TE>
<TE>   Once hired, Salo sent a tape of himself speaking the Elvish
languages to Andrew Jack and Roisin Carty, the film's dialect and
language coaches, so they could teach the actors, including Cate
Blanchett, Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler and Elijah Wood.</TE>
<TE>   The filmmakers relied on Salo on the 15-month shoot, which
included making Parts 2 and 3, due in theaters in 2002 and 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "They would suddenly call me up at midnight ... and say, 'We need
you to write us a line of dialogue for the shooting tomorrow,'" Salo
said.</TE>
<TE>   He said it wouldn't take him long to comply. "When you've been
working with this for a while, it becomes like a second language."</TE>

<HD>Bamana Exhibition Reflects the Nature of Life in Mali</HD>
<DH>Art* A show of almost 100 objects, photos and videos at the
Museum for African Art allows visitors a glimpse into a unique
culture and religion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHERINE ROTH</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>For the Bamana people of West Africa, the power of nature is tapped
by kicking up the dust and making noise, bringing along brightly
painted puppets and awe-inspiring masks to harness positive energy,
rein in chaos and keep evil at bay.</LD>
<LD>   Through almost 100 objects and photos and a half-dozen videos,
"Bamana: The Art of Existence in Mali," at the Museum for African Art
in Manhattan, takes an unprecedented look at a Malian art, culture
and religion that in many ways is a paradigm for other West African
traditions.</LD>
<LD>   "Basically, they believe that everything contains a force--nyama,"
said Frank Herreman, who organized the show with photographer
Catherine de Clippel and anthropologist-filmmaker Jean-Paul Colleyn.</LD>
<TE>   "Nyama is in everything, and if you have nyama in you and you can
spread it out you become an important person. If you can manage the
nyama which is in the things around you, you become a very powerful
person indeed.</TE>
<TE>   "The real art of living is mastering the forces that are in
nature," Herreman said, explaining that, for the Bamana, art,
culture, society and religion are intertwined. "The show goes from
the public to the secret. When you come into the exhibition, it's
like stepping into a village in the Bamana region" in southwestern
Mali.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition allows visitors to glimpse Bamana artistic language
through ritualistic and practical objects, most from the 19th and
20th centuries but some as old as the 15th century.</TE>
<TE>   "You see some ceramics; you see the iron staffs, which are carried
by leaders. Then you go into the social organizations and you see
that young boys' and girls' organizations exist to create a social
tolerance in the community," he said. "And there are the organizers
of the puppet theater."</TE>
<TE>   Gallery by gallery, visitors delve deeper into the spiritual world
of the Bamana, where replacing negative with positive forces is
paramount.</TE>
<TE>   Wooden puppets painted in brilliant reds and blues dramatize local
social issues and are carried through the village as part of a
social-spiritual drama in which participants move, dance, kick up
dust, make noises and create short skits.</TE>
<TE>   One puppet from the 1960s (a time when African nations were
gaining independence) shows what is probably an image of French
President Charles de Gaulle with his head in a chicken's feathery
tail. Today, similar puppets are more likely to illustrate problems
such as AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing you should never forget is that these masks and theater
are very close, and they have to make a dramatic appearance. If
you're a Roman Catholic, you have churches, and the churches contain
statues of saints that are used to help inspire," Herreman said. "But
what happens when suddenly that spirit becomes alive? That's what a
mask does. It's like a saint, but it dances and moves. It goes
through the community, and you're not quite sure what it's going to
do. That's very important."</TE>
<TE>   Nyama, or life force, is also activated through the mastering of
secret knowledge that the Bamana find in initiation societies.
Consequently, all artworks created for ritual purposes contain nyama.
Sculptures of shapely women introduce the Bamana to sexuality and
fertility. Bulky wooden masks of hyenas or paint-speckled lions help
the elderly come to terms with death.</TE>
<TE>   A powerful form believed to sustain energies of huge force under
enormous pressure is found in the boliw, an intimidating sculptural
form vaguely resembling a buffalo. It is molded from vegetation and
soil and coated with layers of blood, hair and other organic
substances.</TE>
<TE>   The show ends with a display of elegant antelope
headpieces--Ci-wara--worn strapped to the head as part of an
elaborate costume in agricultural rituals. They are often made in
pairs, with male and female versions.</TE>
<TE>   "They're about learning how to manage the land. This Ci-wara is in
a way a supernatural being that is incarnated as an animal to teach
you how to survive."</TE>
<TE>   The show, composed of works on loan from various U.S. collections,
is on view through March 3. A version of the exhibit featuring pieces
from European collections is at the Rietberg Museum in Zurich. After
New York, the show is set to travel nationally and internationally.</TE>

<HD>Christian Music Stations Expand Pulpit on the Web</HD>
<DH>Group that owns KFSH starts four online services for niche
audiences too limited for standard radio.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>Washington</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON--They're using the latest Internet technology to relay a
message more than 2,000 years old, and presenting it in enough
formats to please almost anyone who wants to hear it.</LD>
<LD>   This month, the Los Angeles-area Christian music and talk radio
stations owned by Salem Communications Corp. are launching four
Web-only stations aimed at kids, teens, young adults and older
listeners.</LD>
<LD>   The company hopes to reach audiences that are too small locally to
warrant the exclusive attention of its broadcast radio stations yet
are vast and underserved when seen as a national aggregate, said Dave
Armstrong, vice president and general manager of the KKLA
Communications Group. The company, a subsidiary of the Camarillo,
Calif.-based Salem, includes Christian talk station KKLA-FM (99.5),
contemporary Christian music station KFSH-FM (95.9), talk station
KRLA-AM (870) and the Internet-only Christian Pirate Radio, or CPR.</LD>
<TE>   "In almost every market in the country, there's going to be a rock
station, a country station," said Armstrong, noting that the same
isn't the case for Christian music. "There's a need for it in almost
every market in the U.S. The Internet became an affordable way to do
this."</TE>
<TE>   The KKLA group already offers Internet streams of KKLA and KFSH,
as well as the Web-only CPR and CPRXtreme, which feature alternative
and heavy-metal Christian music.</TE>
<TE>   Joining those this week are the new online offerings--CPR Kids,
with stories and music for the under-12 set; CPR Classic, sort of a
Christian music oldies station; Fish Net, an online version of the
contemporary Christian format heard on KFSH; and CPR Celebration. The
latter is an "alternative praise and worship" channel that will
feature tunes akin to the modern music heard at many churches
nowadays, "more overtly worshipful in its lyrics" than what is heard
on KFSH, Armstrong said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the company will introduce CPR-TV, a 24-hour online
offering of Christian music videos. All are available through the CPR
site, www.mycpr.com.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel this is going to serve the needs of an entire family,"
Armstrong said, and fit even smaller niches in the niche of Christian
programming.</TE>
<TE>   A broadcast station would find it impossible to attract a large
enough audience within its listening area to stay in business by
playing nothing but one of these formats. But by airing over the
Internet, the Salem folks believe, such a station could reach small
groups of listeners nationwide--worldwide, even--that in totality
could exceed the audience of a terrestrial station in a major market.
Armstrong said Christian Pirate Radio has reached as many as 200,000
listeners in a month, for example. Salem is well entrenched in the
Christian media marketplace, with holdings that include 83 Christian
radio stations nationwide, a radio network of news and talk
programming with 1,600 affiliates, and a Christian music magazine,
among other interests.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the music, the CPR Web site features news and
reviews, links to buy albums, a chat room and a "Daily Devotional."
For those unfamiliar with the term "pirate radio" and its
anti-establishment connotation, the CPR site also features a page
explaining the moniker, assuring listeners that it refers to the
service's nontraditional delivery, via the Internet, and its playing
of independent and alternative artists--nothing to do with pillaging
or wenching.</TE>
<TE>   The company has always seen promise online. Armstrong noted that
KKLA was the first radio station in Los Angeles to stream its content
on the World Wide Web, in 1995. The Internet-only CPR followed in
1997, with CPRXtreme the year after that.</TE>
<TE>   "The ideas come, sometimes, long before the technology," Armstrong
said. For example, the new stations that arrive this month weren't
feasible, he said, until the KKLA group paired with the L.A. company
Hiwire, which developed a system for Internet radio to insert
different advertisements into the commercial breaks depending on
where the listener is located. First-time users log onto the site and
register gender and ZIP code--information that allows advertisers to
target their messages even to specific neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   The system also solves a problem that had many radio stations
suspending their Internet streams: By playing commercials they were
airing over the radio on the Internet as well, they became liable for
additional payments to actors and agencies. With Web-only
commercials, advertisers don't have to pay more expensive national
rates.</TE>
<TE>   KKLA officials hope to follow with other genres, such as Yo! CPR,
a Christian rap and hip-hop channel, and a Christian-oriented country
music station, said Jim Tinker, vice president of operations for the
KKLA group.</TE>
<TE>   "Our desire is to provide additional Christian entertainment
channels," he said. "It would be nice if [these stations] paid for
themselves and brought some income for the company." Armstrong
believes eventually they will. The Web strategy allows Salem to take
a successful format like the Fish, an adult contemporary station
featuring artists such as Jaci Velasquez and Third Day instead of
Christina Aguilera and Sugar Ray, and spread it to markets where the
company doesn't yet own stations.</TE>
<TE>   Tinker compared the relationship between traditional radio
stations and their online counterparts with the way once-dominant AM
stations subsidized their FM sister stations in their fledgling days.
Now FM is the powerhouse side of the dial, and Tinker believes
Internet radio will dominate one day as well.</TE>
<TE>   "Who knows? By then we may have 25 different channels," Tinker
said. "You can get as niche-oriented as you want."</TE>

<HD>'Impostor' Invades the Mind</HD>
<DH>The sci-fi film based on Philip K. Dick's McCarthy-era
story, relies more on intelligence than special effects to tell a
tale of government paranoia.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A sci-fi thriller that relies more on intelligence than spectacular
action and special effects, "Impostor" could not be more timely as a
parable on the threat to civil liberties in a society endangered by
outside forces. Based on a 1953 Philip K. Dick short story written at
the height of the McCarthy era, the filmmakers set the time in the
not-so-distant future, 2079.</LD>
<LD>   Director Gary Fleder, his writers and crew persuasively project a
world in which much of the planet is guarded by electromagnetic
force-field domes to protect it from a decade-long attack by aliens,
who have already lain waste to many of Earth's cities. Democracy has
given way to global rule in stark steel-and-concrete high-tech
environments; surveillance has reached the point at which every human
being carries an implant in the spine so that virtually all activity
is liable to be monitored.</LD>
<TE>   Even in so controlled an environment, love thrives, and scientist
hero Spencer Olham (Gary Sinise), whose latest work promises to save
the planet, and his wife, Maya (Madeleine Stowe), a dedicated doctor
caring for victims of alien attacks in environments not yet protected
by domes, are sustained by their love for each other. Unfortunately,
the day arrives when Spence is targeted by the implacable Major
Hathaway (Vincent D'Onofrio) as a robot sent by the aliens, who have
managed to pierce the electromagnetic shield with a space capsule.
Spence manages to break free of Hathaway's clutches. On the run, he
strives to demonstrate his innocence and save the world at the same
time.</TE>
<TE>   "Impostor" is not exactly crystal clear or, for that matter,
consistently compelling, but it does a good job of making its main
point, which is to evoke the suffocating, ever-spiraling paranoia so
easily triggered in such an environment. Ultimately, it evokes a
pervasive feeling of uncertainty that lies at the heart of the human
condition, a feeling that logically will only intensify in a future
when it becomes increasingly difficult, if not downright impossible,
to distinguish the real from the artificial, even within one's self.</TE>
<TE>   Sinise and the supporting cast, which includes Mekhi Phifer and
Tony Shalhoub, are on target with their focused portrayals.
Production designer Nelson Coates and his staff, cinematographer
Robert Elswit and visual effects producer Joseph Grossberg have been
most resourceful in creating a plausible future world while drawing
on such contemporary structures as the Oakley eyewear factory, a
Philip K. Dick-inspired building, and science centers in California
and Arizona. Mark Isham's score is at once elegant and ominous, a
major asset in creating and sustaining a tense atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   "Impostor" is likely to be best appreciated by dedicated sci-fi
fans, admirers of Dick in particular. It hasn't the stupendous
razzle-dazzle of a mega-budget picture like "A.I. Artificial
Intelligence," and it isn't distinctive or riveting enough to make it
as an art film appealing to cineastes who may not be sci-fi buffs.
Even though "Impostor" has a middle-of-the-road feel, it does dare to
go for an ambiguous open ending.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for intense sci-fi violence, some sensuality
and language. Times guidelines: These elements are standard for the
genre, suitable for mature, older children.</TE>

<SM>Impostor review by Kevin Thomas for Fri. Jan. 4  IMPOSTOR. A
timely sci-fi thriller based on a Philip K. Dick short story, that
relies more on intelligence than spectacular action and special
effects. Set in 2079 and starring Gary Sinise as a scientist whose
latest work promises to save the planet from alien invaders yet has
been arrested as a robot created by the aliens. Neither blockbuster
not art film, it takes a middle-of-the road approach that is less
than compelling for moviegoers who are not diehard sci-fi fans. With
Madeleine Stowe, Vincent D'Onofrio, Mekhi Phifer. (Thomas, Jan. 4)
(1:36) Rated PG-13 for intense sci-fi violence, some sensuality and
language.</SM>

<LD>Sex, violence, drugs, suicide--the very staples of cable television,
right? But does a program offering these elements and more belong on
the HBO Family channel? What family do these folks have in mind, the
Manson family?</LD>
<LD>   As it turns out, "Middle School Confessions," despite the somewhat
lurid title, is a disquieting yet ultimately hopeful look at
previously adult issues that now are confronting an ever-younger
group of America's children (tonight, 9:15 to 10:30).</LD>
<LD>   Host Samuel L. Jackson makes brief appearances at the beginning
and end of the HBO original documentary, but the real stars are the
kids and their shell-shocked parents. "I want to have a happy,
well-adjusted child," one father says, "and it's just not working out
that way."</LD>
<TE>   Youngsters from 11 to 14 years old reveal to the camera details of
their extracurricular activities that had been scrupulously kept from
their parents, save for the occasional overheard phone conversation
or wadded-up note retrieved from the laundry.</TE>
<TE>   The program is divided into topics such as sex, alcohol,
depression and school absenteeism (one precocious 13-year-old manages
to land a spot in two segments), but the common denominator for
driving students into premature experimentation is peer pressure
combined with lack of communication with parents.</TE>
<TE>   "Middle School Confessions" is part of HBO Family's "Parent
Handbook" series that includes print and online materials made
available to children, parents and schools. The language is frank and
occasionally obscene, but as the program all too vividly points out,
it's probably nothing your middle-schooler hasn't already heard.</TE>

<LD>The holidays couldn't end soon enough for the broadcast networks, as
only Viacom-owned CBS and UPN improved on viewing levels versus the
corresponding week a year ago--before "Survivor" joined CBS' Thursday
lineup--en route to the former network's eighth consecutive weekly
ratings win, based on estimates issued by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   Notably, "Survivor: Africa" has experienced only modest gains
through the holidays opposite "Friends" reruns, making it interesting
to see how next week's final installment will fare. As it stands, the
program's third edition has been a success for CBS but has cooled
considerably compared with the second edition that launched last
January.</LD>
<LD>   Most other established series were in reruns last week, but
viewing of ABC and Fox still fell substantially compared with their
results during the final week of 2000. In fact, viewing of ABC was
down by nearly 4 million viewers versus the same week last year, when
the network was still riding the coattails of "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire."</LD>
<TE>   "Monday Night Football," meanwhile, played on Saturday for the
second week. Though tune-in rose from the pre-Christmas game, viewing
was still down more than 20% versus the final Monday night showing
last season.</TE>

<HD>At Last, a Stand-Up Year for Television</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ZURAWIK</AU>
<BD>BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a very good year for television viewers.</LD>
<LD>   There, I said it. I can't believe it either. After years of
looking back and grousing about the medium, I have to acknowledge
that television gave us one of the best years of our viewing lives on
a variety of programming fronts in 2001. And that's saying something
for a year that included the premieres of "Temptation Island" and
"Chains of Love."</LD>
<LD>   Here are 10 primary programming categories or genres and the shows
within them that brightened the television year.</LD>
<TE>   1. Drama. It was a somewhat uneven season for HBO's "The
Sopranos," but the highs were still sublime. Any year with "The
Sopranos" is a good year.</TE>
<TE>   Many of my colleagues are picking the "Pine Barrens" episode as
the best of the year. The hour featured Christopher (Michael
Imperioli) and Paulie (Tony Sirico) taking a Russian mobster for a
long walk deep into the New Jersey woods and then bungling their
attempt to kill him.</TE>
<TE>   Part "Fargo" and part "Waiting for Godot," it was a brilliant hour
of television, but my pick as the best episode is "University," which
took us inside the awful life of a young dancer at the Club
Bada-Bing. Her brutal death at the hands of one of Tony's (James
Gandolfini) lieutenants is one of the most powerful moments of
television ever seen. This is "Death of a Salesman" for the small
screen.</TE>
<TE>   2. New series. HBO struck gold again in Sunday-night drama with
"Six Feet Under," an exquisitely offbeat series about the Fishers, a
family of Los Angeles undertakers. Richly multidimensional and
culturally provocative, it breathes the same rarefied dramatic air as
"The Sopranos."</TE>
<TE>   Created by Academy Award winner Alan Ball ("American Beauty"), the
series dares to look death cold in the eye, and, in so doing, brings
a new kind of existential energy and sense of postmodern edge to
prime time. As with "The Sopranos," you have to go beyond television
to find an apt comparison. This is Joseph Heller doing the family
drama, a study in dysfunction.</TE>
<TE>   There were several other signs of new and intelligent life that
deserve mention: "Smallville" (WB), "Undeclared" (Fox), "The Bernie
Mac Show" (Fox), "Alias" (ABC), "24" (Fox) and "The Education of Max
Bickford" (CBS). None is a breakout hit. In fact, "Alias," "24" and
"Undeclared" are struggling to find an audience. But "24" and "Alias"
still deserve praise for taking the big risk of trying to do network
drama in new ways. As for "Max Bickford," I'm not quite ready to
renounce my less-than-enthusiastic review of the pilot, but I have to
admit I find myself returning to the show almost every week.</TE>
<TE>   3. Documentary. Last January, after seeing Ken Burns' "Jazz," I
was wondering whether we were living in a golden age of
documentaries. By the time "People Like Us: Social Class in America"
aired in October, I was convinced we are.</TE>
<TE>   Think back to the first syrupy notes of Louis Armstrong playing
"Stardust"--the opening of "Jazz"--and then try to recall some of
your favorite documentary moments of the year. There have been a lot,
ranging from "Living Dolls," the HBO films about the grotesque world
of child beauty pageants, to Rob Gardner's "Islam: Empire of Faith,"
which made its debut to critical acclaim in May on PBS and became a
must-see after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   4. Made-for-TV movies. Take your pick of excellence: HBO's "Wit,"
with Emma Thompson as a terminal cancer patient; ABC's "Life With
Judy Garland--Me and My Shadows," which provided Emmys for Tammy
Blanchard as the young Judy and Judy Davis as the older Judy; or
ABC's "Anne Frank," with Ben Kingsley and Hannah Taylor Gordon. Or
how about HBO's "Conspiracy," with Kenneth Branagh?</TE>
<TE>   They were all fabulous, but I'll take "Anne Frank" because it
broke new ground in taking us beyond the normal ending of the
story--with the Germans discovering the family--and dared to show
what happened to this child in the horror of the Nazi concentration
camps.</TE>
<TE>   5. Miniseries. HBO's "Band of Brothers." No argument, case closed.
Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg created one of the greatest and most
illuminating war narratives in American history. The Battle of the
Bulge episode was as intense as anything ever produced by an American
novelist writing about war.</TE>
<TE>   6. Sitcoms. You've probably noticed a trend to these picks so far:
Every category has at least one finalist from HBO. Sorry to those of
you who don't have HBO, but my pick for the best sitcom, Larry
David's "Curb Your Enthusiasm," also comes from the premium cable
channel. "Seinfeld's" gone, but David, its co-creator, brings the
same wry-dark-acidic comic sensibility to this series, in which he
stars as himself. The episode in which David visits Jason Alexander
and the former "Seinfeld" sidekick whines about not being able to
escape his George Costanza persona was superb.</TE>
<TE>   7. Reality. Maybe the real reason I'm feeling so good about
television these days is the trend I have been waiting to report for
almost two years: Reality TV is tanking. Think back to June and the
debut of NBC's "Fear Factor," with contestants wearing only tank tops
and shorts lying strapped in a pit as hundreds of rats crawled over
their bodies. I don't think the genre will ever disappear, but one
can hope.</TE>
<TE>   8. Old favorites. NBC's "Friends" is the clear winner here. It
offered us a chance every week to revisit New York, N.Y., the magical
city of American promise and reinvention, as it existed before the
battering it took on Sept. 11. New York will reinvent itself again
out of the ashes, but I'm glad we had "Friends" this fall for the
escape.</TE>
<TE>   9. Late night. "Late Show With David Letterman." Again, no
contest. Letterman set the tone for the entire entertainment wing of
the television industry with his opening remarks on the night he
returned to the air after the Sept. 11 attacks--he was somber, angry
and saddened, but also resolute in his determination to carry on as
an entertainer. It was one of TV's great moments.</TE>
<TE>   10. News. Television's finest moments in 2001, though, came on
Sept. 11, with the steady, responsible and reassuring work of the
three major network news anchors--ABC's Peter Jennings, CBS' Dan
Rather and NBC's Tom Brokaw. This was more about culture than
journalism. What we saw were three longtime television news anchors
ascending to that profound civic and emotional space in American life
that no television journalist had occupied since Walter Cronkite in
1963.</TE>

<LD>Buddy, Bill Clinton's chocolate Labrador retriever, died Wednesday
when he was hit by a car near the former president's Chappaqua home
in upstate New York.</LD>
<LD>   The 4-year-old dog "ran from the Clinton residence, playfully
chasing a contractor who had just left," said Lt. Charles Ferry of
the New Castle Police Department. A car struck the dog as he ran
across the road at the end of Clinton's cul-de-sac. Buddy was taken
to Chappaqua Animal Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.</LD>
<LD>   Neither Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton nor the former president was
at home at the time, but they issued a statement through spokeswoman
Julia Payne, saying that the dog "was a loyal companion and brought
us much joy. He will truly be missed."</LD>
<TE>   The playful antics of the first dog were well-known, as was his
uneasy relationship with Socks, the first cat. The retriever even
became fodder for a book: In 1998, Hillary Clinton collected letters
from children for "Dear Socks, Dear Buddy."</TE>
<TE>   The Clintons received Buddy as a present four years ago and named
him after the president's great-uncle. When the president left
office, Buddy moved with the Clintons, and Socks found a home in
Virginia with Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie. On the subject of
his relationship with Buddy, Clinton once quoted President Harry S
Truman: "If you want a friend in Washington, you need to get a dog."</TE>
<TE>   Yesterday's News</TE>
<TE>   It's a dark day in Hollywood when a good gossip columnist loses
his job. New York Daily News columnist Mitchell Fink, an institution
in celebrity news circles, was let go Wednesday after 31/2 years
there. He told us the post-Sept. 11 shift away from gossip may be the
cause. "People get really afraid when they are threatened
economically, and there is no doubt the Daily News and other
newspapers have been hurting tremendously since Sept. 11," Fink said.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday morning, he fielded calls from friends, reporters and
book agents. "I respect the News' decision," Fink told us. "I have no
regrets. I broke a ton of stories there." (He takes credit for
breaking the J.Lo-Puff Daddy split, for instance.)</TE>
<TE>   But Fink is surprised that the decision was made just two weeks
after United Media agreed to syndicate his column. "They were
supposed to announce it today," he said Thursday. "I was to be the
guest of honor at a dinner with their sales staff. Their plan was to
slowly start rolling this out and then come with a big splash in
March." Now that plan is on hold indefinitely, perhaps until Fink
negotiates another newspaper contract.</TE>
<TE>   Daily News spokesman Ken Frydman said that "the decision was made
for budgetary reasons." To fill the page vacated by Fink, the
newspaper has expanded the length of another gossip column, by
husband-and-wife team George Rush and Joanna Molloy.</TE>
<TE>   Fink, who got his taste for gossip during the 11 1/2 years he
spent at the Los Angeles Herald Examiner, said that he's unsure where
he'll land but that "I believe that the interest in celebrities and
their lives is always going to continue."</TE>
<TE>   "There's probably never been more of a need for this type of
diversion than now."</TE>
<TE>   A Surprise Wedding</TE>
<TE>   On New Year's Day, 56-year-old Eric Clapton married his
25-year-old American girlfriend, Melia McEnery, according to a
British tabloid, in a surprise ceremony at St. Mary Magdalen Church
in Ripley, the village southwest of London where Clapton was raised
by his grandparents.</TE>
<TE>   The wedding immediately followed the christening of the couple's
6-month-old daughter, Julie Rose, and Clapton's 16-year-old daughter,
Ruth Patricia.</TE>
<TE>   Clapton's bandmate, guitarist Andy Fairweather Low, 51, is
godfather to Julie Rose. Low's wife, Barbara, said the wedding was
not announced until after the baptism. "We went there thinking it was
just a christening for the girls. But at the end of the ceremony, the
vicar said, 'We have two people here who want to get married as
well,'" she said, the Sun reported. "Then Eric stepped forward, and
everyone cheered."</TE>
<TE>   Clapton reportedly met McEnery, a graphic artist, in Los Angeles
two years ago while working on an album with B.B. King.</TE>
<TE>   Clapton was married to George Harrison's ex-wife, Patti Boyd, for
nine years. Clapton's son, Conor, is buried at the church where the
wedding took place. The boy died in 1991, at the age of 4, after
falling from the 53rd floor of a New York apartment where he was
staying with his mother, Italian actress Lori del Santo. Conor's
death was commemorated by Clapton in the hit song "Tears in Heaven."</TE>

<LD>THE PHOENIX</LD>
<LD>   A Novel About the Hindenburg</LD>
<LD>   By Henning Boetius</LD>
<TE>   Translated from the German by John Cullen</TE>
<TE>   Nan A. Talese/Doubleday</TE>
<TE>   340 pages, $24.95</TE>
<TE>   "The Phoenix" is a memorable novel of several dimensions. It is
the carefully researched and gripping story of the fiery crash of the
German airship Hindenburg at Lakehurst, N.J., in May 1937, after a
transatlantic flight. It is, incidentally, a college course in the
building and flying of zeppelins, rather as "Moby-Dick" is a course
in the art of whaling, though this runs shorter.</TE>
<TE>   "The Phoenix" is also a delicately erotic love story. It is a
meditation on appearance and reality. And it is a subtle and
convincing picture of the Germany from which Hitler sprang and the
country he left in ashes. After the crash, a German-American
commission decided it was the result of several natural factors that
led to the explosion of the ship's hydrogen, which kept the zeppelin
aloft. Hitler's regime was anxious to declare the accident was not,
as widely rumored, the result of anti-Nazi sabotage.</TE>
<TE>   In the novel, one of the surviving passengers, who had never
believed the official story, tries, 10 years later, to find out what
actually happened. His quest takes him to one of the small,
xenophobic Friesian islands off the German coast in the North Sea,
where the man who was at the Hindenburg's elevator control during the
crash lives.</TE>
<TE>   This is where the fictional plot arises from reality. Boetius'
father, Eduard, to whom the novel is dedicated, was at the elevator
wheel when the ship crashed and is now the only living survivor. The
younger Boetius, the author of 20 novels in German, was raised on a
North Sea island and grew up hearing his father's stories about the
airship; he says that he "drank my tea from the Hindenburg teacups
all my life."</TE>
<TE>   In the novel the elevator man is named Edmund Boysen. He is raised
rather coldly by his father but is enchanted by his slightly mad
uncle, who is a successful inventor. As a teenager Boysen ships out
to sea and rises in the German merchant marine. He is methodical,
dedicated and talented. In 1936, as Hitler is beginning to build his
war machine, Boysen, on the basis of his sea record, joins the German
Zeppelin Transport Co. and trains for the difficult job of elevator
man. It is he who points the airship up or down and keeps it level.
The job requires the sensitive feel and instant reaction of a
helmsman at sea.</TE>
<TE>   The ultimate chief of the zeppelin program is the Reich Minister
for Aviation and commander in chief of the Luftwaffe, Hermann
Goering. With finesse, Boetius describes how a serious technical
German like Boysen could matter-of-factly work for his Nazi masters.
He writes that the "euphoric expressions" on the faces of the crew
members working on the airships revealed how they "merged a sense of
duty and responsibility with elements of play, childishness, dream
and individual dignity to produce a kind of collective rapture."</TE>
<TE>   Though we know how it will turn out, Boetius' account of the
flight from Frankfurt to New York and landing at Lakehurst is
suspenseful and exciting.</TE>
<TE>   As the author of several suspense novels, Boetius knows how to
keep an intricately constructed plot moving forward smoothly.</TE>
<TE>   And with the luxurious Bauhaus-influenced decor of the airship's
interior, the formal correctness of the crew and the casual elegant
manners of the international passengers, he skillfully transports the
reader back to prewar Germany.</TE>
<TE>   As artfully drawn, too, is the Germany of 1947, the center of
Frankfurt heaps of bricks, Berliners moving in their rubble like ants
scattered from their shattered hill, the remote islanders in the
North Sea unrepentantly long for their dead Fuehrer. The central
character in the novel, Swedish journalist Birger Lund, the passenger
who is trying to discover what really happened, is the crux of
Boetius' musings on appearance and reality.</TE>
<TE>   To say how Lund plays that role would unfairly give away the plot.</TE>
<TE>   The phoenix of the title, who rises newborn from the ashes of
destruction, is in one specific sense Lund himself.</TE>
<TE>   But the reader infers that there are more meanings behind the
title.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it applies to the truth, as in the truth of what actually
happened to the airship, or, just perhaps, to the birth of a new
Germany, a nation that finally recognizes, as Boysen does, what had
happened to itself during the Third Reich and which can act once
again with honor and decency.</TE>

<HD>An L.A. Author Feels  San Francisco's Chill</HD>
<DH>A writer on a book tour finds the city's 'serious' literary
community to be less than genuine.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GINA B. NAHAI</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm not one of those writers who routinely predict the demise of the
written word, feel ignored by their publishers or lament the
possibility that their books may be read by the huddled masses. The
written word, I believe, is alive and well. I feel quite loved and
appreciated by my publisher. And I would like nothing more than for
the masses to read my books.</LD>
<LD>   Which is why I'm standing here, at 4 a.m. on a freezing Atlanta
morning, in a line that stretches through the airport and out to the
sidewalk, hoping to make an 8 o'clock flight to San Francisco. I'm on
tour for my new novel. I've pursued the huddled masses in Los Angeles
and San Diego, courted them in the Midwest, followed them to the East
Coast, and all the way down to the South. But for all the mishaps
along the way, nothing prepared me for the likes of San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   To garner interest in the book, my publisher has spared no
expense. I've been on news shows and book shows and even in People
magazine. Yet I'm beginning to sense a kind of existentialist
despair--as if I've been locked inside one of Jean-Paul Sartre's
plays or trapped in an episode of "Seinfeld."</LD>
<TE>   It could be the reading in one East Coast city where the
organizers had changed the date and neglected to tell me, or the one
in the South where I was pitted against Dr. Ruth Westheimer, the sex
counselor, and lost hands down in terms of numbers attending, or the
book festival in Southern California where 10 minutes into my talk
someone came in to announce to the audience: "Kenny Turan's event has
just started downstairs; hurry if you don't want to miss lunch."</TE>
<TE>   It could be the number of times I have turned up for an interview
only to be preempted by "real" news, the security alerts I have set
off--a woman with a Middle Eastern name ($150 highlights from a
Beverly Hills salon notwithstanding), traveling alone on a one-way
ticket.</TE>
<TE>   It could be aftershock from Sept. 11, Afghanistan, the explosives
in people's shoes. It could be, but it isn't: The writer's life has
its own absurdities, independent of  the world at large.</TE>
<TE>   So I take my theater of the absurd aboard a plane from Atlanta to
San Francisco, check into a hotel and call a writer friend in Palo
Alto to say I'm in town doing readings. I imagine she will be
pleased, that she will offer to come out and meet me, that she will
say a few words, sincere or not, about how much she's loved my new
book.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, I find her gasping at the other end of the line.</TE>
<TE>   "Really?" she asks. "You're touring?"</TE>
<TE>   She says this as if it's a crime against humanity.</TE>
<TE>   "We're at war. People are dying. And you're touring?"</TE>
<TE>   I feel like I've been caught naked in front of the whole class. On
the first day of school. In third grade.</TE>
<TE>   It's true I feel a bit ashamed of my self-centered quest to
further my career when so much "real news" is going on. But I have
spent four years writing this novel, and I'd like to see it sell more
than five copies--all of them to my mother. Besides, I can't imagine
that the hunt for Osama bin Laden will be  undermined by my little
book tour.</TE>
<TE>   My friend is undaunted by my argument.</TE>
<TE>   "You know," she says, "all the big names have canceled their
tours."</TE>
<TE>   I know. The big names have.</TE>
<TE>   "Their publishers won't risk their authors' lives."</TE>
<TE>   My publisher, on the other hand, has been more than willing to
take a chance on mine.</TE>
<TE>   "At any rate," my friend concludes, "San Francisco won't be what
you expect."</TE>
<TE>   I expect only to sell a few books, to a few friendly readers.</TE>
<TE>   "But that's just it," she explains, a bit too joyfully.</TE>
<TE>   What?</TE>
<TE>   "Our readers."</TE>
<TE>   What about your readers?</TE>
<TE>   "They're not like L.A. readers."</TE>
<TE>   What does that mean--L.A. readers?</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. readers," she emphasizes, like it's an incurable disease
recently imported from Africa.</TE>
<TE>   What about L.A. readers?</TE>
<TE>   "They're simple," she declares. "Shallow and unliterary and easy
to please."</TE>
<TE>   I take a moment to digest the meaning of this apparently
well-known fact that has until now escaped me.</TE>
<TE>   Does this mean that serious readers, S.F.-style, will not rush to
buy my books?</TE>
<TE>   "Probably not," she stabs. "Unless you're a big name."</TE>
<TE>   We already went over that.</TE>
<TE>   "Or you've gone commercial."</TE>
<TE>   Oops. Do San Francisco readers, profound as they are, actually
turn out for commercial writers?</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes," my friend says, sighing. "But when they do, there
goes your reputation."</TE>
<TE>   I hang up the phone and call room service for a pot of coffee to
help me navigate this new maze I've been thrown into. I've got three
novels to my name, had my books translated into 20 languages. I've
won awards. And now all that may unravel, indeed my entire literary
reputation may be tainted, if my books sell in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Should I stop hoping, then, that my cousins from Tiburon will show
up at my reading, bring along their spouses and children and
next-door neighbors, and make everyone buy books?</TE>
<TE>   Should I stop hoping for a call from Oprah? Why, I've even left my
cell-phone number on the answering machine at home in case she calls
when I'm gone.</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, the first store I read at is packed.</TE>
<TE>   This is one of those independents that claim never to book an
author unless everyone on the staff has read and loved the book. The
trouble is, everyone on this staff seems to have read someone else's
book: a 10-foot banner hangs over the front of the store as I walk
in. The giant letters, printed in black, are visible from across the
bay: "Welcome, Isabel Allende!"</TE>
<TE>   That may explain the impressive size of the crowd in a city where
I'm supposed to make no sales. It may also explain the baffled looks
on some faces in the audience when I'm introduced. Iran instead of
South America. Religious fundamentalism instead of romance. And I
don't even have a translator. Can't even get a welcome banner with my
own name on it.</TE>
<TE>   In a less literary town--like L.A., maybe--the store's event
coordinator may have gone to the trouble of rolling up the banner
greeting one writer (Allende) long enough for another (me) to do a
reading.</TE>
<TE>   In a less literary town, I may have pointed out to the audience
that, yes, their hunch is correct: I am not Allende. I'm more
literary, less commercial, more likely to have an entire "Seinfeld"
episode named after me and my book tour.</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco, I talk about my novel and read a page or two and
wonder which one of our careers (mine or Allende's ) is going to be
hurt by the size of this audience. Afterward, I sign enough books to
land the novel on the San Francisco Chronicle's bestseller list. But
I do this with a heavy heart, wondering if I'll manage to bury my
career with every sale I make.</TE>
<TE>   On the way out of the store, I run into a  bubbly event
coordinator perched atop very pointed high heels. She shoves a
clipping from the Chronicle into my hands.</TE>
<TE>   "Loved the book," she says, winking, and we both know she couldn't
pick it out of a lineup.</TE>
<TE>   The person who has written the Chronicle review, it seems, also
can't pick it out of a lineup. He starts by saying that every man,
woman and child in America should buy my book, then spends the rest
of the piece taking me to task for things that do not happen and do
not exist in the book. Confused, I read the review aloud to my escort
on the way back to the hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "Why don't you write a letter?" he suggests absently, then turns
up the volume on the radio.</TE>
<TE>   So I borrow a laptop from the people at the front desk, sit down
with my third cup of coffee in three hours and e-mail a letter to the
editor. I point out the mistakes in the review, the supposedly
annoying characters that are not even in the book, the historically
accurate facts that the reviewer has mocked me for inventing.</TE>
<TE>   Right away, I get a formal letter of apology from the Chronicle:
The reviewer, I am told, had personal problems while working on my
book and, therefore, wrote the review in "a state of shock."</TE>
<TE>   I write back saying I understand (I don't, but I'm trying to be
gracious). Perhaps, then, the paper might print my letter and set the
record straight for their very literary readers?</TE>
<TE>   The paper might, along with this admission from the reviewer: "In
the short time I had available to me to read and review Ms. Nahai's
book," he confesses, "I did not do research."</TE>
<TE>   Really?</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe I should have."</TE>
<TE>   Yup.</TE>
<TE>   In a less literary town--like L.A., maybe--the book editor may
have found this, a reviewer who admits he  panned a book without
being certain of his facts, a tad embarrassing.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, in this literary town, I should regard this--a review
that will slow down sales, therefore assuring me a literary, rather
than a commercial, reputation--as a blessing.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, I pick up my cell phone, dial my home machine and pray
for a message from Oprah.</TE>
<TE>   Gina B. Nahai's "Seinfeld" moments occurred while promoting her
novel "Sunday's Silence."</TE>

<HD>For Many Women, Low Is Still the Way to Go</HD>
<DH>Comfortable and youthful looking, low-rise jeans seemed
like a trend but are here to stay.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES SENIOR FASHION WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Julie Arden wears her shirts a little short and her pants low to
reveal a Celtic dragon tattoo that stretches across her belly. Her
creative colleagues recently invented a new version of the
beer-drinking game called "quarters." Instead of flipping coins into
a beer mug, a pal flipped a coin down her backside into her gaping
hip-huggers as she perched atop a bar stool.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't know it was there until I stood up and it hit my foot,"
said the 27-year-old technology consultant from San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, the perils of fashion are many. Yet flashing fannies in
low-rise jeans have opened up far too many interesting twists on
fashion, society and bar stool seduction to disappear now. The low
cuts are the equivalent of the bikini that replaced the one-piece
suit, and they're the latest key to fashion credibility. Hip-huggers
say that you understand the way of the world, and that you weigh
approximately what you did in high school. After all, Madonna isn't
the only one in on the secret to maintaining a teenage appeal: The
fastest way to look young is to cop the jeans of the young.</LD>
<TE>   Ask designer Daniella Clarke, who sprang her Frankie B. ultra-low
denims on the world three years ago when she sauntered into Fred
Segal wearing her jeans with a scandalously itty-bitty 5-inch rise
(that's the length from the top of the waistband to the joint seam.
Standard-rise jeans usually run 12 inches).</TE>
<TE>   Now Clarke is selling 20,000 pairs of low-cut jeans a month and
has introduced a line for men. Let it also be known that her
52-year-old mother, Brenda Morris, wears 6-inch rise hip-huggers and
"looks amazing," says the daughter. "She exudes confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Attitude is exactly what it takes to pull off the look. While
celebrities and the professionally taut prefer Clarke's extremely
tight, low and sexy jeans, women of all sizes have quickly adopted
the lower cut. A lower-riding hipster jean is one of Lane Bryant's
best-selling jeans. "We have them in stretch denim, which is the
secret ingredient," said Catherine Lippincott, spokeswoman for the
plus-sized women's clothing company.</TE>
<TE>   The other secret? A belt. It can prevent slippage by cinching
jeans tight to your body. Of course, in the 1970s, we wore a belt and
a bodysuit with our hip-huggers to prevent any accidental flesh
exposure. We may have been hip-hugger pioneers, but we were careful
not to get grounded.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to hip-huggers, the generation gap now refers to that area
of the body extending from the bellybutton to the top of your
micro-thong undies. If a woman can bare the flesh there, she probably
hasn't suffered from the various torments of childbearing, gym
absenteeism or poor self-esteem. Or maybe she simply realizes that
waistbands are evil.</TE>
<TE>   Hip-huggers soared to mainstream popularity--they've even become
office attire--for one simple reason: They're comfortable. Us nearly
middle-aged broads finally exhaled a sigh of relief when, at last, we
could sit down and not be sliced in half by a two-layer band of
riveted and double-topstitched torture called a denim waistband. It
seems that no matter who you approach at the Beverly Center, asking
to know why they're wearing low-cut jeans, they all say a better fit
than ordinary "natural waist" jeans. They, too, have discovered that
jeans are the denim equivalent of a swimming suit, and just as hard
to fit, given the diversity of the female form.</TE>
<TE>   Chantee Benefield, a 31-year-old artist from Altadena, says that
she's built "kinda straight." So her low-rise jeans don't have an
unsightly, gaping back waistband. "Skinny girls," she says, "have
their problems, too." So do curvy girls, like Arden, who says that
the lower cut fits her better, too.</TE>
<TE>   And for the legions of compact, shorter-waisted women, the
proportions of hip-huggers help them fit more like "waist-huggers."
When your torso is so short that your waistband overlaps your bra
strap, suddenly even the lowest-rise jeans don't seem so bad. Showing
your bellybutton seems a small price to pay for feeling good.</TE>
<TE>   Evidently, America agrees. A year ago, Levi's introduced its first
Super Low jeans with a 31/2-inch zipper and an 81/2-inch rise.
"Low-rise jeans went from zero to 40% of my business in a year,''
said Maggie Winkel, a merchandise manager for Levi Strauss &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   The rapid acceptance has caused Winkel to personally help
hip-hugger novices into their new jeans. She created, and I quote,
the "the Super Low pull, tug and wiggle." Here's how it goes: "Once
you've pulled your jeans on and buttoned the fly, you pinch the
fabric at the knee and give them a pull. Then you grab the fabric on
the side of the thigh, tug and give it a wiggle. That causes the
jeans to settle on the appropriate place on the body, which is your
hips."</TE>
<TE>   That's the mark of a fashion classic--it forces us to adopt a
whole new way of dressing, talking, walking or simply perceiving.
Low-rise jeans allow us to expose all kinds of wonderfully shocking
things, in addition to rear-end cleavage that used to be taboo.
Glendale's Anna Nersesyan, 26, just bought her pierced bellybutton a
new sparkly ring to dangle above the low cut of her jeans. Though
Britney Spears may be able to hang her jeans by a thread and a
prayer, mature women resort to that reliable bit of camouflage: the
big shirt and the fat-smoothing Lycra undershirt.</TE>
<TE>   If what goes up must come down, then in fashion the reverse must
also be true. Pants and jeans have been inching down our hips for
nearly a decade, ever since Alexander McQueen's nearly backless
"bumster" pants shocked fashion in 1992. Three years later, Tom
Ford's career-making velvet hip-huggers showed up on Madonna and in
fashion magazines that fall. Ford has since moved onward and upward.
His spring 2002 collection pulled the waist up, the pant legs wide
and dropped the crotch low. That was enough to cause such trend
authorities as the January Harper's Bazaar to place hip-hugging,
super-tight rock-star pants on its list of items to toss.</TE>
<TE>   Though higher-waist pants are the new direction for spring,
low-rise jeans aren't about to loosen their grip on the hipbones of
America's flat-stomached teenagers and their slightly pot-bellied
elders. We're having too much fun staring at the backsides of
strangers and marveling at their choice of purple thong underwear.</TE>
<TE>   Low-rise jeans have hit bottom. They can go no lower, for they
have already fallen as far as gravity, modesty and modern engineering
will allow. With their 3-inch zippers, they've dipped to the depths.
Not even Clarke is attempting to craft a lower-rise jean. For now,
she's thinking about a new kind of extreme--bell-bottoms. Rejoice.
They're a sanctuary for big feet.</TE>

<LD>Imagine a Space Age clothing store where dressing rooms have digital
cameras that project your picture onto plasma screens. Suppose the
lights could adjust to show you what you look like in your new outfit
in the daytime and then at night. Picture these dressing room walls
made of liquid crystal that changes from dark to transparent
depending on whether the room is occupied. Consider stepping out of
the room and walking across window displays built into the floor
below your feet. Who might shop here? How can architecture change the
whole experience of shopping?</LD>
<LD>   Architect Rem Koolhaas designed this store for the leather goods
and clothing designer Prada. It won't open in its Beverly Hills
location until late 2002, but you can get a sneak preview at MOCA at
the Geffen Contemporary.</LD>
<LD>   Newly invented design materials with names such as thermoplastic
foam and techno-gel are featured as part of "What's Shakin': New
Architecture in L.A.," an exhibition that focuses on eight
architectural projects currently under construction in Los Angeles.
Walking through it, you'll discover how architects make new spaces
and what materials they use.</LD>
<TE>   Models, videos, digital images, drawings and displays fill the
galleries. You can create unique architectural models and floor plans
in the museum's Building Blocks studio from noon to 3 p.m. daily,
through Monday. The exhibition closes on Jan. 20. To learn more, call
(213) 626-6222 or visit www.moca.org.</TE>

<HD>A Comeback of Vintage Collage</HD>
<DH>For spring, designers draw on Koos van den Akker's colorful
patchwork styles of the '70s and '80s.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES SENIOR FASHION WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you didn't read the labels, the clothes hanging on a rolling metal
rack at Decades, a Melrose Avenue vintage boutique, might seem like
samples plucked from the upcoming spring fashion collections. But the
1970s and '80s patchwork peasant blouses, the metallic collage
blouses and the intricately appliqued silk pajamas are the work of
fabric craftsman Koos van den Akker .</LD>
<LD>   The Dutch-born New York designer, who rose to fame in the late
'70s before falling into relative obscurity, is having a fashion
renaissance that's one part serendipity and two parts hard work.
"What's nice about it," said the designer from his New York workroom,
"is that those things usually happen after you're dead."</LD>
<LD>   Virtually everything about the renewed interest in Van den Akker
is out of the ordinary. The 62-year-old designer's signature collage
style has been openly acknowledged as the source of inspiration in
major fashion collections, though borrowers rarely credit their
sources. Even if the origins are recognized, the designer almost
never profits from the new exposure, but Van den Akker is poised to
see his reputation and his pocketbook rewarded. Remarkably, though
high fashion is famously allergic to associations with the mass
market, for three years, Van den Akker's diffusion line called Koos
Of Course!  has made him one of the top-selling designers on the home
shopping channel QVC.</LD>
<TE>   "It's all about old clothes," the designer says deferentially,
"but now it's just called vintage." Perhaps the revival of Van den
Akker--who has quietly operated a small couture salon in Manhattan
for nearly 30 years--is most unusual because it came not from a
museum retrospective or a celebrity wearing his clothes, but largely
from the efforts of Los Angeles vintage dealer Cameron Silver.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all for him that it happened," said Van den Akker in his
slightly fractured English. "Thanks for Cameron Silver."</TE>
<TE>   Silver, 30, will host a private party next Friday launching a
retrospective of the designer's 39-year career at Decades Gallery,
the new show space at his 41/2-year-old boutique. While patrons sip
Heineken beers and nibble Dutch chocolates, they will meet the
gregarious Van den Akker and see firsthand the source of the
distinctive patchwork patterns and peasant styles that appeared in
the spring 2002 collections of Jill Stuart, Marc Jacobs, Louis
Vuitton and Paris designer Nicolas Ghesquiere, whose Balenciaga Le
Dix collections have been top trendsetters for the past few years.
His spring Balenciaga collection of intricately pieced prints,
metallics and metal mesh was an instant hit. Leading designers
recognized the significance of collage to fashion today. "Van den
Akker was the 1970s and '80s interpretation of that moment we loved
about the '60s," said Robert Duffy, chairman of Marc Jacobs, who also
designs Louis Vuitton. "His was the grown-up, designer version. There
were a lot of artsy, craftsy collections back then, but Koos, I
think, did it the best."</TE>
<TE>   As a dealer in designer vintage pieces, Silver was among the few
privy to the often-secretive fashion research that led to Van den
Akker. When Ghesquiere arrived at Silver's shop late last summer and
asked to see vintage Van den Akker, Silver adroitly realized the
significance of his request. He tracked down Van den Akker's
publicist and convinced the designer to stage a retrospective at his
Los Angeles gallery. Silver began promoting the show with press
releases and a phone call to a well-placed friend who helped land a
mention in Harper's Bazaar. Later, Vogue published a story about the
designer's influence.</TE>
<TE>   Silver himself hadn't always appreciated the artsy-crafty feel of
the clothes. About three years ago, the vintage dealer bought several
pieces from a New York client. "I didn't know if they were good or
not, so I put them in my 'nobody-gets-it' bag," he said. "It took me
a couple of years to see the relevancy of his clothes." That bag
wound up in the garage of his assistant, Jarred Cairns, who was sent
to immediately fetch it as Ghesquiere inspected other Van den Akker
pieces at the store. The bag contained items that are very likely to
become a key look of this spring and beyond: peasant blouses with
intricate collage.</TE>
<TE>   "And a revolution was born," Silver quipped. "Now I wish I had 30
of them."</TE>
<TE>   Silver will have dozens of new works that he commissioned from Van
den Akker, who personally handcrafts his collage designs. The
designer is making a small collection of $600 men's shirts, similar
to the sample that Silver frequently wears these days--a fanciful
blend of contrasting top-stitching running across twisted strips of
red fabric, Asian-inspired prints and colorful patterns.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people ask, 'is that [Roberto] Cavalli?'" Silver said.
The Italian designer's wildly colored and handcrafted clothes
heralded fashion's ongoing return to color, pattern and gypsy shapes
these past few seasons. Now that many other designers have adopted
color and patchwork, stores have come calling to one of the craft's
premier practitioners. The best of Van den Akker's work combines a
rustic and naive silhouette with sophisticated sewing techniques and
color palettes, a combination that defines current fashion.</TE>
<TE>   "Out of this, I got an account for Bendel's," the designer said of
the famed Henri Bendel fashion emporium in New York. Later this
month, the heavy-set Dutchman will wear his signature round glasses
and striped bib apron and enact what may be the store's first fashion
performance art. "I'm going to sit in the window for three days
sewing." At last, the fashion elite will get to see what Middle
America, and Van den Akker's select couture clients, such as Harry
and Julie Belafonte, Lou Reed and Barbara Walters, will have
witnessed for years: A designer who actually sews his own collection.</TE>
<TE>   For his debut on QVC in 1998, Van den Akker sat at his sewing
machine while glibly chatting about life and fashion. "They gave me
an hour, and in less than half an hour, we were sold out," the
designer recalled. "You can imagine, all my life, all my time in New
York, I sit behind a sewing machine with a handful of people around
me, and all of a sudden, we are on the air and the set up was the
same thing, but with 68 million people watching."</TE>
<TE>   His monthly appearances are enormously satisfying to the designer,
in part because they help secure his financial future. "Camera stuff
is easy. I'm good at it," he said. "That's the easy stuff because you
don't have to deal with them [the customers]. They just call in. It's
like being in vaudeville. You make people happy for $60."</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to appreciate why viewers find the designer, so
entertaining--he tells wonderful stories that make fun of fashion and
his quirky personality. "I went into the [Dutch] army with a portable
sewing machine when I was 18 years old," begins one tale. "I had with
me a bridesmaid collection that I was working on. I have photos of me
and the guys sitting around the sewing machine. That never happened
before. They always sit around firearms." The story ends with the
fledgling designer being shuttled off to a remote basement, making
clothes for the wife and daughters of a top-ranking officer.</TE>
<TE>   Never taking himself too seriously has helped and hindered his
career. Van den Akker may be the only working designer who
simultaneously operates a couture salon selling one-of-a-kind $1,200
lace dresses, as well as a $30 to $70 mass-market collection that
interprets his originals for a fraction of their cost. "I make a
sample for $35 a yard in brocade, they come back at $1.75," he said
slightly exaggerating the low wholesale cost of QVC's offshore
replications. He's thrilled that his ideas reach a wider audience.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the crown of my work," he said. "It came at the right time.
I'm old and I need some money for getting older. I haven't been very
good in business. But I sew well."</TE>
<TE>   The history of Van den Akker's career is as patchworked as his
designs. The onetime apprentice to Christian Dior set up his first
store in The Hague in 1965 and operated it for about two years. "I
had a beautiful salon, like an apple--beautiful on the outside, but
rotten on the inside," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The subsequent death of his father jolted him into acting on a
long-held desire to leave his native Netherlands in 1968 for New
York. "A month after my father died, I just literally walked out," he
said. "My friends paid the bills and cleaned it all up. I took the
boat because I couldn't imagine that I could change my life in five
hours on a plane. The first thing I did was climb up the Empire State
Building and look around. I thought, 'I'm home.'" He sat his sewing
machine on a New York sidewalk, and piece by piece, built a business
until he could afford to open a store on Columbus Avenue in Manhattan
in 1971.</TE>
<TE>   Though Van den Akker says he understands New York well ("it's very
Dutch somehow") other cities proved to be less hospitable. He opened
a short-lived boutique on Camden Drive in Beverly Hills in 1978, at
the apex of his popularity.</TE>
<TE>   "We spent money like water," he said of his time in Los Angeles.
"I had a ball. But it didn't work at all. I was so unprepared." In
his heyday, his colorful sweaters appeared regularly on Bill Cosby
when he starred in his TV show, and ended up as the favorite items of
a cross-section of society. When Van den Akker called past clients
seeking items for the upcoming retrospective and sale, many would
only lend them, such as New York socialite Blaine Trump, who wouldn't
part with her 1980s collage tweed skirt. Now his vintage pieces sell
at Decades and flea markets for $200 for blouses to $1,200 for an
intricately pieced cashmere coat.</TE>
<TE>   Looking over the Decades collection, Van den Akker's craft is
apparent. For example, the designer cut a simple blouse from floral
chiffon, but then slashed the same fabric into ribbons that he
knitted into a sweater vest. An unusual range of fabrics cover his
pieces, though they combine in surprising harmony. Van den Akker
often scours New York flea markets for antique textiles that he'll
freely apply to his originals. "It really is non-ostentatious haute
couture," Silver said. "He does make something for everybody, which
is really refreshing in American fashion."</TE>
<TE>   Whether they are new or old, pricey or affordable, many of Van den
Akker's pieces are roomy. "They are big shapes and it's easy," said
Van den Akker. "That is why I have such a big success with QVC. They
are not size 6 or 8. I don't give a damn. The bigger the better! The
more space to make a collage!"</TE>
<TE>   The designer's revival comes at a time when fashion is seeking
unique voices, particularly ones that evoke the reassuring comfort of
a colorful, handmade garment. "I haven't compromised. I still sit
here behind my sewing machine and I still make beautiful things," he
said. "I haven't changed. But the world around me has."</TE>
<TE>   The retrospective runs Jan. 12 through February at Decades, 8214
1/2 Melrose Ave., L.A.. 11:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday.

Talley's memoirs, tentatively titled "ALT," in spring 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Talley says his maternal grandmother, Bennie Frances Davis, a maid
in the Duke University men's dormitories, taught him to see the world
with a warm heart and a mind fully open to possibility.</TE>
<TE>   Vreeland was an editor at Harper's Bazaar and Vogue, and a creator
of exhibits at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Talley will share how two women from very different backgrounds
turned out to have similar ways of appreciating luxury.</TE>
<TE>   THE 2002 LOOK: The new year ushers in many new rules, especially
when it comes to keeping up with fashion.</TE>
<TE>   The editors at Glamour magazine offer these fashion-forward tips
to keep from looking "so last year."</TE>
<TE>   * Don't throw out your camel-colored sweater: Safari-inspired
looks are hot. Put away your camouflage, though, and leave combat
clothes to the armed forces.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't look drab in 2001's head-to-toe black ensembles. Brighten
up with a touch of bold colors, such as red, turquoise or yellow.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't hop off your motorcycle in a black leather biker jacket
with matching black leather jeans. Break it up by pairing the jacket
with a soft feminine skirt.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't stuff yourself like a sausage into a too-tight pencil
skirt. Try a soft, flowing ballerina skirt with a hem to the knee.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't squeeze toes into last year's pointy toes. Make your feet
happy and wear flat shoes with round toes or thong sandals.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't break out your graffiti looks--subway styles have been
wiped clean. Grow a floral look instead.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't try to be a teen pop star baring her belly in skintight
Lycra. Go with the (sophisticated) flow in pretty chiffon.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't be a metal head, either. Instead of mixing silver and gold
accessories, try blending coral and turquoise jewelry.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't relive the 1980s, but remember the '70s--and their hippie
trends.</TE>

<HD>J. Peterman Returns to Hatch New Adventures</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeannine Stein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dear Fashion Police: A few years ago, J. Peterman went out of
business. I miss its particular type of products. Could you please
inform me if anybody has taken over its catalog or product line?</LD>
<LD>   --STILL A FAN</LD>
<LD>   Dear Still: J. (for John) Peterman is alive and well and living in
Kentucky where he is again at the reins of his unique clothing
company.</LD>
<TE>   Those who have followed the roller-coaster history of this
clothier know that in the 1980s and '90s his catalog developed a
reputation for the descriptions of his classic upscale men's and
women's clothes, which read like passages from romance novels.</TE>
<TE>   When actor John O'Hurley portrayed Peterman as an affable nut case
on "Seinfeld," he attained cult status.</TE>
<TE>   The real Peterman subsequently expanded his empire a little too
far a little too fast across the country. That resulted in a
bankruptcy filing three years ago, leading him to sell the company to
Paul Harris Stores, which in turn had money problems and sold J.
Peterman to a liquidator.</TE>
<TE>   But before the line vanished, Peterman himself snatched it back
from the jaws of death.</TE>
<TE>   Today J. Peterman has a catalog again and is online at www.jpeter
man.com (or call [888] 647-2555), offering a limited selection of
clothes, accessories and other items.</TE>
<TE>   Don't worry, those rambling narratives are still there: "It's
Friday night at the Hog &amp; Fool, a 200-year-old pub off O'Connell
Street in Dublin. World headquarters for conversation. Dark mahogany
walls. Lean-faced men. Ruddy-faced women," reads the blurb for a $44
Irish Pub Shirt.</TE>
<TE>   The stores are gone, but Peterman told us in a quick phone chat
that his clothes will be carried in select stores soon (he doesn't
have specifics quite yet.)</TE>
<TE>   Also in the works are a line of licensed furniture and a
television show in which he travels the world looking for amazing
shopping experiences--just like real life! So stay tuned.</TE>
<TE>   If you want to know more, you can get it straight from Peterman
himself in his book, "Peterman Rides Again: Adventures Continue With
the Real 'J. Peterman' Through Life &amp; the Catalog Business" (Prentice
Hall Press, 2000).</TE>
<TE>   Attention, All Brides-to-Be: If any of you soon-to-be-brides have
been gown shopping of late, or have already chosen your gowns, we're
sure one piece of sartorial advice has been handed out over and over
again: You must wear the right foundations. In other words, a sports
bra might do for an old T-shirt, but it ain't going to cut it under a
silk charmeuse halter gown.</TE>
<TE>   But what exactly are the right foundations? If you have limited
resources or your salesperson or bridal consultant is lacking in
expertise, there's a catalog and online source that can help.</TE>
<TE>   Sol Bride grew out of a Denver lingerie store owned by sisters
Jeanie Peterson and Cindy Johnson that offers bras, bustiers,
panties, nightgowns, camisoles, bodysuits and other items for that
special day--and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Prices range from $19 for underwear to more than $300 for a silk
robe.</TE>
<TE>   But how can you fit someone if you can't see them, or what they're
wearing?</TE>
<TE>   Peterson has that all figured out. Order the catalog and you'll
get a tape measure, plus an illustrated "Perfect Fit" guide (the
guide is also on the Web site.) Brides can also call a customer
service representative who will research their gown online, or look
for it in bridal magazines to see exactly what it looks like.</TE>
<TE>   If you have a vintage or one-of-a-kind gown, Peterson assured us
that the representative's extensive training makes her skilled at
helping women choose the right lingerie. There's also a liberal
return policy.</TE>
<TE>   Call Sol Bride at (800) 684-4854, or find it online at
www.solbride.com.</TE>
<TE>   And if you're in Denver, you can drop by the store at 248 Detroit
St., or call (303) 394-1060.</TE>
<TE>   Write to Fashion Police, 202 W. 1st St., Los Angeles CA 90012, fax
to (213) 237-4888, or send e-mail to jeannine.stein@latimes.com.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With a gentle plink here and there, the tiny piano-like mechanism was
soon working again.</LD>
<LD>   "How did you do that?" asked Izzy, momentarily forgetting that the
MBD couldn't hear her.</LD>
<LD>   The doc, who could read her lips, scribbled a few words on a slip
of paper.</LD>
<TE>   "It's your lucky day!" the note read.</TE>
<TE>   Izzy jumped up and down excitedly.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank you!" she said.</TE>
<TE>   The doc used his hands to sign a message to the store clerk.</TE>
<TE>   Izzy wanted to know what he said. She liked this new secret code
and wanted to learn how to make words with her hands too.</TE>
<TE>   "He says, 'No charge,'" the clerk said.</TE>
<TE>   Izzy's mother was grateful too.</TE>
<TE>   "You're welcome," he signed.</TE>
<TE>   Izzy copied his hand gestures. He flashed a smile at her
willingness to learn.</TE>
<TE>   Later that evening, Grammy checked her e-mail. When she saw there
were no new messages from her granddaughter, she snuggled into her
reading chair. Then she heard the phone ring.</TE>
<TE>   "Hello ... oh, you're welcome," she said softly, slipping a
bookmark between the pages of her favorite collection of poems.</TE>
<TE>   "I know you'll take good care of it, honey. I love you too. See
you in the funny papers, Pumpkin Seed. And don't forget to give your
mom and pop a big hug and kiss for me."</TE>
<TE>   Izzy was glad to deliver Grammy's message to her parents. Then she
remembered the lucky four-leaf clover she had found that afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   She plucked the wilted clover from her pocket, then tucked it
inside the music box. Gently she wound the key. Its melody lulled
Lance to sleep. Izzy patted his sleepy head.</TE>
<TE>   "This was my luckiest day ever," she said, snuggling between her
mom and pop on the big, comfy sofa.</TE>

<HD>A Bitter Pill for Argentina</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When a nation churns through five presidents in two weeks, you know
the job is, well, challenging. Indeed, running Argentina has always
been tough, and it won't get easier as the country sinks deeper into
economic crisis and people swarm the streets, banging pots and
setting fires. That doesn't mean that President Eduardo Duhalde, who
took office Wednesday, is doomed to failure. To avert disaster,
however, will require far more discipline and resolve than either he
or Argentina have so far demonstrated. Outside help wouldn't hurt.</LD>
<LD>   Duhalde has experience as a senator, vice president and governor
of the province of Buenos Aires, but his record is tainted by large
budget deficits and accusations of corruption. More worrisome is his
pledge, during his unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 1999, to
cut taxes and reject the budget cuts demanded by the International
Monetary Fund.</LD>
<LD>   There is, however, hope. ''Argentina is broke, sunk," he declared
this week, a signal that he is beginning to face reality and willing
to make his nation confront it.</LD>
<TE>   Now, he must come up with a plan for sustainable economic growth
that will at once satisfy international financial institutions and
the United States (while attracting foreign investors) and calm the
average Argentine, who is understandably frantic watching the economy
leak like a harpooned blimp. To that end, Duhalde needs to set three
priorities.</TE>
<TE>   * He must present a realistic budget that forces Argentines to
live within their means.</TE>
<TE>   * He must keep the banking system from going under, even though
that means bank owners and depositors alike will end up losing money
and the federal government will have to pitch in with public funds.</TE>
<TE>   * Finally, he must find the least painful way to devalue the
currency, which is seriously inflated. Mexico did this in 1995, and
Brazil in 1999, and both survived the shock.</TE>
<TE>   Attaching the value of the peso to the dollar no longer makes
sense for Argentina. Linking the two currencies at a 1-to-1 rate
helped the nation lower inflation to acceptable levels a decade ago.
Then the dollar got stronger and Argentina lacked the flexibility to
adjust the peso's value, even as its products became uncompetitive in
international markets. Now Argentina needs to adopt a floating
exchange system. It also needs to wean creditors from demanding
dollars for almost every transaction, including paying the rent.
Politically, this "dedollarization" will be Duhalde's most difficult
task, since most long-term contractual agreements are in dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The new president seems to have the support of the political
establishment. Now he needs the political courage to tell a suffering
people that they must suffer even more, and to withstand their wrath
while disciplined austerity slowly brings Argentina back from the
brink of catastrophe. If he shows that determination he deserves the
support of international financial institutions and the U.S.</TE>

<HD>Fixing a Junked-Up Skyline</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While the rest of us dressed up for New Year's Eve parties Monday
night or settled down to watch the ball drop on television, workers
for STI/Outdoor LLC were unloading dozens of steel columns, digging
holes and pouring concrete along heavily traveled Los Angeles-area
freeways in preparation for erecting at least 25 huge billboards.
This stealthy, middle-of-the-night maneuver was of dubious legality
but entirely in character for the outdoor advertisers who have junked
up the local skyline with thousands of large billboards and want to
put up still more.</LD>
<LD>   City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo got a temporary restraining order
Thursday halting construction until a Jan. 25 court hearing on the
legality of these shenanigans. But a permanent solution to billboard
blight awaits the City Council, if it is willing to designate as top
priorities the tighter regulation of existing signs and strict limits
on new ones.</LD>
<LD>   A longer-term victory will also require continued, tough
enforcement by Delgadillo, who won his office with the help of
hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of free billboard advertising.
He says he's not beholden to the billboard industry that helped him
win. Here's his chance to prove it.</LD>
<TE>   STI/Outdoor claims its contract with the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority allows it to put up 41 billboards on MTA
property throughout Southern California, 25 of them within Los
Angeles city limits. MTA officials insist that the company needed to
obtain city permits to erect the billboards; STI/Outdoor says it
didn't. A state law that took effect Tuesday makes the permit
requirement crystal-clear. Not surprisingly, the company wanted to
get in under the wire--and under cover of darkness. With each board
generating up to $1 million a year, little wonder.</TE>
<TE>   The work crews did not have right-of-entry permits for Metrolink
property or proper insurance. They inadvertently cut an electric
train cable; they also failed to post flaggers along Metrolink
routes, endangering the lives of passengers as well as their own.
Thursday's restraining order puts at least a temporary end to this
audacious activity.</TE>
<TE>   STI/Outdoor's gambit should be a poke in the ribs to council
members returning from their holiday break. Now is the time to impose
permanent limits on new billboards--as Culver City, Santa Monica and
other nearby cities have done--and to go after the illegal signs.
Start with a new ordinance, a lot tougher than  the one the council
asked the Planning Department to draft last year. That weak-kneed
proposal, in exchange for the removal of less profitable signs, would
allow 70 giant,  double-sided billboards to be built around town,
much like those that STI/Outdoor tried to erect.</TE>
<TE>   As for Delgadillo, he's anxious to prove he's a good guy despite
his well-heeled supporters. That means he will have to take pains to
give his billboard company friends no breaks, no benefit of the doubt
in enforcing the law.</TE>

<LD>Bad enough that Calvin Burdine was sentenced to death after his
lawyer napped and nodded through his 1984 murder trial in Texas.
Worse that a federal appeals court panel in 2000 upheld the
conviction, insisting that while it did not "condone sleeping by a
capital counsel during a capital murder trial," it was "impossible to
determine ... that counsel's sleeping" actually hurt Burdine's case.</LD>
<LD>   Fortunately, the entire 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting in
New Orleans, blocked Burdine's execution last year, ordering that he
be retried. The court concluded that if the lawyer snoozed at the
defense table--eyes closed, head bobbing "for at least 10 minutes" on
one occasion, according to one courtroom witness--his client did not
get a fair trial. This grotesque appeal should have ended there. But
now Texas prosecutors are asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review the
appeals court ruling so they can send Burdine to the death chamber,
the manifest incompetence of his lawyer notwithstanding.</LD>
<LD>   The justices plan to vote today on whether to take up the case and
could announce their decision next week. Should they take the case, a
hearing will be held in the next few months. If they decline, Texas
will have to retry Burdine.</LD>
<TE>   The Texas attorney general's office argues that the 5th Circuit
ruling conflicts with decisions from two other federal appeals courts
on how much an attorney can nap during trial without violating his
client's constitutional right to counsel. Texas prosecutors also
insist that the 5th Circuit decision is inconsistent with earlier
decisions from the same court rejecting defendants' requests for new
trials because their attorneys were alcoholic, had Alzheimer's
disease or suffered from attention deficit disorder.</TE>
<TE>   The only just and humane decision would be for the high court to
summarily reject Texas' petition. If the constitutional guarantee
that criminal defendants are entitled to counsel means anything,
surely it means that their lawyers have to be sober and awake.</TE>

<LD>Your annual summary of new state laws is always enlightening (Jan.
1). SB 237 warns newcomers that it is a $1,000 fine to abandon pets.
SB 255 makes it a $100 fine to leave children under age 6
unsupervised in a vehicle if there are "significant risks to the
child's safety."</LD>

<TE>   Twenty-six years ago my adolescent son left our
nutrition-conscious household without breakfast to get to the sweet
rolls sold at his high school. I found that neither the PTA nor the
school board thought nutritious snacks were important. Now that some
legislators are addicted to junk foods and obesity is rampant even
among children, Sen. Martha Escutia (D-Whittier) gets some
nutritional standards for some schools put into law. Thank you,

<LD>I agree with "Exiting the Asbestos Trap" (editorial, Dec. 30) that
the results of asbestos litigation have been disastrous. However, I
see a serious flaw in the editorial's narrow focus on asbestos. Can't
we be intelligent enough to see that the same fate will come to the
next group of victims? Can't we see that, once again, lawyers have
run away with most of the available money and what little money finds
its way to these victims will be divided with great inequality and
delay?</LD>
<LD>   I also agree that the Sept. 11 fund is an excellent model for
compensation of victims. The success of this model is a result of the
courts being out of the process. The courts have proven themselves
incompetent. We should not only extend this model to asbestos victims
but to future victims of other situations as well.</LD>

<LD>Re "U.S. Denies Report That Raid Killed Villagers," Jan. 1: I have
supported vigorously the war in Afghanistan against Al Qaeda and the
Taliban since it began. At this point, though, continued air attacks
against suspected sites without absolutely certain intelligence are
wrong.</LD>
<LD>   We are killing civilians and not getting Osama bin Laden. The
attack on the convoy last week was also problematic in terms of who
was actually killed. America has generated tremendous goodwill as
liberators with the Afghan people. We should not squander that now
with excessive force and meaningless deaths. Let us get Bin Laden but
focus also on rebuilding Afghanistan so it will never again be a base
for terror. Air attacks do not fit that purpose.</LD>
<LD>   Nayyer Ali</LD>
<TE>   Huntington Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks, the Afghan government said
that it knew where Bin Laden was and would turn him over if evidence
were presented to prove his guilt. This is the same position that the
U.S. government would take before anyone here was extradited. Instead
of providing that evidence, however, our Great Pretender proceeded to
wage war on Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Now, nearly four months after the terrorist attacks occurred, more
innocent civilians have died from war in Afghanistan than died in the
World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks, and no one seems to know
where Bin Laden is. Most agree that Bin Laden has left Afghanistan,
however, raising the possibility that we will have another undeclared
war waged against another country (Pakistan, Indonesia, Sudan or
wherever). I am glad to see the Taliban gone, but there was never any
justification for war to achieve that end. In light of these
developments, why can most Americans not see the folly of President
Bush's failure to provide the evidence necessary for extradition
instead of pursuing the terror and futility of war?</TE>

<LD>Re "Leave the Hardware at Home," editorial, Dec. 29: Your editorial
disgracefully attempts to compare law-abiding American citizens of
Utah to the terrorist criminals responsible for the World Trade
Center disaster, the anthrax attacks and the alleged shoe bomber. One
of the quiet lessons of Sept. 11 is that American citizens cannot
depend on our government agencies to provide 100% of their personal
safety needs. Nor should citizens relinquish 100% of that
responsibility to government agencies. At least 41,800 citizens of
Utah recognize that fact.</LD>
<LD>   These responsible Americans--exercising their 2nd Amendment
rights--are certified, law-abiding (via government background
checks), well trained (after completing mandatory handgun safety
classes) and now state-licensed to carry concealed handguns. They
represent a significant crime deterrent, not a threat to security at
the Salt Lake City Olympics.</LD>

Russia of a century ago and led to bloody revolution. This is no
cause for optimism. Both during the glory days of the czars and the
salad days of the Revolution, foreign commentators marveled at the
potential for progress in Russia, only to see their predictions
evaporate like the fleeting Russian summer. Verily it is said that

<LD>If your family doctor missed a diagnosis as badly as Robert Scheer
did in claiming that "Enron Is a Cancer on the Presidency"
(Commentary, Jan. 2), you would file charges of incompetence with the
medical licensing board. Scheer's unprincipled attack on President
Bush is no more than an expression of his bias against deregulation
of anything, in this case of the energy trading market.</LD>
<LD>   Scheer fails to prove how deregulation led to improper accounting
and disclosure by Enron that, if proven, would violate other
long-standing legal requirements. Neither does he prove how any
acceptable scheme of regulation would have prevented the problems of
which Enron is accused. To go from an unsubstantiated attack on
deregulation to a personal attack on the president is ideologically
motivated and irresponsible.</LD>

<TE>   Give me six years, $60 million and two independent prosecutors

Republicans hounded Bill Clinton over $200,000 he supposedly made.
The Bush-Enron crimes must be in the millions, if not the billions.
Not to mention the thousands of families and stockholders they've
ripped off. But Democrats don't wield the absolute power in Congress
given to the Republicans in the '90s. What a shame.</TE>

<TE>   Scheer's commentary, although timely and proper, was at the same
time provocative and accusatory. Not what the country needs at this
moment. However, the president could take a cue from his foreign
policy and freeze the assets of Enron executives who profited from
company bonuses and the sale of Enron stock. This action would no
doubt find favor with Enron shareholders who lost their retirement
investments through mismanagement and possible fraud by company
executives. The government has an obligation to investigate Enron,
and Bush should take the lead.</TE>

<TE>   There is no question but that those culpable in the Enron mess
should be held accountable for their misdeeds. Tactics such as
freezing employee 401(k) retirement accounts while certain Enron
officers quickly opted out were unconscionable. We are told that many
employees lost hundreds of millions of dollars during their financial
lockout, and our sincere sympathies go out to them. However, if these
lower-level people at Enron had been allowed to sell when they
recognized the ship was sinking, would we be equally sympathetic to
the unsuspecting outside investors who could be equally stricken?</TE>

<LD>Re "Aid Stations Aim to Help Illegal Crossers Avoid Perishing in
Cold," Jan. 1: I had mixed feelings while reading your article. One
can understand the humanitarian motivations of those who leave food,
water, clothes and blankets on the American border to help "illegal
immigrants returning from holiday visits in Mexico" survive harsh
conditions of San Diego's mountains. Advertising it in a newspaper
with circulation over 1 million is a horse of another color, though.
It encourages the illegal border crossings and gives the perpetrators
a moral excuse to do so.</LD>
<LD>   How can we expect the illegal immigrants to respect our laws if we
show them that we are not serious about enforcement of these laws? By
publishing that article your newspaper did a great disservice to this
country.</LD>

<TE>   Setting out aid kits for illegal border crossers is a nice
gesture, but hardly the solution. I envision a string of full-service
illegal alien welcome centers, where DMV satellite offices issue
instant California driver's licenses and UC admissions kiosks make a
resident application available to each college-age visitor.</TE>

<LD>Re "A Father's Pain, a Judge's Duty, and a Justice Beyond Their
Reach," by Barry Siegel, Dec. 30: My hope is that all legislators,
when writing criminal law, will have Paul Wayment's face before them.</LD>
<LD>   Under the best of circumstances as presented in the story, the
search for justice can fail. Bad laws, such as federal mandatory
sentencing and three strikes, daily feed lives to a meat grinder.</LD>

<TE>   This heartbreaking story illustrates the dilemma that can occur
when powerful emotion must somehow be reduced to the requirements of
the law. Utah Judge Robert Hilder acted appropriately. He was able to
carefully balance his human emotion and his legal duties as a judge
in a manner most could not even come close to comprehending. I
greatly admire his strength and courage.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Wayment's suicide was a result of his incomprehensible inner
pain, not a result of Hilder's sentence.</TE>

<TE>   Siegel's piece was excellent in content and extremely well
written. It was clearly a major feat to have obtained such candor
from Judge Hilder.</TE>
<TE>   I am a practicing attorney in Los Angeles, primarily in the areas
of criminal and family law. In this profession, you soon come to
learn that there are few "legal" solutions to "personal" problems.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If the point of your story was to bring any sympathy to Judge
Hilder or the father of Gage Wayment, you have failed. The arrogance
of this judge to feel he may be responsible for the death of his
father and now for Gage's father's death makes me wonder if therapy
might help him.</TE>
<TE>   I also wonder why Siegel did not ask the two men who came upon a
baby boy alone in a truck in a deserted wilderness why they left and
how they feel about their decision.</TE>
<TE>   The tragedy in this is a mother whose six children, including
Gage, had been removed from her; a father who left his baby boy
alone, out of sight for 30 to 90 minutes; two men who didn't want to
be inconvenienced in their hunting trip; and a judge who was way too
lenient.</TE>
<TE>   I think the father felt this way too. That is why he killed
himself. The punishment (30 days in jail) wasn't enough, Judge
Hilder.</TE>

<HD>AOL Fixes Instant Messaging Breach</HD>
<DH>Internet: The company says it has repaired a security gap
that could allow hackers to control computers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>America Online said Thursday it had repaired a major security hole in
its popular Instant Messenger program that could allow a hacker to
take control of individual home computers.</LD>
<LD>   "The issue was resolved early this morning and was handled on the
server side, so users do not have to download anything or take any
other action," AOL spokesman Andrew Weinstein said. "To our
knowledge, no users were affected by this issue prior to its
resolution."</LD>
<LD>   The problem affected the newest as well as many earlier versions
of AOL's Instant Messenger program, which boasts more than 100
million users.</LD>
<TE>   "You could do just about anything: delete files on the computer or
take over the machine," said Matt Conover, founder of the hackers'
group, "w00w00," which claims more than 30 active members from 14
states and nine foreign countries.</TE>
<TE>   Conover, who attends Utah State University, said the group found
the problem several weeks ago but didn't contact AOL until after
Christmas. The group got no response from AOL to an e-mail sent
during the holiday week, he said, so w00w00 released details--and a
program that takes advantage of it--to public security mailing lists
less than a week later.</TE>
<TE>   The program released by w00w00 remotely shut down a user's Instant
Messenger program but could have been modified to do more sinister
things.</TE>
<TE>   That practice is under scrutiny by security professionals. While
some independent researchers argue for a "full-disclosure" policy and
say software vendors are trying to hide their mistakes, many
companies say users are better protected if companies have time to
react.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's pretty dangerous," said Chris Wysopal of the
security company AtStake, "especially since they pretty much
acknowledged that they hadn't gotten a response back from AOL yet."</TE>
<TE>   Russ Cooper, who moderates a popular security mailing list and
works for security firm TruSecure, said Conover's action was
irresponsible because it helped hackers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's better to provide details of the exploit and then
let other people write the actual code," Cooper said. "It lets the
technical community have the information they need without letting
idiots have the information they want."</TE>
<TE>   Also on Thursday, AOL acknowledged that it had increased a monthly
fee by 50% for new customers signing up for e-mail and other services
through rival Internet access providers.</TE>
<TE>   The fee increase, to $14.95 a month, wasn't announced when it took
place several months ago, spokesman Jim Whitney said. About 5% of
AOL's more than 33million subscribers use the plan.</TE>

<HD>AOL Time Warner Expected to Scale Down Forecast</HD>
<DH>Media: Subscriber growth and recent management changes may
be addressed in Monday conference call.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RESHMA KAPADIA</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>AOL Time Warner Inc. is expected to rein in its broad financial
guidance Monday, as the world's largest Internet and media company
contends with slower growth of its U.S. Internet subscriber base and
a soft advertising market.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts looking forward to a conference call Monday were hoping
AOL Time Warner executives would clear up issues pressuring shares,
including the company's pending purchase of the remaining stake in
AOL Europe held by German media conglomerate Bertelsmann.</LD>
<LD>   One of the key things analysts will look for will be more details
on the company's 2002 outlook, including AOL Europe and recent
accounting changes regarding goodwill.</LD>
<TE>   In September, the company cut its 2001 growth estimates and
predicted that 2002 would bring "double-digit" growth in earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA. "We
think they will narrow the definition of double-digit and likely
provide a smaller range--in the low teens and something above
10%--for EBITDA growth," said Goldman Sachs analyst Anthony Noto.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts also expect to learn about subscriber growth, recent
management changes and other topics during AOL Time Warner's first
call since Chief Executive Gerald Levin's decision to retire and the
appointment of top deputy Richard Parsons to succeed him.</TE>
<TE>   Several Wall Street analysts have voiced concerns about slowing
dial-up subscriber growth, long a big growth engine at AOL. These
analysts say demand for high-speed Internet services is not growing
fast enough to offset that slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   Lehman Bros. analyst Holly Becker said she has been disappointed
by AOL's inability to sign pacts with cable providers to offer
high-speed Internet services.</TE>
<TE>   High-speed access is one of the keys for AOL Time Warner's growth,
analysts said. International expansion is another crucial area, and
analysts said AOL Europe will prove to be a big test.</TE>
<TE>   Concerns about a slower rebound for advertising and e-commerce
revenues also have led analysts to trim their revenue and EBITDA
estimates for 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "Since the AOL Time Warner merger closed in January 2001, we have
reduced our 2002 revenue estimate by 16% (excluding AOL Europe),
which now implies 9% top-line growth," Morgan Stanley Internet
analyst Mary Meeker said.</TE>
<TE>   If AOL Time Warner can't show more growth momentum, and the
advertising market doesn't rebound by early 2003, Meeker said she
probably will have to make additional estimate cuts.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner shares lost 2 cents to close at $31.58 on the New
York Stock Exchange, down about 17% from a near-term high of $38.25
in mid-November.</TE>

<HD>Bankruptcy Preparers Hit</HD>
<DH>Consumers: Many give bad or incomplete advice, cost rather
than save clients money, U.S. Trustee's Office says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many Southern Californians who file for bankruptcy protection without
a lawyer are being poorly served by so-called bankruptcy petition
preparers who often give incomplete or bad advice, a report by the
U.S. Trustee's Office contends.</LD>
<LD>   The report, prepared jointly with the Los Angeles County Bar
Assn., alleges that some petition preparers charge "unconscionable"
fees, make errors that cost their clients money and even defraud
people who turn to them for help.</LD>
<LD>   "People are being irreparably harmed because they didn't see a
lawyer," said U.S. Trustee Maureen Tighe, who supervises all Chapter
7 trustees in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court's Central District, which
stretches from Orange County to Santa Barbara.</LD>
<TE>   A leading bankruptcy petition preparer, however, said the report
is part of a "turf war" between attorneys, who typically charge $800
to $2,500 for a bankruptcy filing, and preparers, who typically
charge $200.</TE>
<TE>   "The argument is that people are being harmed. The reality is
people are being served," said Ira Distenfield, chairman of We the
People, a bankruptcy petition preparer with 10 offices in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is critical in Southern California, where the court's
Central District leads the nation both in total bankruptcy filings
and in the number of people who file without being represented by a
lawyer, Tighe said. Such pro se ("for self") filings are "out of
control" because of heavy advertising by petition preparers, Tighe
said.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly one out of three Chapter 7 filings in the Central District
were prepared without a lawyer's help, a ratio that rises to nearly
one out of two in Santa Barbara, where We the People is based,
according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   The report claims some people have been defrauded by unscrupulous
firms that accepted fees without filing bankruptcy paperwork or that
filed for bankruptcy for clients who thought they were receiving help
in preventing eviction or foreclosure.</TE>
<TE>   Improper filings by bankruptcy petition preparers have "routinely"
led to people being saddled with debts that otherwise would have been
erased in bankruptcy or losing assets that should have been
protected, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the trustees will simply overlook the issue" and allow
people to keep assets that weren't properly protected by a filing,
the report said. "Others have liquidated assets where they have not
been exempted, as is their legal duty."</TE>
<TE>   We the People's Distenfield disputed the report's contention that
petitions prepared by nonlawyers are more likely to contain errors.
Distenfield said his firm specializes in simple bankruptcy cases that
are easily handled by its workers.</TE>
<TE>   "We have yet to ever hear of a customer being harmed," Distenfield
said.</TE>
<TE>   The report said most people who use petition preparers do so
because they believe they will save money, but that some preparation
firms charge fees that boost their bills. The firms levy high fees to
provide interpreters, for example, or charge hundreds of dollars
extra to amend forms that the firm prepared incorrectly in the first
place, Tighe said.</TE>
<TE>   "We often discover people have paid $800, $1,000, even $1,500"
once the extra fees are included, Tighe said. "They could have easily
paid for counsel."</TE>
<TE>   The report recommended increased prosecution of preparers who
illegally practice law, greater public education and an expansion of
low-income legal services.</TE>

<HD>Disney Says It's Poised to Revive</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: As company cuts costs, Eisner says it will
recover with economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his annual letter to shareholders, Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive
Michael Eisner acknowledged the company's poor stock performance and
said Disney is poised for a recovery when the economy recovers,
although he did not set any growth targets for this year.</LD>
<LD>   "We are now officially in recession and people have less
disposable income for travel," Eisner wrote in a letter that was
decidedly less chatty and more somber in tone than previous
communications. "However, when the economy does bounce back there is
every reason to believe that the performance at our parks will be
stronger than ever."</LD>
<LD>   Since Sept. 11, attendance has fallen off dramatically at Disney
theme parks, particularly in Orlando, Fla., where attendance has been
down about 25% over last year. The terrorist attacks also worsened a
weak television advertising market at the Disney-owned ABC network.</LD>
<TE>   Disney's stock, which fell 28% last year, is trading close to
where it was five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   To turn the company around, Disney has been paring costs
companywide, Eisner said. Disney cut 4,000 jobs last year and started
new purchasing policies that will save $200 million annually. Disney
Studios also has reduced its investment in live action films by $600
million, Eisner said.</TE>
<TE>   Disney, which has closed 51 Disney retail stores, will shut down
50 more over the next two to three years, reducing the number of U.S.
stores to between 300 and 400, Eisner said.</TE>
<TE>   Spencer Wang, an analyst with ABN Amro, on Thursday upgraded his
rating on Disney to a "buy" from a "hold," predicting an upturn in
the company's struggling theme park and broadcasting business by
2003.</TE>
<TE>   But other analysts note that Disney's woes aren't all
economy-related. "The ratings at ABC leave a lot to be desired and
unfortunately that's not a quick turnaround process," said Katherine
Styponias of Prudential Securities.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner said he expects Disney's stripped-down Internet business
will be profitable by the end of the fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   The company is now focusing on its individual entertainment, news
and sports Web sites, such as ABC.com and ESPN.com and Disney.com.</TE>
<TE>   Disney shares closed up 67 cents at $22.12 on Thursday on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Dynegy, Enron Settle Pipeline Suit</HD>
<DH>Energy: Under the agreement, Dynegy will acquire the
Northern Natural Gas system for $23 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Dynegy Inc. has settled a lawsuit with Enron Corp. subsidiaries and
plans to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline that was part of a
dispute between the two energy companies.</LD>
<LD>   Dynegy said it has agreed to a deal to buy the pipeline by the end
of this month for $23 million.</LD>
<LD>   The deal, however, doesn't mean Dynegy will back down from its
$10-billion breach-of-contract suit it filed against Enron in
November.</LD>
<TE>   Dynegy had claimed that Enron signed away its right to the prized
16,500-mile pipeline system between Texas and the Midwest in exchange
for $1.5 billion invested in Enron before a proposed merger of the
two competitors collapsed in late November.</TE>
<TE>   Enron claimed its smaller rival illegally terminated the
$8.4-billion deal and therefore had no right to the pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   Enron had argued that Dynegy's claim should be part of Enron's
massive bankruptcy case filed in federal court in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement announced Thursday night, the companies have
agreed to close the deal no later than the end of the month. Enron
would have the option to repurchase the pipeline by June 30.</TE>
<TE>   Enron said it will continue to pursue a separate lawsuit against
Dynegy that seeks $10 billion in damages after Dynegy terminated its
merger agreement with Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Enron also said it will amend its original complaint to add an
additional damage claim that calls Dynegy's decision to exercise its
option for the pipeline "wrongful."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), chairman of the Governmental
Affairs investigations subcommittee, said earlier Thursday that his
committee will within weeks subpoena documents from Enron's board of
directors, senior managers and its auditing firm.</TE>
<TE>   Enron filed for bankruptcy protection Dec. 2 as its stock fell
from a high of $90 a year ago to less than $1.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of Enron workers were prevented from selling Enron stock
in their 401(k) retirement plan during the collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Levin said he is dismayed about "what appears to be a massive
shell game with multiple layers of conflict of interest" that
contributed to Enron's collapse at a time when most investors
believed the company to be thriving.</TE>
<TE>   On the New York Stock Exchange Thursday, Enron shares rose one
cent to close at 64 cents, while Dynegy fell 83 cents to close at
$25.28, before the announcement.</TE>

<HD>EUniverse to Buy Direct Marketing Firm L90</HD>
<DH>Web: Los Angeles entertainment company will pay $55million
in effort to expand its audience.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to expand its audience in a tightening Internet market, Los
Angeles online entertainment company EUniverse Inc. said Thursday
that it agreed to buy advertising firm L90 Inc. for about $55
million.</LD>
<LD>   The deal comes as investors continue to doubt the viability of
online profits and question whether ad sales will continue to
slump--and therefore continue to drag down the valuations of
content-related sites, from giants such as Yahoo Inc. and America
Online to smaller outlets such as EUniverse.</LD>
<LD>   The slump also has hit online ad companies' bottom lines. L90,
based in Marina del Rey, is one of the Internet's largest
direct-marketing companies. It has reported a string of increasing
losses over three of the last four quarters, including a
$16.7-million deficit on nearly $18.2 million in revenue for the
quarter ended Sept. 30.</LD>
<TE>   EUniverse operates a network of entertainment-related sites such
as FlowGo.com and Cupid Junction. The company has slowly been posting
a steady profit over the last four quarters, with $851,765 in income
on $6.7 million in revenue for the quarter ended Sept. 30.</TE>
<TE>   The acquisition is expected to add more than $2 million to
EUniverse's profit in the first 12 months after the deal is
completed, said Brad Greenspan, chairman and chief executive of
EUniverse.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of the deal, EUniverse agreed to pay L90 stockholders
between $1.80 and $2 for each share, depending on various issues such
as the amount of cash on L90's balance sheet. EUniverse officials
said the company also would pay another 20 cents per L90 share. The
deal, which has been approved by each company's board of directors,
is expected to close in the next three months.</TE>
<TE>   EUniverse shares, which have soared 214% over the last year,
slipped 6 cents, to $6.08. L90 gained 39 cents, to $1.95, both on
Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Car Makers Debut 3 Models at Auto Show</HD>
<DH>Launch: The vehicles are the domestics' hopes for regaining
some of the market lost to imports.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The domestic Big Three auto makers launched an offensive of sorts
Thursday at the Los Angeles International Auto Show, introducing a
trio of production vehicles that executives hope will help regain
some of the market share that has steadily been slipping away to the
import brands.</LD>
<LD>   Some analysts wondered whether the showing--which will be
bolstered by new products at the North American International Auto
Show in Detroit next week--was a case of too little, too late.</LD>
<LD>   Ford Motor Co.'s Lincoln unit, which has slipped from first place
to sixth among luxury car sellers in the U.S. in recent years, led
the charge with the all-new 2003 Navigator sport-utility. It is a
re-engineered version of the company's high-volume luxury SUV that
features a new interior, new suspension and loads of options
including power retractable running boards and power folding
third-row seats that disappear into the floor to make a flat cargo
area.</LD>
<TE>   General Motors Corp., which has begun showing new life in the
hotly contested and continually growing light-truck market, took the
covers off the production version of its Hummer H2, a slightly
downsized and greatly down-priced version of the gigantic Hummer SUV
derived for the military's Humvee personnel carrier.</TE>
<TE>   And Chrysler Group, which has lost the most ground in the domestic
slide, unwrapped a sleek two-seat coupe, called the Crossfire, that
will use an extensive collection of Mercedes-Benz parts as the two
companies' corporate parent--DaimlerChrysler--finally begins the
platform-sharing programs it once insisted would never happen.</TE>
<TE>   But the import brands, from Asia and Europe, aren't sleeping. They
are matching--or topping--the domestics in new vehicle introductions
for 2003 and 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most interesting debuts in Los Angeles was Honda Motor
Co.'s Model X, a box-like vehicle with a flat-floored interior and
removable seating. Honda calls it a dorm room on wheels. It will be
aimed at the 18- to 25-year-old group and priced below $20,000.</TE>
<TE>   "I just didn't see anything at the Los Angeles show that would
help the domestics surpass the Europeans and Asians," said Dean
Benjamin, president of Autosource Inc., an El Segundo-based auto
industry consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Of the three new production vehicles shown Thursday, he said, only
the Lincoln Navigator is a high-volume model. "And Lincoln still
needs a true flagship sedan," Benjamin said.</TE>
<TE>   One analyst with a more optimistic outlook, J.D. Power &amp;
Associates' product research director Brian Walters, said he was
"pleasantly surprised" by vehicles such as the Crossfire and
Navigator and believes they show "that we will be seeing some real
competitive product from the domestics."</TE>

<HD>Stocks Extend Rally as Optimism Builds in Technology Sector</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Nasdaq pushes past 2,000 again, and the Dow
reaches its highest close since August. Bond yields fall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street extended its new year's rally into a second day Thursday
as growing hopes for a revival of the computer industry in 2002
hoisted the Dow Jones industrial average to its highest close since
August.</LD>
<LD>   "Folks are finally moving money out of money-market funds and bond
funds and back into the equity market ... obviously they're looking
for places that are seeing signs of improvement," said Gail Seneca,
chief investment officer at Seneca Capital Management.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow industrials rose 98.74 points, or 1.0%, to 10,172.14,
powered by technology members such as Intel and Microsoft. It was the
Dow's highest close since Aug. 28.</LD>
<TE>   The tech-focused Nasdaq composite index rose 65.02 points, or
3.3%, to 2,044.27. The index closed above the 2,000 mark for the
first time since Dec. 18. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index gained 10.6
points, or 0.9%, to 1,165.27.</TE>
<TE>   Investors were unfazed by news that a threatening letter
containing a powdery substance--later found to be harmless--was
discovered in the office of Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle.
Reports of letters containing the deadly bacteria roiled the market
late last year.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street expects the economy, now mired in recession, to resume
growth this year. Investors' optimism has helped pull the stock
market well off of three-year lows hit on Sept. 21. Also, the
relative lack of fourth-quarter earnings warnings so far has
encouraged investors to focus on company fundamentals, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, jitters about the fate of ailing corporate profits are
keeping investors wary. Software maker Peregrine Systems, for one,
was hammered after warning of a fiscal third-quarter loss due to the
economic downturn. Peregrine fell 36%, losing $5.24 to $9.27.</TE>
<TE>   Semiconductor shares rose as investors bet chip stocks would be
the first to recover in an economic rebound. The Philadelphia Stock
Exchange semiconductor index shot up 8.3% and has surged more than
50% since Sept. 21.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news:</TE>
<TE>   * Bond yields fell on a report that claims for unemployment
benefits rose unexpectedly last week, raising hopes the Federal
Reserve may cut interest rates again. The yield on the benchmark
10-year Treasury note fell to 5.11% from 5.16% Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   * Kmart fell to new lows, dropping 65 cents to $4.09 after Morgan
Stanley cut its estimates on the company's earnings for fiscal 2002
and 2003. It took a hit Wednesday after a Wall Street analyst
suggested the discount retail chain might face bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   * Pasadena-based Gemstar-TV Guide International slid 9% after an
analyst downgraded the stock because of concerns the company won't
win a lawsuit against Echo- Star Communications. Gemstar's shares
declined $2.58 to $25.46. EchoStar fell 26 cents to 28.49.</TE>
<TE>   * Tyco International fell for a second day in a row, as investors
reacted to a research report that speculated the acquisitive
conglomerate may be the subject of a new investigation by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Tyco, which denied the
speculation, slumped $2.27 to $54.98.</TE>
<TE>   * General Motors rose 71 cents to $49.35, and Ford Motor advanced
51 cents to $16.73. The world's two largest auto makers said U.S.
vehicle sales rose in December, aided by no-interest financing for
buyers.</TE>

<HD>Wireless Firms May Restore Deal for Airwaves</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. mobile-phone carriers will consider restoring an agreement that
gives them control of $15.9 billion worth of airwaves held by
bankrupt NextWave Telecom Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Verizon Wireless Inc., Leap Wireless International Inc. and other
carriers reached an agreement late last year giving NextWave more
than $5 billion to drop legal claims to the airwaves so the bigger
companies could buy them from the government for $10 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The plan expired Monday because Congress failed to act on the
measure as required before adjourning in December.</LD>
<TE>   Leap would like to extend the deadline for congressional action by
90 days if the companies determine "there is a real potential" to get
lawmaker approval, said Leap spokesman Dan Pegg.</TE>
<TE>   "We think we're in striking distance of an agreement, and we just
ran out of time," Pegg said. "The coalition is going to be exploring
their options now that the holidays are over."</TE>
<TE>   Verizon spokesman Jeffrey Nelson declined to comment, as did
NextWave deputy general counsel Michael Wack. Representatives for
other companies involved in the dispute couldn't be reached to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is a dispute that began in 1996, when NextWave bid
$4.7billion in a federal auction for licenses to use the airwaves.
The company paid $500 million before filing for bankruptcy protection
in 1998 and defaulting on the remaining payments. The Federal
Communications Commission repossessed the airwaves and held an
auction in January 2001, raising $15.9 billion from 21 carriers.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. appeals court in June said the FCC violated bankruptcy law
and ordered the licenses returned to NextWave. The FCC appealed to
the Supreme Court and then reached a settlement agreement with
NextWave.</TE>
<TE>   The deal faced opposition from key lawmakers who worried it was
being rushed through Congress. Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D.-S.C.), who
oversees telecommunications issues, wanted to hold a hearing on the
matter this year.</TE>
<TE>   Leap may not agree to wait much more than 90 days after Congress
reconvenes Jan. 23 to get approval for the agreement, Pegg said.
That's because the federal government is holding $85 million that
Leap paid after the auction to back its bids. If it can't get the
airwaves, it could use the money for other purposes.</TE>

<HD>Providian to Lay Off 800 More Workers</HD>
<DH>Financial services: Credit card issuer has cut payroll by
11% as a result of many customers failing to pay their bills.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Providian Financial Corp. will fire another 800 employees to cut
costs as more of its credit card customers are unable to pay their
bills. The reductions will trim first-quarter earnings, the company
said.</LD>
<LD>   With the new cuts, the sixth-biggest Visa and MasterCard issuer
will have reduced its payroll of 12,500 by about 11% since last fall.
The firings--to be completed by mid-month--will lower first-quarter
profit by as much as $15 million, and more reductions are likely,
Providian said.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco-based company replaced its chief executive in
November and wants to sell more than $3 billion in loans to stem
rising credit card losses. Third-quarter earnings fell 71% as more
customers with poor credit histories were unable to pay debts in the
slowing economy. Shares tumbled 94% last year.</LD>
<TE>   "It all contributes to where the company wants to go," said Frank
Barkocy, a senior bank analyst at Keefe Managers Inc., which manages
about $200 million and bought several hundred thousand Providian
shares when it dropped below $3. "There are still a number of head
winds in front of them."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Providian fell 11 cents to $3.44 in New York Stock
Exchange trading.</TE>
<TE>   The company is eliminating telemarketers and other staff who
develop and sell products Providian no longer offers, spokesman Alan
Elias said.</TE>
<TE>   As losses rose, federal regulators prohibited Providian from
issuing new cards to high-risk customers, and the company said it
would retreat from much of its marketing to the most credit-worthy
people to focus on middle-income households.</TE>
<TE>   Providian in November said it would fire 700 employees and close a
Henderson, Nev., phone center, reducing fourth-quarter profit by $12
million. About 150 workers have since been hired in Texas, Elias
said. CEO Joseph Saunders, who ran FleetBoston Financial Corp.'s
credit card business until November, told employees of the reductions
Thursday. The two rounds of cuts will save about $60 million a year,
the company said. In 2000, expenses were $2.47 billion, before taxes.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Walgreen Co. said profit rose 15% in its fiscal first quarter on
strong pharmacy sales and competitive pricing of items such as
vitamins and skin-care goods that helped it lure customers from
rivals in a sluggish retailing environment.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's leading drugstore chain also said it's on track to
add 475 new stores this year, continuing an aggressive expansion

<LD>Warner Music Group has promoted Ron Shapiro and Craig Kallman to
co-presidents of its Atlantic Records division, sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Shapiro started at Atlantic less than a decade ago as a publicist
and is credited with helping transform unknown folk singer Jewel into
an international star. Kallman founded famed dance-music label Big
Beat in the 1980s and sold it to Atlantic a decade ago. The two
executives will report to Atlantic Co-Chairmen Val Azzoli and Ahmet
Ertegun.</LD>
<LD>   Warner Music also is in negotiations to restructure its
profit-sharing relationship with subsidiary Lava Records, which is
expected to result in a sizable payout for talent whiz Jason Flom,
Lava's president.</LD>
<TE>   Warner may pay a lump sum in exchange for a bigger slice of the
profit from Lava, whose roster includes such acts as Kid Rock, Uncle
Kracker and Matchbox Twenty.</TE>

<LD>Artist Direct, the record label start-up headed by entrepreneur Ted
Field, said it would exit the talent agency business after deciding
the agency division could not maintain past growth.</LD>
<LD>   As part of the move, Artist Direct said it lined up with Creative
Artists Agency, which will handle booking tours for the label's
roster of acts. Field said he concluded in an internal review that
Artist Direct's own talent division would not maintain its historical
profit.</LD>
<LD>   Field co-founded Interscope Records, one of the biggest successes
of the 1990s. He left the company in February.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dow Chemical Co. said it will not meet its fourth-quarter earnings
estimate of 10 cents to 20 cents a share as a slowing economy pinched
sales and cut margins.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's largest chemical maker didn't provide other details.
The company reports full results on Jan. 31.</LD>
<LD>   Dow rivals also are seeing profits dwindle as slowing economic
growth weighs on demand for plastics used in cars and coloring for
paint. Chemical makers have been hurt by a slow economy, and one
analyst said Dow's announcement indicates a recovery isn't imminent.</LD>

<LD>Newmont Mining Corp. raised its offer for Normandy Mining Ltd. to
$2.8 billion and won management's support, trumping AngloGold Ltd. in
a seven-week bidding contest for Australia's top gold producer.</LD>
<LD>   Denver-based Newmont's promise to add 10 Australian cents to the
cash and stock bid now worth $1 a share also won the backing of
Normandy's biggest shareholder, Franco-Nevada Mining Corp. AngloGold
said it won't raise its offer. Newmont's offer is now 14% higher than
its first bid Nov. 14, in a bet that gold prices will rise as
companies shut money-losing mines.</LD>
<LD>   Newmont's shares, which have fallen 15% since the Normandy bid was
announced, fell 8 cents to $19.01 on the NYSE.</LD>

<HD>Slatkin to Halt Advisory Role in Investments</HD>

<LD>Bankrupt money manager Reed Slatkin agreed to be barred from
investment management as part of ongoing settlement negotiations with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Slatkin consented to the order barring him from associating with
any investment advisor without admitting or denying guilt, the agency
said. Slatkin attorney Brian Sun said the agreement was "part of our
ongoing effort to try to resolve this."</LD>
<LD>   The SEC accused Slatkin of running a Ponzi scheme shortly after he
filed for bankruptcy in May 2001. Later that month, Slatkin signed a
consent decree with the SEC agreeing not to violate securities laws
in the future.</LD>
<TE>   Slatkin still may face SEC fines and be ordered to pay back money
he took from investors. He also is under criminal investigation.</TE>
<TE>   A bankruptcy trustee said last month that Slatkin operated a Ponzi
scheme, in which new investors' money is used to pay bogus returns to
old investors, since 1986.</TE>
<TE>   The trustee said Slatkin took in $593 million from more than 800
people and still owed investors $255 million.</TE>

<HD>Taxpayers Are Baffled, Activist's Report Says</HD>

<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. tax code has become so complicated that millions of
individuals can't even figure out how to properly report their family
status and dependents, the government's taxpayer representative
reported Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   And that's just one of many problems the nation's 132 million
taxpayers face today, largely as a result of unintended consequences
of piling tax changes on top of one another over the years, Taxpayer
Advocate Nina Olson said in a report delivered to Congress.</LD>
<LD>   Among the problems:</LD>
<TE>   * The many definitions relating to family status, including three
separate definitions to claim a child for purposes of various tax
credits and deductions.</TE>
<TE>   * The alternative minimum tax, established to ensure that wealthy
taxpayers paid at least some tax. Now taxpayers earning as little as
$50,000 are affected.</TE>
<TE>   * The sorry state of IRS toll-free telephone help. Taxpayer
Advocate offices handle thousands of calls each month from
individuals who couldn't reach the IRS' toll-free help or were uneasy
with the accuracy of the advice they received.</TE>
<TE>   Olson acknowledged that there appears to be little legislative
support for tax simplification, but says it needs to be addressed.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The FBI has reversed its advice for computer users trying to protect
themselves against flaws in the latest version of Windows: Applying
the free fix from Microsoft Corp. is adequate, after all.</LD>
<LD>   The bureau's top cyber-security unit, the National Infrastructure
Protection Center, told consumers and companies to disregard its
earlier advice to exceed Microsoft's recommendations to protect
against hackers who might try to attack Windows computers.</LD>
<LD>   The FBI said it based its latest determination "upon a careful on
a review of the written technical materials provided by Microsoft,
and after working with the federally funded CERT Coordination Center,
staffed by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University.</LD>
<TE>   The FBI acknowledged that neither it nor experts at CERT,
previously known as the computer emergency response team, had
independently tested Microsoft's solution. But the FBI said, "We are
satisfied that it corrects the problem ... and affords substantial
and adequate protection."</TE>

<LD>Epicor Software Corp., a developer of business software, announced an
additional round of cost-cutting, trimming its work force by nearly
15% and cutting salaries of senior managers by 5%.</LD>
<LD>   The Irvine company, which employs more than 1,000 people

by $2 million, but should thereafter save it $3 million to $4 million
a quarter.</LD>

also said it cut 12%, or about 30 people, from its work force, and
suspended executive bonuses and stipends for directors.</LD>
<TE>   Starbase has posted losses for the last five years, including a
loss of $16.6 million on revenue of $41.6 million for the fiscal year
ended last March 31.</TE>
<TE>   Epicor shares closed at $2.06, up 56 cents, while Starbase closed
at 75 cents, up 4 cents. Both stocks trade on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>5 United Reservation Centers to Be Closed</HD>
<DH>Airlines: Four facilities are in California, employing
almost 800 people. Some may be offered other positions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>United Airlines, citing its reduced service and the weak economy,
said Thursday that it plans to close five reservations centers,
including four in California, and furlough 899 employees.</LD>
<LD>   Amid the deep slump in air travel after Sept. 11, United has
slashed its operations by more than 20%--to about 1,650 flights a
day--and eliminated about 19,000 of its 100,000 jobs.</LD>
<LD>   Despite a busy holiday season, the carrier's "smaller flight
schedule and the soft U.S. economy" created a "lower level of
reservations telephone activity" that led to the office closings, the
airline said.</LD>
<TE>   The California centers are in El Segundo, with 358 employees;
Burbank, with 156; Moreno Valley in Riverside County, with 160; and
Suisun City in central California, with 124. The other center is in
Rockford, Ill. The closings take effect Feb. 28.</TE>
<TE>   Customers will continue to be served by United's remaining 4,500
reservations agents in 12 other centers, including one in Long Beach,
the carrier said. United, the main unit of UAL Corp., said it also
continues to employ more than 23,000 people in California. Two of the
airline's major hubs are Los Angeles and San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   United said it will offer severance pay to eligible workers
affected by the closures, and that some of the furloughed employees
will be eligible to relocate to other United offices if they so
choose.</TE>
<TE>   UAL stock rose $1.03 to close at $14.73 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Passenger Cars Are Outsold by Light Trucks for First Time</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Light trucks--pickups, sport-utility vehicles and minivans--outsold
passenger cars for the first time in 2001, thanks in part to
unprecedented deals in the months after the September terrorist
attacks, auto makers said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. vehicle sales defied expectations of a year ago and soared to
their second-highest levels ever in 2001, but some analysts say the
incentive-driven sales surge in the fourth quarter may have come at
the expense of sales in 2002, which are expected to drop
significantly.</LD>
<LD>   Sales of passenger cars and trucks reached 17.2 million, just 1.3%
below 2000's record of 17.4 million. The market was spurred by
interest-free loans introduced to boost sales that had slowed to a
crawl after the attacks drove shoppers away from showrooms.</LD>
<TE>   General Motors Corp., which initiated the no-interest and
super-low-interest financing in September that ran until Wednesday,
stemmed a decade-long slide in market share, ending the year with
28.33% of the U.S. market for all of 2001, up from 28.28% for 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Ford Motor Co.'s market share fell from 24.1% in 2000 to 23.1%,
while DaimlerChrysler's share sank from 15.7% in 2000 to 14.4%.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, light trucks accounted for more than half of
the U.S. market, at about 51%. To capitalize on the growing truck
market, auto makers continue to pour resources into developing new
trucks, especially SUVs, such as the all-new Lincoln Navigator
unveiled Thursday at the Los Angeles Auto Show, and new models from
Ford, Volvo, Lexus, Land Rover and Hummer at the North American
International Auto Show in Detroit next week.</TE>
<TE>   "SUVs are the fastest-growing segment, as they have been every
year since 1991," said George Pipas, Ford's director of sales
analysis. "I expect SUVs will outperform all other segments in 2002."</TE>
<TE>   There were 58 different models of SUVs on the American market last
year, but the number is expected to balloon to 85 in 2004, according
to data released this week by industry consultant J.D. Power &amp;
Associates.</TE>
<TE>   Ford continued to have the best-selling SUV, the Explorer, as well
as the best-selling pickup truck in the F-series, which has been the
top-selling vehicle in the U.S. for 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, GM claimed the title of truck champion, saying it set
a record of 2.6 million trucks sold, more than any manufacturer,
ever. "We bested any manufacturer by 200,000. We set a benchmark in
SUVs, being the first to sell 1 million-plus in a calendar year,"
said Paul Ballew, GM's executive director of market industry
analysis.</TE>
<TE>   GM said Thursday that it is introducing a new incentive program:
$2,002 cash back on the purchase or lease of any GM car or truck,
except Saturns, through February.</TE>
<TE>   "We found that a number of consumers wanted cash and not a low
rate of financing," Bill Lovejoy, group vice president of GM North
America Vehicle Sales, Service &amp; Marketing, said in a conference call
with reporters. "This was a lot easier to understand, and for
customers who wanted to do more on leasing, this gives them an
opportunity to buy down leasing rates."</TE>
<TE>   GM was looking into a new, simplified incentive plan in August
when internal research showed that 60% of customers who went to
showrooms didn't know the incentives available on the vehicles they
were interested in, and dealers complained the system of rebates and
low-interest financing based on geographical regions was too
complicated, Lovejoy said.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, GM settled on the interest-free or low-interest
loans as an incentive that was easy to communicate and one that was
quickly copied by Ford and Chrysler Group. Wall Street analysts say
the program cost auto makers $1,500 to $3,000 per vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   GM wanted to maintain sales momentum going into 2002, but analysts
say the incentive programs pulled forward an estimated 500,000 sales
from 2002 into the last quarter of 2001, and the market is likely to
shrink to 15million to 15.5million vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   "GM's announcement that it is replacing its massively popular
[no-interest] financing program with cash rebates of $2,002 reflects
several industry trends, including the rising cost of low-rate loans
as auto-company borrowing costs go up with credit downgrades, and the
desire to avoid a collapse in industry volumes," John Casesa, Merrill
Lynch's senior auto analyst in New York, wrote in a research report.
"Ford followed GM's lead in the 2001 incentive battle and will likely
do so in 2002 with a program comparable to GM's new customer cash
rebate program," Casesa said.</TE>
<TE>   Ford Division President James O'Connor said he has a team dealing
with the issue but declined to say what Ford will do after its own
no-interest financing program runs out this month. "We're going to
look at days' supply, look at production schedules, regional issues,"
O'Connor said in a conference call with analysts and reporters. "You
don't want to go crazy."</TE>
<TE>   Luxury makers also showed strong growth over the year. Acura was
up 19.5%, BMW up 12.5% and Lexus up 8.7%. Still, Lexus widened its
lead as the No. 1 luxury brand in America in 2001, finishing
comfortably ahead of second-place BMW, which in turn beat out
Mercedes-Benz, the No. 2 luxury marque in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other brands posting best-ever years in the U.S. market:
Toyota, Lexus, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Honda, Acura, Subaru, Ford-owned
Volvo, Mitsubishi and Porsche. Honda also regained the title of
best-selling passenger car in America with the Accord, ousting the
Toyota Camry, which had occupied the position the four previous
years.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Acts on Payday Loan Abuse</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In their first enforcement action involving the controversial payday
loan business, federal regulators said Thursday that they have
ordered a Pennsylvania bank to sever its ties with Dollar Financial
Group Inc. and cease making short-term loans against borrowers'
paychecks.</LD>
<LD>   Eagle National Bank of Upper Darby, Pa., is one of four small
national banks that have teamed with payday lenders such as Dollar to
provide such cash advances in a number of states, including
California.</LD>
<LD>   These loans are typically for a few hundred dollars and two to
four weeks, and carry fees that translate into annual interest rates
averaging 470%, the Consumer Federation of America reported in a
study in November.</LD>
<TE>   The action by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency drew
applause from the Washington-based CFA, which teamed up with the U.S.
Public Interest Research Group on the November report blasting the
alliances between banks and payday lenders.</TE>
<TE>   The OCC action "clearly ... recognizes the threat both to
vulnerable consumers and to banks' safety and soundness that these
partnerships pose," said Jean Ann Fox, consumer protection director
for the CFA.</TE>
<TE>   The OCC, which regulates national banks, began warning in late
2000 that the payday lenders, which are not subject to federal
regulation, were using these alliances with national banks to skirt
local and state consumer-protection laws.</TE>
<TE>   The payday lenders contended the banks' federal charters allowed
them to disregard local and state laws when making their loans.</TE>
<TE>   The OCC's insistence that Eagle sever ties with Dollar could have
far-reaching implications for the booming payday loan industry and
for its lenders, who say they are needed because banks won't make
small unsecured loans to low-income customers.</TE>
<TE>   Funding from banks, many of them state-chartered, "has become an
important source for us," said a spokeswoman for the Consumer
Financial Services Assn., a trade group for payday lenders.</TE>
<TE>   The spokeswoman said Berwyn, Pa.-based Dollar Financial, the
nation's second-largest payday lender, isn't a member of CFSA, "but
obviously anything the OCC does is of great importance to us" because
it sets a precedent.</TE>
<TE>   The payday loan industry estimates up to 10 million households
paid $2.4 billion in fees for payday loans last year.</TE>
<TE>   In announcing its action Thursday, OCC examiners said Eagle, which
funded $400 million of these short-term loans last year in 40 states,
had jeopardized its "financial viability" by focusing almost entirely
on that one line of business. Regulators said Eagle failed to monitor
how Dollar handled a long list of duties while handing out the bank's
funds, including quality assurance and audit programs.</TE>
<TE>   "The bank essentially rented out its national bank charter to a
payday lender in order to facilitate that non-bank entity's evasion
of the requirements of state law," Comptroller of the Currency John
D. Hawke Jr. said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Eagle, which admitted no wrongdoing, agreed to adopt within 30
days a plan to discontinue its payday lending by June 15. The bank
currently has about $8 million in payday loans on its books.</TE>
<TE>   Hawke said the OCC has conducted examinations of the other three
national banks affiliated with payday lenders, but wouldn't disclose
what was found or what actions were planned against the other banks.</TE>
<TE>   The industry estimates there are 10,000 offices of check-cashing
firms across the nation where payday loans are made, with the seven
largest firms accounting for less than 20% of the stores.</TE>
<TE>   The largest of these companies, Ace Cash Express Inc., had 1,163
stores as of June. Ace has a funding partnership with Goleta National
Bank near Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Executives of Goleta and its parent company, Community West
Bancshares, didn't return calls seeking comment Thursday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Calls to Eagle and to Dollar Financial also went unreturned.</TE>

<HD>Sunkist's Health Plan Collapses</HD>
<DH>Insurance: Self-funded system's failure is blamed on
unexpectedly high costs. About 23,000 members are affected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER and RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rocked by spiraling health-care costs and poor management, one of
Southern California's larger self-insured health-care plans--created
by citrus cooperative Sunkist Growers Inc.--has folded, forcing tens
of thousands of workers to switch insurance and leaving nearly 5,000
medical providers with unpaid bills.</LD>
<LD>   The collapse of Sunkist's SGP Benefit Plan Inc. exemplifies the
stresses that rapidly rising health-care costs are creating for
employers, many of which are opting for self-insurance to save money
while running the risk of failure if they miscalculate the level of
claims. About two-thirds of employers self-insure, which is raising
concerns that many are underestimating health costs and could face
financial problems as a result.</LD>
<LD>   Sherman Oaks-based Sunkist blames the collapse of the plan on
rising physician fees and drug costs coupled with faulty medical
information management software, which it said caused it to
underestimate the premiums needed to cover claims.</LD>
<TE>   To shrink its growing shortfall, SGP instituted a series of rate
hikes and plan changes beginning in 1999, but it wasn't enough. "The
effect of the inflationary health-care spiral hit us at the wrong
time. We got caught," said Lawrence Thompson of now-defunct Glacier
Insurance Administrators, which managed the plan.</TE>
<TE>   SGP Benefit Plan is expected to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in
the coming days. Since the plan ceased operation in November and its
administrator closed its doors in late December, many of SGP Benefit
Plan's estimated 23,000 participants, who work for about 360
companies, have been transferred to another agriculture trade group's
self-insured plan or have found coverage elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   But the months of unpaid bills forced interruptions in care for
many, officials said, and brought the bills to collection agencies
and some doctors into Small Claims Court. SGP still owes 4,800
medical providers an estimated $10 million in unpaid claims, Thompson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of double-digit increases in health-care costs, many
employers have been investigating self-insured programs in an effort
to save money. Self-funded insurance plans can be more affordable and
more easily managed than private insurance and aren't regulated by
the state. But because employers often don't keep enough money in
reserve after a few years of relatively small claims, a wave of
expensive medical problems can soon bring them down.</TE>
<TE>   Self-funded insurance programs account for 60% to 65% of the
private-sector health plans and a similar if not greater percentage
of government agencies, said Jim Kinder, chief executive of the Santa
Ana-based Self-Insurance Institute of America Inc.</TE>
<TE>   They work well for large companies that operate in several states,
he said, because they aren't subject to the varied rules and
regulations of those states. They are instead regulated under federal
law. And self-funded programs eliminate premium taxes that employers
normally pay.</TE>
<TE>   Kinder acknowledged that there also are some significant downsides
to these types of plans. "You can't walk way from the risk," Kinder
said. "With private insurance, you pay a third party, and they handle
it. When you self-insure, you inherit the problems."</TE>
<TE>   The Sunkist plan was a "multiple employer welfare arrangement,"
just one form of self-funded insurance plan. Kirby Bosley, a
principal with health-care consulting firm William Mercer Co., said
few such plans fail.</TE>
<TE>   There have, however, been instances when even large plans have run
afoul of unforeseen costs, such as the situation faced by the
California Public Employees' Retirement System, whose self-funded
insurance plan was headed for a dramatic run of red ink in 2000 and
wound up implementing a series of rate increases.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, said Bosley, small employers are not equipped for
self-funded plans because they don't have the resources and because
claims amounts can be unpredictable. They make sense for larger
companies that are able to generate sufficient reserves and then hold
on to them until claims are incurred.</TE>
<TE>   But all health-care plans, self-insured or not, face the same
issues of network instability and overall cost increases that cause
problems for employers and consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Kinder said, "When you really get down to the brass tacks of it,
some employers really aren't good candidates for self-insurance
because their balance sheets aren't strong enough and they incur
greater medical expenses than they have revenues to cover them."</TE>
<TE>   The SGP Benefit Plan should have been bailed out by Sunkist
itself, said Sheldon Emmer, a Los Angeles-based attorney for the
plan. It had signed an agreement with the state in 1996 guaranteeing
it would cover any claims that exceeded the plan's reserves.</TE>
<TE>   Sunkist did agree to put up $2.5 million to settle claims, but it
couldn't come to an agreement on the wording of a proposed settlement
and withdrew those funds.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Sunkist could be on the hook for much of the plan's unpaid
bills because of that agreement and because SGP has few assets.
Sunkist officials acknowledge some potential liability but say their
financial responsibility probably will be decided by a trustee or
court.</TE>
<TE>   "My sense is that most people understand that Sunkist was not
running this thing," said Mike Wootton, Sunkist spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Sunkist's board created the nonprofit multiple employer welfare
arrangement in the early 1990s as a lower-cost perk for its member
growers and shippers but eventually expanded the program to take in
other large agribusinesses.</TE>
<TE>   Sunkist claims its board was first alerted of the plan's problem
five months ago, but Thompson said it was a case of foot dragging.
The board should have been aware of its problems as early as late
2000, when it was told the plan couldn't continue to pay the
licensing fee for the Sunkist name, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The state Department of Insurance also knew of the plan's
problems, because SGP filed quarterly financial reports, but lacked
the jurisdiction to intervene. It did not revoke the plan's
certificate of compliance, shutting the plan down, but helped refer
members to another plan.</TE>
<TE>   "Revoking their certificate of compliance sooner could have left
those members up short without coverage in the meantime," said Scott
Edelen, a spokesman for the Department of Insurance. The Department
of Labor has since taken the matter under consideration, Edelen said.</TE>

<HD>Tech Stocks on a Roll; How Long Will It Last?</HD>
<DH>Outlook: Investors see encouraging signs, but many analysts
say shares probably will fall back.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Technology stocks powered the Nasdaq index to its biggest gain in
nearly a month Thursday as investors were encouraged by reports of
increased demand for microprocessors and higher prices for memory
components.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said the news strengthened their belief that the economy
bottomed in the third quarter of last year, but many warned that the
prices of many tech stocks are getting too far ahead of profit
expectations, and probably will fall back in the coming weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Investors were buoyed Thursday by analysts' positive comments on
top microprocessor maker Intel Corp., electronic storage leader EMC
Corp. and other tech companies. In addition, a survey by Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co. showed that chief information officers at big companies
in the U.S. and Europe expect to spend 3% more on technology products
and services this year.</LD>
<TE>   Just a month ago, the same survey found that spending would remain
at 2001 levels.</TE>
<TE>   Chip stocks were among the biggest gainers Thursday, with the
Philadelphia semiconductor index--known as the SOX--jumping 8.3% to
its highest level since August. The technology-focused Nasdaq
composite index climbed back over the 2,000 mark for the first time
in more than two weeks, rising 3.3%, or 65.02 points, to 2,044.27.
Nasdaq last notched a bigger one-day gain Dec. 5, when it rose 4.3%.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second straight robust day for tech stocks. On
Wednesday, a trade group reported that chip revenue rose for the
second month in a row. And South Korea's Hynix Semiconductor Inc.,
the third-largest memory maker, raised its long-term contract prices
by 30% as a supply glut eased.</TE>
<TE>   Contributing to investors' enthusiasm is the lack of profit
warnings from companies that are about to disclose fourth-quarter
results.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in a pre-announcement season, and it's been fairly tame so
far," said J.P. Morgan computer analyst Daniel Kunstler. "We might
have a little bit of upside in terms of expectations."</TE>
<TE>   In the Merrill Lynch survey, executives said they would spend the
most money on storage and software, especially security and
large-enterprise programs. The companies most likely to see increased
business, according to the survey, are Microsoft Corp., Cisco Systems
Inc., Compaq Computer Corp. and IBM Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Several investors and analysts sounded a note of caution, saying
that share prices are rising for emotional reasons that exaggerate
the recent good news and the import of studies pinpointing the
economic bottom as the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people are feeling safer," said Merrill technology
investment strategist John Roy. "The fundamentals certainly aren't
there to support the techs."</TE>
<TE>   Roy and others predict a stock-price correction in the next few
weeks or months.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, skeptics say, competition and excess
manufacturing capacity will make it harder to turn increased sales of
computers, chips and other gear into significant increases in
profits.</TE>
<TE>   "My belief is the stocks are a little bit ahead of the
fundamentals," said Morgan Stanley analyst Mark Edelstone. "The rate
of recovery is going to be relatively slow."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, some investors are taking the rally as an opportunity to
reduce their holdings. Brinson Partners Inc. of Chicago is among
those selling some semiconductor shares, said Brinson portfolio
manager Michael Nell. The firm owns stock in Advanced Micro Devices
Inc. and Analog Devices Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good that we're forming a fundamental bottom in terms of
year-over-year comparisons, but we don't think that many
opportunities are out there in terms of stock valuations," Nell said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Nasdaq remains far below its peak of March 2000,
price-to-earnings ratios still are high by historical standards.</TE>
<TE>   Intel ended Thursday's trading at more than 46 times its last
year's earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Intel jumped $2.52 to $35.52, or 7.6%, after J.P. Morgan analyst
Eric Chen said December demand for its chips grew. Competitor AMD
gained 18% after similar comments by another analyst.</TE>
<TE>   Although many investment professionals predict the rally won't
last, the early run-up suggests that tech stocks will remain among
the most volatile issues in 2002.</TE>

<HD>Tourism Industry Sees an Upturn</HD>
<DH>Travel: Attractions such as theme parks have an unexpected
surge in holiday visitors, but discounting cuts profits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE HARRIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite expectations of a sluggish holiday season after Sept. 11,
some of the country's major tourist sites and attractions received a
welcomed jolt in attendance, fueled by heavy discounting, rising
consumer confidence and plain, old restlessness.</LD>
<LD>   Theme parks in Florida and California reported packed crowds over
the holidays. Las Vegas said the arrival of some 300,000 visitors
pushed the city's hotel occupancy rate to 97% during the extended New
Year's weekend. Hawaii, which has been devastated by a drop in
tourism since Sept. 11, attracted 90% of the visitors during the week
of Christmas that it did the previous year, tourism officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Although analysts remained cautious about the near-term outlook
for travel and tourism, they said the unexpectedly strong holiday
activity reflects slow but steady recovery in the industry.</LD>
<TE>   America West and Continental airlines reported Thursday that
although passenger traffic in December was down because of flight
reductions, their so-called load factors for the month were
essentially the same as December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "We are encouraged by signs that customers are gradually returning
to the skies," said Scott Kirby, America West's executive vice
president of marketing.</TE>
<TE>   Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's research center,
said the rush of holiday travel is in line with her organization's
latest consumer confidence index, which showed an encouraging rebound
in December after declining the three previous months.</TE>
<TE>   "The increase shows the economy may be bottoming out and a rebound
by mid-2002 is likely," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the holidays, Walt Disney Co.'s Walt Disney World in Orlando,
Fla., said it closed the gates three times because of throngs of
visitors. Disneyland and Vivendi Universal's Universal Studios in
Hollywood boasted their strongest attendance since the terrorist
attacks. The turnout was even bigger for Legoland California in
Carlsbad, Calif., where officials said the last two weeks of December
were the busiest of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "The timing of our discounts, holiday programs and new fireworks
show all came together to make it a huge holiday season for us," said
spokeswoman Courtney Simmons, noting that attendance for both weeks
was 15% higher than in 2000. "Plus, you have to remember our niche.
It's families with children 2 to 12, and being with family is what
it's all about right now."</TE>
<TE>   In Anaheim, hotel occupancy remained strong the week after
Christmas through New Year's Eve, when nearly 65,000 visitors
descended on Disneyland and California Adventure for the annual
countdown and fireworks show.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 60,000 from Nebraska and 20,000 from Miami made the
trip to Los Angeles for the Rose Bowl, according to tourism officials
who generally count on the event to bring in about $200 million in
visitor spending.</TE>
<TE>   "They came and they spent money," said Jack Kyser, chief economist
at the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. "We love them
one and all."</TE>
<TE>   For many hotels, however, the holiday boost amounted to far less
in revenue this year.</TE>
<TE>   At places such as Orlando, room rates are down from 20% to 50%,
said Richard Maladecki, president of the Central Florida Hotel Motel
Assn. And analysts say the rest of the winter will be soft for travel
and tourist businesses--with some places not expecting a full
recovery for another year.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando--which claimed at least an 85% occupancy rate for its
107,000 hotel rooms the week after Christmas--finished the month with
an overall rate of 55%, down from 70% a year earlier, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope it will get better, but our advance reservations aren't
as strong as they should be, and things have already slowed way, way
down here," Maladecki said.</TE>
<TE>   Tourism consultant Peter Yesawich said the brief bump in business
was "a bright light" for the sagging industry but should not be
considered a barometer for what 2002 will bring. His Orlando-based
firm, Yesawich, Pepperdine &amp; Brown, has conducted three polls since
Sept. 11 related to travel intent and each time the numbers have
improved--but only slightly, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This coming year is going to produce a slow recovery, accelerated
by heavy promotional pricing and led by leisure travelers," Yesawich
said. "People are looking for destinations closer to home, but they
are slowly, slowly becoming less skittish about flying too."</TE>
<TE>   In Hawaii, tourism last year was down 28% from 2000. The state's
tourism officials said international visitors, who comprise one-third
of the total, are creeping back. Andy Kish, an economist at
Economy.com, said the number of arrivals in Hawaii from Japan for
Christmas reached about 80% what it was in 2000. In September and
October, the number was less than 40% of the prior year, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Eugene Tian, an economist for Hawaii's Economic Development and
Tourism Research, said he doesn't anticipate more than a 3% growth in
tourism this year.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still a little pessimistic," Tian said. "Our economy is far
weaker now. We won't pull out of this completely until 2003."</TE>
<TE>   Some industry experts doubt it will take that long elsewhere, as
the country moves further away from Sept. 11 and families begin to
move around again. Theme parks may benefit the most, said Tim
O'Brien, senior editor of Amusement Business, which tracks the
industry.</TE>

<HD>FCC Set to OK New Wireless System</HD>
<DH>Telecom: The consumer electronics industry may be
revolutionized with ultra-wideband's high-speed technology.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal regulators are on the verge of approving a breakthrough
wireless technology backed by Intel Corp., Sony Corp. and other big
names that could revolutionize the consumer electronics industry.</LD>
<LD>   The technology, known as ultra-wideband, could provide very
high-speed wireless Internet access and facilitate other wireless
capabilities such as allowing consumers to track intruders with home
radar, helping rescuers find earthquake victims and greatly improving
collision-avoidance systems.</LD>
<LD>   More than a decade in the making, the versatile technology has
been bitterly opposed by airlines and cell phone companies, which say
it can cause interference with their communications systems.</LD>
<TE>   The Federal Communications Commission still is negotiating with
opponents, but Bruce A. Franca, acting chief of the FCC's office of
engineering, said he is hopeful that an accord can be reached and
that the FCC will approve the technology next month.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the FCC granted temporary permission to use
ultra-wideband devices to locate victims of the World Trade Center
collapse. The agency is considering permanent approval under the same
FCC rules that govern such unlicensed wireless devices as cordless
phones and baby monitors. New consumer products using ultra-wideband
could be on the market as early as this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultra-wideband companies are ready to go," said Jeff Ross, a vice
president at TimeDomain, a Huntsville, Ala., company that has been
developing the technology. He said his company is already selling
ultra-wideband tracking devices to the military and some police
departments. But the company and other ultra-wideband developers will
mostly leave the consumer device manufacturing to others and
concentrate on making the key ultra-wideband receiving transmission
microchips. Ross said such chips should be ready for use in consumer
equipment "in the next couple of months."</TE>
<TE>   Ultra-wideband's sprint to market has been aided by its flexible
technology, comparatively low cost and fortuitous timing, experts
say.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most other wireless systems, which transmit signals on
specific airwaves, ultra-wideband devices communicate through short
pulses of low power radio energy. And they use a swath of frequencies
spanning cell phones to satellite signals.</TE>
<TE>   FCC officials, dismissing critics' claims that the pulses cause
interference, say the technology uses small amounts of power--only
fractions of a watt--and that it doesn't require the same lengthy
licensing scrutiny given to broadcasters, cell phone companies and
other wireless devices. However, the agency is considering initially
limiting ultra-wideband to small areas before allowing more broadly
disbursed networks covering, say, airports or shopping malls.</TE>
<TE>   Ultra-wideband is a digitally enhanced radar technology that
enables users to transmit encrypted voice and radar signals
simultaneously, using short bursts of radio waves. Its signals are
difficult to intercept and can be digitally encrypted for additional
security.</TE>
<TE>   This combination could eliminate much of the eavesdropping hackers
can now do on many wireless networks because an ultra-band network
can be configured to communicate only with users at a specific
location.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, military commanders and firefighters could use
ultra-wideband to track their personnel in the field while also
talking to them securely. By contrast, radios emit such a strong
signal that they can be identified by an enemy or eavesdropper.</TE>
<TE>   These traits have helped win ultra-wideband greater government
acceptance amid the nation's increasing focus on security after the
Sept. 11 attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center, industry
executives say.</TE>
<TE>   Executives at TimeDomain said that in recent years they could
barely get a foot in the door in Washington to peddle their
technology. But after the terrorist attacks, everyone from the Office
of Naval Research to Congress began seeking them out to use
ultra-wideband in military and search-and-rescue operations.</TE>
<TE>   Besides TimeDomain, half a dozen other start-ups are developing
ultra-wideband technology, including Aether Wire &amp; Location Inc. of
Nicasio, Calif., Pulse-Link Inc. of San Diego, Multispectral
Solutions Inc. of Germantown, Md., and Xtreme Spectrum of Vienna, Va.</TE>
<TE>   The technology also is being backed by chip maker Intel, which
held a big industry forum on the subject in October. Meanwhile,
consumer electronics giant Sony is hoping to utilize the technology
for high-speed wireless video transmission and home-video networks
linked to TV set-top boxes.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its promise, ultra-wideband faces some hurdles.</TE>
<TE>   Other unregulated wireless services, such as the short-range radio
technology Bluetooth and the wireless ethernet standard 802.11b, have
a year or more head start and already are in many laptops, cell
phones and hand-held devices. However, these technologies are slower
and more costly than ultra-wideband and are unsuited for transmitting
video and other bandwidth-hogging applications.</TE>

<HD>Vandals Use Axes on O.C. Schools</HD>
<DH>Crime: Windows, lockers, fountains battered at Capistrano Unified
campuses, as the toll tops $50,000. 3 teens arrested.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vandals rampaged through two South County schools late Wednesday,
causing the worst damage in Capistrano Unified School District history
and prompting officials to consider expanding the use of cameras and
security guards.</LD>
<LD>   The destruction began about 9:30 p.m. when someone broke into a
toolshed at Capistrano Valley High School, stole two axes and other
tools, and then took them to tear up Del Obispo Elementary School and
Marco Forster Middle School. Damage totaled more than $50,000,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Three suspects were arrested by Orange County sheriff's deputies about
midnight, an hour after residents in the neighborhood of Marco Forster
reported hearing suspicious noises.</LD>
<TE>   Booked on suspicion of felony vandalism were Daniel J. Kenway, 18, a
Dana Hills High School student, Robert DeLuca, 19, a Capistrano Valley
High graduate, and a 17-year-old student at Dana Hills. All three were
released from jail on their own recognizance.</TE>
<TE>   The worst damage occurred at Marco Forster school, where roof tiles,
lockers and water fountains were smashed, and cafeteria windows and light
fixtures broken. At adjacent Del Obispo, about 15 handmade planter boxes
were ripped from two rows of portable classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   "It was all malicious vandalism, but the planter boxes that were made
by students and staff were especially meaningful," said Dan Crawford,
head of facilities for Capistrano Unified.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say arrests in such cases are unusual, but the timing of the
crime--during the extended holiday recess--is not.</TE>
<TE>   "Schools are not designed to be defended. They are open places . . .
and quite vulnerable. They're much more a target during holidays," said
Ron Stephens, executive director of the nonprofit National School Safety
Center in Westlake Village.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, 25,430 property crimes at schools were reported to the
California Department of Education in 1999-2000, down from 27,090
incidents four years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the decline, the cost of theft, vandalism and arson is steep:
$24 million in 1999-2000, the last year for which statistics are
available.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been said that we spend more on vandalism than we do on
textbooks in our schools," Stephens said.</TE>
<TE>   Districts, most notably the Los Angeles Unified School District, have
turned to cameras to deter vandals, especially during holiday breaks when
campuses go dark for days or weeks at a time.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a trend I've noticed for many years," said Lt. Keith Moore with
the Los Angeles school district police.</TE>
<TE>   "The vandals know there's no one at school, so they strike. We deploy
extra officers during that time."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, L.A. Unified has installed cameras at 10 high schools
and Moore said there are plans for "a significant camera presence" on
most campuses.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking at getting cameras that show real time, where they can
be monitored on laptops or desktop computers," said Moore, who estimated
the cost for each system at $250,000.</TE>
<TE>   Already, Moore said, districts in Cleveland; Jackson, Miss.; and
Washington, D.C., can monitor campus activity online.</TE>
<TE>   "Technology can be one of a school's best friends in combating
vandalism," Stephens said. "The cost is huge. But you either pay for
vandalism or pay for vandalism protection."</TE>
<TE>   There were no cameras at Capistrano Valley High, but surveillance
equipment is in place at three district high schools: San Clemente, Dana
Hills and Junipero Serra.</TE>
<TE>   Crawford said cameras are scheduled go into all secondary schools in
the district within a year.</TE>
<TE>   But cameras won't necessarily deter vandals, said Richard Sams, senior
risk services consultant for the Alliance of Schools for Cooperative
Insurance Programs, a statewide insurance pool made up of 82 public
school districts in California.</TE>
<TE>   Unless there are enough of them--and they are installed
properly--cameras won't capture anything of value, Sams said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen schools where they've installed the Radio Shack camera and
a 5-inch monitor," Sams said. "It gives somebody the impression that
something is going on, when there isn't."</TE>

<HD>Airport Mailer by County Sent After Court Ban</HD>
<DH>Law: Postcards went out a day after a judge blocked official El
Toro advocacy on a March initiative. Who knew what, and when, is
disputed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. REZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thousands of postcards paid for by Orange County to promote an
airport at El Toro were shipped to the post office one day after a judge
ordered officials not to advocate on a crucial March initiative to decide
the future of the closed Marine base.</LD>
<LD>   Residents received the bulk mailer hailing the proposed airport as "a
local taxpayer asset" and "a local economic benefit" this week. On Dec.
21, San Diego County Superior Court Judge Charles R. Hayes ordered Orange
County to stop using public funds to promote an airport at El Toro or to
oppose the initiative.</LD>
<LD>   Dan Siwulec, owner of Service Mailers, the company hired to mail the
postcards, said his firm trucked the pieces to post offices in Santa Ana,
Anaheim and Long Beach on Dec. 21, the day of Hayes' ruling, and on Dec.
22. Siwulec said he was never told about the judge's order.</LD>
<TE>   County voters will cast ballots in March on whether to replace the
county's plans to build a commercial airport at the base with zoning for
an urban park and other development. For years, a three-member majority
on the Board of Supervisors has favored an airport.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody told me about the injunction. Nobody said to hold [the
mailers]. This is the first I've heard about this," said Siwulec in a
telephone interview. He said he has been vacationing in Michigan since
Dec. 15.</TE>
<TE>   The mailer was designed by the Sacramento firm of Townsend, Besler,
Usher &amp; Raimundo. Jeff Raimundo said the office was notified by the
county by fax Dec. 23 about the injunction. He said two-thirds of the
mailers were taken to the post office Dec. 21 and the other third Dec.
22.</TE>
<TE>   County officials said 681,000 postcards were mailed at a cost of
$154,000, including production. Except for the postage, none of the
vendors has been paid for working on the postcard, said El Toro program
manager Gary Simon. He said it is up to the court to decide when the
contractors will be paid.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer, an El Toro airport opponent, called the
county's failure to stop the Dec. 22 shipment to the post office "a
contempt of court."</TE>
<TE>   "The county had a responsibility to immediately notify all vendors,
especially if they knew they had a postcard scheduled to go in the mail,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said Simon had assured him Dec. 21 that there were no mailers
or newsletters "in the pipeline."</TE>
<TE>   "I called him and asked him, 'Do you have any mail in the pipeline?'
He said, 'No,' " Spitzer said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, however, said that he was "very clear" with Spitzer about the
pending mailer. "I told him that two days earlier we signed with the post
office for [mailing out] the postcard."</TE>
<TE>   But other county officials apparently weren't as clear on the mailer's
status.</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Emard, the county's spokeswoman on El Toro, initially said
she had been told that the postcards were pulled before they were mailed.
Later she said that she had "assumed" that they were never mailed because
she had not received one at home.</TE>
<TE>   In an e-mail Wednesday to a staff member in Spitzer's office,
Christina Hiatt, public affairs manager for the county agency in charge
of redeveloping El Toro and an aide to Simon, assured him that the
postcards were "in the pipeline but never [were]released . . . due to the
court hearing."</TE>
<TE>   But in a follow-up e-mail less than three hours later, Hiatt said the
mailer had gone out after all. "We tried to pull it, but it was already
at the post office," she said.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Hiatt said she had only "assumed it had been pulled."</TE>
<TE>   Kathleen Morris, an attorney for the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority,
an anti-airport coalition of South County cities, said the county
counsel's office told her that an unsuccessful attempt was made to pull
the postcards.</TE>
<TE>   But Deputy County Counsel Don Rubin said he was "told the mailer was
sent out before the court's injunction was handed down."</TE>
<TE>   Simon said there was never an attempt to retrieve the postcards.</TE>
<TE>   "We were conducting business as usual in our public information
program until we received the court order," he said. "When the order was
issued, I was very vocal that the postcard was already in the mail and
could not be pulled."</TE>
<TE>   According to Simon, the county signed an agreement with the post
office Dec. 19 for the bulk mailing.</TE>
<TE>   "We signed the agreement before the court order. When you sign that
form, there's no turning back. It's the equivalent of dropping something
in a mailbox. It can't be retrieved," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But while the agreement was apparently signed Dec. 19, Siwulec said
his company did not truck the mailer to the three post offices until Dec.
21 and Dec. 22.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Jacobs, another attorney for airport opponents, said he may
pursue legal action against the county if a review shows that officials
violated the court's order.</TE>
<TE>   "If this postcard had been in the works and in the post office when
the injunction was finalized, that's one thing," he said. "But if it was
knowingly and consciously sent out afterward, we will take enforcement
steps."</TE>

<HD>Spiffed-Up, Beefed-Up Santa Ana Zoo Counts on Reaccreditation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Santa Ana Zoo, which lost its accreditation more than a year
ago because of structural and other problems, will host inspectors next
week who will decide whether $1.5 million in improvements bring the
Prentice Park facility up to standards.</LD>
<LD>   The outcome could have serious implications for the 50-year-old
municipal facility.</LD>
<LD>   "It hasn't affected us too much up to this point," said Rip Ribble,
executive director of parks, recreation and community services for Santa
Ana, which owns and operates the 20-acre zoo. But if the facility is not
reaccredited, he said, "we expect that we would really start feeling it."</LD>
<TE>   Accreditation, which must be renewed every five years, is not required
to operate a zoo, Ribble said, but it can have a major impact on
fund-raising, hiring and the ability to borrow animals from other
accredited zoos.</TE>
<TE>   "The value of being accredited is extremely high," Ribble said.
"Without it, we would lose some of our animals."</TE>
<TE>   He said city and zoo officials are taking the situation seriously.
"This is really a nice zoo," he said. "We're doing everything we can to
make it the best zoo around."</TE>
<TE>   Accredited since 1985, the Santa Ana Zoo lost that status in September
2000, Ribble said, after three inspectors from the American Zoo and
Aquarium Assn. in Silver Spring, Md., reported that maintenance and
improvements had been delayed, that the staff was too small and that
there was no written agreement with Friends of the Santa Ana Zoo, the
facility's nonprofit support group, outlining respective
responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   All of those problems have since been resolved, Ribble said. The city
viewed the zoo's loss of accreditation as "kind of a wake-up call," he
said. "We used it as an opportunity to get certain things done."</TE>
<TE>   Zoo director Ron Glazier said improvements include a redesigned
entrance; a remodeled commissary and animal kitchen; a new staff locker
area, quarantine facility and veterinary clinic; new chain-link fences;
and repaved walkways and parking. Money for the renovations came from the
city, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Glazier said, the zoo added six staff members: four
zookeepers, an associate curator and a general maintenance worker. The
staff also wrote a new agreement with Friends of the Santa Ana Zoo.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie Perovich, Friends director, said, "The city's been great. I'm
really optimistic."</TE>
<TE>   So is Glazier, who said Thursday he fully expects the zoo's
accreditation to be renewed in March, when the national association
announces its decision at its biannual meeting in Wichita, Kan.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, he said, the facility will keep relying on its good name
to get by, as it has done for more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   "Because we've had a long-standing reputation with other zoos, they
realized that what they're dealing with is not an institution that
doesn't care," Glazier said.</TE>
<TE>   The American Zoo and Aquarium Assn.'s three-person inspection teams
comprise a zoo director, a veterinarian and a curator.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Ana Zoo's review will be Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.</TE>

<HD>Sketches of Guard's Killer Released</HD>
<DH>Crime: Brinks offers $100,000 reward for the gunman, who made off
with 20,000 $1 bills.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anaheim police on Thursday released sketches of a man wanted in
connection with the fatal shooting of a Brinks armored truck guard,
saying the assailant got away with $20,000 in $1 bills.</LD>
<LD>   Brinks Inc. also offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to
the arrest of those responsible for the death of Ricardo Gomez, who was
gunned down Dec. 17 as he picked up cash from a catering company.</LD>
<LD>   Police urged people to be alert for anyone with a large number of $1
bills.</LD>
<TE>   "If a person tries to get rid of their dollar bills at the banks,
supermarkets or anywhere, please call us," said Anaheim Police Sgt. Mike
Hidalgo. "It's kind of unusual for someone to pay with all dollar bills."</TE>
<TE>   Gomez, 29, was shot once in the head and died at the scene when he was
confronted by a gunman in a hallway at Orange County Food Services. The
gunman fled on foot after the 1:20 p.m. robbery.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said they don't know how the man got inside the
building. They have not ruled out that the robbery was an inside job.</TE>
<TE>   Family members gathered at a news conference Thursday to ask for the
public's help.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to say that, please, if anybody saw something or knows
something, please call the police," said Gomez's widow, Veronica, a
26-year-old Orange resident.</TE>
<TE>   The gunman is described as white, in his late 30s, about 200 pounds
and about 6 feet tall. He has a medium build and short, light-colored
hair.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information is urged to call Anaheim police at (714)
765-1516.</TE>

<LD>A blaze that gutted an Anaheim home, causing $30,000 in damage,
started when an electrical short circuit ignited a Christmas tree,

<LD>   The residents--a woman and her child--were home when the fire started
but escaped without injuries, Anaheim fire spokeswoman Maria Sabol said.
They were staying at a relative's home Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   About 20 firefighters responded to the incident at 8 p.m. Wednesday at
the house in the 1300 block of Wilken Way, officials said.</LD>

<HD>Bonehead Play in Youth Sports: Punishing Coach for Rowdy Fans</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What's going on here? It's madness, I tell you! Madness!</LD>
<LD>   (Pause for dramatic flourish and mopping of fevered brow.)</LD>
<LD>   All right, if not madness . . . how about just plain kooky?</LD>
<TE>   It's not a news flash to report that some adults act like colicky
infants when they attend their children's sporting events. With their
screaming or taunting, parents can turn a fun day at the ol' ball yard or
gym into an "America's Most Wanted" episode.</TE>
<TE>   We know something should be done with these loudmouths, but we long
ago banned public floggings. Nor is it legal to pelt thy neighbor with
overripe fruit.</TE>
<TE>   So, what to do?</TE>
<TE>   An Orange County-based youth basketball league is endorsing a new way
to corral these temporarily insane fans. The National Junior Basketball
league, for kids up to age 18, is putting the onus on the coaches to
control the fans.</TE>
<TE>   You can't blame the league for trying, but it seems to me that the
idea is off the mark. That's an unfair burden for the coaches, who often
have enough to do trying to control themselves. Not to mention coaching
the game.</TE>
<TE>   Under the system, referees can hand a coach a blue card during the
game if his team's fans get out of line. If a coach gets two blue cards,
he gets kicked out of the game and suspended for the next one. That's
right: not the offending fan, but the coach. If the coach gets a third
card somewhere down the road, he's suspended for the season.</TE>
<TE>   A fourth card? Hard time in a state penal institution?</TE>
<TE>   Well, they haven't gone that far yet, but why not? Desperate times
call for desperate measures.</TE>
<TE>   It only shows you how kooky (yes, that's the word) things are when one
adult (the coach) gets punished for the behavior of another (the fan).
These obnoxious parents are guilty of disturbing the peace, but why
punish the coach? Besides, some of these parents are so nutty, they'll
cause a ruckus just to get a coach suspended.</TE>
<TE>   League officials are not the villains here. Their rationale is that
the referees can't be expected to work the game and monitor the stands.
So, the next best thing, the league figures, is to make the coaches do
it.</TE>
<TE>   Let's hope the ACLU doesn't hear about this. It sounds vaguely
anti-Jeffersonian or something to eject a coach because a fan is making a
fool out of himself.</TE>
<TE>   Pretty pathetic, isn't it, that we've come to this? And it's not as
though league officials are trying to stir up trouble. Bad parental
behavior at kids' sporting events--ranging from abusive language to
physical assaults--is a nationwide problem.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the governing body for high school sports has cards
available to schools that want them. The cards can be given to offending
parents at sporting events, informing them they'll be escorted from the
site if they don't behave.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a thought. In the wake of the terrorist attacks, why not extend
the concept now used on some airplanes. You know the drill: If you see a
suspicious passenger trying to light up his shoe, you pounce.</TE>
<TE>   Why not at a kiddie basketball game? You see a parent ruining the game
for everyone else, you take action. The old Woody Allen line comes to
mind: "What I wouldn't give for a sock full of manure."</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, that would probably just cause more trouble.</TE>
<TE>   I vote for public embarrassment. How about a plan where the game would
be stopped if a parent went over the line? The fan would be identified
and asked to step onto the field of play.</TE>
<TE>   Then, an official would simply say into the microphone, "Ladies and
gentlemen, we have with us Mr. Joe Fan. He may be a fine person during
the week, but at various times during today's game, he's been a royal
jerk. We're sorry you've had to listen to him. That's his daughter,
Sally, out there playing her heart out. Too bad, isn't it, her day is
being ruined by her father?"</TE>
<TE>   Madness? Kookiness?</TE>
<TE>   Sorry, folks, we're already there.</TE>

<HD>Hospital Says It's on the Mend</HD>
<DH>Finances: The struggling Santa Paula facility is forced to borrow,
but officials say it recently turned a profit for the first time in years
and expects to slash losses.</DH>

<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Struggling to survive, Santa Paula Memorial Hospital has been
forced to borrow money for the first time in its history. But officials
say the tiny medical center is in the middle of a remarkable economic
turnaround that could keep its doors open indefinitely.</LD>
<LD>   A decade of losses has drained $14 million from its once healthy
reserves and forced Ventura County's smallest general hospital to borrow
to pay its bills. But the 39-bed facility made money for the first time
in years in November and expects to cut its losses by two-thirds this
year, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Patient, physician and community support is expected to cut losses
from nearly $3.2 million in the last fiscal year to less than $1 million
during the 12 months ending in March, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   "We have applied for a million-dollar line of credit that will help us
with cash flow," hospital trustee Anita Tate said. "That makes us take a
deep breath because we have not done this before. But that's the only way
we could see to stay in business."</TE>
<TE>   Closure would strike a blow at the heart of Santa Paula. The hospital
is the farm town's second-largest employer with 265 workers, and its
doctors have saved countless lives since it was built solely with
community donations in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital officials said the successes of the last year are evidence
that the panicked efforts of a year ago to keep the facility open have
given way to a belief in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Surgeons have done 30% more operations since last March than they did
during the same period a year before. Obstetricians have delivered 20%
more babies. The number of patients has increased from 14 to 18 on a
typical day.</TE>
<TE>   The time it takes the hospital to collect for its services has dropped
from more than 90 days to 55, said hospital chief executive Mark Gregson.
And the hospital has received grants from state and local agencies for $1
million over three years for new programs treating obesity, diabetes in
children and teenage pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we'll not only survive but thrive," Gregson said. "Truly,
there's just been a huge amount of rallying behind us. The community,
medical staff, employees and businesses want us here."</TE>
<TE>   Gregson said a recent holiday fund-raiser made clear the difference a
year can make.</TE>
<TE>   "We raised $20,000 at our annual holiday benefit last year, and we
raised $100,000 this year," he said. "The discussion has changed from
that of crisis to planning how to meet the needs of this community."</TE>
<TE>   Jeffery Alexander, a Boston attorney and health-care consultant, said
that in his two decades of helping dozens of hospitals, he has never seen
a more dazzling reversal of fortune than Santa Paula's.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't have taken book on that place staying open six months when
I was there last year," Alexander said. "This turnaround is really
unbelievable. It's Lazarus back from the dead. It's nothing short of
miraculous."</TE>
<TE>   Alexander, hired by the Quorum Health Group, a national management
company that runs Santa Paula hospital, said he now gives the facility
better than a 50% chance of survival.</TE>
<TE>   Without effective reform, the little hospital perched on a hill above
the orchards of the Santa Clara Valley had no future. It had seen its
operating losses mount from $93,000 in 1990 to more than $3 million last
year.</TE>
<TE>   In a world of cutthroat managed-care contracts, its prospects were
bleak.</TE>
<TE>   Then, as the hospital was celebrating its 40th anniversary, officials
developed a plan to keep it from dying.</TE>
<TE>   They pledged to work closer with local doctors to make sure they
referred every possible patient there, instead of the private Community
Memorial Hospital or the public Ventura County Medical Center, both 15 to
20 minutes away in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   They took their case to the 45,000 residents of the bucolic Santa
Clara Valley, telling group after group about the hospital's dire
financial straits and asking them to stay in the valley for surgeries or
to deliver babies.</TE>
<TE>   They persuaded employers and employee groups in Santa Paula and
Fillmore to add Santa Paula hospital--and the physician group that serves
it--to the list of options on their health plans.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Deutsch, a family doctor in Santa Paula since 1980, said the
community finally recognized that its hospital could close any time, and
local doctors finally sat down to work out differences with
administrators.</TE>
<TE>   "The community decided to support this hospital," said Deutsch,
president of the 40-doctor Valley Care physicians group in Santa Paula
and Fillmore.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm encouraged because we're seeing the turnaround in the hospital's
bottom line each month," Deutsch said. "The surgical specialists are
bringing their cases to Santa Paula, and they're receiving very favorable
feedback from their patients. Surgical cases can make or break a
hospital."</TE>
<TE>   Surgeons now operate at Santa Paula in orthopedics, urology,
gynecology, ophthalmology and general surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "That translates straight to the bottom line," Gregson said.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital has added an obstetrician and pediatrician to its staff,
hiking business in two lucrative areas. It also now has a cardiologist
and a full-time "hospitalist," who assumes care of patients from their
primary doctors, freeing physicians to see more patients in their
offices.</TE>
<TE>   New equipment has also come through the door to enhance laboratories
and waiting rooms. A new $1-million CT body scanner is set to arrive
soon.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't hit home runs," Gregson said. "But we've hit lots and lots
of singles, and those singles add up."</TE>
<TE>   From a broader perspective, a spokesman for the Health Care Assn. of
Southern California, a hospital industry group, said he is surprised by
Santa Paula's success in difficult times.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-six hospitals have closed in Southern California since 1995,
and nearly two-thirds of the 440 hospitals in California are losing money
on operations, spokesman Jim Lott said.</TE>

<HD>County Searches Bankruptcy Cases for Unpaid Taxes</HD>
<DH>Government: The collector's office, which failed to file claims
last year after it lost an analyst, says the problem is fixed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ventura County tax collector's office has started the new year
trying to fix one of last year's mistakes: its failure to file tax claims
against most of the local individuals and businesses that sought
bankruptcy in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Treasurer-Tax Collector Hal Pittman said Wednesday he realized only
last month that the practice had fallen almost entirely through the
cracks, although he knew his staff of 40 was short-handed and having
trouble keeping up with claims filings.</LD>
<LD>   Since his discovery, Pittman said, the problem has been corrected. A
collections officer has been hired to file claims on new bankruptcies.
That employee also will comb last year's filings for cases not yet
settled.</LD>
<TE>   Pittman estimated Wednesday that the county lost less than $100,000 as
a result of last year's oversight, but said it would be impossible to
pinpoint an amount.</TE>
<TE>   Those seeking bankruptcy are supposed to disclose any taxes they owe
the county when they list their creditors. As a result, Pittman said, the
county generally receives payment even if it doesn't file a claim.</TE>
<TE>   However, unsecured property, such as office equipment, is sometimes
worth only pennies on the dollar in a bankruptcy, so there is no
guarantee the county would have been able to collect all it was owed,
Pittman said.</TE>
<TE>   The recently hired collections officer will cost the county $25,000 to
$35,000 a year in salary and benefits, Pittman said. Overall, the
department took in $970 million last year.</TE>
<TE>   The oversight occurred after the department lost an analyst in late
2000 and had trouble finding a permanent replacement, Pittman said.</TE>
<TE>Schillo Points Finger at Johnston</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds real easy, 'Just fill it,' " he said. "We filled it and the
one we filled it with left. Then the backup person came up with cancer.
It's nice to second-guess people. But it's hard to do when you're in the
trenches."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Frank Schillo reacted angrily to that explanation.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't any excuse for not knowing whether you do or don't
collect taxes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than blaming Pittman, Schillo blamed County Executive Officer
Johnny Johnston for not having a good enough handle on department
staffing needs and communicating those needs to supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   As officials brace for state fiscal woes to cut into the county's
budget, Schillo said it's more important than ever for the county to
collect all the money it is owed.</TE>
<TE>   Johnston bristled at the criticism, saying he can't know what each of
7,000 county employees is or isn't doing, but that he is committed to
providing enough staff to help departments run effectively.</TE>
<TE>Advocate Puts Fault With Supervisors</TE>
<TE>   Taxpayer advocate Jere Robings, however, blamed the Board of
Supervisors, saying it should have foreseen the effects of squeezing
staffing levels in departments that generate revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "The Board of Supervisors keeps telling the tax collector's office,
'You've got to cut staff,' and then they do, and something like this
happens," Robings said.</TE>
<TE>   Robings also questioned just how big a deal the oversight was.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is whether they'll even lose the equivalent of the
[$25,000 to $35,000] salary the job takes. It's more of an embarrassment
than it is a financial catastrophe."</TE>

<HD>Deputies' Support Not Helping Lane, Mikels Says</HD>
<DH>Elections: A survey by the Ventura County supervisor indicates that
most voters don't know her opponent in the March race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most voters don't know county supervisor candidate John Lane and
don't see his backing by sheriff's deputies as a reason to vote for him,
according to a poll conducted by his opponent, incumbent Judy Mikels.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly three-quarters of likely voters in the Simi Valley-based 4th
District said they had never heard of Lane, a Moorpark fraud
investigator.</LD>
<LD>   And although Lane is touting himself as a law-and-order candidate, law
enforcement's support for him may not be enough to overcome Mikels'
considerable lead, the numbers suggest.</LD>
<TE>   Forty-one percent of respondents said they would vote for Mikels even
after they were told that the Ventura County Deputy Sheriffs' Assn. has
endorsed her challenger. Sixteen percent said they favor Lane.</TE>
<TE>   Forty-three percent said they didn't know whom they favored, but 19%
of that group said the union endorsement would not influence their
decision.</TE>
<TE>   Those numbers don't bode well for Lane, who has made rank-and-file
officers' support a centerpiece of his campaign, said John Magness,
Mikels' campaign manager.</TE>
<TE>   "The deputies are going to have to work very, very hard to get rid of
Judy," Magness said. "It's not going to be a slam-dunk."</TE>
<TE>   Lane dismissed the mid-November survey as outdated and inaccurate. He
said Mikels had previously cited poll numbers to predict victory in a
state Senate race, only to be trounced by her Republican primary rival.</TE>
<TE>Lane Doesn't Put Stock in Opponent's Numbers</TE>
<TE>   Lane has not conducted his own survey, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't put a lot of stock in Judy's polling capabilities," Lane
said. "My polling is based on the comments I am getting from the average
voter at their door, and that's been positive. She can take all the polls
she wants. But on March 5, let's see who's still standing."</TE>
<TE>   The union representing deputies has flexed its muscles in the race,
vowing to unseat Mikels, a two-term incumbent. Union members are angry
over stalled contract talks and say Mikels and other board members have
allowed the dispute to drag on for a year.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies are seeking automatic wage increases and an improved pension
that the county contends it cannot afford. The union has also endorsed
businessman Randy Hoffman over Thousand Oaks Councilwoman Linda Parks in
the contest to replace retiring Thousand Oaks Supervisor Frank Schillo.</TE>
<TE>   But most of the labor group's energy so far has been directed at
Mikels.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, union officials organized a picket at a Mikels
campaign event and circulated a letter urging voters to elect Lane. Glen
Kitzmann, president of the union, said more activities are planned,
although he declined to give specifics.</TE>
<TE>   "This doesn't change our position one bit," Kitzmann said, referring
to the poll. "She basically has ignored us, so how can you reward bad
behavior?"</TE>
<TE>   Lane, 54, a retired officer with the Los Angeles Police Department,
says Mikels should be taken to task for allowing deputies to go without a
contract for a year.</TE>
<TE>   "When you consider the stress and all the anxiety they go through and
how long they live after they retire, it's not too much to pay a little
bit more to continue to have the safety we enjoy in this county," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lane also has been endorsed by the county firefighters' union, the Los
Angeles deputy sheriffs union, several other Los Angeles police
organizations and a regional police advocacy group. Ventura County
Sheriff Bob Brooks, who has previously endorsed Mikels, said he has not
decided whether he will publicly back a candidate in either of the
supervisorial races.</TE>
<TE>   Lane said Mikels also is weak on environmental and growth issues that
are important to county residents. She has voiced support for the
3,050-home Ahmanson Ranch development at the county's southeastern border
with Los Angeles County and has favored widening rural roads over the
objection of Somis residents.</TE>
<TE>SOAR Architect, Somis Activists Back Lane</TE>
<TE>   Lane has also picked up endorsements from Save Our Somis and Richard
Francis, coauthor of the SOAR anti-sprawl initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   "People are saying they agree about slowing growth and traffic," Lane
said. "They are backing my candidacy because they believe I am a
trustworthy public servant."</TE>
<TE>   Mikels is ahead of Lane in another measure of their low-key campaign.
She has raised $66,400 so far, compared with $40,000 for Lane. Magness
said Mikels is prepared to spend as much as it takes to win.</TE>
<TE>   "Money is not a problem for us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lane, who briefly served on the Moorpark City Council in the 1980s and
ran a failed Assembly campaign in 1998, concedes he will have a tougher
time raising money than the incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   But he says he is making up for the lack of cash by hitting the

<HD>Mother, Girl Die After SUV Hits Their Car</HD>
<DH>Accident: A 2-year-old boy is also badly injured in the crash near

<LD>A Port Hueneme woman and her 4-year-old daughter were killed when
the woman's station wagon collided with a sport utility vehicle near
Camarillo early Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Georgina Karpowich, 26, was pronounced dead when California Highway
Patrol officers arrived at the scene just before 6 a.m., CHP Sgt. Douglas
Howell said.</LD>
<LD>   Her daughter, Brittany, was rushed to Cottage Hospital in Santa
Barbara, where she died Thursday evening.</LD>
<TE>   Also in the car was Karpowich's son, Eric, 2. He was also taken to
Cottage Hospital, where he is listed in serious condition in the
intensive care unit.</TE>
<TE>   The crash occurred about 5:45 a.m. at Las Posas Road and 5th Street,
in an unincorporated area between Oxnard and Camarillo surrounded by
industrial businesses and farmland.</TE>
<TE>   A Ford Explorer was heading east on 5th Street when it broadsided
Karpowich's Ford Taurus station wagon, which was heading west on 5th
Street and about to turn left onto Las Posas, CHP officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The SUV overturned and the station wagon careened into an irrigation
ditch. The Taurus' passenger side was ripped open and its windshield was
smashed.</TE>
<TE>   Debris, including children's toys and a small white shoe, was
scattered around the crash site.</TE>
<TE>   Karpowich, who CHP officers said was wearing a seat belt, died of
several injuries, according to the Ventura County medical examiner's
office.</TE>
<TE>   Both Brittany and Eric had been strapped into child-safety seats.</TE>
<TE>   The driver of the SUV, 25-year-old Ruth Laupola of Oxnard, was not
injured. Authorities are still trying to determine who was at fault and
have not cited anyone, Howell said.</TE>
<TE>   Officers closed the intersection for about four hours Thursday morning
while investigating the crash.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who witnessed the accident is asked to call the CHP at
477-4100.</TE>

<HD>Rose Bowl Fans Run Gantlet</HD>
<DH>Sports: Some people complain as tight security causes lengthy
delays. Lighter-than-  usual commuter traffic keeps cars moving.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 93,000 people braved extraordinary security and an
unusual melange of fan and commuter traffic to attend the final game of
the Bowl Championship Series at the Rose Bowl on Thursday. But despite
lengthy waits, there were no major hitches.</LD>
<LD>   It took many fans more than an hour to get from the freeways to the
parking lots and another hour to get through security at the Rose Bowl
gates. However, most of those headed for the game had heeded warnings of
delays and arrived early enough to witness the kickoff about 5:20 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the fans endured the long lines with patience, but several
complained.</LD>
<TE>   "This is ridiculous," Mary Ellen Eglseder, 50, of Omaha said as she
waited outside a stadium gate. "You'd think they never had a Rose Bowl
game before. It's all Osama bin Laden's fault."</TE>
<TE>   "It's security overkill," said Barb Macomber, 66, of Arthur, Neb. "In
Lincoln, they handle 80,000 people at every football game, and it's never
like this."</TE>
<TE>   Police examined bags and purses and patted down fans entering the
stadium for the BCS final game between the universities of Miami and
Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   Among the items confiscated were footballs, water bottles, backpacks
and umbrellas. Fans were told they could retrieve their belongings later,
but few bothered to.</TE>
<TE>   Officers searched vehicles parked in the lots immediately surrounding
the stadium in Pasadena's Arroyo Seco.</TE>
<TE>   "The interior and underneath of every vehicle in close proximity to
the Rose Bowl was searched thoroughly," said Pasadena Police Cmdr. Mary
Schander. "That meant opening the vehicle up, checking the trunk and
putting the mirrors underneath."</TE>
<TE>   Undercover officers mingled with the crowd, watching for potential
problems. Cameras mounted on the stadium rim monitored fans before,
during and after the game.</TE>
<TE>   Security was so tight that some areas were off-limits to even Rose
Bowl security guards. The stadium hired a record number of security
personnel to supplement the massive deployment of Pasadena police,
California Highway Patrol officers and federal agents.</TE>
<TE>   The game ended about 8:30 p.m., and the crowd dispersed without
incident. Thursday's game, which Miami won, 37-14, was unique in at least
two respects. It was the first BCS final game played here and the first
Rose Bowl game played on a workday.</TE>
<TE>   The unusual scheduling created a potential for traffic problems, as
fans and evening commuters tried to use the same freeways at the same
time. However, the commuter traffic was lighter than usual and, despite a
few delays, freeways kept moving.</TE>
<TE>   At the CHP traffic center in downtown Los Angeles, Officer Spencer
Ammons monitored an array of colored lights that indicate freeway traffic
flow. Green means 35 mph or faster, yellow means 20 to 35 and red means
below 20.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything near the Rose Bowl has stayed green," he reported shortly
before 6 p.m. "Usually, at this time of day, there's a lot of yellow."</TE>
<TE>   The influx of fans began early.</TE>
<TE>   By 10 a.m., vehicles splashed with the colors of Nebraska and Miami
were heading uncertainly down the Pasadena, Foothill and 134 freeways,
the out-of-town occupants scanning Caltrans signs anxiously for clues on
where the Rose Bowl is and how to get there. "Which way should we go?"
one of them shouted to a local in another car.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't get there from here," he responded without compassion.</TE>
<TE>   Hotelier Vivian Thai, manager of the Comfort Inn on Colorado Boulevard
in Eagle Rock, said all 57 rooms were booked three months in advance for
$120 to $130 apiece, about twice the usual price.</TE>
<TE>   Inflated prices also were evident at parking lots in Old Pasadena,
where many of the cognoscenti parked and took shuttle buses to avoid the
crush closer to the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   A Hastings, Neb., couple, Bob and Jean Luther, paid $30 to park their
car in a lot at Green Street and Fair Oaks Avenue, more than a mile from
the game. But with kickoff only a few hours away, the price didn't faze
them.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd pay anything to park," she said.</TE>
<TE>   There was evidence that the unprecedented, two-day gap between the
parade and the game may have calmed things a bit.</TE>
<TE>   At the Mi Piace Italian Kitchen and Bakery on Colorado Boulevard,
manager Cathy Dean said lunch business was much brisker than on a regular
Thursday, but not as hectic as on previous Rose Bowl days.</TE>
<TE>   Extra police were able to keep the traffic moving, and surface street
congestion wasn't much heavier than usual on a weekday, said Pasadena
Police Lt. Randell Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   But the most direct route to the game--along Linda Vista Avenue
between the 134 Freeway and the stadium--started clogging before noon as
fans vied for the best parking spaces on the Brookside Park golf course
surrounding much of the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The demand for parking prompted owners of some luxury homes along
Linda Vista to charge as much as $25 for a space on their lawns.</TE>
<TE>   Carolyn and Willis Falk were sorry about the score but pleased by the
sea of fellow Nebraska fans, who apparently outnumbered Miami enthusiasts
more than 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like being home in Nebraska," Carolyn Falk said. "There's
probably no one left in Lincoln."</TE>

<HD>Vanity Plates Under Fire</HD>
<DH>Drivers: Ex-Washington Redskin is told to give up the tags after a
Native American activist complains.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER Y. HONG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dale Atkeson's license plates are meant as a modest homage to his
three years as a Washington Redskin, but the Department of Motor Vehicles
says they are out of bounds.</LD>
<LD>   Atkeson, a 71-year-old Manhattan Beach resident who played for the
'Skins in the '50s, has been ordered by the DMV to surrender his
"1REDSKN" plates, which DMV policy deems offensive.</LD>
<LD>   Atkeson was fingered by a Native American activist who routinely surfs
the DMV's Web site to check for offensive plates that skirted the
bureaucracy. The activist complained, and the DMV sent Atkeson a letter
just before Christmas.</LD>
<TE>   Atkeson, a grandfather who shudders at foul language on television,
said he was stunned when told his tribute might be hurtful to others. He
wants to keep his plates--a Christmas gift from his wife, Wanda, seven
years ago--but sees himself up against an unbeatable opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what legal rights I have. The DMV is like God Almighty,"
he said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Years after Atkeson received his vanity plates, the DMV decided in
1999 to ban plates with "Redskins" or derivatives of the word. The
decision followed a complaint by Eugene Herrod on behalf of Advocates for
American Indian Children, part of the Southern California Indian Center
in Fountain Valley, according to DMV spokesman Steve Haskins.</TE>
<TE>   The DMV agreed with Herrod's complaint that a slur should not be used
on a license plate, Haskins said.</TE>
<TE>   An administrative law judge upheld the DMV policy in a February 2000
ruling after the ban was challenged by a football fan with a "REDSKIN"
vanity plate. The judge ruled the license plate was "offensive to good
taste and decency" and "carries a racist connotation."</TE>
<TE>   Herrod subsequently found Atkeson's plates on the agency's Web site.
The activist was not at the office of the Southern California Indian
Center on Thursday, a representative said.</TE>
<TE>   Atkeson, who played fullback and returned kicks for the Redskins from
1954 to 1956, was unwittingly caught in a long-running national
controversy over his old team's name. Utah was the first state to ban
"Redskins" variations on license plates, beating California by a few
months in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ruled in 2000 that the team has
no right to trademark its name because it disparages Native Americans.
The team has appealed that ruling.</TE>
<TE>   DMV spokesman Haskins said 18 plates have been found that violate the
"redskins" rule. The owners are sent a letter notifying them to turn in
their plates to a DMV office. They can propose an alternative vanity
plate, or take standard-issue plates as a replacement.</TE>
<TE>   Atkeson said he has written to the department to appeal and has not
considered possible substitutes.</TE>
<TE>   In a world with so many crude images and diatribes, Atkeson wonders
why he has been targeted. "How utterly ridiculous it is to go after my
license plate when you can turn on the television and see Howard Stern
and his filthy mouth," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Atkeson grew up in Lomita and went to USC but quickly flunked out. He
joined the Navy and honed his football skills on a base team in San Diego
before joining the Redskins via the Cleveland Browns. He said playing for
the Redskins was a treat because the team trained at Occidental College
and played an annual preseason exhibition game against the Rams at the
Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   His $7,000 salary was double what he made as a longshoreman, the job
he held in the off-season that became his career until he retired three
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Atkeson says he has seen real racism. He remembers the bigotry against
Japanese Americans during World War II, and confesses to having gotten
caught up in it. "The government brainwashed us."</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, he said, attacking the license plates on his Toyota
pickup "is really grasping at straws. But I'm not Indian," he added
sympathetically.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, he and his wife are lying low. They have yet to hear
anything about the plates on Wanda's Camry, which read "RDSKN2."</TE>

<LD>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge on Thursday granted the city's
request to temporarily block the installation of up to 25 billboards on
land owned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority until a hearing
can be held on the matter.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Dzintra I. Janavs told attorneys for the billboard company,
STI/Outdoor, to "stop everything where it is right now so we can look at
this."</LD>
<LD>   She set a Jan. 25 hearing for both sides to make arguments on whether
STI/Outdoor should be permanently blocked from installing the billboards
along some of the county's most heavily traveled freeways.</LD>
<TE>   The court action Thursday halted, at least for now, work that has
become the latest test of wills between local government and the
billboard industry. Faced with community complaints about blight, city
officials are seeking to restrain the spread of billboards, while the
companies that make them are waging a spirited campaign to expand their
presence.</TE>
<TE>   In the current case, Los Angeles officials have accused STI/Outdoor of
violating a contract that gave the company permission to put up 41
billboards and 10 kiosks on MTA property in Southern California in
exchange for the installation of toilets in MTA facilities and a share of
billboard profits of at least $23 million.</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement, officials said, the billboard company was
required to receive city approval before installing the giant signboards
along freeways.</TE>
<TE>   The state Legislature also weighed in on the matter last year.
Lawmakers backed legislation by state Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los
Angeles) that required billboard companies to obtain the necessary local
permits before building on MTA property. That law took effect Tuesday,
just hours after the billboard company started construction on the new
signs.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the company said Thursday that STI/Outdoor officials
acted within the provisions of the contract with the MTA.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe we will succeed on the merits when the matter is heard in a
couple of weeks," said attorney Ellen Berkowitz, a partner with the firm
of Manatt, Phelps &amp; Phillips. "We have a valid contract with the MTA and
the project is . . . exempt from local regulation. . . . The city does
not have the right to require that we get local permits."</TE>
<TE>   Billboards have become a major point of controversy in Los Angeles.
The proliferation of the signs has drawn the interest of city officials
interested in controlling their spread. Last spring, the City Council
issued a moratorium on new billboard permits to give officials time to
come up with new restrictions to help reduce visual blight and put teeth
into efforts to remove illegal signs.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, city officials say, they are determined to stop
STI/Outdoor, a joint venture with Viacom subsidiary Outdoor Systems, from
moving forward with plans to finish the giant signboards. Those signs are
slated to be put up in the central Los Angeles area and the San Fernando
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   After learning of the firm's action on Tuesday, the city filed a civil
complaint--which could result in monetary damages--alleging that the
billboards are a nuisance and represent unfair business practices.</TE>
<TE>   "Behind us stands an illegal billboard that Viacom tried to erect in
the shadows, over the holidays when they thought no one was looking,"
City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo said during a news conference near an MTA bus
depot at 16th and San Pedro streets, where a barrel-sized steel billboard
post had been partially constructed.</TE>
<TE>   "These illegal tactics will not stand," he added. "We will do
everything in our power to tear down these billboards and make this
company pay for its actions."</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who serves on the MTA board, echoed
Delgadillo's concerns at the news conference.</TE>
<TE>   "They had a deal, a legally binding deal, that in exchange for their
right to put up billboards, they had to first get the permission of the
local jurisdiction where the billboard was going to be erected,"
Yaroslavsky said.</TE>
<TE>   "They knowingly tried to breach and did breach a contract. So, aside
from the restraining order . . . they now find themselves, in the opinion
of the MTA and its lawyers, in breach of contract."</TE>

<HD>A Walk on the Beach Is No Stroll in the Park</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE LOPEZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They say it's supposed to warm up over the weekend, so I thought I
might stroll the beach in Malibu. Unfortunately, I haven't heard back yet
from David Geffen to see if I can dash through his front door and out the
back, which is one of the only ways to get onto the lovely three-mile
stretch of public sand and sea I had in mind.</LD>
<LD>   That's right. Starting at Moonshadows, up past Duke's, and nearly all
the way to the Malibu Pier, there's no way to get onto the beach, unless
maybe you know that knucklehead Dennis Rodman, who has been known to make
helicopter landings near his beach compound way down the road in Newport
Beach.</LD>
<LD>   So I called DreamWorks to see if Geffen, an unabashed liberal
do-gooder, might lend a beach pass to a member of the hoi polloi.</LD>
<TE>   I left messages for Jeffrey Katzenberg too, a beachfront neighbor of
Geffen's, and for Steven Spielberg, who has a beach bungalow just up the
street. (Please don't confuse this with Spielberg's "in-town" Brentwood
spread, where neighbors were aghast at his proposal to build a domed,
five-story riding stable).</TE>
<TE>   So what do you say, SKG? I'll just bring a couple of beach chairs, a
body board and a few friends. We'll be in the front and out the back in
less time than "Artificial Intelligence" hung around the theaters.</TE>
<TE>   I'd gladly use the public easement next door to Geffen's compound, but
it's been locked for years. In fact, several such public pathways are
blocked, as my colleague Ken Weiss noted in Sunday's Times.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, government agencies have done next to nothing to open
those gates. That's partly because they don't want the expense of
managing them, and partly because the rich and powerful, many of them
movie stars, have used clout, cash and lawyers to keep them closed.</TE>
<TE>   I drove and walked that stretch of Malibu the other day and saw
nothing but padlocks, barbed wire and signs that say, "Keep Out" or "No
Parking." You can barely even see the ocean from Pacific Coast Highway,
let alone put your feet in the sand, thanks to those cheek-to-jowl box
structures that constitute some of the worst public planning on record.</TE>
<TE>   Worst, that is, if you don't count the fact that Malibu resisted a
modern sewage system as a means of limiting growth, even as evidence
mounted that the septic tanks of the rich and famous were fouling Santa
Monica Bay.</TE>
<TE>   "The most stunning thing is that a lot of the people who own those
houses only come to Malibu occasionally," says Steve Hoye, an open-beach
proponent. "But whether they're there or not, they don't want anybody on
the beach."</TE>
<TE>   It's not a bad deal. You carp and moan to keep public beaches private,
but then scream for public assistance every time there's a mudslide or
brush fire.</TE>
<TE>   Former MGM boss Frank Mancuso and a Malibu neighbor have demonstrated
unparalleled leadership in the campaign to keep out the riff-raff. They
offered to subsidize a program that would bus kids to other beaches in
return for the permanent bolting of the beach path between their homes.
If there's a Malibu Spirit Award, they're the winners.</TE>
<TE>   Then you've got the industrious trio of Eli Broad and former Mayor
Dick Riordan's wife, along with TV mogul Haim Saban, who found a way
around a size restriction and erected sprawling mansions. Their trick was
to buy and donate a beach, half a mile away, for use by the great
unwashed.</TE>
<TE>   This naturally caused the blood to drain from the faces of those who
live near the donated beach. So far, they've blocked the opening of the
beach in a nasty little scrum that pits Malibu millionaires against
Malibu billionaires.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't argue against access; I argue against unreasonable and
inappropriate access," says Jodi Siegler, one of those who wants the
lovely chain-link fence to stay where it is.</TE>
<TE>   There's nowhere to park, Siegler says, and there are plenty of beaches
nearby, like Will Rogers. Besides, she adds, the state ought to fix the
Malibu Pier and develop other, more accessible beaches before it sends
people dashing across PCH and between people's homes.</TE>
<TE>   I can certainly understand Siegler's take, but it just doesn't hold up
under the lights.</TE>
<TE>   First of all, if you buy a house on a spectacular beach at the edge of
a gargantuan metropolis, you ought to expect that someone might like to
have a swim now and then. But for the very access reasons Siegler cites,
the beaches near her house are not going to be overrun, so why the big
nervous breakdown?</TE>
<TE>   Second and more important, private citizens, no matter how precious or
exclusive their spreads, don't get to wear a badge and tell the rest of
us which beaches are open and which are closed.</TE>
<TE>   "Development shall not interfere with the public's right of access to
the sea," says the California Coastal Act, which voters embraced 30 years
ago. I don't see much gray in the wording.</TE>
<TE>   On top of that, many Malibu beach dwellers were allowed to build or
modify their homes only in return for guaranteeing public access.</TE>
<TE>   I'm tempted to call Barbra Streisand next. She's another of Malibu's
self-congratulatory liberals, so maybe Miss Do-Gooder will put on a
charity concert to liberate public beaches. (As you read this, several
private groups are plotting to take over the public-access easements and
throw open the gates.)</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line is that you can't buy a waterfront house in this state
and tell everyone to keep off the beach any more than you can buy the
Ahwahnee Hotel and tell everyone to stay out of Yosemite.</TE>
<TE>   "The beaches of California," says Malibu resident and Coastal
Commission Chairwoman Sara Wan, "are owned by the public."</TE>
<TE>   Throw a couple of hot dogs on the barbecue, David. I'll be over around
noon Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Ontario Scrambles for Visit by President</HD>
<DH>Politics: The state Senate's Republican leader, GOP donors lobbied
for Bush's appearance Saturday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Wednesday, Ontario Chamber of Commerce President Robert L.
Traister was asked what he thought about the president's upcoming visit.
His response: "Which president?"</LD>
<LD>   By Thursday morning, he was helping to coordinate the town hall-style
meeting President Bush will hold Saturday morning at Ontario Convention
Center.</LD>
<LD>   "I got here this morning, and everybody in the office said: 'You've
got to bail us out. The phones are ringing off the hook,' " Traister said
Thursday. "It has been fast and furious."</LD>
<TE>   As the White House and local officials launched the inexact but
strategic construction of an audience--one that will be packed with
Latino business leaders--organizers were quick to note that the event is
nonpartisan. But the distribution of many tickets was organized by Bush
supporters, and most tickets were spoken for before they had arrived.</TE>
<TE>   As many as 5,000 people are expected, White House officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was in one hand and out the other," said Norm MacKenzie, executive
director of the Rancho Cucamonga Chamber of Commerce, one of the business
groups charged with distributing tickets. "If you had some scalpers out
there, they could make a lot of money."</TE>
<TE>   Local officials and political insiders, including those who are
arranging the visit, say the event is an exercise in symbiosis.</TE>
<TE>   More than he has in other town hall meetings, Bush plans to focus the
discussion on job creation and economic development. The Inland Empire,
largely because of its sustained and explosive growth, appears relatively
insulated from the recession, said John Husing, the area's leading
economist, who briefed White House aides on the inland region recently in
anticipation of the event.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the region's insulation is because of the growth of small
businesses, especially Latino-owned enterprises. Those business owners,
many of whom would benefit from the president's tax proposals, received
the bulk of the tickets made available Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The event, meanwhile, will allow Bush to reaffirm his long-standing
relationship with Latinos, an affiliation that provided him an enormous
boost in Texas and helped propel him to the national stage.</TE>
<TE>   The Inland Empire has one of the nation's fastest-growing Latino
communities, state Senate Republican Leader Jim Brulte said Thursday. And
it is home to more than 30,000 Latino-owned businesses, ranking sixth
among the nation's metropolitan areas, Husing said. Those businesses,
although most are very small, collect more than $5 billion in sales each
year, Husing said.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the elements Bush has picked up on," said Ruth Lopez
Williams, the owner of a home health agency in El Monte and chairwoman of
the Latin Business Assn. The Los Angeles-based group received 700 tickets
Thursday in exchange for its sponsorship--which entailed writing a
$10,000 check to the Convention Center to defray the estimated $60,000
cost of playing host to the president.</TE>
<TE>   Williams sees political value in Bush's overture to Latinos in
California. He's being very strategic and he's being very wise," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials say the visit is no more targeted than if Bush
had closed his eyes and placed his finger on a map.</TE>
<TE>   "The president travels all over the country talking about matters
important to the people of the United States," White House spokesman Ken
Lisaius said Thursday. "He'll hit the West Coast when he can, and that's
what he's doing on this trip."</TE>
<TE>   The White House would be hard-pressed to police the attendance at a
large public event like this one. What's more, officials say, the White
House was less concerned about controlling the audience for this town
hall meeting than it has been for other such occasions, simply because
the president is enjoying very high approval ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Still, while there is an element of spontaneity, the president's town
hall functions are designed to seat him in front of a friendly crowd. So
the White House sets a tone, those involved in the process said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   That began with the choice of a region considered fairly conservative,
but still an important site of swing votes, mostly among transplants from
Los Angeles and Orange counties whose political beliefs are more moderate
than those of their liberal or conservative parents. And it continued in
the distribution of blocks of tickets through business organizations and
chambers of commerce whose members, by and large, support the White
House.</TE>
<TE>   For example, distribution of one batch of tickets was coordinated
through the office of Hector V. Barreto Jr., the Los Angeles businessman
Bush named to head the Small Business Administration, Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea that the president is coming to the Inland Empire, we're all
proud of it," MacKenzie said. "He's putting us on the map. We're an
economic area that people should be taking note of. But obviously, this
business community, they all support the Republican thought process."</TE>
<TE>   That thought process can be traced in large part to one man: Sen.
Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga, one of three people who were instrumental in
setting Saturday's event in motion.</TE>
<TE>   Brulte was a presidential aide when Bush's father was in the White
House. He has had a relationship with the family ever since, and is
considered the president's "political brains" in California, Bush's
senior White House political advisor, Karl Rove, has said.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Brulte met in Washington with Rove. Told that Bush was
planning a trip to California, Brulte suggested that the president use
Brulte's home turf--Ontario, seven miles southwest of his district
offices in Rancho Cucamonga.</TE>
<TE>   Back home, Brulte worked to seal the deal with several elected
officials and business leaders, primarily a father-son team who are among
the region's leading Republican donors.</TE>
<TE>   They are Ted Dutton, a wealthy GOP activist, and his son, Bob Dutton,
a Rancho Cucamonga city councilman and the founder of a real estate
investment management firm who is running for a state Assembly seat.</TE>
<TE>   According to campaign finance documents reviewed Thursday, the Duttons
have given dozens of donations to GOP groups and affiliates in recent
years, including Bush, former Gov. Pete Wilson and Brulte.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been very, very active in politics for a long time," Ted Dutton
said Thursday. "When the occasion came up, we felt the Inland Empire was
a central place in California that was fairly easy to get to and had a
lot of impact for all of Southern California."</TE>

<HD>Angelides: Refinance to Trim Deficit</HD>
<DH>Budget: Treasurer says switch to variable-rate bonds could save the
state a quick $1 billion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>State Treasurer Phil Angelides proposed a plan Thursday to knock
more than $1 billion off a projected $12-billion state budget deficit by
taking advantage of low interest rates to refinance the state's debt.</LD>
<LD>   Under the restructuring plan, the state's bond payments would be
minimized by deferring principal payments for four years and by switching
from fixed-rate to variable-rate bonds, which have proven cheaper in
recent years.</LD>
<LD>   The plan would require the state to make larger payments beginning in
2008-09, but using variable-rate bonds is expected to save taxpayers
about $181 million on $26 billion worth of general obligation bonds
through 2033-34.</LD>
<TE>   Angelides predicted the plan would save the state from having to make
about $1.1 billion in payments over the next 18 months, when California
is expected to face a $12-billion budget deficit. Keeping the money in
the general fund could minimize the need for deep cuts to schools and
public health and safety, he added.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal would free up another $964 million in the 2003-04 fiscal
year.</TE>
<TE>   Angelides said fixed-rate bonds have recently come in at a little more
than 5%, while the constantly changing variable rate has been around 2%
or less. If the variable rate were to suddenly shoot up, Angelides said,
the state could switch back to fixed-rate bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Angelides said he plans to use variable-rate bonds and delay principal
payments on both the anticipated sale of bonds between now and June 2004
and certain existing debt scheduled to be repaid during the same period.</TE>
<TE>   The plan, he added, will require approval from a variety of state
finance committees established to authorize the bonds, all of which
include Angelides as a member.</TE>
<TE>   As of last January, California owed $19.3 billion on general
obligation bonds, with principal and debt service payments estimated at
$2.6 billion for the current fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes good sense to refinance when interest rates are at a
historic low," Gov. Gray Davis said when asked about Angelides' proposal
Thursday during an appearance in Los Angeles. "It could ease some of the
budget pressure we're going to be facing this year and next."</TE>
<TE>   State finance officials declined to comment on the specifics of
Angelides' proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "We're certainly exploring the concept of organizing our debt service
obligations in the most economical way as part of the larger budget
solution," said Sandy Harrison, spokesman for the state Department of
Finance.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds like a win-win situation to me," added Assemblyman Tony
Cardenas (D-Panorama City), chairman of the Assembly Budget Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman John Campbell, the Irvine Republican who serves as vice
chairman of the Assembly Budget Committee, said: "Some restructuring of
debt could make some sense. I'm not sure this is it. It depends on the
structure of the whole budget solution. It can't all just be accounting
tricks and throwing more debt at the problem."</TE>
<TE>   While Angelides pushes to restructure the state's debt as a way to
ease the budget crunch, a far more significant effort to relieve the
state's fiscal problems--selling $12.5 billion in bonds to recover the
costs incurred in the energy crisis--remains stalled.</TE>
<TE>   To avoid blackouts, California spent more than $6 billion last year
buying electricity for the state's private utilities, which were too
saddled with debt to continue supplying their customers. The state was
supposed to recover those costs through the bonds under a plan approved
nearly a year ago by Davis and state lawmakers. Utility ratepayers were
then supposed to pay off the bonds as part of their electricity bills.</TE>
<TE>   However, the bonds, which Angelides initially predicted he would sell
as early as last May, have yet to go to market, leaving a massive hole in
the budget. If the budget is not repaid for the energy costs by this
summer, the projected budget deficit will swell to $18 billion.</TE>
<TE>   A political dispute over how to handle the overall costs of the crisis
has prevented Angelides from selling the bonds. Angelides indicated
Thursday that negotiations to resolve the dispute may yield results in
coming days, but said it is unclear whether he would be able to complete
the bond sale by this summer.</TE>

<DH>Courts: Prosecutors' decision means Valencia man, 44, will be sent
to prison for life without parole for killing his parents.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors in Northern California dropped plans Thursday to seek
the death penalty against a Valencia man convicted of killing his elderly
parents over a $30,000 loan.</LD>
<LD>   Testimony in the penalty phase of Jeffrey Lee Duvardo's murder trial
was scheduled to begin next Tuesday in Lake County Court, about 90 miles
north of San Francisco. But Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Jon Hopkins said he
and other county law enforcement officials decided against the death
penalty.</LD>
<LD>   "In this case, the only factor in support of the death penalty is the
circumstances of the crime," Hopkins said of the decision, which means
Duvardo, 44, will be sentenced to state prison for life without the
possibility of parole.</LD>
<TE>   Hopkins said none of the jurors disagreed with the decision, and they
told him they would not have sentenced Duvardo to death because evidence
showed he committed the crime under mental duress and he did not have a
prior criminal record.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Stephen Tulanian, who maintained his client's
innocence, said he had mixed emotions. "That's better than death, I
suppose. But I don't feel good about any part of this case."</TE>
<TE>   The seven-man, five-woman jury convicted Duvardo last month of
first-degree murder in the 1999 slayings of Don and Mary Ann Duvardo in
their Nice, Calif., retirement home.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, Hopkins introduced a sample from a blood-stained
towel found in the couple's home that tests showed contained Duvardo's
DNA. Rental car records presented by the prosecutor showed Duvardo had
driven more than 1,100 miles on the day the couple were killed. The
distance was enough to get from Southern California to Nice and back.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Hopkins said, Duvardo killed his parents over a loan. The
former Boeing employee, who had twice tried unsuccessfully for a career
as a police officer, allegedly told his parents he was a CIA operative
who would be killed if he did not come up with the money to complete a
multimillion-dollar arms deal.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Duvardo turned on his parents when they began asking
about their $30,000 loan. Prosecutors said he had used the money as a
down payment on an upscale home near San Francisquito Canyon for his
second wife.</TE>
<TE>   A neighbor found the Duvardos' bodies six days after they were killed.
Mary Ann Duvardo, 70, was attacked from behind as she sat at a desk. Her
throat was slashed and she was stabbed in the head several times.</TE>
<TE>   Don Duvardo, 76, was stabbed 15 times in the chest as he entered the
house. His hands were cut to the bone, a sign that he fought for his
life, investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   Duvardo is scheduled to be formally sentenced April 4.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Zoo Anticipates Swift Renewal of Accreditation</HD>
<DH>Animals: As the site is inspected, the director cites improvements
and voices confidence that the previous review's problems will be
avoided.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A team of experts is inspecting the Los Angeles Zoo this week in an
appearance that local officials hope will lead to reaccreditation without
the criticism and delays that marked the last such visit in 1995.</LD>
<LD>   Last time the American Zoo and Aquarium Assn. postponed by one year
the granting of a five-year accreditation renewal, citing deficiencies in
animal care. That term of accreditation expired in September.</LD>
<LD>   Zoo Director Manuel A. Mollinedo said he expects the result to be more
favorable when he appears at a March evaluation session by the group in
Wichita, Kan.</LD>
<TE>   The inspection team held an information session Thursday for the zoo
staff, but declined to comment on its findings so far during its
three-day visit.</TE>
<TE>   The zoo, which is subsidized by the city and also raises money
privately to support its operations, draws about 1.5 million visitors a
year. Admission to the zoo, in Griffith Park, is $8.25 for adults and
$3.25 for children ages 2 to 12.</TE>
<TE>   Louisville Zoo Director William Foster, leader of the inspection team,
said that only 201 of 2,300 facilities in the United States that display
or raise wild animals are accredited and that an ultimate goal of the
American Zoo and Aquarium Assn. is "to see nonaccredited facilities go
out of business."</TE>
<TE>   The inspection team also includes San Antonio Zoo Director Steve
McCusker and Terrie Correll, curator of the Living Desert in Palm Desert.</TE>
<TE>   The inspectors said they will delve into every aspect of the Los
Angeles Zoo's performance while here and, after questioning Mollinedo at
the Wichita meeting, will file a written report. An accreditation
decision will be made at that meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Among the matters to be considered are the condition of the zoo's
animal collection, veterinary care, physical facilities, safety,
security, finance, staff, governing authority, support organization,
involvement in education, conservation and research, and adherence to
association policies.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, accreditation was delayed for a year after inspectors
complained of bureaucratic problems and conditions so bad at the zoo that
the animals' health was in jeopardy.</TE>
<TE>   The findings echoed criticism in the 1980s by federal inspectors, who
found inadequate food storage, poor sanitation, drainage problems, vermin
infestations and substandard housing for animals.</TE>
<TE>   Mollinedo took charge of the zoo after the previous director resigned
under fire in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, he said he does not expect a "perfect" report this time,
but he is confident that the zoo will be found to have made considerable
improvements since the last accreditation.</TE>
<TE>   The zoo has constructed a new animal health center since 1995, a
matter of criticism in the delayed accreditation, and has undertaken
chimpanzee and red ape master plan projects.</TE>
<TE>   It has also upgraded numerous exhibits, improved the infrastructure
and installed perimeter fencing, among other improvements.</TE>
<TE>   The zoo's 230 full-time city employees recently received a salary
increase, although a workers representative, captive wildlife specialist
David Reames, said Thursday that some management-labor relations problems
remain.</TE>
<TE>   The zoo received much publicity last year when a Komodo dragon
severely bit a toe of Phil Bronstein, editor of the San Francisco
Chronicle, when zookeepers allowed Bronstein, the husband of actress
Sharon Stone, into the huge lizard's enclosure.</TE>
<TE>   Mollinedo reiterated Thursday that the Bronstein visit had been
mishandled and that letting the journalist into the enclosure was a
mistake that would not be repeated.</TE>
<TE>   Foster said accreditation is either "tabled" for a year, as occurred
with the Los Angeles Zoo in 1995, or denied in about 5% to 10% of cases.</TE>
<TE>   Among facilities that have been denied accreditation is the Santa Ana
Zoo, which lost its accreditation in September 2000 over infrastructure
problems.</TE>
<TE>   The zoo has completed a $1.5-million renovation and may be
reaccredited after a national inspection team visits next week, Santa Ana
Zoo officials said Thursday.</TE>

<HD>Sheriff Pulls Out of Debate</HD>
<DH>Election: Baca thought he was invited to an endorsement interview,
not a candidates forum. Opponents say he is ducking questions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca has pulled out of the only
scheduled debate before the March election, leaving his two
opponents--Sgts. Patrick Gomez and John Stites--challenging their boss to
future forums.</LD>
<LD>   Baca's campaign manager, Parke Skelton, said the sheriff was under the
impression that he had been invited by the Los Angeles County
Professional Peace Officers Assn. to a one-on-one endorsement
interview--not a forum with his challengers.</LD>
<LD>   "He was willing to be interviewed," Skelton said.</LD>
<TE>   "But when it was changed into a public debate, it didn't feel
appropriate. It would warp the issues as they came up" if the
conversation were public and the others were present.</TE>
<TE>   But Roger Mayberry, president of the peace officers group, said he had
lunch with Baca and explained the format to him.</TE>
<TE>   The members planned to ask the three candidates questions and later
were to recommend an endorsement to the peace officers' board of
directors.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe it was explained to him very well," Mayberry said, adding
that his group has long had a solid relationship with the sheriff.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel it's important for him to come. I'm hoping he'll change his
mind."</TE>
<TE>   Gomez and Stites, who hope to unseat their boss March 5, say that they
will call for more debates, but that they believe Baca does not want to
face questions about his leadership or integrity.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the bottom line is that he really doesn't care about the
people in the department and their concerns. There are so many questions
they will ask," said Gomez, who ran against Baca and then-Sheriff Sherman
Block four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Baca won that race after Block died shortly before election day.</TE>
<TE>   Stites, who ran unsuccessfully against Block and several others in
1994, said Tuesday's scheduled forum was intended to offer the candidates
a chance to present their issues to members of the peace officers group.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said, Baca "will be asked again and again to come out and
speak. People like to see the exchange."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors said Thursday that they will seek to try a 15-year-old
reputed Pomona gang member as an adult, and filed double-murder charges
against him in the deaths of a young man and a widowed mother of three.</LD>
<LD>   The suspect, who was not identified, is expected to appear at a
hearing today in Pomona Juvenile Court.</LD>
<LD>   He was arrested Wednesday after a Pomona police officer recognized him
as one of two suspects in the Dec. 15 killings of Jose Yanez, 19, and
Carmen Leautaud, 53, in an alley near Angela Street. The boy also faces
an attempted murder charge involving a male who escaped the shooting
unharmed.</LD>
<TE>   Leautaud, a Pomona resident who worked at a local gym with her
daughter, was struck by a stray bullet apparently intended for Yanez.
Police said the suspects believed that Yanez was a tagger with whom their
gang had a dispute.</TE>

<HD>Man Held in Death of Boy Hit by Gunfire as He Slept</HD>
<DH>Violence: Harry Hines is recalled as a typical 12-year-old. He was
killed when a bullet pierced the wall of his bedroom.</DH>

<LD>Wanda Hines wept Thursday as LAPD officers recounted the night she
crawled to her son's bedroom to find that he had been shot, the victim of
an errant bullet.</LD>
<LD>   Twelve-year-old Harry Hines, known to family as "Mookie," was asleep
in his bedroom in the 1700 block of South La Brea Avenue on Nov. 25 when
a bullet pierced the wall and hit him in the neck.</LD>
<LD>   At a news conference Thursday, officers announced the arrest of Hines'
suspected killer, 27-year-old Ricardo Ernesto Mejia, on Dec. 27.</LD>
<TE>   The gang member for whom the bullets were intended fled, said Capt.
Kirk Albanese, adding that information from witnesses led to Mejia's
arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Wanda Hines, 42, smiled as she described her son. She called him a
happy-go-lucky child who enjoyed a 12-year-old's typical diversions.</TE>
<TE>   "He loved baseball, basketball," she said. "He loved girls."</TE>
<TE>   Hines, who has two other children, said she always feared for their
safety.</TE>
<TE>   On that day, she said, she and Harry had watched a movie, and a friend
of Harry's had come over. When the friend went home, Harry played
Nintendo into the night, falling asleep on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   About 1 a.m., his mother heard gunshots and went to his room.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Mookie, get up,' " Hines said. "He turned, and I saw blood."</TE>
<TE>   Harry died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center a short time later.</TE>
<TE>   Mejia has been charged with murder, criminal gang activity and assault
with a deadly weapon. He pleaded not guilty at his arraignment Monday,
and his preliminary hearing is scheduled for Jan. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate, to say the least, that a child can't be asleep in
his home without being shot" by gangs, Albanese said. The death "should
clearly shock the conscience of anyone that hears about it."</TE>
<TE>   Wanda Hines said she is not sure if she has any words for the
suspected killer.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say," she answered calmly. "I'll have to see when we get to
court."</TE>

<HD>Conceptual Artist's Cup Runneth Over With Creation Using 14,000
Bras</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HARVEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I must offer a word in defense of Nicolino, the conceptual artist
who constructed San Francisco's "Bra Ball." That, as you doubtless know,
is an installation of 14,000 bras weighing nearly 1,200 pounds.</LD>
<LD>   Emily Duffy, a rival artist, was quoted in Parade magazine as saying
that Nicolino had stolen her idea, pointing out that she had unveiled her
own (slightly smaller) "Bra Ball" earlier in the year in Oakland.</LD>
<LD>   Well, all I know is that a decade ago, Nicolino stopped in L.A. and
several other cities during a whistle-stop train tour in search of
discarded bras.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, his dream at that time was to stretch them across the Grand
Canyon--his statement on "breast obsession in our culture."</TE>
<TE>   Grand Canyon authorities said no, whereupon this column's ever-helpful
readers suggested several alternate plans, including a bra bridge across
the Los Angeles River.</TE>
<TE>   But Nicolino had a new vision: "Statue of Liberty Barbie," a
12-foot-high sculpture of bras in the shape of the famous lass.</TE>
<TE>   I don't think Liberty Barbie was ever built; Mattel, Barbie's El
Segundo parent, declined to endorse the project.</TE>
<TE>   I lost track of Nicolino after that, but the point I'm making is that
his interest in bras is certainly nothing new.</TE>
<TE>   Dog daze: Surely the machines that Walter Johnson of Long Beach
observed in the back of a truck are unrelated to the driver's business,
right? (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Don't know much about geography: One wonders whether a massive
earthquake displaced several cities, judging from the Office Depot map
spotted by Charles Vorsanger of Pasadena (see accompanying). I'm going to
miss Signal Hill, but I wish it the best of luck in its new home up
north. I also congratulate Phoenix on landing the Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   As we bid goodbye to 2001: The Seal Beach Sun published some of its
more unusual police blotter items, including these:</TE>
<TE>   * "A man called the police to ask if it was OK to walk on the pier
while he was having 'moronic thoughts.' "</TE>
<TE>   * "Three people with guns were detained by security" until it was
determined that they were history buffs "trying to re-create the Battle
of Gettysburg."</TE>
<TE>   * "A man brought a desk, chair and phone and sat in the street. He
claimed he was an artist with poetic license."</TE>
<TE>   * "A customer found $40 at the bank. She returned the money but later
called the police saying she wanted it back." An, uh, unrealistic
thought.</TE>
<TE>   More old business: I'm still hearing from readers who've found strange
car names. Jim Kessell points out that Toyota's Cressida takes its name
from the Trojan woman of medieval legend who was unfaithful to her lover,
Troilus.</TE>
<TE>   So can you trust a Cressida car?</TE>
<TE>   Linda Whelan can't figure out where Subaru came up with the Justy.</TE>
<TE>   I couldn't find it in medieval literature or anywhere else, but Justy
sort of has the creepy ring of a prison worker.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of creepy, Julie Towery wants the dumb-name competition
opened up so she can include a motor home: the Damon Intruder.</TE>
<TE>miscelLAny:</TE>
<TE>   Numerous UCLA football fans--I didn't realize there were that many
left--wrote to correct my assertion that their team lost its last four
games.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, UCLA lost only four of its final five games.</TE>
<TE>   The late Times columnist Jack Smith used to allow himself three
mistakes per year, as I recall. Here it is only Jan. 4, and I'm down to
my last two.</TE>

<LD>Long Beach residents can recycle their Christmas trees into garden
mulch Saturday at the city operations yard. Even the treeless can take
home mulch, which is free.</LD>
<LD>   Residents who want to dispose of their holiday trees can bring them to
the yard, 2929 E. Willow St., between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. and watch them
converted into mulch.</LD>
<LD>   Reusable containers are required for the mulch, which the Long Beach
Environmental Services Bureau says is useful in gardens to discourage
weeds and water runoff.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of local officials, including former Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan, joined Hollywood residents Thursday for the
groundbreaking of the Gateway to Hollywood project, which will feature a
30-foot-high glass tower and a large fountain on the median where
Franklin and Wilcox avenues meet Cahuenga Boulevard.</LD>
<LD>   The word "Hollywood" will run down the tower's three sides and is
intended to be a beacon' to motorists entering the area from the Cahuenga
offramp of the Hollywood Freeway, said Merle Singer, president of the
Yucca Corridor Coalition. The project, which includes new benches and
plantings, is expected to be completed by July.</LD>
<LD>   Riordan praised the $658,000 project, saying it was another sign of
Hollywood's resurgence. Councilmen Tom LaBonge and Eric Garcetti and
county Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky also praised the gateway and Singer's
leadership in pushing for it.</LD>

<HD>Complaint Is Filed Over Supervisors' Boundaries</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Minority activists filed a complaint Thursday with the federal
government charging that the county's supervisorial districts
discriminate against minorities.</LD>
<LD>   County officials barely altered the five districts' lines when they
redrew them last summer to balance their populations. They insist that
they complied with civil rights laws.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to the Department of Justice, Alan Clayton, a demographer
for the Los Angeles County Employees Assn., lays out a proposal for new
districts, including one that would cover the entire San Gabriel Valley,
which is currently divided among three supervisors.</LD>
<TE>   Clayton is asking the Justice Department to sue the county for
violating the federal Voting Rights Act, as the agency successfully did
in the 1980s. That action resulted in the drawing of a new
Latino-majority district, which is represented by Supervisor Gloria
Molina.</TE>
<TE>   "If this case fails, it's basically the status quo for the next 12
years," Clayton said. "If it succeeds, it'll change the way the county
does business."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An illegal immigrant arrested in October for mailing an anthrax
threat to Long Beach City Hall as a joke will be turned over to the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service for deportation to Mexico, a
federal judge ruled Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   In sentencing Justo Saldana, a 33-year-old hospital aide, to time
already spent behind bars, U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian said the
hoax "scared a lot of people" and required Long Beach to spend more than
$22,000 in its emergency response.</LD>
<LD>   Saldana, who lived in Long Beach, admitted mailing the city an
envelope containing talcum powder and a note in Spanish that stated, "To
whom it may concern. Joke."</LD>
<TE>   The envelope bore a return address belonging to a man with whom
Saldana had quarreled. Saldana told detectives when he was arrested Oct.
26 that he wanted to get the other man in trouble. Last month, Saldana
pleaded guilty to a federal charge of mailing a threatening
communication.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A pro-freeway group from the San Gabriel Valley filed a motion
Thursday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, asking for dismissal of a
lawsuit that challenges the proposed Long Beach Freeway extension.</LD>
<LD>   Bonifacio Bonny Garcia, the group's attorney, said an injunction
against planning the extension through El Sereno, South Pasadena and
Pasadena has meant that Alhambra and other cities see 100,000 cars dumped
onto surface streets daily because of the freeway gap between the San
Bernardino and Foothill freeways.</LD>
<LD>   The 34 individuals, mostly elected officials, and the city of Alhambra
want to throw out a 7-year-old anti-freeway lawsuit that the El Sereno
Neighborhood Action Committee filed against the California Department of
Transportation.</LD>
<TE>   Another anti-freeway lawsuit by the city of South Pasadena is pending.</TE>

<HD>Improper Stunt Led to 2000 Air Show Death</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two days before the 27th annual Pomona Valley Air Fair at Cable
Airport, the National Transportation Safety Board released a report
saying that a pilot killed during the fair two years ago was performing
an unapproved stunt.</LD>
<LD>   Mark Steven Madden, 40, died Jan. 8, 2000, when his experimental plane
crashed into a rock quarry. No one else was injured.</LD>
<LD>   The report released Thursday said Madden could not recover from
attempting a "squirrel cage maneuver," in which three pilots take turns
doing stunts in the same airspace. It was not part of his normal routine,
and his aerobatic examiner had not been notified of the attempt.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators viewed a video of the exercise in making their findings.</TE>
<TE>   "It just spun right into the ground," said air fair spokesman Gary
Hart, who witnessed the crash. "I kept waiting for it to come out, but it
didn't. Then smoke came up. . . . Terrible feeling."</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the crash, Madden held the world record for the most
flat spins, spinning a level plane 87 times like a turntable while
falling from 16,000 feet to 2,000 feet.</TE>
<TE>   His death was the first in the history of the air fair.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers have set up a pilot training scholarship fund for
low-income youths in the flier's memory.</TE>

<HD>Vandals Use Axes to Damage 2 Schools in Orange County</HD>
<DH>Destruction: Windows, lockers, fountains and light fixtures are
battered at the Capistrano Unified campuses, as the toll tops $50,000.
Three teenage suspects are arrested.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vandals rampaged through two Orange County schools late Wednesday,
causing the worst damage in Capistrano Unified School District history.</LD>
<LD>   The destruction began about 9:30 p.m. when someone broke into a tool
shed at Capistrano Valley High School, stole two axes and other tools,
and then went to work tearing up Del Obispo Elementary School and Marco
Forster Middle School. Damage totaled more than $50,000, authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   Three suspects were arrested by Orange County sheriff's deputies about
midnight, an hour after residents in the neighborhood around Marco
Forster reported hearing gunshots.</LD>
<TE>   Booked on suspicion of felony vandalism were Daniel J. Kenway, 18, a
Dana Hills High School student; Robert DeLuca, 19, a Capistrano Valley
High graduate; and a 17-year-old student at Dana Hills whose name was
withheld. All three were released from jail on their own recognizance.</TE>
<TE>   The most extensive damage occurred at Marco Forster school, where roof
tiles, lockers, water fountains, cafeteria windows and light fixtures
were smashed. At adjacent Del Obispo, about 15 handmade planter boxes
were ripped from two rows of portable classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   "It was all malicious vandalism, but the planter boxes that were made
by students and staff were especially meaningful," said Associate Supt.
Dan Crawford.</TE>
<TE>   Dorothy Dalton, whose son attends Marco Forster, said, "I don't know
why people do things like this. It seems so silly, such a waste."</TE>
<TE>   Experts say arrests in such cases are unusual, but the timing of the
crime--during the holidays--is not.</TE>
<TE>   "Schools are not designed to be defended. They are open places . . .
and quite vulnerable. They're much more a target during holidays," said
Ron Stephens, executive director of the nonprofit National School Safety
Center in Westlake Village.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, 25,430 property crimes at schools were reported to the
California Department of Education in 1999-2000, down from 27,090
incidents four years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the decline, the costs of theft, vandalism and arson are
steep: $24 million in 1999-2000, the last year for which statistics are
available.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been said that we spend more on vandalism than we do on
textbooks in our schools," Stephens said.</TE>
<TE>   Districts, most notably the Los Angeles Unified School District, have
turned to cameras to deter vandals, especially during holiday breaks when
campuses go dark for days or weeks at a time.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a trend I've noticed for many years," said Lt. Keith Moore with
the Los Angeles school district police. "The vandals know there's no one
at school, so they strike. We deploy extra officers during that time."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the district has installed cameras at 10 high
schools, and Moore said there are plans for "a significant camera
presence" on most campuses in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking at getting cameras that show real time, where they can
be monitored on laptops or desktop computers," Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   Already, he said, districts in Cleveland; Jackson, Miss.; and
Washington, D.C., can monitor campus activity online.</TE>
<TE>   "Technology can be one of a school's best friends in combating
vandalism," Stephens said. "The cost is huge. But you either pay for
vandalism or pay for vandalism protection."</TE>
<TE>   There were no cameras at Capistrano Valley High, but surveillance
equipment is in place at three district high schools: San Clemente, Dana
Hills and Junipero Serra. Crawford said cameras are scheduled go into all
secondary schools in the district within a year, and officials are
considering even more steps, such as adding security guards.</TE>

<HD>Girl, 16, Convicted of Torturing, Killing 72-Year-Old Woman</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>GENE MADDAUS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A jury convicted a teenage girl Thursday of torturing and killing a
72-year-old woman in the victim's Rialto home in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Christy Phillips, 16, was tried as an adult and faces 34 years to life
in prison at sentencing Jan. 31, Deputy Dist. Atty. Joanne Uhlman said.</LD>
<LD>   The jury of 11 women and one man deliberated about seven hours over
two days before deciding that Phillips killed Manuela "Nellie" Fyock with
a wood-splitting wedge, a tire iron, a pipe wrench and a hatchet on July
22, 2000.</LD>
<TE>   The Fyock family hugged as the verdict was read in San Bernardino
County Superior Court in Fontana.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt good. It felt real good," said Mark Maysey, Fyock's stepson.
"This is a very big step. I've often wondered what people really, truly
meant by closure, but now I think I know."</TE>
<TE>   Phillips stared ahead when the verdict was read, then looked down. Her
mother, Anita Phillips, sat stone-faced.</TE>
<TE>   Over four days of testimony, Phillips recanted her videotaped
confession and testified that a 13-year-old friend was the killer.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutor Uhlman said: "I'm very pleased the jury was able to see
through the defendant's lies. I get concerned when lies are presented to
the jury. My concern was that someone would fall for it."</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyer John Crouch argued that Phillips' friend tricked her
into confessing. The defendant said the friend told her that if both
confessed, the police would not know whom to blame and that they would be
released. But the girl told police that Phillips was the killer.</TE>
<TE>   In her confession, Phillips said she went to Fyock's house to adopt a
cat but became angry when Fyock treated her as if she were a thief.</TE>
<TE>   The friend was released days after the murder and was not charged. She
testified at a preliminary hearing, but then exercised her 5th Amendment
right against self-incrimination and declined to testify at the trial.</TE>
<TE>   The jury forewoman said she was shocked by the crime. Without the
taped confession, she said, "it would have been a tossup between the two
of them."</TE>
<TE>   Crouch tried unsuccessfully to keep the tape out of the trial, arguing
that Phillips was not given a chance to call her mother before being
interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you ring a bell, it's hard to un-ring it," he said. "It's hard
to convince a jury that someone gave a false confession."</TE>

<HD>Jones Blames Davis for State Lottery 'Scam'</HD>
<DH>Politics: The GOP candidate claims a pattern of lapses. Aide to
governor denies it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gubernatorial candidate Bill Jones on Thursday blamed Gov. Gray
Davis for the state lottery's practice of selling tickets after the big
prizes had been won, saying the "scam" reflected a pattern of unethical
conduct.</LD>
<LD>   "Once again, this administration has attempted to place itself above
the law," Jones said at a campaign stop in Burbank.</LD>
<LD>   The Republican candidate was referring to the state Lottery
Commission's recent admission that it sold Scratchers tickets after the
grand prizes were gone. But he expanded on the theme to renew earlier
attacks on the Democratic incumbent.</LD>
<TE>   Jones, California secretary of state, hammered Davis for "strong-arm
fund-raising tactics" and alleged conflicts of interest among his energy
advisors.</TE>
<TE>   "The legal and the ethical standards Californians have a right to
expect from the executive branch have been virtually nonexistent in this
current Davis administration," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Salazar, a spokesman for the Davis reelection campaign, called
the charges "ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   "This is just another attempt by a fledgling campaign to get their
candidate's name in the paper," Salazar said. "He's latching onto news
stories in a desperate attempt to keep himself relevant."</TE>
<TE>   Jones has been struggling to raise enough money for statewide
television ads to promote his candidacy in the March 5 primary. His
opponents, former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and financier Bill
Simon Jr., are multimillionaires who can tap their own fortunes for the
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   But by seizing on the Lottery mishap at stops in Burbank and
Sacramento on Thursday, Jones drew coverage by more than a dozen TV and
radio stations.</TE>
<TE>   In Burbank, his backdrop was the Rancho Market, a Verdugo Drive
grocery store with Desert Gold, Cash Roll and other Scratchers games at
the cash register.</TE>
<TE>   "Ladies and gentlemen, the action taken by the governor and his
Lottery Commission is nothing short of a fraud--fraud being perpetrated
on a massive scale," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   The California Lottery's chief executive, Joan Wilson, has apologized
for selling game tickets after the big prizes were gone, a circumstance
that occurred in 11 of the 137 games played since 1996. She has promised
a $1-million "second chance" drawing for any ticket buyers.</TE>
<TE>   Jones laid the blame for the ticket mess squarely on the governor,
saying the sales were not the mistake of "some bureaucrat located in a
back office."</TE>
<TE>   Lottery spokesman Vincent Montane denied that Davis knew tickets were
being sold after the big prizes were gone. He said most of the games took
place under the governor's predecessor, Republican Pete Wilson. The Davis
administration discovered the practice and stopped it, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Jones called on the state's four lottery commissioners to
resign. Montane said they would not.</TE>
<TE>   Jones also criticized the state's plan to require players in the
"second-chance" game next month to pay for the tickets. Montane conceded
that Jones "has a point" and said the state was considering whether to
distribute the $1 million in tickets at no charge.</TE>
<TE>   The secretary of state compared the lottery controversy to earlier
questions about the Davis administration's ethics. He noted that it had
fired five energy consultants last year for alleged conflicts of
interests. They were involved in state electricity purchases from
generators whose stock they owned.</TE>
<TE>   "How many times can you plead ignorance--from the administration's
standpoint--before people say, 'There's more to this. There's a lack of
credibility, there's a lack of integrity in the governor's office,' "
Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   Salazar of the Davis campaign said Jones "has no ideas of his own to
offer, so he laces his campaign with these types of attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever any of these types of situations have come up, the governor
has moved to correct them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In his 1998 campaign for governor, Davis also faced attacks on his
ethical conduct, from alleged fund-raising conflicts to claims that he
put cronies on the state payroll. Nonetheless, he beat his GOP opponent,
Dan Lungren, by more than 1 million votes.</TE>
<TE>   At the Burbank stop, Jones also turned on Riordan, the front-runner in
the GOP primary. He questioned Riordan's Republican credentials, saying
he "seems to want to be on both sides of every issue."</TE>
<TE>   He recalled the Rampart police corruption scandal that erupted when
Riordan was mayor, criticized him for opposing a breakup of the Los
Angeles Unified School District, and said the city overcharged the rest
of the state for electricity last year at the height of the blackout
threats.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan burst into laughter when asked to respond to the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "What's his point?" he asked after a campaign event in Hollywood.
"It's just too many things. But I mean, he's having fun with it. And I'm
proud of my record as mayor."</TE>

<HD>Davis Restores Funds for Trauma Centers</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Flanked by trauma surgeons on the steps of County-USC Medical
Center Thursday, Gov. Gray Davis announced the restoration of $25 million
in funding for California trauma centers, as expected.</LD>
<LD>   Davis had proposed suspending the allocation in November as part of
his plan to close a projected $12-billion budget deficit. But after
criticism from lawmakers of both parties, he reversed his decision.</LD>
<LD>   "The 44 people who lost their lives on California roads over the
holidays are a reminder of the importance of having trauma care
available," he said, adding that "other reductions" in general fund
expenditures would spare cuts in trauma-care spending.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly half of the county's major trauma injuries are treated at
County-USC, King/Drew Medical Center and Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, said
Virginia Price Hastings, director of the county's Emergency Medical
Services Agency.</TE>

<HD>77-Car Pileup in Heavy Fog Kills 1</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An estimated 77 vehicles, including big rigs and a prison van,
collided in rapid-fire crashes Thursday morning on a foggy Kern County
highway, killing one person and injuring 15, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The chain-reaction wreck, which went on for about 10 minutes, shut
down California 58 about 90 miles northwest of Los Angeles in the
foothills of the Tehachapi Mountains, which separate the Mojave Desert
from the southern San Joaquin Valley.</LD>
<LD>   "It was one for the ages," said Highway Patrol Officer Sterlin Smith.
"It was a crash guys like me see once in our career."</LD>
<TE>   The fog, typical for the area, hampered visibility.</TE>
<TE>   "[Visibility] went from 100 feet at one point down to about zero, and
it's still there," Sgt. Ted Eichman said in the early afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Killed in the pileup was Carl Woosley, 52, of Bakersfield, who died
when his appliance repair pickup was struck by an 18-wheeler.</TE>
<TE>   Woosley appeared to have hit his brakes hard after the first two
collisions on the westbound freeway. A big rig, battling little or no
visibility, saw Woosley's vehicle too late to avoid the collision, Smith
said. The truck veered into a center divider, but its trailer smashed
into the back of Woosley's pickup.</TE>
<TE>   Woosley died at the scene, "possibly from a broken neck," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Officers said the pileup could have yielded more fatalities or serious
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "The potential for a greater catastrophe was great," Smith said. Most
of the other injuries were moderate.</TE>
<TE>   "The most serious other injuries were . . . maybe a broken arm," Smith
said.</TE>
<TE>   There were 15 separate crashes involving the 77 cars. Forty-two cars
collided on the eastbound side of the highway; 25 on the westbound side.
The eastbound lanes reopened about 5 p.m., hours after the westbound
lanes reopened.</TE>
<TE>   Other vehicles involved in the wreck included a California Department
of Corrections prisoner van, but no one aboard was reported injured. A
Kern County firetruck was involved in a minor-injury accident, Eichman
said.</TE>
<TE>   California 58 connects routes that cross the Mojave Desert with
highways in the San Joaquin Valley, and is heavily used by trucks.</TE>
<TE>   Nine vehicles collided later in fog on Interstate 5 to the southwest
in Tejon Pass, blocking the southbound side.</TE>

<HD>Burton Pronounces State Capitol Security Upgrade Good Enough</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>Calling an apparent end to additional security improvements at the
state Capitol, the powerful leader of the Senate said Thursday that
safety protections for its occupants and the public are adequate.</LD>
<LD>   Except for installing metal detectors at entrances to the 127-year-old
statehouse, Senate President pro tem John Burton said every reasonable
security upgrade has been made and no more are necessary.</LD>
<LD>   "There is adequate protection for what you can protect against," he
told reporters. He also said that "anybody who is willing to die to do
something, you can't stop them."</LD>
<TE>   Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza (D-Merced), chairman of a Capitol security
committee, which includes Burton, said he generally agreed that security
has been improved, but he was not ready to say that the job is finished.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have to look at a permanent barrier for the Capitol
perimeter," Cardoza said.</TE>
<TE>   Burton is the Legislature's most powerful member. Without his
approval, spending on new projects can be certain to stop.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner D.O. "Spike" Helmick of the California Highway Patrol,
which is in charge of security at state structures, said that about $2
million has been invested in new Capitol security measures during the
last few years.</TE>
<TE>   But the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks against the World Trade Center and
the Pentagon and the anthrax scare turned up the pressure to make the
state Capitol even safer, including moving the mail room from a basement
site under the governor's office to a secure spot several miles away.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, security improvements have included locking all doors to
the Capitol except at two entries, where visitors must display
identification and can be searched. Also, extra CHP officers and two
bomb-sniffing dogs patrol the building and surrounding Capitol Park.</TE>
<TE>   At several spots, flower pots weighing one ton each have been erected
as temporary barriers against vehicles. No agreement has been reached on
a permanent barricade, long sought by the CHP.</TE>
<TE>   Starting in the mid-1990s, a slow but steady effort has been underway
to improve security in the building. Steps include hidden video cameras,
special lighting, metal detectors at the Senate visitors gallery,
electronic lock systems, employee ID badges and stricter access to the
Capitol basement garage where the cars of the governor and lawmakers are
parked.</TE>
<TE>   But Burton told reporters Thursday he believes the only addition still
needed is metal detectors at the two public entrances. He said he wants
the detectors installed inside the building and not outside where lines
of "little school kids [could] catch pneumonia in the rain."</TE>
<TE>   There also is no agreement yet on where visitors would gather inside
the building while waiting to go through the detectors. Burton noted that
at the U.S. Capitol, visitors are screened inside the buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Helmick was mostly satisfied with the progress. "We could do more,
sure, but . . . we've come a lot further than I ever thought we would."</TE>

<HD>Burton Urges Income Tax Increase</HD>
<DH>Levies: The senator seeks to restore top brackets, but concedes
that he faces an uphill fight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>State Senate leader John L. Burton on Thursday proposed a
$2.5-billion annual income tax increase on the wealthiest Californians as
a way to help fill the projected $12-billion budget shortfall.</LD>
<LD>   The liberal Democrat from San Francisco called for restoring the
highest individual tax brackets to 10% and 11% from 9.3%, the rate since
Republican Pete Wilson was governor.</LD>
<LD>   Even with Democrats controlling the Assembly and Senate, the proposal
faces an uphill fight in this election year. Burton acknowledged its long
odds.</LD>
<TE>   But he said the wealthiest Californians received a "pretty nice"
income tax break last year from President Bush and Congress. They would
suffer no hardship by sharing it to prevent potentially deep cuts in
programs for the elderly, disabled and needy, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They can still go out and buy a BMW, if they want," Burton, president
pro tem of the Senate, said of the wealthy.</TE>
<TE>   He insisted that raising the rates would not be a tax increase.
Instead, he called the proposal "revenue restoration."</TE>
<TE>   The plan was shrugged off by an aide to Gov. Gray Davis and the leader
of Senate Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor will put his "focus
on cutting back [the budget] rather than increasing taxes."</TE>
<TE>   "John Burton wants to raise taxes and the sun came up this morning.
So, all is normal in the world," said Sen. Jim Brulte (R-Rancho
Cucamonga), Senate Republican leader. "I don't think there are any
Republican votes to raise income taxes."</TE>
<TE>   But Herb Wesson (D-Culver City), who is scheduled to become the new
speaker of the Assembly, gave it a slightly warmer reception, saying it
will get serious discussion in the lower house. "Nothing is off the
table," Wesson said.</TE>
<TE>   Burton, the second most powerful man in the Capitol after Davis,
conceded at a news conference that he was unsure whether he could push
the proposal through the Senate, let alone the more conservative
Assembly, where election jitters have already begun.</TE>
<TE>   But he defended the notion of raising income taxes of the wealthy to
spare severe cuts in social programs for poor Californians.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Burton program, single people with annual taxable incomes
after deductions of $130,000 to $260,000 would be raised into a new 10%
bracket. Those whose income exceeds $260,000 would be in the 11% bracket.</TE>
<TE>   Married couples filing a joint return would be pushed into the 10%
bracket if their taxable income was $260,000 to $520,000. Those whose
taxable incomes exceeded $520,000 would be in the 11% bracket.</TE>
<TE>   Burton said the higher tax would produce $2.5 billion a year. It would
remain in effect until the state budget regained a 3% reserve or surplus.
Then, it would return to 9.3%, Burton said.</TE>

<LD>Authorities say murders in Fresno nearly doubled last year.</LD>
<LD>   In 2001, 40 people were killed--compared with 24 the year before.
While the toll is well below the city's record of 98 homicides in 1993,
police say Fresno has big problems with killings stemming from gangs,
drugs and robberies.</LD>
<LD>   A majority of the assailants and victims were minority males. Of the
40 slayings, 25 remain unsolved.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, nearby Madera had seven killings, the same as during 2000.
Five of the seven killings in 2001 involved gangs and remain unsolved,
said Sgt. Ken Alley.</TE>

<HD>Peter Hemmings, 67; L.A. Opera Founding Chief</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES MUSIC CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Peter Hemmings--the first general director of Los Angeles Opera and
the man who assured a lasting place for the art form here--died early
this morning at home in Dorset, England. He was 67. The cause of death
was cancer.</LD>
<LD>   When the dapper and eloquent British impresario took charge in 1984,
Los Angeles was the only major Western city that could not maintain its
own opera company.</LD>
<LD>   With a budget of just $6.4 million, Hemmings launched Music Center
Opera (later renamed Los Angeles Opera), mounting five productions in a
first season that immediately made the operatic world take notice.</LD>
<TE>   By the time he retired in 2000 to return to his native England,
Hemmings had left behind a company with a $22-million budget and an
eight-opera season of more than 50 performances, most of them selling
out.</TE>
<TE>   In the process, he masterminded several productions that became part
of Los Angeles' cultural iconography--including a celebrated version of
Wagner's "Tristan und Isolde" designed by a fellow
Briton-turned-Angeleno, artist David Hockney--and lent a new
sophisticated image to the city's cultural life.</TE>
<TE>   Hemmings was also responsible for bringing Placido Domingo to the
company at the outset as artistic advisor, realizing that the popular
tenor's presence assured L.A. Opera a necessary celebrity factor. That
also paved the way for Domingo to become the company's artistic director
after Hemmings retired.</TE>
<TE>   "Since the first day Peter was here," Domingo said Thursday, "we were
together. I learned a lot from him about how to make things happen.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not easy to have an opera company in Los Angeles, but he knew
that the only way to go was up," Domingo said. "And with his wit,
devotion and that straightforward and serene manner he had, he seemed to
know just how to approach the board, the audiences and the artists. It is
a challenge for me to continue what he began."</TE>
<TE>   Personally, Hemmings never seemed the sort to court celebrity. His own
modest manner and politeness were more reminiscent of a conservative
British banker than a flamboyant American opera impresario.</TE>
<TE>   But that apparent conventionality served him well. It lent
respectability to what had, for a century in Los Angeles, seemed a
financially fly-by-night art form. His understated style also proved a
useful tool in convincing operagoers to take risks. A sensation the first
season was a daring production of Richard Strauss' "Salome" that included
nudity.</TE>
<TE>   But Hemmings' manner was not altogether deceptive. He did firmly
believe in tradition. He was a devoted family man with five children. And
he built the opera company as he might a family, scouting local talent
whom he would nurture over the years, creating a strong ensemble company.</TE>
<TE>   One such discovery, baritone Rodney Gilfry, sang a single line in the
company's first production, Verdi's "Otello." By the time of Hemmings'
retirement, Gilfry had become an international star, and he performed the
title role in Hemmings' final Los Angeles Opera production, Benjamin
Britten's "Billy Budd," in June 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "His legacy--an opera company of true international stature--can't be
appreciated in terms of numbers of performances and dollars," Gilfry
said. "It takes tenacity to permanently change the depth and richness of
a city's culture, and that's what he did."</TE>
<TE>A Brief Career as a Singer</TE>
<TE>   Peter William Hemmings was born in the Middlesex town of Enfield on
April 10, 1934. Although he graduated from Cambridge University with a
degree in classics, his college life was closely associated with vocal
music: He was a choral scholar and served as president of the University
Opera Group. After graduation, he briefly pursued a career as a singer,
performing with the Camden Festival and Chelsea Opera Group.</TE>
<TE>   In 1958 he joined Harold Holt Ltd., a London music management firm,
and a year later he became personal assistant to the manager of Sadler's
Wells Opera. No longer intent upon a singing career, Hemmings became
repertory and planning manager for the company. In 1962, the newly formed
Scottish National Opera invited him to become its first administrator.</TE>
<TE>   He built the company, where he remained 15 years, into one of the most
respected in Britain, mounting ambitious productions of epic works such
as Wagner's "Ring" cycle and Berlioz's "The Trojans," as well as
providing a mix of classics and 20th century operas. By 1975, Hemmings
was able to find the company a permanent theater in Glasgow, thus giving
Scotland its first national opera house.</TE>
<TE>   In 1977, he moved to Australian Opera, where his mandate was to
provide the company with a national and international profile to match
its new hall in Sydney. There, however, Hemmings was hindered by
political infighting, and he returned to Britain in 1979 to manage the
London Symphony Orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   Five years later, when Hemmings moved into his office at the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion, on Nov. 5, 1984, as the first executive director of
the Music Center Opera Assn., he told The Times, he had "a clean slate,"
with nothing having been planned and a minimal staff.</TE>
<TE>Stuck Curtain an Apt Omen for L.A.</TE>
<TE>   The curtain started to rise on the new company's first performance
Oct. 6, 1986, and promptly stuck half way up for a few seconds. It was an
apt omen, both of the difficulty of bringing opera to Los Angeles and of
Hemmings' assurances that obstacles could be overcome.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, it was a triumphant night, with a theatrically vivid
production by German director Goetz Friedrich of Verdi's "Otello,"
starring Domingo.</TE>
<TE>   Hemmings saw his role in Los Angeles as bringing standard repertory to
those who had little experience with opera, but he also thought the city
was ripe for new discoveries. His idea was to mix well-known, popular
operas with unfamiliar works, modern works and new works, throwing in
Baroque operas and even a musical or operetta each season.</TE>
<TE>   Among the new productions that garnered wide attention were those
designed by Hockney (the "Tristan" and Strauss' "Die Frau Ohne
Schatten"), Berg's "Wozzeck" (directed by the radical American David
Alden and conducted by Simon Rattle), Prokofiev's "The Fiery Angel"
(presented in America for the first time), Berlioz's "The Trojans" (in
only its second complete production in America), and Debussy's "Pelleas
and Melisande" (updated by Peter Sellars).</TE>
<TE>   "Unless you do these operas with a spark of something that is
contemporary, it all dies," he told Opera News in 1996. "I have always
believed that opera is a vibrant, living art form with an exciting
future, not simply a museum art."</TE>
<TE>   To give the company an individual style, Hemmings forged close
relationships with noted directors, such as Friedrich and Peter Hall,
whose work had not been regularly seen in America. And he took chances on
young directors, such as Julie Taymor, whose production of Wagner's "The
Flying Dutchman" was controversial but also presaged to some the
theatrical brilliance she brought to "The Lion King."</TE>
<TE>   The company's personality also came from a core group of young singers
whom Hemmings developed; besides Gilfry, they included Suzanna Guzman,
Richard Bernstein and Greg Fedderly.</TE>
<TE>   Hemmings commissioned several new works, often in collaboration with
other companies. Joonas Kokkonan's "Kullervo" (with Finnish Opera) and
Tobias Picker's "Fantastic Mr. Fox" originated in Los Angeles. Other new
operas in which the company was one of a consortium of commissioners were
John Adams' "Nixon in China" and Daniel Catan's "Florencia en el
Amazonas." Hemmings also joined consortiums to produce Adams' "The Death
of Klinghoffer," but its Los Angeles production was canceled, he said,
for financial reasons.</TE>
<TE>Audiences Grow Ever Larger</TE>
<TE>   Hemmings was sometimes criticized for not having top-notch conductors
in the pit, but he did have a few--Zubin Mehta conducted the "Tristan,"
Esa-Pekka Salonen led the "Pelleas" and Kent Nagano (now the company's
principal conductor) was in the pit for Kurt Weill's "The Rise and Fall
of the City of Mahagonny" and "Nixon in China."</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, Los Angeles Opera suffered from the national
economic downturn, running up a deficit of $3 million. To save the
company, Hemmings became somewhat safer in his programming. In so doing,
he found that he attracted ever-larger audiences, and by his last season
he was regularly filling the theater.</TE>
<TE>   However, after 16 years, he wanted to return to London and take on new
challenges. Last year, he was appointed to the board of the Royal Opera,
where he played an active role in helping return that troubled company to
its former glory. As the general consultant to the Compton Verney
Project, he was also committed to building a new opera house in the
English Midlands.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Hemmings received the OBE (officer of the Order of the
British Empire). He was an honorary fellow of the Royal Academy of Music
in London and fellow of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music. He served as
vice chairman of Opera America and received honorary degrees from
Strathclyde University and Cal State Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   Hemmings is survived by his wife, Jane Frances Kearnes, and five
children.</TE>

<HD>Catya Sassoon, 33; Model, Actress, Daughter of Vidal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Catya Sassoon, a model-turned-actress and daughter of celebrity
hairstylist Vidal Sassoon, has died. She was 33.</LD>
<LD>   Sassoon died in her sleep Tuesday morning at her home in the Hollywood
Hills after attending a party at a friend's house, according to her
manager, Hilly Elkins.</LD>
<LD>   "She complained of feeling woozy, and they left the party and went
home," Elkins said Thursday. When Sassoon's husband, Joe Myers, tried to
awaken her a few hours later, she failed to respond, Elkins said. Results
of an autopsy are pending.</LD>
<TE>   Born in New York City, Sassoon was the first of Beverly and Vidal
Sassoon's four children. Growing up in Beverly Hills, she lived a fast
life.</TE>
<TE>   At 13, she pierced her nostrils and cut her hair into a mohawk that
she dyed purple and white.</TE>
<TE>   At 14, she dropped out of Beverly Hills High School and left home to
work as a model in Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   A month shy of turning 16, she married her first husband, Luca
Scalisi, son of an Italian movie producer and then a USC film school
student.</TE>
<TE>   "She's wild, crazy and stubborn. But then we all are," Beverly Sassoon
told People magazine in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   After moving to Manhattan to start her modeling career, Sassoon signed
with the Prestige Agency and moved into a group apartment.</TE>
<TE>   "It was sheer hell living there with 12 girls fighting for one of the
two available showers every morning at 6," she told People. "Everyone
stole everyone's makeup. I was the youngest. The rest were in their 20s."</TE>
<TE>   When she complained to her father, he moved her into her own penthouse
apartment across the street.</TE>
<TE>   The 5-foot-8, 117-pound, auburn-haired Sassoon quickly became one of
the top junior models in New York.</TE>
<TE>   She appeared on the covers of Seventeen, Bride and other magazines. In
1985, Rolling Stone ran a photograph of her, proclaiming, "Catya Sassoon
defines the word nubile."</TE>
<TE>   Later media accounts referred to Sassoon's problems with drugs and
alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, Catya Sassoon and her mother talked openly about their
chemical dependencies--and how they kicked them--in joint promotional
appearances for Beverly's Pocket Books "Fantasies" novel.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Beverly Sassoon told columnist Marilyn Beck that she was
three years clear of an alcohol addiction and that 22-year-old Catya was
about to celebrate "a year free from a drug habit that was so tough there
were times I felt I was going to lose her."</TE>
<TE>   Sassoon landed her first film job at 15: a small role as a Los Angeles
gang member in "Tuff Turf," starring James Spader and Robert Downey Jr.</TE>
<TE>   She went on to appear in about 20 other films, including "Bloodfist
IV: Die Trying," "The Hunted," "Modern Girls" and "Hollywood Kids." She
also appeared in numerous television shows and was lead singer in an
all-girl group called the Feline Force.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to her husband, parents and siblings, Sassoon is survived
by her twin daughters, Mycca and Syke; and a son, London.</TE>
<TE>   A funeral service will be held at 1 p.m. today at Eden Hills Memorial
Park in Mission Hills.</TE>

<KH>ROSE BOWL* BCS TITLE GAME MIAMI 37, NEBRASKA 14</KH>
<KH>Perfect Storm</KH>
<HD>Miami's Emphatic Victory Leaves Room at Top for Only One No. 1</HD>
<DH>College football: Hurricanes erase all doubt, building 34-0
halftime lead and finishing as nation's only unbeaten team. Dorsey,
Johnson are co-MVPs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You knew when it was 34-0 at the half that the bowl championship
series had gotten this title-game thing half right.</LD>
<LD>   In its noble quest to pit the nation's top two teams in Thursday's
national title game, the BCS went one for two--basically Shaquille
O'Neal's free-throw percentage.</LD>
<LD>   The only real debate after Miami's 37-14 win over Nebraska before a
crowd of 93,781 is where the Hurricanes will display their fifth national
title trophy since 1983 and whether Nebraska will downgrade to eight-man
football.</LD>
<TE>   By the time Miami released Nebraska from its vise, there was no
question the Hurricanes were deserving of victory's spoils.</TE>
<TE>   Miami was No. 1 going into the game and No. 1 coming out. The
Hurricanes, the only major college team to finish 12-0, may now proceed
directly to their local jeweler for their national title ring fittings.</TE>
<TE>   So much for the delightful derision a Nebraska win might have wrought.</TE>
<TE>   There would be no split title, no late-night tallies to see if Oregon,
No. 2 in both polls, might have snared the Associated Press title in the
event of a Nebraska win.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, the question was whether Nebraska would score, not
win.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, there will always be the Oregon argument. That Oregon deserved to
be in Pasadena instead of Nebraska. That Oregon would have given Miami a
better game, would have not been run over like road kill.</TE>
<TE>   That Oregon's "Gang Green" defense surely would have fared better than
Nebraska's "Blackshirts," who ought to be blacklisted until they
rediscover the ancient art of tackling.</TE>
<TE>   You really have to wonder, though, what chance Oregon would have stood
against Miami, which outdid the pregame show in terms of fireworks
displays.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Miami Coach Larry Coker was asked if he'd like to play
Oregon and settle this dispute once and for all.</TE>
<TE>   "Why?" Coker said. "We're national champions. There's no need to
settle anything. We won it on the field tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Doubts regarding which team was the nation's best were answered
shortly after the national anthem. Nebraska won the coin flip, then
little else.</TE>
<TE>   It was an even more dominant display than Miami wins in days of yore,
when the Hurricanes' speed and quickness led to three victories over
Nebraska in the Orange Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing in this storied rivalry ranked with this rank performance.</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska players, apparently revived at halftime by the team's medical
staff, outscored Miami in the second half, 14-3, but it was like the fire
squad arriving after the house burned down.</TE>
<TE>   The Nebraska defense?</TE>
<TE>   It picked up where it left off on Nov. 23, when it surrendered 62
points in a loss to Colorado at Boulder.</TE>
<TE>   If you're keeping tabs at the home office in Omaha, Nebraska has been
outscored, 99-50, in its last two defeats. It yielded 582 yards in the
Colorado debacle and 472 yards against Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday was a turkey shoot for Miami quarterback Ken Dorsey and
receiver Andre Johnson, who played pitch-and-catch against a helpless
secondary.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey completed 22 of 35 passes for 362 yards and three touchdowns,
and Johnson finished with seven catches for 199 yards with two
touchdowns. The players shared the game's most valuable player award.</TE>
<TE>   The game capped a fairy-tale season for Coker, a 53-year-old lifetime
assistant who became the first rookie coach to win a national title since
Michigan's Bennie Oosterbaan in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   Coker inherited his team only because Butch Davis left this year to
coach the Cleveland Browns. Coker thanked his lucky stars, and the Miami
administration, for giving "an old coach who'd never coached a game an
opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   What's more, Miami won its national title only six years after being
docked 24 scholarships for NCAA violations.</TE>
<TE>   "There were reports the program would never be back and compete on a
national level," Coker said. "That's obviously not the case."</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska would have had you believe the Colorado game was an
aberration, not an affliction, yet the Cornhuskers showed early they had
no business being in this game. They suffered consecutive defeats for the
first time since 1990.</TE>
<TE>   "A very unpleasant feeling," Nebraska Coach Frank Solich said.</TE>
<TE>   Miami struck early and often.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the fastest team I've ever been around," Coker said.</TE>
<TE>   And, now, the fastest team Nebraska's been around.</TE>
<TE>   After the Hurricanes recovered Nebraska quarterback Eric Crouch's
first-quarter fumble, Dorsey hit Johnson for a 49-yard scoring pass on
first down.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson could not have been more open on the play after Nebraska
cornerback Keyou Craver fell down on the coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey's eyes became grapefruits.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I'd put too much on it, I was so excited," Dorsey said of
the throw. "I just threw it out there."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson was so alone he could have been ticketed for loitering.</TE>
<TE>   His thoughts?</TE>
<TE>   "Please let me catch it," he said. "Please let me catch it."</TE>
<TE>   It is difficult to conjure up a turning point in such a lopsided game,
but here's one:</TE>
<TE>   Down only 7-0, and facing fourth and seven at the Miami 33, Solich
elected to punt the ball back to Miami's electrifying offense.</TE>
<TE>   That might be sound strategy in the ball-control Big 12, but it was
highly questionable given the potency of Miami's offense.</TE>
<TE>   How'd it go?</TE>
<TE>   The punt netted 19 yards. Miami took over at its 14, then cut through
the Nebraska defense like a knife through butter. The Hurricanes needed
only five plays to go 86 yards, tailback Clinton Portis scoring on a
dazzling 39-yard run to make it 14-0.</TE>
<TE>   Of his decision to punt, Solich said he was trying to pin Miami in its
own end.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was probably the right decision," Solich said. "I still
think it's the right decision."</TE>
<TE>   On Nebraska's next possession, Miami safety James Lewis scooped up a
pass that deflected off Tracey Wistrom's hands and returned the
interception 47 yards for a score to make it 21-0.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, after Nebraska went three and out, Miami needed only
two plays to score from its 34.</TE>
<TE>   On first down, Dorsey hit Johnson on a 45-yard pass play to the
Nebraska 21.</TE>
<TE>   From there, Dorsey and tight Jeremy Shockey hooked up on a 21-yard
pass-and-catch for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   It was like pinball. For good measure, Miami tacked on another score
before the half on an eight-yard pass from Dorsey to Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "They talked the talk and walked the walk," Nebraska's Craver said.
"We are not used to losing. It is hard to swallow."</TE>
<TE>   Bottom line: None of this was Nebraska's fault. The Cornhuskers did
not ask to be here. They were ranked No. 4 in both the coaches' and
writers' polls, yet advanced to the Rose Bowl by winning the No. 2 spot
in the BCS standings, a multi-pronged ranking formula that also
incorporates strength of schedule and computers.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks largely to the BCS' computer component, Nebraska was able to
edge Colorado for the Rose Bowl berth by 0.05 and Oregon--which routed
Colorado in Tuesday's Fiesta Bowl, 38-16--by 1.44.</TE>
<TE>   With Miami playing lights out, you wondered if any team the BCS spit
out would have been up to the task.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly was not the matchup everybody dreamed of," Solich said.
"Whether or not a matchup with anyone else would have worked any
different, I don't know. I don't know that anyone is as balanced as Miami
when they are playing at the top of their game."</TE>

<LD>You back the grandest old football game into a corner, shut out the
sun, turn down the heat, hook it up to machines, and what do you expect?</LD>
<LD>   What happened on a cool damp night Thursday, we all knew would happen.</LD>
<LD>   Granddaddy has never looked so frail.</LD>
<TE>   He's never seemed so confused.</TE>
<TE>   He's never fallen asleep so early.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl was the Hosed Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Miami picked up a national championship, Nebraska picked up a twisted
neck, and the rest of us had our pockets picked.</TE>
<TE>   The final score was Miami 37, Nebraska 14.</TE>
<TE>   The more important number is the one that connected me with David
Rothman.</TE>
<TE>   The South Bay guy is one of the eight BCS computer nerds who decided
that it would be Nebraska--and not Oregon--that would play Miami for the
national title.</TE>
<TE>   I phoned him at his home at halftime with a couple of questions.</TE>
<TE>   Did he know that Nebraska looked like a wheat stalk playing a game of
tag with a combine?</TE>
<TE>   Did he know that stiff Eric Crouch became the first Heisman Trophy to
resemble the actual Heisman Trophy?</TE>
<TE>   Did he know that Miami led by \o7 34 stinking points?\f7</TE>
<TE>   "What's the score?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   The score?</TE>
<TE>   "I turned the channel to something else when it was 27-0."</TE>
<TE>   How dare you.</TE>
<TE>   "Nebraska looked terrible.</TE>
<TE>   "They looked impotent."</TE>
<TE>   And who's fault is that, Mr. Ranked-Nebraska-Second?</TE>
<TE>   "Based on the information available, my computer model was the right
model."</TE>
<TE>   But now you will change the model?</TE>
<TE>   "No, my system is still the best system."</TE>
<TE>   Are you out of your digital mind?</TE>
<TE>   "Tonight was an extreme variation."</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, and on that first touchdown, Andre Johnson was giving out love
pats.</TE>
<TE>   This is how it started. This was our first clue.</TE>
<TE>   Midway through the first quarter, Johnson streaked down the right
sideline one-on-one with Nebraska star cornerback Keyuo Craver.</TE>
<TE>   Then, with one big swoop, he knocked Craver on his tush.</TE>
<TE>   Said Craver: "He grabbed me and pulled me and got the best of me."</TE>
<TE>   Said Johnson: "I tried to get a little physical. He fell down."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson ended up more alone than an Omaha vegetarian. Ken Dorsey
lofted him a 49-yard touchdown pass that eventually symbolized a game.</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska sat while Miami sprinted.</TE>
<TE>   It was first-round, one-punch knockout.</TE>
<TE>   Then we had to spend the next 11 rounds watching Miami dance and
Nebraska writhe.</TE>
<TE>   OK, so Nebraska scored twice in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   But both touchdowns came after dumb Miami penalties that would have
prevented them.</TE>
<TE>   Miami, unbeaten and seemingly untouchable, certainly deserves the
unanimous national championship.</TE>
<TE>   But the Rose Bowl didn't deserve this.</TE>
<TE>   The humans wanted Oregon in this game.</TE>
<TE>   As usual, the humans were right.</TE>
<TE>   "Lot of guys talk about they should have been here," countered Edward
Reed, Miami safety, speaking directly to those teams. "But you weren't
here. And if you were here, you would have gotten the same treatment."</TE>
<TE>   Granted, it seems like nobody would have beaten Miami Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody could match their speed, which left Nebraska defensive end
Chris Kelsay wide-eyed.</TE>
<TE>   "They really have some athletes," he said. "And those athletes really
stepped up to the plate."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody could also match Dorsey's touch, his offensive line's push, and
their defense's pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly didn't play well or make it a competitive game, so, from
that end of it, it was certainly not the matchup everybody dreamed of,"
Nebraska Coach Frank Solich said.</TE>
<TE>   "But whether any other matchup would have been any different, I don't
know."</TE>
<TE>   But wouldn't we have liked to find out?</TE>
<TE>   So Oregon's defense might have allowed 40 points. Think there's at
least a chance that Joey Harrington could have led their offense to 42?</TE>
<TE>   Heck, we would have taken Oregon against Illinois on New Year's
afternoon rather than watch this mess.</TE>
<TE>   The game began with the waving and shaking of 60,000 red-clad Nebraska
fans who filled most of the stadium.</TE>
<TE>   By halftime, they were the world's largest holiday tablecloth.</TE>
<TE>   The game began with touching anthems and a Navy fly-over above our
usual midfield painted rose.</TE>
<TE>   By halftime, that rose had been dulled and flattened by Nebraska
backs.</TE>
<TE>   The game began with everyone so impressed with Nebraska's
fearlessness.</TE>
<TE>   But a Solich decision at the end of the first quarter changed all
that.</TE>
<TE>   Still trailing only 7-0, Nebraska drove 53 yards in nine plays.</TE>
<TE>   It was facing fourth-and-seven on the Miami 33-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   The Huskers called timeout.</TE>
<TE>   They were going to go for the first down, right?</TE>
<TE>   Wrong.</TE>
<TE>   In a decision that cowered and twittered, they ran back on the field
and punted.</TE>
<TE>   The 19-yard squib was exactly what Miami needed.</TE>
<TE>   The Hurricanes scored on their next possession.</TE>
<TE>   And their next possession.</TE>
<TE>   And their next possession.</TE>
<TE>   And the one after that.</TE>
<TE>   They scored on a run where their guy stumbled in the backfield and it
still didn't matter.</TE>
<TE>   They scored on an interception return where Nebraska receiver Tracey
Wistrom watched the ball sail through his hands.</TE>
<TE>   They scored on what looked like a sandlot,
you-go-to-the-trash-can-and-I'll-lob-it-to-you pass to Jeremy Shockey.</TE>
<TE>   And they scored on a pass where Johnson simply jogged into the end
zone, turned around, and caught it.</TE>
<TE>   Incidentally, when Nebraska went for the first down on a similar play
late in the game, it ended up scoring a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "We had the ability to pin them back there ... make them go the length
of the field," Solich said. "I think that was probably the right
decision, and I still think it is the right decision."</TE>
<TE>   In looking back on what might have been the biggest mismatch in Rose
Bowl history, there was really one terribly wrong decision.</TE>
<TE>   It was the decision of this game's organizers to buy into the promises
from this certain hokey outfit that things would be different.</TE>
<TE>   All hail Miami.</TE>
<TE>   And to hail with the BCS.</TE>

<LD>The Rose Bowl game has a rich history of controversies, upsets,
intrigue and improbable endings. One game that stands out is the 1939
encounter between USC and Duke.</LD>
<LD>   The Blue Devils were undefeated, untied and unscored upon before the
game and it seemed that their perfect record would remain intact, as they
led the Trojans, 3-0, late in the fourth quarter.</LD>
<LD>   However, Doyle Nave, a fourth-string USC quarterback, came off the
bench to complete four consecutive passes to end Al Krueger, the last for
a touchdown, as the Trojans won, 7-3.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the Rose Bowl record for the longest kickoff
return?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Other significant games:</TE>
<TE>   * 1922. Favored California was held to a 0-0 tie by Washington &amp;
Jefferson on a muddy field. One writer dismissed the underdog team before
the game by writing, "All I know about Washington and Jefferson is that
they're both dead."</TE>
<TE>   * 1925. Notre Dame, with its famed "Four Horsemen" backfield of Don
Miller, Elmer Layden, Dan Crowley and Harry Stuhldreher, prevailed over
Stanford, 27-10.</TE>
<TE>   * 1934. On a field soaked by rain, unheralded Columbia defeated
Stanford, 7-0. The only touchdown was scored in the second quarter by Al
Barabas, who skillfully executed a hidden ball play on a 17-yard run.</TE>
<TE>   * 1949. Northwestern defeated California, 20-14, on a touchdown scored
by the Wildcats' Art Murakowski on a disputed play. There was no TV
instant replay at the time to confirm whether Murakowski fumbled the ball
before he crossed the goal line, although photographs indicate that he
did.</TE>
<TE>   * 1963. USC led Wisconsin, 42-14, in the fourth quarter before
quarterback Ron VanderKelen rallied the Badgers with his accurate
passing. The Trojans hung on to win, 42-37, in a game marred by
penalties. Times columnist Jim Murray, noting the penalties, wrote that
"the game lasted only slightly less long than the war of 1812."</TE>
<TE>   * 1976. UCLA trailed Ohio State, 3-0, at halftime but touchdown passes
by John Sciarra to Wally Henry rallied the Bruins for a 23-10 victory
over the Buckeyes and two-time Heisman Trophy winner Archie Griffin.</TE>
<TE>   * 1980. With 5:21 remaining, Ohio State led USC, 16-10. The Trojans
then drove 83 yards in eight plays for a touchdown, all on the ground,
with tailback Charles White carrying six times for 71 yards. The extra
point gave USC a 17-16 victory.</TE>
<TE>   * 1995. Penn State, in its first Rose Bowl appearance since losing to
USC, 14-3, in 1923, defeated Oregon, 38-20. Oregon quarterback Danny
O'Neil set Rose Bowl records for passes completed, 41 of 61, and yardage,
456, in the loss.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: UCLA's Al Hoisch, 103 yards against Illinois in 1947.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: The 1923 Rose Bowl game between Penn State and USC was
scheduled for 2:15 p.m. But the bus carrying Penn State players and Coach
Hugo Bezdek didn't arrive until 2:30.</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Elmer "Gloomy Gus" Henderson was irate and asked Bezdek
about the delay. The Penn State coach said the bus was caught in a
traffic jam. Henderson didn't buy the excuse. The coaches then shouted at
each other and almost came to blows.</TE>
<TE>   According to Joe Hendrickson's book, "The Tournament of Roses," the
game didn't start until 3:05 p.m. and finished "by the light of the
moon."</TE>

<HD>Big Red Washed Away in Rose Bowl Deluge</HD>

<LD>I suppose Miami could have been intimidated, surrounded by all that
red in the Rose Bowl when they arrived for the BCS championship game, the
goofy Nebraska fans dressed from head to toe in the stuff and cleverly
screaming: "Go Big Red."</LD>
<LD>   But knowing the Nebraskans probably wash their clothes as most of us
do, the Hurricanes could look at every one of the Cornhusker supporters
with confidence knowing they were all wearing pink underwear.</LD>
<LD>   I had no idea, however, the Hurricanes would go on to treat the
Cornhuskers as if they were all wearing pink tutus.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LET ME just say I wasn't intimidated by the red horde. I had received
hundreds, if not thousands, of e-mails from Nebraska fans, many of them
asking to meet me in the parking lot before the game. But I waded right
into the heart of the Big Red tailgate party--press pass flapping in the
breeze--and introduced myself to everyone as Bill Dwyre, sports editor of
The Times.</TE>
<TE>   I've always wanted to feel what it'd be like to be Dwyre for a day
anyway, but then that would have meant doing nothing all day long, and I
still had a column to write.</TE>
<TE>   Before I went back to work, one man in a red shirt called out what he
thought was my name, and identified himself as a Laker season-ticket
holder--introducing me to his friend, a Nebraska fan, as "that" Page Two
columnist in the local paper. His friend gripped my hand as though he was
getting ready to apply handcuffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen you sitting down in the media seats at the Laker games,"
said the Laker season-ticket holder. "I'm surprised you're out here; I
thought you'd be afraid of these people kicking your butt."</TE>
<TE>   I asked him if he would keep his voice down, but he kept referring to
me as "T.J.," like some Michael Buffer wannabe, and I probably wouldn't
have corrected him had a group of Nebraska fans nearby not turned their
attention our way. I realized they were in a long line for "sweet corn"
and how important that might be to them, but several of them also looked
as if they could afford to miss a few meals and were seriously interested
in joining our conversation.</TE>
<TE>   OK, so I was probably a little rude, and maybe even crude to the Laker
season-ticket holder, but I had to set him straight. And what the
heck--today he's telling his friends, "You won't believe how rude and
crude Bill Dwyre can be."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AT THIS time I would like to applaud the editors at The Times for no
longer running the pictures of columnists in the newspaper. I think it
was a very healthy decision.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I STOOD alongside a woman in a Denver Bronco sweater trying to sell a
pair of $150 tickets to the game for $125 each, and getting no takers for
almost two hours.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of guys in Raider hats appeared interested, but she said she
wouldn't sell the tickets to Raider fans.</TE>
<TE>   I think it should be a universal policy not to sell Raider fans
tickets to any sporting event, thereby making this world a safer place.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   INSIDE THE Rose Bowl, Nebraska fans chose not to sit down, and while I
have no idea if this had anything to do with the fear of potential rump
displacement--given the stadium's narrow seats--I hope it wasn't some
kind of Cornhusker tradition in which they all wait for their team to
score.</TE>
<TE>   The Cornhuskers just scored, and the fans are still standing--I hope
they're not waiting for Nebraska to take the lead.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MY QUESTION is, if they turned their TVs off in Nebraska when the game
turned ugly, then what did they do?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I REMEMBER wondering after the U.S. hockey team's 1980 win over the
Soviets if we would ever hear again from those poor guys when they
returned to the Soviet Union and had to explain what happened. Now I
wonder if we'll ever hear from Eric Crouch again.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I COVERED the San Diego Chargers when Kellen Winslow was catching
passes; now I'm covering games with Kellen Winslow making back-to-back
jarring tackles on kickoffs for Miami. And I really haven't gotten any
older.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-5, 210-pound younger Winslow is a freshman wide receiver
for the Hurricanes who caught two passes for 34 yards, while working
mostly on special teams. If he's anything like his father, though, by the
time he leaves Miami, he'll be almost unstoppable and the best talker on
the team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW WE know the final score of the Super Bowl if the Rams played the
Chargers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN I ran into Diane Millard, a good California girl, I had to ask
her about her decision to marry Jeff Millard, wondering if her vision of
Prince Charming growing up included walking hand-in-hand with this hick
from Omaha wearing a piece of yellow foam rubber on his head shaped like
a piece of corn.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the fact he's courageous enough to walk around looking like
that," she said, and as an added benefit, she doesn't have to worry about
another woman making a play for her man.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LOS ANGELES is becoming a magnet for oddball fans--the Cornhuskers
leaving and being replaced by figure skating aficionados for next week's
championship competition in Staples Center. There's nothing like the
mayhem of figure skating, and I know this, Tonya Harding has a lot more
fight in her than any of these guys from Nebraska, so I'm hoping she
makes an appearance.</TE>
<TE>   After that, of course, we get the NHL All-Star game, which is why I
have plans to go to New Orleans for the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Traci Batman:</TE>
<TE>   "I think you owe the people of Nebraska an apology."</TE>
<TE>   Sorry--to see you go. No need to write.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: Cornhusker fan Rusty Justice of Gering, Neb., took the 'ears
of corn'                    concept a little too far before Thursday
night's Rose Bowl game. But at least he had a really big hat to conceal
them.</CP>

<LD>Bad bowl system. Four lousy games.</LD>
<LD>  One great team.</LD>
<LD>  There's one indisputable fact after the BCS dragged to its conclusion
at the Rose Bowl on Thursday night: the Miami Hurricanes deserve to be
national champions.</LD>
<TE>  As they did during the season, they looked dominant at times, showed
flashes of sheer brilliance, made some mistakes, but came through
whenever they had to.</TE>
<TE>  They beat Nebraska, 37-14. For the record, that gave the victors in the
four non-tournament, ill-conceived BCS games an aggregate 178-90 score
against the losers. Nice system.</TE>
<TE>  But just as it wasn't Nebraska's fault that the bugs in the BCS
computers delivered them to Pasadena, it wasn't the Hurricanes' fault
that they had an unworthy opponent.</TE>
<TE>  Let the Oregon Ducks quack all they want that they were cheated out of
a chance to play the Hurricanes. Their beef is legitimate. But so is
Miami.</TE>
<TE>  All Oregon would have had was the right to be the runner-up.</TE>
<TE>  "Oregon could say they ought to be here," Miami linebacker D.J.
Williams said. "But to say they'd be champions ... they've got to beat us
first."</TE>
<TE>  Twelve other teams got their shot, and none could do it.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if there's anybody as balanced as Miami is," Nebraska
Coach Frank Solich said. "I think anybody would have struggled with them
if they're on top of their game they way they were tonight."</TE>
<TE>  Everything worked for the Canes. The offensive line gave quarterback
Ken Dorsey all the time he needed to make his decisions. It was as
hassle-free as online shopping. In turn, Dorsey made life easy for his
receivers, dropping the ball right in their hands.</TE>
<TE>  The only thing Dorsey could have used was some diversity training. He
kept going to the same two guys, Andre Johnson and Jeremy Shockey, in the
first half. But Johnson was constantly open and Shockey's a big target,
so you can't blame Dorsey.</TE>
<TE>  Running back Clinton Portis showed everyone why he's one of the most
valuable players in football. Do 104 rushing yards, a touchdown and 26
receiving yards work for you? He had almost 100 more yards of offense and
another touchdown wiped out by penalties.</TE>
<TE>  Here's how devastating Miami can be when it gets rolling: The
Hurricanes scored 27 points while using only 12 offensive plays in the
second quarter. (The defense chipped in with a 47-yard interception
return for a TD.)</TE>
<TE>  Some things need to be experienced live to get the full effect.</TE>
<TE>  The size of the Grand Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   The roar of Niagara Falls.</TE>
<TE>   And the speed of the Miami Hurricanes.</TE>
<TE>  They zoomed into the end zone, and on defense they ran down quarterback
Eric Crouch like he stole something.</TE>
<TE>  "This is the fastest football team I've been around," Coach Larry Coker
said.</TE>
<TE>  Nebraska averaged 314.7 yards per game. Even in the 62-36 Colorado
debacle, the Cornhuskers gained 354 yards on the ground.</TE>
<TE>  The Cornhuskers had 259 total yards Thursday, and many of those came
long after the outcome was decided.</TE>
<TE>  The Cornhuskers thought they could do their option thing against Miami,
because the Hurricanes hadn't faced a team that ran the option as often
and as well as Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>  Well, Nebraska didn't face a defense like Miami's. The Hurricanes are
so fast, you simply can't run outside on them. No. Not having it.</TE>
<TE>  And when Crouch managed to burst through to the secondary, they ended
his show early.</TE>
<TE>  Crouch had one run that probably goes for a 65-yard touchdown in the
Big 12. Against Miami, it netted only 15 yards before all-world safety Ed
Reed ran him down.</TE>
<TE>  The final score didn't give the true indication of the extent of the
blowout. The Hurricanes lost some focus after taking a 34-0 halftime
lead, and two penalties created the second chances that led to both
Nebraska touchdowns. (They were penalized 12 times for 85 yards overall.)</TE>
<TE>  The tell-tale sign of how Miami controlled things came with 1:39 left
on the clock. The Miami equipment crew folded up the kicking nets along
the sideline and opened boxes of national championship caps and T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>  At the other end of the Hurricanes bench, Andre Johnson, who had seven
catches for a crazy 199 yards and two touchdowns, was holding an
impromptu news conference.</TE>
<TE>  It was pretty much the only talking the Hurricanes did during the game.</TE>
<TE>  "I'm not a guy that talks trash," Johnson said. "If somebody says
something to me, I might talk back. But they weren't saying nothing."</TE>
<TE>  "For them, and for us, it was mostly business," offensive lineman Ed
Wilkins said.</TE>
<TE>  "Everybody was focusing on the task at hand. We really didn't have a
lot to say to each other."</TE>
<TE>  If this Hurricane team plays like the Miami program that wreaked havoc
on college football in the 80s and early 90s, it sure doesn't act like
them. Much more quiet. And no criminal activity, unless it counted as
trespassing when they rushed the set of "ESPN's College Gameday." They
had no personal fouls among their penalties, as opposed to 11 years ago
when they had nine personal fouls at the Cotton Bowl.</TE>
<TE>  Coker said he's happiest for this group of players "Because of what
they're all about. That's going to carry over a lot more in life than
maybe just winning a championship."</TE>
<TE>  There's nothing controversial about this team. Don't let the bad system
detract from their championship. At least there's no split title. Miami
is the only undefeated team.</TE>
<TE>  "No controversy," cornerback Phillip Buchanan cornerback. "If we would
have played anybody, we would have won the game."</TE>
<TE>  It wasn't quite picture perfect on the Rose Bowl floor, with the scenic
backdrop enshrouded by darkness some 31/2 hours after sunset.</TE>
<TE>  "I can't see the mountains right now," Buchanan said. "I was pretty
sure they'd be a little better. But we won the game. I'm satisfied."</TE>

<HD>Second (Quarter) to None for Hurricanes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry Stewart</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First Quarter</LD>
<LD>   Scoring: Miami 7, Nebraska 0: Johnson, 49-yard pass from Dorsey at
6:51. One play. PAT--Todd Sievers (kick).</LD>
<LD>   Impact player: Andre Williams, a 6-foot-4, 260-pound junior defensive
end, made two big stops on Nebraska's first possession. After the
Hurricanes managed only one first down after taking the opening kickoff,
the Cornhuskers started at their 34. On second and eight, Williams
limited I-back Dahrran Diedrick to one yard going up the middle. On the
next play, Eric Crouch appeared to have an opening on the left side but
Williams seemed to come out of nowhere to drop Crouch for a one-yard
loss, and Nebraska had to punt.</LD>
<TE>   Missed opportunity: Cornerback Keyuo Craver's interception gave the
Cornhuskers a first down at their 33 and a pass from Crouch to Tracey
Wistrom gained 18 to the Miami 49. Two plays later, linebacker D.J.
Williams tackled Crouch and caused a fumble that was recovered by Miami
lineman William Joseph at the Nebraska 49. Miami scored on the next play,
with Ken Dorsey throwing a strike to Andre Johnson streaking down the
right sideline.</TE>
<TE>   Did you notice? Crouch threw only three passes in the first quarter.
He had five rushes for 23 yards, but take away one nice run he had for 27
yards and you're left with minus yardage.</TE>
<TE>   Best number: Jeremy Shockey, Miami's leading receiver, had only two
catches but one went for 20 yards and the other for 22 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Worst number: Nebraska fumbled twice, and lost both.</TE>
<TE>Second Quarter</TE>
<TE>   Scoring: Miami 14, Nebraska 0: Portis, 39-yard run at 14:33. 86 yards,
five plays. PAT--Sievers (kick).</TE>
<TE>   Miami 21, Nebraska 0: Lewis, 47-yard interception return at 12:52.
PAT--Sievers (kick).</TE>
<TE>   Miami 27, Nebraska 0: Shockey, 21-yard pass from Dorsey at 10:40. 66
yards, two plays. PAT--Kick failed.</TE>
<TE>   Miami 34, Nebraska 0: Johnson, eight-yard pass from Dorsey at 3:35. 55
yards, seven plays. PAT--Sievers (kick).</TE>
<TE>   Impact player: Clinton Portis, who had only 17 yards in six carries,
started the second quarter with a bang. On the third play, he went to his
left, almost fell down, cut back to his right and ran 39 yards for a
touchdown that set the tone for the Hurricanes' dominant quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Missed opportunity: There sure weren't many for Miami, and nothing
went right for Nebraska. After Portis' touchdown, Nebraska ran three
plays, then on third down a Crouch pass intended for Wistrom was
intercepted by James Lewis, who returned it 47 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Did you notice? Crouch finished the first half with two completions in
seven attempts for 22 yards. Dorsey was 12 for 20 for 258 yards and three
touchdowns. Dorsey's 21-yard touchdown pass to Shockey made the score
27-0 with 10:40 left in the half.</TE>
<TE>   Best number: Miami had 320 total yards by halftime, Nebraska 119.</TE>
<TE>   Worst number: The number of Nebraska fans who came to the game.</TE>
<TE>Third Quarter</TE>
<TE>   Scoring: Miami 34, Nebraska 7: Judd Davies, 16-yard run at 2:39. 68
yards, 11 plays. PAT--Josh Brown (kick).</TE>
<TE>   Impact player: Through three quarters, Dorsey had completed 17 of 29
passes for a school bowl record of 324 yards. The old mark of 321 yards
was set by George Mira in the 1962 Gotham Bowl, also against Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   Missed opportunity: Miami entered the second half 12 points from a
school record for most points in a bowl game and got none in the third
quarter. The record of 46 was set against Texas in the 1991 Cotton Bowl
and tied against North Carolina State in the 1998 Micron PC Bowl. The
first time the Hurricanes had the ball in the quarter, they were moving
downfield when a holding penalty nullified a nine-yard gain on a screen
pass to Portis. But a pass to Kevin Beard gained 22 and Miami was rolling
again. But the drive stalled and Sievers missed a 49-yard field-goal try
wide right.</TE>
<TE>   Did you notice? Crouch completed one of three passes in the quarter
and had only 41 passing yards through three quarters. Coming into the
game, the Nebraska record for fewest passing yards in a bowl game was 108
in the 1955 Orange Bowl. Crouch did have 66 yards rushing in 19 carries
through three quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Best number: Nebraska held Portis to 16 yards in six carries in the
third quarter and, better yet, held Miami to no points.</TE>
<TE>   Worst number: Nebraska being outgained, 410 total yards to 185,
through three quarters.</TE>
<TE>Fourth Quarter</TE>
<TE>   Scoring: Miami 34, Nebraska 14: Groce, 71-yard punt return at 14:28.
PAT--Brown (kick).</TE>
<TE>   Miami 37, Nebraska 14: Sievers, 37-yard field goal at 10:04. 59 yards,
11 plays.</TE>
<TE>   Impact player: Sophomore receiver Johnson was named co-player of the
game along with Dorsey. It was Johnson's best game of the season, as he
finished with seven catches for 199 yards and two touchdowns. Coming into
the game, Johnson was the team's second-leading receiver behind Shockey
with 37 catches and he led the team with 685 receiving yards. He averaged
62 receiving yards a game and 18.4 yards a catch.</TE>
<TE>   Missed opportunity: It appeared briefly that the Cornhuskers had a
chance to get back in the game. On the first play of the fourth quarter,
a Miami punt went out of bounds at the 12. But because of a holding
penalty, Miami had to punt again. This time, Nebraska's DeJuan Groce
returned it 71 yards for a touchdown and suddenly the Nebraska throng had
something to cheer about. But Miami came back with a time-consuming drive
that ended with a 37-yard field goal, and that was that.</TE>
<TE>   Did you notice? On Nebraska's final series, Crouch, after completing a
pass to Wilson Thomas, threw four consecutive incomplete passes.</TE>
<TE>   Best number: The game ended at 8:34 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Worst number: Crouch finished five for 15 for 62 yards with one
interception and no touchdowns. He did have 114 yards rushing.</TE>

<LD>The Nebraska fans answered weakly to what Wisconsin Cheeseheads
have given the sports world, with their three-cornered foam-rubber chunks
of cheese that also hold three cans of beer. Several Cornhusker fans
walked around the Rose Bowl with foam cornhusks pointing up and out from
their heads. Stupid-looking and no place to store your beer.</LD>
<LD>   "Anyone who owns one is part of the Cornhead nation," said Bryan
Altman, a Nebraska student. "They're not standard issue, but we're
everywhere and our numbers are growing every day."</LD>
<LD>  Altman said he had to put his Cornhead through X-ray machines at three
airports on his way to Southern California.</LD>
<TE>   "It keeps your head warm in Lincoln," he said of the Husker Hat. "It
gets a little sweaty out here. That's why I shaved my head."</TE>
<TE>   Final headgear score: Badgers 1, Cornhuskers 0.</TE>

<HD>Bellotti Ducks BCS Controversy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Bellotti, coach of the Oregon team that felt it should have
been in the national championship game at the Rose Bowl rather than
Nebraska, tried his best to be magnanimous Thursday night and nearly
pulled it off.</LD>
<LD>  Bellotti, whose team finished 11-1 and second in both major polls but
wasn't picked to play in the title game when the computer conglomerate
that determines the matchup of No. 1 vs. No. 2 spit out Nebraska instead
of the Ducks, had originally referred to this bowl championship series as
"a bad disease, like cancer." That assessment, as hyperbolic as it was,
took on additional credibility when Oregon routed Colorado, 38-16, in the
Fiesta Bowl on New Year's Day. That was the same Colorado team that had
made mincemeat out of Nebraska a month or so ago.</LD>
<LD>  So when Bellotti met with a few reporters just after halftime Thursday
night, with Miami coasting along after its 34-0 first-half explosion, the
temptation was to say, "I told you so."</LD>
<TE>  Instead, Bellotti tiptoed around a bit, saying, "Yes, this is
frustrating. Miami is a talented team, but, yes, we'd like to have had a
shot at them. We would have liked to have had a chance to do something
here."</TE>
<TE>  Bellotti also said, "The polls had us No.2 for a reason, and our
passing game would have given us a chance here."</TE>
<TE>  He was asked about the apparent discrepancy in speed between fleet
Miami and lumbering Nebraska and he said, "We were considered to be a
fast team."</TE>
<TE>  Giving credit to both Miami and Nebraska as highly talented, he added,
"Knowing how close we were, it is still a heartbreak thing."</TE>
<TE>Wartime Effort</TE>
<TE>  Today, our Marines are serving in Afghanistan. But when the Rose Bowl
was in its youth, they were also serving as some of the best football
teams in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland freelance writer Dennis Cavagnaro points out that the fourth
and fifth Rose Bowls were not won by college teams but by the Marines.</TE>
<TE>   "The time was 1917, WWI, and throughout the country, many universities
suspended football," Cavagnaro writes. "With President Woodrow Wilson's
encouragement, 'I don't see how such a celebration would interfere with
the government's war activities,' the Tournament of Roses was able to
continue the still-young tradition of the Rose Bowl football game, the
nation's first bowl game, and, at that time, the nation's only bowl game.</TE>
<TE>  "Many of the universities--Michigan, Pitt, Georgia Tech, Ohio State,
Washington State--were considered, but they demurred. The tournament's
football committee then took Uncle Sam into partnership, not the least
reason being that he had the corner on the nation's football players."</TE>
<TE>  The Rose Bowl yearbooks report that the 1918 game was won, 9-7, by "The
Marines" over Camp Lewis, an Army team. Those "Marines" were, in fact,
mostly Ducks, many of whom had helped Oregon defeat Penn in the previous
Rose Bowl, 14-0. After that, they had reported for duty at Marine
Barracks, Naval Shipyard, Mare Island, near Vallejo. The next city north
of the camp was Napa.</TE>
<TE>  The 1918 game was played in 86-degree heat, before an estimated crowd
of 20,000, and the Mare Island coach was, naturally, Oregon's coach, Hugo
Bezdek, who actually was brought in late in the season to advise the
coach in name, right tackle John Beckett.</TE>
<TE>  After their victory, the Mare Island Marines, who scored first by
drop-kicking a field goal, were given three days' leave before heading
off to war. Each winning player also got a kiss from the commanding
officer's wife.</TE>
<TE>  Of the players taking part in that game, nearly half were eventually
killed in either World War I or World War II.</TE>
<TE>  The Mare Island Marines returned to play in the 1919 Rose Bowl, but
with an entirely different team. The war had just ended and Mare Island
was 10-0.</TE>
<TE>  But its opponent was a Great Lakes Naval Station team from the Chicago
area that had played a tougher schedule of college teams and had defeated
Northwestern, Illinois, Notre Dame, Iowa, Rutgers and Purdue, as well as
the U.S. Naval Academy.</TE>
<TE>  Among the stars of that Great Lakes team was one George Halas, who
intercepted a pass in the Rose Bowl game, played before 27,000 in cold
weather, and led his team to a 17-0 victory over Mare Island.</TE>
<TE>  The incentive for Great Lakes in this one was even larger than a
three-day pass and a kiss from the CO's wife. For a Rose Bowl victory,
the Great Lakes team members were promised early discharges.</TE>
<TE>Scholarly Leader</TE>
<TE>  He wasn't George Halas, but 56 years later, a star player of a
different kind led his team, the USC Trojans, to a Rose Bowl victory and
a national championship by throwing "the best pass I ever threw" in a
career that included many great ones on both the college and pro level.</TE>
<TE>  His name was Pat Haden and he remains among the more celebrated and
also least likely heroes of Rose Bowl lore.</TE>
<TE>  The year was 1975, and the happenings of the '74 season put USC in the
Rose Bowl against Ohio State, the Trojans needing a win and a later
victory that New Year's Day by Notre Dame over Alabama in the Orange Bowl
to claim a national title for Coach John McKay.</TE>
<TE>   In the closing moments of the '75 Rose Bowl game, USC had crossed into
Ohio State territory and had held onto the ball when Allan Carter made a
key run on fourth and one. With time running out, McKay called Haden to
the sideline and called "67X corner" to his son, receiver J.K. McKay.</TE>
<TE>  "That was a pass to the corner that J.K. and I had been running since
we were both 15 years old," Haden recalled. "I knew it was his favorite
route and I liked the call right away."</TE>
<TE>  Haden, now a prominent businessman in Los Angeles and a nationally
known sportscaster, is among the leaders in the sports world in sense of
humor and self-effacing fun. But he recalls this moment with pride and
fondness.</TE>
<TE>  "It was a magical moment, probably the best pass I ever threw in my
life," he said. "It had to travel 45 yards or so in the air--it was about
a 35-yard scoring play, and it had a couple of yards' window to get over
the defender and still get to J.K. before he went out of bounds.</TE>
<TE>  "There was just so much going on at that moment. This was my longtime
best friend that I was hooking up with, in the Rose Bowl, possibly for a
national championship. And I also thought this would be my last football
game. I had already been picked for the Rhodes scholarship and I knew I
was heading overseas for that and I didn't expect a pro career to follow.
So this was the moment."</TE>
<TE>  The ball got to McKay in the corner of the end zone, USC went for the
two-point conversion that it would take to beat Ohio State, and Haden's
pass to Shelton Diggs in the back of the end zone was good for an 18-17
victory. Later, the Trojans watched Notre Dame beat Alabama, and the
national title was theirs.</TE>
<TE>  Haden also remembered the play and the moment with some sadness.</TE>
<TE>  "The guy covering on the play was Ohio State's star defensive back,
Neal Colzie," Haden said. "I just read recently [in August] where he
died."</TE>
<TE>Golf Anyone?</TE>
<TE>  You say you have an 8 a.m. tee time at Brookside Golf Course today, and
all your friends are laughing at you? Can't be playing golf just hours
after they have parked 35,000 cars on the golf course around the Rose
Bowl for Thursday's national title game, right?</TE>
<TE>  "We'll play. Always have after games, always will," said John Wells,
director of golf at the two 18-hole layouts around the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>  Wells said that, although the course will play fine today and over the
weekend, it will not recover totally for at least a week.</TE>
<TE>  "They do a great job of parking the cars," he said. "They keep them off
the greens and tees and do the best they can to not park cars in the
natural landing areas on each hole."</TE>
<TE>  And if your natural landing area is 125 yards off the tee?</TE>
<TE>  Wells just smiled.</TE>
<TE>More Golf</TE>
<TE>  Wells was as interested in the purchasing power crowding his pro shop
before the game as he was with his course's shape.</TE>
<TE>  "We'll do maybe $70,000 in here today," he said.</TE>
<TE>  That would make up for the UCLA Saturdays when his shop is closed,
because there is no interest in merchandising then. Wells also said that
his shop had special national championship shirts ready for sale
immediately after the game. Half of them will be thrown away, of course.</TE>
<TE>  "The rules say I can't show what they look like before the game," he
said, "but we are telling everybody who comes through that we are open
afterward."</TE>
<TE>Lining Up</TE>
<TE>  Less than an hour before game time, the areas around the entrances were
people-choked. That was caused by extremely tight security. Nobody was
allowed to enter without a thorough check and, in most cases, a pat-down.
The wait to just get to the turnstile was at least 45 minutes, if you
were lucky.</TE>
<TE>  One security guard said that the handicapped entrance became quite
popular.</TE>
<TE>  "One guy tried to fake having asthma, breathing heavy and gasping," the
guard said. "He was a terrible actor. We didn't let him in."</TE>
<TE>Consolation Prize</TE>
<TE>  Nebraska running back Dahrran Diedrick summed up his disappointment in
losing the national title: "We're going home without a ring. We get
nothing but a watch."</TE>
<TE>   Diedrick was already wearing a very nice watch.</TE>
<TE>At Least It Wasn't a Shutout</TE>
<TE>  Nebraska quarterback Eric Crouch said the final score was "a credit to
our team. It could have been worse than that."</TE>
<TE>They're Good Citizens too</TE>
<TE>  During the postgame awards ceremony, ABC announcer Lynn Swann asked
Miami Coach Larry Coker what played a bigger role in the Hurricanes'
undefeated season: talent, speed or character.</TE>
<TE>   Coker didn't hesitate, and said, "No doubt about it--character."</TE>
<TE>   That seemed a little odd, because there are probably a couple dozen
teams out there that excel in character but couldn't stay with the
Hurricanes on the field--like Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   "It says a lot about our character the way we came back in the second
half against Colorado and Miami," Crouch said.</TE>
<TE>   More character in the first half apparently is the answer to overall
success.</TE>
<TE>More Than One Way to See It</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska defensive end Chris Kelsay didn't take kindly to the
suggestion the Cornhuskers had played poorly. "I don't think it's an
embarrassing loss. Miami is good."</TE>
<TE>Packing Them In</TE>
<TE>  The 93,781 at the Rose Bowl made for the largest crowd Nebraska has
ever played before. The previous record was an estimated 92,000 that saw
the Cornhuskers lose to Stanford in the 1941 Rose Bowl, 21-13.</TE>
<TE>  The largest crowd Miami has played in front of was 105,834 on Sept. 17,
1988, at Michigan. The Hurricanes won, 31-30.</TE>
<TE>Vociferous</TE>
<TE>  Gates at the Rose Bowl opened at 3 p.m. The first "Go Big Red" chant
inside the stadium began at 3:30.</TE>
<TE>That's Why They Were No. 1</TE>
<TE>  Nebraska is 1-10 when playing teams ranked No. 1 in the nation. The
Cornhuskers' only victory over a top-ranked team was a 17-14 Big Eight
Conference victory over Oklahoma in 1978.</TE>
<TE>Sore Toe and All</TE>
<TE>  Shaquille O'Neal, who graduated from Louisiana State, wore a green and
orange Hurricane jacket while standing on the Miami sideline. He watched
the game along with former Hurricanes Lamar Thomas, Cortez Kennedy,
Russell Maryland, Gino Torretta, Dan Stubbs and Damone Lewis.</TE>
<TE>End of a Career</TE>
<TE>  Harriman Cronk, who worked for more than four decades as a member of
the Tournament of Roses Committee and most recently chairman of the
football committee, has retired.</TE>

<LD> Whoa, Nellie, but didn't the bowl championship series drop one big
ol' ugly dawg on the Rose Bowl Thursday night?</LD>
<LD>   "It's 34 to nothing with 3:35 to play," Keith Jackson said, and he was
talking about the first half, not the game, "and it's quiet at the Rose
Bowl."</LD>
<LD>   So quiet you could hear a Nebraska fumble drop.</LD>
<TE>   So quiet you could hear ABC's Nielsen ratings go screaming into the
night.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for Jackson, Tim Brant and the rest of ABC's luckless
broadcast crew, they couldn't switch over to "Everybody Loves Raymond."
No, they were stuck with "Nobody Wants Nebraska," same as the Granddaddy
of Them All, and there was no saving any of them.</TE>
<TE>   If the Cornhuskers were going down, and they were, faster than you
could say "Oregon Got Jobbed," they were taking people with them.</TE>
<TE>   Given half a championship matchup, the Rose Bowl and ABC didn't even
get half a championship game. Nebraska fell out of it so early, so
swiftly, that Jackson and Brant were down to interviewing one another by
the second quarter and telling stories about the officiating crew by the
third.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you surprised," Brant asked Jackson at 27-0,"by what happened?"</TE>
<TE>   Jackson: "Yes I am."</TE>
<TE>   Brant: "I am too."</TE>
<TE>   No one bothered to poll the 50,000 Nebraska fans slumping in their
Rose Bowl seats, although ABC certainly had enough time to kill.</TE>
<TE>   Brant: "Right now, the Nebraska fans sound like they're at the
library."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson: "They probably feel like it."</TE>
<TE>   Read this: Combining their four quarters against Colorado and their
first two against Miami, the Cornhuskers were in the process of being
outscored, 96-26, in their six most important quarters of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Brant was feeling sorry for them.</TE>
<TE>   He tried to buck up their sagging spirits.</TE>
<TE>   "Keith, I think right now it is critical that the Cornhuskers don't
panic."</TE>
<TE>   It was 27-0, Miami had played only 21 minutes, and the Hurricanes were
driving for more.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, from the Big Red perspective, in 112 years of playing
football, there'd never been a better time to panic.</TE>
<TE>   Soon it was 34-0, halftime had come and gone (worth noting: the
Nebraska band held Miami scoreless) and Jackson and Brant had two
quarters of garbage time to plow through.</TE>
<TE>   Six minutes into the second half, Jackson decided to read off the
roster of the game officials. Brant talked about how he had breakfast
with one member of the crew. Jackson studied a camera close-up of referee
Courtney Mauzy and observed, "Well, Courtney ought to be happy. It's
snowing in North Carolina, he lives in Little Switzerland and the
Christmas trees are growin'!"</TE>
<TE>   That took care of 30 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Time left to play in the third quarter: 8:25.</TE>
<TE>   Seizing upon a theme, ABC had half a good idea for a halftime
interview: Bring in Oregon Coach Mike Bellotti for a few comments.</TE>
<TE>   Bellotti's Ducks had just defeated Colorado by 22 points in the Fiesta
Bowl, and Colorado had beaten Nebraska by 26 points. But the BCS
computers anointed Nebraska, not Oregon, and with the Cornhuskers behind
again by 34 points, Bellotti was the obvious go-to guy.</TE>
<TE>   John Saunders teed it up for the coach: "I think most people would
agree that your school belonged here before Nebraska. If that wasn't
evident before the game, it is evident at halftime."</TE>
<TE>   Yes? Yes? Saunders had it all set up, Bellotti was primed and ready to
vent, but the follow-through was a soft step backward, a pulled punch.</TE>
<TE>   "What," Saunders asked, "can you do to tweak this system and the BCS?"</TE>
<TE>   Tweak the system? How about tweaking the question and asking Bellotti
if he felt his Ducks were robbed, if he felt college football fans were
robbed, if he felt anyone anywhere needed more evidence that the BCS
should be junked immediately and replaced by a national playoff.</TE>
<TE>   But those weren't the questions Bellotti heard, so he replied,
blandly, that "I do think it would have been nice for us to get the
chance and the opportunity to be here. The polls had us here.... The
computers did not. Maybe as Terry [Bowden] said, maybe we only use the
computer if it's tied or it's not 1 and 2 clear-cut."</TE>
<TE>   Miami tailback Clinton Portis danced around Nebraska defenders all
evening, but he had nothing on ABC when it came to sidestepping trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Scant mention of the BCS controversy was made during the broadcast,
other than Jackson sounding a little annoyed about it during his pregame
comments.</TE>
<TE>   "Nebraska has been picked on, they feel, [with] people criticizing in
the wake of their loss to Colorado," Jackson said before holding a hand
to his chin. "They are up to \o7 here\f7  with it."</TE>
<TE>   With two minutes left in the game, Brant implied that Miami's 37-14
victory had vindicated the BCS.</TE>
<TE>   "All those critics that have been yelling and screaming about what a
sham the BCS is--there is no question in my mind Miami is the one and
only national champion this year," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Well, yes and no.</TE>
<TE>   Miami, the only undefeated team in the country, might be the
undisputed champion--but that's no endorsement for the BCS. If the goal
of the BCS is to put the two most qualified teams in the title game, and
the BCS had Oregon only No. 4 behind Nebraska and Colorado, then the BCS
remains a sham and nothing but.</TE>
<TE>   The BCS just got lucky, is all. Unlike ABC, the Rose Bowl and a
national television audience that deserved better.</TE>

<HD>Dorsey Takes the Grand Prize</HD>
<DH>Quarterbacks: After watching Crouch win several major awards, Miami
star's consolation is a national title.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They are life partners. Eric Crouch of Nebraska took the Heisman
Trophy to have and to hold, till death do them part.</LD>
<LD>   Ken Dorsey of Miami, a single man, has something more lasting.
Something eternal. A season for the ages, his team unbeaten, untied,
unbowed.</LD>
<LD>   No regrets. Just a performance as close to perfection as a 20-year-old
beanpole from Orinda, Calif., can rightfully expect.</LD>
<TE>   Dorsey passed for 362 yards and three touchdowns in the Hurricanes'
37-14 victory in the Rose Bowl on Thursday night. He completed 22 of 35
passes and was hardly touched by Cornhusker rushers, let alone sacked.</TE>
<TE>   "We just won the national championship of college football," Dorsey
said, letting out the nervous giggle of a kid who can't quite believe
what he accomplished.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Crouch addressed what got away.</TE>
<TE>   "They blew us out early, they stopped our running game and put us in
third and long all day," he said. "They were better. Ken is a tremendous
player, a team player and I'm just happy I got to know him the last two
months at all the awards functions."</TE>
<TE>   The Nebraska senior emerged the winner at most of those. But in this
game, the difference between the quarterbacks was so dramatic, it was
hard to imagine that Crouch outpointed Dorsey in Heisman voting, 770 to
638, with Florida's Rex Grossman wedged between them.</TE>
<TE>   Crouch was a study in wasted motion. He huffed and puffed, ran in
circles, dropped the ball and threw it away--all, it seemed, between the
30-yard lines.</TE>
<TE>   He rushed for 114 yards in 22 carries, but 37 came on a meaningless
fourth-quarter run and he lost yardage on several option keepers and
scrambles. And most egregiously, he fumbled midway through the first
quarter and threw an interception that was returned by James Lewis for a
touchdown that keyed a 27-point, second-quarter Hurricane blitz.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Dorsey was a portrait of unruffled precision, like dad
carving the holiday turkey. When he wasn't rifling balls down the middle
to tight end Jeremy Shockey, he was hitting Andre Johnson with long
passes.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson made a 49-yard catch and run for the only score of the first
quarter, then he and Dorsey really went to work in the second quarter.
They hooked up on a 34-yard gain to open the quarter, and two plays later
Clinton Portis dashed 39 yards for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Two minutes later Miami went 66 yards in two pass plays, a 45-yarder
to Johnson and a 21-yarder to Shockey. Miami had one last possession in
the half and Dorsey completed four in a row, the last an eight-yard
touchdown to Johnson for a 34-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   At game's end, Dorsey and Johnson, the co-most valuable players, stood
on a platform, soaking in the moment.</TE>
<TE>   "The entire team deserves the MVP award," said Dorsey, adding that he
will return to Miami for his senior season.</TE>
<TE>   Crouch has only memories. And because what you've done lately seems to
matter most, a sour ending eclipsed four years of shining moments.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that he is one of three Division I quarterbacks to pass for
4,000 yards and rush for 3,000 in his career, that he is the 13th
quarterback to pass and rush for 1,000 yards in a single season, that he
won a school-record 34 games as a starter? On Thursday, they were merely
a jumble of numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Fresh in everyone's mind was Nebraska blowing its chance at an
unbeaten season by losing to Colorado, 62-36, despite Crouch piling up
huge numbers in a catch-up role. Then this embarrassing loss to Miami
with Crouch completing only five of 15 passes for 62 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had a tremendous career at Nebraska," he said. "I've learned a
lot about who I am and who I want to be. I'll never have a chance to
experience this again, and despite the way it ended, it was great."</TE>
<TE>   Greater still for Dorsey, who broke Miami's bowl record of 321 passing
yards set by George Mira against Nebraska in the 1962 Gotham Bowl. The
unassuming kid who doesn't blush when his mother gives him a peck on the
cheek is as large a part of Hurricane lore as Jim Kelly, Bernie Kosar and
Heisman winners Vinny Testaverde and Gino Torretta.</TE>
<TE>   As for Dorsey's Heisman chase, there's always next year.</TE>
<TE>   But Crouch can tell Dorsey all about the relative value of awards. In
addition to the Heisman, he won the Walter Camp Award and the Davey
O'Brien Trophy.</TE>
<TE>   He'd gladly trade them all for a single day in Dorsey's life--a day
neither will forget.</TE>

<KH>THE SEASON IN REVIEW</KH>
<HD>Gloom and Glory</HD>
<DH>It Began With Tragedy, Saw Paterno Triumph and Had Computers
Confuse</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>10 SORROWFUL PROLOGUE</LD>
<LD>   The season opened with a disturbing trend of players from high school
to the pros perishing on the field. Rashidi Wheeler, a Northwestern
senior safety from La Verne Damien High, died of an asthma attack during
rigorous, unsupervised preseason conditioning drills Aug. 3. That was two
days after the death of Korey Stringer, a Minnesota Viking lineman who
suffered heatstroke at the team's training camp. Those deaths set off
alarms throughout football about training procedures and the use of diet
supplements.</LD>
<TE>9 GRIEF AND CONFUSION</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA does not have the authority to postpone regular-season games,
which left the 11 Division I-A conferences to decide individually whether
to play Saturday, Sept. 15, four days after the terrorist attacks. By
Wednesday, only the Pacific 10, Atlantic Coast and Big East had announced
that they would not play. The Big Ten and Big 12 said the decision would
be left up to its schools, and the Southeastern said its games would be
played. But when the NFL and major league baseball postponed games,
conference administrators reevaluated, and by Friday morning only a
Division I-AA game between Columbia and Fordham was still scheduled--in
New York. Later in the day, that too was postponed.</TE>
<TE>8 JOE PA AND THE BEAR</TE>
<TE>   Most days the Bear eats you, one day you eat the Bear--if you are Penn
State coaching legend Joe Paterno. After starting the season 0-4, the
Nittany Lions upset Northwestern and Ohio State, pushing Paterno past
Paul "Bear" Bryant for most victories in Division I-A. Penn State
finished 5-6, giving Paterno a 327-96-3 mark. Paterno has had successive
losing seasons for the first time in his 51-year association with Penn
State, but with Pop Warner, Amos Alonzo Stagg and Bryant in the rearview
mirror, the 74-year-old coach is cautiously peeking forward. "I hope I
can go another five years," he said. "I don't know. You have to be
realistic."</TE>
<TE>7 SEPTUAGENARIAN SECOND BANANA</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Bowden, 72, equaled Bryant's victory total of 323 when Florida
State beat Virginia Tech in the Gator Bowl. But the Seminoles failed to
win the Atlantic Coast Conference for the first time since joining it in
1992 and finished a ho-hum 8-4. Bowden can only hope the season was
seminal for the Seminoles--Chris Rix was the first freshman to start at
quarterback in Bowden's 25 years and the seeds are planted for a return
to prominence. And Paterno ought to be looking over his shoulder.</TE>
<TE>6 SHORT DRIVES AND LONG CONSEQUENCES</TE>
<TE>   UCLA tailback DeShaun Foster drove a Ford Expedition lent to him by a
Hollywood director and was suspended for the last four games (bye-bye
Heisman Trophy). UCLA's final drive against Oregon stalled, forcing a
failed 50-yard field-goal try in a 21-20 loss (bye-bye conference title).
Quarterback Cory Paus drove after drinking, neglected to inform Coach Bob
Toledo about his subsequent conviction, and the already spiraling Bruins
fell to USC, 27-0 (bye-bye bowl game). The distractions nearly drove the
overburdened Toledo crazy (bye-bye play-calling duties next season).</TE>
<TE>5 A REAL THROWBACK</TE>
<TE>   Eric Crouch is considered old school because he runs better than he
passes, but the Nebraska quarterback cemented the Heisman Trophy when he
became a triple-threat, catching a 63-yard reverse throwback in the
fourth quarter of a 20-10 victory over Oklahoma. Crouch handed off to
Thunder Collins, who pitched the ball to split end Mike Stuntz on a
reverse, and Stuntz threw downfield to the quarterback. Crouch became the
13th player to rush and pass for 1,000 yards in the same season, winning
the Heisman in a close race against a bunch of other quarterbacks.</TE>
<TE>4 BAN COLORADO, SINCERELY, BCS COMPUTER GEEKS</TE>
<TE>   By crushing Nebraska in a regular-season finale, slipping past Texas
in the Big 12 title game, then falling flat against Oregon in the Fiesta
Bowl, Colorado did more damage to the BCS than any computer virus. A
pitch on the Buffalo web site reads: "Now you can own a piece of Colorado
history with the special 30-minute tape of the Buffaloes throwing the BCS
in a tangle by piling up 582 yards and humiliating Nebraska, 62-36." No
word on availability of the sequel: Colorado Gags on Duck.</TE>
<TE>3 DECEMBER'S DELICIOUS BCS MOMENTS</TE>
<TE>   Ernest Wilford of Virginia Tech dropping a two-point conversion pass
that would have tied the score late in the fourth quarter, enabling Miami
to finish the regular-season unbeaten.... Oregon sloshing past Oregon
State in a driving rainstorm, 17-14, to win the Civil War but lose the
BCS battle.... Tennessee booting Florida from the BCS picture by winning
at the Swamp, only to stumble over Louisiana State in the SEC
championship game.... Brigham Young wailing and threatening lawsuits over
its BCS snub, only to lose to Hawaii in Honolulu, 72-45, then to
Louisville in the Liberty Bowl, 28-10.... Texas Coach Mack Brown failing
to bring quarterback Major Applewhite off the bench in the Big 12 title
game in time to orchestrate a comeback against Colorado, then watching
Applewhite pass for a school-record 473 yards in a 47-43 Holiday Bowl
victory over Washington.</TE>
<TE>2 LUCKY CHARMS</TE>
<TE>   The stench of hastily hiring a coach with the requisite apostrophe in
his name but lies and deceit in his game cleared miraculously when Notre
Dame turned to Tyrone Willingham, the unblemished Stanford coach who
becomes the first minority to head an Irish program. Notre Dame will
survive the episode and, who knows, might even field a winning team. But
the damage to George O'Leary's reputation rivals the damage caused by
Mrs. O'Leary's cow. And the Georgia Tech team he coached all year did
fine without him--dispatching Willingham from Stanford with a 24-14
defeat in the Seattle Bowl.</TE>
<TE>1 HURRICANE LARRY</TE>
<TE>   Sure, he inherited a roster of embarrassing riches. Yes, the NFL soon
will be littered with alumni from this Miami team. And Butch Davis built
the foundation. But nothing can diminish Larry Coker's accomplishment of
going unbeaten in his first season as a head coach, at 53. The Miami
players certainly appreciate Coker's contribution--they can add national
championship rings to their already prodigious bling-bling.</TE>

<HD>Jackson Faces Knee Surgery</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a news event it might not rank up there with Chick Hearn's
streak-ending, open-heart surgery, but what Keith Jackson is facing
certainly isn't a minor operation.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson is having both knees replaced Jan. 16 at Centinela Hospital in
Inglewood. Jackson, 73, said the cartilage is gone in his knees.</LD>
<LD>   "It has gotten to the point where I can't play golf, I can't do
anything," Jackson said before announcing Thursday night's BCS
championship game at the Rose Bowl for ABC.</LD>
<TE>   Having both replaced at the same time is quite an ordeal. Generally,
patients opt to have one knee done at a time.</TE>
<TE>   "The way I look at, I'll only have to go through the agony once," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said it will take his doctor, Lawrence Dorr, an
hour-and-a-half to do the surgery and it will take him three months to
recover.</TE>
<TE>   "The way he explained it, I'll have two weeks of agony, two weeks of
pain and then two months of discomfort," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson was encouraged by his friend Will Perry, former sports
information director and associate athletic director at Michigan, to have
the surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "Will said he had [one knee] done and the only thing he can't do now
is lay tile," Jackson said. "Well, I don't think I'll be laying any
tile."</TE>
<TE>He's Returning</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, who has been announcing college football for ABC since 1966,
retired among much ballyhoo after announcing the BCS championship game at
the Fiesta Bowl three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   But a few months later, after new ABC Sports President Howard Katz
suggested Jackson just work West Coast games and the Rose Bowl, Jackson
announced he was not retiring.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson is happy with the current arrangement of working Pacific 10
games and the Rose Bowl with partner Tim Brant, and ABC has announced
Jackson will be back for at least one more season.</TE>
<TE>   How much longer would he like to go?</TE>
<TE>   "Chick Hearn is my idol," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn is also a neighbor. Well, almost.</TE>
<TE>   The two legendary announcers live a couple of Tiger Woods tee shots
apart, Jackson in Sherman Oaks on the east side of the 405 Freeway and
Hearn in Encino on the west side of the 405.</TE>
<TE>Ratings Decline</TE>
<TE>   During the first three years of the BCS bowls, there was a ratings
increase. The trend is reversing itself this year.</TE>
<TE>   The three BCS bowls played through Wednesday averaged a 9.8 national
rating. The average for the four BCS bowls a year ago was a 13.9.
Thursday's night's Rose Bowl would have to get a 26.1 to avoid a decline,
and that's not going to happen.</TE>
<TE>   Last January's Orange Bowl, which was the national championship game,
got a 17.8. The Rose Bowl will be lucky to get a rating that good.</TE>
<TE>Remembering Schaap</TE>
<TE>   Roger Kahn tells a story about Dick Schaap that helps explain why he
was such a highly regarded reporter.</TE>
<TE>   Schaap, who died recently at 67 of complications from hip-replacement
surgery, early in his career worked for Kahn at Newsweek.</TE>
<TE>   Kahn says after Pancho Gonzalez moved to the top of tennis, he
requested a story on him. Gussie Moran, the flamboyant women's star of
that era, had warned Kahn that he wouldn't want to interview Gonzalez
because he tended to be sullen and hostile.</TE>
<TE>   "I said to young Schaap, my deputy, that means you have to do the
interview," Kahn said.</TE>
<TE>   "'How can I get him to talk?' Schaap said, his tone approaching a
whine.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him, 'Go to Forest Hills when he's working out and volunteer
to be his ball boy, if he'll give you an interview.' Schaap did and got
the interview. He took notes and fetched balls for several hours.</TE>
<TE>   "I suspect ever since after a small part of him hated me, but when I
was done with him he knew how to report."</TE>
<TE>Hockey News</TE>
<TE>   ABC begins its Saturday NHL regional coverage this weekend, showing
Colorado at Detroit to 60% of the country, including the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   ABC will have five regular-season telecasts on various Saturdays
through March 16, plus the All-Star game from Staples Center Feb. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Now that ABC and ESPN have acquired the rights to the NBA beginning
next season, there has been concern that those networks might drop the
NHL. But apparently that is not a factor.</TE>
<TE>   "If anything, one complements the other," ABC spokesman Mark Mandel
said. "The NBA would give the NHL a bigger platform and more promotional
time."</TE>
<TE>Recommended Viewing</TE>
<TE>   "The Olympic Show" on CNBC Saturday at 3 p.m. features Bob Costas
interviewing Jim McKay, who will work as a special correspondent during
NBC's coverage of next month's Winter Olympics. "Having you with us in
Salt Lake City, I imagine, must be a little bit like if you were with the
Yankees in the '60s and [Joe] DiMaggio decided to come back and play a
season with you," Costas tells McKay. Saturday's show will be repeated on
CNBC Sunday at 3 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "Vintage NBA," a one-hour ESPN Classic series produced by NBA
Entertainment and hosted by Robin Roberts, tips off its fourth season
Thursday at 5 p.m. with a look at the life and playing career of Michael
Cooper. Pat Riley, Kurt Rambis, Brian Shaw and Lisa Leslie will be among
those talking about the former Laker star and current Spark coach.</TE>
<TE>Bad Signs</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar's Dish Network has dropped ESPN Classic because of a
rate-hike dispute with Disney, ESPN's parent company. "This is a huge
disservice to consumers," ESPN President George Bodenheimer said. This
also could be a bad sign for sports fans who have DirecTV because
EchoStar is in the process of taking over DirecTV, although that deal
still may not go through. ... Another bad sign: Are we going to see
digital billboards like the ones Fox gave us during the World Series on
football telecasts? A blue America Online billboard popped up several
times on the field during the second half of CBS' coverage of the Sun
Bowl Monday. While the game was sponsored by Wells Fargo, America Online
sponsored the yellow first-and-10 maker.</TE>
<TE>Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   Charley Steiner, who has been with ESPN since 1988, is leaving the
network to do New York Yankee radio. ... Former New York Knick coach Jeff
Van Gundy, on a tryout with TNT, will work as a guest analyst on a game
between Orlando and Philadelphia on Wednesday. ... Leo Gerard, president
of the United Steelworkers union, goes after the NCAA on CBS' "60
Minutes" Sunday. He calls the NCAA a sweatshop because of the way it
treats athletes.</TE>
<TE>Radio Daze</TE>
<TE>   Fred Roggin begins his weekday, 2-3 p.m. show on KMPC (1540) on
Monday. His first guest will be T.J. Simers. ... Beginning Jan. 28,
Roggin will have a new lead-in. The Sporting News Radio network is
replacing the loud and often obnoxious Nestor Aparicio with Tim Brando.
The move is definitely a step up. Brando, who will continue working for
CBS, is a proven pro. ... Keith Olbermann has found radio work. He'll
host 31/2-minute vignettes featuring Howard Cosell commentaries twice a
day for ABC Radio beginning Jan. 21. The commentaries will come from two
old Cosell shows, "Speaking of Sports" and "Speaking of Everything." ABC
is looking for a Los Angeles station to carry the vignettes.</TE>
<TE>In Closing</TE>
<TE>   Talk about politically incorrect. This was heard on Fox Sports Net New
England via an NBA League Pass telecast of a game between Boston and
Sacramento this week: Celtic commentator Tom Heinsohn, after a call by
referee Dee Kantner went against Celtics, said that Kantner "ought to go
back to the women's league."</TE>

<HD>First Albacore Catch Comes Early</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first day of a new year is full of firsts, and if you're a
saltwater fisherman there's nothing quite like being the first to catch
an albacore--especially when that feat usually isn't accomplished until
June or July.</LD>
<LD>   Patrick Maloney boated what many believe to be the first sport-caught
albacore of 2002, which came over the rail of his boat Tuesday about 7:45
a.m.</LD>
<LD>   "It was kind of neat catching the first fish of the year," he said. "I
had never caught an albacore in January before."</LD>
<TE>   OK, so Maloney, 32, a Los Angeles attorney, did not seem overly
excited during a cell-phone interview on Wednesday morning--while stuck
in downtown traffic en route to his office.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, he seemed to downplay his accomplishment, referring to the
year's first albacore, if indeed it was the first, as nothing more than
"a novelty fish," indiscernible from the nine others he and his fishing
partner ended up hauling aboard their 32-foot sportfisher, got bait?</TE>
<TE>   "All I know is that our biggest one weighed 36 pounds," Maloney said.</TE>
<TE>   But there was some pride in his tone. After all, he was one of only a
few dozen anglers deciding to forgo their New Year's Eve festivities in
favor of the long run to the fishing grounds, under a frigid night sky
atop a dark and bumpy ocean. And to spend their New Year's Day away from
the TV sets and all those football games.</TE>
<TE>   Recent unseasonable catches of the highly prized longfin tuna off
Ensenada had inspired this thinking. It's the kind of thinking only a
serious fisherman can appreciate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very different fishing for albacore in the winter," said Barry
Brightenburg, a San Diego lure maker who also made the run with two
friends, ending up with three albacore among them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's cold and it can be under difficult conditions, and
psychologically it's hard to think about albacore at this time of year,
but they were out there, so we went."</TE>
<TE>   Because it had been an afternoon bite, Brightenburg opted for a 5 a.m.
Tuesday departure, arriving at the tuna grounds five hours later. He and
his friends were satisfied with an albacore apiece and turned for home.</TE>
<TE>   Maloney and Dave Nunley left San Diego much earlier, at 1 a.m., with
the sounds of revelry still in the air. They wanted to be among the first
on the scene, in hopes of being at least among the first to hook up.</TE>
<TE>   They began trolling at 6:30, traveling west until they found the
proper water color and temperature, with birds fluttering over what
appeared to be a school of bait fish being pursued by larger predators.</TE>
<TE>   It was in this area that they experienced a double strike on the
lures. Maloney was the first to get his tuna aboard, he said, but both
landed their fish, quickly pinned a bait to their hooks and caught
another.</TE>
<TE>   Maloney can't say for sure whether his "jig fish" was the first to
have been caught in 2002; just that it seemed to be the general consensus
among those in the area monitoring the bite via VHF radio on Channel 72.</TE>
<TE>   "There were one or two others hiding out on Channel 65," Maloney said.
"And one of them caught a fish at about 10 and shouted out, 'We got the
first one!' but we got on and said, 'Sorry, it's already been caught."'</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Maloney doesn't belong to a club and thus will not receive official
honors for unofficially being the first of the year to boat an albacore.</TE>
<TE>   Receiving such honors, however, are Dave Runstrom of Irvine for the
20-pound 14-ounce albacore he boated Tuesday at 9:08 a.m., while fishing
within sight of Maloney. Runstrom, 52, was awarded the Balboa Angling
Club's first-albacore flag for the third year in a row.</TE>
<TE>   He and three others at least had enjoyed the privilege of traveling in
style, aboard a 48-foot sportfisher named Dragon.</TE>
<TE>   "We left at 3 p.m. [New Year's Eve]," he said. "We were all asleep at
midnight so we had our champagne after we caught the fish."</TE>
<TE>   Alan Baron of Newport Beach claimed the Avalon Tuna Club's flag for
the 11-pound 3-ounce albacore he caught at 9:52.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Now that the first albacore of 2002 has been caught, the question is:
How long will the tuna stick around?</TE>
<TE>   The answer, probably, is not long. The fish are being found 70 miles
southwest of San Diego, 40-50 miles offshore, in a band of 60-degree
water that appears to be moving west and giving way to cooler water as it
goes.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Crooke, a Department of Fish and Game biologist, said the reason
the fish have stuck around so long probably has to do with the fact that
winter storms have not been severe enough to cause significant cooling.</TE>
<TE>   He stopped short of calling the presence of albacore in January
unusual, but was somewhat surprised that so many big fish seemed to be
lingering, explaining that the smaller albacore are more tolerant of
cooler water.</TE>
<TE>   As a rule, albacore prefer water at or slightly above 62 degrees.</TE>
<TE>Saltwater Notes</TE>
<TE>   * Cabo San Lucas: Striped marlin are still making a splash at the
Golden Gate, where few boats are getting skunked and some are returning
to port flying as many as six release flags per day. Meanwhile, two of
the fleets have released catch totals for 2001. Pisces Sportfishing last
year logged 1,271 striper catches and of those an impressive 1,153 were
released. Its top week was Nov. 28-Dec. 4, with 68 striper catches.
Gaviota Sportfishing logged 950 catches, of which 693 were released.</TE>
<TE>   * Southern California: New rockfish regulations that would have
extended the January and February closure to include nearshore waters
(fewer than 120 feet) did not go into effect as scheduled Tuesday because
the Office of Administrative Law had not yet signed off on the measure.</TE>
<TE>   Official approval could happen any day, but until then fishing for
rockfish, including sculpin, is legal in nearshore waters.</TE>
<TE>Freshwater Notes</TE>
<TE>   * Bass fishing: In the spotlight this week is Riverside County's Lake
Perris, where big bass have begun to stir.</TE>
<TE>   Will Steele, visiting from Idaho and fishing with lake regular Jerry
Rago of Independence, Calif., last Friday set a lake record by landing an
18-pounder while casting one of Rago's homemade lures near the launch
ramp.</TE>
<TE>   The lures resemble the trout on which the bigger bass prefer to feed.
Rago didn't have a bad day either, catching bass at 111/2 and 91/4
pounds.</TE>
<TE>   * Fly-fishing: Downey Flyfishers is offering a series of five
Wednesday night fly-tying classes that are free to the public, beginning
Wednesday at 7 p.m. at Apollo Park in Downey. Details: (562) 691-7878.</TE>
<TE>Snow Sports</TE>
<TE>   * Brisk business: California ski resorts swooshed through the holidays
in grand style, thanks to Mother Nature and a willing public.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Roberts, director of the California Ski Industry Assn., went so
far as to say "The gods have smiled on us" and that "All of the worries
about what Sept. 11 and the economy would do never materialized."</TE>
<TE>   As for Mother Nature, she did her part locally by providing cold
enough temperatures to enable day-and-night snow making at the
Southland's big four resorts: Mountain High in Wrightwood, Snow Summit
and Big Bear Mountain in Big Bear Lake, and Snow Valley in Running
Springs.</TE>
<TE>   Business has been as brisk as the weather. At Mountain High, for
example, the average daily attendance was 5,000 during the two-week
holiday period, up from 2,500 the previous year. The resort has already
gone over 200,000 skier-snowboarder visits for the season and "They
accomplished all this on just 10 inches of natural snow," Roberts said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Lake Tahoe area and at Mammoth Mountain, natural snowfall has
been measured in feet rather than inches, and during the holidays the
flurries also came in waves of people negotiating mountain roads en route
to the slopes.</TE>
<TE>   "The towns have been full to the brim at Tahoe and Mammoth so people
are hanging in and doing their part," Roberts said.</TE>
<TE>   There was particular concern at Heavenly Ski Resort on Lake Tahoe's
south shore, because the facility caters largely to Europeans, mostly
from England, but they apparently weren't too concerned about airline
travel because Heavenly's slopes were as busy as any of its cross-lake
rivals.</TE>
<TE>   * A worthy cause: Mountain High on Saturday is hosting its annual
Boarding for Breast Cancer Board-a-Thon, doing its part to combat a
disease that is the leading cause of death in women age 15-54.</TE>
<TE>   The fund-raising event, which is free to anyone buying a lift ticket,
will feature live music, vendors, pro snowboarding exhibitions and
educational booths. Donations are accepted and improve chances of winning
such prizes as skis, snowboards, lift tickets and season passes. For more
information, contact Kathleen Gasperini at (206) 323-2369 or via e-mail
at Kathleen@b4bc.org.</TE>
<TE>Winding Up</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Holmes, 35, a Los Angeles resident visiting Maui with his
girlfriend, was released from Maui Memorial Hospital on Wednesday, a day
after being treated for bites to his buttocks and thigh by what is
presumed to be a six-foot tiger shark.</TE>
<TE>   Holmes could not be reached for comment but told the Honolulu
Star-Bulletin that after spotting the shark while snorkeling off Olowalu
Beach, he and his girlfriend started swimming to shore. Holmes looked
back and saw the predator a few feet away with its mouth open.</TE>
<TE>   Its mouth closed and a tussle ensued. "I pounded his nose," Holmes
said. "I got two good shots at him and he went below the surface."</TE>
<TE>   The beach was closed after the 1 p.m. New Year's Day attack, but
reopened Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Weir Strikes While His Irons Are Hot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The last time Mike Weir played on the PGA Tour, he was hitting his
irons close to the flag on his way to victory in the Tour Championship.
Two months later, only the scenery has changed.</LD>
<LD>   In the best ball-striking round of his career, Weir tied the
Plantation Course record with a 10-under-par 63 on Thursday and built a
three-stroke lead in the first round of the season-opening Mercedes
Championships at Kapalua, Hawaii.</LD>
<LD>   "That was way above my expectations," said Weir, who spent much of
December skiing.</LD>
<TE>   Frank Lickliter, one of nine players making their debuts in the
winners-only tournament, holed out from 144 yards with an eight-iron
after hitting into a hazard for an unusual birdie, which carried him to a
66.</TE>
<TE>   David Duval, who had set the course record two years ago, had a 67 and
was joined by Cameron Beckman, Chris DiMarco and Scott Verplank.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods took an adventurous route along Kapalua but straightened
himself out with two eagles and finished with a 68.</TE>
<TE>   With only a breeze blowing off the coast of Maui, Woods figured
someone would shoot about 65.</TE>
<TE>   "Weirsy happened to go lower. That's good for him," Woods said. "He's
been playing well and he's going to be hard to catch."</TE>
<TE>   The start of the season was still a relaxing day for some. Duval was
eager to get in front of a television to watch the Rose Bowl, and he's
counting the days before he can hit the slopes in Sun Valley--Monday
morning. In between, he posted a 67.</TE>
<TE>   Weir wasn't sure what to think of his round.</TE>
<TE>   While the 63 tied his lowest career round in relation to par, it could
have been better.</TE>
<TE>   He three-putted for par on No. 5 and missed four putts inside 10 feet
on the back nine.</TE>
<TE>   So pure were his irons that the longest birdie putt he made was seven
feet on the 15th.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough to assess how my putting was today because I had so many
kick-ins," Weir said. "When I had a 10-footer, it felt like 30 feet.
Obviously, I'm not complaining. It was one of those days where my irons
were dialed in."</TE>
<TE>   Weir was using new irons for the first time in competition. He spent
most of December on the slopes of Utah, nowhere near a golf course except
for four days in Palm Springs working with his coach.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ty Tryon, 17, the high school junior who became the youngest player to
earn his PGA Tour card, will open the season in the Phoenix Open, his
agent said.</TE>
<TE>   The Phoenix Open is Jan. 24-27 on the TPC at Scottsdale, Ariz.</TE>

<HD>Report Says Vikings Plan to Fire Green</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Minnesota Viking Coach Dennis Green may be fired by team owner Red
McCombs next week, ESPN reported, citing unidentified sources.</LD>
<LD>   The Vikings (5-10) will miss the playoffs this season for only the
second time under Green, who has been Minnesota's coach since 1992.</LD>
<LD>   Minnesota had never had a losing record during his tenure.</LD>
<TE>   He is expected to meet with McCombs on Tuesday, the day after the
Vikings play their regular-season finale at Baltimore. McCombs will fire
Green unless he changes his mind before then, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   McCombs had considered stripping Green of the power and title of vice
president of football operations, but has decided to let Green go, ESPN
said.</TE>
<TE>   Green has three years left on a contract that pays him about $3
million annually, and the two sides discussed a settlement but then
stopped talks, the network said.</TE>
<TE>   Team spokesman Bob Hagan had no comment on the report.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tony Siragusa, a veteran defensive tackle who starred on last year's
Super Bowl championship Baltimore Raven team, announced his retirement on
his weekly radio show.</TE>
<TE>   He said he will pursue a career in broadcasting after this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I came into this league as a free agent, on my terms, and I'm gonna
leave on my terms," the 34-year-old Siragusa said.</TE>
<TE>   The effervescent Siragusa, known as "the Goose" during his seven
seasons with the Indianapolis Colts and the last five with Baltimore, has
played in 14 games with 12 starts this year.</TE>
<TE>   He has been plagued by chronic knee and lower-leg injuries as the
Ravens (9-6) have struggled to reach the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Top overall draft pick Michael Vick will start at quarterback for the
Atlanta Falcons against the St. Louis Rams on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   It will be the 21-year-old Vick's second NFL start, the other being a
20-13 victory over the Dallas Cowboys on Nov. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Vick had a rocky first half in that game, then alternated snaps with
second-year backup Doug Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Dan Reeves thought Vick showed progress when he replaced the
injured Chris Chandler during last week's 21-14 road loss to the Miami
Dolphins.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want him to play and have control over what we're doing,"
Reeves said. "Just get better."</TE>

<LD>Times NFL writer Sam Farmer poses--and answers--the league's
burning questions.</LD>
<LD>   Question: Best reason to watch the 5-10 Cowboys play the 1-14 Lions?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: After all that running, Emmitt Smith needs 56 yards for his
11th consecutive 1,000-yard season, which would break the record of 10 he
shares with ... former Lion Barry Sanders. Lots of Detroit fans think
Sanders let down the franchise by retiring early, so it will be
interesting to see if they're pulling for Smith.</LD>
<TE>   Q: How much more patient are we since Sept. 11?</TE>
<TE>   A: Apparently, not much. More than 100 fans barged through Gate B at
Lambeau Field on Sunday before the Minnesota game, prompting Green Bay
police to reexamine security measures in case a playoff game is held at
the stadium. The incident began half an hour before the game when a man
from Racine, Wis., tried to shove his way through the gate. He was
subdued by four officers. Behind him was a crowd of about 5,000--some
shouting, "Push! Shove! They can't stop us all!"--and about 100 got
through without waiting for security checks.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Any extra incentives for Philadelphia's defense against Tampa Bay?</TE>
<TE>   A: Sure. The Eagles have given up no more than 24 points in 31
consecutive games. One more such performance will break the league
record. The Buccaneers have scored more than 24 three times this season.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What's the definition of payback?</TE>
<TE>   A: Ask Seattle quarterback Trent Dilfer. If his Seahawks beat the
Chiefs and Baltimore loses Monday to Minnesota, the Ravens are out of the
playoffs. You'll remember that the Ravens did not re-sign Dilfer last
spring after he'd helped them to a Super Bowl victory.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Strangest Terrell Davis statistic?</TE>
<TE>   A: The Denver star has 161 touches this season--149 carries and 12
catches--but has yet to score.</TE>
<TE>   That's right, no TDs for T.D.</TE>

<HD>Change Is the Biggest Supercross Question</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Supercross, second only to NASCAR among the country's more
successful motor sports series, will open its 2002 season Saturday night
at Anaheim's Edison Field with four questions to be answered during its
16-event schedule--three of which are in Anaheim:</LD>
<LD>   * Can record-setting Ricky Carmichael sustain his remarkable winning
streak after switching from Kawasaki to Honda during the off-season?</LD>
<LD>   Carmichael, 22, dominated last year's competition, tying supercross
records for most victories in a season, 14, and most in succession, 13,
then swept the outdoor 250cc motocross nationals for his seventh national
championship, all on Kawasakis.</LD>
<TE>   In his first race on the red Honda CR last fall, Carmichael won his
second straight U.S. Open of Supercross in Las Vegas, winning two heats
and both main events.</TE>
<TE>   "My final decision to ride a CR was based on the technology Honda
has," Carmichael said. "The very first day they brought the Honda out, I
turned my fastest time ever on my supercross track at home in Florida.
Now my biggest challenge will be to try to repeat my 2001 season. It's
going to be hard, but that challenge is going to keep me motivated."</TE>
<TE>   * Can seven-time supercross champion Jeremy McGrath, at 30, return to
the pinnacle of his sport, riding against the youngster Carmichael?</TE>
<TE>   "I'll admit, Ricky surprised me last year when he out-conditioned me,
but now I know what I'm facing and I want that title back," McGrath said.
"No doubt in my mind that I can get it again. People keep saying I'm too
old, but I beat everybody but Ricky last year, and I expect to get
[title] No. 8 this year."</TE>
<TE>   Although McGrath races Yamahas, he owns his own team, McGrath Racing
Inc.</TE>
<TE>   He won the first two races at Anaheim last year, but then Carmichael
took over and won the next 13.</TE>
<TE>   "I know exactly what happened last year and why I didn't win," McGrath
said. "It wasn't because Carmichael was so much better than me. I was
involved in putting my team together and building a new house and missed
some training. This year I've been working hard and expect to win.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, I had the speed, but didn't have the stamina. That's where
he got me. This year I'll be more prepared. He's still the one to beat,
even on a different bike. I don't see that making him any less of a
rider."</TE>
<TE>   * Will James "Bubba" Stewart, barely 16, show the same domination in
the 125cc class that he displayed in breaking all of Carmichael's amateur
records and become supercross' first black champion?</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, from Haines City, Fla., began racing when he was barely big
enough to reach the pegs. And also like fellow Floridian Carmichael,
Stewart was an immediate success. He first signed with Kawasaki when he
was 7, and last year won his 11th AMA amateur national championship for
Team Green, surpassing Carmichael's record of nine.</TE>
<TE>   In the Loretta Lynn Nationals, the country's biggest amateur event,
the 15-year-old Stewart swept six motos in winning both his 12-15 age
class and the open finals.</TE>
<TE>   At Anaheim, he will make his professional debut in the 125cc class.</TE>
<TE>   Often asked how he feels about being the first prominent black rider,
Stewart--who turned 16 on Dec. 21--says, "It would be cool to be called a
pioneer, but that's really not what concerns me. It's a challenge, but
it's not a special one. I figure I face a challenge every time I race, a
challenge to win."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart becomes the first 125cc rider on Kawasaki's A-team roster,
joining 250cc veterans Ezra Lusk and Stephane Roncada under team manager
Bruce Stjernstrom. Lusk came from Honda in what appears to be a trade for
Carmichael.</TE>
<TE>   Also in Saturday night's 125 race will be defending Western Regional
champion Mike Brown as part of Mitch Payton's Pro Circuit team,
Kawasaki's junior varsity.</TE>
<TE>   * Perhaps most significant is what will happen this year as the
American Motorcyclist Assn. prepares to move promotion of its supercross
series from the highly successful Clear Channel organization to JamSports
in 2003 .</TE>
<TE>   Under the promotion of Clear Channel (formerly Pace Motor Sports),
supercross has attracted record crowds at most of its venues. At the
Georgia Dome, there were 65,461 spectators. At San Diego's Qualcomm
Stadium, there were 61,368.</TE>
<TE>   Edison Field's capacity has been reduced to 45,050, but most of the
seats are expected to be full Saturday night. Two of last year's three
events sold out.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the AMA is preparing to turn the series over to JamSports, a
Chicago producer of live music events, under a seven-year contract.</TE>
<TE>   The way it is sorting out, the AMA and Clear Channel will have
competing 16-race schedules next year, creating a split similar to the
one between CART and the Indy Racing League in open-wheel racing. Clear
Channel has already announced its 2003 schedule, complete with three
Edison Field races and one in San Diego. JamSports has not released its
schedule yet, but has announced that it will have two races in the Los
Angeles area. Sites under consideration include the Coliseum, where the
sport began in 1972, the Rose Bowl and Dodger Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "The next era of growth of AMA supercross is dependent on live
television and nationwide markets," Scott Hollingsworth, head of AMA pro
racing, said. "We are excited to have a live TV package with Speed
Channel that is a home run. And now we have markets in place that will
assure AMA supercross is seen by fans coast to coast. One is in the New
York area, where we haven't been since 1991."</TE>
<TE>   The impending split is nothing new to supercross. In 1984 there were
competing series, John O'Mara winning one championship and Jeff Ward the
other. Again in 1992, there was a dispute among promoters until Pace
Motorsports was given a seven-year contract that expires this season.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides agree that the manufacturers--Honda, Kawasaki, Yamaha, KTM
and Suzuki--will determine the future of the sport, but so far they have
not chosen sides.</TE>
<TE>   That decision will certainly affect Southern California fans, since
both groups have scheduled Jan. 4 for their opening night a year from
now.</TE>
<TE>ALL-AMERICAN TEAM</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen members of the 2001 Auto Racing All-American team will be
honored Jan. 12 at the 32nd annual American Auto Racing Writers and
Broadcasters Assn. awards banquet. Also being honored will be the
Agajanian family, racing pioneers in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The team normally consists of 12 members--two each from six
categories--but a 13th was added when Winston Cup runner-up Tony Stewart
and Busch Grand National champion Kevin Harvick tied in the stock car
class behind four-time champion Jeff Gordon.</TE>
<TE>   Other members, all series champions, include Gil de Ferran of CART and
Sam Hornish Jr. of the IRL in open-wheel racing; top-fuel driver Kenny
Bernstein and funny car favorite John Force in drag racing; Trans-Am's
Paul Gentilozzi and Grand-Am prototypes' James Weaver in road racing;
USAC midgets' Dave Darland and World of Outlaws' Danny Lasoski in short
track; and Indy Lights' Townsend Bell and off-road racer Rob MacCachren
as at-large representatives.</TE>
<TE>   The dinner will be at the Sheraton Fairplex Suites after a reception
at the National Hot Rod Assn. museum in Pomona. Tickets: (818) 842-7005.</TE>

<HD>Decision to Play Will Be Shaq's</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The decision to play tonight against the Phoenix Suns is Shaquille
O'Neal's.</LD>
<LD>   It is January, and early January at that, so no one is hanging on his
choice, but the Lakers could use his heft in a difficult stretch of games
ahead.</LD>
<LD>   Though he declared this week that he expected to return when his
five-game stay on the injured list was over--it ends tonight--O'Neal did
not walk past reporters Thursday afternoon, he ran. He jacked a 16-foot
fadeaway over Jelani McCoy at the end of practice, howled when it
dropped, and that was about the last anyone saw of him.</LD>
<TE>   "Oh yeah," McCoy said on his way off the floor, "he'll be ready."</TE>
<TE>   Nice of McCoy, really, since it probably means a return to the injured
list for him.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, third in the NBA in scoring and fifth in rebounds, has been
bothered by an arthritic right big toe and, four months after surgery,
limps on his small left toe.</TE>
<TE>   He volunteered to go to the injured list on Christmas Day. He rested
his feet for a week and then gradually resumed basketball activities. He
worked out Thursday morning, then participated in about half of the
team's regular practice. By the time the Lakers filled the floor, O'Neal
already was sweating and apparently in great spirits.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked pretty good, the same to me," guard Kobe Bryant said. "He
had his game face on, so I figure he'll be ready. I don't think it
matters, because whenever he steps out on the floor he'll be ready to
play anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he assumed O'Neal would play tonight, Bryant said, "I hope
so. I don't know. He said he might, he might not."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Phil Jackson said he could not predict O'Neal's course. He
wouldn't mind that the Suns would prepare for two Laker teams--the one
with O'Neal and the one without him. Also, O'Neal often changes his mind,
and actually surprised some club officials when he said he expected to
return so quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't come to me and tell me he's ready to go," Jackson said.
"We'll talk about that [today].</TE>
<TE>   "It's important for him to come back when he's ready to come back.
We're going to win more games when Shaq's in the lineup, there's no doubt
about it. But, that's not of paramount importance. It's tough to feel
you're going into war without your big warrior out there to play. The
reality is, you've got to go through an 82-game season. You make it the
best you can. If he's healthy for an 82-game season, great. If he plays
68, great. Whatever it is, we'll take it and go into the playoffs in the
best condition we can possibly be in when that time comes."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Resolutions aren't taken lightly around the Lakers. No "cut out the
fudge ripple" around here.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson resolved to "surrender" his resistance.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant, who enjoys a little self-examination now and then, drew his
inspiration from noted philosopher Tex Winter, who tweaked the whole
resolution thing.</TE>
<TE>   "Not to have one next year," Bryant said, laughing. "To have
everything be nice and simple, to lead a simple life. That's a good piece
of advice that Tex gave me, 'Just keep life as simple as possible.'
That's a good one."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers were 19-9 at this time last season ... After tonight's game
against Phoenix, the Lakers will fly Saturday to Toronto, where they
start a five-game, eight-day trip. They'll also play in Detroit and
Indiana on consecutive nights, then Minnesota and Chicago on consecutive
nights.</TE>

Suns' leading scorer then as well, with 25 points. Kobe Bryant missed 10

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>The Clippers refused to be discouraged about their loss Wednesday
to the Kings at Sacramento. They didn't shoot well and the Kings did. It
was that simple.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Alvin Gentry gave his team the day off and many of the players
and coaches planned to meet at a restaurant to watch the bowl
championship series national title game between Nebraska and Miami.</LD>
<LD>   "They are as good a team as there is in the league," Gentry said of
the Kings, who lead the NBA with an 18-1 mark at home and are third in
the West behind the Lakers and San Antonio Spurs. "They're capable of
beating any team in the league."</LD>
<TE>   Gentry then called tonight's game against the Denver Nuggets "very
important."</TE>
<TE>   "San Antonio, Sacramento and the Lakers--we don't worry too much about
losing to them," Gentry said. "It's the other teams, the Denvers and
Phoenixes of the world.... We've got to find a way to win on the road.
We're all in the same position."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers are 1-8 on the road, but 15-7 at Staples Center. Only the
Chicago Bulls, winless in 16, are worse away from home.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lamar Odom came through Wednesday's game against Sacramento just fine.
He had missed three games because of a badly sprained right wrist, but
was among the Clippers' most effective players in scoring 13 points,
taking seven rebounds and adding four assists in 40 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked him after the game about his wrist and he said, 'Coach, this
is the least pain I've had in a while,"' Gentry said. "You don't plan to
play him 40 minutes, but you stick him out there and you're so
comfortable with him."</TE>
<TE>   In Gentry's opinion, Elton Brand continues to shine.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody wanted to see how he'd do against guys like Karl Malone and
Rasheed Wallace because, you know, everyone says he's undersized for a
power forward," Gentry said of Brand, 6 feet 8 and 265 pounds. "He's
proved he can do it. He's faced a lot of double-teaming and he's proved
he can do it."</TE>
<TE>   In his first season as a Clipper, Brand leads the team with averages
of 19.5 points and 11.1 rebounds in 31 games.</TE>
<TE>TONIGHT</TE>

<TE>   Records--Clippers 16-15, Nuggets 10-20.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Nuggets--0-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The Nuggets have lost seven of their last 10 and were beaten
Wednesday by the Lakers. Mike Evans has taken over for Dan Issel as
Nugget coach since the Clippers' last visit to Denver, a 96-93 loss Nov.
30. The Nuggets have defeated the Clippers in their last seven meetings
at Denver. Tonight's game is the third in a stretch of four in five
nights for the Clippers, who are 1-1 thus far.</TE>

<HD>This Time, Jordan Running Against Bulls</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: On a hot streak, Wizard star goes for 30,000 career
points against his former team.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Michael Jordan was asked if he was looking forward to Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "What's Friday?" he shot back.</LD>
<LD>   He then unwrinkled his brow, let out a sly chuckle, said a few words
about how nice it is that the Washington Wizards won't be on the road
anytime soon and finally added the punch line that was coming all along.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm definitely looking forward to Chicago," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Jordan is the best athlete in the universe, because the planets
will be aligned for him tonight at the MCI Center. He's well rested,
relatively healthy, has been unstoppable for the last two games and is
going for 30,000 points--against his old team, the Chicago Bulls.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been giving people 40, 50," said Bull forward Ron Artest, who
played in Jordan's pickup games in Chicago over the summer. "He's
probably going to try to give me about 70. I'm going to try and give him
70 too."</TE>
<TE>   It's not out of the question, at least for Jordan. After putting up 51
points against Charlotte on Saturday and 45 on New Year's Eve against New
Jersey, Jordan indicated more of the same is on the way. The tendinitis
in his knee is on the wane, allowing him to resume daily weightlifting
and regain strength in his legs for better lift on his jumpers and
quicker drives to the basket.</TE>
<TE>   "This is how I was playing all summer," Jordan said, "before I broke
my ribs."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan won six titles in 13 years with the Bulls, and his statue is
outside the United Center, where he'll make his first appearance with a
visiting team Jan. 19. Ninety-eight percent of his 29,985 career points
have been scored for Chicago, and chances are he'll get 15 against
Chicago to join Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone and Wilt Chamberlain as
the only players to reach 30,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously it wasn't a thought that I could get to 30,000 when I
retired the last time," Jordan said. "Now it's within reach.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an elite club obviously, and I feel privileged just to be in
that club.... It's very motivating for me."</TE>
<TE>   With 96 points in two games, Jordan needs 68 points to match his best
three-game run, when he scored 53, 50 and 61 for a total of 164 for the
Bulls from April 12-16, 1987. His career high is 69.</TE>
<TE>   "It'd be a lot of points for anybody," said former teammate Bill
Cartwright, now the Bulls' coach. "But we know Michael has the potential
to do the abnormal."</TE>

<HD>A Crowd of Several Watches Hornets Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With 10 inches of snow on the ground and the city practically shut
down, the Hornets told their wives and children to stay home. Just about
everyone else in Charlotte did the same.</LD>
<LD>   Fewer than 1,000 fans turned out Thursday night to see Baron Davis get
28 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds while leading the Hornets to a
114-102 victory over the Golden State Warriors.</LD>
<LD>   "We talked before the game about how it was going to be like playing
at the YMCA and we'd have to do it for pride only," guard David Wesley
said. "We told our own families not to come, so why would anyone else?"</LD>
<TE>   Almost 8,000 tickets were sold for the game, but the Hornets gave fans
little incentive to brave the weather, announcing hours before the game
that ticket holders not wanting to trudge through snow could turn in
their stubs for passes to another game.</TE>
<TE>   The result was completely empty sections in the 23,799-seat Charlotte
Coliseum and the announcer inviting the few fans in the upper deck to
move down to better seats, creating an intimate setting--and the smallest
crowd in franchise history--in which fans could practically converse with
the players.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a great time, the fans who were here were loud and boisterous
and with us the whole time," Davis said. "They came out in this weather
to see us win and we gave it to them."</TE>
<TE>   Almost everyone was still there with under a minute to play yelling
"Whooo!" in an imitation of how Davis and pro wrestler Ric Flair do it in
a local commercial.</TE>
<TE>   The cheer got louder when Davis went scrambling after a defensive
rebound that gave him the third triple-double of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 99, Detroit 97--In his first full game back from injury, Steve
Francis tied his career high with 36 points, including a running jumper
with two-tenths of a second to play at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Willis scored 10 of his 12 points the final quarter as the
Rockets beat the Pistons at home for the ninth straight time.</TE>
<TE>   New York 108, Dallas 101--The Knicks opened overtime with a 7-0 run at
New York and ended the Mavericks' win streak at 11 games.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas was trying to match the longest winning streak in franchise
history and break a tie with the San Antonio Spurs for the longest
winning streak in the NBA this season.</TE>

<LD>   USC (7-6, 3-1) at Washington State (2-11, 0-3), 7--Even with the loss
to Stanford on Sunday, the Trojans are off to their best Pacific 10
Conference start since 1997. Several USC players were weakened by food
poisoning the day before the Stanford game. Washington State is trying to
end an eight-game losing streak, but it's not the fault of center
Brittney Hawks, who averages 12.6 points and 10.2 rebounds. Ebony Hoffman
is coming on, averaging 21 points in her last three games for the
Trojans.</LD>

against the Huskies. Washington, coming off a victory at Oregon State, is
seeking successive victories. Junior guard Loree Payne is the Huskies'
leading scorer with 14.9 points a game and needs 14 points to become the
17th Washington player to reach 1,000. Freshman guard Brianna Winn had
her best game as a Bruin against Cal, scoring a career-high 10 points.</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Knight's lawyer admitted Thursday the former Indiana coach
shoved former assistant Ron Felling, but he denied it was assault.</LD>
<LD>  Felling filed a lawsuit in April against Knight and the university,
claiming he was wrongfully terminated in 1999. In the lawsuit, Felling
claims he was assaulted by Knight.</LD>
<LD>  Knight's attorney, Russell Yates, told Indianapolis TV station WTHR
that Knight did nothing more than shove Felling.</LD>
<TE>  "Mr. Felling turned to leave, Bob Knight reached out and pushed him
back to say, 'Stay here till I'm finished talking to ya,"' Yates said.</TE>
<TE>  "That's quite different than being a violent punch to hurt someone."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>  Mike Davis, who took over as Indiana coach when Knight was fired in
September 2000, was fined $10,000 by the Big Ten for criticizing
officials following his team's 66-64 loss to Butler on Saturday.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With his breakout game Saturday at Washington State, USC freshman
guard Errick Craven will not take the Cougars by surprise this time
around. And that's just fine with Craven, whose career-high 29 points
were the most by a Trojan freshman since Harold Miner scored 29 against
the Cougars in 1990.</LD>
<LD>  "I'm not going to go in too confident," said Craven, who also had six
rebounds and six steals. "I'm just going to play ball and not force
anything and look stupid. I'll stay within the game plan and not give
into the pressure of feeling like I have to score 29 again."</LD>
<LD>  Coach Henry Bibby doesn't know what to expect from Craven tonight.</LD>
<TE>  "He's a freshman so you really don't know what you're going to get,"
Bibby said. "Hopefully you get consistent play from him. But if he's
going well, it's going to open up shots and plays for other people to
make us better.</TE>
<TE>  "But I think people have to take notice of him."</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>   Lou Campanelli, the Pacific 10 Conference coordinator of men's
basketball officiating, said Thursday that he spoke with Bibby earlier in
the day regarding USC's grievance on Washington allegedly hitting Trojan
players with elbows last week.</TE>
<TE>  Campanelli, who said he had spoken with two of the referees, added that
the Pac-10 had asked for but not yet received a tape of the alleged
incident from USC.</TE>
<TE>  "As soon as I look at the tape [today]--Henry's going to overnight
it--I can comment on it and take appropriate action if deemed necessary,"
Campanelli said.</TE>

<LD>It's a quirk in the schedule that doesn't bother UCLA.</LD>
<LD>  Because a Pacific 10 Conference tournament will take place for the
first time in many years, conference games were played before Christmas.</LD>
<LD>  The Bruins made a trip to Washington, where they had lost four in a
row, and won. Then they went to Washington State and won again.</LD>
<TE>  "We're real glad that trip is out of the way," center Dan Gadzuric
said.</TE>
<TE>  "It always gave us problems."</TE>
<TE>  Now Washington and Washington State must travel to Los Angeles, meaning
that UCLA will finish its season series against those schools before it
begins any other.</TE>
<TE>  It also means the Bruins have a great opportunity to open 4-0 in Pac-10
play--as well as extend their winning streak to nine games heading into a
showdown with USC on Thursday at the Forum.</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Gadzuric woke from an early season slump at Washington, scoring 23
points and grabbing 13 rebounds in UCLA's 85-79 victory.</TE>
<TE>  He hopes for an encore in front of a home crowd.</TE>
<TE>  "I've played well since then when I'm not in foul trouble," he said.
"If they make adjustments, I'll make some too."</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Freshman point guard Cedric Bozeman is expected to play about 10
minutes as a reserve, his first game since having knee surgery Dec. 3.
Bozeman was expected to play last week against Columbia and Georgetown,
but Coach Steve Lavin said he wants to err on the side of caution with
the talented newcomer.</TE>

<HD>Irvine Reels In Fullerton</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It used to be so boring at UC Irvine, a school with exactly two
winning seasons in the last 13 years of men's basketball.</LD>
<LD>  But times have changed.</LD>
<LD>  UC Irvine began its come-from-behind antics last season and continued
the trend Thursday night with a 68-58 victory over Cal State Fullerton in
a Big West Conference game before 2,088 at the Bren Events Center.</LD>
<TE>  Irvine struggled throughout with Fullerton's full-court press and fell
behind, 52-45, with 8:37 left.</TE>
<TE>  But the Anteaters (9-4, 2-0 in Big West play) outscored Fullerton,
23-6, the rest of the way.</TE>
<TE>  Irvine shooting guard Mike Hood was scoreless until he made two big
shots in the final three minutes, sinking a 15-footer with 2:50 left and
following it up with a three-pointer to give Irvine a 58-54 edge with
1:49 left.</TE>
<TE>  "If I got a look, I was going to take a shot," Hood said. "I got my
look and it went in. It felt good."</TE>
<TE>  Fullerton (3-9, 0-3) couldn't be feeling any worse.</TE>
<TE>  The Titans lost their first two Big West games by a total of three
points and appeared to be in control.</TE>
<TE>  Fullerton was outrebounded, 42-29, and made only 12 of 23 free throws
(52.2%).</TE>
<TE>  "They killed us on the boards. That hurts you," Fullerton Coach Donny
Daniels said. "Can't make a foul shot. That hurts you. Can't stop them on
defense. That hurts you. It all adds up to a 10-point loss."</TE>

<LD>UC Riverside 73, Long Beach State 67--The Highlanders beat
themselves for the first 20 minutes. Then they went about beating the
49ers.</LD>
<LD>   Vili Morton had a key three-point play with 21 seconds left as the
Highlanders rallied from an 11-point second-half deficit at the Pyramid
for their first Big West road victory.</LD>
<LD>  John Galbreath had 20 points and Jason Perkins added 17 for Riverside
(5-6, 2-1), which defeated Long Beach for the first time in 16 tries.
Morton added 12 points, 13 rebounds and four blocked shots.</LD>
<TE>  "The question was asked [before the game], 'How important would it be
if you won?,"' Riverside Coach John Masi said. "Three things could
happen. One, we'd beat Long Beach for the first time. Two, it's a
conference win. Three, we've won on the road.</TE>
<TE>  "How much more can you ask out of your team in the third game of Big
West play?"</TE>
<TE>   Riverside held Long Beach (4-9, 0-2) without a field goal over the
final 6:42 in rallying from a 64-53 deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Darden led the 49ers with 17 points.</TE>

<HD>With Heineck Joining El Toro, Rich Get Richer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN ARRITT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Lauren Heineck departed Annapolis, Md., last summer and
enrolled at Lake Forest El Toro High, it further shifted the balance of
power of high school girls' water polo toward the West Coast.</LD>
<LD>  At the same time, Heineck's transfer expanded the sphere of elite
competition in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>  Heineck, a 5-foot-10 senior, is regarded as one of the best high school
two-meter defenders in the nation. She and her mother, Judi, arrived in
late August with a goal of shortening the commute to the U.S. national
team headquarters at the Los Alamitos Armed Forces Center, where Lauren
trains with the junior team.</LD>
<TE>   Heineck, home-schooled since sixth grade, enrolled at El Toro and
turned an already polished team into one that could challenge for a
Southern Section Division I title.</TE>
<TE>  Although she missed the first five games of the season because she was
with the junior team in Perth, Australia, where it won a world title,
Heineck has already proven a perfect fit for the Chargers (7-0), No. 4 in
The Times' rankings. They host No. 5 Newport Harbor in a nonleague game
at 10 today.</TE>
<TE>   "She's wonderful," El Toro Coach Don Stoll said. "She's not only a
great player, but she's easy to get along with. The team likes her and
she's doing well in her classes."</TE>
<TE>   Heineck, who signed with UCLA last month, initially sought enrollment
at Santa Margarita High, where she knew several players from junior
competitions. Heineck was turned away, however, because officials of the
private school said she lacked the necessary transcripts from an
accredited high school.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't a problem at El Toro, where Heineck had previously played
junior tournaments at the school's spacious aquatic facility. El Toro's
setup was a big reason Heineck headed there after Santa Margarita, a
detour she hasn't regretted.</TE>
<TE>  "Life takes its course," she said. "Whatever ended up happening, I
probably would have had a good time anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Heineck said the transition from home-school education to a
public-school environment hasn't been as difficult as it would seem. Like
most new students, finding her way from one class to another on the first
day was probably her biggest challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely a big school, but I don't feel inferior there," she
said. "Probably because I'm outgoing enough that I'm not scared by it.
Other kids in the same situation might not feel that way, but it's easy
to get used to."</TE>
<TE>   Heineck, 18, who began playing water polo for a Navy age-group club in
Annapolis when she was 10, received her first national-team experience in
1998, when she traveled to Canada for the NorAm tournament.</TE>
<TE>  She played for national youth teams in 1999 and 2000, and last summer
made the junior team that would win a gold medal in December. Heineck
also traveled to a Northern California tournament last summer with the
senior national team.</TE>
<TE>   It's this type of experience that has Stoll believing she can propel
the Chargers to a section title.</TE>
<TE>  "My take is we would have been in the top four [of Division I] with or
without Lauren," he said. "But she gives us a chance to win the whole
thing."</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Top tournament: A sneak peak at the brackets for the Santa Barbara
Tournament of Champions on Jan. 11-12 at UC Santa Barbara shows seven of
The Times' top 10 teams competing. The only first-round matchup involving
two ranked teams is No. 5 Newport Harbor playing No. 9 Riverside
Arlington. Second-ranked Santa Margarita opens the tournament against
Ventura, followed by No. 1 Santa Ana Foothill against Agoura.</TE>

<HD>Verbum Dei's Chaney Makes Grade With Mom</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD> There are lots of ways for parents to motivate teenagers to
action.</LD>
<LD>   From taking away their allowance, to grounding them, to barring use of
the family car, those are the typical threats.</LD>
<LD>   But nothing provokes greater fear in a teenage basketball player than
hearing Mom say, "If those grades don't come up, you can forget about
basketball."</LD>
<TE>   Richard Chaney knew his mother wasn't bluffing, either.</TE>
<TE>   "My mom's most strict because she wants me to succeed," he said. "I
was failing and she threatened to cut me off the team if I didn't pick up
my grades."</TE>
<TE>   The message got through to Chaney in middle school, and he's been
grateful ever since. Last November, because of his success in basketball
and in the classroom at Los Angeles Verbum Dei High, he signed a letter
of intent with Utah.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought that day was going to come," he said. "I had heard of
others signing and wondered what that would be like. It was exciting. I
felt important."</TE>
<TE>   Chaney, 6 feet 4, is one of the better basketball players in Southern
California. Watch how high he soars on a dunk. See how smooth the ball
rotates on his three-point attempt. Watch how fast he moves up and down
the court. He's averaging 23 points and eight rebounds for Verbum Dei
(10-3), ranked No. 19 by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel I can play any position in high school, even center," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Chaney impressed Utah Coach Rick Majerus with his athleticism and
shooting skills, but it was his mother, Esther, who made the most
profound impression during a recruiting visit to the family home in
Compton.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the character of the young man," Majerus said, "but even more,
I love his mom."</TE>
<TE>   Majerus said it's clear that Chaney has been "held accountable" for
his conduct on and off the court, with his parents doing a good job
teaching him about the importance of education.</TE>
<TE>   Chaney was chosen by Verbum Dei officials to be one of a select group
to speak at a senior retreat. The topic of his speech is causing Chaney
some anxiety, though. He's supposed to talk about his struggles to reach
this point in life.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult because I don't really have any problems," he said.
"I've got two good parents. They taught me right from wrong. They
influenced me to do good. I don't know what it's like to struggle. I've
been blessed."</TE>
<TE>   Chaney has contemplated what he'd like to do if basketball doesn't
take him beyond college.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be either a homicide detective, veterinarian or forensic
pathologist," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His job interests come from watching medical programs on television
and the intrigue he felt dissecting a fish in biology class.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a big orange fish," he said. "It stunk."</TE>
<TE>   Just don't ask him to dissect a worm.</TE>
<TE>   "That was boring," he said. "There was nothing inside."</TE>
<TE>   Dissecting defenses is Chaney's real passion. Because of his size and
quickness, he presents problems for opposing coaches. He's too big for
guards to cover, too quick for forwards and too mobile for centers.</TE>
<TE>   Majerus could be looking like a recruiting genius next season with the
three talented recruits he signed out of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Chaney, he picked up guard Tim Drisdom from Downey Calvary
Chapel and forward Bryant Markson from Monrovia.</TE>
<TE>   Chaney originally committed to USC, but said he changed his mind
because Utah offered a better opportunity to stay focused.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't wait," he said. "I want to know what it's like being on my
own, taking care of myself."</TE>
<TE>   Chaney already knows his parents have done their job preparing him for
the challenges ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "I know the odds of going to the NBA are slim, so I fall back on
education," he said. "That way, I won't disappoint myself or my family. I
hate the most seeing players really talented going to community colleges
because they don't want to learn or take care of school. I didn't want to
be like that."</TE>

<LD>Fifth-ranked Long Beach Poly walked away with a 48-38 victory
Thursday over Eisenhower in the quarterfinals of the Chino Hills Ayala
Best of the West girls' basketball tournament.</LD>
<LD>   Poly's press helped open up a 16-4 lead in the first quarter, and the
Jackrabbits held off Eisenhower comeback attempts in a game between two
unbeaten teams.</LD>
<LD>  Despite both teams having similar styles, Eisenhower didn't press Poly,
which got 19 points from junior Kameca Simmons.</LD>
<TE>  "That's our style," said Poly Coach Carl Buggs. "We go pressure.
Eisenhower was fighting uphill the whole time, and when it was time to
make a stand, our defense stepped up."</TE>
<TE>  Eisenhower, 11-1 and No. 24 in The Times' rankings, got within 29-28
with 2:09 left in the third quarter, but Simmons scored on consecutive
possessions and Poly (13-0) took a 35-28 lead into the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>  Eisenhower again got to within striking distance at 41-38, but Poly
went on a 7-0 run in the final 2:30.</TE>

<HD>Sawyer Rejoins Lineup to Help Enforce the Issue</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mighty Ducks added a little punch to their lineup Wednesday
against the Detroit Red Wings, enforcer Kevin Sawyer.</LD>
<LD>  Sawyer had played only once in seven games since serving a five-game
suspension for his part in the Dec. 8 melee against Calgary. After that
fight night with the Flames, the Ducks began to play better hockey, which
made Coach Bryan Murray reluctant to tinker with the lineup.</LD>
<LD>  "On a personal note, yeah it hurts not to play, but you have to put the
team first," Sawyer said. "Maybe right now, I don't fit in as I did in
the 'pre-suspension' days."</LD>
<TE>  Sawyer, who leads the NHL with 154 penalty minutes, was a perfect fit
with the Ducks this season, stepping into the enforcer role with gusto.
He has also been an effective player on the fourth line.</TE>
<TE>  But Denny Lambert, Marc Chouinard and Dan Bylsma played well together
after Sawyer's suspension.</TE>
<TE>   So Sawyer lost his spot, not for failing to do his job, but for doing
it, when he ran into Flame goalie Mike Vernon in retaliation for the
Flames tripping Duck goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere.</TE>
<TE>  "Dan, Denny and Marc have been consistently one of our best lines,"
Sawyer said. "You sure can't change a good thing. It was just a weird
situation. I feel I lost a little bit of momentum, but the team gained so
much momentum."</TE>
<TE>  Sawyer skated on the fourth line with Chouinard and Lambert on
Wednesday. Bylsma was moved up to the third line.</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  The Ducks have held their own against teams ahead of them. They have
beaten the New York Rangers and San Jose, tied Boston and Colorado and
played well twice in tough losses to Detroit.</TE>
<TE>  But they seem to have problems against teams on their own lower level.
They have lost three times to Columbus, twice to Tampa Bay and once to
Florida.</TE>
<TE>  A 3-3 record in those six games would have the Ducks in 10th place,
four points behind Calgary for the eighth and final playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>  Florida, which comes to the Arrowhead Pond tonight, smacked the Ducks,
6-0, Nov. 21, even without Pavel Bure.</TE>

<HD>With Palffy, Schneider Back, L.A. Can Be a Super Power</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kings may not have anyone ranked among the top 25 goal scorers
in the league but they do have a quality power play that is only going to
get better with the recent return of Ziggy Palffy and Mathieu Schneider.</LD>
<LD>  In the Kings' 3-1 victory over Florida on Wednesday, they were one for
three with a man-advantage. The King power play ranks third in the league
with 36 man-advantage goals this season.</LD>
<LD>  With Palffy back, the Kings have another finisher to complement center
Jason Allison and winger Adam Deadmarsh. Schneider gives them another big
shot from the blue line.</LD>
<TE>  "Any time you add two of your best players to the lineup, it's
definitely a boost for your team," King Coach Andy Murray said. "The
important thing is to maintain a solid work ethic like we had before when
they weren't in the lineup."</TE>
<TE>  Even before Palffy and Schneider were taken off injured reserve, the
special teams had been getting the job done. The Kings had the league's
top power play on the road and the fourth-best penalty kill overall
heading into Wednesday's game.</TE>
<TE>  "By the end of the season, we'll have one of the better power plays in
the league," Murray said. "What we're looking to do is get better
five-on-five, because we know that our special teams will be good."</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Mikko Eloranta and Andreas Lilja, who both suffered knee injuries in
the third period against Florida, skated Thursday morning. Both players
are listed as day-to-day but will leave today with the team for a
five-game trip that opens Saturday against the New York Islanders. The
status of forward Ken Belanger, who suffered a broken thumb in a
first-period fight with the Panthers' Lance Ward, is uncertain.</TE>

<LD>For many horseplayers, there will be five automatic bets on today's
card at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>  Those would be the five horses jockey Laffit Pincay will ride for
trainer Bill Spawr.</LD>
<LD>  The productive combination, which had two wins apiece on Tuesday and
Wednesday to begin the new year, will team with Davene in the first,
Bingo Card in the second, Are You Up in the third, King La Boo in the
fourth and Coke's Tribute in the sixth. A sixth possible starter,
Shesmyhucklebery, was scratched from today's eighth and final race on
Thursday morning.</LD>
<TE>  Bingo Card looks like the best opportunity for another trip to the
winner's circle for Spawr and the world's winningest rider. A
thrice-beaten maiden, the 4-year-old son of Devil's Bag comes off a
heartbreaking loss sprinting at Hollywood Park and doesn't have much to
beat in his first race around two turns for owners John and Betty Mabee's
Golden Eagle Farm.</TE>
<TE>  In the first, Davene has to be considered a contender as she returns to
the scene of her maiden win. In her first start for Spawr, she finished
third of six on Nov. 23 at Hollywood Park. Claimed for $32,000, she is in
for that price today in a field that includes class droppers
Britetonzmyday and Widow Black.</TE>
<TE>  Owned by Farfellow Farms Ltd., Are You Up will be a longshot in the
third race, a one-mile turf affair for older fillies and mares. A
5-year-old daughter of Eagle Eyed, she has been last in her two starts in
California. Her last win came on April 1, 2000, at Gulfstream Park.</TE>
<TE>  In the fourth, King La Boo, who comes off an improved second in a
sprint at Hollywood Park, will stretch out to two turns again seeking his
first win since Dec. 15, 2000. He has lost nine in a row and is winless
in four starts at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>  The last of the Spawr-Pincay runners is Coke's Tribute, a 4-year-old
gelding who, like King La Boo, has been struggling lately. He hasn't been
better than fourth in his last five starts, but would be very dangerous
if he ran back to his race here exactly one year ago. Last Jan. 4, he won
a $50,000 claimer by 51/2 lengths at 5-2 under Pincay.</TE>
<TE>  Race of the day: El Cielo, who really is the king of the hill at Santa
Anita, will try for his 10th win in 13 tries at the distance of about
61/2 furlongs down the unique hillside course. He will run in the
seventh, and although he won't be any sort of price, it's always fun to
watch El Cielo do his thing.</TE>
<TE>  Who's hot: Chris McCarron. The jockey is off to a flying start at Santa
Anita, having won with eight of his first 25 mounts.</TE>
<TE>  Who's not: Lido. The 7-year-old Waajib gelding has really fallen on
hard times. He went 0 for 15 last year and will run against $5,000 foes
in today's seventh race at Turf Paradise.</TE>
<TE>  Exotically speaking:  A pick three singling Bingo Card in the second,
using Fall Habit, Dispersed Reward and Lookn Mighty Fine in the third and
King La Boo, Ivegotuundermyskin, Offensive Play and Buzzword in the
fourth.</TE>
<TE>  Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/21. Money: Previous day/meet total:
$22.60/$149.80. Total money bet: $122.</TE>

<LD>As baseball players resumed their grievance to stop owners from
eliminating teams, union head Donald Fehr said that bargaining for a new
labor contract will probably start next week.</LD>
<LD>  Commissioner Bud Selig gave Fehr a brief outline of what owners want on
Dec. 3, but management hasn't made any formal proposals. Fehr said that
week that Selig gave him "three or four sentences of ideas scratched out
on the back of a piece of paper."</LD>
<LD>  "They have recapitulated that in a letter without any significantly
greater detail," Fehr said Thursday. "We'll see what happens."</LD>
<TE>  Fehr said talks probably would start Tuesday or Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>  Owners could make their central economic proposal public when they meet
Jan. 16-17 in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  The St. Louis Cardinals agreed to a three-year, $27-million contract
with starting pitcher Matt Morris.</TE>
<TE>   Morris, 22-8 with a 3.16 ERA in his first year as a starter since
1998, was eligible for salary arbitration and could have become a free
agent after the 2002 season.</TE>
<TE>  He did not use an agent and negotiated the deal himself. He gets $4
million this year, $10.5 million in 2003 and $12.5 million in 2004.</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Mike Morgan, the 42-year-old pitcher who earned a World Series ring
with Arizona, agreed to a $750,000, one-year contract with the
Diamondbacks, his 12th major league team.</TE>

their new manager, with Ron Gardenhire expected to get the job.</TE>

<HD>Ishii Interests Dodgers, Angels</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers and Angels are among several teams believed to be
interested in bidding for Japanese pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii, who became
available to major league clubs this week.</LD>
<LD>   Ishii, a 10-year veteran of the Yakult Swallows, is considered one of
the top starting pitchers in Japanese baseball. The left-hander went 12-6
with a 3.49 earned-run average in 175 innings last season, ranking second
in the Central League in strikeouts (173) and walks (82). In his only
start in Japan's championship series, he pitched eight shutout innings,
giving up one hit and striking out 12.</LD>
<LD>  The Swallows accommodated his desire to pursue a major league career by
posting him with the commissioner's office, a protocol that requires
interested clubs to place a sealed bid for negotiating rights to Ishii.
Bids are due Monday, and the Swallows have four days to accept or reject
the highest bid. If the Swallows accept, they keep the bid money, and the
winning team then must negotiate a contract with Ishii.</LD>
<TE>   The Seattle Mariners, Texas Rangers, New York Mets, Arizona
Diamondbacks and Cleveland Indians are among the teams also believed to
be interested in Ishii.</TE>
<TE>  "He'd like to be on the West Coast," said Ishii's agent, Joe Urbon.
Ishii's wife, Ayako Kisa, a news anchor for Japan's Fuji TV, formerly
lived in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>  The Dodgers could use Ishii to bolster a rotation that now depends on
Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby returning from injury and Eric Gagne maturing
beyond prospect status. If the Angels sign Ishii, they could consider
trading Scott Schoeneweis--at 28, the same age as Ishii--for another
hitter rather than signing one in free agency.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger General Manager Dan Evans did not return a call Thursday. Angel
General Manager Bill Stoneman declined to discuss whether the Angels
would bid but confirmed the team had scouted Ishii in Japan. Stoneman
also said that, before the Angels released him last month, pitcher
Shigetoshi Hasegawa had encouraged the club to pursue Ishii.</TE>
<TE>  The Mariners paid $13 million last year for negotiating rights to
outfielder Ichiro Suzuki, the American League most valuable player last
season. The rights to Ishii are expected to command perhaps half that
amount.</TE>

prevention grants, spurred by fears among some legislators that the
latest marketing campaigns aren't working and exceed the bounds of good
taste.</LD>
<LD>   "Where's the data that all the billions we spent over the last 10
years has slowed or stemmed the spread of this disease?" asked U.S. Rep.
Dave Weldon (R-Fla.), a physician who strongly supports the inquiry.
"Just because somebody wants the money--and claims it's for a good
purpose--does not mean we should necessarily keep giving it to them year
in and year out."</LD>
<LD>   An initial audit, in October, led federal health officials to chide a
San Francisco prevention agency for inappropriate and potentially obscene
workshops, including two events called the "Great Sex Workshop" and
"Booty Call."</LD>
<TE>   Inspector General Janet Rehnquist, daughter of U.S. Chief Justice
William Rehnquist, found that the workshops by the Stop AIDS Project
appeared to directly promote sexual activity. That, she said, would be
inconsistent with guidelines adopted by the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. Stop AIDS received $698,000 from the CDC in
fiscal 2000.</TE>
<TE>   In response to Rehnquist's report, Health and Human Services Secretary
Tommy G. Thompson promised more widespread audits.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of several AIDS prevention agencies say that they fear that
the audits will squelch--or have a chilling effect on--creative campaigns
that use sexually suggestive language and photos to promote safer sex.
They are especially worried because under the year-old Republican
administration, they don't have the backing inside the White House that
they once did.</TE>
<TE>   "I am concerned that sometimes these politicians decide that they are
against something because it's a good press hit," said Larry Kessler,
executive director of the AIDS Action Committee in Boston. "But they have
no real knowledge of what they're speaking out against."</TE>
<TE>   Prevention groups insist that their programs work, although that is
difficult, if not impossible, to prove.</TE>
<TE>   "In the context of prevention . . . it's much more difficult to
identify success," said Charles Henry, director of the Office of AIDS
Programs and Policy for Los Angeles County. "How do you identify
[infections] that didn't happen?"</TE>
<TE>   Advocates say there's an urgent need for messages targeted at groups
most at risk for HIV. For instance, in minority communities, prevention
groups say that they must gear messages to men who identify themselves as
heterosexual but still have sex with other men. Those men often are at
risk of infecting unwitting female partners, as well as male lovers.</TE>
<TE>Need to Target High-Risk Groups</TE>
<TE>   In addition, advertising aimed at the gay and bisexual community in
general is often sexually provocative, so reminders about safer sex must
be explicit to compete for attention, advocates say. Tiptoeing around the
subject doesn't do anybody any good, they argue, and expecting widespread
abstinence is farfetched.</TE>
<TE>   Groups such as Stop AIDS, for example, say it is more effective to
combine prevention messages with positive images of sex. Stop AIDS
program director Steve Gibson said his group's own surveys show workshop
participants go on to practice safer sex.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, to be effective with this generation, we're going to have to
be really great marketers and use every bell and whistle that people who
sell us athletic gear, alcohol and other creature comforts do to promote
a certain type of social behavior," said Lee Klosinski, director of
education for AIDS Project Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Klosinski and others say they are suspicious of the motives of
Republican legislators who want to reduce the amount of money spent on
prevention programs. The government has budgeted $691.5 million on
domestic prevention for fiscal 2002, a $38-million increase over last
year's budget.</TE>
<TE>   Critics, meanwhile, wonder why the prevention message isn't simple
abstinence from anal intercourse.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point, you have to say: What are we getting for our money?"
said Weldon, who treated AIDS patients in San Francisco in the early
1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Conservative legislators note that progress against the disease has
slowed. New HIV infections occur at a now-steady rate of about 40,000 per
year. The number of HIV-infected U.S. residents is estimated at a record
high of up to 900,000.</TE>
<TE>Ad Campaigns Draw Fire From 2 Sides</TE>
<TE>   Prevention campaigns have recently come under increasing criticism
inside and outside government circles.</TE>
<TE>   A San Francisco prevention campaign was deemed too provocative last
year, for example, by forces in the private sector. An ABC television
affiliate rejected a commercial containing topless gay and bisexual men
and a transgendered person. KGO-TV Channel 7 officials said the messages
and images were inappropriate for daytime television. They offered to run
the ad after 10 p.m., but the group said no.</TE>
<TE>   Flare-ups have occurred elsewhere, as well. In September, the mayor of
St. Louis ordered eight billboards removed because they featured two
bare-chested African American men in an embrace. The message: "Before the
love begins, get tested. Know your HIV status."</TE>
<TE>   Ed Rhode, a spokesman for St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay, said the eight
removed billboards, funded with a Centers for Disease Control grant, were
too sexually explicit and not appropriate for the neighborhoods in which
they were installed. They were replaced with less objectionable messages,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We just didn't think it was very wise to have those types of photos
in a residential neighborhood where children can see them, and near
churches and schools," Rhode said. "The folks' hearts were in the right
place. I just don't think they went about it very smartly. They ran a bad
campaign."</TE>
<TE>   Dana Williams, whose group helped develop the St. Louis campaign,
said: "People need to take their heads out of the sand and get real about
this issue."</TE>
<TE>   In June, a media company pulled 13 bus shelter ads sponsored by the
Bronx Lesbian and Gay Health Resource Consortium, responding to
complaints from local residents. The caption read: "I'm not gay, but I
sometimes have sex with other guys. People don't understand."</TE>
<TE>   The creative agency behind the rejected San Francisco commercial said
some of its AIDS prevention clients are starting to censor themselves.
Les Pappas, president of Better World Advertising, said clients want to
tone down their own campaigns because they don't want to be singled out
for scrutiny in the new round of audits or face public repudiation.
Pappas wouldn't identify those groups.</TE>
<TE>   "We've already seen a chilling effect," Pappas said. "Just the threat
of these audits and these reviews has made people a lot more cautious."</TE>
<TE>Renewed Debate Over Explicit Warnings</TE>
<TE>   The current debate over prevention messages aggravates old tensions
over how explicitly the AIDS threat should be addressed. In the early
years of the epidemic, AIDS activists derided politicians, including
former President Ronald Reagan, for their failure even to mention the
word AIDS. And in 1987, the three major television networks rejected a
documentary in which a man demonstrated how to put a condom on a banana.
The program ultimately ran on public television.</TE>
<TE>   Prevention advocates say that the present dispute, however, is flaring
at a crucial time, just as health officials and prevention agencies are
urgently trying to combat a resurgence of risky sex behavior among gay
and bisexual men.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Evertz, the Bush administration's openly gay AIDS czar, said
Thompson supports giving local officials control over prevention efforts
in their communities. Although Evertz said he is "not overly concerned"
about the federal audits, he fears that organizations that are "really
pushing the envelope" may bring unwanted scrutiny to prevention groups in
general.</TE>
<TE>   AIDS activists and conservative legislators say they share the goal of
making prevention programs as effective as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question that what has been done is not working anymore,"
said Roland Foster, an aide to the government reform subcommittee headed
by Rep. Mark E. Souder (R-Ind.), who called for the audits. "Why don't we
consider alternatives that haven't been explored?"</TE>
<TE>   Gibson, of Stop AIDS, takes a different view, warning that the audits
could bring about an overall retreat on AIDS prevention.</TE>
<TE>   "If agencies feel like they're going to be pushed to the limits [by
auditors], they're going to be less likely to take chances. Prevention
will suffer in the long run."</TE>

<DH>Australia's tough policies to deter refugees have been met with
equal determination by those risking the trip. Some learn the hard way
that they're not welcome.</DH>
<SE>First of two parts
</SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CISARUA, Indonesia
</DL>
<LD>By day, Amal Hasan dreams of Australia--a utopia where someday she
will join her husband, rebuild her life and reside in safety.</LD>
<LD>   But at night when she closes her eyes, her dream turns to horror and
she relives the tragedy of Oct. 19, when an overloaded refugee boat
taking her to Australia sank off the island of Java, killing hundreds.</LD>
<LD>   Over and over, she sees her fellow refugees struggling underwater,
unable to reach the surface. She sees women and children clinging to
scraps of wood in the heavy seas and slipping under in exhaustion. She
watches as others drift away, never to reappear.</LD>
<TE>   Hasan, a 43-year-old refugee from Iraq, was one of 45 survivors. She
said she took a life jacket from a dead woman and then hung on to the
corpse for 20 hours to help herself stay afloat until a passing boat
rescued her.</TE>
<TE>   Now, stranded in Indonesia, she clings to the hope that she can reach
her promised land.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody on the ship had a dream, a beautiful dream about Australia,
but everybody died," she said. "For us, Australia means paradise."</TE>
<TE>   Australia has become the ultimate destination for Asia's new influx of
boat people: thousands of refugees, most of whom have fled dictatorial
regimes in Afghanistan, Iraq and other Islamic countries to seek safety
Down Under.</TE>
<TE>   Most are Muslims who claim to be victims of persecution and request
political asylum. They are willing to risk their lives for the chance to
live in a Western-style democracy that offers freedom of worship and
respect for human rights. They believe that Australia's distance from
their homelands will make it harder for their despotic rulers to hunt
them down. They picture Australia as a free and open society with
employment and educational opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Australia has done all it can to stop the flow of asylum
seekers--blockading their boats, locking up every refugee who reaches
land and denying full rights to those granted asylum.</TE>
<TE>   But they keep coming, believing that the hardships that lie ahead are
less severe than those they left behind.</TE>
<TE>   The determination is apparent among survivors of the October sinking.
Many said they would cross the sea again on the same kind of old wooden
vessel.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal was Australia--die or Australia," said Ali Hamid Ahmad, 28,
an Iraqi electrician who survived by holding on to a piece of wood but
lost a cousin. "We have nothing else to fear now. If there is a boat, we
will go."</TE>
<TE>   In Australia, some relatives of the victims charge that the
government's refugee policies contributed to the deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Australia tightened its rules in October 1999 so that refugees granted
asylum after that point can receive only temporary visas. Unlike earlier
arrivals, they cannot bring their families to join them in Australia for
at least three years, and perhaps never. If they leave Australia, they
are not allowed to return.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of not seeing their families for many years prompted
those who had stayed behind to attempt the same journey. Many passengers
of the doomed boat were women and children traveling to join husbands and
fathers who had received asylum. Of the 373 who drowned, 147 were
children and 141 were women.</TE>
<TE>   Ali Mehdi Sobie, who said he was tortured by the Iraqi government and
who was granted asylum by Australia, is a sad and angry man. He last saw
his wife and daughters in September 1999. They died trying to reach him.
Sitting on the floor of a friend's living room in a Sydney suburb, he
holds a year-old photo of his girls and fights to hold back the tears.</TE>
<TE>   "Under this temporary visa, you don't have the right to bring your
family and you don't have the right to visit them," he said. "They didn't
have a chance of seeing me for three years. I told them not to come this
way. They told me they couldn't wait forever."</TE>
<TE>   The number of asylum seekers heading to Australia began spiking in the
late 1990s. But the government's tolerance for Islamic asylum seekers
quickly evaporated, and it began enacting tough policies to deter future
arrivals.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the government has nearly succeeded in thwarting the asylum
seekers with a combination of naval patrols to stop their boats and
harsher rules for the few who manage to slip through the blockade.</TE>
<TE>   The path that the refugees follow from Afghanistan and the Middle East
is well traveled. Fleeing the repressive governments of their homelands,
they first reach safety in neighboring countries such as Pakistan or
Iran. Those with enough money stay only a few days. Others languish in
refugee camps for years.</TE>
<TE>   Their next destination is Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia. A
predominantly Muslim country, Malaysia grants open entry to citizens of
other Islamic countries.</TE>
<TE>   From there, some fly directly to Sydney but most go by boat to
Indonesia, a vast archipelago whose porous borders are easy to cross
illegally. Once in Indonesia, the refugees entrust their lives to
avaricious smugglers who pack them aboard leaky wooden boats at $1,000 a
head for the perilous 300-mile journey to northern Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Usually, the boats aim for Ashmore Reef or Christmas Island, outlying
Australian islands that are closer to Indonesia than they are to the
Australian mainland.</TE>
<TE>   About 4,000 refugees reached Australia last year, and about 3,000 were
granted asylum. Those numbers are far less than in European countries but
enough to worry the government. With a population of 19 million,
Australia is fearful of being overrun by a wave of immigrants and has
tried to make the continent appear as unfriendly to refugees as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "The answer is to make sure these people don't come into this part of
the world in the first place," Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said.</TE>
<TE>   Founded as a British penal colony in 1788, Australia has practiced
racial discrimination during much of its existence.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1800s, the indigenous Aborigines were gunned down and pushed
off the land much like Native Americans in the United States. During the
1950s, the government took Aborigine children away from their families
and placed them in boarding schools, creating what is known as the
"Stolen Generation."</TE>
<TE>   During the first half of the 1900s, the government maintained a "White
Australia" policy that allowed entry only to immigrants of European
descent.</TE>
<TE>   In recent decades, growing numbers of immigrants from Asia and other
parts of the world have been accepted, but whites still make up the
overwhelming majority.</TE>
<TE>   In August, Australia's hard-line refugee policy caught the world's
attention when the Norwegian cargo ship Tampa rescued more than 430
refugees, most of them Iraqis and Afghans, from their sinking boat in the
Indian Ocean. When the Tampa tried to deliver them to their destination
of Christmas Island, the Australian government barred the ship from
docking.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister John Howard was determined to prevent the refugees from
setting foot on the island so that they could not claim asylum.</TE>
<TE>   In a show of force, he ordered Australian commandos to board the
Norwegian vessel. Days later, the refugees were loaded onto an Australian
warship and transported to remote island nations in the Pacific,
including Nauru, where most of them remain.</TE>
<TE>   The government has agreed to pay $15 million to Nauru and Papua New
Guinea to set up camps and process the refugees, the first step in what
Australia calls its "Pacific Solution." The Australian navy is now
intercepting boatloads of refugees and transporting them to the two
nations.</TE>
<TE>   Howard's refugee policy was condemned internationally but applauded at
home. In November, he won reelection to a third term.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups warn that Howard's attempt to pull up the
drawbridge could undermine a 5-decade-old United Nations treaty aimed at
protecting refugees fleeing persecution. As a party to the convention,
Australia must grant asylum to refugees who arrive in the country and
have well-founded fears of persecution in their homelands.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the mid-1990s, when asylum seekers were arriving in small
numbers, Australia began taking a harsh approach.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other signatories to the 1951 agreement, Australia detains all
applicants for asylum who arrive without a visa or proper documentation
until their cases are decided.</TE>
<TE>   Many destroy their documents en route to Australia in the belief that
it will make it harder for the government to deport them.</TE>
<TE>   Refugees who are denied asylum but come from countries such as Iraq
that don't have diplomatic relations with Australia cannot be deported.
They are locked up indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   Australia built six detention centers to handle the flow. Critics have
begun calling the system the "Australian gulag."</TE>
<TE>   Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock says the refugees are free to
leave detention any time--as long as they also leave the country. But
some remain in the camps for years, afraid of imprisonment or execution
if they return home.</TE>
<TE>   After the Tampa incident and the Sept. 11 attacks in the United
States, Australia tightened its rules for asylum seekers even more.</TE>
<TE>   Howard has suggested that the asylum seekers might include terrorists,
heightening public fears of the newcomers. None, however, have been
charged with terrorist activity.</TE>
<TE>   The government hurriedly enacted a law barring refugees from receiving
permanent residence if they did not apply before Sept. 27. Under the law,
any refugee who now lands at Christmas Island or Ashmore Reef is
ineligible for asylum. With the long journey to the mainland and navy
ships searching for refugee boats, few asylum seekers are likely to reach
Australia by sea.</TE>
<TE>   The refugees say they are fleeing the same conditions that prompted
the United States and its allies to seek the overthrow of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein and Afghanistan's Taliban regime. But Australia casts the
refugees as conniving gate-crashers trying to take advantage of the
generosity of its people.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are experiencing here is what most developed countries are
experiencing, and that is the asylum system is being used abusively by
people who are free enough to travel and have the money to get there,"
Ruddock said in an interview in Sydney.</TE>
<TE>   Ruddock said there are 12 million refugees worldwide and no country
can take them all. The solution, he said, is to make their countries safe
so they can go home. Australia has committed 1,550 troops to the war in
Afghanistan and is considering sending peacekeeping troops.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Ruddock announced that Australia would no longer process
applications from Afghan asylum seekers now that the Taliban has been
ousted and a transitional government has taken power in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Australia calls the boat people "queue jumpers" who take precious
slots away from people who would otherwise be admitted under a program to
accept 12,000 needy refugees a year from camps around the world,
including the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   But to refugees escaping their homelands, it is unclear where "the
queue" begins. In most countries, Australian embassies and consulates do
not accept asylum applications. Applying through the U.N. for refugee
status can be hopelessly time consuming.</TE>
<TE>   About two dozen people who died on the ill-fated boat in October had
already received U.N. refugee status but had grown tired of waiting for a
country to accept them. Some had waited two years, U.N. officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Ali Mehdi Sobie's story is typical of refugees granted asylum in
Australia.</TE>
<TE>   He said he was arrested and tortured by the Iraqi government after he
delivered food and weapons to rebels during an unsuccessful 1991 uprising
against Hussein that was encouraged by the United States.</TE>
<TE>   During interrogation, he said, he was tied by his feet from a ceiling
fan and spun around in circles, which injured his hip. He now walks with
a limp and says he needs corrective surgery.</TE>
<TE>   After his release, he and his family fled to Iran. There the
government, burdened by a growing refugee population, kept them from
getting jobs and prohibited their children from attending school. Sobie
decided to seek asylum in Australia.</TE>
<TE>   After flying to Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, he spent six days
traveling by boat from the Indonesian island of Lombok to Ashmore Reef.
"There was always a danger the boat would sink," he said. "Most of the
time we were praying."</TE>
<TE>   Like most refugees, he arrived in Australia with high expectations
that were quickly dashed with his detention. But after 11 months, he was
given a temporary protection visa and released.</TE>
<TE>   Over his protests, his wife, Zaynab, 31, and their daughters Donia,
14, Marwa, 12, and Hijran, 10, left Iran to join him.</TE>
<TE>   They traveled to Cisarua, a town south of Jakarta, where refugees
congregate, and met smugglers who agreed to take them to Australia.</TE>
<TE>   The smugglers took them in buses with darkened windows and, in the
early hours of Oct. 19, arrived at the harbor where their boat waited.</TE>
<TE>   Once the refugees saw the small, decrepit boat, some hesitated to
board. But police who were aiding the smugglers forced them to get on,
survivors said. There were only a few dozen life jackets for the hundreds
of passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours, the water pump and engine failed and the boat began
taking on water. Soon after, the vessel capsized, trapping many of the
refugees underwater.</TE>
<TE>   "My eyes were still open in the water, and I saw everybody dying, men,
women and children," Amal Hasan said.</TE>
<TE>   The boat sank about 3 p.m. Many passengers grabbed pieces of wood that
came loose from the wreck but couldn't hang on through the long night. A
fishing boat spotted the survivors late the next morning. Among them were
a 12-year-old girl who lost her entire family and a pregnant woman who
lost her husband and both her children.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesian authorities arrested the alleged leader of the smuggling
ring, an Egyptian using a Turkish passport, but they say Indonesia has no
law against human trafficking. He faces prosecution for entering the
country illegally.</TE>
<TE>   The sinking aroused the sympathy of distant countries and speeded up
the process of resettlement for the survivors. So far, 42 have received
U.N. refugee status. Canada, Norway, Finland and Switzerland are
considering taking some. Australia has accepted one, the 12-year-old, who
has an uncle in Sydney.</TE>
<TE>   With the death of his wife and daughters, Sobie is one refugee who has
gotten the message that asylum seekers are not welcome in Australia.</TE>
<TE>   "If I knew the Australian government would treat me and my family this
way, I would have preferred to stay in Iraq and be executed by Saddam
Hussein rather than be executed this way," he said. "By killing my
family, they are killing me."</TE>

<HD>Cynicism Colors Argentines' Mood</HD>
<DH>Economy: In Buenos Aires, workers and residents express little hope
for improvement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<AU>VANESSA PETIT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES
</DL>
<LD>In this city of walking wounded, Marta Petachi offers a bitter
solution to Argentina's unending economic ordeal: "They should set fire
to the whole country."</LD>
<LD>   "We are all poor in this rich country," Petachi, who lives in
Martinez, a working-class suburb of the capital, said Thursday. "They
have sold us out until we have nothing left. I cry for Argentina. Pity
those of us who have very little. Because those with more have taken it
and left."</LD>
<LD>   Cynical and disgusted, many Argentines blame a succession of inept or
venal politicians for their pain and express little hope that President
Eduardo Duhalde, who became the country's fifth president in two weeks
Wednesday, will make any difference in their lives.</LD>
<TE>   "If the last president was a piece of garbage, the new one will
continue being a piece of garbage," said Jose Palavecino, a government
worker whose comfortable middle-class existence of five years ago has
been shorn of every luxury.</TE>
<TE>   Salary cuts have forced him to cut off his cable TV, eliminate
long-distance phone calls, disconnect a home dryer and forget about his
weekly nights out at restaurants. With the government essentially broke,
he hasn't been paid in a month. Only a weekend job as a security guard
puts food on his table.</TE>
<TE>   Palavecino's harsh words are typical these days among his countrymen,
who express little hope that their luck will turn. Devaluation, the
return of high inflation and an even deeper recession are what many see
around the corner as the country prepares to abandon a failed 10-year
economic experiment.</TE>
<TE>   "They say countries get the governments they deserve, but I tell you
it's not so. Here there are many people who struggle 12 or 14 hours a day
for miserable salaries trying to get ahead," said Julia Berasadi, a
retired homemaker. "Everything is an abuse to the people who want to
succeed."</TE>
<TE>Businessman Expects 'More Hypocrites'</TE>
<TE>   Juan Whittaker, a businessman specializing in vinyl products whose
wholesale prices have gone up 40% in recent weeks, says he isn't
optimistic about Duhalde's prospects. "This man is more of the same. More
thieves. More hypocrites in the government. Five governments in two
weeks, and five of the same thing," he said. "Enough."</TE>
<TE>   Argentina's economy has been coming apart for years, with the
government taking successive measures to preserve the currency's
one-to-one peg to the dollar, and to avoid a default on $132 billion in
public debt. But each measure only seemed to put people at ground level
in a deeper hole. Now they have nothing to show for their sacrifices.</TE>
<TE>   One such budget-cutting measure two years ago cost Ramon Soria his job
in a federal ministry. He's been selling lottery tickets ever since on
street corners in the capital's Palermo neighborhood. Now ticket sales
are down by two-thirds and he worries whether he'll be able to keep even
this job.</TE>
<TE>   "Argentina is a disaster, and now they are changing presidents every
three days," he said. "The new one is like all the rest--a liar and a
thief."</TE>
<TE>   Equally cynical was hairstylist Gonzalo Pan, who works at an upscale
salon on Avenida Santa Fe. Will Duhalde make a difference? "The truth is,
nothing will change. It's all the same gang," Pan said. "I'm making half
what I earned a year ago and working more, 12 hours a day, six days a
week. And I still can't afford my hobbies--bicycling, the movies, eating
out."</TE>
<TE>Savings Withdrawal Limits Opened Eyes</TE>
<TE>   What finally brought the crisis home to Argentina's middle class was
the $1,000 monthly limit imposed Dec. 3 on savings withdrawals. Designed
to stop a run on bank deposits, it sent people out of their homes and
into the streets in demonstrations called cacerolazos, after the
casserole pots that many clanged together. The groundswell ultimately
forced President Fernando de la Rua to resign Dec. 20.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, two members of Congress have served--very briefly and
reluctantly--as president in addition to Adolfo Rodriguez Saa, who was
forced to resign after allegations that his Cabinet included shady
politicians whom Argentines associated more with the cause of the
country's problems than with a solution. Duhalde was named president by a
special session of Congress on Tuesday to fill out the two years left in
De la Rua's term.</TE>
<TE>   Limits on savings withdrawals have caused a paralysis of commerce
throughout the nation and brought businesspeople such as Maria Saccone,
owner of the Vanessa ladies' wear boutique, to the brink of ruin. Her
customers have barely enough cash to make essential purchases, much less
to buy her imported apparel, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in total chaos," Saccone said. "The restrictions completely
stopped our business."</TE>
<TE>   The withdrawal limits have also caused a bottleneck in the banking
system to the point that retirees still haven't received their December
pensions or the annual 13th-month bonuses that are a tradition here.</TE>
<TE>   Ernesto Delboni, 79, a retired cabinetmaker, has moved with his two
children to his house in the country because he can no longer afford city
life.</TE>
<TE>   "The future is very uncertain. I have sons who are 40 years old and
don't have jobs. So they are living with me," said Delboni as he was
leaving a bank in Martinez, where he was finally able to withdraw his
November pension payment Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Retirees living on fixed incomes are especially fretful. "I am retired
and I get 400 pesos a month, which isn't enough for my taxes and bills,"
said homemaker Berasadi, 66. "And I still have to eat. How are they going
to reactivate the nation if the people have no money? It's impossible."</TE>
<TE>   The devaluation of the peso that Duhalde has signaled is coming is
expected to cause a deeper recession and a new round of layoffs because a
range of businesses from drugstores to auto dealers that sell imported
goods or products made with imported components will see the buying power
of Argentines shrink overnight.</TE>
<TE>   "Auto sales and real estate are always the first affected by a
devaluation. Our sales have already dropped by 40% to 50% because of the
bank restrictions," said Eduardo Ganduglia, sales manager of the Perfecto
Lopez Ford dealership on Avenida Santa Fe. "Am I hopeful with Duhalde? I
must be, because he is the last chance."</TE>
<TE>   Jose Reboledo, the owner of the Tarzan bar on Esmeralda Street in the
city center, said people are "disoriented because they don't know what to
do. They don't know where this is going to lead." As for his
Spanish-themed bar, business is down 60% over the last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost no one comes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Argentines are complaining that price increases are already showing up
in drugstores and hardware and appliance stores as merchants anticipate
the weakening of the peso and readjust prices of imported goods.</TE>
<TE>   Standing in a bank line Thursday, rancher Miguel Russo said that some
goods he needs, such as tires and tubing for a tractor, aren't available
at any cost because merchants are waiting to assess the impact of the
devaluation.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope Duhalde does something, and why not?" he said. "There is
nothing left to rob in the country."</TE>

<HD>No Charges Filed in Torricelli Probe</HD>
<DH>Courts: The outcome of a political-favors inquiry on the senator is
a setback for Justice Department.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Justice Department said Thursday it will not file charges
against Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.), ending an influence-peddling
investigation that threatened to derail his hard-charging career and hurt
his party's chances of keeping its Senate majority.</LD>
<LD>   The decision, announced by the U.S. attorney's office in New York,
clears a cloud that had hovered over Torricelli for more than a year. It
had made him a vulnerable political target in the November elections,
when the one-seat Democratic edge in the Senate will be at stake.</LD>
<LD>   The probe's outcome is an embarrassing setback for the Justice
Department, which devoted years to the investigation and faced criticism
that it was trying to force the senator into a legal surrender last year
by leaking details of its inquiry to the press.</LD>
<TE>   To many in Washington, the conclusion of the investigation was seen as
perhaps the last of many Clinton-era campaign finance scandals that
produced more headlines than convictions.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the people who were tied up in these messes were never
indicted and never faced a legal penalty," said Larry Sabato, a professor
of government at the University of Virginia. "Campaign finance law is
full of loopholes, and the smart ones are good at going right to the edge
but no further. Torricelli is a smart one."</TE>
<TE>   A brash politician known on Capitol Hill as "The Torch," Torricelli
was accused of trading political favors for cash, carpets, suits and
other gifts from a wealthy New Jersey businessman, David Chang.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Atty. Mary Jo White, the Manhattan-based prosecutor who
supervised the probe, said she had decided not to press charges after "an
exhaustive investigation" by her office, the FBI, the Internal Revenue
Service and the U.S. Customs Service. In Washington, Deputy Atty. Gen.
Larry D. Thompson said he was satisfied with White's decision.</TE>
<TE>   Elated by the news, Torricelli issued a statement Thursday expressing
gratitude to supporters and saying he was eager to move beyond an ordeal
he described as "a lengthy and personally painful experience."</TE>
<TE>   White said the Justice Department had delivered materials from the
investigation to the Senate Ethics Committee, which could pursue its own
investigation of Torricelli.</TE>
<TE>   But political experts said the committee is unlikely to move against
Torricelli, especially with Democrats in control of the chamber. And
Torricelli's attorneys said that, even if the committee does investigate,
they are confident it will find in favor of their client.</TE>
<TE>   A committee official declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said he was pleased that
his confidence in Torricelli "has been justified" and that his colleague
"can return his full energies to the continued representation of his
constituents and service to the Senate."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Torricelli observers predicted an immediate reemergence of a
politician who was known for his prodigious fund-raising and news
generating talents before the investigation forced him into a defensive
crouch.</TE>
<TE>   Torricelli, who was elected to the House in 1982 and won a Senate seat
vacated by Bill Bradley in 1996, has never denied receiving gifts from
Chang, said to include Persian rugs, Italian-made suits and cash. But he
has steadfastly denied that he did anything illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law prohibits government officials from accepting gifts except
from relatives and friends. Torricelli, 50, has repeatedly stressed that
he once considered Chang a friend.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the government's case hinged on the testimony of Chang, who
two years ago pleaded guilty to making $53,700 in illegal contributions
to Torricelli's 1996 campaign. Chang then began cooperating with
prosecutors, alleging that he lavished Torricelli with gifts in exchange
for help from the senator on various business deals.</TE>
<TE>   In one instance, Torricelli accompanied Chang on a trip to Seoul,
leaning on top officials there to grant favorable consideration to an
attempt by Chang to purchase a South Korean insurance company.</TE>
<TE>   But Chang was a problematic witness. He has used multiple passports,
multiple Social Security numbers and was married to two women at the same
time. In one court motion, prosecutors wrote that Chang "simply cannot be
trusted at his word."</TE>
<TE>   As prosecutors grappled with Chang's credibility problems, details of
the case began to emerge in New York and New Jersey papers last year,
prompting an outcry from Torricelli and some of his colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   Torricelli complained that he was being "publicly raped" by the FBI.
In June, Sens. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.)
wrote to Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, expressing their "dismay about recent
press reports" concerning the Torricelli investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The revelations wounded Torricelli enough that state party officials
in New Jersey began to call for a more candid accounting of his
relationship with Chang. Others suggested he resign or not seek
reelection this year. But Torricelli, who in his political career has
relished confrontation, said he never considered stepping down.</TE>
<TE>   The ordeal does not seem to have significantly damaged Torricelli's
standing with voters in New Jersey, where recent polls show he continues
to have a 60% approval rating.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a number of prominent Republicans have decided not to run
against him.</TE>
<TE>   However, experts said the Justice Department probe will likely take a
toll on Torricelli's national ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   The details that surfaced "will make it very difficult for Democrats
to consider him for president or vice presidential nominations," Sabato
said.</TE>

<HD>Airline Defends Banning Bush Guard From Flight</HD>
<DH>Security: Those involved say the Arab American agent was either
abusive or a victim of bias.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The armed Secret Service agent had boarded the plane, shaken hands
with the pilot and buckled in for departure when a mechanical problem
sent everyone back to the gate.</LD>
<LD>   The Arab American agent, a seven-year veteran of the service en route
from Baltimore to Texas on Christmas to guard President Bush, would have
to take another flight.</LD>
<LD>   What happened next on American Airlines Flight 363 is the focus of a
Secret Service investigation and a threatened lawsuit--a tangle of events
that offers a glimpse into the psychology of both sides of the debate
over using ethnic or racial profiling in the post-Sept. 11 world. At
issue is the discretion of pilots to keep passengers they deem a security
risk off their planes, even if the person has cleared security
checkpoints.</LD>
<TE>   The agent charges that he was singled out solely because he is Arab
American. The airline says its pilot did what was necessary to protect
his passengers from an armed individual who became verbally abusive
during questioning.</TE>
<TE>   What had been a relatively quiet matter--with Bush saying last week
he'd be "madder than heck" if profiling was involved--exploded Thursday
in an exchange of accusations between lawyers for the agent and officials
of the airline, with each side accusing the other of misrepresenting the
truth.</TE>
<TE>   This much is clear: Instead of an easy boarding on his new flight,
which had been held for the rerouted passengers, the agent rapidly came
under suspicion from a worried pilot who questioned his credentials.</TE>
<TE>   John Relman, a Washington attorney who represents the agent, said his
client's goal "is to try to get procedures and policies changed so pilots
do not have unfettered discretion. It's not about money. It's about
making sure this doesn't happen again when there is no legitimate
security concern."</TE>
<TE>   In a brief statement read by his attorneys, the agent said "it has
never been my desire to make this incident personal."</TE>
<TE>   The agent was identified as Walid Shater by the Washington Post; his
attorneys declined to release his name but said he is a 33-year-old
father of two. The agent complained last week to the American Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee about his treatment, telling officials
there he felt he had an obligation to come forward because he believed
his civil rights had been violated.</TE>
<TE>   Islamic advocacy groups and other civil rights activists have pointed
to the Secret Service agent's case as the most extreme example of what
they allege has been a string of abuses by the airlines, which are not
allowed under law to use ethnic profiling in making security decisions.</TE>
<TE>   But pilots groups, backed by the airlines, say a pilot's authority to
determine who is safe to transport is vital and should not be changed.</TE>
<TE>   "The captain of an airplane, like the captain of a ship, is fully and
totally responsible for everything that goes on on that flight, and he
must have enough discretion to act if he believes there is any threat
against the airplane," said Capt. John Cox, a security specialist for the
Air Line Pilots Assn.</TE>
<TE>   In an unusual step, American Airlines on Thursday released the pilot's
incident report as well as a detailed account written by an airline
security official, saying it was "obligated" to respond to the
allegations.</TE>
<TE>   The release of the reports, which portray the agent as "nervous and
anxious" as well as "confrontational," came a week after American
Airlines officials said they had offered an apology to the agent for the
misunderstanding. At the same time, the airline said it backed its
pilot's decision.</TE>
<TE>   The two accounts--one given by lawyers for the agent at the news
conference and the other contained in the American Airlines news
release--seem barely recognizable as the same event. About 90 minutes
passed from the time the agent was asked to leave the plane to the time
it took off without him--making him a day late for reporting to duty with
the president's security detail at Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   The agent said he was asked to leave the plane by an American Airlines
employee--along with several other passengers--for additional security
checks. He told his attorneys he took his carry-on baggage with him,
informing the flight attendant he had left his coat and other articles
behind but would be back.</TE>
<TE>   The pilot's report said flight attendants told him they were
"concerned" about the actions of the armed passenger. The pilot said the
agent had left the plane with his carry-on items still in his seat,
telling the flight attendant not to leave without him. Once he was gone,
a flight attendant noticed books with "Arabic-style print" that he had
left behind and informed the pilot.</TE>
<TE>   The book in question, the agent's attorneys said Thursday, was an
English-language text titled "The Crusades Through Arab Eyes" that he had
ordered from Amazon.com. He speaks Arabic but is not literate in the
language, his attorneys said. The man sitting next to the agent has come
forward to say the flight attendant saw the book after riffling through
the agent's possessions once he left the plane.</TE>
<TE>   When the agent returned to the plane, the pilot said he took a closer
look at the paperwork allowing him to carry a weapon onto the plane and
found discrepancies, saying the forms were unreadable and had missing
items.</TE>
<TE>   The pilot at that point said he came out of the cockpit to speak to
the agent, who "appeared nervous and anxious."</TE>
<TE>   According to the security official, who was contacted by the airline's
Texas headquarters, the pilot "first requested a fax containing all
wanted terrorist photos American [Airlines] had available."</TE>
<TE>   The pilot was told that was not possible and was asked what sort of
problem he was encountering. He told the security official that he had an
armed passenger who said he was a Secret Service agent who carried
paperwork with flight numbers scratched out.</TE>
<TE>   The agent's attorneys said the changes were made by an American
Airlines desk agent. Another copy of the form was filled out by the
Secret Service agent, but it also was considered incomplete by the pilot.</TE>
<TE>   The pilot then asked the security official to fax him a copy of a
Secret Service credential to verify that it was the same as the
credential carried by the agent. The agent's attorneys say that by that
point, his credential already had been checked by three local law
enforcement officials.</TE>
<TE>   According to the American Airlines security officer's account, he then
advised the pilot to verify the agent's credentials with local law
enforcement officials again, saying they should be familiar with them.</TE>
<TE>   "[The pilot] said, 'You work for an airline, you know how easy it
would be to get a fake ID,' " according to the report. The security
official then offered to call the Secret Service to verify the agent's
identity and asked the pilot to request a contact number from the agent.</TE>
<TE>   "The captain said that we should not use his information because he
could have a friend answering the phone when we called," the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials pointed out Thursday that numbers for the White
House and Secret Service appear in the front of every phone book.</TE>
<TE>   The security officer said the next call he got was from a ticket agent
saying the Secret Service agent had "verbally abused" the pilot.
According to the pilot, the agent said he had the "powers of the White
House" behind him. But the agent said it was the pilot who was abusive.</TE>
<TE>   After the agent asked the pilot why he was not allowed to board, the
pilot responded that the agent should "never address me directly,"
according to one of the agent's attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   "The agent, almost unable to believe his ears, told the pilot that
these credentials would get him into the White House," one of his
attorneys, Christy Lopez, said.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the plane took off without him. The next day, American
Airlines rescinded a flight ban they had put on the agent, who was
traveling on tickets purchased through the government travel agency and
marked as such. The airline flew him to Dallas.</TE>

<HD>A Title for Miami and Face-Saver for the BCS</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Streaking past Nebraska in a flood of long passes and dazzling
runs, the University of Miami crushed Nebraska in college football's
title game at the Rose Bowl Thursday night, capping an undefeated season
and making the Hurricanes undisputed national champs.</LD>
<LD>   The winning score was 37-14, but Miami put the game beyond reach early
and piled it on en route to a 34-0 halftime lead.</LD>
<LD>   The outcome also counted as a partial victory for an embattled formula
that seeks to place the best two teams in the title game.</LD>
<TE>   And, football aside, the 88th installment of the storied bowl was a
welcome boost to a local economy that suffered through a sluggish holiday
season.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the tourist dollars came from an army of Nebraska fans--as
many as 60,000 by some estimates--who bathed the stadium in a sea of red
only to watch glumly as the Cornhuskers were swept away by the
orange-and-green Hurricanes.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to go out and make a statement from the beginning," Miami
offensive tackle Bryant McKinnie said. "We knew that would quiet their
fans down."</TE>
<TE>   This was the first time the Rose Bowl hosted a title game for the
4-year-old bowl championship series, commonly called the BCS. So, in many
ways, it was an unusual installment for college football's most
traditional event.</TE>
<TE>   The so-called "Granddaddy of Them All" was moved from its usual Jan. 1
date and for the first time started at dusk. Security was unprecedented,
with cars searched in the parking lots and the 93,781 fans patted down as
they arrived.</TE>
<TE>   The extra precautions led to half-mile-long lines at stadium gates and
considerable grumbling: "You'd think they never had a Rose Bowl game
before," Nebraska fan Mary Ellen Eglseder complained. Still, most fans
arrived early enough to reach their seats by the 5:20 p.m. kickoff.</TE>
<TE>   Departing from its tradition of pitting the champions from the Pacific
10 and Big Ten conferences, this Rose Bowl matched the top two teams
selected by the BCS.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other college sports, Division I-A football has no playoffs.
The BCS was created to fill the void by combining the rankings from the
Associated Press and ESPN/USA Today polls, eight computer services and
several other calculations.</TE>
<TE>   The championship rotates among four bowl games: the Orange, Sugar,
Fiesta and Rose.</TE>
<TE>Nebraska Helps Make Critics' Case</TE>
<TE>   So Miami came from the Big East Conference and Nebraska from the Big
12. As for the latter, critics have argued that the BCS sent the wrong
team to Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   In its final game of the regular season, Nebraska seemingly fell out
of the title race with an embarrassing 62-36 loss to Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   But several highly ranked teams--including Texas and
Tennessee--suffered upsets in the ensuing weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The Cornhuskers, while not playing another game, rebounded to No. 4 in
the major polls. More surprisingly, they jumped to No. 2 in the BCS
ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Many fans thought Pacific 10 champion Oregon (11-1), ranked second, or
Big 12 champion Colorado (10-3), ranked third, were more deserving. The
clamor grew louder when Oregon dominated Colorado, 38-16, in the Fiesta
Bowl on New Year's Day.</TE>
<TE>   As if to emphasize this point, fans dressed in Oregon green could be
seen scattered among the crowd of red and orange on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously some people didn't think Nebraska should be here," Miami
receiver Daryl Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   Don't count local merchants among them.</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska brought enough fans to fill three-quarters of the stadium.
Hotels rented their rooms at inflated prices. Residents around the
stadium were hawking parking spaces on their lawns for $25 a car.</TE>
<TE>   That led a game planner to comment that the teams and their
conferences--which received a whopping $11.75 million each for reaching
this game--weren't the only ones making money.</TE>
<TE>   "The participating conferences gain a great deal from this, but the
real winner is the economy of Southern California," said Mitch Dorger,
chief executive of the Tournament of Roses.</TE>
<TE>   And though critics might say Oregon would have provided a more
competitive opponent than Nebraska, the BCS profited by way of a
response: In the end, the sometimes mystifying BCS formula produced a
worthy champion.</TE>
<TE>   Miami, which ended its season a perfect 12-0, wasted little time in
proving that.</TE>
<TE>Hurricanes End the Suspense Early</TE>
<TE>   After an uneventful first few minutes, the Hurricane defense forced
Nebraska's Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback, Eric Crouch, to fumble and
the offense capitalized with a 49-yard touchdown pass on the very next
snap.</TE>
<TE>   That quickly, the rout was on.</TE>
<TE>   "Miami lives and dies with big plays and they were killing us all
night long," Nebraska linebacker Jamie Burrow said afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Hurricane running back Clinton Portis scored on a 39-yard touchdown
run. Safety James Lewis returned an interception 47 yards into the end
zone. Quarterback Ken Dorsey threw two more touchdown passes and the
score was 34-0 at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to play catch-up," Nebraska running back Dahrran Diedrick
said. "Our offense wasn't built for that."</TE>
<TE>   The Cornhuskers (11-2) managed two late touchdowns, not nearly enough
to keep Miami from dancing on the brightly painted field after the final
gun.</TE>
<TE>   Any more questions about the national champion?</TE>
<TE>   "I tell you what," Miami offensive lineman Joaquin Gonzalez said.
"12-0."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Hits Base as Al Qaeda Rebuilds</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Aircraft pound a camp where Bin Laden's network was
regrouping, the Pentagon says. Afghan forces close in on suspected site
of the Taliban's spiritual leader.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>U.S. warplanes Thursday struck a military compound in eastern
Afghanistan where members of Osama bin Laden's terrorist network were
regrouping, the Pentagon said. The attack was the latest in a series of
calibrated strikes designed to pound Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders so they
cannot regain power.</LD>
<LD>   Thursday's strike was the third since Dec. 20 in a campaign to destroy
sites where intelligence analysts believe that elite elements of the
ousted regime and the terrorists it sheltered are seeking to consolidate
and regroup. The attacks draw a stark picture of the dogged U.S. military
pursuit of what Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld on Thursday called
the top "10, 12, 15, 20" Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders.</LD>
<LD>   Mindful of other recent conflicts--notably the 1991 Persian Gulf War
with Iraq--in which the U.S. pulled its troops out quickly, leaving
remnants of a militarily defeated force to rebuild its power base,
Rumsfeld said Thursday that the Bush administration has no intention of
following suit in Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   In his first appearance before reporters in the new year, Rumsfeld
repeatedly stressed the effectiveness of the U.S. military campaign
against Al Qaeda, even while acknowledging that the Pentagon had yet to
accomplish President Bush's stated goal of bringing its leaders to
justice.</TE>
<TE>   "We do want to capture Osama bin Laden and [Mullah Mohammed] Omar and
the Al Qaeda and Taliban leadership. We're working on it. But even if we
were to capture them tomorrow, our job would still be far from over,"
Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   "The network is well organized. It's global. We continue to get
additional intelligence information which reinforces our conviction as to
the breadth and depth of that terrorist network. So we do have a good
distance to go," he said.</TE>
<TE>   This morning in Kabul, the Afghan capital, Abdullah Jan, an official
in the Ministry of the Interior, offered some information on the search
for Omar.</TE>
<TE>   Government troops are in Baghran, in northern Helmand province, an
extremely mountainous area to which Omar is believed to have escaped, Jan
said. He said there is at least an 80% chance that the Taliban leader is
in that area, which is now mostly encircled by government troops.</TE>
<TE>   Omar is being protected by a Taliban commander, Abdul Wahed Baghrani,
who has about 1,000 armed Afghan Taliban with him, Jan said. It is
unclear how many foreign Taliban may also be there.</TE>
<TE>   In his news conference, Rumsfeld denied that the failure to capture
Bin Laden is a sign of ineffectiveness in the global war on terrorism
sparked by the Sept. 11 terror attacks on the World Trade Center and
Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "One has to appreciate the difficulty of tracking down a single human
being anywhere," Rumsfeld said. ". . . Obviously, our goal is to find
them, and we intend to keep pursuing that. But our real goal is to see
that people are not committing terrorist acts."</TE>
<TE>A Complicated Endgame</TE>
<TE>   The persistent but low-level military operations by U.S. forces
underscored the messy, difficult endgame in Afghanistan, where thousands
of Taliban and Al Qaeda militants are presumed to have melted back into
society, and where the remaining elements of the two groups who have
survived the U.S. campaign appear to be making attempts to reassemble
wherever and however they can.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is, the Taliban leadership wasn't smashed. It escaped. It
didn't stay there and fight," said Anthony Cordesman, a former Defense
Department intelligence officer and now senior foreign affairs analyst at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to get those last elements, but you are talking about just
dozens of people and very small targets--targets the size of a high
school.</TE>
<TE>   "It requires a really exhausting, difficult, low but steady level of
operations. But these leaders still out there are charismatic figures,
ones whose ability to create future problems could be very great. We
can't afford to falter or stop," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In a related development, the Washington Times reported Thursday that,
according to U.S. intelligence officials, American and allied military
forces were increasing aerial reconnaissance flights over Somalia,
possibly in preparation for raids against Al Qaeda bases there.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the possibility of attacks against Somalia or Yemen,
Rumsfeld replied, "It doesn't do any good at all for me to be speculating
about different countries and what we might do next, because I think
they'll draw questions for the future." He refused further comment.</TE>
<TE>Al Qaeda Site Attacked</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
that B-1 bombers, AC-130 gunships and F/A-18 attack jets unleashed
airstrikes Thursday on an Al Qaeda leadership compound in the Khowst
region of Afghanistan near the border with Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   The compound, built atop the ruins of one hit by U.S. cruise missiles
in 1998 in retaliation for attacks on two U.S. embassies in East Africa
and bombed again last fall, "has been a place where Al Qaeda goes to
regroup," Myers said.</TE>
<TE>   It was not clear how many Al Qaeda members may have been killed in the
attack.</TE>
<TE>   As Myers and Rumsfeld briefed reporters, U.S. Marines and Army special
operations troops in Afghanistan continued to assist forces of the new
interim government in the hunt for Bin Laden and Omar.</TE>
<TE>   The number of Al Qaeda and Taliban detainees in U.S. custody,
meanwhile, grew Thursday to 248. Of those, 225 are in the southern city
of Kandahar; 14 are at Bagram airfield near Kabul; eight--including
American John Walker Lindh--are on the U.S. Navy amphibious assault ship
Bataan; and one is in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld said a high-security jail is being built at the U.S. Navy
base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to hold the detainees. The base has held
Caribbean refugees in the past but is not equipped to hold a large number
of hardened criminals.</TE>
<TE>   The prisoners "are very hard cases, for the most part," Rumsfeld said,
adding that the question of how to safely transport them from Afghanistan
to a Caribbean island half a world away is a difficult one.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been three or four incidents where these folks have
demonstrated their determination to kill themselves, kill others and/or
escape," Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   The prisoners, described by Washington as "battlefield detainees,"
have not been charged with crimes. Rumsfeld said no decision had been
reached on how to conduct any military trials authorized by the
president.</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, there were reports of extensive military operations
underway near Kandahar on Thursday, with Afghan defense forces pursuing
and capturing Taliban soldiers in the search for Omar. A report on Kabul
television said the captured Taliban forces were believed to have been
guarding Omar.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate operation, Kabul television reported, government forces
said they had discovered caves in Helmand and Kandahar provinces where
Taliban remnants were holding about 500 prisoners. As anti-Taliban forces
advanced in various areas of the country, fleeing Taliban members took
prisoners with them, and that appears to have been the case with those
found in the caves. The prisoners were released and sent home on buses.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations were continuing in Helmand province with another group of
Taliban soldiers who have refused to surrender, according to the British
Broadcasting Corp.'s Persian-language radio service.</TE>
<TE>   In Kabul, about 300 Afghan Taliban prisoners were released by the new
government and taken into custody by ethnic Pushtun elders. It is
believed that they will return to their villages.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, Afghan villagers continue to report that U.S. bombs have
hit civilians.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the U.N. mission in Afghanistan, Stephanie Bunker,
said local reports that the mission considers reliable indicate that U.S.
bombs struck a village in southeastern Afghanistan on three occasions.
According to the reports, 52 people were killed, all civilians. The U.N.
has not yet confirmed the report, Bunker said.</TE>
<TE>   But Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations special envoy to Afghanistan,
was extremely disturbed by the incident, Bunker said.</TE>
<TE>   "He plans to take the first opportunity to bring up the episode with
the interim administration in Afghanistan and with American diplomats,"
Bunker said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the U.N.'s concerns, Rumsfeld said that an investigation
was underway. But, he cautioned, the Pentagon believes that many such
reports circulating in Afghanistan are spurious.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to try to know what the facts are," Rumsfeld said. "And to
the extent there are facts that suggest there were civilian casualties
that might have been avoided, then we'd want to find ways to avoid them
in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "But if one took all of the allegations that have been made about
civilian casualties and analyzed each one down to the last nit, you would
find that there have been conscious, repeated lies on this subject since
the beginning of the campaign," he said. "We know that, of certain
knowledge. We also know that there have been some civilian casualties,
and we regret that."</TE>

<HD>Ungainly Bird Serves as U.S. Military Lifeline</HD>
<DH>Logistics: Rugged transports fly supplies and replacements to
carriers in Arabian Sea. They carry 28 people or 10,000 pounds of cargo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FROM A U.S. NAVY FACILITY IN THE PERSIAN GULF REGION--It is an
axiom of war that amateurs talk of tactics but professionals talk of
logistics--the complex science of moving troops, weaponry and other
supplies to the front.</LD>
<LD>   Much of the public discussion of the U.S. military hardware in
Afghanistan will dwell on sophisticated surveillance drones and the
prowess of warplanes like the B-52, the B-1, the F-14 Tomcat and the
F/A-18 Hornet.</LD>
<LD>   But without the 24-hour-a-day assistance of an ungainly, hard-to-fly,
boxcar-resembling Navy airplane called the C-2 Greyhound, the ability of
the U.S. military to keep two carrier battle groups waging war from the
northern Arabian Sea would have been severely undercut.</LD>
<TE>   From locations throughout the region--which the Navy and host nations
prefer not to reveal--the Greyhounds, some of the oldest planes in the
Navy, have kept the carriers and their supporting ships supplied with the
replacement personnel, spare parts and other items necessary for a
sustained assault on Taliban and Al Qaeda strongholds.</TE>
<TE>   Each carrier brings its own Greyhounds, twin-engine turboprops with
80-foot wingspans. Those serving the John C. Stennis carrier battle
group, for example, are from North Island Naval Air Station in Coronado
near San Diego, from a squadron called the Providers.</TE>
<TE>   The name may lack military machismo, but the squadron's cargo
handlers, aviators and mechanics are buoyed by the fact that, without
them, the carriers would soon be hurting and the air war would be
diminished.</TE>
<TE>   "We're essential," said Petty Officer 3rd Class Cody Fuller, 19, of
Rosburg, Ore. "That's a good feeling."</TE>
<TE>   The Greyhounds are in the air every day, shuttling between land bases
and carriers on trips that can last several hours. From the carriers,
helicopters ferry troops and gear to smaller ships, and copters and
fixed-wing aircraft supply the front.</TE>
<TE>   With troops spread over hundreds of miles in Afghanistan, a steady
flow of supplies is essential. The U.S. has been determined not to suffer
the same fate the Soviets did during their Afghan misadventure in the
1980s, when their troops were continually hampered by supply problems.</TE>
<TE>   "We're so spread out, it's like having your right flank in Charleston
and your left flank in New York City," said Lt. Col. Jerome Lynes, a
commander with the Camp Lejeune, N.C.-based 26th Marine Expeditionary
Unit. "Logistics is everything."</TE>
<TE>   Like a lot of equipment in the U.S. military, the Greyhounds have been
targeted for replacement, but so far the Pentagon has found money only
for short-term fixes and modifications. A 50,000-pound airplane landing
on a carrier deck at 500 to 700 feet per second--and then being yanked
suddenly to a stop by an arresting wire--takes a beating.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to give them a lot of tender, loving care to make 'em
fly," said Petty Officer 1st Class David Collins, 30, of Houston.</TE>
<TE>   The Greyhound is notoriously difficult to fly. For one thing, its twin
propellers rotate in the same direction, requiring great effort by pilots
to maintain stability, particularly during a carrier landing, one of the
trickiest, scariest maneuvers in naval aviation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like flying a dump truck with a flat tire," said Lt. Noah
Collins, 26, of Mountain Dale, N.Y., a pilot. "It's a big, heavy airplane
that's a handful to fly. It's unglamorous, but it gets the job done."</TE>
<TE>   The plane's name is Greyhound, but few know it by that term.</TE>
<TE>   To Navy sailors and admirals alike, it is the "cod," an acronym for
carrier-onboard-delivery. The cod has space for 28 passengers, who sit in
darkness in a tight squeeze, or for 10,000 pounds of cargo.</TE>
<TE>   With the plane's limited amount of space, discussions about who gets
on a flight and who gets bumped can be vigorous.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not exactly running Delta Airlines here," said Lt. j.g. Paul
Doyle, 28, of Boston, onshore logistics officer for the Stennis battle
group. "We have priorities, and people have to remember that."</TE>
<TE>   One day, priority was given to two U.S. senators over two professional
football cheerleaders making a morale-boosting trip to one of the
carriers. On another day, a young sailor was bumped to make room for a
newspaper reporter.</TE>
<TE>   If at all possible, mail is given preference. Even in the era of
e-mail, a letter or package from home is still a much valued commodity.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't send cookies from home or a message scented with perfume
over e-mail," said David Collins, the petty officer. "That's the main
reason everybody is happy to see us."</TE>

<HD>Afghan Famine Averted, Most Believe</HD>
<DH>Aid: Surge of food supplies dampens threat of widespread hunger.
But private agencies cite problem areas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A surge of food aid deliveries has averted the threat of widespread
famine in Afghanistan this winter, State Department officials said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   More than 200,000 tons of food has been trucked into the country since
September, the officials said. About 75% of that already has reached
intended destinations.</LD>
<LD>   Some private aid groups emphasized that the threat of hunger remains
in some areas. They also stressed that Afghans now must become
agriculturally self-sufficient, lest they become dependent on outside aid
that will soon diminish.</LD>
<TE>   Even so, aid officials acknowledged that the flow of food into the
country has been a big accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   While "the victory is not complete yet . . . this was an extraordinary
effort," said Larry Thompson, director of advocacy for Refugees
International, a Washington-based humanitarian organization. "It has to
be regarded as a huge success."</TE>
<TE>   When the U.S. bombing campaign began in October, some aid groups were
predicting that more than a million people could starve to death and many
more could face extreme hunger. Afghanistan has suffered through 22 years
of war; large areas have also been punished by several years of drought.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Natsios, administrator for the U.S. Agency for International
Development, said officials had worried that Afghanistan's 25% mortality
rate for children under 5 might double this winter.</TE>
<TE>   The food was shipped into Afghanistan by the World Food Program, a
United Nations agency, and was sent from distribution points within the
country by a variety of nongovernmental organizations. U.S. officials
gave special credit to Afghan aid workers, who were resourceful in
finding ways to deliver food and were stepping up deliveries even as the
war intensified.</TE>
<TE>   Both U.S. officials and aid groups acknowledged that some of the
supplies had been stolen. U.S. military officials were forced to warn
commanders of local militias that their fighters should not interfere
with distribution of the food.</TE>
<TE>   Yet such instances were not a major obstacle to the program, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson, of Refugees International, said three areas in Afghanistan
still have particular problems: the northern region near the border with
Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, where pockets of Taliban resistance remain;
isolated mountainous areas of central and eastern Afghanistan; and the
south, around Kandahar, where recent fighting has taken place.</TE>
<TE>   About two-thirds of the aid was provided by the United States, which
has been the largest supplier of food to Afghanistan for at least the
last decade.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has earmarked $320 million for humanitarian
assistance to Afghanistan, not including reconstruction aid. The money
will go for health programs as well as for food.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said that despite difficult relations with Iran, 65,000 tons
of American food have been delivered to Afghanistan through that country.</TE>
<TE>   But shipments from Uzbekistan have been far short of predictions.
Natsios said only 5,000 to 6,000 tons of food were shipped from that
country.</TE>
<TE>   More than 20,000 radios have been distributed to refugees inside
Afghanistan so that they can hear news about humanitarian assistance and
security conditions in their areas.</TE>
<TE>   Radio is the most popular form of mass communication in Afghanistan,
and U.S. officials said they wanted to be sure that communities could
hear announcements by the British Broadcasting Corp., the Voice of
America and local commercial stations. About 10,000 more radios are still
to be delivered, Natsios said.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: (2 photos) Facing a New Chapter in Education: Among the many
challenges facing Afghanistan's new leadership is rebuilding the
country's shattered education system, which includes ruined schools such
as Kabul's Habibia High School, above, where young people peer out at the
landscape of their war-torn country. The school is expected to reopen in
the spring. After years of warfare, the playground has such unsettling
features as a crater left by a bomb where children play, at right.</CP>

<HD>Switzerland Eases Ban on Knives on Planes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GENEVA
</DL>
<LD>A ban on airline passengers carrying knives on board flights from
Switzerland has been relaxed, aviation officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Geneva airport spokesman Philippe Roy said passengers can take knives
in their carry-on baggage if the blade is shorter than 2.36 inches and
cannot be locked open.</LD>
<LD>   But at Zurich airport, spokesman Joern Wagenbach said security
officers would continue to confiscate any knives they find.</LD>
<TE>   Bans were imposed worldwide in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, when the hijackers who crashed planes into the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon are believed to have used knives or box cutters
to take control of the aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Credit card records showed that Mohamed Atta, the ringleader of the
hijacking teams, bought two knives while he spent several hours in the
Zurich airport on his way from Miami to Madrid last July.</TE>
<TE>   Swiss army pocketknives with multiple short blades and tools are a
popular souvenir, often found on sale in Switzerland's airport shops.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to do the maximum to ensure security in a plane, but you
should avoid total paranoia," said Roy, who said the ban was relaxed
after Swiss authorities consulted the aviation industry.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Goering, a spokesman for the Swiss Federal Office for Civil
Aviation, said: "Every time something happens--like Sept. 11--security
measures are reviewed, and if there is a need for a long-term change,
then that change will be made."</TE>
<TE>   Airports were free to apply stricter standards if they wished, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   A ban remains on longer-bladed knives, which were forbidden long
before the terrorist attacks in the United States, Roy said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our staff confiscated 250 long knives in August," he said. "After the
ban in September, we confiscated more than 5,000 objects--not only knives
but scissors and so on.</TE>
<TE>   "Even now I would still advise anyone who wants to carry even a Swiss
army knife to put it in their hold baggage, just to avoid any security
delays."</TE>

<HD>2nd Daschle Letter Said to Be a Hoax</HD>
<DH>Mail: Threatening missive, postmarked London, contains powder.
Tests for anthrax are negative.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>For the second time in three months, an aide to Senate Majority
Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) has opened a suspicious envelope containing a
"threatening" letter and a powdery substance--but this one is believed to
be a hoax, authorities said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike the first episode in October, when enough deadly anthrax spores
were released to force the closure of a Senate office building,
preliminary field tests have shown that the contents of the latest piece
of mail--which was found Thursday--are not hazardous, according to
federal law enforcement officials and Capitol Hill police. The area
around the majority leader's office in the Capitol was closed briefly
while the tests were conducted.</LD>
<LD>   Daschle called it a "copycat" letter.</LD>
<TE>   "It said this was anthrax, death to America, something to that effect,
and 'Stop the bombing' was the only phrase that was new," Daschle told
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   A law enforcement official said the letter was postmarked London,
England--not New Jersey, like the original anthrax-tainted letter sent to
Daschle's office in the Hart Senate Office Building.</TE>
<TE>   "From every indication, it does not appear to be anything other than a
harmless powder," said U.S. Postal Inspection Service spokesman Dan
Mihalko. "We don't have anything there to indicate that there is any
danger."</TE>
<TE>   "From the standpoint of it being threatening, we will investigate,"
Mihalko said.</TE>
<TE>   Since mid-October, when the first anthrax-laced letter was received,
all mail sent to Capitol Hill has been irradiated as a precaution against
hazardous biological agents. Police also put the mail through a second
security screening procedure that they declined to describe.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Dan Nichols of the Capitol Police said that Daschle's staff
reported finding a "suspicious letter" in the senator's second-floor
suite in the Capitol. The letter, Nichols said, "had a threatening note
inside and a powdery substance inside of the letter."</TE>
<TE>   Police and FBI personnel responded immediately, sealing off corridors
around Daschle's offices and briefly barring entry to the Capitol. The
building, however, was not evacuated. Some tourists were said to be in
the Capitol at the time but well removed from the scene.</TE>
<TE>   The Capitol Police and postal inspectors opened a criminal
investigation into Thursday's incident. Citing that investigation,
Nichols said he could not discuss the letter's contents, postmark or
appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Postal authorities said that the field test conducted on the letter
looks for the anthrax DNA that remains even after the spores are
irradiated.</TE>
<TE>   "So when it doesn't even give us a positive, we're pretty certain that
there was nothing in it ever that was a danger," said Mihalko. The letter
is undergoing more tests as a precautionary measure, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "Sen. Daschle is well aware of the situation," Nichols said at an
impromptu briefing. "He is safe. Everyone's very confident the situation
is well in hand."</TE>
<TE>   The incident sent jitters through a congressional staff already on
edge since Capitol Hill became the scene of a major biological attack
through the mails.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 15, a Daschle aide working in another suite--in the Hart
Senate Office Building, across Constitution Avenue from the
Capitol--opened an anthrax-tainted letter. More than two dozen Senate
aides and police officers were exposed to the bacteria at the time,
though none has become sick.</TE>
<TE>   The Hart building has been closed since Oct. 17 as part of a complex,
months-long cleanup effort. After several delays, Senate leaders now say
they hope to reopen the building before Congress reconvenes later this
month. Fifty senators have offices in the Hart building.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities also said Thursday that, even though they have spent
months investigating the source of the initial anthrax letters, they are
not close to identifying and arresting who sent them.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a lot of theories and a lot of trails we've looked at, but
nothing has panned out," said one federal law enforcement official.</TE>

<HD>S. Asian Conflict Shadows Summit</HD>
<DH>Nepal: Regional leaders gather for meeting that begins today as
India continues to demand that Pakistan turn over terrorist suspects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KATMANDU, Nepal
</DL>
<LD>As regional leaders gathered here to talk about getting along
better, India kept the heat on rival Pakistan by insisting again that
Islamabad hand over at least 20 alleged terrorists and criminals for
trial.</LD>
<LD>   The two nuclear powers continued to mass forces along their border
Thursday in a crisis that flared when militants attacked India's
Parliament on Dec. 13, and Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh offered
little hope of a diplomatic breakthrough during a summit of South Asian
leaders here.</LD>
<LD>   By repeating that Pakistan must extradite the men before India puts
any evidence in front of a judge, Singh stirred the embers of a conflict
that threatens to erupt into all-out war.</LD>
<TE>   "They include proven terrorists, proven criminals, narcotics dealers,"
Singh told reporters in Katmandu, the Nepalese capital. "The entire
repertoire of crimes against humanity that you can think of is what these
20 have done.</TE>
<TE>   "Why should they find shelter in Pakistan? And why should Pakistan be
interested in providing them shelter? I'm simply unable to understand."</TE>
<TE>   Although the two neighbors don't have an extradition treaty, Pakistani
Foreign Minister Abdus Sattar has left open the possibility of turning
over suspects for trial if an Indian court rules that there is sufficient
evidence against them.</TE>
<TE>   But Singh insisted Thursday that New Delhi already has provided enough
proof to Pakistani authorities over the past eight years and that the
demand from Islamabad for more is "completely unacceptable."</TE>
<TE>   Singh said he understands that it "will take a little time" for
Pakistan to deal with a terrorism problem that has been 20 years in the
making. But his charge that Pakistan is sheltering people guilty of
crimes against humanity was hardly the more conciliatory tone that
Washington has been pressing for in its diplomatic effort to avert a war.</TE>
<TE>   "India is not interested in escalating anything," Singh said. "It is
our hope that Pakistan will work seriously toward what they themselves
have announced, that it is their intent to act against terrorism. That
must be in deeds and not simply in words."</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf says he is willing to meet
with Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee during the weekend summit
of seven regional leaders from the South Asian Assn. for Regional
Cooperation. It begins today.</TE>
<TE>   But Indian officials have said repeatedly that neither Musharraf and
Vajpayee nor their foreign ministers are likely to hold peace talks
during the Nepal summit.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not here to conduct India-Pakistan relations," Singh said.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with Nepal's national news service, Musharraf called
the exclusion of bilateral issues from the regional cooperation summit "a
serious handicap which has crippled the association."</TE>
<TE>   Before leaving for Nepal on Thursday afternoon, Vajpayee sounded a
more moderate tone than in recent days. "War is not a must," he said.
"Efforts are being made to avoid war through diplomatic channels. If that
succeeds, there will be no need to opt for other alternatives."</TE>
<TE>   But Vajpayee's rhetoric has swung from belligerent to conciliatory and
back again several times since five gunmen attacked the Parliament
buildings last month, killing themselves and nine other people. India has
blamed the attack on Kashmiri separatists based in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Vajpayee warned that India will "use every weapon in
self-defense, and if the enemy suffers in the bargain, we shall not be
responsible for it." It was a not-so-subtle reference to India's nuclear
arsenal, which it has pledged not to use first. Pakistan has yet to state
a "no first use" nuclear policy.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf has won praise in Washington for ordering the arrest of
dozens of extremists, including the leaders of the two groups India has
accused of carrying out the Dec. 13 attack.</TE>
<TE>   India complains that the arrests are largely a public relations ploy
because the leaders of Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba were arrested
for allegedly making inflammatory speeches, not for carrying out acts of
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The "wanted list" of 20 names that India's government first handed to
Pakistan on Monday includes Jaish leader Maulana Masood Azhar and six
people suspected of involvement in a series of 1993 bomb attacks in
Bombay.</TE>
<TE>   On March 12, 1993, terrorist bombs killed 257 people in Bombay,
India's financial and entertainment capital. Eleven days after the
attack, India formally asked Pakistan to arrest six suspects who New
Delhi said had escaped to the Pakistani port city of Karachi.</TE>
<TE>   On March 30, 1993, India sent 18 pages of information on the suspects
to the Pakistani government, including evidence of their role in the
terrorist attacks, Singh said.</TE>
<TE>   In June 1994, India officially requested the extradition or
deportation from Pakistan of 24 Indian citizens accused of carrying out
the Bombay blasts, but New Delhi is still waiting to bring them to
justice.</TE>
<TE>   Five other men on the wanted list are suspected of hijacking an Indian
Airlines flight from Katmandu to Kandahar, Afghanistan, in December 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The passengers and aircraft were freed after eight days when India
agreed to release prisoners including Azhar, the Jaish-e-Mohammed leader.
Later reports claimed he had links to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda
terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   Last April 24, India's government asked Pakistan to arrest and
extradite the suspected hijackers and their accomplices, and New Delhi
provided copies of affidavits by the airliner's captain and two
passengers identifying the suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Almost four months earlier, Islamabad had insisted that the hijackers
weren't in Pakistan and called India's claims that they were "baseless
and provocative."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Singh called on Musharraf to eliminate what he called the
gap "between what Pakistan says it would do and what it does actually
do."</TE>
<TE>   "I repeat that the steps taken against Lashkar-e-Taiba and
Jaish-e-Mohammed are welcome steps in the right direction," he said. "But
they need to be pursued, and they need to act much more in that
direction, because the dimensions of the problem are immense."</TE>

<HD>Pakistan's New War on Extremism</HD>
<DH>Asia: The extent of its crackdown on Islamic fundamentalism after
an attack in India has surprised even Western political analysts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>Even before Pakistan cut its ties to the Taliban and joined the
coalition against terrorism, President Pervez Musharraf had laid plans to
crack down on religious extremism and end the cozy relationship between
his generals and the mullahs, senior aides and Western diplomats said.</LD>
<LD>   In a country founded as an Islamic republic, it was a risky exercise.
But with Pakistan carrying a $38-billion external debt, no foreign
investment in sight and the rule of law a shambles, Musharraf was
convinced that he had to move his nation toward the religious moderation
its founding father, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, had advocated in 1947, the
president's senior aides said.</LD>
<LD>   "We have undermined Islam," Musharraf, a general who seized power in a
1999 coup, said last week--a comment virtually no other leader of a
Muslim country would dare make. He went on to observe that the world had
come to associate Islam "with illiteracy, backwardness, intolerance,
obscurantism and militancy."</LD>
<TE>   The sweeping extent of his crackdown after a suicide attack on India's
Parliament, which New Delhi has blamed on Kashmiri separatists based in
Pakistan, surprised even Western political analysts. The Dec. 13 attack
has led to serious military tensions in bitterly disputed Kashmir between
the two nuclear-armed nations and frequent cross-border shelling.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf travels to Nepal today for a South Asian summit that Indian
Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee also will attend. No meeting is
scheduled between the two leaders to discuss a diplomatic solution in
Kashmir, but Western political analysts say Musharraf has gone a long way
to meet India's demands that Pakistan put anti-Indian Kashmiri militants
out of business.</TE>
<TE>   The three major Pakistan-based Kashmiri militant groups have been
ordered to close their offices. They are Harkat Moujahedeen, which was
active in Afghanistan and had ties to Osama bin Laden, and the two groups
India accuses of being behind the attack on its Parliament,
Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed.</TE>
<TE>   Their financial assets have been frozen and their leaders arrested,
along with more than 100 of their supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Even before Sept. 11, Musharraf was known to deem the Taliban a
liability to Pakistan. But he was reluctant to act because of the
strength of religious extremists, who have never won more than a handful
of seats in parliament but represent a vocal, influential minority.</TE>
<TE>   The post-Sept. 11 formation of the international coalition against
terrorism gave him the opportunity to make dramatic policy changes, an
advisor said.</TE>
<TE>Brother of Minister Directing Effort Slain</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan's crackdown--on everything from hate speeches in the mosques
to overt terrorism carried out by militants with both external and
internal grievances--is being directed by Interior Minister Moinuddin
Haider. The minister's brother was assassinated in the Pakistani port
city of Karachi last month in what police officials believe was a signal
from militants that the government was playing with fire.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf has made top-level changes in the Inter-Services
Intelligence agency, or ISI, which operated as a state within a state and
was often sympathetic to militants.</TE>
<TE>   He has also told the intelligence agency to stop supporting Islamic
militant groups and decided to cut off support for nonindigenous groups
in Kashmir, aides said.</TE>
<TE>   Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh said Thursday that he had "taken
note" of a U.S. newspaper report in which unidentified Pakistani
officials claimed that Musharraf was shutting down the branch of the ISI
that handles clandestine support for Kashmiri separatists.</TE>
<TE>   Singh said he didn't expect a formal announcement of such a stunning
shift in policy because that would be tantamount to admitting that India
has been right all along when it has accused Pakistan's military
intelligence of training, arming and infiltrating guerrillas into
Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   But a senior Indian intelligence official dismissed outright the
report of Pakistan's radical change of heart and said he saw no evidence
to support the claim.</TE>
<TE>   "It is ludicrous," the official said Thursday in New Delhi, speaking
on condition of anonymity because of the nature of his work. "There is
nothing at all to suggest that it has happened as there is no
demonstrable impact in the levels of violence in Kashmir."</TE>
<TE>   India's spy agency estimates that the ISI employs about 25,000 people,
of which about 20,000 are in two wings that deal with Kashmir and
Afghanistan, and Nepal and northeastern India.</TE>
<TE>   The first division, known as "joint intelligence north" may be renamed
or merged with the second, called "joint intelligence miscellaneous,"
which New Delhi accuses of fomenting unrest in Nepal and India's
northeast, the intelligence source said.</TE>
<TE>   But shutting down "joint intelligence north" would force a massive
restructuring of Pakistan's military intelligence and risk provoking
opposition from hard-liners in the spy agency, the Indian official said.</TE>
<TE>Reform of Madrasas Is on President's Agenda</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Musharraf has pushed through on several fronts of the
crackdown. He has banned the inflammatory speeches mullahs used to blast
through loudspeakers into the streets, as well as religious
demonstrations.</TE>
<TE>   When he returns from Nepal, Musharraf plans a major speech on reform
of the madrasas, seminaries that foster fundamentalism by teaching young,
poor students from the countryside the narrowest interpretation of Islam.
Many of the mullahs who operate the madrasas are unworldly and poorly
educated--except in their knowledge of the Koran.</TE>
<TE>   In the Pakistani city of Peshawar, Maulana Jalic Jan, a mullah who
runs a madrasa, was asked about the effects of the crackdown.</TE>
<TE>   "They're making it more difficult, no doubt about that," he said
finally after pondering the question. "But this is an Islamic country,
and the people won't let the government go too far."</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf, who accuses the militants of being poised "to create
dissensions and damage the country," appears successful so far in his
steps to deflate their power. The hate-filled rhetoric has subsided, and
the demonstrations have dwindled. In Karachi, mullahs predicted that they
could turn a million people out for a pro-Taliban, anti-American
demonstration in October. They got about one-tenth that number.</TE>
<TE>   Still, political observers wonder how far and how fast Musharraf can
go without upsetting the balance of this conservative society. To
advocate secularism to the detriment of sectarianism might be to step
over the line, Pakistani political analysts say. But that is clearly the
direction Musharraf is taking Pakistan.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Envoy Returns to Mideast During Lull</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>With Mideast violence at its lowest level in 15 months, U.S. envoy
Anthony C. Zinni returned Thursday hoping to prod Israelis and
Palestinians into moving ahead with a truce plan both sides accepted in
principle last year.</LD>
<LD>   Israel pulled back tanks and troops Thursday from half a dozen
Palestinian towns in the West Bank, a move long sought by Palestinians
who have had their movements sharply curtailed.</LD>
<LD>   But Israeli troops also seized five suspected militants in Palestinian
areas, and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's government again demanded that
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat make more arrests.</LD>
<TE>   The sharp decline in fighting over the past three weeks has raised the
possibility that a cease-fire could finally take hold, ending the
bloodletting that has claimed over 1,000 lives since September 2000. But
Zinni, whose previous mission collapsed in mid-December amid a surge in
violence, faces a complicated task.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon demands a week of complete calm before going ahead with the
cease-fire plan drafted in June by CIA chief George J. Tenet. No Israeli
has been killed by a Palestinian in three weeks, but Israel says there
are daily incidents that must stop entirely.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian leadership says it has done its part to reduce
violence and wants a firm timetable for implementation of the truce.</TE>
<TE>   "I reconfirm in front of you our full commitment to the peace process
and the cease-fire decision," Arafat told reporters at his West Bank
headquarters in Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's military actions Thursday appeared to send a double-edged
message that it was willing to ease the tough restrictions imposed on the
Palestinians but that it was also demanding further crackdowns against
suspected Palestinian militants.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli tanks and troops withdrew from six West Bank towns, although
an armored personnel carrier remained in a northern neighborhood of

<LD>Mexican police said Thursday that they have arrested four
brothers--two Mexicans and two U.S. citizens--on a U.S. extradition
warrant that charges them with drug trafficking and criminal association.</LD>
<LD>   Mexicans Hernaldo Beltran Perea and Raul Beltran Perea, and U.S.
residents Jesus Manuel Beltran and Rodolfo Beltran were arrested as a
result of a U.S.-Mexican investigation, the attorney general's office
said in a statement.</LD>
<LD>   The four--and two others arrested in the United States--allegedly
belong to a clan that shipped an estimated 100 to 220 pounds of cocaine
over the border each week.</LD>
<TE>   The ring allegedly operated in the border city of Ciudad Juarez, where
the arrests were made this week.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1991, the ring allegedly shipped marijuana and cocaine across
the border to Texas, Kansas and California, using hired drivers.</TE>

<HD>China's Buried Problems Exploded in 2001</HD>
<DH>Society: A handful of bombings by individuals with personal
grievances contrasts with the nation's high-profile achievements.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHING-CHING NI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHANGHAI
</DL>
<LD>The year 2001 ended with the Chinese leadership boasting a banner
year of achievements: gaining membership in the World Trade Organization,
winning the right to host the 2008 Olympics, qualifying for the World Cup
soccer finals, hosting an Asia-Pacific summit.</LD>
<LD>   But the year also wrapped up with a series of events illustrating the
reasons for China's fears about social instability.</LD>
<LD>   In mid-December, a blast at a McDonald's restaurant in the northern
city of Xian killed two people and injured at least 30 others. Then, a
homemade bomb blew up in the parking lot of a French-owned supermarket in
the coastal city of Qingdao. Car windows were shattered, but no one was
hurt.</LD>
<TE>   Also in mid-December, more than 20 near-simultaneous explosions jolted
the southern cities of Zhanjiang and Jiangmen in Guangdong province
across from Hong Kong. The blasts killed five people and injured seven
more.</TE>
<TE>   The government attributed most of the crimes to personal grudges. In
Zhanjiang, Lin Guojian, who was among the five who died, was said to have
set off the bombs using electronic pagers to avenge his brother-in-law
and other business partners.</TE>
<TE>   Officials also blamed an individual for explosions in March in the
northern city of Shijiazhuang. Jin Ruchao was found guilty of blowing up
four buildings and killing 108 people in an attempt to kill his ex-wife
and relatives. He was executed in April.</TE>
<TE>   Beneath the veneer of progress and prosperity, China is a society
struggling under the weight of unprecedented social change. The violence
is a symptom of rising social tensions and a lack of proper avenues to
address grievances, foreign and Chinese analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "Unrest is increasing, and it's going to get worse," said Dan Lynch, a
China specialist at USC.</TE>
<TE>   This year is a particularly sensitive time as Beijing prepares to
shuffle its top leadership. Both President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu
Rongji are expected to step down. A smooth transfer of power depends on
maintaining stability.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Sept. 11 attacks on America and the subsequent war on
terrorism, China has tried to draw attention to its own fight against
Muslim separatists in the far western region of Xinjiang.</TE>
<TE>   But an economy in flux is bringing potentially explosive problems much
closer to its population centers. China has weathered the global economic
slump better than most of its Asian neighbors, but it cannot escape the
effects, which already are hurting the country's exports.</TE>
<TE>   The World Bank says China needs to create between 8 million and 9
million jobs a year for the next decade, mostly to cope with growing
numbers of laid-off workers from restructured state-owned enterprises.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, there are challenges brought on by WTO membership, which
means greater competition and fewer jobs both in cities and the
countryside.</TE>
<TE>   But China was able to generate only about 6 million jobs a year, even
with the economy growing recently at an average annual rate of about 8%.
Some economists argue that growth figure has been inflated by the
government by at least two percentage points. And if the economy worsens
next year, it would only mean more desperation for the rising number of
unemployed workers.</TE>
<TE>   "Granted, some people are going to do better than others, but the
issue is whether people perceive the rules of the game to be fair," Lynch
said.</TE>
<TE>   The answer often is no. Those without connections cannot do well.
Those with grievances have no place to go.</TE>
<TE>   "When these people feel mistreated, they tend to take matters into
their own hands or go to extreme measures," said Liu Hua, an expert on
law at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   This growing sense of frustration among people and insecurity about
their lives have also led to a surge in mental health cases. A study by
Beijing University says that more than 200,000 people turn to suicide
every year to end their troubles, some of them dragging innocent
bystanders along with them.</TE>
<TE>   The scale and frequency of these incidents suggest that the problem is
much more than just personal.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's headlines included deadly blasts at illegal coal mines,
patients' families killing doctors to resolve malpractice disputes and
lethal explosions at fireworks factories, all pointing to the failure of
the system to protect its citizens and enforce the law.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 30, another series of explosions flattened a fireworks factory
in the same county in Jiangxi province where a blast last March killed 42
people, most of them children. This latest incident could prove another
embarrassment for Beijing. Zhu offered an apology on national TV last
year after the explosion at a school, promising to step up enforcement of
public safety.</TE>

<HD>Ethnic Clashes in Congo Leave Dozens Dead, Rebel Leader Says</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>KAMPALA, Uganda
</DL>
<LD>Dozens of people were killed and hundreds of residences were razed
in ethnic clashes in northeastern Congo in the last week, a rebel leader
said.</LD>
<LD>   "By last week at least 500 huts were burned down and many people were
killed in clashes around Nyoka between the Lendu and Alur tribes," said
Jean-Pierre Bemba, leader of the Ugandan-backed Congolese Liberation
Movement, or MLC.</LD>
<LD>   Bemba, speaking by telephone from his base in Gbadolite in northern
Congo, did not have exact numbers but said news reports that 50 people
have died in the last five days were realistic.</LD>
<TE>   The MLC withdrew from the Ituri region after friction with its former
rebel ally, the Rally for Congolese Democracy-Kisangani/Liberation
Movement, a group also backed by Uganda that now controls the area.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of people have been killed in fighting between ethnic groups
in the Ituri region during the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   The ethnic fighting has added another layer of conflict in Congo's
war, which began in 1998 when rebels backed by Uganda and Rwanda sought
to oust President Laurent Kabila, whom the two nations accused of
sheltering militias that threatened regional security. Kabila was
assassinated in January 2001.</TE>

<HD>Argentina's New Cabinet Is Sworn In</HD>
<DH>Government: The nation reportedly fails to make a $28-million debt
payment to Italy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES
</DL>
<LD>Argentina's new president, Eduardo Duhalde, unveiled his Cabinet on
Thursday amid expectations of an imminent devaluation of the currency and
reports that the country formally defaulted on a portion of its mountain
of public debt.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer told reporters
that President Bush, vacationing at his Texas ranch, had sent Duhalde a
congratulatory letter and planned to telephone him as well.</LD>
<LD>   But Treasury Department officials continued to rule out any direct
U.S. aid, saying new support would come from the International Monetary
Fund and other multilateral lending agencies and would be offered only
after the new government has developed a credible economic plan.</LD>
<TE>   The Reuters news agency reported that Argentina failed to make a
$28-million payment on an Italian bond as new Cabinet Secretary Jorge
Capitanich confirmed that virtually bankrupt Argentina was unable to meet
its obligations. A default by Argentina on its full $132-billion public
debt would be the nation's biggest.</TE>
<TE>   Duhalde, who swore in his Cabinet a day after taking office as the
fifth president in two weeks, is expected to outline part, if not all, of
his economic plan today. He made no comment regarding his plans Thursday.
He has vowed to chart a new economic course that is likely to include
ending a decade-old policy that anchors the peso on a one-to-one basis to
the U.S. dollar and allowing a devaluation of the peso.</TE>
<TE>   Cabinet members came mostly from the ranks of Duhalde's Peronist
party. Economy Minister Jorge Remes Lenicov is a longtime Duhalde
confidant from the president's days as governor of Buenos Aires province.
Carlos Ruckhauf, the province's most recent governor, was named foreign
minister.</TE>
<TE>   To calm Argentines enraged by a partial freeze that limits money
withdrawals to $1,000 a month, Duhalde's team reportedly will announce a
180-day timetable for removing the measure. Duhalde said Tuesday that
Argentines will eventually be able to withdraw their funds in the
currency in which the deposits were made.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Leader's Kin Repay Millions to Nigeria</HD>
<DH>Africa: The sum is a small fraction of the $3 billion said to have
been stolen during the rule of late dictator Sani Abacha.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>LAGOS, Nigeria
</DL>
<LD>The family of late dictator Sani Abacha has been forced to pay back
nearly $148 million to Nigeria, an official statement said Thursday, in
what appeared to be the largest recovery of stolen funds in the country's
history.</LD>
<LD>   But the sum is minuscule compared with what is still missing.
President Olusegun Obasanjo's government estimates that nearly $3 billion
was salted away from oil-producing Nigeria by Abacha and his associates
during his 4 1/2-year ironfisted rule.</LD>
<LD>   Obasanjo made recovery of stolen funds a priority after he took over
in 1999, ending 15 years of corrupt military rule.</LD>
<TE>   Nigeria's efforts to recover money it accused Abacha of stealing have
forced the world's major financial centers to examine how illicit funds
deposited in their banks can be repatriated to benefit the countries of
the crooked politicians who put them there.</TE>
<TE>   "The family of the late head of state, Gen. Sani Abacha, two weeks ago
paid back to the federal government" the sum of $147.5 million,
presidential spokesman Tunji Oseni said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The money came from a British High Court judgment last year ordering
Mecosta Securities, owned by the Abacha family, to repay 300 million
German marks, or about $138 million, defrauded from the government in a
debt buyback scheme, the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   The amount includes $8.7 million in interest.</TE>
<TE>   Obasanjo's office said the payment was made from a frozen Abacha
family bank account in Luxembourg, where two of Abacha's sons are accused
of having stashed $630 million at a subsidiary of a German bank in the
name of an offshore company.</TE>
<TE>   Britain's Financial Services Authority had found that 23 London banks
had handled $1.3 billion on behalf of Abacha's family and friends.</TE>
<TE>   Swiss authorities have frozen $550 million in accounts allegedly
belonging to Abacha; his eldest surviving son, Mohammed; widow Mariam;
brother Abdulkadir; and entourage. Liechtenstein has frozen $200 million.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Switzerland's Federal Banking Commission took the unusual
step of publicly naming and shaming banks for taking deposits tied to
Abacha's family.</TE>

<HD>Australia Struggles to Contain 2 Massive Fires Around Sydney</HD>
<DH>Blazes: Authorities warn that more hot weather is expected, adding
to the threat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>SYDNEY, Australia
</DL>
<LD>Weary Australian firefighters faced a "scary" day today as two
massive bush fires raged around Sydney, and forecasters predicted more of
the searing heat that sparked scores of fires Dec. 25.</LD>
<LD>   About 10,000 firefighters are battling more than 100 blazes across New
South Wales state, many set by arsonists, on fronts totaling 1,250 miles.
The fires have destroyed 160 homes, causing an estimated $36 million in
damage.</LD>
<LD>   Fire official John Winter told Australian television that the two
giant fires licking the perimeter of Sydney--one burning along the Blue
Mountains west of the city and another on its south coast--posed the
greatest threats.</LD>
<TE>   "It's certainly going to be scary as the fire works its way up" the
mountains, Winter said.</TE>
<TE>   People in the small south coast resort town of Bendalong spent
Thursday night on the beach as firefighters battled a huge blaze that a
day earlier swept through another town to the north.</TE>
<TE>   This morning, Bendalong was covered by a blanket of smoke. The town's
only road remained cut off as firefighters waited to see which way the
blaze would move once winds picked up.</TE>
<TE>   Scattered along the beach were mattresses, chairs, tables and a baby's
bed where people had spent the night.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters warned that milder weather would not bring any relief.</TE>
<TE>   "The moderate conditions will play havoc with fire strategy because
the fires are so erratic now," Winter said.</TE>
<TE>   To make matters worse, more hot weather was on its way. "It's starting
to get serious again from Sunday and into Monday," said Kevin O'Loughlin,
a New South Wales weather bureau official.</TE>
<TE>   There have been no deaths from the fires. Police have arrested 21
arson suspects, one as young as 9.</TE>
<TE>   Residents in Sydney's Blue Mountains spent a sleepless Thursday night
as 600 exhausted firefighters battled to save homes from the massive
fire.</TE>
<TE>   Stretching 37 miles from the mountains to the coast, the fire has
burned out of control in the Burragorang valley at the foot of the
mountains since Christmas Day.</TE>
<TE>   Aided by a helicopter dropping nearly 2,000 gallons of water at a
time, firefighters worked through the night forcing back flames street by
street around the small mountain town of Woodford.</TE>

<LD>A judge on Zimbabwe's second-highest court is quitting the bench,
court officials said Thursday, part of a wave of resignations by
independent-minded members of the judiciary.</LD>

<LD>   The resignation of High Court Judge David Bartlett, 49, will go into
effect by late March. He gave no reasons for his decision to resign.</LD>
<TE>   At least three other senior judges have quit in the last year, and a
fifth recently retired. All were considered independent-minded jurists
who had been under pressure from the government and ruling party
militants.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Justice Anthony Gubbay chose to retire early last summer after
the government warned him and other judges that they would not be
protected from ruling party militants, who stormed the Supreme Court in
December 2000, shouting, "Kill the judges!"</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court under Gubbay had declared the government-sanctioned
seizure of white-owned farms illegal. The court was accused by militants
of bias in favor of white landowners.</TE>
<TE>   The departure of Bartlett, the fourth white judge to quit in the last
two years, will leave two whites among about 25 judges in the nation's
High Court, the second-highest judicial body. There are about 50,000
whites in Zimbabwe, a country of 13 million people.</TE>

<LD>The Division of Wildlife Resources has stopped all helicopter
animal captures after a crash last week that killed three men.</LD>
<LD>   The decision comes after a Dec. 27 accident in which the helicopter,
being used to relocate moose, clipped a power line and crashed into a
reservoir in Parleys Canyon about 10 miles outside of Salt Lake City. A
review of procedures is expected to begin this month.</LD>
<LD>   In the airlifts, moose are netted and tied, flown to corrals and then
trucked to other areas.</LD>
<TE>   Heavy snow this winter has forced moose into lower elevations. The
large animals have caused several traffic accidents.</TE>

<HD>Judge Rules Ex-Klansman Fit for Trial in 1963 Deaths</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Birmingham judge reversed himself Thursday and ruled that former
Ku Klux Klansman Bobby Frank Cherry is mentally competent to stand trial
on murder charges in the 1963 church bombing that killed four black
girls.</LD>
<LD>   The decision stunned many and set the stage for the second emotional
trial of an ex-Klansman in the last year. In May, a Birmingham jury took
2 1/2 hours to convict Thomas E. Blanton Jr. for his role in the bombing,
considered one of the most coldblooded crimes of the civil rights era.</LD>
<LD>   There were no reasons provided in the two-sentence ruling issued by
Circuit Judge James Garrett, who had initially deemed Cherry, 72, unfit
for trial because he appeared to have suffered severe memory loss.</LD>
<TE>   But at a hearing in December, prosecutors called several mental health
experts who testified Cherry was faking a bad memory to avoid
prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   The judge scheduled a hearing for Jan. 18 to set a trial date, which
federal prosecutor Robert Posey said he expects to be in April.</TE>
<TE>   John Robbins, the lawyer who represented Blanton, said the Cherry case
is much weaker.</TE>
<TE>   "In Blanton's trial, you had the tapes," Robbins said, referring to
37-year-old reel-to-reel recordings of incriminating conversations made
by the FBI. "But I looked at the evidence for the Cherry case and there
are no tapes. The prosecution is going to have to rely on witnesses to
remember what Cherry told them 40 years ago. That won't be easy."</TE>
<TE>   Posey said "over half the evidence" will be new.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to use those tapes. That's as specific as I'm allowed
to get," said Posey, the lead prosecutor on the case.</TE>
<TE>   Alpha Robertson, the 82-year-old mother of Carole Robertson, one of
the girls killed, was in her Birmingham living room when she learned
Cherry was headed to trial.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, we've been waiting for this," Robertson said. "But I better not
say anything more."</TE>
<TE>   Cherry's attorneys did not return calls.</TE>
<TE>   The case goes back to Sunday morning, Sept. 15, 1963, when four girls
in white dresses were getting ready for Sunday services at the 16th
Street Baptist Church. Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia Wesley and Carole
Robertson, all 14, and Denise McNair, 11, were primping in a basement
lounge when 10 sticks of dynamite exploded outside and brought part of
the brick and concrete church down on top of them.</TE>
<TE>   Within days, FBI agents had identified four suspects, all known
segregationists and members of the Ku Klux Klan: Robert E. "Dynamite Bob"
Chambliss, Herman Frank Cash, Cherry and Blanton.</TE>
<TE>   Despite evidence gathered through informants and wiretaps on the men's
phones, then-FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover called the agents off. An
Alabama jury--likely all white men--would never convict the Klansmen,
Hoover said.</TE>
<TE>   The decision provoked outrage at a time when the civil rights movement
was cresting in the Deep South and Birmingham was at its turbulent
center. The 16th Street Baptist Church was known as a gathering spot for
activists, who often had to dodge fire hoses and police dogs to get
there.</TE>
<TE>   The bombing case remained inactive for years, but in 1977 Chambliss,
considered the mastermind, was convicted of murder. He died in prison
eight years later.</TE>
<TE>   Cash died in 1994. In 1993, the head of the FBI's Birmingham office
reopened the case. After four years, the FBI began to close in on Cherry,
a retired truck driver and carpet cleaner living in Mabank, Texas, and
Blanton, a clerk at a Birmingham-area Wal-Mart.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Blanton, then 62, went on trial. The key evidence against
him was the tapes, in which Blanton never said he bombed the church but
bragged to a friend, "I like to go shooting, I like to go fishing, I like
to go bombing."</TE>
<TE>   Blanton's lawyers fought to keep the tapes out of the trial and are
appealing the verdict. He was sentenced to life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Cherry was expected to stand trial with Blanton but was dropped from
the case after the judge ruled he was mentally incompetent. Cherry told
his lawyers he couldn't even remember the names of his ex-wives.</TE>
<TE>   He was committed to a state mental hospital and evaluated for 71 days,
at the insistence of prosecutors. Several psychologists who evaluated him
testified he didn't have serious memory problems and was affected by
taking too much of an anti-anxiety drug. He was intentionally selecting
the wrong answers on memory tests, one expert said.</TE>
<TE>   Birmingham Mayor Bernard Kincaid issued a short statement Thursday
that spoke to the sense of closure for which many yearn.</TE>
<TE>   "It is my hope that the citizens of Birmingham will accept the verdict
which ultimately will be returned, and in doing so will close forever
this dark chapter in our history."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Vermont's Supreme Court has rejected a challenge to the civil union
law granting gay couples many of the rights and benefits of marriage.</LD>
<LD>   In a Dec. 26 order signed by all five justices, the court turned aside
claims brought by taxpayers, legislators and town clerks.</LD>
<LD>   They had made two main claims: One asserted that the civil union law
is invalid because 14 House members who supported it bet on the outcome
of a preliminary House vote. In the other, town clerks argued that the
law is unconstitutional because it forces them to violate their religious
beliefs that homosexuality is wrong by issuing civil union licenses to
couples.</LD>

<HD>Bush to Stump for Economic Recovery Plan</HD>
<DH>Politics: The president will make several stops, including one in
Ontario, Calif., to promote a bill stalled in the Senate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas
</DL>
<LD>After more than a week of virtual seclusion at his ranch, President
Bush is preparing a burst of high-profile appearances across the country
to display his determination to revive the U.S. economy.</LD>
<LD>   The president's bicoastal itinerary suggests he is ready to begin
expending some of the political capital he has gained as a wartime
commander to promote his domestic priorities, many of which are opposed
by Democrats.</LD>
<LD>   Above all, Bush intends to apply new and very public pressure on the
Democrat-controlled Senate to enact his moribund economic stimulus
measure, which the White House has renamed the "economic security bill."</LD>
<TE>   Bush aides indicated that the president will take a more active role
in the coming debate--starting at a town hall meeting in Ontario, Calif.,
on Saturday--than he did late last year when the measure stalled in the
Senate after its approval by the Republican-controlled House.</TE>
<TE>   "We're . . . fighting a recession here at home, and that's right at
the top of the agenda," Deputy Press Secretary Scott McClellan said
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also will focus on his economic bill--a mix of large tax breaks
for business, an accelerated cut in income tax rates and expanded
benefits for the unemployed--in his weekly Saturday radio address, aides
said. To further drum up public support, Bush's top economic advisors
will make the rounds on the Sunday TV talk shows.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democrats blocked the bill, charging it was too skewed toward
business and failed to adequately address health care needs for the
unemployed.</TE>
<TE>   For Bush, looming over the dispute is the political fate of his
father, who won the Persian Gulf War but lost his presidential reelection
bid largely because of voter dissatisfaction with his handling of the
economy.</TE>
<TE>Popularity Remains Strong After Attacks</TE>
<TE>   Although Bush's high job approval ratings--earned for his response to
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks--remain undiminished, his bid to escalate
pressure on Senate Democrats raises the question of whether he can
transfer that popularity to his domestic agenda.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the Democrats have resisted his limited efforts to prod them
into action on his economic plan, as well as on controversial proposals
to increase federal funding for faith-based charitable groups and to open
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to energy exploration. And the more
Bush seeks to spotlight such issues, the more he risks a tumble in the
polls.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to touting his economic bill in the coming days, Bush
plans to discuss education, a topic he has more to crow about. Education
reform was one of his domestic priorities, and shortly before Christmas,
Congress gave final approval to a measure designed to improve public
schools. Bush intends to sign the bill next week amid considerable
fanfare.</TE>
<TE>   In light of the Sept. 11 attacks and the still-unsolved anthrax
outbreaks, he also plans to embrace a new domestic initiative: building
up the nation's public health infrastructure to better respond to
bioterrorism threats.</TE>
<TE>Bush Will Go to Austin for Portrait Unveiling</TE>
<TE>   Today, in his first trip out of Crawford since arriving Dec. 26, Bush
returns to the state capital in Austin, Texas, where he served as
governor from 1995 until his election to the White House. A portrait of
Bush will be unveiled, joining those of other former governors displayed
at the statehouse.</TE>
<TE>   After his stop in Ontario, Bush is to fly to Portland, Ore., where he
will tour a job center and speak at a high school. Next week, he plans to
go to Ohio, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   The president's only excursion off the ranch was a brief visit to the
Coffee Station, a diner at the center of this crossroads hamlet, for a
cheeseburger lunch on New Year's Eve day. Bush has fished and spent hours
clearing brush on his 1,600-acre Prairie Chapel Ranch. But he has
continued to do some work, such as holding daily national security
briefings and preparing for his first State of the Union speech.</TE>
<TE>   In a sign of a White House gearing up for the battles ahead, two of
the president's closest advisors have joined him in Crawford in recent
days: White House Counselor Karen Hughes and chief political strategist
Karl Rove.</TE>
<TE>   National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice arrived at the ranch
Wednesday, replacing an aide who was here earlier during Bush's stay.</TE>

<HD>Snow, Ice Cover the South, but Novelty Wears Thin</HD>
<DH>Weather: The second day of a major storm strands fliers and
motorists. National Guard is called to help in South Carolina.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDITH STANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA
</DL>
<LD>A treacherous winter storm laid a thick blanket of snow and ice
across the South on Thursday, downing power lines, causing car accidents
and prompting South Carolina's governor to call up the National Guard to
help stranded drivers.</LD>
<LD>   The second day of the storm dumped as much as a foot of snow in places
that go years without seeing a flurry. The storm was blamed for at least
nine deaths.</LD>
<LD>   South Carolina reported more than 900 storm-related car accidents.
National Guard troops, equipped with four-wheel-drive trucks and military
Humvees, were sent to rescue motorists stuck on impassable roads. About
30,000 households in the state lost power after utility lines were
knocked down.</LD>
<TE>   "Any time you have a significant amount of snow or ice, it's an
emergency," said Jay Reiff, spokesman for South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges.
"People here are just not used to this."</TE>
<TE>   A hard freeze made things worse Thursday morning, and another freeze
was expected overnight Friday. Warm days, like those forecast for the
weekend, can be a mixed blessing because fast-melting snow turns to ice
when temperatures drop at night.</TE>
<TE>   But not all is bleak. Kids in Alabama learned how to build snowmen and
pack a good, hard snowball, and South Carolina state employees, with
unexpected days off Thursday and today, played snow football in downtown
Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   The storm crept across a huge swath of the South, from Louisiana to
Virginia, crippling several major airports, including the nation's
busiest, Hartsfield Atlanta International.</TE>
<TE>   Almost 5 inches of snow had fallen in Atlanta and temperatures
remained in the low 30s. Flights at Hartsfield were reduced from 180 an
hour to 40, and some travelers were stranded on planes as long as eight
hours.</TE>
<TE>   Downtown Atlanta was nearly deserted Thursday. On the hill of Andrew
Young International Boulevard, a couple of elderly tourists, in tennis
shoes and jackets too light for the cold wind, stepped gingerly between
icy patches on the sidewalks.</TE>
<TE>   "Be careful. It's slippery," a passerby yelled. The two nodded. And
kept going.</TE>
<TE>   Conditions were even worse in North Carolina, where many parts of the
state were covered in a foot of snow.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a huge amount of snow for North Carolina," said Tom Carlson, a
meteorologist for Weather Central Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan McFeaters, assistant director of Wake County Emergency
Management in Raleigh, N.C., said many people are hunkered down indoors.</TE>
<TE>   "At 10 o'clock this morning, I walked out on one of the main streets
downtown and looked left and right and saw one person," he said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   There was even snow in the Panhandle in Florida, with flurries spotted
in Pensacola, on the Gulf of Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   A slow-moving low-pressure system is causing the precipitation, and
with temperatures 15 to 20 degrees below average, what normally would be
rain is snow.</TE>
<TE>   The forecast for the weekend looks much better, with sunshine and
temperatures in the 50s predicted for much of the South. But another
storm system is expected to blow in Sunday night.</TE>

<HD>Richardson to Seek N.M. Governorship</HD>
<DH>Politics: The Clinton Energy chief and former U.N. ambassador plans
to join the battle for the Democratic nomination, an aide says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ALBUQUERQUE
</DL>
<LD>Former Energy Secretary Bill Richardson will seek the Democratic
nomination for governor of New Mexico, an aide said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "You can be 100% sure he's going to be announcing for governor," said
Richardson's senior advisor, David Contarino.</LD>
<LD>   Richardson, 54, will make his formal announcement Jan. 12, Contarino
said.</LD>
<TE>   Richardson represented northern New Mexico's 3rd Congressional
District for 14 years. He was tapped to head the Energy Department in
1998, making him one of the highest-ranking Latinos in the Clinton
administration. Richardson also served as U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations.</TE>
<TE>   In June, he joined Kissinger McLarty Associates, a Washington-based
advisory company headed by former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger,
as senior managing director.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson took the helm of the Energy Department at the start of a
string of security scandals at U.S. nuclear weapon labs, including the
imprisonment of Los Alamos National Laboratory scientist Wen Ho Lee. Lee
eventually pleaded guilty to one count of mishandling nuclear data.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson has said another security lapse at Los Alamos--the
disappearance and reappearance of two hard drives in the lab's top-secret
X Division--hurt his chances of being Al Gore's vice presidential
candidate in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Two Democrats have already announced they'll run for the party's
nomination in the June 4 primary: state Land Commissioner Ray Powell and
former state Rep. Gary King.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gary Johnson, a Republican, is completing a second term and can't
run again.</TE>

<HD>Daschle Proposes Business Tax Breaks as Part of Economic Plan</HD>
<DH>Budget: Senate majority leader attacks GOP's stimulus ideas and
offers a Democratic alternative.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Two weeks after efforts to expand unemployment benefits and cut
taxes collapsed on Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle
(D-S.D.) proposed new business tax breaks Thursday in a bid to take the
offensive on economic issues in an election year.</LD>
<LD>   Under Daschle's plan, companies that hire more workers this year would
be eligible for a "job creation tax credit." And businesses would be able
to claim a larger tax break for certain equipment--a one-year bonus meant
to encourage new investment.</LD>
<LD>   Daschle laid out his plan in advance of a speech he plans to deliver
today at a Washington think tank. It is intended to serve as a Democratic
counterpoint to President Bush's State of the Union address later this
month.</LD>
<TE>   Daschle, a Democratic leader and a potential contender for his party's
2004 presidential nomination, will use the speech to step up his attacks
on the Bush-backed $1.35-trillion tax cut enacted last spring.</TE>
<TE>   "At a time when we need to fight both a war and a recession, when our
nation has urgent needs on all fronts, the tax cut has taken away our
flexibility and left us with only two choices--both of them bad," Daschle
said in excerpts of his prepared text. "We can shortchange critical
needs, such as strengthening homeland security, or we can raid the Social
Security surplus and borrow money to pay for them. We cannot have it both
ways."</TE>
<TE>   But Daschle stopped short of proposing a freeze or rollback of the tax
cuts. Some Democratic strategists have warned him against staking out
such politically risky positions as the party tries to defend--and
expand--its slim Senate advantage in November's elections.</TE>
<TE>   On the tax cuts, Daschle essentially left the ball in Bush's court. He
urged the president to submit a budget request that would show the
federal government is committed to fiscal discipline.</TE>
<TE>   Calling for a "comprehensive plan for economic growth," Daschle said
that a disciplined federal budget would pay dividends by keeping down
long-term interest rates. "In a real sense, low interest rates are the
best possible tax cut," Daschle said. "They help families afford college,
buy cars, purchase homes and pay off credit card debt."</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials recently acknowledged that the
government is heading for a period of budget deficits and have asked
Congress to raise the federal debt ceiling. While many Democrats blame
the tax cuts, administration officials attribute the budget crunch far
more to the war on terrorism launched after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks and to the national recession that began in March.</TE>
<TE>   The Daschle plan also proposes substantial, but unspecified, increases
in spending on domestic security; investments in education, job training
and federally sponsored research; making broadband Internet access as
universal as telephone service; and expanding benefits for farmers and
others hit hard by competition from foreign imports.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle reiterated his support for expanded presidential authority to
negotiate trade agreements, words that will be welcomed by a White House
pushing for Senate approval of that proposal.</TE>
<TE>   But the White House will be less cheered by Daschle's call for a
"balanced national energy plan" that boosts production and conservation.
Democrats routinely use that phrasing when criticizing Bush's energy plan
as too tilted toward production.</TE>
<TE>   With his business tax proposals, Daschle sought to advance a debate on
economic recovery that stalemated when Congress adjourned in late
December. Republicans sharply criticized Daschle as an obstructionist who
stood in the way of the Bush-backed economic stimulus bill.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those Republicans were cool to Daschle's new plan.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) called it
a stealth vehicle for raising taxes. "America has now seen the
Democratic-proposed spending spree," said Ron Bonjean, "and we are now
looking for the tax increase. . . . We know it's inevitable from a
Democratic-controlled Senate."</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) termed it "a positive step" for
Daschle to offer his plan. "Now the test for him is to show the kind of
leadership needed to actually reach these goals in a closely divided
Senate."</TE>

<HD>In Giuliani's Private Life, Talk Not Cheap</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is joining the lucrative speaking
circuit and will command up to $100,000 per engagement by some estimates.</LD>
<LD>   Giuliani is represented by the Washington Speakers Bureau, whose
clients include Al Gore, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole and Elizabeth Hanford
Dole, along with Giuliani's former police and fire commissioners.</LD>
<LD>   Giuliani, who served eight years as mayor, was named Time magazine's
person of the year after his stewardship of the grief-torn city following
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   He left for a Florida vacation with his girlfriend, Judith Nathan,
after swearing in his successor, Michael R. Bloomberg, early Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   He was scheduled to speak Thursday before General Electric executives
at a Boca Raton club, according to Gary Sheffer, a spokesman for GE.
Sheffer would not say what Giuliani was being paid or what he was
expected to talk about. The event is private.</TE>
<TE>   Experts have estimated that Giuliani could make as much as $100,000
per engagement. The speakers bureau did not return a call seeking
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Once he returns to New York, Giuliani is also expected to set up an
office for his new consulting firm and complete plans for the Rudolph W.
Giuliani Center for Urban Affairs. The center is expected to serve as a
think tank but also to create a Giuliani library, which will include
documents from his time in office.</TE>
<TE>   While presidential libraries are common--Bill Clinton's is being built
in Little Rock, Ark., Ronald Reagan's is in Simi Valley, Calif.--a
library focusing on one mayor's administration is not.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani also has a $3-million deal with Talk Miramax to write two
books: an autobiography and a book on management issues.</TE>

<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>Acting Gov. Jane Swift picked a gay staff member who has served as
legislator and suburban mayor as her running mate in the 2002 election,
dismissing questions about their youthfulness and disagreement over gay
marriage.</LD>
<LD>   Swift, 36, a Republican, announced her selection of Patrick C.
Guerriero, 33, on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "It is a great challenge to be your running mate, and I accept it,"
Guerriero said.</LD>
<TE>   Guerriero will challenge millionaire James Rappaport, the former state
GOP chairman and the only declared Republican candidate for lieutenant
governor, in the September primary.</TE>
<TE>   Swift had publicly stated she does not want to run with the more
conservative Rappaport, citing personality differences. She took a jab at
him at Thursday's news conference, saying she was happy to be running
with someone who never lost an election. Rappaport was defeated by U.S.
Sen. John F. Kerry in the 1990 race for Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Rappaport said Guerriero was a "nice young fellow" but labeled himself
the more experienced candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Guerriero, an advocate for gay rights, works on the governor's staff
as a liaison with municipal officials and helped persuade Swift to delay
cuts in local aid last year. He is also an established Republican, having
served as mayor in the Boston suburb of Melrose and three terms in the
state House.</TE>
<TE>   Swift had been turned down by two other men, one a county sheriff, the
other a district attorney, before picking Guerriero as her running mate.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Guerriero and Swift echoed the themes that will mark
their campaign: lowering taxes and strengthening education. They said
they agreed to disagree on the issue of gay marriage, which Guerriero
supports and Swift opposes.</TE>
<TE>   Candidates for lieutenant governor and governor technically do not run
as a ticket in state primaries, but Republicans have teamed up for
political and financial strength.</TE>

<HD>Florida Death Row Inmate Is Freed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RAIFORD, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>A man who spent 17 years on death row was freed Thursday after
prosecutors decided not to pursue charges in a murder case that fell
apart after another man confessed.</LD>
<LD>   "They can give me a billion dollars and they cannot pay for what they
did to me," Juan Melendez told reporters in the parking lot minutes after
being released from Union Correctional Institution.</LD>
<LD>   Melendez, 50, was convicted of killing a cosmetology school owner in
1983. His sentence was upheld by the Florida Supreme Court, but a
transcript of another man's confession was discovered two years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Defense attorneys say Vernon James, now deceased, confessed to at
least four investigators or attorneys, but none of the admissions was
admitted as evidence. A judge last month said Melendez deserved a new
trial.</TE>
<TE>   Polk County prosecutors decided against another trial because one of
the two witnesses against Melendez has recanted and the other is dead,
said Chip Thullbery, administrative assistant state attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "That leaves us, frankly, with nothing to proceed on," Thullbery said.</TE>
<TE>   During his years on death row, Melendez said, he never despaired.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm innocent. I should not die here. I should not spend the rest of
my life in prison," he said. "Without hope, I probably would have
committed suicide."</TE>
<TE>   Thullbery, who was not involved in the original prosecution, offered
no apologies for the way the case was handled.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a lot of people looking back over a lot of different years
and you have somebody in prison who decided to recant his testimony," he
said. "We can't try the case now, but it certainly was a case that needed
to be tried then."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy to finally have it over and to have Juan released," said
Marty McClain, an attorney who pursued Melendez's appeal. "But it really
is a sad day that the system allowed this to happen and for it to go on
so long."</TE>
<TE>   Melendez said he plans to return to his native Puerto Rico and live
with his 73-year-old mother.</TE>

<HD>Concerns Over Criticism Stall Decision on Pollution Rules</HD>
<DH>Environment: Insiders say Bush team will take pro-industry stance
on scaling back the Clean Air Act. Internal debate delays announcement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>As the Bush administration prepares to announce regulatory changes
that could weaken the Clean Air Act, White House officials appear to be
haunted by the ghost of controversial environmental decisions past.</LD>
<LD>   The administration already is more than four months past its own
deadline for revising a key program that requires companies to install
modern pollution-control devices when making major modifications to
equipment and increasing emissions.</LD>
<LD>   The terrorist attacks and an internal debate over the revision have
slowed the process.</LD>
<TE>   As of Thursday, administration officials could only advise that the
announcement would come soon, possibly within weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The belabored ruminations reflect some administration officials'
desire to avoid the public relations bruisings the president took last
year for initially rejecting a Clinton administration plan to reduce
arsenic in drinking water and reversing a campaign pledge to regulate
greenhouse gas-producing carbon dioxide, according to congressional and
administration officials.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's delay in announcing what insiders say is a
pro-industry decision also illustrates the particular importance of this
action, which environmentalists say could be the most significant scaling
back of the clean air law since it was enacted in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   Utilities, manufacturers, chemical companies and other major polluters
have pushed the administration for regulatory changes that would clarify
how they can expand or renovate their plants without installing new
pollution-control equipment. They argue the regulatory program, known as
"new source review," currently discourages companies from making
renovations that would improve plant efficiency and save energy.</TE>
<TE>   The administration appears likely to give industry at least some of
what it wants, but doing so will invite criticism that it is endangering
public health by allowing more air pollution.</TE>
<TE>   Breathing pollution can cause respiratory problems, hospitalization
for heart or lung disease, and even premature death, according to the
Environmental Protection Agency.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the kinds of things industry wants are going to look like the
administration is retreating on clean air," said a Republican
congressional aide. He spoke on the condition that he not be named
because his boss is working behind the scenes to prevent the
administration from weakening the Clean Air Act.</TE>
<TE>   "If it makes it look like the administration is unconcerned with the
environment or unconcerned with public health or unconcerned with the
Northeast or acting like a tool of industry--any of those things can
create political reverberations," the aide said of the anticipated
revisions.</TE>
<TE>   But industry officials say the changes will give companies the clarity
they need to know that they can conduct routine maintenance without
triggering the requirement that they install modern pollution-control
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "Reforming new source review enhances energy efficiency," said Scott
Segal, a Washington lobbyist representing utilities. "Maintaining the
status quo will harm the environment, harm energy efficiency and harm
workplace safety."</TE>
<TE>   EPA officials, including Administrator Christie Whitman, and
pro-environmental Republican lawmakers have urged the administration to
pair the regulatory rollback announcement with news of a legislative
proposal to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and
mercury from power plants. The White House is seriously considering that
option, according to a senior administration official.</TE>
<TE>   "The administration has been consistent in saying they will do nothing
to exacerbate current air quality or to undermine the Clean Air Act,"
said S. William Becker, executive director of the State and Territorial
Air Pollution Program Administrators and the Assn. of Local Air Pollution
Control Officials. Yet draft proposals from the administration go too
far, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "If these changes are implemented as we understand, industry would be
allowed to increase their emissions significantly more than what they
would be allowed under existing law," said Becker, who has spoken to EPA
officials about the potential changes.</TE>
<TE>   Some GOP lawmakers worry that their party will be labeled as callous
about pollution unless the administration effectively presents a
pollution-cutting proposal along with its changes to the new source
review program. They also worry that if the administration gives business
regulatory relief now, it will lose an important negotiating tool to
encourage business to agree to a new law that will lower pollution by
capping emissions.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter, Rep. Sherwood L. Boehlert (R-N.Y.) told White House
officials they should make regulatory relief contingent on industry's
support for tough pollution caps.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Scott McClellan said the White House had not
received a final recommendation on the new source review reform from
government agencies.</TE>
<TE>   A group of officials from the White House, EPA and Energy Department
have been debating since the spring details of the new source review
reform. Vice President Dick Cheney pushed for a review of the regulation
as part of the administration's energy plan.</TE>
<TE>   Under consideration are exemptions that would let plants make changes
without installing new pollution control devices if the cost of the
renovations is less than a specified amount; if emissions from the whole
plant remain below a specified cap, which could be the plant's highest
emission level over the last 10 years; and for up to 15 years after
installing state-of-the-art pollution-control devices.</TE>
<TE>   The administration stresses that no final decisions have been made.</TE>
<TE>   "We're getting to the light at the end of the tunnel," said Joe
Martyak, EPA spokesman. Clean air advocates say administration officials
are aware of the political pitfalls.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's pretty clear from meetings with people that they keenly
realize they would be clobbered in the media for simply announcing a
rollback of new source review," said Frank O'Donnell, executive director
of the advocacy group Clean Air Trust.</TE>

<HD>Texas Judge Agrees to Free Crime Writer Held for Contempt</HD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>An aspiring Texas freelance writer jailed since July for defying a
subpoena demanding her notes about a murder case will be freed today, the
judge who jailed her ordered Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Vanessa Leggett, a 33-year-old writing lecturer at the University of
Houston, has been jailed for contempt since July 20, when she refused to
turn over her notes to a federal grand jury looking into the 1997 killing
of a wealthy Houston bookie's wife.</LD>
<LD>   Leggett's release will coincide with the expiration today of the term
of the grand jury that called Leggett to testify. U.S. District Judge
Melinda Harmon's ruling was sealed because of the secret nature of the
grand jury proceedings but did grant Leggett's release, lawyers on both
sides of the case said.</LD>
<TE>   Federal law allowed Harmon to jail Leggett until she complied with the
subpoena or the term of the grand jury expired. Prosecutors did not
attempt to extend the term of the investigative panel, as they did once
before.</TE>
<TE>   Leggett, who has been in jail for 167 days, has asserted a reporter's
privilege.</TE>

<HD>Cook Arrested in Killing of Priest</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BERNALILLO, N.M.
</DL>
<LD>A short-order cook who had been jailed in four other states was
arrested Thursday on charges of fatally beating a priest at a monastery
that serves as a treatment center for troubled clergymen.</LD>
<LD>   Steven A. Degraff, 33, already jailed on an unrelated crime, confessed
to Sandoval County sheriff's deputies that he killed Father Michael Mack,
59, court records show.</LD>
<LD>   Mack was an alcohol counselor at the Servants of the Paraclete
compound, an isolated center in the Jemez Mountains in north-central New
Mexico.</LD>
<TE>   Degraff was being held Thursday at the Sandoval County jail on a
$1-million bond. He was scheduled to be arraigned today on charges of
murder, kidnapping, robbery, aggravated burglary, stealing a vehicle,
criminal damage to property and six counts of tampering with evidence,
court records said.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's deputies said Mack, who had lived alone in a cottage about
two miles from the compound, had been stabbed and bludgeoned to death.
His pajama-clad body was found Dec. 8.</TE>
<TE>   Mack had moved into the cottage Dec. 2, less than a week before the
homicide, to start a year of personal study and reflection and to do some
counseling, said Father Ray Gunzel, director of a treatment center at the
compound.</TE>
<TE>   "This Steven Degraff was one of the first people that Mike would have
been reaching out to help. He was always working with the underdogs, the
misunderstood and the oppressed," Gunzel said.</TE>
<TE>   Degraff allegedly entered Mack's home and stole his wallet, keys and
car, court records show.</TE>
<TE>   The suspect reportedly told investigators he was armed with a knife
and a hammer during the killing, the records said. Sandoval County
Undersheriff Karl Wiese said investigators have not yet found the
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   He later led deputies to the car, which was found on Thomson Ridge in
Sandoval County with the keys still in the ignition, the records said.</TE>

<HD>Va. Governor Lambastes Convict Releases</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>RICHMOND, Va.
</DL>
<LD>Gov. James S. Gilmore sharply criticized the Virginia Parole Board
for releasing two men convicted in Washington-area murders and demanded
that the board's five members either stop freeing killers or resign.</LD>
<LD>   Administration officials said the release last month of Joseph Martin
and Floyd Honesty, who were serving life sentences in unrelated 1970s
slayings, infuriated Gilmore, a former law-and-order prosecutor and state
attorney general.</LD>
<LD>   In a harshly worded letter released Wednesday, Gilmore, a Republican,
lambasted the board members, all of whom he appointed. He called their
decisions "outrageous actions" and "unacceptable to me and to the
citizens of Virginia," and he criticized the board for not adequately
notifying the victims' families or consulting with prosecutors before
releasing the men.</LD>
<TE>   "If you feel as though you cannot discharge your duties and live up to
the spirit of Virginia laws designed to protect Virginia citizens, you
should submit your resignation," the governor wrote. "Any further parole
actions such as those described above will, in my opinion, constitute
such failure."</TE>
<TE>   James Jenkins, the board chairman, who opposed parole for both men,
said the board members who voted to set them free weighed several
factors, including the number of years they had served and their good
prison records. It took a unanimous vote of the board's four other
members to release the two men.</TE>
<TE>   Martin, 51, a former insurance agent, was convicted in a 1977
murder-for-hire scheme that left a client and his fiancee dead in their
North Arlington home. Martin served 22 years of his sentence, which was
life plus 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Honesty, 47, was convicted in the fatal 1975 bludgeoning of a Navy
sailor in Fairfax County. He served 26 years of his life sentence.</TE>

<DL>PITTSBURGH
</DL>
<LD>AIDS activist and author Larry Kramer has been discharged from the
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, two weeks after the HIV-positive
patient underwent a liver transplant.</LD>
<LD>   Kramer, 66, will remain in Pittsburgh for a few more weeks so doctors
can monitor his condition until he's well enough to return home to New
York, hospital officials said. The author and playwright suffered from
end-stage liver failure caused by hepatitis B and underwent 12 hours of
surgery Dec. 21.</LD>
<LD>   He left the hospital Wednesday evening, accompanied by friend and
primary caregiver Rodger McFarlane, the former director of Gay Men's
Health Crisis Inc., an AIDS organization Kramer helped found.</LD>
<TE>   Kramer also founded the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or ACT UP.</TE>
<TE>   Kramer wrote the plays "The Normal Heart" and "The Destiny of Me." His
screenplay for the 1969 film "Women in Love" was nominated for an Academy

<HD>Pig Organ Breakthrough Raises Infection Fears</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>As science moves closer to using pig organs for human transplants,
some experts caution that the technique could transfer deadly swine
viruses. Ethicists question the whole idea of using animals to make spare
parts for people.</LD>
<LD>   Two research teams announced this week that they have cloned piglets
that lack one of two genes that prompt the human immune system to reject
swine tissue. The next step is breeding or cloning that would eliminate
the gene entirely from a strain of pigs.</LD>
<LD>   In a world where more than 5,700 people in need of transplants die
each year because of the shortage of donated organs, many researchers
view pigs as a potentially unlimited supply source. By removing a gene
that causes a swift and powerful rejection by the human immune system,
researchers hope that pig organs could be made available to people.</LD>
<TE>   But some experts caution that the whole field of
xenotransplantation--transplanting tissue from one species to another--is
fraught with infection risks, to the transplant recipients and perhaps to
other humans.</TE>
<TE>   Pigs are known to contain what are called porcine endogenous
retroviruses, which evolved with the swine over millions of years and now
are part of the animals' genes.</TE>
<TE>   The viruses do not affect the pig, but what would happen if the
animal's organs are transplanted into humans? Perhaps nothing, or perhaps
it could lead to a whole new disease, say some experts.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a recipe for disaster," said Alix Fano, head of the Campaign
for Responsible Transplantation, an organization of scientists and
doctors opposed to xenotransplantation. "Pigs are a reservoir of viruses,
and we have no idea what their organs would do if transferred to humans."</TE>
<TE>   Others agree that swine viruses are a serious, complex problem with no
clear solution, but they believe science will find a way.</TE>
<TE>   "That is a genuine concern. There is a risk," said George J. Agich,
chairman of bioethics at the Cleveland Clinic. "The ethical question is
whether there is a risk to the general population from a procedure that
would benefit a single individual. But we have at our disposal scientific
means to determine if that risk is reasonable."</TE>
<TE>   Until then, he said, "we should be extremely cautious. We may be
talking about decades before we can roll out this technology
[xenotransplantation]."</TE>
<TE>   Some studies in which humans were exposed to pig cells have suggested
that the viruses do not infect human cells. But critics say there are
many other examples showing that some retroviruses that are harmless in
one species become virulent killers when transplanted into other humans.</TE>

<HD>Reagan Papers, Under Wraps a Year, Are Released</HD>
<DH>Presidency: Aides' memos are part of the 8,000 pages of documents
made public. Thousands more are due by April.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eight thousand pages of documents from the Reagan presidency were
released Thursday, a year after they were scheduled to be made public.</LD>
<LD>   Among the documents unveiled at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library
in Simi Valley are memos from advisors, including Elizabeth Hanford Dole
and Chief of Staff James A. Baker III, as well as papers dealing with
agriculture, energy and economic policy, said library director Duke
Blackwood.</LD>
<LD>   An additional 60,000 pages that also were to be released in January
2001 are expected to become available by early April.</LD>
<TE>   "We are pleased any time we can open additional documents," Blackwood
said. "Our mission is ready access to the information."</TE>
<TE>   In one of the memos released Thursday, Elizabeth Dole wrote in 1982 to
three Reagan advisors that the president's image as a "man's man" was
hurting him with female voters.</TE>
<TE>   "While this characterization has been helpful with men, it may have
worked to his detriment with regard to women," Dole, then special
assistant to the president for public liaison, wrote in the handwritten
draft.</TE>
<TE>   "An often-heard question is whether the president takes women
seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Not all scholars were satisfied with Thursday's release. Many are
frustrated with the current administration for repeatedly postponing
release of the papers. Late last year, the Bush administration gave
former presidents greater power to withhold papers of their choosing
beyond the 12-year period set forth in the Presidential Records Act. The
act covers papers that contain confidential advice and information.</TE>
<TE>   Hugh Graham, a Vanderbilt University historian who is organizing a
conference of Reagan scholars in Santa Barbara this year, said the
decision to release the 8,000 pages is a public relations move meant to
quell criticism over that executive order.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a gesture so that they can say, 'See, we're good guys, we're
producing these documents and everyone can come look at them,' " Graham
said. "They're trying to get the monkey off their back. But it's not
going to get us off their backs."</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen said the
organization will continue to pursue a legal challenge of the executive
order.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Blackwood said he expected researchers to descend on the
library in the coming weeks to examine the newly released papers. He said
the presidential library holds 45 million to 50 million pages; 4.5
million pages have been made public.</TE>

released. It's only gotten older and many of us have gotten bogged down

State Colin L. Powell, Budget Director Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. and White
