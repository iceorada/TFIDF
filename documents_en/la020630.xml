<HD>Memories a Salve for 3 Uncles Lost in War</HD>
<DH>Family: A film inspired the writer to learn about her
relatives who died in World War II. The search brought pain but peace
of mind.</DH>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They were always smiling, always looking down at me.</LD>
<LD>   There were four men in uniform in the portrait in my grandmother's
living room. They are my uncles, soldiers during World War II.</LD>
<LD>   Three of them--Jay, Tom and Danny Baluh--died in that war, all
within 12 months. My grandfather was in the picture too; he died
years later, heartbroken.</LD>
<TE>   My uncles died before I was born. My family didn't speak of them
often and I'm ashamed to admit I didn't ask. I knew almost nothing
about them.</TE>
<TE>   It was the 1998 film "Saving Private Ryan," and its effect on my
parents, that aroused my curiosity. It wasn't their reaction to the
movie, because they didn't see it -- they wouldn't see it. It was
their reaction to hearing about the film.</TE>
<TE>   "It hits too close to home," my mother said.</TE>
<TE>   In "Saving Private Ryan," one brother is killed in the Pacific
campaign, and two others die on Normandy's beaches. In real life, Tom
died in the Pacific, and Danny and Jay died in France.</TE>
<TE>   In the movie, there is a daring mission to bring a fourth brother
back home. There were no such heroics in real life; there was nothing
left to rescue.</TE>
<TE>   Except for the memory of my three uncles, and I set out to do just
that.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When I began my search in 1998 I had no intention of involving my
family. There was no point, I thought, in having them relive all that
pain just to satisfy my curiosity.</TE>
<TE>   There were all sorts of obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   A 1973 fire at the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis
destroyed 80% of the military records from 1917 to 1959. Records in
Pennsylvania were destroyed by Tropical Storm Agnes in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   And the biggest obstacle of all: World War II vets are dying at a
rate of 1,000 per day. As one vet told me: "You should have started
this 10 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   First, I tried to get my uncles' military records, but I had only
their names to go on. An official at the records center said I needed
their service numbers and politely told me I would need a closer
relative to make the requests. Their parents are dead, I said, and
the men never married and had no children.</TE>
<TE>   He said a brother or sister would do--but I didn't want to involve
them.</TE>
<TE>   The Army said it would need the dates of death to search death and
burial files. The Church of St. Stephen in Plymouth, Pa., could tell
me only that "they were buried sometime between Sept. 19, 1947, and
Nov. 15, 1947," and the Larksville American Legion, where their
bodies lay in state, didn't have records of the funeral.</TE>
<TE>   I remembered hearing that a Baluh post had been named in their
honor. After a few calls I learned that the Larksville Veterans of
Foreign Wars Baluh Memorial Post No. 6551 was established on April
25, 1946, but declared defunct on May 27, 1953.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, I stumbled onto two wonderful people: Ken Schlessinger, a
military archivist at the National Archives and Records
Administration in College Park, Md., and Jesse Teitelbaum of the
Luzerne County Historical Society in Wilkes-Barre, Pa. Schlessinger
found my uncles' service numbers and Teitelbaum sent me newspaper
clippings about their funeral.</TE>
<TE>   My father had told me the funeral was a big deal, and he wasn't
exaggerating. Articles started appearing in the Wilkes-Barre Record
in October 1947, when my uncles' bodies arrived in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the men's pictures were printed. Jay was a string bean,
tall and incredibly thin. Danny was cute, and young--he was drafted
at 18 and died about two months after his 19th birthday. Tom wore a
big grin, and as I got to know him better, I learned how different he
was from the others. There was a lot going on behind that smile.</TE>
<TE>   My grandparents, John and Mary Baluh, reared their seven boys and
a girl in coal company housing in Larksville, a town of about 8,000
in northeastern Pennsylvania's Wyoming Valley. And it was to
Larksville that the boys would return.</TE>
<TE>   Originally, they were scheduled to be shipped back separately. But
I would later learn that my grandfather had requested that all three
be sent home together "because [of] the expense of three funerals and
the emotional upset that would result from burying each boy at
different times."</TE>
<TE>   They arrived on Nov. 10, to more than 500 people waiting at the
station. There was a procession through Wilkes-Barre, Kingston,
Edwardsville and then Larksville, where the bells of St. Anthony's,
St. John's, St. Casimir's and Brooks Memorial churches tolled.</TE>
<TE>   "As the three caskets were carried to hearses at the railroad
station, the veterans present to pay homage stood at attention" with
tears in their eyes, reported another paper, the Times-Leader Evening
News.</TE>
<TE>   Grandma cried, "Which one is in that one?" as the first casket was
placed in a hearse.</TE>
<TE>   "But the veterans and the undertaker, Andrew Strish, busy with the
task at hand, did not hear her, and no one could give the answer,"
the paper reported</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 12, the Record told the story of the funeral, how "scores
of ex-servicemen" paid their respects and "hundreds of people lined
the streets."</TE>
<TE>   The day the newspaper clippings arrived, my husband came home to
find me crying--the first tears for the uncles I never knew.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   But who were these men?</TE>
<TE>   When the death and burial records arrived, Tom, Danny and Jay
began to take shape.</TE>
<TE>   There were names, ranks, service numbers, dates of induction,
dates of death.</TE>
<TE>   I learned that Jay was inducted in June 1942 at age 27, was
wounded twice and died in September 1944. Tom was 25 when he was
drafted in November 1942; he died of infectious hepatitis a year
later. Danny was inducted in September 1943 and was dead in less than
a year.</TE>
<TE>   There were lists of personal effects. Danny and were infantrymen,
soldiers in the 79th Infantry Division, 315th Regiment; they had what
they could carry and it wasn't much.</TE>
<TE>   Danny had a wallet with 100 francs, a key, 11 souvenir coins and a
religious medal. Jay had with him eight photos, a wallet, a fountain
pen, a greeting card, a religious card, francs, souvenir coins and
his first Purple Heart.</TE>
<TE>   Tom was stationed at a base with the 6th Infantry Division, 1st
Field Artillery, Battery C. There were 200 items on his list, among
them duplicate shaving, sewing and shoeshine kits. There was a
marksmanship badge, a deck of cards, two prayer books and a New
Testament.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, between February and September 2000, I received copies of
my uncles' military service records--some barely legible, many
charred by the 1973 fire.</TE>
<TE>   These papers told me that all three men finished eighth grade. Jay
worked as a pants presser in a clothing factory. Tom was a mechanic's
helper and farmhand; Danny also worked on a farm. They all had brown
hair and ruddy complexions. Jay had blue eyes, Tom's and Danny's were
hazel.</TE>
<TE>   They had money deducted from their pay for "partial support" of
the family. Jay sent home $30 a month, Danny $25 and Tom $20.</TE>
<TE>   Each had money deducted for a $10,000 life insurance policy. I
later found out that my grandmother didn't want the insurance money,
calling it "blood money." Her children, however, persuaded her to
bank it. Thirty years later, it would help pay her nursing home
bills.</TE>
<TE>   All three were thin, but Jay was so tall and skinny--"markedly
undernourished," if I can decipher the doctor's notes on the charred
document. He weighed 124 pounds. Danny was shorter and weighed even
less. The doctor wrote that his hands were "cold, sweaty ... he is
shy ... appears seclusive."</TE>
<TE>   Danny arrived in England in mid-June of 1944. He joined Company A
of the 315th as a replacement on July 14; four days later, he was
dead at 19. The company was in a defensive position near the Ay River
in France; it is not known how he was wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Like Danny, Jay died a private first class, though he had been
busted back to private once because he took a couple of extra days'
leave. Unlike Danny, he survived his first combat, though not for
long.</TE>
<TE>   He hit France's beaches on June 14, 1944, and the unit saw combat
five days later in the assault of Cherbourg. Jay was wounded on July
5 on the Cotentin Peninsula; he suffered a "light head wound" from
cannon fire and was hospitalized. He didn't rejoin the unit until
Aug. 30.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, according to regimental reports, the unit engaged
in "bitter house-to-house fighting for the town of Chatenois ...
casualties were high on both sides with E and F [Jay's unit]
companies suffering the most on our side."</TE>
<TE>   Jay was among them. He died Sept. 16 of a severe head wound.</TE>
<TE>   Tom never saw combat. He was sent to Hawaii in late September 1943
and had been there about a month when he became ill. The autopsy
report said Tom probably had a viral infection when he received his
yellow-fever vaccine, and the two were a deadly combination. His
temperature topped 106 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   He died Nov. 19, 1943, the first of the brothers to perish.</TE>
<TE>   I tried, in vain, to find comrades who served with Danny, Tom and
Jay, and remembered them well. Aside from one who had a vague memory
of Jay as a tall, skinny guy with a helmet three sizes too big, none
could recall them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two years into my search, I still didn't know what my uncles were
like. Were they quiet men like their brother Fran or lively like
their brother Joe? Were they loving men like my father?</TE>
<TE>   On a visit home, I told my mother what I'd been doing.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, Dad asked me about my findings. I showed him
some carefully chosen records. He didn't say much, and left the room.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, he returned, carrying a box.</TE>
<TE>   "Thought you might like to see these," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It was a battered box of memories--photos of my grieving grandma,
flag-waving crowds, the procession. A wooden frame with a picture of
a flag and three gold stars--one for each son.</TE>
<TE>   With that, my father started to tell me about his brothers. And I
began to interview other members of the family.</TE>
<TE>   They told me about Danny, who was every little brother's dream. He
played with Dad and my Uncle Fran, building basement forts and
funhouses. He played baseball and football and shot hoops in the
yard; he was a crack shot with his BB gun. "I'll probably go and get
my leg cut off and I'll be back," he told Fran when he got his draft
notice.</TE>
<TE>   They told me about Jay. "I'll always think of him as a saint,"
Aunt Dorothy said. He was a quiet man, a hard worker who didn't drink
or smoke. Though he didn't dance, he would drive his girlfriend to
dances and wait in the car until it was time to drive her home.</TE>
<TE>   And they told me about Tom, the mischievous one who loved pickles
and playing cards (he was quite good at it) and girls. He was an
altar boy, but he got into some scrapes-- such as the time he broke
into a pool hall when he was in fifth grade, or the times he got
caught smoking or borrowing homework from his buddies.</TE>
<TE>   But "he would give you the shirt off his back," said Uncle Joe.
Tom worked in a garage and on a farm, at restaurants, at Civilian
Conservation Corps camps and at a plant in Connecticut making
bullets. The Army took him even though pneumonia had affected his
lungs.</TE>
<TE>   The telegrams the family received, notifying them of the brothers'
deaths, were sympathetic, in a bureaucratic kind of way: "The
Secretary of War asks that I assure you of his deep sympathy in the
loss of your son Private Thomas J. Baluh."</TE>
<TE>   And a letter in Jay's file: "The significance of his heroic
service to his country will be preserved and commemorated by a
grateful nation."</TE>
<TE>   Fran remembers the messengers who delivered the news. They "came
in quick and left in seconds," he recalled. "They knew what they were
delivering." His sister Dorothy said the telegrams seemed to arrive
one right after another.</TE>
<TE>   When Danny, Jay and Tom came home in their caskets, the procession
paused in front of their old house. "You're home now," their mother
said. "Go ahead in."</TE>
<TE>   Life in that house was never the same.</TE>
<TE>   Al, the fourth brother to serve during the war, retired as a
sergeant in 1952. He would be the last to serve. When my father
received his draft notice during the Korean War, his parents argued
that their son was needed at home and that the Baluh family had given
enough. He was deferred.</TE>
<TE>   My grandmother poured her energy into her home, and baking. The
aroma of bread from her oven would waft through the neighborhood. My
grandfather, though, could not move on. After the boys died, he was
frequently hurt at work, and retired in 1946 when he was in his 50s.
He sat rocking on the porch--"a broken man," Fran said.</TE>
<TE>   He died in 1955.</TE>
<TE>   There are no monuments to the Baluh boys. Their names are included
among the 49 WWII dead on a brass plaque in the borough building.
There is a stained-glass window in St. Stephen's that reads: "In
memory of parents John Sr. &amp; Mary and John Jr., Thomas and Daniel
Baluh."</TE>
<TE>   One miserable winter day, I went to the cemetery, my first visit
since my grandmother died 20 years before. I located the graves the
way we did when I was a kid.</TE>
<TE>   First you find the water faucet, then walk a couple of rows back
and a couple of plots to the left. There they were, with three bronze
military insignias in front of the Baluh headstone flanked by two
stone angels.</TE>
<TE>   I pushed away some dirt and leaves to reveal each flat stone:</TE>

<DH>S. America: Suicide rates among Indians climb as tribes
lose hope of regaining ancestral property.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL ASTOR</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>ANTONIO JOAO, Brazil</DL>
<LD>ANTONIO JOAO, Brazil -- The ceiling of Ramao da Silva's grass-roofed
hut was so low he had to kneel to hang himself. Using a dirty shirt
for a noose, the 24-year-old Kaiowa Indian strangled slowly and
deliberately.</LD>
<LD>   Neighbors recall how da Silva had agonized over the prospect of
being forced off his tribe's traditional lands. No matter that it was
74 rocky acres unsuitable for farming, that it had no game or fresh
water, that it legally belonged to a cattle rancher. He would die
before he left it.</LD>
<LD>   "He couldn't take it any more, the uncertainty of whether we'd be
evicted or not. He didn't want to see his wife and kids beaten.
That's why he killed himself," says Hamilton Lopes, a community
leader.</LD>
<TE>   The remaining Kaiowa also are gradually asphyxiating, as Western
civilization encroaches on their ancestral lands and traditional way
of life. Repulsed by ranchers and police, the Indians are turning to
alcohol and suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1986, 348 Kaiowa and Guarani Indians have committed suicide
-- 42 last year alone -- in Mato Grosso do Sul, a frontier state
nearly the size of California on Brazil's western border with
Paraguay and Bolivia.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, there's no way out for the Kaiowa, for the Guarani, for
any Indian," says Mario Turibio da Silva, Ramao's cousin. "Life has
lost its meaning. Before we had total liberty. Today, we have court
injunctions, beatings and tear gas."</TE>
<TE>   For Ramao da Silva, the end came March 5, as federal police were
preparing to evict him and 300 other Kaiowa Indians from an area they
invaded three years earlier to pressure the government into declaring
it an Indian reservation.</TE>
<TE>   A last-minute court injunction had postponed the eviction for 90
days, long enough for the Indians to harvest their meager crops. But
it was too late for da Silva, the latest victim in a clash of two
cultures and conflicting laws intended to protect both.</TE>
<TE>   "On the one hand, the Constitution guarantees indigenous peoples
the rights to their ancestral land," explains Nereu Shneider, a
lawyer working with the Kaiowa. "On the other, it protects private
property."</TE>
<TE>   Ranchers and Indians, caught in the middle, legitimately claim the
land belongs to them. While the friction is more evident in
fast-developing areas like Mato Grosso do Sul, it is quickly
spreading as western civilization reaches into the vast Amazon rain
forest, home to most of Brazil's 500,000 Indians.</TE>
<TE>   "What is happening in Mato Grosso do Sul today is what the Amazon
will become tomorrow," Shneider warns.</TE>
<TE>   In March 2000, Federal Indian Bureau anthropologists identified
two sacred Indian cemeteries and marked the boundaries of 24,200
acres around the invaded area as Kaiowa land, the first step in the
long bureaucratic process of creating a reservation.</TE>
<TE>   But meanwhile, much of the proposed Cerro Marangatu Indian
reservation occupies Pio Silva's 3,344-acre Fronteira ranch. Under
Brazilian law, Silva is entitled to government compensation for
"improvements" to the land -- such as houses, fences and bridges --
but not for the land itself.</TE>
<TE>   That didn't suit the 86-year-old rancher. So in December, he
obtained a court order to evict the "trespassers."</TE>
<TE>   "I paid taxes on the land all those years and now they don't even
want to pay me for it. That's not right," says Silva (no relation to
Ramao da Silva).</TE>
<TE>   Silva claims his family had good relations with the Indians until
outsiders started "manipulating" them and making trouble. He likes to
show visitors a video, produced with the help of a local TV reporter,
featuring scenes of Indian children lining up to get Christmas
presents from his family, and his son solemnly donating a soccer ball
to a group of smiling teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   His 46-year-old son, Pio Queiroz Silva, who handles most of the
day-to-day ranching chores, is less tolerant. "I defend Indians
anywhere in the world, but I have to defend myself when they want to
kidnap me, steal my cows and take over my property," he says.</TE>
<TE>   He's especially bitter toward the Catholic Church and its
Indigenous Missionary Council, which gets foreign funding -- largely
from Germany -- and pays for lawyers to defend the Indians. For the
younger Silva, it's part of an international plot to keep Brazil poor
and backward.</TE>
<TE>   The council's assistant director, Saulo Feitosa, says his group is
merely helping the Indians assert their constitutional rights.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe the Kaiowa's invasions are legitimate and legal, and
that they are necessary to ensure the federal government honors its
responsibility to demarcate Indian lands," Feitosa says.</TE>
<TE>   Under Brazil's 1988 Constitution, all Indian lands were supposed
to be demarcated within five years. But the process is so costly,
controversial and time-consuming that today only about 30% has been
fully delimited, Feitosa says.</TE>
<TE>   To pressure the government into action, Indians have begun
"retakings," as they call their invasions of traditional lands.
Eleven of the 15 Kaiowa-Guarani reservations established since 1988
were the result of retakings, which in general are tolerated although
they are illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Until the 1940s, the Kaiowa and the related Guarani tribe roamed
freely over about a quarter of Mato Grosso, which means "thick
forest" in Portuguese. Today, the state has been divided in two and
most of the forest cut down for pasture and grain fields. The 60,000
Indians in the two tribes are confined to small hard-to-farm lots
constituting less than 1% of the state's total area.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, a Kaiowa Indian lies drunk under a glaring noonday sun,
his plaid shirt buttoned to the neck and his head resting against a
mud-and-stick wall. Despair has settled in on the Fronteira ranch,
and the Kaiowa say they will commit collective suicide if the police
come to evict them.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say if they'll do that, but it's very probable they'll
react violently to any forced eviction," said Wiliam Rodrigues, the
acting Federal Indian Bureau administrator in the region. "The bureau
is just going to have to work to get them more time."</TE>

<HD>Letting Off Steam Into the Chinese Sunset</HD>
<DH>Asia: The last country to use steam locomotives in large
numbers is saying goodbye--and in some cases good riddance--to a link
to the past.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN LEICESTER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>TONGCHUAN, China</DL>
<LD>Liberation 2368 is a beautiful beast living on borrowed time.</LD>
<LD>   On most days, the huffing, puffing steam engine pants back and
forth through the honey-colored hillsides of central China, pulling
loads of coal with hacking hisses of complaint. But the end of the
line is in sight.</LD>
<LD>   "This engine's off for a major overhaul next month. They'll test
the pressure of the boiler and if it's still up to scratch, it'll go
for another year. If not, that will be the end," says Xiao Tang, a
driver of the 45-year-old behemoth.</LD>
<TE>   With barely a tear or backward glance, China is saying goodbye to
steam. And when it turns the page, so will we all.</TE>
<TE>   China is the last country still using steam locomotives in large
numbers. Their demise will all but close the steam chapter of
history--an era that spanned the Industrial Revolution to the Atomic
Age.</TE>
<TE>   Liberation, Construction, Victory, Peace, the People--the names of
China's great steam locomotives echo a time when the People's
Republic was young.</TE>
<TE>   After the civil war ended with communist victory in 1949,
railroads helped knit the broken country together. On their steaming
backs they hauled steel, coal and other building blocks of a new
China. They took troops to war in Korea. They shipped rice and
revolution to and from far-flung Chinese provinces.</TE>
<TE>   Today's China of the Internet and mobile phones, of space launches
and microwaveable Peking duck in a bag, feels little nostalgia for
the past.</TE>
<TE>   Modernization is the mantra now; diesels and electrics rule the
rails. Hypermodern Shanghai is building a high-speed train that will
ride on a magnetic cushion instead of wheels.</TE>
<TE>   Swedish-built electrics called "New Speed" whisk passengers
between the go-go southern cities of Shenzhen and Guangzhou, 91 miles
in 55 minutes. Chinese trains have become faster, cleaner, more
comfortable than ever.</TE>
<TE>   But where's the adventure?</TE>
<TE>   "Globalization can mean tremendous progress, there's no doubt
about it. But on the other hand, it's a kind of disease of dull
uniformity --one culture, one size fits all," says Rob Dickinson, a
Briton who is loco about steam and travels to China to track down
lines where it's still used.</TE>
<TE>   "The steam locomotive--it's a living creature," he says. "You've
got to look after it. It has individuality."</TE>
<TE>   Under the communist government, China's rail network has grown
into one of the world's largest--43,500 miles of track that carried
1.05 billion passengers last year.</TE>
<TE>   But rail had a difficult birth in China.</TE>
<TE>   Although Chinese labored on the American transcontinental track
completed in 1869, back in China, railroads were shunned. Chinese
feared the tielu--iron roads--would swallow farmland, destroy jobs
and, most important, speed encroachment by Western powers eyeing
China's markets and resources.</TE>
<TE>   They also feared railroads would disturb graves and feng shui--the
spirits of "wind and water" Chinese believe are essential for human
harmony with the environment.</TE>
<TE>   They might have been echoing Wordsworth's lament in 1844 over
plans to run a train through his beloved Lake District, "with its
scarifications, its intersections, its noisy machinery, its smoke,
and swarms of pleasure-hunters."</TE>
<TE>   The first track, a nine-mile, narrow-gauge built by the British
firm Jardine Matheson in Shanghai in 1876, was bought by the Chinese
government, which ordered it torn up.</TE>
<TE>   "To us, railways mean free intercourse, enlightenment, commerce
and wealth; to the Mandarins, they suggest rowdyism, the overthrow of
time-honored custom and tradition, disturbance and ruin," commented
the North China Herald, a foreign-run newspaper of the time.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, foreign powers forged ahead. Over time, Chinese
attitudes changed too. China had 13,500 miles of track when the
communists took power. It doubled in 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   When the chaotic Cultural Revolution erupted in 1966, millions of
young radicals--the Red Guards--careered around China in jampacked
trains, squeezing into luggage racks, between cars, even into
toilets. Many trains were powered by steam.</TE>
<TE>   "Chairman Mao, thank you for letting us travel all over the
country without paying a cent," read a Red Guard poster of the time.</TE>
<TE>   Even locomotives got revolution. The Qianjin model, which means
progress, was for a time renamed "Anti-Imperialism."</TE>
<TE>   China was the last country to manufacture steam trains. Production
of large locomotives continued until 1988. Smaller ones were produced
into the late 1990s. In all, 10,000 were built.</TE>
<TE>   Today, as many as 400 remain, says Fang Shujiang, secretary of the
China Steam Engine Assn. Although largely vanished from national
lines, they still ply provincial and local tracks, serving mines,
steelworks and lumber yards.</TE>
<TE>   In northern China's Inner Mongolian region, Qianjins haul
passengers and goods between the towns of Jining and Tongliao. It's
the last long-haul steam route in the world, Dickinson says. The
trains cover the 585 miles in 25 hours.</TE>
<TE>   In India, small pockets of steam rail still function, but regular
steam operations ended in February 2000, according to Harsh Vardhan,
the Indian Steam Railway Society's newsletter editor and archivist.</TE>
<TE>   Dickinson says that after China, Cuba and Indonesia come a distant
second, with about 100 steam locomotives each that work seasonally
three to four months a year at sugar mills. A tiny handful survive in
Vietnam, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Myanmar, he says.</TE>
<TE>   China is "out on its own, which is why so many tour groups go
there every year," he says. "You really are seeing what in the world
today is a unique phenomenon. When it finishes in China, there'll be
very, very little left."</TE>
<TE>   But the sunset of steam can't come soon enough for train crews in
Tongchuan, a dingy mining and cement-manufacturing town in central
Shaanxi province.</TE>
<TE>   They drive red-wheeled Liberations, hauling coal from Tongchuan's
mines. It's dirty, tiring, ear-piercing and lung-burning work, badly
paid with long shifts. Even as they acknowledge that steam has unique
qualities, they say its time has come.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're at a standstill in summer, it reaches 50 degrees
[Celsius; or, 122 Fahrenheit] in here," 36-year-old stoker Chen
Jianli said in the toasty-warm cabin of Liberation 2368. "But you
can't take your shirt off because if there's venting steam it will
blister your skin."</TE>
<TE>   Liberations were the first Chinese-made steam locomotives.
Production began in July 1952. Tongchuan's half-dozen are thought to
be the last left working anywhere in China.</TE>
<TE>   Riding one at work is like being trapped in the belly of a dragon
with heartburn. Every few seconds, the stoker opens the furnace door
to shovel in coal, bathing the cabin in fiery orange light. The roar
of escaping steam makes conversation impossible. Tunnels quickly fill
with suffocating, acrid smoke. The stoker drops to his knees,
coughing. Other members of the six-man crew cover their mouths with
the collars of their overalls. Can't breathe. Can't speak. Can't see.
Can't think.</TE>
<TE>   And out! The locomotive spews into sunshine at the other end.
Breaths are drawn, throats cleared, cigarettes lighted. "It really
stinks," said Bai Jing, 33, a stoker. "After a while, it must be bad
for your lungs."</TE>
<TE>   The locomotives are watered and restocked with coal every day,
their pistons and bolts oiled at the start of each 12-hour shift, and
their furnaces emptied of coal ash after each trip. Only during
overhauls or when they are sidelined are their fires extinguished, so
even when not pulling loads, the engines steam and sputter to
themselves and their metal cabin floors throb with life.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers listen for any abnormal rattle and wheeze. "I can hear
where things are broken, where bolts have come loose," said Zhou
Xingwu, Liberation 2369's driver.</TE>
<TE>   Train spotters, both Chinese and foreign, may prove to be steam's
saviors of sorts. Tongchuan mine and tourism officials talk about
building a museum, preserving some Liberations and even teaching
enthusiasts to drive them.</TE>
<TE>   Remaining locomotives are being scrapped, and enthusiasts believe
steam will all but vanish within the decade. Zhou, the driver in
Tongchuan, gives Liberations there another five years at most.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't feel pity," he said. "This is history. Society is forging
ahead."</TE>

<HD>Seeking Due Respect for Sacred Tree</HD>
<DH>Caribbean: A 300- year-old baobab on the Virgin Islands has
been neglected, some say. In its African home, the tree is believed
to be a dwelling place of spirits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM DAY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands</DL>
<LD>The gnarled branches of the 300-year-old Grove Place baobab tree have
shaded labor meetings, child's play--and less pleasant events.</LD>
<LD>   In 1878, its branches were used to hang sugar cane workers who led
an uprising against plantation owners on the island of St. Croix,
when this American territory in the Caribbean was a Danish colony.</LD>
<LD>   But these days garbage piles up around the huge tree, and the
grass is overgrown and untended.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think people really understand the historical
significance of the tree," says Olasee Davis, an environmental
scientist at the University of the Virgin Islands. "It needs to be
taken care of. It has not been getting the respect it deserves."</TE>
<TE>   Davis would like to see the tree in a neighborhood west of
Christiansted protected as a historic landmark.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 60 feet in circumference, it is believed to have been
planted with seeds brought by slaves from Africa, where some people
believe the baobab is a sacred dwelling place of spirits.</TE>
<TE>   Baobabs have a peculiar denuded appearance, which legend
attributes to gods in a frivolous mood planting the trees upside down
with their roots exposed to the sky.</TE>
<TE>   Common in Africa, Madagascar and Australia, the baobab--also
called the cream of tartar tree--briefly grows leaves in the wet
season and produces large, white fragrant flowers that develop into
oval gourds.</TE>
<TE>   The kernels are eaten raw or roasted and are highly nutritious.
Leaves and roots are used for medicine, the bark is made into string,
rope and twine, and the gum can be used as glue.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has been lobbying Virgin Islands senators to designate the
Grove Place tree a historic site and to provide money for a sign and
upkeep. No bill has been introduced yet, says Hectito Francis, a
spokesman for the territory's legislature.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of honoring the baobab appeals to people familiar with
the tree.</TE>
<TE>   As a girl growing up in Grove Place in the 1930s, Chrystalia Edney
Parris remembers union meetings being held under the tree. She and
her friends played with their dolls in the hollow trunk and joined in
community gatherings in the shade of the tree.</TE>
<TE>   "The elderly people used to play 'kaiso' and dance under that
tree," she says, using an older word for calypso music. "That tree is
a landmark."</TE>
<TE>   Slaves likely brought baobab seeds to the Caribbean in an effort
to maintain a spiritual connection to Africa, says John Rashford, an
anthropologist at the College of Charleston who has studied the
distribution of baobabs throughout the world. St. Croix has about 120
of the trees, more than any other Caribbean island, he says.</TE>
<TE>   In the West African nation of Senegal, the baobabs' large trunks
have been used to contain the remains of elders. In other places, the
trees are seen as aids to fertility.</TE>
<TE>   But in the Caribbean, baobabs have taken on a more secular role.</TE>
<TE>   "People have a very deep and emotional attachment to the trees,"
Rashford says. "The baobab has come to represent the landscape and
people of Africa."</TE>

<HD>Long Live Rock, The Who Decides</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE GORMAN</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The two surviving members of veteran rock band The Who will carry on
with their North American tour despite Thursday's death of the
group's bassist, John Entwistle, the group said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   In a surprise announcement issued by their management, lead singer
Roger Daltrey and guitarist-songwriter Pete Townshend said the tour
would open on Monday at the Hollywood Bowl "as a tribute to John
Entwistle and to the loss of an irreplaceable friend."</LD>
<LD>   "The Entwistle family is in full support of the decision to
continue and feel this is what John would have wanted," the statement
added.</LD>
<TE>   Entwistle's son, Christopher, added that his father "lived for
music and will always live within The Who's music. This is what he
would have wished, and our love goes out to the remaining band
members and the entourage that makes up The Who family."</TE>
<TE>   Entwistle, a founding Who member regarded as one of the most
influential bassists in rock music, was found dead in his Las Vegas
hotel room, a victim of what was widely believed to have been a heart
attack. He was 57.</TE>
<TE>   An autopsy was to be performed by the Clark County coroner in Las
Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Entwistle's death, 24 years after The Who's original drummer,
Keith Moon, died of an accidental pill overdose, came on the eve of
what was expected to be one of the marquee U.S. concert series of the
summer.</TE>
<TE>   Townshend, Daltrey and Entwistle originally were scheduled to
launch a three-month, 24-venue tour on Friday in Las Vegas with an
ensemble that included drummer Zak Starkey, son of former Beatle
Ringo Starr. That show was canceled, along with a concert planned for
Saturday in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   The Las Vegas and Irvine shows will be rescheduled, the band's
managers said.</TE>
<TE>   A source close to the band said Thursday night that a devastated
Daltrey and Townshend spent several hours in Los Angeles after
learning of their bandmate's death. Entwistle had arrived in Las
Vegas ahead of them to open a traveling exhibition of his artwork.</TE>
<TE>   The Who's last tour of North America in 2000 grossed $21.1 million
in ticket sales, 21st among all touring acts that year.</TE>
<TE>   Although the band decided to return to the road without Entwistle,
his death left in doubt the outcome of a new studio album the group
had begun preparing. It would be their first since 1982's "It's
Hard."</TE>
<TE>   It also leaves The Who without the figure who had been the band's
anchor from its beginning nearly 40 years ago. Affectionately
nicknamed "The Ox," Entwistle was the calm, stationary presence at
the center of the explosive stage antics of Daltrey, Townshend and
Moon, and his musicianship stood out as no rock bassist had before
him.</TE>
<TE>   His kinetic playing style, punctuated by fills, counter-melodies
and other embellishments, brought his bass lines to the forefront of
the group's sound as a quasi-lead instrument.</TE>
<TE>   Tributes to the bearded, taciturn musician poured in from around
the world Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Wyman, the former bassist for the Rolling Stones, called
Entwistle "a great friend for many years--the quietest man in
private, but the loudest on stage.</TE>
<TE>   "He was unique and irreplaceable--I am shocked and devastated,"
Wyman said.</TE>

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Brooke Front was weary.</LD>
<LD>   Unsteady on his feet, his back drooped with stress from a long day
at the Rocky Mountain Horse Expo until owner Bill Bormes dragged his
thumb sharply along the chestnut show stallion's spine, releasing
tension and righting posture.</LD>
<LD>   Bormes said he learned the acupressure technique from a
veterinarian. "I just make a mild adjustment and Brooke's posture is
back to being near perfect," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Techniques such as acupuncture, acupressure and chiropractic
treatments are becoming mainstream tools used to complement Western
medicine in animal care, veterinarians say.</TE>
<TE>   The number of vets involved in the International Veterinary
Acupuncture Society has grown substantially from about a dozen to
more than 1,400, spokesman Ed Boldt said. Formed in 1974, the Fort
Collins, Colo.-based nonprofit teaches acupuncture courses and aims
to create uniform international standards.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to be the only place that offered courses in acupuncture,
but now there are a bunch of schools offering classes," Boldt said.
"That's a great sign."</TE>
<TE>   Among them: Tufts, Cornell, and Texas A&amp;M universities.</TE>
<TE>   Acupuncture is designed to relieve pain or induce regional
anesthesia by inserting needles into specific points of the body. It
is also used to stimulate nerve function, hormone levels and blood
circulation.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Narda Robinson, who performs acupuncture on animals at
Colorado State University, said most patients suffer from muscular
and skeletal pain, and head and neck pain.</TE>
<TE>   "After we insert a needle into the body, there is a profound
relaxation. Horses will start licking their lips, letting their heads
drop down and dogs will lie down and sleep," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Acupressure and chiropractic techniques used on people have
similar effects on animals. Vets use their hands to perform
massage-like movements geared toward releasing endorphins and
relieving muscle spasms.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson recently treated a 5-year-old champion German shepherd
named Sepp, who was suffering from a strained ligament that affected
his showmanship. With acupuncture treatments, Sepp was able to
overcome the lameness in his leg.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado State horse expert Gayle Trotter said the best candidates
for chiropractic work are horses with chronic back problems caused by
their daily routine.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have tools to treat certain problems, and some animals
just won't get better. This helps ease the pain," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Trotter stands on a stool while he carefully works to adjust a
horse's limb. Gentle movements calm the animals and make them more
receptive to treatments.</TE>
<TE>   Trotter said some vets are skeptical about the effects of
chiropractic care, though most of the animal caretakers are pleased
with the results.</TE>
<TE>   "If I look at an animal and find a problem, I will do whatever I
need to get the problem corrected," Trotter said.</TE>
<TE>   Some horse owners say the techniques are frivolous.</TE>
<TE>   Jackie Dunn, who trains mustangs at stables near Elbert, about 40
miles southeast of Denver, said her animals don't need the treatments
because she already cares for their muscular pain by making sure
saddles aren't too tight, and by rubbing them down after they are
worked.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just not an issue for my animals," she said. "I try to make
sure they aren't overworked."</TE>
<TE>   Veterinarian Steve Long, who's been in practice in Golden, Colo.,
for more than 20 years, said acupuncture can be helpful in some
cases, but it shouldn't be expected to replace traditional medicine.</TE>
<TE>   "It does some good, but only in specific cases," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Long doesn't perform the treatments, but sends some patients to
acupuncturists.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that it wouldn't be nice to learn how it works, but it's
hard enough keeping up with all the regular tools we need to know."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson and Trotter stressed that the techniques are used to
complement other medical procedures and cannot replace surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson started the university-based veterinary acupuncture
course at Colorado State in 1998. Since then, about 60 vets per year
from all over the world take the course, which reviews anatomy of the
acupuncture points and teaches students how to insert needles.</TE>

<HD>Veterans Remember 'Fort Apache'</HD>
<DH>Crime: The notorious 41st Precinct in the Bronx symbolized
urban decay. It spawned a movie, books and plenty of real-life drama.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY McSHANE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Everyone agrees on this much: it was a hellacious night in the 41st
Precinct, back in the early '70s, with the phones ringing off the
hook. Lt. Lloyd Gittens, a precinct icon, grabbed one of the calls.</LD>
<LD>   Within seconds, he abruptly ended the conversation: "I don't have
time for that. This is Fort Apache."</LD>
<LD>   Gittens hung up, and a legend was launched.</LD>
<TE>   The 41st Precinct, tucked away on a garbage-strewn block in the
crumbling South Bronx, had a new identity. Its spontaneous nom de
guerre spawned a Paul Newman movie and several books, while turning
the neo-Renaissance precinct house into a national symbol of urban
decay.</TE>
<TE>   Its officers embraced the name, producing T-shirts, sweat shirts
and a new logo: a precinct house as porcupine, with arrows protruding
from its windows. Working there became a badge of honor.</TE>
<TE>   "It was amazing how much went on," says retired cop John O'Brien,
who spent 15 years in the neighborhood. "We did more on one tour than
some people did in a year."</TE>
<TE>   The 41st typically recorded 120 to 130 homicides in the early
'70s. An average day in 1971 included 17 burglaries, eight robberies,
and a half-dozen other major crimes.</TE>
<TE>   There were stories: A grisly bow-and-arrow murder. The discovery
of a gorilla, its skin carefully peeled off, near a local meat
processing plant. The theft of all four tires from a lieutenant's
car--during his first South Bronx shift.</TE>
<TE>   And then there was the time ... Wait.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, I can't tell you all of them," O'Brien says, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, O'Brien told some more when he joined about 100 other
alumni of the 41st Precinct at a Bronx reunion.</TE>
<TE>   The get-together, the group's first since 1999, was likely much
tamer than the territory they once patrolled.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very difficult place to work back when it was 'Fort
Apache,' and the guys got close," explains Billy Rath, the reunion
organizer and a 15-year veteran of the 41st.</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien, who arrived at the precinct in 1968, said the "suits" at
police headquarters had no idea what the officers of the 41st faced.
"These guys would come in on Monday morning and say, 'What did those
[guys] do in the South Bronx this weekend?' '' O'Brien, now a manager
of internet services for Fordham University, recalls with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   "Fort Apache"--the nickname summons a vision of a lone outpost of
justice amid rampant lawlessness. When the 41st Precinct stood on
Simpson Street, it was just that.</TE>
<TE>   The precinct's alias "was symbolic of what, in those days, was the
story of the decline of New York," says Thomas Reppetto, co-author of
"NYPD: A City and Its Police."</TE>
<TE>   Rath arrived in 1967 to find a neighborhood already in steep
decline. The streets belonged to brutal local gangs--the Savage
Skulls, the Ghetto Brothers, the Seven Crowns.</TE>
<TE>   Yet few officers transferred out of the precinct; most chose to
stay and fight.</TE>
<TE>   "Curiously, the Fort lent us a feeling of immortality," wrote Lt.
Tom Walker in his 1976 book, "Fort Apache, Bronx, NY."</TE>
<TE>   It was only a feeling, though. In 1971, the year Walker arrived,
two 41st Precinct cops were killed. Other officers were lost to
alcoholism or psychological woes as they waged an often fruitless
fight against the area's endless crime wave.</TE>
<TE>   For the survivors, the bond forged inside the 41st stretched into
the new millennium--which some doubted they would ever see, given
that one year in the precinct saw 35 shootouts with local criminals.</TE>
<TE>   "It's funny," O'Brien says, "in the Four-One, it was a different
thing. It was the people and the cops of the precinct against the
world."</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien and Rath were gone by the mid-'80s, and the neighborhood
began a turnaround.</TE>
<TE>   After a decade in which no private businesses opened in the
neighborhood, two new supermarkets arrived in the early '90s. Now, on
a spring Saturday morning, shoppers a block from the old precinct
grab groceries at C Town, footwear at Fabco shoes, jeans at
Underground Fashion.</TE>
<TE>   Second-grade girls in white dresses line up to have their First
Communion pictures taken, oblivious of the local history.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the precinct had just a dozen murders. The 6,433
burglaries of 1971 plunged to 225. The 2,632 robberies dropped to
239.</TE>
<TE>   The current crop of officers at the 41st report to work at a
$13.5-million precinct that opened several blocks away in 1993. While
the cops at Fort Apache traded bullets with the locals, the new
precinct features a huge recruiting ad painted on its side: "New
York's Finest needs all of New York's finest."</TE>
<TE>   "Fort Phoenix," says Rath, who swapped the South Bronx for the
British Virgin Islands after his January 2000 retirement. The old
building was gussied up and granted landmark status by the city in
1992; now it's surrounded by row houses with vinyl siding in shades
of blue and beige.</TE>
<TE>   The piles of garbage are long gone; outside 1102 Simpson Street,
cans and bottles are separated for recycling. The old precinct serves
as a home for some special police units.</TE>
<TE>   The new precinct and its cleaned-up surroundings may make for a
better work environment, but Rath believes the current cops may be
missing something.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids who work there now don't come to the reunions," he says.
"I don't know if they have the camaraderie."</TE>

<HD>Historic Static Over Kite, Key Trick</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOANN LOVIGLIO</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>PHILADELPHIA -- Legend has it that 250 years ago in June, Benjamin
Franklin sailed a kite and a key into a stormy Philadelphia sky and
made a shocking discovery: Lightning was a form of electricity.</LD>
<LD>   His test sparked criticism from clergy, who feared he was
challenging God, and earned him acclaim in America and Europe as one
of the greatest minds of his era. It continues to generate debate
among some historians who say Franklin might not have even conducted
the experiment taught to generations of schoolchildren.</LD>
<LD>   "When I teach Franklin, I always try to plant the seeds of doubt
in the minds of my students" about the kite-and-key experiment, said
Richard Rosen, science historian and dean of Drexel University's
College of Arts and Sciences. "Even if he did do it, we don't know
exactly when or where, which is also part of the problem."</LD>
<TE>   Other historians, however, say there's ample evidence the scholar,
scientist and statesman did conduct the famous test--despite the fact
that no firsthand account has been found, there were no witnesses
other than Franklin's son and the most specific details were
recounted by Franklin's colleague, Joseph Priestley, some 15 years
later.</TE>
<TE>   "It did happen," said Roy E. Goodman, a historian and curator at
the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia. "We don't have
the place but we know it was conducted on the fringes of downtown,
and we have Priestley's report and his recollections from Franklin."</TE>
<TE>   According to that account, the 46-year-old inventor and his
21-year-old son, William, set out one day in June 1752 to prove
Franklin's theory about the nature of lightning.</TE>
<TE>   The pair went into a field to await a thunderstorm, and a passing
storm cloud -- not a lightning bolt -- negatively charged the kite,
string and key. Franklin wasn't jolted because he was holding a piece
of dry silk that insulated him from the charge. But when he touched
the key, a spark jumped to his hand.</TE>
<TE>   That discovery paved the way for later innovations from the
battery to the dynamo.</TE>
<TE>   "What Franklin showed was that the experiments on static
electricity that were being done in the lab were not just for
amusement but were related to the great forces of nature," said I.
Bernard Cohen, historian and author of "Benjamin Franklin's Science."</TE>
<TE>   Franklin wasn't the first person to see the similarities between
earthbound static electricity and lightning, but he was the first to
suggest a test to confirm that fact, said David Rhees, executive
director of the Bakken Library and Museum in Minneapolis. The museum
has created an exhibit to coincide with the experiment's anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   And even if the belief of many historians is true that a scientist
in Marly, France, may have executed what was dubbed "the Philadelphia
experiment" before Franklin's test, there's still plenty of reasons
to celebrate his accomplishments, Rhees said.</TE>
<TE>   "Franklin wasn't the only one who came up with these ideas, which
some historians may try to use to diminish his reputation, but the
sheer genius of the man shines through," he said. "He may have been
scooped by the experiment at Marly, but it was an experiment based on
Franklin's suggestions in the first place."</TE>

<HD>Fed-Up Dads, Moms Fight Back</HD>
<DH>Crime: 'Drug dealers are terrorists,' says father who
dedicated himself to combat after his son died of an overdose. He
founded a group to help.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM KATES</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>TIOGA CENTER, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>The first time Steven Steiner tried to fight back against drug
dealers poisoning his son and millions of other American teens, he
couldn't find the words or the passion.</LD>
<LD>   He was just another parent who felt powerless--until his
19-year-old son died from a drug overdose in January 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, the 41-year-old electrician has turned into a
crusader. He founded Dads and Mad Moms Against Drug Dealers, or
DAMMADD.</LD>
<TE>   "Since Stevie's death, this is how I have a chance to work closer
with him, to work together," Steiner said. "Believe me, my candle
isn't going out anytime soon."</TE>
<TE>   DAMMADD accepts tips about drug dealers over the Internet and
offers rewards ranging from $100 to $1,500 for information leading to
a conviction. Thirty-eight law enforcement agencies in 14
states--Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas,
Virginia and Washington--have started formal partnerships with the
organization.</TE>
<TE>   Tips quickly led to 21 arrests in New York and Maine, 10 of them
resulting in convictions.</TE>
<TE>   Broome County Sheriff David Harder is impressed by the quality and
quantity of tips DAMMADD has received.</TE>
<TE>   "It sort of reminds me of the 'America's Most Wanted' show on
television," he said. "It gives citizens a way to fight back."</TE>
<TE>   As Steiner recalled the final tortured years of his son's brief
life, a 3-foot-tall photograph of Stevie stood against a wall in his
living room and, nearby, an urn containing his ashes. They anchor a
small memorial that has grown by the front window.</TE>
<TE>   Steiner said the idea for DAMMADD took seed while Stevie was
attending junior high school in Middletown, N.J. He struggled with
academics but thrived when he could work with his hands.</TE>
<TE>   At 13, he started learning his father's trade. He was also
learning about marijuana and alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   Steiner approached school administrators and local businesses
about setting up a reward fund and putting a bounty on drug dealers.
Administrators balked.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have the message back then. I really didn't," he said.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, Stevie was getting in deeper. In 1996, he stole his
father's credit card and ran away. Steiner had him arrested, pressed
charges and placed him in a juvenile hall for three months.</TE>
<TE>   After jail, the Steiners moved to upstate New York for a fresh
start, and it appeared 16-year-old Stevie had straightened out his
life. He continued working with his father. He saved some money and
bought a car.</TE>
<TE>   But by age 18, it was clear Stevie was again involved with drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't an addict. He never bought drugs. He would only smoke
and drink on weekends, with his friends and at parties," Steiner
said.</TE>
<TE>   He believes his son was acting on a dare on Jan. 29, 2001, while
at a Super Bowl party in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. Police said Stevie
snorted a fatal mix of Ecstasy and OxyContin, a powerful prescription
painkiller.</TE>
<TE>   The DAMMADD Web site has graphic photos of Stevie's bruised and
bloated body--the way police found him. His father displays the same
photos when he talks at area schools.</TE>
<TE>   His message conveys an honesty cloaked in pain.</TE>
<TE>   "Drug dealers are terrorists," he said. "Drug dealers are child
molesters. Not sexual, but the mental abuse. They are stealing their
youth, their integrity."</TE>
<TE>   Within two weeks of becoming a DAMMADD partner in mid-March, the
Brewer Police Department in Maine received 16 tips, including one
that helped lead to the arrest of five people and the seizure of
crack cocaine and heroin.</TE>
<TE>   "We had almost immediate success so we think this is a great
intelligence tool," Sgt. Perry Antone said.</TE>
<TE>   "People are sometimes hesitant to get involved. In small towns,
everyone knows everyone and there is a fear that things will get
tracked back if someone steps up with information," Antone said.
"With DAMMADD's system, I think people feel pretty insulated."</TE>
<TE>   From the basement of his home 85 miles south of Syracuse near the
Pennsylvania line, Steiner monitors the computer tip line. His wife,
Julie, runs the family electrician's business from a computer on the
other side of the room.</TE>
<TE>   Crumb-littered plates and a row of dirty glasses attest to the
long hours Steiner spends at the computer, checking incoming tips to
verify authenticity. The system has several layers of security and
encryption to protect tipsters.</TE>
<TE>   The credible tips he passes on to law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, gave Steiner $100,000 in
grants to develop DAMMADD after he described the project to its
representatives. The company will soon distribute tent cards with
tear-off sheets promoting the organization.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Steven and Julie Steiner quietly observed the first
anniversary of Stevie's death by instituting the Law Enforcement User
Interface system, which automatically routes tips by ZIP Code.
Steiner spent a few minutes that day telling his dead son what he has
helped accomplish.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a focus. I have a vision," he said. "It is getting all the
parents, all the families, all the communities and everyone
together....We're not going to just sit here and let our kids die one
by one. We're going to do something to fight back."</TE>

<HD>Prehistoric Horses Trot Out of Unique Project</HD>
<DH>Tarpans: Mustangs with ancient characteristics were bred to
resemble a creature shown in 15,000-year-old cave paintings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GILLIAN FLACCUS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>PRINEVILLE, Ore.</DL>
<LD>PRINEVILLE, Ore. -- Lenette Stroebel used to drive by horses on a
nearby ranch and wonder about the funny-looking animals with stand-up
manes, faint zebra markings and stout, rounded bellies.</LD>
<LD>   Stroebel, a horse lover for decades, had never seen anything like
them. Her curiosity quickly became an obsession.</LD>
<LD>   "Just being a horse person, I'd say, 'What are those?' I tried to
put two and two together," said Stroebel, who first spotted the
horses in the mid-1980s. "I knew this was something very different."</LD>
<TE>   It turned out Stroebel had stumbled onto a unique breeding project
conceived more than 25 years earlier by Harry Hegardt, another horse
lover. Hegardt had dedicated years to recreating an extinct
prehistoric horse from diluted genes still found in American wild
mustangs.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Stroebel noticed Hegardt's unusual herd, he had
succeeded in breeding rare horses--called Tarpans--that looked
astonishingly like their ancient ancestors painted on cave walls by
early humans.</TE>
<TE>   "He finally hit on the right horses and started getting the right
color and the right size, and then he even started getting the
stand-up mane," said Stroebel, who bought Hegardt's herd in 1990 and
has continued his project.</TE>
<TE>   "He knew he had really hit on something."</TE>
<TE>   Like its wild ancestor, which died out in the late 1800s, the
modern Tarpan has a thick mousy-gray coat--called "grulla" --marked
by a black stripe that runs from its head to the tip of its tail.
Today's Tarpan is slightly bigger than its ancestors--about 52 inches
tall--and well proportioned, despite a rotund stomach and thick head.</TE>
<TE>   Tarpan hooves are so hard the horses don't need shoes--a holdover
from the days when the little horses roamed Europe and the Middle
East in wild herds after the last Ice Age. Early humans noticed the
original Tarpans and may have even hunted them. Rock paintings of the
Tarpans' distant ancestors, with rounded bellies and spiky manes,
decorate the walls of caves occupied by humans 15,000 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   As centuries passed, however, human expansion narrowed the horses'
wild range. Farmers viewed them as pests. The last wild Tarpan, a
mare, was killed when she was chased off a cliff about 1890,
according to the American Tarpan Studbook Assn. in Medford, Wis.</TE>
<TE>   Fascination with the breed, however, did not die out.</TE>
<TE>   German brothers Heinz and Lutz Heck began in the 1920s and '30s to
try to "recreate" the lost Tarpan. They hoped to reassemble the
breed's genetic jigsaw puzzle as much as possible by mating horses
with strong Tarpan blood, creating a look-alike.</TE>
<TE>   The Heck brothers carefully selected horses--Gotlands, Icelandic
ponies and Fjords--that showed similar bone structure and unusual
markings and bred them together. The first "bred-back" Tarpan colt
was born in 1933 at the Munich Zoo.</TE>
<TE>   From there, the newly revived Tarpans spread to the United States
in the 1950s. There are fewer than 100 Tarpans in the United States
today, and most of them are descended from six original horses
brought here from the German project.</TE>
<TE>   The Stroebels, however, are challenging the established breeding
traditions.</TE>
<TE>   When Hegardt died in 1990, Stroebel and her husband, Gordon,
bought the 20 horses he left behind and continued his unique
experiment on their property, nestled in central Oregon scrubland.
They eventually named their ranch Genesis Equines.</TE>
<TE>   "When Harry died, we just didn't want to see the whole thing go up
in smoke and the horses get sold out as riding ponies," said
Stroebel.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a lifetime project."</TE>
<TE>   Like Hegardt, the Stroebels believe that strong Tarpan genes lie
hidden in the wild mustang herds of the American West.</TE>
<TE>   That's because those mustangs are descendants of horses that
escaped from Spanish conquistadors in the 1500s--horses that had
varying amounts of Tarpan blood. The Stroebels have continued
Hegardt's quest to capture horses from the wild with a Tarpan look
and breed them to draw out the ancient characteristics.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, for example, the Bureau of Land Management helped the
Stroebels sort through thousands of horses to find a wild stallion in
Utah that reinvigorated their breeding program.</TE>
<TE>   The American Tarpan Studbook Assn., however, maintains that modern
Tarpans cannot be bred from wild American stock because the mustangs
are too far removed from their ancestors.</TE>
<TE>   The conquistadors' horses, it says, were already removed from the
original Tarpan by "centuries of genetic culling and crossing."</TE>
<TE>   But the Stroebels point out that the Heck brothers, the original
"recreators" of the 1930s, were forced to crossbreed their horses
with the Przewalski, another ancient breed, because they couldn't get
the Tarpan's classic stand-up mane.</TE>
<TE>   Hegardt--and the Stroebels--have produced Tarpans with the elusive
pointy manes from American mustang stock without any trouble. They
also point out the original Tarpans are extinct, so an exact genetic
recreation can never exist.</TE>
<TE>   "We have had numerous discussions about this," said Stroebel. "It
all comes down to who can create the best look-alike."</TE>
<TE>   "We consider our herd an excellent phenotype of the original
Tarpan, which is all that matters."</TE>
<TE>   For the last 10 years, the Stroebels have struggled to keep
Hegardt's dream alive. They now have 35 horses and are ready to sell
their Tarpans--starting at $3,500 for a trained gelding.</TE>
<TE>   "We have scraped pennies and eaten soup and cheese sandwiches for
the last 10 years to keep this thing going," Stroebel said.</TE>
<TE>   They have already sold about 15 geldings to local rancher Kristy
Shockey, who is promoting the plucky little breed as one good for
anything--jumping, riding or herding. The Stroebels were thrilled
last year when author Jean Auel used their Tarpans as a model for the
prehistoric horses in her latest book, "The Shelters of Stone."</TE>
<TE>   A group from Wisconsin recently showed up at the Stroebels' ranch
with copies of Auel's book for them to sign.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing that really impresses me about these Tarpans is
they're basically almost wild, but they're not aggressive," Shockey
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Stroebels hope to complete a bloodline registry for their
stock in the coming months and then begin selling them.</TE>
<TE>   "People say, 'What do you do with these scrubby little horses?'"
said Stroebel, as a half-dozen horses nuzzled her for treats on a

<HD>Cracks in Reactors Attest to Problems at Aging Nuclear
PlantsReactorWorries</HD>
<DH>Safety: A 6-inch-thick steel dome was nearly breached at
one site. Inspections questioned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H. JOSEF HEBERT</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON--Severe cracks found at one nuclear power reactor and the
stunning discovery of a hole that nearly breached the 6-inch-thick
steel dome of another facility are raising new questions about aging
nuclear plants and whether they are being inspected closely enough.</LD>
<LD>   The hole that went through most of the reactor cover at the Davis
Besse power plant in Ohio and the severity of cracks found about a
year earlier at a reactor in South Carolina surprised federal safety
regulators and the industry.</LD>
<LD>   Both incidents have had plant operators scrambling to look for
cracking in reactor control rod nozzles and, more recently, for
corrosive boric acid on reactor domes. It was a government-ordered
inspection prompted by cracks found in South Carolina in early 2001
that led to the discovery of the David Besse hole last March.</LD>
<TE>   A primary reason for the corrosion was the longtime escape through
nozzle cracks of borated water from inside the Davis Besse reactor
vessel, investigators concluded.</TE>
<TE>   So far, no one else is reporting the kind of corrosion found at
the Ohio plant. Though 14 reactors on a close-watch list have
reported at least 62 nozzle cracks, most of the cracks have been
fixed and the rest are on a schedule for repair, industry and
government officials said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Duke Power said the 23 cracks found at its three
Oconee reactors at Greenville, S.C., have been fixed.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the discoveries have prompted new questions about aging
nuclear plants.</TE>
<TE>   "It was material degradation that wasn't expected," acknowledged
Alex Marion of the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry's trade
group. Still, he added, the problems should not affect relicensing
since the problems are identified and being dealt with.</TE>
<TE>   Some industry critics disagree.</TE>
<TE>   "The concern here is that with this inherently dangerous
technology, when it ages it becomes more and more unpredictable in
terms of how rapidly things can break, leak and crack," said Paul
Gunter, an anti-nuclear activist and industry watchdog.</TE>
<TE>   Most reactors have a 40-year license, and a growing number of
utilities are planning extensions.</TE>
<TE>   FirstEnergy Corp.'s 25-year-old Davis Besse reactor on the shore
of Lake Erie has been shut down since February, waiting for the hole
in the reactor dome to be patched.</TE>
<TE>   Like the reactor nozzle cracks found at the 28-year-old Oconee
reactor, the hole at Davis Besse was discovered before anything
serious could go wrong, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, federal regulators view the findings, especially at Davis
Besse, so troubling that some senior officials at the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission privately have characterized the cracking and
corrosion as the most significant safety issue facing the industry
since the Three Mile Island accident 23 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The steel reactor vessel, which encloses the reactor's core, has
always been viewed as "a sacred component" that will not be breached,
said Brian Sheron, the commission's assistant director for licensing
and technology assessment. "This really challenges that assumption."</TE>
<TE>   Only a thin noncorrosive stainless steel membrane kept the hole at
the Ohio reactor from bursting open. And nuclear experts say that if
the cracks at the Oconee plant had been allowed to continue, the
nozzle might have separated.</TE>
<TE>   In both cases, thousands of gallons of radioactive water would
have escaped from the reactor, raising the risk of the core's
radioactive fuel overheating and--in a worst-case scenario--possibly
a meltdown and a release of radiation from the larger concrete
containment building.</TE>
<TE>   Industry spokesmen said they are convinced that backup safety
systems would have averted more serious problems by pumping more
water into the reactor than was being allowed to escape to keep the
nuclear fuel safe until the reactor could be shut down.</TE>
<TE>   But that's true if everything works as planned, countered David
Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer and industry watchdog for the Union of
Concerned Scientists. If the emergency pumping systems become clogged
with debris, if other equipment is damaged or a gauge misread as
workers struggle to keep the fuel covered with water, a more serious
accident might be unavoidable, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis Besse corrosion was caused by a buildup of boric acid
from reactor cooling water that had been leaking from nozzle cracks
since the mid-1990s. The first signs of corrosion appeared four years
ago when rust began clogging filters, investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a 1988 NRC directive to keep reactor lids free of boron,
the layers of the powdery deposits hardened so much atop the
dome--where access is difficult because of space and radiation
exposure--that workers couldn't pry it loose.</TE>
<TE>   "If this occurred in Russia, we would be saying it could never
happen here," former NRC Commissioner Victor Gilinsky wrote in a
recent commentary on the Davis Besse discovery, calling it "a narrow
escape" from a potentially catastrophic accident.</TE>
<TE>   But the company's engineers did not link the rust to
safety-related corrosion and were assured that the boron powder was
harmless since they believed that heat from the reactor would
evaporate any moisture.</TE>
<TE>   But it is now believed that the water leaking from nozzle cracks,
rather than evaporating, settled beneath the hardened layers of
boron, providing enough moisture to turn the powder back into
corrosive boric acid.</TE>
<TE>   This produced "a whole new phenomenon," says John Grobe, head of
an NRC task force investigating the incident. "This kind of corrosion
has never been seen before on a reactor pressure vessel head."</TE>

<HD>As Its Poverty Ebbs, 'Appalachia' Expands</HD>
<DH>Geography: With federal aid as an incentive, areas campaign
to be included in the region. A Mississippi Delta county recently was
'annexed.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALLEN G. BREED</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ollie Grant woke up one morning in the Delta and went to bed that
night in Appalachia.</LD>
<LD>   She didn't leave Panola County, Miss., however; Appalachia came to
her.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush accomplished the feat this spring with a stroke of
his pen, when he signed legislation adding Panola to the War on
Poverty-era Appalachian Regional Commission's territory. The county's
slogan is, "Where the hills meet the Delta."</LD>
<TE>   "You definitely ain't hillbillies where we're from," says Grant,
who runs an event hall in Batesville called, appropriately enough to
her mind, the Delta Rose. "The city is only 219 feet above sea
level."</TE>
<TE>   To many outsiders, all of Mississippi--even the hilly sections--is
the Delta, and all of Kentucky--even the flat parts--is Appalachia.
But what Grant and others don't realize is that Appalachia ceased
being just a geographical designation long ago.</TE>
<TE>   And with the legislation, federal bureaucracy has crossed a
geographical, cultural and psychological line--a border between
mountaineers and flatlanders, tobacco and cotton, bluegrass and
blues.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole thing of what is Appalachia has been so politicized,"
said Ron Eller, former head of the Appalachian Center at the
University of Kentucky. "The definition of Appalachia has broadened
way beyond the physical geography of the region itself."</TE>
<TE>   When Congress created the Appalachian Regional Commission in 1965,
it covered 360 counties in 11 states. The territory stretched from
Alabama to Pennsylvania with its core comprised of the mountainous
regions of eastern Kentucky and Tennessee, and West Virginia--the
only state wholly within the commission's defined area.</TE>
<TE>   Almost immediately, others hopped on the gravy train. As a senator
from New York, Robert F. Kennedy succeeded in getting 13 counties in
his state added later that year. In 1967, 20 mostly hilly Mississippi
counties were included, along with four other counties from Alabama,
New York and Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi? That state has no mountains, the skeptics said.
Wrong, said the late John Whisman, the founding father of the
commission.</TE>
<TE>   The state had two rather formidable peaks, he said: "Mt. Whitten
and Mt. Stennis," referring to Rep. Jamie L. Whitten, the future
chairman of the House Appropriations Committee; and Sen. John C.
Stennis. (The southernmost piece in "Appalachian" Mississippi is
Stennis' home county.)</TE>
<TE>   Two more counties were added in 1990 and 1991, and seven more
signed on in 1998. With the addition this year of Mississippi's
Panola and Montgomery counties and two in Kentucky--decidedly less
than mountainous Hart and Edmonson--the region has swollen to 410
counties spanning 200,000 square miles.</TE>
<TE>   "One problem with attempting to view the region whole is that
Appalachia has no agreed-upon boundaries--nothing comparable to the
Mason-Dixon Line," which clearly marks a separation between regions,
John Alexander Williams writes in his just-published "Appalachia: A
History." The book will deal only with "core" areas of Georgia,
Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Al Smith, ARC co-chairman in the Carter and Reagan
administrations, says the region's shape has more to do with
patronage than with plate tectonics.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of those counties were blatantly political swaps," Smith
said.</TE>
<TE>   Eller recalls a time when counties were asking not to be included
in Appalachia, a term that "connoted poverty and violence and
distress and a lot of those negative images."</TE>
<TE>   "I remember lecturing up and down the region in the 1960s, and no
one wanted to be associated with Appalachia," he said. "If you talked
in West Virginia, Appalachia was in east Kentucky. If you spoke to a
group in east Kentucky, they said, 'Oh, yes. That's over in east
Tennessee somewhere.' "</TE>
<TE>   Nowadays, the term is just as likely to evoke images of natural
beauty and a bygone simplicity, Eller said. And when there's federal
money to be had, what's in a name?</TE>
<TE>   Since 1965, the word "Appalachia" has meant more than $8 billion
in additional federal spending to member counties--almost $5.5
billion of it for isolation-busting highways. This year, Congress
reauthorized the agency for an unprecedented five years, with a
recommendation that funding for non-highway projects such as Internet
access and entrepreneurship programs be increased by $10 million.</TE>
<TE>   Back when the commission's map was being drawn, Rockbridge County
in southwest Virginia was reluctant to take part. With its horse
farms and Civil War connections, it felt more like the Shenandoah
Valley than Butcher Hollow, said David Kleppinger, executive director
of the Rockbridge Partnership, a local economic development agency.</TE>
<TE>   Rockbridge was one of the counties added to the region in 1998.
Now that he's looking for money to build a regional sewage treatment
plant to keep a local textile operation, Kleppinger doesn't consider
the change "a stigmatizing event."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a different time," he said. "And a different place."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in Kentucky, little Nicholas County's pleas to join the
commission have yet to bear fruit.</TE>
<TE>   The county of 7,000 residents just east of Lexington's bluegrass
country recently lost a sewing plant and 326 jobs. Mayor Ronnie Clark
says he'd gladly put up with a little ribbing if it meant money for
sewerage or an expanded industrial park.</TE>
<TE>   Amy Glasmeier, a former John D. Whisman Appalachian Regional
Scholar at Penn State, has studied Appalachia's ebbs and flows over
the years. She says the slow expansion of the commission and a static
budget mean more counties are vying for pieces of the same-size pie.</TE>
<TE>   "It's funny," she said. "They can add but they can't subtract."</TE>
<TE>   The irony of the Delta and Appalachian regions' overlapping--at
least bureaucratically--is not lost on Glasmeier. Years ago, the two
regions were similarly impoverished.</TE>
<TE>   "Now they're very far apart," she said. "Standards of living,
quality of life, levels of education, square miles of road--you name
it, the Delta is still way behind."</TE>
<TE>   The Delta Regional Authority was created to address those
problems. In the planning stages since Bill Clinton was governor of
Arkansas, it is just now poised to spread $27 million to the 240
counties and parishes in its eight-state region. (Oddly, the DRA has
adopted five other Mississippi counties and three in Alabama that
were ARC turf, so they presumably could double dip.)</TE>
<TE>   Now, Montgomery County, Miss., is pretty much hill country, most
would agree. But Panola County--that's another story.</TE>
<TE>   "I bet it ain't 5% of the people in Panola County know what you're
talking about if you said Appalachia," said Tommy McCullar, a
Batesville businessman. "My first cousin is the governor of our
state, and I don't think he'd even know what you're talking about."</TE>
<TE>   McCullar owns Delta Tractor &amp; Picker. He doesn't anticipate a
corporate name change anytime soon.</TE>

<HD>For N. Korea's Kim, Actions Fall Silent to Proverbs</HD>
<DH>Asia: Nation that cannot feed itself without foreign aid
twists old sayings in its cold war with capitalism, casting itself as
powerful.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANG-HUN CHOE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>SEOUL -- North Korea has a huge army on its side of the demilitarized
zone, but also it wages its cold war with the South and its U.S.
patron with words. And often its weapon of choice is proverbs.</LD>
<LD>   A puppy challenging a tiger. A tortoise picking a fight with a
dragon. And a mutt yapping at a caravan passing through a village.
All are characters in centuries-old Korean proverbs that belittle
those who take up a challenge beyond their means.</LD>
<LD>   But North Korea -- so poor it cannot feed its people without
foreign aid -- flips their meaning. In describing its relationship to
the United States, the insular communist state casts itself as the
tiger and the dragon, while the superpower is the puppy and the
tortoise.</LD>
<TE>   While North Korea's state-run media carry Cold War-era references
to "flunkyist reactionaries" and "imperialist warmaniacs," they also
draw on proverbs and idioms that were around long before Marxism came
to Korea in the 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   When President Bush labeled North Korea part of an "axis of evil"
with Iran and Iraq in January, the regime in Pyongyang ridiculed the
American leader as a "puppy knowing no fear of the tiger."</TE>
<TE>   That phrase comes from a Korean proverb: "A one-year-old puppy
doesn't fear the tiger." An equivalent expression in English is,
"Fools rush in where angels fear to tread."</TE>
<TE>   North Korea churns out tough rhetoric daily through the Korean
Central News Agency, its mouthpiece to the outside world. The
combativeness of the North's statements cycles up and down with the
political mood on the Korean peninsula, but colorful language is a
constant in KCNA's English-language statements.</TE>
<TE>   It compares U.S. troops in joint military exercises with South
Korea to "fools rushing into a fire with hay bundles on their backs."
It condemns American "imperialist aggressors" by citing an old
proverb: "The village is never safe as long as rabid dogs are running
amok in the neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   Taking a shot at Japan, the former colonial occupier of the
peninsula, North Korea often says: "No matter how hard it tries, a
crow can never become a pigeon."</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, when negotiators from the two Koreas met to arrange a
historic inter-Korean summit for the following year, smiling North
Korean delegates started off the talks with proverbs.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't fill our stomach with the first spoon, but we must
remember that a thousand-mile journey starts with the first step,"
they said, mixing their metaphors.</TE>
<TE>   Proverbs also are used in messages to North Koreans, who have had
a tough time the past decade as floods and drought devastated farming
and brought on a famine that killed hundreds of thousands.</TE>
<TE>   Northern newspaper commentaries and school textbooks often cite
old expressions applauding the tenacity and daring of the underdog,
says South Korea's Yonhap News Agency, which monitors North Korean
news media.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea, for example, praises itself as "an ant trying to
topple an oak tree," the tree being the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Ordinary North Koreans are so isolated from the outside world
that they don't realize how unrealistic these analogies are," said
Kim Seung-cheul, a North Korean defector who is an analyst at Seoul's
Institute of North Korea Studies.</TE>
<TE>   North Korean President Kim Jong Il, who inherited power and a
personality cult from his late father, Kim Il Sung, is officially his
country's language maven.</TE>
<TE>   "Proverbs are a convenient national heritage we can use to scoff
at the enemy," Kim was quoted as saying by South Korea's National
Intelligence Service.</TE>
<TE>   Kim apparently inherited his flair for language from his father,
who is credited with saying: "Capitalism is like weeds growing
through the cracks of the pavement. Wherever there is a hole, it
raises its ugly head."</TE>

<HD>Brain Disease Threatens Elk-Ranching Industry</HD>
<DH>Economics: Some Western ranchers are persevering despite
fears of an epidemic. Others have taken government buyouts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUDITH KOHLER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>FORT COLLINS, Colo.</DL>
<LD>Ric and Myrna Hansen became elk ranchers three years ago so they
could raise animals without having to kill them.</LD>
<LD>   So it wasn't a hard decision to turn down a recent buyout offer
from the U.S. Agriculture Department. To accept would have been to
condemn their 700-head herd to slaughter as officials try to stop a
deadly deer and elk disease.</LD>
<LD>   The Hansens, who raise elk as breeding stock, concede that their
decision is risky. The offer was a one-time deal, and they could be
left without a way to recoup a $400,000-plus investment because their
ranch east of Fort Collins is in Colorado's ground zero for chronic
wasting disease.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a big gamble," said Ric Hansen as he walked into a corral
full of bull elk, all warily eyeing the strangers with him.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really attached to all of them," said Myrna Hansen, rubbing
the head of Theo, a young bull the family raised from a calf. "But we
can't just have them as pets forever."</TE>
<TE>   The Hansens and another rancher are the only ones of about 20 in
the disease endemic area who refused the government buyout. It was
offered after a case of chronic wasting disease at an elk ranch
raised fears of an epidemic because the rancher had shipped animals
to other ranches in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the devastation, the industry will persevere, predicted
Ron Walker, president of the Colorado and national elk breeders'
associations.</TE>
<TE>   He believes the attention and push for federal research funding
will lead to a live test for elk so they don't have to be killed to
determine if they are infected.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a bad thing that could be good," Walker said.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, the disease has been found in wild deer and elk herds
in northeastern Colorado and southeastern Wyoming. As the illness
eats holes in the animal's brain, the creature becomes emaciated and
dies.</TE>
<TE>   There's a live test for some deer, but it's time-consuming and
difficult.</TE>
<TE>   About 2,900 captive elk have been killed to try to stem the
disease. Some were from ranches in the endemic area, where experts
fear wildlife and captive elk can infect each other.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado's elk industry generates $30 million a year through the
sale of antlers, meat and breeding stock, and ranch hunting. It is
the second-largest elk industry in the country, behind Minnesota's.
There were about 160 licensed elk ranches at the start of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The Hansens, whose ranch is disease-free, can sell antlers for
natural-food supplements but cannot sell breeding stock because of a
mandatory 60-month surveillance period for elk herds.</TE>
<TE>   The family can hold on for a while because Ric Hansen's real
estate business provides most of their income.</TE>
<TE>   But they and other ranchers believe they have been blamed unfairly
for the outbreak. They point to Colorado Division of Wildlife reports
saying biologists first noticed the disease in deer in state research
facilities in 1967 and in Wyoming research facilities in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't tell us we started it," said Walker, who raises elk
near Penrose in south-central Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of elk ranching lament this spring's revelation of the
first cases in the wild west of the Continental Divide. Two deer
inadvertently penned inside an elk ranch near Craig were infected.</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife advocates fear the impact on the state's
multimillion-dollar big-game hunting industry.</TE>
<TE>   Wyoming banned game ranches 30 years ago because of concerns about
diseases and the impact on wildlife. Montana voters approved a ban in
2000 for some of the same reasons.</TE>
<TE>   John Mumma, a retired state wildlife chief, said elk ranches might
be breeding grounds and conduits for chronic wasting disease and
other illnesses as animals congregate and get moved around.</TE>
<TE>   He fears captive herds are endangering Colorado's wildlife. "I
think this a threat that goes beyond our imagining right now."</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1980s, the illness has been found in free-roaming elk
and deer in northeastern Colorado and southeastern Wyoming. It was
the only place it was found in the wild until this year's outbreak
among deer in Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   Walker and other ranchers fear wild animals are infecting captive
animals. He also is concerned about the impact of negative publicity
on the industry, which has been fed by the disease's link to mad cow
disease.</TE>
<TE>   Chronic wasting disease is in the same family as bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, or mad-cow disease.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Miller, wildlife division veterinarian, said the strain of
misfolded protein, or prion, that appears to cause wasting disease is
quite different from the one that causes mad cow disease.</TE>
<TE>   There is no evidence that chronic wasting disease can be
transmitted to cattle or people, although scientists cannot rule it
out.</TE>
<TE>   Experts insist no one can say who is to blame for the spread of
the disease.</TE>
<TE>   "It's trying to re-create history that can't reliably be
reconstructed," Miller said. "It's all so intertwined."</TE>
<TE>   The disease has now been discovered in wild or captive deer and
elk in Colorado, Wisconsin, Wyoming, Kansas, Nebraska, Montana,
Oklahoma and South Dakota and two Canadian provinces.</TE>
<TE>   In Wisconsin, game ranches don't appear to factor in the outbreak,
Miller said. In southwest South Dakota and northwest Nebraska, game
ranches are believed to be the source of chronic wasting disease
recently found in the wild.</TE>
<TE>   State Agriculture Commissioner Don Ament fears the worst for elk
ranching.</TE>
<TE>   "The hysteria that's out there, ranchers can't sell anything,
can't sell meat," Ament said. "How are we going to keep these guys in
business?"</TE>

<HD>A New Era in Charting Wildfires in Alaska</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RACHEL D'ORO</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>McGRATH, Alaska</DL>
<LD>The Cessna 208 Caravan circled the charred landscape for a closer
look at lingering plumes of smoke. Sketchy reports had an old cabin
burning at this particular spot during a wildfire in Alaska's western
interior.</LD>
<LD>   "I'd like to find some trace to confirm it," Dane Crowley said as
the single-engine plane passed a small smoldering rim of the Colorado
Creek fire about 245 miles northwest of Anchorage. A dark smudge
stood out among the patches of black spruce that remained standing.
Could this be what was left of the cabin?</LD>
<LD>   Guided by the aircraft's global positioning system, Crowley noted
the location and marked it on a map he'd been developing for days as
a fire-detection specialist with the state Division of Forestry.</LD>
<TE>   Each fire season, such maps are created from flyovers in small
planes and helicopters. They document Alaska wildfires and help fire
managers develop combat strategies for ground and air crews.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes air crews use portable infrared equipment to identify
hot spots. But for the most part, mapping Alaska wildfires depends
more on experience and observations than on fancy instruments.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be low tech, but it's not low skill," said Andy Williams
with the Alaska Interagency Coordination Center. "It takes a certain
amount of ability to read maps, recognize terrain features and judge
fire behavior to accurately map a fire."</TE>
<TE>   Crowley, a 12-year state firefighter, maps interior wildfires,
including the one at Colorado Creek and the 132,000-acre Vinasale
fire near McGrath.</TE>
<TE>   The Vinasale fire was accidentally started in late May by state
biologists using firecracker shotgun shells to scare off an
aggressive moose.</TE>
<TE>   While Crowley is not in direct combat with Alaska's wildfires, he
considers the work just as crucial.</TE>
<TE>   "If I blow this job, it makes it difficult for the people on the
ground," he said during an earlier flyover in the Caravan.</TE>
<TE>   Soaring 2,500 feet over the vast region, Crowley was on the
lookout for smoke, flames and burned structures, including the smudge
at Colorado Creek that ground crews later confirmed was the remains
of a cabin. Crowley knew the layout well and recognized where fires
were advancing or dying out.</TE>
<TE>   Once in a while he noted an area worth checking out and asked
pilot Bryce Alber to circleagain.</TE>
<TE>   On this day, the fires looked mostly dormant, except for
occasional smoke and smoldering lines. But shifting weather can
recharge fires, which tend to burn in mosaic patterns, leaving behind
spotty expanses of live trees. That's why it's so crucial to monitor
fires, whether or not they are being fought, fire officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Crowley pointed out a large cumulus cloud hovering over a smoky
area. "It's a convective cloud, indicative of lightning," he said.
"That's a pretty big cell there, at least 10,000 feet in height. A
cloud like that hangs down over an active fire and creates wind that
stirs things up."</TE>
<TE>   Back at the McGrath base camp, Crowley documented each of the nine
fires monitored that day. The reports and updated maps are stored in
files that are available to crews. "I include information I would
want to know as a firefighter," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That information may include the obvious, such as latitude and
longitude, weather conditions and the kind of vegetation being
burned. Crowley also notes wind speed and direction, topography and
natural barriers like rivers as well as the fire's behavior --
whether it's smoldering, creeping, crowning or flaming.</TE>
<TE>   "We're building on knowledge every day," Crowley said. "This lets
you really see the changes."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the information is added to maps produced by infrared
scanners. Infrared is capable of tracking hot spots even through
dense smoke, but it has limits. It can't see through clouds, rain or
extreme humidity. And it picks up terrain features better in the
dark, said Jose Lopez, an electronics technician. "The clouds were a
constant challenge in Alaska," he said. "And it never really got
dark."</TE>
<TE>   Another challenge in Alaska is developing computer fire prediction
and mapping technologies effective for remote wildfires. Currently
the Division of Forestry teams with local governments to calculate
risk factors and forecast the likely path of fires.</TE>
<TE>   "The firefighting community is in transition in using some of
these newer tools," he said. "We're seeing almost an explosion. I
think the old days of sketching maps with crude reference points is
going away."</TE>

<HD>Andersen Trial Yields Evidence in Enron Case</HD>
<DH>Probe: Prosecutors may use testimony from accounting firm's
staff to show the energy trader took an aggressive approach to its
books.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Testimony detailing how Enron Corp. bullied its outside auditors into
signing off on dubious transactions could play a key role in expected
prosecutions of former Enron executives, legal experts say.</LD>
<LD>   Testimony from Arthur Andersen accountants at the accounting
firm's six-week trial provided new details about how Enron
aggressively pushed the firm to see things its way, even if it meant
ignoring potentially massive accounting errors and violating
Andersen's procedures.</LD>
<LD>   The testimony of Andersen accountants "sets the stage for
portraying Enron as a very aggressive corporation whose credo seemed
to be to press the outer edges of what was considered acceptable
accounting practices," said Robert Mintz, a former federal prosecutor
who specializes in white-collar crime cases.</LD>
<TE>   Andersen was convicted June 15 of obstruction of justice in
connection with its audit of Enron. During the trial, prosecutors
argued that Andersen's lax treatment of Enron resulted in potential
legal liability and provided the accounting firm with a motive to
dispose of potentially incriminating documents and impede a
Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department investigators now are concentrating on Enron
and its use of off-the-books partnerships that prevented investors
from getting a true picture of the company's financial condition.</TE>
<TE>   Enron officials are expected to say they relied on Andersen's
advice to keep them in compliance with accounting standards.</TE>
<TE>   But the Andersen accountants' testimony in Houston could blunt
that defense. Prosecutors can point to the accountants' testimony to
show that Enron took a push-the-envelope approach to its books and
knew that Andersen's approval came under pressure.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Patricia Grutzmacher, an accountant on Andersen's
Houston-based team of Enron auditors, testified that a top Enron
executive had tried to have her and another mid-level accountant
removed from audits of Enron's capital-management division because
she wouldn't sign off on Enron's proposed accounting treatment on
certain transactions.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like, if you didn't act a certain way sometimes ... it
could jeopardize your existence on the Enron engagement," she
testified.</TE>
<TE>   Grutzmacher and another mid-level accountant, Jennifer Stevenson,
testified that they discovered serious potential flaws in the
handling of one of Enron's off-the-books partnerships called Merlin.
Grutzmacher said Enron reimbursed investors who lost money in the
partnership even though the value of Merlin's underlying assets had
plummeted.</TE>
<TE>   She said she was told the decision to reimburse the
investors--which included another entity controlled by then-Chief
Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow--was made by senior Enron
executives. She said the executives told Andersen they decided to pay
the investors to avert lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   But the reimbursement would indicate that Merlin investors had no
real money at stake, meaning that they did not qualify as independent
outside stakeholders. Under accounting rules, that meant Merlin could
not be treated separately and that its losses must be consolidated
with Enron's finances.</TE>
<TE>   Grutzmacher said she objected to Enron's treatment of the entity
but was overruled by senior partners on the audit team, including
David B. Duncan, the lead auditor who pleaded guilty in April to a
separate charge of obstruction.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors described Duncan as a "client advocate" and suggested
that he sided with Enron against his firm's technical accounting
experts to keep Enron as a customer.</TE>
<TE>   For example, testimony showed that in the fall of 2000, Enron
proposed a method to help it conceal hundreds of millions of dollars
in losses by four off-balance-sheet entities known as Raptors. Duncan
proposed letting Enron account for the four Raptors' financial
results together, allowing profits from two stronger Raptors to cover
losses from the weaker ones.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Neuhausen, a member of the technical accounting unit, said
experts in his division concluded that the technique didn't comply
with standards requiring such entities to report separately. Duncan's
team ignored the advice and allowed Enron to hide the losses with
another dubious method without informing the experts.</TE>
<TE>   But the technical team didn't learn that its advice had been
ignored until months later, after the Raptor losses had mounted and
Enron decided to unwind the partnerships. The expert group saw, for
the first time, memos in which Duncan mischaracterized their advice,
saying the technical team had agreed with Enron's view.</TE>
<TE>   Carl Bass, another member of the technical team, told jurors he
advised that an Enron plan to book profit from a defunct partnership
with video-rental chain Blockbuster Inc. appeared ill-advised. The
deal, in which Blockbuster would provide movies to be transmitted
through Enron's fiber-optic network, never got off the ground, and
Bass suggested the operation was too small to count as a real
business. But Andersen--despite Bass' objection--let Enron record a
$110.9-million gain from selling a piece of its share in the venture.</TE>
<TE>   A short time later, Andersen--at Enron's request--removed Bass
from reviewing Enron's finances. Enron believed Bass had raised too
many questions about the transactions, Andersen executives testified.</TE>
<TE>   John Stewart, the senior accountant on the specialist team,
testified that Enron's request struck him as "unprofessional" and
that he was "upset" with his employer for caving in to the demand.</TE>
<TE>   "We should have told them 'no,' and been more independent,"
Stewart said.</TE>

<HD>Too Much, Too Soon for Telecom</HD>
<DH>Survey: The problems of WorldCom and other firms have wiped
out more than 400,000 jobs and obliterated trillions in shareholder
wealth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN KAPLAN and JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From 1996 to 2001, the telecommunications industry spent nearly half
a trillion dollars building a monumental high-tech network to ferry
phone calls, e-mail and faxes around the world at the speed of light.</LD>
<LD>   But that investment--roughly twice what the federal government
spent on the interstate highway system over the last 50 years--turned
out to be a far bigger bust than anyone expected.</LD>
<LD>   And the nearly $300 billion in debt that piled up during this
dramatic build-out is wrapped like an anchor around the neck of the
sinking telecom industry as it suffers one of the most dramatic
collapses in U.S. corporate history.</LD>
<TE>   The meltdown was punctuated last week with a fraud lawsuit filed
by the Securities and Exchange Commission accusing long-distance
provider WorldCom Inc. of improper accounting that masked its true
health. In January, telecom network builder Global Crossing Ltd.
filed the fourth-largest bankruptcy case in U.S. history. Firms such
as AT&amp;T Corp. and Qwest Communications International Inc. remain on
shaky ground.</TE>
<TE>   The total cost of this wipeout--to investors, consumers and
taxpayers--may not be clear for years. But "we're looking minimally
at several hundred billion dollars of real investment that has gone
south," said Lee Selwyn, president of Economics &amp; Technology Inc., a
telecom consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   A Times analysis of six years worth of financial statements of 116
telecom companies reveals an industry that spent furiously to exploit
new technology and capitalize on the rising appetite for voice and
data traffic. But it built too much too quickly, and demand is years
from catching up with supply. The result is an industrywide implosion
that has wiped out more than 400,000 jobs and obliterated trillions
in shareholder wealth.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers tell the tale:</TE>
<TE>   * The industry devoted more than $444 billion to capital
expenditures from 1996 to 2001. On average, companies spent more than
$3.8 billion each on long-term assets such as factories to build
equipment and communications networks. By comparison, $3.8 billion
could fund National Park Service operations for almost 2 1/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   *  Investors threw $49 billion at start-ups through venture
capital firms and public stock offerings.</TE>
<TE>   * Telecom companies' return on their capital investment has been
dismal. In 2001 the average was a negative 82.8%. That's like
spending a dollar to end up with 17 cents.</TE>
<TE>   * Trillions of dollars of telecom companies' market value has
vanished  since 2000.</TE>
<TE>   * Industry debt ballooned throughout the late 1990s, growing at
double-digit rates before peaking at $306 billion in 2000. Much of it
may never be repaid.</TE>
<TE>   Much of this spending and speculation was fueled by the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, a landmark reform that opened up
markets, such as local and long-distance phone service, to greater
competition. At the same time, new technology was making it possible
for start-ups to challenge entrenched companies.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning of an Era</TE>
<TE>   Taken together, these developments created a gold-rush mentality
among entrepreneurs and investors who believed they were witnessing
the birth of a new era. The opportunities seemed limitless, and the
massive hype obscured the true risks.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time there's great changes in the society--like with
railroads in the early 1890s or the auto industry--you saw a lot of
investment being thrown at new industries, and then there was a
shakeout," said James Alleman, a visiting associate professor at
Columbia Business School in New York. "That's a nice analogy with
what's going on today with telecom. Everybody was trying to get in
and find the gold. Some will and most won't."</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say the investments were a total loss. Some
observers, such as Johannes Bauer, associate director of the James H.
and Mary B. Quello Center for Telecommunication Management and Law at
Michigan State University, believe that profit motives will persuade
companies to find a productive use for all the excess network
capacity, or bandwidth, built during the boom.</TE>
<TE>   "The networks are not lost," Bauer said. "These are assets that
are still available. Someone will come in and buy them cheaper, and
it will very likely benefit the public in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "If they can be reutilized in the next year or two, then the
physical losses will be fairly limited. But those who bought at high
stock prices and then lost money in the process--that money is
probably unrecoverable."</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the telecom revolution were the entrepreneurs with
long-shot dreams and the venture capitalists who financed them. The
number of venture-backed start-ups focused on building equipment and
networks grew from 30 in 1996 to 42 in 1997 and then spiked to 62 a
year later, according to the PricewaterhouseCoopers/Venture
Economics/National Venture Capital Assn. Money Tree Survey.</TE>
<TE>   Deal-making remained active until last year, after the telecom
meltdown was in full swing. In 2001, 34 telecom companies received
venture-capital funding, according to the survey. Altogether, venture
capital firms invested $4.9 billion in these telecom firms, including
$2.2 billion in 2000 alone.</TE>
<TE>   Tapping Public Markets</TE>
<TE>   But that was just seed money. The start-ups that flourished tapped
the public markets for additional capital by selling shares to
outside investors through initial public offerings, or IPOs, and
secondary offerings.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, when the telecom renaissance was taking hold, telecom
firms raised $4.2 billion through public stock sales. By 2000, the
amount had grown to $18.1 billion, before falling off to $4.8 billion
last year. Altogether, companies in the sector culled more than $44
billion from public offerings, according to SEC filings.</TE>
<TE>   Some young firms were particularly adept at tapping the public
markets. Level 3 Communications Inc., now on the brink of a
bankruptcy filing, raised more than $3.5 billion this way, including
nearly $2.2 billion in a single offering in February 2000. Other
upstarts raised more than $1 billion each from the public markets,
including Allegiance Telecom Inc., Focal Communications Corp., Time
Warner Telecom Inc., Ciena Corp., Corvis Corp., Juniper Networks Inc.
and Sycamore Networks Inc.</TE>
<TE>   For a time, market capitalizations swelled for these companies.
Savvy investors who sold their shares when they were valuable were
richly rewarded. Global Crossing founder and Chairman Gary Winnick,
for instance, made a profit of $577.9 million selling company shares
before the firm filed for bankruptcy protection in January.</TE>
<TE>   But most investors didn't recognize the peak when it came, and
they held on to their stock as share prices tumbled further. By
September, the 10 leading telecom equipment suppliers' shares had
fallen 90% from their peak values, said Susan Kalla, senior
technology analyst for Friedman Billings Ramsey, an investment house.</TE>
<TE>   Among the hardest hit were employees of telecom companies, whose
faith in their work convinced them to hold on long past the point
where they should have cashed out. Some workers also saw their 401(k)
accounts wiped out because they built their retirement funds on
company stock.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the money raised in public markets was used to pay for
routine business expenses such as salaries, marketing and rent. But
perhaps the most important outlays for telecom companies were capital
expenditures.</TE>
<TE>   The capital spending accelerated as the 1990s drew to a close. In
1999, the companies invested $81.2 billion in capital equipment. The
next year, that figure grew 40%, reaching $113.9 billion. The
spending started to ease in 2001, but still totaled $97.3 billion for
the year, even after the wave of bankruptcy filings had begun.</TE>
<TE>   Few Positive Returns</TE>
<TE>   The heftiest capital spending came from traditional carriers such
as AT&amp;T, SBC Communications Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. But
among the top 15 spenders were upstarts Qwest ($24 billion over five
years), Level 3 ($12.5 billion), Global Crossing ($7.2 billion) and
Williams Communications Group Inc. ($6.9 billion).</TE>
<TE>   Only half a dozen companies generated a positive return on their
massive investments over the six-year period, according to figures
compiled by The Times. The only start-ups among them were telecom
equipment maker Advanced Fibre Communications Inc., which recorded a
3% return on investment, and Comverse Technology Inc., a maker of
telephone messaging systems that scored a 2.4% return.</TE>
<TE>   More typical was StockerYale Inc., a Salem, N.H.-based firm that
makes specialty optical fiber and optical networking components. From
1996 to 2001, StockerYale's return on investment was negative 37.5%,
just slightly below the median for the firms analyzed by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   That's still far better than the performance logged by New Visual
Corp., which is developing technology to increase the data-carrying
capacity of copper phone lines. Its six-year return on investment was
negative 1,047%. Even worse was Mphase Technologies Inc., which is
developing similar technology. Its six-year return was negative
1,171%.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue from product sales helped fund some of this spending. But
most of it was financed by debt.</TE>
<TE>   Money Not Wasted</TE>
<TE>   Debt levels for telecom firms soared in the late 1990s, according
to a Times analysis of SEC filings. Total debt ballooned from $9
billion in 1996 to $127.3 billion in 1997, then continued to expand
until 2000, when it reached $306.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   As the number of bankruptcy filings continues to grow, so does the
amount of debt that probably will never be repaid. But few analysts
believe that all of the money was wasted.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Morris, director of Northwestern University's Program in
Telecommunications Science, Management and Policy, predicts demand
for the extra bandwidth will spike once someone figures out how to
bring faster Internet connections to homes.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be sopped up like a sponge because the consumer has an
insatiable appetite for entertainment and information," Morris said.
"Overcapacity is a temporary problem. The consumer will save
telecom."</TE>
<TE>   Even some of the money that wasn't used to build infrastructure
had a lasting effect on the economy, said Kalla, the Friedman
Billings Ramsey analyst who is an expert on telecom equipment
companies.</TE>
<TE>   "What you did was, you employed people," she said. "And they, in
turn, spent on houses....There was more than just laying cable. You
trained all these people, so they have skills. You can make the
argument that they fueled the 5% GDP growth, so it's not all waste."</TE>
<TE>   Still, it seems the private sector's massive investment in telecom
was far less productive than the $329 billion that federal, state and
local governments spent to construct the 45,025 miles of interstate
highways that crisscross the country.</TE>
<TE>   According to a report prepared for the American Highway Users
Alliance, every dollar invested in the highway system has generated
more than $6 in economic benefit.</TE>
<TE>   Selwyn, of Economics &amp;Technology Inc., said some waste is
unavoidable when an industry is beset by rapid change.</TE>
<TE>   "Every single industry at some point in its history has gone
through a period of rapid expansion, with multiple entries and
multiple failures," he said. "That's to be expected. No one believes
that we're going to see as many survivors as there were entrants."</TE>
<TE>   Who will pay the price?</TE>
<TE>   "We all do, in a sense," Selwyn said. "When you have a major
sector of the economy sucking up resources, it means resources are
being diverted from other places. That forces prices up, it forces
professional salaries up, and when that falls apart, we all pay."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   METHODOLOGY</TE>
<TE>   The Times examined public companies that described themselves as
providers of telephone or communications services or equipment.
Companies that focused on the mobile-phone industry or had their
primary operations outside North America were excluded. The findings
in this story are based on audited numbers reported to the Securities
and Exchange Commission.</TE>

<HD>Port Issues Go Far Beyond Labor Dispute</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The issues and challenges facing international trade in Southern
California go far beyond the shipping lines and dockworkers squaring
off at the bargaining table this weekend.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles-Long Beach port complex is a key link in the
global economy. And it's a cornerstone of Southern California's
largest industry--international trade, which accounts for an
estimated 450,000 jobs in the region.</LD>
<LD>   But the ports are challenged. Unless they modernize, the great
trade-based industry that has grown up here--with $220 billion of
goods moving through Los Angeles-Long Beach this year--will seize up
within a few years. Diminishing returns will set in, business will go
elsewhere or not be done, and a region's destiny will be denied.</LD>
<TE>   Moreover, shipping line managers and labor leaders are not the
only parties with major stakes in the matter. The communities
adjacent to the ports have major grievances about pollution and
disruption from the ports' outdated operations, including long lines
of backed-up trucks. Those communities will pass laws aimed at
correcting problems and extending the ports' working hours to relieve
congestion.</TE>
<TE>   The ports' customers--major retailers and automobile companies,
and other businesses that rely on the ports for their products and
livelihoods--are fed up with the lack of efficient service. And those
customers also will have a say in the ports' future operations.</TE>
<TE>   The economies of California, the United States and Asian and Latin
American countries have major stakes in the future of the West Coast
ports. Ultimately, national and international forces will determine
the future of trade</TE>
<TE>   in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   To understand what must be done to improve such vital assets, it's
a good idea to look at all that has been done in recent decades.</TE>
<TE>   Tens of billions of dollars in federal- and state-financed capital
expenditures on waterways, docks and cranes and rail links such as
the Alameda Corridor have transformed local import-export operations
into a cog in the massive production and distribution system that
extends from factories in Asia to the shelves of Wal-Mart, Target and
Home Depot stores and the auto plants in Tennessee, Indiana and
Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   The ports have become critical. If they were to be shut by a
strike in coming weeks--which undoubtedly they won't be for many
reasons--that could spark a "crisis in Asian currencies and U.S.
financial markets," says economist Stephen Cohen, a trade expert at
UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Yet for all their importance and the public money spent on them,
the ports continue to be operated like a lemonade stand. Companies
that have operations around the world say the Los Angeles-Long Beach
ports are way behind those of Asia and Europe.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California's ports, computerization is antediluvian.
Clerks manually reenter computerized information from other parts of
the world.</TE>
<TE>   And terminals bid a little extra in cash payments to get the best
union crane operators and stevedore crews to work their vessels.</TE>
<TE>   In a 24-hour world, the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports work an
eight-hour day, causing congestion on highways and delays in goods
delivery.</TE>
<TE>   Customers are denied basic information about the time or even date
of delivery of their shipments.</TE>
<TE>   "Why is it that FedEx and UPS can give me the location of the
tiniest package, but I can't be told the location of a 20-foot
container?" says a warehouse operator who asked not to be named for
fear of the union.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very frustrating to be sending trucks to wait hours at the
ports with no certainty of delivery times," says Charles Woo, head of
Megatoys Inc., an importing firm that helped spark the growth of a
major toy industry in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Incredibly, both the shipping lines that own the terminals and the
unions that operate them disclaim responsibility for the congestion
caused trucks waiting at portside and for the resulting delays and
pollution.</TE>
<TE>   The attitude is galling to neighboring communities.</TE>
<TE>   "They think they own the coast, but they don't. They only rent
it," says Richard Hollingsworth, president of the Gateway Cities
Partnership, an economic development effort of 27 cities in the
vicinity of the Long Beach and Los Angeles ports, including Long
Beach, South Gate and Lakewood.</TE>
<TE>   Such amateur operations cannot continue.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Los Angeles-Long Beach ports continue to operate as
they're now doing, they will run out of capacity in three to four
years," says John Vickerman, president of Transystems Corp., a firm
that designs port facilities nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   More to the point, such operations won't be allowed to continue.
Assemblyman Alan Lowenthal (D-Long Beach) has introduced a bill that
would impose penalties on trucks that wait in line too long at the
ports, with idling engines polluting the air. The bill, almost
certain to be passed, would demand appointments for trucks to pick up
and deliver their cargoes.</TE>
<TE>   Federal legislation on homeland security, which is even more sure
of passage, would require identification cards for all transportation
workers, including truckers. Security legislation would change the
ways trucks, gates and terminals are administered at the ports.</TE>
<TE>   Other solutions are emerging from discussions in the last four
years under the auspices of the Center for International Trade and
Transportation at Cal State Long Beach. Marianne Venieris, head of
the center, has brought together unions, terminal owners, trucking
and warehouse companies, community representatives and other
stakeholders in the trade industry. Some sensible changes have been
suggested.</TE>
<TE>   Longer hours probably will be implemented, although the ports
won't go to a round-the-clock operation soon because of objections
from neighboring communities. However, additional shifts from 3 to 8
a.m., or 6 to 10 p.m., are being considered for the ports as well as
warehouses throughout the South Bay. Such non-peak work would relieve
congestion on roads and freeways, particularly the badly overloaded
Long Beach Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   For all the rhetoric about technology in the current labor
negotiations, information systems undoubtedly will be upgraded at the
ports--with a strong union say in their operation. International
Longshore and Warehouse Union President James Spinosa and other union
officials have been receiving counseling from Vickerman of
Transystems on the implications of technological advances.</TE>
<TE>   The ILWU is a union with a tradition of adapting to technology.
Legendary ILWU leader Harry Bridges made a landmark agreement in 1960
that allowed containers at West Coast ports, predicting--against the
opinions of most members--that technological advances would lead to
expansion of trade and more jobs. And Bridges was right.</TE>
<TE>   Today the Los Angeles-Long Beach trade complex could be at the
dawn of new decades of headlong growth. Port administrators project
5% to 6% growth of business, and Vickerman predicts a quadrupling of
trade through the two ports by 2020.</TE>
<TE>   Such projections assume that the world economy keeps growing and
the U.S. continues as the prime market for most of the world.</TE>
<TE>   And the projections correctly assume there won't be a ruinous
strike in the coming weeks. Neither union nor management is talking
about a strike or a lockout. The shipping lines can't afford to have
ships idle. The retail concerns want the goods for the fall and
holiday shopping seasons. And because of the economic importance of
the Los Angeles-Long Beach trade complex, the U.S. government almost
certainly would step in to impose mediation.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California in a decade or two has become one of the
world's great port complexes. It is time it lived up to such status.</TE>

<HD>Adelphia's Increase in Rates Grates</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The day Adelphia Communications Corp. filed for bankruptcy
protection, I received my monthly bill from the company for cable
service ["Adelphia Submits Bankruptcy Filing," June 26].</LD>
<LD>   Under "Important News About Your Cable Services," the bill listed
new rate information. This listing compared the new prices,
commencing next month, with the current prices.</LD>
<LD>   Guess what--the new prices are all higher than the current ones.
The price increases range from 3% to more than 33%. I guess we're one
of the fortunate ones--our bill will go up by approximately 6%.</LD>
<TE>   Amazing timing. Do you think the increases are to provide "golden
parachutes" for the outgoing management (having performed such a
stellar job) or to "sweeten" the pot for any prospective bidders for
the remains of the company?</TE>
<TE>   Jack Frisch</TE>
<TE>   Manhattan Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wasn't it just a year or so ago that Adelphia spokesman Paul
Heimel told us Adelphia was blocking its subscribers' access to adult
films because of the "small-town values" of its owners, the Rigas
family?</TE>
<TE>   "They don't believe in chasing the almighty buck at the sacrifice
of your personal values," Heimel said.</TE>
<TE>   While I'm as entertained as anyone by the sight of hypocrites
being flattened by a few tons of irony, I still feel bad for the
stockholders whose investments were pillaged under the guise of
"family values."</TE>

<LD>James Flanigan had it exactly right when he wrote, "Congress is

thrall to business lobbying and dependent on campaign contributions."
["Andersen Verdict Signals New Government Crackdown," June 18]</LD>
<LD>   However, the rest of the thrust of his article is too rosy. He
claims that a more vigilant executive branch will curb the dishonest
behavior and cheating. Wrong!</LD>
<LD>   The executive branch is just as much in thrall to the same
interests, if not more so. Witness the "Last Hurrah for Big 'Soft'
Spenders?" [June 19].</LD>
<TE>   By blocking reform legislation, the accounting profession will
continue its double-dipping arrangement with CEOs so their integrity

reality. Only strong congressional action can restore the confidence

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Recording Industry Assn. of America never fails to amaze ["Net
Radio, Labels at Odds Over Royalties," June 24].</LD>
<LD>   Their actions are like those of tin-pot dictators, destroying
their country in a desperate attempt to preserve their empire. The
underlying stupidity of their efforts and the unseemly influence and
control that they have purchased politically have never been so well
evidenced as in the current battle over Internet copyright royalties.</LD>
<LD>   They are literally fighting to shut down a phenomenon that allows
many artists (a good percentage of whom they manage) exposure they
would not receive anywhere else. Just as FM radio was a huge shot in
the arm for a stagnant record industry, so too Internet radio easily
could become a huge phenomenon that will allow an hitherto untapped
worldwide audience to be reached.</LD>
<TE>   It is understandable that Clear Channel Communications Inc., XM
Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. and other media conglomerates are
actively lobbying our bought and paid for politicians and
bureaucracies to shut down this burgeoning new media diversity on the
Internet, because it directly threatens their monopolies.</TE>
<TE>   But for the record companies to be at the forefront, leading the
crusade, just shows how incredibly lamebrained and shortsighted these
people really are.</TE>

<LD>Question: I am planning to purchase a home later this year. I
recently paid off my student loans and have no debts whatsoever. I
have three credit cards that I've used for many years. However, I
also carry six department store cards that I haven't used in eight to
10 years. How do I go about closing those accounts? Do I call the
department store or send a letter? I do not want to hurt my credit
rating.</LD>
<LD>   Answer: As long as you don't carry a balance on any of your credit
cards, it shouldn't matter if you close those old accounts. You might
keep the oldest one to help show the longevity of your credit, and
then write the other issuers a letter requesting the accounts be
closed.</LD>
<LD>   Be sure to request that these issuers report to the credit bureaus
that the accounts were closed at the customer's request.</LD>
<TE>   If you do carry a balance, hold off on closing the accounts until
after you get your mortgage. Shutting down a bunch of credit lines
can make your existing balances loom larger in the calculations that
are used to determine your credit score.</TE>
<TE>   Reasons to Hold On to 401(k) Statements</TE>
<TE>   Q: I have a question about saving quarterly statements for 401(k)
and 403(b) accounts. I now have a 3-inch binder full of such
statements from 1984 to the present, representing six different
accounts from different companies that employed me or my wife. Do I
really need to save all this?</TE>
<TE>   A: Crank up your shredder.</TE>
<TE>   You probably won't need any of that historical information unless
you have company stock in your plan or you made after-tax
contributions to your accounts. Withdrawals from 401(k) and 403(b)
plans are typically 100% taxable, so there's no need to keep track of
how much you made or lost on the underlying investments.</TE>
<TE>   If you made after-tax contributions--and not many people
do--you'll want to keep the evidence of how much because those
contributions would be deducted proportionately from your withdrawals
when figuring taxes.</TE>
<TE>   You also might want to keep your old statements if you invested in
company stock. That's because of a special tax rule that allows you
to separate the stock from your other investments when you retire and
to pay taxes based on what you paid for the stock, not what it's
worth today. Any gains are taxed, when you eventually sell, at
capital gains rates, rather than the higher income tax rates that
would apply to other 401(k) withdrawals. You should talk to a tax pro
about the details of this maneuver to see whether it's right for you.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, there's little reason, other than nostalgia, to keep
all your old statements. You might enjoy, for example, looking at
your December 1999 balance, and remembering your wild hopes of early
retirement. Most of us, though, find that kind of thing depressing.</TE>
<TE>   As long as you're simplifying your life, consider consolidating
all those accounts, if you haven't already. You may be able to
transfer the old balances to your current employers' plans, or roll
them over into individual retirement accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Comparing 529 Plans, Custodial Accounts</TE>
<TE>   Q: I would appreciate your further insights comparing custodial
accounts with 529 plans. You recently said that a Uniform Transfers
to Minors Act, or UTMA, account could be transferred to a 529 college
savings plan.</TE>
<TE>   My broker, however, told me I would have to sell the investments
held within the UTMA because 529 plans accepted only cash. True? This
would have real tax consequences now that could outweigh the future
benefits. My broker also tells me I would have much less control over
the investments in a 529. Isn't this lack of control a disadvantage?
I have an UTMA for my 4-year-old and was thinking of establishing
another account for the baby who's about to arrive.</TE>
<TE>   A: Your broker is correct: 529 plans accept only cash
contributions, so transferring the account would require selling your
current investments. And you would have less day-to-day control over
a 529 account.</TE>
<TE>   Although most 529 plans offer a variety of investment options, the
decisions on which individual stocks and bonds to purchase are left
to professional money managers.</TE>
<TE>   Whether you see this as a disadvantage depends on how much
confidence you have in your own investing abilities, or those of your
broker. Many people prefer to turn over their investments to
professionals rather than worry about the daily monitoring and
research typically required when investing directly in stocks and
bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Which option is better for tax purposes depends on the details of
your situation. Income and realized gains in custodial accounts such
as UTMAs may be taxable, whereas 529 plans are tax-free.</TE>
<TE>   You might want to sit down with your tax preparer to go over the
numbers, but generally speaking, the younger your children are and
the more you have saved, the more likely it is that the tax benefits
of the 529 plan will outweigh the tax consequences of selling the
investments now and paying taxes at the children's current rate.</TE>

Hurley at www.savingfor college.com or of the College Savings Plan
Network, an affiliate of the National Assn. of State Treasurers, at

<HD>Firm Rates Integrity of Investment Companies</HD>
<DH>But securities experts caution that consumers should use
several sources of information when choosing a broker.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors spooked by the recent spate of scandals in the securities
industry have a new tool for evaluating their brokerage firms.</LD>
<LD>   Weiss Ratings Inc., a Florida-based corporate rating firm, has
come up with an "integrity rating" for investment companies.</LD>
<LD>   The rating, compiled by tabulating data on arbitration awards,
lawsuits and regulatory actions against securities firms, is designed
to help investors avoid those that attract the most attention from
regulators and complaints from customers.</LD>
<TE>   Some securities firms say the rating system is flawed, but Weiss
contends it provides useful information.</TE>
<TE>   "Until now, no one had a statistical way of measuring integrity.
It was just such a hard issue to get a handle on," said Martin D.
Weiss, chairman of Weiss Ratings and author of "The Ultimate Safe
Money Guide." "With these numbers, we feel we have an
apples-to-apples way of comparing one firm to another."</TE>
<TE>   Weiss took data from 1997 to 2001 and created a ratio that
reflects the number of lawsuits and regulatory actions per million
customers for the 18 biggest investment firms in the U.S. These firms
account for about 80% of the nation's brokerage business.</TE>
<TE>   By using a ratio rather than a raw number, Weiss hopes to account
for the fact that, although big brokerages tend to attract more
complaints than small ones, that's often a matter of size, not
ethics.</TE>
<TE>   Three-Part Analysis</TE>
<TE>   This is part of a three-pronged approach that Weiss is using to
rate brokerage firms. The company has published a report on brokerage
firms that maintained positive investment ratings on companies that
were careening into Bankruptcy Court. And it soon will report on how
integrity--at least as measured by Weiss--affects an investment
company's financial stability.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss found that the vast majority of brokerage firms it
evaluated--47 of 50--clung to "buy" ratings on companies that were so
financially troubled that they filed for bankruptcy protection,
wiping out equity investors.</TE>
<TE>   There also is a connection between a firm's integrity and its
financial stability, Weiss said.</TE>
<TE>   An early reading of the data that will be contained in his third
report suggests that most brokerage failures are linked to high
numbers of legal actions and arbitration claims.</TE>
<TE>   The firms that scored lowest in Weiss' integrity
ratings--Prudential Securities Inc., Ameritrade and U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray--are critical of Weiss' methodology.</TE>
<TE>   They say Weiss totaled all complaints, regardless of whether the
complaint eventually was settled in the customer's favor or the
brokerage firm's favor. Moreover, some of the complaints were related
to institutional business or employee complaints--issues that
generally don't concern individual brokerage clients.</TE>
<TE>   Prudential said a few of the complaints on its record really were
filed against another brokerage firm, which simply cleared its
business through Prudential.</TE>
<TE>   "The Weiss rating has been troubling to us from the beginning
because it seems to look at raw numbers," a Prudential spokesman
said. "We believe you need to look beyond the numbers and see how
many of the complaints were settled in the broker's favor. The fact
that a complaint was filed doesn't necessarily make it valid."</TE>
<TE>   However, the rating firm countered that all brokerages were
subject to the same rules so the overall ranking shouldn't be
affected by it.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, although some complaints were settled in the brokerage
firms' favor, any consumer willing to go all the way through
arbitration or the legal system is clearly dissatisfied, Weiss
President David Lackey said.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody has an excuse about why this doesn't apply to them,"
Lackey added. "But the ratings are consistent."</TE>
<TE>   What firms had the highest and lowest integrity ratings, according
to the Weiss study?</TE>
<TE>   Prudential Securities ranked the worst, with 72.3 complaints per
million customer accounts. Online brokerage Ameritrade was ranked
second worst with 67.1 complaints per million. U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray Inc. closely followed with 64.5 complaints per million.</TE>
<TE>   There's a big gap between these firms and the next
most-complained-about firms. And a few firms had a nearly spotless
record. Fidelity Brokerage Services had 3.7 complaints per million
customers; Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. had 5.0 complaints per
million and Edward D. Jones &amp; Co. had 8.1 complaints per million.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't speak to the methodology, but our feeling is that if we
had eight complaints per million, that's still eight too many," said
Alan F. Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward Jones. "We try
very hard to make sure that our customers understand what they're
buying and don't make more risks than they can handle."</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line: The chances of having a problem with one of the
worst-ranked firms is about 8 to 10 times greater than with one of
the best-ranked firms, Weiss said.</TE>
<TE>   Multiple Sources Needed</TE>
<TE>   Securities experts caution that consumers should use several
sources of information when choosing a broker. For instance, Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co., which scored relatively well in the Weiss rankings, is
at the center of the current storm over conflicts of interest
involving stock analysts.</TE>
<TE>   The Weiss ratings also can't replace referrals from friends and
family and checks on the history of the individual broker who has
been assigned to your account, said Margaret Draper, a spokeswoman
for the Securities Industry Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers who are considering switching brokerage firms should
check the National Assn. of Securities Dealer's Web site at www
.nasdr.com. The site includes the complaint history of each
registered representative and also has information on financial
advisors who don't sell securities. Similar information is available
on the NASD's disclosure hotline at (800) 289-9999.</TE>

<DH>Labor: As a Monday contract deadline looms, shippers and
dockworkers are trying to find common ground on issues of job
security and technology.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On one side of the table sits a tough, deliberative, tradition-bound
union determined to protect some of the last great blue-collar jobs
in America.</LD>
<LD>   On the other is an increasingly powerful and impatient group of
multinational corporations driven to move merchandise ever faster as
transpacific trade explodes.</LD>
<LD>   The gulf between them--which has grown through years of distrust,
resentment and misunderstanding--at times seems as wide as the ocean
that separates California and Asia.</LD>
<TE>   That divide now colors every move in the high-stakes contract
negotiations between the Pacific Maritime Assn., representing ocean
carriers and stevedoring services, and the International Longshore
and Warehouse Union. Talks covering 10,500 dockworkers along the West
Coast began a month ago in San Francisco, but have yielded little.
The current contract expires at 5 p.m. Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Each side has gripes: Ocean carriers claim the union operates
under cumbersome, 40-year-old rules and has been slow to accept
technological changes that could save them millions of dollars.
Workers claim the shipping lines want to chip away at their strength
by moving highly paid jobs to nonunion contractors, reducing health
benefits and eliminating the union's revered hiring halls.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the toughest points, however, are ambiguous and emotional,
and they cannot be resolved with a clause in a contract. That became
clear during two recent tours of a major Los Angeles port terminal,
guided alternately by representatives of management and labor with
the intent of clarifying contract issues.</TE>
<TE>   From the start, it was evident that these were starkly different
cultures. High-level union officials debated for a week before
agreeing to the tour and establishing ground rules. The PMA made
arrangements in a day, with only one condition: The shipping line
that opened its doors could not be named. "If we say anything that
makes the union mad," a supervisor said, "they can make life hell for
us."</TE>
<TE>   The foreign-owned line operates one of the largest and most modern
of 14 terminals in the Los Angeles-Long Beach port complex. Covering
300 acres, it can accommodate three mega-ships at a time, each one
carrying several thousand steel containers the size of railroad cars.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Thursday morning, the terminal hummed with activity.
Trucks rumbled along lanes of containers, which were stacked
three-high by machines resembling giant forklifts. At the water's
edge, long-limbed cranes plucked multi-ton boxes from ships' decks,
then set them down on a truck chassis with a thunderous boom. Two
minutes later, the same crane dropped another load. Then another and
another.</TE>
<TE>   Strict Work Rules</TE>
<TE>   The scene was noisy, outsized and frenetic. Then, at 11:30 a.m.,
it came to a sudden halt. Time for lunch.</TE>
<TE>   Industry consultant Frank Hanley, who was leading the management
tour, chuckled and shook his head. He couldn't have asked for a
better demonstration of the union's power.</TE>
<TE>   As the average U.S. workweek grew through the 1990s, and 24-hour
operations and staggered shifts became routine, the ILWU managed to
maintain work rules much as they existed a generation ago. They
include a common hour-long lunch break, double-pay for night shifts
and the guarantee of a work pace that the union calls healthy and
sustainable, but the shippers deride as simply slow.</TE>
<TE>   ILWU members are among the highest-paid blue-collar employees in
the nation, with basic longshore workers earning an average of
$80,000 last year, including overtime, and union foremen taking in
$158,000.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not middle income, that's upper income," said Hanley, who
once managed terminals in Hong Kong and Oakland for a U.S. ocean
carrier, but left the company several years ago after it was bought
by a Singapore-based freight line. Part of a wave of consolidations
that shifted most major shipping lines on the West Coast to foreign
ownership, the sale nudged many veteran employees such as Hanley into
early retirement.</TE>
<TE>   His task that day was to show how new electronic devices could
speed up the freight-moving process, boosting productivity and
profits and making way for the growth of international trade. The PMA
says the union has blocked such technology to protect jobs.</TE>
<TE>   First stop was the terminal's main entrance. On an average day,
trucks pass through its gates 3,000 times to deliver containers for
export or, more commonly, empties that once carried consumer goods
from Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Each "gate move" must be documented, and the driver assigned to a
spot on the crowded terminal grounds. How that transaction happens is
one of the most contentious issues in the contract talks.</TE>
<TE>   Shippers claim most of the information, such as origin,
destination and contents of the container, could be collected
electronically by optical scanners that read codes stamped on the
side. But they say the union insists on manually keying in much of
the data, and staffing the gates as they have for decades: with one
highly paid clerk for each of the 10 entry lanes.</TE>
<TE>   "Four or five could handle what 10 are doing today," Hanley said,
"but they won't allow it."</TE>
<TE>   An incremental step, he said, was the installation of cabin-height
printers at each gate, which allow truckers to tear off their own
documents rather than taking them from a clerk. The union resisted
that change for months, Hanley said. Meanwhile, clerks insisted on
tearing out orders from the printers and handing them to drivers, who
had to park and walk to get them. Those steps added 40 seconds to
each transaction, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Union representatives say printers now are being used as intended,
and that they simply needed time to study the change.</TE>
<TE>   "They have the right to introduce new technology. It's already in
the contract," said Peter Peyton, a third-generation longshoreman.
Section 15 of the contract that expires Monday states, "There shall
be no interference by the union with the employers' right to operate
efficiently and to change methods of work and to utilize mechanical,
electronic or other labor-saving devices."</TE>
<TE>   There are just two caveats: The technology can't be used to make
the work more difficult, or to move it outside the union's
jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   Tough Negotiations</TE>
<TE>   Shipping lines say the union uses those conditions to block the
technological changes they need. Workers say without them, the use of
scanners, remote cameras and computers could allow shipping lines to
move jobs to nonunion contractors in low-wage states. Peyton said the
union has proved through the grievance process that several shipping
lines have done just that.</TE>
<TE>   Such fundamental disagreements marked each stop on the two tours
and illustrated the reason negotiations have been so tough.</TE>
<TE>   When Hanley discussed technology, it became clear that the
shipping lines' primary motivation is to sharply reduce the number of
highly paid clerks employed at the ports. Although no union members
would be fired, he said, some clerks might have to be trained in less
desirable work.</TE>
<TE>   Comments from an operations manager who went along on the tour,
but asked not to be identified, also indicated a resentment of the
union's perceived arrogance. "The ILWU has never punched a clock," he
said in claiming that some members report late for work. Later,
nodding toward a line of battered dock trucks, he said, "Look at the
way they treat our equipment."</TE>
<TE>   The flip side of that resentment is a fear of the ILWU that is all
but unknown in these days of shrinking union membership and weakened
labor power. In a major dispute, the union could shut down the entire
Western waterfront. But even a small offense could have subtle
repercussions. For example, the manager said, union dispatchers with
a grudge could assign less experienced "casual" workers to the
terminal, slowing production.</TE>
<TE>   Partners, Not Employees</TE>
<TE>   For their part, union representatives said they merely want to be
treated as respected partners in port development, not compliant
employees. "If they listened to us, we could save them millions,"
Peyton said.</TE>
<TE>   Passing through the same terminal a week later, he pointed out
several union-inspired innovations that have helped the shippers'
bottom lines, such as labor-saving quick-release locks on containers.</TE>
<TE>   A college-educated computer aficionado who defies the stereotype
of a burly dockworker, Peyton said terminal operators could boost
productivity by installing a shared central computer system. They
won't, he said, because of competitive concerns. "One time, I had to
wait two hours for three containers to come over from another
terminal because the computers were incompatible," he said. "Someone
literally had to drive over to pick up the paperwork."</TE>
<TE>   Peyton, whose clerical job is a prime target for shipping lines,
also challenged the idea that faster gate transactions would speed
the flow of containers. He said it would just move congestion from
outside the gates to inside the yard. "It's already like dodge ball
in here," he said as trucks plowed past each other.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Peyton's arguments came down to philosophy. Why
shouldn't dockworkers share in the bounty of global trade? Why is it
archaic for a blue-collar worker to live comfortably and support a
community's economy? Why does high productivity trump solid jobs?</TE>
<TE>   His grandfather worked the docks before the union was born in
1934. Through family lore, Peyton knows how dangerous and humiliating
those days were. Men lined up on the waterfront to bribe foremen with
money and offers of women. Once hired, they were worked to the point
of exhaustion.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until many failed attempts, and finally a brutal strike
in 1934, that the union was born and employers were forced to
negotiate.</TE>
<TE>   Union members along the coast commemorate that strike, known as
Bloody Thursday, every July 5 with marches and speeches. Some ports
close for several hours. In San Francisco, painted outlines mark the
places where two bodies fell.</TE>
<TE>   In the frenetic, cutthroat, fast-changing world of global trade,
such reverence for history might be seen as a sign of everything
wrong with the ILWU, proof that the union is archaic and inefficient.</TE>
<TE>   To dockworkers, however, the past informs the future, and
ultimately, they believe that's what keeps their union strong.</TE>

<LD>WorldCom Hit With Federal Fraud Lawsuit</LD>
<LD>   Federal investigators slapped WorldCom Inc., the nation's
second-largest long-distance company, with a civil fraud lawsuit to
prevent it from disposing of assets, destroying documents and paying
off senior officers.</LD>
<LD>   This followed WorldCom's disclosure that it had improperly
accounted for $3.9 billion in expenses over the last five quarters,
showing that it was earning significant profit at a time it was
losing hundreds of millions of dollars.</LD>
<TE>   Key WorldCom executives, including former Chief Executive Bernard
J. Ebbers and former Chief Financial Officer Scott D. Sullivan, who
was fired as part of the scandal, were subpoenaed to appear before a
House panel investigating the affair.</TE>
<TE>   The disclosure also prompted the Securities and Exchange
Commission to accelerate plans to force chief executives and
financial officers to guarantee financial statements, making them
potentially liable if the data are found to be fraudulent. The
certifications would be required of the nation's 1,000 largest
corporations by Aug. 15, the agency said.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal is expected to force WorldCom into a bankruptcy filing
that could make the company stronger, if it doesn't lose massive
numbers of customers in the process.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Xerox Inflated Revenue, Will Restate Earnings</TE>
<TE>   Xerox Corp. said it inflated revenue by $1.9 billion over the last
five years by misreporting sales of equipment and service contracts.
Xerox's stock plunged on the report.</TE>
<TE>   By shifting the timing and makeup of sales, Xerox was able to meet
earnings forecasts. The Securities and Exchange Commission fined the
company a record $10 million in April because of the false reporting
of about $3 billion in sales.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   First Criminal Charges Filed in Enron Case</TE>
<TE>   In the first criminal charges stemming directly from Enron Corp.'s
financial dealings, federal prosecutors accused three former
employees of a British bank of secretly investing in an Enron
partnership from which they earned more than $7 million in illicit
profits.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors charged three former investment bankers at Greenwich
NatWest with wire fraud, alleging that they cheated their employer by
recommending that it sell its stake in an Enron partnership
controlled by then-Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow for
$1 million--knowing it was worth much more.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Investigation of Martha Stewart Widens</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. continued to plunge
after reports of a wider investigation of alleged insider trading by
Martha Stewart, who heads the multimedia company.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities were reported to be looking into possible charges of
obstruction of justice and making false statements regarding alleged
insider trading in Stewart's sale of shares in ImClone Systems Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The reports so far appear to have had little effect on the
company's business. Stewart's most important constituency--the TV
viewers, magazine readers and home-decorating disciples who buy
products ranging from paint to gardening tools emblazoned with her
name--have stood by the entertaining expert, retailers and others
said.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart continued to deny wrongdoing in the affair, although she
refused to elaborate on the matter at public appearances during the
week, including her regular weekly appearance on CBS' "The Early
Show."</TE>

<TE>   United Airlines Seeks Federal Loan Guarantee</TE>
<TE>   United Airlines, severely damaged by the weak economy,
labor-management feuds and a slump in air travel after Sept. 11,
applied for a $1.8-billion federal loan guarantee to help ensure its
survival.</TE>
<TE>   Although the nation's second-largest carrier has nearly $3 billion
in cash, United and parent company UAL Corp. are losing millions of
dollars a day, facing big debt payments later this year and are
nearly closed off from conventional lending sources. So the airline
decided to seek federal backing before the loan-guarantee program
stopped taking applications.</TE>
<TE>   United's petition for help--by far the largest request since the
program was created by Congress after the terrorist attacks--is
fraught with unknowns. Among them: whether United would be granted
the guarantee and, if not, how much that would further cripple the
carrier. For 2001, United reported a loss of $2.1 billion, an airline
record.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia Files for Bankruptcy Protection</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia Communications Corp., the nation's sixth-largest cable
provider and the leader in Southern California, filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection, plagued by one of the biggest accounting
scandals in corporate history.</TE>
<TE>   The bankruptcy filing had been expected for weeks, following the
disclosure of $3 billion in off-the-books borrowings by Adelphia's
founding Rigas family.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia's nearly 6 million customers nationwide--and 1.2 million
in Southern California--probably won't see any immediate change in
their television service. The company said it would continue to
operate as usual during bankruptcy proceedings, while working on a
reorganization plan to restructure its debt and get back on track.</TE>
<TE>   The company is expected to downsize and sell assets to reduce
debts. Among the properties that could be sold are its prized local
cable systems in Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, Pacific Palisades, Santa
Monica, Brentwood and Redondo Beach and in Orange and Ventura
counties.</TE>

<TE>   Vivendi's Messier Loses a Key Supporter</TE>
<TE>   Already struggling to quell the tumult surrounding his company,
French media baron Jean-Marie Messier suffered yet another blow when
his top supporter became the fifth board member to resign this year
from Vivendi Universal.</TE>
<TE>   Bernard Arnault, chairman of luxury goods maker LVMH Moet Hennessy
Louis Vuitton and one of France's most respected businessmen, did not
explain why he was stepping down from Vivendi's board of directors.
But analysts speculated that he and other French board members were
frustrated by some of Chief Executive Messier's recent decisions and
conflicting statements about his plans for Vivendi's water business.</TE>
<TE>   The departure leaves Messier's position on the company's 15-member
board more tenuous than ever, analysts said.</TE>

<TE>   Northrop, Lockheed Win Coast Guard Contract</TE>
<TE>   Northrop Grumman Corp. and Lockheed Martin Corp. won the Coast
Guard's largest-ever contract--worth a potential $17 billion over 30
years--to replace and upgrade aging ships, aircraft and
communications systems.</TE>
<TE>   The fiercely contested contract, considered big even by today's
defense industry standards, calls for Northrop and Lockheed to help
modernize a service that operates a fleet of ships and planes that is
among the oldest in the world.</TE>

<TE>   Raises to Shrink for White-Collar Workers</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in nine years, many white-collar workers will
get pay raises of less than 4% in 2002, according to a report
released by the Conference Board. The survey is the latest indication
that compensation gains are slowing, and prompts concerns among
economists that smaller raises could dampen consumer spending and
economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   A majority of workers will get the traditional 4% pay increase,
but a larger share of employees will see raises smaller than they
received in the last several years, according to the survey of 533
companies conducted by the New York-based nonprofit business research
organization.</TE>

<TE>   Jury Awards Punitive Damages to City of Hope</TE>
<TE>   A jury ordered Genentech Inc. to pay City of Hope National Medical
Center $200 million in punitive damages for betraying its trust with
the renowned cancer hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The award ends a four-month trial over the contract that
established a brief collaboration between the hospital and Genentech
26 years ago. It came a week after jurors ordered Genentech to pay
$300.2 million in compensatory damages to City of Hope for
withholding royalties from the Duarte medical center.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors awarded punitive damages to punish Genentech for acting
with fraud or malice.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech said it was disappointed by the award and would appeal,
setting in motion a legal process the company said could take one to
four years to complete.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Markets Finish Worst First Half in Decades</TE>
<TE>   Major stock market indexes completed their steepest first-half
decline in more than three decades, amid concerns about corporate
profits, the slowing economic recovery, the weakening dollar and
doubts over companies' accounting. On a brighter note, many major
indexes managed to post gains for the week, snapping a five-week
losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose less than 0.1% for the week but
lost 13.7% in the first half, the most in a year's first six months
since 1970. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.2% for the
week and was down 7.8% for the first six months. The Nasdaq composite
index added 1.5% for the week but is down 25% year to date.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the dollar continued to sink, approaching a one-to-one
exchange rate with the euro.</TE>

<HD>Tour de Lance</HD>
<DH>Armstrong Is Favorite to Make It Four in a Row in Tour de
France</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL McDONOUGH</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Lance Armstrong dominated last year's Tour de France so completely
that the race was over long before riders reached the finish.</LD>
<LD>   Now, as the Texan prepares to bid for a fourth straight title, he
has some news to make opponents tremble: He's gotten even stronger.</LD>
<LD>   "On balance, compared to 1999, 2000 and 2001, I feel better,"
Armstrong said in an interview. "Anything can happen -- I can lose
form, or have an accident. But I'm optimistic."</LD>
<TE>   The 30-year-old Armstrong, who astonished the world by coming back
from cancer to win cycling's toughest event three years ago, has good
reason to be upbeat.</TE>
<TE>   His main challenger, Jan Ullrich, won't be making the Saturday
start in Luxembourg. The German, who won in 1997 and finished second
the last two years, was sidelined by a knee injury in May. And former
champion Marco Pantani, mired in drug problems, will also be missing,
leaving few serious threats for Armstrong.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Armstrong probably knows the terrain of the three-week Tour
better than anyone else competing.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done all the mountain stages and all the time trials," said
the U.S. Postal Service rider, whose rivals concede his training
schedule is extraordinarily demanding. "We've done some of the hard
climbs twice."</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong began taming the French mountains in competition weeks
ago, winning two warmup events--the Midi Libre in May and the
Dauphine Libere in June.</TE>
<TE>   On his way to claiming the second race, Armstrong rode up the Mont
Ventoux, a highlight of this year's Tour.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the hardest climb in France," he said of the twisty mountain
pass, which Tour riders will negotiate in the fierce July heat of the
southern Provence region.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong conquered the same summit in the 2000 Tour but held off
in the finishing stretch to let Pantani win the stage. He later
called it a "gift," although the Italian deemed it an insult.</TE>
<TE>   Mont Ventoux is one of several climbs featured in this year's Tour
-- the shortest ever in terms of distance -- that Armstrong has made
in the past.</TE>
<TE>   In the exceptionally difficult 16th stage in the Alps, riders face
the Col du Galibier mountain pass, where Armstrong claimed the win
that signaled his full comeback from testicular cancer. The
spectacular 1999 stage-victory came 2 1/2 years after he underwent
brain surgery to remove the disease, which had also spread to his
lungs.</TE>
<TE>   The 16th stage between Les Deux-Alpes and La Plagne also takes
riders over the Col de la Madeleine, where Armstrong last year
bluffed rivals by feigning a loss of form. He grimaced in apparent
pain, then suddenly sprinted up the next summit to open a huge lead
over his startled rivals.</TE>
<TE>   "Up until now, all I've done is train and race small events,"
Armstrong said as he prepared for his title defense. "Maybe the Tour
de France brings extra motivation."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe indeed. Armstrong is two wins shy of the Tour record of five
titles, held jointly by Jacques Anquetil, Bernard Hinault, Eddy
Merckx and Miguel Indurain. Only Spain's Indurain won all five titles
consecutively.</TE>
<TE>   By taking this year's race, Armstrong would surpass fellow
American Greg LeMond's three Tour titles and become the fourth rider
to win the event four times in a row.</TE>
<TE>   With Ullrich and Pantani out, Armstrong's main rivals are likely
to be Oscar Sevilla and Joseba Beloki of Spain and Colombia's
Santiago Botero. U.S. Postal teammate Roberto Heras is also a podium
contender.</TE>
<TE>   A French doping investigation into U.S. Postal will likely still
be open when the Tour starts. But judicial officials say the 19-month
inquiry has revealed no evidence of wrongdoing and is due to close by
the end of the summer.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong, who has been plagued by suspicions of doping in France
but has never failed a drug test, says he considers the issue "dead."</TE>
<TE>   "It is without merit and I will no longer pay attention to it," he
said on his Web site in June.</TE>
<TE>   However, U.S. Postal recently walked into a new doping controversy
by hiring Italian rider Giampaolo Mondini, then firing him when it
learned he was being investigated as part of the drugs bust at the
2001 Giro d'Italia.</TE>
<TE>   "We were most guilty of not researching the affair," Armstrong
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We were completely surprised and of course we would never have
hired him. When we discovered all the facts, it was clear what he
would be let go."</TE>
<TE>   The Tour finishes July 28 on the Champs-Elysees in Paris.</TE>

<HD>Braves' Bullpen Is a New Relief</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Unusual group gives Atlanta a boost with a
winning record, plenty of saves and an ERA of 2.37.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL NEWBERRY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>They're an odd collection: the Cy Young starter-turned-closer, the
guy who took 2 1/2 years off, the 28-year-old rookie.</LD>
<LD>   Eclectic, yes, but effective, too, by joining forces to give the
Atlanta Braves the most dominating bullpen in baseball.</LD>
<LD>   "There's no doubt there's been a couple of surprises," starting
pitcher Kevin Millwood said. "Not surprised that they could get
people out, but surprised how well they've done collectively. I don't
remember anybody having a pen that's been as good as consistently as
these guys have been all year."</LD>
<TE>   The Braves usually end things with John Smoltz, the 1996 Cy Young
winner who spent his first 13 seasons as a starter. He switched to
closer midway through last season when his right elbow couldn't stand
the strain of working six or seven innings at a time.</TE>
<TE>   But Smoltz is merely a good place to start when talking about the
long, strange road this bullpen has traveled. Consider his cohorts:</TE>
<TE>   * Chris Hammond, who retired midway through the 1998 season and
spent the next 2 1/2 years helping raise his three children on an
Alabama ranch. He returned to the game last year and now, at age 36,
has never been better.</TE>
<TE>   * Kevin Gryboski, who spent seven years toiling in the Seattle
farm system without ever getting a call to the majors. In January, he
was picked up by the Braves in an obscure minor-league deal and
finally made it to the majors at age 28.</TE>
<TE>   * Mike Remlinger, another late bloomer who had mediocre stints
with San Francisco, the New York Mets and Cincinnati. Acquired by the
Braves after the '98 season as a throw-in to the Denny
Neagle-for-Bret Boone trade, he suddenly blossomed into one of the
most effective setup relievers in the game.</TE>
<TE>   * Darren Holmes, a former closer in Colorado whose career appeared
to be over after he pitched for three organizations in 2000 and
missed all of last season recovering from back surgery.</TE>
<TE>   * Kerry Ligtenberg, who was spotted by the Braves while pitching
in the now-defunct Prairie League. The team gave up six dozen
baseballs and two dozen bats to sign him.</TE>
<TE>   Cumulatively, Atlanta's bullpen was 16-9 with 26 saves through
Wednesday and led the majors with an earned-run average of 2.37 as
the All-Star break approached, helping the Braves build a commanding
lead in the NL East.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to say it's our biggest surprise, but it's
definitely the biggest asset of our team," starter Jason Marquis
said. "I didn't think Hammond or Holmes would come back after such a
long hiatus, but they've proven they can pitch."</TE>
<TE>   Hammond believes experience is the key to a successful bullpen.
Excluding Gryboski, the other five relievers have a total of more
than 40 years in the big leagues.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd have to say everybody besides (Gryboski) has pitched in
situations that nobody wants to pitch in," Hammond said. "I guess the
pressure doesn't bother anybody in our bullpen."</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't bother Gryboski, either. After spending so much time in
the minors, the prospect of facing someone such as Mike Piazza with
the game on the line doesn't seem overwhelming.</TE>
<TE>   "I always knew I could pitch at this level," Gryboski said. "I
just wanted an opportunity, a chance to show what I could do."</TE>
<TE>   The right-handed Gryboski, who began his pro career in 1995, never
got a call from the Mariners even though he put up strong numbers at
double A and triple A. He had 43 saves in the last three years,
including a career-high 22 at Tacoma last season.</TE>
<TE>   When the Braves spotted Gryboski on the waiver wire in the
offseason, they contacted the Mariners and worked out a trade.</TE>
<TE>   "They wouldn't give me a chance at all," Gryboski said, adding
that Mariners Manager Lou Piniella "wanted veteran pitchers with
experience. I kind of got lost in the mix."</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the Braves' pitching staff wonders how someone with
Gryboski's stuff managed to get overlooked. He has a devastating
sinker that's just as effective to left-handed hitters as it is to
right-handers.</TE>
<TE>   In his first 21 games with the Braves, Gryboski was 2-1 with a
1.44 ERA, working his way into a setup role.</TE>
<TE>   "He's probably got the best stuff of anybody down there," said
starter Greg Maddux, no small statement in a bullpen that also
includes Smoltz. "He's got the best pitch in baseball: the moving
fastball that he can locate."</TE>
<TE>   Hammond might just be a bigger surprise than Gryboski. After all,
the left-hander thought his career was over when he headed home in
1998 rather than report to the minors. He didn't even pick up a
baseball for more than two years.</TE>
<TE>   After calling off retirement, Hammond spent the entire 2001 season
at triple A, then was invited to spring training by the Braves as a
non-roster player. He made the team and quickly earned an important
role out of the bullpen, going 6-2 with a 1.59 ERA in his first 30
games.</TE>
<TE>   Smoltz, who usually pitches in save situations (he had converted
25 of 28 chances), is the only reliever with a definite role. Manager
Bobby Cox feels so comfortable with the others that he mixes and
matches freely. Remlinger and Hammond are left-handers. Gryboski and
Holmes are righties. All have worked in setup roles.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had just one or two guys, it would be a tough situation,"
Holmes said. "But Bobby has six guys (including another rookie, Tim
Spooneybarger) he can use before Smoltzie. He has confidence in all
of us."</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta's bullpen has been a liability in some playoff
appearances. If the Braves go on to win their 11th consecutive
division title, they won't mind placing a call to this group of
relievers.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think our bullpen has ever been anywhere close to where
this one is," Millwood said. "Those guys have bonded together and
everybody out there accepts their role."</TE>

<HD>Say 'Sayonara' to Soccer's Fever Pitch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY KORNHEISER</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Our first question today comes from a B. Arena, who writes, "'What
happened to the World Cup? I look through the paper, and I can't find
it anywhere. It's 'Honey, I Shrunk the Coverage!' I thought soccer
fever was sweeping America. How could it end so soon?"</LD>
<LD>   The fever broke when Germany took an insurmountable lead of 1-0
against the United States, and went on to win, 1-0. Immediately
thereafter, cries of "Check, please!" were heard all over America and
tens of millions of people went back to the real world, leaving the
soccer poets to roam the pitch alone.</LD>
<LD>   Haven't we been through enough of these "Guess What's Sweeping
America This Week?" type of big events (women's World Cup soccer, the
Tour de France when Lance Armstrong and Greg LeMond won, the Winter
Olympics short-track speedskating with Apolo Anton Ohno) to recognize
the trampoline effect?</LD>
<TE>   The bounce is short-lived. The interest in World Cup was localized
. It was interest in the U.S. team. When it was eliminated, the bus
emptied.</TE>
<TE>   Oh please, like you really gave a rat's patootie if South Korea
beat Turkey. You want to know why nobody cares after the U.S. is out?
Here's why: Germany-U.S.; Germany-South Korea; Turkey-Senegal;
Brazil-Turkey. Each game ended 1-0. It's water torture.</TE>
<TE>   And don't you dare say that anyone who doesn't kneel at the altar
of soccer is prejudiced against international sports and foreign
athletes. We've got lots of foreign athletes playing an international
sport right here. It's called the NBA. Three of the NBA's first seven
draft choices, five of the top 16 and 14 of the 58 overall picks were
foreign athletes.</TE>
<TE>   The Denver Nuggets chose Nikoloz Tskitishvili with the fifth pick
of the draft and traded for Nene Hilario. They then selected a U.N.
interpreter in the second round. Trying saying "Tskitishvili" three
times fast. Try saying it once. Try sewing it on a Nuggets jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Our next question is from G. Williams, who asks, "What do you
think of where the Maryland kids landed in the NBA draft?"</TE>
<TE>   Lonny Baxter did fine going to Chicago, where Bill Cartwright
ought to appreciate his work ethic and willingness to compete.
Chicago has assembled a nice group of young players. Chris Wilcox
going to the Clippers is harder to figure. The Clippers' best player
is Elton Brand, a power forward. Why draft power forward Wilcox and
power forward Melvin Ely? (Is one of them trade bait already?) What's
Elgin Baylor trying to do, get a monopoly of power forwards and then
start building hotels on them?</TE>
<TE>   Juan Dixon going to the Wizards is a feel-good story. But is it
the best place for Dixon? Doug Collins talked of Dixon having "a
Michael Jordan-like heart." Dixon's personal history is a road map of
triumph over tragedy. Everybody in town is pulling for him to have a
great NBA career.</TE>
<TE>   The only worry is that this is home. Sometimes it's harder for the
hometown kid-- it was for Bobby Bonilla and Stephon Marbury in New
York, to name two. Sometimes the pressure to please everybody weighs
you down. Dixon has been a star here for so long, it might be hard
for his friends and fans to accept him in a lesser role, even for a
while. Let's hope they all have patience, and the tears of joy Dixon
shed when he heard his name called by the home team won't ever turn
bitter.</TE>
<TE>   Our next question comes from M. Lemieux, who asks, "What do you
make of those quotes from Jaromir Jagr, saying he didn't have any
warning that Ron Wilson had been fired, and he had no input into the
hiring of Bruce Cassidy?"</TE>
<TE>   It's odd. For the big money the Capitals are paying Jagr--and for
the heat Jagr had to take when the Caps didn't make the playoffs--it
certainly seems like management should be taking Jagr's temperature
on any coaching changes. Can the Caps truly afford to take the chance
that Jagr and Cassidy won't hit it off?</TE>
<TE>   It was clear from the quotes that Jagr would have preferred his
former Penguins teammate, Bryan Trottier. But Trottier was recently
hired by the Rangers, and Jagr said he didn't pass Trottier's name on
to anyone in the Capitals' food chain.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not the guy to tell people what to do," Jagr said. "They've
got the responsibility, and it's their decision."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, but maybe for the money Jagr ought to be the guy to tell
people what to do. Maybe he ought to try to make this his team, like
Mark Messier did with the Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   Our next question comes from K. Caminiti, who writes, "Get off my
back. I didn't mean to say that 50 percent of baseball players took
steroids. I meant to say that I tried them once. I got them from John
McEnroe."</TE>
<TE>   Now comes the accusation from McEnroe's former wife, Tatum O'Neal,
that the temperamental Mr. McEnroe took steroids in 1987. (Oh, like
she's Madame Curie.) Maybe he did, and maybe, as Martina Navratilova
suggested, "They must have been placebos."</TE>
<TE>   Does anybody remember McEnroe looking anything but skinny? He
never had a single muscle in his entire body--except his mouth. Maybe
he took steroids to build up his vocal chords so he could scream at
people.</TE>
<TE>   McEnroe's and O'Neal's dueling mudslings are overshadowing what's
happening at Wimbledon. And what's happening at Wimbledon is that
men's tennis has disappeared down the bowl. Ten of the top 14 seeds
are gone, and it's only the third round.</TE>
<TE>   Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi were bounced out in the second
round. Agassi lost to a player from Thailand! Thailand, not exactly
the cradle of forehands. It's sad seeing Sampras like this. He
doesn't have any gas. Sampras said he will play at Wimbledon again
next year because he doesn't want to go out this way. Fine. Just tell
us which way he wants to go out, so someone can call him a cab.</TE>
<TE>   Our final question today comes from T. Coughlin, who asks, "Not
that I want to name names, but what should the coach of the
Jacksonville Jaguars do if his punter and place kicker get burned in
a fondue accident?"</TE>
<TE>   Seriously, who fondues anymore? Was it "That '70s Night" at
Jaguars minicamp?</TE>
<TE>   What actually happened was that Jacksonville punter Chris Hanson
and place kicker Jaret Holmes were severely burned when the fondue
pot they were moving fell onto a tile floor in Hanson's house. "Then,
my wife fell into it," Hanson said.</TE>

<HD>TRIPLE PLAY</HD>
<DH>No Longer in Vogue, Triples Provide Baseball Fans a Run for
Their Money</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICK FREEMAN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jimmy Rollins led the National League in triples last year and is
leading again this year. He wanted to know: What's the single-season
record?</LD>
<LD>   The answer surprised him.</LD>
<LD>   "Thirty-six triples in a season, huh?" he said. "You might as well
forget about that."</LD>
<TE>   Baseball's record book sometimes seems as if it should be written
in pencil. But there's at least one hitting record that should be
safe in this era of unprecedented power.</TE>
<TE>   No one has come close to Owen Wilson's record of 36 since he set
it in 1912.</TE>
<TE>   Triples are down about 30% from a quarter-century ago, meaning
Wilson's mark doesn't figure to be in jeopardy anytime soon.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Rollins needs reminding. He hit 12 last year, and he has
six so far this season.</TE>
<TE>   The speedy Philadelphia shortstop is a prototypical triples
hitter. And while he could make his second All-Star game in a row,
players such as Rollins aren't in vogue the way bashers are now.</TE>
<TE>   Sluggers such as Barry Bonds draw fans. Sometimes the crowds come
for batting practice, where moonshots are routine.</TE>
<TE>   But even home run king Hank Aaron would rather see a player sprint
around the bases than trot.</TE>
<TE>   "The triple is the most exciting play in baseball," Aaron once
said. "Home runs win a lot of games, but I never understood why fans
are so obsessed with them."</TE>
<TE>   It's not as if ESPN's "Baseball Tonight" shows a daily list of
players who tripled.</TE>
<TE>   "When you go to arbitration, home runs is a big issue," Phillie
Manager Larry Bowa said. "Home runs and RBIs. So I would think home
runs is on everybody's mind in this generation."</TE>
<TE>   Just look at Sammy Sosa.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, as a prospect in the Texas Rangers' system, he actually
led the Florida State League with 12 triples while hitting only nine
home runs.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, as the NL MVP, it was a different story. He hit 66 home
runs--no triples, though.</TE>
<TE>   Strength didn't always trump speed.</TE>
<TE>   Triples outnumbered homers for a long time, even after the end of
the dead ball era.</TE>
<TE>   Back in 1929, two years after Babe Ruth hit 60 homers, there were
still more triples than homers in the AL. The last time that happened
in the NL was 1931.</TE>
<TE>   The long ball has ruled ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota's Cristian Guzman is the lone active player to have hit
20 or more triples in a season. Guzman, Lance Johnson and Willie
Wilson are the only big leaguers to have done it since George Brett
in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller ballparks and bigger outfielders have helped keep triples
rare. So has the near-disappearance of artificial turf.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, a lefty, played at Pittsburgh's Forbes Field, which was
376 feet to right field that year. No current major league park has
such a dimension.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit and Colorado led their leagues in triples last year. Both
teams have home parks with spacious outfields.</TE>
<TE>   "It just doesn't happen very often," Twins Manager Ron Gardenhire
said. "I don't know if you say it's a forgotten art. But you know,
you've got bigger, stronger outfielders who get the ball in quicker.
The ballparks have changed a little bit now, there's not that many
parks that are just huge.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not that many opportunities to hit triples."</TE>
<TE>   Guzman has just two this season. But his knack for getting three
bags hasn't gone unnoticed.</TE>
<TE>   "He pretty much hits them and doesn't plan on stopping,"
Philadelphia's Doug Glanville said. "When it's a double, he's still
not going to stop."</TE>
<TE>   Gardenhire was Guzman's third-base coach before he was his
manager. He's seen plenty of triples happen, literally right in front
of him.</TE>
<TE>   The excitement hasn't worn off yet.</TE>
<TE>   "When they hit a ball in the gap, your heart starts pounding
away," Gardenhire said. "You know they're coming to third base and
you know there's going to be a play."</TE>
<TE>   Rollins feels the same way. He was reduced to sound effects when
he described watching Glanville leg out a triple.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like 'voooosh!' You know?" Rollins said. "He's just hittin'
them corners and it's like an art. It's like an art."</TE>

<HD>Memories a Salve for 3 Uncles Lost in War</HD>
<DH>Family: A film inspired the writer to learn about her
relatives who died in World War II. The search brought pain but peace
of mind.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONI BALUH BEALL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They were always smiling, always looking down at me.</LD>
<LD>   There were four men in uniform in the portrait in my grandmother's
living room. They are my uncles, soldiers during World War II.</LD>
<LD>   Three of them--Jay, Tom and Danny Baluh--died in that war, all
within 12 months. My grandfather was in the picture too; he died
years later, heartbroken.</LD>
<TE>   My uncles died before I was born. My family didn't speak of them
often and I'm ashamed to admit I didn't ask. I knew almost nothing
about them.</TE>
<TE>   It was the 1998 film "Saving Private Ryan," and its effect on my
parents, that aroused my curiosity. It wasn't their reaction to the
movie, because they didn't see it -- they wouldn't see it. It was
their reaction to hearing about the film.</TE>
<TE>   "It hits too close to home," my mother said.</TE>
<TE>   In "Saving Private Ryan," one brother is killed in the Pacific
campaign, and two others die on Normandy's beaches. In real life, Tom
died in the Pacific, and Danny and Jay died in France.</TE>
<TE>   In the movie, there is a daring mission to bring a fourth brother
back home. There were no such heroics in real life; there was nothing
left to rescue.</TE>
<TE>   Except for the memory of my three uncles, and I set out to do just
that.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When I began my search in 1998 I had no intention of involving my
family. There was no point, I thought, in having them relive all that
pain just to satisfy my curiosity.</TE>
<TE>   There were all sorts of obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   A 1973 fire at the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis
destroyed 80% of the military records from 1917 to 1959. Records in
Pennsylvania were destroyed by Tropical Storm Agnes in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   And the biggest obstacle of all: World War II vets are dying at a
rate of 1,000 per day. As one vet told me: "You should have started
this 10 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   First, I tried to get my uncles' military records, but I had only
their names to go on. An official at the records center said I needed
their service numbers and politely told me I would need a closer
relative to make the requests. Their parents are dead, I said, and
the men never married and had no children.</TE>
<TE>   He said a brother or sister would do--but I didn't want to involve
them.</TE>
<TE>   The Army said it would need the dates of death to search death and
burial files. The Church of St. Stephen in Plymouth, Pa., could tell
me only that "they were buried sometime between Sept. 19, 1947, and
Nov. 15, 1947," and the Larksville American Legion, where their
bodies lay in state, didn't have records of the funeral.</TE>
<TE>   I remembered hearing that a Baluh post had been named in their
honor. After a few calls I learned that the Larksville Veterans of
Foreign Wars Baluh Memorial Post No. 6551 was established on April
25, 1946, but declared defunct on May 27, 1953.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, I stumbled onto two wonderful people: Ken Schlessinger, a
military archivist at the National Archives and Records
Administration in College Park, Md., and Jesse Teitelbaum of the
Luzerne County Historical Society in Wilkes-Barre, Pa. Schlessinger
found my uncles' service numbers and Teitelbaum sent me newspaper
clippings about their funeral.</TE>
<TE>   My father had told me the funeral was a big deal, and he wasn't
exaggerating. Articles started appearing in the Wilkes-Barre Record
in October 1947, when my uncles' bodies arrived in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the men's pictures were printed. Jay was a string bean,
tall and incredibly thin. Danny was cute, and young--he was drafted
at 18 and died about two months after his 19th birthday. Tom wore a
big grin, and as I got to know him better, I learned how different he
was from the others. There was a lot going on behind that smile.</TE>
<TE>   My grandparents, John and Mary Baluh, reared their seven boys and
a girl in coal company housing in Larksville, a town of about 8,000
in northeastern Pennsylvania's Wyoming Valley. And it was to
Larksville that the boys would return.</TE>
<TE>   Originally, they were scheduled to be shipped back separately. But
I would later learn that my grandfather had requested that all three
be sent home together "because [of] the expense of three funerals and
the emotional upset that would result from burying each boy at
different times."</TE>
<TE>   They arrived on Nov. 10, to more than 500 people waiting at the
station. There was a procession through Wilkes-Barre, Kingston,
Edwardsville and then Larksville, where the bells of St. Anthony's,
St. John's, St. Casimir's and Brooks Memorial churches tolled.</TE>
<TE>   "As the three caskets were carried to hearses at the railroad
station, the veterans present to pay homage stood at attention" with
tears in their eyes, reported another paper, the Times-Leader Evening
News.</TE>
<TE>   Grandma cried, "Which one is in that one?" as the first casket was
placed in a hearse.</TE>
<TE>   "But the veterans and the undertaker, Andrew Strish, busy with the
task at hand, did not hear her, and no one could give the answer,"
the paper reported</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 12, the Record told the story of the funeral, how "scores
of ex-servicemen" paid their respects and "hundreds of people lined
the streets."</TE>
<TE>   The day the newspaper clippings arrived, my husband came home to
find me crying--the first tears for the uncles I never knew.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   But who were these men?</TE>
<TE>   When the death and burial records arrived, Tom, Danny and Jay
began to take shape.</TE>
<TE>   There were names, ranks, service numbers, dates of induction,
dates of death.</TE>
<TE>   I learned that Jay was inducted in June 1942 at age 27, was
wounded twice and died in September 1944. Tom was 25 when he was
drafted in November 1942; he died of infectious hepatitis a year
later. Danny was inducted in September 1943 and was dead in less than
a year.</TE>
<TE>   There were lists of personal effects. Danny and were infantrymen,
soldiers in the 79th Infantry Division, 315th Regiment; they had what
they could carry and it wasn't much.</TE>
<TE>   Danny had a wallet with 100 francs, a key, 11 souvenir coins and a
religious medal. Jay had with him eight photos, a wallet, a fountain
pen, a greeting card, a religious card, francs, souvenir coins and
his first Purple Heart.</TE>
<TE>   Tom was stationed at a base with the 6th Infantry Division, 1st
Field Artillery, Battery C. There were 200 items on his list, among
them duplicate shaving, sewing and shoeshine kits. There was a
marksmanship badge, a deck of cards, two prayer books and a New
Testament.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, between February and September 2000, I received copies of
my uncles' military service records--some barely legible, many
charred by the 1973 fire.</TE>
<TE>   These papers told me that all three men finished eighth grade. Jay
worked as a pants presser in a clothing factory. Tom was a mechanic's
helper and farmhand; Danny also worked on a farm. They all had brown
hair and ruddy complexions. Jay had blue eyes, Tom's and Danny's were
hazel.</TE>
<TE>   They had money deducted from their pay for "partial support" of
the family. Jay sent home $30 a month, Danny $25 and Tom $20.</TE>
<TE>   Each had money deducted for a $10,000 life insurance policy. I
later found out that my grandmother didn't want the insurance money,
calling it "blood money." Her children, however, persuaded her to
bank it. Thirty years later, it would help pay her nursing home
bills.</TE>
<TE>   All three were thin, but Jay was so tall and skinny--"markedly
undernourished," if I can decipher the doctor's notes on the charred
document. He weighed 124 pounds. Danny was shorter and weighed even
less. The doctor wrote that his hands were "cold, sweaty ... he is
shy ... appears seclusive."</TE>
<TE>   Danny arrived in England in mid-June of 1944. He joined Company A
of the 315th as a replacement on July 14; four days later, he was
dead at 19. The company was in a defensive position near the Ay River
in France; it is not known how he was wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Like Danny, Jay died a private first class, though he had been
busted back to private once because he took a couple of extra days'
leave. Unlike Danny, he survived his first combat, though not for
long.</TE>
<TE>   He hit France's beaches on June 14, 1944, and the unit saw combat
five days later in the assault of Cherbourg. Jay was wounded on July
5 on the Cotentin Peninsula; he suffered a "light head wound" from
cannon fire and was hospitalized. He didn't rejoin the unit until
Aug. 30.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, according to regimental reports, the unit engaged
in "bitter house-to-house fighting for the town of Chatenois ...
casualties were high on both sides with E and F [Jay's unit]
companies suffering the most on our side."</TE>
<TE>   Jay was among them. He died Sept. 16 of a severe head wound.</TE>
<TE>   Tom never saw combat. He was sent to Hawaii in late September 1943
and had been there about a month when he became ill. The autopsy
report said Tom probably had a viral infection when he received his
yellow-fever vaccine, and the two were a deadly combination. His
temperature topped 106 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   He died Nov. 19, 1943, the first of the brothers to perish.</TE>
<TE>   I tried, in vain, to find comrades who served with Danny, Tom and
Jay, and remembered them well. Aside from one who had a vague memory
of Jay as a tall, skinny guy with a helmet three sizes too big, none
could recall them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two years into my search, I still didn't know what my uncles were
like. Were they quiet men like their brother Fran or lively like
their brother Joe? Were they loving men like my father?</TE>
<TE>   On a visit home, I told my mother what I'd been doing.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, Dad asked me about my findings. I showed him
some carefully chosen records. He didn't say much, and left the room.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, he returned, carrying a box.</TE>
<TE>   "Thought you might like to see these," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It was a battered box of memories--photos of my grieving grandma,
flag-waving crowds, the procession. A wooden frame with a picture of
a flag and three gold stars--one for each son.</TE>
<TE>   With that, my father started to tell me about his brothers. And I
began to interview other members of the family.</TE>
<TE>   They told me about Danny, who was every little brother's dream. He
played with Dad and my Uncle Fran, building basement forts and
funhouses. He played baseball and football and shot hoops in the
yard; he was a crack shot with his BB gun. "I'll probably go and get
my leg cut off and I'll be back," he told Fran when he got his draft
notice.</TE>
<TE>   They told me about Jay. "I'll always think of him as a saint,"
Aunt Dorothy said. He was a quiet man, a hard worker who didn't drink
or smoke. Though he didn't dance, he would drive his girlfriend to
dances and wait in the car until it was time to drive her home.</TE>
<TE>   And they told me about Tom, the mischievous one who loved pickles
and playing cards (he was quite good at it) and girls. He was an
altar boy, but he got into some scrapes-- such as the time he broke
into a pool hall when he was in fifth grade, or the times he got
caught smoking or borrowing homework from his buddies.</TE>
<TE>   But "he would give you the shirt off his back," said Uncle Joe.
Tom worked in a garage and on a farm, at restaurants, at Civilian
Conservation Corps camps and at a plant in Connecticut making
bullets. The Army took him even though pneumonia had affected his
lungs.</TE>
<TE>   The telegrams the family received, notifying them of the brothers'
deaths, were sympathetic, in a bureaucratic kind of way: "The
Secretary of War asks that I assure you of his deep sympathy in the
loss of your son Private Thomas J. Baluh."</TE>
<TE>   And a letter in Jay's file: "The significance of his heroic
service to his country will be preserved and commemorated by a
grateful nation."</TE>
<TE>   Fran remembers the messengers who delivered the news. They "came
in quick and left in seconds," he recalled. "They knew what they were
delivering." His sister Dorothy said the telegrams seemed to arrive
one right after another.</TE>
<TE>   When Danny, Jay and Tom came home in their caskets, the procession
paused in front of their old house. "You're home now," their mother
said. "Go ahead in."</TE>
<TE>   Life in that house was never the same.</TE>
<TE>   Al, the fourth brother to serve during the war, retired as a
sergeant in 1952. He would be the last to serve. When my father
received his draft notice during the Korean War, his parents argued
that their son was needed at home and that the Baluh family had given
enough. He was deferred.</TE>
<TE>   My grandmother poured her energy into her home, and baking. The
aroma of bread from her oven would waft through the neighborhood. My
grandfather, though, could not move on. After the boys died, he was
frequently hurt at work, and retired in 1946 when he was in his 50s.
He sat rocking on the porch--"a broken man," Fran said.</TE>
<TE>   He died in 1955.</TE>
<TE>   There are no monuments to the Baluh boys. Their names are included
among the 49 WWII dead on a brass plaque in the borough building.
There is a stained-glass window in St. Stephen's that reads: "In
memory of parents John Sr. &amp; Mary and John Jr., Thomas and Daniel
Baluh."</TE>
<TE>   One miserable winter day, I went to the cemetery, my first visit
since my grandmother died 20 years before. I located the graves the
way we did when I was a kid.</TE>
<TE>   First you find the water faucet, then walk a couple of rows back
and a couple of plots to the left. There they were, with three bronze
military insignias in front of the Baluh headstone flanked by two
stone angels.</TE>
<TE>   I pushed away some dirt and leaves to reveal each flat stone:</TE>

<HD>Senate OKs Budget Hiking Driver Fees</HD>

<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>With a deadline for approving a state budget fast approaching, Senate
lawmakers approved a new spending plan Saturday that would more than
double motorists' vehicle license fees for one year to help close a
$23.6-billion budget gap.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate's Democratic majority got the lone Republican vote it
needed from Sen. Maurice Johannessen (R-Redding) to pass a budget on
a vote of 27-13 and send it over to the Assembly.</LD>
<LD>   Chances of the plan's clearing the Assembly before the start of
the new fiscal year Monday remained unclear, however, after leaders
of the lower house canceled a Saturday session.</LD>
<TE>   The Assembly is scheduled to meet today to consider the plan and a
series of related bills for the first time. The package still faces
several hurdles, including approval by the Assembly and Gov. Gray
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Before casting his vote of support, Johannessen noted that the
spending plan is leaner and relies on less in new tax revenues than
previously proposed by Democrats. He also said it would earmark $75
million to fight fires and $50 million for rural law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   "The alternative to what we're doing here is to decimate rural law
enforcement and fire-suppression services" or to ignore school needs,
Johannessen said. "This is the best budget we can put up."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to including money for rural law enforcement to garner
Johannessen's support, Democrats also helped pave the way for the
establishment of a veterans home in Johannessen's hometown of
Redding.</TE>
<TE>   Relying on New Revenue</TE>
<TE>   The spending package approved by the Senate relies on $3.9 billion
in new revenues and other tax changes, would spend $373 million more
than the plan proposed by Davis and contains a $1-billion reserve,
according to the state's independent Legislative Analyst's Office.
The higher spending is largely the result of lawmakers' desire to
restore a variety of cuts sought by Davis, primarily in the areas of
health and social services.</TE>
<TE>   The plan would increase the vehicle license fees paid by motorists
during the 2003 calendar year to raise nearly $1.3 billion in the new
fiscal year, which starts July 1. Assembly Democrats had sought to
increase the tax for two years, but that plan was dropped Saturday
amid objections by the Davis administration.</TE>
<TE>   California is home to 29.6 million cars, motorcycles, trucks and
trailers that would be subject to the higher fees. The registration
fee has been reduced by slightly more than two-thirds since 1998 in a
series of rebates approved by the Legislature, part of which would be
suspended.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan, the license fee for a 2002 Volvo wagon purchased
for $33,000 would jump from $215 to $497, while someone who paid
$18,000 for a 2000 Ford Explorer would go from paying a fee of $82 to
$190.</TE>
<TE>   The plan also relies on higher state excise taxes levied on
cigarettes than originally sought by Davis. Davis wanted an increase
of 50 cents, while this plan calls for an increase of 63 cents in
August.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Ryan, spokesman for Philip Morris U.S.A., said unintended
consequences of raising state excise taxes on a pack of cigarettes
from 87 cents to $1.50 could include more cigarette smuggling and
counterfeiting.</TE>
<TE>   "Already, more than half the cost of a pack of cigarettes in
California goes to the state or federal governments," Ryan said.
"This type of proposal ironically puts the state in a position of
greater dependence on cigarette excise taxes."</TE>
<TE>   Helping Business</TE>
<TE>   In a nod to California's business community, a Davis proposal to
suspend for two years businesses' ability to deduct so-called "net
operating losses" was modified to let companies claim 80% of the
losses when the suspension ends, as opposed to a scheduled 65%.</TE>
<TE>   Jean Ross, executive director of the California Budget Project, a
group that weighs the effect of budget decisions on low- and
middle-income Californians, estimated the change will translate into
a permanent, $300-million-a-year corporate tax cut.</TE>
<TE>   The spending plan would also delay about $475 million in funding
for schools to the following budget year, which begins July 1, 2003.</TE>
<TE>   During a floor debate on the plan, Senate Budget Committee
Chairman Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) said the spending plan closes the
state's $23.6-billion budget shortfall with $8 billion in loans and
transfers, $13 billion in cuts and the rest in tax increases.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a long way from where we came," Peace said.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a budget," Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks)
said. "This is a tragedy."</TE>
<TE>   McClintock suggested that much of what Peace had described as
spending reductions were actually "Andersen-type" bookkeeping
gimmicks being used by Davis to hide the budget hole.</TE>
<TE>   "Should this pass tonight," added Senate Republican Leader Jim
Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga, "I hope the Assembly will stop it."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to new taxes, Assembly Democrats and Republicans
remain at odds over several budget-related proposals that touch on
education funding. But the Senate took action to end the standoff
Saturday by approving a pair of measures that diminish the need for
Republican support for a key education funding measure.</TE>
<TE>   Davis is seeking to transfer $1.7 billion in education funding
between the current fiscal year and the upcoming one to help balance
the budget. Assembly Republicans have withheld their support on the
proposal in a bid to garner Democratic support for a plan to earmark
$400 million in the 2003-04 fiscal year to equalize funding among
schools.</TE>
<TE>   More Money for Schools</TE>
<TE>   But the Senate on Saturday approved a pair of measures that
reappropriates $1.7 billion to the California State University system
and allows the money to be spent on community colleges and public
schools.</TE>
<TE>   The measures require only a majority vote, which means no
Republican support is required to approve them.</TE>
<TE>   "They knew their plan had no Republican support, so they changed
the rules," said Peter DeMarco, a spokesman for Assembly Republican
Leader Dave Cox (R-Fair Oaks).</TE>
<TE>   "The question now is whether the maneuver is legal."</TE>

<HD>Secession Backers Off to Slow Start</HD>
<DH>Campaign: As mayor pulls in money and support, Valley and
Hollywood leaders are still mapping strategy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leaders of the move to break up Los Angeles have been slow to get
political campaigns started, falling behind their opponents in
organization, fund-raising and endorsements.</LD>
<LD>   The grass-roots efforts to form new cities in the San Fernando
Valley and Hollywood are struggling to build a campaign structure.
The Valley group has just sent out its first fund-raising letter and
has yet to schedule a rally.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, secession proponents have been conducting what might be
called a living-room war, attending coffee klatches, community
meetings and local festivals to make their case. In this way, they
hope to play tortoise to Mayor James K. Hahn's hare, crawling
steadily toward a November victory while opponents, led by the mayor,
grow cocky and careless.</LD>
<TE>   But leaders of the secession campaigns concede they will have to
use more conventional--and expensive--means to reach enough voters in
a city the size of Los Angeles, including television and radio
advertising. On this front, they say, work has just begun.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Hahn, with sophisticated political machinery at his
disposal, has been on the stump nearly every day.</TE>
<TE>   He pulled in more than $200,000 at a fund-raising dinner last
week. He drew 700 union members and other supporters to a rally in
Sherman Oaks last weekend and addressed a downtown crowd of 1,000
Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   At one event after another, Hahn has been telling voters that the
secession measures on the Nov. 5 ballot would mean financial ruin for
Los Angeles and the proposed cities, a claim that supporters say is
groundless. He also has picked up a broad range of anti-secession
endorsements--from the man he beat in last year's mayoral campaign,
Antonio Villaraigosa, to the state and local Democratic Party, to a
coalition of African American leaders, among others.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor obviously has a decided edge," said Hollywood secession
leader Gene LaPietra. "He's using city employees and city resources
to wage a 24/7 campaign with taxpayer dollars."</TE>
<TE>   On the other side, in the weeks since the Local Agency Formation
Commission voted to put secession proposals on the ballot, supporters
have been trying to woo contributors and convert their group of
mostly political amateurs into a force capable of taking on some of
the most sophisticated campaign strategists in California.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with some money finally in hand (they won't say how much),
Valley secession supporters have hired a professional organizer and a
fund-raising consultant. They also plan to begin distributing
pamphlets in the next couple of weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "We have spent the time sharpening the edges of our organization,"
said Richard Katz, the former state assemblyman who chairs the Valley
pro-secession campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Katz and others say summer is a slow time in politics, when
campaigns shore up their base and plan for the fall. And even without
an aggressive outreach plan, the message of smaller and more
responsive city government has spread via news media and
neighbor-to-neighbor, secession advocates say.</TE>
<TE>   But the mayor, who has a built-in political base and campaign
workers in place from his last election, has a huge advantage, said
Sacramento political consultant David Townsend.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got his organization, and he's moving," Townsend said.
"That's a tremendous head start over the rebel forces there that are
trying to get organized."</TE>
<TE>   Add to that the mayor's apparent fund-raising lead--Hahn said he
intends to wage a $5-million campaign--and the fight for secession
will be an uphill one indeed, Townsend said.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's camp feels so certain of victory, one insider said, that he
has decided he doesn't need to take a stand on a proposed ballot
measure that would organize Los Angeles into boroughs--even though
many believe that such a plan could win votes from secession
advocates.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor is addressing ever-larger groups, and his rallies have
the flavor of old-fashioned politics.</TE>
<TE>   At the labor rally last weekend, dozens of people queued up behind
a bullhorn, waiting for the chance to shout their names and pledge to
work against secession.</TE>
<TE>   But in the coffee-klatch war, hardly a meeting ends without
residents coming up to Katz and offering to help.</TE>
<TE>   At a meeting of the Pacific Palisades Democratic Club last Sunday,
a group so liberal that some of its members are trying to revive the
nuclear freeze movement of the early 1980s, Joan Reitzel told Katz he
had her vote.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to vote for it," said Reitzel, who lives in Venice and
is angry that her Los Angeles council district was eliminated and
merged with that of the Palisades.</TE>
<TE>   If the Valley secedes and the city is smaller, Reitzel reasoned,
her community will get its own district once again.</TE>
<TE>   "Come and join us," Laurette Healey, an openly gay Sherman Oaks
resident who is running for a city council seat on the Valley
secession ballot, told members of the Stonewall Democratic Club in
North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Goddard, political strategist for the secession campaigns,
said that Katz and others have spoken at 30 community meetings in the
last month or so, with 50 more scheduled for July and August. They
will address audiences ranging in size from a dozen people in a
living room to 100 or 200 in a community hall, Goddard said.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly in the Valley, he said, this is the way the campaign
will be waged at least through the summer: in a careful slog from
group to group, house to house, known in the world of electoral
politics as a "retail" campaign, where individual voters, rather than
a mass audience, are the targets.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a community-based movement with broad-based grass-roots
support, so that's where most of our visible activities are going to
be," Goddard said. "That's going to be the tone of our campaign until
we get into the fall, when we'll start using more mass media and paid
media."</TE>
<TE>   Goddard said he does not believe the secession movement lost
ground in the last month.</TE>
<TE>   "In the best of all possible worlds, the LAFCO process would have
been completed in early spring so we could have moved into campaign
mode a little quicker," Goddard said. "But given the calendar, I'm
very pleased with where we are now."</TE>
<TE>   In the last week, Valley secession advocates have begun to train
volunteers to walk precincts and participate in debates. They also
announced endorsements from half a dozen Valley chambers of commerce.
The letter sent to 25,000 prospective donors marked the start of a
fund-raising drive whose goal is $4 million.</TE>
<TE>   In Hollywood, secession proponents will continue to focus on the
neighbor-to-neighbor strategy over the summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Hollywood is a small community. We can actually get enough
volunteers to go door-to-door," LaPietra said.</TE>
<TE>   Roy Behr, a Democratic political consultant based in West Los
Angeles, said it was appropriate for the pro-secession campaigns to
take time to reorganize before embarking on a major outreach effort.</TE>
<TE>   Between now and Labor Day, Behr said, it will be important for
both sides to do the kind of painstaking, person-to-person outreach
that will bring in a flood of volunteers and money for the fall
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we're in the prolonged period of time when both campaigns
need to do infrastructure and strategizing and research," Behr said.
"The vast majority of communication with voters doesn't take place
until the last moment."</TE>

<HD>Kroeker 'Wants to Lead' LAPD</HD>
<DH>Speech: Portland police chief, runner-up to Parks in '97,
says he's 'ready to come home.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Portland, Ore., Police Chief Mark Kroeker said Saturday that he is
"ready to come home" to be Los Angeles' next police chief.</LD>
<LD>   "I hope that you'll have me," Kroeker, a former deputy chief of
the LAPD, told members of the National Alliance for Positive Action,
a nonprofit advocacy organization based in Inglewood. "I am ready to
occupy a very, very difficult, challenging position in a very
challenging time."</LD>
<LD>   The breakfast round-table meeting Saturday capped a four-day visit
to Los Angeles, part of Kroeker's ongoing efforts to become chief--a
job for which he was runner-up in 1997, when Bernard Parks was
chosen.</LD>
<TE>   Kroeker worked for the LAPD for 32 years before retiring in 1997
to supervise the reconstruction of police agencies in Bosnia. He
became Portland's police chief in December 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking before 25 members of the alliance, Kroeker described his
childhood in what was then the Belgian Congo as the son of
missionaries. From his parents, he learned the merit of helping
others--a quality he said he brings to his job as a police officer.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, I come as a servant," Kroeker said. "I come as a person
that wants to help, that wants to serve, that wants to lead. There is
a need for leadership in our city and in our police department."</TE>
<TE>   Kroeker described his three biggest goals for the LAPD as a
reduction in crime, an improvement in the quality of life for the
citizens of Los Angeles, and a positive working relationship between
the citizens and the police.</TE>
<TE>   Having a diversified police department with the best technology
available is inherent in accomplishing those goals, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the discussion, Kroeker advocated community policing as
the best way to address crime in the city. Alliance members expressed
concern about gang presence in their neighborhoods, the "code of
silence" within the ranks of the LAPD, and the need for police
training to recognize the mentally ill and homeless as patients
rather than criminals.</TE>
<TE>   Asked by alliance President Earl Ofari Hutchinson about racial
profiling, Kroeker said the issue must be addressed by the department
"forthrightly and with vigor."</TE>
<TE>   Kroeker made the case for his appointment to the chief's job based
on his own familiarity with the city and its challenges. He called
Los Angeles the "ancestral home" of his policing career.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been here before," he said. "I have walked here before."</TE>
<TE>   Kroeker said he has been told that applications for the post will
be accepted between Monday and July 19. A headhunting firm will
winnow down the number of candidates and present a list to the Police
Commission in early August, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The commission will present the mayor with a list of three
finalists, in ranked order, in mid-August, and the mayor is expected
to send his choice to the City Council for a confirmation vote in
early September, Kroeker said.</TE>
<TE>   Alliance member Laura Castro said the group has invited all major
candidates for the police chief's job to its round-table series. Art
Lopez, chief of the Oxnard Police Department, will appear before the
group next week.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview after the forum, Kroeker said he has been meeting
with city leaders and community groups in an effort to raise his
profile and to address any potential drawbacks to his application for
the job before the Police Commission considers candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Kroeker said he has paid particular attention to making inroads
with the gay, lesbian and transgender community. He came under fire
two years ago after a video surfaced in which he called homosexuality
"a perversion." Kroeker has since said that his views have changed
and he would not tolerate any bias in the department.</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, much of his visit to L.A. has been spent learning
what is important to the communities served by the LAPD. "By coming
and talking and listening, I am making sure I have a good grasp of
the issues," Kroeker said. "I made a lot of mental notes about what
issues are important to people."</TE>

<HD>Allegations Fuel Fear, Strife in Orange County D.A.'s
Office</HD>
<DH>Justice: Tension and disputes worsen after grand jury
criticizes district attorney.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Veteran Orange County homicide prosecutor Mike Jacobs and his two
colleagues built their case methodically and in total secrecy. By
February 2001, they were ready to move.</LD>
<LD>   The subject of their investigation wasn't a murder suspect or drug
kingpin, but their own boss, Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas.</LD>
<LD>   The three prosecutors flew to Sacramento and presented their
dossier at the state attorney general's office. It accused Rackauckas
of intervening in criminal investigations involving campaign
contributors, misusing public funds and punishing enemies inside his
office.</LD>
<TE>   Their effort didn't result in an immediate investigation. But the
allegations eventually helped spark a grand jury probe that ended
last week with a report that accused Rackauckas of interfering in
cases involving political supporters, punishing foes and mismanaging
California's third-largest district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   To his critics, the report finally sheds light on his behavior. To
his supporters, it's filled with the lies of political enemies. But
one thing is clear: Fear and political infighting divide the district
attorney's office, and the grand jury report seems only to have
worsened tensions.</TE>
<TE>   "The walls have ears," said one veteran prosecutor who has tried
to remain neutral. "No one says anything anymore, good or bad. I
mean, would you?"</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't supposed to be this way. Rackauckas was first elected in
1998 by a wide margin, with support from both Republican and
Democratic leaders. But within a few months, several top managers in
the office had turned against him and an atmosphere of unease and
political retribution set in, according to interviews and grand jury
findings.</TE>
<TE>   Early on, Rackauckas ordered staff to search the computer hard
drives of political opponents in the office. Office investigators
were sent to stake out Rackauckas' adult son's house in Riverside
County and to search for the boyfriend of one of his top lieutenant's
daughters. He continued a close friendship with Newport Beach
businessman Patrick DiCarlo, who had been the subject of probes by
organized crime investigators from the district attorney's
office--even giving him a gun for his birthday.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, according to the grand jury, Rackauckas "set the wrong
tone, which continues to the present, that loyalty to the district
attorney, personally, is of prime importance, as compared to loyalty
and dedication of prosecutors to the district attorney's office and
its mission."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some of Rackauckas' former top managers said they quickly learned
that their boss put a premium on loyalty.</TE>
<TE>   At one of his first management meetings, Rackauckas carried a list
with 15 names, all young prosecutors he wanted to fire because they
had been hired by his predecessor. His staff talked him out of it,
according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   In January 1999, his first month on the job, Rackauckas told
managers once loyal to the previous district attorney that they were
no longer welcome in the office and placed some of them on leave.</TE>
<TE>   "Right from the get-go, from the top down, there was a spirit of
ill will and meanness," said Chris Evans, a former senior manager for
Rackauckas who resigned in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas has maintained these early critics of his
administration created much of the tension. He said they did not want
to go along with the radical changes he wanted to make and became
disgruntled when they didn't receive the jobs and authority they
believed they deserved.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole thing began with a series of complaints that were
politically motivated, and that's how it was driven all the way
through," Rackauckas said in an interview last week.</TE>
<TE>   One of those disillusioned was Jacobs. He was one of Rackauckas'
strongest supporters during the election and was given the plum job
of running the office's elite homicide prosecution team. But after he
was on the job a year, Rackauckas transferred him.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs and others said they became troubled by the way their boss
ran the office.</TE>
<TE>   One point of contention was a nonprofit charity Rackauckas founded
to help counsel troubled teens. Two of Rackauckas' campaign donors
ended up with police-style badges that identified them as Orange
County district attorney "commissioners" because of their work with
the charity, according to the grand jury report.</TE>
<TE>   When Rackauckas ordered investigators to conduct background checks
on potential "commissioners," some prosecutors in the office
privately accused their boss of misusing office resources.</TE>
<TE>   Another source of concern: Rackauckas' relationship with DiCarlo,
the businessman who had been investigated previously by the district
attorney's office but never charged with a crime.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after he was sworn in as district attorney, Rackauckas
celebrated with a dinner party at DiCarlo's estate on the Newport
Beach coast.</TE>
<TE>   A few months later, DiCarlo invited Rackauckas back to the house
and told him he was receiving threats related to a business deal.
Rackauckas ordered his organized crime unit to investigate. But when
DiCarlo complained that one investigator was treating him like a
crime suspect, Rackauckas ordered the investigator off the case.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, Rackauckas presented DiCarlo with a birthday
gift--a Glock 9-millimeter handgun, according to the grand jury's
report. DiCarlo later obtained a concealed-weapons permit from
Sheriff Mike Carona, a move that allowed him to carry a gun at all
times. According to the grand jury, DiCarlo said he carried the gun
to protect himself from district attorney's investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas says those grand jury findings are "false and
ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   Another source of discord was Rackauckas' involvement in a massive
consumer protection case.</TE>
<TE>   The case centered around the Arnel apartment management company
operated by billionaire businessman George Argyros, whom President
Bush recently named ambassador to Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors filed a complaint against Arnel in February 2001,
seeking millions of dollars in restitution for tenants they believed
unfairly lost security deposits. Rackauckas ordered his deputies to
withdraw the lawsuit, which they did. He then took over negotiations
without his prosecutors' knowledge, the grand jury concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Both Arnel and the company's lawyer, Allan Stokke, had contributed
to Rackauckas' 1998 campaign. In the months before that election,
Stokke hosted a fund-raiser at the Balboa Bay Club that generated
more than $30,000 for Rackauckas, the report noted.</TE>
<TE>   To Jacobs and other prosecutors in the office, Rackauckas' actions
seemed improper. A few weeks later, Jacobs met with senior state
lawyers in the offices of Attorney General Bill Lockyer.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't something I liked doing. I felt I had a duty to pass it
on," Jacobs said.</TE>
<TE>   Two months after the trip, Rackauckas served Jacobs with
termination papers. The former homicide unit supervisor filed a
wrongful termination lawsuit against Rackauckas. The suit is pending.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas eventually withdrew from the Arnel case and allowed
state prosecutors to take over. Several months later, Arnel agreed to
pay $1.5 million to settle the case. Rackauckas said the settlement
was for less money than he was seeking--proof, he said, that he was
not playing favorites.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney strongly disputes many characterizations in
the report and vows to set the record straight with a detailed
response.</TE>
<TE>   "From what I understand, [the testimony] was largely opinion and
conjecture. Every time there was a rumor at the water cooler, there
was testimony about it before the grand jury," Rackauckas said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Many of the issues raised in the report have been public for
months. Wally Wade, a deputy district attorney, made Rackauckas'
actions in the DiCarlo and Arnel cases centerpieces of his campaign
to oust his boss earlier this year. Before the election, Rackauckas
also closed down his foundation as part of a settlement with the
state attorney general's office, which concluded that its finances
were mismanaged.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County voters reelected Rackauckas in a landslide victory.</TE>
<TE>   After the election, Rackauckas announced that Wade and six other
prosecutors who opposed his reelection would be moved out of the
district attorney's office and into a new separate family support
unit that will soon become a state agency, no longer part of the
district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury's report left Wade feeling vindicated. Rackauckas
supporters said they don't expect it to have a lasting impact, in the
office or with the public.</TE>
<TE>   But hopes that tensions in the office might be easing were dashed
Friday with a new controversy. One deputy sent out an e-mail Friday
imploring his colleagues to sign a letter supporting their boss.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Chris Kralick, head of the union that
represents the office's 245 line prosecutors, immediately complained
that the solicited support could have a chilling effect in the
office. Those who didn't sign, he feared, could face retaliation.</TE>

<HD>Dry Cycle May Spin On for Years</HD>
<DH>Weather: Region's drought could be auguring a longer trend,
scientists warn.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If it doesn't rain tonight, and it almost certainly won't, Los
Angeles will have just completed its driest year in history.</LD>
<LD>   And at least one expert says that this could be only the
beginning, that Southern California and the rest of the Southwest may
be experiencing the onset of dry weather that could last a decade or
more.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think any El Nino's going to come riding in on a white
horse and drop a lot of rain that'll rescue us from this drought,"
said Bill Patzert, an oceanographic meteorologist from the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. "It looks like we're in for a
long, dry spell."</LD>
<TE>   Rainfall at the Civic Center since July 1, 2001, has been a scant
4.42 inches, less than a third of normal and the least that has
fallen on Los Angeles since they started keeping records in 1877.</TE>
<TE>   But is this a drought? That depends on your point of view.</TE>
<TE>   If you're a firefighter, it's a drought, all right. Wildfires
already are crackling throughout Southern California, Arizona, New
Mexico and southern Colorado, fueled by brush and trees desiccated by
a four-year stretch of dry weather. This year's is one of the
earliest fire seasons ever, and it promises to be one of the longest
and most devastating.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in this business 28 years, and I've never seen it so
bad," said Donald R. Feser, a U.S. Forest Service fire chief in the
Angeles National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   Ranchers and farmers dependent on timely rains for livestock feed
and grain crops call it a drought, too.</TE>
<TE>   "All the range-land guys are hurting," said Rob Frost, a cattle
rancher in the hills north of Santa Paula. "It probably will force
some people out of business."</TE>
<TE>   But for typical urban residents of the Los Angeles Basin, it may
not seem like a drought at all.</TE>
<TE>   Meteorologists say the lack of rain we're experiencing now is due
to a shift in the high-altitude jet stream winds that propel most
storm systems from west to east in the northern hemisphere.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California usually gets most of its rain between
September and March, when the jet stream tends to drift far enough
south to drive these storms into the coastal mountains that stretch
from Point Conception to the Mexican border, dropping rain in the
valleys and snow at higher elevations.</TE>
<TE>   This year, according to Tim McClung, a National Weather Service
meteorologist, a persistent ridge of high pressure stalled over
Northern California and the Great Basin, deflecting the jet
stream--and the storms that ride it--farther north than usual.</TE>
<TE>   The result: Rainfall figures shrink the farther south you go. San
Francisco received about the normal amount of rain; San Luis Obispo
got 67%; Santa Barbara, 50%; Los Angeles, 29%; and some areas near
the Salton Sea, about 4%.</TE>
<TE>   By itself, this year's drought is troubling enough. But if
Patzert's theory is right--and Kelly Redmond, a research
meteorologist at the Western Regional Climate Center in Reno, says it
could be--the shortfalls are part of a prolonged dry cycle that could
be cause for major concern, especially for those firefighters and
dry-land farmers.</TE>
<TE>   Studying records that stretch back more than a century, the two
men have concluded that there are multiple cyclical phenomena in the
Pacific Ocean--driven by forces not yet fully understood--that may
have enormous influence over whether the weather is wet or dry in
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   One phenomenon is the familiar El Nino-La Nina cycle,
characterized by fluctuating surface ocean temperatures in the
eastern equatorial Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   During El Ninos, when these temperatures are relatively warm, the
high-pressure ridges drift east, the jet stream drifts south and
Southern California sometimes gets much heavier rain than usual. An
example was the winter of 1997-98, when more than 31 inches of rain
fell on Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   During La Ninas, when the equatorial surface temperatures are
relatively cool, the high-pressure ridges stall, the jet stream is
deflected north and Southern California almost always gets less rain
than usual.</TE>
<TE>   El Ninos and La Ninas occur at irregular intervals and seldom last
more than a year or two. After the drenching El Nino winter of
1997-98, the cycle reversed, and the next two seasons were both La
Ninas, with below-normal totals of 9.12 and then 11.57 inches of rain
in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The 2000-2001 season, with 17.94 inches in Los Angeles, was
somewhat above normal, but Patzert considers that a local anomaly
since most other cities in Southern California were at or below
normal.</TE>
<TE>   And then came this year, the driest year ever. And it was neither
El Nino nor La Nina.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, there are other forces at work," Patzert said.</TE>
<TE>   These other forces, he said, apparently include a much longer
cyclical phenomenon, rooted in the surface water temperatures farther
north of the equator, known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.</TE>
<TE>   Patzert said that in the positive phase, these surface waters tend
to cool in the north; in the negative phase, they tend to warm. He
said these oscillations, which apparently affect the flow of ocean
and wind currents, may influence weather in Los Angeles and the
Southwest for periods that last as long as 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   "In the 1950s and 1960s, rainfall was generally less than normal,"
he said. "That was a negative phase. There was a positive phase in
the '80s and '90s. But after the El Nino of '97-'98, we went back
into another negative phase, and I think we're in that now. These
negative phases, coupled with La Ninas, are the demon divas of
drought."</TE>
<TE>   While the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has
predicted another moderate El Nino next winter, Patzert said, any
tendency that might have to increase rainfall probably will be
overridden by the negative oscillation.</TE>
<TE>   "This negative oscillation could last another five or six years,
maybe even longer," Patzert said. "There might be a wet year here and
there, but overall, it looks pretty dry."</TE>
<TE>   Redmond is more cautious.</TE>
<TE>   "Are we getting back to a period, like the '50s and '60s, when it
was generally drier than normal? That's an open question," Redmond
said. The period during which detailed data have been
collected--mostly since World War II--is still too short to
extrapolate with great confidence. State water officials argue that
Patzert's theory is based largely on conjecture.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no hard evidence that permits you to forecast that far
ahead," said Jeanine Jones, an engineer with the state's Department
of Water Resources.</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service's Feser isn't looking beyond this year. He's
concerned with the here and now. He said he knew there was trouble as
far back as Easter, when a small blaze started in Susana Canyon, in
the Angeles National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   "The humidity was low and the winds weren't bad, but that fire
spread rapidly over more than 100 acres," he said. "When a fire burns
that well on a day not conducive to extreme fire behavior, that's a
bad sign."</TE>
<TE>   Feser said the problem was an extraordinarily low level of
moisture in the brush that burned.</TE>
<TE>   Under formulas used by firefighting agencies, the weight of that
moisture is compared with the weight of the plant's dry, woody
fibers. The ratio is expressed in percentages--100% would mean the
moisture in a plant equaled the weight of the fibers. Because plants
are like sponges, they can absorb more than their dry weight, so
figures over 100% are possible.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally, that brush would be at about 150% by now, but it's
already down to between 70% and 80%," Feser said. "We consider 65%
the critical level, and we're almost there already. By the end of the
summer, it'll be down to 50%, low enough to kill the whole plant. At
that level, brush burns like gasoline."</TE>
<TE>   Dave Franz, a spokesman for the California Farm Bureau Federation,
a nonprofit lobbying group representing about 95,000 farmers in the
state, said the lack of rain in Southern California has cut back
natural forage about 95% in Ventura County, where Frost runs his
cattle. Riverside County farmers dependent on rain for their grain
crops are hard hit, Franz said.</TE>
<TE>   But Franz said most of the farmers in California--by far the
largest agricultural state in the nation, with revenues in 2000 of
more than $35 billion--either are situated far enough north to have
had ample rain or have plenty of irrigating water.</TE>
<TE>   And in Los Angeles, suburban lawns are likely to remain green.
Because of what well may be the largest and most sophisticated water
catchment, storage and delivery systems on Earth, Southern
Californians should have plenty of water to keep their crops green
all summer long. Thanks to ample supplies transported hundreds of
miles from wetter areas, the likelihood of water rationing in most of
Southern California is virtually nil.</TE>
<TE>   Jones of the water resources department said that 60% of Southern
California's water supply is from elsewhere, brought in by the State
Water Project, the Los Angeles Aqueduct and aqueducts from the
Colorado River. The other 40%, she said, comes mostly from
groundwater basins in Southern California that remain in pretty good
shape.</TE>
<TE>   "Rainfall in the north is close to normal, so there's plenty of
water for the state Water Project," she said. "The Owens Valley is
drier than normal, but the L.A. Aqueduct (which draws its water from
the Owens Valley) is a pretty small contributor. The Colorado Basin
storage system is down to 70% of capacity, but it's a huge system,
capable of storing four times the average annual flow."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Jones said, the water supply in Southern California looks
adequate, except for a few mountain communities, like Idyllwild, that
are dependent solely on rainfall for their water.</TE>
<TE>   "There shouldn't be any major problems," she said.</TE>

<HD>Flynn, Latinos Head Into Political Divide</HD>
<DH>Government: An ethnic shift is rippling through the veteran
supervisor's Oxnard-based district and elsewhere in the county.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The feud that erupted between veteran Ventura County Supervisor John
Flynn and a coalition of Latino leaders in Oxnard last week is more
than just a spat between an intemperate politician and his critics.</LD>
<LD>   Charges that Flynn threatened Irma Lopez, the wife of Oxnard's
mayor, are an outgrowth of both his notoriously quick temper and the
changing ethnic face of Oxnard politics.</LD>
<LD>   Latinos, steadily marching toward majority status in Ventura
County, are pushing for more political clout. This is especially true
in Oxnard, the county's biggest city, where Latinos make up 62% of
its 170,000 inhabitants.</LD>
<TE>   Oxnard's transition from a white-dominated city to one run by
Latinos mirrors a broader transition of California from a
white-dominated state to one that no longer has a racial or ethnic
majority. Cities up and down the state, particularly those in the
farm labor areas of the San Joaquin Valley, are increasingly being
run by Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   In a narrower sense, as with Flynn, it's also a story of
politicians who have run communities for decades being displaced by a
new generation of elected leaders of a different ethnicity. That
tinges the usual political animosities with a racial flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn threw down the gauntlet last week by announcing he would
likely run for an eighth term in 2004. That puts him in conflict with
Oxnard community leaders, who thought they had his promise to step
down after his current term expires.</TE>
<TE>   "The politics have to do with who is going to replace John Flynn,"
said Hank Lacayo, former chairman of the county's Democratic Party.
"Whether he runs or not is his choice, but there are some folks who
are anxious about having that happen."</TE>
<TE>   Latinos now make up an estimated 20% of those holding elective
office on the county's school boards and city councils. That is a
doubling of representation over the past decade.</TE>
<TE>   The change has not always come easily.</TE>
<TE>   Bitter divisions between white members of the Santa Paula City
Council and the city's Latino leaders led to the filing of a federal
voting rights lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice. The lawsuit
alleged that the city's at-large voting system had perpetuated racial
discrimination by preventing Latino candidates from being elected to
the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   The ordeal cost Santa Paula $500,000 in legal fees and was settled
last year when the city agreed to allow voters to decide this
November whether to maintain at-large elections or switch to a
district system.</TE>
<TE>   In Fillmore, where the potential for enmity was equal to that of
Santa Paula, the transition has been somewhat smoother. Two Latino
council members have been elected without race-baiting.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard's City Council also has Latino members, John Zaragoza and
Mayor Manuel Lopez. The other members are Bedford Pinkard, who is
black, and Tom Holden and Dean Maulhardt, white sons of pioneer
families.</TE>
<TE>   Change has come more quickly to education boards. In 1990, there
were two Latinos on the Rio Elementary School District board. Today
the five-member board is made up entirely of Latinos in a district
where 80% of students are Latino.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, the Rio board hired Yolanda Benitez as superintendent,
the first Latina to hold such a position in Ventura County. Today,
four school district chiefs are Latino, including Oxnard Elementary's
Richard Duarte.</TE>
<TE>   Art Hernandez, who was elected to the Rio board in 1991, said
community leaders realized that if they shared information and got
help from mentors, they could take on leadership roles.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an exciting time," said Hernandez, who is now a trustee of
the Ventura County Community College District. "We were finally
coming together and bringing together different resources. It wasn't
that we wanted to hire Latinos or install them in office. It was not
just a Latino vision; it was a community vision. Part of the
responsibility for the Latino community is to take on the leadership
roles."</TE>
<TE>   Irma Lopez, an influential Democratic fund-raiser, said she looks
at the individual's character and position on the issues when
deciding whom to back.</TE>
<TE>   "We all bring our life experiences to the table," Lopez said. "But
we have had wonderful people who don't look at race, who don't see
color. And whoever wins [the upcoming supervisors' race] will win on
the issue of what is good for the community."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said that Flynn shouted, "I'm gonna get you!" as he was
leaving a recent Democratic barbecue. Flynn denied making those
comments. He said Lopez and other Latino leaders are trying to
discredit him so they can fill his seat with a Latino.</TE>
<TE>   Many people believe Flynn has done a stand-up job for the Latino
community in his 26 years of service. He has long been a champion of
civil rights issues, has pushed for farm-worker housing and is known
for promptly responding to complaints by constituents.</TE>
<TE>   The fair-skinned 69-year-old of Irish ancestry learned Spanish so
he could better converse with the residents of his district, Lacayo
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because you happen to have a Hispanic last name doesn't mean
you are the best person running," he said. "I'm a Latino. If we ask
for diversity, we ought to practice it."</TE>
<TE>   Flynn acknowledges the changing politics and the likelihood that
the 5th District will one day be governed by a Latino supervisor. But
he wants to be the one who decides when he should leave.</TE>
<TE>   "If I go by the vast majority of people [in my district], my
strength is very deep," he said. "It's up to the people if I run and
not the politicians. And a lot of people have been telling me I
should."</TE>

<HD>Center Helps Women Find Peace of Mind in Art</HD>
<DH>A screenwriter's vision of a place free from family cares
grows into a key resource for those trying to turn their lives
around.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARIOT LOUIMA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was envisioned as their room, a quiet retreat for women to explore
artistic endeavors without the stresses of their homes.</LD>
<LD>   Screenwriter Wendy Cooper-Porcelli wanted it to be a "room of
their own," where women could write fiction and poetry, paint, take
pictures or learn to edit videos.</LD>
<LD>   Virginia Woolf's 1929 book "A Room of One's Own," a collection of
lectures the author had given on women in fiction, played heavily in
Cooper-Porcelli's decision to found the Women's Multimedia Center in
Claremont. Woolf's theme was the need of such women for private
space.</LD>
<TE>   "It struck me, being a young mother of two small children at the
time," said Cooper-Porcelli, 37, who now has four children. "I guess
it caused some sort of epiphany in me. I so needed my own space."</TE>
<TE>   In time, the center would exceed her vision.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of simply being a space for women interested in learning
and art, the center has become the headquarters of many such
"rooms"--seminars and workshops held at group homes and shelters for
women who are struggling to get back on their feet.</TE>
<TE>   Judy, for example, attended Women's Multimedia Center classes
while at a women's shelter in Pomona.</TE>
<TE>   Judy had never written about her feelings before then, she said,
but the words came easily to her, and she was able to make sense of a
traumatic childhood while learning to reconcile her sexuality with
her image of God.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it was extremely painful and emotional, and like a
relief, in a way," said Judy, 47, who asked that her last name not be
used to protect her privacy.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of it still doesn't make sense," she added, "but other stuff
came together nicely."</TE>
<TE>   The Women's Multimedia Center, in a building painted royal blue
with terra-cotta trim, opened in September 1999 with an art exhibit
featuring works by local women.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, organizers and volunteers have spent most of their
time teaching classes outside the building--at women's shelters,
group homes for parolees, continuation schools for troubled teens and
detention camps for youth offenders.</TE>
<TE>   Focus on Older Women</TE>
<TE>   There aren't many other programs like this one, according to
officials at Community Partners, a Los Angeles-based organization
that helps nonprofits in their first years of operation. Annually,
about 44 organizations countywide join the Community Partners
network.</TE>
<TE>   Most programs with multimedia elements focus on young
people--among them PF Bresee Foundation in Los Angeles and Community
Digital Initiative at UC Riverside. But the Claremont center
specializes in older women, often those in transition.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Rodriguez, a professor with the Claremont Colleges and center
co-founder, facilitates a weekly session at Crossroads, a group home
for women on parole. Sessions vary from open discussions, to watching
and critiquing movies and recording video diaries.</TE>
<TE>   "We watch a lot of movies with strong female roles in them," said
Robin Steffen, a resident staff member at Crossroads, who spent six
months as a client before getting a job at the facility. Steffen, who
once served a three-year prison sentence for receiving stolen
property and drug possession, said the program tries to show women
"that they aren't powerless."</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of women come here thinking, 'I only know how to work the
streets. I only know how to use drugs,' " she said. "There's a vast
world out there."</TE>
<TE>   Another program working with the center is Prototypes of Pomona,
which offers psychological treatment and group therapy sessions to
battered women and those addicted to drugs and alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   Judy, who spent 13 months at Prototypes after suffering a nervous
breakdown, said the classes helped her to develop "tools for life."</TE>
<TE>   After growing up in a strict Christian household, Judy struggled
in her young adult life to come to terms with her homosexuality. When
she was 16, she told her mother she was a lesbian, and was sent to
therapy.</TE>
<TE>   "I always had a problem with religion," Judy said. "I had this
thing with God, because I always thought I was going to hell.
Homosexuality was the ultimate sin. At least that's what I'd been
taught."</TE>
<TE>   Judy said she couldn't deal with a precarious relationship with
her father, who, until she was older, never had much to say to her.
And most of her childhood memories--everything that happened before
she was 12--remain a blur.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have the tools to deal with life," she said. "The only
way I knew how to deal with the pain was through drinking."</TE>
<TE>   Judy's breakdown took place in early 2000. She had ended a
long-term relationship and lost her business and her house. In the
end, she checked into Prototypes.</TE>
<TE>   "The therapy was great," Judy said of her experiences at
Prototypes. "But the writing gave me a whole new insight into myself.
It wouldn't have worked if I didn't do the writing."</TE>
<TE>   Poetry has allowed her to release emotions: "Why does everything
happen so quickly in the minds of the insane/ There and back/ Only to
be returned to the un-breathable sameness that caused the sickness to
begin."</TE>
<TE>   Founder Funds Center</TE>
<TE>   Since the Women's Multimedia Center opened, it has existed on a
budget of $35,000 a year, most of which comes from Cooper-Porcelli.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper-Porcelli was able to work out a deal with the landlord so
that, instead of paying rent, the organization foots the bill for all
building renovations, which have amounted to $45,000. The rest of the
budget goes to supplies and equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The center is writing grant proposals to help pay operating
expenses.</TE>
<TE>   But even without the extra help, Cooper-Porcelli said, she'd
continue to fund the center. "It's not easy, but it's a priority,"
she said. "I just don't get to treat myself to some things, like
shopping sprees or trips."</TE>
<TE>   "It's worth it to me," she said later. "It's worth my money and my
time."</TE>

<HD>Autistic Girl, 5, Is Hit, Killed by SUV</HD>
<DH>Fatality: She is struck after slipping out of her Laguna
Niguel home and entering a busy street. The driver, who didn't stop,
is sought.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 5-year-old autistic girl was struck and killed late Friday near her
Laguna Niguel home by a sport-utility vehicle that left the scene,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   "We're wondering why the driver didn't stop," said Orange County
Sheriff's Sgt. Steve Doan. "I don't know if it's a case of the driver
not knowing that he or she struck a child. We won't know until we
question the driver."</LD>
<LD>   The girl, Mya Richard, died hours afterward at Mission Hospital
Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo. An autopsy completed
Saturday revealed that Mya died of blunt-force trauma, coroner's
officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities said Mya, wearing only a diaper, slipped out of the
house through a rear "doggy door" about 8:20 p.m. Friday.</TE>
<TE>   She managed to climb over a 2-foot block wall, push open a wooden
gate and walk down a steep, 100-foot slope covered with ice plant and
dried shrubs.</TE>
<TE>   The girl crossed three lanes of Crown Valley Parkway. Several
motorists and a passing animal control officer stopped their cars in
the eastbound lanes as the girl stood in the grassy center island
near Moulton Parkway.</TE>
<TE>   "The officer turned on all her flashers and tried to talk to the
girl and keep her in the center median," Doan said.</TE>
<TE>   But Mya put her hands over her ears, stepped into westbound
traffic and was hit by the white sport utility vehicle and thrown
about 50 feet into the opposing lanes, Doan said.</TE>
<TE>   "Because she is autistic, I'm certain when she came down the hill,
she didn't know the danger and her surroundings," said grandfather
Dennis Richard. He arrived early Saturday from his home in Las Vegas
to be with the family. "She's never wandered out of sight. It's just
devastating."</TE>
<TE>   The girl's mother had gone to run an errand and left Mya and her
7-year-old brother, Jeremy, with the live-in caretaker, who is
specially trained in working with autistic children.</TE>
<TE>   When the 45-year-old baby-sitter, whose name has not been
released, hadn't seen Mya for about 10 minutes, she thought Mya was
playing hide and seek.</TE>
<TE>   She searched the house but couldn't find the girl, who liked to
hide in closets and under the bed, her grandfather said.</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, the sitter heard sirens and looked out a back
window, where she spotted Mya lying in the street, surrounded by
police cars. The animal control officer and one of the motorists--a
trauma surgeon--were giving the girl CPR.</TE>
<TE>   "Mya was their life," Dennis Richard said, referring to parents
Donny and Judy Richard. "They devoted so much one-on-one time with
her, and they didn't trust just anyone to watch her."</TE>
<TE>   Mya, who turned 5 last week, was diagnosed as autistic when she
was 1, her grandfather said. But in the past year, Dennis Richard
said, she had begun to show significant improvement, interacting with
toys, learning how to color with crayons, and discovering how to find
video games on the Internet. She had even learned how to rewind
"Barney" videos, her favorite.</TE>
<TE>   He said it was financially difficult for Judy, a waitress at the
nearby Ritz-Carlton hotel, and Donny, a Web page designer, to buy a
home in the hilly south Orange County neighborhood. They wanted to
live near Mya's school and on a cul-de-sac, where there would be
fewer cars passing through.</TE>
<TE>   Their street is lined with basketball hoops, plastic playground
sets and signs cautioning against speeding.</TE>
<TE>   Friends and relatives gathered at the Crown Valley Parkway median
Saturday to set up a memorial, including a pink bow tied to a white
cross. Roses and pink hydrangeas marked the spot where Mya last
stood. Funeral arrangements for the girl are pending.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a darling," Dennis Richard said. "It's very hard to
believe that a person who hit a 50-pound child didn't know it."</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's investigators would like to interview all witnesses.
Anyone with information is asked to call (714) 647-7170.</TE>

<HD>Grand Jury Criticizes Services to Children</HD>
<DH>Oversight: Foster home's backlog of abuse probes is cited.
L.A. Unified accounting is faulted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE CHAVEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MacLaren Children's Center, the foster home of last resort for the
most troubled children in Los Angeles County, is beset with a growing
backlog of investigations into reports of abuse by staff members
against children, according to the county grand jury.</LD>
<LD>   The 357-page report by the Civil Grand Jury of 2001-2002, which
acts as Los Angeles County's citizen watchdog panel, investigated
MacLaren as well as a broad range of other issues originating from
more than 62 citizens' complaints about education, jails, social
services and public safety. The jurors made recommendations that they
believe will improve county government.</LD>
<LD>   Among other issues, the 23-member grand jury said the Los Angeles
Unified School District has not properly accounted for $1.3 billion
in state lottery funds; reported substandard conditions at some jail
facilities; and urged the Board of Supervisors to take a closer look
at potential problems with new electronic voting machines.</LD>
<TE>   One of the longest examinations in the report focused on MacLaren
center, where the grand jury said a backlog of 84 abuse allegations
dating from 1997 to October 2001 is a crucial lapse that could result
in "great harm coming to children." The backlog gives staff the
impression that there are few consequences for abusive behavior and
discourages children from making abuse complaints, the jurors
concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Staff with the Department of Children and Family Services told
grand jury examiners that the backlog of abuse reports has worsened
because of inadequate staffing and an increase in the number of
high-priority investigations, including child deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Several MacLaren workers reported that probes into child abuse
allegations are "at best perfunctory, and that [administrators]
assigned to them tend not to give them due diligence because often
the allegations are against employees who happen to be friendly
toward them," the report released Friday stated.</TE>
<TE>   Also, internal affairs staff reported that "an atmosphere of
silence pervades many MacLaren staff." An "unwritten agreement seems
to prevail" that if they talk against one another, they won't get the
backing of colleagues if a major fight breaks out with the residents,
the report said.</TE>
<TE>   MacLaren management reported to the grand jury that police reports
were completed for all the allegations of abuse by staff "in at least
the past year and a half," and that none of the reports resulted in
criminal charges. Also, in-house investigations at MacLaren are said
to be up-to-date and some may result in actions against staff.</TE>
<TE>   However, the grand jury said, the broader Department of Children
and Family Services investigations, where the backlog exists, are
particularly important because they focus solely on child abuse
issues and could lead to different findings. The grand jury
recommended that the county take away investigative responsibilities
from Children's Services administrators, who it believes cannot
conduct independent inquiries. One manager with complete autonomy
should be assigned to all abuse investigations, and new policies
should be created to address the code of silence among staff, the
panel said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the Department of Children and Family Services and
the Interagency Children's Services Consortium could not be reached
for comment Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The hike in assaults and attempted assaults at the facility, which
rose from 1,320 in 1999 to 2,329 in 2001, came as the population
changed to an older and more deeply troubled group. As the facility
has moved to decrease overcrowding in recent years by placing
children more quickly in foster homes, the youths who remain tend to
be the hardest to place, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Because the population is in such great need, the jury recommended
that staffing be reconfigured to include a stronger mental health
component.</TE>
<TE>   In other areas:</TE>
<TE>   * L.A. Unified: Jurors hired an independent auditor to review the
use of the school district's share of lottery funds since 1998. Under
state law, lottery funds must be used for instructional purposes. The
jury found that the district has commingled $1.3 billion in lottery
money into its general funds since 1984 and called for separate
accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   The jury also said the district should transfer $27 million in
general-fund money into a special fund for lottery-provided
instructional materials to show that it has complied with state law.</TE>
<TE>   "That money has not been misspent," Joseph Zeronian, the
district's chief financial officer, said Saturday. Although the money
"may have not been accounted for in the right place," he said, "what
we are dealing with here is an esoteric accounting."</TE>
<TE>   The district's expenditures on instructional materials and books
exceeds the lottery revenue, Zeronian said. "The important thing is
that we are buying the materials."</TE>
<TE>   * Jails: After touring every jail facility in the county, the
jurors found substandard conditions at eight juvenile camps and
detention facilities.</TE>
<TE>   The camps include Camp Holton, Camp Muntz and Camp Scudder, which
are in need of physical plant improvements in areas such as
restrooms, electrical systems and dormitory maintenance, and security
lighting. Many of the poor conditions have existed for more than two
years. At Camp Paile, the jurors found inadequate bedding and
clothing. Also, juveniles were pulled from school to perform
maintenance work for up to six hours.</TE>
<TE>   The jury said the Board of Supervisors should arrange for
immediate repairs and the county should re-prioritize maintenance
schedules.</TE>
<TE>   * Voting machines: The jurors evaluated the proposed electronic
voting machines that the county is aiming to have in place by the
2004 elections and recommended that the Board of Supervisors conduct
further studies on the machines.</TE>
<TE>   The jurors found that they may be vulnerable to breakdowns and
sabotage.</TE>

<LD>Not terribly long ago, I chided whiny secessionists for rattling on
and on about potholes. I might even have expressed doubts about
whether there were any chuckholes big enough to warrant the breakup
of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   But that was before Nathalie Hartman, 85, sent in a photo of
herself with bucket and shovel, fixing a 3-foot-long pothole near the
Lamplighter restaurant at Van Nuys Boulevard and Otsego Street in
Sherman Oaks.</LD>
<LD>   "I was afraid someone would hit it and cause a serious accident,"
says Hartman, who estimated the depth at six or seven inches. She
filled the hole with sand, and when she spotted a maintenance crew
working on curb cutaways for wheelchairs, she asked if they'd drop
some cement into the pothole.</LD>
<TE>   "They said that's not their department--call the city," says
Hartman, who never did. She says she can't stand "those awful
electrical answering phones, punch 1 then 2 then 3 and so forth, just
another runaround."</TE>
<TE>   Hartman, as it turns out, is neither for nor against secession.
She is, however, in favor of potholes getting filled without having
to do it herself.</TE>
<TE>   I've lived in cities where a Nathalie Hartman would not lift a
shovel. She would walk up the street and knock on the door of her
block captain, who would go knock on the door of the ward leader, who
would call a councilman, who would pick up the phone and threaten to
have someone's job or break their legs if the pothole weren't filled
in 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   That's the way it's supposed to be done, and that's what we need
in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   I mentioned this to state Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman
Oaks), who has offered up a plan to divide L.A. into boroughs as an
alternative to secession by the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood.
Hertzberg liked my notion of common folk having a direct pipeline to
City Hall, but he flinched when I got to the part about breaking
legs.</TE>
<TE>   So all right, the political machine I romanticized is inherently
corrupt and pretty much obsolete in American cities. But Hertzberg's
plan draws from the best aspects of it, promoting a sense of shared
interests and neighborhood control in what is now an amorphous sea of
disconnected souls.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. just doesn't work as is, Hertzberg says, citing the infamous
history of how it gobbled up everything around it, expanding to
unmanageable proportions.</TE>
<TE>   He would carve L.A. into nine boroughs, each with a five-person
council and the authority to tackle local problems, like potholes.
The borough president would also serve on a nine-person citywide
council that took on bigger issues.</TE>
<TE>   "Democracy loses its relevance if people don't participate, and
smaller units of government are more effective at getting people
involved," says Hertzberg, who quotes Alexis de Tocqueville on the
essence of community.</TE>
<TE>   "The lady with the shovel doesn't know who to call, and even if
she does, she gets a faceless voice on a recording. With the borough
plan, you'd have community city halls and you'd know people were
there."</TE>
<TE>   Each borough would have five wards of about 80,000 residents each,
offering far more accountability than a new Valley city of 1.35
million could ever provide.</TE>
<TE>   "When you run for office and go to the supermarket to buy tomatoes
or to pick up your dry cleaning, everyone's going to know who you
are, and if they've got a problem, they're going to tell you about
it," Hertzberg says.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd like to get to where the school district and MTA and the
county have the same service areas as the boroughs, so you don't have
to schlep across L.A. through 3 1/2 hours of traffic, only to be told
to come back another day."</TE>
<TE>   Now for the good news/bad news portion of the column.</TE>
<TE>   The bad:</TE>
<TE>   Although Hertzberg is still trying to win City Council approval to
put his plan on the November ballot, there's a better chance Mayor
Jim Hahn will loosen his tie one day and dance the Macarena on
Ventura Boulevard. Hertzberg got going too late, and the council
isn't going to support its own dismantling.</TE>
<TE>   The good:</TE>
<TE>   Secession is probably doomed. The rebellion is backed by rank
amateurs in the Valley and a cartoonish self-promoter in Hollywood.
None of these cowpokes makes a convincing argument for breaking away,
and they'd have been laughed off their horses by now if not for the
fact that Jim Hahn ain't so tall in the saddle, either.</TE>
<TE>   So after secession flames out in November, Hertzberg will come to
the rescue, and this time he'll have more of the calendar to work
with. If all goes well, he might try to make the March ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "What the borough plan does is give you the best of Los Angeles
without breaking it up," Hertzberg says. "Secession would be held up
by 10 years of everyone suing everybody anyway. It'd be a boondoggle
for lawyers."</TE>
<TE>   Hertzberg, who understands that filling potholes is only part of
the challenge, speaks passionately about making connections and
transforming people's notion of what a city can be.</TE>
<TE>   "Government is not just about delivering services," he says. "It's
about creating a better sense of community."</TE>
<TE>   If the borough plan becomes reality, I'd like to nominate
85-year-old Nathalie Hartman for ward boss. She's got spunk, and
although she may not be a leg-breaker, the woman swings a mean
shovel.</TE>

<LD>They venture into where it is dark and damp. Where breathing can be a
struggle. Where the walls can cave in at any moment and the wrong
step can mean being swallowed up by the Earth.</LD>
<LD>   For those who explore California's abandoned mines, it is a hobby
that lies at the opposite end of, say, stamp collecting. They collect
glimpses of history, and to do so, they risk their lives.</LD>
<LD>   "It's kind of hard to explain," said Bill Carr, 45, of Seal Beach,
who has probed more than 100 old mines. "I just like to explore the
unknown. It's something that's in my blood. If I see a hole in the
side of a mountain, I have to explore it."</LD>
<TE>   The death last week of two Santa Ana brothers who waded into the
murky waters of the abandoned Blue Light Mine in the Cleveland
National Forest underscored the dangers posed by the many mines left
behind by California's 19th century prospectors.</TE>
<TE>   But it also sheds light on the subculture of mine explorers, a
loose-knit group of hikers and four-wheelers, amateur historians and
adventure-seekers who fear that the deaths of Nicholas Anderson, 23,
and brother Glenn, 18, will spur efforts to plug old shaft openings
and rob them of their avocation.</TE>
<TE>   "America is about freedom," Carr said. "If you want to take your
chances, you should be able to do it. I don't believe in
over-regulation. I know the parents of those kids are devastated. But
a lot of this is common sense. Common sense should tell you not to do
what they did."</TE>
<TE>   The grief-stricken friends and family of the Andersons are
circulating petitions demanding that authorities seal the Blue Light
Mine. But not everyone who lives in Orange County's rugged canyons
feels that is an appropriate solution.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I come up here, I find a new entrance. You could never
block them all off," said Mike Boeck, a volunteer with the U.S.
Forest Service who has been exploring the area's back country,
including its mines, for 35 years. "You can't eliminate danger from
life. It's like saying 'Let's close the beaches down because two
people drowned.' What about the rest of us who go swimming without
getting in over our heads?"</TE>
<TE>   Reggie Gould, 64, grew up in Orange County and explored its
mountain backdrop, including its abandoned mines. Today he lives in
Garden Valley, in rural Northern California's Gold-Rush country, and
insists his hobby, poking around mines, makes him no different from
any other thrill seeker.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not a nut case; I do value my life," said Gould, who has an
abandoned mine in his backyard. "Why do people climb mountains and
risk their lives or go deep-sea diving? It's a fascination, a rush."</TE>
<TE>   Gould said the Andersons fell prey to the most common trap of mine
exploration: inexperience.</TE>
<TE>   "I blame it on the thrill-seeking shows I've seen on TV," he said.
"It's just a shame they lost their lives on something so foolish.
I've never taken those kinds of chances, and most of us don't."</TE>
<TE>   It's been 45 years since Gould and a few friends canvassed the
Blue Light Mine, looking for a way in. Gould still remembers one
water-filled portal that wasn't worth the risk.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all excellent swimmers and we had diving masks, but it
was too dangerous," he said. "As soon as you go into murky water like
that, you stir up the mud and you can't see in front of your face."</TE>
<TE>   Gould and his buddies eventually slipped into a two-foot hole that
dropped into a tunnel, part of the five miles of shafts that make up
the mine. They spent several hours envisioning what life must have
been like for those who spent their days swinging pick axes hundreds
of feet below the earth.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to reconstruct the past. I like to pretend I'm with the
old miners," Gould said. "I wonder how they ran their day-to-day
operation. I like to think I'm in there swinging with them, mucking
out the ore and shoveling it into the ore cars. I'm a historian and
my history is underground."</TE>
<TE>   Karl Kasarda, 28, who lives in Modjeska Canyon, was bitten by the
abandoned mine bug about five years ago while on an off-road trip to
a ghost town. He has since explored, photographed and researched 30
closed mines in Nevada, Arizona and California, including several in
Orange County's mountains.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the most significant parts of my life now," he said.
"I love history. When you get inside some of these mines, it's
amazing what you'll find: old tools, drill bits left stuck in the
walls.</TE>
<TE>   "You get to see the conditions these guys worked in ... in an
attempt to make it rich. Museums don't have that, the flavor and
taste of how it was. It's abstract. The mine is the heartbeat of what
these towns were."</TE>
<TE>   Kasarda will venture only into horizontal shafts; vertical shafts
he won't touch. He goes in prepared: never alone and with multiple
lights, ropes and with word left behind about where he is going and
when he plans to return.</TE>
<TE>   He has inched his way into the darkness and has felt lightheaded;
he has been struck by tunnel vision. To Kasarda, they're signals that
it's time to get out--quick.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a particularly cautious adventurer," the computer-security
engineer said. "A lot of it is common sense. If you don't know
whether you can get back or are not sure of the conditions, it's not
worth it to me."</TE>
<TE>   Plugging up the Blue Light and other abandoned mines--something
state and federal officials say they'd like to do if they had the
money--would be wrong, Kasarda said.</TE>
<TE>   "The mine is part of the history of this community," he said of
the Blue Light. "It's been on my list for quite a while. I need to
try to get up there before they blow it up. It would be an awful
shame if I couldn't see it."</TE>
<TE>   On Carr's Web site, there's a photo of him wading through the same
rusty soup where the Andersons lost their lives. The picture was
snapped nearly 20 years ago, on a trip that eventually led to the
other side of the below-ground pool, to a series of shafts where Carr
poked around for three hours and found an old drill and a pocket of
carbon dioxide from which he almost blacked out.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just the way I remembered it," Carr said Friday, as he
donned a hard hat with a light attached and stepped into the mine's
boulder-strewn opening. "Wet and cold."</TE>
<TE>   Carr said mine exploration is about margin of error.</TE>
<TE>   Do you leave yourself a big cushion, a small cushion or do you
venture out onto the razor's edge?</TE>
<TE>   He concedes it's an imprecise science.</TE>
<TE>   "Truth is, we're taking risks, calculated risks," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He edged deeper into the mine, the air cool but stale, the walls
stained crimson by minerals, and slowly closing in.</TE>
<TE>   About 25 feet from the opening--far from where the Andersons found
deep water and no oxygen in the air--Carr stopped, turned around and
slushed out.</TE>
<TE>   "I was the same age as those kids when I did that," he said of his
last foray into the Blue Light Mine.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, the cushion for error Carr left himself seemed big.</TE>
<TE>   Today, it seems as small as the tunnel before him.</TE>
<TE>   "I've gotten wiser with age," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Luckily, I've learned a lot without having to die for it."</TE>

<HD>Molester Seeks His Freedom</HD>
<DH>Courts: Former Simi Valley resident who had surgical
castration says he's no longer a threat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY WOLCOTT and STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 41-year-old former Simi Valley resident with a long history of
molesting young boys is waging a battle for freedom in a Ventura
County courtroom, contending that surgical castration has eliminated
his predatory behavior.</LD>
<LD>   If the jury hearing the case agrees, Stephen Norten will become
one of a very small number of repeat sexual offenders across the
country who has been freed after voluntarily undergoing the
controversial procedure.</LD>
<LD>   "Mr. Norten has a diagnosed mental disorder that makes him a
danger to others," prosecutor David Lehr said in his opening
statement in Superior Court last week. "And he will be a threat if
freed."</LD>
<TE>   Defense attorney Neil Quinn contends a lifetime of uncontrollable
sexual urges that drove his client to prey on children has been fixed
by the surgery that was performed this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Those impulses have been removed," Quinn said during his opening
remarks.</TE>
<TE>   Norten, a slight, bespectacled man who looks like a Hollywood
version of a mild-mannered bookkeeper, is a sexually violent predator
who has lived at Atascadero State Hospital in San Luis Obispo County
since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have brought his case before Judge Donald D. Coleman
in a bid to keep Norten at the hospital, even though he has served
all of the prison time imposed on him for several past sex crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Under the state's 1996 Sexually Violent Predator Act, repeat
sexual offenders can remain in custody indefinitely if judges, juries
and mental health experts deem them a continuing threat to society.</TE>
<TE>   To do so, prosecutors must return to court about every two years
to prove that a patient remains a danger.</TE>
<TE>   This is Norten's third attempt at freedom but the first time he
has been able to raise such an unusual defense.</TE>
<TE>   "His long-range plan is to have a life that is not dominated and
destroyed by a hyperactive sexual drive," Quinn said.</TE>
<TE>   According to witnesses in the trial, which is expected to conclude
this week, Norten has admitted to sexual contacts with hundreds of
boys during the last three decades.</TE>
<TE>   A courtroom display next to the jury of 12 men and women places
Norten's criminal convictions on a grim timeline: He was convicted of
molesting four boys in May and June of 1981. After five years of
treatment at Atascadero, he was convicted of paying a developmentally
disabled 15-year-old $20 for sex in Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   After further treatment at Patton State Hospital and a stretch in
prison, he pleaded guilty to indecent exposure and attempted
kidnapping in an incident with a 13-year-old in Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   He met three of his early victims while rooming at a family's home
in Simi Valley. The fourth was a 10-year-old boy he befriended at
Simi Valley's Sequoia Park.</TE>
<TE>   After just a month in Simi Valley, he attracted the attention of
police officers, who warned him not to associate with young boys.</TE>
<TE>   A Simi Valley patrolman repeated the warning when he saw Norten
and the 10-year-old together at a pizza restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   But Norten ignored the warning, driving the boy to a remote spot
and ordering him to lie on his stomach and spread his legs, according
to a court document cited by psychologist Dawn Starr, who works with
prisoners at Atascadero.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't make me mad," Norten reportedly said. "If you do, I'm going
to shoot you."</TE>
<TE>   The pivotal issue in this trial will be how the jury interprets
testimony from half a dozen mental health experts who have offered
differing opinions about the effectiveness of castration to stop or
limit sexual desire.</TE>
<TE>   When a man is castrated, his testes are surgically cut off. The
procedure, called an orchiectomy, essentially removes the glands that
produce a majority of a man's testosterone, which contributes to
sexual desire.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the procedure point to studies that show recidivism
rates for castrated offenders are often below 5%, a statistic
highlighted by Quinn during his opening remarks.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents, though, say the procedure does not always eliminate
deviant sexual urges and that violent predators exhibit behavior that
is motivated more by psychological reason than physical urges.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, hormones that assist sex drive can be found in other
glands, including the adrenals.</TE>
<TE>   At Atascadero, Starr has evaluated more than 400 sexual predators.
She met with Norten twice--most recently just a few days after his
surgical castration.</TE>
<TE>   In court last week, she said she didn't believe the procedure has
made him less dangerous to young boys, despite his assertion that he
no longer has sexual drives.</TE>
<TE>   "Simply receiving some sort of snip or castration won't reduce the
preoccupation he's had for over 20 years," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She predicted Norten would continue to seek out young boys because
he can't "relate to adults in a positive manner."</TE>
<TE>   By his own account, Norten has claimed to have had sex with dozens
of young boys, picking them up mainly at shopping malls and parks.</TE>
<TE>   Scanning a group for the most vulnerable youths was not difficult,
he told Starr.</TE>
<TE>   "He said that it comes with being a predator," she testified. "He
could tell by looking at them who would be receptive."</TE>
<TE>   She also said Norten had not been honest with therapists in the
past, refusing to acknowledge his sexual activities with other
patients.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just a question of genital arousal," she said. "It's
what kind of person you're attracted to. Castration wouldn't change
the focus of his sexual interests."</TE>
<TE>   Norten is expected to take the stand this week.</TE>

<HD>Recycling Firm Sues the State</HD>
<DH>Regulation: Owner claims Department of Conservation is
putting him out of business with an ongoing fraud investigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of California's largest recyclers is suing state officials,
alleging that they are putting him out of business with a fraud
investigation.</LD>
<LD>   Errol Segal, owner of Los Angeles-based Active Recycling Co., says
in two lawsuits that the state Department of Conservation has
harassed him for more than 10 years with audits, inspections and
accusations but has never proved any serious charges against him.</LD>
<LD>   Segal, who paid a $1,700 fine in 1997 for recycling violations,
says the department's lengthy probe has scared away large customers
and jeopardized his bank financing. If his lender follows through
with a notice canceling his $2.25-million line of credit July 16, he
expects to be out of business days later.</LD>
<TE>   "It's abuse of power by government officials, and they used their
power to bring a businessman down," Segal, a recycler for 26 years,
said in an interview. "Because of this, no banker wants to touch me."</TE>
<TE>   Carol Dahmen, a spokeswoman for the Department of Conservation,
which runs the state's recycling program, said the department would
not comment on Segal's lawsuits or discuss his case because of an
ongoing investigation.</TE>
<TE>   In March 2001, the department filed a 17-page accusation seeking
$1.6 million in penalties from Active Recycling and revocation of the
company's certificate to operate five recycling centers and one
processing plant at various Los Angeles locations, including North
Hollywood and Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   The state accused the company of engaging in "dishonesty,
incompetence, negligence or fraud in performing the functions and
duties of a certificate holder." According to the accusation, the
company used "inaccurate, altered, falsified, and/or fraudulent
information" to obtain redemption money to which it was not entitled.</TE>
<TE>   The accusation said the company was under investigation by the
FBI, which seized boxes of business records in October 1999. FBI
officials declined to comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Segal, an Encino resident who now operates three recycling centers
and a processing plant, says recycling officials want to cripple his
business because he fought department allegations against him on two
occasions and won after state officials reviewed the disputes.</TE>
<TE>   Segal's suits, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in April and
May, allege that state officials have been trying since 1988 to
tarnish his reputation by falsely accusing him of fabricating records
to collect hundreds of thousands of dollars in bottle and can
redemption money from a state fund.</TE>
<TE>   The fund consists of the container deposits paid by consumers.
Recyclers apply for the redemption money after buying back the empty
bottles and cans.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuits, which seek unspecified damages, say Segal has never
been found guilty of any serious violations of recycling laws.
Nonetheless, the court papers continue, Segal's large-volume
customers received letters from the department stating that Active
Recycling had committed "long-standing violations" of state recycling
laws.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole industry called me up and said, 'You're in trouble,' "
Segal said.</TE>
<TE>   Large-volume customers who normally bring 1,000 pounds or more of
recyclables at a time have refused to do business with him because of
the letters, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Segal's attorney, Hal Wright, said the state went after his client
over disputed paperwork in 1988 and 1992, but Segal successfully
fought back.</TE>
<TE>   Wright said that in the 1988 case, the department refused to pay
Segal $249,000 from the redemption fund, contending there were
problems with the required documentation. The case went to an
administrative hearing and Segal was paid, Wright said.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Segal lawsuits, the department audited Segal's
books in 1992 and said he owed the state $240,000 because of improper
redemptions. The department eventually dropped that charge, the
lawsuits say.The only charges the state has been able to justify were
"minor, technical violations" of recycling laws that resulted in
Segal paying the $1,700 fine in 1997, said Wright, who once
prosecuted recyclers as a staff attorney for the department.</TE>
<TE>   Segal said Comerica Bank notified him it will not continue Active
Recycling's line of credit past July 16. "I cannot operate without
it," he said, adding that at least six other lenders have turned him
down.</TE>

<HD>Westin's Spending Sparks Uproar</HD>
<DH>Colleges: Critics urge the chancellor to resign. Ventura
County district trustees also come under attack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS and MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A month after he was awarded a new contract and a $30,000 raise,
Ventura County Community College District Chancellor Philip Westin
has found himself at the center of a political firestorm over charges
of excessive spending.</LD>
<LD>   During a four-year period, Westin was reimbursed $119,400 for
business-related expenses, from $1,600 for a custom car phone to 75
cents for a pack of breath mints, according to district expense
reports.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, Westin sat silently through a two-hour verbal whipping
by dozens of angry critics who jammed a board of trustees meeting to
call for his resignation.</LD>
<TE>   The board itself is also being targeted for failing to rein in
Westin's spending and granting him the new four-year contract, which
takes effect Monday and will pay him $203,000 a year. For six years,
critics point out, the chancellor took full advantage of a policy
that placed no limits on his spending.</TE>
<TE>   "They abdicated their power," said Don Facciano, president of the
Ventura County Taxpayers Assn., referring to the trustees. "The board
majority neglected to monitor [Westin's] spending. Shame on them.
They were elected to that office and had a duty to perform. We're
asking for accountability. People feel they've been had."</TE>
<TE>   While apologizing for his conduct and vowing to change his ways,
Westin has launched a counterattack. He contends that this still
unfolding tale of power and money is rooted in an attempt by a
Camarillo law firm to oust him and gain control of a lucrative
contract with the district.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had done something wrong, I'd be in jail right now," said
Westin, the son of a Presbyterian minister. "If you live a life of
integrity, you've got to do more than just talk about it. That's how
I'm able to sleep at night."</TE>
<TE>   Westin filed a complaint in April with the State Bar of
California, accusing the firm of Wood &amp; Bender of "unethical conduct"
in an effort to obtain the district's legal services contract, which
last year totaled more than $900,000.</TE>
<TE>   "With me gone, a huge impediment to Mr. [David] Bender's assuming
the district's legal work would be out of the way," Westin wrote in
his complaint.</TE>
<TE>   Repeated calls to the law firm last week for a response to
Westin's allegations were not returned.</TE>
<TE>   In an earlier interview, however, David Wood maintained that the
law firm had acted appropriately in the matter. He provided The Times
a copy of a letter dated June 18 from the state bar, stating that an
initial review of Westin's complaint found "there was insufficient
grounds for disciplinary action."</TE>
<TE>   Westin's 57-page complaint paints a scathing picture of a troubled
college district whose administrators and trustees--three of whom
face reelection this year--are still struggling to dig their way out
of an ever-deepening political sinkhole. But Westin said last week
that he has no intention of resigning.</TE>
<TE>   He said he believes that he and a majority of the trustees can
weather the storm and win back the public's trust. Trustee John
Tallman was the only board member to vote against renewing Westin's
contract.</TE>
<TE>   "I apologize for the things I've done because it has cast doubt,
from the point of view of the community, on whether I or the board
are good custodians of public funds," Westin said. "I regret that a
great deal. But for the rest of my tenure here I'm going to do things
differently."</TE>
<TE>   Friendly Meeting</TE>
<TE>   The chancellor's troubles began last December when Bender asked to
meet with trustee Bob Gonzales. The two had known each other for
years. They played golf together, talked football and confided about
their personal lives.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a person I considered to be a very good friend," Gonzales
said last week.</TE>
<TE>   Bender, a former trustee himself, supported the Santa Paula police
chief's first run for the college board in 1996. He raised money for
Gonzales' campaign and served as an advisor.</TE>
<TE>   At their December meeting, Bender offered up some disturbing news.
Tipped off about Westin's spending habits by an unnamed source,
Bender told Gonzales that his law firm had conducted a preliminary
survey using public records and found that the chancellor had run up
thousands of dollars in questionable expenses.</TE>
<TE>   "Dave says he's got information on Phil, and says, in his mind, he
may be ripping off the district, committing fraud, doing things in an
illegal fashion," Gonzales said. "I said, 'Tell me more.' "</TE>
<TE>   Over the next two months, Bender continued to update Gonzales on
his firm's probe of the chancellor. Wood and Bender had already hired
Long Beach-based Gailey Associates, a private investigations firm, to
look into Westin's expenditures, according to the firm's own
documents.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales said he had every reason to trust Bender, who had served
as a trustee with the district from 1979 to 1987 and as its general
counsel from 1996 to 1998. In recent years, Gonzales tried to help
his friend by getting the district to hire Bender's law firm for
legal work.</TE>
<TE>   "I owe Dave big time," Gonzales would often tell Westin, according
to the chancellor's complaint to the bar. "If it weren't for David
Bender, I wouldn't be in this chair."</TE>
<TE>   Last February, Gonzales arranged for a meeting between Bender and
board President Norman Nagel to discuss Westin's expenses. Concerned
about what he heard, Nagel said he called a closed-door meeting of
the trustees to hear a full presentation by Bender and Wood.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting was scheduled for March 6, a day after county voters
approved a $356-million bond measure to pay for improvements at the
college district's three campuses. Westin was not invited.</TE>
<TE>   Before making their presentation, Wood and Bender told the
trustees that "they were the board's attorneys" on this matter, which
some members questioned, according to Westin's complaint to the state
bar.</TE>
<TE>   Nagel said he was confused about the relationship the board had
with Wood and Bender, given that they had not hired them in this
matter. Nevertheless, the trustees went along with their advice,
Nagel said.</TE>
<TE>   Wood and Bender persuaded the board that the board's attorney,
Jack Lipton, should leave the room, suggesting he could be implicated
in the allegations against Westin, Nagel said. Lipton advised the
trustees to adjourn until they could hire an independent attorney.</TE>
<TE>   The board ignored Lipton's advice and excused him from the
meeting, a decision that Nagel would later describe as "the biggest
mistake, as president, I ever made."</TE>
<TE>   Then Wood and Bender dropped the bombshell, a 3-inch-thick report,
detailing $119,000 of business-related expenses that the chancellor
had charged to the district between December 1997 and October 2001.
In all, the audit found $46,000 in "questionable expenses,"
essentially those lacking receipts or adequate documentation.</TE>
<TE>   They included $22,300 for car repairs, $12,700 for equipment and
supplies, $7,600 for computer software, $1,600 for travel upgrades
and $1,700 for miscellaneous. The report also revealed that Westin
was reimbursed $23,000 for business meals from 1999 to 2001, but
these overall expenses were not listed as questionable.</TE>
<TE>   Bender told the trustees that Westin's purchases should be further
investigated to determine whether they constituted fraud, theft or
embezzlement, according to several board members. Bender urged them
to act quickly, Nagel recalled.</TE>
<TE>   "David [Bender] said to us, 'Now that you know, you will become
culpable--possibly criminally--because there's a question of what did
you know and when did you know it,' " Nagel said. "I know squat about
the legal profession, so I'm thinking, 'Holy cow!' "</TE>
<TE>   Resignation Urged</TE>
<TE>   When the meeting adjourned, Nagel met with Westin in his office
and urged him to resign on the spot. Stunned, Westin said that he
demanded an explanation but Nagel offered none.</TE>
<TE>   Westin refused to step down. He met with Nagel again the following
morning in the chancellor's office to find out why the board was so
upset with him. Westin recalled the meeting in his complaint to the
state bar:</TE>
<TE>   "I said to him that I didn't know what was going on," Westin
wrote. "At that point, [Nagel] collapsed into a chair, heaving and
sobbing. He said he couldn't talk to me."</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, Nagel called another closed-door trustees
meeting for March 12 to discuss an evaluation of the chancellor. The
board told Westin at that time that it planned to hire an independent
auditor to review Bender's report.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the first time that I had any sort of confirmation that
the issue was related to my expense reimbursements," Westin wrote to
the state bar. "I told them I would cooperate fully--that my
conscience was absolutely clear."</TE>
<TE>   But Westin also wrote that he became angry during the meeting,
suggesting that perhaps he should leave the room so the board's
attorney could "explain what 'constructive wrongful termination' was
and what kind of lawsuit they would have had on their hands had I
resigned" on March 6.</TE>
<TE>   "You guys better wake up and smell the roses," Westin stated in
his complaint to the bar, although admitting that "it was a stupid
thing to say." He said he later apologized to board members for his
outburst.</TE>
<TE>   Westin wrote that he then told the board about his own
observations of David Bender, who he said "liked to frighten and
intimidate board members."</TE>
<TE>   Westin said it was Bender who recommended that Westin apply for
the chancellor's job when both men worked for Coast Community College
District. Westin was then president of Golden West College in
Huntington Beach and Bender was that district's general counsel.</TE>
<TE>   Westin said he believed Bender was instrumental in lobbying
Tallman's support for him in his successful bid for the position.
Before he started his new job in January 1996, Westin wrote in his
complaint, Bender contacted him and "made it clear that I owed him
and that what he wanted was to become general counsel."</TE>
<TE>   Bender was eventually hired to represent the district, but Westin
said he had no influence over the board's decision. "I didn't stand
up and object, either," he added.</TE>
<TE>   In his complaint, Westin said he became disillusioned with both
Bender and Tallman, both of whom he said were constantly telling him
what they thought should be done in the district. "My role, in Mr.
Bender and Tallman's mind, was simply to do what they directed,"
Westin wrote in his complaint.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Westin said, he began questioning expenses submitted by
Bender's law firm. District records indicate that legal fees jumped
from about $69,000 in the 1995-1996 fiscal year to more than $527,000
in 1996-1997. That figure has nearly doubled in the current fiscal
year, which ends June 30.</TE>
<TE>   Westin said that before he could take his concerns to the board,
Bender announced that he was leaving the district to go to work for a
software company. The chancellor wrote in his complaint that he was
relieved that "we didn't have to get into a showdown with Mr.
Bender."</TE>
<TE>   After Bender left the software company, he formed a partnership
with Camarillo attorney David Wood. "I was contacted around that time
by Mr. Bender who informed me that he wanted to return to the
district as general counsel," Westin wrote in his complaint. He told
Bender that the district was happy with Lipton as its attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Audit Clears Westin</TE>
<TE>   Since the controversy erupted, the district's independent auditor
has released a report that Westin said exonerates him. "In summary,
our review of the facts did not disclose the existence of any
criminal activity as related to the employee reimbursement claims,"
the auditor concluded.</TE>
<TE>   But Tallman disputes the report's findings, saying that it was not
a real audit but a surface-level examination of Westin's expenses. "I
wanted a more thorough report," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the district is involved in a dispute over a $61,000
bill submitted by Wood and Bender's firm for their investigative
work. In a claim filed with the district in May, they said that their
report on Westin was authorized by Gonzales.</TE>
<TE>   But Gonzales said he never authorized the study, noting that the
private investigator hired by Bender had submitted its request for
Westin's expenditures on Sept. 14. He said he told Bender repeatedly
that, as a trustee acting alone, "I don't have the authority to hire
you."</TE>
<TE>   "I feel betrayed and used," Gonzales said. "I'm mad at myself for
falling into a trap, for being gullible."</TE>
<TE>   Feeling betrayed by the board, Westin told the members he wasn't
sure he wanted to stay on as chancellor. He later changed his mind
and hired a lawyer to renegotiate the terms of his contract.</TE>
<TE>   New Spending Policy</TE>
<TE>   Despite Westin's spending habits, trustees voted 4 to 1 on May 28
to grant Westin a new four-year contract and a 16% raise. The
trustees are in the process of establishing a new spending policy for
the chancellor.</TE>
<TE>   Defending their action, board members said they felt Westin's
previous salary was not in line with other chancellors' of
comparable-sized districts.</TE>
<TE>   They also worried that the newly approved bond financing and
construction plans might collapse if he quit.</TE>
<TE>   Westin and trustees are not out of the woods yet. In addition to
Tallman, Nagel and trustee Art Hernandez will face reelection in
November.</TE>
<TE>   Allan Jacobs, who joined in voting to extend Westin's contract,
will not be up for reelection until 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office has told Westin it does not intend
to investigate him because there is no apparent evidence of a crime.</TE>
<TE>   But the chancellor must still convince the public, faculty members
and community leaders that he can be an effective leader despite the
outcry for his resignation.</TE>
<TE>   Herbert Gooch, chairman of the political science department at Cal
Lutheran University, said voters often have short memories.</TE>
<TE>   But this fiasco may resonate through the November elections, he
said, because of the public's disgust with high-profile financial
scandals, such as Enron and WorldCom.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because they're elected doesn't mean they're the most savvy
people in the world," Gooch said of the college trustees.</TE>
<TE>   "But if you're in your job long enough you ought to know about
these things. To say they were naive about politics strikes sort of
hollow to me."</TE>

<HD>In Westminster, an Internet Bid to Restore Viet Land</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Outrage was the only emotion Minh Trung Tran could muster when he
heard a historic stretch of land along Vietnam's northern border--one
he remembers reading and singing about as a child--had been handed
over to China.</LD>
<LD>   Ai Nam Quan, a landmark that sits like a rumpled baseball cap on
the top of Vietnam, is a symbol of long-fought-for independence and
the site of legendary battles, such as one waged by 15th century King
Le Loi against an invading Chinese army. It formed a boundary that
separated the two countries.</LD>
<LD>   The land and its surrounding waters were quietly ceded to China in
1999 and 2000.</LD>
<TE>   "It's as if Americans can no longer sing the phrase 'From sea to
shining sea.' Ai Nam Quan isn't just a piece of dirt and land. It
represents our identity and spirit," said Tran, a 27-year-old Santa
Ana resident who left Vietnam with his family as a youth. Rather than
remain idle--or taking to the streets in protest--Tran has found a
weapon in the Internet and an army of sympathizers in Vietnamese
communities around the globe. Many of these people have relatives who
fought in the Vietnam War or spent time in reeducation camps.</TE>
<TE>   Operating from an office in Westminster, Tran is launching a
global petition drive to get the land back, a Don Quixote-like fight
to force a superpower to back down. Experts say the odds of the
effort working are long and the message will be lost on those who
still live in Vietnam, where Internet usage is limited.</TE>
<TE>   But Tran and his associates believe their effort marks a new
chapter in the way Vietnamese Americans influence public policy.</TE>
<TE>   The half-dozen tech-savvy engineers, computer programmers and a
business analyst in their 20s, 30s and 40s are developing a database
of registered Vietnamese voters for petition drives and to lobby
elected officials and the United Nations for endorsement letters.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to build credibility," said Kelvin Ninh, 35, of Tustin, a
computer programmer who helped Tran design www.vietnamvietnam.com,
the Web site that contains the petition.</TE>
<TE>   Although members of "Concerned Citizens Against International
Threats and Aggressions" hope for the return of about 270 square
miles of land and 4,247 square miles of sea, the more practical goal
is to drum up political support and let the Vietnamese government
know that "the world is watching." Ultimately, they hope for the
land's return.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that they're trying to build this virtual community of
Vietnamese on the Internet shows how savvy they've become," said Hien
Duc Do, chairman of the social science department at San Jose State
University. "I've never heard of that being done before."</TE>
<TE>   The online strategy makes sense, Do said, because it's the fastest
and most direct way to unite people scattered around the globe.</TE>
<TE>   "But getting the land back, I think, is wishful thinking," Do
said.</TE>
<TE>   Vietnam officials said the land and sea treaties involving Ai Nam
Quan marked an important step forward in building a stable
environment in the region. They said they are aware of protests over
the issue but are not familiar with Tran's group.</TE>
<TE>   Past efforts to rally support among Vietnamese typically have been
through Vietnamese newspapers, fliers, radio stations or protest
rallies. Extremists have taken riskier steps, such as the pilot who
flew over Vietnam dropping anti-communist leaflets.</TE>
<TE>   "The group is using the most powerful weapon that's available in
politics," said Rep Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach). "Because of
the repressive form of government in Vietnam, this is the only
staging area for protest of this kind."</TE>
<TE>   But reversing the land deal is unlikely, Cox said.</TE>
<TE>   The online petition allows organizers to gather support on health
care, civil liberties and other issues. "There's no question that
Vietnamese Americans can exert significant influence, not only on
international relations, but politics on every level, as they have on
the debate over trade relations with Vietnam and human-rights
issues," Cox said.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Nguyen, 36, a Vietnamese history buff from Aliso Viejo,
not only wrote computer code for the petition but helped develop the
group's strategic plan. Giving away Vietnam's land and territorial
waters is "an issue of security for Vietnam," Nguyen said.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel violated, even though Vietnam is far away, across an
ocean," said Ninh, who left Vietnam when he was 10.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel that someone's invaded your home and taken something from
your home."</TE>

<HD>Reagan Case Was the Only Power Shift</HD>

<AU>JOHANNA NEUMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>When President Reagan was shot in an assassination attempt in 1981,
he underwent surgery that lasted more than three hours. When
President Clinton was injured in a fall at golfer Greg Norman's house
in Florida in 1997, he underwent two hours of surgery to repair a
tendon.</LD>
<LD>   In neither case, however, did the White House invoke the 25th
Amendment to the Constitution, as President Bush intends to do while
undergoing a colonoscopy today. The amendment provides for a
president who is disabled to turn his powers over to the vice
president while he is incapacitated.</LD>
<LD>   The amendment was enacted in 1967, four years after President
Kennedy's assassination. But the push for it began in the 1950s, when
President Eisenhower suffered a series of hearts attacks.</LD>
<TE>   The amendment has only been invoked once: when Reagan underwent
colon surgery in 1985. He sent a letter to Congress saying that
George Bush, his vice president, would serve as acting president
during the surgery. Eight hours later, he wrote Congress again,
reclaiming his presidential powers.</TE>
<TE>   The 25th Amendment provides for different kinds of transfers of
power. In the event of a president's death or resignation, it allows
the new president to select a new vice president, subject to
confirmation by a majority in the House and Senate. In the event of a
president's disability, it says that ''whenever he is unable to
discharge the powers and duties of his office,'' the president may
send congressional leaders a written declaration to that effect,
valid until he sends a new letter to the contrary.</TE>
<TE>   The amendment's final provision, which some legal scholars call
''the nightmare'' scenario, allows for the acting president along
with a majority of the Cabinet to write congressional leaders that
the president, despite his own wishes, is still incapable of assuming
powers. At that point, the issue would be decided by Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Many scholars who have studied the amendment have said they
believe it should be invoked more often. But the political
fallout--the image of a disabled president--makes that unlikely.</TE>

<LD>Irvine Valley College's mission statement doesn't mince words. The
college exists to provide quality education for students in a rapidly
changing world. The document doesn't say anything about leasing a
huge chunk of the campus to a private developer for a $500-million
entertainment and office complex.</LD>
<LD>   That's why people were caught off-guard earlier this month when
word surfaced that an IVC dean had been meeting with a developer who
wanted to build a massive, for-profit venture. The trustees of the
South Orange County Community College District are to be commended
for putting the educational purpose of the district first by
rejecting the plan last week before it could gather more momentum.
The plan called for a 2,000-car parking garage, a seven-story office
building, a 300-room hotel and a 13-acre movie production facility,
along with a 2,000-seat theater, a 2,000-seat auditorium and
10,000-seat athletic stadium. The massive complex would have been
built on a 30-acre tract.</LD>
<TE>   The proposal was out of sync with the city of Irvine's general
plan and existing zoning. The city envisioned the orange groves now
standing near the corner of Jeffrey and Barranca roads as one day
hosting recreational facilities and college-related construction--not
hotels, parking garages and a Hollywood production lot. City
officials hadn't had a chance to review the proposal, and from what
it suggested, many of the plan's elements also clashed with zoning in
the area.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal also was at odds with IVC's own planning process.
Community colleges are required to create a master plan that describe
how they intend to grow. There's nothing in IVC's long-range planning
that was even remotely close to the proposal that was submitted to
the board by Howard Gensler, IVC's dean of humanities and library
science. College deans have a lot of clout, but one has to wonder how
this kind of major campus land-use negotiation got to the stage it
did. It probably should have been handled in the first place at a
higher level of administration.</TE>
<TE>   Colleges do need to be creative when crafting their long-term
plans. State funding shortfalls aren't going to go away, so IVC is
right to be on the lookout for possible funding mechanisms. IVC
clearly needs better athletic fields and a theater where fine arts
students can perform. The athletic fields and performing arts complex
would have been made available for IVC students, which would be a
plus. But faculty members were right to argue for a much smaller
theater to serve the real needs of the school community.</TE>
<TE>   The plan's backers maintained that the for-profit approach
represents IVC's best shot at generating funds to expand the
community college campus. But we were skeptical of a plan that would
turn over public land for a decidedly risky project. If the board is
serious about seeking additional funding, it should first follow the
lead of nearly two dozen other community college districts in the
state that this year will ask voters to approve local bond acts that
would help fund improvements.</TE>
<TE>   The developer's demand for a 99-year lease also was worrisome.
State law allows community colleges to lease land, and developers
have built a hotel, office buildings and a movie theater on other
campuses. Typically, though, colleges stick to short-term leases that
make it easier to regain access to land as needs change. Having
wisely avoided locking itself into a poor plan with a long lease, the
district now must examine more modest improvements, and ensure that
it has the flexibility needed to meet the educational needs of future
students.</TE>

<LD>By this time next year, 27 luxury hotels, with rooms costing more
than $250 per night, will be under construction along the 100-mile
stretch of coast south of Los Angeles. This string of hotels,
including a handful in Orange County, is forcing existing upscale
properties to pour millions of dollars into renovations. The flurry
of high-end construction and the rush to polish high-end amenities at
other existing hotels is being driven by the recognition that
Southern California hasn't fulfilled its potential as a first-class
resort destination.</LD>
<LD>   Given the competition--such five-star destinations as Miami Beach
and Waikiki--it's a tough market to crack. But tastefully appointed
guest rooms, opulent restaurants and challenging golf courses won't
be enough to fill hotel rooms if potential visitors keep reading
about mysterious sewage plumes that foul Orange County beaches.
Vacationers want an escape from reality, not the skull-and-crossbones
message delivered when the county health department says it's not
safe to dip your toes in the Pacific Ocean.</LD>
<LD>   In Huntington Beach, where the romantic "Surf City" moniker
lingers from the glory days of surfing music, beach closings have
haunted recent summers for locals and visitors alike. This is one of
the cities in Orange County with luxury hotel rooms under
development.</LD>
<TE>   It's bad enough when pollution alerts prevent those of us who are
lucky enough to live within an easy drive of our favorite beach from
paddling out to play with the porpoises. Imagine the chagrin of the
out-of-town couple that has spent $375 for an oceanfront room--not to
mention golf course fees, an expensive dinner and a costly visit to
the spa--only to turn on the television and see that the beach just a
few miles away has been closed for health reasons. Wire photos that
show yellow tape stretching across empty beaches tell a different
story from the upbeat message that state tourism officials plan to
send next year through a new advertising campaign. The marketing
message will be that Southern California, with its new wealth of
upscale properties, is a "new Riviera."</TE>
<TE>   It is possible of course to spend a getaway weekend at high-end
hotels in Dana Point, Laguna Beach and Huntington Beach--all with new
projects either built, in the works or with existing hotels planning
renovation--without doing much more than walking to the water's edge.
For many visitors, the view's the thing, enhanced by an ocean breeze
and many amenities right in the hotel.</TE>
<TE>   But it would be nice to think that for such a price you also could
go for an ocean swim. All the extensive plans for new luxury hotel
rooms coincide with the upcoming expiration of the waiver that the
Orange County Sanitation District has had from the Clean Water Act.
It hasn't had to treat waste water to the degree other jurisdictions
have. Considering the stake for local tourism, no wonder Huntington
Beach and other cities have gone on record opposing a renewal. We
have opposed it too.</TE>
<TE>   Their high-end convention-goers and weekend visitors will be
paying a lot for the expectation that you can go near the water. And
as the Fourth of July approaches, it's time to do all we can to
reduce ocean pollution, whatever its source, to ensure that future
summers will bring pollution-free beaches.</TE>

<LD>Orange County in recent years has made significant progress in
developing programs in the law enforcement and educational
communities to help troubled youth and reduce gang activity and
violence. The Orange County Human Relations Commission deserves
credit for encouraging this work through its long-standing practice
of honoring schools and police departments that make solid
contributions.</LD>
<LD>   One noteworthy school to receive recognition is the county-run
alternative Santiago Creek School in Santa Ana.</LD>
<LD>   The school recently won one of the commission's Bridges Award,
given--as the name suggests--for programs that build relationships
between students from troubled backgrounds and the larger community.</LD>
<TE>   The 50 students at Santiago Creek have been through personal
turmoil, having been removed from mainstream middle and high schools
for academic or emotional problems. One youngster had spray-painted
freeway overpasses with a moniker, Fale, which signaled his feeling
of inadequacy. The school's art program has redirected his energies,
inspiring him to produce watercolors and seascapes on canvas, and
masks with clay.</TE>
<TE>   The school also has an outreach program, which assigns troubled
youngsters to community service projects, such as mentoring disabled
teens and serving food to the homeless at a Santa Ana shelter.
Students describe the experience as lifting them to a new awareness
of their own value and helping them see that they can contribute to
society.</TE>
<TE>   Father Gregory Boyle, executive director of Jobs for a Future and
Homeboy Industries in Los Angeles, has said that troubled youngsters
need "heat and light," that is, pressure to change destructive
behavior and alternatives. Providing educational opportunity is in
the "light" part of the equation. It is a good way to keep youngsters
out of trouble so they don't need "heat." It steers them in new
directions.</TE>
<TE>   In providing its program for young people in need of new hope, the
Santiago Creek School is a leader in Orange County.</TE>

<HD>Irvine 'Sub-City' Plan Grossly Irresponsible</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Irvine 'Sub-City' Plan Attacked," June 10:</LD>
<LD>   The city of Irvine has demonstrated gross irresponsibility in
approving a plan for a "sub-city" in an area close to the former El
Toro Marine air base. The city leaders fiercely fought against an
airport in that area, claiming environmental concerns. The city,
though, sees nothing wrong with inviting 35,000 new residents into an
already densely populated area of Orange County. What are they
thinking? An overwhelming number of cars would be making daily trips
on freeways that simply cannot handle such an influx.</LD>
<LD>   This is a warning to the county regarding Irvine's lack of concern
for residents of Irvine and other cities. Keep in mind, these are the
same people who are working hard to annex the El Toro base. How can
we trust them to keep that huge piece of land safe from major
over-development?</LD>

<TE>   Re "Irvine Conundrum: People vs. Farmland," Letters, June 16:</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Co. Senior Vice President Michael LeBlanc states that "the
[Northern Sphere] project would add only between 2% and 4% to the
traffic on that portion of Interstate 5 over the next 20 years."</TE>
<TE>   The statement is misleading. For one, the concern is not over one
portion of the freeway but beyond. Most critical is the segment west
of Jamboree and onto the Costa Mesa Freeway. That segment is already
operating at below standard. Even a 2% increase would exacerbate the
stagnated traffic in the evening rush hours. The traffic study,
however, indicated an increase of 5% in that segment from the
project.</TE>
<TE>   But one cannot neglect other projects expected to come on
line--known and unknown. For known projects alone, the traffic level
is expected to increase as much as 33% over the next 20 years, and
13% by as early as 2007. It is these levels of increase that we will
encounter yet see no effective response from state or local agencies.</TE>
<TE>   One cannot assume that an ever-increasing number of vehicles can
be added to the Santa Ana Freeway without major modifications. But
realistically, double-decking a road is no solution to traffic
congestion and would not be acceptable to Caltrans, local residents
or the city of Tustin.</TE>
<TE>   The anticipated consequence is the inability of motorists to get
onto the freeway, or for those "suspended" in traffic on it to
abandon that route for adjoining roadways through neighboring
communities. The only major roadway paralleling the freeway west of
the project is Irvine Boulevard, which is already congested at rush
hour. What we will eventually have are "linear parking lots."</TE>

<TE>   Re "What Irvine Really Lacks Is a Sense of Irony," Dana Parsons
column, June 19:</TE>
<TE>   Parsons sort of disappointed me with his comparing the Irvine City
Hall's resistance to the Northern Sphere development with its strong
and long-drawn-out stand against the El Toro airport.</TE>
<TE>   The airport was a one-on-one grudge fight, whereas the Northern
Sphere project has another and better option. If City Hall presses
for more restrictions and asks for many concessions, the Irvine Co.
will just withdraw its development permit application and submit it
to the county, which has far less strict requirements. Although the
property is within Irvine's "sphere or influence," it is outside its
borders. It is an unincorporated area.</TE>
<TE>   The city staff and the council members did a terrific job of
negotiating with the Irvine Co. for the benefits of the residents.
And they should be commended. Out of the 7,100-acre project, more
than half (4,600 acres) will be more parks and more open space. A
total of 1,800 units of the 12,350 homes will be affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of trying to generate and connect an irony, Parsons and
[task force member] Richard Deskin, who both knew about the county
option, should have wondered why the Irvine Co. didn't go directly to
the county and greatly padded its bottom line. The story on this
angle would have given the readers a better insight.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Group Wants Irvine Project Put to a Vote," June 21:</TE>
<TE>   I'm a little confused. A spokesman for Newport Beach Defend the
Bay says that people moved to Irvine "with the promise there would be
open space and agricultural land.... Now to learn it's being taken
away, people are mad."</TE>
<TE>   If this is so important to the Defend the Bay folks, why weren't
they screaming about building a 28-million-passenger airport right
next to this land at El Toro? The airport would have added thousands
of vehicle trips per day and dumped thousands of pounds of
particulate matter over that area, which, it seems to me, would find
its way into the bay they are supposed to be defending.</TE>

<TE>   I tend to respect a city's right to govern without interference
from neighboring cities, but what if a decision has a direct impact
on those neighbors? Such is the case with Irvine's aggressive plan to
create a "sub-city" in its Northern Sphere area. Those additional
projected 35,000 residents and 250,000 daily automobile trips,
combined with the projected new business and shopping centers in the
plan, certainly will impact all county citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's time to take a serious look at overall county planning
and start enforcing more stringent regulations in order to prevent a
city from making irresponsible decisions that adversely affect their
neighbors.</TE>

<TE>   Nice try, Newport Beach. Your worry about the preservation of our

airport.</TE>
<TE>   Have you given any thought to what all of the pollution and
carcinogens from the airplanes overhead would do to those precious
strawberry fields?</TE>
<TE>   I'll take my chances with the housing.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Mayor Larry Agran and City Councilman Chris Mears should be
ashamed of themselves for engaging in a smear campaign against Defend
the Bay and its director, Robert Caustin.</TE>
<TE>   Agran and Mears have accused Defend the Bay of being backed by
pro-airport money, but have never once offered any proof.</TE>
<TE>   I'd like to know how opposing more sludge in Newport Bay is
pro-airport. I'd like to know how opposing the transfer of 8,000
housing units into the Northern Sphere is pro-airport. And I'd like
to know how any of this is relevant, considering the Navy has stated
that they will sell off the El Toro base in parcels for nonaviation
uses once Irvine annexes the land.</TE>
<TE>   El Toro airport is dead. But that doesn't seem to stop Agran and
Mears from using Joe McCarthy tactics in destroying the reputation of
any citizen exercising his right to be heard.</TE>

<LD>Re "School Mascot Protesters, Police Clash Outside Fullerton
Meeting," June 19:</LD>
<LD>   As a recent graduate of Fullerton High School, I'm disappointed
and frustrated with the school board's inaction in addressing the
Native American community on the school's use of the Indian mascot.</LD>
<LD>   To say that the mascot gives students "Indian Pride" is
offensively misleading; never in my four years at the school was I
given any lessons on Indian pride, the struggles of Native Americans
or the culture of indigenous peoples beyond what is normally covered
in any American civics class. Our "Indian Pride" consisted of
dressing up in stereotypical feathery headdresses and doing something
vaguely resembling a tomahawk chop during football games to root our
team to victory. Not only is this a laughable cliche, but it does
nothing to provide education on what Native American culture is.
Wildcats and eagles, maybe, but it's time to stop our culturally
insensitive use of groups of people as mascots.</LD>

<LD>Re "A Morally Repugnant Act," Orange County Commentary, June 23:</LD>
<LD>   Huntington Beach's race-based transfer policy highlights the need
for adopting an initiative on racial privacy. It shows that
administrators continue to feel comfortable using race as a
criterion, despite the passage of Proposition 209. It is encouraging
to see the appellate court overturn them, but as long as bureaucrats
are permitted to collect this data, we will continue to see
discriminatory programs.</LD>
<LD>   Most race-based programs collect this information intending to
help the disadvantaged. Unfortunately, as is the case with
Huntington's program, they often harm those they are meant to help.
Earlier civil rights activists would be rolling in their graves if
they knew the legacy of their work prevented minorities from freely
choosing their schools. It's the exact problem they worked to fix in
the first place.</LD>
<TE>   Those who argue that racial classifications can be used to help
minorities not only ignore the potential for those classifications to
be used maliciously, but also, more important, they ignore the
unintended harmful effects of benevolent activists. Let's adopt the
initiative and begin working toward a truly colorblind society.</TE>

<LD>Re "We on the Gay Right Find Diplomacy Can Work Wonders," Commentary,

<LD>   Norah Vincent is trying to separate herself from what she calls
the "gay left." Nice try, Norah, but it won't work. Most of the
writings I have read of hers do not put her on the conservative side
of issues. The so-called battles she refers to occur because she and
her ilk continue to talk about their sexual appetites. It is almost
an obsession. I really don't care about how she dresses and what her
sexual proclivities are, and I wonder why she thinks so many others
care.</LD>

<LD>Re "Animal-Rights Measure Gains in Surf City," June 23:</LD>
<LD>   The story about Huntington Beach considering a ban on animal acts,
and even pony rides, really raises my blood pressure. The so-called
animal-rights activists are up to their usual "terror" tactics. They
want to dictate how people should act and think, and if they are not
in agreement with them they destroy businesses and property.</LD>
<LD>   I am pushing 80 and was the first female circus press agent. I
married into the circus. In those days you had to work at something,
and I wasn't built for a trapeze. Aside from my ringmaster husband,
my great love was the animals.</LD>
<TE>   In all the years of working for the circuses, I never saw an
animal mistreated; however, I am not saying it never happened. Circus
animals, or any animal act, for that matter, means bread and butter
for their trainer, and wouldn't it be stupid to endanger your
livelihood?</TE>

<LD>Re "Improving Bus Service Vital" editorial, June 23:</LD>
<LD>   When my plane landed at LAX last week from Denver, the stewardess
announced, "You are now in Los Angeles, California, which means you
will need a car." I knew exactly what she meant, having just
experienced the excellent RTD Sky Ride bus service available
throughout greater Denver and its surrounding cities.</LD>
<LD>   I was able to board a bus three miles away in a city south of
Denver and get to the airport traveling 35 miles through Denver,
making five stops and arriving at the airport--exactly on time--in
less than 70 minutes. Cost: $10 ($5 for seniors). The same trip by
car would have taken almost an hour through heavy traffic.</LD>
<TE>   June Maguire</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Times assessment of the need for Bus Rapid Transit in Orange
County has merit, but the editorial ignores critical system issues.</TE>
<TE>   There are several forms: One has buses sharing the roadway with
other traffic; a second confiscates part of the roadway for dedicated
bus use. The second might be a bit faster when traffic builds, but
would increase congestion by reducing the capacity for normal and
commercial traffic.</TE>
<TE>   The cost difference for these alternatives is dramatic. If The
Times is serious about wanting improved transportation for all, it
should promote the first, less-expensive option. Less expensive means
more service can be provided for more commuters. But even in the
Orange County Transportation Agency's most optimistic projections,
demand for transit will remain a small portion of our transportation
needs.</TE>
<TE>   The editorial gives the impression that public transit is not
given adequate attention by OCTA. Nothing could be further from the
truth. OCTA's Ten Point Strategy for the next 10 years allocates 60%
of funds for transit. More than 90% of OCTA's operating budget is
devoted to transit. Hardly an inadequate proportion for the few
percent of transit riders.</TE>

<TE>   We live in Capistrano Beach above the beach and the rail tracks.
We enjoy looking at the trains going by. We understand the need for a
second track system, yet also realize the danger of faster trains and
vibration concerns for the bluffs.</TE>
<TE>   As for the alternatives--second tracks, buried tracks, inland
tracks--we have a compromise solution. Keep the track system that is
in place between San Clemente and San Juan Capistrano for passenger
trains. Create a second line around San Clemente to north of San Juan
Capistrano inland for freight trains.</TE>
<TE>   This would allow passenger trains to run on time and give better
service. It would also preserve the present train stations and
provide more safety for the beach-going public and the bluff system.
This would also allow the freight system a safer and more on-time
routing.</TE>
<TE>   It is time to look at alternatives since the rail system is an
asset to the people of California.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Nurse Shortage Hurts All" Letters, June 8.</LD>
<LD>   It is unfortunate that a longtime retired physician is judging the
nursing shortage on his past experience. Dr. Michael T. Kennedy
referred to a situation that happened more than 10 years ago when
Mission Hospital was a for-profit hospital. And in fact, the incident
he referred to did not result in a mass departure of nurses.</LD>
<LD>   There are many factors that play into the nation's nursing
shortage. The average age of nurses is 44 and many are coming upon
retirement. There is a lack of new nurses to replace them as the
number of students entering nursing colleges has steadily decreased.
Also, nurses have many more employment options, including
pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers.</LD>
<TE>   Since 1994, Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center has been part
of the St. Joseph Health System and operating as a not-for-profit
hospital under new leadership. We are working on solutions to the
nursing shortage by part- nering with our local nursing school as
well as assisting nursing students with tuition. We are also
developing a Nursing Center of Excellence to retain and attract new
nurses.</TE>
<TE>   Every one of our employees is a valued part of Mission Hospital
and we strive to provide a quality work life.</TE>

<LD>Re "Removed School Paper Advisor Says Opinion Pieces Did Her In,"
June 22</LD>
<LD>   The story about the school paper advisor who was removed from her
post and reassigned to an English class by an administrator and the
Garden Grove School District because "the paper needed to take a new
direction" is distressing but not unusual. Where are the parents'
students, and teachers' voices of protest? This is an opportune time
for the adults to work with the students to find an appropriate way
to fight for something they see as worth saving. I find it sickening
that in our democracy, administrative educators are allowed to bully
gifted teachers who are so badly needed in our public schools. These
bullies in education only exist with the express permission of
silence from students, parents, and teachers.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "AP Courses That Look Good--on Paper," June 25:</LD>
<LD>   The article highlights only some of the failures of the Advanced
Placement system. There is competitive pressure on high schools to
offer an array of AP classes but not enough qualified teachers to
teach them. There is pressure on students to take these classes to
"pad" their college applications but not enough are qualified to take
these college level offerings.</LD>
<LD>   Also, because AP classes are weighted, there is pressure on
students to take classes they have no interest in just to raise their
grade-point averages. The AP program needs an overhaul.</LD>
<TE>   Remove the weighting so there are no benefits beyond a student's
intrinsic interest in exploring the subject in more depth. Offer
classes only when a qualified teacher who enjoys the subject is
available, rather than "assigning" teachers. Encourage students to
explore advanced course work in areas in which they have an interest
so they will do the necessary coursework. Discourage those who do not
have the fundamentals and work ethic to perform at a college level.</TE>
<TE>   Return the AP high school program to its original purpose--to give
eager students the opportunity to explore the subjects offered by
teachers who are passionate and knowledgeable about that subject,
with the only goal, knowledge. What a novel idea!</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re: "Coad Threat to Base's Future" editorial, June 16:</LD>
<LD>   Supervisor Cynthia Coad was acting responsibly in trying to ensure
a small degree of equity between north Orange County cities, which
have 75% of the population and few parks, and South County cities,
which have 40 times the park acreage with one-fourth the population.
But even with an "ironclad" agreement, North County cities would
never see the park money.</LD>
<LD>   However, the crux of your argument is that Coad should vote to
turn over control of the former El Toro Marine base to Irvine so that
Irvine can annex the land and also control the surrounding
unincorporated land.</LD>
<TE>   For the county to turn over control of this large tract of land to
Irvine would be an abdication of the county's responsibility. Since
the authority of Measure W is by no means assured, the county must
retain control of the former base until the lawsuit against Measure W
is resolved. Coad must rescind her vote turning over the base to
Irvine and the developers.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Poor Gary Simon, the former county El Toro project manager. He
lost his lucrative position trying to peddle an unwanted and unneeded
airport at El Toro and now complains in his letter of June 23 that
"only about 10% of the Orange County population voted to reject the
airport plan. That small percentage made a land-use decision for the
entire county."</TE>
<TE>   Playing Simon's irrelevant numbers game, we can state
unequivocally that only 7% of the Orange County population voted for
an airport at El Toro on March 5. The low turnout in the primary
election of March 2002 cannot be compared with the higher vote in the
general election of November 1994, but the countywide vote for
Measure A that mandated an airport won by a slim 2% of the vote--51%
to 49%--compared with the repeal of Measure A by a margin of 16
percentage points with the passage of Measure W by a vote of 58% to
42%. To say that the 297,735 votes for Measure W represents only 10%
of Orange County's 2.9 million residents is silly.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, Measure A land-use planning--51% to 49%--is acceptable
to Simon; but Measure W--58% to 42%--is not.</TE>
<TE>   In any event, under the federal Base Realignment and Closure Act,
how to use a closed military base must be decided primarily by the
residents living near the facility.</TE>
<TE>   The 10 cities making up the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority are
adjacent to El Toro and voted overwhelmingly to repeal Measure A on
March 5. Aliso Viejo voters approved Measure W by a vote of 93.9%;
Laguna Woods, 92.8%; Lake Forest, 92.4%; Laguna Niguel, 92.4%; Rancho
Santa Margarita, 90.4%; Laguna Hills, 89.8%; Mission Viejo, 88.8%,
Laguna Beach, 88.2%, Irvine, 86.0% and Dana Point, 82.6%.</TE>
<TE>   Does Simon believe the 59% pro-airport vote in Yorba Linda should
be given the same weight as the 90% anti-airport vote in the cities
surrounding El Toro?</TE>
<TE>   In ruling against Measure F, which received a 67% favorable vote
in 2000, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge S. James Otero stated,
"Should the citizens of the county of Orange not wish to proceed with
the building of an airport at the El Toro facility, they can
seemingly accomplish this in a variety of ways, including the passage
of an initiative repealing Measure A." That is why Measure W--an
initiative to repeal Measure A--was put on the ballot, and that is
why lawsuits to overturn Measure W will fail.</TE>

<TE>   Re: "Navy Target of El Toro Lawsuit, June 20:</TE>
<TE>   The same group of zealots that has been trying for years to force
airport development at El Toro knows no shame. Now, when our nation
is at war with terrorism and under threat of attack, the group sues
the Navy, the Department of Defense and Defense Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld.</TE>
<TE>   The group is piqued that the voters of Orange County had the
temerity to reject the county's ill-conceived plan for a commercial
airport at El Toro, and that the Navy says it will abide by the will
of the voters. This lawsuit is supported by the Orange County
Regional Airport Authority and, through it, the taxpayers in the
cities that make up the authority: Anaheim, Buena Park, Costa Mesa,
Cypress, Garden Grove, La Habra, Los Alamitos, Newport Beach,
Placentia, Seal Beach, Stanton, Villa Park, Westminster and Yorba
Linda. It's time for the people in those cities to pull the plug on
this lawsuit and the authority.</TE>

<HD>Bolivia Hungry for Changes</HD>
<DH>South America: Vote to elect a president and Congress comes
amid protests and stark poverty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HUATAJATA, Bolivia</DL>
<LD>In this town on the edge of Lake Titicaca, presidential candidate
Felipe Quispe, an Aymara Indian, talks openly of starting a war
against the government. Fifty miles away, on the outskirts of La Paz,
the capital, thousands of peasants are marching to demand that
Bolivia's Constitution be thrown out and rewritten.</LD>
<LD>   The presidential candidates of the major parties are dancing
around an unspoken truth: Bolivia is broke, and there is little money
to pay for all the new jobs, hospitals and schools that the
contenders in today's elections are promising to bring to this
desperately poor country.</LD>
<LD>   "The political system has reached a point of exhaustion," said
Sacha Llorentti of the Permanent Assembly of Human Rights in Bolivia,
a nongovernmental organization here. "And at the same time we are
seeing new groups trying to force their way into the system."</LD>
<TE>   Racked by Divisions</TE>
<TE>   Bolivian voters will elect a new president and 157-member Congress
today. Like no other election in this nation's convulsive history, it
has brought to the fore Bolivia's gaping ethnic, regional and social
chasms.</TE>
<TE>   Already one of Latin America's poorest nations, Bolivia is in its
second year of recession. Its growing budget deficit is
proportionally larger than that of Argentina, the region's
better-known crisis economy.</TE>
<TE>   "We Bolivians have a tremendous capacity for putting up with
hunger," said Antonio Peredo, vice presidential candidate of the
Movement Toward Socialism, which is running third in some surveys
here. "But now things are so bad that more than half the people don't
know what it [means] to have bread and sugar."</TE>
<TE>   Cry for 'Positive Change'</TE>
<TE>   The man widely expected to finish first in the presidential race,
Manfred Reyes Villa, is the 47-year-old mayor of Cochabamba and
founder of the New Republican Force. A former military man, Reyes
Villa has portrayed himself as an outsider because he is not a member
of one of the four parties that have dominated Bolivian politics for
decades.</TE>
<TE>   Bolivia needs "positive change," Reyes Villa says, repeating his
campaign's catch phrase. Among other things, he promises to double
the nation's education budget.</TE>
<TE>   But even if Reyes Villa finishes first, he might not become
Bolivia's next president. If no candidate wins a majority, the top
two vote-getters proceed to a runoff in Congress on Aug. 6.
Traditionally, Congress has picked a president only after weeks of
back-room deal-making.</TE>
<TE>   No matter who is elected, political observers doubt that any of
the major parties can govern Bolivia, which has been shaken for
months by a series of protest movements, most in its vast and
impoverished interior.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the most violent demonstrations have been against the
current government's moves to eradicate coca farming, in which the
leaves are used to make both cocaine and traditional remedies. The
most prominent opponent of the crackdown has been Evo Morales, a
former coca farmer and founder of the Movement Toward Socialism.
Morales has become a cult hero to many here since legislators voted
this year--under intense pressure from the U.S. government--to remove
him from his seat in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a big mistake on the part of the political elite to kick
him out of Congress," said Carlos Toranzo, project coordinator for
ILDIS, a La Paz think tank. The U.S. Embassy was seen here as being
behind the removal. "Now Evo Morales has become a symbol of Bolivian
dignity and sovereignty," Toranzo said.</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, Morales has moved beyond his base of support
among coca farmers in Bolivia's tropical east and south to build
alliances with the urban left, a coalition symbolized by his choice
of candidate for vice president, Peredo. The candidate is a member of
a prominent La Paz leftist family, and his brothers joined Che
Guevara's failed Bolivian guerrilla movement in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   "The coca farmers aren't the only marginalized people in this
country," said Peredo, who was exiled from Bolivia during the
dictatorship that gave way to democracy in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   The Movement Toward Socialism has become the first truly national
party here with Indian leadership. And Morales, an Aymara with mostly
Quecha supporters, could win a Senate seat in the election.</TE>
<TE>   Rallying Indian Voters</TE>
<TE>   Several members of Quispe's Pachakuti Indigenous Movement are
expected to be elected to Congress. Despite its low single-digit
showing in national surveys, Quispe's party has a strong following in
the Altiplano plateau around La Paz, home to the Aymara people.</TE>
<TE>   His one-truck campaign caravan recently spent a day in the
impoverished Aymara towns around Lake Titicaca, passing out posters
that urged villagers to "vote for your blood."</TE>
<TE>   "The Mallku is here," people called out as Quispe neared, using
the Aymara word for condor, a term of respect for community leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "I am going to win, I will govern, and for the first time an
Indian will be president of this country," Quispe said in an
interview in Huatajata. "And we are going to return this land to its
rightful owners."</TE>
<TE>   If he becomes the next president, Bolivia as such will cease to
exist, Quispe said. It will return to the Aymaras, Quechuas and other
native peoples, who will raise their seven-color flag in place of
Bolivia's green, yellow and red one, which Quispe sees as the
imposition of Europeans.</TE>
<TE>   And if the needs of Bolivia's Indians--who form the overwhelming
majority of the nation's population--are not met, Quispe says there
will be war.</TE>
<TE>   "Things will get serious very quickly," said Quispe, who rose to
prominence as president of Bolivia's largest peasants union. "It will
be like Chiapas," he said, referring to the 1990s insurrection of
indigenous people in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks before the election, thousands of peasants have been
marching across Bolivia toward La Paz, threatening to disrupt the
vote with their demand that Congress immediately convene a popular
assembly to rewrite the constitution.</TE>
<TE>   Given the general clamor for reform, even the centrist and
right-wing candidates in today's election are taking a populist tack.</TE>
<TE>   Front-runner Reyes Villa has flooded the airwaves with ads
promising new government programs to pull Bolivia out of its
recession by spending millions of dollars on everything from job
programs to salary increases for teachers and school buses for rural
children.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an excellent campaign strategy," said Toranzo of ILDIS. "But
it's not a good strategy to govern. A populist administration simply
isn't possible at the moment. If he gives the people everything he's
promising, the government will collapse in less than a year."</TE>

<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>He has been in the Israeli Cabinet for less than three months, but
Effi Eitam says his influence is easy to see: Just look to the tanks
rolling back into West Bank towns and villages.</LD>
<LD>   What many regard as the final blow to the battered 1993 Oslo peace
accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization is
for Eitam moral vindication.</LD>
<LD>   Until recently, the 50-year-old retired general, an Orthodox Jew,
was regarded here as a charismatic but marginal figure, a far-right
ideologue with messianic impulses. A career soldier and respected
battlefield commander, he quit the army in 1999 because, he said, he
understood that his political views and religious convictions made
further promotion impossible.</LD>
<TE>   But as Israel's security crisis has deepened, Eitam has moved from
the fringe to the center of the political debate with his calls for
the government to destroy the Palestinian Authority, expel its
leaders and reoccupy the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   And Eitam has moved to the heart of political power.</TE>
<TE>   Three months ago, he was named head of the National Religious
Party, a Zionist Orthodox party whose base lies with the Jewish
settlers living in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. From there, he
catapulted into the government as a minister without portfolio--and
into the prestigious security Cabinet, the small grouping of senior
ministers who set defense policy with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   Eitam says his mission has been to bring "moral clarity" to
Israel's battle with Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat
and his administration, to fashion a response to the Palestinian
leadership based on his belief that they are "coming from the darkest
part of evil on Earth."</TE>
<TE>   In the Cabinet, Eitam's has been a consistent voice urging an
escalation of the conflict with the Palestinians. He has advocated
the retaking of the entire West Bank and the arrest and trial of
Arafat and senior Palestinian officials. He has warned that Israel's
Arab minority is a "ticking bomb" threatening to destroy Israeli
democracy.</TE>
<TE>   His hard-line constituency had chafed at Sharon's unwillingness to
follow Eitam's prescription for achieving military victory over the
Palestinians. "Where is Effi?" graffiti taunted, an allusion to his
perceived inability to be heard.</TE>
<TE>   But a rising tide of Palestinian suicide bombings has moved
Sharon--and most of the government--closer to Eitam's views.</TE>
<TE>   The security Cabinet recently announced that Israel will reoccupy
large swaths of the West Bank "until terror stops." Eitam quickly
claimed credit for the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "Sharon has understood that in the next year there is no other way
to defend the state of Israel and its citizens without taking
security control of all of the territories," Eitam told Nahum Barnea,
a respected political analyst with the mass-circulation Israeli daily
Yediot Aharonot. "I convinced him."</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Eitam said in the interview, Arafat will be banished to the
Gaza Strip, where he can establish what Eitam called "Arafatistan"
behind the security fence that Israel has built. Israel, he said,
will retain control of the West Bank, captured from Jordan in the
1967 Middle East War.</TE>
<TE>   The mainstreaming of Eitam's hard-line views reflects the despair
that Israelis feel after nearly two years of bloody battle with the
Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Eulogizing an Israeli woman and her 5-year-old granddaughter
killed in a Jerusalem suicide attack this month, Eitam issued a
near-biblical call for revenge that captured the sense among Israelis
that they are living through the latest chapter in the ancient Jewish
struggle for existence.</TE>
<TE>   "I look up at you [Arabs] on the hilltop," Eitam said, "and I see
your large houses and your closed shutters--we know that behind those
shutters, you are now happy ... [but it is] the happiness of
Philistines, the joy of the uncircumcised, the merriment of little
people."</TE>
<TE>   You "are experts of impurity, cursedness and evil," he said. "But
we are the blessed." The Jews, he said, "have returned home for our
rendezvous with the Lion of the World and the Lioness that is our
Nation."</TE>
<TE>   He warned: "And when we pounce on you, and it will happen--when we
come with vengeance against your terrible evil, woe will be unto
you--we will make a reckoning with you."</TE>
<TE>   Eitam's critics on the left view him as one of the far right's
most dangerous politicians. Yossi Sarid, leader of the Meretz Party,
dubbed him a "false messiah," and others have likened him to the
far-right French presidential candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen.</TE>
<TE>   "That you have somebody like him in the government is a deep
blemish on our society," said Rabbi Michael Melchior of the Meimad
Party, a dovish Orthodox party. "I just totally disagree with him
about what is Jewish morality, what are Jewish values."</TE>
<TE>   But as Israel's security situation deteriorates, Melchior said,
Eitam's influence is likely to grow. "There is a danger from people
who are charismatic and have very populistic, simplistic answers to
our problems," he said. "It is the danger of a situation where you
can find people ready to buy practically anything if they believe it
will bring peace and security."</TE>
<TE>   Even an old friend, left-wing activist Raya Harnik, who fought for
Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon after her son was killed there
during the 1982 invasion, said she is afraid that Eitam will
eventually attain his stated ambition of becoming prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   Harnik said her unusual friendship with Eitam began when they met
at a memorial service for the fallen of her son's army unit 15 years
ago. Eitam, her son's first commander, said he had wanted to console
her when he died but feared that their political differences were so
deep that "he would only cause me pain," Harnik recalled. "I said: 'I
would speak to Yasser Arafat--why can't I speak to you?' "</TE>
<TE>   Eitam visited her in Jerusalem, Harnik said, and the two soon
found that they had little in common politically but much in common
in their emotional attachment to the Jewish state. They have
maintained the friendship since.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Harnik said, she worries that Eitam has entered politics at
a time when Israelis are receptive to extremist solutions.</TE>
<TE>   "He speaks of bringing morality back to politics, but I'm sure
that Stalin also thought he was restoring morality," Harnik said.
Political analysts say that for the moment, Eitam's chances of
becoming prime minister are minuscule. He leads a party that holds
just five seats in the Knesset, Israel's parliament. But Eitam is
widely expected to lead the NRP into an alliance with Sharon's Likud
Party after the next national elections.</TE>
<TE>   With support for Likud soaring in polls, the party is expected to
have a good chance of forming the next government. If the NRP
increases its parliamentary seats, analysts say, Eitam could
reasonably expect to be named defense minister in a Likud government,
a post that would position him to battle for the leadership of the
Likud once Sharon retires.</TE>
<TE>   Eitam, soft-spoken and intense, rejects the notion that he is
proposing simplistic or dangerous solutions to Israel's troubles. On
the contrary, he said in an interview with The Times, he is proposing
realistic solutions for both sides.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing the skullcap and long beard of a religiously observant
Jew, Eitam asked politely that he not be portrayed "as a crazy
person" in this article.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that the Palestinian people deserve a state of their
own," he said. "But I don't believe that anybody can think of the
Gaza Strip and 90% of Judea and Samaria [the biblical terms for the
West Bank] as a state. Dividing the West Bank into two satisfied,
sovereign states is impossible."</TE>
<TE>   Since Israel signed the Oslo accords, the territories ceded to the
Palestinians have become "a base of terror," and the Palestinian
Authority leaders "made their own people become crazy, lunatic people
committed to death and to a dark ritual of killing," Eitam said.
There is no possibility, he said, that Israel will divide rule over
the West Bank with such an entity.</TE>
<TE>   His solution is a "regional solution" that will call on Jordan and
Egypt to cede territory to the Palestinians that will then become a
divided Palestinian state on the east side of the Jordan River and in
the northern Sinai desert. Only such a redivision of territory, Eitam
said, can ensure regional stability by leaving all four peoples with
viable states.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have pointed out that neither Egypt nor Jordan seems
likely to participate in such a solution to the problem, which the
Arab states believe can only be resolved by deep Israeli territorial
concessions.</TE>
<TE>   Born to left-wing parents, Eitam grew up on Kibbutz Ein Gev, on
the edge of the Sea of Galilee. He was secular until the 1973 Yom
Kippur War, when he lived through the near collapse of Israel in the
face of a surprise attack by Arab armies. The experience led him to a
spiritual rebirth and to move to Moshav Nov on the Golan Heights with
his wife, Ilit. They have raised eight children.</TE>
<TE>   Eitam said he feels he has a mission in politics: to serve as an
example for other nationalistic, religiously observant young people
and lead them into bastions of power traditionally dominated by
secular Zionists of the center left.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to pave the way for a new generation of leaders who will
not be afraid of combining politics and ideology, who will show that
politics and integrity can come together," he said.</TE>

<HD>20 Settlements Will Be Razed</HD>
<DH>West Bank: Israel says the Jewish outposts are hard to
protect and do not have prior approval.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>The Israeli government will start dismantling illegally built Jewish
settlements in the West Bank today because of the difficulty of
protecting them, Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The defense minister promised that 10 settlements will be removed
by the end of the day and that another 10 will disappear in coming
days. Negotiations with settlement leaders were reportedly underway
Saturday in an effort to avoid the kind of ugly confrontation between
settlers and the Israeli army that has occurred in the past.</LD>
<LD>   The sites in question are remote outposts of established
settlements, often no more than clusters of mobile homes flying
Israeli flags on scrubby West Bank hills. Even though they are small
and relatively easy to move, the outposts constitute an emotionally
charged issue for both Palestinians and Israelis. While Palestinians
consider them an affront to their sovereignty, many Israelis resent
the burden they pose on the army, which has the responsibility of
protecting them.</LD>
<TE>   "These outposts are very isolated and have very few people in
them, which is a security threat of the first degree," Ben-Eliezer
said Saturday night on Israeli television. He did not identify the
specific settlements to be dismantled.</TE>
<TE>   The Defense Ministry must approve any new settlements in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. The outposts to be dismantled have never
received government approval.</TE>
<TE>   Ben-Eliezer made the promise to start the demolitions immediately
at a meeting earlier Saturday of the Labor Party, which he heads. He
is facing criticism from some party members who believe that Labor
has lost credibility because of its coalition with hard-line Likud
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, particularly in the midst of Israel's
harsh crackdown on the Palestinians as part of a campaign to root out
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday night, a settler leader, Hasdai Eliezer, chastised
Ben-Eliezer for a purely "political act" designed to appease critics
within his party. He complained that the decision to dismantle
settlements would "reward terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Defense Ministry officials said Ben-Eliezer hoped to reach an
agreement with the settlers before the army moved in with bulldozers.</TE>
<TE>   "The minister does not want a forceful evacuation. He wants it to
be done voluntarily," said Yarden Vatikai, a Defense Ministry
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Peace Now, an Israeli group that opposes settlements, released a
report Saturday saying that at least 44 settlement sites have been
established in the West Bank since Sharon was elected in February
2001. Sharon is credited with having directed the occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip after the territories were captured by
Israel in the 1967 Middle East War and is widely considered the
patron saint of the settler movement.</TE>
<TE>   The outpost settlements are most vulnerable to attack by
Palestinian militants because they are often outside perimeter
fences. Three particularly brutal slayings occurred this month at one
such settlement, Karmei Tzur, near Hebron, where a woman who was nine
months pregnant, her husband and an Israeli reserve soldier were
gunned down by Palestinian militants.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of the outpost communities are considered the most
radical of the settlers.</TE>
<TE>   "They imitate the Wild West. They have horses. They have cattle.
They have guns. They are playing cowboy and treating others, in this
case the Palestinians, as though they are the Indians," said Amiram
Goldblum, a settlement expert with Peace Now.</TE>
<TE>   Goldblum said that although removing the thinly populated outposts
might address some Labor Party complaints about Ben-Eliezer, it would
do little to address the larger problem of the settlements.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not even a drop in the bucket. More like a drop in the
well," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Roughly 200,000 people live in 145 settlements in the West Bank
and Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   In other developments Saturday, the Israeli army sifted through
the wreckage of the former Palestinian security headquarters in
Hebron looking for the bodies of 15 Palestinian militants who it says
were holed up inside. The four-story building, which had dominated
the Hebron skyline, was blown up by the army Friday night in a
tremendous explosion that broke windows more than 200 yards away.</TE>
<TE>   When no bodies were found over the course of the day, Palestinians
charged that Israel had destroyed the building out of spite, not to
root out militants.</TE>
<TE>   Israel, charged Palestinian Information Minister Yasser
Abed-Rabbo, wants to impose "its rule upon the Palestinian people and
to destroy all symbols of the Palestinian Authority."</TE>

<HD>Election Delay Sought in Kenya</HD>
<DH>Africa: Leader's call for an extended parliament session is
seen as a bid to prolong his rule.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya</DL>
<LD>NAIROBI, Kenya -- President Daniel Arap Moi has called for an
extension of Kenya's current parliament session--and his final term
in office--so that elections can be held under a constitution now
being drafted.</LD>
<LD>   The move would delay elections planned for later this year, and
analysts said it is designed to prolong Moi's 24-year rule beyond
constitutional limits.</LD>
<LD>   But Moi, 77, one of Africa's longest-serving heads of state,
pledged Saturday to retire after the next elections.</LD>
<TE>   "The time for my retirement has arrived ... after the next general
elections," he told tens of thousands of supporters at a rally in a
Nairobi slum.</TE>
<TE>   The Constitution of Kenya Review Commission announced this year
that it would not be able to finish its work of drafting a new
constitution until 2003. Lawmakers from Moi's Kenya African National
Union party, or KANU, have proposed extending the panel's deadline to
May 15, 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Moi announced his support of extending parliament's session at a
dinner Friday to celebrate KANU's merger with the largest opposition
party, the National Democratic Party.</TE>
<TE>   Raila Odinga, the former leader of the Democratic Party and now
secretary-general of KANU, said that as an opposition leader he had
wanted the next election to be under a new constitution, and his view
had not changed after joining KANU.</TE>
<TE>   Kenya was a one-party state until Moi, under pressure from the
international community, allowed multiparty elections in 1992.
Opposition parties, though, have been splintered and KANU has
maintained control of the country.</TE>
<TE>   The merger of KANU and the National Democratic Party was a major
blow to the three other opposition parties, which have not formed a
united front in the race against KANU. If KANU's proposals to delay
the elections proceed, analysts say that the balloting might be
deferred until after October 2003, when Moi would celebrate 25 years
in power.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition leaders have vowed to cause civil unrest if KANU pushes
ahead with the move to extend parliament's session.</TE>
<TE>   When the ruling party lawmakers first proposed the idea of
extending parliament, the U.S. and British embassies condemned the
proposal, insisting that elections be held this year as planned.
Independent watchdog groups also have denounced the idea to delay
elections.</TE>
<TE>   "It is [Moi] who is extending parliament, simply because he is not
ready to go," said John Githongo, head of the Kenya branch of
Transparency International.</TE>

<HD>Koreas Each Seek Apology</HD>
<DH>Asia: Seoul blames the North for sea battle that left four
of its sailors dead. Southerners trespassed and fired first,
Pyongyang claims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>South Korea demanded an apology from North Korea and punishment for
those responsible Saturday after a deadly skirmish in the Yellow Sea
killed four of its sailors and injured nearly two dozen others.</LD>
<LD>   The North, however, quickly said that it was the one owed an
apology, charging that vessels from the South had trespassed in the
sea off the peninsula's western coast and fired first.</LD>
<LD>   Their warships "intruded deep into our territorial waters," the
North said on the state-run Korean Central News Agency. "The incident
was a premeditated military provocation on the part of the South
Korean military from A to Z."</LD>
<TE>   Regional political and military specialists, meanwhile, were
poring over emerging details in hopes of gaining some insight into
what happened, why, and how high up the North Korean leadership chain
any decision might have been made.</TE>
<TE>   According to the South Korean military, two North Korean naval
ships were sailing with a fleet of fishing vessels Saturday morning
north of the so-called Northern Limit Line, or sea border.</TE>
<TE>   At 9:54 and 10:01 a.m., by this account, the North's two ships
crossed into South Korean territory, 25 miles west of the island of
Yonpyong, while leaving the fishing fleet behind. Four South Korean
patrol boats caught up with them roughly 25 minutes later to issue a
warning and steer them back across the border.</TE>
<TE>   Craft from North Korea have made several incursions recently along
the sea border, which is not officially recognized by the government
in Pyongyang. The Communist nation has dire food shortages, and fish
and crab are plentiful in the area this time of year. The South
Korean crew reportedly assumed that Saturday's contact would follow
the usual pattern, with the North's ships turning around after being
warned.</TE>
<TE>   But as one of the South Korean vessels came within 500 yards of
the westernmost North Korean ship, the South said, it was fired upon.</TE>
<TE>   In the hail of shells, a lieutenant and three enlisted men on the
South's patrol boat were killed, and at least 18 sailors were listed
as injured, with one missing. The shelling also set the engine room
on fire.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as the other South Korean patrol boats realized what had
happened, they opened fire. This inflicted heavy damage on the North
Korean ship, which began to burn as well. The North has not disclosed
how many injuries or casualties it suffered; the ships each can carry
up to 50 people. Each side then called for backup help to tow its
damaged vessel out of the area to safety.</TE>
<TE>   The North Korean ships retreated across the border at 10:50 a.m.
But the South Korean boat sank as it was being towed back to base,
delaying any investigation into what weaponry was used against it and
how many shells were fired.</TE>
<TE>   The South Korean military said that a squadron of fighter jets was
then brought in to patrol the sea border along with a 1,200-ton
battleship.</TE>
<TE>   If, as military analysts believe, the South's vessel suffered a
direct hit by one or more 85-millimeter shells from about a quarter
of a mile away, it's not surprising that it was badly damaged. Those
weapons have a range of nine miles.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington on Saturday, the State Department expressed
condolences to the relatives of the slain naval personnel and said it
stood behind the South Korean government.</TE>
<TE>   "We support the stance of our allies against armed provocation,"
said Brenda Greenberg, a State Department spokeswoman. "We regret the
loss of life and injuries, and we want to express our sympathy to the
families."</TE>
<TE>   Greenberg added that officials from the U.S. Embassy in Seoul and
the United States forces in South Korea had been in close contact
with South Korean authorities about the incident.</TE>
<TE>   The reports that the North Korean ships crossed the border into
the South's crab-rich waters alone, without any fishing vessels, and
opened fire after receiving a warning over loudspeakers led many
experts to conclude that the incident was premeditated.</TE>
<TE>   "The circumstantial evidence suggests it's intentional," said
Masao Okonogi, a North Korea expert at Keio University in Tokyo.
"There are many cross-border incidents, but usually they turn around
after being warned."</TE>
<TE>   Even if the exchange of fire was set off by the spontaneous
response of a panicked crew, the clash could have far-reaching
effects. On Thursday at the United Nations, a U.S. State Department
official had proposed to North Korean diplomats that a senior U.S.
official visit Pyongyang in the second week of July to restart
stalled talks. Now, those will probably be delayed or perhaps put off
indefinitely, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to lower Washington's opinion of North Korea," said
Ralph A. Cossa, executive director of the Honolulu-based Pacific
Forum Center for Strategic and International Studies. "But this will
certainly feed those folks who are against any kind of engagement."</TE>
<TE>   In the South Korean political sphere, the skirmish will almost
certainly help the opposition Grand National Party in a presidential
election year and hurt the government, which has favored
reconciliation with its mercurial northern neighbor under the
so-called sunshine policy.</TE>
<TE>   "The opposition will immediately exploit this and charge that the
government's sunshine policy has failed," said Paik Hak Soon, a North
Korea specialist with the government-funded Sejong Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the GNP said in a statement Saturday that the
confrontation "throws cold water over warming ties."</TE>
<TE>   For South Korean President Kim Dae Jung, who is mired in scandal
and has just six months left in office, the deadliest North-South
confrontation in three years could further tarnish his legacy and his
Nobel Peace Prize-winning policy of accommodation. It could also
strain his relations with Washington should he attempt to defend the
North's actions.</TE>
<TE>   Observers who assumed that the shooting was intentional offered
several theories Saturday for its rationale and timing. Some, like
Okonogi, believe that the dictatorship in the North is extremely
jealous of the prestige and global attention South Korea has received
in recent weeks from co-sponsoring the World Cup soccer championship
tournament and wanted to interject a disruptive note. This does not
seem to jibe, though, with Pyongyang's decision last Sunday to
broadcast on state television South Korea's victory over Italy five
days earlier, accompanied by a generally supportive narrative.</TE>
<TE>   Another possible explanation is that the North Korean military
wanted to flex some muscle before the government enters any talks
with the United States. But if that were the case, it ran the risk of
cutting off all communication with already distrustful conservative
governments in Washington and Tokyo. And the result could help elect
a similarly minded conservative administration in Seoul before year's
end.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, some, like Korea University assistant professor Yoo Ho
Yeol, saw the incident as evidence of infighting in the North.</TE>
<TE>   "I think North Korea intended to shoot this time. The question is
who decided," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hard-liners in the North Korean military staged the confrontation,
Yoo speculated, hoping to derail U.S.-North Korean talks. They fear
that their power could be undermined if Pyongyang makes concessions
to the U.S., he said.</TE>

<DL>MERIDA, Mexico</DL>
<LD>Mexican and Central American leaders ended a two-day summit by
announcing an ambitious plan to integrate the region, including a
$3-billion highway project.</LD>
<LD>   The goal of the so-called Plan Puebla Panama is to promote the
region's development by integrating its roads, electricity grids and
tariff systems, as well as building a Mexico-Panama gas pipeline. In
the meeting that ended Friday in Merida, 620 miles east of Mexico
City, the region's leaders also condemned terrorism and pledged to
improve the defense of human rights.</LD>
<LD>   Central American countries intend to open a joint office in
Mexico's Veracruz state to protect migrant rights, delegates said.
Thousands of Central Americans travel through Mexico on their way to
the U.S., and many report being robbed or mistreated in Mexico.
Mexican President Vicente Fox said regional integration "is an
imperative need."</LD>

<HD>Pakistan Puts 11 Men on Wanted List in Killings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Pakistan issued a "most wanted" list of 11 suspected Islamic
militants Saturday and offered rewards for their capture in
connection with the killing of U.S. reporter Daniel Pearl and the
bombing of Western targets.</LD>
<LD>   Police published photos of the 11 men, along with notices of
rewards totaling about $330,000, in newspapers.</LD>
<LD>   Several of the suspects were named as members of the banned
Lashkar-e-Jhangvi group, a Sunni Muslim movement that police have
previously associated with killings of minority Shiite Muslim
Pakistanis.</LD>
<TE>   Topping the list was Asif Ramzi, a former leader of the group
named as a suspect in the murder of Pearl, a reporter for the Wall
Street Journal who was kidnapped in this southern port city in
January and subsequently killed.</TE>
<TE>   The list also named suspects for the first time in a bombing
outside the U.S. Consulate in Karachi that killed 12 Pakistanis on
June 14 and in the car bombing in the city on May 8 that killed 11
French engineers, two Pakistanis and the bomber.</TE>
<TE>   A man identified as Sharib was named as a suspect in both
bombings. A second man, named as Naveedul Hassan, was listed in
connection with the attack on the U.S. Consulate.</TE>
<TE>   Others whose photographs appeared included three unnamed
associates of Ramzi, two unidentified Lashkar-e-Jhangvi activists and
a man named as Abdul Rehman Sindhi.</TE>
<TE>   Sindhi was named as an associate of Saud Memon, a fugitive who
police say owns the land on the outskirts of Karachi where a body was
found that investigators believe may be Pearl.</TE>
<TE>   Four men are on trial in Pakistan for the abduction and murder of
Pearl, including the alleged mastermind, Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh.</TE>

<KH>DISPATCH FROM PARK RYNIE</KH>
<HD>Fishing Frenzy Spreads During South Africa's Sardine Run</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARK RYNIE, South Africa</DL>
<LD>Barefoot and dressed in an enveloping black burka, Fatima Dawood
wades excitedly into the shallow waters of the Indian Ocean. She
crouches and snatches at the silvery surf, hoping to grasp a few of
the slippery fish twirling in the sand below.</LD>
<LD>   Her strategy pays off. She is soon fumbling with a handful of
agitated sardines.</LD>
<LD>   "It's very exciting," says Dawood, 50, whose husband and two young
grandsons joined her one recent morning to snap up scores of the
small fish on a beach near Park Rynie, about 50 miles south of
Durban. "We clean them, put some spices on them and freeze them. As
we want them, we fry them and eat them."</LD>
<TE>   The Dawoods are among thousands of residents and tourists along
South Africa's eastern coast who catch "sardine fever" every year
when millions of the small fish make their way north to cooler,
inshore waters, unintentionally beaching at junctures along the way.</TE>
<TE>   This natural phenomenon takes place between late May and the end
of July every year on the same stretch of coastline along the
country's KwaZulu-Natal province. Marine biologists are at a loss to
explain exactly why it happens here, and why at this particular time.</TE>
<TE>   It simply has happened for as long as anyone here can remember.</TE>
<TE>   When the sardines are running, some locals come armed with
buckets. Others carry thin plastic supermarket bags. When the frenzy
reaches fever pitch, even an outstretched wet skirt or T-shirt will
do to haul the sardines onto dry land.</TE>
<TE>   "When you get the big crowds, then it's bedlam," said pensioner
Ken Pickersgill, who fishes for a hobby and uses the sardines he
catches as bait to snag larger fish. "Everybody's out here, and
everyone is helping each other. It's just great fun."</TE>
<TE>   The event has become so popular in recent years, it has been
dubbed the great "Sardine Run," and provincial tourism officials are
hoping to capitalize on the natural marine show as a major tourist
attraction.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a phenomenon that happens nowhere else in the world," said
Val Korb, manager for Hibiscus Coast Tourism's office in Margate,
south of here, which attracts tons of the pilchards every year. "It's
really something you have to see. We are trying to promote the
sardines and get people to come down here."</TE>
<TE>   Flea markets, beach competitions and a small carnival have become
part of the annual festivities for the arrival of the sardines.</TE>
<TE>   The fish migrate about 1,000 miles northeast from their spawning
ground in the Agulhas Bank, a section of continental shelf at the
country's southern tip, riding the currents to the waters off Durban,
marine specialists explain. They say this year's exodus of sardines
is the biggest in recent memory.</TE>
<TE>   As the sardines move in shoals sometimes 6 miles long and 50 yards
wide, huge schools of marauding predators, including bottlenose
dolphins, copper sharks and Cape fur seals, follow by the thousands.
As the sardines are driven to the surface, gannets and other gulls
plunge from the sky to pillage the easy prey.</TE>
<TE>   The movement of the sardines, which are about 8 inches long, also
coincides with the migration of humpback whales in this region.</TE>
<TE>   "It's quite a marine spectacle to behold," said Mike
Anderson-Reade, a senior official with the Natal Sharks Board.</TE>
<TE>   The closer the predators get to the fish, the faster the frantic
sardines move, typically ending up right on the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Their arrival triggers a fishing frenzy as commercial fishermen,
who have to get a special license, rush to net them. Divers,
beachgoers and others grab at the hundreds of sardines that escape.</TE>
<TE>   "We're having a bumper season this year," said fisherman Bobby
Naidoo, who has been netting sardines for nine years. "There's a
continuous flow of fish. It's incredible."</TE>
<TE>   In previous years, Naidoo could sell a 65-pound crate of sardines
for around $15. But the abundance of fish and an increase in the
number of commercial fishermen netting sardines has pushed the price
down to about $3 a crate.</TE>
<TE>   "The market is just flooded these days," said Naidoo.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever bystanders manage to catch from the spillage of the
fishermen's nets is theirs to keep. Some rely on the sardines as a
source of food.</TE>
<TE>   "We fry them and put them in curry," Elvis Moodley, 38, said as he
strolled from the beach clutching a plastic bag brimming with
sardines. "I'm collecting for my family and my neighbors, those who
cannot come down here."</TE>
<TE>   Veteran "sardine runners" have already started making plans for
next year's pilgrimage.</TE>
<TE>   "This only comes once a year, and it's such excitement," said
Sonny Pillay, a Pentecostal pastor on the prowl for sardine bait one
recent morning. "You just have to come for the fun."</TE>

<HD>Paternity Test a Must for Peru's President</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TRUJILLO, Peru</DL>
<LD>A judge has ordered Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo to undergo a
DNA test on Aug. 7 to settle a paternity dispute involving a
14-year-old girl, in the latest in a series of embarrassments and
setbacks that have plunged the reformist leader's popularity to
perilously low levels.</LD>
<LD>   Toledo, who took office last July, faces crises of confidence on
several fronts. Winner of a special election that overturned a
previous vote allegedly rigged by disgraced former President Alberto
Fujimori, he is trying to manage a faltering economy and tighten a
loosening grip on the reins of power.</LD>
<LD>   In a vivid sign of Toledo's weakness, several hundred rice farmers
paralyzed the region around the northern city of Tumbes on Thursday
and Friday by blockading traffic on the Pan-American Highway, Peru's
principal north-south corridor. Buses, trucks and cars were backed up
for miles in both directions.</LD>
<TE>   The blockade took place near one of Peru's most heavily fortified
military bases. But the president didn't forcibly disperse the
protesters for fear of causing more violence, observers said.</TE>
<TE>   The demonstration was only the latest of several such
confrontations in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, one person was killed in rioting in the southern town
of Arequipa after Toledo reversed a campaign promise not to privatize
the local electricity utility. Violence erupted after the government
unilaterally announced that it was going ahead with a sale of that
utility and one other to the Belgian concern Tractebel for $167
million.</TE>
<TE>   A 30-day state of emergency was declared, and 1,700 soldiers and
police were brought in to quell the disturbance.</TE>
<TE>   The utility sale has been put on hold pending a court decision,
but eight journalists who covered the disorder have been charged with
"inciting terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Privatization of state-owned utilities and other companies in
Latin America has proved increasingly unpopular in several nations,
where waves of layoffs and higher service prices have resulted. But
opposition has been especially militant in Peru, with demonstrators
fighting privatization of ports, forests and power firms.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo's government needs the cash from privatizations to help
make up for a significant projected budget deficit.</TE>
<TE>   A recent poll by the weekly newsmagazine Caretas showed that
Toledo's approval rating has slid to 16%, down from 60% a year ago.
More than 82% of those polled disapproved of the way Toledo is
handling his job. There have been increasing calls for him to
reshuffle his Cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   The DNA ruling Friday by Family Court Judge Carmen Kcomt in the
northern coastal city of Piura threatens to cripple Toledo's
presidency even more if the tests prove positive, further damaging
his credibility. In a long-running legal battle, Toledo has denied
that the girl, named Zarai, is his daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Luis Solari, a member of Congress and a Toledo ally, said: "The
president will go along with all mandates of the judiciary. But let's
not politicize the Zarai case."</TE>
<TE>   The girl's mother, Lucrecia Orozco, has said that Toledo fathered
the child during a liaison they had when he was a business school
professor and already married. She has persisted in the case although
a family court several years ago found in Toledo's favor. That ruling
came despite a blood test Toledo took that indicated a 97%
probability that he was the girl's father.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo's lawyers say they will appeal Friday's ruling to the
Supreme Court, claiming that the paternity claim is politically
motivated. The legal battle became an issue in the late stages of
last June's election, which Toledo won against ex-President Alan
Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   The well-spoken Zarai uses Toledo as her last name and has built a
public following. Toledo did not comment on the ruling.</TE>

<HD>Japanese Fleet Embarks on Hunt for Endangered Whales</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>A fleet of Japanese whalers set out Saturday for a three-month hunt
in the northwest Pacific where they will kill endangered sei whales
for the first time in more than 25 years.</LD>
<LD>   The five vessels plan to catch 260 whales--150 minke, 50 Bryde's,
50 sei and 10 sperm whales, the Fisheries Agency said.</LD>
<LD>   Sei whales have not been taken since their near-extinction led
nations to halt commercial hunts of the species 26 years ago.</LD>
<TE>   The International Whaling Commission banned commercial whaling in
1986, but it allows Japan a limited catch under a scientific research
program. Japan said it added the sei whale to this year's hunt after
data showed the population had risen to 28,000.</TE>
<TE>   Japan says its research program, begun in 1987, is necessary to
chart whales' migration patterns, population trends and diet.
Opponents say Japan's research is commercial whaling in disguise
because the meat is sold to wholesalers.</TE>

<HD>Scandals May Delay Recovery</HD>
<DH>Economy: Consistent growth hasn't buoyed markets. Now
analysts fear corporate misdeeds may sap consumers' will to keep
spending.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Until a few months ago, economists thought America had come up with a
surprising invention: the "no-slow" recession, in which growth barely
pauses before resuming its upward arc.</LD>
<LD>   But with business scandals spreading, stocks still sliding and the
dollar dropping, the stage seems set for a distinctly less pleasant
surprise: the no-growth recovery.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts fear that the latest troubles are sapping the power of
the tax cuts and reduced interest rates that, by inducing consumers
to continue buying, fueled most of the economy's recent comeback.</LD>
<TE>   "You can't have corporate America coming out every day and
announcing its financial numbers are no good and there'll have to be
more layoffs, and expect consumers to keep on buying," said James W.
Paulsen, chief investment officer at San Francisco-based Wells
Capital Management.</TE>
<TE>   In essence, what was supposed to be the nation's mildest recession
is lingering because major parts of the economic system are clashing.
Like a hapless bar band, the U.S. economy and stock market can't seem
to play the same tune. Major corporations keep bellowing bad news,
fueling a crisis of confidence. Foreign investors dash for the door,
toppling the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   The cacophony threatens to drown out the one comforting note: the
strong growth rate of the gross domestic product, the chief gauge of
the nation's output of goods and services. In most recessions, the
GDP shrinks for at least two consecutive quarters. This time, it has
risen almost every quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Commerce Department said last week that output grew at a 6.1%
annual pace during the first three months of the year. That was
better than in all but four of 40 quarters of the 1990s boom. It grew
at a less impressive but still positive 1.65% rate during the three
months before that. The only time it hasn't grown during the last
decade was last summer, and then it shrank by a mere one-third of a
percentage point.</TE>
<TE>   Optimists argue that these figures show the economy is moving
stubbornly forward and will eventually recover its full flush. "I
believe the recovery's vitality and staying power are solid,"
declared Morgan Stanley economist Richard B. Berner.</TE>
<TE>   But others see triple trouble in the growth. First, it is almost
entirely the product of consumers hunting for low-interest bargains
such as cheap mortgages, rather than businesses investing in plants
and equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Secondly, because so much growth is concentrated in housing, there
is a danger of a price "bubble" similar to the one that occurred in
the stock market.</TE>
<TE>   Although Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, among others,
has dismissed the risk, arguing that people don't trade houses the
way they do shares, there are some ominous parallels.</TE>
<TE>   Figures out last week show housing sales growing faster than
population and, in many places, faster than people's income. At the
current fever pitch, a record 1 million homes will go up this year.
Among the markets some analysts think are most in danger of a price
bust is Southern California's.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there are some signs that consumers, whose spending
accounts for two-thirds of the economy, may be growing cautious. Auto
and retail sales dropped in May, reversing increases. Figures out
last week showed that, overall, personal consumption expenditures
declined in May for the first time in six months.</TE>
<TE>   "The consumer is downshifting, and that will have an impact on the
economy," said Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Decision
Economics in New York.</TE>
<TE>   What may speed consumers' caution is the fear that businesses have
played fast and loose with their financial books and the truth.
Analysts had spent most of the seven months since Enron Corp.'s early
December collapse marveling at how little effect the scandals roiling
the corporate sector seemed to have on the country and economy. By
the end of last week, they were beginning to worry about how big the
toll might be.</TE>
<TE>   What caused the shift was the disclosure that WorldCom Inc., the
country's second-largest long-distance phone company, had hidden $3.9
billion in expenses and that Xerox Corp., the world's largest copier
maker, had misreported $6.4 billion in sales, resulting in a
restatement of $1.9 billion. That would make each company's profits
look that much larger than they really were.</TE>
<TE>   The immediate effect in Washington was to jump-start legislative
and regulatory changes that had been foundering. The Securities and
Exchange Commission sped up plans to make top executives of large
companies potentially personally liable for the accuracy of their
firms' financial statements. Congress appeared more likely to approve
creation of the first new regulatory board in years to ride herd on
the accounting industry.</TE>
<TE>   But the effects of the new disclosures are likely to go well
beyond such specifics.</TE>
<TE>   Economically, the disclosures could help delay the recovery by
pulling down already depressed stock prices and by leaving already
shellshocked executives even less willing to take risks.</TE>
<TE>   "We may be seeing executives and accountants going from one end of
the spectrum to the other," economist David Hale said, "from being
hyper-negligent--perhaps even criminal--to being hyper-cautious."
Either extreme hurts growth, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Of all the sores that the latest scandals could have inflamed, the
stock market might have, in some sense, seemed the least likely.
After all, investors already had weathered almost two years of
setbacks before the Enron collapse, so they might have been expected
to be numb to news of new trouble.</TE>
<TE>   But as Friday's close to the first half of the business year
demonstrated, they were hardly that. Investors pushed stock prices to
their steepest first-half declines in more than three decades. If the
bellwether Dow Jones industrial average does not lose a single
additional point between now and New Year's Day, it will still have
posted its worst record in more than 70 years--down three years
running.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't seen three consecutive negative years since the Great
Depression," Hale said.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that sustained declines occurred in the face of
statistics showing the economy doing better than expected suggests it
is not just growth worries that caused the price tumbles; it is also
the scandals. The reason is that they threaten to destroy investors'
last hope of recovering part of what they have lost.</TE>
<TE>   Until the scandals, the only explanation for what had gone wrong
was that the nation had experienced the biggest stock market bubble
in its history. Or, what amounts to the same thing, that what people
were willing to pay for a dollar of future corporate earnings had
reached an all-time high.</TE>
<TE>   Once the bubble burst, investors lost their chance to profit from
the price run-up. But there were still the earnings. Or at least
there were, until some companies began admitting that much of their
earnings was fake.</TE>
<TE>   "The old answer to what went wrong is that there was a bubble,"
said Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless. "The new one is
that even the part you thought was real turns out not to be."</TE>
<TE>   If the bear market of the last 2 1/2 years disturbs U.S.
investors, it absolutely panics many foreigners, who started to pump
funds into U.S. stocks and bonds in earnest in the mid-1990s and were
making more than half a trillion dollars a year in investments here
by 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But most foreign investors did little about the problem until
recently, in large measure because the U.S. dollar was continuing to
rise in value against their home currencies, partially offsetting
their dwindling U.S. gains.</TE>
<TE>   However, when the dollar reversed course and began slipping in
February, so did foreign investment in U.S. stocks.</TE>
<TE>   "The correlation between the weak dollar and the weak stock market
has got to be a little unnerving to the people at the Federal Reserve
and the Treasury," said Gary C. Hufbauer, an economist at the
Institute for International Economics in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   So unnerving, it appears, that the Fed took the unusual step
Friday of joining other central banks in a coordinated effort to sell
yen. Although the effort was designed to stem a rise in the Japanese
currency's value that is threatening that country's fragile,
export-driven recovery, its effect, and perhaps its aim as well, was
to slow the dollar's fall.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just not credible we're doing this only for them," Hufbauer
said. Washington wants to keep the dollar from slipping so quickly
that foreigners, rushing to get out of their U.S. investments, don't
send the stock and bond market into dives that damage America's shaky
comeback.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, there is no way to know how many more companies will
admit improper accounting. No investor yet has a grip on how much
further the stock market has to fall. And no policymaker has the
tools that Washington once had to keep the economy from falling into
crisis. In the absence of all three, the nation is careening toward a
future that will largely be of its own making.</TE>
<TE>   "A year ago, a lot of what happened to the economy was in our
control," said Mark Zandi, chief economist of West Chester, Pa.-based
Economy.com. "We could cut taxes or reduce interest rates to keep
growth going.</TE>
<TE>   "But now we're going to have to rely on luck as much as our own
doing to avoid a disappointing recovery."</TE>
<TE>   Or worse.</TE>

<HD>City Employees Eligible to Donate in Secession Fight</HD>
<DH>Ruling: Ethics panel says workers should get leeway because
jobs could be affected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles city employees can be solicited for donations in the
fight over the proposed secession of Hollywood and the San Fernando
Valley, according to a new ruling by the city Ethics Commission.</LD>
<LD>   The decision, expected to be made public this week, is an
exception to a state law that bars the raising of funds from city
employees for local ballot-measure campaigns. Ethics officials said
city employees should be allowed greater leeway in the secession
contests, because the measures could affect their work conditions,
pay and retirement, among other things.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling helps secession opponents, who see the city work force
as a natural source of votes and money to defeat the break-away
movements.</LD>
<TE>   Advocates of the split say the decision will let Mayor James K.
Hahn and the rest of City Hall overstep local limits on the use of
public time and resources in a political campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling still prohibits use of city resources by city officials
and employees to promote or oppose the ballot measures. And city
employees cannot be approached for campaign contributions during
their work hours or while in city offices.</TE>
<TE>   The participation of city workers is just one aspect of City
Hall's growing focus on combating secession, which will be on the
ballot citywide Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn also is turning to city commissioners--who include business
and community leaders, attorneys and activists, among others--as a
bulwark in his effort to thwart the city's breakup.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said he is convinced that commissioners and others in
City Hall can be great assets to his campaign to keep the city
together. Hahn has appointed 212 of the 315 commissioners in his
first year in office. These positions typically are considered a
valuable tool for the mayor in moving his agenda through city
departments. Commissioners are mostly volunteers who oversee
departments.</TE>
<TE>   "They can be a real important communication network themselves,"
Hahn said. "They have their own networks of people they'll be talking
to, constituent groups."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor used a reception last week at the Museum of Contemporary
Art to pitch arguments to commissioners on secession. In their goodie
bags? Perfume--and a list of "talking points" on secession.</TE>
<TE>   Secession advocates criticize the mayor for promoting his
political agenda with city officials and employees.</TE>
<TE>   "What you're seeing, I think, is really the coalescing of every
aspect of City Hall government and the downtown private sector
conspiring to use whatever tools they have to fight this," said
Richard Katz, head of a campaign committee promoting secession in the
Valley. "It's one thing to be straight up and factual, but the city's
never been straight up and factual."</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Katz said, he believes that public money should not
be used for the "talking points" distributed to city officials.</TE>
<TE>   In the two-page, 12-point document to city commissioners, the
mayor said new cities in the Valley or Hollywood would result in
higher taxes, reduced services and few, if any, emergency reserves.</TE>
<TE>   "Working together is the best way to ensure improved quality of
life for every resident of Los Angeles," the document says.
"Secession leaves every neighborhood and community wounded."</TE>
<TE>   Further, the document says: "In the event of a catastrophic
emergency like the Northridge earthquake or a terrorist attack, the
new cities will go broke immediately."</TE>
<TE>   It also says new Valley and Hollywood cities would require
increased water and electricity rates.</TE>
<TE>   Another document distributed to the city's 35 general managers and
to members of the mayor's staff paints a gloomy portrait of life in
the new cities. On the question of whether secession would result in
the loss of jobs for current city employees, for example, the answer
is: "Yes ... the new city would be able to cut the pay and benefits
of its employees and may be forced to do so due to lack of
resources."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn defended the documents by saying he believed that city
officials needed "to know the facts about secession--not so they're
engaged in persuasion but so they can give the facts."</TE>
<TE>   Several commissioners and other city officials, appointed to their
jobs by the mayor, said that they had not taken offense at the
mayor's anti-secession pitches and that they know he is single-minded
on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "We all know that this is his No. 1 priority," said Ronald Stone,
a member of the Board of Neighborhood Commissioners. "Certainly there
was no pressure, but I think he saw it as an opportunity to get the
message to the commissioners."</TE>
<TE>   Added Silvia Saucedo, an attorney and police commissioner: "The
hot issue of discussion is secession.... Being part of [Hahn's ]
cabinet is to talk about the major issues, and secession is the major
issue."</TE>
<TE>   Several commissioners said their positions on secession had been
formed independently, regardless of the mayor's view on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Grodin, a fire commissioner who attended a fund-raiser for the
mayor's group last week, said his opposition to secession has nothing
to do with the mayor's position. "I've given money to fight it,"
Grodin said. "I would have, whether I'm a commissioner or not."</TE>
<TE>   Not all the city's commissioners agree with the mayor. David
Fleming, for example, resigned recently from the Ethics Commission to
promote Valley cityhood. Under ethics rules, he could not serve on
that panel while donating money and campaigning for secession.</TE>

<HD>Town Gears Up for Biker Rally</HD>
<DH>Event: Some worry that two clubs' lethal rivalry will spawn
violence. But others optimistically welcome the visitors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONE TEMPEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOLLISTER, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Ever since a deadly Nevada casino shootout between rival motorcycle
gangs in late April, a high-noon atmosphere has been building in this
Central California farm town where the two gangs are expected on the
Fourth of July.</LD>
<LD>   Questions have surfaced that seem incongruous in these bucolic
surroundings. Will the Mongols invade? Will the Angels retaliate?
What will it mean for the lucrative Hollister Methodist Church
pancake breakfast?</LD>
<LD>   "I'm worried that the potential for trouble is high," said San
Benito County Sheriff-Coroner Curtis Hill.</LD>
<TE>   Some here see the sheriff as a brave sentinel and others as a wet
blanket tossed on this town's biggest party.</TE>
<TE>   Since it started five years ago, the Fourth of July weekend
Hollister Independence Rally has annually attracted thousands of
motorcycle club members--packs of leather-clad men and women astride
growling Harleys. Most are harmless weekend enthusiasts. But a few
are the self-proclaimed "one-percenters" from criminally linked
outlaw motorcycle clubs.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the town's historic role in inspiring the famous Marlon
Brando biker movie "The Wild One," the three-day rally has become a
huge production, doubling San Benito County's 56,000 population.
Stalwart civic groups such as the Rotary Club and the Methodist
church enthusiastically pitch in, using biker largess to fund Little
League teams and old-age programs.</TE>
<TE>   But in light of the April 27 shootout between Mongols and Hells
Angels motorcycle bands in Laughlin, Nev., people here are wondering
if tiny Hollister has made a pact with the devil. In nearby Ventura
County, after all, two biker meets were recently canceled.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes me a little edgy that nobody in the community was asked
if we wanted to give up our town for three or four days," said Rick
Jennings, a retired San Jose firefighter who lives here. "Meanwhile,
the Laughlin episode tells us that something like that could happen
here."</TE>
<TE>   It is one thing, said Jennings and others, to have their town
invaded by hordes of middle-aged weekend bikers--Mild Ones--with
bulging pockets.</TE>
<TE>   It would be another matter entirely, they said, if a new
generation intent on revenge arrived, packing automatic weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Three men--two Mongols and a Hells Angel--died in the April
shootout at Harrah's Casino. Another Hells Angel was gunned down on
the highway leaving town. Sixteen people were injured in the casino
melee.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, biker events have been held in Northern California and
Nevada without serious incidents.</TE>
<TE>   No Mongols were among the 7,000 leather-garbed participants at the
June 7-9 Redwood Run Motorcycle Rally outside Garberville, north of
San Francisco. Violence was also avoided in Elko, Nev., after city
officials in that traditionally firearm-friendly community took the
unprecedented step of banning weapons in the downtown area for the
June 21-23 motorcycle jamboree, attended by 5,000 bikers.</TE>
<TE>   However, Elko Police Chief Clair Morris reported one tense scene
in which 50 uniformed officers surrounded three dozen bikers involved
in a bar fight after a performance by a band named 38 Special.</TE>
<TE>   In Phoenix, police are investigating possible gang connections to
the June 11 slaying of a Hells Angels member, wearing his club
regalia, from Ventura County outside a local bar. "It could be
fallout," Phoenix Police Sgt. Lauri Williams told reporters who asked
about the possible Laughlin connection.</TE>
<TE>   Hollister rally organizers seem fairly confident that the Laughlin
episode will not be repeated here.</TE>
<TE>   "We are right on schedule," said rally committee staffer Ellen
Brown. She said three Hells Angels chapters plan to operate booths at
the rally, selling biker paraphernalia.</TE>
<TE>   But law enforcement officials are anxious about reports that
Mongols plan to crash the Hells Angels-dominated party.</TE>
<TE>   With tensions building between the two motorcycle clubs, the
potential for a showdown is such that Sheriff Hill said more than 100
state and federal outlaw-motorcycle-gang specialists, twice the
normal number for the event, are planning to attend as observers.</TE>
<TE>   He said he has added more surveillance cameras to the main
intersections. The Police Department also brings in 40 officers from
nearby law enforcement agencies just for the event.</TE>
<TE>   The Hollister City Council enacted crowd-control measures,
including one prohibiting the display of female breasts (except those
belonging to nursing mothers). The council also banned glass
containers (except for baby bottles) in the four-block downtown area
reserved for the rally.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Mongols' and Hells Angels' Web site chat rooms are
full of messages inciting the two groups to continue their open
warfare.</TE>
<TE>   The friction surfaced about two years ago when the upstart Mongol
group, whose "patron saint" is the 12th century warrior Genghis Khan,
began opening chapters in traditional Hells Angels territory,
including Oakland and Hollister.</TE>
<TE>   "Never forget those who died for the Mongol Nation," wrote one
supporter from San Jose. "Remember, brotherhood is forever. Never let
anyone take your kindness for weakness." Such talk has local lawmen
concerned.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to wonder when the next shoe is going to fall," said
Hollister Police Capt. Bob Brooks, an 18-year veteran. "I think we
are fooling ourselves to think that they took care of things in
Laughlin. Something will happen in the future. Will it be in
Hollister?"</TE>
<TE>   Rally organizers say the authorities are being alarmists.</TE>
<TE>   "We have more trouble at our local rodeo parade," said
Independence Rally Committee marketing director Mark Maxwell, who
helped found the event in 1997. "More fights, more drunken incidents.
More general problems."</TE>
<TE>   Tooling into town on bikes that cost up to $25,000 each, the
visitors, Maxwell estimated, spend an average of $350 on food and
lodging during their stay, producing $5 million to $8 million in
income for the local tax rolls, which amounts to about $200,000 in
tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Maxwell contends that the visiting bikers have too much invested,
too much respect for the town and too many miles on their personal
odometers to make any trouble here.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a whole different phenomenon here," he said. "These
people are just buying an image as little outlaws for the weekend."</TE>
<TE>   The outlaw image has been much cultivated since the first
Independence Rally in 1997, which was held on the 50th anniversary of
what has become known as the Hollister Incident.</TE>
<TE>   In the years just after World War II, California became a magnet
for weekend motorcycling, popular with returning servicemen, many of
whom had learned to ride bikes in the military. The July 4, 1947, a
motorcycle race outside Hollister was attended by 4,000 people,
including members of a badly behaved motorcycle club called the
Boozefighters.</TE>
<TE>   At the 1947 races, a few Boozefighters, true to their name, got
very drunk, jumped the curb and rode their motorcycles into Johnny's
Bar on Hollister's main drag. One Boozefighter was arrested for
attempting to pour alcohol into a bus radiator.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, it was about "partying and playing. There wasn't a riot,
nobody got raped in the streets and nobody burned the town down," one
Boozefighter veteran recalled on the club's Web site.</TE>
<TE>   The 1947 revelry was captured in a famously staged Life magazine
photograph showing a loutish male rider swilling beer from a bottle
on a parked Harley roadster, a sea of empties around his front wheel.
The picture inspired a fictional Harper's magazine short story by
Frank Rooney. The short story, in turn, inspired the classic 1953
film "The Wild One," starring Brando.</TE>
<TE>   Evocative of the contemporary rivalry between the Mongols and the
Hells Angels, the movie depicted a split between two motorcycle
gangs, the Black Rebels Motorcycle Club headed by the Brando
character, Johnny, and the Beetles led by Chino, a loathsome
character played by Lee Marvin.</TE>
<TE>   The film carried a disclaimer that would be endorsed
enthusiastically by some Hollister residents: "This is a shocking
story that could never take place in most American towns--but it did
in this one. It is a public challenge not to let it happen again."</TE>
<TE>   Thus the "outlaw" biker image was born, earning Hollister the
right--nearly half a century later--to dub itself the "Birthplace of
the American Biker." Maxwell said he expects 80,000 people to attend
this year's rally. Cherise Tyson, owner of Johnny's Bar, the
unofficial center of the biker rally, said she has to hire 32
additional employees, including seven bouncers, to handle the huge
crowds of bikers.</TE>
<TE>   "Over a five- to six-day period, I do three months' worth of
business," said Tyson, who describes her clientele as "the nicest
people you'll ever meet and the biggest tippers in the world."
Another enthusiastic rally supporter is the Rev. Ardyss Golden,
pastor of the Methodist church. Since the first rally in 1997, the
church has hosted a $6 all-you-can-eat pancake breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   Golden said that last year the church "cleared about $7,000 in
three days" from the breakfast, by far its biggest source of money
for charity projects.</TE>
<TE>   A gentle Nebraska native, the minister also participates in the
annual blessing of the bikes at the local Catholic church. She said
some Hells Angels even attend religious services. As for the events
in Laughlin and their potential violent spillover into Hollister,
Golden said she is not concerned. "We are a church," she said. "We
would welcome even the Mongols if they came. God's love is also for
the bad guys."</TE>

<HD>Citizen's Arrest Closes Down Hike to Honor Victims of Mine
Tragedy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A memorial hike to the entrance of the Blue Light Mine on Saturday by
21 friends and the stepfather of the two brothers who died in the
mine a week ago was interrupted by a resident of Silverado Canyon who
placed them all under a citizen's arrest for trespassing.</LD>
<LD>   Two photojournalists, including Times photographer Al Schaben,
were among those arrested.</LD>
<LD>   The noon pilgrimage to the mine was led by Matt Murphy, 17, who
had been with 23-year-old Nicholas Anderson and his brother, Glenn,
18, but decided against following the brothers when they began to
explore the mine.</LD>
<TE>   Sheriff's Lt. Greg Russell said the resident who made the arrests
apparently had heard about a candlelight vigil at the mine in memory
of the brothers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm speculating that they were worried about the fire hazard,"
Russell said, noting the wildfires that are now burning throughout
the West, and the danger posed by methane gas seeping from the mine
shaft.</TE>
<TE>   The resident who made the arrest declined to identify himself, but
said he was acting on behalf of the owners of a home on the private
road leading to the mine.</TE>
<TE>   The group had ignored the man's protest and walked around a
barrier with no-trespassing signs. At the mine's entrance, they said
a prayer and tossed a few of the brothers' belongings into the shaft.</TE>
<TE>   A sheriff's helicopter landed nearby while the group was at the
mine and deputies ordered everyone to leave. After making their way
back down the road, they were greeted by Sheriff's Deputy Gerry
Stenger.</TE>
<TE>   Stenger said the resident wanted to place them under citizen's
arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Stenger took everyone's name, released them on their own
recognizance, and said he will pass the information to the district
attorney's office, which will decide whether to press charges.</TE>

<LD>Operations at the Port of Long Beach resumed Saturday after a bomb
scare the previous day.</LD>
<LD>   The port, a major component of the largest harbor complex in the
nation, shut down about 4:30 p.m. Friday, after a suspicious device
was found inside a car. The sheriff's bomb squad later determined
that the device was harmless.</LD>
<LD>   "It was some sort of rigged-up device to discourage any kind of
thievery of this car," said Fausto Capobianco, a port spokesman.
"Everything is fine this morning."</LD>

<HD>Bus Security Measure Defeated</HD>
<DH>Assembly: Democrats on transportation panel abstain from
voting on bill opposed by union.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Assembly Democrats last week scuttled legislation that sought to
prevent violent felons from continuing to drive school buses--a
measure strongly opposed by a school employees union.</LD>
<LD>   Applicants for bus driver positions are rigorously screened for
prior felony convictions under a law passed in response to the 1997
murder of a Sacramento-area student by a janitor who was on probation
for manslaughter.</LD>
<LD>   But bus drivers already on the job were not covered under the 1997
law as part of a concession to organized labor. Consequently, they
can renew their permits and continue to work for schools without
undergoing more thorough criminal checks.</LD>
<TE>   Legislation by state Sen. Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside) that would
have required the Department of Motor Vehicles to revoke the school
bus permit of anyone convicted of a violent crime cleared the Senate
last month on a unanimous vote with bipartisan support. But the bill,
SB 1725, died Monday in the Assembly Transportation Committee when
all Democrats on the panel abstained from voting.</TE>
<TE>   "I walked into a buzz saw, to my surprise," Morrow said in an
interview. "Not voting is as good as a no vote, in terms of results."</TE>
<TE>   Leading the charge against the bill was the California School
Employees Assn., which represents bus workers.</TE>
<TE>   David Low, a lobbyist for the group, said the measure would have
penalized workers who for years have been performing their duties
without incident, based on brushes with the law that might have
occurred decades earlier. He cited the example of one bus driver, a
former minister who had been convicted of a felony in the South that
stemmed from involvement in the civil rights movement.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't fire everyone you've ever hired because they stole a
bicycle when they were 18 years old," Low said. "We think the public
is very well protected, and that it is patently unfair to go back in
a person's history forever to deal with something [employers] knew
when they hired them."</TE>
<TE>   Most schools have been conducting thorough background checks on
bus drivers for years and are aware of any criminal records, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In attempting to pass the measure, Morrow was walking a fine line.
A similar bill by former GOP Assemblyman Brett Granlund of Yucaipa
targeting bus drivers convicted of violent felonies was vetoed by
Gov. Gray Davis in 1999. To get the measure through the Legislature,
Granlund had accepted amendments to appease organized labor by
accommodating existing bus drivers. But those same amendments led to
the veto from Davis, who wrote that "I cannot support a bill that
allows any individual who has committed a serious felony ... to be
employed by a school district to drive a school bus."</TE>
<TE>   Morrow said he received a similar warning from Davis
administration officials this year, and thus knew that he could not
get the governor's signature if he yielded to the labor unions.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been here for 10 years, so nothing really surprises me
anymore, but this was an important bill to me," Morrow said. The
grandfathering of felons as bus drivers, he said, is "a big
loophole."</TE>

<HD>Rosemary Clooney, 74; Legendary Singer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rosemary Clooney, the versatile pop singer who soared to fame in the
early 1950s with the novelty tune "Come On-a My House," overcame
prescription-pill addiction and a nervous breakdown in the late '60s
and began a comeback in the late '70s that boosted her stature as one
of the finest pop singers in show business, has died. She was 74.</LD>
<LD>   Clooney, who had undergone surgery for lung cancer in January at
the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., died Saturday night at her home
in Beverly Hills with her family at her bedside.</LD>
<LD>   Known for her warm, velvety voice, Clooney was once described by
Frank Sinatra as "a symbol of modern American music."</LD>
<TE>   But since her comeback, a time in which she recorded a series of
tributes to songwriters such as Harold Arlen, Cole Porter and Duke
Ellington on the Concord Jazz label, she matured into what jazz
critic Don Heckman called "a lot more than a symbol, and a far more
intriguing singer than she was during her 'Come On-a My House' days
in the '50s."</TE>
<TE>   "Clooney's voice," Heckman wrote in 2000, "has been one of the
natural wonders--too often underappreciated--since her pop star days
in the '50s. And her turn toward jazz in recent decades has simply
been a matter of bringing to the surface rhythmic qualities that were
always a subtext in her singing."</TE>
<TE>   A reviewer for the New York Times once wrote of the recent-vintage
Clooney that she was as "mellow as mature wine ... she brings a
naturalness, solidity and unpretentious personal honesty to whatever
she sings."</TE>
<TE>   Or as director Mike Nichols put it: "She sings like Spencer Tracy
acts."</TE>
<TE>   "Her music was an extraordinary extension of this joyful soul,"
her longtime friend, the singer and pianist Michael Feinstein, said
Saturday night. "She was an earth mother, a heart person, and that
quality came through in her music."</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein, who worked with Clooney numerous times over the years,
recalled one engagement at the Hollywood Bowl. They were both
nervous, Feinstein said, and he expected her to give him words of
wisdom, but she turned to him and said, "Don't think this ever gets
any easier."</TE>
<TE>   "And with that, she went on stage."</TE>
<TE>   Clooney was born May 23, 1928, in Maysville, Ky. Her parents
separated frequently and her father, a heavy drinker, was rarely
around. Clooney, along with younger brother Nick--the father of actor
George Clooney--and younger sister Betty, lived with various
relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Clooney began singing at age 3. At 5, she and her 2-year-old
sister were singing together at home and in the car.</TE>
<TE>   Their grandfather, Andrew Clooney, a jeweler who served on the
city council and was a one-term elected mayor of Maysville, featured
the girls as entertainers at his political rallies.</TE>
<TE>   "We would sing on street corners, anywhere we could collect a
crowd," Clooney told The Times in 1988. "Betty had a natural gift for
harmony. Her voice was lower than mine." In 1941, when Rosemary was
13, the family moved to Cincinnati to live with Clooney's maternal
grandparents. Her mother later moved to California to marry a sailor,
taking Nick with her.</TE>
<TE>   In 1945, 16-year-old Rosemary and 13-year-old Betty auditioned for
Cincinnati radio station WLW and were hired to sing duets on a
nightly radio show for $20 a week apiece.</TE>
<TE>   The Clooney Sisters were soon singing with local bands as well,
and in 1946 big band leader Tony Pastor hired them to tour with his
band as featured vocalists. Because of the girls' young ages, their
grandmother sent their uncle on the road with them as chaperon.</TE>
<TE>   Clooney made her first solo record in 1946, "I'm Sorry I Didn't
Say I'm Sorry When I Made You Cry Last Night."</TE>
<TE>   After three years of touring mostly one-night stands, Betty quit
the band and Rosemary remained as a soloist.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1949, Clooney struck out on her own, and in 1950 she signed
a recording contract with Columbia Records. She initially achieved
some success with children's songs such as "Me and My Teddy Bear" and
"Little Johnny Chickadee" and in 1951 scored a minor hit with
"Beautiful Brown Eyes."</TE>
<TE>   But then came the unexpected hit that would make her a household
name.</TE>
<TE>   In June 1951, Columbia's head of artists and repertoire, Mitch
Miller, told Clooney she'd be recording "Come On-a My House," a
quasi-Armenian folk song written by an unlikely duo: author William
Saroyan and Ross Bagdasarian, who, as David Seville, later created
the singing Chipmunks.</TE>
<TE>   Clooney balked at singing--in a fake accent that sounded more
Italian than Armenian--what she considered a "dumb" song with lyrics
that "sounded more like a drunken chant than an historic folk art
form." She also hated the "gimmicky" arrangement: It was orchestrated
for an amplified harpsichord.</TE>
<TE>   When she told Miller she wouldn't do it, she recalled in her 1977
autobiography "This for Remembrance," Miller responded by saying,
"Well, let me put it this way. I will fire you unless you show up
tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   The savvy Miller's instincts proved correct. Within weeks, Clooney
had one of the biggest-selling songs in the country and "Come On-a My
House" went on to sell more than a million copies.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next four years, Clooney amassed a string of hits,
including "Tenderly" (a No. 1 tune that became her theme song), "Half
as Much," "Botch-a-me," "Too Old to Cut The Mustard" (a duet with
Marlene Dietrich), "The Night Before Christmas Song" (with Gene
Autry), "Hey There," "This Ole House," and "Mambo Italiano."</TE>
<TE>   With her recording success, Hollywood naturally came calling.</TE>
<TE>   As Paramount's latest "girl next door," the blond, blue-eyed
Clooney made her motion picture debut in 1953 in "The Stars Are
Singing," a largely forgettable musical. She made five movies in
quick succession, including her most memorable film, "White
Christmas" with Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye, but her film career never
took off.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, as Clooney once joked, "They weren't writing lead roles
for pregnant women."</TE>
<TE>   She had married actor Jose Ferrer, who was 16 years her senior, in
1953. And, beginning in 1955, she gave birth to five children in five
years.</TE>
<TE>   Clooney continued working, however. She hosted "The Rosemary
Clooney Show," a syndicated half-hour show in the 1955-'56 season,
and appeared frequently on television variety shows--guest shots in
which her frequent pregnancies prompted Bob Hope to quip that
"Rosie's favorite game is Vatican Roulette" and Tennessee Ernie Ford
to insist, "You've got to find out what's causing this."</TE>
<TE>   Clooney and Ferrer seemed to have it all: a huge house in Beverly
Hills once owned by George Gershwin (Ira Gershwin remained their
next-door neighbor), a glamorous life and celebrity friends. There
were star-studded parties and dinners, after which frequent guest Nat
"King" Cole would invariably stand up as the table was being cleared
and say, "How about a little music for dessert?"</TE>
<TE>   But Clooney's marriage to Ferrer was troubled from the start and
ended in divorce in 1961. They remarried the same year but divorced
again in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   By 1968, Clooney's relationship with a younger man had ended, and,
fighting depression, she became addicted to sleeping pills and
tranquilizers.</TE>
<TE>   A friend of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's, she was at the Ambassador
Hotel that June when Kennedy was assassinated, triggering what became
a complete mental breakdown.</TE>
<TE>   During an engagement in Reno in July, she was so unstable that she
walked off the stage during a performance and, as she has recounted,
later found herself driving her car on the wrong side of the road on
a two-lane mountain highway, playing a form of Russian roulette with
oncoming cars and saying, "That's one for you, God," as approaching
cars narrowly avoided hitting her.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly thereafter, she was admitted to the psychiatric ward at a
hospital in Los Angeles. Once released, she found herself working
lounges in Holidays Inns in places like Ventura and Hawthorne.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't mind it--the people were still there and it kept me
going," she told the Washington Post in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   In the '70s, as she slowly rebuilt her personal and professional
life, Clooney appeared in a series of commercials for a paper towel
company, which had chosen her as spokeswoman after a survey showed
that consumers trusted her.</TE>
<TE>   In 1976, longtime friend Bing Crosby asked Clooney to join him on
his 50th anniversary tour, but the turning point in her career came a
year later when she signed with the small Concord Jazz label. The
year she turned 50, Concord released what she later referred to as
"the debut album of my new career: 'Everything's Coming Up Rose.' "</TE>
<TE>   Over the next decade, Clooney emerged as what the New York Times
called "an icon of classical pop and jazz," a singer whose name,
according to the Wall Street Journal, came to be "spoken in the same
breath as Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald."</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, a TV movie, "Rosie: The Rosemary Clooney Story," was
released with Sondra Locke portraying her.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, with Clooney now in her 60s, a series of career
highs came her way.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, she made her debut at Carnegie Hall with a tribute to
"Arrangers," and she returned two years later with an equally
acclaimed tribute to Bing Crosby. In 1994, she was nominated for an
Emmy for outstanding guest actress in a drama series for her role as
an Alzheimer's patient given to belting out songs without warning on
NBC's "ER," starring nephew George.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, she achieved her first No. 1 album, "Rosemary Clooney's
White Christmas," which topped the jazz charts for three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the decade, Clooney was frequently nominated for Grammy
awards in the traditional pop category. She also continued to appear
in concert halls and clubs around the country, including an annual
engagement at the preeminent cabaret room, Rainbows and Stars in New
York City.</TE>
<TE>   Although age had compromised some of her vocal ability, she said
it enhanced other aspects. "I've lost some on top, but my lower
register is better, and I think my expression is better," she said in
1997. "I'm now filtering the songs I sing through a 68-year-old
sensibility; I understand more and my interpretation is better."</TE>
<TE>   And, she said, she felt she still had something to offer
audiences.</TE>
<TE>   Invariably, she continued to receive requests to sing that
"terrible" song, "Come On-a My House."</TE>
<TE>   "I can usually squirm out of it," she said a few years ago. "But
it gets worse. People ask me to sing ['How much Is That] Doggie in
the Window?' which wasn't even my song. It was Patti Page's."</TE>
<TE>   With a throaty laugh, she added, "I just hope she gets asked
plenty of times to sing 'Come On-a My House.' "</TE>
<TE>   Clooney is survived by her husband, Dante DiPaolo; five children
from her marriage to Ferrer, Miguel Ferrer, Maria Murdoch, Gabriel
Ferrer, Monsita Botwick and Rafael Ferrer; 10 grandchildren; her
brother, Nick Clooney, and sister, Gail Clooney Darley.</TE>
<TE>   The family asks that any donations be made to the Rosemary Clooney
Fund for Support of Pulmonary Research, c/o Mayo Clinic, Rochester,
Minnesota 55905. Services will be held in Beverly Hills and Kentucky
and are pending.</TE>

<HD>Autistic Girl, 5, Is Hit, Killed by SUV</HD>
<DH>Fatality: She slips out of her Laguna Niguel home and
wanders into busy street. Driver is sought.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 5-year-old autistic girl was struck and killed late Friday near her
Laguna Niguel home by a sport utility vehicle that left the scene,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   "We're wondering why the driver didn't stop," said Orange County
Sheriff's Sgt. Steve Doan. "I don't know if it's a case of the driver
not knowing that he or she struck a child. We won't know until we
question the driver."</LD>
<LD>   The girl, Mya Richard, died hours afterward at Mission Hospital
Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo. An autopsy completed
Saturday revealed that Mya died of blunt-force trauma, coroner's
officials said. Authorities said Mya, wearing only a diaper, slipped
out of the house through a rear "doggy door" about 8:20 p.m. Friday.</LD>
<TE>   She managed to climb over a 2-foot block wall, push open a wooden
gate and walk down a steep, 100-foot slope covered with ice plant and
dried shrubs.</TE>
<TE>   The girl crossed three lanes of Crown Valley Parkway. Several
motorists and a passing animal control officer stopped their cars in
the eastbound lanes as the girl stood in the grassy center island
near Moulton Parkway.</TE>
<TE>   "The officer turned on all her flashers and tried to talk to the
girl and keep her in the center median," Doan said.</TE>
<TE>   But Mya put her hands over her ears, stepped into westbound
traffic and was hit by the white sport utility vehicle and thrown
about 50 feet into the opposing lanes, Doan said.</TE>
<TE>   "Because she is autistic, I'm certain when she came down the hill,
she didn't know the danger and her surroundings," said grandfather
Dennis Richard. He arrived early Saturday from his home in Las Vegas
to be with the family. "She's never wandered out of sight. It's just
devastating."</TE>
<TE>   The girl's mother had gone to run an errand and left Mya and her
7-year-old brother, Jeremy, with the live-in caretaker, who is
specially trained in working with autistic children.</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, the sitter heard sirens and looked out a back
window, where she spotted Mya lying in the street, surrounded by
police cars. The animal control officer and one of the motorists--a
trauma surgeon--were giving the girl CPR.</TE>
<TE>   "Mya was their life," Dennis Richard said, referring to parents
Donny and Judy Richard.</TE>

<HD>Senate Passes Alternate Exhaust Emissions Bill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The state Senate on Saturday passed a hastily drafted bill aimed at
weakening a high-powered lobbying campaign against a plan that would
make California the first state to regulate exhaust emissions to
reduce global warming.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, sent to the Assembly on a 23-16 vote, is very similar to
an earlier global warming bill that has stalled in the lower chamber
amid intense lobbying.</LD>
<LD>   At issue is a controversial plan that would empower the state Air
Resources Board to devise a strategy to cut back tailpipe emissions
of carbon dioxide, an ingredient of the global warming phenomenon.</LD>
<TE>   The stalled bill (AB 1058), sponsored by the Natural Resources
Defense Council, would give the agency broad powers to impose
restrictions on carbon dioxide gases from automobiles.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents charge the powers go too far.</TE>
<TE>   Foes of the bill by Assemblywoman Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills)
have mounted an aggressive statewide advertising campaign that has
brought the bill to a halt in the Assembly and is threatening to kill
it.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition includes a coalition of politically powerful
interests, including organized labor, automobile manufacturers, new
car dealers, oil companies and major employer organizations. They
claim the plan would outlaw the sale of gas-slurping SUVs, increase
taxes and reduce the number of miles that Californians are allowed to
drive.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters deny these assertions, saying such arguments are
falsehoods promoted by an election year advertising blitz designed to
derail the plan, which would be the first by any state in the
country. The centerpiece of the campaign urges Californians to call
their lawmakers and ask them to vote against it.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the Senate narrowly passed the global warming bill,
but it ground to a stop in the Assembly, where moderate "business
Democrats," who are the swing votes, are under intense pressure to
defeat the measure.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to soften opposition to the bill, the Senate on
Saturday passed a second bill which Senate leader John L. Burton
(D-San Francisco) called an alternative to the original bill.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the Assembly will have two very similar bills to
choose from.</TE>
<TE>   Minority Republicans oppose both. Gov. Gray Davis has not taken a
position on either.</TE>
<TE>   Burton said the latest bill (AB 1493) was a compromise attempt to
satisfy complaints against the original bill, including a prohibition
against raising taxes by the Air Resources Board.</TE>
<TE>   He said the new bill, written Friday night and rushed to the floor
without normal committee hearings, also would prohibit the board from
outlawing certain classes of gasoline-slurping vehicles, such as
SUVs.</TE>
<TE>   But Republicans accused Burton of attempting to "sneak" through a
bill they claimed was designed not as a compromise but to sabotage
the expensive advertising campaign of the business and labor
opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Ray Haynes (R-Riverside) noted that the campaign has made the
bill number of the Pavley legislation, AB 1058, a core feature of its
advertisements. He warned that the Burton bill would now become the
center of attention and opponents would have to redo their
advertising and try to instill a new bill number, AB 1493, in the
voters' minds.</TE>

<HD>A. Melin, 77; Introduced Frisbee and Hula Hoop</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arthur "Spud" Melin, co-founder of Wham-O Inc., which gave the world
such leisure icons as the Frisbee, the Hula Hoop and the
Superball--along with such duds as Instant Fish--has died. He was 77.</LD>
<LD>   Melin, who had Alzheimer's disease, died Friday in Newport Beach.
He had lived for many years in San Gabriel before his retirement.</LD>
<LD>   Travel broadens one, it is often said, and it certainly gave Melin
ideas. Both the Hula Hoop and Instant Fish sprang from Melin's
interest in other parts of the world.</LD>
<TE>   His great success story was the Hula Hoop. Melin and his wife,
Suzy, became aware of children in Australia and elsewhere around the
South Pacific playing with a bamboo or rattan ring by swinging it
around their hips.</TE>
<TE>   He suggested they start making the toy at Wham-O, the San
Gabriel-based company he had started with his childhood friend,
Richard Knerr. The Americans had trouble duplicating the moves of the
Australian kids until a Wham-O executive, Richard Gillespie, finally
mastered the art after four straight days of practice.</TE>
<TE>   Wham-O introduced the Hula Hoop in 1958 and was soon producing
20,000 a day. Other companies began making their own versions, and
within four months Americans were spinning 20 million of the hoops
and organizing national competitions. Over the years, Wham-O churned
out 25 million Hula Hoops.</TE>
<TE>   Richard A. Johnson, author of the book "American Fads," declared
the Hula Hoop "the undisputed granddaddy of American fads.... No
sensation has ever swept the country like the Hula Hoop," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Melin's African-inspired bright idea fared poorly in comparison.
While visiting that continent he saw a little fish that buried its
eggs in mud during the dry season. When the rains came, the eggs
hatched. Melin thought he could sell chunks of egg-embedded mud,
instruct buyers to add water, and provide fish to delight the
millions.</TE>
<TE>   But the imported fish produced no hatchable eggs. More than $1
million accepted in orders by Wham-O had to be refunded and the
project was abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   When Melin and Knerr started their company in 1948, they named it
for the sound made by their top product--a slingshot hitting its
target. They also offered mail-order sporting goods, such as pellet
guns, crossbows and daggers.</TE>
<TE>   But they hit the big time when Walter Frederick Morrison walked in
with a toy flying disk, marrying the 1950s furor over UFOs and a game
played by Yalies tossing empty pie tins from the Frisbie Baking Co.
in Hartford, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   Wham-O began selling the plastic disks in 1957 as Pluto Platters.
Initially, Melin and Knerr marketed them on college campuses by word
of mouth.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't want it used as a toy," Melin told the Pasadena
Star-News in 1998. "We wanted it to be a sport."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the public of all ages also adopted them, buying
more than 100 million Frisbees in 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   Just why Melin and Knerr changed the disk's name to Frisbee in
1958 remains debatable. Some versions say Knerr had become aware that
the idea had come from flinging the Frisbie pie tins, and he changed
the spelling slightly to trademark the name. Knerr was also quoted in
1997 as saying the name came from a comic strip called "Mr. Frisbie."</TE>
<TE>   In 1965, while Hula Hoops were still rolling out the door, Melin
and Knerr introduced the Superball, a small rubber ball with an
exceptionally high bounce invented and patented by chemist Norman H.
Stingley. Within six months, they sold 7 million Superballs.</TE>
<TE>   Wham-O was also responsible for a few ideas that did not etch
themselves into popular history as indelibly as the Frisbee, the Hula
Hoop or the Superball. In the height of the Cold War, when families
were building backyard bunkers to live in following nuclear attack,
Wham-O marketed Do-It-Yourself Fallout Shelters for $119.</TE>
<TE>   And in answer to a music and dance fad of the era, it also
marketed Chubby Checker Limbo sets.</TE>
<TE>   Melin retired from the company when it was sold to Kransco Group
Cos. in 1982. Wham-O was resold to Mattel Inc. in 1994 and to a group
of investors in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Along with his wife, Melin is survived by five daughters, Linda,
Sally, June, Carol and Della; one brother, Tom; and 11 grandchildren.
Services are being planned in Newport Beach on Tuesday.</TE>

<LD>This is a column I can't write without crying, but that's OK. The
tears now are mostly of happiness--</LD>
<LD>   and relief. Besides, the same eyes that sprang the tears have also
seen the most joyous thing they're ever likely to see.</LD>
<LD>   A week ago Friday, I got the worst phone call of my life. Yes,
worse than the one telling me my father had died--he had been ailing
for a long time and his death spared him further pain.</LD>
<TE>   The call nine days ago told me that Bridget, the 24-year-old
daughter of longtime friends, had been abducted from her apartment in
Killeen, Texas, sometime around 2 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The assailant had literally crashed through her bolted door and,
at gunpoint, forced her to drive to a nearby ATM, where he made her
withdraw $200. He then drove her a few miles to a dead-end road and
walked her down a trail of rocks, gravel and weeds.</TE>
<TE>   After forcing her to strip, he raped her. Bridget remembers him
then telling her to walk farther down the path. Then he shot her
three times--hitting her twice in the back and once in the right
elbow.</TE>
<TE>   Bridget, a month shy of her 25th birthday, was supposed to die on
that desolate, hard ground, a thousand miles from family.</TE>
<TE>   But she didn't.</TE>
<TE>   She lay still, waiting until the assailant drove off in her car.
Remembering they had passed a subdivision before pulling off the
road, she began to crawl the 200 yards or so to the nearest house.
Fearing she'd bleed to death at that pace, she got up and began
running.</TE>
<TE>   She would say later that God lifted her to her feet.</TE>
<TE>   At the first house, a single woman with two children was afraid to
let her in but called 911. Frantic, Bridget went to the next house,
where a 43-year-old retired Army man named Frank James opened the
door and probably saved her life.</TE>
<TE>   After six hours of surgery, mostly to repair abdominal damage,
Bridget was considered out of mortal danger.</TE>
<TE>   I've known her parents, Mike and Barb, since 1970.</TE>
<TE>   Mike and I were cub reporters in Omaha, and he's been a best
friend all those years since. We've talked about everything under the
sun and quit counting the times we'd laughed together.</TE>
<TE>   He'd been in Orange County just a couple of weekends earlier to
see his lifelong favorite team, the Reds, play the Angels in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Until last week, we'd never cried together.</TE>
<TE>   Please, God, not Bridget.</TE>
<TE>   When you don't have your own children, you take pleasure in those
of friends and relatives--</TE>
<TE>   some more than others.</TE>
<TE>   Although I didn't see her often, Bridget was one of those who
occupied a special shelf in the recesses of my brain--Bridget the
thinker, the philosopher, the writer, the Beatles lover, the
first-grade teacher who volunteered in poor neighborhoods and who
loved nothing as much as helping children learn to read. A few years
ago, I interviewed her for a column about our both being Beatles
fans. In the wake of her father's recent visit, I had e-mailed her
the night she was attacked.</TE>
<TE>   I got to her bedside in the critical-care unit late Saturday
afternoon. I'd hoped to be stoic, but the moment she smiled and
squeezed my hand, the 30 hours of pent-up relief over her survival
spilled out.</TE>
<TE>   I think I said, through tears, "Do you have any idea how joyful we
all are that you had the courage not to give up?"</TE>
<TE>   She smiled and tears trickled from the corner of her eyes. It's a
sight I'll cherish the rest of my life.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to lighten the mood, I said, with wonderment:</TE>
<TE>   "How did you do it?"</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how I did it," she said. "I was so scared."</TE>
<TE>   Mike and Barb and her two older siblings--Laura, 29, and Kevin,
28--have been magnificently brave and full of grace during the past
week. The fourth child, 14-year-old Nick, arrived Saturday from
summer camp.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the news from the hospital has been good, but everyone
knows there is a long road ahead.</TE>
<TE>   I know I've seen something profound the past week, and there's a
burning desire to articulate it.</TE>
<TE>   But it's tied up in roiling emotions, the product of having seen
the extremes of humanity--</TE>
<TE>   the assailant's utter contempt for life and Bridget's incredible
will to preserve it.</TE>
<TE>   In broad strokes, the story is about good triumphing over evil, of
courage over cowardice.</TE>
<TE>   Bridget should have died out there. Instead, we've seen her smile
at her year-old nephew, David, and 3-month-old niece, Jenna. One
night last week, I watched as she laughed, probably till it hurt,
with brother Kevin while they played cards.</TE>
<TE>   We've also seen her cry and be depressed. That signals what
challenges lie ahead for her.</TE>
<TE>   But it has not been a sad week.</TE>
<TE>   We had more cause for joy beyond her survival: The suspected
assailant was caught not long after the attack when he returned to
the scene to show two friends what he had allegedly done. Police were
in the area and made an arrest. The anger at what he has done to
Bridget and her family won't soon go away. It can't be washed away or
wished away.</TE>
<TE>   If we promise to listen to Bridget--to really listen to what she
had to say after she survived--we can perhaps make sense of things
and remember what can help sustain us in our greatest hour of need.</TE>
<TE>   For me it is the note Bridget scribbled to Mike when they were
reunited in the hospital, where at first a respirator prevented her
from talking:</TE>
<TE>   "Dad," she wrote, "I was thinking about you and Mom and my whole
family when it was happening. I just wanted to see you again."</TE>

<HD>No Relief on Rates as Power Costs Fall</HD>
<DH>California: Increases remain in place despite a sharp drop
in market prices. State panel predicts a $2.7-billion windfall for
the utilities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM REITERMAN and NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD> TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite assurances from the state 15 months ago that electricity
customers could expect lower bills when power prices fell, relief is
still many months away, even though blackouts have ended and
wholesale prices have dropped.</LD>
<LD>   The hangover from California's electricity crisis of 2000 and 2001
means that consumers will not get the benefit of relatively cheap
power until at least next year, officials say.</LD>
<LD>   Wholesale power now costs one-tenth what it did when the state
Public Utilities Commission approved an average 30% rate hike in
March 2001.</LD>
<TE>   And regulators say Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas &amp;
Electric Co. are collecting hundreds of millions a month more than
they are paying for electricity. The PUC projects that the two
utilities will collect a total of $2.7 billion extra this year.</TE>
<TE>   But the agency thus far has rebuffed calls for rate reductions and
rebates.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners want the extra billions used to keep California's
two biggest utilities afloat and to help pay $7 billion in debts from
the state's voyage into the stormy deregulated electricity market.</TE>
<TE>   "The higher rates have become a slush fund that the PUC wants to
use," said attorney Matt Freedman of the Utility Reform Network.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, some customers have been forced to make tough choices.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a lot of discussions within the company about whether
we can really afford to stay in California," said Lori Johnson,
spokeswoman for Cargill Inc., a Bay Area salt refiner. "Our peak
summer rates were 16.5 cents [per kilowatt-hour]. We have a sister
salt plant in Utah, where rates are 2.9 cents."</TE>
<TE>   Under the PUC's tiered rate structure, customers feel varying
degrees of pain. The monthly bill for a homeowner in Edison territory
who uses a relatively miserly 500 kilowatt-hours per month, for
example, has risen slightly in the last year, from $64 to $67. But
the homeowner who uses an average of 750 kilowatt-hours a month pays
$116, up from $98.</TE>
<TE>   Others, particularly owners of large homes and businesses, have
seen rates climb more steeply.</TE>
<TE>   James Crettol says he is selling some of his 2,600 acres of
farmland in Kern County, partly because of electricity costs.</TE>
<TE>   And he has joined two dozen other PG&amp;E customers in seeking relief
through a complaint filed with the PUC.</TE>
<TE>   "The cost was astronomical," said Crettol, president of the
Agricultural Electrical Consumers Assn. "In 2000, our annual bill was
around $350,000. The following year we ended up with a bill about
$460,000."</TE>
<TE>   Facing Higher Bills</TE>
<TE>   Mary Ann Woomers, owner of the Scone Works of San Francisco, uses
far less electricity. But she also joined in the complaint against
the PUC, which coincidentally employs some of her customers.</TE>
<TE>   "I get so angry," said Woomers, who turned off a freezer and got
rid of two refrigerators to hold her bill steady at about $200 a
month.</TE>
<TE>   "The bill is the same, even though I'm using half of the
electricity."</TE>
<TE>   While Californians struggle with higher bills, the PUC is being
challenged by consumer groups, contending that it has violated its
own stated intentions for the rate-hike money.</TE>
<TE>   At its meeting March 27, 2001, with protesters jeering, the PUC
unanimously voted to raise rates by 3 cents a kilowatt-hour and to
make permanent an earlier hike of a penny per kilowatt-hour. The
commission said the increase would be used only to cover the future
costs of electricity purchased by the state for PG&amp;E and Edison
customers.</TE>
<TE>   "The rate increase is for power purchases on a going-forward basis
only," PUC President Loretta M. Lynch said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC also said that, if the rate hike raised more money than
needed, customers could get relief. "In the future, we can refund
revenues that exceed costs," the PUC decision said.</TE>
<TE>   The commission also stressed the importance of saving the state's
energy system from collapse, and it now wants to use the billions of
dollars to resolve PG&amp;E and Edison litigation that stems from losses
the utilities incurred before the rate increases.</TE>
<TE>   Under the PUC's plan to extricate PG&amp;E from bankruptcy, $4.7
billion of customer money would be used to help pay off the San
Francisco-based utility's thousands of creditors.</TE>
<TE>   That includes $1.1 billion amassed in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   In settling a lawsuit by Edison, the PUC allowed the utility to
use more than $3 billion in ratepayer money to pay its debts.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no other place" to get money, said Edison Vice President
Robert G. Foster. Edison suspended dividend payments to shareholders
as part of the PUC agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Jeff Brown said that getting the utilities out of
debt would benefit consumers by ensuring reliable service and would
help get the state out of the business of buying power.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Water Resources has been buying electricity for
PG&amp;E and Edison customers since Jan. 17, 2001. The rate increase was
intended to help repay the state.</TE>
<TE>   "The faster we get the utilities healthy and remove California
from the [power procurement] process, the better off we will be,"
Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Ratepayers Take Action</TE>
<TE>   Critics counter that the PUC is perverting its intended use of the
money and shirking its duty. "If they found that these creditor costs
were reasonable, they could put them in rates," said Bill Ahern,
senior policy analyst with the Consumers Union.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead they are using federal courts [as an excuse] to use the
slush fund and pay creditors."</TE>
<TE>   Ahern and 23 other ratepayers, ranging from homeowners and
small-business owners to labor leaders and a state lawmaker, filed a
PUC complaint in January, seeking refunds and a reduction in PG&amp;E
rates.</TE>
<TE>   "Recent developments in the wholesale electricity market have
largely mitigated, if not eliminated, the need for the surcharges,"
the complaint said.</TE>
<TE>   Brown acknowledged that the commission in 2001 planned to refund
to consumers extra money that was collected--and still does hope to
reduce rates.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea was that, as soon as it was feasible, as soon as the
utilities were back in shape ... that there would be a diminution of
rates," he said. "We have to come up with a legal rationale that
allows us to apply the money for past procurement costs."</TE>
<TE>   The PUC has yet to act on the 6-month-old consumer petition and
recently passed up two opportunities to reduce consumer rates to
bring them closer to the low market prices for power.</TE>
<TE>   The statutory end to the rate freeze under the state's
deregulation law came and went April 1 with no rate modifications. So
did a 3% rate cut scheduled for June 1.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Clanon, chief of the PUC energy division, said he anticipates
that the agency this summer or later will approve the 3% cut.</TE>
<TE>   He also predicted that PG&amp;E customers would see more relief in
early 2003 and that Edison customers would see rollbacks later that
year.</TE>
<TE>   That rate relief hinges on whether the PUC's Edison plan survives
a court appeal and whether the agency's plan for PG&amp;E is adopted by a
bankruptcy judge and the utility emerges from bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   The Utility Reform Network argues in its case before the U.S. 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals that the PUC illegally circumvented state
law and agreed to pay the utility's debts without proper public
review.</TE>
<TE>   The money at stake belongs to ratepayers, the group said, and
should be returned.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Carl W. Wood said that, in making a deal with Edison,
the PUC was trying to find a practical way to keep the state's
second-biggest electrical utility in business. "We could have driven
Edison into bankruptcy if we had chosen to do so," he said. "It would
not be a good outcome for consumers " and the state budget.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't move toward lower rates without utilities that are
effectively capable of procuring electricity," Wood said.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC faces another legal attack from the Santa Monica-based
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, which has asked the
state Supreme Court to declare that regulators acted illegally by
secretly putting together the PG&amp;E and Edison plans.</TE>
<TE>   Last week the court asked for an informal response from the PUC,
which has contended that it is allowed to discuss and vote on
litigation in executive session. The commission plans to hold public
hearings on its PG&amp;E plan.</TE>
<TE>   There is uncertainty about whether current low energy costs will
hold--and whether federal regulators will extend price caps that
expire this fall. The state is counting on continuing conservation to
help keep the lights on this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "In my view, this is not the time to roll back rates," said a
former PUC member, Richard Bilas. "We want as much conservation as we
can [get], and that means the higher the rates, the better."</TE>

<HD>It's a Long Road to Head of Rose Parade</HD>
<DH>Tradition: It will take Gary DiSano years to work up to
president of the Tournament. He lives for that day.</DH>

Roses.</SE>

<LD>Gary DiSano didn't think anything was unusual when the outgoing
president of the Tournament of Roses invited him to San Marino for a
casual dinner.</LD>
<LD>   The invitation, the president explained, was merely social, a way
of thanking DiSano for his hard work as volunteer in charge of
selecting floats for the 2002 Rose Parade.</LD>
<LD>   When DiSano arrived at the president's San Marino home on a chilly
Monday evening in January, he was led into the basement. As the
president mixed DiSano a gin and tonic, other members of the
tournament's executive committee appeared out of the den's dimly
lighted corners.</LD>
<TE>   "Welcome!" they shouted, taking turns shaking DiSano's hand.</TE>
<TE>   In that moment, a stunned DiSano realized a long-held dream--and
instantly felt a new weight on his shoulders. The handshakes meant
that the general manager of a Montebello automobile wheel and rim
company would be president of the world's most famous parade.</TE>
<TE>   The catch?</TE>
<TE>   He won't take office for eight years.</TE>
<TE>   DiSano, 55, has embarked on what one Tournament of Roses member
calls the longest apprenticeship in America. During a period of study
as long as that required of surgeons, DiSano will coordinate every
facet of staging the Rose Parade and Rose Bowl game, from negotiating
TV contracts to supervising the delivery of portable toilets--even,
according to parade lore, earning the power to control the weather.</TE>
<TE>   He will have one day of reward. On Jan. 1, 2010, DiSano will don
the traditional red coat of president and ride down Colorado
Boulevard. As president, he will give the parade his personal stamp,
picking the theme, the grand marshal, the first float, maybe even one
of the bands.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, there's a big if," says DiSano, his mood suddenly
turning somber, as he uses a cane to slowly walk around the desk in
his company office. "I don't know if I'll live that long."</TE>
<TE>   Lifelong Dedication</TE>
<TE>   Friends say DiSano lives for the parade.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in Los Angeles in such neighborhoods as Lincoln Heights
and Leimert Park, he often watched the Jan. 1 spectacle. In 1972, as
a recently discharged lieutenant who served in Vietnam, he found
himself living in Arcadia, lonely and bored. His girlfriend had left
him while he was in the service; his next-door neighbor, a Tournament
of Roses member, offered to nominate him for membership in the
organization.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, DiSano has had two careers--one as a tournament
member, the other working in the family business. Frequently, the two
overlap. He married a German woman who worked at one of the
companies; their three children sometimes accompany him to parade
functions.</TE>
<TE>   Before agreeing to sell Century Wheel &amp; Rim to an out-of-state
corporation a few years back, DiSano, who continues as general
manager, made sure the 20 hours a week he sometimes puts into the
tournament would be OK with the prospective buyers. Century's
headquarters are decorated with mementos from his 30 years as a
tournament member.</TE>
<TE>   "A commitment like this is always a balancing act," DiSano says.</TE>
<TE>   From the moment a new volunteer joins (and pays a $45 annual
membership fee), the tournament insists on learning by doing and
decades of dues-paying. DiSano spent his first six years as a member
providing muscle for the three "street committees," which line up the
floats and bands, run parade operations and oversee post-parade
events.</TE>
<TE>   These are thankless jobs, usually requiring volunteers to stay up
all night New Year's Eve on the streets of Pasadena. In his first
year, manning a traffic barricade, DiSano was nearly run over by a
speeding newspaper delivery truck. One year, he cleaned up horse
droppings.</TE>
<TE>   After their first six years, the tournament's members are assigned
for two-year terms on the organization's 31 other committees. DiSano
served on committees that fete special guests on New Year's Day,
inspect the construction of floats, choose parade bands, oversee
public relations staff, and choose the Rose queen and her court.</TE>
<TE>   Each committee has a chairperson. Promotions to chairmanships are
based, like other promotions, on grades from above. Every tournament
member is graded annually on his or her work in each parade.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Apprenticeship' is a good word for how all this works," says
Dave Davis, the treasurer.</TE>
<TE>   The highest rung of the tournament is the 14-member executive
committee. Five of those members are chosen at large from among all
935 tournament members, a recent innovation designed to give the
committee more youth and diversity. One of the 14 is the immediate
past president. The remaining eight are the princes of the
tournament--all standing in the line of succession to the presidency.</TE>
<TE>   Slowly Moving Up</TE>
<TE>   After each parade, each of the eight moves one rung--and a year
closer--to the presidency. And each January, the executive committee
adds a tournament member to the line of succession. Myriad rules and
traditions govern advancement, but the most talked about limitation
is age. Tournament of Roses members must retire at 65, meaning that a
member--to be president--must be appointed into the line of
succession before his or her 57th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Once appointed into the line, a member takes the title of vice
president and assumes a different set of oversight responsibilities
for each of the next seven years.</TE>
<TE>   A first-year president-in-training coordinates committees on the
Rose Bowl kickoff luncheon, media credentials, and properties, such
as those portable toilets. By the fifth year, the prospective
president is tournament secretary. In the seventh year, he or she is
executive vice president, with broad operational responsibilities for
the parade and football game.</TE>
<TE>   By the eighth year, they have overseen every committee in the
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "The Rose Parade is something like the circus--you have to join it
and know and learn it over years and years," says Vice President CL
Keedy, who will ride down Colorado Boulevard as president on Jan. 1,
2008.</TE>
<TE>   The slow pace of succession is accompanied by a variety of
traditions. There is a private dinner every Dec. 31 with Kodak, a
longtime parade sponsor. There is a weekend getaway, early in the
year, often to a golf resort somewhere in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Executive committee members meet at a long table in assigned
seats; members move one seat up the table each year until they reach
the head in their presidential year. On New Year's Day, the committee
members take seats along the first aisle in the grandstand at
Colorado Boulevard; they move one row down each year until they
"reach the street" as president.</TE>
<TE>   According to tradition, the executive vice president--the officer
just below president--is referred to as "the Weatherman." Each year,
the departing executive VP hands a weather radio and an umbrella
wrapped in fading Christmas paper to his immediate successor. The
umbrella has never been unwrapped, symbolizing the executive VP's
duty to prevent any rain on the parade.</TE>
<TE>   "I just have to make sure it won't rain, that's all," says Mike
Riffey, the current executive VP. "The way you do that is with a
positive attitude."</TE>
<TE>   Once an executive vice president has proved capable of stopping
the rain, the presidential year awaits. It is very much a reward.</TE>
<TE>   In an organization run by tradition and committee, the tournament
president is the one official who can make decisions on his own.
There are perks--the tournament pays for a trip for the president
anywhere in the world. Much of the president's work also involves
travel, as he visits every single band involved in the parade to help
raise money for their trips to Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Most presidents begin plotting their parade years ahead of time.
Riffey has already picked his theme (he won't say what it is and has
told only the attorney who registers the trademark) and organized a
trip to China and Tibet. "It's a long haul," says Riffey. "You can't
help but think ahead."</TE>
<TE>   It's such a long haul that three executive committee members never
finished their apprenticeship--most recently in 1993. They died
before they could ride down Colorado Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing that ends the apprenticeship," says DiSano, "is
death."</TE>
<TE>   Unlikely Candidate</TE>
<TE>   DiSano says he never thought he would end up in the line of
succession. He long ago relocated to Newport Beach. Most tournament
members live in Pasadena or surrounding cities.</TE>
<TE>   "And I'm not a member of the Valley Hunt or Annandale," a
reference to two clubs dominated by the rich or well-connected of the
San Gabriel Valley.</TE>
<TE>   But the line of succession has recently undergone democratization,
at least by the standards of the tournament. There are no minorities
in line, but there is a woman, Libby Evans Wright, who will go down
Colorado in 2006. The eight people currently in the line of
succession include small-time bankers, a retired hospital executive,
an assistant facilities manager, and the owner of the Hat, a pastrami
chain. There's only one certified blueblood in the bunch.</TE>
<TE>   DiSano impressed tournament executives with his chairmanship of
the committee overseeing floats. Last year, he supervised a
post-Sept. 11 remaking of many of the floats with patriotic themes.
What only a few friends in the tournament knew was that, even as he
ran what many see as the parade's most important committee, DiSano
was battling cancer.</TE>
<TE>   He was diagnosed with Hurthle cell carcinoma, a rare form of
thyroid cancer, in December 1999. In February 2000, he had his
thyroid and his hip removed. The cancer does not respond to
chemotherapy, so DiSano began an aggressive therapy that used massive
doses of vitamin A to literally change his cells.</TE>
<TE>   All during the therapy, he never took leave of his tournament
duties, even though his children--Christina, 15, Stephanie, 13, and
Dominic, 9--worried and his wife, Sabina, "told me I was nuts."</TE>
<TE>   "I think the parade work kept him going," says Riffey, who knew of
the illness. "If Gary had not had the tournament to turn to, Gary
might not be here today."</TE>
<TE>   The executive committee votes on whom to invite into its ranks,
although the entire membership must ratify those choices.</TE>
<TE>   When the committee picked DiSano, the immediate past president,
Ron Okum, called DiSano with the seemingly innocuous invitation to
dinner at Okum's home.</TE>
<TE>   "I was surprised and embarrassed when the executive committee
showed up in Ron's basement," says DiSano. DiSano now says he has
wondered whether he wasn't chosen in part because of his illness.
While his treatment is progressing well, 85% of people with his type
of thyroid cancer die within five years. Given the eight-year lead
time, "I guess you could say I'm an interesting choice," he says.</TE>
<TE>   On the night he was chosen, executive committee members took
DiSano to dinner at the Ritz-Carlton. Perpetuating a new tradition,
tournament Vice President Corky Conzonire, who will officiate the
2009 parade, gave DiSano a tie that had once belonged to Delmer
Beckhart. Beckhart died in June 1993, six months before he would have
presided over the 1994 parade.</TE>
<TE>   "Fantastic Adventure," the tie says, reflecting Beckhart's chosen
theme and the long apprenticeship ahead.</TE>

<LD>In a corner of Rustic Canyon below where Sunset Boulevard slices past
Will Rogers State Historic Park, a long-ago rich man's getaway still
stands, a whimsical legacy of an influential band of revelers.</LD>
<LD>   In the sheltered forest in a tucked-away public park, canyon
residents pride themselves on maintaining the 1923 Spanish
Revival-style Rustic Canyon Recreation Center, which was once the
clubhouse for a carousing outfit called the Uplifters Club.</LD>
<LD>   The driving force behind the exclusive men's group, which lasted
for more than 30 years, was plumbing magnate Harry Marston
Haldeman--grandfather of H.R. "Bob" Haldeman, a close advisor to
President Nixon who was convicted in the Watergate scandal cover-up
of the 1970s.</LD>
<TE>   Harry Haldeman was a big, jovial Chicagoan with a passion for
Cuban cigars, hard liquor and good times. In 1910, he came to L.A.
and joined the Los Angeles Athletic Club.</TE>
<TE>   But he missed "the Bugs," a small, tight-knit group of friends he
had formed from the ranks of the Chicago Athletic Club. So, along
with 20 or so kindred L.A. spirits, he established the Uplifters Club
in 1913.</TE>
<TE>   Drawn from the rich, the powerful and the notable, its members
soon included Marco Hellman, who owned a string of banks; Sim W.
Crabill, a Times Mirror executive; Ralph Hamlin, a bicycle
manufacturer who was reputed to have owned the first motorcycle west
of the Rockies; and Ernest R. Ball, who wrote the tune "When Irish
Eyes Are Smiling"--even though he had never seen Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   The club's roster eventually included such Hollywood celebrities
as Will Rogers, Walt Disney, Spencer Tracy, Clark Gable, Busby
Berkeley, Leo Carrillo, Harold Lloyd and Daryl F. Zanuck, plus
composer Ferde Grofe and county Sheriff Eugene Biscailuz.</TE>
<TE>   For a name, they turned to another member, L. Frank Baum, author
of the Oz books, who is said to have pounded back a few drinks before
coming up with the Lofty and Exalted Order of Uplifters. The moniker
referred both to the group's desire to "uplift art" by staging
slapstick plays, some of them written by Baum with music by Louis
Gottschalk, and to its conviction, expressed by Baum, that "nothing
has been found more elevating than a cocktail, except perhaps several
drinks."</TE>
<TE>   Despite a life beset by ill health and financial woes, Baum used
his imagination and leadership to help the Uplifters transcend their
everyday lives. He died in May 1919, one month before Prohibition
began to suck the country dry.</TE>
<TE>   Club member Hays Rice wrote a poem for an all-day celebration: The
rye was once upon the bar.</TE>
<TE>   Now the bar is on the rye.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, how will we wet our whistles,</TE>
<TE>   boys,</TE>
<TE>   When the world goes dry.</TE>
<TE>   Determined not to let Prohibition spoil their fun, the Uplifters
decided to build a clubhouse of their own, away from the Athletic
Club, where they could continue to tip the bottle, break bread and
indulge in good times. For years, they had held their annual bash,
the Hijinx, at spots from Arrowhead to Del Mar, Santa Barbara to
Griffith Park, where they drank, cavorted, staged ribald plays and
competed in sporting events, including greased-pig races.</TE>
<TE>   In 1920, they cut a $40,000 deal on a ranch where they could
escape hectic city life. Club members purchased a 40-acre swath of
what would eventually grow into a 120-acre oasis in Rustic Canyon,
with a creek flowing through it. Not far from where future member
Will Rogers would soon buy a sprawling estate, the old ranch was
remodeled with a swimming pool, tennis courts, shooting range,
amphitheater and dormitories for relatives and guests.</TE>
<TE>   Some years later, strait-laced Methodists from Huntington Beach
purchased land just up the hill, whence they could peer down on the
Uplifters and pray for their souls, which they did, according to
Randy Young, a historian of the area. (His book, "Rustic Canyon and
the Story of the Uplifters," written with his mother, Betty Lou
Young, is the source tome on the period and place.)</TE>
<TE>   "It was a strange juxtaposition between morality of the time, with
the Methodists next door and the club members letting their hair
down, running around drunk and naked with a certain kind of woman,"
said Randy Young.</TE>
<TE>   In December 1922, as members began building private getaway
cottages on land they leased from the club, the clubhouse burned
down. The only lives lost were those of a bunch of caged turkeys
being fattened up for a New Year's celebration. The following year, a
bigger and better headquarters, this time with a red-tile
fire-resistant roof, rose on the same spot. Soon a polo field and
half-mile racetrack were added.</TE>
<TE>   Cinematographer Charles Rosher was one member who leased land and
built a fairy-tale bungalow, filling a room with Oriental antiques
for his lover, actress Anna May Wong. Hellman, the banker, bought
three log cabins from the set of the 1923 film "The Courtship of
Miles Standish" and had them moved to the site. In the late 1940s and
early '50s, one would later serve as the summer retreat for Earl
Warren, the California governor who became chief justice of the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   Once a year, in their Hijinx gala, members staged circus
extravaganzas and chariot races, and bet on the competitors. In 1925,
one toga-clad driver and his two-burro team stopped dead on the
home-stretch turn. "One flea too many caused [him] to lose by a
scratch," the judges declared.</TE>
<TE>   In 1928, Haldeman, who had led the club in the art of high jinks,
satirizing high society in songs, plays and revelry, resigned amid
strained relationships. He was under indictment in the celebrated
Julian Petroleum Scandal. He was acquitted, but in 1930 he suffered a
fatal heart attack while testifying in a trial unrelated to the
Julian case. He was 58 years old.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1930s, neighborhood kids sneaked onto the polo
grounds just yards from a tangle of thundering hooves and flying
mallets, close enough to cheer on pro polo champions such as Eric
Pedley and Carleton Burke and to hear humorist Rogers shout
"yippie-ki-yay!" from his own horse. (In 1931, Santa Barbara polo pro
Jim W. Colt was killed during a match.) Club sports director Reginald
"Snowy" Baker took the kids under his wing, salvaging broken polo
mallets for them and letting them exercise the horses for him.</TE>
<TE>   Olympic gold medalists Buster Crabbe and Johnny Weissmuller used
the pool in the 1940s, while Wimbledon champion May Sutton Bundy
shared the tennis court with three sisters for a Childrens Hospital
benefit in 1947.</TE>
<TE>   The demise of the year-round adult sanctuary, with its grand
ballroom, drinking halls and "library"--actually a poker parlor--came
after World War II, when the Uplifters began selling off portions of
the property as membership dwindled. By the 1950s, the club had been
virtually disbanded and the clubhouse stood abandoned, to become the
haunt of inebriated teenage revelers who skinny-dipped in the pool
and once ate a pig that they had stolen from a Santa Monica luau.</TE>
<TE>   In 1953, oil company heiress Mabell Machris saved the day, buying
what was left of the place and donating it to the city as a park.</TE>
<TE>   To this day, Uplifters' character sketches by cartoonist George
Herriman, known for his popular daily comic strip "Krazy Kat," line
the walls of the Rustic Canyon Recreation Center, evoking the ghosts
of a who's who of Los Angeles' movers and shakers. In the old club
tradition, some of the sketches are considered politically incorrect,
and one is papered over.</TE>

<HD>Calling for Help in Wildfire Country</HD>
<DH>Safety: Neighbor says phone service could have made a
critical difference when destructive Wolf blaze erupted. It took 20
minutes to alert rangers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes when he is alone at the bar he owns high above Ojai, Tom
Wolf can almost hear his doctor's warning: Isolation is no place for
a man with a bad heart and no phone.</LD>
<LD>   The 64-year-old was reminded of his cardiologist's words June 1
when a wildfire, which would soon bear his name, began roaring across
Los Padres National Forest after starting in the backyard of Wolf's
bar.</LD>
<LD>   With no phone service available for Wolf to call for help, forest
rangers only learned of the fire when a bar patron on a motorcycle
raced up the hill and told them in person 20 minutes later.</LD>
<TE>   Wolf, a retired Oxnard college professor, said he wants to make
sure he doesn't face a similar disaster without a way to reach
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   There will be a noon meeting at his bar today to discuss
establishing an emergency communication network for the fewer than
400 people living without regular phone service in the mountains and
canyons nearby. Wolf said he plans to purchase a satellite telephone,
the best bet for communicating in the area, and he wants others
living in the area to do the same.</TE>
<TE>   Across the state, more than 112,000 people live in areas so
isolated that land phone lines and cellular towers usually never
reach them. Some live in rural desert villages, but most live in
bone-dry forests, and their homes could be destroyed if predictions
of a record wildfire season are correct.</TE>
<TE>   Phone companies have typically avoided doing the costly work
needed to provide service in rural areas because it can take years to
see a financial return, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a business decision; they want to make sure they get their
investment back," said Linda Rochester, an analyst with the state
Public Utilities Commission, who has worked on a state Assembly bill
that will provide $10 million in state grants to bring phone service
to rural communities next June.</TE>
<TE>   "It's strange that some people still don't have phone service.
There may be people who don't want phone service, but for those who
do, it [will be] available," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Wolf spent last week driving back and forth from his Oxnard home
up to Los Padres National Forest attempting to alert people about his
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Along dirt roads and in remote cabin communities, Wolf posted
photocopied fliers on mailboxes and bulletin boards from the Sespe
Wilderness to the Rose and Lockwood valleys. Wolf said the meeting is
an effort to explore ideas to create a communication system, either
through satellite phones or shortwave radio.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to show how important [communication] is," Wolf said.
"They could have a heart attack or chop their arm off with a
chainsaw. Everyone who can afford it should have one."</TE>
<TE>   The bar owner said he has received few responses from his
invitation, and he is unsure who will attend. Two sheriff's deputies
who patrol the 860 square miles of rocky peaks and wooded forests
will be there, as will a representative from a satellite phone
service.</TE>
<TE>   "The people that are interested in having people know where they
are will be there," said Senior Deputy Bob Berger, who works out of
the Lockwood Valley Sheriff's Station. "Some people up there just
don't want people to know where they are, and they like not having
outside contact.</TE>
<TE>   A former neighborhood activist in Oxnard, Wolf said he has tried
and failed before to build support for what he had called the
Neighborhood Council for the People of Los Padres.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to contact people, because they don't want to be
contacted or be organized," Wolf said. "It was so inefficient and
there was such a lack of interest that I gave up on it."</TE>
<TE>   The recent fire has pushed him to try again. No one wants a fire
named after them, he said, especially one that Wolf said could have
been prevented.</TE>
<TE>   Wolf is convinced an emergency plan starting with better
communication among those living deep in the forest can prevent the
spread of wildfires in the future.</TE>
<TE>   When the June 1 fire broke out just before 3 p.m., Wolf said,
several people at the bar--a popular stop for the weekend biker
crowd--tried to use their cell phones to call for help.</TE>
<TE>   A few bikers hopped on their choppers and headed up the two-lane
highway near the bar waving their cell phones in the air along the
way trying in vain to get a signal.</TE>
<TE>   Fire crews from the U.S. Forest Service's Ozena Station near
Lockwood Valley Road, about a 20-minute ride north of the bar, were
finally alerted to the blaze when a motorcyclist reached them, Wolf
said.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the first crews arrived 20 minutes later--at least 40
minutes after the blaze began--the fire was already racing toward
twin peaks behind the bar and, beyond that, miles of dry chaparral
and pine.</TE>
<TE>   Before it was stopped, the Wolf fire would burn for two weeks,
scorch nearly 23,000 acres and cost federal, state and county
agencies more than $14 million to extinguish. And it didn't have to
happen, Wolf said.</TE>
<TE>   Although far from guaranteed to hold a signal in the forest, a
satellite phone may have permitted forest service officials to be
alerted that much sooner, he said.</TE>
<TE>   People living deep off some of the winding dirt roads that lead up
to Pine Mountain Ridge and to the Lockwood Valley said the recent
fire was a reminder that good communication is critical.</TE>
<TE>   Tilford Jackson, a 41-year-old professional musician, commutes
from Los Angeles to a one-room cabin he shares with his aging
Labrador retriever, Count Basie, in a forest area of the Lockwood
Valley. He said he will miss the meeting because he is working, "but
we definitely need some cell service up here."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson and dozens of other residents who live along a flowing
stream stocked year-round with rainbow trout say they have inquired
about getting regular telephone service established for their area.</TE>
<TE>   "We're at the end of Ventura County," Jackson said. "No one wants
to come up here. They think we're all a bunch of crazy loners."</TE>

<HD>Forester Charged in Blaze in Colo. Is Fired for 'Conduct'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>DURANGO, Colo.</DL>
<LD>The U.S. Forest Service confirmed Saturday that it has fired Terry
Lynn Barton, the woman charged with starting the huge Hayman fire.</LD>
<LD>   Barton, 38, learned of her termination in a letter sent last week,
said Forest Service spokesman Lynn Young. He said Barton was fired
because of her "conduct" but would not elaborate.</LD>
<LD>   Barton is accused of starting a fire that has destroyed at least
133 homes and consumed 137,000 acres since it erupted June 8.</LD>
<TE>   Full containment of the fire is expected tonight, a spokesman
said. More than 1,600 firefighters have toiled to put out the blaze
in a fight that has cost more than $27 million.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted of all four counts, Barton could go to prison for up
to 65 years. She was released from jail Thursday under conditions
that include staying at a halfway house and not entering any forests.</TE>
<TE>   Her trial is scheduled to start Aug. 26.</TE>
<TE>   Barton, who was patrolling the area where the Hayman fire started,
55 miles southwest of Denver, told investigators she was burning a
letter from her estranged husband and it accidentally sparked a
wildfire.</TE>
<TE>   Barton, an 18-year veteran of seasonal Forest Service work, was on
a one-year trial, or probation, to become a permanent, part-time
Forest Service worker when the blaze ignited.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two prospective members of the Hells Angels motorcycle club were shot
and wounded in what police said appeared to be a continuation of gang
rivalry.</LD>
<LD>   The shootings north of Concord came less than two weeks after
thousands of bikers from around North America left the area after
their annual Motorcycle Week, which had brought police warnings of
potential violence.</LD>
<LD>   "It appears to be part of the ongoing cycle of violence between
the motorcycle gang rivals," Sgt. John MacLellan said.</LD>
<TE>   In May, nine members of the Pagans club pleaded guilty to assault
charges from a fight in which one man was killed in Plainview, N.Y.
In April, two Hells Angels were killed in a fight with the Mongols in
Laughlin, Nev.</TE>

<LD>Archeologists digging at the site of a black-owned saloon in a
historic Old West mining town have unearthed a 130-year-old bottle of
hot sauce.</LD>
<LD>   The oldest style of Tabasco bottle known to exist was
reconstructed from 21 shards excavated from beneath the site of the
Boston Saloon of Virginia City, Nev., about 20 miles southeast of
Reno.</LD>
<LD>   The bottle suggests that the saloon, which was owned by a black
man from Massachusetts and catered to blacks and whites from 1864 to
1875, was among the first eateries to introduce the sauce.</LD>
<TE>   Edmund McIlhenny, a New Orleans banker, began blending aged red
peppers, salt and vinegar to create the Tabasco brand pepper sauce in
1868 on Avery Island, La.</TE>
<TE>   McIlhenny Co. officials say the sauce maker first used old cologne
bottles to hold the sauce.</TE>

<HD>Bush Cites the Need to Restore Faith in Corporate America</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Saying that executives involved in corporate scandals will face fines
and jail time, President Bush called Saturday for rules and laws to
"restore faith in the integrity of American business" in the wake of
a series of events shaking the country's economy.</LD>
<LD>   "No violation of the public's trust will be tolerated. The federal
government will be vigilant in prosecuting wrongdoers to ensure
investors and workers maintain the highest confidence in American
business," Bush said in his weekly radio address.</LD>
<LD>   Democrats joined the president in calling for quick action to stem
"the crisis of confidence" but urged passage of their own
legislation, approved June 18 by the Senate Banking Committee on a
bipartisan vote of 17 to 4.</LD>
<TE>   The panel's chairman, Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland, said in
the Democrats' radio response that the bill he sponsored "strengthens
corporate accountability and auditor integrity, addresses conflicts
of interest, and protects employees, pension holders and investors
against fraud and deception."</TE>
<TE>   Bush expressed outrage last week when telecommunications giant
WorldCom Inc. revealed $3.8 billion in accounting irregularities and
Xerox Corp. on Friday disclosed a $2-billion revenue gap in its
books.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said that those responsible for corporate scandals will be
held accountable.</TE>
<TE>   The president warned that "executives who commit fraud will face
financial penalties, and, when they are guilty of criminal
wrongdoing, they will face jail time."</TE>
<TE>   "We must have rules and laws that restore faith in the integrity
of American business."</TE>
<TE>   The issue of how to clean up corporate America has become a
dominant topic at the White House and on Capitol Hill. Republicans
and Democrats agree something must be done but differ on the details.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's political fortunes could depend on his stewardship of the
U.S. economy, which he said Saturday remains fundamentally strong
"despite recent abuses of the public trust." Democrats would like to
blame Republicans for creating a deregulatory atmosphere conducive to
corporate greed.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said Friday that
"unfortunately, the desire for reform is not to be found" in
approaches favored by the White House, the Republican-controlled
House and the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The Sarbanes bill is seen as providing tougher enforcement. It
would create a regulatory board that Democrats see as more
independent. Under the Republican plan, the regulatory board would be
supervised by the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan said the administration is
working with Congress and hopes to resolve the differences "so that
the president can sign good legislation."</TE>
<TE>   Bush, who plans a major speech July 9 in New York concerning
corporate responsibility on Wall Street, said in his radio address
that accounting-related abuses should be punished by banning
corporate executives from profiting from erroneous financial
statements.</TE>
<TE>   "When bad accounting practices make the company appear to be more
successful than it actually is, corporate executives should lose
their phony profits gained at the expense of employees and
stockholders," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that corporate officers "who violate the public's trust
should never be given that trust again."</TE>
<TE>   His plan would require top executives to disclose when they buy or
sell company stock within two days of the transaction. Currently,
executives can wait a year or more before disclosing personal
transactions.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said the SEC has sought to take away the profits of senior
executives from four companies.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the SEC ordered the top executives of the 1,000
largest public companies to certify that the financial information
they submitted in the last year was fair and accurate.</TE>
<TE>   "America is ushering in a new era of responsibility, and that
ethic of responsibility must extend to America's boardrooms," Bush
said. "The unethical actions of a few should not be allowed to call
into question our whole free enterprise system."</TE>

<HD>Bush's Colonoscopy Shows No Polyps</HD>
<DH>Procedure: Doctor says the president is in 'outstanding
health.' Vice President Cheney held the reins of power for 2 hours,
15 minutes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- President Bush received a clean bill of health Saturday
after a colonoscopy, during which he transferred the powers of his
office to Vice President Dick Cheney for 2 hours and 15 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   During the 20-minute procedure, physicians found no polyps, which
can be precursors of cancer, in the president's colon. In two
previous colonoscopies, in 1998 and 1999, Bush's doctors each time
found two small noncancerous polyps and removed them.</LD>
<LD>   ''The president continues to be in outstanding health,'' said Air
Force Col. Richard J. Tubb, Bush's physician. He said the president
does not need another colonoscopy for five years.</LD>
<TE>   The procedure took place early Saturday morning at Camp David, the
presidential retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney spent his time as acting president in his own West Wing
office, doing routine work, which included meeting with staff and
receiving his daily intelligence briefings. He left the White House
about noon.</TE>
<TE>   ''I'd have to ask his staff if they addressed him as 'Mr. Acting
President,' " said White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer. ''I
don't think they did; it's a mouthful.''</TE>
<TE>   When asked whether Bush teased Cheney about his brief stint as
acting president when he called to let him know he was back in
charge, Fleischer said, "No, I think it was pretty straightforward,
boring conversation."</TE>
<TE>   After the procedure was completed and Bush reassumed his powers,
administration officials at the White House recounted the highly
choreographed sequence of events.</TE>
<TE>   The transfer of power took effect soon after Bush invoked Section
3 of the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, which governs the
transfer of presidential power.</TE>
<TE>   As physicians began administering anesthesia to the president, who
quickly fell asleep, White House Counsel Alberto R. Gonzales took a
signed document, hopped into a golf cart and drove to another
building within the Camp David compound.</TE>
<TE>   There, he faxed the document to House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert
(R-Ill.) and Senate President Pro Tem Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), the
men next in line of presidential succession after Cheney.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, White House Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr.
telephoned Hastert and Byrd. Upon confirmation of the letter's
transmission, Gonzales also faxed a copy to Cheney's office in the
White House.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Gonzales said, ''we made a call to the vice
president's office to make sure that he understood that he was now
acting as president.''</TE>
<TE>   The official transfer began at 7:09 a.m., the moment of the faxed
transmission. Anesthesia began at that minute as well, and it put
Bush to sleep within 30 to 60 seconds, Tubb said.</TE>
<TE>   The transfer of power was prudent, Tubb said, because ''medically,
the president would be at least momentarily unable to answer issues
that arose.''</TE>
<TE>   About midway through the colonoscopy, following standard
procedures, physicians began easing up on the intravenous anesthesia
and then discontinued it altogether shortly before the procedure
ended. Bush ''woke up'' about 30 to 60 seconds after the anesthesia
was stopped.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bush's colonoscopy was over in just 20 minutes, the
president did not revoke the transfer of power until 9:24 a.m. In the
interim, physicians examined the president and monitored his vital
signs. Bush also called Cheney and First Lady Laura Bush to let them
know that the procedure had ended.</TE>
<TE>   ''I think out of an abundance of caution, we wanted to reassure
everyone that the president was not going to be making a decision, a
hasty decision to rush back into and assume authority and power,''
Gonzales explained.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before 9 a.m., Bush returned to his cabin. Before sitting
down for a breakfast of waffles, the president hit some tennis balls
with a racquet for his dogs, Barney and Spot, to chase. After
breakfast, he went on a 4.5-mile walk, joined by Mrs. Bush, his
brother Marvin, Card and Card's wife.</TE>
<TE>   Then Bush hit the gym for ''a light workout,'' Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   ''The president said he feels great, and he has already resumed
his normal routine at Camp David,'' he added.</TE>
<TE>   Tubb described Bush as an inquisitive patient. ''He wants to know
exactly what's going to transpire and afterward,'' the doctor said.
He also said Bush joked about the procedure and expressed a desire to
return to a normal diet. He was required to restrict his intake
before the procedure.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's transfer of power was only the second time in U.S.
history that the 25th Amendment to the Constitution has been invoked.
The first time was on July 13, 1985, when then-President Reagan
underwent colon cancer surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Tubb and Fleischer took the opportunity Saturday to urge Americans
older than 50 to have a colonoscopy. The procedure, they said, should
be repeated in 10 years, in the absence of abnormalities.</TE>

<HD>Rumblings in Vermont of a Run for White House</HD>
<DH>Presidency: Gov. Dean is the first Democrat to act. But his
name recognition in nation is near zero.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The first Democrat to form an official presidential committee for
2004 has a resume many candidates would envy.</LD>
<LD>   The 53-year-old five-term governor is a "common-sense moderate"
who boasts on his Web site that "social justice can only be
accomplished through strong financial management"--fiscal
conservatism. He is a physician who championed universal health care
for all under age 18 in his home state. He is married to a physician
and has two photogenic kids. He also has an "A" rating from the
National Rifle Assn. and a pedigree every bit as patrician as George
W. Bush's.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately for a man seeking the presidency, almost no one has
heard of Howard Dean. And he comes from a state whose population is
smaller than that of several California counties.</LD>
<TE>   Recently, on one of the half-dozen exploratory trips he has made
to Iowa since January, he was asked, "What have you done for the
women of Connecticut?"</TE>
<TE>   Politely, Dean replied, "It's Vermont."</TE>
<TE>   By telephone from Waterloo, Iowa, where he pursued his strategy of
meeting with small groups such as town councils and women's
organizations, Dean acknowledged that no president has ever claimed
Vermont as home. Calvin Coolidge and Chester A. Arthur were both born
in the Green Mountain State but left before high school, and in 1880,
John Wolcott Phelps of Guilford, Vt., earned 707 votes nationally in
an American Party bid for the presidency.</TE>
<TE>   On fat census days, Vermont inflates its population to 650,000.
The state's one congressman, Bernard Sanders, is one of only two
independents in the House of Representatives. Despite Dean's efforts
to tout Vermont as a bastion of innovative social policy, the state
is best known for miserable winters and homemade merchandise: Vermont
Teddy Bears, Green Mountain Coffee and, of course, Ben &amp; Jerry's ice
cream.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many people who believe Vermont is a town in New
Hampshire," said Garrison Nelson, a professor of political science at
the University of Vermont. "People think the whole state's cute.
Howard's cute too."</TE>
<TE>   But from Washington, Democratic political consultant Tad Devine
said Dean's strengths may overshadow his obscurity.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a governor, and he's also a physician. At a time when health
care is such an important issue, his ability to talk about it from
the stance of achievement is very much in his favor," said Devine,
who managed former Vice President Al Gore's 2000 presidential race.</TE>
<TE>   For Dean, Devine said, "the real litmus test will be whether he
can raise financial support to compete. I don't think we know the
answer to that." As for Dean's chances in a field of Democrats that
may include Sens. John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, Joseph I. Lieberman
of Connecticut, John Edwards of North Carolina as well as House
Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and, perhaps, Gore,
Devine said: "It's very hard to say right now. But if no one else
runs, his chances are extraordinary."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes Dean is known as "the Yankee Jimmy Carter," and
sometimes he is likened to Harry S. Truman--a governor who enjoys
bucking the tide. But he also shares qualities with George W. Bush,
starting with a privileged background. Dean's blueblood runs so
thick, in fact, that Bush's grandmother was a bridesmaid at Dean's
grandmother's wedding.</TE>
<TE>   Dean was raised in East Hampton, N.Y., as a stockbroker's son. He
attended the Browning School in Manhattan, St. George's for prep
school and that well-known incubator of chief executives, Yale
University. Briefly, Dean tried his own hand at high finance. But
Wall Street was not for him, and he headed to medical school. There
he met his wife, Judith Steinberg. Together they moved to Vermont and
set up a family medical practice outside Burlington.</TE>
<TE>   In a staunchly Republican state, Dean soon thrust himself into
Democratic politics. He was elected to the state Legislature (where
his nickname was HoHo) in 1983, he became lieutenant governor three
years later. In 1991, Gov. Richard Snelling died in office. Dean was
examining a patient at his medical office when he got the news. He
finished the exam and drove to Montpelier.</TE>
<TE>   As governor, Dean has focused on jobs, education and, most of all,
health care. He put into effect one of the nation's most sweeping
mental health programs. He also signed a bill that made Vermont the
first state to legalize same-sex partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Dean also became chairman of the National Governors' Assn., as
well as the Democratic Governors' Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "He is handsome, he conducts himself well and he is smart. I don't
think he is smart enough, but as politicians go, he is smart," said
John McClaughry, who was "obliterated" by Dean when both ran for
lieutenant governor.</TE>
<TE>   "He has had a charmed political career and a charmed decade to be
governor in," said McClaughry, president of a "free-market think
tank" called the Ethan Allen Institute in Kirby, Vt.</TE>
<TE>   McClaughry suggested Dean launched his presidential bid because
"he's in the prime of life and he has exhausted his opportunities
around here." Unless Dean waits to run against independent Sen. James
M. Jeffords in 2006, "there's nothing here for Howard except going
back to the clinic," McClaughry said.</TE>
<TE>   "And he's not looking forward to going back to looking down
people's throats."</TE>
<TE>   But Dean sounded positively New Frontierish when he explained his
motivation for seeking the presidency.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the country is fundamentally going in the wrong
direction. I think the fiscal management of the country is a
disaster--we're right back to the borrow-and-spend politics of the
1980s," he said. "I also want health care for every single American."</TE>
<TE>   As to why he should be the one to make these changes, Dean said,
"Somebody has to do it. This country didn't get to be a great country
by letting someone else do it."</TE>
<TE>   His "Dean for America" presidential committee consists of a
treasurer, one paid college student, one unpaid college student and a
volunteer he is waiting to hear from. He is not rolling in political
dough. But Dean is at least piling up frequent-flier miles, last week
heading, for example, from Vermont to Iowa and back, then to Buffalo,
N.Y., then to Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Fowler, a professor of government at Dartmouth College, said
the front-loaded primary schedule could work against "a Jimmy
Carter-style candidate who comes out of the woodwork"--or, in Dean's
case, the backwoods.</TE>
<TE>   "If you were being smart, you would look at it and say no way,"
Fowler said. "That said, nobody predicted that George Bush Sr.'s
popularity would fall into the cellar in 1992, but it did. If I were
a betting woman, I would say no to Howard Dean's chances, but I would
not have predicted that Bill Clinton was going to be our president,
either."</TE>
<TE>   Nelson, a longtime antagonist of the governor, at first dismissed
Dean as "a twerp." But in the course of a long interview, he
concluded: "Basically, I have underestimated this man for 20 years,
and I have been wrong most of the time.</TE>
<TE>   "Howard is the master of good timing, and lightning may just
strike Howard this time."</TE>

<HD>Fireworks This 4th Are Put Out by Fears</HD>
<DH>Safety: Dry conditions have led Wyoming, Colorado and Utah
to ban traditional Fourth of July shows. Some opt for laser lights
instead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIANNE HART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The old railroad town of Como, Colo., usually celebrates the Fourth
of July with a bang: 30 minutes of elaborate fireworks, screeching,
high-flying shells and cascading showers of red, white and blue stars
that attract hundreds from nearby communities.</LD>
<LD>   This year, not only in Como but across the scorched and burning
West, authorities are canceling fireworks displays, fearing that an
errant spark could lead to catastrophe.</LD>
<LD>   "Our town is more important than fireworks," said Stan Miller,
president of the Como Civic Assn. "It's not worth the risk."</LD>
<TE>   In post-Sept. 11 America, Independence Day will have special
meaning, said Adrian Hise, chief fire marshal of Boulder, Colo. But
fireworks aren't the only way to express national pride.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a different world we're living in this summer," he said.
"The drought is the way it is, and I think people are adjusting to
that fact."</TE>
<TE>   Tinderbox conditions have led the governors of Wyoming, Colorado
and Utah to ban fireworks on all state land, including parks and
recreation areas.</TE>
<TE>   "We are one Roman candle away from a nightmarish inferno," said
Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt as he announced a fireworks ban Wednesday on
4.1 million acres of public land.</TE>
<TE>   State officials generally don't have the power to prohibit
fireworks in municipalities. But local authorities are quickly
enacting their own bans. At least 35 of New Mexico's 102 incorporated
towns have imposed some kind of fireworks restriction. The New Mexico
state forester predicted the danger as early as May, when he banned
fireworks on 43 million acres of public land.</TE>
<TE>   Still, competing laws make compliance difficult to enforce. In
Arizona and seven other states, fireworks are illegal except when
handled by a licensed pyrotechnic company. But people who drive
across state lines can get their hands on a slew of sparklers, Black
Cat firecrackers and smoke bombs, said Jim Wheeler, Flagstaff's
assistant fire chief.</TE>
<TE>   "All they have to do is drive to one of our four neighboring
states. Those are the people who start fires, and they are hard to
monitor," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wildfires are such a concern in Colorado that even fireworks shows
over water have been called off. In the Rocky Mountain town of
Frisco, the Independence Day display is one of the area's most
reliable draws, attracting 15,000 people every year. Although the
shells explode over Lake Dillon and there is a 2,000-foot safety zone
between the water and Arapahoe National Forest, the town canceled the
party. "One little spark might blow into the forest, and you just
don't know what could happen," said spokeswoman Linda Lichtendahl.
"It's a decision based on safety."</TE>
<TE>   The Flagstaff Fire Department had safety in mind when it organized
a fireworks extravaganza. Its plan called for a launch site on a golf
driving range bordered by five Little League baseball fields. "It's
all dirt with nothing combustible," Wheeler said. "It's 100% safe
from a fire safety perspective."</TE>
<TE>   Still, residents flooded the department with calls, and the city
canceled the show.</TE>
<TE>   "When real large wildfires are breaking out, there's an
overpowering emotional reaction," Wheeler said. "The decision to
cancel wasn't based on fire science, it was based on social science
and the need to assure that our residents felt comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   Residents are less jittery in California, where Jim Souza,
president of a Rialto pyrotechnic company, said only one of its 500
Fourth of July shows had been called off by a community fearful of
dry conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Towns that can afford it are turning to laser-light shows instead
of fireworks. Seattle-based Laser Fantasy International has had so
many calls, especially from Colorado, that it turned away business,
said sales Vice President Rikki Rothenberg-Klein.</TE>
<TE>   Helena, Mont.; Sonora, Calif.; and Boulder are among the towns
paying $15,000 to $25,000 for a 30-minute spectacle of multicolored
laser beams projecting images of flags, stars and eagles to the beat
of patriotic music.</TE>
<TE>   "It won't be fireworks, but at least it's safe," said Hise,
Boulder's fire marshal.</TE>
<TE>   The folks in Como, population 29, can't afford a fire hydrant,
much less a laser-light show. But when night falls on Independence
Day, Stan Miller will pull out the lawn chairs as he always does. The
American flag will hang from a pole in the frontyard. And he'll
settle back and watch the twinkling stars and the glowing beauty of
the quarter moon.</TE>
<TE>   "That'll be a show in itself," Miller said. "It'll be a good
Fourth of July."</TE>

<HD>He'd Shed Shackles Next Time, Gore Says</HD>
<DH>Politics: He tells key backers he'd 'let it rip.' He also
edges closer to declaring for 2004.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEMPHIS, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>With a select audience of still-loyal financial donors and political
partisans cheering him on, Al Gore declared Saturday that if he ran
again for president, he would shed the constraints of polls, tactics
and consultants that hobbled his 2000 campaign and "let it rip."</LD>
<LD>   The former vice president's closed-door meeting here with several
dozen key backers, an event staged in part as a show of strength to
other potential Democratic contenders, edged him further toward a
declaration that he wants a rematch with President Bush in 2004.</LD>
<LD>   While Gore remains officially uncommitted (he promises a decision
after the November congressional elections), his wife, Tipper, now
says she would wholeheartedly support another run for the White
House, squelching rumors about her reluctance. His daughter Karenna,
also appearing here, said in even stronger terms that she wants him
to go for it.</LD>
<TE>   But first Gore must prove to many skeptical Democrats in
Washington and across the country that he would be the party's best
hope against a president who has gained considerable stature and
popularity since winning the disputed 2000 election.</TE>
<TE>   Modern political history suggests Gore's challenge: No defeated
nominee of a major party has captured the party's nomination in the
next presidential election since 1952 candidate Adlai Stevenson
prevailed in the Democratic convention of 1956. Stevenson, moreover,
suffered a crushing loss in his rematch with President Eisenhower.</TE>
<TE>   Gore partisans say his agonizingly close defeat in 2000--winning
the popular vote but losing the Electoral College--indicates that he
has the standing to unseat the incumbent, assuming Bush seeks
reelection.</TE>
<TE>   And so about 95 of them gathered here in Gore's home state of
Tennessee to hear the former vice president's post-mortem of 2000 and
to rally behind him for what appears to be the beginnings of another
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had it to do all over again, I'd just let it rip," Gore
said, according to an aide and others in the room. "To hell with the
polls, tactics and all the rest." The crowd leapt to its feet and
cheered. It remains to be seen whether Democrats nationwide will do
the same.</TE>
<TE>   Many donors and Washington-based party operatives are helping
other contenders, such as Sens. John F. Kerry of Massachusetts and
John Edwards of North Carolina. Rep. Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), the
House minority leader, has his own national network and looks ready
to run. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), the nation's
highest-ranking elected Democrat, is considering a campaign. Gore's
2000 running mate, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, is
gearing up to go for the White House if Gore doesn't (or perhaps if
he does). And Vermont Gov. Howard Dean has thrown his hat into the
ring.</TE>
<TE>   Downplaying the Gore event, one top aide to a possible Democratic
candidate said: "One weekend retreat does not solve your problems.
It's about your long-term relations with donors and their belief in
your political viability."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Gore must battle the perception that if he runs, he would
be a vulnerable front-runner in a hotly contested Democratic primary.
"There is not the brand loyalty to Gore that there once was," said
Larry J. Sabato, a University of Virginia political analyst. "It has
faded dramatically."</TE>
<TE>   The meeting's locale, in the Peabody Hotel in downtown Memphis,
also underscored Gore's challenge. He lost his home state in 2000.
Just across the Mississippi River lies Arkansas, another state that
slipped from his grasp. If either had gone for Gore--as they did for
Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996--he would now be president. In part to
reestablish his home base, Gore has taught courses at universities in
the state, while he and his wife just closed on a $2.3-million home
near Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   For all his potential liabilities, some observers say Gore still
has the strongest shot at the Democratic nomination. "To take it away
from him," said Charles Cook, a Washington political analyst,
"somebody's going to have to be very, very good."</TE>
<TE>   The loyalists gathered here acknowledged their party is split. "My
sense is, inside the Beltway, the network there is more of the
opinion 'Anybody but Gore,' " said Alvaro Cifuentes, chairman of the
Hispanic Caucus of the Democratic National Committee. "But outside
the Beltway, the sense is, 'If Gore wants it, we'll go with him.' "</TE>
<TE>   Without exception, those interviewed here said they would back
another Gore candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   "Every single person in that room is hoping that Al Gore runs,"
Chris Korge, a Miami attorney and party fund-raiser, told reporters
after the former vice president spoke to supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Said Ramesh Kapur, a fund-raiser from Massachusetts: "Al Gore is
running. I think he should run. The country needs him."</TE>
<TE>   Karenna Gore Schiff, who with her mother signaled the family's
sentiment, said her father would be the best man in the White House
now. "It makes your heart sick about what he could do if he were in
that job," she told reporters. "And it makes me think he should go
for it again."</TE>
<TE>   Gore, who virtually disappeared after conceding in 2000 to Bush,
has stepped up his criticism of the president this year during a
carefully planned reemergence on the political stage. On Earth Day in
April, he delivered a blistering attack on Bush's environmental
policies. Recently he condemned the administration for allowing a
photograph of the president aboard Air Force One, taken just after
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, to be used for Republican
fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   In a speech Saturday night to local Democrats, Gore attacked
Bush's economic policies as "a total catastrophe." He also noted that
in the war on terrorism, the U.S. has yet to catch Al Qaeda leader
Osama bin Laden, and he denounced the White House for "trying to use
the war for political purposes."</TE>
<TE>   But one loyalist here advised caution, despite Gore's vow to "let
it rip." Rep. Harold Ford Jr. (D-Tenn.) told reporters that a
successful campaign would have to offer "not just criticisms" of the
Bush administration "but solutions."</TE>

<HD>As Fires Heat Up, Spokesman Stays Cool</HD>
<DH>Wildfires: Jim Paxon of the U.S. Forest Service has gained
a measure of fame telling it like it is.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHOW LOW, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>For more than a week, the news has been dreadful. The nation's most
destructive forest fire has been roaring through canyons and into
wooded subdivisions and small mountain communities, incinerating more
than 400 homes and forcing 30,000 people to flee.</LD>
<LD>   Those stricken by the grim news said that at least they found some
comfort in hearing it from Jim Paxon, the Texan with the brush
mustache who lays out the facts bluntly, sometimes with a lyrical
twist, as a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service.</LD>
<LD>   "He's terrific. He tells you exactly how it is," said Steve
Splawm, 79, of Summer Pines, who took refuge at the Red Cross
evacuation center in nearby Holbrook. On news programs, he and more
than 100 others sit in front of two large TVs for Paxon's briefings.
"He uses plain language and doesn't sugar-coat anything," Splawm
said.</LD>
<TE>   Like the time Paxon reported, "We got beat up real bad today," and
later in the week, "I don't mean to be vulgar, but the fire kicked
our butts today."</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Waelrock, 56, of Overgaard, said he appreciated Paxon "for
his ability at storytelling."</TE>
<TE>   Like Paxon's explanation of how an inversion layer cooled the
fire: "Today was a good day for firefighters. The reason was, if
we're in a kitchen and we're cooking, we've got bacon grease in a
skillet, and that bacon grease catches fire. If we put the lid on
that skillet, it suppresses the fire. It puts it out. This inversion
that we had over us all day today essentially was the lid on the
skillet."</TE>
<TE>   Everyone loves Paxon, from reporters looking for good quotes and
sound bites to residents wanting the straight scoop. At Round Valley
High School in nearby Eagar, messages written to firefighters on a
wall around the football stadium included this one: "Paxon for
president."</TE>
<TE>   His value to the Forest Service as a translator of technical news
for common folk was recognized in 1988, when he was helping fight
several fires in the Yellowstone National Park region that burned
more than 3 million acres of public and private land.</TE>
<TE>   "I was out there trying to keep up with the young ones for 31
days," he said, "and that's a long time for an old [guy].</TE>
<TE>   "Someone said to me, 'You know, you talk pretty good, and you're
getting old and fat. Why don't you become an information officer?' "</TE>
<TE>   Every summer since, he has been pressed into service as a fire
information officer.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the 54-year-old Paxon spends most of his time as a district
ranger in Gila National Forest at Truth or Consequences, N.M., where
he oversees a staff of 50 full-time employees, 30 seasonal ones and
552,800 acres of forest.</TE>
<TE>   But during fire season, Paxon turns gypsy, assigned to a fire
incident commander and his staff as they travel from one large fire
to the next. Newly married, he has delayed his honeymoon until fall.</TE>
<TE>   Forest Service officials cringe when one of their spokesmen is
singled out, but the government accepts that Paxon is a favorite
among the national media. Paxon starts his day at 4 a.m. with live
interviews for East Coast network news shows and wraps up local
interviews at 10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "He's phenomenal because he's been an actual firefighter and can
translate that job in common words so people can understand," said
George Lennon, the Forest Service's communications director in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Paxon said he's not looking for fame. "I'm just a talking head,
and it's important to present an image of firefighters that people
can understand."</TE>
<TE>   Paxon said he resists the temptation to be too upbeat or overly
glum about a fire's danger when homes and lives are at stake. He
decided long ago to let the facts speak for themselves. "My
granddaddy told me to stick to the truth, because it's the only thing
you don't have to keep track of."</TE>
<TE>   Paxon grew up in farm country around Lubbock, Texas, and in
college studied animal and range science. He and his buddies fled the
flatlands for a week's vacation in the mountainous Pecos Wilderness
near Santa Fe, N.M., and he grew smitten by trees. He joined the
Forest Service as a firefighter in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   By 1981 he was promoted to district ranger and became a forest
land manager, but during fire seasons still traveled the country as a
fire crew boss. After becoming a spokesman, Paxon learned over and
again how tricky the job can be.</TE>
<TE>   During the Los Alamos, N.M., wildfire in 2000 that spread from a
prescribed burn, "I told reporters we were doing really well on the
fire. When we stepped out of the briefing tent, 60 mph winds kicked
up. Within four hours, the fire had grown from 11,000 acres to
38,000, and it burned more than 600 housing units."</TE>
<TE>   Such unpredictability triggers one of Paxon's favorite lines: "You
know, when you try to say what Mother Nature's going to do, she makes
you a liar."</TE>
<TE>   He has alternately described the Rodeo-Chediski fire as a
"multiheaded monster" and "fire-breathing dragon." He justified the
437,000-acre fire's intensity: "Mother Nature can't stand all the
congestion in the forest, so she's going to start over."</TE>
<TE>   And when the fire stalled in its march toward Show Low, Paxon
explained: "Either the monster was napping and never reared its head
or the good Lord blessed us today."</TE>
<TE>   But ultimately, Paxon said, "fires are won and lost by
firefighters. They're the foot soldiers, the ditch diggers."</TE>

<HD>Taking a Bit of Pious Pleasure in Pledge of Allegiance
Ruling</HD>
<DH>Atheism: Wisconsin group works to make voice of the
'unbeliever' heard in public forum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MADISON, Wis.</DL>
<LD>The very name provokes: the Freedom From Religion Foundation.</LD>
<LD>   If that's not in-your-face enough, try its publications, perhaps
the Atheist Cookbook with recipes like "Chicken Salad With No
Religious Nuts," or the CD "Your Friendly Neighborhood Atheist,"
featuring gospel tunes with Bible-mocking lyrics. Or how about the
bumper sticker proclaiming: "Nothing Fails Like Prayer."</LD>
<LD>   If it sounds outrageous, that is precisely the point. The three
atheists who run the 5,000-member Freedom From Religion Foundation
here are determined to make the "unbeliever" voice heard loud and
clear in public discourse. They want to elbow a place for themselves
in a society that seems ever more determined to push them out.</LD>
<TE>   This may be their big moment.</TE>
<TE>   Since a panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals declared
the Pledge of Allegiance's "under God" phrase unconstitutional last
week, the three phone lines in the group's Freethinker Hall have been
humming.</TE>
<TE>   The trio has received the predictable hateful calls. But calls of
support also have poured in from atheists delighted to see their
perspective reflected in the court's ruling. About 14% of Americans
classify themselves as nonbelievers--up from 8% a decade ago--and
foundation staffers sense the community is raring for more court
challenges.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been fun," said Annie Laurie Gaylor, editor of the group's
monthly newspaper, Freethought Today.</TE>
<TE>   The Freedom From Religion Foundation was not behind the Pledge of
Allegiance lawsuit. But its attorney did advise the plaintiff. And
the nonprofit organization has for 24 years been filing similar
suits--fighting to pull Ten Commandments plaques from public
property, to revoke Good Friday as an official holiday, to remove "In
God we trust" from the nation's currency.</TE>
<TE>   On a budget of $430,000 a year, most of it from donations, the
foundation strives to protect atheists' rights to attend public
school or to play in public parks without confronting references to a
god they do not believe exists.</TE>
<TE>   Many of their most ambitious lawsuits are tossed out. But the
foundation's staff regards failures as victories if they drum up
publicity, if they get people thinking about prying church from
state.</TE>
<TE>   And the foundation does prevail in some major cases. This year the
group won a federal court decision declaring that government could
not fund social service agencies that indoctrinate their clients in
religious faith. And in Tennessee, a federal judge banned the Bible
class that had been taught weekly in three public elementary schools
for 51 years.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation staff sees the pledge case as the most exciting
triumph of all, because it sparked such ferocious outrage.</TE>
<TE>   Anne Gaylor, the 75-year-old founder of the group, said she was
"nauseated" by the sight of so many U.S. senators reciting allegiance
to the flag on the Capitol steps. Her daughter, Annie Laurie, called
the display "the ultimate political pandering."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the Gaylors are confident the Senate's piety will backfire.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of "under God" in the pledge often insist it's not a
religious reference, just an acknowledgment that the nation is
united. "But when you see senators out there saying we need God to
defend us, we need God on our side, that underscores the fact that
this is a religious issue. They're making our case for us," said Dan
Barker, the foundation's communications director.</TE>
<TE>   Annie Laurie Gaylor says she hopes reaction to the ruling will
expose "the mini-McCarthy era we have going now," in which
invocations of God are held up as a test of patriotism. "The secular
force in this nation hasn't really been mobilized yet, and I see a
great deal of potential."</TE>
<TE>   That worries some conservative critics, who say the foundation is
distorting the Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   "The 1st Amendment is intended to guarantee freedom of religion,
not freedom from religion," said Ken Connor of the Family Research
Council, an advocacy group. "You are not required to believe in God.
But we're also not required to let the most hypersensitive among us
set a lowest common denominator for public life."</TE>
<TE>   Others, while skeptical of the foundation's aim, laud it for
giving voice to a sizable--but often silent--minority. "Do I think
God should be eradicated from society? No," said John Whitehead,
president of the Rutherford Institute, a conservative legal group.
"But they raise legitimate issues."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, it's not the only group raising such issues. Americans
United for Separation of Church and State is a far more influential
nonprofit with 60,000 members, including religious leaders of several
faiths. The American Civil Liberties Union also presses the cause.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1978, the foundation distinguishes itself by its
emphasis on improving public tolerance for atheists. Thanks in part
to the Gaylors' reflective tone, "the stereotype of a grouchy,
extremely aggressive atheist has faded away," said Robert Boston of
Americans United for the Separation of Church and State.</TE>
<TE>   Atheists say such image-polishing continues to be an important
mission, now more than ever.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, "we have been inundated with the idea that
religiosity equals patriotism," said Elizabeth Blackwell, 82, a
foundation supporter from La Canada Flintridge. "If I stood on my
lawn and shouted, 'I am an atheist! I am an atheist!' sooner or
later, someone would throw a rock at me."</TE>

<HD>Evacuees Return Home-- or to Where Homes Were</HD>
<DH>Fire: Some find things just the way they left them. Others
find only the smoldering remains.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHOW LOW, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>More than a week after they were evacuated under the umber haze of
the largest forest fire in Arizona history, residents in this and
several neighboring communities were allowed back to their homes
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Most returned to find things almost exactly as they had left them
when they fled: a paper on the front porch, the garage door open and
the lawn half-mowed.</LD>
<LD>   Others returned to find that almost everything had changed.</LD>
<TE>   "Well, here's part of Jean's recliner," said Floyd Stapley, 71, as
he pointed into the smoldering maw that was his and wife Jean's
two-story log home in Pinedale. "That there, that's the soundboard
for our piano."</TE>
<TE>   The couple had gotten out with some photos, clothes, a camping
trailer and Jean Stapley's wedding dress, last worn 53 years ago. The
couple lost pretty much everything else, from the custom leather coat
he bought when they were Mormon missionaries in Belize to the carved
hardwood figures she had acquired when they were missionaries in
Tonga.</TE>
<TE>   With an optimism forged by time, tribulation and nine now-grown
children, the Stapleys--unlike some of their kids--sifted through the
ashes without crying Saturday. And when Floyd managed to fire up his
1953 Massey-Ferguson farm tractor, which was charred and twisted with
four melted tires, he let out a ringing "Wheehaw!"</TE>
<TE>   While about 25,000 of the 30,000 residents who were evacuated from
Show Low and other towns on the east side of the blaze began
returning Saturday, thousands of others were kept away, mostly those
from the north and west sides of the 437,000-acre Rodeo-Chediski
fire, which continued to rage in places.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of Heber-Overgaard, where more than 200 homes have been
destroyed, were told they would have to wait at least another day,
and probably longer.</TE>
<TE>   More than 4,500 firefighters, several hundred tanker trucks and
other vehicles, and nearly two dozen aircraft continued to battle the
fire Saturday. The most precarious site now is Forest Lakes, a town
40 miles west of here.</TE>
<TE>   More than 600 homes in Forest Lakes were considered threatened,
though firefighters successfully protected the hilltop community for
the third night in a row and by Saturday evening had gained
considerable confidence in their ever-widening fire lines.</TE>
<TE>   Although just 10% of the fire was contained by Saturday night,
officials were hopeful that figure could grow considerably today and
Monday. Some fire lines have been dug around the majority of the
200-mile perimeter of the fire and needed only to be expanded.</TE>
<TE>   Relatively calm winds and slightly cooler temperatures, in the
mid-80s to mid-90s, aided firefighters Saturday, and U.S. Forest
Service officials were talking as much about forest rehabilitation as
firefighting.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time since the fire began, though, Saturday was
primarily a day of homecoming, whether the homes were still there or
not.</TE>
<TE>   Word began leaking out overnight that the numerous police
barricades outside the city would come down, and by early morning
evacuees began trickling into town, some having to tell uninformed
guards that the town was indeed open. By afternoon, cars streamed
from evacuee centers in the east into town.</TE>
<TE>   Some vehicles were packed to the rails or windows with belongings.
Most, though, returned with just a few changes of clothes and some
photo albums, the telltale signs of a hasty exit.</TE>
<TE>   As the lucky settled in to their still-standing homes, the
evacuation and ensuing lock-down of the town emerged as a topic of
considerable concern.</TE>
<TE>   For more than a week, Show Low and surrounding communities had
been under what Navajo County Sheriff Gary Butler, in an interview,
agreed was "martial law, if you want to call it that."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone other than firefighters or law enforcement personnel seen
driving around, even if this was their own town, was considered a
burglary suspect and taken into custody.</TE>
<TE>   More than 30 people were arrested, Butler said. The sheriff, who
drives an unmarked sedan, was himself pulled over twice, he said,
chuckling.</TE>
<TE>   Others were arrested for failing to evacuate, some charged with
endangering the lives of the officers trying to get them to go.
Butler and three deputies took one man into custody as the flames
approached.</TE>
<TE>   "He says, 'I have the right to stay here and die,' " Butler said.
"I said, 'Not in my county you don't.' "</TE>
<TE>   Outside Pinedale, two members of the Cheney family hunkered down
to ride out the fire after evacuating the rest of the family. The
Cheneys own a company that provides water to several municipalities
and also helps fire departments tap into water supplies. The
patriarch, Jon, 45, and son Ben, 20, stayed and were working hard.</TE>
<TE>   With their home protected on the south side by a meadow of short
grass rather than tall pines, the father-son duo were assembling a
part that would allow Pinedale tanker trucks to siphon water from a
well.</TE>
<TE>   Several hundred elk had gathered in the meadow for protection as
the Cheneys--carrying Pinedale Fire Department credentials--toiled
away, Ben Cheney said.</TE>
<TE>   Just as flames passed within 30 yards of the house, four sheriff's
deputies appeared through a wall of fire, ordering the two to
evacuate. When Jon Cheney declined, they arrested him. His son then
agreed to come along.</TE>
<TE>   "The firefighters, we had great cooperation with them," the
younger Cheney said. "The sheriff's department was out of control.
It's almost like they were a law unto themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Show Low Police Officer Jason Spear, 25, defended the policy.
Married five years, with a 7-month-old baby, he and his wife lost
their home last week. Ever since, he has worked 12 to 16 hours a day,
taking time only once to see what was left of their home: piles of
ashes and a red gas can, still full.</TE>
<TE>   "It wouldn't have been fair to take time off. I still had a job to
do," Spear said tearfully. "What happened had already happened. I
can't change that. But maybe I can save someone else's place in the
future."</TE>
<TE>   Like everyone else, the media also have been heavily restricted.
Last week, the Forest Service issued a six-page "protocol" that said
reporters could travel from the fire base at Show Low High School to
their motels and to the Kmart. And that was about it. "You are not
immune from prosecution," the final page warned.</TE>
<TE>   The primary reason for the strict regulations was to ward off
looters--an effort everyone seemed to find worthy. A secondary
reason, authorities said, was to prevent evacuated families from
learning on the 5 o'clock news that their homes had burned down.</TE>
<TE>   The problem was that evacuees, having lived in shelters and tents
and other people's homes for more than a week, wanted only one thing
more than to return: news, be it good or bad.</TE>
<TE>   When a local television station last week ran a story reporting
widespread looting here, panic swept through the evacuee communities
in Eager and Springerville, both about 40 miles east. Law enforcement
officials denied the report. But no one really knew.</TE>
<TE>   "That's been the hardest part, for us and everyone else: not
knowing," said Gary Dinger, 54, who, along with his wife, Carolyn,
has been living at Eager High School. "We heard we'd been robbed.
Then we heard we hadn't. We heard our house was OK. Then we heard it
wasn't. We don't know."</TE>
<TE>   The Dingers' neighborhood in nearby Linden still was closed off
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The Stapleys learned Thursday, via a photograph on a maverick
Internet site, that they had lost their home. They didn't learn until
Saturday that they'd also lost several cabins belonging to their
extended family.</TE>
<TE>   But, Floyd Stapley said, knowing their home was gone was better
than wondering if it was.</TE>
<TE>   If the glitches, hard feelings and most notably, considerable
loss, were topics of the day, so was overwhelming joy and relief.</TE>
<TE>   At a home on the south side of Show Low, a car drove slowly toward
a yellow-and-white home Saturday afternoon. Fire had burned the
ponderosa pines all around, part of a nearby fence and most of an
adjacent field.</TE>
<TE>   A man and woman got out of the green car and slowly approached the
house. There was not a fire scar on it. They hugged and kissed, and
then went inside.</TE>

<HD>Hidden Risks, Lethal Truths</HD>
<DH>Warner-Lambert won approval for Rezulin after masking the
scope of liver injuries in clinical studies</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Newly obtained internal documents show that Warner-Lambert Co.
executives who promoted the diabetes pill Rezulin masked from federal
regulators early indications of the drug's danger to the liver and
later delayed sharing information about its lethal toxicity with
family doctors.</LD>
<LD>   The newly acquired materials show that company management rebuffed
employees who questioned liver-injury totals from clinical studies
that excluded 38% of the cases. At the time, Warner-Lambert was
assuring doctors nationwide that the drug was as safe as a placebo,
the harmless pill used as a control in medical testing.</LD>
<LD>   The story of the Food and Drug Administration's handling of
Rezulin is well known. After the agency gave the drug "fast-track"
approval in early 1997, scores of liver-related deaths were linked to
the pill. Rezulin was withdrawn from the U.S. market in March 2000.
By then, it had generated $2.1 billion in sales for Warner-Lambert.</LD>
<TE>   But only now is a picture emerging of Warner-Lambert's actions,
showing how a major drug maker can obscure risks and then win
blockbuster sales. Pfizer Inc., which acquired Warner-Lambert in
mid-2000, has turned over voluminous documents to plaintiffs' lawyers
in response to more than 2,000 lawsuits filed on behalf of
approximately 5,100 Rezulin users or their survivors. Many of the
materials have been kept out of public view by judges' orders. The
Times obtained copies of the materials, along with transcripts of
recent sworn statements by company executives and others.</TE>
<TE>   One of the central figures in the documents is Dr. Randall W.
Whitcomb, Warner-Lambert's vice president for diabetes research.
Without telling the FDA, Whitcomb used an unorthodox method to count
the number of liver injuries among patients who used Rezulin while
using different criteria to count liver injuries among patients
taking a placebo. The result trimmed the number of cases the company
reported to the regulators and to doctors nationwide, giving a more
benign view of the drug's risks.</TE>
<TE>   Pfizer said in a recent financial statement that a federal grand
jury based in Greenbelt, Md., has sought documents and the sworn
testimony of certain former Warner-Lambert employees regarding
Rezulin.</TE>
<TE>   "We are cooperating with this investigation," Pfizer said in the
financial report, filed March 28 with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The investigation is being led by the U.S. attorney's
office in Greenbelt and by agents from the FDA's Office of Criminal
Investigations.</TE>
<TE>   It is a crime in the U.S. to deliberately conceal an important
fact about the safety of a prescription drug.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Pfizer, Robert J. Fauteux, said in a written
statement that his company "believes that, in developing Rezulin,
Warner-Lambert made a valuable contribution to the effort to control
diabetes." Fauteux also said that, in Pfizer's view, the product
labeling for Rezulin and other warnings, approved by the FDA,
"appropriately communicated the risks associated with the medication,
including the risk of liver injury."</TE>
<TE>   Rezulin, he said, "offered an innovative treatment option to
nearly 2 million patients." Citing the pending civil lawsuits,
Fauteux declined to respond to specific questions posed by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   The newly obtained materials also reveal that:</TE>
<TE>   * Company representatives discussed in 1998 how best to persuade
doctors treating Latinos "to take the risk of prescribing Rezulin."
The same internal company document described the Latino patients as
"easy to intimidate."</TE>
<TE>   * When an Arcadia woman, Rosa Delia Valenzuela, suffered liver
failure and died in December 1998 while taking the drug in a
Warner-Lambert study, company representatives argued against promptly
alerting the hundreds of doctors nationwide who continued to conduct
the research on more than 2,000 other patients.</TE>
<TE>   * As the deaths of U.S. patients mounted, Warner-Lambert offered
to--and did--reimburse doctors if they got sued for prescribing
Rezulin. The American Medical Assn. has warned doctors against such
reimbursements, terming them "unacceptable gifts."</TE>
<TE>   The FDA now attributes 94 liver failures, 66 of them fatal, to
Rezulin. A review by The Times of reports filed with the FDA found
that Rezulin was cited by doctors and others as a suspect in 556
deaths, including but not limited to the liver failures. Because
reactions to prescription drugs are reported voluntarily in the U.S.,
epidemiologists suspect that as few as 1% to 10% of the actual events
are made known to the FDA.</TE>
<TE>   The hospitalizations and deaths stand in contrast to the benefits
offered by Rezulin. The drug lowered blood-sugar levels but was not
proved to offer any benefits that would either save a patient's life
or reduce the serious complications of adult-onset diabetes,
including stroke, amputation or blindness.</TE>
<TE>   People with adult-onset, or Type 2, diabetes typically can lower
their blood sugar with diet or exercise, oral medications, or
insulin. The disease is distinguished from juvenile-onset, Type 1
diabetes, which kills patients unless they receive daily infusions of
insulin.</TE>
<TE>   A Perfect Champion for Diabetes Drug</TE>
<TE>   Earnest but affable, scientific yet plain-spoken, Randy Whitcomb
proved the perfect promoter for Rezulin.</TE>
<TE>   Whitcomb graduated from medical school at the University of Kansas
in 1981 and worked at the National Institutes of Health and at
Harvard Medical School before joining Warner-Lambert's Parke-Davis
drug unit in 1992. The next year, he took charge of shepherding
Rezulin to market.</TE>
<TE>   Whitcomb's presentation to an FDA advisory committee on Dec. 11,
1996, marked a watershed for the drug: If he could help persuade the
committee to endorse Rezulin, the agency staff, in all likelihood,
would approve it.</TE>
<TE>   Whitcomb provided the panel a seamless summary:</TE>
<TE>   He told the advisors that clinical studies had proved Rezulin to
be remarkably safe for the liver, in his words, "comparable to
placebo." Whitcomb said only 1.1% of the study patients treated with
Rezulin had detectable liver injury. He assured the committee that
additional liver-related data that he had examined from the clinical
studies, to be furnished within days to the FDA staff, were "very,
very similar."</TE>
<TE>   Later that day, the advisory committee unanimously endorsed the
pill.</TE>
<TE>   When Warner-Lambert provided the additional information to the FDA
eight days later, it was not similar: The total fraction of
liver-injured patients who took Rezulin doubled. A scant 0.6% of
those given a placebo were found to be injured.</TE>
<TE>   But based on the advisory committee's recommendation, the FDA
approved Rezulin on Jan. 29, 1997, and it arrived on the American
market two months later.</TE>
<TE>   On May 23, 1997, Warner-Lambert again provided the FDA with an
inaccurate description of liver injuries that were found in the
clinical studies. This time the company assured the agency that,
while four newly identified patients from the studies had elevated
liver enzymes in their blood, "none" exceeded the standard for
clinically significant liver injury. In fact, two of the patients'
enzymes well exceeded the standard; the enzymes in one of them was
measured at 30 times normal--a magnitude reflecting potentially
life-threatening toxicity.</TE>
<TE>   The erroneous company submission to the FDA was signed by eight
Warner-Lambert representatives, including Whitcomb and his boss, Dr.
Robert L. Zerbe, the senior vice president for worldwide clinical
research and development.</TE>
<TE>   By the fall of 1997, details of the first liver failures among
patients who were prescribed Rezulin were about to spill into public
view.</TE>
<TE>   With sales of their new drug already approaching $250 million,
Warner-Lambert executives in Ann Arbor, Mich., and in Morris Plains,
N.J., began drafting language for a revised product label that would
address the risk and recommend short-term liver monitoring to doctors
as the appropriate safeguard.</TE>
<TE>   In preparing for the new label, Whitcomb in September 1997 started
a reexamination of the number of liver injuries that were detected in
the earlier clinical studies.</TE>
<TE>   A computer printout titled "Job 105" and dated Thursday, Oct. 23,
1997, provided him with this information:</TE>
<TE>   By the time Rezulin came onto the U.S. market in March 1997, 78
patients in the clinical studies had been found by laboratory tests
to have liver injury.</TE>
<TE>   But when Whitcomb and eight of his colleagues met with the FDA to
discuss Rezulin's liver toxicity on Oct. 24, 1997, the executives
said nothing about 78 patients.</TE>
<TE>   In a written submission to the FDA and in conversations that fall
and thereafter with the agency, the company representatives said
repeatedly that only 48, or 38% fewer than 78, patients had been
detected with liver injury.</TE>
<TE>   If Warner-Lambert had revealed that 78 Rezulin patients
experienced liver injury, this would have corresponded to 3.1% of the
2,510 total patients given the drug in the clinical studies. At that
percentage, Rezulin likely would have been flagged as the most
potentially liver-toxic diabetes drug on the market. This would have
depressed sales and heightened concern at the FDA.</TE>
<TE>   An FDA summary of the Oct. 24, 1997, meeting between the agency
and Warner-Lambert demonstrates the success of the company's
approach. At the outset of the session, held in Rockville, Md., a
senior FDA official, Dr. G. Alexander Fleming, "thanked Parke Davis
for coming in and being proactive on the issue once the problem was
discovered."</TE>
<TE>   Relying on the company's data, the FDA accepted Warner-Lambert's
recommendation to place language on the label reflecting 48 cases;
the new label would call the incidence of liver failure "very rare."</TE>
<TE>   The FDA officials who conferred with Whitcomb had no idea that the
number of acknowledged liver-injury cases had been shrunk, according
to interviews and the newly obtained documents.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Robert I. Misbin, an FDA medical officer who for years
supported Rezulin but who ultimately fought for its withdrawal,
testified recently that Warner-Lambert "never" informed him of the
higher number of cases.</TE>
<TE>   Misbin testified that if the company had conveyed more accurate
and complete information about the severity of liver injuries in the
clinical studies, he would have opposed approving the drug, in August
1997, as a stand-alone pill for adult-onset diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   According to company documents and sworn testimony this year, even
specialists within Warner-Lambert were unable to discern Whitcomb's
rationale for reporting 48 cases rather than 78.</TE>
<TE>   Beth Ann Baron, a manager on Warner-Lambert's diabetes team in Ann
Arbor, was one of the specialists who tried to obtain documentation
for Whitcomb's rationale, starting in October 1997. "I think it's
fair to say that everyone that was involved ... would have liked to
have seen that," Baron testified in a deposition on March 12. Her
colleague, Donald Sizemore, testified in January that he also raised
the issue with Warner-Lambert's director of worldwide regulatory
affairs, who, he said, "never got back to me on that." Sizemore
testified that he was unaware of any other instance when
Warner-Lambert did not internally "validate" safety data submitted to
the FDA.</TE>
<TE>   A request by The Times to interview Whitcomb last week was
declined by Pfizer. In recent trials of civil lawsuits, company
lawyers have defended as proper his handling of the liver-injury
cases .</TE>
<TE>   Whitcomb remains active in the pharmaceutical industry. In
November, he joined the board of directors of Insmed Inc., a publicly
traded firm that is developing another drug for adult-onset diabetes.
In January, Whitcomb, 48, was one of four former Warner-Lambert
executives who launched a privately held drug-development company
based in Ann Arbor called QUATRx.</TE>
<TE>   Striving for Clinical Studies Free of Bias</TE>
<TE>   Controlled clinical studies are the gold standard of
pharmaceutical research. The studies can help measure the
effectiveness and the safety of a drug. The goal is to insulate the
research from the subjective judgment, or bias, of the people
conducting the experiment.</TE>
<TE>   For this reason, the ground rules for clinical studies are written
and discussed in advance, typically in painstaking detail.</TE>
<TE>   This scientific approach helps the FDA and prescribing physicians
sort viable therapies from unproved hype. Companies also conduct
clinical studies of medicines that have already won government
approval, often in an effort to find expanded uses for them.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Curt D. Furberg, a clinical studies expert who is a professor
of public health at Wake Forest University, said that in his view
Warner-Lambert may have inappropriately reduced the count of liver
injuries from its clinical studies of Rezulin. "It appears that they
made up rules as they went along," said Furberg, who also serves on
an FDA drug-safety advisory committee.</TE>
<TE>   Whitcomb, in sworn testimony given March 6 to 8, said he did not
count cases if he concluded that a study patient's liver injury
resulted from what he suspected was a cause other than Rezulin. Yet,
according to clinical studies experts, all cases of injury should
have been counted and reported. Theorizing about the cause of the
events, they say, improperly infused Whitcomb's opinion into the
research.</TE>
<TE>   John W. Hornbeck, a Los Angeles-based lawyer for plaintiffs suing
the manufacturer, asked Whitcomb in March whether the rejection of a
liver-injury case on the basis of what Whitcomb suspected was a
"clear alternative cause" could introduce bias into the study.</TE>
<TE>   Whitcomb responded: "It is a possibility, yes."</TE>
<TE>   Hornbeck then asked Whitcomb whether placebo patients showing
liver injury were counted, regardless of his opinion about the cause.</TE>
<TE>   Whitcomb responded: "Right."</TE>
<TE>   When Hornbeck asked whether he applied all of the same rules for
counting liver injury to placebo and Rezulin patients alike, Whitcomb
responded: "I would need to go back and look at each of the placebo
patients. Again, I don't recall exactly."</TE>
<TE>   Whitcomb testified that he conferred with a liver specialist
retained by Warner-Lambert about shrinking the total of liver-injury
patients from the clinical studies from 78 to 48. Whitcomb said he
could not remember whether the rules for excluding cases were in
writing when he met with the liver specialist, Dr. Paul Watkins, in
the fall of 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "There may have been some handwritten things that were put
together in the fall of 1997 as we were working on this," Whitcomb
said. " ... I can't tell you for sure."</TE>
<TE>   Whitcomb said he was unable to specify exactly how he went about
reducing the 78 cases to 48. "I don't have a specific recollection of
how we got down to the 48," Whitcomb testified.</TE>
<TE>   Whitcomb and company lawyers have said that he subtracted the
greatest number of cases by varying the definition of what
constituted liver injury, depending on which laboratory tested each
patient's blood. The uniform standard for liver injury was a liver
enzyme count of 102--three times the boundary of the upper limit of
normal, or 34. By using a variable standard, Whitcomb could have
excluded cases with enzyme counts as high as 135.</TE>
<TE>   The use of a variable standard for liver injury ran counter to the
FDA's understanding of the ground rules for the Rezulin studies,
according to internal company documents, the testimony of FDA medical
officer Misbin and statements that Whitcomb himself made under oath
more than a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, an aide to Whitcomb, Thomas Valiquett, wrote in an April
30, 1999, e-mail to colleagues, "The value of 34 was decided by
Randy" Whitcomb. Valiquett pointed out that 34 was the value that
Warner-Lambert used when addressing the FDA's earlier concern about
liver toxicity.</TE>
<TE>   When Watkins, the company-hired liver specialist, was asked
whether the value for liver enzymes that he and Whitcomb used in fall
1997 was 102, or triple the upper limit of 34, he testified: "That is
correct."</TE>
<TE>   When Whitcomb was asked in his first deposition, on Dec. 13, 2000,
whether the upper limit of normal used for the Rezulin studies was
34, he testified: "Uh-huh.... That would be about right, yeah."</TE>
<TE>   Whitcomb then was asked by Zoe B. Littlepage, a plaintiff's lawyer
from Houston: "Do you recall ever being asked by anybody at
Parke-Davis to go back and look at the clinical trial data and use
any other upper limits of normal number other than 34?"</TE>
<TE>   Whitcomb responded: "I don't ever remember being asked that, no."</TE>
<TE>   In his testimony in March of this year, Whitcomb defended his
count of the cases. Asked by Hornbeck: "Sir, the label does not
reflect that there were 78 cases and then a post-hoc analysis reduced
that 78 to 48, does it?"</TE>
<TE>   Whitcomb countered: "Seventy-eight is a scientifically invalid
number."</TE>
<TE>   When Hornbeck asked whether "there were really two sets of books
for the data," Whitcomb replied: "I disagree with that completely."</TE>
<TE>   A More Risky Course on Rezulin in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   When it came to dealing with the concerns of regulators, Whitcomb
was Warner-Lambert's go-to executive. Late in the fall of 1997,
Warner-Lambert dispatched him to Britain, where alarm about Rezulin
was cresting. The drug was marketed in the United Kingdom by another
company, Glaxo-Wellcome.</TE>
<TE>   But while he was en route, executives at Glaxo, in consultation
with British health authorities, decided to withdraw Rezulin. The
decision was a stinging setback to Warner-Lambert, prompting a senior
executive to suggest a link between sales and the degree to which a
company would tolerate a safety risk.</TE>
<TE>   "[T]he product was looking to be a commercial disappointment in
the U.K. due to spotty commitment within [Glaxo] and poor
preparation. Hence it was easy for them to 'take the high road' on
safety," wrote pharmaceuticals division President Anthony H. Wild in
a Nov. 30, 1997, letter to his Warner-Lambert colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   Left unsaid in Wild's letter was that, in the U.S., Rezulin was
among the biggest-selling new drugs on the market.</TE>
<TE>   While Glaxo chose the "high road," Warner-Lambert stayed a more
risky course.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the mounting liver failures, the company aggressively
recruited doctors with general and family practices, the new
documents show.</TE>
<TE>   Warner-Lambert's marketing executives helped devise a program that
would pay such doctors up to $350 for every patient they enrolled in
a study called REACH.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the physicians stood to make thousands of dollars by
shifting their patients from other diabetes drugs to Rezulin.</TE>
<TE>   The REACH study was planned for well more than a year. And, unlike
the earlier clinical studies, REACH could have no bearing on the
FDA's original decision to approve Rezulin.</TE>
<TE>   But by early 1998, word of Rezulin's liver toxicity was
complicating the recruitment of doctors and patients. Concerns
deepened with the liver failure and death, on May 17, 1998, of Audrey
LaRue Jones, an East St. Louis, Ill., woman given Rezulin in a
diabetes-prevention study conducted by the National Institutes of
Health. Because doctors had strictly monitored her liver functions,
which Warner-Lambert and the FDA had relied on to catch liver
problems in time, the death raised significant new doubt about
Rezulin. On June 4, 1998, officials at NIH announced they had
excluded Rezulin from the government's ongoing study.</TE>
<TE>   Company executives sought to preempt any regulatory move to force
the pill off the market.</TE>
<TE>   By late July 1998, Whitcomb and other company executives convinced
the FDA that only a slight change on the drug's label was needed. The
new label made no reference to the death in the NIH study. The FDA
made no public statement about the event, and the FDA did nothing to
deter use of Rezulin in other studies, including REACH.</TE>
<TE>   A panel of experts at NIH found that Rezulin "probably" caused the
woman's liver failure, and the coroner's death certificate attributed
the "underlying cause" to Rezulin. But Warner-Lambert issued a news
release that blamed the death on factors "unrelated" to Rezulin.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the newly obtained documents show that Warner-Lambert's
senior director of medical and scientific affairs, Dr. Robert G.
Thompson, wrote to doctors who had signed up for the REACH study,
assuring them of the drug's safety.</TE>
<TE>   But many remained anxious.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of concern from the physicians about the safety of
Rezulin," wrote Jenny Chin, a scientist under Thompson, in an e-mail
to him on June 17, 1998. "I truly believe that it would be very
helpful if we sent out another Parke-Davis letter from you (doctor to
doctor) reassuring the physicians."</TE>
<TE>   There also was concern internally at Warner-Lambert, the new
documents show.</TE>
<TE>   After reviewing adverse reactions reported among patients who were
prescribed Rezulin, another company scientist, Alexandra Pearce,
wrote in an e-mail that she sent to a colleague on Nov. 1, 1998:</TE>
<TE>   "When I was entering the data yesterday, I was thinking I really
wouldn't like to be a woman on 400 [milligrams] of Rezulin." Pearce
termed the adverse reactions "statistically significant."</TE>
<TE>   Yet publicly, company representatives betrayed no such concerns.
They continued to extol Rezulin as safe when used in accordance with
the recommended liver monitoring. And Thompson kept reassuring the
REACH doctors, also called investigators.</TE>
<TE>   "Bob Thompson is planning teleconference with the REACH
investigators to update them on the status of the trial and to
reassure them that Liver function monitoring is going well," Chin
wrote in a Nov. 9, 1998, e-mail. "We need to find a way to motivate
the doctors.... They want to be reassured that Rezulin therapy is
safe as long as liver function monitoring is being conducted
according to labeling guidelines."</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 8, 1998, Thompson wrote again to the REACH doctors. He
claimed that the incidence of liver-related deaths or organ
transplants among Rezulin patients who were "not adequately
monitored" was just 1 in 60,000.</TE>
<TE>   "The company has always been forthcoming with information
regarding the safety and efficacy of this therapy," Thompson wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Ten days later, Rosa Delia Valenzuela died at USC-University
Hospital in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Medical records and recent sworn testimony show that her doctor
enrolled the Arcadia woman in the REACH study on Oct. 9, 1998,
shifting her from another pill, Glucophage, to 400 milligrams of
Rezulin daily. Valenzuela's liver functions were monitored at the
outset and were found to be normal.</TE>
<TE>   A month later, her liver functions were again monitored and were
found to be normal. But 13 days later, on Nov. 19, 1998, her liver
enzymes were more than 30 times normal. She descended into liver
failure.</TE>
<TE>   Valenzuela, 63, the mother of five adult children and the wife of
a renowned, retired horse-racing jockey, Ismael "Milo" Valenzuela,
died Dec. 18, 1998. The Los Angeles County death certificate
attributed it to her body's reaction to Rezulin. It cited as
contributing factors weight, alcoholism and diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of her death, Valenzuela was one of 2,607 patients in
the REACH study who were scheduled to take Rezulin for six months.</TE>
<TE>   Her death posed a clear threat to the viability of Rezulin,
because it was the second time in just seven months that a patient
had developed liver failure and died, despite having been closely
monitored in a clinical study.</TE>
<TE>   Warner-Lambert complied with the law by including the death among
cases that it reported to the FDA. But the company executives balked
at promptly alerting the 400 or more other doctors who were
conducting the REACH study.</TE>
<TE>   "Do we have to send a letter out to all of the REACH investigators
to inform them of this event?" Chin asked in an e-mail that she sent
to Thompson and others.</TE>
<TE>   Said a follow-up internal e-mail: "We have NO REGULATORY
OBLIGATION to send a letter to the REACH Physicians." The e-mail
added: "The Liver Experts we have spoken to were not convinced that
this incident was related to the study drug. So for Bob [Thompson] to
send out a letter now would be misleading because we cannot fully
explain the case and it would be unnecessarily frightening."</TE>
<TE>   Another memo cited similar advice from Whitcomb's boss, Dr. Zerbe,
the company's senior vice president for worldwide clinical research
and development.</TE>
<TE>   According to records and interviews, the physician who placed
Valenzuela on Rezulin and the liver specialist who treated her at
USC-University Hospital concluded that the drug probably did cause
her liver failure. The death certificate implicated Rezulin. And the
specialist consulted by the company, Watkins, advised as of late
December 1998 that the drug could not be excluded as having caused
the liver failure.</TE>
<TE>   Yet more than a month after Valenzuela's death, when
Warner-Lambert's Thompson informed the other REACH study physicians
of the fatality, he pointed to factors other than Rezulin. And he did
not mention that monitoring the patient's liver functions had, once
again, failed to prevent organ failure and death. Pfizer declined to
make Thompson available for an interview for this article.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to update you with available information on a 64-year-old
[sic] Hispanic female who died of liver failure while enrolled in the
REACH trial," Thompson wrote the doctors on Jan. 21, 1999. "In
addition to Type 2 diabetes, this patient had a history of
gallstones, cardiac problems and a long history of alcohol abuse....
She was admitted to the hospital but was not eligible for liver
transplantation because of other illnesses. She died of liver failure
approximately 5 weeks later."</TE>
<TE>   About the same time, Warner-Lambert took the extraordinary step of
offering to indemnify doctors nationwide if they were sued for
prescribing Rezulin. The company also offered to provide the doctors
with experienced lawyers and to cover the physicians' other
lawsuit-related expenses.</TE>
<TE>   The American Medical Assn., in an opinion first issued in 1992,
advised doctors against entering such arrangements:</TE>
<TE>   "Physicians should prescribe drugs, devices and other treatments
based solely upon medical considerations and patient needs. A third
party's offer to indemnify a physician for lawsuits arising from the
physician's prescription or use of the third party's drug ...
introduces inappropriate factors into medical decision making. Such
offers, regardless of their limitations, therefore constitute
unacceptable gifts."</TE>
<TE>   Fauteux, the Pfizer spokesman, said the indemnity policy was made
available "only to doctors who prescribed Rezulin in accordance with
federal, state and local laws, and in compliance" with the product
labeling. He said that "Warner-Lambert believed that doctors should
not be held liable for properly prescribing a drug that was an
appropriate treatment for their patient."</TE>
<TE>   The Valenzuela family is suing the company and the doctor who
shifted Rosa Valenzuela onto Rezulin. A trial is scheduled to begin
in September in Los Angeles Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   The first six trials of civil lawsuits alleging wrongdoing by the
company in its handling of the drug unfolded over the last few
months. In two cases, tried in Houston and in Rockville, Md., juries
returned verdicts in favor of the company. Those suing Warner-Lambert
won multimillion-dollar verdicts or monetary settlements in the other
four cases, in Jackson, Miss.; Corpus Christi, Texas; Liberty, Mo.;
and Tulsa, Okla.</TE>
<TE>   The jury foreman for the Missouri case, Clark Lamoreux of Kansas
City, said that in his view Warner-Lambert broke the law.</TE>
<TE>   "Warner-Lambert, Parke-Davis, showed blatant disregard for public
safety by misleading the FDA, doctors and patients," Lamoreux said in
an interview. "If I had a family member that was on Rezulin, by God I
would definitely want somebody prosecuted to the fullest extent."</TE>

<HD>Strategy Developed to Get Latinos 'to Take the Risk'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In trying to promote sales of the diabetes drug Rezulin,
Warner-Lambert Co. representatives in 1998 explored ideas on how to
get doctors who treat Latinos "to take the risk" of prescribing the
drug.</LD>
<LD>   Latinos are an outsized chunk of the 15 million Americans with
adult-onset diabetes and are twice as likely as non-Latino whites to
have the disease, according to the American Diabetes Assn.</LD>
<LD>   In January 1998, the company convened "focus groups" among
Spanish-speaking doctors in Miami, whose patients were predominantly
Latino. A summary of the sessions, distributed to Warner-Lambert's
top marketing executives, described "differences between Hispanic and
American patients," including:</LD>
<TE>   * "These physicians describe the Hispanic patient as less informed
and educated about medicines/health than the American patient."</TE>
<TE>   * "Some physicians describe the Latino patient as less disciplined
than the American patient. They are less likely to comply with
treatment and come back for follow-up visits."</TE>
<TE>   * "The Hispanic patient relies on word-of-mouth and is very likely
to ask for a medicine simply because a family member, friend or
neighbor said it is good."</TE>
<TE>   * "Several physicians mentioned that the Hispanic patient is easy
to intimidate because they are afraid of having to go on insulin."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the research summary, Robert J. Fauteux, a spokesman
for Pfizer, which acquired Warner-Lambert two years ago, said it
reflected ''the genuine challenges of controlling diabetes in these
patients.''</TE>
<TE>   ''It is widely recognized, of course, that regional, cultural and
ethnic factors all influence the different ways in which various
populations perceive and address health-care issues," Fauteux said.</TE>
<TE>   "In our multicultural society, the differences in the incidence
and treatment of diabetes are a case in point.''</TE>
<TE>   The research summary also reported that while the doctors treating
Latinos voiced unease about the safety of Rezulin, they found the
side effects of a competing diabetes drug, Glucophage, to be
"minimal.... Rezulin was thought to have more negative side effects."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the summary said that "many physicians noted that
Glucophage has been helpful in taking patients off of insulin."
(Warner-Lambert executives had first carved a niche for Rezulin among
FDA regulators and endocrinologists by claiming that their drug was
effective in controlling the blood-sugar levels of adult-onset
diabetics who were taking insulin.)</TE>
<TE>   The Warner-Lambert summary, dated March 31, 1998, concluded:</TE>
<TE>   "It is clear that in the Miami area, a more aggressive approach to
promoting Rezulin needs to be undertaken in the Hispanic community.
The physicians are far behind on the learning curve and until they
know more, will be very unlikely to take the risk of prescribing
Rezulin."</TE>

<HD>Longtime Justices Hold Sway in Opposite Camps</HD>
<DH>Law: Conservative Rehnquist and liberal Stevens, now at the
peak of their influence, have taken different stands on major issues
for decades.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>At the Supreme Court, long membership has its rewards.</LD>
<LD>   Since the mid-1970s, William H. Rehnquist and John Paul Stevens
have staked out opposing views on many of the biggest issues that
come before the Supreme Court: religion, the death penalty, civil
rights, abortion, crime and punishment, and states' rights.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Rehnquist, 77, and Stevens, 82, are enjoying the peaks of
their influence, swaying the court in the term that ended last week
to some of their most cherished goals. Speaking first in the
justices' private deliberations, the chief justice and the senior
justice set the tone for debate and often won the day.</LD>
<TE>   The conservative chief justice, Rehnquist, gained major victories
on school vouchers, student drug testing and states' rights.</TE>
<TE>   But Stevens, the leader of the loyal and liberal opposition, had a
surprisingly strong year, winning majorities to outlaw executions for
the mentally retarded; to require that juries, not judges, decide
death sentences; to uphold temporary bans on development; to give
patients fighting their HMOs a right to a second opinion from outside
doctors; and to allow federal civil rights lawyers to sue employers
over discrimination, even when the workers had signed an arbitration
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Some Unusual Defeats</TE>
<TE>   Stevens did so well this term that Rehnquist suffered a few
unaccustomed defeats. He was the only justice who dissented in both
death penalty cases announced a week ago, and he dissented alone when
Stevens spoke for the court in saying the government cannot require a
permit from religious or political activists before they go
door-to-door to spread their message.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the school voucher decision announced Thursday was arguably
the year's most significant ruling, and it was a personal victory for
Rehnquist, who has long championed choice in schools.</TE>
<TE>   In 1973, he was the rookie conservative on the high court when his
colleagues struck down a New York state tuition tax credit that
helped parents send their children to private and parochial schools.</TE>
<TE>   Rehnquist disagreed profoundly. He thought Thomas Jefferson's
comment that the Constitution erected a ''wall of separation between
church and state'' was a ''misleading metaphor'' and should be
scrapped, as he wrote later. He believed the ban on laws ''respecting
an establishment of religion'' meant only that the government cannot
fund a church or show favoritism for a particular religion.</TE>
<TE>   He described the New York law as one of ''benevolent neutrality''
that preserved a true choice between private and public schools. It
was not an effort to promote religion, he said.</TE>
<TE>   It took 29 years, but Rehnquist mustered a 5-4 majority last week
to overturn that decision and to uphold the principle that the
government can give subsidies to parents who send their children to
parochial schools.</TE>
<TE>   He described Ohio's voucher law as ''a neutral program of ... true
private choice,'' not a means to promote religion.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame University law professor Richard Garnett, a former
Rehnquist clerk, called the voucher ruling ''the capstone of the
chief's slow but steady effort to rehabilitate the law in this area.
He came on the court at a time when he thought it was far too hostile
and suspicious of religion. It's taken a long time, but he's
patiently stuck with it.''</TE>
<TE>   Until last week, the law said government could not create programs
that had the ''effect'' of funneling tax money to religious
institutions. Under this rule, President Bush's ''faith-based
initiative'' stood in doubt, since he wants to use government money
to support religious groups that, for example, provide counseling for
prisoners, drug abusers and troubled teens.</TE>
<TE>   But Rehnquist scrapped the so-called effects test. So long as the
government has a valid public purpose, such as improving education
for low-income children, it can send tax money flowing to people who
in turn will give it to church schools. His opinion removes most of
the constitutional obstacles to Bush's broader agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens, meanwhile, adheres to the strict separation of church and
state. He believes the Constitution requires no tax money be spent
for ''religious indoctrination,'' as he put it last week.</TE>
<TE>   While Rehnquist has been winning in the aid-to-parochial schools
cases, Stevens has prevailed when the issue has been school-sponsored
prayers in public schools.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Stevens spoke for the court in striking down a
Texas school board's policy of choosing a student to deliver a prayer
over the public address system at football games. Students may pray
on their own, but school officials have no business sponsoring group
prayers, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In dissent, Rehnquist snapped that the Stevens opinion ''bristles
with hostility to all things religious in public life.''</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the religious wars, the two have disagreed repeatedly on
the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   In 1972, Rehnquist dissented when a liberal majority declared
capital punishment unconstitutional. Four years later, Stevens, a new
appointee of President Ford, joined Rehnquist in voting to permit the
death penalty again.</TE>
<TE>   But over the last two decades, the two have taken opposite
courses. The chief justice is the most fervent supporter of the death
penalty, and he has moved quickly to reverse lower courts that have
stood in the way of executions.</TE>
<TE>   Death Penalty Curbs</TE>
<TE>   Stevens has voiced growing dismay over some aspects of how the
death penalty is administered. He sharply dissented in 1989 when the
court upheld executions for the mentally retarded. He was convinced
after reading extensively on the issue that people who are mentally
retarded lack an ability to control their impulses and learn from
mistakes, and, therefore, are not the most culpable of criminals.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens, who spends part of the winter in Florida, also spoke out
in opposition in cases where trial judges in Florida and Alabama had
ignored a jury's recommendation and imposed a death sentence.</TE>
<TE>   This month, Stevens put together majorities to reverse both
policies on the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens won over conservative Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence
Thomas to the principle that juries must decide ultimately who will
die.</TE>
<TE>   Two other Rehnquist allies, Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and
Anthony M. Kennedy, joined the Stevens opinion outlawing executions
of the retarded.</TE>
<TE>   Rehnquist was the lone dissenter on both issues.</TE>
<TE>   Since the court holds its debate behind closed doors, it is hard
to assess which justices have the most influence. But some clearly
carry more sway than others.</TE>
<TE>   Rehnquist's predecessor, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, was seen
as pompous and at times scatter-brained. Justice Byron White, who
served 31 years, was smart and hard-driving, but he saw his job as
deciding cases, not writing principles of law.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Rehnquist had a clear, conservative agenda from the
start, and he has never wavered. He is affable, organized and well
prepared.</TE>
<TE>   In the conferences, the justices say he lays out his views clearly
and wastes no time on wandering discussions.</TE>
<TE>   He is also remarkably predictable. Rehnquist supports states'
rights over federal power, sides with the police over claims from
criminal defendants, and favors property rights over environmental
concerns. He has steadily opposed the right to abortion, affirmative
action and most claims of job discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   In the war on terrorism, the Bush administration can count on
Rehnquist to support the government. The first signal came Friday,
when the high court issued an order to close all immigration hearings
in cases that the Justice Department says involve terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens is not a conventional liberal in the mold of Justices
William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall. But after they retired in
the early 1990s, Stevens became an outspoken foe of what he sees as
conservative activism led by the chief justice.</TE>
<TE>   In a series of 5-4 rulings, the Rehnquist majority has shielded
states from the federal job-bias law and has struck down all or part
of a series of laws enacted during the Clinton administration, such
as the Brady Act restricting handgun purchases and the Violence
Against Women Act, which allowed victims of sexual assaults to sue
their attackers.</TE>
<TE>   On each occasion, Stevens strongly dissented and said the court
should uphold the acts of Congress. So far, he has been unable to win
over any of Rehnquist's allies on the states' rights issue.</TE>
<TE>   He had more success in limiting abusive practices by police
officers and prison guards. On the court's final day, Stevens spoke
for the court in ruling that two Alabama prison guards can be sued
for having chained an inmate to a metal pole and leaving him in the
hot sun for seven hours without water and a bathroom break.
Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas dissented.</TE>
<TE>   These same constitutional issues will be joined in the fall when
the Supreme Court returns to work.</TE>
<TE>   California's ''three strikes'' law is being challenged as cruel
and unusual punishment in the case of a shoplifter who was sentenced
to 50 years. The court will also hear a states' rights challenge to
the Clinton-sponsored law that gives workers a right to 12 weeks of
unpaid leave for family emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   Rehnquist and Stevens say they will be back for another term, and
count on them to be on opposite sides of both cases.</TE>

<LD>Thousands of people fled this Black Hills gambling town Saturday
because of a growing wildfire, though by nightfall the main fire had
passed without damaging structures, fire officials said.</LD>
<LD>   In North Dakota, several grass fires flared up Saturday, including
a 20,000-acre blaze that burned about 30 buildings and dozens of
vehicles in a town of 15 residents, authorities said. The townspeople
were all safe and accounted for.</LD>
<LD>   "There is no more Shields," Sioux County Sheriff Frank Landeis
said of the North Dakota town. "All that's left is one house and the
bar."</LD>
<TE>   The fire in Deadwood, a 1,380-resident gambling town that attracts
thousands of tourists to its casinos in the summer months, was 700
acres and growing, said Steve Hasenorhl of the South Dakota Wildlands
Fire Suppression Division.</TE>
<TE>   Deadwood is about 40 miles northwest of Rapid City and is home to
about 80 casinos.</TE>
<TE>   "The fire is not laying down at all," said Scott Randolph, a
spokesman for the Lawrence County Department of Emergency Management.
"It remains a very, very dangerous fire."</TE>
<TE>   The fire was about three miles long and half a mile wide, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. William Janklow issued the evacuation order after the fire
jumped a highway on the outskirts of town.</TE>
<TE>   Later Saturday, officials ordered evacuations for a handful of
residents in outlying areas.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities also said the Deadwood hospital moved its three
patients to the hospital in nearby Spearfish.</TE>
<TE>   Smoke from the fire could be seen 100 miles away. A huge column of
smoke was drifting over Bear Butte and Sturgis.</TE>
<TE>   Hasenorhl said windy, hot conditions in the northern Black Hills
were making the situation worse; temperatures in the region soared
Saturday to near 110 degrees.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Sen. Fred Thompson, a onetime Hollywood movie actor and
star of real-life political dramas, played the leading man again
Saturday. This time it was at his wedding.</LD>
<LD>   The Republican senator, who plans to retire when his term ends,
married political and media specialist Jeri Kehn in a small, private
ceremony in Naperville, Ill.</LD>
<LD>   Thompson, 59, has known Kehn, 35, since they met on the Fourth of
July in 1996.</LD>
<TE>   Thompson announced his retirement in March after eight years in
the Senate, where he became a GOP star.</TE>
<TE>   Kehn, a political and media consultant, worked for the Senate
Republican Conference and the Republican National Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-6 Thompson played leading roles in two real-life
dramas: chief Senate Republican lawyer during Watergate in the 1970s
and Senate chairman for the hearings into the President Clinton
fund-raising scandal in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Among his movie credits were the blockbusters "In the Line of
Fire" and "The Hunt for Red October."</TE>

<AU>DENNIS J. AIGNER</AU>
<BD>Dennis J. Aigner is professor of management and
economics at UC Irvine, and dean of the Donald Bren School of
Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara. He is
director of the Orange County Executive Survey.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although six of the 10 cities on Forbes' 2002 list of "The Best
Places to Do Business in America" are in California, a May 13 article
in The Times bears a more cautious headline, "California Rebound
Unclear." It depicts a business environment characterized by slow
employment growth, lessening housing affordability and an uneven
recovery from a brief recession.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County, which holds the 10th spot on the Forbes list,
displays similar characteristics. Based on the results of UC Irvine's
2002 Orange County Executive Survey, the financial performance of
Orange County firms in 2001 was a mixed bag: 47% of firms reported
better performance than they experienced in 2000, but 25% said that
2001 was a comparatively worse year. These numbers are reminiscent of
1992, which was in the depth of the protracted recession experienced
in California during the early '90s.</LD>
<TE>   Yet when asked about their expectations for 2002, the business
executives we spoke to were amazingly upbeat, with 68% anticipating
an improved financial position and only 5% forecasting a worse year
compared to 2001. Even Orange County's manufacturing sector, which
has been weakening in the last few years, expressed considerable
optimism, with 63% of firms anticipating an improved 2002. Such
optimism needs to be tempered by the fact that 2001 was a relatively
bad year and that very few firms expect 2002 to be a "much better"
year.</TE>
<TE>   This cautious optimism is reflected in moderated expansion plans,
both in 2002 and over a five-year period. On the upside, plans to
downsize in Orange County or to move outside the county are less
intense in this year's survey. As usual, the manufacturing sector
leads the pack with respect to downsizing and potential relocation.
The expanding sectors are business services, finance, insurance and
real estate, and wholesale trade, consistent with the county's
continuing evolution into a primarily service economy.</TE>
<TE>   Employment plans reflect a muted recovery, with 36% of firms
expecting to add employees in 2002 (only 1% "substantially more").
While these indicators don't translate directly into a quantitative
forecast of employment growth, they are consistent with an
approximate 2% growth rate, or 28,000 jobs, somewhat higher than most
other forecasts, which put job growth at 15,000 to 17,000.</TE>
<TE>   Probably the most distressing finding in this year's survey is the
downward trend in Orange County's attractiveness for business. Only
29% of firms say that the county is becoming a more attractive place
to do business, with 17% saying it's becoming less attractive. Only
two years ago, 44% of firms expressed positive feelings about the
county's future, a percentage that had held steady since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The most substantial drops in optimism about the county have
occurred in the finance, insurance and real estate, business services
and manufacturing sectors. While Orange County remains attractive
because of its location and quality of life, the high cost of housing
for employees and growing traffic congestion are the most frequently
cited reasons for executives' negative views.</TE>
<TE>   Of 17 potential barriers to doing business in Orange County,
housing costs for employees were cited by 75% of the executives we
surveyed as having a moderate or severe impact. The costs of land and
building, energy and labor follow in importance.</TE>
<TE>   The housing affordability index for Orange County recently
regressed to 29% and continues to worsen. The rental market is tight.
Orange County's plan to force builders to provide 4,000 more homes
for low-income families has been criticized for lacking teeth, and
without teeth there is no reason to think developers will provide
low- and moderate-income housing. The economics of the situation are
simply otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   It is important that the cities provide subsidies and incentives
for their most critical employees to be able to live near their work.
Otherwise we should focus on providing transportation improvements
and alternatives to make it more convenient for employees to get to
work if they live in such lower-cost areas as San Bernardino and
Riverside counties. And we must build more high-density housing in
the county so more people can afford to live near their workplace.</TE>
<TE>   The evolution of Orange County into a powerful economic center is
simultaneously the good news and the reason we are experiencing
problems. High costs are driving manufacturing firms away, and we are
now a predominantly service-oriented economy. If we can continue to
be a hub of entrepreneurship and innovation, and if government can
focus on infrastructure development, education and transportation
solutions, the county will prosper.</TE>
<TE>   With city and county governments enjoying high satisfaction
ratings at the moment, it remains only for the right decisions to be
made.</TE>

<HD>Those With MS Need Help, Not Pity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM GRAVES</AU>
<BD> Jim Graves is the communications coordinator of the
National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Orange County Chapter. The
chapter's Web site is www.nmssoc.org .</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The unfortunate reality of the human condition is that after an
initial spurt of growth and physical development in our childhood and
youth, we begin a slow physical decline by the time we reach
adulthood.</LD>
<LD>   We're all familiar with the symptoms the elderly experience:
diminished ability to see and hear, stiff and painful joints, a loss
of balance or even the ability to walk, forgetfulness or greater
difficulty in mental focusing, aches and pains, limited energy, loss
of strength and coordination and the like. In a nutshell, our bodies
wear out, and we are no longer able to function or respond in the
ways we did when we were young.</LD>
<LD>   It's a potentially depressing scenario, to be sure, but on the
positive side of things, most of us won't experience the more severe
symptoms of aging until we're into our 60s, 70s or older, especially
if we live healthy lifestyles. However, for the 3,000 Orange County
residents diagnosed with multiple sclerosis), they may experience
symptoms commonly associated with old age in their 30s, 40s or
sooner.</LD>
<TE>   MS is believed to be an autoimmune disease, wherein the body's own
defense system attacks myelin, the fatty substance that surrounds and
protects the nerve fibers of the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord:
the central nervous system.</TE>
<TE>   The damaged myelin may form scar tissue, or sclerosis, and
sometimes the nerve fiber is also damaged. Therefore, with any part
of the myelin sheath or nerve fiber damaged, nerve impulses to and
from the brain are distorted or interrupted. Hence, young or
middle-aged people may experience symptoms most of us won't
experience until we're senior citizens.</TE>
<TE>   For Edwina Crites of Newport Beach, this means loss of the ability
to walk and the need for regular care to perform the most basic
household tasks. For Lois Wareham of Orange Park Acres, it means
chronic fatigue. For Jay Tilton of Capistrano Beach, it means
difficulty in writing legibly and concentrating.</TE>
<TE>   For Debby Most of Laguna Niguel, it means chronic pain that she
compares to a swarm of bees stinging parts of her body. In addition
to the physical symptoms, as with any chronic illness, MS can have
devastating emotional and psychological effects.</TE>
<TE>   In recent decades, major strides have been made toward helping
people with MS live normal lives. Currently, there are four federally
approved medications that can slow the progression of the disease.
Additionally, there are a variety of physical exercises that can help
people with MS greatly improve their quality of life. However, the
cause of and a cure for the disease remain unknown.</TE>
<TE>   While few of us may be scientists or physicians, we can all play a
role in the fight against MS. We can educate ourselves about the
disease, so we can understand what it is and how it affects the
person with it. Should we know people diagnosed with MS, we can offer
them not our pity but our understanding, kindness and friendship.</TE>
<TE>   MS is not as prevalent as cancer or heart disease and hence
receives less attention from the public. However, we must remember
that each day, 29 of our fellow Americans receive the news that they
have MS and face an uncertain future. Our active involvement today,
especially considering recent scientific and medical breakthroughs,
offers them the best hope for more effective treatments and an
eventual cure.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, where there is so much emphasis on quality of
life and where the year-round climate is conducive to being young and
healthy, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that thousands of our
neighbors are suffering. Here we need more involvement from
volunteers, and in a community known for its affluence, more
contributors to help with important research.</TE>

<HD>Such a Long Honeymoon Definitely in Order</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Laker A.C. Green, famous for practicing abstinence before
marriage, tied the knot April 20 in Laguna Niguel, and it has been
one long honeymoon ever since.</LD>
<LD>   "It has been an incredible two months," Green told the Portland
Tribune, the city's twice-weekly alternative paper.</LD>
<LD>   Besides all that, A.C. and Veronique Green have been to Fiji,
Miami, the Caribbean and Spain since their wedding at the
Ritz-Carlton.</LD>
<TE>   "Being married and all that comes with it has been wonderful,"
said Green, 38. "It was worth the wait."</TE>
<TE>   The A.C. Green Youth Foundation sponsors a Web site,
www.ClubAC.com, promoting abstinence.</TE>
<TE>   Current quote: "Abstinence makes the heart grow fonder."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: What Olympic swimmer--perhaps more famous as a
surfer--will be featured on a new 37-cent stamp?</TE>
<TE>   It's over: As far as Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post is
concerned, the World Cup ended before it ended.</TE>
<TE>   "The fever broke when Germany took an insurmountable lead of 1-0
against the United States, and went on to win, 1-0. Immediately
thereafter, cries of 'Check, please!' were heard all over America and
tens of millions of people went back to the real world, leaving the
Soccer Poets to roam the pitch alone."</TE>
<TE>   Counterpoint: From Tim Kawakami of the San Jose Mercury News: "You
don't have to await, or fear, the arrival of soccer as a major sport
in America. It's already here.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't see it or hear it, you are listening to the wrong
language or looking in the wrong places--which is growing harder to
do in the most multicultural society in the history of the world."</TE>
<TE>   Baby Jordan: Already, Michael Jordan's oldest son, 13-year-old
Jeffrey, is 5 feet 9 and recently played in the AAU 13-and-under
national tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "Heir Jordan," Jay Mariotti of the Chicago Sun-Times dubbed him.</TE>
<TE>   Parents and coaches are urging people to allow Jeffrey--a
left-hander, unlike his father--to be a kid like any other.</TE>
<TE>   "They tease him like they tease everyone else," said one of his
coaches, Mike Weinstein. "Sometimes, they'll ask him for shoes, but
otherwise, he's just one of the kids."</TE>
<TE>   A little Bull goes a long way: By now you probably know a
marketing man advised Jay Williams--known as Jason at Duke--to go by
a shortened version of his name in the NBA to avoid confusion.
(There's that touchy matter of former New Jersey Net Jayson Williams
facing a manslaughter charge.) Jay Williams--taken second overall by
Chicago in the NBA draft--is rolling with it.</TE>
<TE>   "My friends are calling me 'The Artist Formerly Known as Jason,' "
he told the Newark Star-Ledger.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Hawaiian Duke Kahanamoku, the father of modern
surfing and winner of the 100-meter freestyle at the 1912 and 1920
Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: A parting blow from Kornheiser: "And don't you dare
say that anyone who doesn't kneel at the altar of soccer is
prejudiced against international sports and foreign athletes. We've
got lots of foreign athletes playing an international sport right
here. It's called the NBA."</TE>

<HD>Sele Has Dodgers Under His Control</HD>
<DH>Baseball: He gives up three hits in Angels' 7-0 victory and
is 4-0 against L.A. Ishii is knocked out in fourth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Make the decision on statistics alone, and the question is a valid
one: When the Angels decided to remove a starter from their rotation
so they could add rookie John Lackey, why didn't they drop Aaron
Sele?</LD>
<LD>   The Angels decided to drop Scott Schoeneweis instead, although
Sele's numbers were just as poor as those of Schoeneweis, and in some
cases worse.</LD>
<LD>   For one night, anyway, the Angels were rewarded: Sele pitched one
of the finest games of his career, twirling a three-hit shutout
Saturday in a 7-0 victory over the Dodgers.</LD>
<TE>   "I can't say enough about the game he pitched," Angel Manager Mike
Scioscia said. "It was tremendous."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Salmon homered, doubled, singled and drove in three runs,
leading a 14-hit attack that thrilled the apparent minority of Angel
fans among the sellout crowd of 43,592 at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger starter Kazuhisa Ishii all but forfeited his longshot
chance to make the National League All-Star team, getting pounded and
then dismissed in the fourth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Sele walked one, struck out five and made a season-high 124
pitches, in the Angels' first complete-game shutout in two years.
Brian Cooper, since traded to the Toronto Blue Jays, shut out the
Oakland Athletics two years ago today.</TE>
<TE>   Sele retired 23 of the final 25 hitters, including 13 in a row at
one point, and all the hits he gave up were singles--by Mark
Grudzielanek in the second inning, Shawn Green in the sixth and Eric
Karros in the ninth. The Dodgers got one runner into scoring
position.</TE>
<TE>   Sele did consistently Saturday what he has done only
intermittently all season--get ahead of hitters, bury hitters with
two strikes and especially throw his trademark curve for strikes.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't remember him throwing two poor curveballs in a row,"
Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   The simple answer to why Sele remains in the rotation and
Schoeneweis does not: Sele has a $24-million contract and Schoeneweis
does not.</TE>
<TE>   But the reason Sele has that contract is because he has a track
record that Schoeneweis does not. In each of the past four seasons,
Sele has won at least 15 games and posted an earned-run average below
5.00. Schoeneweis, in his third season in the Angel rotation, has yet
to accomplish either feat.</TE>
<TE>   When the Angels demoted Schoeneweis to the bullpen Friday, Sele
had the same number of victories and a slightly higher ERA, and
opponents were hitting .324 against him.</TE>
<TE>   "His track record, for me, instills that inner confidence," Angel
pitching coach Bud Black said. "He's done it before. There's no
reason to think he can't do it again.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been through a lot of ups and downs. He keeps on a pretty
even keel, and he doesn't let his bad outings affect what he needs to
do."</TE>
<TE>   Against the Dodgers, at least, he does whatever he wants to do. In
four starts against the Dodgers, he is 4-0 with a 1.16 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   "Same old Sele," Grudzielanek said. "He consistently throws
pitches where he wants to. He pitched his regular game, nothing extra
special. He just hit his spots."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels could be excused for wondering why so much hype has
surrounded Ishii, who hit almost none of his spots.</TE>

his other 14 starts, he is 11-2 with a 2.97 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii did himself no favors Saturday, throwing a frighteningly
high number of pitches while struggling to find home plate. He needed
88 pitches to get 11 outs. He gave up nine hits and three walks--and
a wild pitch--in 3 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   His control, rarely good in his first season in the majors, has
wavered between decent and poor. In 95 innings, he has issued 61
walks, the most of any major league pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   Of his 88 pitches Saturday, 40 were balls. Of Sele's 124 pitches,
41 were balls.</TE>
<TE>   When Ishii did throw strikes, the Angels hit them, repeatedly.</TE>
<TE>   "It comes back to bases on balls," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said,
"and situations set up by bases on balls."</TE>

<HD>TRIPLE PLAY</HD>
<DH>No Longer in Vogue, Triples Provide Baseball Fans a Run for
Their Money</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICK FREEMAN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jimmy Rollins led the National League in triples last year and is
leading again this year. He wanted to know: What's the single-season
record?</LD>
<LD>   The answer surprised him.</LD>
<LD>   "Thirty-six triples in a season, huh?" he said. "You might as well
forget about that."</LD>
<TE>   Baseball's record book sometimes seems as if it should be written
in pencil. But there's at least one hitting record that should be
safe in this era of unprecedented power.</TE>
<TE>   No one has come close to Owen Wilson's record of 36 since he set
it in 1912.</TE>
<TE>   Triples are down about 30% from a quarter-century ago, meaning
Wilson's mark doesn't figure to be in jeopardy anytime soon.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Rollins needs reminding. He hit 12 last year, and he has
six so far this season.</TE>
<TE>   The speedy Philadelphia shortstop is a prototypical triples
hitter. And while he could make his second All-Star game in a row,
players such as Rollins aren't in vogue the way bashers are now.</TE>
<TE>   Sluggers such as Barry Bonds draw fans. Sometimes the crowds come
for batting practice, where moonshots are routine.</TE>
<TE>   But even home run king Hank Aaron would rather see a player sprint
around the bases than trot.</TE>
<TE>   "The triple is the most exciting play in baseball," Aaron once
said. "Home runs win a lot of games, but I never understood why fans
are so obsessed with them."</TE>
<TE>   It's not as if ESPN's "Baseball Tonight" shows a daily list of
players who tripled.</TE>
<TE>   "When you go to arbitration, home runs is a big issue," Phillie
Manager Larry Bowa said. "Home runs and RBIs. So I would think home
runs is on everybody's mind in this generation."</TE>
<TE>   Just look at Sammy Sosa.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, as a prospect in the Texas Rangers' system, he actually
led the Florida State League with 12 triples while hitting only nine
home runs.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, as the NL MVP, it was a different story. He hit 66 home
runs--no triples, though.</TE>
<TE>   Strength didn't always trump speed.</TE>
<TE>   Triples outnumbered homers for a long time, even after the end of
the dead ball era.</TE>
<TE>   Back in 1929, two years after Babe Ruth hit 60 homers, there were
still more triples than homers in the AL. The last time that happened
in the NL was 1931.</TE>
<TE>   The long ball has ruled ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota's Cristian Guzman is the lone active player to have hit
20 or more triples in a season. Guzman, Lance Johnson and Willie
Wilson are the only big leaguers to have done it since George Brett
in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller ballparks and bigger outfielders have helped keep triples
rare. So has the near-disappearance of artificial turf.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, a lefty, played at Pittsburgh's Forbes Field, which was
376 feet to right field that year. No current major league park has
such a dimension.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit and Colorado led their leagues in triples last year. Both
teams have home parks with spacious outfields.</TE>
<TE>   "It just doesn't happen very often," Twins Manager Ron Gardenhire
said. "I don't know if you say it's a forgotten art. But you know,
you've got bigger, stronger outfielders who get the ball in quicker.
The ballparks have changed a little bit now, there's not that many
parks that are just huge.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not that many opportunities to hit triples."</TE>
<TE>   Guzman has just two this season. But his knack for getting three
bags hasn't gone unnoticed.</TE>
<TE>   "He pretty much hits them and doesn't plan on stopping,"
Philadelphia's Doug Glanville said. "When it's a double, he's still
not going to stop."</TE>
<TE>   Gardenhire was Guzman's third-base coach before he was his
manager. He's seen plenty of triples happen, literally right in front
of him.</TE>
<TE>   The excitement hasn't worn off yet.</TE>
<TE>   "When they hit a ball in the gap, your heart starts pounding
away," Gardenhire said. "You know they're coming to third base and
you know there's going to be a play."</TE>
<TE>   Rollins feels the same way. He was reduced to sound effects when
he described watching Glanville leg out a triple.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like 'voooosh!' You know?" Rollins said. "He's just hittin'
them corners and it's like an art. It's like an art."</TE>

<KH>GOLF ROUNDUP</KH>
<HD>Pooley (63) Opens Up a Lead</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After the twisting putt rolled into the cup on the 18th hole, Don
Pooley held his club up and flashed a broad smile to the appreciative
gallery.</LD>
<LD>   The 18-footer for par capped a record-setting round of
eight-under-par 63 that thrust Pooley into the lead Saturday after
three rounds of the U.S. Senior Open.</LD>
<LD>   Pooley made an amazing nine birdies at the difficult 7,005-yard
Caves Valley Golf Club in Owings Mills, Md. He set a tournament
record for low score over 18 holes and finished the day at nine-under
204, three shots ahead of Tom Watson and second-round leader Walter
Hall.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of great things happened today," said Pooley, seeking his
first win in a PGA event since the 1987 Memorial. "I hit good shots
at times, I got good bounces at times and obviously putted very well.
It was a fun round to play."</TE>
<TE>   Watson shot a 69, and Hall bogeyed the final two holes for a 72.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Dougherty made five birdies en route to a 68 that left him four
shots back, and Tom Kite was at 209 after a wild 73 that included
five bogeys and a double bogey.</TE>
<TE>   R.W. Eaks continued his swoon after his opening 64, following a 73
Friday with a 78 that dropped him out of contention.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Glen Hnatiuk, who had never had a lead in a PGA tournament before
this week, proved he can protect one, shooting a third consecutive
six-under 65 that kept him atop the leaderboard with a four-stroke
margin after three rounds of the St. Jude Classic at Memphis, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   Hnatiuk put himself in position to win his first title
wire-to-wire with an eight-birdie, two-bogey round that gave him an
18-under 195 total.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, I'm happy with the position I'm in. I don't know how
to react because I've never been in this position with any kind of
lead. I'm looking forward to it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Notah Begay, enjoying his best tournament since a back injury
essentially wiped out his 2001 season, shot a 68 and was tied at 14
under with Tim Petrovic (66) and Matt Kuchar (67). Pat Bates (69) was
five strokes back.</TE>
<TE>   David Toms (65), Tripp Isenhour (64) and Neal Lancaster (64) were
tied at 12-under 201.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody in that pack has a chance to win I suppose," Hnatiuk
said. "If I let it."</TE>
<TE>   Hnatiuk's best finish since joining the tour in 1998 was a tie for
third at the 2000 B.C. Open, and he noted he played in the last group
on Saturday and was next-to-last on Sunday in that event. He tied for
eighth at Kemper earlier this month and has five top-25 finishes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to do anything stupid, not going to take any crazy
chances. But I still have to go on, go forward," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Begay, who chased down the leader in three of his four victories,
said Hnatiuk will have to deal with nerves. Hnatiuk currently ranks
99th on the money list with $341,192 in earnings, and the winner of
this tournament will take home a $684,000 check.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a fact of life," Begay said. "Everybody who's won,
who's been there, knows that. Now it just depends on how Glen handles
it. He handled it great today. It didn't look like it affected him in
the least.... We're sort of going to be chasing a rabbit."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Juli Inkster birdied five of the last six holes after a blowup on
the 13th tee and took a one-shot lead heading into the final round of
the ShopRite LPGA Classic at Galloway Township, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   First-round leader Kate Golden was in second place after a double
bogey on No. 17, and Annika Sorenstam was again threatening after a
second-round 67 left her three shots off the lead in this final
tuneup for next week's U.S. Women's Open.</TE>
<TE>   Six players were within three shots of Inkster, who had a 67 for a
two-round total of 10-under 132.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Hurst was in third place at eight under, and Sorenstam was in
a group at seven under with Jenny Lidback and Lorie Kane.</TE>
<TE>   Inkster began her surge after spiking her iron into the grass on
the 13th hole.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I have to vent," said Inkster, who has six top-10
finishes and a victory this year.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>World Boxing Organization heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko
retained his title Saturday night, stopping 41-year-old Ray Mercer in
the sixth round of a scheduled 12-rounder at Atlantic City, N.J.</LD>
<LD>   The up-and-coming Ukrainian (39-1) knocked down Mercer in the
first round and cut him in the fifth, using a powerful left jab that
kept the rugged Mercer on the defensive throughout.</LD>
<LD>   In the sixth, Klitschko backed Mercer into the ropes and unloaded
a hard right hand that snapped Mercer's head back and seemed to take
the fight out of him.</LD>
<TE>   Mercer (30-5-1) moved to the other rope but when Klitschko
unloaded another flurry of punches and the blood streamed down
Mercer's face. Referee Randy Neumann stepped in, ending it at 1:08 of
the round.</TE>
<TE>   "I got beat, fair and square," Mercer said.</TE>

<TE>   Ron Francis signed a two-year, $11-million contract extension with
the Carolina Hurricanes less than 48 hours before the 39-year-old
captain could have become an unrestricted free agent.</TE>
<TE>   Francis, who made $5 million a year the last four seasons with the
Hurricanes, will earn $5.5 million in each of the next two seasons
after leading Carolina to the Stanley Cup finals for the first time
in franchise history.</TE>

<TE>   Belfour will be an unrestricted free agent Monday, and the Stars
already announced they had no plans to re-sign the 37-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   If the Predators also don't sign Belfour, they would be entitled
to a compensatory draft pick.</TE>

<DL>YOKOHAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>Be The Reds? We did that for a while, being red and seeing red for as
long as we could stand, until the Germans, as usual, stopped by to
ruin the party.</LD>
<LD>   Welcome to Blue Heaven? We spent some time there too, taking
notes, filing away a scouting report. Did you know that in the
afterlife, people dye their hair blond and neon red, eat lots of
sushi and take flying headers off river bridges when one of them
scores against Tunisia?</LD>
<LD>   Along the way, we also scoped out an Italian diving competition, a
Senegalese witch doctor convention, an Irish bagpipe concert, a
Belgian tie factory--most popular item: 1 to 1--and a monthlong
Turkey feast with all the trimmings.</LD>
<TE>   And then the rains came and cold water splashed across our faces
and when we finally snapped to, whom did we spot in the final?</TE>
<TE>   Brazil and Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Of course.</TE>
<TE>   This did much to placate Brazilian sponsor Nike, German sponsor
Adidas, the FIFA power bases of South America and Europe, the host of
the 2006 World Cup (Germany, again) and the many soccer purists who
pay the dollars, euros, yen and won that keep the wheels of world
soccer greased and spinning.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, South Korea, Japan and soccer columnists are left with
the clean-up.</TE>
<TE>   Anybody know a good sweeper?</TE>
<TE>   The 2002 World Cup, on a fast rewind:</TE>
<TE>   Best team: Was there one? It was supposed to have been France or
Argentina, but they went home before Belgium did. Italy could have
been, but--how to put this in 2,000 words or less?--the Italians have
issues. Spain? Needs to work on penalties. Portugal? Needed to play
more games against Jeff Agoos. Brazil? Germany? Sure, they made the
final, but their best teams came and left years ago.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea and Senegal fell short in the knockout phase, but
played soccer the way we'd all like it to be played. The Koreans went
all out, full throttle, never easing off the pedal even when it might
have benefited them--as in the Portugal game, when a 1-0 loss would
have meant a better second-round draw (Mexico) for South Korea, which
decided instead to play to win, did, and wound up drawing Italy.</TE>
<TE>   In a tournament dragged down by too much negative soccer, Senegal
was the World Cup's leading source of positive energy. Every move was
a dance step. Every goal was a festival. Every move made by Coach
Bruno Metsu was the right one, except for a hairstyle that left him
looking like soccer's answer to Yanni. And no one was asking the
question.</TE>
<TE>   Worst team: Saudi Arabia lost by eight goals to Germany, case
closed, right? Actually, the Saudis recovered from that hopeless
opener to play reasonably well against Cameroon and Ireland. China,
however, lost by scores of 2-0, 3-0 and 4-0, looking totally
overmatched. Miracle worker no more, Coach Bora Milutinovic was last
seen sprinting for the exit door before the final Chinese jersey was
exchanged.</TE>
<TE>   Best goal: With apologies to Agoos' crackling own-goal against
Portugal--brilliantly taken--this one goes to Senegal again. Salif
Diao scored it, against Denmark, but it was a full-field team effort:
tackle and outlet pass by Henri Camara, back-heeled flick by El Hadji
Diof, sweeping midfield pass by Diao, fast-breaking run and dish by
Khalilou Fadigo to an onrushing Diao, who looked in one direction and
finished in the other. Four interlocking pieces, none of them easy,
but the Lions made it look like a jog in the park.</TE>
<TE>   Quickest goal: Turkey's Hakan Suker played 500 minutes without
scoring once. Then South Korea kicked off Saturday's third-place
match. Back pass, Suker intercepts, Suker scores. Elapsed time:
Eleven seconds. Reaction from Turkey: Where was this when we really
needed it?</TE>
<TE>   Best disallowed goal: Christian Vieri against Croatia. Or Filippo
Inzaghi against Mexico. Or Damiano Tommasi against South Korea. Not
that anyone in Italy is counting.</TE>
<TE>   Best goal celebration: Nigeria scored only once in the tournament,
in a 2-1 loss to Sweden, which perhaps explains how and why Julius
Aghahowa set an individual World Cup record with six post-goal
somersaults and one no-hands backflip. The coach of Nigeria's
gymnastics team was so impressed, he wanted to know if Aghahowa was
interested in a tryout.</TE>
<TE>   Runner-up: South Korea's Ahn Jung Hwan short-grass speedskating
routine against the United States. Assist: Apolo Anton Ohno, four
months earlier in Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Best match: South Korea-Italy in the second round. Superb goals
taken. Superb goals disallowed. Overtime. Over the top. Upset
winners. And, as you might have heard, upset losers as well.</TE>
<TE>   Worst match: Germany-Paraguay in the second round. Two teams
bunkered in, the numbing inertia interrupted only by Oliver
Neuville's merciful goal in the 88th minute. The Germans may have
reached the final, against long odds, but they still have so much to
answer for.</TE>
<TE>   Biggest gaffe (field players' division): Christian Panucci, Italy.
It's an altogether different tournament--much less noisy, anyway--if
Panucci clears that ball in the 88th minute against South Korea
instead of half-chesting it, half-juggling it and completely losing
it to Seol Ki-Hyeon, setting up an out-of-nowhere equalizer and so
much Italian angst in its wake. On this much, the English have it
right. Hoof it out of there, lad!</TE>
<TE>   Biggest gaffe (goalkeepers' division): On the other hand, the
English have other problems. Brazil's Ronaldinho broke a 1-1
quarterfinal tie with England by catching David Seaman off his line
and unsuspecting, lobbing over Seaman from 30 yards and knocking
England out of the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Biggest gaffe (coaches division): Mexico's Javier Aguirre was
hitting all the right buttons until the second round, when the United
States scored first against Mexico, taking the ball down Ramon
Morales' side of the field. Losing either his patience or his cool,
Aguirre quickly pulled Morales from the game and replaced him,
inexplicably, with 33-year-old Luis Hernandez. Aguirre then watched
Hernandez take 11 touches of the ball, losing it 10 times in a 2-0
Mexico defeat. Galaxy fans could have told him.</TE>
<TE>   Hand ball that wasn't: Aguirre did not go quietly into the Seoul
airport. He complained that the Mexicans were robbed by a hand
ball-in-the-box by American John O'Brien that went uncalled. U.S.
goalkeeper Brad Friedel had a very good look at the play. "Great
header, wasn't it?" Friedel said with a grin.</TE>
<TE>   Hand ball that wasn't, the sequel: Then, the Americans advanced to
the quarterfinal against Germany, where they lost, 1-0, after Gregg
Berhalter's shot struck Torsten Frings on the left forearm, on the
goal line, and no hand-ball was called. Subtitle: You win some, you
lose some.</TE>
<TE>   Ugliest Americans: In an upset, the Italians. They lose to Croatia
and they cry FIFA conspiracy. They tie Mexico and Vieri nearly
crushes the Mexican defender Rafael Marquez's Adam's apple with a
vicious elbow to the throat. They lose to South Korea on a goal by
Ahn Jung-Hwan and the president of Ahn's Italian League club,
Perugia, slurs Ahn and vows to cut him, calling the Korean "the man
who ruined Italian football." So Italy missed the late stages of the
World Cup. Can't say the feeling was mutual.</TE>
<TE>   Do unto others as you'd have them do unto you: So what did Marquez
learn from that unsightly incident with Vieri? Not much,
unfortunately. When it became obvious Mexico would lose its next
match, to the archrival Americans, Marquez decided it was time to
head-butt Cobi Jones while cleating him from behind. Marquez ended an
otherwise admirable tournament with a sorry red card and an
accompanying four-game suspension.</TE>
<TE>   Best uniform: Spain. The Spaniards looked very stylish missing
their penalty kicks.</TE>
<TE>   Worst uniform: Slovenia over Croatia in a shootout. We've seen
Croatia and their tablecloths-with-sleeves before. The checkered
republic. But where did Slovenia dig up those forest green and white
zig-zag disasters, a garage sale in downtown Ljubljana? I see
better-looking jerseys every week in the Long Beach Men's Soccer
League.</TE>
<TE>   Most intriguing hairstyle:  Nigerian defender Taribo West's rather
unusual double antler/antennae look. It makes you wonder: How's the
radio reception?</TE>
<TE>   Runner-up: Ronaldo and whatever that is on the top of his
forehead. A crescent moon? An Egyptian pyramid? An ever-ready mouse
pad for his hand-held personal computer?</TE>
<TE>   Most valuable player: Oliver Kahn, Germany. That jaw. That
forehead. Those sideburns. Those hands. Where would Germany have been
without him? In Germany, watching the United States in the
semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Most outrageous scenario:  The United States in the semifinals. It
almost happened, as incredible as it still sounds nine days later.
The outlook wouldn't have been particularly promising, not with Eddie
Pope, Pablo Mastroeni and Berhalter due to miss the semifinal with
double-yellow card suspensions. Still, as one 50-year-old U.S. writer
put it, "I can't believe I'm actually talking about this, this early
in my life."</TE>

<HD>Thank You, Masked Man</HD>
<DH>When Roseboro needs his Dodger friends most, they are there
for him</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What Juan Marichal's bat couldn't do, the fury of two blood clots
did.</LD>
<LD>   There lay the toughest Los Angeles Dodger catcher two weeks ago,
the sudden victim of two strokes, barely able to speak, still trying
to call the game.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm done," John Roseboro mumbled to his wife and daughter. "I'm
done."</LD>
<TE>   Three years with a failing heart had sapped his strength. Three
years of seclusion in his basement had flat-lined his perspective.
This latest squealing ride to Cedars-Sinai had stolen his will.</TE>
<TE>   Once the emotional core of a Dodger team that was beloved by
millions, John Roseboro, 69, had quit, surrounded by a cheering
section that numbered two.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to leave us," said his wife, Barbara Fouch-Roseboro.
"This was the end."</TE>
<TE>   Then it wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   Something blocked the catcher's path.</TE>
<TE>   The doctors say it was science. His family believes it was 1960s
Dodger chemistry.</TE>
<TE>   Those teammates from whom he had hidden in embarrassment over his
feebleness were contacted by a stubborn wife who decided her husband
needed their love.</TE>
<TE>   And so they emerged from the shadows with a dugout full of it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was everybody he had once stood up for, standing up for him,"
Barbara said.</TE>
<TE>   It was Peter O'Malley sending prayers over a cell phone. It was
Tommy Davis sending messages through a nurse's station. It was Maury
Wills on one line, Sandy Koufax on the other.</TE>
<TE>   It was thoughts and strength from some of this franchise's most
glorious moments.</TE>
<TE>   And even one of their darkest.</TE>
<TE>   John Roseboro's cry for help eventually spanned a continent,
reaching a phone in the Dominican Republic.</TE>
<TE>   "Please tell John to hang on," Juan Marichal said. "Please tell
him I'm praying for him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Today John Roseboro is still hospitalized, still suffering from a
failing heart and stroke-impeded speech.</TE>
<TE>   But his condition is stable. And after three years of hiding, he
is again among friends.</TE>
<TE>   "An amazing thing, against the odds, he's still hanging in there,"
Barbara said between calls on her cell phone in the hospital
cafeteria. "And I think I know why."</TE>
<TE>   Koufax sent a quip:</TE>
<TE>   "Tell John he didn't make much sense even before the stroke."</TE>
<TE>   Wills sent a memory:</TE>
<TE>   "Daryl Spencer, a hard-nosed player, trying to score on a fly
ball, John didn't just tag him, he picked him up and carried him over
to the dugout and dropped him inside."</TE>
<TE>   Marichal sent a bombshell:</TE>
<TE>   "What John did for me, I will never forget."</TE>
<TE>   It was supposed to be the other way around.</TE>
<TE>   What Marichal did to Roseboro at Candlestick Park on Aug. 22,
1965, was something that Roseboro was never supposed to forget.</TE>
<TE>   Irritated that Marichal had brushed back two of his fellow Dodger
hitters that day, Roseboro retaliated while Marichal was batting.</TE>
<TE>   After catching an inside fastball from Koufax, he directed his
return throw near Marichal's face, allegedly nicking his ear while
the ball whizzed past his nose.</TE>
<TE>   Marichal spun and began beating Roseboro's head with the bat,
raising a giant lump and causing a two-inch gash from which blood
poured down his face.</TE>
<TE>   It was the most violent incident in Dodger history and the most
heated moment of one of baseball's best rivalries.</TE>
<TE>   It was also the defining moment of Roseboro's career.</TE>
<TE>   But for reasons you'd never imagine.</TE>
<TE>   Seventeen years later, after failing to be elected to the Hall of
Fame in his first two years of eligibility, Marichal was worried that
voters were biased against him because of the incident.</TE>
<TE>   So he phoned Roseboro, who had barely spoken to him since that
game.</TE>
<TE>   According to Roseboro's wife, the conversation went like this.</TE>
<TE>   "John, are you still mad?"</TE>
<TE>   "No."</TE>
<TE>   "John, I need your help."</TE>
<TE>   Marichal wanted Roseboro to publicly forgive him, hopefully
convincing voters that he should be allowed into the Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   "John couldn't see any reason not to forgive," Barbara said. "He
wanted the pain of that day to go away."</TE>
<TE>   Roseboro not only agreed, he flew to the Dominican Republic to
play in Marichal's golf tournament and show the baseball world that
they were friends.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of months later, in 1983, Marichal phoned again.</TE>
<TE>   This time, he was crying.</TE>
<TE>   "He had just been elected to the Hall of Fame, and all he could
say was, 'Thank you, thank you, thank you,' " Barbara said.</TE>
<TE>   Reached by phone about Roseboro's illness last week, Marichal's
voice broke again.</TE>
<TE>   "A wonderful, wonderful man," he said. "I have long ago forgiven
him, and I really hope he has truly forgiven me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In a Dodger culture that once dubbed dour Burt Hooton as "Happy,"
and gentle Orel Hershiser as "Bulldog," it was only fitting that John
Roseboro was known as "Gabby."</TE>
<TE>   He spoke very little. He was never really heard.</TE>
<TE>   "John was lost in the shuffle," Wills said.</TE>
<TE>   Playing for the Dodgers from 1957 through '67, Roseboro spent some
of their flashiest seasons gratefully hidden by a mask.</TE>
<TE>   He made three All-Star teams for the Dodgers, but their most
renowned position player during that time was Wills.</TE>
<TE>   Roseboro had two game-winning hits in two World Series triumphs,
but the most valuable player of both series was Koufax.</TE>
<TE>   "Rosie never got the acclaim," Wills said. "But then, he never
wanted it."</TE>
<TE>   It's coming now, thick and deep, like that three-run homer against
Whitey Ford that set the Dodgers up for a four-game sweep of the New
York Yankees in 1963.</TE>
<TE>   So you think Mike Piazza was Los Angeles' greatest catcher?</TE>
<TE>   "To me, John Roseboro was the catcher," Koufax said. "With him out
there, I felt like I was never alone."</TE>
<TE>   Koufax recalled a time when he wanted to go against a scouting
report and throw a certain pitch, the sort of unexpected pitch that
led to his greatness.</TE>
<TE>   But he didn't have enough confidence to throw it if Roseboro
called for something else.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had to shake my head to get to it, I wasn't throwing it," he
said. "But then I looked in, and John's hands came down, and there it
was, that pitch, and I thought, 'Wow, he knows me.' "</TE>
<TE>   And to those who think more celebrated catchers such as Steve
Yeager and Mike Scioscia were Los Angeles' toughest?</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody was tougher than Rosie, because if Don [Drysdale] didn't
take care of you, Rosie would," Wills said.</TE>
<TE>   He remembers hearing Roseboro actually plotting to hit Marichal
with a return throw during the infamous Giant game.</TE>
<TE>   "But then at the last moment, he decided he couldn't do it, and
just buzzed him," Wills said. "But he was a guy who always had your
back."</TE>
<TE>   Yet when Roseboro needed to somebody to watch his back? He was too
proud to ask.</TE>
<TE>   So as his health began declining several years ago, so did his
visibility.</TE>
<TE>   For a couple of seasons in the mid-1990s, he worked for the
National League as an umpire evaluator. But as a heart condition and
prostate cancer softened his body, he was embarrassed to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   "He would go to the games, sit down the line on the loge level,
and not look or talk to anybody," Wills said. "People would shout his
name and he would ignore them.</TE>
<TE>   "I finally had to come down and get in his face and say, 'Look,
it's me, let's talk.' "</TE>
<TE>   They talked on that day, but few others.</TE>
<TE>   "When I left him sitting there, he became motionless again,
staring straight ahead," Wills said. "I know what it's like when you
don't want anybody to see you. I've been there. And he was like
that."</TE>
<TE>   When Roseboro was put on a heart transplant waiting list in 1999,
only to be taken off the list when his prostate cancer returned, he
went into full hiding.</TE>
<TE>   His haven became a windowless basement of his Bel-Air home, a room
draped with Dodger memorabilia.</TE>
<TE>   There are framed baseball cards and photos on the walls. There are
old uniforms draped over a couch.</TE>
<TE>   There are used bats in a giant vase, old gloves in a bookcase,
even jerseys and pants and socks in blue duffel bags.</TE>
<TE>   If the Dodgers needed a pinch-hitter, the aging, infirm star was
ready.</TE>
<TE>   "He never stopped being a Dodger," Barbara said.</TE>
<TE>   He would watch the Dodger games from behind his desk, shouting at
the television, fuming at the work habits of the modern player.</TE>
<TE>   He was, for a time, employed by a company that paid him to take
phone calls from fans.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd be on that phone for a couple of hours every day," Barbara
said. "Even though every call was about Juan Marichal."</TE>
<TE>   On June 13, Barbara found him sitting on his bed, unable to speak.</TE>
<TE>   For the 51st time since 1988, she rushed him to the emergency
room.</TE>
<TE>   But as she later learned, for the first time, an era of Dodger
baseball came with her.</TE>
<TE>   "People use the word 'family,' but I think of it more as
'friends,' " O'Malley said. "And friends lean on each other in hard
times."</TE>
<TE>   There is talk these days that the current Dodgers, with their
great pitching and smart hitting, are reminiscent of those 1960s
Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   It's going to take more than that.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever you write, please write that I love John Roseboro,"
Tommy Davis said. "We all do."</TE>

<LD>Some notes, observations and a genuine "I told you so" rant and rave
from Dodger Manager Jim Tracy as I begin a two-week vacation fishing
with Mike Garrett.</LD>
<LD>   I just hope he got my invitation.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   THIS WHOLE business about Laker broadcaster Chick Hearn being too
old, goofing up parade introductions--maybe it is time for a
change--hits a little too close to home. We've learned, as a staff,
to make allowances with sports editor Bill Dwyre, and while it's true
and he forgets himself at times referring to Plaschke, Adande, Pucin
and myself as "Matthew, Mark, Lucy and John," he's still the best in
the business the four hours a day when he shows up to work.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Sunderland might one day replace Chick, and while he's a
little too serious for my taste, he did a fine job in Chick's place
while Chick was on the mend.</TE>
<TE>   But I still want Chick behind the microphone, occasionally telling
me that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar just threw in a hook when I know it had
to be Shaquille O'Neal, and sounding at times as if the Lakers are
never going to win again. Shoot, on his worst days, he's still more
lucid than Dwyre on his best days, and we're not complaining.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IT APPEARS the Angels have given up on starter Scott Schoeneweis,
parking him in the bullpen. "I still think he's going to be a good
major league starter," Manager Mike Scioscia said. He just didn't say
with which team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BY HIS own account, "I embarrassed myself" last year, Dodger
infielder Alex Cora said, but check the fine print: Cora is someone
who obviously does not quit. Despite Dodger pronouncements he'd be
competing for his job, the team handed the shortstop position to
Cesar Izturis, who has been a marvel with the glove, and a .237
hitter. Cora is batting .316, and might become attractive trade bait,
giving him the chance to start elsewhere, a reward for hanging tough.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KAZUHISA ISHII pulled a Phil Jackson and probably played himself
right out of the All-Star game. Odalis Perez, tonight's starter, now
looks Milwaukee-bound.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ERIC KARROS was hitting .300 when he came to bat in the ninth, and
I thought I might have to delay my vacation to stay and get him back
above .300 if he failed to hit safely. But I could tell he wanted me
to go; he singled.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I BUMPED into Alonso Aguirre, jockey Laffit Pincay's brother, at
Hollywood Park, and he said he was an Angel fan. That's the first one
I've ever met. He has been walking around with his head shaved ever
since 1995 because he bet the Angels would make the playoffs after
they went up by 12 games in August, and when they lost, he lost his
hair.</TE>
<TE>   Some people say Laffit's horses run scared, and faster after
getting a look at a bald Aguirre, which might explain Pincay's
incredible success.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ERIC GAGNE gives credit to Jesse Orosco and Paul Lo Duca for
helping him be so successful. For example, he had Darin Erstad 3-1 in
the ninth inning Friday night, and Lo Duca called for a fastball and
Gagne shook his head, so Lo Duca agreed to have him throw a changeup.
Orosco later told Gagne he admired him for "not being scared" to
throw the change. Erstad eventually struck out.</TE>
<TE>   "I learn so much from these guys; getting to play baseball only
two months a year in Montreal, there's so much I don't know," Gagne
said. In fact, right now he doesn't even know how good he is.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN I joked with Tracy, asking him if he was counting on Darren
Dreifort being ready to pitch in the playoffs, Ken Gurnick, the
Dodger reporter for mlb.com, reacted as if he was being paid to
protect Tracy from any tomfoolery in these serious baseball times.
Gurnick huffed, "It's still June." Wait until Monday, he won't be
able to say that.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   REMEMBER, I just report the facts. This comes by way of e-mail and
apparently was lifted from a San Diego newspaper. At a recent event,
Charger linebacker Junior Seau was introduced at the dedication of a
new park, which Seau's foundation funded in part. Someone suggested
linebacker Dick Butkus knew where an opposing ballcarrier was going
because he could read lips, and asked Seau if he did the same thing.
Seau said, no. "Everybody should know that I can't read because,
remember, I went to USC."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW THAT the World Cup is over, you might wonder if there is
anything that can match the excitement. How about Feliciano Lopez
versus Andre Sa? That's men's tennis at Wimbledon. Had I told you
those two would be fighting for the pole in next week's CART race,
you probably would have bought that too.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'LL NEED a two-week vacation before getting to work and turning
around Adrian Beltre's season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AFTER PLAYING the role of sheepish nice guy until now, Tracy made
sure the media knew it was very dumb in its preseason assessment, and
the Dodgers were very smart in almost every decision made going into
this season. And when Tracy really got rolling, he went all the way
back to the time when he was hired and reminded everyone of their
predictions that he wouldn't last, and look at him now.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, Tracy might have sounded like former GM Kevin
Malone for a day, but he still hasn't lasted as long as Malone. I
like his chances, but as he suggested, I've been wrong before.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from S &amp; R:</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since they found those hookers on that golf course in Norco,
it seems you're always out on assignment golfing. What's up with
that?"</TE>
<TE>   I never realized how much fun a threesome could be.</TE>

<HD>For Henman, It's Win by Decision</HD>
<DH>Wimbledon: He beats Ferreira in third round after getting
favorable overrule by chair umpire at crucial point.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WIMBLEDON, England</DL>
<LD>Tim Henman needed a little help from his British friends, and
apparently a good portion of the crowded house at Centre Court wasn't
quite enough Saturday at Wimbledon.</LD>
<LD>   There was one other person who helped make the difference.
Unfortunately for Henman's opponent, Wayne Ferreira of South Africa,
that individual was sitting in the umpire's chair. A key overrule at
a crucial juncture by chair umpire Jorge Dias of Portugal assisted
the fourth-seeded Henman in the third-set tiebreaker on his way to a
stirring 7-6 (6), 3-6, 7-6 (8), 6-1 third-round victory over
Ferreira.</LD>
<LD>   Ferreira was ahead, 4-1, in the third-set tiebreaker when he
struck what looked to be a mis-hit winner, clipping the baseline and
sideline, far away from the chair umpire on the other side. It was
called good by both line judges, and their judgment appeared accurate
according to television replays. Henman, animated, looked at the line
judges and signaled that the ball was out.</LD>
<TE>   Dias overruled, and it was somewhat reminiscent of his critical
overrule in the fifth set of the U.S. Open quarterfinal between Andy
Roddick and Lleyton Hewitt. An angry Roddick called Dias "a moron."
But the difference was that Hewitt didn't work the official to get
the call.</TE>
<TE>   Ferreira said that the episode was "shocking." He said Henman
intimidated the chair umpire by his action. The British player went
on to win the riveting 15-minute tiebreaker, 10-8, taking it on his
seventh set point.</TE>
<TE>   "He was showing out, showing a finger, acting like it was out,"
Ferreira said of Henman's reaction to the call. "I don't blame him
for it, no, not at all. But the umpire gets paid. He's a
professional. Shouldn't let things happen like that.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's shocking. There's absolutely nothing I can do about
[it]. But if he [Dias] had any decency, I think he would have at
least come and apologized."</TE>
<TE>   Said Henman: "I think my gut reaction at the time was that it was
out, but I'm sure that had a lot of hope to do with it."</TE>
<TE>   Ferreira admitted he too might have tried to influence the
official. Since the call made the tiebreaker 4-2 instead of 5-1, it
would have helped if the overrule had looked decisive, Ferreira said.
And it seemed to be forgotten that overrules are supposed to be of an
obvious error.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, he hemmed and hawed about it being close, touching the
side, but maybe long," Ferreira said of Dias. "He wasn't really sure.
I think it was a total intimidation thing. I think he realized he
made a mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Even on British TV, one commentator said that Ferreira was robbed.
Jim Courier added on TNT: "A little home cooking right there."</TE>
<TE>   Henman needed some luck and circumstance to reach the fourth
round. He kept serving to Ferreira's backhand, the stronger side, and
took something off his first serve, not wanting to go for the big
one, preferring to go for the set-up. Ferreira came close to winning
the match in straight sets but squandered two set points in the
first-set tiebreaker.</TE>
<TE>   The atmosphere for their match was boisterous. Ferreira had a
great deal of support from South Africans who live here. "Best
atmosphere I think I ever played in," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Henman: "There were a lot of times I wasn't sure I was
playing at home or Wayne was playing at home."</TE>
<TE>   Next for Henman is Michel Kratochvil of Switzerland in the fourth
round, and if he gets past him, the potential quarterfinal opponents
are Feliciano Lopez of Spain or Andre Sa of Brazil. Yes, the draw has
opened for Henman, if you like understatement.</TE>
<TE>   Someone asked Henman: "If they told you the eve of Wimbledon to
get to [your] fourth semifinal, you would have to beat Kratochvil,
Lopez and Sa, would you have signed?"</TE>
<TE>   Henman, smiled, saying: "Yeah."</TE>
<TE>   The wreckage of the first week in the men's draw has resulted in
three Australians among the final 16 survivors--No. 1 Hewitt, Wayne
Arthurs and Mark Philippoussis--two Brits, Henman and Greg Rusedski,
and two Dutch players, Richard Krajicek and Sjeng Schalken.</TE>
<TE>   And no Americans. For the first time since 1922, there are no
American men in the final 16 at Wimbledon. Schalken took out the
final one, lucky loser Jeff Morrison, 6-4, 7-6 (7), 6-0, in the third
round, fighting off three set points in the tiebreaker.</TE>
<TE>   "This has probably been the best week of my tennis career," said
Morrison, who was making his Wimbledon debut. "To do what I did and
to put myself in position to play today in the third round at
Wimbledon, beat Juan Carlos Ferrero on Centre Court at Wimbledon is a
dream of mine. Now I'll just have to build on that and have a good
rest of the summer."</TE>
<TE>   He was asked about the state of the men's game in the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there is anything wrong with it," he said. "There's
a great group of young guys that are up and coming. And I think
people are getting a little impatient. And, you have Andy [Roddick],
James [Blake] and Robby Ginepri, Mardy Fish, myself, Taylor Dent and
all those guys are right on the verge of cracking the top 100. When
we do that no one will be talking about that anymore."</TE>

<LD>If you've never thought of vacationing in Palm Springs in the
scorching summer, think again. How does a villa for $59 per night
sound? At the Marquis Villas Resort, rated three diamonds by AAA,
that's what you pay if you stay five nights. If you stay for four
nights, it's $69 per night; for three nights, it's $79 per night; for
two nights it's $89; and for one night it's $99. For that you get a
main room (with sleeper sofa), a bedroom, a private balcony and a
kitchen. The villas, which sleep four to six, command up to $225 per
night in the winter season. The rate is for weekdays only, Sunday to
Thursday nights, through Sept. 30 and is subject to availability. The

<HD>Historic Buildings Get New Life as Hotels in Capital</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This has been a busy month for hotel openings across the U.S. Some
major ones:</LD>
<LD>   * Washington, D.C.: One of the capital's most historic landmarks,
the 1842 General Post Office Building, has been revived as the Hotel
Monaco Washington D.C. It was the city's first all-marble structure,
and it squats on an entire city block at 700 F St., N.W., near the
National Portrait Gallery. Kimpton Hotel &amp; Restaurant Group put $35
million into renovations after signing a lease in 1999 with the
federal General Services Administration.</LD>
<LD>   The hotel will have 184 rooms (140 were open last week), a
174-seat restaurant (opening July 9) and a ballroom with domed
skylight. San Francisco architect Michael Stanton designed the
conversion; Cheryl Rowley of Beverly Hills did the interiors.
Introductory weekend rates, through Sept. 8, start at $179. (877)
202-5411, www.kimptongroup.com.</LD>
<TE>   The 237-room Sofitel Lafayette Square, near the White House,
recycles another historic place, a 1920s Art Moderne former office
building that was known as the Shoreham. It includes a 60-seat French
restaurant and bar. Introductory rates, through Sept. 3, including
breakfast, start at $179. (800) 763-4835, www.sofitel.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Boston: A new hotel built from the ground up is a rarity in this
lodging-starved city. The Nine Zero, which opened at 90 Tremont St.
near Boston Common, adds 190 rooms to the mix. The brick-facade,
19-story building, managed by Destination Hotels &amp; Resorts, includes
a 72-seat Provencal-style restaurant and bar. Introductory rates,
through Sept. 4, start at $290. (866) 646-3937,
www.ninezerohotel.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Orlando, Fla., area: This tourist mecca has three new hotels. By
far the most flamboyant is Loews' giant Royal Pacific Resort at
Universal Orlando, which sprawls over 53 acres and has 1,000 rooms; a
12,000-square-foot pool (the largest in Orlando, say the hotel's
operators); five restaurants and bars (not all are open yet); and
tropical landscaping with waterfalls, palm trees and orchids. Room
rates begin at $159. (800) 232-7827, www.loewshotels.com.</TE>
<TE>   The 400-room Crowne Plaza Orlando Universal, a mile west of
Universal Studios at 7800 Universal Blvd., includes a restaurant,
cafe and bar, and a pool. Introductory rates, through Dec. 31, start
at $85. (866) 864-8627, www.crowneplaza.com/universalfla.</TE>
<TE>   The 304-room Orlando Marriott-Lake Mary, 1501 International
Parkway, is about 25 miles from the Orlando airport. It has a
"contemporary American" restaurant featuring local produce, a bar and
a pool. Introductory rates, through July 31, start at $99. (800)
228-9290, www.marriott.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Chicago: The prism-shaped, glass-sheathed Sofitel Chicago Water
Tower at 30 E. Chestnut St., designed by French architect Jean-Paul
Viguier, soars 32 stories above the Magnificent Mile area. It has 415
rooms, a cafe, a Mediterranean restaurant (opening in September)--and
croissants baked on the premises. Introductory rates, through August,
start at $159. (800) 763-4835, www.sofitel.com.</TE>

<LD>Starting Wednesday a 1297 copy of the Magna Carta that is usually at
the National Archives in Washington, D.C., will be displayed at the
visitor center at Independence National Historic Park in
Philadelphia. The milestone English document, laying out key civil
rights, is expected to remain there at least through spring 2003
while the National Archives room is renovated.... A road over Shasta
Dam north of Redding, Calif., that has been closed since the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks is now open with restrictions, the Bureau of
Reclamation said. Travelers must apply for permits at least 72 hours
before arrival. The forms are available online at www.mp.usbr.gov, at
the dam security office and at the Shasta-Trinity National Recreation
Area office. Information: (530) 275-4253.... Sandals Resort
International is scheduled to open its sixth Beaches resort, the
Beaches Boscobel Resort &amp; Golf Club, on Monday in Ocho Rios, Jamaica.
Rates start at $255 per person per night. Unlike the company's
couples-only Sandals line, Beaches resorts cater to families or to
adults with children 18 and older. (800) 232-2437, www.beaches.com.</LD>

<HD>JetBlue Begins Program for Frequent Fliers</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Low-fare airline JetBlue has begun a frequent-flier program called
TrueBlue. It offers points instead of miles, based on flight length.
A round-trip cross-country flight, such as between Long Beach and
Dulles in suburban Washington, is 12 points. It takes 100 points to
earn a free round trip. The points expire after a year. Through Dec.
31, fliers who book through www.jetblue.com earn double points,
enabling them to almost--but not quite--earn a free flight with four
coast-to-coast round trips.</LD>

<HD>American Airlines to End Paper Tickets Next Year</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>American Airlines plans to stop issuing paper tickets by March for
domestic trips and by December 2003 for all other trips.</LD>
<LD>   Although most major airlines impose fees for issuing paper
tickets, American appears to be the first to announce that it will
eliminate such tickets. Starting last week, American also raised its
paper-ticket fee from $10 to $20. "It's costly to generate paper,"
spokesman Todd Burke said. The fee is charged on routes on which
e-tickets are available. Burke said about two-thirds of American's
tickets are electronic.</LD>

<KH>Weekend Escape</KH>
<HD>A Channel Islands-Hopping Adventure</HD>
<DH>Santa Rosa by plane, Anacapa by boat-- no matter the
conveyance, the national park pleases</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSEMARY McCLURE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHANNEL ISLANDS NATIONAL PARK</DL>
<LD>We had been flying over water for about 20 minutes when the fog
suddenly cleared and Santa Rosa Island appeared, its hills golden in
the morning sunlight. The tiny plane banked and leveled out to land.
As it eased down, a dirt runway came into view, filling the cockpit
window in front of us. Then we were on the ground, gently bumping
along the makeshift landing strip.</LD>
<LD>   The pilot shut down the engines, and there was silence. For just a
moment.</LD>
<LD>   "Twenty-six miles across the sea," warbled a friend from the seat
behind me, "Santa Catalina is a-waiting for me ... "</LD>
<TE>   "Wrong island," another friend scoffed, cutting him off.</TE>
<TE>   All of us laughed. Definitely the wrong island.</TE>
<TE>   Like Catalina, Santa Rosa is part of the Channel Islands group, a
string of eight islands off the coast of Southern California. But
that is where the comparison ends.</TE>
<TE>   Catalina has 10,000 visitors on a good weekend. Santa Rosa may
have a dozen. Then again, it may have none.</TE>
<TE>   On a Saturday in June, fewer than a dozen of us--my group and a
few fishermen--were visiting.</TE>
<TE>   My friends and I had decided to embark on an all-islands weekend
in the Santa Barbara Channel. We had planned to stay in Ventura and
take day trips to Santa Rosa and Anacapa, two of the five islands
that make up Channel Islands National Park.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Rosa, 44 miles from the mainland, is occasionally visited by
charter boats: Truth Aquatics in Santa Barbara and Island Packers in
Ventura. But it's a long trip and may be canceled if enough people
haven't booked the voyage. The most dependable way to traverse the
channel is as we did, on a 10-seat twin-engine plane flown by Channel
Islands Aviation out of Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   If you can piece together a group of at least six friends or
family members for the plane ride, you may have the 15-mile-long
island mostly to yourself. The round-trip cost is $106 for adults,
$84 for children. Stay for a day--or longer if you like to camp. But
don't expect amenities. Visitors must bring their own food, water and
shelter.</TE>
<TE>   As we left the plane, pilot Eric Burg recommended a beach walk and
pointed out a trail. Then he said he would return to pick us up in
six hours. He started the engines of the noisy Britten Norman
Islander and lifted off, bound for the mainland.</TE>
<TE>   We strolled off the runway, bound for a beach.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't take long. Within 10 minutes we emerged on a thin strip
of sand that seemed to stretch as far as we could see. There were no
footprints, no litter, no people--just driftwood and shells and
rocks. A strong scent of kelp filled our nostrils, and we could hear
the lazy crash of the surf.</TE>
<TE>   Behind us, 20-foot sand dunes were stacked up against the
sandstone cliffs that line the beach. The only marks on them were
soft ridges and swirls carved by the wind.</TE>
<TE>   The sea was azure in the shallows, gradually deepening to dark
blue on the horizon. About 50 sea gulls stood their ground at the
tide line, undisturbed by our invasion.</TE>
<TE>   We marveled at the scene and congratulated ourselves on finding
such tranquillity so close to home. Then we ambled up the beach,
heading for a tumble of volcanic rocks and tide pools.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Rosa ranges from steep canyons and grass-covered rolling
hills to the beach we were exploring. Once the home of Chumash
Indians, the island is considered a treasure of archeological sites,
some dating back 12,000 years.</TE>
<TE>   There are Torrey pines, a coastal lagoon and plants and animals
found nowhere else on Earth. At one time, flightless geese and pygmy
mammoths strolled here.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, our six hours of island isolation vanished long
before we were ready to leave. Before we knew it, we heard--then
saw--Burg's plane approaching. Tired and sunburned but grateful for
the experience, we reluctantly boarded and returned to the mainland.</TE>
<TE>   The Four Points by Sheraton hotel sits near the Channel Islands
National Park Visitor Center at sleepy Ventura Harbor. Friday night I
had been checked into a room that wasn't made up. I was moved twice
and finally ended up in a clean and comfortable room ($99 plus tax
per night). Unfortunately, it was over the bar. The desk clerk
assured me, however, that the loud music would end at midnight. And
it did. The same desk clerk assured us we could eat in the hotel
restaurant, Alexander's. But it closed early that night.</TE>
<TE>   So we scouted the harbor and happened upon the Scotch and Sirloin,
a clubby-looking restaurant with lots of plants, burnished mahogany
and burgundy overstuffed booths overlooking the marina.</TE>
<TE>   It was a pleasant surprise. Despite the late hour, the sourdough
bread was warm, the prime rib was rare and the sirloin soup was
steaming and hearty. True to its name, the restaurant offered 31
single-malt scotches.</TE>
<TE>   After our return from Santa Rosa on Saturday, we followed a
friend's recommendation and ate at Tipps Thai Cuisine in Old Town
Ventura. Again we were pleased. Tipps, a small storefront restaurant,
had a line outside. But the time went quickly, and soon we were
enjoying excellent curries, pan-fried Thai noodles and tom kha gai, a
chicken coconut soup served in a flaming dish. The family-owned
restaurant has been a stalwart on Main Street since 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Day Two of our island-hopping adventure dawned clear and bright.
Our destination was Anacapa, a rugged mass of steep volcanic cliffs,
lava tubes and sea caves. Only 14 miles from the Ventura County
coast, it offers the easiest access to the national park. Nearly
100,000 people explored it last year.</TE>
<TE>   Like most visitors, we arrived via an Island Packers charter boat,
which sails to Anacapa almost daily during the summer from Oxnard
Harbor ($37 for adults, $20 for children). We boarded the Vanguard, a
65-foot converted fishing boat, at 9:30 a.m., and by 11 we were
nearing the island. It was a perfect day on the water: small seas, an
absence of whitecaps and lots of marine life--sea lions, cormorants
and, best of all, several small pods of dolphins.</TE>
<TE>   Anacapa has only about a square mile of land, but it is spread
over about a five-mile span. From a distance, it appears to be a
dramatic spine of rock protruding from the sea, but as we drew closer
we could see it has eroded into three small islands, East, Middle and
West Anacapa.</TE>
<TE>   In 1932 the Coast Guard erected a lighthouse on East Anacapa. It
was on this island that the Vanguard landed. The next part of the
journey may have been the hardest: We climbed 154 steps to reach the
crown of the island.</TE>
<TE>   But the view from the top was stunning. And the wildlife made
people giggle. We had arrived on Anacapa during the height of the
breeding season for the Western gull. Thousands of them were sitting
on eggs or watching their fuzzy, brown- and tan-speckled babies
toddle around. They were everywhere, and if you got too close, the
birds scolded you. We learned from park ranger Dave Begun that the
baby gulls remain on Anacapa, learning to fly, through mid-August.
Then they will move on, many of them to the mainland.</TE>
<TE>   Because of its lack of water, Anacapa presents a desolate
landscape. But conditions that make the island seem stark to humans
make it particularly attractive to seabirds and marine life. Anacapa
has the largest brown pelican rookery on the Pacific Coast.</TE>
<TE>   As we stood on the edge of the cliffs overlooking the sea, we
could see leopard sharks patrolling the clear, shallow waters far
below. Long arms of giant kelp swayed in the current. Above us, the
sky was clear, blue and smog-free.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, we congratulated ourselves.</TE>

<HD>Phone? Web? Agent? For Best Hotel Rates, Try All</HD>
<DH>As major chains adopt a fluctuating price structure to
respond to demand, no one source can be counted on to supply lowest
prices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once upon a time, hotels had so-called "rack rates," the "official"
room prices published in brochures. These were mostly inflated, but
at least they gave guests a benchmark when bargaining for a room.</LD>
<LD>   Forget that.</LD>
<LD>   Rack rates have largely lost their meaning in the last few years
as major chains switch to the computerized yield management system
that airlines have long used to determine fares. When demand is
projected to be high, prices automatically increase; when it's low,
they drop. Fewer and fewer directories of chain hotels even bother to
list rack rates, says Robert Mandelbaum, director of research for PKF
Consulting, a hotel industry research firm.</LD>
<TE>   On the ground as in the air, prices can be as ephemeral as jet
exhaust.</TE>
<TE>   A colleague slipped into the pricing quicksand earlier this month
while trying to get a room for one night at the Hilton La Jolla
Torrey Pines. The reservations agent quoted her $234 for a view room,
recorded her credit card number--then said with what seemed like
genuine surprise that the rate was changing as she was booking it.
Now the price was more than $300. But--good news--it could be brought
down to $255 by using an American Express card. When my colleague
checked the hotel's Web site, it showed about $240.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the day, I checked the Hilton Web site again, and it
showed no rooms available. Five minutes later, I called the hotel and
was quoted $225 for the view room--the last one in that category, I
was told.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Strebel, senior vice president of sales and marketing for
the hotels division of the conglomerate Cendant Corp., thinks yield
management helps consumers get better rates in low-demand periods,
but he acknowledges some frustration with it. "Rooms were
disappearing while I was on the phone" in April booking a family trip
to Orlando, Fla., he says.</TE>
<TE>   Two other techniques borrowed from the airlines are also appearing
in the hotel industry: Internet-only prices and nonrefundable
bookings. "Hotels are just grasping now to do anything to get more
business," PKF's Mandelbaum says. His company's research shows the
average U.S. hotel suffered a 19.4% drop in profits in 2001--the
largest in more than 60 years--and it projects an 11% decline this
year.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to control price chaos and build brand loyalty, some
hotel chains are offering "guaranteed rates" on their Web sites. If
you can find a lower rate on another Web site, they'll match or
undercut it.</TE>
<TE>   But you may be able to get a better deal by calling the hotel
yourself, as I recently discovered.</TE>
<TE>   Cendant's "Guaranteed Best Available Rate" program made its debut
June 17. It promises that Web sites of its brands--AmeriHost Inn,
Days Inn, Howard Johnson, Knights Inn, Ramada, Super 8, Travelodge,
Villager and Wingate Inn--"will have the lowest rate publicly
available to consumers on the Internet." If you find a lower rate,
Cendant will beat it by 10% if you can document it. (Forms are on the
chains' Web sites.)</TE>
<TE>   Cendant does not, however, promise that its Web sites will beat
members-only deals such as those offered by AAA and AARP; rates
offered to those who call for reservations; or rates booked on such
sites as www.priceline.com or www.hotwire.com, which don't disclose
details until after the booking is made.</TE>
<TE>   I spot-checked three Cendant hotels against the promise earlier
this month, comparing the lowest rates for the same weekend in July.
Besides the hotels' Web sites, I used Internet hotel discounters
www.hotels.com and www.quikbook.com, and I also called the hotels.
Results were mixed.</TE>
<TE>   For the Days Inn-Seattle Downtown, all sources offered the same
rate: $109.85. (So far, so good.) For the Wingate
Inn-Portland-Hillsboro in Oregon, the Cendant Web site offered $79,
Hotels.com $69.95, and the hotel $89.10. (You lose, Cendant.) For the
Ramada Inn &amp; Suites-Gaslamp/Convention Center in San Diego, the hotel
Web site offered $118.99, Hotels.com $129.95 and the hotel $89.99.
(Cendant wins the Web site race, but I would have lost $29 for
relying solely on the Web.)</TE>
<TE>   Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts began a similar guarantee June 1. In
spot checks, its Web site matched or beat the lowest rates I found
elsewhere on the Internet for two of three hotels, the St. Regis in
Washington, D.C., and the Sheraton Boston Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   But I got better deals for those two hotels by phone. At the
Sheraton Boston I was quoted $159 on the phone versus $189 on
Quikbook.com and what appeared to be $179 on the Starwood site (where
the $199 rate included a $20 food credit). At the St. Regis I was
quoted $215 versus $218 on the Starwood site and $239 on
Quikbook.com. In fact, I could have had the St. Regis room for just
$155 under a 21-day AAA "advance purchase rate" that was
nonrefundable, the reservations agent said.</TE>
<TE>   One lesson I draw from these spot checks: No source has the corner
on low hotel rates. The phone may trump the computer or vice versa.
You need to check all sources or get a travel agent to check them for
you. (Travel agents may have better prices, based on special deals
with suppliers.)</TE>
<TE>   But cheap rates can come with potentially costly conditions.</TE>
<TE>   In checking out the "lowest Internet rate guarantee" of another
corporation, Six Continents Hotels, I found a $148.85 price on its
Web site for a room at the Holiday Inn San Francisco-Fisherman's
Wharf in July. That nosed out the $149.95 rate on Hotels.com and the
$153.43 rate the hotel offered by phone.</TE>
<TE>   But when I clicked to the hotel Web page to book the $148.85 rate,
I saw this note: "Advance purchase reservations cannot be canceled,
changed or refunded." By contrast, I could cancel the $153.43 room up
to 6 p.m. the day before arrival without penalty, the hotel's
reservations clerk said. Hotels.com would charge me a $10 penalty for
changes up until 24 hours before arrival.</TE>
<TE>   I would be willing to pay $4.58 more per night to avoid losing
$148.85 in case I had to cancel.</TE>
<TE>   Not all Internet hotel rates have such restrictions. Cendant's
Strebel says his company doesn't offer any Internet-only or
nonrefundable rates, but it is studying the issue. Some of the "Hot
Deals" I checked on Starwood's Web site (www.starwood.com) allow
cancellations without penalty up to 6 p.m. the day before arrival,
some only until 72 hours before. You need to click on "Rate Details"
on each Starwood rate listing to find the cancellation policy.</TE>
<TE>   One rule of thumb: The less research you do, the more you're
likely to pay. It's enough to make anyone lose sleep.</TE>

<HD>Eire Unfolds Astride a Spirited Steed</HD>
<DH>Over hill, through dale and into the heart of a beautiful
land and its people on horseback</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNE DOWIE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SLIGO, Ireland</DL>
<LD>It's hard to imagine that there remains in this world a man who will
greet you as a friend even though you are a stranger, house and feed
you, and let you choose from among his hundred sleek, spirited horses
to ride off on your own across a gorgeous landscape for a week or
two.</LD>
<LD>   To Tilman Anhold, this is simply perpetuating the generosity
extended to him three decades ago. At 29, he came on holiday to
County Sligo from Celle near Hanover in his German homeland, looked
around at this wind-torn outreach of northwestern Ireland and, being
an experienced rider, decided he could best see this land by horse.</LD>
<LD>   The Irish tourist board put Anhold in touch with Don Wall, who
operated a horse-drawn caravan business in County Leitrim. Wall
agreed to let Anhold have a horse for the trip and called ahead to a
friend in Dromahaire to ask whether horse and man could be
accommodated for the night. His host in Dromahaire gave Anhold
directions to the farm of Agnes McDonagh in Ballintogher, where the
German visitor could depend on lodging the next night.</LD>
<TE>   Anhold spoke fairly good English; Agnes' daughter, Colette, knew a
few words of German. Together, Colette and Tilman hatched the notion
of turning Tilman's adventure into a joint venture.</TE>
<TE>   The two were married a year later. By then they had acquired 35
horses and a house on 50 acres, and started Horse Holiday Farm.</TE>
<TE>   Thirsting for adventure and longing to ride on our own without
guides across the open Irish countryside, my husband, Pat, and I
traveled to County Sligo in May two years ago. Although we had been
keen equestrians in our youth, the opportunities to ride had
dwindled. But we were confident our skills would prevail.</TE>
<TE>   After a four-hour trip from Dublin by train and car, we turned in
at the gate and drove past fields and paddocks of lustrous horses,
grazing and lazing in the afternoon sun, their long manes and tails
flicking in the breeze. At the edge of a cliff high above Donegal
Bay, we stepped out at the main house and were greeted by Colette,
whose warm manner melted away the miles.</TE>
<TE>   The beauty of the scene--a panorama of the Slieve League
peninsula, with four strands of beach and as many separate weather
systems--left us in awe. Colette pointed out the solitary and eerie
Classiebawn Castle at Mullaghmore, on a promontory to the distant far
right. Then, with a sweeping gesture to the left, she identified each
strand of beach: Mullaghmore, then Cliffony, Streedagh and Lissadel,
and told us that at low tide we could ride on all four, from one to
the other.</TE>
<TE>   To the left was Sligo Bay, shimmering in the late-day sun, and
directly behind us a few miles away was the smooth, hulking form of
Benbulbin, below whose bare, sloping head, in Drumcliffe churchyard,
lies the grave of William Butler Yeats, marked by a stone etched with
his words: "Cast a cold eye / On life, on death / Horseman, pass by!"</TE>
<TE>   We turned toward the house, whose gray stucco walls and heavy
doors gave it the look of something meant to withstand the elements.
By contrast, the interior, with its polished hardwood floors and
contemporary furnishings, is warm and inviting. In the dining room,
which has a picture window overlooking the bay, a long wooden table
was set for tea.</TE>
<TE>   Upstairs, our spacious room had a simple Bavarian motif, with big
puffed comforters on the beds and a view toward Mullaghmore.</TE>
<TE>   Colette suggested we have some tea and cake before heading for the
stables to meet Tilman and be matched up with our mounts.</TE>
<TE>   Tilman Anhold is a fair-haired, burly man, now 60, brimming with
energy and mirth. An Irish lilt is woven into his German-accented
English, and judging from his banter with the youthful staff, he runs
the farm with firm but friendly Teutonic efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   To determine which horse to offer, he asked only two questions:
How long have you been riding? What manner of horse do you want? Then
he consulted his list of 120 and made a match: for me, a sweet-faced
dark bay named Lomond, and for Pat, a heftier, lighter bay named
Guinness.</TE>
<TE>   All of Anhold's horses are Irish hunters--a cross between a
thoroughbred stallion and a warmblood Irish draught mare--or the
bigger, heftier Irish draught horses with huge plumed lower legs and
feet. They are beautiful, powerful and willing, as well as gentle and
sure-footed. Most of Anhold's horses are bred and raised right there
on the farm.</TE>
<TE>   That first evening, during a sumptuous dinner of shellfish and
chateaubriand with the six other guests, most of whom had also just
arrived, the mood of excitement and conviviality gave way to gallows
humor as a rainstorm began.</TE>
<TE>   Back in our room, we stayed up half the night distilling the
contents of our suitcases into two small sets of saddlebags (one sack
to be left empty for halter and grooming gear) and reading a 15-page
booklet of farm rules and cautionary tales as huge gusts of wind and
rain pounded against the walls.</TE>
<TE>   I thought of naturalist John Muir, who once tied himself to a tree
during a fierce storm to experience what the tree was going through,
and I was having some serious second thoughts about riding off into
what might be six straight days of something similar.</TE>
<TE>   By morning the rain had diminished to a drizzle. After breakfast
of juice, muesli, porridge, eggs, sausage, bacon, grilled tomatoes
and toast, we saddled up for a ride on Cliffony Strand to test
Anhold's matchmaking skills.</TE>
<TE>   Itching to run, the horses began to prance when we reached the
sand. Anhold told us to give them free rein on the beach, so I
gripped Lomond's mane just as he surged into a fast, elongated trot
and then into an undulating gallop. The horses are so big and
powerful that every sensation seemed exaggerated. The sound of hooves
pounding the sand drowned out the crashing of the surf and was in
turn muted by the rush of wind and the throb of blood inside my head.</TE>
<TE>   After half an hour of putting the horses through their paces, we
turned back toward the farm. The sun had broken through the overcast,
and we were relishing the prospect of hitting the Donegal Trail for a
week of unfettered freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Anhold gave us a map of the ride that he had hand-colored with Xs
marking the location of each night's lodging. At each farm there
would be a bed and bath for us, a breakfast so big that we would pack
part of it each day for our lunch, and a field and feed for the
horses. Dinner with our hosts was optional.</TE>
<TE>   Anhold told us we would find yellow arrows at every junction to
indicate the trail. He circled the location of a couple of pubs we
would pass, and then, placing another X on the map just before the
village of Bridgetown, he said, "Don't let the horses drink the water
here." But he didn't explain why, and we assumed--wrongly--that the
ground water was tainted.</TE>
<TE>   Then we were off.</TE>
<TE>   For the next four days we galloped for miles across white sand
beaches and walked and trotted down one-lane country roads, across
fields and through forests, and along narrow footpaths lined with a
riot of rhododendron, Scotch broom and hazel in full bloom. We went
for hours without seeing other people. All along the way were ghostly
relics of the past--crumbling stone fences and long-abandoned stone
cottages. Windows that once glowed with candlelight now stared back
blankly through fluttering shreds of old gray lace. Newborn lambs
bleated and ran to their mothers, startled by the clatter of hooves.</TE>
<TE>   The weather spanned the seasons, sometimes all in one hour. One
moment we were galloping along a beach in bright sunshine as big
clouds billowed on the horizon; the next moment we faced a blackened
sky. Within minutes we might be riding into a hailstorm, stones the
size of ripened peas bouncing off our helmets. We quickly learned to
get in and out of our slickers without dismounting, which was fine
since we could be sun-dried 15 minutes after a drenching rain.</TE>
<TE>   The yellow arrows proved more challenging than the weather. From
the beginning we learned that they were easy to miss or misread. The
second one we saw was bent around a utility pole. We decided it meant
"go straight," but it actually meant we should cut to the right onto
a faint trail through a field. We ended up on a busy road just
outside the fair-sized manufacturing town of Ballyshannon at the 5:30
p.m. rush hour.</TE>
<TE>   Checking the map and realizing our mistake, we turned and rode
several kilometers back to a small quarter-horse ranch, whose owner,
coincidentally, was Colette's first cousin. After offering us tea,
which we reluctantly declined, he directed us back to the trail.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of our second day we were rescued by our intended host,
John Boyle, who was returning from the nearby town of Donegal in time
to greet us at his farm. Hunkered in our hooded slickers, we had
missed the turn and were unknowingly following the next day's arrows.</TE>
<TE>   "Will you be looking for someone?" he asked with a broad grin as
he leaned out the car window. He led us to the farm, where his wife,
Philomena, gave us hot tea and arranged our wet clothes around a big
iron stove, the centerpiece of the living room.</TE>
<TE>   There were many more missed or missing arrows in the days to come.
In the more remote regions, when we ran out of arrows and were just
as confused by the map, we tried to go by our instincts. These times
invariably led to a wonderful encounter with a shepherd, a farmer, a
fisherman or a woman gardening or hanging laundry, who would
sometimes greet us with "Aye, you must be from Tilman's," before
setting us in the right direction.</TE>
<TE>   These misadventures often led to nine-hour days and late-evening
arrivals. On the first day's stopover, Rose McCaffrey, one of the
mistresses of Cavangarden, a beautiful country estate set in 1,000
rolling green acres, returned from her evening walk and found me
lying at a rear gate looking up at my horse. Dismounting to open the
latch, I had caught my foot on a saddlebag, slid to the ground and
was too exhausted to move. Laughing, Rose helped with the gate, and
we rode on in through neatly groomed grounds to a large stone manor
house on a circular driveway.</TE>
<TE>   Each night was a different barn but the same routine: Brush down
the horses, give them grain and water, and turn them out into a field
for the night. In the mornings we often found them lolling in the
tall grass, sometimes allowing us to approach and even put their
halters on before they lurched up onto their feet.</TE>
<TE>   We were too late for the evening meal at Cavangarden, so we washed
up and called a taxi to drive us back into Ballyshannon, the nearest
town. By the time we arrived, it was almost 10 p.m. and the three
main restaurants were closed. We finally coaxed a pizza chef to make
one last pie for us, and we carted it off to a local pub, where we
ate ravenously and drank warm Guinness stout.</TE>
<TE>   As we neared Bridgetown the next day, mindful of Anhold's
admonition not to let the horses drink the water, we kept the animals
from approaching streams along the way. As we neared the town and
were riding along a lane behind some houses, we saw a large barrel
brimming with what must have been rainwater.</TE>
<TE>   The horses headed straight for it, half-submerging their heads.
Just then, an elderly woman rushed around the side of the house with
both arms raised, shouting, "Don't let the horses drink the water!"
and we realized this was her drinking water, the water that Anhold
had warned us about. Apologies would not suffice. We rode on, feeling
stupid and remorseful.</TE>
<TE>   On the third day, we turned east away from the beaches and were
heading through peat bogs and into more mountainous terrain,
alternately walking and trotting for hours through a seedling pine
forest until we suddenly came upon the stunning Lough Derg. Rising
from the water, mirage-like, was the large, mysterious form of the
basilica known as St. Patrick's Purgatory, a destination for
Christian pilgrims since medieval times.</TE>
<TE>   The skies had just cleared, and I would happily have ridden around
and around the shores until nightfall, but we were driven off by
swarms of tiny gnats with big appetites.</TE>
<TE>   It was less than an hour's ride from here to the town of Pettigo,
where we stayed the night at Carne, the farmhouse of Mary Greene, a
reserved and soft-spoken woman who was gracious and attentive to our
needs, including proffering a packet of frozen peas for my slightly
swollen sprained thumb, as we all sat down for tea.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, after riding again for hours and becoming
increasingly anxious that we might have missed a turn, a new feature
of this treasure hunt occurred to us: We could quit. Just that fast,
we turned the horses and headed back to Pettigo. After reserving
another night at Carne, we spent the afternoon and evening riding in
the hills above the town. As the warm sunshine faded softly and a
light breeze quickened, we luxuriated in the knowledge that we
couldn't get lost.</TE>
<TE>   That evening we called Anhold to tell him of our change of plans,
and he arranged to send a truck in the morning to trailer us with the
horses back to Horse Holiday Farm.</TE>
<TE>   There we spent the rest of the week riding by the sea on the
spectacular trails and beaches around Horse Holiday Farm and relaxing
again in the embrace of Colette's hospitality.</TE>
<TE>   It's not unusual for riders to cry when they part with their
horses on the last day at the farm, and I was no exception. Those who
find the pain unbearable can buy their horse from Anhold and take it
home. Bestowing big strokes and hugs and murmured endearments on
Lomond, I instead vowed to return another year to ride the Sligo
Trail.</TE>

<LD>I think you left out one important element in "National Parks May Not
Be as Crowded as Usual" (Travel Insider, June 2). Food facilities are
and have been sadly lacking. Cafeterias do not meet the needs of many
travelers.</LD>
<LD>   The flaw is the National Park Service and its exclusive contracts
with companies, which eliminate competition in the parks. Otherwise
travelers would have higher-quality service and more options for food
service.</LD>

<LD>I can't resist throwing in my two cents about "Getting Lost in the
Web of Internet Fare Searches" (Travel Insider, June 9): After Sept.
11 the airlines were crying the blues, and the federal government
couldn't react fast enough, declaring the air transport system
important to our country. Yet the airlines, with their "black magic"
yield management systems, continue to thumb their noses at the
average traveler. The airline industry says its policies are based on
competition and the marketplace, yet airlines report huge losses and
reduced load factors.</LD>
<LD>   Any airline executive foolish enough to suggest a simplified fare
system is lucky to escape with his or her life. Why haven't any of
the public interest watchdogs raised any red flags?</LD>

<TE>   Please check out www.itasoftware.com. It has everything an air
traveler could possibly want. You can choose a city pair and restrict
your search to specific airports or widen it to include airports
within a certain number of miles. You can specify a particular time
range or leave the times wide open to find the best fare. You can
specify the number of travelers and even their ages to take advantage
of senior fares.</TE>
<TE>   The program finds all the available fares based on your criteria
by searching through all of the airline sites, including upstarts
like JetBlue, ATA and Vanguard. The fares are listed in a logical
manner, and it is easy to sort by airline, by the number of stops or
by both.</TE>
<TE>   I have used this site to buy more than 50 tickets during the last
couple of years, and it has always been accurate. Best of all, it is
free.</TE>

<TE>   Besides air fares, you should look into car rentals on the
Internet and by phone. I recently reserved a car in Cleveland, and
was surprised at the price difference online and on the phone. The
online prices I got were only the weekly rate, not for my entire
12-day rental period. When I telephoned the rental companies, I was
amazed to learn that the five extra days added up to more than the
weekly rate.</TE>

<HD>The Greek Isle That Time Forgot</HD>
<DH>It's no Mykonos, and that's its charm. Introducing Lipsi,
population 650. Not for excitement seekers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LIPSI, Greece</DL>
<LD>I'm sitting on a boat dock looking at Greece, circa 1950. Jackie
Kennedy hasn't started dating any Greek shipping tycoons. Few beyond
the Aegean Sea have ever heard of ouzo. From where I sit, it doesn't
even seem Zeus has been gone that long.</LD>
<LD>   Outside a tiny one-room taverna called an ouzeria, I've joined old
men sipping the potent licorice-flavored drink in the brilliant sun.
We watch a half-dozen fishermen on pastel-painted boats dragging in
lines from an Aegean that's almost as blue as the cloudless sky.</LD>
<LD>   The sun-washed docks are devoid of wall-to-wall restaurants. The
lone souvenir shop is closed for the week. Next door, one of the best
hotels here is charging 18 euros (about $17) a night. I hear birds
chirping, smell the wonderful salty aroma of feta cheese from the
tables around me and listen to the sea lap against the boats. This is
Lipsi, the Greek island mass tourism forgot. So far.</LD>
<TE>   If you're looking for Lipsi on a map, find a good one. It's not on
many. It's a tiny speck of rolling farmland and isolated beaches 40
miles off Turkey. It's part of the Dodecanese island chain, where
overdeveloped Samos to the north and Patmos to the west have started
to resemble Greek theme parks. Lipsi is barely big enough to hold a
park. It's only 12 square miles, with 650 people and twice as many
goats. Besides the one bus and two taxis on the island, a main mode
of transport remains the donkey. The one bank is a cash machine.
There are one doctor and one nurse. There are 45 churches.</TE>
<TE>   Lipsi does, however, have a dozen beaches on seemingly perfect
bays. Its 150 guest rooms are booked up only in July and August. Nine
good restaurants offer inexpensive, traditional Greek cuisine. Don't
bother with dinner reservations. Lipsi gets only about 10,000
tourists a year. Mykonos, Greece's most popular island, gets about
180,000.</TE>
<TE>   And don't come here for history. There are no ruins. The lone
museum, featuring holy water from around the world, is open only two
hours a day.</TE>
<TE>   Really, there is nothing to do here but lie on the beach, eat and
watch the world go by--slowly.</TE>
<TE>   One day, a car ferry the size of New Hampshire pulled in way down
the dock, the only place in the harbor deep enough to hold anything
more than a fishing boat. The ferry comes in twice weekly from
Piraeus, the port of Athens, and disgorges tourists all over the
outer islands.</TE>
<TE>   "How many tourists did you see get off?" asked Lipsi resident
Sarah Vavoulas. The giant door opened, and not even a lime rolled
out.</TE>
<TE>   Vavoulas, a native of Brighton, England, came to Lipsi 14 years
ago, met future husband Haralabos Vavoulas and never left. Today they
own the Rock, a beautiful, popular late-night ouzeria overlooking the
harbor. During the day it's a great perch for watching an island in
no hurry to go anywhere fast. "I lived in London before I came here,"
she said. "People live for tomorrow in big cities. They never live
for the moment. Here no one plans ahead."</TE>
<TE>   I had visited Greece three times and never heard of Lipsi. I
discovered it on an Internet travelers' message board and became
intrigued after research revealed little but a few key repetitive
words: "traditional," "isolated beaches," "quiet." On the Greek
island circuit, Lipsi is way out in right field.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Santorini, Mykonos and other islands smothered by tourism,
there are no straight shots to Lipsi. There isn't anything close to
an airport. To reach it, I flew to Athens and caught an Olympic
Airlines shuttle to Samos. A $5 taxi took me to the harbor, where 90
minutes later a Flying Dolphin, one of the sleek hydrofoils that
started darting around the Greek islands 10 years ago, took me to
Patmos in an hour. Without changing boats, I was on Lipsi in 20 more
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   A bevy of locals greeted me at the dock, all holding signs with
pictures of available rooms. I quickly agreed to a price of $17 with
bath, and a 30-ish, curly-haired man named Stephanos took me in his
pickup down the harbor and up through the tiny village. We drove past
burros and donkeys on a path just wide enough for his truck. Two
women carrying baskets of bread chatted outside a bakery. Greek folk
music emanated from an open window where a woman in traditional black
sat in the shade. This place is an outtake from "Zorba the Greek."</TE>
<TE>   "This is Lipsi town," Stephanos said. "Exciting, isn't it?"</TE>
<TE>   It was perfect.</TE>
<TE>   My spacious double room at Studios Anna was spotless and furnished
with a refrigerator, hot plate, writing table and big closet. A
balcony overlooked farmlands scattered with the snow-white buildings
and turquoise roofs of Greek Orthodox churches. Stray kittens played
in the garden below. I stood on the balcony, lined with pink
bougainvilleas, and took in the fresh salt air and enchanting sounds
of rural Greece. "That's a dove cooing in your ear," said an American
two balconies down.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Buzzoni, a retired federal air-traffic controller from
Bluemont, Va., and his wife, Diana, have visited Greece regularly for
20 years. They're one of a handful of "Lipsites," Western travelers
who use this little rock as their secret getaway. As a potential new
member of the club, I was told I'd be hooked in a hurry.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been all over Greece, and Lipsi and Patmos are our two
favorites," he said. "It is so quiet here."</TE>
<TE>   Walking through every street of the charming village took all of
10 minutes. A walk to the farthest beach took half an hour. The
village is up a cobblestone path above the central church that is
Lipsi's lone landmark. The path leads to quaint outdoor restaurants
encircling a tiny town square. There's a tourist information office
that isn't open much.</TE>
<TE>   Narrow paths snake out from the square past small, dark bakeries,
fresh vegetable stands and cozy tavernas where a fresh Greek salad,
souvlaki, fries and an after-dinner Metaxa brandy may cost 10 euros
(about $9.40). Another path leads under a huge tree that provides
shade for a guest house overlooking the harbor. In a restaurant
called the Vault, the menu shows a picture of Lipsi from 1912, during
Italian occupation. It doesn't look much different now.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of Greek people don't know about it," said Michael
Krabousanos, a Lipsi native who lived in Cincinnati for 35 years.
"When I'm in Athens and I tell them where I'm from, they go, 'Where's
that?' "</TE>
<TE>   It's true. Greece has a TV show similar to "Jeopardy" in which
learned guests answer questions from all fields. One recent question:
To what island chain does Lipsi belong? It stumped the panel.</TE>
<TE>   They obviously didn't know about Lipsi's quiet traditions either:
the two-day-long weddings where locals break plates (well, actually
they're plastic) at dancers' feet in the town square, the three-day
wine festival in August, the neighborhood dinner parties nearly every
night.</TE>
<TE>   On Lipsi, people regularly stopped me to provide rides to the
beach. The owner of one village square restaurant let me help myself
to drinks in the cooler while watching the World Cup with his family
and friends. Just leave the euro on the table, he said. My local
bakery added freebie sesame bread sticks with my daily breakfast
order of tiropita, Greece's delicious cheese pie.</TE>
<TE>   "I find it just cozy," said Evert Kerkerk, a Dutch yacht builder
who has sailed the Greek islands for 10 years and returns to Lipsi
for seven months every year. "You become part of the island. You meet
each other sometimes three or four times a day. Hello, here. Hello,
there. If you are a tourist here, you are not alone."</TE>
<TE>   There's one place on Lipsi where you can feel very alone: the
beach. Beaches here, like ouzo, are an acquired taste. The downside
of undeveloped beaches is that they are, well, undeveloped. Don't
expect lounge chairs. There isn't the sugary white sand with the
consistency you'd find off the 18th green at Riviera Country Club.</TE>
<TE>   A 20-minute walk from the village and a five-minute trot down a
goat path brought me to Hohlakoura, one of Lipsi's best-known
beaches. On an early June day, the scenery was breathtaking: a
perfect half-moon bay formed by long rock jetties. The royal blue
water was as clear as glass and almost as smooth. It was 80 degrees,
under a cloudless sky, and a nice, cool breeze came off the Aegean.
Not a soul was on the beach. I tried to find a plot of sand on which
to lay my straw mat and found none. The beach was rocks. Big rocks.
Small rocks. I put down my mat and carefully lay down. When the rocks
are even, they form a surprisingly comfortable surface. Then again,
an Indian fakir feels the same sensation on a bed of nails.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad they don't have sandy beaches," Buzzoni said. "This
place would be just like Mykonos or Santorini. It'd be a madhouse."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, Lipsi does have sandy beaches. You just have to know
where.</TE>
<TE>   The most comfortable beach on the island may be the town beach.
Liendou, just around the jetty from the harbor, features hard-packed
sand on its own tree-lined bay. Hotel Aphrodite, one of the two
nicest hotels on Lipsi, overlooks it from across the narrow road.
Elsewhere, a half-hour walk along spectacular coastline leads to
Platis Yialos, which has a shallow, sandy bay. A 10-minute walk north
of Hohlakoura is another picturesque sandy beach called Tourkomnima.</TE>
<TE>   Lipsi is lucky it has those. Because it has no islands directly
north of it, except Samos 50 miles away, Lipsi is susceptible to the
Aegean winds that wash rocks from the sea onto the beach. The plus
side: The wind ensures the island is never uncomfortably hot. The
other plus is that the beaches are just rough enough to keep away the
cruise ships that invade Patmos twice a week. The island is changing
nonetheless. Forty tourist bungalows are to be completed in 2004.
It's not exactly urban sprawl. Then again, this is an island that
didn't have a paved road until 1995. Ten years ago, agriculture,
fishing and farming were more dominant. Now locals are slowly turning
toward tourism.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're united, this could be another Bahamas," said Nico
Christodoulou, a Lipsi native who owns the guest house Studios
Kalymnos. "There are so many little islands. But there are conflicts.
People might just sell the land. They think it's better with money in
hand."</TE>

<TE>   Guidebook: Slowing Down to Island Time on Lipsi</TE>
<TE>   Getting there: Connecting service is available from Los Angeles to
Athens on Delta, British Airways, Air France, Lufthansa, KLM and
Swiss. Restricted round-trip fares begin at $1,268.</TE>
<TE>   From Athens, Olympic Airways flies to Samos round trip for $98.
Hydrofoils leave the Samos port at Pythagorio for Lipsi daily through
Sept. 24; they are on an irregular schedule during the rest of the
year. Check ferry schedules at www.gtp.gr. Hydrofoil reservations are
recommended during July and August.</TE>
<TE>   Telephones: To call the numbers below from the U.S., dial 011 (the
international dialing code), 30 (country code for Greece) and the
local number.</TE>
<TE>   Where to stay: Hotel Calypso, 2470-41-420, one of the
highest-rated hotels on the island, is opposite the ferry dock.
Doubles are $34 in July and August, otherwise $24.</TE>
<TE>   Another nice hotel, the Aphrodite, 2470-41-000, has doubles from
$28 to $44 depending on the month. It is open May through October.</TE>
<TE>   Studios Anna, 2470-41-126, www.greeklodgings.gr, is on a hill
above the village. Open May through October, it has kitchens. Doubles
are $26 in July, $36 in August and $22 during the remainder of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   Almost next door, Studios Kalymnos, 2470-41-102,
www.lipsi-island.gr, has a terraced garden and kitchen facilities.
Doubles are $14 in April, May, October and November, $21 in June and
September and $32 in July and August.</TE>
<TE>   Studios Barbarosa, 2470-41-202, in the village, has doubles for
$24 in May and June. They go up to $43 in July and August and back to
$24 in late September.</TE>
<TE>   Panorama, 2470-41-235, has doubles for $24 in May, June and
September, $34 in July and $37 in August. Reservations are
recommended in July and August.</TE>
<TE>   Where to eat: Yiannis Restaurant, 2470-41-395, is probably the
island's most elegant. It has a romantic atmosphere with soft music
and good, inexpensive food. Overlooks the ferry terminal. Entrees
start at about $4.50.</TE>
<TE>   The Plaka, 2470-41-065, off the village square and featuring a
spiral staircase, has excellent local cuisine starting at about $4.</TE>
<TE>   For cocktails, go to the Rock, 2470-41-180, the island's most
popular hangout, where hors d'oeuvres, called mezedes, are less than
$2. Try the grilled octopus.</TE>
<TE>   Getting around: One bus leaves from the harbor every hour on the
hour and traverses the few roads on the island. You can find the two
taxis parked near the harbor, with the drivers not far away.</TE>
<TE>   When to go: May, June and September are ideal. Avoid July and
August. These are the Europeans' vacation months, and they swarm all
over Greece, with many spilling onto Lipsi. The Italians have
discovered the island, and locals say they hear more Italian than
Greek in late summer.</TE>

<HD>Bye-Bye, Love Boat</HD>
<DH>The iconic ship that lured millions to the seas and boosted
the industry will set sail this autumn on its final voyage</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARL ZIMMERMANN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Striding up the gangway, I knew I was boarding the original Love Boat
of television fame--the Pacific Princess, that gently aging,
exceedingly diminutive (at least by today's standards) ship that had
been instrumental in popularizing cruising a quarter-century ago.</LD>
<LD>   On the other hand, I knew I wasn't doing any such thing. I knew
Capt. Merrill Stubing (played by Gavin MacLeod, who remains a
Princess Cruises spokesman) wouldn't be at the gangway to greet me as
I boarded. Like much else on "The Love Boat," the weekly TV series
that for a decade brought the romance of cruising into the living
rooms of millions of American landlubbers, this ritual bore little
relation to real life. I also knew that my fellow passengers wouldn't
all be beautiful people questing for romance.</LD>
<TE>   But I knew this too: The Pacific Princess was a woman with a past
and an intriguing one at that. She has a shippy profile that you
would never mistake for an apartment building, and--at a passenger
capacity of 640 (638 on our cruise)--an intimacy and coziness that is
all but lost in contemporary cruising. And even before I pulled on
the midnight blue T-shirt I would purchase in the ship's boutique,
the one that read "Pacific Princess, 1972-2002, the Farewell Season,"
I knew it was this summer or never to sail aboard the Love Boat. On
Oct. 27, when the Pacific Princess' lines are slipped at New York
City's Passenger Ship Terminal one last time and the ship sails for
Civitavecchia, Italy, an important early chapter in the annals of
cruising will close.</TE>
<TE>   Even as my wife, Laurel, and I boarded on a Sunday last month in
New York for a seven-day cruise to Bermuda, this ship had been
promised elsewhere--sold to an Italian company for charter. Under
terms of the purchase, the ship must sail under another name, with no
references to her past. We wondered what we would find aboard the
stalwart vessel whose longtime owner now found it obsolete. Its twin,
Island Princess, which had shared the distinction of being "the
original Love Boat," was sold in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   When I called to book our Bermuda cruise, the reservation agent
had been upbeat but full of caveats--scripted, no doubt--to prevent
complaints after the fact. "You do know that this ship has no balcony
cabins?" she asked, an apology lurking in her voice. "And that the
'Anytime Dining' option is not available--just the traditional two
seatings with assigned tables in the dining room?" I assured her that
those weren't concerns, and we settled on booking a "guarantee" at a
rate of a little more than $1,000 apiece, one level above the minimum
for an outside cabin. This left us eligible for an upgrade.</TE>
<TE>   On board, our first impressions were favorable. Our mini-suite aft
on the Promenade Deck was spacious, bright and airy, with twin beds,
sofa, round coffee table with three easy chairs, credenza, vanity and
a bathroom with tub. The layout and built-in furniture appeared to be
original, but the curtains, upholstery and carpets seemed recently
renewed. The public rooms were well appointed if decidedly
modest--some might even say dowdy--by present-day cruise-ship
standards (though, we were told, carpeting throughout the public
areas was new). The two-deck central lobby, for instance, with the
winding "Love Boat stairs," a favorite spot for photos, is a nice
design but looks dated compared with the soaring atriums in newer
ships. We found ample open deck space--surfaced in teak, as decks are
meant to be--with chairs oriented for leisurely contemplation of the
sea.</TE>
<TE>   When we gathered at our muster station, the Pacific Lounge, for
our pre-sailing boat drill, Vicki Smith, one of the cruise staff and
a dancer in the engaging production shows, was killing time waiting
for the recorded safety announcement from the bridge. She asked who
had cruised with Princess before, and about a third of us raised
hands. Then another question:</TE>
<TE>   "How many of you expected that this ship would be bigger?" she
asked--there was that note of apology again--and a smattering of
hands went up, though not ours. Its size was a major reason we were
there, that and curiosity about an icon of popular culture.</TE>
<TE>   Sailing is always great theater, and New York Harbor remains one
of its preeminent stages. We were squeezed in at Berth 5 behind
Norwegian Cruise Line's Norwegian Sea. With a capacity of 1,518
passengers, the Sea is a midsize player in today's cruise game--as is
Royal Caribbean International's Nordic Empress, at 2,020 passengers,
which was berthed opposite us. By comparison, RCI's Voyager of the
Seas, one of the world's largest cruise ships, can carry 3,114.
Still, these ships towered over the Pacific Princess.</TE>
<TE>   We were last to sail that day. The tug Catherine Turecamo nuzzled
up against the ship in late afternoon. Four spine-tingling blasts on
the whistle announced our departure, and no doubt set off some car
alarms on 11th Avenue; then we began to ease out into the Hudson, or
North River, as it is is known by mariners. We joined the parade
downriver, past Navy ships and the Intrepid, the city's resident
aircraft carrier, now a museum.</TE>
<TE>   From the Sun Deck we watched as a misty skyline unfolded: the
Empire State Building, Chrysler's inimitable spire, the golden cupola
of the MetLife tower. Farther downtown came the still shocking,
heart-sinking vacancy where the World Trade Center's twin towers once
stood. When sailing or arriving, we had always watched for the moment
when the Woolworth Building's fine Gothic tower was framed between
the Trade Center's two. Not anymore.</TE>
<TE>   But it was reassuring to pass one of the Staten Island Ferry's
orange Kennedy-class boats, 1960s vessels, which I had grown up
riding. Finally came Ellis Island, the Statue of Liberty, the
Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and Lower New York Bay, in pea-soup fog.</TE>
<TE>   We had cocktails that night in the Starlight Lounge, perched
forward atop the bridge and swathed in white. The windows that should
have overlooked the sea were drenched with condensation. Pianist Mike
Rorah, whose jazzy stylings of show tunes would charm us throughout
the week, had closed up shop in a huff, unwilling to have his riffs
punctuated by the foghorn.</TE>
<TE>   By the next morning, sun was burning through the clouds, and we
staked out deck chairs with 180-degree views of the Atlantic. We read
away that day at sea and most of the next, until our midafternoon
arrival at St. George, the first of three Bermuda port calls.</TE>
<TE>   For me, one of the great joys of cruising is things I don't have
to do. That first day, I felt no need to go to the gym or participate
in either high- or low-impact aerobics. Or learn scarf tying or line
dancing. Or compete in pingpong or a scavenger hunt or a brunch-time
trivia contest. Or find out about the rare and beautiful gemstone
tanzanite or learn why my hair always lets me down. And that was only
in the morning; ahead of me was an entire afternoon of activities I
could forgo.</TE>
<TE>   Still, this was the Love Boat, so we felt we should mingle.
Dressed up in tux and gown (there would be two formal evenings and
five "smart casual" ones), we went to the obligatory Captain's
Welcome Party, which turned out to be unusually gracious and
enjoyable. In his brief remarks, Capt. Christopher Rynd, a New
Zealander, struck just the right note.</TE>
<TE>   "This small ship has an ambience of intimacy and warmth not easily
found on the larger ships of today," he said. No apology here, and
that's not surprising, since Rynd has a long history with the Pacific
Princess and the virtually identical Island Princess. The ships were
acquired by Princess in 1974, and Rynd joined the Island Princess as
second officer in 1977, the year "The Love Boat" first aired on
television. In his career with P&amp;O Princess, he estimates he has
spent about seven years altogether on the Pacific Princess.</TE>
<TE>   Though Rynd didn't greet every passenger at the gangway--as Capt.
Stubing did in the TV show--he did shake all our hands at his welcome
party; and when I spoke with him later, he told me how "The Love
Boat" was regarded up in "officer country" in its first year.</TE>
<TE>   "The episodes followed a certain theme, didn't they?" he said
dryly. The theme, of course, was hot romance on the wing, aided at
every turn by the cruise director and others. "But generally they
were pleased that the ship and the company were celebrated in that
way."</TE>
<TE>   Though much footage was shot in the studio, filming was also
common when the ship was in service, and passengers were used as
extras.</TE>
<TE>   "They would post notices," Rynd recalled, "saying 'If you look
good in a bathing suit, contact the producer.' " He never appeared on
the show, though he has Hollywood good looks. So do Chris Nichol, the
cruise director, and Joy Casaru, the social hostess, who did make a
cameo appearance in one episode. Casaru seems to be the vivacious
real-life counterpart of Julie McCoy, the matchmaking cruise director
who was played by Lauren Tewes in the TV show until 1984.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that this little ship made cruising what it is today,"
said Casaru, a native of Yorkshire, England, who not only draws
little faces in her O's but also puts long eyelashes on them. Her
stint on the ships that would become the Love Boat began in 1974,
when she was flown in to join the Island Princess in midcruise.</TE>
<TE>   "They stopped the ship in the middle of the Panama Canal," she
remembers. "I didn't know I'd have to climb a rope ladder, so I was
wearing a dress. I wasn't sure what was more important, my life or my
vanity." Through the years she has worked on many ships in the fleet,
but none more often than the Pacific and Island Princesses, which she
considers second homes.</TE>
<TE>   "I was married and divorced aboard these ships, to the
photographer," she said, suggesting that "The Love Boat" may have
been more realistic than its seemingly farfetched romantic plots led
me to believe.</TE>
<TE>   Casaru remembers fondly the celebrities she met aboard, among them
Sophia Loren, June Allyson, Connie Francis and Vincent Price. Casaru
loved the glamour of it all.</TE>
<TE>   "Some sailings were advertised as 'Love Boat filming cruises,' "
she said. "They would commandeer a lounge, fill it with generators,
spotlights and cameras. The extras would have to be in evening dress
by 9:30 in the morning. They would film all day for a scene that
might run just half a minute. It was an eye-opener for me, being a
country bumpkin. Even on a bright day outside they would use all
these floodlights."</TE>
<TE>   On our days at sea we rarely needed such artificial sun, but we
could have used it in Bermuda, where we were beset by rain. Princess
advertises its itinerary as their "Bermuda Triangle," because it is
the only company to call at all three of the island's ports: St.
George, Hamilton and West End, site of the Royal Naval Dockyards
complex, with a maritime museum and an extensive shopping mall in
beautifully restored stone buildings.</TE>
<TE>   We entered St. George's harbor through Town Cut, a strait so snug
that we could see the whites of the costumed town crier's eyes as he
rang a bell and called out a welcome from Gates Fort, accompanied by
the reports of twin cannons.</TE>
<TE>   An impeccably picturesque town, St. George suffers only from a
sense that it exists primarily to be visited by cruise passengers.
Laurel and I took a strenuous but rewarding walk on the eastern end
of the Railway Trail, a walking and cycling path maintained and well
signed on much of the right-of-way of the star-crossed Bermuda
Railway, which was opened in 1931 and abandoned only 18 years later.</TE>
<TE>   In Hamilton we dodged raindrops to shop on Front Street, where the
Pacific Princess shared berth space with Celebrity Cruises' midsize
Horizon. On Wednesday nights--when the ship overnights in
Hamilton--Front Street is closed to traffic for Harbor Night. There's
usually music, and when we were there it was provided by English and
Scottish regimental marching bands, stirring in sound and sight
against a backdrop of the floodlighted cruise ships.</TE>
<TE>   That night we chose to dine shoreside at Port o' Call, a splendid
restaurant with warm wood paneling, nautical decor and exceptional
food prepared by a chef who had trained at Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill in
New York City. We had a rich corn chowder and rum-laced fish broth;
calamari and shrimp, deep-fried and wonderfully light; and soft-shell
crabs.</TE>
<TE>   We meant no disrespect to the meals aboard the Pacific Princess.
The Coral Dining Room was a cheerful if mundane space, located low
and central in the ship, where dining rooms almost universally were
placed for stability three decades ago. We had assigned tables,
without the option of the open-seating that prevails on the other
Princess ships.</TE>
<TE>   Dinners were consistently good, with my favorite coming on French
night: escargots (snails), onion soup, duckling, hazelnut souffle.</TE>
<TE>   Francesco Malfera, our madcap waiter, was one of a kind. A 20-year
Pacific Princess veteran, he has clear memories of the "Love Boat"
filming. "Excellent choice," he would say, whatever we ordered. He
capered, sang and would turn up sporting a mock Walkman, constructed
of a napkin and a pair of coffee cups. But he was also a terrific
waiter.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you think we get served so promptly just because we're near
the kitchen," asked Lori, a tablemate, "or because of Francesco's
stature there?" I was sure it was the latter.</TE>
<TE>   If Francesco provided the impromptu entertainment, cruise director
Nichol headlined in the three full-scale shows in the Carousel
Lounge, the ship's intimate performance space. After a dozen years as
an on-board entertainer, he was last year appointed cruise
director--a combination unique in the Princess fleet. Because the
ship is so small, all entertainers double as cruise staff.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a big fan of 'The Love Boat' as a kid in Liverpool
[England]," Nichol said. "When I found myself aboard her, my head was
in the clouds." I expressed some skepticism about the TV show, which
in 2002 seems more than a little contrived. But Nichol doesn't see it
that way.</TE>
<TE>   "I know countless people who got married because of being on the
ship," he said. "And the nostalgia of this final season is
incredible, with so many passengers coming back to cruise one more
time on the Love Boat, bringing brochures and other memorabilia."</TE>
<TE>   I ended the voyage awash in melancholy, as I always do when I'm
saying goodbye to a ship. Steaming up North River to disembark, I
wondered how Casaru and Nichol would feel in October, or Capt. Rynd
in July, when he turns over the Pacific Princess to Capt. Nick
Carlton for the last time and heads for Australia and the Pacific
Sky. Like me, I imagined: philosophical yet reverent.</TE>
<TE>   "This ship has been everywhere," Rynd told me, "from the North
Cape of Norway to Cape Horn, from the Black Sea to the China Sea,
from the South Pacific to the Mediterranean, and around Africa. It's
extraordinary what she's seen--and what people have experienced
aboard."</TE>
<TE>   Not a bad legacy--along with jump-starting an industry.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: Charles W. Riendeau of Del Mar trekked to western
Canada's Yukon Territory two years ago hoping to dig up Klondike Gold
Rush lore. He panned for the precious metal at the site of the
original 1896 strike, but the only riches he found were the golden
grasses in the hills of nearby Dawson, 165 miles south of the Arctic
Circle near Canada's border with Alaska. "I was expecting tundra,"
says Riendeau, who hiked up a hill with friend Lesley Fitzpatrick to
photograph the confluence of the Klondike and Yukon rivers, pictured
above. "The view was so spectacular," Riendeau says. "There's a
canyon to the left, out of frame, where the original strike was
made."</CP>

<HD>All Is Not Lost -- Usually -- if You Face a Close Enounter
of the Bear Kind</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>The bear--a large grizzly--was on the other side of a two-lane road
in the Canadian Rockies north of Banff. Stupidly, I had left the
group I was camping with to take an early morning walk. I didn't even
have my bear bells, the jinglers that one attaches to a stick in
hopes the noise will announce one's presence.</LD>
<LD>   The bear and I were headed in the same direction, the animal with
the confidence of a wilderness native, I with an interloper's
temerity that quickly turned to fear. We looked at each other and
kept walking. I wondered when it would cross the road for breakfast.</LD>
<LD>   Just then a minivan pulled up. As it slowed, the door opened and a
friendly hand--one of my group--pulled me in, leaving the grizzly to
eat my dust instead of me.</LD>
<TE>   You would think the experience would have taught me to stay away
from bears. Not quite. Unlike snakes, which also scare me, bears are
creatures I respect and love. Spotting them in the wild is as
stirring to me as seeing Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel.</TE>
<TE>   I've managed to stay safe because I took the time to read the
literature about bears provided at most of the national parks I
visited. I've also read Stephen Herrero's gripping and informative
"Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance" (The Lyons Press, 2002). I
would recommend the same thing for anyone going to bear country,
whether a casual day hiker or a back-country pro.</TE>
<TE>   There were about 58,000 grizzlies in North America in 2001,
according to National Geographic; there are more than 10 times that
many black bears, typically smaller and shyer, roaming from Alaska to
Mexico and from California to Maine, Geographic says.</TE>
<TE>   The national parks where bear encounters are most frequent are
Yellowstone and Montana's Glacier. Five people have died of
bear-inflicted injuries in Yellowstone since it was founded at the
end of the 19th century; in 100-year-old Glacier, 10 people have been
killed by bears.</TE>
<TE>   These incidents make for hair-raising stories, like Jack Olsen's
"Night of the Grizzlies" (Homestead, 1996), about an August night in
1967 when two women were killed by bears in separate incidents in
Glacier National Park.</TE>
<TE>   A bear encounter is frightening to me because experts advise
different responses in different situations. "There's no cookbook
recipe for how to react," says Darren Ireland, a biologist at
Yellowstone.</TE>
<TE>   This spring in the park, Abigail Thomas, a 30-year-old jogger,
managed to discourage a grizzly that had her thigh in its mouth by
squirting it with a water bottle. The bear walked away, and Thomas
escaped with only bruises.</TE>
<TE>   Ireland says experts typically recommend a more aggressive
approach, yelling and waving arms to scare the bear away.</TE>
<TE>   Carrying and using pepper spray, which makes breathing difficult
but doesn't permanently injure a bear, is effective for avoiding
attacks by black and grizzly bears, says Jim Zumbo, hunting editor
for Outdoor Life magazine. Trying to frighten the creature by making
loud noises and throwing things often deters black bears.</TE>
<TE>   But when a grizzly charges and makes contact, experts advise
people to lie down and play dead. The cannonball position used to be
recommended. Now, says David Smith, the author of "Backcountry Bear
Basics" (Mountaineer Books, 1997), it's thought to be better to lie
flat on your stomach with your hands folded at the back of your neck.
In this position, it's harder for a bear to roll you over than when
you're balled up, Smith says.</TE>
<TE>   Besides calling for more presence of mind than most people could
muster, both approaches mean you must distinguish between black and
grizzly bears, which isn't easy. Contrary to their name, black bears
can be brown or blond, the same colors as grizzlies. The best way to
tell the two apart is to look for a hump on the bear's back, which
means it's probably a grizzly.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, there are different kinds of bear encounters, each
calling for assessment and differing responses. If you come upon a
grizzly in close quarters, you may be able to stand tall and back
away slowly. If, however, the animal is a mother with cubs or is
guarding a carcass, grizzlies are seldom as amenable and may charge,
calling for the playing-dead approach. If a bear attacks with no
provocation as if seeking prey, fight for your life, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Those kinds of attacks are little understood by biologists and,
thankfully, are quite rare. But in May 2000, a woman was killed in
the South's Great Smoky Mountains National Park by a 112-pound female
black bear with a 48-pound cub. The animals were blocking the woman's
way on a bridge, so she waded across the stream, but the bears ran
her down and killed her.</TE>
<TE>   Like other parks, the Great Smoky Mountains has become more
proactive in dealing with problem bears in the last few decades,
especially those that get used to eating people's food and garbage.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Gniadek, a wildlife biologist at Glacier National Park, says
the twin killings in 1967, both thought by some experts to have been
the work of grizzlies that had been scavenging for tidbits in
developed areas, immediately changed the way the park manages its
garbage. There and at other parks frequented by bears--Yosemite,
Yellowstone, Alaska's Glacier Bay and Great Smoky
Mountains--bearproof dumpsters and trash cans were installed, and
visitors are bombarded with information about how to avoid trouble
with bears.</TE>
<TE>   In other respects, though, each park takes a slightly different
approach to bear management. Glacier Bay National Park can afford to
close areas where bears have come too close to people, because it's
so large--3.3 million square acres--with a back country frequented
chiefly by a handful of kayak campers.</TE>
<TE>   Yosemite, where the incidence of bears breaking into cars for food
hit a park system high in 1998, has addressed the problem by
requiring visitors to store in locked bins all items that might
attract bears. (Parked cars with food inside can be towed.) In
Yellowstone, bears that frequent developed areas are relocated.</TE>
<TE>   Montana's Glacier has experimented with a new program called
aversive conditioning, which employs specially trained bear dogs and
noninjurious projectiles to teach bears to stay in the back country,
away from people.</TE>
<TE>   Training people about how to get along in bear country is nearly
as challenging. Here's what "Backcountry Bear Basics" author Smith
advises:</TE>
<TE>   * Take pepper spray (and figure out how to use it before going
into the wild).</TE>
<TE>   * Pay attention to what's going on around you.</TE>
<TE>   * Make noise so you don't surprise a bear.</TE>
<TE>   And an additional tip from me: Consider yourself blessed when you
do see a bear--but only at a distance.</TE>

<HD>Forget the Gridiron--City Hall Should Think Soccer</HD>
<DH>The ball is in the NFL's court now.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANK del OLMO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council doesn't get it. Futbol, not football, is
L.A.'s future, so quit worrying about whether this city will ever get
another National Football League franchise.</LD>
<LD>   It shouldn't be necessary to make such an obvious point. But
recently the council quietly approved several measures intended to
help lure an NFL team here. And the timing could not have been worse.</LD>
<LD>   First, the votes came a week after investors who had planned to
build a $450-million NFL stadium downtown supposedly gave up on the
idea because of political roadblocks.</LD>
<TE>   Worse, City Hall acted even as the rest of Los Angeles was
enthralled by sports other than American pro football. That should
have reminded the council just how little the NFL has mattered here
since the Rams and Raiders left town in 1995. I refer not just to the
Lakers' third straight championship or even the fact that the Dodgers
and Angels both recently have been near first place in their
respective divisions.</TE>
<TE>   No, L.A. was in the forefront among major U.S. cities captivated
by the World Cup, the international soccer tournament that every four
years crowns a champion in the popular sport the rest of the world
calls football.</TE>
<TE>   Like other Americans, Angelenos enjoyed the performance of the
surprising U.S. team, which reached the quarterfinals--our best World
Cup showing in 72 years. But in this town we have other "home" teams
to root for too, like Mexico's and a plucky South Korean squad.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who still doubts that soccer is a major sport in L.A.
should check the record TV ratings for the World Cup games played
after midnight local time, including today's championship match
between Brazil and Germany. How many Angelenos would awaken before
dawn to watch an NFL game?</TE>
<TE>   So it's silly for City Hall to try to appease the NFL. Only one of
the proposals the council approved makes any sense from a taxpayer's
point of view: ordering the Community Redevelopment Agency to review
36 blighted areas of the city to determine whether any of them offers
a suitable stadium site.</TE>
<TE>   That resolution was the handiwork of Councilman Mark
Ridley-Thomas, who knows full well that one CRA project area is
Exposition Park, where the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum is located.
He refuses to be cowed by the NFL's insistence that the Coliseum is a
nonstarter and that only a new stadium would get a football
franchise.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley-Thomas was also instrumental in getting the Coliseum
Commission, of which he is a member, to set aside $1 million to
update studies that may help convince the NFL that the Coliseum is
the only venue likely to get any taxpayer support. That Coliseum bid
is what forced the Anschutz Entertainment Group, which owns Staples
Center, to give up its plans to build a stadium downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Some speculate that AEG and its billionaire investors were just
bluffing in threatening to abandon the stadium project to pressure
the city into granting them the public subsidies needed for
construction to begin. If that's the case--and I suspect it is--City
Hall should play it smart and follow Ridley-Thomas' lead. He knows
the NFL needs L.A. more than we need it.</TE>
<TE>   One way to prove that axiom would be to focus more civic resources
on making L.A. the center of pro soccer in this country. The best
idea floated so far to make that happen is Los Angeles County
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavky's idea of putting a Mexican soccer league
team in the historic stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican pro soccer could draw lots of fans here--witness the
crowds that show up whenever popular teams such as Chivas of
Guadalajara are in town. The Coliseum was expecting nearly 20,000
fans on Saturday for a match between Mexico City's Club America and
River Plate of Buenos Aires.</TE>
<TE>   So make the NFL wait. It is facing a demographic reckoning anyway.
Surveys suggest its fan base is rapidly aging, and fewer young people
care about pro football. So the NFL's product may become a niche
sport, like boxing, while soccer continues to grow in popularity.</TE>
<TE>   That's why NFL honchos will eventually come crawling back to L.A.
And they'll be so desperate to be here that, if the Coliseum isn't
good enough for them, they'll pay for their own stadium.</TE>

<HD>Vouchers Answer New Segregation in Our Schools</HD>
<DH>Poor children are being blocked from getting a decent
education.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From busing to vouchers, two U.S. Supreme Courts--one liberal, one
conservative--have now both come to the same conclusion: Our public
schools are unacceptably segregated.</LD>
<LD>   Fifty years after the Brown vs. Board of Education decision, our
poorest kids face a modern educational segregation as debilitating
and socially divisive as the older version. It is a harsh judgment,
bitterly resisted by the education establishment.</LD>
<LD>   In his time, Chief Justice Earl Warren was vilified by the right
for busing. With last week's decision, we can now expect Chief
Justice William Rehnquist to be castigated by the left for suggesting
that vouchers may be a possible new remedy.</LD>
<TE>   Democrats particularly need to heed this message, even if we
object to the messenger, especially after the Gore-versus-Bush
decision of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   We need to be honest and understand the reason five justices felt
it was necessary to give our public education system this jolt of
judicial electricity.</TE>
<TE>   Fifty years ago, the political elite in the U.S. Senate were still
refusing to give black children an equal education. So, led by Chief
Justice Warren, a unanimous court decided to take matters into its
own hands.</TE>
<TE>   The justices ruled that state and local governments must integrate
their public school systems. The doctrine of "separate but equal" was
rejected. Or so we hoped.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, such a sweeping social intervention by an
appointed court met with massive resistance. But over time,
educational systems across the nation began to integrate through
busing.</TE>
<TE>   Given our segregated housing patterns, there was no way to achieve
meaningful public school integration without busing.</TE>
<TE>   Did public school integration work? It did for me and most of the
nation. It changed us, redeeming a country and sending forth a new
burst of freedom.</TE>
<TE>   But last week, the Supreme Court took a look at nearly half a
century of post-Brown social statistics and came to this conclusion:
For too many of the Americans who need it most, the revolution
started by Warren and implemented by busing was a total failure.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, no thoughtful and objective person can disagree with this
conclusion. As Bob Dylan's protest song against segregation asked:
How many times can a man turn his head and pretend that he just
doesn't see?</TE>
<TE>   Our most needy children are far too frequently suffering under the
type of educational disparity that helped lead to the Brown decision.</TE>
<TE>   For purposes of argument, let me accept the proposition that the
current leaders of public education could rectify the situation if
given all the tax money they want. The reality is they are never
going to get that money. They can call it a lack of will on the part
of the elected elite or a lack of compassion on the part of the
people, the overwhelming majority of whom have sufficient educational
choice for their children.</TE>
<TE>   To repeat: Our poorest kids are trapped in their current
educational segregation. Enter, then, a split Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Those opposing the legality of the Ohio voucher plan are good and
honorable men and women. They believe passionately in public
education. But at the same time, they and the political elite have
the luxury of not feeling the pain of their principles.</TE>
<TE>   At this juncture in our history, this is not a situation we can
continue to tolerate. In so many walks of life the elite live under
one standard, while the poorest Americans are forced to live under a
harsher standard of morality and social conduct.</TE>
<TE>   To me, the voucher decision must be seen as a wake-up call, drawn
from the great observation of Oliver Wendell Holmes: The law
ultimately must reflect the common sense of the human condition.</TE>
<TE>   Our educational system has again forced our poorest children to
endure an unacceptable modern segregation, something that should have
been as repugnant to us today as the older segregation was 50 years
ago. But we, as a people, failed to act. This cannot continue.</TE>
<TE>   So the Supreme Court decided, again, to pull the fire alarm. I
would have preferred that the court take a different approach. Still,
men and women of goodwill can do some fine-tuning. But this cannot
happen unless we all recognize the terrible social injustice this
conservative court declared unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   If this opinion spurs us to finally make good on the promise of
Brown to society's most vulnerable children--if it forces
conservatives and liberal pontificators out of their limousines and
pushes them to honestly work for a more level playing field--then our
system of laws will be better for it.</TE>

<HD>Solution for Argentina Is Right on the Money</HD>
<DH>Importing currency and a banking system would bolster
investors' faith.</DH>

<LD>In Argentina, workers are rioting for a reason. One in five workers
is unemployed, and the gross domestic product has fallen by 25% since
1999. The Argentine peso, which for the last decade was worth a
dollar, is now worth a quarter. The government has defaulted on its
debt, and most banks are technically bankrupt. Financial and human
flight is rampant. The Argentine provinces are printing their own
currencies. Prices are rising and hyperinflation lurks. The nation
has seen five presidents in six months.</LD>
<LD>   And the International Monetary Fund, not to mention the U.S.
government, has largely washed its hands of the country.</LD>
<LD>   How did the Argentine economic miracle of the late 20th century
turn into the economic disaster of the early 21st century? While many
blame an overvalued currency and a lack of fiscal discipline, the
underlying reason was a loss of confidence triggered by economic
shocks elsewhere, from Russia to Brazil. Despite Argentina's decade
of impressive economic performance, no one ever fully trusted its
economic institutions.</LD>
<TE>   The country has a long history of defaulting on investors,
changing the rules of the game and printing money to pay its bills.
This history hangs like a sword of Damocles over any policy, no
matter how well-intentioned and -conducted.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign investors can too easily decide that Argentina isn't
trustworthy and pull out their money.</TE>
<TE>   Given Argentina's financial rap sheet, how can the country acquire
the economic institutions it needs? The answer is simple: Import
them.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina needs to import a whole monetary system, a banking
system and a savings system that are subject to the world's best
supervision.</TE>
<TE>   First, the country should declare the dollar and the euro the sole
forms of legal tender and use its foreign currency reserves to
purchase outstanding pesos and provincial notes.</TE>
<TE>   Making both the dollar and euro legal currencies would reduce the
chance of getting stuck with an overvalued medium of exchange. And by
outlawing the peso, neither the central government nor the provinces
would be able to print money to pay their bills. Hyperinflation would
be a thing of the past. So would outlandishly high interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   Is this radical? Not really.</TE>
<TE>   Ecuador has dollarized its currency. Most of the European Union
has just euroized, and high-debt countries, like Italy, can now
borrow at the same rates as Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Is this different from the Argentine dollar-pegging policy of the
last decade? Yes, because it definitely junks the printing presses.</TE>
<TE>   Abandoning the peso means the government can no longer serve as
lender of last resort to endangered banks. Enter step two, which
eliminates potential bank runs. After the government does what it can
to shore up current deposits, Argentine banks should become branch
offices of major banks in New York, London, Frankfurt and other
banking capitals.</TE>
<TE>   An Argentine depositing funds in, say, Chase Bank in Buenos Aires
would not be dealing with an Argentine subsidiary of Chase Bank but
directly with Chase Bank in New York. Consequently, her account would
be insured by the U.S. government and supervised by New York state
and U.S. federal agencies.</TE>
<TE>   These foreign banks would not only accept deposits, via wire, but,
as confidence in the economy was restored, also make loans to
Argentine businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Argentines need not just safe bank accounts but also secure and
inexpensive ways to invest their savings.</TE>
<TE>   The privatized Argentine pension system was meant to deliver that
for workers. Instead, virtually all of its assets were invested in
now worthless government bonds. That money is gone, but future
investments should be with an offshore account for each Argentine
invested in a single market-weighted global index fund of stocks and
bonds. Such a fund would provide maximum diversification at close to
zero cost.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina also should restructure its debt, replace provincial
government with municipal governance and depoliticize its judiciary.
Fixing the currency, banking and savings systems, however, should be
done today.</TE>
<TE>   Argentines and the rest of the world would get a clear message
that the country is once again a safe place in which to work, save
and invest. Restored confidence would benefit not only Argentina but
also Brazil and other countries in the region that are being infected
by same economic virus that hit Argentina.</TE>

<HD>Does the Postal Service Deliver Value?</HD>
<DH>The USPS should be held more accountable.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEN McELDOWNEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the price of a first-class letter goes up to 37 cents today,
consumers should be angry--but not about having to buy more penny
stamps. They should be angry that the post office doesn't give them
the information they need to evaluate whether an almost 10% rate hike
makes sense.</LD>
<LD>   Part of the problem is that there is no longer adequate oversight
of the United States Postal Service. As an independent government
entity, the USPS has the power to set its own rates. Even the Postal
Regulatory Commission, or PRC, which represents the public and weighs
in on rate-making, has no statutory authority to direct the Postal
Service to follow its advice.</LD>
<LD>   Another problem is that the USPS' finances are so sketchy that
consumers are basically asked to take the agency's word on faith. The
General Accounting Office and even the PRC's Office of the Consumer
Advocate, for example, have called on the Postal Service to provide
the public with better operating and financial information. And no
wonder. Try to make sense of the parts of the financial statements
that the USPS posts online and you'll soon discover you need an
accounting degree.</LD>
<TE>   The one thing that is clear is the USPS is losing a lot of money,
$1.7 billion in fiscal year 2001. However, the service's cloudy
finances make it impossible to know why it's in the red. USPS
executives say they are losing money on first-class mail. Could be,
but it's dangerous to take a monopoly's word on faith.</TE>
<TE>   The need for more information is especially pressing because the
USPS is pushing some major changes in the way it does business, and
that could prove to be a very bad deal for consumers. At the same
time that the USPS is raising the costs of a first-class letter, it
is lowering the cost of services for big commercial mailers. Even
worse, the post office is pushing Congress to give it new authority
to cut the price that junk mailers pay.</TE>
<TE>   The USPS argument for these seemingly outrageous positions is that
by offering volume discounts on postal rates to large commercial
firms the Postal Service will attract a greater volume of commercial
mail--including junk mail--thereby strengthening its overall bottom
line.</TE>
<TE>   There are other serious questions for consumers. Is the rise in
first-class mail rates actually subsidizing junk mail, instead of the
other way around? And why should a public agency be promoting junk
mail, which most U.S. residents consider a nuisance and a waste of
natural resources?</TE>
<TE>   There is also the danger that if the Postal Service begins
charging commercial mailers less for a higher volume of mail, it will
lose even more money. If so, we may look back fondly on 2002 when a
first-class letter cost "only" 37 cents. Increases for first-class
mail may start coming faster and faster, as the USPS subsidizes large
corporate mailers at the expense of consumers and small businesses.</TE>
<TE>   What American consumers want and need from the post office is
universal service. Unless Congress and the public know more about the
financial workings of the USPS and have more controls over the
service's decisions, stamp prices will continue to up while the
Postal Service will go even further into the red.</TE>
<TE>   The USPS certainly faces serious problems that require innovative
solutions. But just asking us to pay more for stamps while taking the
Postal Service's recommendations on blind faith is not the way to go.
The Postal Service should do its best to protect the interests of all
consumers, not just the larger ones, and open up its financial
processes to greater scrutiny.</TE>

<DH>THE FUTURE OF THE PAST, By Alexander Stille, Farrar, Straus
&amp; Giroux:  342 pp., $25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ADAM BRESNICK</AU>
<BD>Adam Bresnick writes for several publications,
including the (London) Times Literary Supplement.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several decades ago, in her magisterial "Art of Memory," Frances
Yates described the constitutive paradox of the post-Gutenberg era.
Once human beings have the capacity to store and retrieve information
easily in books, the techniques of memory that ensured the
transmission of oral tradition start to wither, and humanity begins
to lose touch with its ritual past. Why bother consigning, say, "The
Iliad" to memory when one can buy the book, store it on the shelves
of one's library and read it at one's leisure when one hankers to
hear tell of the wrath of Achilles?</LD>
<LD>   In the manner of the best modern technologies, the mid-15th
century printing press was first and foremost a labor-saving device
that allowed the men and women of the Renaissance to circumvent the
painstaking and costly process of copying out the great books by
hand. So it was that the printing press enabled a staggering
explosion of knowledge during the subsequent five centuries of our
history: Whereas in the 14th century, the Sorbonne's paltry
collection of 1,700 books was the largest library in Europe, in the
early 21st century, the U.S. Library of Congress harbors a collection
of 119 million items.</LD>
<TE>   With this explosion comes a corresponding diminution: While a
Renaissance man in France could well be presumed to have read a good
portion of the volumes in the Sorbonne's collection, no modern person
could peruse a similar fraction of the books available today. No
doubt Leonardo da Vinci was a genius the likes of which are very
rarely seen, but he also had the good fortune to live in an era when
a mind like his could assimilate most of what was known in the West.
The omnivorous Harold Bloom hasn't read even a million books, and by
all accounts he is one of the great speed-readers of the current era.
So it is that we postmoderns must resign ourselves either to the
ghettos of hyper-specialization (think of a plastic surgeon who only
operates on hands or a French medievalist who only writes on "Le
Roman de la Rose") or to the dilettantism of the generalist (think of
any number of newspaper columnists whose musings are out of date by
the end of the morning on which they are published).</TE>
<TE>   The problem has become more acute with the advent of the Internet,
as anyone with a modem now has immediate access to a mind-boggling
amount of information, yet, at the same time, this information has
never appeared more difficult to maintain in our brains.</TE>
<TE>   This dialectic of technological advancement and cultural loss is
at the heart of Alexander Stille's "The Future of the Past," a
fascinating compendium of essays, most of which are culled from the
pages of the New Yorker. The topics range widely, from the dilemmas
faced by species-saving conservationists in Madagascar to the
problems of those who would preserve the Sphinx and Pyramids from
being engulfed by Sahara sands to the vexations of an Indian mahant
who is also a professor of hydraulic engineering trying his best to
clean up the staggering pollution of the Ganges river. Stille is an
unusually engaging, affable guide gifted with the novelist's ability
to sketch characters and the scholar's capacity to explain ideas
without reducing their complexity.</TE>
<TE>   Although Stille's tone is never alarmist and his historical canvas
is large, the book presents the cautionary claim that the future of
our archives and monuments may well be less rosy than we wish. The
very technologies that allow us to safeguard memory are producing a
world that is at once homogenized and fragmented, a virtual world in
which the past crumbles into endless sequences of bytes buried in the
electronic crypts we call databases, just as the natural environment
and cultural artifacts we would enshrine and preserve suffer from
human depredation and temporal decay.</TE>
<TE>   Stille's travelogue is filled with poignant tales of committed, at
times quixotic, individuals who have become guardians of the past by
virtue of their own arts of memory. Take for example the remarkable
story of Giancarlo Scoditti, an Italian anthropologist trained at
Cambridge who traveled in 1973 to Kitawa, a remote island off the
coast of Papua New Guinea famous for its ceremonial carved canoes.
Confronted by an initially insuperable language barrier and an
onslaught of tropical illnesses, Scoditti nearly died during his
first months on the island. Upon recovering his health, he managed to
find his way into the Kitawan language and was eventually introduced
to the islanders' most sacred rituals.</TE>
<TE>   Using writing and tape machines, Scoditti becomes a living
repository for the lore of the island he has adopted as his own. By
the late 1990s, partially as a result of Scoditti's incursion, the
Kitawans had made contact with the modern world, and Scoditti is
saddened to find upon his return that many island youths now eschew
wood for plastic and have abandoned most of the rituals that tie the
island to its ancient past.</TE>
<TE>   Stille beautifully captures the melancholy upshot of modern
anthropology: "[Scoditti's] arrival on the island in 1973 was
providential, and yet the very act of someone's preserving the
culture in writing was also a presage of the culture's eventual
demise, as if this remote culture began to fade when we opened it to
our own curious gaze."</TE>
<TE>   If there is a hero in this book, it would have to be Father
Reginald Foster, a Carmelite monk from Milwaukee who, as senior
Latinist to Pope John Paul II, oversees the Latin programs of the
Vatican and teaches Latin at the Pontifical Gregorian University in
Rome. A truly endearing figure, Foster mixes Augustinian rigor with
old-fashioned American hucksterism in his quest to resuscitate the
dead language to which he has devoted his life. To his summer school
students, he exclaims, "It's out of this world! Latin is simply the
greatest thing that ever happened! Don't let yourself go because you
might just fall in love with it!" Foster is able to speak fluent
Latin in any style and regional accent off the cuff, as he has made
the language live again in the province of his mouth. Reading of
Stille's adventures in Foster's classroom and on various walking
tours of Rome, one cannot but envy the happy few who have studied
with this master pedagogue. As Stille presents it, the disarmingly
witty and charming Foster has performed a kind of resurrective
miracle in the heart of the stolid Vatican culture.</TE>
<TE>   Stille presents a short chapter on the department of special media
preservation at the National Archives in Washington. This is a kind
of museum of obsolete technology, in which there are such oddball
contraptions as the Memovox, a turntable for glass discs that adjusts
its speed as the needle moves toward the center of the platter so
that its speed remains constant; movie projectors equipped with
outdated "push-pull" sound technology from the 1930s; and any number
of formerly cutting-edge computers now consigned to the ash heap of
history as a result of the relentless forward march of
microprocessing speed and hard-drive capacity.</TE>
<TE>   From such detritus, laboratory workers seek what is salvageable,
for "while the late twentieth century will undoubtedly have recorded
more data than any other period of history, it will almost certainly
have lost more information than any previous era." Stille recognizes
the impossibility of this project, noting that it would take an
individual 48 years merely to listen to the 70,000 Memovox recordings
made by the military during World War II. Although the technology of
memory will continue to become ever more sophisticated even as its
objects continue to fritter away, finally it is in men like Foster
that Stille locates a kind of resistance to the inevitable decay of
information. That such eccentric men are so few and far between in
our technologically obsessed world makes Stille's volume that much
more compelling.</TE>

<TE>   From `The Future of the Past'</TE>
<TE>   Today, there is hardly a corner of the globe where Coca-Cola is
not sold or people do not wear Nike sneakers. A few years ago, CNN
ran a program entitled "Broadcasting Live from the Great Mosque at
Mecca!" (In the nineteenth century, the adventurer Richard Burton,
dressed in Bedouin garb and speaking fluent Arabic, had snuck into
the Great Mosque, perhaps the first European to do so.) .... Until
quite recently, there were landscapes that remained unexplored and
uncatalogued.... Those spaces have been reduced to virtually none in
the age of media that, for good and ill, break down all barriers and
leave no doors unopened.</TE>

<LD>TSIGAN</LD>
<LD>   The Gypsy Poem</LD>
<LD>   By Cecilia Woloch</LD>
<TE>   Cahuenga Press: 88 pp., $13 paper</TE>
<TE>   Cecilia Woloch's new book, "Tsigan: The Gypsy Poem," is aptly
subtitled. The poems have an impassioned, wandering, breathless
style, as if the author were relating a harrowing tragedy, a story
that has never before been told. And, in a sense, this is the case.</TE>
<TE>   The background of the Roma, the gypsy people, has never been fully
documented; the elusiveness of the nomadic tribe (both geographically
and historically) is legendary. The poet tracks her paternal
grandmother back to the village in the Carpathian mountains where she
was born, suspecting a blood connection to the gypsies, but her
ancestor's origins remain obscure. There is only the hint of the
half-pejorative, half-awed family reference to gypsy blood that draws
Woloch into a kind of romantic espionage from country to country:</TE>
<TE>   Twilight: moving east</TE>
<TE>   en route to Krosno, moving south</TE>
<TE>   toward that corner of the map</TE>
<TE>   where Poland, Ukraine, Slovakia touch</TE>
<TE>   the upper curve of the crescent moon</TE>
<TE>   of the northernmost Carpathians.</TE>
<TE>   The Lemki, Wallachians--nomads--</TE>
<TE>   followed the curve of this crescent, traveled</TE>
<TE>   the peaks from Romania ....</TE>
<TE>   She records in single-sentence descriptions that multiply, page to
page, like gravestones, the atrocities committed over the centuries
against the Roma. Still, during her travels, she is warned by a
scholar of gypsy culture that "it would be nonsense to create
personal mythologies."</TE>
<TE>   This is the question the reader, caught up in the intoxicating
swirl of language, may ask: Are we reading this meditation on
diaspora as the author's desire to document a kind of psychological
ancestry or as a way back to the sources of literary self-invention?</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the book's elusive intentions are less compelling than the
poet's own answer to the cautioning scholar:</TE>
<TE>   I'd like to write</TE>
<TE>   my name in snow;</TE>
<TE>   I'd like to fly ...</TE>
<TE>   into the blank page.</TE>
<TE>   Like Keats' epitaph--"Here lies one whose name was writ in
water"--Woloch seems to be telling us how the essence of poetry is
its own disappearance into silence, how improbable this mystery has
always been for the bourgeois mind, the government of convention, how
removed is the gypsy soul from the armed borders and maps, from the
sad republic of clocks.</TE>

<TE>   AN ANTHOLOGY OF VIETNAMESE POEMS</TE>
<TE>   Edited and translated by</TE>
<TE>   Huynh Sanh Thong</TE>
<TE>   Yale University Press: 444 pp., $20</TE>
<TE>   Ever since the mid-century War of the Anthologies which pitted
Donald Allen's selection of poets (including the newcomer Allen
Ginsberg) against Donald Hall's more formal choices, many anthologies
have tried to make "statements," often haplessly. The worst offenders
here, to my mind, are anthology editors who insist on forcing poems
into an invented ill-fitting "aesthetic," hoping to generate more
literary groundfire (and a few book sales).</TE>
<TE>   This reductionist mentality is especially ironic given that the
term anthology derives from the Greek for "flower-gathering,"
implying that the editor's task is to pick an innately subjective and
somewhat random bouquet of blooms. Given this tradition, there is
dignity and intensity (not to mention an enormous volume of
"gardening") implicit in the selections in "An Anthology of
Vietnamese Poems." The work does not avoid "politics"--rather
demonstrates its transformation into poetry. The selections (and
straightforward translations) of Huynh Sanh Thong include poems from
the 11th through the 20th centuries, 322 works by about 150 poets,
"celebrated, obscure, or anonymous," as the editor notes. These poems
document the many and diverse strains of Vietnamese poetry (building
on some aspects of an earlier anthology, "The Heritage of Vietnamese
Poetry") and are organized loosely into "themes" that add up to a
complex and fascinating view of the expressive tradition in
Vietnam--seen through various lenses, including "the role of art in
life" and "war and peace."</TE>
<TE>   Reading this book reminds one that an anthology's editorial
subjectivity can be either eye-opening and informative--or simply
limiting. Here the political devastation of war clarifies itself into
a lyric reminiscent of "The River Merchant's Wife":</TE>
<TE>   You told me once you'd meet me in Lung-hsi--</TE>
<TE>   from dawn I looked for you but saw no trace ...</TE>
<TE>   At noon the village woke to shrill birds' cries.</TE>

<DH>THE DOUBLE BOND: Primo Levi: A Biography, By Carole Angier,
Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux:  898 pp., $40</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN GORNICK</AU>
<BD>Vivian Gornick is a contributing writer to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After Primo Levi killed himself in 1987, people everywhere believed
that Auschwitz had got him at last. But just as many, if not more,
believed that if it hadn't been for Auschwitz, he would have killed
himself years earlier. The war, in fact, it was thought, had
lengthened Levi's life because the experience of the concentration
camp gave him writing, and it was writing alone that controlled the
lifelong distress under which he apparently labored. Bearing witness
had allowed (perhaps commanded) his inner agitation to ease up and
retreat sufficiently so that he could enter the talent for
philosophical observation that had always been his but, until the
war, had been without sufficient content to find form. Auschwitz had
freed him to become the artist he so clearly was, and for 40 years
afterward, writing held despair in check: Only at the very end did it
fail to win the day.</LD>
<TE>   Primo Levi was born in the north Italian city of Turin in 1916
into a family of secular, middle-class Jews who had been living in
the Piedmont for generations. He grew up in a neighborhood something
like the Brooklyn of 60 years ago, surrounded by aunts, uncles,
grandparents, friends and neighbors who remained solidly in place
until the war, and even long after. Levi was smart, overprotected and
filled from earliest youth with a trembling inner sensitivity of
inexplicable proportion. He seemed to be afraid of everything, most
especially of sexual experience. He wanted to be a physicist but
became an industrial chemist instead. He longed for the world but did
not dare leave home. He fell rapturously, repeatedly in love but only
"from the waist up." Except for a year in Milan, a year in Auschwitz,
and another getting home, he lived and died in the house in which he
was born. When he got married, it was to a woman as fearful as
himself who readily agreed to move into the apartment with him and
his widowed mother. At the time of his death--he leaped from the
third floor into the open stairwell of this very building--his grown
son was living across the hall, his daughter down the street and his
boyhood friends all over the neighborhood. Auschwitz, as Levi himself
said, was his only adventure.</TE>
<TE>   "Survival in Auschwitz" (published originally under the far more
apt title "If This Is a Man") is, by any standard, one of the most
remarkable books in Holocaust literature. What makes it remarkable is
its talent for engaged detachment. The man who trembled before women
and had been afraid to leave home, now, having come out of hell and
wanting to take the reader back in with him, found that for his
purposes nothing could be more useful than a prose stripped of
sentiment, informed by observation rather than emotion. And indeed,
the calm of its tone, the breadth of its perspective, the originality
of its intention makes "Survival in Auschwitz" accumulate into a way
of seeing things that produces sentences, in Philip Roth's inspired
phrase, "suffused with mind." Herein lies its accomplishment: A man
endowed with an unusually lucid intelligence uses this intelligence
to describe a world that had been intent not so much on destroying
his body as on wiping out that mind.</TE>
<TE>   Once in the camp, Levi quickly realized that what he was
witnessing was the phenomenon of men having to reduce other men to
the subhuman, so that they could go on killing, without themselves
becoming deranged; and, analogously, what it meant, as a prisoner, to
be so reduced. In essence, Levi set out to bring us "the evil tidings
of what man's presumption made of man in Auschwitz."</TE>
<TE>   Two incidents, in particular, illustrate his thesis neatly. The
first concerns the moment when he is brought before the SS officer
who is to decide whether he can be put to work as a chemist in the
nearby synthetic rubber factory. When Levi is brought into the room,
the German is sitting at his desk, writing:</TE>
<TE>   "When he finished writing, he raised his eyes and looked at me.</TE>
<TE>   "From that day I have thought about Docktor Pannwitz many times
and in many ways.... [W]hen I was once more a free man, I wanted to
meet him again, not from a spirit of revenge, but merely from a
personal curiosity about the human soul.</TE>
<TE>   "Because that look was not one between two men; and if I had known
how completely to explain the nature of that look, which came as if
across the glass window of an aquarium between two beings who live in
different worlds, I would also have explained the essence of the
great insanity of the third Germany "</TE>
<TE>   The second incident takes place after what proved to be the last
selection for the gas chamber in October 1944. A man in his hut is
praying aloud, thanking God that he has not been chosen, even though
another man in the hut has been chosen. Levi writes:</TE>
<TE>   "Can Kuhn fail to realize that next time it will be his turn? Does
Kuhn not understand that what has happened today is an abomination,
which no propitiatory prayer, no pardon, no expiation by the guilty,
nothing at all in the power of man can ever clean again?</TE>
<TE>   "If I was God, I would spit at Kuhn's prayer."</TE>
<TE>   "Survival in Auschwitz" will be read when memoirs that are only
testimony are forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   Death pursued Levi in Auschwitz but, once home, it was the person
he had been before who, as it turned out, was still there, remarkably
intact, waiting. Slowly, the fears, the anxieties, the depressions,
all returned full force. It is really quite amazing that he kept them
from closing in long enough to write the books that distinguish his
name.</TE>
<TE>   The biographer of an artist has one obligation and one only: to
make the reader come away with a richer understanding of the
relationship between the life and the work. A few who more than earn
their way are Richard Holmes on Coleridge, James Lord on Alberto
Giacometti, Judith Thurman on Isak Dineson, W. Jackson Bate on Samuel
Johnson, Anne Stevenson on Sylvia Plath. The excellence of their
books is derived from an affinity between subject and biographer that
guides the work as a whole, is organized around one or two powerful
insights and illuminates the subject's work anew. "Bitter Fame,"
Stevenson's book on Plath, is a fine example of the genre at its
best.</TE>
<TE>   Every English-speaking reader of poetry knew that Sylvia Plath was
angry because Daddy died; but, ah, what did we know from anger?
Stevenson makes us experience Plath's rage in all its breath-taking
command. The rage was her true intimate: It had no rival. We see it
as an embrace into which she sank without a struggle. The poems could
indicate its strength, depth, and originality, but, finally, it was
only suicide that could distinguish it. Stevenson's book concentrates
so intelligently on Plath's self-consumption that, at last, we
understand it in our nerve endings. After "Bitter Fame," one does not
again read the poems as one did before.</TE>
<TE>   "The Double Bond," Carole Angier's biography of Primo Levi, is the
work of a writer who has obsessed over her subject for 10 years and
makes of her obsession an integral part of the life she has written.
The result--an exasperating amalgam of the ambitious and the
reductive, the insightful and the presumptuous--is a book dominated
by a girlishly proprietary tone, a single insight repeated like a
mantra and an insecurity that leads Angier to insert herself
inappropriately into the text. Moreover, she has been allowed the
indulgence of an outrageous 800 pages, fully one half of which are
paraphrasings of Levi's books: as though a cram course for
recalcitrant students is being worked up. All this is a pity, as
Angier's insight is genuine, and her interpretation persuasive.</TE>
<TE>   What she sees, primarily--and this with admirable clarity--is the
all-in-allness of Levi's sexual inhibition: that it went right down
to the center, that it indicated an inner division of fatal
proportion, that it would make him grow into a man whose fearfulness
was a life sentence. This is Angier's insight. Now the task was to
put flesh on that insight so that it invigorated the tale being told,
held firm as an organizing principle and illuminated not the Primo
Levi who was terrified of women but the one who wrote the books.
Instead, Angier surrounds it with the noise of overwriting, unfailing
reductiveness and an irritating self-involvement. She thinks her
interviewees tell her things they tell no one else; she declares each
and every one either Levi's "twin" or his "opposite"; she interprets
events and decisions as a triumph or a defeat for either the sexually
unhappy Levi or the scientist-philosopher Levi. And all this is
repeated without variation or surprise or development.</TE>
<TE>   The Swiss Italian sculptor Alberto Giacometti was also an artist
who suffered from sexual impotence. Women became his heaven and his
hell: He couldn't have them and couldn't leave them alone. His
"wound" led him ever deeper into an abstraction of thought and
feeling that directly determined the course of his working life.
James Lord, in a sustained effort at biography, captures the dynamic
perfectly. Last year, at a retrospective of Giacometti's work, I
walked through the museum rooms, Lord's biography haunting my vision,
pierced with the pleasure of knowing, as I felt I did, how Giacometti
had gotten from the frightening 1932 "Woman With Her Throat Cut" to
the deeply moving 1956 "Women of Venice."</TE>
<TE>   The Primo Levi who trembled before women was also the Primo Levi
who stood brilliantly alert before the Nazis. It is the relation
between these two, not the division, that we need to have
sufficiently brought to life: how one converted into the other until
a transformation occurred, and a third Levi emerged, speaking with
strength and rue and delicacy into the radiantly clear air of a
writer's thought. For this, a concentrated piece of introspection
coupled with a story-teller's gift for narration is required of a
Primo Levi biographer yet to come.</TE>

<DH>A SIMPLE HABANA MELODY (FROM WHEN THE WORLD WAS GOOD): A
Novel, By Oscar Hijuelos, HarperCollins: 342 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL HARRIS</AU>
<BD>Michael Harris is a regular contributor to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The narrative of Oscar Hijuelos' sixth novel, "A Simple Habana
Melody," mimics the dance of water circling a bathtub drain. Gravity
sucks the story down--toward Cuban composer Israel Levis' ordeal in
Buchenwald during World War II--but centrifugal force eddies it away,
just as the shattered Levis, returning to Havana in 1947, prefers to
dwell on the sweeter years of his youth, when he was a musical
prodigy and bon vivant.</LD>
<LD>   Despite his Semitic-sounding name, Levis is not a Jew but a devout
Catholic. It's a bureaucratic mistake that he is arrested in
Nazi-occupied Paris late in the war and imprisoned in "a munitions
complex that was not a 'death camp,' but a place in whose harsh
conditions and punitive regimens many perished, anyway .... For the
next 14 months, the maestro did not believe the things he saw, nor
the sounds he heard."</LD>
<TE>   Once a famously fat man whose appetite for food and drink
reflected his gusto for life, Levis emerges shrunken and frail, old
at 57, no longer interested in making music. Like other composers
fated to be remembered for what they considered trifles (think of
Paul Dukas and "The Sorcerer's Apprentice"), Levis is famed not for
his operas or concertos but for a rumba, "Rosas Puras" (Pretty
Roses), which he dashed off in 20 minutes in 1928 for singer Rita
Valladares, the unacknowledged love of his life. The song has brought
the world pleasure, but after Buchenwald, can that possibly matter?</TE>
<TE>   Once a modest, kindly man who lived with his widowed mother, gave
young musicians free lessons and refused to take sexual advantage of
the girls who sang and danced in his theatrical productions, Levis
has become grim and short-tempered. He is welcomed home by relatives,
and honored by the Cuban government, but as he settles into the old
house in Havana where, in the heady early years of the island's
independence, he was the happy child of loving parents, he views the
rest of his life as meaningless.</TE>
<TE>   In this novel, Hijuelos has combined the musical lore of his
Pulitzer Prize-winning "The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love" with a
spiritual crisis like that in "Mr. Ives' Christmas," in which the
protagonist's son, studying for the priesthood, is senselessly
killed. His method is to write the novel as a mock biography of the
fictional Levis, quickly summarizing his life up to 1947, then
(leapfrogging Buchenwald) going back to the beginning, when the
5-year-old Levis, watching his doctor father play Bach on the piano
and memorizing the fingering, steps to the keyboard and plays two
flawless measures. The biographical approach allows Hijuelos to
expand on the history of Cuban music and to digress on political
matters that Levis prefers to ignore.</TE>
<TE>   Music is such a complete world for Levis that he is only vaguely
troubled by the dictatorship of Gerardo Machado in the late 1920s and
early 1930s, though his best friend and lyricist, Manny Cortez, joins
a rebel movement and is assassinated. When the Germans march into
Paris in 1940, Levis believes that this madness, too, will pass, and
doesn't realize that his affair with a Jewish woman, Sarah
Rubenstein, will confirm the authorities' suspicions about him.</TE>
<TE>   Levis has moved to Paris in the 1930s to stay in contact with
Valladares, who, thanks to that city's craze for "tropical" music,
has become a star. She loves Levis, but he maddeningly refuses to
treat her as more than a friend. In truth, he can't believe that a
woman so beautiful could love him. And he is unsettled by his
attraction to other men, impermissible for a good Catholic. As she
diverts herself with four marriages, he consoles himself in brothels,
sinning, to be sure, but within the limits a traditional society
found acceptable.</TE>
<TE>   As "A Simple Habana Melody" winds down, as traditional societies
crumble under the assaults of 20th century nihilism, we wonder
whether Hijuelos, after circling Buchenwald for so long, will finally
show us more of the place than the weekly parties at camp
headquarters for which Nazi leaders dress Levis in a dead man's suit
and compel him to perform.</TE>
<TE>   Will Levis and Valladares, reunited after the war, finally
overcome their reticence? Will Levis, shorn of faith in God and
music, succumb to silence and despair? The answers, this novel leads
us to suspect, lie in its hero's gentle character; the water, even at
the drain's dark rim, sparkles with nostalgia.</TE>

Washington, D.C., during one of the most momentous years of the last
century. Its author, John Knox, was an ambitious young Harvard Law
School graduate who snared a clerkship at the U.S. Supreme Court by
becoming pen pals with several justices during college and law school
and then inviting himself to Washington to meet with them. Along the
way, he crossed paths with dozens of ambitious young men drawn to
Washington by the New Deal, including Alger Hiss and future Michigan
Gov. G. Mennen "Soapy" Williams.</LD>
<LD>   By March 1935, Knox was on "such familiar terms" with his pen pal
Justice Benjamin Cardozo that he telegraphed him to beg for a ticket
to Oliver Wendell Holmes' funeral. Cardozo obliged, and Knox took
several days off from his studies at Harvard and met with Justice
Willis Van Devanter for half an hour before the funeral. Eventually,
he persuaded Van Devanter to pass his resume to Justice James
McReynolds.</LD>
<TE>   When McReynolds agreed to hire him as his clerk for the 1936-37
term, Knox became the only Harvard Law School student to reach the
Supreme Court in this era without the influential sponsorship of
Felix Frankfurter, who was a Harvard Law School professor before
joining the court in 1939. According to the book's introduction,
"Knox had parlayed fascination with celebrity into a ... clerkship
for a member of the Supreme Court of the United States, but he
scarcely had any idea of what (or whom) he was in for."</TE>
<TE>   Though brilliant at flattery, Knox was only moderately competent
as a lawyer, and he ended his career as an insurance adjustor. He
tried several times to interest publishers in his memoirs but never
managed to get them published during his lifetime. It fell to two
professors, Dennis Hutchinson of the University of Chicago and David
Garrow of Emory University Law School, to rescue the manuscript,
which gives a portrait of a Washington that disappeared several
decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   The book's depiction of McReynolds, who served on the court from
1914 to 1941, reminds us of how recently a virulent anti-Semitism
resided in some of our most important government officials.
McReynolds so detested Justices Cardozo and Louis D. Brandeis (who
were both Jewish) that no official court photograph exists for 1924,
because McReynolds refused to sit next to Brandeis as protocol
required; during Cardozo's swearing in, he ostentatiously continued
to read a newspaper at the bench.</TE>
<TE>   McReynolds was a Kentucky native "who viewed public education and
the virtue of the common man as humbugs." He came to Washington to be
a trust buster for President Theodore Roosevelt. Woodrow Wilson
appointed him attorney general, only to promote him to the U.S.
Supreme Court because he was such a disruptive Cabinet member. His
deep-seated racism (McReynolds once sparked a public outrage by
declaring his determination to protect "the poorest darky ... as well
as the man of wealth in a mansion") was constantly on display in
front of his clerk--even though most of the comforts this lifelong
bachelor enjoyed flowed out of the "Driving Miss Daisy" relationship
he had with his devoted black messenger, Harry Parker, and his black
maid, Mary. Harry and Mary call the judge "Pussywillow" behind his
back, and Harry is constantly warning Knox to steer clear of the
justice's female friends if he wants to avoid provoking his jealousy.</TE>
<TE>   What gives the book its importance is the period it covers: Knox's
clerkship coincided with Franklin Roosevelt's ill-fated attempt to
"pack" the Supreme Court with additional justices after it had
overturned so many of the laws which made up the New Deal.</TE>
<TE>   Congress refused to go along with Roosevelt's plan, but after the
plan was announced, the court began to affirm many of Roosevelt's
most important pieces of legislation (including a minimum-wage law)
by 5-4 margins. When the reactionary majority disappeared, after
Justice Owen J. Roberts began to vote to affirm Roosevelt's
initiatives, Knox rightly notes that he was "witnessing the end of an
era and the death of an entire way of thinking ... America was indeed
at a turn of the road."</TE>
<TE>   The high drama of the court's confrontation with the president and
the backstairs intrigue in McReynolds' elegant Washington apartment
combine to produce an irresistible volume. And a photograph in the
book gives it an interesting link to the present day. By 1952, Knox
and McReynolds were long gone from the court, but Parker, McReynolds'
devoted messenger, was still there, working for Associate Justice
Robert H. Jackson. That year, Parker posed for a photograph with
Jackson's new clerk, William Rehnquist. As chief justice of the
Supreme Court, Rehnquist and his allies have written many opinions
that have resurrected the same kind of federalism that McReynolds
championed before 1937.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `The Forgotten Memoir of John Knox'</TE>
<TE>   Some days, after burning his morning mail, McReynolds would become
unusually restless and then decide to go out for a walk. At such
times he always carried his walking stick with him, which was made of
strong wood and was rather heavy. Soon after the anonymous letters
and postcards began arriving, however, Harry announced that the
Justice should not go out alone for fear of his being assaulted in
broad daylight.... "I'll go alone--like I always have!" McReynolds
would reply heatedly. "If anybody dares hit me, why, why, I'll strike
him with this walking stick!"</TE>

<HD>Art After Auschwitz</HD>
<DH>THE MEMORY ROOM, A Novel, By Mary Rakow, Counterpoint: 512
pp., $26</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN KIRSCH</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Kirsch, a contributing writer to the Book
Review, is the author of, most recently, "The Woman Who Laughed at
God: The Untold History of the Jewish People."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The title of Mary Rakow's first novel refers to a commonplace of
California life. The memory room is a therapist's office, and
Barbara, Rakow's main character, turns to psychotherapy to cope with
what appears to be a nervous breakdown. But to describe "The Memory
Room" as a novel of a woman in a midlife crisis fails to capture the
lofty ambition and the high achievement embodied in this book.</LD>
<LD>   Barbara may live in the comfort and safety of contemporary Los
Angeles, but she is literally haunted by history, both her own
intimate history and that of the Holocaust, all of it expressed with
rich and daring wordplay--fragments of poetry, flashes of free
association, the fugue-like interplay of childhood memories and
scenes from concentration camps. None of it, however, conceals the
sheer horror of what Barbara endured as a child growing up in
deceptively bland Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   At the dark heart of "The Memory Room" is a crime against a young
child. A clue is presented to the reader when Barbara's mother tells
her 4-year-old daughter: "I am making you pretty for Daddy." Not long
into the tale that Rakow tells so hauntingly and so harrowingly, the
terrible irony in those words is plain--Barbara's father was not
merely a child molester but a child torturer, and Barbara's mother
was his coldhearted accomplice.</LD>
<TE>   The touchstones of Barbara's inner world--and the weapons she uses
to keep her demons at bay--are art, horticulture, music, poetry,
psychology and the Bible. Above all, she invokes the work of the poet
Paul Celan, a Holocaust survivor who eventually took his own life. It
is his poetry, his words and phrases, that comfort her and keep her
sane. "He is Boaz," Barbara says of Celan, invoking the gleaning of
the fields that figures so crucially in the Bible's most poignant
love story. "I am Ruth."</TE>
<TE>   Psychotherapy is not her only or even her most important source of
succor. Barbara is a convert from Protestantism to Catholicism, and
she craves rituals and relics, martyred saints and the crucified
Christ, as she acts out her own Passion play. She is drawn to the
baroque setting of the Mission Santa Barbara for a healing service;
when she attends a concert at a Methodist church, the spare
surroundings strike her as barren:</TE>
<TE>   "I need a real altar.</TE>
<TE>   A place where violence</TE>
<TE>   is performed</TE>
<TE>   and regularly observed.</TE>
<TE>   A place where violence has a</TE>
<TE>   chance to become something</TE>
<TE>   else."</TE>
<TE>   Barbara is blessed with more than one rescuer, it turns out.
Between an elderly neighbor, Josephine, ("Honey," she tells Barbara,
"sometimes you're just too brainy for your own good") and a
compassionate lover, Daniel, Barbara finds rare moments of ease and
comfort and even good humor.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Always buy unlined gloves, and always a half-size smaller than
your hand,' Josephine coached when I was going with Daniel to New
York. 'It's the only way a woman from Los Angeles can look
intelligent.'</TE>
<TE>   "Daniel replied, 'Barbara always looks intelligent, Josephine.' "
But the ugly secrets always assert themselves, and Barbara is dragged
back into the pit of despair that was her childhood. As the memories
become ever more vivid, ever more detailed and ever more repulsive,
Barbara is reduced to a cry of pain:</TE>
<TE>   "Dies irae</TE>
<TE>   Days of wrath</TE>
<TE>   Dies illa</TE>
<TE>   O day of mourning!"</TE>
<TE>   Rakow is a compelling storyteller, but what distinguishes "The
Memory Room" from less accomplished work is its sheer abundance of
literary ornamentation and invention. Her prose is sometimes
scattered across the page like fragments of verse and the text
sometimes shatters into shards--random utterances, stray lines of
poetry and echoes of the Psalms, as if to show us the chaos that
always threatens to destroy Barbara. "The severed ear listens," goes
one such scrawl, followed by the phrase that Barbara, so needful of
both healing and shelter, repeats like a mantra: "Who will bring me
into the strong city?" Then, too, Rakow takes a certain moral risk
when she allows Barbara, a woman who is shown to putter in her garden
and clean out her clothes closet, to conjure up--and identify
with--the doomed figure of Celan's "Deathfugue," a Jewish woman who
spends her last days in the hell-on-Earth of a death camp. "All
cruelty is the same," Barbara says. "Only goodness is singular." But
we might wonder whether the private horror of sexual abuse is
equivalent to the vast grotesqueries of the Holocaust.</TE>
<TE>   Rakow acknowledges both her debt to Celan and, at least by
implication, the charges that might be laid against her for resorting
to his words to describe her character's pain: "A prisoner in her
cell writes a plagiarism on the walls," Barbara muses at one
anguished moment. "A poet's words instead of her own." And Rakow's
book reminds us that the observation once made about victims of the
Holocaust such as Celan--"The tortured stay tortured"--is surely
applicable to a woman who was the victim of sexual torture by her own
father.</TE>
<TE>   Significantly, Rakow holds advanced degrees in theology from
Harvard University and Boston College: "The Memory Room" is deeply
concerned with the issues that are the real stuff of religion, the
reasons why we suffer and the things we do to relieve our suffering.
Indeed, it is the moral seriousness of Rakow's book, as much as its
literary inventiveness, that elevates her work to the realm of
literature: "All art is this," she writes. "All art is memory."</TE>

<LD>To the editor:</LD>
<LD>   In his otherwise shrewd dissection of Anthony Blunt (April 21) and
Miranda Carter's excellent biography of that mole among the royals,
"Anthony Blunt: His Lives," Christopher Hitchens asserts that
"Blunt's insistence on the primacy of the aesthetic trumped all his
other loyalties: He could never bring himself to praise Picasso's
'Guernica' even when the party line might have mandated otherwise."</LD>
<LD>   This simply isn't true. Blunt was always ready to trim his (always
uncertain) aesthetic principles at need, and "Guernica" was no
exception. Carter (pp. 414-5) reports how by 1961 he was describing
that picture as the climax of Picasso's oeuvre, "in which, for me at
any rate, all his prowess both of imagination and of intellectual
control are manifest," and as "the last great painting in the
European tradition."</LD>
<TE>   A year or two later, I personally heard Blunt deliver this lecture
in Athens, with every sign of committed enthusiasm.</TE>

opposing stem-cell research as "this Luddite trend." The Luddites who
smashed weaving machines at the beginning of the 19th century were
not opposed to progress per se, but rather to rampant unrestrained
industrialization, which they wisely foresaw (and personally

<HD>Why Mussolini Still Matters</HD>
<DH>MUSSOLINI, By R.J.B. Bosworth, Oxford University Press /
Arnold: 584 pp., $35</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT MALLETT</AU>
<BD>Robert Mallett is the author of "The Italian Navy and
Fascist Expansionism, 1935-1940" and the editor of "International
Fascism, 1919-1945."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A quasi-Chaplinesque image of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini has
prevailed since his violent death in April 1945. Postwar biographers
of the Italian Duce  delivered a succession of body blows to the
man's reputation so severe that his transmogrification from brutal
fascist to a "sawdust Caesar" now dominates many popular perceptions
of him. Fascist Italy's mediocre--at best--military performance in
World War II, a performance so glaringly out of sync with the
dictator's imperial pretensions, fueled such interpretations of his
life. Thus Mussolini became a buffoon and clown, a second-rate
sanguinario not in the same league as Hitler and Stalin.</LD>
<LD>   Aside from the fact that such notions of the man and his regime
are at best simplistic, this ridicule has invariably generated
considerable resentment within Italy. Certainly a challenge to
prevailing ideas about Mussolini and fascism was not long in emerging
and came, inevitably, from the right of the Italian political
spectrum.</LD>
<TE>   While not openly pro-fascist, the work of such prominent scholars
as the late Renzo De Felice were certainly far less critical than
that of many of their non-Italian counterparts. The De Felice clique
erased or played down the less palatable aspects of the fascist era
in Italy (domestic repression, colonial brutality, international
delinquency and aggressive militarism) and attempted to argue that
Mussolini had been no more than a benign autocrat diligently
defending Italy from the Bolshevik and even Germanic hordes. In
political terms De Felice's approach has found a ready resonance in
the Italy of today, where both the governing coalition's Alleanza
Nazionale component and groups such as the neo-fascist Forza Nuova
look to Mussolini as a sort of ideological messiah and insist that De
Felice's multivolume biography is an honest and accurate analysis of
his life and politics.</TE>
<TE>   Needless to say the two viewpoints are fiercely and mutually
hostile to each other, and will remain so. Anyone, like Australian
social historian R.J.B. Bosworth, who treads on this political
minefield is a brave individual indeed. Not only do authors who
tackle the question of interpreting Mussolini's ideological outlook
face a tricky and controversial intellectual quagmire, but they do so
at a time when the politics of the extreme right are again in vogue
in continental Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Bosworth's new assessment of Mussolini emerges at a moment when
the belief that social exclusion, this time around founded on the
crass idea that immigrants and "asylum seekers" should be forcibly
repatriated, has again gained alarming levels of support in
mainstream European societies such as France, Holland and, yes,
Italy. This makes it critically important to expose the fallacy of
such notions, based, effectively, on "purifying" society, last time
around.</TE>
<TE>   Bosworth's overall approach is to chart a middle way between De
Felicean apologia and the derision of orthodox Anglo-American
academic scholarship. For Bosworth, Italy under il Duce was, and
remained, "the least of the Great Powers" and, by implication,
Mussolini constituted the lesser evil in a century besmirched by Nazi
and Stalinist atrocities. As he argues, Mussolini was "cruel (but not
the cruelest)," racist but in an "erratic" and "unscientific" way.
Revealing his own background as a social historian of Italy, Bosworth
refutes "intentionalist" scholars who argue that Mussolini led from
the front. As far as Bosworth's work is concerned, "to a considerable
degree Mussolini did not even dictate" but, on the contrary, had been
swept along by "destiny."</TE>
<TE>   Of course not everyone will agree with Bosworth's general
arguments. For one thing his view that Mussolinian imperialism was
"old-fashioned" and "ramshackle," and therefore very different from
National Socialism's racially driven quest for Lebensraum, is not
entirely convincing. Mussolini's policy during the Libyan war of
"reconquest" (1921-31) was violent and repressive in the extreme,
being based on the imposition of "fascist" rule in the rebellious
Italian colony. Likewise, fascist aggression against Ethiopia
(1935-40) was marked by widespread use of mustard gas, mass
executions and indiscriminate violence against "racial inferiors,"
many of them women and children. More to the point, such barbarity
was undertaken by the fascist military on Mussolini's direct
instructions. While there can be no doubting Bosworth's integrity and
his repugnance for such activities, his attempt to quantify the
question of inhumanity by claiming that fascist barbarity paled into
insignificance alongside Hitler's "Night of the Long Knives" in June
1934 and the Stalinist purges, relegates Mussolini to a sort of
second division for despots. This approach misses the point. The fact
is that Mussolini was responsible for the deaths of about 1 million
human beings and the suffering of countless others. In addition, in
1939, with the full horror of National Socialist Darwinian-style
"social cleansing" already plainly manifest, he signed the Pact of
Steel with Hitler and embarked on his long-anticipated European war.
Would Mussolini have attempted to restrain the Fuhrer's murderous
racial program had the Rome-Berlin Axis prevailed? Did he attempt to
dissuade the Nazi hierarchy from pursuing the persecution of European
Jewry? The answer to both questions is no.</TE>
<TE>   This leads neatly into the question of how Bosworth does,
ultimately, interpret the nature of Mussolini and fascismo. For the
sake of brevity we might look at two of his book's main themes: the
extent to which  il Duce conceived of his movement as "totalitarian,"
and the revolutionary nature--or otherwise--of Italian foreign policy
under his stewardship. Bosworth casts some doubt on Mussolini's
"totalitarian" credentials. He believes that il Duce, a pragmatist,
kept his options open and did not automatically select the route to a
total state, one in which an institutionalized political religion
built around the cult of his personality would replace a tired Roman
Catholicism. Mussolini was, Bosworth concludes, too cynical to
believe in such solutions. He kept his options open, and even sought
a reconciliation with his old socialist friends once in power. This
view flies in the face of considerable work, particularly the work of
renowned historian Emilio Gentile, which argues to the contrary.
Gentile and many others stress that fascism was a revolutionary
ideology whose objective was the total annihilation of existing
Italian political and social forms and their replacement with new,
fascist models. This revolution, by its very nature, would extend
into the soul of society, for it was only here that the total
conquest of the human spirit was possible. Bosworth is right to
conclude that this experiment failed in Italy. But this was not
through any lack of conviction on the part of Mussolini. Rather, this
failure is best explained by the dictator's need to temper his
revolutionary ardor in order to comply with powerful Italian vested
interests (the monarchy, industry, the Vatican), that were more
conservative by nature.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, then, Bosworth also denies any Mussolinian
master plan in the field of international politics. He rightly
defines the debate on fascist diplomacy as founded on a
"contradiction between words and deeds." In short, Mussolini seemed
rich on bombastic war-like rhetoric but short on concrete action. In
fairness this argument is more pertinent when applied to the first
decade of fascist rule, a period when Mussolini lacked an apogee in
the form of Hitler's Germany. Its explanation is simple. The fascist
leader may have, as Bosworth notes, ordered an assault on Yugoslavia
in 1926 but this was "not followed up," as he puts it, simply because
the Italian military leadership refused to endorse it given that it
would also involve a clash with Belgrade's main ally, France. Later,
with Hitler neatly installed in Berlin, the Italian regime did wage
wars (in Ethiopia, Spain and Albania), and prepared for a great
Mediterranean confrontation with the Anglo-French empires sometime in
1942 by forging the Axis alignment and bankrupting the national
exchequer through military spending. In short, ambition and intent
were plainly evident in fascist foreign policy; what was lacking in
1939-40 were completed armaments programs and raw materials.</TE>
<TE>   Bosworth has produced a competent, readable account of il Duce's
life that will undoubtedly contribute to the debate on fascism. Had
he exposed the true bleakness, and degeneracy of Mussolini's
revolutionary ideology, Bosworth would perhaps have better shown the
errors of treading the same path in the 21st century. We do so at our
peril. It is essential that we remember this.</TE>

<HD>Just How Good Was She?</HD>
<DH>MAY SARTON: Selected Letters, 1955-1995, Edited by Susan
Sherman, W.W. Norton: 448 pp., $39.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REGINA MARLER</AU>
<BD>Regina Marler is the author of "Bloomsbury Pie: The
Making of the Bloomsbury Boom."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For May Sarton's devoted readers, the real story since she died seven
years ago is not the continued sales of her best-known books or the
recent independent shoot of "Mrs. Stevens Hears the Mermaids Singing"
but the shock and insult of Margot Peters' 1997 biography. Sarton,
who warily handed over boxes of letters to her chosen biographer, had
worried that the finished product would be less than flattering. But
she could not have predicted how deeply unsympathetic Peters would
become toward her in a book that gave new bite to the term "critical
biography."</LD>
<LD>   Now the defenders of Sarton, and her self-searching poems and
novels, are rallying. Close friend Susan Sherman has just edited the
second volume of Sarton's "Selected Letters," a warm and animated
collection that is like the arm a mother throws out to protect the
child sitting beside her in a car.</LD>
<LD>   The Sarton of the "Selected Letters" is roughly the Sarton of her
journals ("The House by the Sea," "After the Stroke"): a wise old
woman standing by a rose bush. In these 200 unabridged letters,
Sherman documents Sarton's passion for civil rights, her
openhandedness, her joie de vivre, her loyalty--even to old friends
who disliked her writing or who sent homophobic responses to her
later books.</LD>
<TE>   Sherman does not exactly whitewash Sarton, but in reading the
biography and the letters in tandem, it becomes clear how selective
the "Selected Letters" really are. The bratty, blaming side of
Sarton, so effectively documented by Peters, is not to be found here.
There are very few letters to her muses--the women, often
heterosexual, who inspired her poems and who so bitterly disappointed
her--and almost none to her good friend Carolyn Heilbrun, whose
severe criticisms of Sarton's later books are quoted in the
biography. We also know from the biography that she was prone to
tantrums, one of which resulted in an eight-year break in her
friendship with artist Bill Brown: again, unexplained in Sherman's
volume. The collected letters and the biography are so polarized, in
fact, that it is hard to assemble from them a plausible image of
Sarton.</TE>
<TE>   Sarton would not have been surprised by the battle over her
posthumous reputation. Although delighted by her growing readership,
especially after the watershed of "Journal of a Solitude" in 1973,
she was all too aware of her tenuous foothold in the literary world.
Despite being nominated for the National Book Award, she felt that
the big rewards eluded her.</TE>
<TE>   Friend Louise Bogan, longtime poetry critic for the New Yorker,
barely mentioned Sarton's old-fashioned lyrical verse in print. Poet
Karl Shapiro apparently spoke for many when he blurted out, in a 1961
review: "She is a bad poet.... Her poetry is lady-poetry at its
worst." At one point, Sarton wrote that reading her reviews was "like
swallowing glass after glass of poison."</TE>
<TE>   Although Sherman's Sarton may be a more benign figure than
Peters', these are still lovely, generous letters--the best of
Sarton, some may feel--and beautifully annotated. Some were written
to such writer-friends as Elizabeth Bowen, but many are in response
to the heaps of fan mail she received in her later years.</TE>
<TE>   The most enjoyable may be a tart letter to a local woman minister
who had failed repeatedly to deliver comforting sermons: "I do not
speak for myself alone," Sarton complained. "You must know that your
lack of compassion is notorious." On the Peters biography, Sherman
has restrained herself to a single footnote: " ... though [Sarton]
wanted and tried to like Peters, she remained ambivalent to the end."
Sherman's real answer to Peters is the loving enterprise of the
"Selected Letters."</TE>

<DH>THE HAPPY HOOKER: My Own Story, By Xaviera Hollander, Regan
Books:  288 pp., $13.95 paper CHILD NO MORE: A Memoir, By Xaviera
Hollander, Regan Books: 306 pp., $23.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY QUAN</AU>
<BD>Tracy Quan is the author of the novel "Diary of a
Manhattan Call Girl."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Xaviera Hollander's "The Happy Hooker" is a kitsch classic, a
memorable slice of New York life with a life of its own. Its title is
part of our vocabulary. Today, affluent prostitutes are playfully
referred to as "happy hookers." One eccentric wing of the
international prostitutes' rights movement has used the term as a
political insult since the 1980s.</LD>
<LD>   Many who use "happy hooker" as a backhanded epithet have never
even read Hollander's 1972 memoir, a sign of her cultural clout and a
good reason to republish. And for many, the 30th anniversary edition
of "The Happy Hooker" is a reprint of a book that opened our
adolescent eyes to a new career path.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, there is nothing new about the oldest profession. Nor
is there anything new about children earning a living at it. The
streets of Victorian London and 19th century New York were filled
with youthful hustlers who, by modern standards, were much too young
to be having sex for money. But prostitution seemed new to us,
middle-class pubescent youths of the 1970s and early-'80s whose
parents thought of hooking as something "other people" did.</LD>
<TE>   Hollander's book was not hidden from us, unless you regard a book
hastily stashed by one's parents beneath their bed as hidden. It was
read by an entire generation of future sex workers whose parents
expected us to become doctors, schoolteachers, engineers. We found it
on the bookshelves in the homes of families where we baby-sat or on
top of a half-open box on moving day. Its author was in the news and
on TV: New York's most notorious madam before the age of 30.</TE>
<TE>   Hollander was not the city's first celebrity madam and hooker.
Nineteenth century New York had its share of celebrated prostitutes,
but their media exposure was limited. When Polly Adler published her
1950s memoir, "A House Is Not a Home," she made it clear that she had
become a madam without ever turning a trick. Hollander was unabashed
about describing her evolution from (unpaid) one-night stand to
full-time call girl to front-page madam.</TE>
<TE>   I have met prostitutes, male and female, from Brooklyn, Idaho,
Australia and Canada who regard Hollander as their inspiration--a
"trailblazing freak," as one New York call girl puts it. A surprising
number of today's sex workers can cite "The Happy Hooker" as a
childhood influence, a book that made us think: "I can do that!"</TE>
<TE>   Revisiting "The Happy Hooker" as a sexually experienced adult is
quite jarring, especially for a veteran of the oldest profession.
Anecdotes that seemed like happy-hooker high jinks to a child now
read like tedious ordeals that a prostitute would want to avoid.</TE>
<TE>   Most adult readers will agree that the first page of this story,
which begins in a jail cell, doesn't sound very happy: Six terrified
call girls stand cowering in a corner; 20 "jail-toughened"
streetwalkers dominate the cell with bawdy catcalls and menacing
remarks. There is racial tension, physical fear and not enough bench
space. Hollander doesn't shrink from describing the smells of the
jail cell or the battered body of a sad prostitute she encounters at
Rikers Island.</TE>
<TE>   The first chapter is heart-rending and hardly titillating. When
Hollander gets out of jail, she returns to a doorman-guarded
apartment building--which might seem glamorous to some--but her
problems have just begun: Now she must move because she has been
busted.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its upbeat title, its erotic passages and enticing
glimpses into Manhattan's top-tier brothels, "The Happy Hooker" also
describes the most trying aspects of sex, whether for recreation,
true love or naked profit.</TE>
<TE>   Hollander is frank about the hard physical work of prostitution,
the discomforts of taking on multiple sex partners, the dangers of
encountering a too-kinky or boorish client and the indignities of
working as a beginner.</TE>
<TE>   She has sex in New York's Garment Center on a pile of dresses only
to discover--two hours and many clients later--that imprinted on her
back are the "impressions of zippers, hooks and eyes" and other
trimmings.</TE>
<TE>   On her way to becoming a successful call girl and madam, Hollander
pays her dues. Although she likes sex quite a bit more than the
average person--I think her appetite exceeds that of most
prostitutes--her job is illegal, dangerous and often exhausting.
There are terrifying entanglements with mobsters who expect to be
paid off with free sex, blackmailers who threaten to have her
deported and police officers who threaten to break women's legs. She
is often stressed out by a lover's sexual jealousy--one of the
perennial hazards of prostitution.</TE>
<TE>   Hollander never denied that her career of paid pleasure required
almost all of her emotional and much of her physical strength. When
you realize that she has finally retired from it, you are relieved.
Hollander paints an impressive portrait of herself as a survivor who
prospered in style, but this is no pretty picture of "the life."</TE>
<TE>   And yet, Hollander unwittingly "turned out" an entire generation
of young readers. Is this the result of a child's habit of skipping
ahead to the juicy parts and overlooking the details? Were we just
too young to understand what we were reading?</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps some people are born to be prostitutes, the way some
people are born to be athletes, writers or musicians, and no
cautionary tale can dissuade such a person from pursuing her natural
profession.</TE>
<TE>   Hollander's engaging new memoir, "Child No More," describes the
years before and after New York. These are the Freudian footnotes to
"The Happy Hooker." It's also a rather daring exploration of her late
parents' marriage. If her first book was darker and grittier than we
remember, it's because Hollander had rather dark, gritty beginnings.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Indonesia to a Jewish father and a German mother,
Hollander lived as a toddler in a Japanese prison camp. In the 1960s,
she accepted a free ticket to South Africa from its government, which
was actively recruiting white immigrants from the Netherlands. Her
breezy descriptions of South Africa under apartheid are
disconcerting, especially because Hollander has a lot to say about
anti-Semitism and ethnic persecution in Europe. This may explain why
Hollander's influence in the global prostitutes' movement has been
cultural rather than political.</TE>
<TE>   Hollander says she wrote this new memoir to dispel the myth that
she lives only for sex but she is most insightful when describing her
sexual behavior and origins. A few quirks can be traced to the
brutality of her prison camp childhood, especially her expertise as a
professional sadist. She admits that she inherited her father's Don
Juan personality but not his gentleness, the very thing that must
have made his philandering bearable to her mother.</TE>
<TE>   After Indonesia, Hollander's mother attempted to rebuild a happy
home in Amsterdam. Her husband's frequent sexual adventures created
an atmosphere of mistrust. Many fathers who engage in extramarital
sex manage to conceal it from their families but Hollander's father,
who was an attractive, stimulating, intelligent man, needed, for some
reason, to remind his wife (and perhaps his daughter?) that other
women wanted him too.</TE>
<TE>   This need for adulation, variety and intrigue is a quality shared
by many women who work as prostitutes. In fact, the female Don Juan
is doubly cursed: Although the pre-Viagra male was forced by nature
to curtail his philandering, a female Don Juan never has to give that
problem a second thought. The possibilities for conquest and
complication seem endless.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when it's fashionable to treat prostitution as sexual
labor rather than sexual expression--or to blame its existence on
paternal brutality--Hollander's approach to the question of paternal
influence is refreshing and nuanced.</TE>
<TE>   But Hollander is not just a female Don Juan. She has become an
outlaw mother figure who willfully celebrates a somewhat distorted
attachment to her own mother.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the publication of "The Happy Hooker," Hollander
married and tried to conceive a child. The result--an ectopic
pregnancy--almost killed her. Hollander was devastated.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1970s, a lover assured the childless Hollander that
what she had written was "every bit as valuable as the contribution
made by any mother." How true this turned out to be. Hollander, at
that moment, was morphing into our madam as we devoured her words.
She was childless no more, despite herself.</TE>

<DH>SACRED SECRETS: How Soviet Intelligence Operations Changed
American History, By Jerrold and  Leona Schecter, Brassey's: 380 pp.,
$26.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD RADOSH</AU>
<BD>Ronald Radosh is co-author with Joyce Milton of "The
Rosenberg File" and other books. He is an adjunct fellow at the
Hudson Institute in Washington, D.C.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is the claim of Jerrold and Leona Schecter, a husband-and-wife
journalist-historian team, that the Cold War was made up "sacred
secrets," that is, critical intelligence operations carried out by
major nations, in particular by the Soviet Union. These operations
were of such vital importance that they virtually demand a rewriting
of history, because much of what has been written fails to consider
the meaning and effect of these intelligence campaigns.</LD>
<LD>   "Sacred Secrets" is the latest in a reevaluation of the impact
that Soviet espionage had on our past, particularly during World War
II and the Cold War. The Schecters' work builds on that of previous
authors, especially on Harvey Klehr and John Earl Haynes'
interpretation of the Venona decrypts in their 1999 study, "Venona:
Decoding Soviet Espionage in America" and Allen Weinstein and
Alexander Vassiliev's revelations surrounding Soviet espionage in
"The Haunted Wood." In their telling, the Schecters provide new
information about how widespread the Soviet espionage network was. If
true, their reporting--especially the revelation that J. Robert
Oppenheimer was a Soviet asset--will change our central assumptions
about the Cold War.</LD>
<TE>   "Sacred Secrets" is a historically accurate account not only of
how that espionage effectively hurt America's national interest but
also of how it served the interests of the Soviet Union. While many
Americans have assumed that those accused of spying for the Soviets
were victims of false charges brought by McCarthyites, the truth is
that most of them were guilty of what they had been charged with. The
Venona files and Soviet archives established that Alger Hiss,
Laurence Duggan, Lauchlin Currie, William Remington and others
working in the U.S. government had been Soviet agents or sources of
information for the Soviets, as Whitaker Chambers and Elizabeth
Bentley had charged. The Schecters add to this by providing new
details about Soviet espionage success, and they put to an end any
claim that, if espionage had occurred, it was of little effect and no
harm.Two episodes are of immense importance and show the extent to
which the Schecters have mined valuable information from the KGB
archives. Since the release of Venona, we have known that Harry
Dexter White, assistant secretary of the Treasury and the formulator
of the so-called Morgenthau Plan for postwar Germany, was a major
Soviet asset. Critics have argued that it made no sense that White
could have been a Soviet agent because he was a major player in
creating the International Monetary Fund.</TE>
<TE>   The Schecters look at White and his efforts before the start of
World War II to encourage the U.S. to pursue a policy that would
counter Japanese expansion, which would keep Japanese troops under
pressure in China and therefore clear of Soviet borders near Siberia.
The goal was simple: to aggravate strained negotiations between the
U.S. and Japan. Formally, White was not a Soviet agent but what the
authors call a "star," with satellites working around him who gave
the data he supplied to the Soviets. Thus his memoranda to Secretary
of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr. was handed to the Soviets by
actual Soviet agents in Treasury, including Nathan Gregory
Silvermaster, Victor Perlo and others.</TE>
<TE>   Under the pretext of supporting peace and friendly relations with
the Soviets, White introduced "Soviet goals into Treasury Department
initiatives," for the purpose of gaining support for the "Soviet
policy of averting a Japanese invasion of Siberia." That policy led
not to peace but to a provocation that led the Japanese to attack the
United States at Pearl Harbor. Stalin's ultimate goal, the Schecters
emphasize, was to try to provoke war between Japan and the U.S., to
prevent Japan from striking the Soviet Union and hence to promote
Soviet interests in the Far East.</TE>
<TE>   In "Sacred Secrets," the authors also tell the story of how, in
1944, White developed the policy of giving the Soviets printing
plates that enabled them to print unlimited amounts of occupation
currency in the Eastern zone of Germany. On the face of it, the
providing of plates could be justified as part of the reparation for
Soviet suffering at Germany's hand during the war. But the Schecters
make it clear that Gen. George C. Marshall was opposed to this plan
because it would interfere with the Allied currency. But White moved
ahead after he received instructions to do so from the NKVD center in
Moscow, and the marks flooded the Russian zone and created a black
market and inflation throughout Germany.</TE>
<TE>   "White's efforts to provide unlimited occupation currency for the
Red Army was another thread in the tapestry of service he wove on
behalf of the Soviet Union," the Schecters write, noting that White
also gave Stalin "direct access to a broad range of information and
high-level thinking." It was similar to the role that Hiss played at
Yalta, meeting each day with the Soviet military intelligence agent
and giving him American positions on unresolved issues in advance of
negotiations, before they were to be discussed by Stalin, Churchill
and FDR, thereby helping Stalin impose his iron curtain on Eastern
Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The second and perhaps most important revelation in "Sacred
Secrets" concerns Oppenheimer, the fabled chief of the Manhattan
Project. The revocation of Oppenheimer's security clearance in 1953
by the Eisenhower administration because of the scientist's past
communist affiliations and the lies he told to Army security in the
early 1940s has been viewed as a major capitulation to the
McCarthyites. Oppenheimer's defenders have argued that his opposition
to development of an H-bomb led them to use his past affiliations
against him and thus remove his voice from the ears of policymakers
and members of the Atomic Energy Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The authors quote Oppenheimer in a 1948 interview in which he
referred to his brief flirtation with communism as stemming from a
humanitarian concern. "Most of what I believed then," he said, "now
seems complete nonsense, but it was an essential part of becoming a
whole man." By the war's end, Oppenheimer was seemingly an
anti-communist, and it appeared that his access to classified
material was being taken from him without consideration of his
service to the nation. What "Sacred Secrets" reveals is virtually a
bombshell and will become highly contested and debated.</TE>
<TE>   It has been long known that Oppenheimer's wife and his brother
Frank were both Communist Party members and that, like other
intellectuals of his time, Oppenheimer was sympathetic to the
Communist movement. Yet his service to America was deemed essential
if an A-bomb was to be built, and it was with knowledge about his
past that he was allowed to head the top secret atomic lab at Los
Alamos.</TE>
<TE>   But the Schecters offer the proof that Oppenheimer himself was a
Communist Party member well into 1942, after which time he was
ordered by the NKVD to drop his membership and go undercover. Soviet
documents prove that Oppenheimer functioned as a major Soviet asset,
agreeing to hire communist scientists who would ferret out secrets
for the Soviets and meeting with the NKVD's resident in San
Francisco, Gregory Kheifitz, to whom he reported secret information.
As the writers reveal, "from the first meeting between Kheifitz and
Oppenheimer in December 1941, through the early months of 1942 while
the Manhattan Project was being organized and Oppenheimer was
preparing to move to Los Alamos, the American Communist Party
underground and Soviet intelligence were enlisting Oppenheimer's
cooperation to obtain atomic secrets."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the authors reproduce in their appendix the actual
document from Soviet archives, dated Oct. 2, 1944, received and
signed by NKVD head Lavrenti Beria, referring to Oppenheimer as a
"member of the apparatus of Comrade Browder" who, at the request of
Kheifitz, "provided cooperation in access to research for several of
our tested sources including a relative of Comrade Browder." Then,
working through Maj. Vasili Zarubin of State Security and his wife,
also an NKVD officer, they befriended Oppenheimer's wife and, through
her, convinced Oppenheimer to hire "antifascists of German origin,"
which paved the way for the hiring of Klaus Fuchs by the Manhattan
Project.</TE>
<TE>   Oppenheimer also placed young communist scientists in the other
three major government research labs, and they in turn gave Soviet
couriers secret documents pertaining to the development of atomic
weapons from uranium. Much of the atomic espionage--details of which
are not to be found in Venona--took place through Soviet residents
and from couriers working through a Soviet safe house for illegals,
operated out of Zuck's Drugstore in Santa Fe. Run by Kitty Harris, a
courier for atomic secrets, Zuck's was purchased by the NKVD as a
support center to arrange Leon Trotsky's assassination in 1940.</TE>
<TE>   The authors also challenge those who have asserted that President
Harry Truman did not know about Venona and suggest that, had their
revelations been made known, the witch hunts of the 1950s might never
have taken place. They reveal that the FBI struggled with whether to
let Venona be used as the basis for prosecutions and decided that to
do so would be disadvantageous both legally and logistically. They
challenge former U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's assertion that
no one past the rank of Gen.Omar Bradley knew about Venona, and they
cite interviews with Oliver Kirby, deputy director of the Russian
code-breaking program, establishing that Truman had been informed of
Venona by Secretary of Defense James Forrestal. Truman, they write,
distrusted the Venona findings and worried that their contents would
"open up this whole Red Panic again."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Truman believed that communist infiltration of the
government could not have been widespread. Indeed, when told that
Venona files had identified White and Hiss as agents, Truman worried
that the news was "likely to take us down." By not making Venona
public, Truman delayed the Red panic, the Schecters write, and
"allowed his political enemies to take control of the issue and
magnify it for their own ends." Truman's fear was that Venona was the
equivalent of a time bomb "that could explode and destroy the party
of the New Deal in the 1952 election."</TE>
<TE>   The remainder of "Sacred Secrets" concerns events not directly
related to the book's thesis. Some material is interesting but remain
peripheral, such as how the authors obtained and published
Khrushchev's diaries and the role of the mysterious Soviet journalist
and agent Victor Louis. The authors unnecessarily retell the already
well-known stories of the Hiss case and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg
case, and they end their book with boilerplate about the war against
terrorism and the need for intelligence in our new struggle. All of
which is not relevant to the point of their book and might best have
been omitted. Despite these irrelevancies, the main story they tell
is essential for our understanding of how Soviet espionage affected
our country.</TE>

<LD>PAGAN TIME</LD>
<LD>   An American Childhood</LD>
<LD>   By Micah Perks</LD>
<TE>   Counterpoint: 162 pp., $23</TE>
<TE>   Those fabulous '60s. The drugs. The beatings. The riots. Remember?
Well, that's kind of what Micah Perks' memoir of growing up in a
hippie commune in Vermont is like.</TE>
<TE>   Perks' parents ran a school for disturbed adolescents but spent
most of their time, according to the author, acting like disturbed
adolescents. Thankfully, there's almost no philosophizing in the
book, about going back to the land or about wilderness or our own
wild natures. That would be redundant.</TE>
<TE>   The stories Perks remembers, from age 5 to the present, defy what
we call parenthood, society and sometimes even gravity. To her
parents' credit, whatever their philosophy or religion, their ideas
are immediately transformed into action: erecting a tepee village,
setting sail on Lake Champlain for days of fishing and drinking
(including the disturbed adolescents), killing and eating only wild
food: grouse, bear, venison; sex in the open, and with whomever you
like, open meetings, open rooms, open psyches.</TE>
<TE>   All of that sounds like great fun, but through Perks' young eyes,
it is a confusing swirl of activity. Most of all, it is precarious.
Any child can sense it, and longs to be the same as everyone else.
Perks' father is the ringleader, a British charismatic who thinks he
is a sea captain. That is his least harmful delusion. Also, he can't
stop having sex outside of marriage.</TE>
<TE>   And for all the openness, it is finally sex that brings down the
house. It's her parents' open marriage that pulls the commune and the
family apart.</TE>
<TE>   But it was not all in vain, all that risk and defiance. One feels
the wheels of evolution groaning. Perks' mother seems a seriously
wise person, and Perks herself, though she has chosen not, outwardly,
to live as her parents did, has a beautiful lack of judgment.</TE>
<TE>   There is a little too much mythologizing about that time in her
life, especially about her father; but more off-putting to the reader
is Perks' neediness. She begins the book on an almost whiny note: I
need you to see this, I need you to understand, she repeats again and
again. Why? Why me? Some tales are told for the teller, more than for
the audience, and "Pagan Time" is one of them.</TE>

<TE>   THE ARTIFICIAL SILK GIRL</TE>
<TE>   By Irmgard Keun</TE>
<TE>   Translated from the German by Kathie von Ankum</TE>
<TE>   Other Press: 192 pp., $17 paper</TE>
<TE>   "The Artificial Silk Girl," written in 1932 by Irmgard Keun, then
23, was blacklisted a year later by the Nazis for its anti-German
portrayals of businessmen and bureaucrats. In the 1950s, it was
resurrected as a feminist manifesto; the diary of a working girl in
Depression-era Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   Damned by the Nazis, hailed by the feminists. You'd think there's
hardly anything left to say about the poor novel, except that it is a
truly charming window into a young woman's life in the early 1930s.</TE>
<TE>   Doris, the main character, decides to write a book about herself.
"Not a diary, that's ridiculous for a trendy girl like me." No,
Doris' life can only be fully captured in a movie, and so Doris tries
to see her world as if through the lens of a camera. She tries to be
as precise and descriptive as a camera would be.</TE>
<TE>   Doris is a secretary in an attorney's office when the book opens.
Every time she's caught for missing a comma or some other infraction,
she gives him a "sensuous look," which she knows can only go on until
he loses control. Sex for Doris is a defiant act against the
pettiness of bureaucrats, and this gives the book a cabaret feel:
wild sex in the middle of perverse cruelty.</TE>
<TE>   "Politics poisons human relationships. I spit on it," she writes
when an industrialist drops her because she tells him she's Jewish
(even though she isn't). Her world, seen from cafes and restaurants
more than the office, is full of "jerks," "fatsoes," "turtles" and
other epithets not reserved for the men she sleeps with.</TE>
<TE>   It is poignant that Doris thinks she is savvier than she is, but
she makes up for it with raw energy. Even such phrases as "dog tired"
reveal her boundless joie de vivre.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the novel, Doris moves to Berlin to pursue an acting
career. "Berlin descended on me like a comforter with a flaming
floral design," she purrs.</TE>
<TE>   She mocks the young women who rely on the professed connections of
men to get them acting work, but she must use this vehicle herself.
In the end, you know what brings down a woman like this: LOVE. "Love
for love's sake is exhausting," she writes. Love is the only thing
that gets between Doris and her dreams. Working makes her dog-tired.
Love exhausts her.</TE>

<BD>Orville Schell is the author of, most recently,
"Virtual Tibet: The Search for Shangri-La: From Hollywood to the
Himalayas" and is dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at UC
Berkeley.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rarely has there been a remote land more freighted with meaning for
the West than Tibet. Not only has it long been redolent of the
utopian mythology of Shangri-La but since 1949 and the communist
victory on the Chinese mainland, it has also become steeped in a
different and more bitter mythos, one that has grown out of the
reality of occupation; the flight of its leader, the Dalai Lama, to
India; political repression; and the subsequent struggle of a valiant
traditional people to maintain its cultural identity and regain some
measure of autonomy, not to say independence.</LD>
<LD>   This sad tale of conquest, misunderstanding, prevarication and
loss has involved the United States, Britain, India and China as they
tried to reconcile lofty principles about human rights,
self-determination, religious freedom and independence with more
practical imperatives of national self-interest. But like a dramatic
narrative interrupted by lost parts of the story, Tibet's tragic
progress into the modern world has until recently been missing whole
chapters. Outsiders knew little about the policy debates that went on
among China's leaders. And, we knew little more than the murky
outlines of our own relationship with the Dalai Lama's government in
exile and its covert operations to thwart China's "peaceful
liberation" of Tibet.</LD>
<TE>   This gap in our knowledge meant that, whatever we may have thought
about Beijing's claim that Tibet was an inalienable part of "the
sacred Chinese motherland," it was difficult to appraise Tibetan
resistance. Was it an independent mouse that roared by standing up
alone against a colonial superpower? Or was it a creature of the Cold
War that in some ways may have justified China's allegations that it
was fomented by a conspiracy of foreign imperialists and domestic
reactionaries, justifying Beijing's savage intervention and
repressive rule?</TE>
<TE>   This lacuna has begun to be filled in the last few years by a host
of books that have helped draw back the curtain on what turns out to
have been an elaborate ballet of big power choreography.</TE>
<TE>   As Mao Tse-tung came to power in China in 1949, he dispatched
Marshal Liu Bocheng and his longtime political commissar, Deng
Xiaoping, to China's Southwest Military Region "to liberate our
compatriots in Tibet ... and bring that mountainous land of lamas
back into the Chinese family," a land which even Chiang Kai-shek
viewed as part of a multiethnic China. But, having enjoyed almost
complete independence from Chinese control since 1911 and having been
accustomed to viewing itself as politically independent, culturally
different, linguistically and ethnically distinct and geographically
separate from China, the Tibetan government under the leadership of
the teenage 14th Dalai Lama resisted, belatedly trying to break out
of its traditional isolation to win international support for de
facto, if not de jure, independence.</TE>
<TE>   Tsering Shakya's "The Dragon in the Land of Snows: The History of
Modern Tibet Since 1947" and John Kenneth Knaus' "Orphans of the Cold
War: America and the Tibetan Struggle for Survival" are superbly
well-researched and written books that show that Lhasa's early
resistance found virtually no outside supporters. A deep-seated
wariness about antagonizing a rigid and intractable China had already
begun to establish itself in the post-World War II world. Britain,
which had given the Raj its independence in 1947 and was eager to
recognize China, wanted no part of a complicated Tibetan imbroglio.
("Politically, I have no doubt at all that what we want to do is to
create a situation which does not oblige us in practice to do
anything about the Communist invasion of Tibet," British U.N.
representative Sir Gladwyn Jebb wrote in 1950.)</TE>
<TE>   India, which under Jawaharlal Nehru was seeking to befriend the
new "people's republic" as an ally in its "nonaligned world" under
the doctrine of Panch Sheel, or the Five Principles of Peaceful
Co-Existence, also had no stomach for antagonizing revolutionary
China. (Nehru suggested Mao might simply be occupying Tibet because
of some errant information about "Anglo-American intrigues.") And the
United States, despite an effusion of Cold War rhetoric about
democracy and opposition to "communist aggression" ("Every feasible
effort should be made to hinder the Commie occupation," trumpeted the
State Department) was finally ambivalent about crossing India and
overcommitting itself to a struggle in a remote and hostile
territory. As the American ambassador to New Delhi, Loy Henderson,
justly argued, "It would be unfair for the U.S. to take any action
that might encourage them [the Tibetans] to resist because of a
mistaken idea of help from the U.S."</TE>
<TE>   Ambivalence became a leitmotif in U.S. policy toward Tibet. Should
the United States encourage the Dalai Lama to leave Tibet by offering
asylum and monetary support, should it recognize Tibetan independence
and take up the cause at the United Nations or should it openly
provide military assistance to the Tibetan resistance? These were
only a few of the questions that Washington wrestled with as the
kaleidoscope of Cold War politics kept changing, beginning with Mao's
victory in China in 1949 and ending with Richard Nixon's
rapprochement with Beijing in 1972. What resulted was a program of
covert support in the 1950s and '60s for the Tibetan resistance that
expressed our good intentions but accomplished little.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Laird, in his somewhat awkwardly told tale of escape across
Tibet from Xinjiang by two alleged CIA operatives in 1950, "Into
Tibet: The CIA's First Atomic Spy and His Secret Expedition to
Lhasa," explores the theme that U.S. aid was "[a]lways too little,
too late, and was always driven primarily by American intelligence
needs" rather than by the needs of Tibetans. As the Dalai Lama's
older brother Gyalo Thondup told Laird, U.S. aid "was just enough to
make the Chinese mad," but "there was never any serious intent to
evict the Chinese from Tibet." Despite its good intentions, U.S.
assistance was, Laird claims, "ultimately the kiss of death for
Tibet."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps. This was certainly a sentiment shared by desperate
Tibetans. Indeed, despite all the American efforts, only 49
CIA-trained Tibetans were ever airdropped back into their homeland,
and only 12 survived. And even during the salad days of CIA
involvement between 1957 and 1961, a total of no more than 250 tons
of materiel was airlifted to Tibetan guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   In retrospect, one is left to wonder what the United States
expected to accomplish besides some harassment of China. The history
of this American harassment is the subject of Kenneth Conboy and
James Morrison's engaging and informative new book, "The CIA's Secret
War in Tibet." The authors chronicle the early efforts of the Dalai
Lama's two brothers, Gyalo Thondup and Thubten Norbu, to serve as
Tibetan emissaries to the outside world as the People's Liberation
Army advanced. While Thubten Norbu worked with officials in the
United States, Gyalo Thondup played an increasingly important role in
India, beginning when the Dalai Lama first fled to the Indian border
in 1950, pondered the idea of permanent exile and then finally
decided to return to Lhasa with the hope that China's promise of
"peaceful liberation" might yet work out. In the years that followed,
Gyalo Thondup became a tireless whirlwind of activity, secretly
serving as a conduit of information to his brother, recruiting spies
and paramilitary forces for the CIA and, finally, even negotiating
with the Chinese.</TE>
<TE>   As the Tibetan resistance in exile became more and more involved
with the CIA, it was Gyalo Thondup who provided cover for his
brother, affording the Dalai Lama a certain distance from the
guerrilla resistance movement and giving him "plausible deniability."
This enabled him to honor nominally, at least, agreements of
cooperation with Beijing and give them a chance, without overtly
identifying with the resistance.</TE>
<TE>   The spate of recent works on Tibet during the '50s and '60s
reveals a scope of CIA involvement that was previously known in only
a cursory way. Support grew, beginning with a group of exiled Khampa
tribesmen, who were surreptitiously flown to Saipan for military
training by the CIA in 1951 before being parachuted back into Tibet
to link up with resistance forces. Ultimately, the CIA found itself
running a military base for six years, training Tibetan commandos at
Camp Hale in the mountains of Colorado before airlifting them back to
the Himalayas, via a U.S. airbase in Thailand.</TE>
<TE>   Adopting a policy of "strategic silence," the United States said
little about CIA involvement with the Tibetan struggle. But by the
early '60s, it was training and supplying more than 1,000 exiles from
the Kham and Amdo regions of Tibet for cross-border raids from the
remote Nepali Kingdom of Mustang. Then, after China's triumphant 1962
attack on India over disputed Himalayan territory--when Nehru's
vaunted policy of "Hindi-Chini Bhai Bhai" ("Indians and Chinese are
brothers!") suddenly proved embarrassingly naive--a whole new joint
Indian-CIA military training camp for Tibetan exiles hit its stride
in an old Gurkha training camp in Chakrata, under the control of
India's intelligence chief, Bhola Nath Mullik.</TE>
<TE>   It is true that this was all penny-ante stuff in the grand scheme
of the Cold War. However, besides a full-scale invasion of China, it
is hard to imagine an alternative to this "pin-prick war." And, short
of complete and abject Tibetan surrender, it is unlikely that China
would have been any less repressive. Indeed, one of the themes that
emerges from these books is the way in which fear of antagonizing a
militant and threatening China often deterred, and even paralyzed,
the world's most powerful countries. (Nehru's early posture of
accommodation toward Beijing certainly comes to mind.)</TE>
<TE>   What China's leaders seem to have learned early on is that a
refusal to compromise and a willingness to push things to the brink
often triumphs over adversaries wary of full-blown conflict.
Beijing's message in Tibet was "We will do it our way--the devil take
the hindmost."</TE>
<TE>   While Beijing has often succeeded by threatening to raise the
stakes so high that no one wants to remain in the game, what its
leaders have tended to miss are those far less costly opportunities
for resolution in compromise. Indeed, it is hard to imagine why the
"Tibetan problem" ever needed to spiral into such an "antagonistic
contradiction," to put it in Maoist parlance. After all, from
Beijing's perspective, what would have been lost by allowing Tibet
greater autonomy and granting the Dalai Lama a substantial and
dignified place of leadership in Lhasa?</TE>
<TE>   But in Tibet as elsewhere, China allowed itself to become prisoner
of a paranoia born of its historical sense of humiliation and
distrust. And this paranoia has time and time again  prevented
nonantagonistic problem solving. As Shakya sagely notes, what has
happened in Tibet has sadly had too little to do with Tibet itself
and too much to do with China's own political pathology. "The
modalities of Chinese rule over Tibet," he writes, "are not therefore
governed so much by the internal situation in Tibet as by the more
complex issues of ideology and power which confront the leadership of
the Communist Party."</TE>
<TE>   There are two real insights that readers will take away from these
books:</TE>
<TE>   First, the Dalai Lama is an eminently reasonable and moderate man
whom China's leaders ignore to their country's and Tibet's great
detriment. (Indeed, if one must have an adversary, it is hard to
imagine someone more accommodating and thoughtful.)</TE>
<TE>   Second, that the whole occupation of Tibet and the CIA's secret
involvement with Tibetan resistance turned out to be an agonizing
waste of energy and blood.</TE>
<TE>   It is true that the American, British and Indian leaders may have
first vacillated and then done too little, too late to help the Dalai
Lama's cause. However, the real blame must be laid before China's
leaders. Their blind and belligerent insistence that Tibet return to
"the Chinese Motherland" on their terms set Tibet and China on a
fatefully antagonistic course. Far too many are still paying for this
stubborn blindness.</TE>
<TE>   But ironically, while many Tibetans have paid a high price for
Mao's vision of conflict resolution, the Chinese government has paid,
and is still paying, an even higher one. For at the very time that
its leaders yearn to find respect and legitimacy around the world,
they are compelled to live with the millstone of Tibet hanging around
their necks. And no amount of political propaganda, revelations about
foreign interference or revisionist history can lift that ignominious
burden. The only cure for this legacy of myopia and violent
repression is a reappraisal of history and a reversal of policy.</TE>
<TE>   The paradox is that even though no state has ever diplomatically
recognized Tibet as independent, and even though the Dalai Lama and
his followers are in exile and dispossessed of their country, he is
still internationally recognized as a leader of great moderation and
principle, the perfect person to soothe the tensions that have built
up within Tibet. What is so self-defeating and frustrating about
Beijing's policies is that Communist Party leaders cannot see what an
incomparable asset they have to help transform the mythology of this
benighted land from that of an oppressed Shangri-La to one of true
"peaceful liberation."</TE>

<HD>Down But Not Out</HD>
<DH>TUMBLING AFTER: Pedaling Like Crazy After Life Goes
Downhill: A Memoir, By Susan Parker Crown: 290 pp., $24</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE SCHOEFER</AU>
<BD>Christine Schoefer is a writer whose work has appeared
in the Nation, Salon and other publications.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you knew that Susan Parker's "Tumbling After: Pedaling Like Crazy
After Life Goes Downhill: A Memoir" was the story of how her life
changed after a freak bicycling accident left her husband paralyzed
below his shoulders, you might assume that it is a primer on
disability or a care-giving manual.</LD>
<LD>   "Tumbling After" does answer many questions you don't dare ask
about life with a severely disabled person. But Parker accomplishes
much more than that: It's a wake-up call that catapults the reader
into possibility. Anyone's life could be turned upside-down at any
moment. Together, these 71 fast-reading chapters, some of which have
appeared as columns in the San Francisco Chronicle, add up to a
riveting narrative of Parker's life transformation.</LD>
<LD>   This memoir is a heart-wrenching confirmation of the aphorism
"When God closes a door, somewhere he opens a window." When Parker
comes home from the hospital with her newly disabled husband, that
window seems to open to an endless, bleak tunnel. Their former life,
which had revolved around climbing, biking and skiing, vanishes. So
do most of her friends. Therapists and counselors offer ridiculously
inadequate advice. Just when Parker is on the brink of exhaustion
from the 24/7 requirements of catheterizing, washing, feeding and
medicating her husband, the bleakness turns light and lively like a
dawning day.</LD>
<TE>   The strangers who come to her aid are as colorful as they are
surprising. They intercept Parker's downward spin into despair and
become more than friends; they become her new family. First, her
neighbor Gerstine Scott appears at her doorstep one day "wearing a
sequined pink beret and gold rings on each of her plump, large
fingers." Though she hardly knows Parker or her husband, Scott calls
him "sweet baby" as she massages his limp arms with petroleum jelly.</TE>
<TE>   Before long, "Mrs. Scott" is Parker's closest friend, mother
figure, advisor, caretaker, entertainer and social advisor. Then
Jerry, "[s]lightly overweight, squeezed into a peach-colored
polyester-blend suit" applies for a live-in attendant job which
Parker has had trouble filling. The triumvirate of caretakers is
complete when Harka arrives to help. Fresh from a mountain hamlet in
Nepal, he joins the unconventional household in its modest Oakland
neighborhood. Given Parker's flair for description, it is unlikely
that a reader could forget this unusual trio.</TE>
<TE>   Parker chronicles what happens when people from very different
backgrounds are thrown together and, bound to each other by their
commitment to caring for Ralph, do not walk away, despite annoying
cultural differences, serious misunderstandings and grating
idiosyncrasies. She shows how many of the expectations and
conventions cultivated in her "former" life fall away. Scott and
Jerry gradually introduce Parker and her white world to the African
American community outside her front door.</TE>
<TE>   Parker has an uncanny ability to reveal sweetness and humor in
even the most heart-wrenching episodes. Despite the gravity of the
subject matter, the effervescent writing makes this a joyful and
uplifting book. That is not to say that "Tumbling After" is just a
feel-good read. On the contrary, Parker does not shy away from tricky
terrain, and her breathtaking candor will surprise and delight
readers. Her vibrant descriptions of events and interactions among
her African American friends brim with love and appreciation, but the
candor of household chatter might not pass muster with the PC patrol.</TE>
<TE>   Parker offers scathing indictments of the health-care system and
its counseling services. She explodes the dichotomous stereotypes
that either idealize caregivers as saints or demonize them as
abusers, offering instead a portrait of people who are able to take
astonishing things in stride.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the fact that Jerry eventually becomes her lover
neither diminishes Parker's devotion to her husband nor Jerry's
dedicated, expert care-taking of Ralph.</TE>
<TE>   Through Parker's eyes, we learn about Ralph's bouts of
hopelessness, his dread of being hospitalized, his growing activism
in Berkeley's vocal disabled community. He finds refuge in
cyberspace, where, by driving the mouse with his chin, he moves as
freely and expertly as the other travelers. In the end, though, this
is Parker's story. And she demonstrates that ultimately, the ability
to open rather than close her heart is the true survival skill.</TE>

<AU>LARRY B. STAMMER</AU>
<BD>Larry B. Stammer is a Times staff writer who covers

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sipping a Cafe Americano at a sidewalk cafe on Rome's Piazza della
Rotonda is to be transfixed by an architectural time machine. It
looms in one's eyes, then enters the mind to transport the beholder
to another time. It is, of course, the Pantheon. Built by the emperor
Hadrian between AD 118 and 128, it is the best preserved of Roman
antiquities.</LD>
<LD>   One imagines ancient Romans entering the temple, with its imposing
concrete dome, to contemplate an ordered universe. As the sun courses
through the sky, light streams through a circular opening, or ocula,
at the dome's apex and slowly sweeps across the interior floor. In
inclement weather, rain pours through the opening. Nearly 500 years
later, Pope Boniface IV would consecrate the once pagan edifice as a
church: Now it would be Christians who came to worship. On the Feast
of the Ascension, parishioners hoist a statue of Christ through the
dome's aperture to the heavens.</LD>
<LD>   The experience of seeing the Pantheon is so much richer if one
first consults Judith Dupre's sumptuous new coffee-table book,
"Churches," which is marvelous for its concise and authoritative
commentaries as well as for its rich color photography.</LD>
<TE>   Imaginative in design and conception, "Churches" is one book that
can be judged by its cover. The book cover, a dramatic photograph of
Donatello's Annunciation, is cut down the center so that one flap
opens to the left, and the other to the right, as if to beckon the
reader through the great doors of a cathedral. Within its pages are
to be found pictures of some of the world's greatest churches, among
them the Basilica of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem, Chartres
Cathedral in France, St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow and St. Paul's
Cathedral in London.</TE>
<TE>   American churches are also well represented, including those that
are known and those not so well known. They include the First Baptist
Church in America in Providence, R.I.; the Mormon Temple in Salt Lake
City, Utah; the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in
Washington, D.C.; Shiloh Temple in Durham, Maine; and the Crystal
Cathedral in Garden Grove, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   As rich as the images of these magnificent edifices, Dupre's text
goes beyond the required historical, architectural and engineering
details to proffer insights into the transcendent. The entry of the
Pantheon, for example, includes a full-page color photograph of the
dramatic interior, as well as an etching of the Pantheon as it
appeared in the mid-1700s with the outrageous intrusion of twin bell
towers rudely imposed on either side of the roof of the ancient gem's
portico. Thankfully, the bell towers were dismantled in 1883.</TE>
<TE>   If the book has any lapses, it sometimes overlooks artistic
failings. Dupre's discussion of the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis
in St. Louis, for example, offers informative commentary on the
church's "extraordinary mosaics." Indeed, many of the mosaics are
wonderful. Others, however, have a decidedly cartoon character that,
in this book, go unmentioned. But, of course, beauty and banality are
not matters of fact but perception.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the perceptions that Dupre provides in "Churches" can be
depended upon as solid, even insightful. A cultural historian with a
background in art, architecture, education and English literature,
Dupre offers in "Churches" a confluence of these schools.</TE>
<TE>   "Churches" is a coffee-table book certain to be admired by guests.
But its real value lies not as a prop but as a beautiful and
authoritative reference meant to be read and appreciated over and
over.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: How do you compare the private horror of sexual abuse with
the very public horror of the Holocaust?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: For me, to compare the two would come from a desire to
place horrors on a kind of grid. It would be an act of cowardice.
This kind of measuring dulls compassion, or at least it would in me.
And writing--in fact all art--can and perhaps must be a kind of act
of compassion.</LD>
<LD>   Q: Do you feel the form of the novel is inadequate to describe the
cruelty (and maybe also the beauty) of the world?</LD>
<TE>   A: Writers work the way that pleases them. You want this
congruence between what you put on the page and what exists in your
head. And when you've "nailed it," then you feel intense pleasure. I
think pleasure drives these things more than statements about the
viability or death of certain forms. I did not set out to write a
novel that was unusual in form or that engaged in these kinds of
questions.</TE>
<TE>   I wrote "The Memory Room" so that the ink on the page, when read,
was as close as I could get it to how I heard the words in my own
head. I read very few novels and I finish even fewer. I mostly read
poems. In most novels I've tried reading there is just way too much
information compared to the sensation of movement.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You've said that you are a very "new" reader, by which I think
you mean reading outside of academia. How has becoming a reader
changed your writing?</TE>
<TE>   A: I only began reading fiction and poetry in my mid-40s, about
halfway through "The Memory Room." Now I read all the time. And the
new work will form a kind of dialogue with what I read, as it must be
for all writers. I am trying to learn, though late in the game, what
the domain of the page is. What can happen on the page that cannot
happen anywhere else.</TE>

<LD>The Lakers aren't the only ones with a three-peat. Eminem has scored
his third blockbuster in a row with "The Eminem Show," which is at
the forefront of the midyear list of the most commanding albums so
far in 2002.</LD>
<LD>   Not only has "The Eminem Show" sold more than 3 million copies in
a month, but it also confirms the Detroit rapper's place among the
most compelling artists of the modern pop era. He is on such a roll,
in fact, that the chief debate over "The Eminem Show" is how it
measures against "The Marshall Mathers LP," the 2000 collection that
was nominated for a Grammy for album of the year.</LD>
<LD>   "The Marshall Mathers LP" and "The Eminem Show" are both superior
works filled with bratty insistence, witty wordplay, ugly fury and
painful self-examination. Ranking them is as difficult as proclaiming
a victor in the Shaq-era Lakers against the Magic-era Lakers
speculation, or putting Nirvana's "Nevermind" up against the band's
"In Utero."</LD>
<TE>   In the new collection, Eminem reintroduces us to several of the
characters, including his mother and his daughter, from "Mathers" and
its predecessor, "The Slim Shady LP," but the stories have
progressed. In some ways, this is the final installment in a trilogy.
Eminem remains offensive at times and silly at others, but that's
part of his rebellious rap persona. More important, he is more
personal and revealing.</TE>
<TE>   For all the negativity surrounding Eminem's music and image, there
is an underlying message of inspiration--the idea that someone can
rise above his circumstances. It makes perfect sense that one of the
album's most powerful moments is built around a sample of a vintage
rock 'n' roll anthem: Aerosmith's "Dream On."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Here, alphabetically, are the other standout albums from what was
a particularly productive six months in pop music--so good, in fact,
that the traditional midyear top 10 list has been expanded to a top
12. The White Stripes' "White Blood Cells," which has been finally
getting radio airplay this year, would make it an even stronger list,
but the 2001 collection was on my year-end top 10 list in December.
The 12 albums reflect a common independence and craft.</TE>
<TE>   ... And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead's "Source Tags &amp;
Codes" (Interscope). Even more than At the Drive-In, the influential,
defunct group from the same high-energy Texas club scene, this
quintet mixes arty, punk and timeless rock sensibilities in
compelling, sometimes apocalyptic songs that convey both a symphonic
grace and a pure visceral charge.</TE>
<TE>   Badly Drawn Boy's "About a Boy" (ARTISTdirect/XL). The sweet and
sensitive folk-pop tunes were written for the film based on Nick
Hornby's novel about commitment and love, but they stand nicely on
their own. These tunes are compact but never slight, sentimental but
never mushy. Think of the Englishman as Elliott Smith with a bit more
energy and optimism.</TE>
<TE>   Kasey Chambers' "Barricades &amp; Brickwalls" (Warner Bros.). While
mainstream Nashville remains in an alarming creative slump, this
voice from Australia offers a road map on how to regain a soulful
direction. In "Not Pretty Enough," she even chides radio stations for
their one-dimensional playlists.</TE>
<TE>   Desaparecidos' "Read Music/Speak Spanish" (Saddle Creek). Every
rock generation needs a voice against the soul-destroying nature of
social conformity, and this generation has at least two candidates in
Grandaddy's Jason Lytle and Desaparecidos' Conor Oberst. Musically,
Lytle takes a much more withdrawn, even Zen-like look at it all,
while Oberst lashes out with punk-like sensibilities that feel fresh
and smart.</TE>
<TE>   DJ Shadow's "The Private Press" (MCA). Like Moby, DJ Shadow is an
electronica artist who rises above the anonymous tendencies of the
genre to make music that has a strong, riveting human component.
Rather than Moby's increasing embrace of traditional pop-rock
elements, Shadow (Josh Davis) sticks to turntables and other tools of
the electronica trade. Yet he is as obsessed with ideas as with
sounds, and he creates a world as distinctive and haunting as anyone
working in pop today.</TE>
<TE>   The Hives' "Veni Vidi Vicious" (Sire/Burning Heart/Epitaph). This
sensational quintet from Sweden, with its liberating mix of
garage-rock fury and disarming pop charm, would be welcome in any
era, but the Hives are especially enchanting now because the
mainstream rock scene is so humorless. Think early Rolling Stones.
Think Mitch Ryder &amp; the Detroit Wheels. Think the Ramones. Now, get
the album.</TE>
<TE>   Norah Jones' "Come Away With Me" (Blue Note). Although the tone is
much softer and the vocals more restrained, there is a seductive,
soulful honesty about this young Texan's debut that is reminiscent of
Shelby Lynne's striking "I Am Shelby Lynne" album. Whether
interpreting a country classic (Hank Williams' "Cold, Cold Heart") or
introducing songs by her bandmates, she is an alluring and convincing
new pop voice.</TE>
<TE>   Moby's "18" (V2). The New Yorker repeats the winning formula of
his last album, "Play," in so many places that it's tempting to think
of the album as "Play Some More." But even those moments--where he
weaves new soundscapes to fit haunting vocal samples--are arresting.
He moves forward elsewhere in notable ways, such as pairing with
other artists (including Sinead O'Connor) and creating original
songs--notably "Extreme Ways" and "We Are All Made of Stars"--that
are instantly appealing.</TE>
<TE>   N.E.R.D.'s "In Search of . . . " (Virgin). As the
songwriting-production team known as the Neptunes, Pharrell Williams
and Chad Hugo have helped shape hits for Britney Spears, Mystikal and
'N Sync, but here, with their cohort Shay, they step away from their
day jobs to forge an aggressive brand of hip-hop and rock that looks
beyond bad-boy fantasies to reflect on corruption and greed in
society. The best tracks radiate with rich musical influences that
stretch from the Beatles and Sly Stone to Guns 'N Roses and OutKast.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Waits' "Blood Money" (Anti). Waits sometimes seemed gimmicky
early in his career, when he appeared as interested in cultivating an
offbeat persona as in searching for truths as a songwriter. But he
has shown over the years that those truths are sometimes best
displayed in mocking and exaggerated terms, and this album--on the
heels of 1999's "Mule Variations" and along with this year's
companion piece, "Alice"--show him in absolute top form. On a
strictly creative level, these albums represent his own three-peat.</TE>
<TE>   Wilco's "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" (Nonesuch). There was a time when
you wondered if any of the many country-accented No Depression bands
were ever going to move beyond Gram Parsons' shadow, but that bunch
is coming fast and furious now. Just as Ryan Adams has blossomed on
his own, Jeff Tweedy and his band take a major step forward with an
album that combines folk, pop and ambient elements to combat feelings
of melancholy and self-doubt. In the end, he realizes that salvation
rests in love. "I've got reservations about so many things," he says
in one of the album's final numbers. "But not about you."</TE>

<DH>A show traces Renoir's surprising influence on American
painters</DH>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>History is attached to the back of major paintings--small tags
identify the artist and the title, of course, but additional labels
from museums and art galleries record where and when these works have
been shown, a kind of art-world pedigree.</LD>
<LD>   In a long gallery at the San Diego Museum of Art, freshly painted
in off-white and balmy sky blue for its next exhibition, only a few
works have been hung, while several dozen sit vertically on padded
carts. By the looks of the multiple tags on their backsides--some
typed, some hand-printed, some engraved on tarnished metal
plates--they are a well-traveled, well-heeled lot.</LD>
<LD>   And so they should be. This is a rare assemblage of paintings by
Pierre-Auguste Renoir and 19 American artists prominent in the early
20th century, including George Bellows, Isabel Bishop, William
Glackens, Robert Henri and Leon Kroll.</LD>
<TE>   At first glance, the activity-filled lawn tennis party of Bellow's
"Tennis at Newport" or the cool urbanity of two shop girls leaning on
a counter and chatting in Bishop's "At the Noon Hour" seem a world
away from the calm domesticity of Renoir's bourgeois scenes.</TE>
<TE>   But there is a point in bringing these works together: They
illustrate the idea that the French painter Renoir was highly
influential on critics, collectors and indeed the artists of America
in the first half of the 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   The show is "Idol of the Moderns: Pierre-Auguste Renoir and
American Painting," which opened Saturday at the San Diego Museum of
Art. It is co-curated by Anne Dawson, associate professor of art
history at Eastern Connecticut State University, and Steven Kern,
curator of European art at the San Diego museum.</TE>
<TE>   Renoir was critically and popularly admired for both style and
subject matter, says Dawson, speaking by phone from Connecticut. In
an overarching way, "he was seen as someone who was the connection
between the traditional and Impressionism, and also
Postimpressionism. He was seen as someone who kept trying to
experiment and to innovate."</TE>
<TE>   That notion conflicts with today's vision of Renoir as the
apotheosis of conservative 19th century tastes, with his sentimental
depictions of plump, rosy-cheeked women and children.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he had a big impact on the development of Modernism,"
Dawson says. "He was used by a lot of American critics to push
artists beyond Impressionism to more Modernist styles."</TE>
<TE>   The seed for the San Diego exhibition was Dawson's doctoral
dissertation at Brown University, which analyzed criticism of
Renoir's work in periodicals of the time such as the New York Evening
Post, New York Sun and American Art News. Then, she says, "I wanted
to expand my research into his influence on American artists."</TE>
<TE>   In 1996 she met Kern, who was curating a show at the Sterling and
Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass., about the
Renoirs collected by the Clarks. A year later, after Kern had moved
to the San Diego Museum of Art, he welcomed her proposal for a show
that would encompass Renoir's impact on three groups: critics,
collectors and artists.</TE>
<TE>   Dawson emphasizes that the influences tracked by "Idol of the
Moderns" are not based primarily on scholarly conjecture or visual
interpretations. It was the artists and critics who pointed to Renoir
as source and inspiration, in interviews, articles, letters and
books.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1800s, Americans were already aware of French
Impressionism, and the artist most identified with the movement was
Monet. Then, at the turn of the century, tastes shifted. By 1914,
American artist Guy Pene du Bois would declare, "Of the
Impressionists, the most admired man in modern circles today is
Renoir."</TE>
<TE>   "It had to do with a change in American aesthetics, what people
wanted to see in art, led by the critics," Dawson says. "One
important thing was that Renoir was modern but accessible, and his
works were sensual and happy."</TE>
<TE>   His late works were his most popular here. They are filled with
radiant people in idealized pastoral or domestic settings--for
instance, "Young Shepherd in Repose" (1911) or "Mother and Child"
(1910), both in the San Diego show. Women were favored subjects,
clothed and unclothed, and the critics and collectors drawn to them
were predominantly men, as Dawson's examples make clear. Dawson
writes in the exhibition catalog that two influential American
critics, James Gibbons Huneker and Willard Huntington Wright,
"especially admired Renoir's representations of women enjoying
traditionally acceptable and passive female activities."</TE>
<TE>   Renoir's palette and brushwork in these paintings were another
part of their appeal. "He started out in a more academic style,"
Dawson says, "then he was into Impressionism. In the  1890s he
switched to a paint application that was looser, more free, and his
colors became hotter, more intense. The three-dimensionality also
became more pronounced."</TE>
<TE>   In 1908, Huneker, the New York Sun critic, called Renoir "the
master colorist." In 1915, Wright, author of the popular book "Modern
Painting," wrote that Renoir "had one of the most penetrating and
powerful pictorial visions ever known."</TE>
<TE>   At about that time, the paintings themselves began arriving in
this country. In 1907, noted English art critic Roger Fry, then
curator of paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York,
recommended the first purchase of a Renoir by a U.S. museum, "Madame
Georges Charpentier and Her Children" (1878). He believed the artist
was underappreciated and wrote, "There are good judges who think that
Renoir is destined ultimately to take a higher place than any of his
contemporaries in the annals of modern art."</TE>
<TE>   Soon, other major art institutions felt obliged to obtain Renoirs,
including the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Detroit Institute of
Arts, and the Rhode Island School of Design.</TE>
<TE>   Private collectors were not far behind. The Durand-Ruel Gallery in
New York had its first solo Renoir show in 1908; it was so successful
it was followed by eight more in the next dozen years. The voracious
art collector Albert C. Barnes acquired his first Renoir through his
friend Glackens, who had gone on a European art shopping spree for
him in 1912. In 1923, when Arts magazine wrote about the museum
Barnes established outside Philadelphia, his Renoirs numbered 150.
The same year, Washington, D.C., collector Duncan Phillips purchased
one of the most famous Renoirs then and now, "The Luncheon of the
Boating Party" (1881)--a sale announced in the New York Times and
many other publications.</TE>
<TE>   While the market and commentators were acknowledging Renoir, the
artists were busy emulating him. In some cases, the influence was
direct and obvious. Glackens, for example, was popularly called "the
American Renoir." Dawson traces Renoir's impact on the painter from
1910, with the creation of such works as "Nude With Apple" and
"Family Group." which is in the show, on loan from the National
Gallery of Art in Washington. She points out the way it harks back to
"Madame Georges Charpentier and Her Children" in its casual familial
composition, feathery brushstrokes and coloring.</TE>
<TE>   The connection wasn't universally lauded. In Arts magazine in
1928, critic Virgil Barker wondered if Glackens was "too much under
the influence of the art of Renoir." If "Glackens was once a
genuinely native painter, he is now a French derivative." Several
other artists included in the exhibition show obvious ties to Renoir.
In Mary Cassatt's "Simone in a Blue Bonnet" and Kenneth Hayes
Miller's "The Shoppers," the high red of the subjects' cheeks and the
way daubs of color create form are Renoir-esque. Henry Lee McFee
applied similar elements of color and sensuous modeling to still
lifes.</TE>
<TE>   But in other cases, cautions Kern, the paintings "don't offer
direct comparisons. The artists were absorbing lessons that aren't
quite obvious. How Marsden Hartley was able to incorporate lessons
from Renoir into a New Mexico landscape, for example, is a little bit
of a revelation."</TE>
<TE>   Yet there is written evidence of it, in a 1918 letter he wrote to
Alfred Steiglitz about his Sante Fe paintings: "You will see a little
Courbet, and a little Renoir, and a little Cezanne, and you will also
see myself," he tells the photographer and gallery owner. "Idol of
the Moderns" includes two of Hartley's dramatic landscapes--"New
Mexico" and "Western Flame" (both 1919)--which feature mounds of red
mountains outlined in blue-black, under streaming yellow skies.</TE>
<TE>   Although Renoir made no paintings comparable to these, Kern
suggests we look for the influence in the free and vivid use of
color. Indeed, it is known that Hartley was taken by Renoir's use of
color. Hartley wrote in a 1912 letter, "Renoir is so lovely at this
time--the things he is doing are so simple and so pure and the color
so beautiful--he is perhaps at his best in color just now."</TE>
<TE>   "Idol of the Moderns" found a home at the San Diego museum because
of Kern's interest in Renoir and his influence, and also because it
could make use of the museum's collection. While most of the works
are borrowed, one Renoir, "Woman Combing Her Hair" (1907), and nine
of the American paintings--a quarter of the show--are from the San
Diego museum.</TE>
<TE>   The Renoir paintings wereselected to show the range of his work,
from his early to late career. However, because of their value,
Renoirs are especially difficult to borrow, and several on the wish
list proved impossible to obtain--including the landmark "Madame
Georges Charpentier and Her Children," which Kern says, "the Met
simply doesn't loan out." They were able to pry two other Renoirs
from the Met--"Young Girl With Daisies" and "The Waitress at Duval's
Restaurant."</TE>
<TE>   Generally, the works are being hung in groupings with visual
parallels--single portraits on one wall, duo or group portraits on
another, works that incorporate landscapes and still lifes in other
sections.</TE>
<TE>   The dates on the American paintings are telling. They cover just
after the turn of the century to 1937. By the early 1940s, the taste
for Renoir was fading, supplanted by the currency of abstraction and
art seeking to be more of the post-Freudian moment.</TE>
<TE>   "My reactions to Renoir keep changing," wrote Modernist critic
Clement Greenberg in 1950. "One day I find him almost powerful,
another day almost weak; one moment brilliant, the next merely
flashy; one day firm, another day soft." What was once deemed a
virtue--accessibility--paled; Greenberg criticized the artist's
"susceptibility to the popular."</TE>
<TE>   Will Pierre-Auguste Renoir have his day again? "It's possible;
everything's possible," Dawson says. "It's very hard to say where art
criticism is going to go, but it's clear that abstraction can only go
so far."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In "The Importance of Being Earnest" (currently in theaters),
writer-director Oliver Parker subdues the legendary satire of
playwright Oscar Wilde to unleash a quieter, gentler energy about the
role of fantasy in our lives. In "The Emperor's New Clothes," based
on Simon Leys' delightful novel about the reinvention of Napoleon
(opening Friday), writer-director Alan Taylor stresses the importance
of relinquishing unrealistic dreams and embracing who we really are.</LD>
<LD>   And in "Possession," the adaptation (opening Aug. 30) of A.S.
Byatt's Booker Prize-winning romantic novel about the differences
between Victorian society and ours, writer-director Neil LaBute
explores emotional disconnection.</LD>
<LD>   These films are the epitome of summer counter-programming,
indie-style: wit, nostalgia and serious soul-searching.</LD>
<TE>   "Wilde was at his best when revealing the hypocrisy of the upper
classes," Parker observes. "His ambiguities and paradoxes about
identity are very modern. But after 100 years, the target has
slightly changed, and I drifted more toward the universal. Through
the benefit of time, Wilde comes across as a more compassionate
figure, so we're tapping into the humanity in our own lighthearted
way, while abiding by his code of the comedy of manners."</TE>
<TE>   After tuning up with Wilde's "An Ideal Husband" in 1999, Parker
felt more confident tackling this more daunting iconoclastic classic.
Set at the start of the 20th century, "Earnest" stars Colin Firth as
Jack Worthing, a bored English country bachelor, who invents a more
roguish identity when staying in London. Together with his
ne'er-do-well partner in crime, Algy Moncreef (played by Rupert
Everett), they try to pull off a romantic deception to win the hearts
of a rebellious aristocrat (Frances O'Connor) and Worthing's
romantically sheltered niece (Reese Witherspoon).</TE>
<TE>   "I kept thinking about 'A Midsummer Night's Dream,' with its
mistaken identity and incredible revelations--how people are much
more uninhibited in the country. In the theater, the play's performed
too arch," he contends. "It's lost some of its irreverence and
outrage. And the original 1952 film version is a bit stuffy. I wanted
to shake it up and blow off the dust, which is hard to do because the
Wilde purists refuse to cut you any slack."</TE>
<TE>   While trying to remain faithful to the spirit of Wilde, Parker has
definitely added some modern touches that have ticked off Wilde fans,
such as the use of jazz music before its time and having O'Connor and
Witherspoon behave progressively ahead of their time as well.
"Funnily enough, the more I worked on it, the more I focused on the
metaphor of women obsessed with finding a man named Ernest. Women
still fantasize about their ideal man, and I explored the older
generation being more repressed and institutionally disconnected from
the younger.</TE>
<TE>   "I also went back to an earlier four-act version of the play to
develop the romance" between the niece's tutor (Anna Massey) and the
local clergyman (Tom Wilkinson), Parker says. "It's an eclectic bunch
to break up the theatrical English stranglehold, and everyone
shuffles to find their place in the balance of the ensemble."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Taylor ("Palookaville," "The Sopranos," "Sex and the
City" and "Six Feet Under") and LaBute ("In the Company of Men" and
"Your Friends &amp; Neighbors") digress from their usual urban angst to
explore the lost art of romanticism.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Emperor's New Clothes," Napoleon (Ian Holm) trades places
with a double and returns to France, only to be denied his destiny
when nobody believes who he really is. He then falls in love with an
impoverished widow (Iben Hjeile). It's a fairy tale, pure and simple,
but one that poignantly punctures the myth of Napoleon and presents
him as a redeemably humble man. "It was an odd choice for me as a
very New York indie director," Taylor says. "But what I liked about
Leys' novel ["The Death of Napoleon"] was its dreamlike quality and
poetry. Unfortunately, it was something that was lost in the painful
process of translation with [screenwriter] Kevin Molony. But I
attempted to retain the flavor of the book by including a scene where
Napoleon winds up in an asylum filled with lunatics who think they're
Napoleon. But most of all, I deepened the romance and resolved
Napoleon's personal dilemma."</TE>
<TE>   Taylor, who earned a master's degree in European history from
Columbia University before becoming a filmmaker, refuses to apologize
for "hijacking Napoleon and the 19th century" for his own fanciful
purpose. He sees Napoleon as a figure living in a glorious past and
an imaginary present who ignores the real world around him.</TE>
<TE>   "I always had Ian in mind," Taylor says of the actor who has
played Napoleon twice before, in "Time Bandits" and in the British TV
series "Napoleon and Love." "He looks great in that uniform and is so
good at undercutting his grand gestures. The big lesson here and in
all of my films is learning to be at peace with the small world that
you have."</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, "Possession" is one of the few films these days that
doesn't try to contemporize the past to make it more accessible,
recalling that memorable opening line from "The Go-Between" (1971):
"The past is a foreign country. They do things differently there." A
pair of contemporary scholars (Gwyneth Paltrow and Aaron Eckhart)
stumbles upon a cache of secret love letters of two Victorian poets
(Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle). As they follow a fascinating
trail of clues across England to the Continent, the detached Paltrow
and Eckhart echo the romantic journey of the impassioned couple more
than a century earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest concern I had from the start was how to make the
modern couple as interesting as the Victorian couple," LaBute says.
"When my collaborator, Laura Jones, and I put it side by side, there
is more attention paid to the modern couple, yet all they talk about
is the couple from the past. They are the ones saddled with finding
all the clues and traveling from place to place. There is precious
little time for them to fall in love, and they're so reticent about
it.</TE>
<TE>   "Our guiding spirit was that in this very staid and restricted
society, these two poets dared to be messy and let their emotions
overtake themselves for a period of time, whereas this couple living
in a completely permissive society have been hurt and are afraid to
dive in again."</TE>
<TE>   Creating those romantic sparks in "Possession" was a personal
challenge for LaBute, who is known more for the fireworks he has set
off in his previous work as a playwright and screenwriter. LaBute
says, "Some people are in relationships they're trying to get out of
or cheat on--something other than first romantic sparks between a man
and a woman. This was about the first steps that we take ... [toward]
courtship."</TE>
<TE>   So how did LaBute come to tread in such foreign terrain rather
than other previously interested directors, including Sydney Pollack
and Gillian Armstrong? By insisting that as a purveyor of troubled
relationships in his own work, he understood what these people were
feeling.</TE>
<TE>   Yet he still wanted to please the author, if not her devoted fans,
because he loved the storytelling and its poetry, with its haunting
denouement. So he consulted Byatt during the development process.
"Byatt was incredibly reasoned in her objections," LaBute says.
"She'd reel off five intellectual arguments why we shouldn't do
something, and we'd realize she was right. There were threads that we
created in paring down the material, and it was important that they
were dramatically satisfying as well as economical.</TE>
<TE>   "I read her notes about previous drafts," he says, and he felt
"that gave me license to make the changes that were important to me."
Among the changes were making Eckhart's character a brash American in
contrast with Paltrow's icy Briton, and creating such visual clues as
an underwater cave to prove that the Victorian couple actually met.
At the same time, LaBute retained the spirit of the novel by
conveying the same space and lineage of both couples.</TE>
<TE>   "The parallel stories help explain why romantic love is in such
disarray today. One hundred fifty years ago they took a chance and
were burned, but realized that it was worth the risk. The modern
couple is too desensitized to even try again. It took poets to make
that romantic leap, because they understood its power and passion,
whereas ordinary people today have lost the courage to take that
risk. So we bury it away. It's like not wanting to talk about our
dysfunctional family, allowing the dysfunction to fester until the
curse is lifted with an understanding of what happened in the past."</TE>

<DH>Sure, he's a highly respected, Pulitzer-winning novelist.
But Michael Chabon has Hollywood dreams too.</DH>

<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>In a cottage behind his redwood-shaded home here, Michael Chabon has
spent the last 16 months turning his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel
"The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay" into a screenplay.</LD>
<LD>   Six times he has sent drafts to producer Scott Rudin in New York,
and each time the draft has come back with notes: Try again. So
Chabon presses on with the seventh draft, hoping it will be the last.</LD>
<LD>   Literary authors have a long and tortured relationship with the
movie business, and it is rare for a writer to maintain a thriving
reputation while struggling with the idiosyncrasies of moviemaking to
maintain a simultaneous career as a screenwriter. Already a star in
the world of serious literature whose short stories have been
published in the New Yorker, Chabon (pronounced SHAY-bin) is trying
to push himself into the same league in Hollywood.</LD>
<TE>   Leading Chabon along the path is Rudin, producer of "The Royal
Tenenbaums," "Angela's Ashes," "Clueless" and "The Truman Show." They
seem at first an unlikely pair. Rudin--a gruff New Yorker as well
known for his screaming tantrums and impatience as his ability to get
movies made--and Chabon, the soft-spoken family man, holed up in
Berkeley, tapping out stories filled with so many big words the books
should come with a glossary.</TE>
<TE>   But while he has made big money with more popular fare like "The
Addams Family," "Sister Act" and their sequels, Rudin has a
reputation as one of the most erudite producers working today,
willing to gamble on literary fare unlikely to turn into the next
blockbuster.</TE>
<TE>   He has spent millions for the rights to novels like Jonathan
Franzen's "The Corrections"; Michael Cunningham's "The Hours," the
adaptation of which will be released this year starring Nicole
Kidman; Charles Frazier's "Cold Mountain"; and Chabon's two novels,
the first being "Wonder Boys," which headed to the screen starring
Michael Douglas.</TE>
<TE>   "You bet on people," Rudin said. "I have confidence in people's
talent. I think Michael's writing has extraordinary humanity and
behavior and detail and character. He's an authentic great writer."</TE>
<TE>   Chabon says he's heard about the Rudin of myth but never seen it.
Rudin, he says, has been sweet and solicitous with advice, often
acting like a big brother and helping Chabon navigate a Hollywood
that courts novelists with promises of big money, sucks them in and
then, often, shoves them off a cliff.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what would have happened if Scott wouldn't have
optioned [his first screenplay], or had someone else optioned it,"
Chabon says. "I might have had a very negative experience that would
have soured me on screenwriting. Cut Scott out of the picture? God
forbid."</TE>
<TE>   So when Rudin kicks the "Kavalier &amp; Clay" screenplay back to him,
at first there may be frustration and anger. But as he reflects,
Chabon realizes Rudin is right. "I totally trust Scott Rudin's
moviemaking acumen, so obviously there's more work to do," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Chabon is the latest literary heavyweight to take a whack at
Hollywood with varying degrees of success and disillusionment, a list
that goes back to F. Scott Fitzgerald and William Faulkner, and
includes Norman Mailer and John Irving, who spent 13 years with four
directors adapting his "Cider House Rules."</TE>
<TE>   Even in that company, seldom has any writer of serious fiction had
so much of his work bought by filmmakers in so short a time as
Chabon, especially one whose only novel-turned-movie barely made back
its costs. "It would make you think 'Wonder Boys' was a big hit,"
joked Curtis Hanson, the movie's director.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, producers and studios are gobbling up everything
Chabon writes for six and seven figures, often before he has written
a word--novels, short stories, even a children's book.</TE>
<TE>   His next novel, "Hatzeplatz," was optioned by Rudin based on a
three-page proposal about a Jewish detective married to an Inuit
woman, and FDR's plan to turn Alaska into a Jewish homeland. The
price? Somewhere around $250,000 for the option and $1 million if
it's filmed.</TE>
<TE>   Miramax optioned Chabon's children's novel, "Summerland," due out
Oct. 1, for mid-six figures, plus a million if it's filmed. Chabon
showed the company two chapters and an outline.</TE>
<TE>   The studio also optioned "Tales of Mystery and Imagination" for
six figures in an unusual deal that gives Miramax first crack at the
eight short stories in the collection--once they are written.</TE>
<TE>   Another short story, "Son of the Wolfman," is being developed into
a movie for the Lifetime network.</TE>
<TE>   Rudin bought "Kavalier &amp; Clay" outright based on a 1 1/2-page
pitch. The movie, which has not been cast, will be directed by Sydney
Pollack. And Rudin says Chabon can write the screenplay for
"Hatzeplatz" if he likes.</TE>
<TE>   First, though, he's got to start the novel.</TE>
<TE>   Becoming one of Hollywood's favorite writers doesn't seem to have
gone to Chabon's head. "I prefer to think of myself as a guy who has
never had a screenplay filmed," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Chabon, 38, is a former resident of Los Angeles, the scene of
several of his short stories. He lives in a two-story, brown-shingled
house in Berkeley. Roses bloom in the frontyard. Toys are scattered
about the living room and kitchen. The two eldest children, Sophie, 7
1/2,  and Zeke, 5, are in school. Year-old Ida-Rose sits on the
kitchen floor, dressed in a red jumper, while their 100-pound Bernese
mountain dog gently steps around her.</TE>
<TE>   Chabon works from 10 p.m. to 3 or 4 a.m. in the backyard cottage,
and when he comes downstairs shortly after 10 a.m., he looks like he
just woke up, his shoulder-length hair wet, with a few days' stubble
on his face.</TE>
<TE>   The night before, he hadn't shown for a reading at the San
Francisco Public Library. His wife, Ayelet Waldman, a public
defender-turned-mystery writer with her own TV deal, apologizes
profusely to a writer. "This never happens," she says. "It's my job
in this relationship to keep things going. We were at home reading
the New York Review of Books when Michael said, 'What time is it?' I
said, 'Oh, my God. You're supposed to be at the library.' "</TE>
<TE>   Chabon has danced with movie projects and TV pilots for close to
15 years, almost from the time he published his first novel, "The
Mysteries of Pittsburgh," long before he was blessed by Rudin.</TE>
<TE>   Chabon certainly didn't arrive in the entertainment world as a
naif; he understood what he was getting into. He describes his
attitude toward Hollywood as "preemptive cynicism."</TE>
<TE>   While a book is the writer's solitary vision, a film script is
much more collaborative. The script may get passed from screenwriter
to screenwriter as studio executives who never have written a word
give instructions, the stars demand changes and the director insists
on rewrites during shooting.</TE>
<TE>   For many novelists, the simplest way to deal with the film world
is to sell the rights, take the money and go on to their next book.
So far, most of Chabon's Hollywood ride has been without many of the
bumps.</TE>
<TE>   But then, nothing about Chabon's career has been ordinary. He
jumped onto the literary scene in the late 1980s with the throttle
pressed to the floor. William Morrow paid Chabon a $155,000 advance
for "Pittsburgh," his UC Irvine master's thesis, when most first
novelists receive $5,000 to $7,500.</TE>
<TE>   After that early success came 5 1/2 years of struggling with his
next book. He gave up after writing more than 1,000 pages and used
that experience to crank out a first draft of "Wonder Boys" in 7 1/2
months, a book about a writer who can't finish his book.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the novel was finished, he was newly married and his
wife was pregnant. He didn't have a book deal for "Wonder Boys," and
he needed money fast.</TE>
<TE>   So he did what so many writers before him did when looking for
cash--he wrote a screenplay, "The Gentleman Host," about two men on a
tour boat looking for dance partners.</TE>
<TE>   Rudin optioned the script in 1994, in what would become the key
event in Chabon's show business career, one that aligned him with the
producer. The relationship between the producer and novelist has
worked so well that they have an informal deal that gives Rudin first
crack at everything Chabon writes.</TE>
<TE>   With "The Gentleman Host," Rudin pushed him hard, teaching him how
to write a screenplay. The writer found the experience "very cruel
and very fruitful for me. It was a mess when he optioned it, and when
he finished with me it was really good."</TE>
<TE>   The script never made it to the screen, and Chabon learned how
capricious Hollywood can be. The screenplay wasn't filmed because the
Walter Matthau/Jack Lemmon movie "Out to Sea" also featured a cruise
ship in its plot. But Chabon used the script as a calling card,
showing producers he could write a filmable screenplay.</TE>
<TE>   Chabon was busy writing the novel "Kavalier &amp; Clay," so he wasn't
available to take a crack at the "Wonder Boys" script. But he found
the movie version so faithful to the spirit of the book that it
encouraged him to take on the adaptation of "Kavalier &amp; Clay," the
story of two Jewish cousins in the early days of comic books in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   Often when he thinks he's solved one problem with the "Kavalier &amp;
Clay" script, the solution throws something else out of whack. "It's
like those arcade games where a gopher head pops out," he says. "I
fix this and then another head pops out."</TE>
<TE>   Chabon will turn in a draft knowing something is wrong with it but
unable to figure out what it is. Other times he'll think he's nailed
it, only to have Rudin spot problems and tell him it's not ready.</TE>
<TE>   "I think your immediate reaction is to say the hell with it,"
Chabon says. "That's the animal reaction and that's almost every time
supplanted by much more reasoned, more mature further reflection."</TE>
<TE>   Chabon, Rudin and Pollack, who directed "Tootsie," "Out of Africa"
and "Random Hearts," recently spent three days in Rudin's midtown
Manhattan office working on the script, with Pollack acting out
scenes, using different voices for each character.</TE>
<TE>   Problems sometimes arise when Chabon cuts a scene from the book,
and Rudin wants it restored--a role reversal from the usual
situation. "The obvious temptation is to be precious and try to hold
onto things wonderful in the book and not so in the movie," Rudin
says. "Michael is incredibly unprecious about his work, and I've been
much more vigilant."</TE>
<TE>   Chabon has seen the other side of Hollywood too, the one without
Rudin's protection.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote a movie treatment for "X-Men" in 1996. He thought he
would be offered the screenplay, but a new director brought in his
own writer.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Jan De Bont, the director of "Speed," optioned Chabon's
script "The Martian Agent," which the writer describes as "Lawrence
of Arabia on Mars in 1899." It was never made.</TE>
<TE>   There was a pitch for a TV series about a Pittsburgh rock band. It
went nowhere, but a TNT executive liked it enough to ask him to write
another treatment, this one about a pair of families in Oakland. That
one was dropped after an executive shuffle at the network.</TE>
<TE>   A third effort, which would have aired in 2000, was turned down by
CBS.</TE>
<TE>   Television, with its hours of episodes, lends itself to more
novelistic treatments, Chabon says, with multiple plots and more time
than movies.</TE>
<TE>   "I like television," Chabon says. "I get television. I understand
it. I feel like I know how to write it."</TE>
<TE>   Each night, when his family is sleeping, Chabon walks into the
cottage in the backyard and goes to work on the screenplay of
"Kavalier &amp; Clay." A poster of Jackie Robinson crossing home plate
sits above his desk, inspiration for "Summerland," a 500-page book
about baseball-playing fairies that the publisher expects to have
"Harry Potter" crossover appeal. The first printing will be 250,000
copies, enormous for a children's book, and will have a $300,000
marketing campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Miramax asked him to write the screenplay, but, he says he just
doesn't have time. After "Kavalier &amp; Clay," he's got "Hatzeplatz" and
those short stories.</TE>
<TE>   Chabon doesn't worry about getting sucked into show business. Of
course, it helps that his fiction is selling for six and seven
figures, too.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was 10, I wasn't thinking of wanting to write
screenplays," Chabon says. "I wanted to write novels. It's OK if
nothing I write gets filmed. They can't really hurt me. I've been
very fortunate that I have the luxury of this other thing to protect
me. If it gets too uncomfortable, I can go home. I don't live there.
Because I have my fiction; that's where my heart is. I don't think it
can be broken."</TE>

<DH>Creativity and energy have revitalized the sound, thanks to
several new independent-minded bands</DH>

<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's just past midnight and the capacity crowd at the El Rey Theatre
is ecstatic as the White Stripes head into the final encore of a
series of stirring shows around town. I've seen three of them and am
kicking myself for missing the fourth. This Detroit duo plays rock
'n' roll as it was meant to be: urgent, witty, sensual, inspiring and
defiant.</LD>
<LD>   Jack White, the Stripes' singer-guitarist who combines the primal
power of the Delta blues with a solid sense of songwriting craft and
rock dynamics, is ripping through a song with such explosive force
that he could fill in for both Jimmy Page and Robert Plant in a Led
Zeppelin concert.</LD>
<LD>   The 26-year-old musician follows with a gentle love song whose
lyrics convey a nursery rhyme innocence. The audience, which knows
the song from the Stripes' last album, sings along with every word.</LD>
<TE>   As the set ends, I realize it's the best time I've had in a club
since ... well, a week earlier when the Hives played at the Roxy.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a temperature in the packed club hot enough to pop corn,
the Hives' music was as refreshing as two episodes of "The
Osbournes." The Swedish quintet's high-spirited music celebrates the
rawness and economy of classic garage rock and punk, and the band
backs it with a wonderfully entertaining persona.</TE>
<TE>   "People have called me smug," lead singer Howlin' Pelle Almqvist
declares on stage. "But we just believe in giving credit where credit
is due."</TE>
<TE>   That was the most fun I'd had at a show since ... a month earlier
when the Mars Volta put on a galvanizing performance at the Coachella
Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, or maybe three weeks before
that when a band by the burdensome name of ... And You Shall Know Us
by the Trail of Dead mixed a punk-aligned independence and
traditional rock sensibilities in a way that would have made the
group an ally of the Clash in the '70s or Nirvana in the '90s.</TE>
<TE>   Sense a pattern here?</TE>
<TE>   More than any time since the arrival of Nirvana, Nine Inch Nails
and the Smashing Pumpkins a decade ago, mainstream rock has a renewed
passion and creativity.</TE>
<TE>   This flurry of exciting new guitar-driven bands--which also
includes such groups as the Strokes from New York, the Vines from
Australia and the Black Rebel Motorcycle Club from Los Angeles--is
too new and the musical styles too diverse for the slogan-happy rock
world to even give it a name.</TE>
<TE>   Don't confuse these new outfits with emo (the post-punk
sensitivity of such groups as Jimmy Eat World and Dashboard
Confessional) or electroclash (electro pop-punk). Besides music that
is smart and soulful, the chief link between the Stripes, Hives, et
al is their fierce independence.</TE>
<TE>   No one is bold enough to claim this wave of bands is the Next Big
Thing commercially. Their mere presence, however, is a welcome break
from the dreary state of mainstream U.S. rock of the late '90s. If
these bands start picking up the same kind of enthusiastic response
across the country they are now getting on the coasts with their
compact, tuneful music, they could reshape the rock landscape.</TE>
<TE>   Gloomy record company executives complain publicly about
downloading, piracy and competition from video games as reasons
record sales are down 10% this year. But they fret privately about
the staleness of today's music.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is absolutely something exciting going on," says
Jimmy Iovine, co-founder of Interscope Records, home of Eminem, U2
and Nine Inch Nails. "These young musicians are not shying away from
the showmanship of rock music. They are extraordinarily exciting live
and pushing as hard as they can."</TE>
<TE>   Industry taste makers, including MTV and radio station KROQ-FM
(106.7) in Los Angeles, are also keeping a close eye on the progress
of the Hives, the Stripes and the Strokes to see if they should add
more of this new energy to their playlists. A few mainstream pop
stations have even begun playing the Hives' wonderfully raw,
energetic single, "Hate to Say I Told You So."</TE>
<TE>   The Strokes' album, "Is This It," has gone gold (600,000 copies)
and the Stripes' "White Blood Cells" is approaching 300,000 sold. In
what could be a coming-out party for this welcome new energy and
imagination, the Strokes and Stripes will play the 6,000-seat Radio
City Music Hall in New York in August. The Stripes' four sold-out
L.A. area shows drew 3,200 fans.</TE>
<TE>   These bands--independent and demanding--may not just change the
tone of pop music, but may also alter the way record companies do
business. Fearful of being tied up for seven years or more through
standard industry contracts, the Stripes and the Hives each entered
into limited deals that give them their freedom, if they choose to
exercise it, after just one more album.</TE>
<TE>   After years of bands' dressing down, the Stripes, Hives and
Strokes enjoy dressing up--in matching outfits that readily set them
apart from the rest of the rock brigade. Some of the bands, including
the Stripes and Hives, also seem to delight in creating a bit of
mystery about their backgrounds. Trail of Dead includes in its bio a
convoluted essay about some guiding philosophical underpinning to the
band's music--which may just be a lot of hokum.</TE>
<TE>   The idea behind all this is to wake up the rock 'n' roll audience
after years of semi-slumber.</TE>
<TE>   The excitement is evident in the faces of fans at the concerts.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a time when I thought rock 'n' roll was dying or
certainly being watered down, so I tried to sit down in my bedroom
and write songs that I wanted to hear on the radio," Jack White said
before one of the Stripes' L.A. shows. "It's great now to have people
come up after shows and tell me the music makes them care about rock
again."</TE>
<TE>   There are two paths for young musicians. The easiest is to copy
what's on the sales charts and the radio because that is what's most
likely to catch the ear of record company talent scouts. The
alternative is to make music you love, understanding that no one may
ever share your enthusiasm for it.</TE>
<TE>   Too much rock since Nirvana has sounded copied. Instead of being
inspired to make music as heartfelt and original as Nirvana,
musicians came away with the wrong lessons. They heard the pain,
anger and aggression in Kurt Cobain's music and tried to make music
with more pain, anger and aggression. The results felt calculated and
cartoonish. They also saw Cobain's anti-show biz attitude and took it
to extremes, becoming all but anonymous as performers.</TE>
<TE>   The result was music that was horribly insular--be it the
unrelieved darkness of Korn or the lighter, dumbing down
sensibilities of Limp Bizkit.</TE>
<TE>   Where the best rock has a depth and range that allow it to be
appreciated by adventurous listeners of all ages, the rock of the
late '90s was so one-dimensional that it was hard imagining anyone
older than 15 responding to most of it. There were
alternatives--especially a variety of British bands, from the highly
accessible Oasis and Verve to arty, ambitious Radiohead--but they
were minority forces in the U.S. marketplace.</TE>
<TE>   It's no wonder Eminem has been embraced by so many young people.
The rapper has far more in common, including emotional range and
personality, with the classic figures of rock than most hit rock acts
of recent years do.</TE>
<TE>   Critics here and in England may be overpraising the acts because
of the long drought in mainstream rock. But the enthusiasm is
genuine.</TE>
<TE>   John Peel, the London radio-show host who has been a major
influence on British rock tastes for decades, calls the White Stripes
the "greatest rock band since the Sex Pistols and Jimi Hendrix."</TE>
<TE>   The New Yorker magazine loves everything about the Hives, from
their matching mod outfits to the "Veni Vidi Vicious" album: "Short
and sharp, with twelve songs in twenty-eight minutes, it's the most
exuberant and powerful rock and roll in recent memory." And they've
been described by England's Q magazine as "the greatest show on
earth."</TE>
<TE>   Rolling Stone magazine calls the Strokes a "dynamite hybrid of the
bedlam, tension and flash that [underscores] the best, seismic New
York rock." The Strokes' music has the shadowy, sensuous feel of Lou
Reed's work three decades ago with the Velvet Underground--so much so
that the Strokes almost seem as tied to that era as Oasis was to the
Beatles' melodic signatures. The group's look, too, is very New York
rock--a black jacket-jeans pattern that stretches from the Velvet
Underground through Blondie and the Ramones.</TE>
<TE>   When you talk to members of these bands, the thing you hear again
and again is how bored they were with mainstream rock. Whether it was
the Hives experimenting with garage rock in Sweden or the Stripes
exploring the blues in Detroit or Trail of Dead testing its punk
instincts in Austin, these musicians couldn't imagine being popular,
because nothing they liked was popular.</TE>
<TE>   "I just felt like there was too much emphasis on people trying to
make money and be famous," the Strokes' Albert Hammond Jr. said by
phone recently. "It definitely surprised me when we broke through. We
certainly didn't think we were taking an easy path."</TE>
<TE>   "We always assumed that no one would ever care, so we were free to
do whatever we wanted," the Hives' Almqvist said recently at Warner
Bros. Records in Burbank. "We were so bored by what everyone else was
listening to that we made up a bunch of rules about things we didn't
like in music. We ended up with like 28 things--things like no
harmony singing or saxophones. We wanted to eliminate everything
except raw energy."</TE>
<TE>   The Hives were just into their teens eight years ago when they
started playing together in a small town west of Stockholm. They
started getting attention on the local scene after a couple of years
and released their debut album through Sweden's Burning Heart Records
in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The group's two albums radiate with a primitive, souped-up,
'60s-rooted mix of the young Rolling Stones and Mitch Ryder &amp; the
Detroit Wheels. It's fast and furious, a throwback to the spirit of
the '60s and '70s garage-rock bands saluted in the much-admired
"Nuggets'' boxed set.</TE>
<TE>   However, it's far from mindless energy. The Dead Kennedys, the
politically charged San Francisco group led by Jello Biafra, is one
of the group's biggest influences--and there is an underlying slap at
social conformity and political corruption in some Hives songs. But
the themes never slow down the music. .</TE>
<TE>   The White Stripes' search for inspiration led them back even
further--to the Delta blues of Robert Johnson, the so-called father
of the blues who died in 1938. In the music of Johnson and such other
landmark figures as Son House and Blind Willie McTell, Jack White saw
the "raw dirt" of rock 'n' roll, and he aimed for the primitiveness
of those old records.</TE>
<TE>   To sweep away the excesses and studio refinement that have
smothered the spirit of rock during the last 30 years, he limits the
instrumentation on stage and record to just guitar and drums.
Major-label bands routinely spend months and well into six figures to
record an album these days. The White Stripes recorded their third
album, "White Blood Cells," for about $2,000.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Hives, the Stripes--whose other influences range from Bob
Dylan to Johnny Cash--took years to find an audience. They had a lot
of chances along the way to compromise. By the time the duo had
released its second album in 2000, major labels in England and
America were throwing fat contracts at them, but the Stripes could
see the strings attached.</TE>
<TE>   "They were offering a lot of money, but we knew the dangers," Jack
White says. "Everyone came to us with suggestions. They thought the
sound would be a little more commercial if we added a bass player or
a second guitarist--things like that.</TE>
<TE>   "We figured that once we got tied to a contract, they'd also try
to tell us what songs should be on the album and what photo should be
on the cover and how we should dress and how we should bring in an
outside producer. What they were telling us was they didn't want the
White Stripes. They wanted another band that sounded like everything
on the radio."</TE>
<TE>   The Stripes eventually signed last year with a major label, V2,
but the terms were radical. Rather than tie them up for the standard
seven years, the pact covers only two albums, including the already
released "White Blood Cells." That means the Stripes will be free
agents as soon as they turn in the next album. The Hives' deal with
Warner Bros. Records is similar.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that the Stripes, Hives and Trail of Dead didn't pick up
immediate major-label interest with their immensely promising
independent albums points up how far below the radar they were. They
slipped by because they didn't sound like the copycat bands that most
label talent scouts were seeking.</TE>
<TE>   The Stripes and Strokes, in fact, had to go to England to be
discovered. There, the pop spotlight is much brighter for new acts.
(See box on Page 10 for the furor these bands caused across the
Atlantic.)</TE>
<TE>   Ever since the conglomerate takeover of the record business in the
'90s, labels have been under such pressure to show quarterly profits
that they have become increasingly cautious in their signings.</TE>
<TE>   Where record companies once sought promising talents that might
make three or four albums before finding an audience, they no longer
feel they have that luxury. If a band doesn't have a strong chance to
generate sales quickly, there's always another one out there that
sounds enough like Korn or Limp Bizkit or Creed or Blink-182 to stand
a good chance of immediate radio airplay.</TE>
<TE>   The Stripes, the Hives and Trail of Dead were finally signed by
major labels almost as personal crusades by the heads of the
companies. They're all executives with a history of following their
instincts.</TE>
<TE>   Iovine, who worked as engineer and/or producer with such acts as
John Lennon and U2 before co-founding Interscope, learned about Trail
of Dead from a story in a music magazine. He signed the band after
seeing it play in Austin.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Whalley, who worked by Iovine's side at Interscope for years
before taking over as chairman and chief executive of Warner Bros.
Records last year, fell in love with the Hives in May after hearing a
copy of the group's second album, "Veni Vidi Vicious.''</TE>
<TE>   "The whole vibe of the album was fun and exciting ... everything
that was missing from most of what was going on in America right
now,'' he said this month.</TE>
<TE>   Within 24 hours of hearing the record, Whalley entered into a
one-time partnership with independent L.A. punk label Epitaph
Records, which held the U.S. rights to the album and to the group's
next album.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Gershon managed the Smashing Pumpkins in the early '90s
before starting Outpost Recordings, whose roster included Ryan Adams'
old band, Whiskeytown. Gershon had just taken over as president of
entrepreneur Richard Branson's New York-based V2 Records last summer
when he asked someone at the label to put together a tape of some
interesting new bands. Listening to the tape in the car, he was
struck by a White Stripes number.</TE>
<TE>   "When I found out they had three records out, I went out and got
them," Gershon says. "I was dumbfounded that no major label had
signed them. The music felt so original and fresh. Who were they?
Where had they come from? A week later I was in their manager's
office in Los Angeles trying to find out."</TE>
<TE>   What he found out was that Jack White and drummer Meg White--who
are either brother and sister (their story) or ex-husband and
ex-wife, depending on which report you believe--made their first
album in 1999 for Sympathy for the Record Industry, a tiny Long Beach
label.</TE>
<TE>   Dylan once complained that the worst thing about contemporary rock
is that musicians have lost touch with the blues. The Stripes' music,
he'll be glad to hear, begins with the blues. But they aren't blues
revivalists. The Whites treat the classic style with enough respect
to retain its raw, earthy power, but bring enough of their
contemporary sensibilities to give the music a fresh, urgent edge.
They also maintain the right to move far from the blues when the
spirit hits them.</TE>
<TE>   Besides 14 original tunes, "The White Stripes" featured a radical
remake of Robert Johnson's "Stop Breaking Down" and a raw version of
Dylan's "One More Cup of Coffee" that recalled the eerie obsession of
Screamin' Jay Hawkins' "I Put a Spell on You."</TE>
<TE>   The album also reflects traces of Jack White's love of country
music, especially the earthy storytelling of Hank Williams and Johnny
Cash.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew that a two-piece band doing blues and country wasn't a
recipe for success, but I still remember the thrill of holding our
first single," says White, a shy, unpretentious young man who seems
to save his energy for the stage.</TE>
<TE>   "I had my own upholstery shop at the time, and I figured I would
just make these records on the side, which was fine. We didn't even
have enough money to tour when the first album came out, so I was as
surprised as anyone when we finally went on tour with Sleater-Kinney
after the second album and people in other cities started liking us."</TE>
<TE>   That interest had mushroomed by the time of last year's "White
Blood Cells," and White felt the need to reevaluate his recording
situation. He was frustrated that fans would often tell him at shows
that they couldn't find his albums in stores. He longed for the wider
distribution that a major label would provide, but he was wary of
sacrificing control.</TE>
<TE>   Enter Ian Montone, a Los Angeles attorney who made a reputation in
the indie rock world for working with such bands as At the Drive-In,
one of the most acclaimed punk-edged arrivals of the late '90s. White
had heard about Montone through the grapevine and called him.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as the Stripes started getting attention in England last
year, we had every major label flying to Detroit or London or Los
Angeles to see the band," says Montone, who now manages the Stripes.
"At first, I think people thought we were purposefully being clever
by saying we weren't interested. But we were interested in
maintaining absolute creative control--a genuine partnership between
the label and the band."</TE>
<TE>   The breakthrough came last year when the Stripes signed a deal
with XL, a hip British label that is the home of singer-songwriter
Badly Drawn Boy and techno-rock band the Prodigy. The contract is a
short-term, two-album joint venture between XL and the Stripes' own
label, Third Man, under which rights to the master recordings
eventually revert to the Stripes. The V2 deal followed.</TE>
<TE>   Labels generally insist on seven-year contracts that call for as
many as seven albums over that time, and the labels retain ownership
of the master recordings forever. Don Henley, Sheryl Crow and Bruce
Springsteen are among more than 100 artists who have joined together
as the Recording Artists Coalition to seek industry reform.</TE>
<TE>   For V2, the danger in the two-album contact is that if the next
Stripes album suddenly sells 3 million copies, the band could then
offer its services to the highest bidder, leaving V2 with little to
show for all its promotional work. "There is a lot of faith on both
sides in our arrangement with the Stripes," Gershon says.</TE>
<TE>   Music isn't the only thing engaging about the Stripes and the
Hives. There are the band members' colorful pseudonyms. Besides
Howlin' Pelle on vocals, the Hives include Chris Dangerous, Vigilante
Carlstroem, Nicholaus Arson and Dr. Matt Destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Where the Stripes dress in attention-grabbing red and white, the
Hives take the stage in black shirts and pants with white shoes and
ties. As with the Stripes, there is a bit of mystery surrounding the
Swedish band. In interviews, they have said they were the brainchild
of an entrepreneur and songwriter named Randy Fitzsimmons. No one
believes a word of it, since no one has ever been able to track down
this mystery man.</TE>
<TE>   What is clearly true about the Hives is the joyful energy of their
music--and their humor. The songs are so compact--often two minutes
or less--that their sets rarely last an hour. At one concert, Howlin'
Pelle said they were ordered to do short sets by the U.S. government
because anything longer might be dangerous to the youth of America.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros. chief Whalley was at both Roxy shows last month and
he went to New York to see them again.</TE>
<TE>   "I think something is changing," Whalley says. "The thing I like
about the Hives and some of these other bands is that they have a
real awareness of the roots of rock 'n' roll. It's a real breath of
fresh air."</TE>
<TE>   The buzz is definitely building.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a rawness and a realness to the music that has been
lacking in some of the disposable pop and rap-rock of the last couple
of years," says Kevin Weatherly, program director for KROQ-FM, where
the Hives' "Hate to Say I Told You So" has been among the most
popular songs for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Agrees Tom Calderone, senior vice president of talent and
programming for MTV and MTV2, "You can definitely feel rock evolving
once again." The music channel is so impressed by the Stripes that
they were one of two musical guests (with Eminem) on the recent MTV
Movie Awards telecast.</TE>
<TE>   David Fricke, a veteran rock writer at Rolling Stone magazine,
believes scores of other outstanding bands are just waiting to be
discovered.</TE>
<TE>   "These bands are coming along at a time when it is easier to spot
them," he says. "For years, the industry was caught up in Britney
Spears selling 5 million copies or Limp Bizkit selling 6 million or
whatever, and they couldn't see beyond that.</TE>
<TE>   "The sales numbers at the top aren't as impressive these days, so
the success that bands like the Strokes, White Stripes and Hives are
having down at the street level is more evident. When you look at the
numbers of the Strokes or the Stripes, they may not be Eminem-size
numbers, but 500,000 is the size of a large city.</TE>
<TE>   "Twenty years ago, that would have been an enormous achievement in
rock. The whole corporate method of accounting for success has
distorted what success means in terms of connecting with people in a
way that has a lasting effect. People who are into the Hives or the
Strokes now are definitely not going to be into something else in a
week."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>One strength of the new rock resurgence is the wide range of musical
styles. This isn't a horde of bands with a similar sound. These
groups are linked only by their passion, creativity and
individuality.</LD>
<LD>   The Strokes</LD>
<LD>   This New York quintet is the easiest entry point because it
mirrors the moody, minimalist, slightly world-weary music of an
earlier bunch of New Yorkers: Lou Reed and the Velvet Underground.
The question facing the band is whether it can move beyond that sound
on its second album, due next year on RCA.</LD>
<TE>   Even if you're skeptical, there's no denying the seductive charm
of the best tracks on the group's RCA album, "Is This It"--notably
"Last Nite," a slice of rock noir so enticing it sticks in your
memory as much as Reed's "Walk on the Wild Side."</TE>
<TE>   The Hives</TE>
<TE>   This is the next most accessible group. The Swedish quintet's
garage-rock sound combines the sass of the early Rolling Stones with
the driving insistence of the Stooges. Their live show (which is a
must) is far more charismatic than the Strokes'. The Hives reflect
marvelously the impatience and exuberance of youth.</TE>
<TE>   "Barely Legal" (Gearhead/Burning Heart) and "Veni Vidi Vicious"
(Sire/Burning Heart/Epitaph) are both gems. The best bet: "Your New
Favourite Band," an English import on Poptones Records that contains
highlights from the two albums.</TE>
<TE>   The White Stripes</TE>
<TE>   If you only get one album by these bands, make it "White Blood
Cells" on V2 Records. It's certainly fun when the Stripes do Robert
Johnson and Bob Dylan songs in concert, but their strength is Jack
White's songs. The elusiveness of love is his favorite topic, and he
masterfully conveys the accompanying sense of yearning and doubt.</TE>
<TE>   The Mars Volta</TE>
<TE>   Like Trail of Dead, this band came out of the intense, physical
Texas music scene that produced At the Drive-In, which has since
broken up. The Mars Volta, in fact, is fronted by Drive-In's singer,
Cedric Bixler, and its guitarist, Omar Rodriguez. The Mars Volta's
first album is months away on Gary Gersh's new, still untitled label,
but the band played with a windshield-shattering intensity at the
Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April. The music, with
some prog-rock touches, lacks the accessibility of the Hives' and
Stripes', but is thrilling in its own way.</TE>
<TE>   At the Drive-In's breakup "was poor timing because the group was
just starting to get attention," Rodriguez says, "but we had lost the
love of music. As a guitarist, I felt caged in and bored."</TE>
<TE>   ... And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead</TE>
<TE>   Conrad Keely, one of the group's three singers, grew up listening
to art-rock figures, including Frank Zappa and Pink Floyd, along with
the Beatles. He later developed an interest in punk, and Trail of
Dead's music reflects all those influences. The Interscope group's
sonic assault carries an almost symphonic grace in "Source Tags &amp;
Codes," one of the year's finest albums.</TE>
<TE>   Although he doesn't feel kinship with bands such as the White
Stripes and Hives, Neely is glad to see a door opening to new voices
in rock. "I think every band that has a different sound than what is
on radio now is like a rock being thrown at a very big car and making
some type of dent," he says.</TE>
<TE>   And Then ...</TE>
<TE>   The Vines, whose lead singer, Craig Nicholls, has an especially
charismatic stage presence, will release their debut album July 16 on
Capitol Records. Black Rebel Motorcycle Club should have a new album
next year from Virgin. The latter's guitar-driven, rock noir style is
as drawn from the Jesus and Mary Chain as the Strokes' is from Lou
Reed, although it shows more range.</TE>

<HD>His Songs, Her Call</HD>
<DH>Twyla Tharp and Billy Joel are an unlikely pair with a
project to match: She's creating a show from his tunes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS JONES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In the summer of '75, Brenda and Eddie, king and queen of the Parkway
Diner, were still going steady, unaware that deep-pile carpet and a
couple of paintings from Sears would not stem their inevitable fall.
In the spring of '02, Twyla and Billy, shooting to be the king and
queen of a Broadway fall, did not look much like they would be
sharing a bottle of white or a bottle of red any time soon.</LD>
<LD>   The stakes for Brenda and Eddie, characters in a rock song called
"Scenes From an Italian Restaurant," were merely fictional. But Twyla
Tharp and Billy Joel have staked their hefty real-life reputations on
"Movin' Out," an expensive and highly unusual new theatrical
entertainment that began performances at the Shubert Theatre in
Chicago last week and will open on Broadway in the fall. Instigated
and developed by Tharp, a woman hitherto known almost exclusively for
choreography, the show has no dialogue (and thus no book writer), no
incidental music and no original songs. Although "Movin' Out" is
rooted in dance, not traditional narrative, it is billed as the story
of six friends whose stormy friendships wax and wane through the
bucolic 1960s, the agony of Vietnam, and pain and reconciliation in
the years that followed.</LD>
<TE>   This story has been put together from 31 existing compositions by
Joel, the perennial piano man. Tharp says it all began with the
central question of what happens to Brenda and Eddie.</TE>
<TE>   And if the song implies that Joel's characters Brenda and Eddie
were an unlikely pair, Twyla and Billy seem equally mismatched.</TE>
<TE>   It's a Thursday morning in May at a spiffy new rehearsal studio
overlooking New York's 42nd Street, which these days looks more like
Downtown Disney than a haven of urban sin. Tharp has opened her
rehearsal to visitors from the Midwest. Clearly, this is one aspect
of the Broadway process that she does not especially enjoy.</TE>
<TE>   Tharp is tense and Joel is late.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we should wait another half-hour for him," says
Tharp, a noted perfectionist and self-confessed workaholic who has
won two Emmy Awards, choreographed five Hollywood movies (including
"Hair" and "Ragtime") and created more than 100 dances for everyone
from the Royal Ballet to Hubbard Street Dance Chicago. Since 1965,
she has maintained, off and on, her own company of dancers.</TE>
<TE>   "Billy's in the elevator," says one of the production assistants.</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, Joel finally ambles into the rehearsal studio,
spilling coffee and apologies. The night before, Joel was up very
late playing the piano, unannounced and without charge, for a group
of delighted investment banker types who happened to be hanging out
in the lobby of the swanky St. Regis Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   So this morning, when the car showed up at his hotel, he had the
blinds down and thought it was still the middle of the night.
"Actually," he says with a laugh as he finally sits down in the
rehearsal studio, "it was the middle of the morning."</TE>
<TE>   The hot beverage in Joel's hand, where the nails are bitten down
short, still is wavering. "I haven't had coffee in so long," Joel
says. "I've forgotten how to hold it." Ever on task, Tharp is already
moving to the first number, taken from the first act of the show, in
which Brenda and Eddie are enjoying their halcyon days.</TE>
<TE>   "This is 1967," says Tharp, setting up the number, "when things
were all perfect and rosy." "Summer love," adds Joel.</TE>
<TE>   "Summer love," allows Tharp.</TE>
<TE>   An assistant hits a button and a voice sounding very much like
Joel's begins to sing, and a band sounding very much like the kind of
musicians you can hear on such Joel albums as "The Stranger" or "The
Nylon Curtain" begins to play. Joel looks worried and leans over.</TE>
<TE>   "You do know," he asks, with nary a trace of irony, "that this is
not me singing." For "Movin' Out," Joel's longtime musical director,
Tommy Byrns, found a singer--Michael Cavanaugh--who sounds enough
like Joel that one will have a Joel-like experience. Cavanaugh, who
will head an onstage band made up mainly of longtime Joel backers,
sings all of the songs in the show.</TE>
<TE>   The recording moves unmistakably into the introduction of "Just
the Way You Are." Perched on a folding chair, looking at the dancers
with a rather touching combination of awe and pride, Joel begins
playing the chords in the air. "I didn't like this song for a long
time," Joel will later say, nodding in Tharp's direction. "I thought
of it as a chick song. Thanks to her, I like it again now."</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, Tharp is setting up another number. She
starts to talk about Eddie and Tony fighting together in Vietnam.
Tony? That's Anthony, the fellow who worked in a grocery store,
savin' his pennies for someday. He is, of course, warned about heart
attacks from a note-bearing woman named Mamma Leone and, thereafter,
decides he's "Movin' Out."</TE>
<TE>   In this show, Tony becomes involved with the restless Brenda. But
Tharp is getting ready to move on to where Brenda and Eddie make
up--a scene she calls "The Reconciliation."</TE>
<TE>   Joel, who clearly wanted his visitors to see more of the emotional
guts of the show, seems sorry there are not more dramatic scenes on
the day's agenda. "I guess we're only showing you the happy parts,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   Joel has been asked several times if he would compose a Broadway
musical. Scott Zeiger, who runs Clear Channel Entertainment and was
involved in musicals written by Barry Manilow, Jimmy Buffet and other
pop musicians, says the only way the commercial theater will attract
baby boomers and younger audiences is to get classic rock
author-musicians to write for the stage.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the composers with whom we all grew up," Zeiger said.
"Younger people are comfortable with their music." In addition to
Manilow and Buffet, Elton John, Randy Newman and Paul Simon have been
involved with musicals, albeit with varying degrees of success.</TE>
<TE>   The prolific Joel (he wrote 10 songs in seven weeks for his "An
Innocent Man" album in 1982) was an obvious target for these suitors
from Broadway. For one thing, his compositional range--which includes
ballads, classical-influenced work, Tin Pan Alley, jazz, Motown and
hard-driving rock--is larger than most of his peers. For another, his
big hits are more lyrically complex than most other artists' works.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the matter of Joel's ability to attract an audience.
Over a long career, the 53-year-old composer and singer has won six
Grammy Awards. In 1977, "The Stranger" spawned four hit singles
("Just the Way You Are," "Movin' Out [Anthony's Song]," "Only the
Good Die Young" and "She's Always a Woman"). In October 1979,
Columbia Records declared that Joel was its bestselling solo artist
of the 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   But there have been some less positive issues of late. Earlier
this year, Joel's tour with Elton John suffered from postponed
engagements after Joel declared he had been diagnosed with acute
laryngitis, inflamed vocal cords and an acute upper respiratory
infection.</TE>
<TE>   In February, he was nominated for a Grammy Award for his
collaboration with Tony Bennett on "New York State of Mind," but it
has been nearly a decade since he has had a hit album. And the last
hit single that many Joel fans recall was "A Matter of Trust" in
1986. (Last week, a Joel spokeswoman confirmed that the singer had
entered a Connecticut psychiatric and substance-abuse treatment
center.)</TE>
<TE>   Still, the main issue with Joel and Broadway has always been the
difficulty of persuading him to actually let his songs be used.</TE>
<TE>   The obvious question is: Why now?</TE>
<TE>   "It was explained to me that this was dance," Joel says. "It was
not proposed to me as someone making a musical out of my songs. They
were not going to cobble together a book. My words were to be the
dialogue. That was the difference this time."</TE>
<TE>   Joel leans back on his chair. "To be honest, I was ready for a
cringe fest. This could have been cornballed to death."</TE>
<TE>   His eyes mist. "But then I saw these incredibly beautiful, finely
tuned dances. For me, dance is a whole other dimension." As he
frankly admits, Joel is not so much a Tharp collaborator here as
someone who has allowed his existing songs to be used. It is Tharp
who has put the overall narrative together and picked which songs
will be used (some are lesser-known Joel compositions such as "I've
Loved These Days").</TE>
<TE>   But Joel is clearly emotionally--as well as financially--involved.
Like many artists at a similar stage in their careers, he's thinking
not of financial or popular success (he has all he needs of both),
but of artistic legitimacy.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know anything about the people, politics and machinations
of Broadway," Joel says. "I've written what I've written. These songs
are my children. They now have a life of their own. They're going out
and making a living."</TE>
<TE>   Tharp has been at the top of the dance world's pile of
contemporary choreographers for many years. On the face of it, a
musical based on the songs of Billy Joel looks like a risk she does
not need to take. But Tharp knows the attention--and the cultural
relevance--that can come from working with popular music. One of her
most celebrated compositions was "Nine Sinatra Songs," contemporary
dance choreographed to such songs as "My Way." A populist as much as
a perfectionist, she also has long craved what entertainment industry
people call "crossover appeal."</TE>
<TE>   Aside from her work in Hollywood (most of which is not recent),
Tharp choreographed and directed a Broadway production of "Singin' in
the Rain" in the mid-1980s, which, although not a critical hit, did
return its investment. Despite Tharp's reputation for choreographic
excellence and her driven personality, the world of contemporary
dance has never been an especially lucrative field--especially for a
choreographer with her own company of dancers to maintain. It's been
a long struggle to keep those who make up Twyla Tharp Dance on
constant payroll (many of them make up the cast of "Movin' Out").</TE>
<TE>   But one senses that a show such as "Movin' Out" was the only way
for Tharp to get the broader exposure of a major Broadway show with
the kind of control she insists upon. The only way to get that
control is to actually construct the narrative. With this show, which
she first conceived two years ago, she gets the populist hook of
Joel's music along with an $8-million budget and the freedom to forge
her own vision.</TE>
<TE>   Still, her affection for the Joel canon seems born both of genuine
affection--and of the choreographer's eye for finding the right roots
for dance.</TE>
<TE>   "Sinatra was a stylist, but he wasn't a songwriter like Billy,"
Tharp says, fingers tapping on a desk. "Billy captures the impulse of
time and character. There's a vivid quality and a sophistication to
his work. We've lived through the same times, and I feel very
comfortable with his material. I've really looked at these songs
almost as shards."</TE>
<TE>   From those shards, Tharp has put together a narrative arc. She
says she did this by listening to Joel's entire body of songs in
chronological order and finding the bigger themes in his
canon--getting out of Hicksville, dealing with Vietnam, finding love
and beauty in blue-collar America. She picked the dramatic songs, but
she tried to avoid the kind of literality you would find in "Mamma
Mia!"</TE>
<TE>   In other words, although the central characters of "Movin' Out"
are Brenda, Eddie and Tony, along with James (from the obscure Joel
song of the same name), Judy (from "Why Judy Why?") and Sgt. O'Leary
(a "Movin' Out" character), there's the kind of fluidity to the
characters that comes only from dance. Elizabeth Parkinson, who plays
Brenda, for example, also is the "Uptown Girl" at another point in
the show. So, at that point, is she still Brenda? Or another
character?</TE>
<TE>   Well, yes. But Parkinson, a longtime Tharp collaborator, prefers
to see the question in another way. "This show is unlike anything
that has ever been seen on Broadway," she says. "There is no book.
This is a play that's told through dance." Unlike Susan Stroman's
"Contact," "Movin' Out" makes one self-contained narrative arc out of
existing pop song lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   "This could be the antidote to what is ailing the dance world,"
says John Selya, who plays Eddie. "It's honest dancing. It's genuine.
And it's real. And everybody loves Billy's music."</TE>
<TE>   Still, one cannot help but think that the show's
success--critically and at the box office--will depend on how well
the story hangs together. Unlike "Mamma Mia!," this is not a comedy.
Yet Tharp still has had to shape a story from songs penned,
initially, as self-contained pieces.</TE>
<TE>   That said, both Joel and Tharp say that bigger stories are to be
found in everything Joel has penned. The worst that could be done
would be to worry too much about the lack of a book. "I'm sick of
being literal," Tharp says. "Dance is figurative and abstract."</TE>
<TE>   Joel doesn't stay long at the rehearsal. Interviews done, he's on
his way out. But his emotional commitment to this project--and
admiration for Tharp--is palpable. Tharp, relaxing for a moment just
before Joel leaves, points first at herself and then at the piano man
with the droopy features and the restless eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really rock 'n' roll," she says, eyes flashing. "He's really
high art."</TE>

<LD>Once again, the emperor has no clothes. The cover story on architect
Michael Maltzan's career success by Times architecture critic Nicolai
Ouroussoff ("Drafting a Career," June 23) accepts at face value that
the work for which he has built his reputation and success is even
worth noting.</LD>
<LD>   Ouroussoff and the wider architecture and art communities and
their supporters seem devoid of the ability to apply simple
empiricism. Collectively, the work of Maltzan, Rem Koolhaas, Frank
Gehry and others in their artistic camp manifest little more than
gimmicky concoctions of soulless geometric forms and a lot of
pretentious explanatory discourse about their meaning. Ouroussoff
even goes so far as to compare Maltzan's mentor, Gehry, with Frank
Lloyd Wright. What an insult to Wright, a true genius.</LD>
<LD>   What is sorely lacking is the simple act of taking a step back,
honestly assessing a thing and fairly articulating that, well, "it's
a piece of junk." The only morass those in the architecture community
need to find their way out of is the elaborate false impression that
this work has merit.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With reference to Don Heckman's article on the reasons for the demise
of the big bands ("The Big Band Survival Kit," June 16), reader Marty
Capune (Letters, June 23) refers to two American Federation of
Musicians strikes in the 1940s and then states, "After that, the
music changed slowly at first, with Stan Kenton playing bebop."</LD>
<LD>   I played trombone in local big bands in the 1940s and 1950s and
was a member of the union. Stan Kenton's orchestra was far and away
my favorite big band of that era. And I never missed one of the
band's live performances within driving distance of where I lived. I
even had the pleasure of speaking to Stan a couple of times, and I
have a large collection of his recordings from those years and
beyond, up until his death.</LD>
<LD>   To say that Stan Kenton, or his orchestra, ever played bebop is,
to me, a sacrilege. It's enough to cause that big band genius to
climb out of his grave, and holler in self-defense and set the record
straight.</LD>
<TE>   So, to every big-band musician's beloved Stanley Newcomb Kenton, I
say: Rest in peace, good friend. I will say it for you: Never would
any Stan Kenton band ever play bebop. Not ever.</TE>

<TE>   Marty Capune's letter calls the big bands "the best form of
popular music this country has ever known" and bemoans their demise
at the hands of rock 'n' roll.</TE>
<TE>   The big band people hated rock 'n' roll. The rock 'n' rollers
hated disco. The disco people hated punk. The punks hated the
dinosaur rockers. Singer-songwriter types hated heavy metal. The alt
rockers hate the boy bands. Lots of people hate rap. And every one of
these groups feels that its music is the best form of popular music
this country has ever known.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In "A Fearful Sum Recalculated" (Perspective, June 23), Kenneth Turan
speculates that perhaps we went to see "The Sum of All Fears" in
order to educate ourselves emotionally about what would happen in the
event of a nuclear strike at home. He hopes we will learn something
from watching the realistic depiction of the nuking of Baltimore. I
sense that Turan wanted to say something more critical of the film
but backed off for some undisclosed reason. Let me say it for him.</LD>
<LD>   The destruction of Baltimore is used as a mere plot device and an
excuse to move on to a much bigger ticking clock in the movie's
second hour. The filmmakers give us a story in which a large American
city is nuked, then they proceed to make us feel as though the loss
is somehow acceptable because the destruction of the entire world is
gonna be a lot worse, if Ben Affleck doesn't get there first to stop
it. (Please, don't make me laugh.)</LD>
<TE>   These filmmakers have trivialized our worst fears by making the
blast into little more than a scary special effect with few real
consequences on screen. Yes, the blast is convincing, but we don't
even pause with the characters to mourn the tragedy. Instead we are
whisked onward to deal with the unfolding international crisis. It's
an unhealthy, potentially dangerous thing to show an audience, and it
only serves to blunt our real emotional responses and make us think
unconsciously that a nuclear blast would be something we could
recover from. We could, but it would be awful. They don't tell us
that in this movie.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood continues to serve up mass destruction on a glossy,
half-baked platter dripping with computer-generated imagery, and
calls it realism. It isn't. We continue to pay 10 bucks, and become
more and more desensitized to real violence and to the dangerous
world we live in. Someone speak up. Kenneth Turan isn't going to.</TE>

Knight is playing dumb about the real problem at LACMA. Knight's
unflinching support of the plan to demolish the museum, close it for
five years and replace it with an ill-conceived circus tent is
distressing. The plan has been proposed without a consensus among the

<LD>Having just seen "The Allergist's Wife" at the Ahmanson, I can save
L.A. theatergoers some time and money ("You Figure It Out," by Jan
Breslauer, June 23). There is no meaning to this mediocre play with a
fine cast of actors. The few laughs in the second act are hardly
worth the effort of fighting downtown traffic to attend a play.</LD>
<LD>   The play is a gross stereotypical portrayal of a dysfunctional New
York Jewish family. Surely, there are better quality works available

<TE>   It's a pity that Jan Breslauer in her otherwise excellent piece
neglected to mention that Tony Roberts, who plays the allergist, is
the son of Kenneth Roberts, a noted CBS radio announcer and
commentator in the World War II era; and that co-star Michele Lee, if
my memory serves me well, is an alumna of L.A.'s Hamilton High

<HD>For These Artists, Practice Makes Possibilities</HD>
<DH>Praxis Project seeks to unite performers and choreographers
who want to pursue modern dance in a concentrated effort.</DH>

<LD>That Los Angeles is more an entertainment mecca than a fine arts hub
is a rarely disputed notion. If one aspires to be a film actor, one
makes a beeline for Hollywood; but if one wishes to be, say, a
concert dancer, New York and even San Francisco seem to have it all
over Los Angeles. There are dance companies here, but only a handful,
and most of those aren't even close to being full-time gigs for the
choreographers or the dancers. There are venues that welcome dance,
but no strongly defined dance scene.</LD>
<LD>   This state of affairs is no surprise to 32-year-old Kacy Keys, a
native of L.A. who danced professionally with San Francisco Ballet,
Houston Ballet and Boston Ballet. Keys abandoned performing for the
law and economic development more than a decade ago, returning to Los
Angeles in 1997.</LD>
<LD>   But once a dancer, always a dancer. For the last few years, Keys
has been working on a sidelight, Praxis Project, that would allow her
to dance and, she hopes, will jump-start the dance scene in her
hometown.</LD>
<TE>   "I wanted to merge my various skill sets," says Keys, who has a
bachelor's degree and a law degree from UC Berkeley and a degree in
urban planning from UCLA. "I've lived in New York for short periods
of time and in the Bay Area, and the ability of folks to pursue dance
in a more serious way is enhanced in those cities. I don't see that
here. Because of the dominance of sports and the entertainment
industry, any extra resources that might go to modern dance or other
fine arts endeavors are limited."</TE>
<TE>   Keys' Praxis Project ("praxis" is Latin for "practice"), a
monthlong series of classes and workshops, will culminate in
performances at downtown L.A.'s California Plaza on Friday and
Saturday as part of Grand Performances' summer season. The project
got its start in 1998, when she worked in then-Mayor Richard
Riordan's office in urban development. Ensconced downtown, Keys began
thinking about ways to help build a dance presence in the urban core.
Her first goal, she said, is to strengthen "the L.A. modern dance
community. The second part is that the arts in general act as a
catalyst for the community at large, that they have the ability to
improve neighborhoods."</TE>
<TE>   Praxis started with a $10,000 grant from the Los Angeles Cultural
Affairs Department in 1999. By then, Keys was pregnant with twin
daughters, and she delayed the project for a year. But at the end of
2000, Praxis sponsored its first series of master classes and
workshops at the historic Palace Theater on Broadway, where Anna
Pavlova and Fred Astaire once danced. Taught by a group of
professional choreographers, including Bay Area-based Janice Garrett
and locally based Ronald Brown, workshop attendees paid nominal fees
for participating and were selected by audition to dance in the
pieces, which were then performed at a weekend's worth of concerts.</TE>
<TE>   "We set up the workshop format for those folks who want to pursue
performing in some capacity, or to increase their training in modern
dance and to be able to do so in an intense, concentrated effort,"
Keys said. "It's also a way to put dancers and choreographers
together without having or being in a company."</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Keys received a second grant, but instead of putting on
another set of choreographer-dancer sessions, she took time to
incorporate, get nonprofit status and devise a more permanent
infrastructure for Praxis. The class-workshop-performance format
started up again this month, with Garrett, who heads an eponymous
company in the Bay Area; Brown, a Lester Horton technique teacher and
independent choreographer; L.A. resident Dorcas Roman, whose works
have been performed by companies in Brazil and Argentina; and
brothers Frit and Frat Fuller, who head L.A.'s Kin Dance Company.
About 50 dancers have participated in the classes and workshops; 25
will perform this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   This year, in addition to three works created or restaged during
the workshops, Praxis will showcase one piece in the repertory of
Garrett's company (her dancers are traveling to L.A. to participate)
and a Kin repertory work as well. One Praxis dancer, Johnny Tu, will
also get a chance to present a work created outside the Praxis
process.</TE>
<TE>   Two-and-a-half weeks into the project (classes and rehearsals are
held daily), Keys was among nine dancers at work at the Dance Arts
Academy in Mid-Wilshire. They were being introduced to Garrett's
"Hither Thither," a rhythmically intense number commissioned by
England's Northern School of Contemporary Dance. Garrett was
reconfiguring the piece for the Praxis Project. Think "muscle line,
and the motivation of feeling frantic," she told the dancers during
the 90-minute rehearsal. Demonstrating various moves, she watched,
delighted, as the dancers willingly took her lead, scuttling across
the room backward, hips swiveling, before turning to create
constantly shifting formations. The work yielded 35 seconds of what
will be a six-minute work.</TE>
<TE>   Across the hall, Puerto Rican-born Roman, a first-time Praxis
participant who specializes in contact improvisation, was rehearsing
another 10 dancers. Her Praxis piece, "Subtle Fragmentations," was
created out of the workshops as an exploration of physical and
emotional boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   Roman encouraged the dancers to use "the momentum from the floor,"
as various pairs hoisted and swung each other, traversing the room.
"Only half of these dancers had previous experience doing contact
improvisation," she said later, "but I'm finding many great dancers
here. They want to experiment and expand what they do."</TE>
<TE>   Brown's work for the Praxis dancers, like Garrett's, is built from
another work. "Fragile" premiered at the Black Choreographers'
Showcase at Los Angeles Theatre Center in April. The work requires 20
dancers: 17 are from Praxis, three from his original cast. "We have
dancers coming together from different levels, both technical and
with different sociological experiences," Brown says. "It's a large
undertaking, but the dancers are excited about the process."</TE>
<TE>   Keys says she hopes to make the project a biannual event. "The
fact that we've had a number of people performing and connecting with
each other, I think that's success. Every year we learn more about
how to market, how to structure, how to program. It's an evolving
process. We have people from all over Southern California to
participate. To me, that's a signal that there's a void that needs to
be filled. We have a vision, and we want to make it real--and stable.
If we can take Praxis up a notch and raise the resources, we could
have a strong reputation as a viable program in L.A."</TE>

<HD>High-Definition's Middle Ground</HD>
<DH>When broadcasters haven't yet caught up to the capabilities
of the TV set, what's a consumer to do?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>My television set has been a reliable friend and ally over the
years--there for me, without fail, through more college football
games and bad TV pilots than I care to remember.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, I didn't really blame my 27-inch Zenith several weeks
ago when it sort of emitted a belch of light, then took on a strange
greenish tint that I couldn't correct. To the end, it has been a
trouper, continuing to function even though the only things that look
normal on it now are golf tournaments, the Boston Celtics and certain
episodes of "Star Trek."</LD>
<LD>   What did annoy me, frankly, was the prospect of having to buy a
new TV, and no, cheap as I am, cost was not the paramount concern.
The issue, rather, has to do with the uncertainty surrounding the TV
industry's eventual switch to high-definition television. In a
nutshell, I fear purchasing a TV today that could become obsolete by
the time George W. Bush (who doesn't look all that bad greenish, by
the way) completes a potential second term.</LD>
<TE>   For those blissfully ignorant regarding such matters, television
stations currently send out programs on what is known as an analog
signal, the crummy old TV we've been watching for years. The
government, however, controversially agreed to give broadcasters free
digital spectrum worth billions of dollars to gradually make the
transition to a new system, with crystal-clear pictures and far more
lines of visual resolution.</TE>
<TE>   The expanded capacity offered by the digital spectrum can also be
used to split a TV signal into multiple channels, eventually allowing
a local TV station to create secondary feeds for 24-hour news, text
or interactive services, such as conveniently ordering products
featured during a program.</TE>
<TE>   The big come-on to consumers, however, has always been the promise
of high-definition TV, letting you see every bead of sweat during the
Super Bowl as if the game were being played in your living room.
Stores such as Best Buy, the Good Guys, Fry's Electronics and Circuit
City advertise and demonstrate this gee-whiz technology, which I've
been seeing at industry trade shows since the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Many TV stations have already introduced some high-definition
telecasts on a second channel, although few people have ponied up for
the sets, meaning those signals are going largely unseen. Moreover,
it's not entirely clear when the government will compel broadcasters
to phase out analog signals, with the expectation--especially in
light of the giveaway--that deadlines will be postponed and the
switch-over could ultimately take decades to achieve.</TE>
<TE>   Despite those disclaimers, because of my responsibility to the
public as a TV columnist (insert giggles here), I felt somewhat
obligated to consider embracing the future, although I wasn't
enthusiastic about parting with more than $3,000--at least six times
what a perfectly acceptable, conventional TV would set me back--to be
one of the newer kids on the block watching high-definition TV.</TE>
<TE>   The quest for the clearest possible picture, however, remains at
best murky. So I decided to visit multiple TV-selling outlets
anonymously, read Consumer Reports and try to make an informed
decision on what I should buy.</TE>
<TE>   Regarding my field work, either the economy is really bad or
salespeople recognize a couch potato when they see one, because in
most stores they descended on me almost as soon as I passed the
camera section. Interestingly, many of them not only patiently
explained technological differences when asked (though I'm not sure
they all got it precisely right), but some were also well-versed in
the twisted political road that led to this superhighway with no
clear onramp.</TE>
<TE>   As I began looking around, I discovered that true high-definition
sets with all the bells and whistles built into them are very
expensive, particularly when you realize that the content spilling
out of TV is supposed to erode our minds and moral compasses. Most
are tailored to the dimensions of a movie screen, with a 16:9
width-to-height ratio, as opposed to the 4:3 ratio of traditional
television.</TE>
<TE>   Conventional sets, meanwhile, still look pretty good to the casual
viewer, especially some of the newer models. Moreover, several
salesmen assured me that they are still selling quite well, and that
because the government is dragging its feet, I could safely buy a
good old-fashioned analog set with little fear of regretting the
purchase before it too Hulked out on me.</TE>
<TE>   Still, I thought, there must be some intermediate
ground--something between buying a potential Edsel and blowing
several grand merely to discern every mole during the "I Hate My
Wife's Sexy Clothes" episode of "Jerry Springer."</TE>
<TE>   Enter HD-ready or HD-capable sets, which generally occupy their
own row somewhere between the true high-definition Goliaths and
conventional models. These units, priced from about $1,200 to more
than $2,000 for the top 36-inch sets, can receive high-definition
signals provided you buy a decoder box (ranging from $500 to $700,
and the price keeps dropping) that plugs into the set.</TE>
<TE>   But hold on, even with the box you still won't see "high
definition" quality. I was told you also need to attach a
high-definition antenna to your roof, for another $150 or $200, to
pick up the necessary signal.</TE>
<TE>   So even if you bring home your HD-ready monitor, you still require
a few other devices, and enduring what sounds like a lot of grief, to
capture high-definition pictures. On the plus side, even if you don't
get the clearest possible picture now, you get a good picture and
have the potential to upgrade if and when the time comes. As one
salesman sensibly put it, buying HD-ready was less expensive without
"closing your door in any way on future developments."</TE>
<TE>   At this point, I was feeling OK about the HD-ready concept, but it
wasn't that simple. My old TV, the jolly green one, lives in a lovely
cabinet that also houses the CD player, TiVo, digital cable box and
VCR, with a DVD player somewhere in my future.</TE>
<TE>   My initial inclination, of course, was to buy a TV that more
closely approximated my waistline, feeling the TV and I should grow
up and out together.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, that raised pragmatic concerns about where I would
keep the new TV. For while the current occupant has plenty of room, I
learned that even some of the 32-inch sets, especially those with
HD-ready technology, would be a tight fit. Moreover, these babies are
heavy--the Sony model, for example, weighs 185 pounds, which would be
equivalent to stuffing my brother, holding his Lhasa apso, into the
cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   Several models were so big that I realized my choices included
ditching the cabinet or settling for a smaller model if I wanted to
squeeze the doors shut. Much as I like the idea of a TV that will
make people go "Ooh" when they walk in, I object to the concept of
the box overwhelming the living room. Even some salesmen assured me
this was a consideration for many people who could afford larger sets
but didn't want a contraption that looked like something out of "Star
Wars" strapped to the wall.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer Reports' Web site made me feel a little better about the
size issue, pointing out that 36-inch sets provide about 25% more
screen than the next rung down but can cost up to 50% more. It also
noted that price "doesn't track with performance"--and the kind of
27-inch analog set I was replacing is probably still the best deal.
Combined with the prospect of turning my TV cabinet into a useless
decoration, that sold me on a 32-inch, HD-ready model, which will run
less than $1,500 and leave me the option of upgrading someday if I'm
lucky enough to have the new TV make it to near-puberty.</TE>
<TE>   With that decided, now I just have to go through the rigmarole of
buying the TV, having it delivered, and hooking it up to the VCR,
cable box, TiVo, and speakers--although I may have to assemble a
committee to help with this task. (Some of the chains offer this
service free on larger sets, but after seeing what the poor cable guy
went through trying to get all those devices to interact, I'm not
sure I trust the operation to anyone with less than a PhD in
engineering.)</TE>
<TE>   Despite all the time I invested in the process, I'm still not
really sure if I'm doing the right thing and periodically fret that a
week from Tuesday someone will unveil a fabulous new innovation that
will render all my research moot.</TE>
<TE>   Then I remind myself to relax, that I will have a good set, a fine
set, a perfectly honorable new set, on which to watch more bad TV
pilots and untold hours of sports. And even if my TV doesn't render
others green with envy, after living the last few months with my
wounded old friend, that will be a nice change of pace too.</TE>

<HD>Some Nuggets From a Lean Season</HD>
<DH>It was not a notable year on Broadway, but 'Into the Woods'
and Elaine Stritch provided nice moments</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some years bring an embarrassment of riches. In 1958, for instance,
"The Music Man" prevented "West Side Story" from laying claim to a
Tony Award for best musical. In 1960, both "The Sound of Music" and
"Fiorello!" were awarded the big prize, leaving "Gypsy" empty-handed.
And in 1976, "A Chorus Line" stole the thunder from "Chicago" and
"Pacific Overtures."</LD>
<LD>   The 2001-02 Broadway season was not that kind of year. "Mamma
Mia!" is no "Gypsy," and the title alone of the wickedly clever
"Urinetown" limits its audience.</LD>
<LD>   Still, the big Tony winners--"Thoroughly Modern Millie" (best
musical and five other awards), "Into the Woods" (best musical
revival) and "Elaine Stritch at Liberty" (special theatrical
event)--offer pleasant and, sometimes, transcendent listening. The
cast albums of those shows have recently been issued, as have those
of a big Tony loser, "Sweet Smell of Success," and an off-Broadway
charmer, "The Last Five Years."</LD>
<TE>   **</TE>
<TE>   "Thoroughly Modern Millie"</TE>
<TE>   RCA Victor</TE>
<TE>   Like its make-over mad heroine, this show has continually
reinvented itself.</TE>
<TE>   After the many refinements made during its La Jolla Playhouse
tryout in 2000, the show underwent further revisions for Broadway,
including the replacement of roughly 40% of its music. Most
significantly, two more songs from the 1967 movie--"Stumbling" and
"Jazz Baby"--joined the list of tunes that had been dropped. Composer
Jeanine Tesori and lyricist Dick Scanlan have written eight new
numbers, which replace the two movie songs as well as some of their
own.</TE>
<TE>   Lively but unremarkable, these mock-'20s replacement numbers
substitute hard-sell Broadway bravura for much of the sweet,
unfettered fun of the La Jolla production. As Millie, best actress
Tony winner Sutton Foster gets the good stuff, her voice blossoming
with determination in the title song and softening with love-struck
wonder in "Jimmy"--two songs that remain from the movie. The best
Tesori-Scanlan number, a roar of independence called "Forget About
the Boy," remains from La Jolla.</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   "Into the Woods"</TE>
<TE>   Nonesuch</TE>
<TE>   A marauding giant flattens people in "Into the Woods"--a fate
remarkably similar to the one that awaited the cast of the current
revival.</TE>
<TE>   Fans had hard-wired the original cast recording into their brains,
so they were bound to be skeptical of any voices that didn't belong
to Bernadette Peters, Joanna Gleason or the other towering talents of
the 1987 Broadway company.</TE>
<TE>   During the show's pre-Broadway run at the Ahmanson Theatre,
though, it didn't take long to realize that the new performers had
found a fresh sense of humor and a renewed sense of urgency in this
grown-up fairy tale, in which composer Stephen Sondheim and script
writer James Lapine use the woods as a metaphor for the thrills and
terrors of life.</TE>
<TE>   Those qualities are vividly captured in the revival
recording--from the sprightly tone of John McMartin's narration to
the catch of emotion in Stephen DeRosa's voice as his Baker character
fathoms his duty as a father-protector.</TE>
<TE>   One of Sondheim's best-loved songs, "No One Is Alone," sounds
particularly lovely here, as hope shimmers in the voices of
characters--especially Laura Benanti's Cinderella--who pull together
after horrific tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest reason to buy the recording, though, is its
documentation of the changes that Sondheim and Lapine instituted for
the revival: the addition of a second wolf to "Hello, Little Girl";
the inclusion of the mother-daughter reverie "Our Little World,"
written for the 1990 London production; and the reworking of the
Witch's "Last Midnight" number.</TE>
<TE>   The haunting, taunting chills of that number are wonderfully
evoked by silky-voiced Vanessa Williams, who stands, unafraid, in
this land of giants.</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   "Elaine Stritch at Liberty"</TE>
<TE>   DRG</TE>
<TE>   Elaine Stritch has managed to become a legend without actually
being famous--a strange, in-between existence that makes for one heck
of a show business story in her reminiscence-confessional.</TE>
<TE>   Known for her dry comic delivery, gravelly singing voice and
feisty personality, the singer-actress, now in her late 70s, is
beloved in the world of musical theater for her association with the
songs of Noel Coward and Stephen Sondheim. She was the first to sing
Coward's wry "Why Do the Wrong People Travel?" in "Sail Away" and
Sondheim's self-mocking "The Ladies Who Lunch" in "Company." On the
live, two-CD recording of her show, she yelps, snarls and roars her
way through these songs and more than a dozen others--seeming to pour
her whole life into every note.</TE>
<TE>   Between songs, she is nakedly honest about stage fright and the
booze that once helped her overcome it, and in lighter moments, she
shares salty behind-the-curtains anecdotes.</TE>
<TE>   The recording (which contains just a few cuts to make it fit on
the CDs) is so crisp and full of personality that Stritch seems to be
standing in your living room as she explains, in another Coward tune,
"I believe that since my life began / The most I've had is just a

<TE>   "The Last Five Years"</TE>

<TE>   Among the many things to marvel at in Jason Robert Brown's one-act
chamber musical, perhaps the most astonishing is its ability to
convey just how much in love--yet out of phase--two people in a
relationship can be.</TE>
<TE>   The show charts a marriage from first date to breakup, with the
man experiencing events in chronological order and the woman in
reverse. Their emotions overlap from time to time, but are only fully
in sync as the story reaches its midway point at the wedding
ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, a 1999 Tony Award winner for his score for "Parade," writes
the woman's songs in a folk-pop style that allows her to express
herself with full-throated emotion, revealing her as a smart, brave
woman who sometimes gets tripped up by her insecurities. Sherie Rene
Scott sings the role in a smooth, powerful voice that is shot through
with yearning.</TE>
<TE>   The man's songs roar along in a honky-tonk rock 'n' roll style.
Norbert Leo Butz, who played the emcee opposite Teri Hatcher in the
L.A. presentation of "Cabaret," delivers them with wicked wit and
that overweening sense of self-confidence possible only in someone
who refuses to acknowledge his vulnerability.</TE>

<TE>   "Sweet Smell of Success"</TE>
<TE>   Sony Classical</TE>
<TE>   The 1957 film "Sweet Smell of Success" made its own kind of music.
The tale--about a sinister gossip columnist--had crackling dialogue
by Clifford Odets and Ernest Lehman and a muscular score by Elmer
Bernstein.</TE>
<TE>   Then a team of theater veterans--including playwright John Guare
and composer Marvin Hamlisch--attempted to give it a different kind
of music. The resulting stage musical took a drubbing from critics,
won only one of the seven Tonys for which it was nominated (John
Lithgow, for best actor in a musical) and then closed.</TE>
<TE>   Hamlisch's songs, with lyrics by Craig Carnelia, provide an
atmospheric '50s jazz soundtrack but are otherwise unmemorable. The
exceptions are "I Cannot Hear the City," a smoky love ballad destined
to become a favorite of cabaret artists, and "Dirt," a gritty ode to
humankind's hunger for nasty news.</TE>
<TE>   Lithgow wasn't given much to sing, so his performance as
gossipmonger J.J. Hunsecker is preserved here mainly in sneering,
barking lead-ins to ensemble numbers.</TE>

<TE>   Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair),
three stars (good) and four stars (excellent). The albums are already
released unless otherwise noted.</TE>

<HD>Perfecting the Art of Reading Faces</HD>
<DH>Alexej Jawlensky found rich variety in the human visage. A
new exhibition highlights the gems as he moved from realism to
abstraction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZANNE MUCHNIC</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The icons of modern art tend to be big, muscular paintings--Picasso's
"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon," Duchamp's "Nude Descending a Staircase,"
Leger's "The Mechanic," Mondrian's "Broadway Boogie Woogie." Harold
B. Nelson, director of the Long Beach Museum of Art, had something
different in mind when he organized the latest exhibition, "Icons for
a New Era: The Spiritual Abstractions of Alexej Jawlensky."</LD>
<LD>   Drawn from the museum's collection of 35 Jawlensky works, the
show, which opened June 15, features 21 small, vividly colored but
deeply introspective paintings that may have been inspired by
religious icons seen by the artist as a young man in his native
Russia. More to the point, his best-known works--portrayals of faces
that evolved from splashy, relatively realistic likenesses to
elegantly composed abstractions--have achieved iconic status in art
history. Resonating far beyond their modest size, which rarely
exceeds 18 by 12 inches, the faces have an enduring power and popular
appeal.</LD>
<TE>   "They are among the jewels of our collection," Nelson said of the
Jawlenskys, donated to the museum in 1979 by the estate of Los
Angeles attorney Milton Wichner. The bequest represents the work of
an artist who led a privileged artistic life in Munich and produced a
distinctive body of work, but was exiled in Switzerland during World
War I and died in poverty in Germany in 1941, crippled by arthritis
and scorned as a "degenerate" by the Nazis.</TE>
<TE>   "Jawlensky was such a magnificent artist," Nelson said. "He was
such a spiritualist. There's a depth of feeling to the work and a
serenity that unfolds throughout the years."</TE>
<TE>   Among the paintings on view, an early (circa 1914) still life
appears vibrant, but the title, "Mourning," indicates the artist was
always aware of the cyclical nature of life, Nelson said. "When you
get to the late still lifes, I sometimes liken them to extinguished
embers in a fire. There's an intense glow surrounded by darkness."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many of his peers whose work encompasses various subjects
and styles, Jawlensky was uncommonly consistent, Nelson said. "He
found rich variety in subtle variations of a similar image."</TE>
<TE>   Most often, that image was a face. In the show, three paintings,
created in 1915-16, portray a dark-haired girl as a solid,
almond-shaped form constructed of bright chunks of color. A 1919
example of Jawlensky's "Savior's Faces" series and a 1920 work,
"Christ," are relatively airy, but they introduce a religious tone,
with sad expressions belying the cheery, pastel tones. A trio of
later works, made in 1928-30, is named for seasons or weather: "Late
Summer," "Frost" and "Winter Ringing." Here, Jawlensky orchestrated
strikingly distinctive effects by applying different color schemes to
the serene essence of a face, reduced to a few lines and shapes.</TE>
<TE>   Born in 1864 in Torzhok, Russia, Jawlensky moved to Moscow with
his family when he was 10. He was educated for a military career, but
became interested in painting while he was a teenage cadet and began
spending his free time at the Tretyakov Gallery. He studied at the
Imperial Academy of Art in Moscow with realist painter Ilya Repin,
then emigrated to Munich, in 1896, in search of a more adventurous
artistic environment.</TE>
<TE>   By then, he was under the wing of Marianne von Werefkin, a wealthy
artist four years his senior who gave up her career to promote his
work and provide him with a comfortable lifestyle. Free to pursue his
artistic vision, Jawlensky became part of an artistic community that
included a more prominent Russian emigre, painter Wassily Kandinsky.</TE>
<TE>   Forced to leave Germany when World War I began, Jawlensky fled to
Switzerland in 1914 and lived there until 1921. His relationship with
Werefkin deteriorated, but he soon met his next angel, German artist
Emmy Scheyer--whom he nicknamed "Galka," the Russian word for a black
bird. Both the name and the friendship stuck. Galka E. Scheyer was
Jawlensky's agent first in Europe and later in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Despite her help, Jawlensky never recaptured his carefree life. He
moved back to Germany, settling in Wiesbaden in 1921. Struggling with
arthritis and a hostile political climate that considered the
unnatural forms and colors in his avant-garde work "degenerate," he
continued to paint until the late 1930s, but his work grew
increasingly dark and morose.</TE>
<TE>   Jawlensky is represented in museum collections throughout Europe
and the United States. Southern California has a particularly rich
holding of his work because Scheyer settled in Los Angeles, where she
promoted the work of a group she called the Blue Four--Jawlensky,
Kandinsky, Lyonel Feininger and Paul Klee. Scheyer died in 1945. Her
collection was later entrusted to the Pasadena Art Museum, now the
Norton Simon Museum. The holding includes 148 pieces by Jawlensky.
(The Simon is planning major exhibitions at the end of this year and
in 2003 based on that holding, along with the publication of a
catalog of its Blue Flour collection by Vivian E. Barnett.)</TE>
<TE>   Milton Wichner was Scheyer's attorney and acquired his collection
from her. Jawlensky was clearly his favorite artist, but he purchased
works by other Modernists as well. His Long Beach donation
encompasses 61 pieces--35 by Jawlensky and the remainder by
Kandinsky, Feininger, German artist Oskar Fischinger, and Hungarian
painter and sculptor Laszlo Moholy-Nagy.</TE>
<TE>   Wichner, who died in 1978, had no affiliation with the Long Beach
Museum of Art. It was chosen to receive his collection by his
accountant, Eva Mason, the executor of his estate, Nelson said. "She
looked at a variety of museums and selected this one, I think because
she knew it would be appreciated and shown. It would be a major
gift."</TE>
<TE>   The Wichner donation was first exhibited in 1981. Ten years later,
the museum displayed a large group of the Jawlenskys and published a
catalog on the artist. The current exhibition--which includes most of
the paintings but not the works on paper--has a new twist.</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with the museum's practice of mingling related
decorative and fine arts, "Icons for a New Era" brings together
"these jewels of our painting collection with ceramics and glass we
have been acquiring in the last five or six years," Nelson said.
"With a modest budget, we have been strategically purchasing works by
German and Austrian ceramists and French glass designers to
complement the Jawlenskys in our collection. We have marvelous glass
works by Charles Schneider and other artists, and early 20th century
ceramics that show an evolution from naturalistic rendering to pure
abstraction. This is the first opportunity we have had to show the
richness of those acquisitions."</TE>

<DH>Skip Chaisson's sharp, fast-cut movie previews have earned
a loyal following in Hollywood</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Skip Chaisson comes as close as you can get to superstar status in
the trailer-making industry.</LD>
<LD>   When A-list directors and producers like Michael Mann, Tony Scott
or Jerry Bruckheimer need some magic for their trailers--the two- to
three-minute previews shown in theaters before the feature
attraction--they call Chaisson, whose sharp, fast-cutting style has
inspired filmmakers and even led some to incorporate parts of his
trailers into their films.</LD>
<LD>   Known in the industry simply as Skip, this young Bruce Lee- and
comic book-addict has a deceptively mellow Southern California
attitude. But his ability to succinctly summarize a director's style
enables him to tailor trailers to each--a skill that has won him a
loyal following in Hollywood. Chaisson is one of a handful of trailer
editors who can boast personal relationships with filmmakers or
stars. They come to his office or call him at home directly (as
Chaisson's mother found out while she was visiting when she answered
a call from Tom Cruise).</LD>
<TE>   Here's how Chaisson assesses some of the directors he's worked
with: "Ridley [Scott, "Gladiator"] is really visual and adept at
creating other worlds.... Tony [Scott "Spy Game"] is more attuned to
contemporary editing styles, meaning he will take an image that he
has shot and be open to speeding up that image or reversing it. With
Michael [Bay, "Pearl Harbor"], when he choreographs a shot he is
telling a story within a shot .... Every shot has a beginning, middle
and end."</TE>
<TE>   "He asks himself, 'What is the essence of what I am actually
doing?' " said Tony Scott. "With a trailer, [that approach] makes it
easier because it is a sound bite and it's very valuable."</TE>
<TE>   This kind of personal contact is highly unusual in an industry in
which studios try to maintain direct control of the product and
sometimes actively work to keep filmmakers away from the editing
process for trailers and TV ad spots.</TE>
<TE>   With marketing taking on an ever more central role in the movie
business, trailers have a huge effect on the success or failure of a
film. The desperate need to attract audiences for upcoming films
makes for a highly pressurized and competitive environment that at
once keeps the trailer makers on their toes and leads to frustration.</TE>
<TE>   The pressure-cooker atmosphere does not seem to faze Chaisson.
Laid-back and full of "aw shucks" expressions, he is still somewhat
star-struck and modest about his talent.</TE>
<TE>   "I try not to impose my view on anybody," said Chaisson, who grew
up in Los Angeles and is married with two children. "I grew up
watching movies, and it's kind of cool to feel yourself a part of
it."</TE>
<TE>   Six months ago, Chaisson branched out on his own and founded Skip
Film, a subsidiary of Aspect Ratio Holdings, an advertising and movie
marketing firm.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent morning in his Santa Monica office, wearing a beige
nylon shirt printed with red hula dancers, jeans and bright-white
high-top sneakers, Chaisson is still busy with interior decorating;
he's hammering a blown-up Bruce Lee movie poster to a brick wall.
With his dark, curly hair closely cropped and a trim, athletic
physique, he looks more like a surfer than the somewhat nerdy,
computer-savvy, trailer-making guy he is. On most days he can be
found in his air-conditioned office simultaneously watching a movie,
reading a script and perusing one of his beloved comic books.</TE>
<TE>   Movies and scripts are the tools of his trade, of course, but
comic books are essential to developing his visual style, Chaisson
says. On weekends, he spends an average of $150 buying the latest
offerings.</TE>
<TE>   "Comics are like movies," he says. "But they are a still form.
When I look at them in the still form, I bring them to life. I think
that is what kids do. When I read a script, I see it in my brain.
Trailers are the ultimate comic book. When I read a comic book, I get
real excited. I hear the music, I jump around and do the sound
effects--at least that is what my staff tells me I do."</TE>
<TE>   Chaisson is a relative newcomer to the trailer industry, having
started 10 years ago at Kaleidoscope Film Group, one of the older
trailer houses. Perhaps that is why he is so open to questions when
most of his colleagues are so secretive that they verge on paranoia.</TE>
<TE>   Secrecy is prized--after all, they are working for the studios,
and a lot of money is at stake.</TE>
<TE>   "Our world is sort of a cloak-and-dagger kind of world," said
Anthony Goldschmidt, founder of Intralink Film and Graphic Design,
one of the oldest trailer houses in the business. "Many filmmakers
don't even know we are doing their movie--studios would prefer they
think it's being done in-house. It's such big business, and there is
such a great risk [financially for the studios] that everyone becomes
very proprietary and squirrelly."</TE>
<TE>   Goldschmidt too can boast of some special relationships,
particularly with Steven Spielberg, with whom he's worked since "E.T.
The Extra-Terrestrial." Goldschmidt is one of the pioneers in the
industry, and with his shiny silver hair and patrician Town &amp; Country
air, he plays the part well.</TE>
<TE>   As marketing costs skyrocket, with the average film costing about
$35 million to advertise, according to the Motion Picture Assn. of
America, trailers are an increasingly important piece of the
marketing puzzle. Because buying time on television is so expensive,
the trailers are the most cost-effective way to get a message out. A
recent Moviefone-Variety poll found that 78% of ticket buyers are
most influenced to see a film by trailers; 76% listed commercials as
the second biggest influence. (A studio's average cost for a finished
trailer is between $250,000 and $500,000, depending on the work
involved.)</TE>
<TE>   And because they are projected in movie theaters, they are shown
to the exact audience studio executives love--people who go out to
see movies. Trailers are also increasingly being used on the Internet
to entice the coveted youth audience.</TE>
<TE>   The need to bring in high numbers on a movie's first weekend has
resulted in a fiercely competitive climate for trailer-making
companies. Studios hedge their bets by hiring up to five trailer
houses at a time to work on one campaign. These "bake-offs" give
studio executives more to choose from and often result in studio
marketing chiefs splicing parts of each trailer together for one
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   These so-called Frankenstein trailers have become an annoying
reality of the business for the trailer house editors. Because there
is a little bit of several editors in nearly every trailer, it is
increasingly difficult to determine who did which trailer.</TE>
<TE>   "Winning or losing is upsetting," said Barbara Glaser, co-founder
of Ant Farm, one of the leading trailer houses. "Where it becomes
difficult is the Frankenstein trailer. It's just hard on the ego. It
is difficult to walk into the editor's bay and say, 'Can you add this
to your trailer?' You have to understand that at the end of the day
we are not making art."</TE>
<TE>   One of the reasons they are not making art is market research. The
competition to catch people's attention is so fierce that studios
hate to leave much to chance. Digital technology has made it cheaper
and easier to splice ideas together from several houses and include
scenes that test well in focus groups. A recent example was Sony's
marketing campaign for "Spider-Man," which was done by several
trailer houses--although none was told the others were working on it.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't always like that. Some old hands, like Goldschmidt,
still have lofty ideas about the craft of trailer making. He
maintains that market research has warped what used to be the artful
packaging of emotion. Goldschmidt, who created the famous one sheet
with the glowing finger for "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial," says
marketing research could have never foretold audiences' reaction to
"E.T."</TE>
<TE>   "How do you test if children were going to fall so in love with
that character or that they would be shouting in the theater, 'Don't
die, don't die'? How would I sell 'Gone With the Wind' in 30
seconds?"</TE>
<TE>   But as he acknowledges, today's audience is vastly different, and
he has had to adapt to it. "It is getting harder and harder to hold
people's interest because they are being bombarded by so much," said
Goldschmidt, who is also an acclaimed painter. "The pastoral
landscape has given way to the commercial landscape."</TE>
<TE>   That commercial landscape has led to trailers that give misleading
messages about a film--what trailer editors call "cheating"
audiences. So the trailer for "A Beautiful Mind" portrayed the film
as a romantic thriller rather than the dramatic story of a
mathematician's struggle to overcome schizophrenia. The one for "Snow
Dogs" made it appear to be a movie about talking dogs.</TE>
<TE>   In other cases, the trailer may not be misleading, but it gives
away seemingly everything. For example, was it too much to reveal
that Robin Williams was the killer in "Insomnia," as that film's
trailer did?</TE>
<TE>   "Do we believe in truth in advertising? The answer is a little bit
but not a lot," said Andrew Kosove, co-founder of Alcon
Entertainment, which produced "Insomnia."</TE>
<TE>   Kosove defended the "Insomnia" trailer, saying that the plot of
the film had little to do with Williams being the killer. The
filmmakers wanted to protect the real mystery of the movie--Al
Pacino's secret torment.</TE>
<TE>   "Giving away the fact that Robin Williams is the killer is not
really a gamble at all, because the audience doesn't really know what
the secret in the movie is," Kosove said.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, a successful trailer depends on the good relationship of
the filmmaker, the studio and the trailer editor. Most of the time,
editors must finish the trailer before the film is completed. Often
they are not given enough footage to make a full trailer. So they
improvise.</TE>
<TE>   One of Chaisson's most famous trailers was born of desperation.
When Bruckheimer contacted Chaisson about "Gone in 60 Seconds," not
much footage was available. So Chaisson used comic-book images,
photographs and graphics to enhance the film clips he had. The result
was a fast-cut trailer, wrapped in the frenetic energy of a car
thief's world. Meanwhile a voice-over informs the viewer that while
it takes almost three minutes to buy popcorn at the movies, it takes
a professional car thief 60 seconds to steal your car.</TE>
<TE>   The result was a trailer that caught the attention of film critics
like the Los Angeles Times' Kenneth Turan, who mentioned it in his
review of the film. "The most regrettable thing about 'Gone in 60
Seconds' is that it doesn't rise to the level of its excellent
trailer," he wrote. "That pumped-up piece of business has focus,
pacing, concision and wall-to-wall action--all the things the
full-scale version does without."</TE>
<TE>   Bruckheimer, who later used Chaisson for the "Pearl Harbor"
campaign, said he was dazzled by the "Gone in 60 Seconds" trailer.</TE>
<TE>   "The way he stopped it, the graphics he used and the type
styles--I had never seen that before," Bruckheimer said. "When you
get good work from somebody, you notice it. Everyone saw that
trailer." Chaisson is working on "Down and Under," Bruckheimer's
latest project, which will be released next year.</TE>
<TE>   Like most of those who create trailers, Chaisson initially worked
through the studio while making the early preview (known in the trade
as a teaser trailer) for Tony Scott's 1998 thriller "Enemy of the
State." Studio marketing chiefs like to be the middlemen between the
vendor and the filmmaker. But after Scott viewed the trailer, that
arrangement was over; he only wanted to deal with Chaisson.</TE>
<TE>   Scott felt that in the minute-long teaser, Chaisson had
successfully brought to life the essence of his movie--that
hyper-conscious feeling of knowing you are being watched. Using stock
footage and graphics he created on his computer system, Chaisson made
it seem as if you were inside a satellite surveillance truck--or
inside Will Smith's paranoid mind. Scott was so impressed that he
eventually included scenes Chaisson had created for the trailer in
the movie.</TE>
<TE>   Now Scott will only work with Chaisson. When the studios want to
bring in a different editor, Scott makes sure it doesn't happen.</TE>
<TE>   "I say, 'No. I want to work with Skip. End of story,' " said
Scott, who worked with Chaisson on last year's "Spy Game." "Luckily I
have enough weight where I can do that. Skip and I have a shorthand."</TE>
<TE>   Chaisson is not ruling out one day becoming a director himself. He
is serving as executive producer on and cutting Tony and Ridley
Scott's latest television project for CBS, "American Fighter Pilot,"
which chronicles the lives of Florida-based fighter pilots. The show
had been canceled but is scheduled to return early next year as a
midseason replacement.</TE>
<TE>   Chaisson's mellow style has served him well. He has managed to
work closely with directors and stars who have reputations for
maddening nitpicking. Tom Cruise was so involved with the editing of
"Mission: Impossible 2" that he personally approved certain sections
of the music Chaisson had chosen for the trailer.</TE>
<TE>   Superstars like Cruise and Mel Gibson have the juice and the
know-how to dictate how much of the movie they want to give away in
the trailer. They know who their audience is and are keenly aware of
what shots to include to sell their image. Gibson worked with
Chaisson for days on the "Braveheart" teaser. For Chaisson it was a
particularly interesting experience because Gibson had quit smoking
the day they began working together.</TE>
<TE>   "He was drinking Cokes and popping Hershey's Kisses in his mouth
all day long," Chaisson recalled. "He had crazy hair and was quirky
and witty. He was crazy. But it was fun."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Mann, a director known for meticulous attention to detail,
said he regularly requests Chaisson. He was impressed by the work he
did on the television campaign for "The Insider."</TE>
<TE>   "He is a master of haiku," Mann said.</TE>
<TE>   Chaisson is able to get along with difficult directors and stars
because he is empathetic. He also has a full life outside work.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of pressure on people, and if you can understand
that from the beginning, then you can relate to them better,"
Chaisson said. "This is a job that helps you live. It's not like you
live to go to work."</TE>

<HD>Tom Petty Griping About the Music Industry? Nah, It's Just
a Metaphor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A lot of people will hear Tom Petty's upcoming album, "The Last DJ,"
as an indictment of the music business. The title song, for example,
decries the centralization and depersonalization of radio
programming. "Money Becomes King" is the narrative of a disheartened
fan who watches a rock hero's values and art get lost in a sea of
commercialism, to a point where the fan feels that "all the music
gave me was a craving for lite beer."</LD>
<LD>   Petty, however, advises fans not to take things too literally.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not about the music business," he says of the album, due in
October. "That's familiar turf for me, so it works as a good
metaphor. The music business is too easy a target to make it the
enemy. Probably the biggest focal point of the things I'm talking
about is the audience. What I find interesting these days is what the
audience is willing to accept. I often wonder if they even care. I
don't want to believe that....But there's a huge celebration of
mediocrity in our culture, and I don't remember it to this extent
before."</LD>
<TE>   Petty, inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in February,
started writing the album two years ago, focusing ideas and
discussions he'd had over a long time.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw it as a little audio movie," he says. "There are a few
characters and, I guess, a loose concept. But I didn't want it to be
too defined, too nailed down to where it's all a narrative. I wrote a
love song or two. I felt that these people had to have some hope in
their lives. By the end of the thing it's an optimistic view. The
last line is: 'You can't stop a man from dreaming.' "</TE>
<TE>   The topic proved to be inspiring not just lyrically, but also
musically to Petty and his band, the Heartbreakers. Working with
producer George Drakoulias, they crafted arguably the most dynamic
music they've made in a decade, exploring new textures in toughened,
dramatic, upbeat songs, and in such ballads as "Dreamville" and "Like
a Diamond," each featuring rich orchestral touches by Jon Brion.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, however, the album will face many of the same issues it
addresses.</TE>
<TE>   "The irony is that it's a commentary on how difficult it is to
sell an album this good," says Warner Bros. Records executive Jeff
Ayeroff, who will oversee the album's promotion campaign. "We're not
professing to have all the answers but will try different ways to
reach the audience."</TE>
<TE>   Ayeroff and Warner Executive Vice President Diarmuid Quinn say the
album calls for innovative presentations outside conventional radio
and video avenues, which haven't much supported new music by veteran
rock artists in recent years anyway.</TE>
<TE>   First off, Petty and the Heartbreakers are performing several
songs from the album on a new summer tour, which comes to Glen Helen
Blockbuster Pavilion Aug. 24. And in the three months leading to its
release, various Internet-based promotions, a possible "making of"
documentary from footage shot by director Martin Atkins and other
activities are planned to show the album as a complete work.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pivotal that people hear the album as a whole," Quinn says.
"The songs on their own hold up well. But it's meant to be heard in
its entirety."</TE>
<TE>   CELLULOID HEROES: Grant-Lee Phillips, formerly of the band Grant
Lee Buffalo, has been spending as much time dealing with film as with
music. He wrote and performed several songs for the 1998 movie
"Velvet Goldmine," he has acted in and contributed music to the WB TV
series "The Gilmore Girls," and he recently composed and performed
the score for the Wesley Snipes movie "ZigZag," directed by David
Goyer (who was a screenwriter on "Blade" and "Blade II").</TE>
<TE>   Now Phillips is taking a bigger step. He was selected as one of
six fellows at the Sundance Institute's Composers Lab, an intensive
two-week program, starting July 23, designed to develop new talent in
film music. Phillips will be joined in the workshop by Living Colour
drummer Will Calhoun, guitarist Billy White Acre, and composers
Vincent Gillioz, Sujin Nam and Bradford Reed.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been a dormant but long-standing ambition," Phillips
says. "I'm more interested in being able to diversify, to [juggle]
any number of projects, from recording my own albums, scoring films,
touring and acting as well."</TE>
<TE>   Each Sundance student will be assigned several scoring projects,
then collaborate with participants in the Utah facility's directors'
program. It all happens under the tutelage of advisors such as Thomas
Newman (Oscar-nominated for "American Beauty"), Michael Kamen
("X-Men," "Mr. Holland's Opus") and George S. Clinton ("Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"). Sundance Composer Lab director
Peter Golub, a composer himself, says interest in the program is
increasing among people with pop and rock backgrounds who are seeking
to follow Randy Newman and Danny Elfman into film scoring, but that
interest doesn't guarantee admission.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people are well suited to it," he says. Past attendee "Stan
Ridgway has a narrative songwriting aspect not unlike what we do in
film. Not every songwriter is well positioned to take this on. We
felt Grant-Lee was."</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: Janet Jackson is featured in the first single and
video for the title song from reggae-soul singer Beenie Man's
upcoming album, "Feel It." The video was just shot in Los Angeles,
with the two singers in an elaborate beach setting. The pairing was
arranged by new Virgin Records President Matt Serletic....</TE>
<TE>   Norah Jones will headline a KCRW-FM (89.9) Sounds Eclectic concert
Nov. 23 at the Universal Amphitheatre. Kinky and Thievery Corporation
are also booked for the evening, with more acts to be added. Ticket
information will be announced closer to the event....</TE>
<TE>   Illustrator Ralph Gleason, photographer William Claxton and
author-artist Kurt Vonnegut have signed up to contribute to the
"Greatest Album Covers You've Never Seen" project being overseen by
archivist Michael Ochs. The opening of the exhibition at the Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland has been moved up from September 2003
to next spring....</TE>
<TE>   Steve Earle, whose new album, "Jerusalem," is set for fall
release, will be seen playing a drug counselor in three episodes of
the HBO series "The Wire," starting with the July 21 installment....</TE>
<TE>   Minneapolis slow-core icon Low switched from Chicago-based
producer Steve Albini to L.A. veteran Tchad Blake (Los Lobos, Sheryl
Crow) for its next album, "Trust," due from indie Kranky Records on

<LD>   "Concubine Rice"</LD>
<TE>   Domino Recording Co.</TE>
<TE>   The album that Syd Barrett and Paul McCartney never got together
to make in 1969? That's the first impression of this debut from Lone
Pigeon--a.k.a. Scottish musician Gordon Anderson, an original member
of the Beta Band who left the group because of health issues. There's
a certain loopiness here puts him in the British pop-eccentrics
lineage running from the Pink Floyd founder through Badly Drawn Boy.</TE>
<TE>   But he also shows McCartney-esque song craft and melodic polish,
with the balance of his two sides threading through such mini-suites
of song fragments as the affectionate vignette "Melonbeard"
sandwiched between two introspective acoustic meditations of
late-night despair.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout, his sketches of depression are buoyed by moments of
upbeat whimsy, and the eccentricities are grounded by musical focus.
Conversely, the pop craft is deepened by naked emotion and,
significantly, a tone of healthy self-awareness.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't look back, it will be all right now," he sings in
"The Rainking." But then he looks back anyway with a reprise of
"Concubine Rice" and a bonus song, "I Am the Unknown," in a '60s
Brit-psychedelia mode--a knowing wink to wrap up a collection as
enjoyable as it is affecting.</TE>
<TE>   --Steve Hochman</TE>
<TE>   **</TE>
<TE>   OASIS</TE>
<TE>   "Heathen Chemistry"</TE>
<TE>   Epic</TE>
<TE>   "The Hindu Times," the album's opening track, echoes everything
that once made the Gallagher brothers' music so joyful: the blazing
guitars, the cocky, defiant vocals and the soaring melodies that
filled your spirits. "I get so high I just can't feel it," Liam
Gallagher sings in the song, which could be a teasing drug reference
but, given the doubts surrounding the band in recent years, is more
likely a statement about trying to overcome insecurities and fears.</TE>
<TE>   The trouble with "The Hindu Times" is that it's merely an echo.
It's as if Noel Gallagher, the English group's chief musical
architect, has carefully stitched together everything that was once
wonderful about Oasis.</TE>
<TE>   There's no evidence anywhere on "Heathen Chemistry" (due in stores
Tuesday) that he has regained the confidence and direction that
abandoned him after the critical and commercial disappointment of
1997's "Be Here Now" album.</TE>
<TE>   Whether upbeat or ballad, Oasis' music feels mostly lumbering and
vacant. There's some vitality in the hyper-blues undercurrents of
"Better Man" and the anthem-like "Probably All in the Mind," but they
seem just random moments of faded glory in an album that rarely rises
above average.</TE>
<TE>   -- Robert Hilburn</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   ** Truth Hurts, "Truthfully Speaking," Aftermath. When teamed with
producers DJ Quik (as on the Middle East-inspired single
"Addictive"), R. Kelly and Dr. Dre, this strong-voiced singer
captures the pleasure and pain of love and life with piercing
emotion. However, the rest of her debut album contains a surprisingly
bland batch of tracks from the normally reliable Timbaland and
Organized Noize.</TE>
<TE>   --Soren Baker</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2 Original Sinners, "Original Sinners," Nitro. There's plenty
of Chemical X left in L.A.'s prototype Powerpunk Girl. Exene
Cervenka's new band delivers lean, sinewy punk with a roots-rock
touch, and she sets aside the social commentary of her last
incarnation, Auntie Christ, to spin a punkabilly-fed whirlwind of
romantic screwball comedy and messy tragedy. Her wordplay is sharp
and her twang tart, but the music lacks the old force and new
surprises.</TE>
<TE>   --Richard Cromelin</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2 The Kennedys, "Get It Right," Jiffyjam. Are lovely, folky
records so taken for granted these days that Pete and Maura
Kennedy--Mr. and Mrs. Jangle--are relegated to Jiffyjam Records? It's
criminal. While their fifth album of new material lacks the breadth
of 1998's "Angel Fire" and doesn't exactly strike out in new
directions, it's still as comfortable as a smooth, winding stretch of
country road. Nanci Griffith contributes backing vocals on "Ride,
Angel, Ride," and if the harmonies don't leave you smiling, there's a
missive to an actress, "Why, Winona, Why?"</TE>
<TE>   --Kevin Bronson</TE>
<TE>   *** Chris Hillman and Herb Pedersen, "Way Out West," Back Porch.
These country rock veterans apply the word "west" pretty liberally in
this rootsy outing. Yes, they revel in the California honky-tonk of
Buck Owens and Wynn Stewart, as well as the Bob Wills Texas swing
tradition. But they also veer south and east through San Antonio
Tex-Mex, Appalachian bluegrass and Louisiana Cajun country. It's all
served up with a breezily confident, no-borders attitude that
shouldn't surprise anyone familiar with this duo's Byrds-Burrito
Brothers-Desert Rose Band pedigree.</TE>
<TE>   --Randy Lewis</TE>

<TE>   Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair),
three stars (good) and four stars (excellent). The albums are already

<DL></DL>
<LD>What is a jazz saxophonist to do? Every time these poor souls pick up
their horns to play, they must confront an internal rush of auditory
images from Charlie Parker, Lester Young, Coleman Hawkins and John
Coltrane, among others. How to love and accept these noble
predecessors without becoming totally captivated within their musical
webs?</LD>
<LD>   It's a tough question, but one that is at the core of the problems
affecting the 21st century jazz scene--where few jazz giants of the
quality of Parker, Hawkins, et al still walk the earth.</LD>
<LD>   The answers are few and far between. That's not to say there isn't
some extraordinary jazz being played by saxophonists youthful and
mature. If what they have to say often lacks the sound of surprise
that has been such an intrinsic aspect of experiencing jazz, it is
offered, at least, with dazzling technical facility.</LD>
<TE>   A group of current recordings featuring saxophonists displays a
few of the many roads that are being traveled as players pursue their
problematic quests for creative individuality.</TE>
<TE>   Joshua Redman, Sam Yahel and Brian Blade, "Yaya3" (***, Warner
Bros. Records). Redman has been viewed as one of the music's most
gifted young stars since his arrival on the scene a decade ago.
Unlike many of his contemporaries, he has attained a degree of
visibility reaching beyond the jazz community. In this leaderless
trio--with Hammond B-3 organist Yahel and drummer Blade (a group that
has appeared regularly at Small's in Manhattan)--he stretches out a
bit more freely, on both tenor and soprano saxophones, than he does
on the recordings of his own quartet. That's to the good, offering
evidence that Redman is continuing to grow and evolve as an artist.
The album as a whole, however, suffers from a darkness of tone and
concept, in part due to the somber sound of Yahel's organ work, in
part as the result of a program of not particularly inspired original
material.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Watson, "Live &amp; Learn" (***, Palmetto Records). Alto
saxophonist Watson, a veteran of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers (in the
late '70s) and leader of numerous groups of his own, possesses one of
the most important, and currently far too rare, jazz assets: an
immediately identifiable sound. Add to that a quirky sense of
rhythmic phrasing--one that ranges from occasional moments of
awkwardness to sudden bursts of virtuosic, bop-tinged brilliance--and
the resulting package is always fascinating to hear. Leading a group
that also features some fine tightrope-walking soloing by pianist
Orrin Evans, Watson errs only in electing to include a program almost
completely dedicated to originals. One or two--"Why Not" is the best
example--sparkle with melodic appeal. But for the most part, as with
the "Yaya3" album, the material provides too few hooks to pull the
listener into the music.</TE>
<TE>   Gerald Albright, "Groovology" (***, GRP Records). Three stars for
an urban jazz/funk album? What's going on here? Just this: One of the
primary criterion I use for rating albums is the question of how
successful an artist has been at accomplishing what he or she set out
to do. In this case, Albright has produced an album that is a
well-wrapped package of jazz and rhythm &amp; blues elements that should
have no difficulty appealing to its target audience. Beyond its sales
appeal, the album is a tour de force for Albright, who leaps from
saxophones, woodwinds, keyboards and percussion to background
vocalist. Occasionally, in the midst of all that versatility, he
knocks out a phrase or two--sometimes more than that--affirming the
imagination that simmers beneath the surface of his commercial goals.
Albright is aided in reaching those goals by a long list of
supporting players, including the estimable Sheila E., Bobby Lyle,
Ricky Lawson and others.</TE>
<TE>   Bennie Wallace, "Bennie Wallace in Berlin" (*** 1/2, Enja
Records). Commercial goals are not what one encounters in the music
of tenor saxophonist Wallace. Always a player who eludes stylistic
definition, he combines a dark, brawny sound--one reaching back to
the swing era--with a musical open-mindedness embracing everything
from mainstream and bebop to the jazz avant-garde. (Although he may
be the most individual stylist in this entire grouping of musicians,
he is one of the least known. So much for individuality.) In this
performance, working with the superb rhythm section of pianist George
Cables, bassist Peter Washington and drummer Herlin Riley at a 1999
jazz festival, Wallace emphasizes his edgy, outside-the-box
improvising. Opening with wildly ebullient choruses on "It Ain't
Necessarily So," he probes the inner workings of "I Loves You Porgy,"
duets splendidly with Riley to open "It Has Happened to Me" (based on
the chords of "It Could Happen to You), adds a Caribbean-style
version of "It's Only a Paper Moon" and a soulful "In a Sentimental
Mood" to a program without a single less-than-mesmerizing moment.</TE>
<TE>   Mel Martin, "Friends and Mentors" (** 1/2, Quixotic Records). Like
Wallace, tenor saxophonist Martin is a lesser-known player who has
moved easily across genre boundaries. For this latest outing,
however, he has chosen to remain primarily in a more straight-ahead
bebop mode (appropriately, given the fact that he calls his ensemble
Bebop and Beyond), with a group that includes Bobby Watson and George
Cables, as well as trumpeter Jack Walrath, pianist Mike Longo,
bassist Ray Drummond, and drummers Winard Harper or Billy Hart. The
album is thematically devoted to a series of Martin musical tributes
to, among others, Benny Carter, Dizzy Gillespie, Art Blakey, John
Coltrane and Duke Ellington. Although the pieces are inventively
crafted, an apparent lack of sufficient preparation time diminishes
their impact--a shame, given their potentially attractive qualities.
Fortunately, the soloing of Martin, Watson and Cables, in particular,
fill in the gaps of what could, and should, have been a much more
impressive outing.</TE>
<TE>   Gene Ammons and Sonny Stitt, "Boss Tenors in Orbit!" (*** 1/2,
Verve Records). Taking a look back at an era when the jazz scene was
still filled with individual stylists, here's a reissue from 1962
featuring two of the most inimitable voices of period. Yes, alto
saxophonist Stitt was a Parker disciple (although he insisted his
style was developed independently) and tenor saxophonist Ammons owed
debts to both Lester Young and Ben Webster. But each expanded upon
those initial sources to produce musical voices of their own. Equally
important, they both recognized the value of communication and
connection with their audiences. The result--notably obvious on the
driving sequence of choruses on tunes such as "Walkin' "--is a set of
performances that captures the imagination while keeping the feet
tapping.</TE>

<DH>With home-grown bands in a slump, the Brits went bonkers
for three groups from abroad</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL SUTCLIFFE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>There was a sign outside British music's front door last summer. It
read "Situation Vacant" and, in smaller print, "Wanted: the Next Big
Thing."</LD>
<LD>   The land of the Beatles was getting desperate for a new band to
prove that the nation's musical wellspring hadn't completely run dry.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, we liked our Dido and David Gray, our Coldplay and Craig
David. They're all very ... nice. But what we craved was rock 'n'
roll that stirred the heart and soul.</LD>
<TE>   We hadn't had much of it since Britpop and Oasis erupted in the
mid-'90s. So it seems that some seismic emotional shift occurred
whereby the U.K. tacitly decided that if it couldn't produce any
decent rock bands itself, it would adopt a few.</TE>
<TE>   That may be why we went a bit barmy over two then-unknown American
bands, the Strokes and the White Stripes, plus one Swedish combo, the
Hives.</TE>
<TE>   The White Stripes hadn't been heard in the U.K. before they paid
their own fares over to make a modest debut on July 26 at the 100
Club, a London cellar. Yet, 13 nights later, after a live session on
BBC Radio 1 and ecstatic music press reaction, when they delivered
their fiery punk-blues at the even smaller Boston Arms pub, suddenly
they were national news.</TE>
<TE>   Tabloid show-biz correspondents--dedicated followers of
celebrities, not indie bands--jostled their way in. Next day, the
3-million circulation Mirror unwittingly aped a notorious early
review of Bruce Springsteen when the headline on its full-page White
Stripes feature inquired, "Is this the future of rock 'n' roll?"</TE>
<TE>   One certain answer was that the U.K.'s music industry, fans and
media fellow travelers fervently hoped so. The White Stripes went on
to sell 120,000 of "White Blood Cells" (their third album but the
first released in the U.K.).</TE>
<TE>   That almost made the Strokes' British breakthrough look laggardly.
Their first U.K. gig, in January 2001, took place at the quaintly
obscure Wedgewood Rooms in Portsmouth. With no record released here,
they opened for ... And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead (whom
the wider British public has yet to discover). But six months later,
they were media darlings, selling out 1,500-seaters and eventually
selling 400,000 copies of their debut album.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after, the Ramones-like Hives benefited from getting a
couple of their overwrought performances on TV. Their "Your New
Favourite Band" album took off toward 100,000 sales, the gold mark in
U.K.</TE>
<TE>   Why did these groups sweep us away?</TE>
<TE>   Classic virtues. That's the best answer. Hard, short songs. Tunes.
They roar along, fast and strong. Live, they give everything. They
enjoy a bit of self-mythologizing and they are committed to style.</TE>
<TE>   In sum, they are characters, not cardboard cutouts.</TE>
<TE>   There again, when it comes to giving our heart and soul, we have
our hesitations. For one thing, naturally we really wish they were
Brits. For another, between bursts of euphoria, we wonder if they're
for real or some kind of mirage conjured up by desperation.</TE>
<TE>   But these doubts are unlovely. U.K. rock could do with a leap of
faith to traverse the present slough of stultifying, manufactured
tone typical of so much recent commercial pop.</TE>
<TE>   We may be encouraged by the words of one of the ultra-smart rock
'n' rollers in whom we vest our best hopes for an uplifting future,
perhaps with some inspiration to spare for the home-grown talent.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the self-assessment of Hives guitarist Nicholaus Arson:
"We have always thought we were better than we were. But now we're as
good as we think we are. Although, maybe we aren't."</TE>

<LD>Did you see that new study on nagging? Did you? Huh? Huh? Did you see
it? Did you read it? Did you really read it? If you didn't read the
nagging study, you should, you know. You will, won't you?</LD>
<LD>   Nagging is the dandelion of human relationships. How depressing to
learn that kids have learned to nag their way to pretty much anything
they want. (Forty-seven percent even have their own TV.) Hard to
believe. Isn't it?</LD>
<LD>   The Center for a New American Dream, which nags about responsible
consumption and conservation, surveyed 750 kids 12 to 17 years old, a
prime target for advertisers. The young people admitted they nagged
parents an average of nine times for things they wanted, mainly
consumer products. (Did you realize kids scored these things?) All
the clothing, shoe, movie, candy, soft-drink and fast-food makers
spend billions on thousands of commercials to nag millions of
impressionable teenagers to begin becoming lifelong customers.</LD>
<TE>   Ever obedient to commercials, though often not to parents, the
young person requests the item. A parent says, "No." A one-second
commercial for "No" in a sea of attractive enticements, an estimated
20,000 commercials seen by the average teenager per year. No! Easy.
Simple. Clear-cut. Totally ineffective. The kid asks again--and
again--and again. It's uncanny how adept even little people
are--learning, for instance, that "I want that toy!" doesn't work but
"I need that Tonka truck" is cute--and often effective.</TE>
<TE>   Let's blame advertising. Where else could today's kids learn
nagging habits? Do you know? Do you? C'mon, do ya? Because according
to the typical parent, their only involvement with nagging is adult
knee pain if rain's predicted.</TE>
<TE>   To adults, nagging arrived on Earth like moon rocks. It's not
nagging to tell 13-year-olds to clean up their room nine times? Is
it? Is it? C'mon, they aren't even listening until the third time.
They don't argue until No. 6 or 7. By No. 8 they're almost moving,
when the threat of grounding finally prompts life signs. Nine times
is reasonable, not nagging.</TE>
<TE>   So where but ads could young people possibly learn nagging? Surely
they don't hear nagging in homes, no nagging about money for new
curtains, cars or kitchens. No spouse ever nagged about dirty shoes
indoors, poor manners, strewn clothes. As much as humans say they
hate nagging, it's inconceivable any partner ever nagged about being
nagged.</TE>
<TE>   The only sense of justice in all this is that in, say, 20 years or
so, today's nagging kids will be nagged by their own kids. By that
time, today's parents will live elsewhere and deny nagging claims
that they spoil grandchildren. What can tomorrow's parents do about
the spoiling, except nag? It's going to be great. Don't you think?
Huh? Don't you? Huh?</TE>

<LD>Juliet Musso, an associate professor of public policy at USC,
describes herself as the world's biggest cynic. When she set out
three years ago to document Los Angeles' attempt to organize itself
into neighborhood councils, she assumed she'd be telling a story of
failure. To her astonishment, she found herself witnessing a
revolution.</LD>
<LD>   Almost unnoticed in the din of the Hollywood and San Fernando
Valley secession campaigns, residents of neighborhoods throughout Los
Angeles have been quietly mobilizing. Two years after voters approved
City Charter reforms creating neighborhood councils, 37 areas have
councils in place, and dozens more are in the works, from San Pedro
to Pacoima, Venice to Glassell Park.</LD>
<LD>   The idea behind neighborhood councils was to give ordinary
Angelenos a greater voice in government, foster community and
generally counter the sense of alienation fueling the long-simmering
secession movement. The councils were to go beyond homeowners' or
business associations, although such groups would be included, to
reach out to all "stakeholders" of a neighborhood, including renters,
employees, churches, schools and nonprofit groups.</LD>
<TE>   Even as some boundary disputes and personality clashes have
inevitably occurred, successes outnumber failures.</TE>
<TE>   "For a city that's stereotyped as not having neighborhoods and not
being community-oriented, with everybody driving around in cars and
not talking to each other," Musso notes, "it's just amazing."</TE>
<TE>   Take Doug Epperhart, 46, who works from home producing local
newsletters. He offered to do one for the fledgling Coastal San Pedro
Neighborhood Council and soon found himself president of a governing
board whose members range in age from late 20s to 70s and include
apartment renters and owners of expensive homes, longshoremen and
waitresses, parents and business owners.</TE>
<TE>   Epperhart's council recently alerted city officials to a
playground in ramshackle condition and snagged a $12,000 city grant
to refit it with spanking new swings and slides. While politicians
and pundits weigh the hypothetical merits and pitfalls of breaking up
Los Angeles, he and thousands like him are making the city work, one
playground at a time.</TE>
<TE>   Epperhart is optimistic that, in these days of term-limited City
Council members and closely contested elections, neighborhood
councils able to mobilize their members will have real clout at City
Hall, either as the councils are now or as part of a semiautonomous
borough system. Valley secession leaders remain cynics, dismissing
the councils as powerless even before voters overwhelmingly approved
them two years ago this month.</TE>
<TE>   With Hollywood and Valley secession up for a citywide vote in
November, it's time to recognize not only what neighborhood councils
can do but what they already are doing to unite rather than divide
Los Angeles.</TE>

<LD>Last week, animal rights activists persuaded the Animal Services
Commission, the city board that oversees animal shelters, to replace
Los Angeles' system of animal "ownership" with "guardianship." We're
not kidding.</LD>
<LD>   The top dog behind the reform, Elliot M. Katz, president of a
national group called In Defense of Animals, persuaded Berkeley and
West Hollywood to adopt a similar reform last year.</LD>
<LD>   Wrapping himself in the historical mantle of liberator, Katz holds
that "just as women used to be the property of husbands and blacks
the property of whites, [so pets] should be more than just property
to people."</LD>
<TE>   Or as Tahoe, a self-described "2-year-old canine," howled in a
letter published last year in the Bark, a quarterly dog-enthusiast
magazine in Berkeley: "I cannot be owned any more than my guardian's
human son can be owned.... Frankly I find it demeaning to put me in
the same category as his cellular phone and Dodge Durango."</TE>
<TE>   Katz and local activists like Gini Barrett of the American Humane
Assn.'s film and TV production unit claim that the change would be
cost-neutral and would encourage "the positive treatment of the
physical, behavioral and psychological needs of pets."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, it's unlikely that a fluffy new term would do much to
change the irresponsible attitudes of people who abuse pets by, for
example, failing to spay and neuter them or letting them run loose,
too often to die under the wheels of a car. Unfortunately, the name
change could expose city workers, veterinarians and others to the
legally murky claims of a fuzzy new animal rights legal movement.</TE>
<TE>   According to the American Veterinary Medical Law Assn., the claims
that could be filed on behalf of animals that are no longer deemed
property could include "physical and/or mental pain and suffering ...
loss of being able to breed or sire offspring ... [and] false
imprisonment by being caged by a veterinarian." Frankly, these fears
sound fanciful, but it is a waste of vets' time to have to worry
about such scenarios.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to believe that this measure will get as far as a vote
in the Los Angeles City Council, which could consider the reform as
early as July 8. It might not be the silliest thing ever brought
before the council. But when animal control workers struggle to curb
packs of street dogs and shelters have to kill pets as fast as the
legal deadline allows, it is definitely superfluous.</TE>

disagree. Public schools need to have and use the authority to leave
behind any and all students who disrupt the education of others.</LD>
<LD>   Where such disruptive students abound, no child advances. It's
great if an educational boot camp or some other specialized program
is available, but if not, the troublemakers must nevertheless be
removed. It is immoral to sacrifice the education of the other
children in a vain attempt to save these disruptive kids from
themselves.</LD>

<TE>   Bravo to Sartwell for effectively nailing those who parrot a
dangerous and senseless platitude to cover for our scandalous
failures in education--and us, for so eagerly swallowing their bait.
Interesting that he writes from an art school. Could it possibly be
that our creative minds speak more wisely, more truthfully and more
courageously than all our mendacious leaders and would-be leaders do?</TE>

<LD>Re "Amtrak's Future Remains Uncertain," June 25: As one who prefers
train travel (or did in times past) and has not flown in many years
(yes, I'm one of those), still, I say, unplug the endlessly futile
Amtrak subsidies and let the free market take a turn. Or have we lost
all faith in the private sector?</LD>
<LD>   At best, Amtrak is miserably mediocre. And yes, private industry
will have to work with government assistance for new, safer and
faster tracks--such as the projected high-speed line between Northern
and Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   If I have to take a bus in the meantime, or revert to the
precarious skies, so be it. Amtrak has had more than a
quarter-century to deliver. No matter how much more money it can
extract from cowardly politicians and presidents, it is destined to
forever fail. I dream of a better day on the rails.</LD>

<HD>No Public Funds for Religious Schools</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "School Vouchers Win Backing of High Court," June 28: Perhaps it
is time to remind those whose pro-voucher rhetoric is the loudest
that, by and large, it has been a free and public school system that
has educated the great majority of individuals who have built this
country into what it is, the greatest nation on Earth.</LD>
<LD>   Although educational performance seems to be of prime
consideration in the voucher movement, one need not be reminded that
schools serve an even higher purpose, that of socializing young
people of different cultures, economic backgrounds and ethnic and
religious persuasions. And although that purpose is surely high on
the agenda of any educator in any setting, public or private, I can
think of no more conducive atmosphere in which it might be achieved
than in a public school.</LD>
<LD>   Educational choice is every parent's right, and alternatives like
charter and magnet schools are manifest in the public sector.
Enhancing those types of learning environments is what public funds
should be used for, not for subsidizing private or parochial
education.</LD>
<TE>   Howard Karlitz</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chief Justice William Rehnquist writes that allowing public money
to be spent for vouchers to religious schools "provides benefits
directly to a wide spectrum of individuals, defined only by financial
need and residence in a particular school district. It permits such
individuals to exercise genuine choice among options public and
private, secular and religious."</TE>
<TE>   However, religious institutions are exempt from the Americans With
Disabilities Act. Children with disabilities will be left in a public
school system that will have even less money, once vouchers are
issued, to help educate them. By funneling public money into
faith-based institutions, as with school vouchers and with the
proposed faith-based service initiatives, people with disabilities
(approximately 20% of the population) will be systematically denied
choice and opportunity.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The stated purpose for vouchers is to give poor people the chance
to send their children to better schools. The effective result will
be to subsidize middle- and upper-class parents who already can
afford better education.</TE>
<TE>   There needs to be a requirement that any school receiving vouchers
must admit all qualified students and accept the voucher as "payment
in full" if the family can't afford to pay more.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Serantoni</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Supremes have outdone themselves this session. Vouchers for
private schools, drug testing of school choirs ("Student Drug Test
Law Valid," June 28). Here's an idea: How about random drug testing
of Supreme Court justices?</TE>
<TE>   Mike Wright</TE>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You can't say "one nation under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance,
but you can use taxpayer money to support religious schools through
vouchers. Now, that's what I call separation of church and state.</TE>
<TE>   John Zavesky</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An important, less-noble driver for school vouchers: The state
could adopt vouchers of $2,000 per child, at the level of only 25% to
33% of the real cost of elementary and secondary education per child.
Then all of us who proclaim faith in school choice can use the
savings of 75% to 67% per child to have our property and state taxes
reduced. This is a scheme worthy of Enron's legacy.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the same day that a Times editorial properly raises concern about
the antics of a Palmdale principal who suspended two students for
criticizing him in an underground newspaper (June 22), The Times also
has an article about a Garden Grove teacher who will no longer be
allowed to be the journalism teacher because the principal objects to
the editorial views expressed by students in the school newspaper.</LD>
<LD>   Apparently there are at least two high school principals who slept
through civics class and who fail to have an even rudimentary
understanding of the 1st Amendment. They further fail to understand
the purpose of journalism classes. The current [Atty. Gen. John]
Ashcroft mentality in the public school system is truly frightening
and ultimately poses a great threat to our liberty.</LD>

<LD>Re "United Airlines Asks for $1.8-Billion Loan Backing," June 25: The
correct answer to United Airlines' request to prop up its failing
business with massive taxpayer-supported guaranteed loans? No, no and
again no. Get away from the trough! The last time I looked this was a
vigorously competitive capitalist society. United wants to circumvent
this system with huge bailouts--using the facade of Sept. 11 as an
excuse for its horrendous management.</LD>
<LD>   There was never a reason to bail out any of the airlines
immediately after Sept. 11, as their insolent, uncaring attitudes on
proper passenger screening and security directly contributed to the
tragedy. There's even less reason today. United Airlines is a poorly
run, dispensable business that deserves to reap what it has sown.</LD>

<HD>U.S. Border Policy Not to Blame for Deaths</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>How does anyone justify blaming U.S. border policy for deaths so
obviously caused by greedy smugglers who value currency over life
("Deaths of 6 Reignite Border Debate," June 26)? And why point
fingers at the government that is trying desperately to protect not
only the economy and the rights of its legal citizens but to
safeguard the lives of would-be immigrants who might be dissuaded in
the face of tighter security?</LD>
<LD>   Never mind that it is imperative that this country get a firm
grasp on its points of entry. Let's instead lighten up on all our
security; invite everyone in whenever they like. Then we won't have
to worry about smugglers and their naive passengers--just terrorists,
overpopulation, economic disaster and higher taxes for legal
citizens. Yes, that definitely sounds like a better plan. Oh,
puh-leeze. Sounds like a knee-jerk reaction by an opportunist finding
a "suitable" party to sue.</LD>

<HD>Bush's Terror War Trumps Corporate Corruption</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Another attack on President Bush by Robert Scheer ("Bush Overplays
the Terror Card," Commentary, June 25). This time Bush is accused of
ruining the U.S. economy and using the war on terrorism to draw
attention away from corporate corruption and his handling of the
economy. Scheer also blames Ronald Reagan and the first President
Bush, both of whom finished their terms many years ago, for our
current economic problems but, at the end of his commentary, lays
only some blame on Bill Clinton.</LD>
<LD>   Let me remind Scheer that Clinton was running the White House from
1992 to 2000, when the stock market was going through the roof and
corporate executives were deceiving shareholders and employees. The
stock market collapse began before the current Bush took office.
Also, the Sept. 11 attacks played a huge role in damaging our economy
and shattering our confidence.</LD>
<LD>   Dan Sheehy</LD>

<TE>   Without the terrorism card, Bush is the emperor without clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Geoffrey Holland</TE>
<TE>   North Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thanks for Scheer's commentary. It's important to note that terror
would have found us no matter who was in the White House. The cards
that mattered were misplayed long ago. I wonder if Scheer might not
come to equate open markets with deregulation. If you look at it, the
economic froth that recently passed for prosperity has mostly been
based in cost-cutting. Cut your labor costs and keep the difference.
Cut your tax bill and keep the difference. Cut your regulatory
obligations and keep the difference.</TE>
<TE>   Moving production abroad, moving vital services and financial
institutions out from under the oversight of regulators and moving
corporate headquarters to tax havens are all aimed at the same thing:
reducing the number of those who share the benefits of enterprise
while enlarging the share for those who manipulate the levers.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, much purchasing power and taxpaying power have been
sacrificed to the scheme. Is it the Pakistani consumer or the Mexican
investor who will fuel the U.S. recovery? Just like deregulation,
open markets use pseudoscience to impress the trusting public.
Government is in the hands of those who most despise it.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, every working man in the country was simply unworthy
of his keep. His wages were too high. His government cost too much.
Now we're all waiting for his discretionary spending to kick in so
that earnings and tax receipts can get back on track. So, while he
refinances, we'll have to make what we can by raising the prices of
things we used to regulate. Pretty slick!</TE>

<HD>Groping to Find a Voice for a Lost Generation</HD>
<DH>Author crusades for a forum to address the issues facing
the hip-hop culture</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNELL GEORGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Of late, no matter where author Bakari Kitwana lands, everybody wants
to hang--"See a show. Check out some rap," he says, laughing his big
laugh as we roll through sluggish midday traffic in search of a solid
vegetarian meal--a feat, even in this land of fitness and health,
that's a bit more challenging than happening on a good party. "I
don't really hang out much," he continues, "I mean, I'm 35. Married.
Have a 4 year-old son. I have a lot more concerns than hangin'."</LD>
<LD>   Which is the axis upon which Kitwana's new book turns. "The Hip
Hop Generation: Young Blacks and the Crisis in African-American
Culture" (Basic Civitas Books) isn't about music, in the sense that
it isn't a critique or exploration of what's charting or in heavy
rotation underground. Instead, it tracks the subculture of African
American youths who have been marked indelibly by a fast-moving,
"goin' for mine" global economy that inspired the music, and the
music that has inspired the thriving multivoiced subculture.</LD>
<LD>   Their concerns, the crisis of Kitwana's subtitle, have long been
broadcast in rap lyrics: street violence, high incarceration rates,
tension between the sexes, lags in education, generational rifts. And
they have become the defining issues confronting a post-civil rights
generation of blacks who were supposed to inherit much more.</LD>
<TE>   "This Republican I know would say: 'Man, that struggle is over.
Over,' " Kitwana says. "And I thought: Over? I was interested in
where we fit. What we could do. And the older generation has not been
training us for when they're gone to a different plane. "</TE>
<TE>   Kitwana's "we"--the hip-hop nation, African American youths born
between 1965 and 1984--doesn't fit with Gen-Xers shaped by grunge and
the tech bubble's boom and bust. Nor does this group see its
immediate cultural touchstones as Martin and Malcolm--who some seem
to know best through samples sprinkled into conscious
(political/message music) rap. "Most know [the civil rights movement]
as integrationist or nationalist. Either Martin or Malcolm. But there
is so much more. A lot of the book is my personal journey and how
we--this generation--define the struggle," he explains. "Part of the
power of hip-hop is that the average kid feels his voice matters. You
don't need an instrument. Or fancy clothes. But you get heard."</TE>
<TE>   No National Organization</TE>
<TE>   Touching down in L.A. for a few days on his grass-roots,
spread-the-word tour, Kitwana has been sussing out collectives and
activists around the country who are pressing for change from the
ground up. "People don't know what's all happening because we don't
have a national organization to help take it to the next level."</TE>
<TE>   Kitwana, who was born on the early end of the hip-hop generation,
grew up in Long Island during an era when hip-hop didn't have a name.
"It was just the music that was played at a party. And the rapper,
well, he was the DJ's boy who was carryin' in the [record] crates."</TE>
<TE>   Kitwana was moved as much by party culture as he was by the need
to rally against antigang legislation and racial profiling. And, by
the time he'd enrolled at the University of Rochester (N.Y.), where
he moved from mechanical engineering to English and education--he had
become a committed student activist seeking models, in the streets
and on the page, that might provide some  solutions.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, activism led him to a job as editor at Third World
Press, where he worked for its founder, Haki Madhubuti, poet,
essayist and publisher, a major influence in the Black Arts Movement
of the late '60s and '70s. That put him in conversations with the
elders--Sonia Sanchez, Gwendolyn Brooks and Kalamu ya Salaam--whose
books he was reading, or who gathered in the offices. He was immersed
in the history of the black-power movement, and the idea of building
a committed political and social base. Self-reliance and
self-sufficiency were key themes--but weren't often discussed outside
the context of the civil-rights or black-power eras.</TE>
<TE>   "I was working on important books. I was engaged in this community
in Chicago," Kitwana says. "But I could see that our generation
wasn't involved. And I knew that we weren't reading those books."</TE>
<TE>   He wanted to organize his peers, and he realized that to do it,
he'd need a platform besides traditional publishing. His 1994 book
"The Rap on Gangsta Rap" (Third World Press) had opened a door to a
different audience, so he tugged at his connections. And after a
major reshuffling at the Source magazine--envisioned as hip-hop's
one-stop for the 411 on music and culture--he ended up first as
editorial director and eventually national affairs editor. Plain and
simple, "I wanted to bring politics to the Source."</TE>
<TE>   Rap Raises Issues</TE>
<TE>   Piece by piece, brick by brick, Kitwana was able to take on the
issues that rap so visibly raised: high suicide rates, police
brutality, censorship, self-hatred packaged as platinum hits.
Recording artists had been long been broadcasting first-person
reports from their streets on the crack wars, gangsta life and their
"creative" options for gettin' paid. Kitwana wanted to send reporters
out to fill in the picture and provide analysis--and look at the
problems nationwide and on a political level.</TE>
<TE>   But for him, ultimately, a larger more comprehensive look--a
book--seemed imperative, "A lot of the book is my personal journey,"
he admits, pausing over a plate of Salisbury seitan--a
"Southern-influenced" dish of wheat meat cutlets drizzled with
gravy--a nod to and compromise with his vegetarian lifestyle and his
Southern perch in Atlanta. What's pivotal to him, he says, is "how we
define the struggle in our own terms." While Kitwana makes clear
arguments about what has affected black youths over the last 20
years, from lockups to loitering laws, he doesn't simply enumerate
the issues on a continuous loop, he looks toward solutions.</TE>
<TE>   In the Political Arena</TE>
<TE>   Later in the evening, a small group, mostly men, gathers at EsoWon
Books not just to hear Kitwana discuss his book, but to talk about
their sons and daughters, their relationships with their brothers and
sisters. They're in dress shirts and ties or cargo pants and
T-shirts, divided evenly between hip-hop and civil rights
generations.</TE>
<TE>   Kitwana, who will catch a red-eye in a few hours, tells them of
what he's seen nationwide. Networks of youths working on issues from
education, employment and business development to health care and
prisons--all gathered in the name of hip-hop."</TE>
<TE>   But "we need a national organization with a national agenda," he
tells the group. "Oftentimes parents don't listen. The older
generations either didn't take us seriously or figured we were
apolitical. But part of the problem is you can't find us in any major
organization on a serious level--the NAACP, the Urban League--they
all have youth groups, but they are not seriously bringing us in. But
a lot of people aren't waiting for that," he assures the gathering,
unleashing that big laugh. "If you don't bring us to the table, well,
we might just take it."</TE>
<TE>   While Def Jam founder and rap mogul Russell Simmons and minister
Benjamin Muhammad (formerly the Rev. Ben Chavis, head of the NAACP),
have been making the news with the Hip Hop Summit Action Network,
rallying around education and censorship and bringing high-profile
rap into a political arena, Kitwana says, that's just a first step.
But, he notes, "Russell's 44 and Chavis is in his 60s. We still need
something that is ours."</TE>
<TE>   A new generation means a new way of doing things. And though
traditional resources might not be at hand, there are other ways to
become a lobbying force, dramatically influence elections and become
the urgent sound-bite on the evening news, he believes.</TE>
<TE>   "Hip-hop has created an infrastructure. The music itself won't
provide the revolutionary message. I used to want all the artists to
be like [conscious rapper] KRS-One, but I don't think that any more.
The artists themselves have become influential enough [in raw
numbers] to get people behind a campaign. We need to be looking at
those connected and tuned in enough to support our issues."</TE>
<TE>   He's looking not just at the Jay-Zs or Mos Defs, but at hip-hop
generation politicians like activist and educator Ras Baraka (who ran
for an at-large city council seat in Newark, N.J., in May but lost)
and Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.) Or the athletes--"The [Allen] Iversons
and [Shaquille] O'Neals instead of the [Michael] Jordans. And as
activism becomes more fashionable," Kitwana says, "the hip-hop
generation will be less dismissive of politics or the ... elders."</TE>
<TE>   For all the dispiriting statistics spelling out the fate of his
generation, Kitwana remains optimistic. "I believe in the capacity of
people," he says. "I got into a big argument with one of the Little
Rock Nine [the first group of African Americans to integrate Central
High School in 1957] about this. I said, if those who came of age in
the '60s can imagine a day when they can vote, we can certainly
imagine a day when we won't fill the prison system or get a better
education."</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, Kitwana says, "I know our kids will be looking at us
and wondering: Why didn't we get it together?"</TE>

monkey bars. I felt sad. She told me she was sorry. (Elise, 4)</LD>
<LD>   * This girl that goes to my school teases me bad. She called me
"grasshopper," "fat boy" and "Santa Claus." I really felt like
chasing her but I did not because I will get in trouble. (Anthony, 8)</LD>
<TE>   * My cousin said I was ugly. I felt sad. I told my mother.
(Autumn, 5)</TE>
<TE>   * I was drawing a picture and my cousin called me a "weenie." I
was mad so I drew another picture. (Jonathan, 5)</TE>
<TE>   * There are two girls who tease me. When they tease me they call
me "big head" and "ugly." Then I tell my teacher and mother. My mom
says they are just jealous. (Tequiles, 8)</TE>
<TE>   * My friend called me "stupid" when we were playing basketball. He
didn't say he was sorry. I didn't do anything but he doesn't come to
my house anymore. (Magus, 5)</TE>
<TE>   * My sister teases me and calls me stupid. I try to fight but I
get beat up. I feel sad. Next time I should tell my dad and not fight
my sister. (Racquel, 8)</TE>
<TE>   * My cousin called me a "tree head." Then he became nice and we
were cousins again. (Christiana, 5)</TE>
<TE>   * My brother teases and says he's going to show me how to do
tricks on my bike, but then he doesn't. I feel bad. I just walk away.
(Justin, 5)</TE>
<TE>   * Once my brother called me "baseball head." I got sad and went to
my room to play with my toys. My brother came and gave me a hug
because he loves me. (Shyea, 5)</TE>
<TE>   * I was playing with my cousin. She called me "shoe head." I told

<HD>In Napa, It's Still the Best of Times</HD>
<DH>'Teflon Valley' prospers despite Sept. 11, Enron and the
tech bust</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAWN HUBLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. HELENA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The sun was high by the time the live bidding started. Bottles had
long since been uncorked, and the crowd under the big white tent was
sweaty and loose. The spin was that the Napa Valley Wine Auction
might not be much of a party in this hard year.</LD>
<LD>   But no, here was Chuck McMinn, whose Cabernet was a hit even if
his telecom company had been out of bankruptcy for just six months.
And there was Orange County's David Doyle, who would spend $320,000
on one lot, though his software firm's stock was trading at about a
third of last year's share price.</LD>
<TE>   "We'll start the bidding at 10," the auctioneer was calling,
launching an event that would include dibs on dinner with Ted Olson,
the U.S. solicitor general whose famous wife, Barbara, was a Sept. 11
plane crash victim. "Do I hear $10,000, how about 20, 30, 40, we have
50, do I hear 70, 90, don't be afraid of six figures." In one corner,
a CEO and a venture capitalist were betting on how far this year's
auction proceeds would fall from last year's $7.6 million. (Less, as
it turned out, than either expected.) In another, a woman in stripes
was gamely repeating the oldest new-money joke in the valley: "How do
you make a small fortune in the wine business? Start with a large
fortune." Not everything has changed in the nine months since the
world supposedly changed forever. Here among the vineyards and
villas, the summer resolution seems to be: Don't let the terrorists
win.</TE>
<TE>   Each year--beginning in June, with its signature auction, and
ending in September, when the San Francisco Opera opens its
season--the Napa Valley becomes a sort of Bay Area social hub. For
the second-home owners and affluent summer people who have come to
form a sizable minority in the still-rural region, this has tended to
mean a party circuit so lavish that the place is regularly billed as
"the Hamptons of the West" in society pages. This year, however, not
even the Hamptons of the East has offered much respite from the
post-tech-bust, post-Sept. 11, post-Enron anxiety, and the
conventional wisdom here was that the wine country summer would,
likewise, be a bust.</TE>
<TE>   So much for conventional wisdom.</TE>
<TE>   As the mercury climbs, this place is looking more and more like
the Teflon Valley. "I have to say I don't see much difference--the
parties seem to be the same as ever," laughed John Traina, a Faberge
egg collector and former shipping executive who has spent summers and
weekends in Oakville for decades. In fact, the only regular event he
knows to have been canceled--or even downscaled--this year is his own
Fourth of July barbecue, where some 400 socialites and farmers
annually get together at his estate for line dancing. He's canceling,
he says, only because scheduling conflicts forced him to move up the
date of his annual trip to Europe with his children and Danielle
Steel, the romance novelist who is his ex-wife.</TE>
<TE>   Private parties are planned for Julia Child and Sophia Loren and
the Washington, D.C.-based architect Leo Daly. Wine country caterers
and chefs say their summer calendars have been solidly booked for
months. "Let's see," murmured Urannia Ristow, who shuttles between
San Francisco and her Ristow Estates vineyard in Napa. "I'll have my
dinner for my wine group in July and probably some other sort of wine
event, but it'll have to be in July too because August is just crazy,
it's the big month.... "</TE>
<TE>   "Life is short and fragile," explained Italian-born jet-setter
Maria Manetti Farrow, who says her sole concessions to the times have
been a decision to forgo wearing real jewelry on commercial airliners
and to make her usual nonstop entertaining schedule more intimate
this year at Villa Mille Rose, her 60-acre Tuscan-style summer home
in Oakville. "Yes, I am a businessperson, and we expected things
would turn around by now, but I am trying not to be upset. I would
rather enjoy deeply my friends."</TE>
<TE>   "I think all Americans are feeling, 'Use your good silver and
drink your good wine because you don't know what'll happen tomorrow,'
" said Traina's son, Trevor, an Internet company executive who also
has a house in the valley. "Also, to the extent that San Francisco is
a target city, you do feel safer [in the valley]--no dirty bombs up
there."</TE>
<TE>   The reluctance to go gently into social hibernation reflects
broader resilience in Napa County, which is farther than other
affluent retreats from scenes of the Sept. 11 attacks. It also has
been less directly buffeted by the tech slump than most of the Bay
Area. Its restaurants are bustling. Hotel occupancy, which has fallen
throughout the Bay Area, is expected to hold steady here this summer.
Unemployment--lower than at any spot in the Bay Area and less than
half the rate of Silicon Valley's Santa Clara County--was a mere 3.3%
at last count.</TE>
<TE>   Foreclosure notices, up all over the region, fell by 20% in Napa
County in April. The wine auction raked in $6.1 million for local
charities--less than last year but more than in 1999, which set that
decade's record. While San Jose's symphony orchestra, the oldest in
the West, was going belly-up this year for lack of funding, wine
country philanthropists were reopening the historic opera house in
the town of Napa and anteing up for the new state-of-the-art food and
wine museum, Copia. Economists attribute the valley's relative health
to the demand for retirement homes in the wine country among
equity-rich empty-nesters and to the county's reliance on sectors
other than high tech. "In the Bay Area, if you're not Silicon
Valley," said Stephen Levy of the Center for the Continuing Study of
the California Economy in Palo Alto, "you're looking good right now."</TE>
<TE>   Also influential, however, has been the presence of wealthy
part-time residents who have long treated the valley as a second
hometown. The 22-year-old wine auction, for example, was co-founded
by the then-wife of a philanthropist whose main residence was in San
Francisco. Today the auction is a key charity source, especially for
local health care nonprofits. "The place just gets under your skin,"
explained Pat Montandon, now 73, who devised the auction with vintner
Robert Mondavi.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, as this year's event got underway, Montandon said, she
was shopping for real estate in Napa Valley--a tidbit that locals
relished as a coda to the public divorce that drove her from the wine
country shortly before the first auction. (In the claustrophobic
world of San Francisco society, Montandon is known as the third wife
of the now-deceased businessman Alfred S. Wilsey, who--follow closely
now--wed her after the annulment of her marriage to the lawyer Melvin
Belli and later divorced her to marry Dede Dow Traina, who is now the
president of the San Francisco Fine Arts Museums and who was then the
wife of Oakville's John Traina, who then went on to wed Danielle
Steel.) Such lore--"so very Falcon Crest," as one socialite jokingly
put it--has helped make the valley more than just a place for its
investors to park capital in a bear market. "We're like Palm Springs
or Saratoga," laughed Napa County Assessor John Tuteur, who first
came to the county some 50 years ago when his own father bought a
summer home.</TE>
<TE>   About one property in five, officials say, is owned by people
whose primary residence is elsewhere, and about half of those second
homes belong to owners from San Francisco and Silicon Valley. Tuteur
says that about half are owned by "Old Napa" families, as longtime
property owners like to call themselves, and most of the rest were
bought in the go-go 1990s. The result is an old-money/new-money
demographic that is both financially buffered against the world's
problems and emotionally vested in maintaining the valley as a
Shangri-La apart from them.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's political and economic problems, however, weren't far
outside the tent as the summer unofficially opened here in this
month. At the auction, McMinn, chairman of Covad Communications
Corp., suggested that "after the events of 9/11, I think people will
bid more generously--or they should, anyway." He successfully bid
$100,000 for the dinner with Ted Olson at Pillar Rock Winery.</TE>
<TE>   Across the room, high rollers fondly recalled the record-busting
2000 auction, when the economy sent bids into the stratosphere.
"Honey, this is cheap compared to two years ago," chuckled Yvonne
Adams, wife of Louisiana oilman R.A. "Ray" Adams, upon spending
$300,000 for nine bottles of Harlan Estate Cabernet Sauvignon. "We
spent, what--$700,000, I think--two years ago." As the afternoon wore
on, however, talk focused on safer topics, such as the scandalous
screw-top caps being used instead of corks on $140 bottles of wine by
the Plumpjack winery, which is owned by one of the heirs to the Getty
fortune. And the last race of the Triple Crown, being run the same
day as the auction. And McMinn's new 14,000-square-foot wine cave.
And Pamela and Richard Kramlich's local work in progress--a massive,
glassy home-museum designed for the venture capitalist and his wife
by the architects Herzog &amp; deMeuron to showcase their media art
collection.</TE>
<TE>   At one table, talk centered on whether Norah Stone--whose husband
is the son of W. Clement Stone, the Chicago insurance magnate--would
be throwing the opulent birthday bash that gets her Azalea Springs
vineyards into the society pages each year. She will.</TE>
<TE>   "We're having a surrealist theme," she confirmed, adding that
she'd only briefly considered canceling but decided against it.
"Somehow a surreal party just seemed appropriate this year."</TE>

<HD>To Boldly Go, Someday</HD>
<DH>Toy inventor Brian Walker is still tinkering on his dream:
to take his homemade rocket for a spin in the stratosphere</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. MICHAEL KENNEDY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Rocket Guy is way behind schedule.</LD>
<LD>   If things had worked out as planned, he'd already be the first
person to single-handedly launch himself into the stratosphere. He'd
be making the talk-show rounds, telling audiences about how this
slightly wacky toy inventor took a childhood dream and made it a
reality. He'd be bragging about how he boosted himself 30 miles
straight up in a rocket he made in his home workshop.</LD>
<LD>   Or, perhaps he might be dead. Rocketry, after all, is fraught with
peril.</LD>
<TE>   But being behind schedule doesn't seem to bother Brian Walker,
a.k.a. Rocket Guy, because what's the rush? Just saying he's planning
to blast off has made him something of a cult figure and talk-show
regular anyway.</TE>
<TE>   He's appeared on "I've Got a Secret" and "To Tell the Truth." His
Web site counter has chalked up more than 14 million hits in the last
two years. He's even picked an appropriate theme song: Kirby
Swatosh's "Spaceship." The opening line is "I'm building a spaceship
in my backyard." Walker has dubbed that backyard the "rocket garden."</TE>
<TE>   All this without having yet built the rocket that will take him
into space. In fairness, the 45-year-old Rocket Guy has been slowed
by all the media attention. And he's been very distracted of late,
given the fact that his bride-to-be--the one he found on the
Internet--is due to arrive from Moscow late next month.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, he'll work on the launch details. When it's completed
he'll tow his 24-foot rocket to the launch site--wherever that ends
up being--with a Mercedes sport utility vehicle. He's built a sizable
geodesic dome where he will assemble the big one that will carry him
into space. When he builds it, and he swears he's going to, the
rocket will have a main engine with 12,000 pounds of thrust and weigh
about 10,000 pounds when fully fueled and manned. Another outbuilding
on his central Oregon compound contains an all-but-complete
half-scale test rocket as well as a spacious office. Another still
holds the equipment he will use to purify his rocket fuel. That will
be hydrogen peroxide. As in the stuff used to sterilize cuts. But in
purified form it is a powerful propellant that was used to send
German V2 rockets toward Britain during World War II. It will also
burst into flames if it touches anything organic.</TE>
<TE>   Burned Through $350,000</TE>
<TE>   This has not been a cheap undertaking, though chump change
compared to the $20-odd million paid by American Dennis Tito and
South African Mark Shuttleworth for their space rides with the
Russians. Walker figures he's burned through $350,000 during the last
two years without so much as a test rocket leaving the Earth.</TE>
<TE>   He's been to Russia for cosmonaut training and purchased a
spacesuit from them for a bargain-basement $15,000. (He couldn't even
get American manufacturers to talk to him.) He's built a centrifuge,
powered by a small airplane engine, in his backyard so he can
experience the G-force of a space launch. He's spent months welding,
soldering and building molds and learning about rocketry on the fly.
And he has lovingly built the test rocket, down to the engine that
will theoretically power him to an altitude of 15,000 feet. From
there, he will skydive back to Earth. If all goes well, that is.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm building a dream," says a somewhat beefy, bearded Walker.
"And that's what made this country great."</TE>
<TE>   All of this would not be possible, of course, without the toys.
Walker has invented dozens of toys over the years--things like
air-powered bazookas and laser gizmos and things that whirl around
and glow in the dark. The royalties from the toy sales have provided
a nice financial cushion--in the million-plus range--that allows
Walker to pursue the rocket dreams he's had since he was a boy
growing up in Portland.</TE>
<TE>   But life was not always so kind to Rocket Guy, a dyslexic with
attention deficit disorder who squeaked his way through high school
and dropped out of college. A series of dead-end jobs followed, even
as he pursued his dream of being an inventor.</TE>
<TE>   Early creations included a hovercraft, its only flaw being that it
was hard to turn. There was the collapsible stretcher that evoked
virtually no interest from its logical buyer, the military. And then
there was the year and a half he spent on a remote Fijian island
building a recreational two-person submarine. The only problem with
that was that once submerged, it tended not to surface. With that
kind of track record, Walker's inventive future looked bleak, indeed.</TE>
<TE>   "My failures were so great, I had to move back in with my folks
and start all over again," he says over dinner at a local eatery.
"People looked at me as someone who couldn't make it."</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, Walker switched his sites from big, ambitious projects to
the smaller world of toys, a place where manufacturers are always
looking for the next gimmick. And it was here that he found his
calling. In 1994, Walker licensed his first toy, a laser light that
was an instant success and was produced in three different
versions--the Mini Laser Light, the Triple Beam Laser Light and the
Starship version. Next came the Alien Orbiter, a "lung"-powered
gyroscope. Suddenly, Walker had positive cash flow. Six years ago he
bought the log cabin in Bend, along with 13 acres of land, and began
creating his own little utopia that he calls Brian's World.</TE>
<TE>   It's at the end of a road dotted with spacious homes and
evergreens, an isolated space where his only contacts with neighbors
are when he chooses to have them--and that is not often. Here, he
drinks coffee until noon as he fiddles with some new toy or rocket
project. He usually runs into town for lunch and dinner, never having
learned the ways of the kitchen. He has a string of restaurants where
the hostesses and the barkeeps know him by name.</TE>
<TE>   In the early summer of 2000, Walker announced his intent to build
a rocket that would carry him into space by the fall of 2001. Not
into orbit, but straight up to Earth's outer atmosphere before
returning via parachute.</TE>
<TE>   The first newspaper story about him ran in the Portland Oregonian,
and Walker admits he was looking for a little publicity at the time.
But he says he never dreamed the swarm of media requests would be so
overwhelming, that and the thousands of e-mails that have come his
way from all parts of the world. He's tried to answer each one.</TE>
<TE>   John Barr of Scotland, in an e-mail declares Walker's idea to be
brilliant: "It's people like you we need with the vision to challenge
preconceptions about space being the domain of national governments.
You're right, space belongs to ordinary people too."</TE>
<TE>   Then there's this from a woman named Lisa: "If I weren't married
to a nutty inventor type already, I'd be high-tailing it to Bend
right now."</TE>
<TE>   But Walker is already spoken for by Natasha Astankina, whom he
found on an online service called A Foreign Affair. He spotted her
after reviewing thousands of online resumes of Russian women hoping
to attract interest from American men.</TE>
<TE>   "When I saw her, I knew she was the one," Walker says of their
first meeting in Moscow. They needed a translator for that date, but
they had already covered a lot of ground in the 1,000 or so e-mails
they had exchanged. Astankina used a computer program to crudely
translate Russian into English for those early contacts. She will be
bringing her 8-year-old son, Sergey, with her. In anticipation of the
boy's arrival, Walker has installed an aboveground swimming pool just
outside the house.</TE>
<TE>   Walker leads the way around his compound, first cranking up the
centrifuge, then setting it in motion by remote control. Next, he
demonstrates the model of what will be the nosecone of his Rocket Guy
rocket, where he will install himself for the flight. As the plan is
supposed to work, the rockets will provide enough boost to get him
into space, where he will experience a few seconds of weightlessness
before beginning his descent. By then, the main rocket will have
disengaged, leaving only the manned nosecone equipped with
parachutes. His preferred launch site at the moment is the sparsely
populated northern Nevada desert.</TE>
<TE>   A Sore Point With Fiancee</TE>
<TE>   And what does his bride-to-be think of all this rocketry? It's one
of the few sore spots in the relationship. Astankina says she sent
Walker an e-mail in which she asked him not to launch himself. After
a long delay, Walker wrote back that the project was his "baby" and
that he intended to proceed.</TE>
<TE>   "It is his dream of all his life," says Astankina by e-mail. "He
is going to do this."</TE>
<TE>   Officialdom, meanwhile, is watching from the wings. Walker met
earlier this month with a group from the Federal Aviation
Administration, which must clear the airspace for the launch. Walker
says they mostly listened to his presentation. More important, they
didn't dismiss him as a kook.</TE>
<TE>   "They treated me with absolute respect," he says. "They didn't
think I was a crackpot."</TE>
<TE>   And what of NASA, the American space agency that has launched
every manned U.S. rocket?</TE>
<TE>   Spokesman John Petty has a vague recollection of hearing about
Walker, but that's all.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, we hope anyone who does this sort of thing does it
safely and doesn't come to any harm," he says.</TE>
<TE>   As for Walker, he thinks an unmanned test flight might be possible
in the fall. The coming of his new family has made him perhaps
slightly more cautious about the manned flight. After all, he says,
he doesn't want to do anything that will leave his bride a young
widow. Still, he doesn't want to delay so long that he's tagged as
all talk and no action. Rocket Guy says he wants to do what he's
promised and move on. His bottom line: "I want to get it over with."</TE>

<CX>   Rocket fuel--A story about an Oregon man building his own rocket in
Sunday's Southern California Living incorrectly implied that purified
hydrogen peroxide was the key propellant used to send German V2
rockets toward Britain during World War II. Hydrogen peroxide powered
the turbines within the V2 rocket, which was fueled primarily by an
ethyl alcohol mixture and liquid oxygen.</CX>

<LD>There were 600 guests and a sweeping list of honorees -- 25
individuals, nine films and New York City's firefighters--at the
Vision Awards benefit for Retinitis Pigmentosa International.</LD>
<LD>   The list of honorees was so long that most of the
self-extinguishing candles had self-extinguished before the last
thank-you speech was delivered.</LD>
<LD>   "These people are the artists, dream-makers, teachers and
mentors," said host Army Archerd when introducing the honorees.</LD>
<TE>   Among those singled out were Dr. Mark Humayan, Dr. Vincent Chow
and Alan Chow, three pioneers in seeking a cure for retinal
blindness. The event, "Hollywood Cures Blindness," raised $450,000.</TE>
<TE>   Established in 1973 by artist Helen Harris to fund research and
treatment for degenerative eye diseases, the awards recognize
individuals and companies who have demonstrated significant "sight,
foresight and insight" in the creative arts, technology and medical
research.</TE>
<TE>   Representing the NYFD was firefighter Dan Rowan, who received a
standing ovation. Last fall, Rowan and fellow firefighters from
Engine Company 33, Ladder 9, took a cross-country bike ride in honor
of their 10 comrades who died Sept. 11. Harris presented him with an
original painting--which was reproduced on the evening's program--to
be hung in the firehouse.</TE>
<TE>   John Beard chaired the June 22 event at Regent Beverly Wilshire,
which included silent and live auctions. Among items on the block was
a Shaquille O'Neal autographed game shoe, which sold for $7,000.</TE>
<TE>   Among guests were Muhammad Ali, Don Knotts, Bonnie Bedelia, Robin
Tunney, Hayden Christensen and Ed O'Ross.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie Mills, David Pomerantz and Kelli and Camille Rudisill
headlined the entertainment along with Les Brown's Band of Renown.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who turned out to accept their plaudits in person were
Ahmet Ertegun, Howard Bingham, Hans Zimmer, Joel Gallen, Graham King,
Nina Jacobson, Karen Kehela, Josh Lieberman, Robin Cook, Dawn
Tarnofsky-Ostroff, Mindy Herman, Akiva Goldsman, J.T. Battenburg III.</TE>
<TE>   Presenters included Burt Bacharach, Colin Farrell, Jon Voight,
Jeffrey Katzenberg, Kevin James, Nancy Josephson, Mario Machado,
Steve Kmetko, Joanne Horowitz and Gary Valentine.</TE>

<TE>   Music Academy</TE>
<TE>   Opera legend Marilyn Horne, the durable diva Opera News once named
"the greatest singer in the world," is still going strong as director
of vocal music at one of her alma maters, the Music Academy of the
West.</TE>
<TE>   When she's not teaching at the Santa Barbara summer school and
festival, where she occupies the 2002 Flora L. Thornton Chair in
Voice, she's barnstorming concert halls and music festivals across
the country singing the works of Berlin, Porter and Gershwin. In late
July, she's slated for the Ravinia festival in Chicago and the
Brevard festival in North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   "I abandoned the classics two years ago because I can't do them
the way I used to," said Horne, 68, who was guest of honor at a
musical evening at Amanda and Nick Stonnington's San Marino home last
week. "Coming to the academy was kismet," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It brought me back home to California and to my family. I had
done very little teaching and I didn't trust myself quite yet as a
teacher, but I fell in love with it, and next week, 134 of the most
talented musicians in the world will arrive and they will leave
sounding a whole lot better. It's an exciting process for all of us."</TE>
<TE>   No one was asked to break out a checkbook at this affair, which
featured an elegant "Taste of Santa Barbara" candlelight dinner
served on the Stonnington's terrace and a performance by academy
alums Guang Yang and Marcus DeLoach, accompanied by pianist John
Churchwell.</TE>
<TE>   The raison d'etre was simply to encourage Angelenos to spread the
word about the Academy festival, a series of picnic concerts, one-act
operas and daily master classes (open to the public) continuing
through Aug. 17.</TE>
<TE>   In the party mix were academy president David L. Kuehn and his
wife, Susan, Carole and Steve Halsted, Betty and Richard Koshalek,
Anne and Peter Hunt, British consul general in Los Angeles; Andrea
Van de Kamp, Helen and Jerry Stathatos, Viscount Paul Ridley-Tree and
his wife, Leslie; Jenijoy LaBelle and Warren Dennis, Noelle

<TE>   Easy Money</TE>
<TE>   Roaring through Orange County, 550 bikers participated in the
annual "Ride the Coast &amp; Concert" benefit for the Boys &amp; Girls Club
of Santa Ana. Led by members of the Santa Ana Police Department, the
easy riders traversed 90 miles of bustling coastal highways and
peaceful canyon roads before parking their hogs at the Galaxy
Theatre, where they joined club supporters for a barbecue and a
pounding performance by veteran rocker Eddie Money.</TE>
<TE>   "This is great--we get to help kids while we enjoy the freedom of
the open road," said Bob Moschorak of Orange, owner of a 2001
Electric Glide Classic Harley.</TE>
<TE>   The event raised $75,000 for the club, which provides after-school
programs to 4,500 of the 26,000 kids ages 6 and 18 who live within
one mile of its facility on Highland Street.</TE>
<TE>   "The area has the highest concentration of youth on the West Coast
and the second highest in the country," said spokeswoman Cindy
Brewster. The median family income: less than $12,000 per year, she
said. "Our goal is to serve as many of these kids as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Guests at the June 23 event included 12-year-old Jose Espinoza,
winner of the club's Youth of the Year Award. If not for the club, he
might spend his after-school hours at a local park.</TE>
<TE>   "But it wouldn't be as much fun," he said. "At the club, I get to
learn new things and help the other kids."</TE>
<TE>   For teen program director Jesus Salgado, the facility is about
"giving kids options besides the streets," he said. "We do everything
we can."</TE>

<LD>"Hey, Madison," Jeremy called as we went into our third-grade
classroom. "Wanna come over on Saturday and see the popcorn tree in
our backyard?"</LD>
<LD>   "A popcorn tree? In your backyard? You can just pick it right
off?"</LD>
<LD>   Jeremy grinned and nodded. I wondered if it would have butter and
salt on it, too.</LD>
<TE>   I thought about that popcorn tree all day.</TE>
<TE>   "What are you daydreaming about?" Mom asked.</TE>
<TE>   "The popcorn tree in Jeremy's backyard. I'm going to see it
tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, Madison, Jeremy is playing games with you," Mom said.
"Popcorn doesn't grow on trees."</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I believe him," I said, "and I can hardly wait!"</TE>
<TE>   That night I dreamed about picking hot, crunchy popcorn right off
a tree and stuffing it in my mouth.</TE>
<TE>   First thing Saturday morning I dashed across the street. Sure
enough, the tree had big white puffs on all the branches. Jeremy was
right. Popcorn did grow on trees!</TE>
<TE>   I reached out to grab some.</TE>
<TE>   "You tricked me, Jeremy!" I cried. "This isn't popcorn. It's
flowers!"</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry, I guess." Jeremy was laughing. "But it was a good
joke, don't you think? The blossoms really do look like popcorn."</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, they do, but ... "</TE>
<TE>   "My mom said," Jeremy interrupted, "that in a couple of months the
blossoms will turn into something else good to eat. They'll be
apricots!"</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy's mom came out of the house with a big bowl in her arms.</TE>
<TE>   "You shouldn't have fooled Madison," she said. "Here, have some
real popcorn."</TE>
<TE>   We sat on the grass and munched the popcorn. I didn't say anything
for a while, but finally I grinned at Jeremy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's OK," I said. "I guess I should have known popcorn couldn't
really grow on a tree. And those apricots sure will taste good, too!"</TE>

<HD>No Reason to Shelve the Dog-Mauling Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

College of the Law. Akhil Reed Amar is professor of law at Yale Law
School.</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Is the Marjorie Knoller dog-mauling case over?</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge James Warren recently let stand the jury's
involuntary manslaughter conviction of Knoller in the dog-mauling
death of her neighbor, Diane Whipple, in January 2001. But he threw
out the jury's decision to convict Knoller of second-degree murder.
Neither ruling is likely to be reversed on appeal.</LD>
<LD>   The magnitude of Warren's decision depends upon whether and how
Knoller can be retried on the murder charge. On its face, the judge's
ruling simply granted a new trial on the murder count. But many
commentators--even the prosecutors themselves--immediately began
hinting that the game was over because of a constitutional principle
known as double jeopardy.</LD>
<TE>   Properly construed, double jeopardy does not bar retrying Knoller
for murder. But some ill-reasoned judicial language from the
California Supreme Court misinterpreting state statutes may
nevertheless foreclose her retrial. If so, the legitimacy of Warren's
decision declines, and the rules giving him the power to make such a
decision should be rethought.</TE>
<TE>   The 5th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution says that no person
shall "be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of
life or limb." The California Constitution contains similar language.
The word "jeopardy" comes from the French "jeuperdre"--a "game" that
one might "lose." The big idea here is simple enough: For any given
offense, the government may play the adjudication game only once.</TE>
<TE>   If the defendant wins fair and square, the government cannot
simply ignore this verdict and retry him. Conversely, if the
government wins fair and square, it may punish the defendant only
once for the crime. Whether the government wins or loses, however, it
is entitled to play the game to the end. If the trial is called off
before its completion and resumed later (like a baseball game delayed
by rain), then the resumption is not a second jeopardy but simply a
continuation of the first.</TE>
<TE>   In the Knoller case, then, the question is, did the murder charge
reach a final conclusion?</TE>
<TE>   No. Had the jury voted Knoller not guilty of murder, the murder
game would indeed be over. Once the jury acquits, that's that. So
too, typically, if a trial judge acquits. Had Warren dismissed the
murder charge against Knoller on the ground that there was simply not
enough evidence for a reasonable jury to find Knoller acted with the
state of mind required for murder, the murder game would have been
over.</TE>
<TE>   But Warren's decision to grant a new trial was not an acquittal.
He merely said that he personally didn't find the evidence of guilt
sufficient. In other words, had he been a juror, he would have voted
to acquit.</TE>
<TE>   Under California law, that is all it takes to throw out the jury's
verdict and grant a new trial. In effect, the judge is authorized to
act as a "13th juror" and grant a new trial if he personally would
have voted to acquit and believes justice would be served by a new
trial on a clean slate. Such sweeping power is given to judges in
California as a special safeguard to ensure that defendants are not
erroneously convicted and punished.</TE>
<TE>   But--and this is key--a grant of a new trial because the judge
isn't convinced of guilt is not an acquittal. It does not end the
first jeopardy game; it merely continues it.</TE>
<TE>   Jeopardy clearly ended on the involuntary manslaughter charge
because Warren let that conviction stand. But this should not prevent
the government from playing out the murder charge because the
manslaughter and murder charges are not, to use the 5th Amendment's
words, the "same offense." Manslaughter and murder are related
crimes. But the rules, known as elements, to determine manslaughter
are different from those of murder. In particular, murder requires an
additional element (proof of intent by the defendant) that is not
required under manslaughter. Manslaughter, it is said, is a "lesser-
included" offense within murder. And the maximum punishment for
manslaughter is only four years, while for second-degree murder it is
15 years to life.</TE>
<TE>   Although courts have often been careless in their language, there
is no absolute double-jeopardy bar to trying someone on an offense
merely because he has already been convicted on a lesser-included
offense arising out of the same incident. The two offenses are
distinct, and as long as the prosecutor has a good reason for
splitting them into two separate trials, there should be no
constitutional problem.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, according to long-standing U.S. Supreme Court doctrine, a
defendant already convicted and serving time for attempted murder can
properly be tried again--for murder--if the crime victim dies of his
wounds after the first trial ends. So too in the Knoller case, the
prosecutor has a good reason for breaking up the murder and
manslaughter offenses into two trials--namely, the fact that Warren
granted the new trial motion.</TE>
<TE>   But would it be fair for the government, should it prevail on the
murder charge, to claim two victories against Knoller--to chalk up
two in the win column--and get two cumulative sentences imposed upon
her?</TE>
<TE>   No, and the U.S. Supreme Court has said as much. But as long as
the manslaughter conviction and sentence are erased in the event of a
murder conviction and sentence, double-jeopardy principles are
satisfied.</TE>
<TE>   All this makes good sense and is completely consistent with the
federal and California constitutions. The California Supreme Court,
however, in a 1996 case, read a California statute as flatly barring
a retrial on a greater offense whenever there is already a conviction
on a lesser-included one. In that case, a jury convicted a defendant
of vehicular manslaughter but could not reach unanimity on the
greater offense of gross vehicular manslaughter, which requires an
additional element. After a hung-jury mistrial was declared on the
greater charge, the state Supreme Court said that retrial was barred
under a state statute because of the conviction on the
lesser-included offense.</TE>
<TE>   Although this result and the reasoning supporting it are
outlandish, the case might be technically distinguishable from
Knoller's situation: The first jury in her case, after all, did not
hang on the murder count but reached a consensus of guilt.</TE>
<TE>   But if California courts construe state law to bar Knoller's
second murder trial, that means Warren's grant of a new trial will be
treated as an acquittal even though it failed to meet the proper
legal standards for acquittal. In effect, the judge becomes much more
than a 13th juror with one voice out of 13; instead, he transforms
himself into a jury of one, who single-handedly can decide innocence
even if reasonable jurors could and did come out the other way.</TE>
<TE>   Yogi Berra once said, "It ain't over till it's over." But in
California, judicial misinterpretation may well mean that it's over
even though it shouldn't be.</TE>

<BD>Milt Bearden was CIA chief in Pakistan from 1986 to '89
and was responsible for the covert assistance to the Afghan
moujahedeen in their fight against the Soviet Union. He is the author
of "The Black Tulip," a novel of war in Afghanistan.</BD>
<DL>RESTON, Va.</DL>
<LD>As we approach the nation's first Fourth of July celebration since
the Sept. 11 tragedy, a recent CNN-Time magazine poll shows that many
Americans believe that terrorists will strike somewhere in the United
States on Independence Day.</LD>
<LD>   Beyond that, the public hasn't a clue about the specifics of the
threat; nor do many bother to know the color-coded threat level of
the day. This is not because Americans are uninterested in the war on
terrorism--the opposite is markedly true. It is because they are
utterly confused by endless, plainly incomprehensible government
alerts or cannot incorporate into their lives conflicting information
slickly packaged by a new crop of dubious "terrorism experts" in the
broadcast media.</LD>
<LD>   Increasingly, the public suspects that the warnings are being
issued by a government more driven by self-protection than by the
security of its citizens, as each new warning is conditioned by the
tortured construct "out of an abundance of caution." Today's threat
level is, by the way, yellow, which means "elevated," which means
that "there is a significant risk of terrorist attacks."</LD>
<TE>   That can't be good enough.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the confusion can be linked to the difficulties of
interrogating 500 or so detainees now in U.S. or allied custody.
Getting the truth out of committed terrorist insiders is difficult
enough, often impossible. In the case of Ramzi Yousef, the convicted
mastermind behind the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center, U.S.
authorities learned nothing beyond the ominous warning that the job
on the twin towers would one day be finished. Zacarias Moussaoui, the
indicted "20th hijacker" suspect now facing trial in connection with
the Sept. 11 attacks, has, similarly, given up nothing of value. Both
men were in total isolation and under the complete control of U.S.
authorities for months (Moussaoui) and even years (Yousef).</TE>
<TE>   But getting the truth out of the current crop of detainees in U.S.
custody presents another, in some ways more troublesome, challenge.
Few of the men we hold in Afghanistan or at Guantanamo Bay are known
quantities, genuine insiders with the crucial information we need to
prevent another outrage. Yet they all have been exposed to enough of
the Al Qaeda lore to keep us at an elevated state of alert. The
detainees' common "cover story" is a composite based on their rote
memorization of the Islamic Jihad encyclopedia and training manual,
liberally sprinkled with scuttlebutt from Al Qaeda training camps in
Afghanistan. The training manual, it seems, is the likely source of
most of the threat alerts keeping the nation on edge.</TE>
<TE>   A 5,000-page handbook that runs from dangerous (cut-and-pasted
U.S. Army training manuals) to silly (wildly errant instructions on
how to make a nuclear fusion device), the training manual has been
found on compact discs and in printouts in dozens of Al Qaeda safe
houses in Afghanistan. It was apparently left lying about as sort of
a Gideon's Bible of terror. It contains most of the target
information central to the alerts of the last several months,
including nuclear, gas and electric power plants, bridges, dams,
airports, railroads, skyscrapers, the U.S. Capitol, football
stadiums, apartment buildings and banks.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. intelligence has had the manual for about five years and has
known it recommends skyscrapers, nuclear plants and crowded football
stadiums as the best targets for spreading fear. The handbook also
lists targets of "sentimental value"--the Statue of Liberty, Big Ben
in London and the Eiffel Tower in Paris, for example--as well as
advising attacks on major public gatherings such as Christmas and
Fourth of July celebrations.</TE>
<TE>   Those who interrogate the men held in Pakistan, Guantanamo Bay or
other locations and then process the intelligence--and who ultimately
issue the warnings--must always be concerned that they may be simply
recycling and reconfirming the threats contained in the manual.</TE>
<TE>   When, in Pakistan, alleged Al Qaeda kingpin Abu Zubaydah speaks of
plots to attack the Statue of Liberty, another detainee at Guantanamo
Bay or in Morocco admitting he knew something about such a plan
cannot automatically be taken as a confirmation. Even an abundance of
caution need not lead to calling the nation to general quarters every
time a few detainees say the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   Another problem involves contamination. In the cases of the
prisoners from Afghanistan and Pakistan, their first experiences with
hostile interrogation will have been at the hands of the U.S.
military. They would have been aggressively questioned on the
locations of key Taliban or Al Qaeda personalities and on threats
against U.S. forces.</TE>
<TE>   The interrogators probably lacked a genuinely deep familiarity
with the cultures and settings of the prisoners, who almost always
answered through interpreters. By the time the detainees were sent to
Guantanamo Bay, they understood the strengths and weaknesses of their
interrogators and their interpreters, and many would already know
what information could be given up without opening themselves to
reprisals. As a result, there seem to have been repeated
"confirmations" of much of the information we already knew years ago
in the Islamic Jihad training manual.</TE>
<TE>   Are we being duped or is this just the nature of the challenge? It
is probably a bit of both, and we have to get a grip on it.</TE>
<TE>   In 30 years in the CIA's Operations Directorate, I can count on
both hands the number of men and women I would consider true experts
in the art of interrogation, a handful of Americans and a few from
friendly intelligence services. In every case where I saw a genuine
breakthrough in a terrorism interrogation, it came after months of
patient probing, mind games and manipulation. Invariably it involved
a completely isolated detainee who ultimately bonded with his
interrogator.</TE>
<TE>   One such interrogation by an intelligence service in a friendly
country took months of patient "reality adjustment." The terrorist, a
man captured at the scene of a terrorist act, and whose guilt was
never in question, was held in total isolation. Over the months, his
interrogator gradually fed him bits and pieces of fabricated
newspaper accounts that rewrote the history of the months since he
had been captured. The detainee was never openly confronted with the
newspapers; instead, he was allowed to catch a furtive glimpse of
them every couple of days while the interrogator's file lay
"carelessly" open across the table.</TE>
<TE>   Gradually, however, the terrorist developed a totally contrived
picture of his world. The first faked news clips told of U.S.
military strikes against his homeland. Then the dictator to whom the
detainee had sworn allegiance went missing, then he was reported
gravely wounded. Finally, the detainee's personal idol was reported
dead from his wounds. The terrorist's world collapsed, and he turned
to the only human being left in his new world, his interrogator. He
calmly told him the whole story.</TE>
<TE>   The process took a year.</TE>
<TE>   We will have to be patient. To counter the confusion, we need a
national dialogue on the war against terrorism, one that will include
a candid discussion of what is known, what is not known and what may
never be known about our enemy. Part of the dialogue must be what
should be shared with the public, when and why, and what should not
be shared and why not.</TE>
<TE>   To carry this off, we need a reliable interlocutor, a Rudolph W.
Giuliani-type national figure, who would speak clearly on the nature
of the enemy and of the threat and who would be believed when he
spoke. This terrorist threat against America is real. It will be with
us for a while, but if we settle down and get control of the
challenge, we'll beat it back.</TE>

<AU>BEI LING</AU>
<BD>Bei Ling is a poet and editor of the literary journal
Tendency.</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>For years now, I have begun each return trip to my homeland at the
Luohu customs stop on the border of Hong Kong and Shenzhen. This
year, on the hot, muggy evening of June 6, I made that trip again,
walking out of Hong Kong toward the "new" Chinese city of Shenzhen
over a crude, sturdy bridge about 100 meters long.</LD>
<LD>   It can seem as if Hong Kong is being slowly, gently assimilated by
its huge neighbor, as if Hong Kong has already fully returned to
China. Mandarin-speaking visitors from the mainland fill the streets
now. Mandarin instructors are in heavy demand among
Cantonese-speaking Hong Kong businessmen wishing to learn the
state-endorsed dialect. A department store is named Sanlitun, after a
small corner of Beijing that attracts foreign visitors; a restaurant,
Dongfang Hong, is named after a well-known mainland patriotic song
once sung to welcome Mao Tse-tung.</LD>
<LD>   Yet this huge city full of the vestiges of colonialism still has
hold of the most precious legacies bequeathed by British rule:
freedom of speech, media and publishing, and a highly efficient,
largely democratic legal system. On the bridge, I was acutely aware
of these legacies.</LD>
<TE>   But I wanted to go home, to cross the border peacefully like
everyone else. I wanted to walk the busy streets of China and see
China's people again. A friend would pick me up and take me to
Shenzhen University, where I once taught--now more than 13 years ago.
I would walk those familiar streets, buy books, then head to Material
Life, a book bar, to spend the evening immersed in the wisdom and wit
of Shenzhen's poets and writers.</TE>
<TE>   I first left China in the late 1980s to attend a Beijing-New York
sister city exhibition. A few months later, while I was still in the
United States, the student movement that culminated in Tiananmen
Square on June 4, 1989, began. Students' calls for democratic change
ended in bloodshed on the streets of Beijing. Because I was one of 10
signatories to a letter sent to the Chinese government in support of
the students, I lost my teaching position at Shenzhen University. I
could not return to live in my homeland.</TE>
<TE>   During visits to China in subsequent years, I was followed and
harassed. In 1997, I was taken into custody for 36 hours to prevent
my attending an event commemorating Tiananmen Square. In August 2000,
things grew worse. That summer I was arrested and ultimately exiled.</TE>
<TE>   My decision to try to visit China this summer was risky. As soon
as I reached the other end of the Luohu Bridge and saw the sign
welcoming me (or at least some travelers) to mainland China, my heart
tightened. It was on a similarly hot summer evening 21 months earlier
that I was forced into a car in Beijing and whisked away by four
gruff undercover policemen. They didn't even give me the chance to
take a breath or grab a toothbrush. Instead they took me to prison,
where I sat for 14 days.</TE>
<TE>   I was accused of "illegal publishing," a crime for which I could
have been sentenced to 10 years in prison. It's true that my literary
journal Tendency had been printed in China that summer. For years, I
had published it in the United States, although it is written in
Chinese and most of its readers are from China. For financial reasons
and to test rumors that China was loosening a bit I decided to have
an issue printed in Beijing. But I quickly learned there was still no
freedom to publish in China.</TE>
<TE>   I was one of 20 arrestees--including accused rapists, murderers
and thieves--who lived in a space of 400 to 500 square feet. We ate
and slept within inches of a single, shared toilet. Prison gang
members randomly doled out physical punishment to the weaker
prisoners. The water was always cold; we lived on cabbage and steamed
bread.</TE>
<TE>   After 15 days, with the help of supporters and writers, including
Susan Sontag and the U.S. Congress, I was freed, expelled from China
and put on a plane bound for the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   It was perhaps foolish to return this year--particularly under the
circumstances. In Hong Kong days earlier, I had read a poem
commemorating the victims of Tiananmen Square at a gathering attended
by 45,000 people. The poem and my picture appeared in the next day's
newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   But the longing for home is never easily cured. I wanted to talk
about literature in Chinese over a pot of tea or a glass of beer. I
wanted to ride a bicycle through crowded alleyways and look up every
so often at the blue sky of Beijing. I wanted to spend hours browsing
Chinese bookstores, to be surrounded by Chinese books. I wanted to
hear the sounds of home.</TE>
<TE>   When the border agent saw the name on my passport, he asked me to
wait. Soon, I was taken to the Chinese border patrol officers'
lounge. I was told that I would probably not be allowed to enter
China. My luggage was taken from me, opened and searched. When I
protested, reminding them that I was not a criminal, they stopped. An
officer then took from me an article I was reading, a conversation
between novelists Philip Roth and Milan Kundera. As if he had just
come upon a lump of gold, he read for a while, in search of some
proof of my "guilt." I could see that he was concentrating--this was
probably the most difficult article he ever had to read. Soon he
abandoned the task, but he also refused me, a former "criminal"
Chinese writer, the right to continue reading the words of Kundera, a
former "criminal" Czech writer.</TE>
<TE>   I waited nervously for more than an hour. I was prepared for the
worst. I was ready to be arrested again, to go missing, for my family
to begin another frantic search, for friends to angrily protest and
perhaps even for my brother in Beijing to once again be arrested for
telling the world of my arrest. I knew the potential price to be paid
for returning to my homeland.</TE>
<TE>   A bit later, a kindly border agent gave me water and something to
eat and took me to the restroom. I was then told that because of my
appearance at the Hong Kong gathering, I was being refused entry into
China.</TE>
<TE>   I'm a Beijinger. I'm a poet who grew up in Beijing. Reciting
poetry in memory of those who died in Tiananmen Square is the only
way I have to express my pain. If this is why I'm unable to return to
my homeland, I have no regrets, although I am deeply saddened.</TE>
<TE>   It does leave me wondering, though. Why is a regime as powerful as
China's afraid of a poet and his pen?</TE>

<AU>DAVID DeVOSS</AU>
<BD>David DeVoss is a senior correspondent for the
East-West News Service.</BD>
<DL>SHERMAN OAKS</DL>
<LD>The battle for San Fernando Valley independence ostensibly pits the
downtown power structure against Valley business leaders and
homeowner-activists. But the front line in the secession struggle
cuts right through the northeast Valley, where most of the Valley's
African Americans and hundreds of thousands of Latino immigrants
live. There, theoretical arguments about taxes paid and city services
received aren't the talk of the town. Instead, it's City Hall's
inattention to their daily lives.</LD>
<LD>   Some anti-secessionists have tried to racialize the battle. For
example, USC constitutional law professor Erwin Chemerinsky recently
wrote that "part of the impetus for secession comes from some whites
in the [Valley] who would prefer to be in a new city in which whites
are a majority."</LD>
<LD>   In truth, the San Fernando Valley is anything but a white enclave.
More than 158,000 Asians live here, nearly one-third of them
Filipino. In the areas hoping to secede, the Anglo and Latino
populations are roughly equal. About one-third of the Valley's 1.7
million people are immigrants, many of whom fled war-ravaged Central
America in the 1980s when the City Council declared Los Angeles a
refuge.</LD>
<TE>   City Hall hopes they will reject the uncertainty that comes with
creating a new city. But immigrants are people who have experience
with dysfunctional government and the hard work required to build a
better life. After studying the U.S. political system to obtain
citizenship, they more than most know the meaning of representative
government.</TE>
<TE>   "All you have to do is walk around here to see that [City Hall
doesn't listen]," says John Hunter, a black retired Army sergeant.
He's standing beside Glenoaks Boulevard, along with a handful of
disenchanted Pacoima residents, nearly all of whom plan to vote for
Valley cityhood. He points to a traffic island just south of the
Ronald Reagan Freeway that has become a barren swatch of dirt for
lack of irrigation. For more than a year, residents had requested the
median be landscaped and a sign put up welcoming motorists to their
community. Finally, last May, Betty Cooper took matters in her own
hands: She camped out on the island amid hand-lettered signs
chastising the city for its empty promises.</TE>
<TE>   ''After five days, one of Councilman Alex Padilla's deputies came
and said the city would fix the sprinklers if I went home," says
Cooper, who is grateful for the sprouting grass but wonders if the
landscaping and welcome sign ever will arrive.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tragic that you have to fight just to get broken sprinklers
repaired," she says with a sigh. "If this median had been properly
maintained, it would have been a great morale builder. We care about
our community, but Padilla never visits, and his aides are always in
meetings when we call."</TE>
<TE>   Ask an Encino resident why he supports Valley independence and
you'll hear a theoretical discussion about the imbalance between
taxes paid and services received. But for residents of the northeast
Valley, Los Angeles' indifference to neighborhood concerns is a
source of daily frustration.</TE>
<TE>   "Just look at these streets," Sylmar's Oscar Mendoza exclaims as
we bounce along roads evocative of rural Mississippi. "This is a nice
community, with homes worth over $500,000, but we can't get the city
to pave the streets."</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza, 28, is a project manager for a roofing company. He's also
president of San Fernando Valley Residents for Independence. How does
Mendoza recruit secessionists? By driving up Glenoaks, which floods
every time it rains, traversing the rutted track called Olden Street,
then returning down San Fernando Road, passing vacant lots that serve
as flea markets for drugs and cheap sex.</TE>
<TE>   "Now look at what the Valley could become if it were independent,"
he says as we enter the City of San Fernando. Immediately, the ruts
and potholes disappear, sidewalks become clean and traffic medians
blossom with profusions of flowers. "Both San Fernando and Sylmar are
Latino communities, but only one of them functions properly. Latinos
in Sylmar pay their taxes, and they'd like to live in a decent
community too."</TE>
<TE>   No large U.S. city has all the money it needs. But residents of
the northeast Valley wonder why City Hall pleads poverty when they
ask for civic improvements, yet continues to subsidize downtown
developers and reward political contributors with sweetheart
contracts to study municipal projects that seldom are completed.</TE>
<TE>   Vickie and Alejandro Aguilar's potluck Neighborhood Watch meetings
are famous in the northeast San Fernando Valley. Held each month in a
different Sun Valley home, the meetings are conducted in Spanish. But
the scene is pure Norman Rockwell. While children play soccer in the
backyard and parents nibble on tamales, politicians and community
leaders stand and deliver five-minute orations. Then they listen to
what the neighbors have to say. But during this month's meeting, the
frustration is palpable when a representative of Mayor James K. Hahn
rises to speak.</TE>
<TE>   "I know street lighting and speed bumps are important to this
group, but the city doesn't have any money to pay for these things,"
says James Burkhardt, City Hall's North Valley area director. "We've
looked for but can't find any community block grant money," Burkhardt
continues. "This means residents have to pay for any improvements."</TE>
<TE>   Greeted with grimaces and rolled-up eyes, Burkhardt's message is
not the one that residents want to hear. "Sun Valley is a
neighborhood with a lot of children and no sidewalks," says Vickie
Aguilar after the meeting. "We need street lights and speed bumps
because there's no place for children to play but the streets. Many
people here believe they could benefit from a new city."</TE>
<TE>   Crime is an issue that cuts across geographic boundaries. In the
West Valley, people complain about the recent 22% increase in Valley
homicides and the estimated $125 million L.A. will need to resolve
lawsuits arising from the Rampart police corruption scandal. They
worry that the 3-12 arrangement, which allows police who work three
12-hour shifts to get the rest of the week off, will affect response
times. There's also a concern that because four of five LAPD officers
live outside the city, police no longer have a vested interest in the
city they have pledged to serve and protect.</TE>
<TE>   But it is in the northeast Valley where the city's commitment to
public safety is most severely questioned. "They say my son's death
was gang-related, but he wasn't in a gang," Gonzalo Sanchez says. "He
was a victim of police incompetence."</TE>
<TE>   When Sylmar High student David Sanchez was stabbed after school
two months ago, his friends called 911. Twice they received a
recorded message that police were busy. By the time the Los Angeles
Police Department answered a third call, Sanchez had been bleeding
for more than 30 minutes. Police never called to inform the family of
their son's killing. Neither did they come to the Sanchez home to
investigate. The way the family found David was by randomly calling
local hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   "The city wouldn't even release the body until I paid for the
autopsy," the embittered father says. Sanchez is grateful that his
son's presumed killers were quickly captured, but he thinks a more
visible police presence might have prevented the slaying. "I think
the Valley should secede," he adds. "It's the only way we'll ever get
more police on the street."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn claims secession will hurt minorities. But many in the Valley
are not persuaded. "The Valley is not a GOP stronghold," says Alan
Clayton of the California Latino Redistricting Coalition. "Ten of the
14 council districts in a new Valley city would be heavily
Democratic. At least four, and probably five, of the new council
seats would be controlled by Latinos.''</TE>
<TE>   LA United and its allies south of Mulholland Drive are counting on
Latino union leaders like Miguel Contreras, head of the
810,000-strong Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, to stem the
secessionist tide. But it remains unclear whether Mexican American
union bosses truly reflect the sentiments of their members from
Guatemala, Nicaragua and El Salvador, many of whom do not regard
Mexicans as their natural leaders. One indication that the days of
ethnic bloc voting may be over was the defeat of Tony Cardenas by
Wendy Greuel in the race to replace departed council member Joel
Wachs.</TE>
<TE>   "Tony Cardenas calls just before the election and says, 'Why are
you helping Greuel? She doesn't care about you,' " recalls Jose Roy
Garcia, a Van Nuys businessman from El Salvador. "I wanted to tell
him, but never actually said, 'Because you haven't done anything for
our community, and she's at least trying to help.' "</TE>
<TE>   The election may turn on how many of the city's presumed
supporters are secret secessionists. Last year, Los Angeles' Central
City Assn. ("the voice for downtown") proclaimed Garcia "a treasure
of Los Angeles" for his work in building the United Nations Soccer
League. Today, Garcia supports Valley independence, ironically
because of his struggles with the city.</TE>
<TE>   "It took three years to get a fence around the park where we have
7,000 people playing soccer," Garcia says. "When we asked police to
chase away the drunks and drug dealers, the LAPD said it was too
busy. Recently, I proposed creating two soccer fields for women at
Valley Plaza Park. The Department of Recreation and Parks responded
by scattering boulders on the grass, making the land unusable for any
sport."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia wants to create soccer fields beneath the Department of
Water and Power lines slicing through Latino neighborhoods. But he's
not optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them the Latino community would pay for everything,"
Garcia says. "After waiting for more than a year, the DWP told me to
put it in writing."</TE>

<DH>The president's Middle East speech called for all the right
things. But he offered no plan to achieve them.</DH>

Fundamentalism and the Struggle for the Temple Mount."</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>If you missed President Bush's speech on the Middle East conflict,
it's not hard to find out what's in it. You can read the full text on
the White House Web site. But to assess the long-awaited policy
statement, it's actually more important to look at what isn't in it.
The short answer is hope. For those who live in the Mideast and for
Americans who care about what is happening here, the speech contained
almost nothing that could lead to a peace initiative with a chance of
succeeding.</LD>
<LD>   First a word about what Bush did say. He called for two states
living in peace and asserted that reaching that objective required
all sides to fight terrorism. Living in Jerusalem, I certainly second
that sentiment. In this city, the calendar seems stuck on Sept. 11
all year round. I know couples who won't meet at restaurants for
lunch or take buses together, so as not to leave their kids orphaned
in the event of a bombing. The most basic requirement of any
diplomatic effort is that it change that reality.</LD>
<LD>   The way to achieve that goal, the president said, is to replace
the Palestinian leadership. That's a short, simple answer. To
understand why it's not enough, we need to look at just some of the
things that Bush didn't include in his vision.</LD>
<TE>   First is the Saudi initiative. In the midst of the violence and
diplomatic deadlock, Arab League approval of the Saudi peace
initiative in March provided a glimmer of optimism. In return for an
Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories and establishment of
a Palestinian state, the Arab states proposed full peace and normal
relations.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative was a starting point for talks, not an end point.
Nonetheless, it was a victory for Israel: For the first time, the
Arab world was collectively offering to recognize the Jewish
state--at least in its pre-1967 boundaries. By putting the initiative
on the table, the Saudis also tacitly acknowledged that their
alliance with the U.S. depended on taking an active role in ending
the conflict with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Bush could have pointed to the initiative as a positive proposal
worth building on, outlining concrete steps to move the process
forward. He would thereby have given moderate Arab leaders an
incentive to stay involved in diplomatic efforts and rewarded Israeli
politicians who took the risk of welcoming the Arab League decision.</TE>
<TE>   He also would have made a statement to the Israeli public:
Ultimately a peace agreement will rest on the pre-1967 boundaries,
with negotiated adjustments. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's conception
of a Palestinian state in fragmented pieces of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, squeezed between Israeli settlements, isn't a serious basis
for an end to the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Another thing missing from the speech was any sense of the
negotiations undertaken by Bill Clinton. Just before leaving the
White House, President Clinton summed up his peace efforts with a
speech to the Israel Policy Forum in New York. The president who'd
arguably put more effort into Israeli-Palestinian peace than any
American leader before him set down essential parameters for an
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   They asked a lot from both sides: Israel would have to give up
most of the West Bank. Palestinians would have to drop their demand
for the unlimited return of refugees to Israel. The solution in
Jerusalem would give each side less than it wanted but keep the city
open and undivided.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Israelis nor Palestinians would have signed off on the
parameters as stated. But among those committed to peacemaking,
Clinton's outline is recognized as a fair formulation of the
direction needed to solve the outstanding issues. The parameters show
a commitment to Israel's welfare--and recognize that its interest
lies in ending its rule over the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, Bush has ignored the parameters. He's one of those
executives who shows he's in charge by doing everything differently
from the guy before him. If his predecessor had white curtains in the
office, he wants brown ones; if his predecessor boosted sales, by
golly, he'll cut them. So anything with the name Clinton on it has to
go.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Bush vaguely spoke of ''secure and recognized borders''
for Israel, without saying what he meant by that. He said, ''We must
... resolve questions concerning Jerusalem [and] the plight and
future of Palestinian refugees,'' but he didn't say how.</TE>
<TE>   By skipping past the core issues of the conflict and making Arafat
the sole obstacle to peace, Bush virtually signed on to the position
of Sharon. Yet Sharon, Israel's most intransigent prime minister
ever, is proof that a democratically elected leader can be more
extreme than his electorate, less willing than his constituents to
take the steps necessary for peace.</TE>
<TE>   Take the settlement problem: Sharon rejects evacuating a single
Israeli settlement in the occupied territories; he has insisted that
the isolated, tiny Gaza Strip settlement of Netzarim is as important
to Israel as Tel Aviv. But in a recent poll of the Israeli public by
the Tami Steinmetz Center for Peace Research at Tel Aviv University,
54% of Jewish respondents said settlements weakened Israel's national
interests; only 35% said they strengthened the country. Even voters
for Sharon's right-wing Likud Party were almost evenly split on the
issue. (The Arab minority, of course, is utterly opposed to
settlements.)</TE>
<TE>   Sharon won office because negotiations appeared to have failed,
and he stays in power because peace proponents can't point to a
viable diplomatic option. Bush could have given new life to the
political debate here by telling the Israeli public: The United
States will lend a hand to a new push for peace, but the Israeli
government needs to renew its commitment to compromise. At that
point, voters again would have had a real choice: Sharon's failed bid
at a military solution to terror or the peace platform of his
opponents.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the issue of democracy. Yes, Bush did use the
word in his speech, regularly. But there's a difference between
saying the word and talking about the thing itself.</TE>
<TE>   The way Bush spoke of democracy, the Palestinians are supposed to
go to the polls and vote--against Arafat. One wonders: Will there be
a gunboat off the Gaza coast to ensure the outcome? Or if Arafat wins
in the popular vote, does Bush expect the new, independent
Palestinian judiciary to simply name Arafat's opponent the winner?</TE>
<TE>   The sad reality is that if Palestinian elections were held today,
Arafat would either win again or lose to a challenger more
intransigent than he is. If reelected, he'd face a legislature
dominated by hard-liners. Arafat has been discredited not only by his
corruption but by his failure to bring independence through the Oslo
process.</TE>
<TE>   Again, there is a legitimate way for the U.S. to influence
Palestinian politics: Provide reason to believe that by choosing
peace, Palestinians stand a greater chance of realizing their
aspirations for independence.</TE>
<TE>   On the surface, Bush tried to do that. But his promise of full
independence that ''could be reached'' three years hence was too
distant and tenuous to inspire trust in American diplomacy. His call
for Israeli settlement activity to stop, and for Israeli troops to
pull back to the positions they held before the current uprising,
lacks a time frame. Even if Sharon were to comply, the existing
settlements would remain in place, chopping Palestinian-controlled
territory into a series of enclaves. Pending the vague final-status
solution, Palestinians would find themselves at the status quo ante
of September 2000--living under the conditions that eroded confidence
in a peaceful solution.</TE>
<TE>   Under those conditions, Palestinians aren't likely to run for
office on a platform of conciliation.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't, I suspect, that Bush aimed for a speech without hope.
He didn't grasp that hope is in the details. American intervention
could change the political atmosphere among both Israelis and
Palestinians. But it has to provide tangible reason for Israelis to
believe they'll finally have security and for Palestinians to believe
they'll achieve independence.</TE>
<TE>   To inspire hope, the president needs to say much more. He needs to
talk about how he envisions solving those problems of borders,
Jerusalem and refugees. He needs to be honest about the need for
Israel to evacuate settlements--honesty that most Israelis would
appreciate. He needs to say more about the diplomatic steps toward
reaching agreement.</TE>
<TE>   And unless he does so, his supposed support for Israel will remain
hollow--for Israel's most vital interest remains peace.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>His name was never uttered, but Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was
clearly the target of President Bush's major speech on the Middle
East conflict last week. Bush's call to oust the Palestinian
Authority president, as a precondition for a "provisional"
Palestinian state, aroused predictable fury in many Arab newspapers
and equally predictable joy in at least some of the Israeli press.
But the rest of the world had serious questions about how the
Palestinians could be persuaded to go along with the
plan--particularly in lieu of any U.S. demands being placed on the
Israelis. Some editorialists suggested that Bush may have even
strengthened the tottering Arafat regime by appearing to meddle in
internal Palestinian affairs. What follows is a sample of commentary
from papers around the world on the Bush address:</LD>
<LD>   ISRAEL</LD>
<LD>   The genius of Bush's speech is that it finally spoke the truth
about who is standing in the way of Palestinian liberty and
independence. Those who continue to blame Israel for Palestinian
suffering are not doing the Palestinians any favors, and they
certainly are not realists. The lesson of Sept. 11, and the core of
the still-evolving Bush Doctrine, is that basing peace or stability
on belligerent dictatorships is like building on sand. Bush's new
emphasis on democracy is not starry-eyed naivete, but realism based
on bitter experience.</LD>
<TE>   --Unsigned editorial, Jerusalem Post</TE>
<TE>   The only useful thing in President Bush's useless speech is that
now we know which way the dice in Washington have fallen when it
comes to the Middle East. Those millions of Israelis who are losing
hope for an agreement to end the conflict through political means now
have authorization from the leader of the West that, for a long time
to come, there won't be even the beginning of movement.</TE>
<TE>   --Gideon Samet, Haaretz</TE>
<TE>   It must be clear to all that beyond all kinds of justified claims
regarding the conduct of Israeli governments from Rabin's to Barak's
vis-a-vis their relations with the Palestinians and the
implementation of the Oslo accords, most of the burden must be on the
shoulders of the Palestinians, part of whom either perpetrated or
encouraged terror, and part of whom neither reined it in nor fought
against it.</TE>
<TE>   --Unsigned editorial, Maariv</TE>
<TE>   PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES</TE>
<TE>   Bush clearly views the Palestinians as being the direct cause of
Israeli suffering, but as for the Palestinians--dispossessed of their
country and freedom for 54 years--Israel has no culpability at all.
It is as if the Palestinians, due to a bit of rotten luck, have
caught a cold ....The future for Palestinians and Israelis is as grim
as it has ever been. What Bush has offered is not a formula for
provisional ... Palestinian statehood, but a vision of permanent war.</TE>
<TE>   --Ali Abunimah, Ramallah Online</TE>
<TE>   Few speeches could be considered to be as destructive as today's
address from the American president.... While a cynical push for
Palestinian reform has been issued both from the United States and
Israel, there has also been a growing movement from within the
fledgling Palestinian civil society for democratic reform of
Palestinian governance, under occupation. Whether intentional or not,
this speech, declaring a veritable open season on Arafat,
short-circuits those efforts. The Palestinian people are surely not
going to pressure their leadership to step down when this is what is
being demanded by Israel and the U.S. What people could tolerate
their leaders being assigned by an external power, especially one
with which it is locked in an increasingly heated conflict?</TE>
<TE>   --Mitchell Plitnick, Palestine Chronicle</TE>
<TE>   LEBANON</TE>
<TE>   [Bush's speech] was packed with demands of the Palestinians in
exchange for a vague "provisional" status that could, if they did
what they are told, lead to statehood and peace in three years. In
contrast, Bush only warned Israel that it could not hold on to
territories it overran in the 1967 war and expect the Arabs to offer
it security and recognition.</TE>
<TE>   --Mona Ziade, The Daily Star</TE>
<TE>   IRAQ</TE>
<TE>   Bush's cheating speech aims at curbing the Palestinian armed
resistance against the Zionists' [Israeli] occupation and denying the
Palestinians the right to live.</TE>
<TE>   --Unsigned editorial, Babel</TE>
<TE>   SAUDI ARABIA</TE>
<TE>   The notion of an interim state is unheard of in international
politics. There are interim governments and interim presidents, never
an interim state. A provisional state will have none of the
prerogatives of statehood, no final borders, no capital, and no say
in when or indeed if Israel will pull out of Palestinian territories.
The idea provides too little hope for the Palestinians while
heightening risks.</TE>
<TE>   --Unsigned editorial, Arab News</TE>
<TE>   BRITAIN</TE>
<TE>   Successful peace processes depend upon narrowing the number of
people and situations that can, in effect, place a veto on
progress.... This is the opposite. It offers just about anyone a veto
who wants one.... If you allow acts of terror to disrupt the process
of peace, then you allow the suicide bombers an effective veto.... If
I were a careerist in Ramallah, I'd start organizing the Palestinian
version of the early Sinn Fein right now.</TE>
<TE>   --David Aaronovitch, The Independent</TE>
<TE>   Bush's speech has placed Palestinian and Arab moderates in an
awkward position, has strengthened the hand of extremists, and has
established the West in general, and the U.S. in particular, as
enemies of the Arabs and Muslims. I would not be at all surprised if
Osama bin Laden did not rub his hands together in glee as he listened
to George Bush's speech.</TE>
<TE>   --Abdel Bari Atwan, editor of British-based</TE>
<TE>   Arab newspaper Al Quds, in the Mirror</TE>
<TE>   If it is any consolation to Arafat, America has been trying to
unseat Fidel Castro for 42 years, and Saddam Hussein for a decade.
Arafat might go. But you could also bet he will last longer in his
job than Powell.</TE>
<TE>   --Gavin Esler, The Mirror</TE>
<TE>   By imposing such stringent, indeed impossible, conditions on the
Palestinians, and none that really mean anything on Israel, Bush has
virtually given Sharon a free hand to press on with objectives that
have now become open and undisguised: Reoccupy the West Bank, bury
the Oslo accords, and replace the Palestinian Authority with a puppet
administration in nominal control of at most 42% of the West Bank.
--David Hirst, The Guardian</TE>
<TE>   AUSTRALIA</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Bush became yesterday the first U.S. president to expressly
support the creation of a Palestinian state and to fix any sort of
timetable for its creation. Commendable as that objective is, Mr.
Bush may have strangled his initiative [by] asking so much of the
Palestinians and so little of the Israelis. Had the president, for
instance, made it a precondition of U.S. support not only that Mr.
Arafat depart but that he be joined in retirement by the extremist
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, the U.S. peace plan might just
have stood a chance.</TE>
<TE>   --Unsigned editorial, Courier-Mail, Brisbane</TE>
<TE>   IRELAND</TE>
<TE>   There is no understanding here that the Israeli occupation itself
generates insecurity and terrorism. Only reciprocal action by the
Israelis to withdraw can encourage the political reform process
called for by Mr. Bush.</TE>
<TE>   --Unsigned editorial,The Irish Times</TE>
<TE>   FRANCE</TE>
<TE>   ... [T]he complete speech of George W. Bush passes from hand to
hand in Gaza. Tense faces. Astonishment. Consternation. The reactions
of Palestinian intellectuals are uniform. It's not the blast of
vitriol against Yasser Arafat that bothers them. For weeks, it's been
hard to find anyone in Gaza willing to come to the defense of the
leader. Quite the contrary. From janitor to minister, in discontented
grumbling or political analysis, everyone now questions the vision of
the leader.... But in a nation at war, dirty laundry is washed in
private.... By practically calling for the overthrow of the duly
elected president of the Palestinian Authority, Bush has obliged
Arafat's opposition to keep silent, lest they be treated as
criminals.</TE>

<BD>Jack Miles is senior advisor to the president of the J.
Paul Getty Trust and the author, most recently, of "Christ: A Crisis
in the Life of God."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the minor ill effects of the terrorist attacks on the United
States last September has been widespread insult to the American
flag. I refer not to the ritual burning of the Stars and Stripes in
places like Baghdad but to unintentional desecration of it in places
like Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   On the freeways of Southern California, one observes every day
cars and trucks flying the soiled and weather-beaten remnants of
American flags raised on Sept. 12 and never lowered since. On one
surface street shortcut I often take, I pass a home with a large "God
Bless America" sign in the window and, hanging backward from the
windowsill, a tattered rag that over the months has gone from red,
white and blue to pink, gray and lavender.</LD>
<LD>   I was a lackluster Boy Scout in my day, but one lesson I did learn
from my scoutmaster, Mr. Gurney, was how to respect and care for the
national emblem. I learned that when the flag is hung in a window,
the "union"--that is, the blue field with the white stars--must be to
the flag's right (the viewer's left) as it faces outward. I learned
that unless the flag has a spotlight upon it, it must not be flown at
night. An unlighted flag must be lowered at sundown but never be
allowed to touch the ground. (At Boy Scout camp, the flag was raised
at sunrise--a thrilling duty for the boys chosen each evening without
warning to perform it on the following morning.)</LD>
<TE>   It was Mr. Gurney's view, personal perhaps, but I share it to this
day, that the flag ought never be incorporated into a garment like a
shirt or a skirt or a hat. The flag may be sewn onto a uniform, but
if the colors bleed in the laundry, then one must replace it or
remove it. A flag decal must never be affixed to the outside, only to
the inside, of a window lest it fade and wrinkle in the weather.</TE>
<TE>   But the lesson that impressed me most deeply--and has come back to
me most forcefully as we approach the first Independence Day since
Sept. 11--was that to fly the American flag soiled, faded or torn is
to insult it. The flag must be kept clean, mended and pressed; and
when a given flag is too old for use, it must be retired, cut in
pieces and burned with ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   As we approach this Fourth of July, my private hope is that some
of my fellow Americans will strike the soiled colors from their vans
and sundecks, conduct a proper minor liturgy in their backyards and
give the flag merchants of the land of the free and the home of the
brave a little fresh business.</TE>

<HD>Bush May Have Given Arafat Yet Another Life</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MUHAMMAD MUSLIH</AU>
<BD>Muhammad Muslih is a professor of political science at
Long Island University. He recently co-authored a book on the
evolution of Arab thinking on the refugee question and is currently
writing a book on radical Islamic movements in the Arab world.</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>"A mountain unmoved by winds" is a popular Arabic expression meaning
steadfastness in the face of adversity or victory under siege. In
barracks and in parades, in press conferences and in the principal
Palestinian towns that came under the control of the Palestinian
Authority after the 1993 Oslo accords, Yasser Arafat repeatedly used
this expression to give Palestinians confidence in his ability to
confront all challenges and to build the foundations of their
national state. Today, the expression tells the story of a leader to
whom many Palestinians are indifferent. Yet, regrettably, the Bush
administration might be giving him new political life.</LD>
<LD>   There are two narratives of Arafat. One is the story of a hero,
the only leader available, a statesman, a democratically elected
president of the Palestinian Authority, the symbol of the Palestinian
movement and, above all, a patriot devoted to the Palestinian cause
and to saving his people from the brutality of Israeli occupation.
The other is one of the inept leader, the dictator, the promoter of
corruption, the protector of Israel's security, the supporter of
terrorism, the pathological liar and the spoiler who cannot be a
peace partner.</LD>
<TE>   But a closer look into the political life of Arafat reveals a more
nuanced narrative. Arafat's world transcends Palestinian politics. It
is one in which formal accords can be less important than unspoken
agreements. It is also one marked by Arab, Israeli and Western
hypocrisy. The polemics of the Palestinian revolution aside, Arafat's
Palestine Liberation Organization protected U.S. personnel and
interests in Lebanon from 1973 until 1982, when Israeli armor ousted
the PLO from the country.</TE>
<TE>   Arab oil money nurtured the corruption of his diaspora-based
regime in the 1970s and 1980s. Arab recognition of the PLO as the
sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people in 1974
signified that Arab officialdom was abandoning its responsibilities
toward Palestinians. Arafat shouldered that responsibility himself,
and time proved that it was too much for him to handle. Western and
Israeli support for Arafat after Oslo reinforced his autocratic
tendencies and his tolerance for corruption. Four events mark this
evolution: the promotion of security (mainly that of Israel), the
containment of the Islamists, the silencing of all forms of
opposition, and Israel's grant of special privileges to Palestinian
Authority officials until the eruption of the intifada in September
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat's life also parallels the fate of a generation of
Palestinians: the rising tide of self-assertion and armed struggle in
the 1960s and 1970s and the ebbing of that tide in the early 1980s;
the hopes generated by Oslo and the collapse of these hopes seven
years later, which created the conditions for Arafat's decline.</TE>
<TE>   Before President Bush's speech on the Middle East last week, in
which he implicitly called for Arafat's ouster, Palestinian support
for Arafat hovered around 30%. His diminishing popularity is easily
explained. Arafat's pursuit of peace has not materially improved the
lives of most Palestinians or brought the freedom they covet closer.
He has not protected them from daily suffering and humiliation at the
hands of the Israelis. He has relentlessly maneuvered around real
reform. The government he heads is inept and corrupt. Finally,
Palestinians are increasingly aware that Arafat's diplomatic style is
shortsighted and has caused great harm to their national interests.</TE>
<TE>   These experiences have brought many Palestinians to a new
realization: It might be harder to build on the foundations of an old
house than to build a new one from scratch. The Palestinians who want
cosmetic reform are a minority. They constitute Arafat's inner
circle. Some of them are frequent visitors to Washington. They will
always be ready to defend him and advocate his cause.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, many Palestinian intellectuals, academics and political
activists, whose views span the spectrum, increasingly and publicly
talk about a parliamentary system of government in which a
democratically elected legislature would be the real source of power
and in which the president, be it Arafat or someone else, would have
only ceremonial powers.</TE>
<TE>   Separation of powers, transparency and accountability, civil
liberties and an independent judiciary--Palestinians want to bring
these principles together in a constitutional government. Some have
even called on Arafat not to run for public office in the
presidential and legislative elections scheduled to take place in
January 2003. The thinking of these Palestinians holds out the
hope--and promise--that this dark Palestinian time may be ending,
that a new Palestinian order is on the verge of being born.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Bush's speech did not encourage this new thinking.
Instead, it relied on external threats and pressures to bring about
peace, thus robbing Palestinians of the comfort of knowing that they
are changing things on their own. Every society is its own planet,
and the Palestinians do not need an overlord in Washington to tell
them what to do with their lives. If the U.S. government really wants
to help Palestinians and Israelis make peace, it should stay out of
internal Palestinian affairs. Otherwise, its meddling will only
strengthen the hand of Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   By embracing Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon so blindly, by
supporting his attack on the infrastructure of Palestinian society
and by making the achievement of peace contingent on the ouster of
Arafat, the Bush administration has made it much harder for the
Palestinians themselves to introduce real reform. That is
regrettable, because the debate currently emerging in Palestinian
society indicates that the "mountain" can be moved by the winds of
change.</TE>

<LD>Sylvester Stallone has sold a Beverly Hills-area home next door to
his residence to media mogul Sumner Redstone for close to $15
million, real estate industry sources said.</LD>
<LD>   The sale marked the first time that Redstone, a native of Boston,
has bought a California home. The chairman and chief executive of
Viacom (the owner of MTV and Nickelodeon, which merged with Paramount
in 1994 and later acquired Blockbuster) has for years been traveling
to Los Angeles several times a month on business, but he has stayed
mainly in hotels.</LD>
<LD>   The home that the billionaire businessman bought had been owned by
Stallone since September. The actor paid $16 million for it, then put
it back on the market in December at $16.95 million.</LD>
<TE>   When Stallone purchased the property, a spokesman for the actor
said, he bought it as a place for his relatives to stay while
visiting him.</TE>
<TE>   Redstone bought the property after months of house hunting. He was
in escrow to buy another home, but that deal fell through. Escrow on
the home that Stallone sold to him closed last week. The house was
vacant at the time of the sale, which did not include any
furnishings.</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1997, the 15,000-square-foot house has a master suite
with two bathrooms, three additional bedrooms, a gym, a billiard
room, a screening room, a two-story reading room, a 10-foot-long
aquarium, an indoor pool with skylights, a 100-foot-long outdoor pool
and a tennis court.</TE>
<TE>   The gated estate is on more than two acres. The actor bought his
house next door in 1998 for about $10 million, then expanded and
refurbished it. His Italian-style villa has more than seven bedrooms
in an estimated 20,000 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   Stallone, 55, starred in the 2001 movies "D-Tox" and "Driven,"
co-starring Burt Reynolds, and is due to co-star with Gabriel Byrne
in the upcoming film "Shade."</TE>
<TE>   Redstone, 79, was named media person of the year earlier this
month at the Cannes International Advertising Festival. The award
recognized Redstone's success in establishing Viacom as one of the
world's premier entertainment and media companies. Among its many
entities, Viacom also owns CBS and UPN. "A Passion to Win,"
Redstone's memoir written with Peter Knobler, was published by Simon
&amp; Schuster in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Valerie Fitzgerald of Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills North, had
the listing, and Ernie Carswell of the same office represented
Redstone in his purchase, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Former L.A. Clipper guard James Robinson has put his Ladera
Heights home on the market at $925,000. He plans to buy a house in
Palos Verdes or Pacific Palisades.</TE>
<TE>   His Ladera Heights home has four bedrooms in 3,400 square feet.
The contemporary-style house also has a media/game room, master suite
with an office and a walk-in closet, a pool, a spa and a three-car
garage.</TE>
<TE>   The house was custom-built for Robinson in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson, 31, has been playing basketball in Russia. After playing
for the Clippers from 1997 to 1999, he rejoined the Minnesota
Timberwolves, which he had played for from 1996 to 1997, for a brief
time before going to Russia. He began his professional basketball
career with the Portland Trail Blazers in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Kerri Jones of Re/Max, Beverly Hills, has the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Composer Kurt Farquhar--who has written music for such TV series
as "King of Queens" (1998), "The Parkers" (1999), "Soul Food" (2000)
and "Girlfriends" (2001)--and his vocalist wife, Chelle, have
purchased a newly built Mediterranean-style home near Caltech in
Pasadena for about its $2.9-million asking price.</TE>
<TE>   The home has four bedrooms and five bathrooms in slightly more
than 5,000 square feet. Mur Sol Construction Co. built the home for
the Farquhars.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Lile of Coldwell Banker, Pasadena, represented the couple in
buying.</TE>
<TE>   A Newport Coast home built for a member of a Middle Eastern royal
family who lived there for only a week has come on the market at
$11.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The ocean-view house, completed last fall on Pelican Hill near a
home owned by L.A. Laker star Kobe Bryant, has seven bedrooms in
15,000 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   It has a commercial-sized kitchen with two dishwashers, two
refrigerators and an eight-burner stove. The home also has a sweeping
staircase, a butler's pantry and a game room, which leads to an
infinity pool, a spa and a gym. The game room houses a saltwater
aquarium, a grand piano, a pool table and a big-screen TV. An
elevator serves all four levels of the house.</TE>
<TE>   Marian Phillippi and Coleen Brennan at Prudential California
Realty in Corona del Mar have the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Micheline Lerner, a former wife of the late Oscar-winning lyricist
and playwright Alan Jay Lerner, has listed her Holmby Hills home at
$5 million.</TE>
<TE>   At the age of 20 before she married the lyricist, Micheline Lerner
was one of the youngest lawyers in France. While married to her, Alan
Jay Lerner wrote some of his most famous lyrics as the legendary
musical-theater partner of composer Frederick (Fritz) Loewe. The two
wrote songs for shows such as "My Fair Lady," "Camelot" and "Gigi."</TE>
<TE>   The Lerners were divorced in the '60s, when she bought the
Regency-style house, designed by the late John Woolf. Built in 1939,
it has four bedrooms and maid's quarters plus a library/screening
room in about 4,500 square feet. The home, on about 1.5 acres behind
gates, also has a pool and city views.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Jay Lerner, scion of the Lerner Shops fortune, was married
eight times before he died at age 67 in 1986. Micheline Lerner, his
fourth wife, is the mother of his only son, Michael.</TE>
<TE>   Raymond Bekeris of John Bruce Nelson &amp; Associates has the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Brooke Knapp, who has set and broken more than 100 world aviation
speed records, including the fastest speed around the world in a
civilian jet aircraft--a Gulfstream III--sold a Bel-Air home she had
owned since 1973 for about $3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Knapp sold the country ranch-style home, on slightly more than 1.6
acres adjacent to the Bel-Air Golf Course, to Paul L. Kessler,
co-founder and director of the Los Angeles Film School, and his
attorney wife, Diana.</TE>
<TE>   Knapp's former property includes a 4,300-plus-square-foot home
with a two-story master suite, a gym, three additional bedrooms, four
bathrooms, a guest house, a pool and a spa.</TE>
<TE>   Knapp lived in the home initially, then for years maintained it as
an income property. Though Knapp is a Realtor, she was not involved
in the deal except as the seller.</TE>
<TE>   Drew Mandile, Knapp's partner at Sotheby's International Realty in
Beverly Hills, handled both sides of the transaction.</TE>

<LD>SAN FRANCISCO--An assisted-living community for seniors in Pacific
Palisades and a collection of luxury estates in Arcadia were among
the Southern California projects that took more than half of the
prizes at the 39th annual Gold Nugget awards ceremony, held Thursday
at the Pacific Coast Builders Conference here.</LD>
<LD>   A nine-member panel of judges considered more than 600 entries for
awards in 46 categories that honor achievement in architectural
design and land-use planning for residential, commercial and
industrial projects.</LD>
<LD>   The design contest, the oldest and largest of its kind in the
United States, was the highlight of the convention that brings
together developers and related professionals from around the world.</LD>
<TE>   Among the winning Southern California projects was Aldea in
Irvine, which received the best residential site plan award. The
development, designed by Robert Hidey Architects Inc. and built by
California Pacific Homes, was dubbed a "breakaway trendsetter" by the
judges. The project features 14 detached houses per acre in a
re-creation of old Los Angeles courtyard homes.</TE>
<TE>   The same building team accepted two additional awards for best
single-family detached homes, also in Irvine. Aldea-Residence One, at
about 1,030 square feet and designed for single parents and single
professionals, features walk-in closets and courtyard patios in what
judges described as a "Melrose Place" ambience. The other six-unit
complex features walkways and small parks that "provide a sense of
neighborhood identity and charm," the judges said.</TE>
<TE>   Two Anoakia Estates homes in Arcadia won in the best single-family
detached homes categories. Part of an infill project, the homes were
designed by Lim Chang Rohling &amp; Associates and built by Hover
Development Co., and feature simple, elegant floor plans, a
downstairs bedroom suite for multigenerational living and recessed
windows.</TE>
<TE>   The project plan worked carefully around mature oak trees on a
19-acre historic estate property. The about 5,000-square-foot homes
are priced from $1.6 million to $1.85 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Villas at Shady Canyon in Irvine also won two grand awards for
best single-family detached home. The Italian villa-inspired luxury
home, designed by Robert Hidey Architects Inc. and built by Taylor
Woodrow Homes, is organized around two courtyards that "bring
daylight and cross-ventilation to all living spaces," the judges
said.</TE>
<TE>   Sunrise Assisted Living in Pacific Palisades, designed by Hill
Partnership Inc. and built by Suffolk Construction, was named the
best seniors assisted-living community. The three-story, 40-unit
building was designed as an urban infill project and feels like a
luxury hotel, according to the judges. Units begin at $5,500 a month
and run to $7,000 monthly.</TE>
<TE>   Hermosa Village in Anaheim, designed by G.R. Collins &amp; Associates
and built by Portrait Homes Inc., picked up the award for best
redevelopment, rehabilitation or infill site plan.</TE>
<TE>   The complex, built in the 1950s as short-term housing for single
workers building Disneyland, underwent a major overhaul, from the
creation of courtyards and play spaces for children, to carports
located in the back of the buildings. Rents begin at $569 a month for
one-bedroom units to $1,201 for four-bedroom units.</TE>
<TE>   "[The project] covered all aspects of the neighborhood concerns,
from crime issues to the lack of parking spaces," the judges wrote in
their decision.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the five Building Industry Community Spirit Awards went to
Southern California projects. The award recognizes projects that meet
the needs of a community's less-fortunate residents.</TE>
<TE>   Local winners were Precious Life Shelter in Los Alamitos, designed
by JBZ Architecture + Planning and built by Centex Homes, South Coast
Division, and Gamboa Family House in Val Verde, designed by Leslie
Bailly Architect and built by Centex Homes.</TE>

<HD>Secession's Impact on Homes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE WEDNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Optimists among San Fernando Valley secession proponents may be
pinning their hopes on getting a quick boost in property values if a
new city materializes, but real estate experts caution that any
potential benefits from the separation will take time and probably
will be minimal.</LD>
<LD>   Tax revenue implications, zoning changes, a temporary diminution
of public services and a hefty proposed "alimony" payment--perhaps as
high as $288 million a year--to Los Angeles could temporarily dampen
the enthusiasm of potential buyers considering a move to the proposed
new Valley city, analysts say.</LD>
<LD>   Under a new general plan, new building projects, improvements in
city services and, especially, a new school district will take
several years to be implemented, so establishing the Valley as a
realty paradise probably will be a gradual process.</LD>
<TE>   Emphasizing that it's too early to speculate about the extent of
the potential positive or negative ramifications of secession on
Valley real estate, academicians, business leaders and Realtors agree
that any spike in property values will be closely related to the
perception of a high quality of life in the new city.</TE>
<TE>   That positive perception depends on a drop in the Valley crime
rate, on school and transportation improvements and on close
proximity to jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's perceived that the Valley, as a city, wants to improve
the quality of life, enhance the desirability for its residents, home
values should improve," said Bob Scott, director of Civic Center
Group, a public policy consulting firm in West Hills. "Changes will
be slow, though. It will take a few years."</TE>
<TE>   High on the list of challenges is the issue of zoning, or land-use
approval, said Larry Kosmont, president and chief executive of
Kosmont Cos., a residential and commercial real estate consulting
firm.</TE>
<TE>   While new zoning regulations could dampen enthusiasm for
residential development in the Valley for some time, he said, they
could, in the short run, increase the value of existing residences.</TE>
<TE>   The development process would be slowed while a new general plan,
which includes policy decisions on issues such as transportation,
housing and seismic safety, would be debated and subjected to an
environmental plan review, Kosmont said.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing can put a damper on real estate projects more than
political uncertainty," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Once in place, however, a new Valley city planning commission
would be able to focus on local land-use issues and implement a
vision that reflects the Valley's needs, said Sandy Paris, owner of
Paris Industrial Parks and past president of Valley Industry and
Commerce Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "When you focus on all of L.A. as a whole city, it's like trying
to apply a cookie-cutter approach to everyone," Paris said. "The
housing needs of San Pedro are different than the needs of
Chatsworth. This is a chance for a community, albeit a large one, to
refocus on its own needs."</TE>
<TE>   One concept Valley boosters are promoting for the new city is a
master plan for the next two decades called Vision Twenty-Twenty.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal, conceived by the Economic Alliance of the San
Fernando Valley, envisions cooperation among the Valley and five
adjacent cities, and focuses on town centers where retail stores and
residential units coexist in close proximity to transportation hubs,
entertainment centers, schools, police and fire stations and other
local services.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of the plan, including Scott and Paris, believe it will
be easier to implement such a vision if the Valley succeeds in
breaking away from Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The authors of the plan are committed to implementing it whether
or not the Valley secedes from Greater Los Angeles, said Bruce
Ackerman, president of the alliance.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of secession point out that developers have more to gain
than others in a new Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   Documentary transfer taxes, which are added to the sale of
properties, would be lower than those in Los Angeles, putting more
money in big developers' pockets, said Samantha Stevens, co-founder
of One Los Angeles, an anti-secession group.</TE>
<TE>   "We wonder why so many brokers and developers are supporting
secession," Stevens said. "Do they see profits for themselves?"</TE>
<TE>   While not all developers are in favor of secession, it's easy to
see why those who do business in the Valley would favor a split from
Los Angeles, said Steve Cauley, associate director of Ziman Center
for Real Estate at UCLA's Anderson School.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a terrible time dealing with the bureaucracy in L.A.,"
Cauley said. "It might be easier and less expensive to develop in a
new Valley city, but it's going to be hard to develop single-family
homes."</TE>
<TE>   Under the new documentary transfer tax rules, the Valley would
experience a shortfall of about $30 million in tax revenues,
according to most estimates, and analysts predict that the shortfall
will have to be made up by the imposition of additional taxes.</TE>
<TE>   To generate quick additional revenue, the Valley might resort to
the common sales tax-producing strategy of allowing big-box retail
stores and other large commercial interests to gain a foothold, while
residential projects, which generate fewer tax dollars, would take a
back seat, said Stuart Gabriel, director of the USC Lusk Center for
Real Estate.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at the 101 corridor between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara,"
Gabriel said of the stretch of highway that is lined with gigantic
retail outlets. "If the Valley is bereft of funds, they'll look for
other ways of getting taxes, and commercial ventures historically
have provided that."</TE>
<TE>   There is also the matter of the Valley paying up to $288 million a
year in compensation to the city of Los Angeles, a bite that could
further erode confidence in the ability of the Valley to support the
services that experts say are essential to boosting real estate
values in the new city.</TE>
<TE>   "If it were a clean divorce, it would be favorable economically
and for real estate in the Valley," Cauley said. "But I think this
will be a messy divorce."</TE>
<TE>   While the parties sort out their differences, real estate agents,
business interests and policymakers take a sanguine view of the
outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "Will it be better?" Paris asked. "I don't know. But it can't be
worse."</TE>

<CX>   Secession--A story in the June 30 Real Estate section referred
incorrectly to the "alimony" payments that a San Fernando Valley city
would be required to pay if it becomes independent from Los Angeles.
The payment is set at $127.1 million for the first year, and would
gradually decline to zero over 20 years. The story also incorrectly
suggested that a Valley city might experience a shortfall in revenue
because it would not be allowed to levy a real estate transfer tax
that currently generates about $30 million per year. Under the terms
of secession, a Valley city would begin operations with a budget
reserve. While a Valley city would not be able to levy the transfer
tax as Los Angeles does, that amount has already been figured into
the budget for the proposed city and would not create a revenue gap.</CX>

<DH>For-sale-by-owner Web listings appeal to thrifty home
sellers but haven't quite clicked yet with buyers</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF BERTOLUCCI</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The concept is tantalizing: Instead of paying a 6% commission to a
Realtor, sell your house yourself on the Web and save tens of
thousands of dollars in agents' fees.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of Web sites, such as ForSaleByOwner.com, HomeSalez.com,
GoneHome.com and Owners.com, offer home sellers a platform for
marketing their homes to millions of potential customers on the
Internet.</LD>
<LD>   But many Southern California home sellers who have tried
for-sale-by-owner, or FSBO, sites complain that their ads have gone
unnoticed by buyers. Some eventually sign with a real estate agent,
while others place FSBO ads in more traditional media, including
newspaper classifieds and real estate magazines.</LD>
<TE>   The problem, proponents of sell-it-yourself Web sites say, is that
many buyers don't yet know the sites exist, though aggressive
marketing, including TV infomercials, may someday make
for-sale-by-owner real estate sites as popular as such online
discount brokerages as Ameritrade and E*Trade.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, but today's FSBO sites aren't exactly hotbeds of real
estate activity, at least not in Southern California. Their lack of
popularity is surprising given the Southland's booming housing
market, where homes in some areas are selling in a day and multiple
offers are driving up prices. Seldom-visited FSBO sites could offer a
distinct advantage to frustrated home buyers, who could make offers
without entering into bidding wars.</TE>
<TE>   But don't try to tell that to Valentino Perkov. When he wanted to
sell his two-bedroom house in San Pedro, Perkov bought a three-month
ad from Owners.com for about $100. After three weeks online, he
hasn't received a single call regarding his $345,000 property. "I
have some hits on the Web site," Perkov said, "but no calls yet."</TE>
<TE>   James Athan had a similar experience when trying to sell his
two-bedroom bungalow in El Sereno. He paid roughly $30 to list his
$200,000 home on HomeSalez.- com. "We never got any responses from
that Web ad," Athan said.</TE>
<TE>   Christie Stoddard hasn't done much better. She recently listed her
$490,000, four-bedroom Brea home on ForSaleByOwner.com. But after a
month, her ad doesn't appear to be working. "We've gotten more calls
from just having a for sale sign out front," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A typical FSBO site allows the seller to post a classified-style
listing with one to seven photos of the houses, along with e-mail and
phone contact information.</TE>
<TE>   The cost ranges from nothing (for a basic ad with photos on
GoneHome.com) to $199 (for an ad on ForSaleByOwner.com with yard and
"directional" signs for your property).</TE>
<TE>   Most sites offer additional services for sellers and buyers,
including mortgage calculators, information on schools and recent
sales data to help sellers price their homes accurately. And for
those unsure about going FSBO, many sites provide links to Realtor
sites and phone numbers for partnering real estate agents.</TE>
<TE>   So if sellers are posting ads on FSBO sites, why aren't buyers
clicking? According to officials of some sites, the major problem is
marketing--or the lack of it.</TE>
<TE>   "Some sites do a good job at taking people's money, but they do a
poor job at spending that money where it needs to be spent--at
driving potential customers to a home," said ForSaleByOwner.com Chief
Operating Officer Colby Sambrotto. "They don't spend enough money on
marketing and advertising so not enough people see the ad, and the
seller doesn't get any offers."</TE>
<TE>   Based in New York City, ForSaleByOwner.com lists about 10,000 to
12,000 homes for sale on its site at any given time, Sambrotto said.
But a quick search for homes within a 50-mile radius of central Los
Angeles produced only 36 hits. (A similar search on GoneHome resulted
in six homes, whereas Owners.com yielded about 60 hits. Some of the
Owners.com listings, however, were for vacant lots and foreclosure
properties.)</TE>
<TE>   ForSaleByOwner.com recently shot a 30-minute infomercial
explaining the benefits of home selling on the Web. The infomercial
will air on cable systems in the Los Angeles area in about a month,
and also will run in 36 markets across the country.</TE>
<TE>   Some FSBO sites take a strictly Web-centric (and less costly)
approach to marketing. Toronto-based HomeSalez.com, for instance,
spends $5,000 to $6,000 per month to place its name on Internet
search sites. If you type "sell your own home" in a search engine
such as AltaVista or Yahoo, a link to HomeSalez.com will appear in
the first page of results.</TE>
<TE>   "It has become so crowded, with [thousands] of real estate Web
sites out there," said HomeSalez.com founder and President Shawn
O'Quinn. "It's impossible to compete unless you spend money."</TE>
<TE>   Only 16% of homes nationwide are sold without an agent, and that
figure drops to 10% in the West, says the National Assn. of Realtors.</TE>
<TE>   FSBO operators believe homeowners simply give up too soon on the
sell-it-yourself concept, regardless of whether they use the Web.
Perhaps, but it's understandable that home sellers get nervous when
potential buyers don't bid.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Williamson listed his $167,500, three-bedroom Inglewood
townhouse on GoneHome- .com, but quickly changed his mind and hired a
real estate agent. He retained his free GoneHome ad but isn't
optimistic about FSBO sites. "As far as I know," he said, "the Web ad
has not produced anything."</TE>
<TE>   Williamson said he believes that many potential buyers don't surf
the Web. "You're looking at a smaller segment [of the population],
people with Internet access."</TE>
<TE>   Many for-sale-by-owner sites see expanding beyond the Net as
essential for their success. Some have added voicemail services to
attract a larger customer base.</TE>
<TE>   Owners.com, for instance, provides its sellers with a yard sign
with a toll-free number. When prospective buyers call the number,
they can hear details about the property and leave a message for the
seller without going online.</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine yourself driving by a house on a Sunday afternoon, and
you want quick information on it without talking to the owner or
agent," said Steve Udelson, Owners.com president. "To get information
[by phone] is a great convenience to you."</TE>
<TE>   The supercharged Southern California real estate market has
created another problem for FSBO sites--outdated listings. Too often
homes listed for sale have already been sold, a frustrating
experience for potential buyers.</TE>
<TE>   When The Times contacted HomeSalez.com user Athan, for instance,
his El Sereno house had been sold six weeks earlier. Similarly,
Owners.com user Dorian Filipescu, who was asking $269,000 for his
three-bedroom home in Reseda, told The Times that his house had sold
a month earlier.</TE>
<TE>   ForSaleByOwner.com's Sambrotto admits that dead listings are a
problem for all real estate sites.</TE>
<TE>   GoneHome chief executive and founder Myron Mullins agrees. "It's a
huge, huge problem in online real estate right now because it's
making for dissatisfactory experiences," said Mullins, who adds that
his company contacts sellers if their ads haven't been updated for 45
days. If the homeowner doesn't confirm that the house is still for
sale, the ad is removed from the site.</TE>
<TE>   FSBO sites aren't the only ones plagued with dead listings.</TE>
<TE>   Realtor.com, the real estate industry's flagship site, which
boasts more than 2 million listings, suffers a similar problem.</TE>
<TE>   A Times check of 10 randomly selected Realtor.com listings in
Southern California revealed that seven properties were either sold
or in escrow, two were still available and, in one case, the agent's
phone number had been disconnected. (Listings on Realtor.com direct
you to an agent, not to a homeowner.)</TE>
<TE>   But not all is gloom and doom in the FSBO online world.
GoneHome.com user David Huang, who is asking $749,000 for his
four-bedroom house in Glendale, said he's had success selling and
renting properties on FSBO sites. Some regions of the U.S., he said,
are more receptive to Internet shopping than others.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in the Bay Area," Huang said, "and customers here use the
Internet more often than people in Southern California."</TE>
<TE>   Industry experts agree that Southern California isn't a
front-runner in FSBO activity. According to ForSaleByOwner.com
research, homeowners in Florida, the Carolinas and other regions of
the southeastern U.S. are more receptive to selling without an agent.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very weak on the West Coast and in the Pacific Northwest,"
said Sambrotto, a problem he attributes, in part, to demographics.
"People in the lower middle class are more open to [FSBO] because
there's a larger incentive for them to save that 6%."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the shortcomings of for-sale-by-owner Web sites, its
proponents predict the concept will ultimately succeed. The reason:
Realtor commissions are too steep, they say, and homeowners want a
less expensive way to sell their properties.</TE>
<TE>   "Consumers have been getting a raw deal," Sambrotto said. "They
deserve better, and our goal is to offer them a viable alternative."</TE>

<LD>Jeff Kent has no explanations for hitting streaks--even his own.</LD>
<LD>   "As a player you don't try to analyze it, you just go with the
flow," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Batting third in the lineup for the third consecutive game, Kent
hit a two-run homer and drove in another run as the San Francisco
Giants beat the Oakland Athletics, 5-3, Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Over the three games he has hit in front of Barry Bonds, Kent has
batted .533, going eight for 15 with three doubles, two homers and 12
runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   "I've only hit there three times," he said. "I've hit five years
in another place in the lineup and put up numbers there too."</TE>
<TE>   Giant Manager Dusty Baker flip-flopped Kent and Bonds in the
batting order for the first time this season on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The move came in a week where the spotlight was already on Bonds
and Kent. The two got into a dugout scuffle in San Diego on Tuesday,
a fracas that was captured by television cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Schmidt (4-2) gave up three runs and six hits over seven
innings for the Giants, who have won four of their last six games. He
struck out nine. Robb Nen pitched the ninth for his 21st save.</TE>
<TE>   The A's fell to 15-2 in interleague play, with their only losses
coming to the Giants. Cory Lidle (2-7) gave up four runs and eight
hits over six innings.</TE>
<TE>   There were 53,501 fans at the game between the cross-bay
interleague rivals--the third-largest baseball crowd in Coliseum
history.</TE>

<LD>St. Louis Cardinal General Manager Walt Jocketty assembled his staff
Thursday and began "prioritizing" the starting pitchers other clubs
might be willing to trade before the July 31 non-waiver deadline.</LD>
<LD>   The trauma of Darryl Kile's death won't soon dissipate, but the
Cardinals lead the National League Central and there's the reality of
the race and "what we view as a responsibility to our players, fans
and Darryl to try and do everything we can to win the division and
more," Jocketty said.</LD>
<LD>   What that means, he added, is trying to find some way to
compensate for the loss of a pitcher who had never been on the
disabled list, who had thrown at least 219 innings in five of the
last six years and had gone 41-24 in his two-plus seasons with the
Cardinals. It means, he went on, trying to find some way to secure
another starter while "knowing we can never replace Darryl's innings
and leadership. He was the staff leader and our horse. He took the
ball no matter what."</LD>
<TE>   Jocketty wouldn't discuss specifics, but it can be certain that at
or near the top of the Cardinals' priority list was the name of the
Cleveland Indians' All-Star-caliber right-hander, Bartolo Colon.</TE>
<TE>   It was suspected throughout baseball that the Indians, despite
having finally developed a young ace after a decade of American
League Central dominance in which the quality of their pitching never
matched the potency of their offense, would turn around and trade him
because of their financial and competitive retreat.</TE>
<TE>   It was never suspected that the Montreal Expos, seemingly headed
toward elimination or relocation next season and controlled by the
commissioner (who seems to be doing a better job with the Expos than
his own Milwaukee Brewers), would beat the Cardinals and other
interested teams to Colon.</TE>
<TE>   They did it Thursday in a six-player trade, giving up Lee Stevens
and three prospects, including highly regarded shortstop Brandon
Phillips, for Colon, who is 10-4 and joins Javier Vazquez, Tony
Armas, Tomo Ohka and Carl Pavano in a suddenly more formidable
rotation as the Expos, alive in the wild-card and NL East races, play
for today rather than worrying about the uncertain future.</TE>
<TE>   "This definitely proves our intention," General Manager Omar
Minaya said by phone, suggesting he didn't leave an executive role
with the New York Mets to be anyone's lame duck. "We not only want to
compete, but we want to win. I said when I took the job that I was
going to do whatever I could and be as creative as possible in order
to put this team in position to win."</TE>
<TE>   The Expos are last in the majors in attendance and revenue. Colon
makes only $500,000 more than Stevens this year, tantamount to a
wash, but is owed $6 million in a club option next year. However, if
the Expos aren't operating, the option becomes another club's
obligation. If they are operating, they figure to be in a better
economic environment. A labor dispute could idle Colon and the Expos,
but Minaya said this was a no-lose situation and that he didn't need
to run it past anyone other than the club president, Tony Tavares.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what's going to happen with the club next year or if
I'll still be a general manager," Minaya said. "But we not only
improved for today, but if we're still operating five years from now,
I think this is a good baseball trade. We not only got one of the
best young pitchers in the majors, but a 24-year-old pitcher [Tim
Drew] who was a No. 1 draft choice of the Indians."</TE>
<TE>   In a remodeling that has seen the Indians also trade Roberto
Alomar and let Manny Ramirez, Juan Gonzalez and Kenny Lofton leave
through free agency, Colon is only the first of the club's midsummer
moves. Pitcher Chuck Finley and first baseman Jim Thome also figure
to be traded, with the Boston Red Sox hot after Thome.</TE>
<TE>   The Indians started the weekend having gone 25-40 after an 11-1
start, and General Manager Mark Shapiro doesn't sugarcoat the
capitulation, the fact he is now building for 2004 and '05.</TE>
<TE>   "I realize our fan base is going to take a hit," he said.
"Hopefully, by next year, when the fans can see the skeletal
framework of our new team and start identifying with the young
players we're trying to develop, maybe some will come back. [Owner]
Larry Dolan has assured us he will step up when we are ready to be a
contender again."</TE>
<TE>   In St. Louis, where the Cardinals began a weekend series against
the Cincinnati Reds with the division lead at stake, Jocketty said he
was convinced there would be pitchers available despite the labor
concerns and economic limitations affecting many clubs.</TE>
<TE>   Among the starting pitchers who could be traded, in addition to
Finley, are Detroit's Jeff Weaver, Florida's Brad Penny, Toronto's
Esteban Loaiza, Philadelphia's Robert Person and Terry Adams, and
Kenny Rogers of Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Starting pitching was expected to be a St. Louis strength, but
Jocketty sighed and said, "What's that about best-laid plans? We had
seven starters in spring training, but we haven't had five of them
together at any time since the season started."</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals have put six pitchers on the disabled list--Garrett
Stephenson and Andy Benes are currently on it--and have already used
18 pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Morris (10-5) has held up as the rotation ace, but Bud Smith,
who came up last year to go 6-3 and throw a no-hitter in San Diego,
is 0-5, and Woody Williams, 7-1 after being obtained from the Padres
last season, only recently came off the disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   Jocketty said he would hate to think where the Cardinals would be
if the unheralded Jason Simontacchi, whose failing pitching career
had taken him to Italy, hadn't won six of seven decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "What Jason has done for our pitching is what Albert Pujols did
for our offense last year," Jocketty said. "We couldn't have counted
on it."</TE>
<TE>   Now the Cardinals have to try to replace a pitcher who can't be
replaced, and one of the first options is already off the board.</TE>

<HD>These Guys Prefer October Rewards</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The American and National League All-Star teams will be revealed
today, but Eric Karros, the Dodger first baseman, and Tim Salmon, the
Angel right fielder, know they will have a three-day vacation coming
soon.</LD>
<LD>   They have never been selected for the All-Star game despite
distinguished careers. In fact, as any seamhead is probably aware, no
active player has hit more home runs than Karros (265 through Friday)
and Salmon (259) without making at least one All-Star appearance.</LD>
<LD>   If there were painful All-Star slights when they were younger,
they are linked in a different way now: Both, as Karros said, are
happy to have rebounded from injury-related poor years, regained
respectability and contributed to teams headed, perhaps, for October
rewards more satisfying than an All-Star selection.</LD>
<TE>   Salmon agreed, saying, "I've been with this team long enough, and
come up short often enough, that at this point in my career I'd
rather get to the postseason than be an All-Star. When you're young,
the thinking always is that you have a lot of years ahead of you,
it'll come. Now there are a lot of young outfielders making names for
themselves and are more familiar with the voters. I realize that [an
All-Star selection] may not happen, but other things are more
important. We're both on teams with good chemistry putting together
good years."</TE>
<TE>   There is no disputing the improved chemistry.</TE>
<TE>   On the Dodgers, Gary Sheffield is gone, replaced by a genuine
leader in Brian Jordan. Karros credits Chairman Bob Daly and General
Manager Dan Evans for the character adjustment, saying of Jordan's
role, in particular: "He came as advertised. He could be hitting zero
and it wouldn't change that opinion."</TE>
<TE>   Nor, Karros said, are any of the Dodgers star struck, or stuck on
stardom. He put it this way: "Shawn Green is our one real star, and
he acts as if he's carrying a backpack around a college campus."</TE>
<TE>   Strike Date</TE>
<TE>   Union officials will meet with player representatives from the 30
teams in Chicago on July 8 to discuss a possible strike date, but the
spreading opinion among players seems to be that if a date is set at
all, it will be set for late September rather than in August, as
often speculated because of the August walkout in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   The union believes a strike date beneficial in creating pressure
to reach a decision at the bargaining table and providing a weapon if
convinced the owners plan to declare an impasse and unilaterally
implement new work rules.</TE>
<TE>   However, a September date provides more time for bargaining,
allows the players to receive almost their entire salaries for the
year and, although permitting the owners to receive almost a full
season of attendance, hits them hardest financially because--in the
event of a walkout at that point--it would require them to return
postseason TV revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is hard to measure numbers, sources say that a
reasonably large number of players lean toward setting no strike
date, putting the onus on the owners to reach a settlement or face a
public relations backlash.</TE>
<TE>   The Appraisal</TE>
<TE>   The baseball jury is still out on Donald Watkins' finances, but he
could be doing Disney a favor if he is successful in getting Disney
to lower its sale price on the Angels from $250 million to $200
million. At the latter figure, several other prospective buyers might
jump in, including, it is believed, Peter Ueberroth.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, Odalis</TE>
<TE>   Raving about Dodger pitching as he left Dodger Stadium Thursday
night after his Colorado Rockies had lost three of four games,
Manager Clint Hurdle provided the Angels with something of a dire
scouting report for their confrontation with Odalis Perez tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of a slow death," Hurdle said, his Rockies having been
victimized by Perez's second one-hitter of the year. "It's not like
he blows you down like Randy Johnson. He comes at you quietly, and
before you know it you have no pulse."</TE>
<TE>   The Real Raul</TE>
<TE>   Borrowing the script from his expletive-laced tirade at Davey
Johnson and Kevin Malone, when they were all with the Dodgers four
years ago, Toronto's Raul Mondesi blasted his manager, Carlos Tosca,
and elevated his position on the trading block after he was benched
Tuesday and Wednesday for reporting 10 minutes late to a team
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Tosca, who may only be keeping the managerial seat warm for
Oakland A's bench coach Ken Macha, insists that the Blue Jays play by
his rules or they don't play.</TE>
<TE>   That was too much for Mondesi, who said, "I play too hard in this
game every ... day to have this ... happen to me. Now he try to be
like too big. He only have two weeks in the big leagues. He never
play professional. Why does he have to be like that with an everyday
player for no reason. The same ... happened in L.A."</TE>
<TE>   Mondesi began the weekend hitting .221. Pretty ... bad.</TE>
<TE>   Lineup Change?</TE>
<TE>   Interleague play ends today, with attendance up about 16% over the
intraleague average, but San Diego Padre General Manager Kevin Towers
has a reasonable suggestion that would enable fans to get an even
better feel for how the game in the other league is played.</TE>
<TE>   Towers favors a rules change that would reverse the current setup
and have the designated hitter employed in interleague games in
National League parks but no DH in American League parks.</TE>
<TE>   "That way the fans of each league could really taste a game
they're not used to seeing," reasoned Towers.</TE>

<HD>Gonzalez Stops Young After Eight Rounds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID CARRILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Julio Gonzalez of Huntington Beach appears to have completed the
transformation from a sluggish fighter that Roy Jones Jr. used as a
punching bag last July into a more agile one Saturday night before
3,732 at the Arrowhead Pond.</LD>
<LD>   Gonzalez used quick right hooks to swell Jonathan Young's eyes
before referee Marty Denkin stopped the light-heavyweight bout after
the eighth round because Young was having trouble with his vision.
Gonzalez, 25, improved to 30-1 with 20 knockouts after winning his
third fight in a row since dropping his first career fight, a
unanimous decision to Jones at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   "I realized how slow I was when I fought Jones," Gonzalez said.
"I've been working on a lot of speed workouts ever since then and now
I feel like I'm twice as fast."</LD>
<TE>   Gonzalez went to work on Young (10-5-2) midway through the seventh
round. He recorded a knockdown after connecting with right-handed
uppercuts to the head.</TE>
<TE>   The semi-main event featured Brazil's Kelson Pinto against Bell's
Dagoberto Najera in a super-lightweight fight, with Pinto (12-0)
winning a unanimous decision over Najera (15-4). In other bouts,
Anaheim's Javier Mora (14-0-1, 13) recorded a second-round knockout
against Leroy Humphries (3-4-1) of Austin, Texas, San Pedro's Raul
Torres (1-2) won a four-round split-decision against Mexico's Aldo
Merino in a welterweight bout, and Robert Ortiz of Simi Valley won a
unanimous decision over Jose Luis Torres of Canoga Park in a
featherweight bout.</TE>

<HD>Reds Benefit From Pujols' Error in Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Albert Pujols handed the Cincinnati Reds a victory, evening their
weekend National League Central showdown with the St. Louis Cardinals
at a game apiece.</LD>
<LD>   Pujols dropped a routine fly ball in left field in the seventh
inning, allowing the Reds to score the go-ahead run in a 4-2 victory
that cut the Cardinals' lead to one game.</LD>
<LD>   "You know, it happens," Pujols said. "It can happen to Albert
Pujols and it can happen to the best. It was the wrong time to
happen."</LD>
<TE>   Todd Walker lofted a pop-up to medium left with two out in the
seventh, and the ball glanced off the glove of Pujols, who had been
camped under it for several seconds. Pujols looked at his glove as if
it had betrayed him before retrieving the ball as Jason LaRue scored
from second for a 3-2 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The error was Pujols' second in 41 starts in left field, and first
fielding error. Walker said the ball he hit was a slider down the
middle that he usually would hit to center.</TE>
<TE>   "I cut into it and hit it to left, so it had a lot of spin on it,"
Walker said. "That being said, you don't expect an outfielder to miss
it. So we got a gift."</TE>
<TE>   Pinch-hitter Barry Larkin's sacrifice fly off Mike Matthews had
tied it, and Aaron Boone gave the Reds a two-run lead with an RBI
single, also off Matthews. Luther Hackman (1-3) gave up a single to
LaRue, the only batter he faced.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a weird game," Manager Tony La Russa said. "It's one of
those games where there's not a whole lot to say. It could have
turned out better, that's for sure."</TE>
<TE>   Juan Encarnacion hit his second homer in as many games and 16th of
the season for the Reds, who have won four of five after losing eight
in a row. Encarnacion was three for four and is 16 for 34 (.471) in
the last 10 games.</TE>
<TE>   "This game is completely full of ups and downs," Walker said. "The
one saying you learn quick in baseball is you never get too low and
you never get too high when things are good. We do a good job of
that."</TE>
<TE>   Elmer Dessens (5-4) gave up two runs and six hits in six innings,
winning for the first time in five starts since June 2. In three
starts against the Cardinals, he is 1-0 with a 3.70 earned-run
average. He said he threw more changeups and curveballs than in the
past.</TE>
<TE>   "The best thing was I kept the team in the game," Dessens said.
"That's very important."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Edmonds and Eli Marrero homered for the Cardinals, who went 41
innings without giving up a long ball before Marrero connected in the
fifth. Edmonds also robbed the Reds of a run with a diving catch of
Walker's sinking liner to center in the fifth, easily doubling LaRue
off second.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonds was two for three with a bunt single in the first and a
sixth-inning home run.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL-DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Anderson Makes a Strong Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin, Jason Reid and Gary Klein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The All-Star teams will be announced today, and Garret Anderson
believes his name ought to be called.</LD>
<LD>   "You can't tell me the numbers aren't good enough," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Anderson, the Angels' left fielder and cleanup hitter, is in his
eighth season and has never made an All-Star team. He is hitting .301
with 15 home runs and 59 runs batted in. He leads the American League
in doubles, leads all AL outfielders in extra-base hits and ranks
second among AL outfielders in hits, RBIs, total bases and slugging
percentage.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know of too many outfielders that have better numbers
across the board. I'm not disrespecting [Seattle's] Ichiro [Suzuki],
[Minnesota's Torii] Hunter and [Boston's Johnny] Damon, but when you
look across the board, my numbers speak loud," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   "Mo [Vaughn] always told me, put your numbers up. That's basically
what I've done. In that respect, yeah, I think I should go."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are believed to have discussed a trade for Toronto
closer Kelvim Escobar, whom they would use as a setup man for Troy
Percival.</TE>
<TE>   Escobar, 26, is 4-4 with a 4.70 earned-run average, 13 saves and
39 strikeouts in 36 innings. He makes $2.3 million, so the Angels
could pay him half that for half the season. He is not eligible for
free agency this fall.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Jays, who traded designated hitter Brad Fullmer to the
Angels in a salary dump for pitcher Brian Cooper, are willing to do
the same with Escobar. The Blue Jays want a pitching prospect or two
in return, and the Angels have plenty to offer.</TE>
<TE>   As the Angels continue their search for pitching help, they appear
more inclined to add a reliever than a starter.</TE>
<TE>   When a rival general manager talks trade with the Angels' Bill
Stoneman, the first question usually is, "How about John Lackey?" The
Angels have no plans to trade Lackey, 23, who makes his second major
league start tonight.</TE>
<TE>   The Detroit Tigers are shopping ace Jeff Weaver, although the
Angels might have to package Lackey with two other prospects to get
him. Weaver, 25, is 6-8 with a 3.18 ERA this season, the first of a
four-year, $22-million contract. In three career starts at Edison
Field, his ERA is 1.17.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers have a scout in Anaheim this weekend. At this time, the
Angels and Tigers are not believed to have discussed a trade for
Weaver.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger Manager Jim Tracy apparently couldn't contain himself any
longer with the Dodgers back where they believe they belong, praising
the organization for making all the right off-season moves.</TE>
<TE>   He singled out General Manager Dan Evans for sticking with his
plan to improve the club despite industry and media criticism of his
decisions and methods, saying he knew Evans was pushing the right
buttons and now everyone else does too.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the decisions that have been made here the last couple of
years were looked at with eyes rolling," he said. "Some moves were
looked at with statements that followed to the extent of, 'Can you
believe that one!' And that's fine.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's obvious that our general manager had a lot of other
things in mind at the times some of those deals were made. It's
obvious that there was a plan in place that was going to be followed.
It's time to seriously tip your cap to Danny Evans, with some of the
things he's done."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy points to the acquisitions of left-handers Kazuhisa Ishii
and Odalis Perez, left fielder Brian Jordan and center fielder Dave
Roberts as proof that Evans was on top of his game last winter while
many thought the Dodgers were still rudderless.</TE>
<TE>   "People were very critical of a lot of decisions that were made,"
Tracy said, "and they had the right to be. But you can't let that
[affect] your decision-making. You have to hold firm in your belief
that this is the direction we need to head in."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger left-hander Omar Daal is nursing a slight left groin strain
and will throw a bullpen session today to determine his fitness for
Tuesday's scheduled start against the Arizona Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   If Daal feels discomfort, the Dodgers could start Terry Mulholland
or Guillermo Mota or possibly recall Kevin Beirne, Robert Ellis or
Ricardo Rodriguez from the minor leagues.</TE>
<TE>   Daal, who missed a start earlier this month because of biceps
tendinitis, gave up one run and four hits in six innings Thursday in
the Dodgers' 7-1 victory over the Colorado Rockies.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Lo Duca Has Close Bond With Scioscia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As his major-league aspirations with the Dodgers stalled, catcher
Paul Lo Duca once envisioned playing home games at Edison Field for
Angel Manager Mike Scioscia.</LD>
<LD>   Scioscia was the Dodgers' minor league catching coordinator in Lo
Duca's early professional seasons and they shared mutual admiration.
When Scioscia was hired as manager of the Angels before the 2000
season, Lo Duca still was not regarded as an everyday player in the
big leagues and was ready for a change of scenery.</LD>
<LD>   "I've admitted it, I wanted to be traded here a couple of years
ago and I wanted to come where Scioscia was coming," Lo Duca said
before the start of the weekend's interleague series at Anaheim.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers floated Lo Duca's name in trade proposals with several
teams but never pulled the trigger.</TE>
<TE>   When Jim Tracy replaced Davey Johnson as manager before last
season, he selected Lo Duca as his starting catcher and Lo Duca
responded by batting .325 with 25 home runs and 90 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Dan Evans, who was hired to replace Kevin Malone
on Oct. 3, 2001, is happy that Scioscia was so high on Lo Duca before
he left the organization.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really glad they didn't make a big mistake and move him
because to me he's one of the most important players on our club on
and off the field," Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia said he never questioned Lo Duca's ability to hit major
league pitching. And after watching Lo Duca in spring training in the
mid-1990s, he said he knew Lo Duca could eventually catch it as well.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some players who light your eyes up with their tools
and there are some that light up your eyes with their makeup and
ability to play--and play far above what their tools dictate they
might do," Scioscia said. "When Paul first started to catch, there
were some rough edges. But I think once I saw his work and how good
his hands were and that he was going to work to make himself
proficient to be a catcher, there was no doubt he could play in the
big leagues."</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca, who signed with the Dodgers out of Arizona State in 1993,
played at double-A San Antonio in 1995. It was Scioscia who advised
the Dodger brass to send Lo Duca back to Class-A Vero Beach the
following season so he could catch every day.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca, who signed a three-year, $7-million contract in February,
is continuing to develop into one of the top catchers in the National
League. Before Saturday's game, he was batting .319 with four homers
and 36 RBIs. Lo Duca went 0 for 3 in the Dodgers' 7-0 loss.</TE>
<TE>   "He could always hit, and it's his heart, desire and work ethic
that pushed him up to a level of all-star caliber," Scioscia said.</TE>

<HD>America Gets Past River Plate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first two meetings this year between Club America of Mexico and
River Plate of Argentina were tight affairs, so why should the
exhibition match Saturday night at the Coliseum have been any
different?</LD>
<LD>   Well, while Club America, which is preparing for the semifinals of
the South American-based club tournament Copa Libertadores, brought
its entire team, River Plate had few familiar faces.</LD>
<LD>   The result: a 2-1 victory for Club America, champion of the
Mexican first division summer tournament, over River Plate, winner of
the Argentine closing tournament.</LD>
<TE>   In front of a heavily pro-Club America crowd of 19,793, Las
Aguilas delighted their fans by scoring first, in the 21st minute.</TE>
<TE>   America forward Ivan Zamorano, closing in from the right flank,
lofted a high pass to the left of the penalty box, just over the head
of teammate Christian Patino.</TE>
<TE>   With River Plate goalkeeper Jose Buljusavich giving chase, Patino
gained control of the ball and lobbed a pass back to the middle of
the box, where forward Reinaldo Navia headed it home.</TE>
<TE>   Club America scored its second goal in the 75th minute when Manuel
Rioss, on a breakaway opportunity, found Hugo Norberto Castillo
drifting in from the left side.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo, who had entered the game 19 minutes earlier, deposited
Rioss' pass into the net for the score.</TE>
<TE>   River Plate's goal came in the 90th minute, with five seconds
remaining in regulation, when Maximiliano Lopez drilled a shot past
goalkeeper Adolfo Rios on a broken play in front of the net.</TE>
<TE>   The teams' previous two meetings this year were a 1-0 Club America
victory at Buenos Aires on Feb. 28 and a scoreless draw at Mexico
City on March 13.</TE>

<LD>Astra did what she was supposed to do in the $250,000 Beverly Hills
Handicap, winning at 2-5 and becoming the fourth back-to-back winner
in the Grade I race.</LD>
<LD>   It was far from easy, however.</LD>
<LD>   Peu a Peu, the 7-1 second choice, made Astra work through the
final quarter of a mile, but the classy mare prevailed for the 11th
time in 15 starts.</LD>
<TE>   The 124-pound highweight for the family of the late Allen Paulson
and trainer Laura De Seroux, Astra won by a neck under jockey Kent
Desormeaux, completing the 1 1/4 miles in 1:58 2/5. The final two
furlongs were run in a rapid 23 2/5 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "Last time [in her win in the Gamely on May 27], I might have sat
too long," Desormeaux said. "This time, I may have moved too soon. I
don't know, but she keeps getting me there first.</TE>
<TE>   "That is the bottom line and it's all Astra. She definitely saw
[Peu a Peu] coming."</TE>
<TE>   A winner of the Yerba Buena Breeders' Cup Handicap at Bay Meadows
on May 18 in her U.S. debut for trainer Bobby Frankel and owner Gary
Tanaka, Peu a Peu, who was getting eight pounds (124-116), finished
five lengths clear of Crazy Ensign, the 7-1 third choice.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jockey Jerry Bailey swept the graded stakes at Belmont Park,
winning the $242,500 Mother Goose with Nonsuch Bay and the $106,600
Tremont with favored Zavata.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Joseph Platt Jr. and trained by Frank Alexander, Nonsuch
Bay, the 5-2 second choice, rallied from last to beat 6-5 favorite
Chamrousse by 1 1/2 lengths in 1:49 for the 1 1/8 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Zavata, a 2-year-old son of Phone Trick, won for the second time
in three starts for owner Michael Tabor and trainer Patrick Biancone.</TE>
<TE>   The 1-2 favorite, Zavata completed the 5 1/2 furlongs in 1:02 3/5
while beating 5-2 second choice Hussar by 6 1/4 lengths.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Atelier, an 8-1 longshot, won the $300,000 Molly Pitcher Breeders'
Cup Handicap, beating 7-10 favorite Summer Colony by a length at
Monmouth Park. Spain, who was seeking her third consecutive stakes
win, was third in the field of five as the 6-5 second choice.</TE>

<HD>Boycott Is a Threat to Card</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Upset over the increasing cost of workman's compensation insurance,
some trainers boycotted the entry box at Hollywood Park Saturday
morning, so there were insufficient entries for Wednesday's card.
Reportedly, only about 10 horses were entered.</LD>
<LD>   An estimated 60 trainers met with officials from Hollywood Park,
Del Mar, Santa Anita and the Thoroughbred Owners of California
Saturday morning seeking support, but apparently weren't completely
satisfied with the proposals presented.</LD>
<LD>   Ed Halpern, the executive director of the California Thoroughbred
Trainers, said another meeting is scheduled for this morning at
Hollywood Park.</LD>
<TE>   "Hopefully, everybody will come to a mutual understanding,"
Halpern said. "Something is going to be done about this at some
point. How we get it done is the question."</TE>
<TE>   He said any boycott was not endorsed by the CTT, but rather was
the decision of individual trainers.</TE>
<TE>   Before Halpern said another meeting had been scheduled, Hollywood
Park issued a statement saying that entries for Wednesday and
Thursday will be taken today and that the entry box would remain open
until 2 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The release went on to say that if racing has to be canceled
Wednesday because of a lack of entries, those races won't be offered
again and that the racing office, where entries are taken, will be
closed Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Baedeker, the president of Hollywood Park, said all involved
are working on two plans, both of which are likely to be in place by
Aug. 1, but trainers are looking for immediate help. Some trainers
have policies with private insurance companies that expire after
today.</TE>

<LD>Mountain Rage is not the only well-regarded 3-year-old turf runner in
trainer Bob Baffert's barn. Regiment, a son of Outflanker, who is a
son of Danzig, has won four in a row and will try to extend his
streak in the $200,000 Cinema Breeders' Cup Handicap at Hollywood
Park.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Prince Ahmed Salman's Thoroughbred Corp., Regiment earned
his first win sprinting on the main track when breaking his maiden
March 17 at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   Switched to the grass for his next start, he sprinted to a
three-length win at Santa Anita, stretched out for an allowance win
at Hollywood Park, then earned his first stakes victory in the
$200,000 Diamond A USA Stakes in Texas last month.</LD>
<TE>   The 122-pound highweight, he will be ridden by regular companion
David Flores and will break from the inside. He will be coupled in
the wagering with Johar, who is also owned by the Thoroughbred Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The one to beat in the Grade III Cinema, at 1 1/8 miles on the
turf, is Inesperado. Owned by 3 Plus U Stable and trained by Bobby
Frankel, the French-bred won four of nine in his native land and has
trained well for his first start since March 12.</TE>
<TE>   The Cinema field is completed by Point Prince, Sunkosi, Mananan
McLir and Gobi Dan.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Super Quercus, who has two Grade I victories on
the Hollywood Park turf, is scheduled to make his first start of 2002
in the seventh, a $62,000 optional claimer at 1 1/4 miles on the
grass. His trainer, Frankel, also entered Lord Flasheart. Other
contenders include Slew The Red, Sumati and Little Ghazi.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Alex Solis. The jockey won four races Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Arizona's Anderson Looks Right at Home</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brian Anderson left more than 40 tickets at the box office for family
and friends who came to see him pitch his homecoming at Jacobs Field.</LD>
<LD>   He wasn't nearly as generous to the Cleveland Indians.</LD>
<LD>   Anderson dominated his hometown team--and the one he spent two
seasons with--for 7 1/3 innings and led the Arizona Diamondbacks to a
4-2 win Saturday night.</LD>
<TE>   "I had a lot of jitters," said Anderson, whose last appearance at
Jacobs Field was in Game 4 of the 1997 World Series for the Indians.
"When I got to the mound, I was like, 'Whoa, this is going to be
fun.' It was a special night."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson (3-7) gave up four hits and faced only two over the
minimum in his longest outing this season. After giving up a homer to
Jim Thome in the second, he retired 13 in a row and 19 of the last 21
he faced before being replaced in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   By then, he had thrown only 75 pitches, but the emotion of the
game had taken its toll and Anderson told Arizona Manager Bob Brenly
he was through.</TE>
<TE>   "When Brian said he felt like he threw 100 pitches, that made it a
little easier," Brenly said.</TE>
<TE>   Byung-Hyun Kim, who gave up a walkoff grand slam earlier this week
in a loss at Houston, loaded the bases in the ninth before striking
out Travis Fryman and Milton Bradley for his 20th save.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 2, Boston 1--Kevin Millwood struck out 10 before leaving
with a blister in the sixth inning and the Braves won at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Sheffield's two-run homer in the third was enough offense for
the Braves to improve to 11-3 in Fenway Park and 2-0 there this
season.</TE>
<TE>   John Smoltz got his 27th save in 30 chances and second in the
series.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 8, Colorado 1--Freddy Garcia, making a strong bid to be
included on the AL All-Star team, gave up six hits in eight innings
and the Mariners hit three home runs to win at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia (11-5) retired 10 of the first 11 batters he faced, hitting
Larry Walker with a pitch in the first inning. He then retired eight
in a row before walking Walker in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago White Sox 5, Chicago Cubs 4--Carlos Lee hit a solo homer,
and Frank Thomas homered and drove in three runs as the White Sox
defeated their crosstown rival Cubs at Comiskey Park.</TE>
<TE>   Moises Alou went four for four and homered twice for the first
time in more than a year, but it wasn't enough to keep the Cubs from
dropping their fifth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 5, Montreal 4--Eric Hinske hit a game-winning home run in
the 10th inning as the Blue Jays rallied at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Hinske, who homered off former Dodger Matt Herges (2-2), went
three for five for the Blue Jays, who came back from a 4-1 deficit in
the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 3, Tampa Bay 2--Cliff Floyd homered for the third time in
four games, breaking a sixth-inning tie as the Marlins won at St.
Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Preston Wilson also homered and right-hander Julian Tavarez (6-4)
gave up two runs and seven hits in 6 1/3 innings to improve to 4-1 in
June.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 10, Minnesota 2--Matt Stairs homered twice and Jose
Cabrera pitched six strong innings to lead the Brewers at
Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Stairs went three for four with a solo homer in the second inning
and a two-run shot in the fifth. Paul Bako also had three hits with a
homer and three runs batted in for the Brewers, who ended a six-game
interleague losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 2, Pittsburgh 1--Jeff Weaver pitched 7 2/3 sharp innings
at Detroit to help the Tigers end a four-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Weaver (6-8) gave up one run and seven hits, walked one and hit a
batter. He struck out four. Juan Acevedo got the final out in the
eighth, and pitched an eventful ninth, striking out Jack Wilson with
the bases loaded for his 12th save.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 8, Kansas City 4--Ron Gant, in a one-for-15 skid, hit a
grand slam off Dan Reichert in the 10th to power the Padres at Kansas
City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 11, Philadelphia 1--Gary Matthews Jr. had a career-high
five hits, including a two-run homer, and Jason Johnson pitched a
six-hitter as the Orioles won at Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 8, Texas 5--Lance Berkman hit a three-run home run, and
Geoff Blum had a two-run homer to rally the Astros, who trailed 5-0,
at Arlington, Texas.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After losing by a nose at 83-1 to Chiarascuro in the California
Challenge Championship on June 1, Pure D Cool will be a considerably
shorter price tonight in the $15,000 Avison Handicap.</LD>
<LD>   A 4-year-old gelding trained by Connie Hall for owner Rancho
Davalos, Pure D Cool has only won once in 18 starts, but he nearly
pulled the major upset four weeks ago. Finishing a head behind him
was the well-regarded Dashing Knud.</LD>
<LD>   Stretching to 550 yards in the Avison, the eighth of nine races on
the card, Pure D Cool is the 9-5 favorite and will again be ridden by
Carlos Bautista.</LD>
<TE>   In the preceding race, Ddf De Great Saiga will try for her sixth
consecutive victory in the $15,000 Prissy Fein Handicap at 350 yards.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Good To Be King. 2. Stamp N' Pirate. 3. Lucky Red
Hot. 4. Ghaffir. 5. Corona Man. 6. Mucho Caliente. 7. Ddf De Great
Saiga. 8. Pure D Cool. 9. A Blurr.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Good To Be King and Straw Poll in the first, use Stamp
N' Pirate and Fat Tuesday in the second, Lucky Red Hot and Sheza Easy
Pleaser in the third and Ghaffir and the entry of Unknown Dame-Home
Bird in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Sheza Easy Pleaser drops in class in the third
in her first start outside Ruidoso. Rustys Quickid lost all chance in
her latest and could be the one to surprise in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Post time: 5:30 p.m.</TE>

<LD>Sam Hornish Jr. blew past Gil de Ferran on the inside of the first
turn with less than two laps to go Saturday night and handed the
vaunted Penske team a bitter loss in the SunTrust Indy Challenge IRL
race at Richmond, Va.</LD>
<LD>   Hornish, never a factor until the end, passed Felipe Giaffone for
second in the same spot on the 246th lap, then reeled in De Ferran.
Hornish finally got underneath De Ferran in the front straightaway,
pulling ahead entering the first turn and racing away to win by
1.8323 seconds.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't know I could pass him until I did," Hornish said.</LD>
<TE>   It was the defending series champion's sixth victory all-time and
third this season, and came at the expense of one of the Penske
teams, which have dominated the IRL in their first season since
coming over from CART.</TE>
<TE>   De Ferran, who led 168 of the 250 laps, held on to finish second.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 22 cars that started, only 13 were running at the end. The
race was slowed by eight caution flags that covered 94 laps, but
ended with 55 laps of green-flag racing, the longest segment of clean
racing all night.</TE>
<TE>   Points leader Helio Castroneves was the first to crash, losing his
grip coming out of Turn 2 on the eighth lap and hitting the inside
wall. The crash put Castroneves behind the wall for 150 laps, but he
returned.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dario Franchitti posted the fastest lap for today's CART Chicago
Grand Prix at 158.118 mph Saturday at Cicero, Ill., giving him his
first pole on an oval track in four years.... IRL president Tony
George expects to rule late this week or early next week on the
appeal of the disputed finish of the Indianapolis 500.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Terry Cook took advantage of a race-extending caution at West
Allis, Wis., passing Jason Leffler with less than two laps remaining
to win the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series GNC Live Well 200.... Greg
Biffle won the pole for the Busch Series' GNC Live Well 250 at West
Allis, Wis.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tony Bruncati of Glendora and Rip Michels of Mission Hills split
the twin 50-lap Jani-King Super Late Model series feature races in
front of 6,500 at Irwindale Speedway, the first sellout of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Adler won the 50-lap Ultra Wheels Super Truck series feature,
and Roger Carufel Jr. won the 35-lap Grand American Modified series
feature.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Josh Larsen of Monrovia, starting dead last with a 70-yard

<KH>Mark Heisler ON THE NBA</KH>
<HD>Draft Is More Pomp Than Circumstance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What if they held a draft and no one understood it?</LD>
<LD>   The NBA does now, every spring. Everyone knows it has
changed--it's all kids, international players and now, international
kids--but people are having a problem dealing with the implications.</LD>
<LD>   I'm not talking about sportswriters and TV talking heads. I'm
talking about owners and general managers.</LD>
<TE>   The reality is that while there are many talented players
available, you'll have to wait years for them to emerge ... but it's
still the way to go.</TE>
<TE>   There's little immediate help and none after the top picks. After
the top four in this draft, the next six were 19-year-olds. The teens
had breathtaking potential, not that all the GMs were interested.</TE>
<TE>   The Knicks, for example, say straight out, this is New York, we
can't rebuild. This is a problem when they find themselves with no
team, no young players and no cap room.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are teams like the Chicago Bulls. Last spring, they
went all-out for potential, trading Elton Brand so they could get not
one, but two high school centers.</TE>
<TE>   That was fine, except by midseason, people around the team were
moaning how slowly it was going, voicing fears that if the Bulls
weren't back soon, the NBA would die in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Swell. One day you're running off your old dynasty, which is on a
three-title winning streak. Three years later, you don't like the
pace of rebuilding from scratch.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe you should have thought this through a little earlier?</TE>
<TE>   Check out the current Lakers. The NBA is, was and always will be
about great players. The new reality is, to get them, you have to
gamble on them when they're babies, like the 17-year-old Kobe Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   The winners aren't the teams that gain a slight advantage in the
draft but the ones that date their turnaround to it when they look
back in three or four years.</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind ...</TE>
<TE>   THE WINNERS</TE>
<TE>   * Houston. These days you're hyped one day and derided the next
when they learn you're not really the next Shaquille O'Neal (who was
also built up and torn down in his early years in the league).</TE>
<TE>   People now think of Yao Ming as the next Shawn Bradley or, at
best, Rik Smits, but he's 50 pounds heavier than Bradley and much
more athletic than Smits.</TE>
<TE>   Says Clipper draftee Melvin Ely, who worked out against Yao: "He's
not a stiff. He can move and that surprised me."</TE>
<TE>   Smits had to catch up to the speed of the game, but he became a
force. Yao has to catch up too, but he should be a bigger force, at
least.</TE>
<TE>   * Chicago. Luckily for the game in the Windy City, the Bulls got
Jay Williams, the one bona fide, instant-impact guy.</TE>
<TE>   He got the build-up/tear-down ride too. Enthusiasm really ebbed
when he missed a key free throw in Duke's NCAA tournament exit and
measured only 6 feet 1/4 in the pre-draft camp. In real life, he's a
little tank, a crack shot and should be a star from Day One. If Tyson
Chandler keeps coming, they'll be back in the playoffs soon enough.</TE>
<TE>   * Denver. People said nice guy GM Kiki Vandeweghe was overmatched,
but he moved Antonio McDyess, who would have walked next summer, and
wound up with two of the draft's most intriguing prospects, Nikoloz
Tskitishvili and Nene Hilario.</TE>
<TE>   Said Tskitishvili's Italian League coach, Mike D'Antoni: "When you
see him work out, your jaw kind of drops."</TE>
<TE>   After working out against the 6-9, 250-pound Hilario, Curtis
Borchardt called him "awesome." Jamal Sampson called him "a beast."</TE>
<TE>   Both will take a while, but the Nuggets have nothing better to do
than wait.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, they'll have an entry in the LeBron James Derby.</TE>
<TE>   * Phoenix. Amare Stoudemire, the prep the Suns grabbed at No. 9,
could miss, but he also could be the tiger they have always needed
and never had.</TE>
<TE>   * Portland. Trader Bob Whitsitt, the NBA's Go-For-It champion,
jumped on Qyntel Woods, who went from the next Tracy McGrady to
pariah when people decided he was a problem child. On the other hand,
how many shots at greatness do you get at No. 21?</TE>
<TE>   * Lakers. Nice sleight of hand by Mitch Kupchak, dumping Lindsey
Hunter's contract and getting Kareem Rush. There are questions about
Rush--motivation?--but he's some prospect to get when you're starting
at No. 27.</TE>
<TE>   * Clippers. Despite Donald T. Sterling's high jinks, there was no
way they wouldn't help themselves with two lottery picks, even if
they only took players to deal them.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers are past the potential-accumulating stage and into
the making-it-work era, which requires an actual grown-up point
guard. The Hornets, who have to impress their new fans in New
Orleans, may take Baron Davis off the market, but the Clippers can
still have Andre Miller--if Sterling will take him.</TE>
<TE>   Sterling pronounced Darius Miles an untouchable, but let's see
what he says next spring when he's up for an extension ... with
Quentin Richardson  ... and Lamar Odom and Corey Maggette are
restricted free agents. If Miles, Richardson, Maggette and/or Odom
conclude the money won't be there for them, there goes their nice
chemistry.</TE>
<TE>   Sterling has never understood that everything he does, or more
commonly, shrinks from doing, sends signals, which can be
constructive (in theory) or destructive (see: Clipper history).</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for all concerned, he has never learned anything
about the NBA, except that this is his team and he can do what he
wants with it.</TE>
<TE>   ???????????</TE>
<TE>   * New York. The Knicks are consistent, if delusional. They don't
rebuild, not even when fortune dumps Hilario in their lap, they patch
on the fly.</TE>
<TE>   They're now congratulating themselves on getting McDyess, but they
gave up Marcus Camby as well as Hilario--in other words, two big
players for one--and are still, as Coach Don Chaney noted, "very
small, especially at center."</TE>
<TE>   When the dancing stops, they may notice even a goal as modest as
making the playoff is problematic. They have to get over the eight
teams that got in this season plus Milwaukee, Washington and Miami,
who finished Nos. 9, 10 and 11.</TE>
<TE>   The New York tabloids, of course, live in The Now and worry about
The Later later.</TE>
<TE>   Wrote the New York Daily News' Mike Lupica: "This is the best
night the Knicks have had in a while, a great night if Antonio
McDyess stands up in New York."</TE>
<TE>   Not that it's popular, but there's a longer view. Wrote the News'
Mitch Lawrence: "As much as the Knicks need to be torn down and
rebuilt from the ground up, it's never going to happen as long as
[Madison Square Garden president] James Dolan is in charge....
Selling tickets and maintaining the Garden's phony sellout streak is
always placed above what really matters. Winning."</TE>
<TE>   * Golden State. In need of a turnaround after years of
hopelessness, the Warriors made the safe pick, Mike Dunleavy, a nice
player but, perhaps, a complementary one.</TE>
<TE>   * Cleveland. Nice backcourt, Miller and DaJuan Wagner. The
Cavaliers had better hope Sterling will take Miller. Otherwise, Andre
will have to go somewhere else, for a lot less.</TE>
<TE>   Faces and Figures</TE>
<TE>   I hate when that happens: I waited three years until Michael
Olowokandi was starting to happen, to remind our J.A. Adande and
Steve Springer they wrote the Clippers should draft Mike Bibby,
instead. Then, to my horror as well as the Lakers', Bibby turned into
a monster. If Olowokandi keeps coming, it may still be arguable but
there's no doubt Bibby is big-time. OK, you guys aren't really
bozos.... Toronto's 6-11 Keon Clark, a restricted free agent, is set
to take bids. The Raptors, $1 million under the projected tax
threshold, would have to go $3.5 million above it to keep him, and
there are reports Clark and Vince Carter don't get along. The Knicks
want him, but Clark's agent told the New York Post Keon's looking at
warm weather and no state tax. In other words, Florida or Texas....
And a big welcome for y'all: Noted NFL Saints' owner Tom Benson of
the Hornets' prospects: "In good times, we have a hard time selling
40,000 [season] tickets, where most clubs in larger communities sell
out every game before the season starts." ... Badeeya, badeeya,
badeeya, that's all folks.</TE>

<HD>Lackey Could Provide Big Boost</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Kevin Appier is "a little inconsistent right now," Angel Manager Mike
Scioscia said. Ramon Ortiz "has struggled at times with his pitch
selection and is not aggressive with his fastball." Aaron Sele "has
gotten the ball up." Scott Schoeneweis is in the bullpen because the
balls he threw kept getting hit. Hard. And often.</LD>
<LD>   Scioscia says his pitching staff isn't in a slump and isn't a
concern. He says John Lackey doesn't need to be a shot of adrenaline.
"We're not at that point," Scioscia says.</LD>
<LD>   But the big, tall, strong-armed, soft-spoken, startlingly
confident Lackey, a 23-year-old fastballer from Abilene, Texas, could
be the kind of double shot of espresso the Angel pitching staff can
use.</LD>
<TE>   Lackey is getting his second big-league start tonight against the
Dodgers. In his first start last week, Lackey wasn't flustered when
Alex Rodriguez hit a 433-foot home run off his fastball in the first
inning.</TE>
<TE>   "That might bother some young pitchers," Angel pitching coach Bud
Black said. "Not this kid. I like his makeup."</TE>
<TE>   The next batter, Juan Gonzalez, struck out. "I was mad at myself
but didn't lose confidence," Lackey said. "I know I can pitch."</TE>
<TE>   The teams that stick around division races and challenge for
playoff spots find help in unlikely places.</TE>
<TE>   Starting for the Dodgers will be Odalis Perez, considered by some
the throw-in part of the Gary Sheffield-Brian Jordan trade. Perez is
9-3 with a 2.33 earned-run average and is looking very much the part
of staff ace with Kevin Brown on the disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   Lackey is not about to become the ace. But only Ortiz and Jarrod
Washburn have been reliable Angel starters lately. In July the Angels
have five games against Oakland, six against Seattle, three against
the Red Sox and two against Minnesota. All these teams are division
leaders or close to it. All these teams can hit.</TE>
<TE>   For a young pitcher with a live arm and an unbending will, this is
an excellent opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   In Abilene, Lackey was the consummate athlete. He was the starting
quarterback and captain of the football team, the starting center on
the basketball team and the all-state player at first base for the
baseball team. He never had time to sit back and learn how to pitch
and not just whip the ball as hard as he could toward the plate.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't pitch but 14 innings or so in high school," Lackey says.
"The football coach didn't want me to hurt my arm."</TE>
<TE>   Lackey played a year at University of Texas Arlington, where he
was mostly a first baseman again. "I pitched a little," Lackey says.
"Maybe 14 more innings."</TE>
<TE>   The summer after his freshman year, Lackey played in the Jayhawk
League, a wood-bat league in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas for college
kids. He started pitching. He had also decided to transfer to Grayson
Junior College in Denison because he wanted to end up at Texas Tech.</TE>
<TE>   At Grayson, finally, Lackey became mostly a pitcher. Not always,
but mostly. And he never made it to Texas Tech, despite getting a
scholarship offer, because the Angels drafted him in the second
round.</TE>
<TE>   After 3 1/2 seasons in the minors, where he learned to control his
emotions and his fastball, Lackey stands on the home grass on the day
before his first home start. He is the last Angel off the field after
batting practice.</TE>
<TE>   He had stayed a few extra moments on the outfield grass stretching
and looking around while his teammates jogged into the clubhouse. His
locker has no nameplate yet. You must look for his uniform, No. 41,
to find where the 6-foot-6, 210-pound rookie has dropped his bags.</TE>
<TE>   Lackey was the losing pitcher at Texas last week, but he pitched
well. He gave up two other runs after the A-Rod blast. He struck out
six and walked one while keeping the Angels in a game that they
eventually lost, 3-2.</TE>
<TE>   And then Lackey was sent back to triple-A Salt Lake City. The
Stingers were in Edmonton, where he threw on the side for two days.
Meanwhile, middle reliever Al Levine went on the disabled list and
Schoeneweis went to the bullpen. Lackey was summoned from Edmonton.</TE>
<TE>   Angel General Manager Bill Stoneman called Lackey's Salt Lake
season "fabulous." Scioscia says Lackey has "a great presence on the
mound. He might not be executing his pitches perfectly but he stays
right in focus." It was as if Scioscia was speaking directly to his
staff.</TE>
<TE>   Black says Lackey has a fastball that can rise in the strike zone
and reach 95 mph. He has a curve, a slider and a changeup. He has,
says Black, "a real belief in himself. He is not cocky, but he is
confident."</TE>
<TE>   About 200 friends and family, including his father, Derran,
watched John pitch at Texas. Derran will be on the Internet tonight,
because the Abilene Lackeys have no satellite dish. "You don't just
go out and buy those things on a whim," Derran said from home
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe if John gets a locker nameplate, Derran can get that dish.
And the Angel fans can maybe dream that Lackey might turn out even a
little like another tall Texan who played in Anaheim. John Lackey's
hero, Nolan Ryan.</TE>

<HD>D.C. United, Convey, Work Overtime to Beat Galaxy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bobby Convey scored his first goal of the season in the eighth minute
of sudden-death overtime to give D.C. United a 1-0 victory over the
Galaxy on Saturday in front of 18,854 at Washington.</LD>
<LD>   It was the fifth loss in the last seven games for the Galaxy
(6-6-2).</LD>
<LD>   At the top of the six-yard box, Convey outleaped defender Adam
Frye to head in Ivan McKinley's cross from the left wing as United
(6-6-1) got back to .500 and improved to 6-1-1 at home.</LD>
<TE>   It was only the second goal in three seasons for the 19-year-old
midfielder, who entered the league with much hype in 2000 at age
16--at the time the youngest player in MLS history. Convey had muffed
a clear scoring chance in the 22nd minute when he lost control of the
ball on a give-and-go with 17-year-old Santino Quaranta.</TE>
<TE>   Goalkeeper Nick Rimando made five saves for his second consecutive
shutout. His sliding two-handed save on Carlos Ruiz's breakaway at
the end of the regulation sent the game to overtime.</TE>
<TE>   "We were this close to losing this game," United Coach Ray Hudson
said. "Nicky Rimando defied and denied them all night long."</TE>
<TE>   Simon Elliot hit the crossbar in the third minute of the extra
period for the Galaxy, which had a 6-3 advantage in shots on goal.</TE>
<TE>   Said Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid: "Overall, I thought it was a great
game and anyone who says that 0-0 games are boring needs to see a
game like tonight because there was action and opportunities on both
ends of the field. However, we are disappointed because we felt that
we had a couple of chances at the end."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other MLS games:</TE>
<TE>   New York-New Jersey 2, New England 0--Mamadou Diallo scored his
sixth goal in five games but was also sent off with a red card in the
32nd minute during the MetroStars' win in front of 16,958 at Foxboro,
Mass. Diallo was carded for kicking Revolution goalkeeper Adin Brown,
after he chased down a pass at the top of the Revolution box.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 2, Kansas City 1--Ramiro Corrales and Ariel Graziani
scored in the final five minutes to help the Earthquakes (9-4-2)
erase a 1-0 deficit before 9,008 at San Jose. Dario Fabbro scored in
the 16th minute for Kansas City (4-5-5)</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 1, Columbus 0--Jason Kreis, who missed on three scoring
chances in regulation, scored in the 98th minute to give the Burn the
victory at Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   In the WUSA:</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 3, San Diego 0--Birgit Prinz scored her sixth goal in
seven games and had an assist as the Courage won before 5,340 at
Cary, N.C. Goals from defender Danielle Slaton, who scored off Hege
Riise's 10th assist--a WUSA single-season record--and Prinz gave
Carolina (8-2-3) a 2-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 4, New York 1--Mia Hamm scored twice as the Freedom
(5-5-3) won before 8,052 at Uniondale, N.Y. Skylar Little and Anne
Makinen also scored as Washington sent the Power (2-10-1) to its
sixth straight loss.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 3, Atlanta 1--Marinette Pichon scored two goals as
the Charge (8-1-3) stretched its unbeaten streak to seven games
before 6,844 at Villanova, Pa. Sun Wen scored for Atlanta (6-5-1).</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 1, Boston 1--Katia scored for San Jose (5-4-3) and
Kristine Lilly scored for host Boston (3-5-5) three minutes apart in
the first half before 7,014.</TE>

<TE>   Update--This game has more subplots than the Soap Opera Channel.
The Comets want to end the Sparks' 28-game home winning streak,
because Los Angeles is the only team to beat Houston on its home
court this season. Sheryl Swoopes, who has received the most All-Star
fan votes, knows a big game against the Sparks validates her MVP
campaign before a national television audience now that Chamique
Holdsclaw has an ankle injury. And Swoopes is the player who most
concerns the Sparks. Need more? Houston trails Los Angeles by 1 1/2

<HD>Turkey Wastes Little Time</HD>
<DH>Third place: Sukur's goal 11 seconds into game is fastest
in Cup history and sparks 3-2 win over South Korea.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YOKOHAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>Even in its penultimate game, even when the 2002 World Cup had little
more than 24 hours of life left in it, still the surprises kept
coming.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday night, in the South Korean city of Daegu, a 40-year
record was broken when Turkey's Hakan Sukur scored the fastest goal
in the 72-year history of the tournament.</LD>
<LD>   Sukur's goal, a mere 11 seconds into the third-place game, sent
the Turks on their way to a 3-2 victory over co-host South Korea and
earned them their best-ever finish in the World Cup.</LD>
<TE>   The crowd of 63,483 was treated to one of the most entertaining
matches of the tournament, an end-to-end affair that featured five
goals and twice as many chances. The Turks won, but the Koreans
walked off the field as winners too.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth place was better than any of them had dared hope they would
achieve. It was the best finish ever by an Asian team.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the fans were reluctant to see the party end.</TE>
<TE>   Long after referee Saad Mane of Kuwait had sounded the final
whistle, tens of thousands of "Red Devils" still were cheering goal
scorers Lee Eul-Yong and Song Chong-Gug and the rest of their heroes
and showing no sign of wanting to go home.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea's players responded with a celebration of their own.</TE>
<TE>   They formed a circle at midfield, got down on their knees and
bowed their thanks to the throng of red-clad fans. Then they found
Chung Mong-Joon, president of South Korea's soccer federation, a FIFA
vice president and a man who, it is widely believed, soon will make a
bid for the country's presidency.</TE>
<TE>   No matter his status, they tossed him in the air three times.</TE>
<TE>   Guus Hiddink, the Dutch coach who has been the inspiration for the
team's success and soccer's remarkable rise in popularity in South
Korea, was next. He also was hoisted into the night sky, pumping his
fist in an emphatic gesture at the apex of one toss, and later
blowing kisses to all and sundry.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they have shown the world what they can do," he said of
his players. "Not only in team spirit but in the way they play."</TE>
<TE>   The way they played Saturday was the same way they have played
throughout the tournament, in a fast-paced, attacking style that kept
the pressure on the Turks even while they were conceding goals at the
other end.</TE>
<TE>   The game began with a moment of silence in honor of the four South
Korean sailors killed earlier in the day in a sea battle with North
Korean forces.</TE>
<TE>   Chung said he hoped the North Koreans' attack had not been tied to
South Korea's success in the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope their actions were not motivated by the World Cup in any
way," he said. "It is a very unfortunate incident. I hope that it
does not lead to greater conflicts."</TE>
<TE>   The match started out in dramatic fashion, with the ball finding
its way into the back of the net three times in the first dozen
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Sukur got things rolling with the fastest goal in World Cup
history, a strike that erased the 15-second goal Czechoslovakia's
Vaklav Masek scored against Mexico in the 1962 World Cup in Chile.</TE>
<TE>   It was a gift from the South Korean defense.</TE>
<TE>   The Koreans kicked off, passing the ball back into their own
defense but Turkey's Ilhan Mansiz stole it from veteran defender Hong
Myung-Bo, playing in his 132nd and final match for the national team,
and passed to Sukur for the striker to steer a shot past goalkeeper
Lee Woon-Jae.</TE>
<TE>   It was Sukur's record 30th goal in 80 games for Turkey, but his
first in what had been a disappointing tournament for him.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal was late in coming, I had to wait until today," he said.
"We got a good win and showed that if we had been in the final
[instead of Brazil and Germany] we would have won."</TE>
<TE>   South Korea tied the score in the ninth minute on a superb free
kick by Lee Eul-Yong, who curled the ball over the Turks' defensive
wall and into the upper right corner of the net, kissing the post on
the way.</TE>
<TE>   But Mansiz, Sukur's heir apparent as Turkey's top forward, scored
his third and fourth goals of the World Cup in the 13th and 32nd
minutes as the Turks controlled the first half.</TE>
<TE>   The South Koreans fought back in the second 45 minutes, but
goalkeeper Rustu Recber was again in top form and denied them time
and again.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in injury time, Song scored to make the final margin of
difference only a single goal and allow the fans to celebrate as if
they had won.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, they had.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WIMBLEDON, England</DL>
<LD>Maureen Drake made a series of volleys, putting away the final one to
take the first set against the No. 1 player in the world.</LD>
<LD>   The mother of the No. 1 player applauded Drake's shot-making.
Oracene Williams, Venus' mother, often does this after an excellent
rally, appreciating a fine shot. So often she looks bored in the
stands, and why not? Her daughters usually don't face more than token
opposition in the early rounds of Grand Slam tournaments.</LD>
<LD>   Wimbledon has been different. Serena Williams needed two
tiebreakers to get past qualifier Els Callens of Belgium in the third
round Friday. Venus, the two-time defending champion, dropped her
first set of the tournament Saturday but impressively raised her
level of play, beating 110th-ranked Drake of Canada, 5-7, 6-2, 6-1.</LD>
<TE>   Venus had tape on her left knee and her mobility seemed suspect in
the first set, as she went down, 0-3.</TE>
<TE>   "I just felt I was playing too passive, a little too tentative,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Drake, 31, has been one of the more interesting individuals on the
tour, wearing dark sunglasses against Williams. She once spent time
with a Caribbean support group and had a spiritual advisor, changed
her name to Mo Majick and designed her own tennis clothes. This was
her third main draw event on the tour, failing to get out of

<TE>   Boris Becker watched the way Pete Sampras sat and stared at his
racket strings after Wednesday's shocking second-round loss to George
Bastl. Becker, writing in a column in Saturday's Times here, said
that he was so unnerved he had to stop in the middle of an interview.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, his Wimbledon life stopped at that moment," Becker wrote.
" 'That's it,' I said, 'He will not come back. That is the end of
Pete.'</TE>
<TE>   "We had a seven-time champion who had spent much of a second-round
match reading a letter of inspiration from his wife--out in the open,
on a show court at Wimbledon, not at the dinner table in the
candlelight. I could not believe the whole thing. He had sunk into
himself at the end of the match. Maybe he was shedding a tear, not in
public but inside."</TE>
<TE>   Sampras, who has not won a tournament since Wimbledon 2000, said
immediately after the match he would return to Wimbledon.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a natural reaction," Becker said. "He had not time to
consider all the consequences, it had been so unexpected."</TE>

<TE>   The WTA had been considering moving its headquarters from St.
Petersburg, Fla., to either Atlanta or Los Angeles. But its board of
directors, meeting here Saturday, opted to stay in Florida.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YOKOHAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>Paolo Maldini turned 34 on Wednesday, but whether he celebrated the
occasion is uncertain.</LD>
<LD>   These are difficult days for Maldini, just as they are for all the
leading players who during this World Cup have stepped off the
international stage for the last time. Saying goodbye is never easy,
in sport or in real life.</LD>
<LD>   Korea/Japan '02 marked the swan song for many players. Most never
rose above the crowd, but others, like Maldini, became household
names wherever the game is played.</LD>
<TE>   The blue-eyed, dark-haired defender had been an automatic
selection for Italy since 1988, when, as a 19-year-old, he made his
debut for the "Azzurri" against Yugoslavia in what is now the
Croatian port city of Split.</TE>
<TE>   He played a record 126 games for his country and appeared in four
World Cups. For more than a decade, he was recognized as one of the
finest at his profession, which he once called "the art of
defending."</TE>
<TE>   Note his choice of words: "art," not "job."</TE>
<TE>   Maldini made it look easy, playing with the grace that comes not
only from years of experience but from an almost intuitive
understanding of the game. On the club level, in the red and black
colors of AC Milan, he won the Italian championship six times, the
European Champions Cup three times and the Intercontinental Cup
twice, among other honors.</TE>
<TE>   But--surprisingly and sadly--he won nothing in the blue shirt of
Italy.</TE>
<TE>   He was on the Italian team that finished third in the 1990 World
Cup that Italy staged. He was on the Italian team that was beaten on
penalty kicks by Brazil at the Rose Bowl in the final of the 1994
World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   He was on the Italian team that made it to the quarterfinals of
the 1998 World Cup in France, and on the Italian team that lost to
France in the final of the 2000 European Championship.</TE>
<TE>   For Maldini, it was always a case of coming close but falling
short. Korea/Japan '02 was to be the tournament when he at last made
that final leap.</TE>
<TE>   But he again fell short.</TE>
<TE>   When South Korean forward Ahn Jung-Hwan outjumped Maldini to head
home the game-winning goal against Italy in overtime of a
second-round match in Daejon, South Korea, on June 18, Maldini's
final chance was gone.</TE>
<TE>   Italy was eliminated and Maldini's international career was over.
He had played in 23 World Cup games, only two shy of the record held
by Germany's Lothar Matthaeus. Had Italy reached the final, he would
have broken that record.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike his father, Cesare, who coached Italy and Paraguay at the
World Cup level and was an assistant on Italy's 1982 World
Cup-winning team, Maldini will not go into coaching. When he hung up
his boots, it was for good.</TE>
<TE>   Other stars of equal magnitude have joined him in international
retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Gabriel Batistuta, Argentina's all-time leading goal scorer, also
has called it quits after a glittering career in which he scored 56
goals in 78 games for his country. Ten of those goals came in the
World Cups of 1994, 1998 and 2002, leaving him only four shy of the
14-goal record held by Germany's Gerd Mueller.</TE>
<TE>   Like Maldini, "Batigol" also left on a sad note, in tears after
Argentina was eliminated in the first round when it failed to defeat
Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   Batistuta, 33, spent 11 years on the international stage, after
making his debut against Brazil in June 1991, and will be remembered
as one of the brightest of South America's many stars, a player far
more personable than Diego Maradona, whose goal-scoring records he
eclipsed.</TE>
<TE>   Another giant figure to step down at this World Cup was Fernando
Hierro of Spain. At 34, the Real Madrid defender was one of Spain's
all-time greats, but his third and final World Cup also ended on a
bleak note, a loss to co-host South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   That quarterfinal game was Hierro's 89th and last for Spain. He
leaves the stage with 29 goals, more than any other Spanish player.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm leaving with good feelings," Hierro said. "No one can take
away my pride at having worn the national team shirt."</TE>
<TE>   Ireland striker Niall Quinn, the player whose shirt was virtually
ripped off by Hierro in a second-round game, thus giving the Irish a
late penalty kick that tied the match and sent it to overtime, also
has hung up his boots.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn, 35, scored a record 21 goals in 91 games for his country.</TE>
<TE>   Teammate Steve Staunton, 33, made a little bit of history by
becoming the first Irish player to appear in three World Cup
tournaments, but called it a day after a 14-year career.</TE>
<TE>   The list of top players slipping into the wings also includes
Croatian striker Davor Suker, who was the leading scorer at the
France '98 World Cup with six goals as Croatia finished a deserving
third.</TE>
<TE>   Suker, 34, had said he would try to repeat the feat at Korea/Japan
'02, but appeared in only one match and ended his international
career with a Croatian-record 45 goals in 68 games.</TE>
<TE>   The world's most-capped goalkeeper also called it a day. Saudi
Arabia's Mohammed Al-Deayea finished with 165 games to his credit and
played in three World Cups.</TE>
<TE>   Belgium's Marc Wilmots, Nigeria's Jay Jay Okocha, France's Frank
Leboeuf and Denmark's Jan Heintze are among the dozens of players who
will no longer be wearing their country's colors.</TE>
<TE>   Count among them South Korean defender Hong Myung-Bo, who played
in his 132nd and final game Saturday when South Korea was beaten by
Turkey in the third-place match in Daegu, South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   If Hong had mixed emotions, why not? Sadness tinged with relief
are only natural for players who have carried their country's flag
for so long.</TE>
<TE>   For fans, the emotions are similar. For them, Maldini, Batistuta,
Hierro and company move from the playing fields to the memory, and
that's always cause for reflection.</TE>

<TE>   Leaving the International Stage</TE>
<TE>   The disappointment surrounding the early departure of France from
the tournament is compounded by the likelihood that this was the last
opportunity for many members of the team. Ten of them, including six
starters, are 30 or older. Only the United States and Belgium, with
11 apiece, had more. Here are the oldest non-goalkeepers to have
played at least half of their team's minutes in this year's
tournament, with country, age, position and birth date:</TE>

<HD>Mets Take Chances, Flex Their Power</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Cedeno's steal of home and team's three home runs
highlight 11-2 victory over Yankees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Roger Cedeno couldn't believe what he heard as he stood on third
base. New York Met Manager Bobby Valentine was yelling at him to
steal home.</LD>
<LD>   Cedeno scored on a daring dash to the plate, and the rest of the
Mets spent most of the afternoon trotting around the bases in
Saturday's 11-2 victory over the New York Yankees.</LD>
<LD>   "Bobby yelled, 'Roger, go!' " Cedeno said. "One guy whose voice I
can recognize is Bobby's. I looked over at the dugout like, 'You
sure?' I just took a chance. I'm glad it worked. You've got to make
things happen."</LD>
<TE>   According to the Elias Sports Bureau, it was the first straight
steal of home by the Mets since Tommie Agee did it July 31, 1971,
against the Chicago Cubs.</TE>
<TE>   Mo Vaughn, Mike Piazza and backup catcher Vance Wilson all homered
as the Mets showed the Yankees they can play long ball too.</TE>
<TE>   Behind a strong pitching performance from Al Leiter, the Mets
evened this Subway Series at a game apiece and have won three of five
against their crosstown rivals this season.</TE>
<TE>   More important, the Mets avoided losing any more ground in the NL
East, staying 9 1/2 games behind first-place Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, every win is big for us," said Jay Payton, who had
three hits. "We've got to start winning as many games as we can and
chip away at Atlanta."</TE>
<TE>   Leiter (8-6) shut down the powerful Yankees, who lead the majors
with 125 homers. He gave up a solo shot to Derek Jeter in the first
but scattered only five other hits over seven sharp innings to lower
his earned-run average to 2.95.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson drove in two runs for the Mets. John Valentin, starting at
second base to give Roberto Alomar a rest, had two runs batted in and
turned two key 5-4-3 double plays.</TE>

<DH>What's 'Mystery!'s' future now that PBS has stopped buying
episodes from England? The case comes to America.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The fate of PBS' long-running "Mystery!" series hangs in the balance.
After airing two decades of acclaimed mysteries imported from
England--among them "Inspector Morse," "Reilly, Ace of Spies,"
"Touching Evil" and "Prime Suspect"--"Mystery!"--has been pushed out
of its regular Thursday night time slot and turned into a limited
summer series.</LD>
<LD>   "We stopped buying and co-producing British mysteries about a year
ago," says Rebecca Eaton, executive producer of both "Mystery!" and
"Masterpiece Theatre" for WGBH in Boston. "We had some that we bought
but had not aired, and PBS is redeploying 'Mystery!' as a limited
series this summer and next summer."</LD>
<LD>   Nothing is certain after that.</LD>
<TE>   "Mystery!" is losing its British accent because PBS chief Pat
Mitchell revamped the prime-time schedule--including moving
"Masterpiece Theatre" from its traditional Sunday night time slot to
Monday evenings--and issued an edict for more American programming.
"So they made the decision to stop doing British mysteries and to
produce American mysteries with WGBH," says Eaton.</TE>
<TE>   A two-hour pilot for an American "Mystery!" series is set to air
Nov. 24, based on Tony Hillerman's "Skinwalkers." "The rights were
held by Robert Redford's company, so we did it with his company and
we are developing more," Eaton says.</TE>
<TE>   She would like "Mystery!" to feature a combination of British and
American programming, which, among other things, would make the
series more economically feasible. "American mysteries are more
expensive because we are creating them from scratch rather than being
an investor in British mysteries," she explains.</TE>
<TE>   "Mystery!" kicks off its summer season Monday with the three-part
psychological thriller "Forgotten," starring Amanda Burton ("Silent
Witness") as a grieving woman whose young daughter was murdered 20
years earlier. Paul McGann ("Our Mutual Friend") plays the man
convicted of the crime, now living happily with a wife and a daughter
under an assumed name. She manages to find him and demands to know
where he buried her daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning July 22 is a new four-part installment of "Murder Rooms:
The Dark Beginnings of Sherlock Holmes," starring Ian Richardson as
Dr. Joseph Bell, the real-life model for Sherlock Holmes.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the summer is the premiere of "The Inspector Lynley
Mysteries: A Great Deliverance," airing Aug. 19 and 26. Based on the
novel by Elizabeth George, the contemporary thriller stars Nathaniel
Parker as the suave, wealthy and sophisticated Inspector Thomas
Lynley and Sharon Small as his partner, Sgt. Barbara Havers, a
rumpled, resentful, working-class detective.</TE>
<TE>   George, who is American and lives in Orange County, is thrilled
that "Inspector Lynley"--already a hit in England--is arriving
stateside on "Mystery!"</TE>
<TE>   "I am really looking forward to seeing them on American television
and seeing how people react to them," she says. So far, the BBC has
made five films based on her books and is about to make four more.
Next summer, "Mystery!" will air four additional "Inspector Lynley"
thrillers.</TE>
<TE>   George says that she did have film offers from Hollywood, but
"because these are British books I thought they would best be made in
the hands of a British film team. That kind of quashed Hollywood's
interest in it."</TE>
<TE>   The BBC, she says, has done a "particularly fine job with the two
main characters"--except that the actors don't resemble the
characters as she described them. "I think it is going to cause some
real concern on the part of hard-core readers," the author concedes,
"but their performances are really wonderful -- particularly Sharon
Small. She has brought a degree of vulnerability to the part, I
think, that is really sort of emotionally clarifying for the viewer."</TE>
<TE>   Eaton hopes these two summers and the November special won't be
the end of "Mystery!" "I think it's a big asset to PBS because it is
such a recognizable brand," she says. "British mysteries are always
in season and fashionable. Other broadcasters come and go and dally
with them, but for 20 years we have been in the forefront."</TE>
<TE>   "Mystery!" can be seen Mondays at 9 p.m. through Aug. 26 on KCET
and KVCR. The network has rated the first series, "Forgotten," TV-PG
(may be unsuitable for young children).</TE>
