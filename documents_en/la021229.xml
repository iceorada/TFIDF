<LD>President Harry Truman once remarked that he was looking for a
"one-armed economist" so that his advisors would stop saying "on the
one hand, this" and "on the other hand, that."</LD>
<LD>   As 2003 dawns, with the business outlook clouded by great
uncertainty, a one-armed economist would be a rare find, indeed.</LD>
<LD>   Every week, it seems, brings more confusion: One set of government
indicators suggests that the economy is poised to rebound, and then
the next set signals the opposite. Consumers are said to be the only
ones propping up the economy, and then the holiday shopping season
turns out to be the worst in 30 years. The stock market looks like
it's about to gain some real traction, only to shift back into
reverse.</LD>
<TE>   Yet if there's one thing that can be said with any confidence --
and without fear of contradiction -- it's that 2003 will be a year of
adaptation.</TE>
<TE>   Because that's what businesses do. Come good times, come bad, they
figure out how to adapt. And you don't have to search far or listen
to bloodless economic forecasts to find plenty of examples of that
happening.</TE>
<TE>   Take Waltco Engineering Co. of Gardena, a 62-year-old manufacturer
of precision parts for computers, telecommunications equipment,
aerospace and medical instrumentation.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Waltco made parts for IBM computers, Boeing airplanes
and other big customers, enjoying a long production run with every
order. But now, notes Deborah Nash, vice president and co-owner of
Waltco, "the long production run goes to Asian manufacturers" that
can offer lower costs.</TE>
<TE>   Such shifting production is a threat to manufacturing in this
region. But Waltco Engineering isn't stopping in its tracks to fret
about Asian competition. Instead, it has been moving to more
technically demanding tasks, such as design and development.</TE>
<TE>   "Customers," explains Nash, "want us to do more of the advanced
engineering work."</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, Waltco has required its 90 employees to take a
10-week course, for two hours a day, in advanced engineering
techniques in order to remain competitive. "We have a very highly
skilled workforce," Nash says. "And so we will become a one-stop shop
for technical development of highly engineered components."</TE>
<TE>   A lot is at stake. Waltco in the last year became an
employee-owned company as descendants of the founders sold out to
Stephen and Deborah Nash and their workers.</TE>
<TE>   At $16 million in sales this year, Waltco is operating at less
than 50% of its capacity and "not yet sustaining the growth we want,"
Nash says. But given the company's nimbleness, "we are cautiously
optimistic."</TE>
<TE>   Torrance-based manufacturer Ace Clearwater Enterprises  Inc. is
another good example of a business eager to adapt, learning and
changing over time.</TE>
<TE>   The firm was founded in 1949 as Ace Welding of El Segundo and grew
over the decades as a supplier to Garrett Aerospace (now part of
Honeywell Inc.), Lockheed Corp. and other aerospace giants.</TE>
<TE>   Two of its businesses -- making parts for power-generation plants
and the commercial aviation market -- have been in the doldrums this
year with no upturn in sight. Annual sales for Ace Clearwater, which
employs about 200 people, have fallen from $28 million in 1999 to
about $23 million in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   But rather than sit and stew, it has hustled for business,
capitalizing on its expertise in exotic metals -- a skill, says Vice
President Gary Johnson, that was "learned working on heat exchangers
for General Electric power plants."</TE>
<TE>   Now the company is getting orders for parts for small aircraft,
including Cessna planes made by Textron Inc. and Embraer aircraft
made by a leading company in Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   "Markets are doing well for those 80- to 110-passenger jets,"
Johnson points out, "and we get a lot of work from Brazil because we
can work with ... cobalt nickel alloys."</TE>
<TE>   Ace also has taken steps over the years to become a lean
operation, making it an attractive subcontractor for major Pentagon
suppliers. And with international tensions and U.S. defense budgets
now rising, orders are starting to run heavy for spare parts for the
Lockheed F-22, Boeing C-130 and other military aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   "Spare parts orders were postponed in defense budgets for years
and now there's a rush on," Johnson says.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Ace also has been landing parts orders from GE that the
electrical giant might in more peaceful times have given to its plant
in Hungary. "With the uncertainty about war," says Johnson, "GE is
supporting domestic plants as alternative suppliers."</TE>
<TE>   As Harry Truman's imaginary decisive economist would say,
successful businesses will be the ones that adapt in 2003. And
there's no "on the other hand" about that.</TE>

<LD>When a guy who once called himself "the master of the world" ends up
unemployed, you know it's an unusual year in the entertainment
business.</LD>
<LD>   But the fate of deposed Vivendi Universal Chairman Jean-Marie
Messier wasn't the only peculiar twist in the last 12 months. Some of
2002's lowlights:</LD>
<LD>   Start spreading 'les actualites' ...</LD>
<TE>   A TV movie about former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his
reaction to the Sept. 11 terrorist attack was shot in Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   As an agent, he wasn't known for calling off the dogs ...</TE>
<TE>   Former super-agent Michael Ovitz settled a lawsuit by a woman
claiming she was bitten by his dogs while walking down a Brentwood
street.</TE>
<TE>   Roses are red, violets are blue, the stock's in the tank, goodbye
to you ...</TE>
<TE>   Gerald Levin officially left as chief executive of AOL Time Warner
after declaring he wanted "to put the poetry back into his life."</TE>
<TE>   Also, any subject older than 500 years is off-limits ...</TE>
<TE>   The History Channel, in a memo outlining ways to attract a more
youthful audience, urged filmmakers to "give younger experts a chance
on camera. This country is filled with younger historians dying to
get a chance to strut their stuff. Don't rely on old faithfuls."</TE>
<TE>   You could argue that in this case it's actually a DVD bonus
feature ...</TE>
<TE>   A man filing a class-action lawsuit against Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
alleged that his copy of Rodney Dangerfield's 1986 movie "Back to
School" failed to include the wide-screen theatrical format.</TE>
<TE>   He already had a license plate ...</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Michael Eisner revealed that
former sports mogul and film producer Bruce McNall sent him a wallet
he made in prison while serving time for fraud.</TE>
<TE>   He shouldn't have listened to his dentist's lectures ...</TE>
<TE>   Producer Stephen Bing sued MGM owner Kirk Kerkorian after private
detectives collected dental floss from Bing's trash cans to try to
prove that he had fathered Kerkorian's daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Like the movie, it's a sticky subject ...</TE>
<TE>   Columbia Pictures' publicity materials for "Spider-Man" noted that
co-star Cliff Robertson was honored for "his brave stand against
corporate corruption in Hollywood" as the whistleblower in the 1978
David Begelman embezzlement scandal. Not mentioned was the studio
scandalized: Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   Here's the pitch: Pikachu in a period costume drama ...</TE>
<TE>   Perennial Oscar-nomination factory Miramax Films acquired the
rights to two "Pokemon" sequels.</TE>
<TE>   Where there's smoke, there's ...</TE>
<TE>   City officials alleged that Los Angeles film czar Cody Cluff
expensed a $3,000 initiation fee to the Grand Havana cigar club in
Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The Pittsburgh stealers ...</TE>
<TE>   Cluff, whose job is to promote production in Los Angeles, also got
into hot water for funneling $47,000 of local funds to the Pittsburgh
Film Office, run by a close friend of his.</TE>
<TE>   He stopped short of dangling him over a hotel balcony ...</TE>
<TE>   In a dispute with Sony Music chief Thomas Mottola over the lagging
sales of his "Invincible" album, singer Michael Jackson enlisted
lawyer Johnnie Cochran and activist Al Sharpton to protest his cause
and called Mottola "devilish."</TE>
<TE>   Can you feel the heat tonight ...</TE>
<TE>   Comic Jimmy Kimmel told top ABC executives that giving him a talk
show to help revive the network meant "You'll be out scalping tickets
to 'The Lion King.' "</TE>
<TE>   Not to mention the Lake Como Board of Realtors is investigating
...</TE>
<TE>   An agent at Creative Artists Agency was forced to resign after it
was learned that he tried to grab a $250,000 finders fee from the
seller of a $10-million lakeside Italian villa to actor George
Clooney.</TE>
<TE>   You've got red ink ...</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner posted a $54.2-billion first-quarter loss, more
than the annual gross domestic product of Ecuador, Croatia, Uruguay,
Kenya or Bulgaria.</TE>
<TE>   That '70s show ...</TE>
<TE>   In a contentious Screen Actors Guild election, 1970s child TV star
Melissa Gilbert defeated 1970s sitcom star Valerie Harper for
president while 1970s movie star Elliott Gould called 1970s TV star
Mike Farrell "a slug."</TE>
<TE>   At least they value his work ...</TE>
<TE>   The Internal Revenue Service argued in a U.S. Tax Court case that
late singer John Denver's record label and production company are
worth $2.5 million more than his estate thinks they are.</TE>
<TE>   We'll even throw in 10 cases of Dom Perignon ...</TE>
<TE>   Drenched in champagne after the Anaheim Angels beat the New York
Yankees in the playoffs, Disney's Eisner acknowledged that he had yet
to find "the right buyer" for the team.</TE>
<TE>   More people saw him there than viewed "Battlefield Earth" and
"Lucky Numbers" combined ...</TE>
<TE>   During Game 7 of the World Series, TV cameras repeatedly showed
actor John Travolta sitting in Eisner's private box.</TE>
<TE>   As corporate abuses go, this was par for the course ...</TE>
<TE>   Allegations in an indictment of Adelphia Communications Corp.'s
Rigas family included using company funds to build their own designer
golf course.</TE>
<TE>   He also thought "Last Action Hero" would be a hit ...</TE>
<TE>   Producer and former Sony Pictures chief Peter Guber, the day
before he was assigned to the jury in actress Winona Ryder's
shoplifting trial, predicted: "I have about as much chance of getting
on this jury as the man in the moon. I only made three pictures with
the lady."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the G's will help him land on his feet ...</TE>
<TE>   Messier, having declared his move from Paris to a $17.5-million,
company-owned Park Avenue penthouse "a serious, positive attempt to
have gravity in New York," was evicted after being fired from Vivendi
Universal.</TE>

<HD>After a Rocky Year, Time to Face the Music</HD>
<DH>A look at the record firms, one by one, as the industry's
problems mount</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Leeds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Suddenly, the music industry is hardly worth a song.</LD>
<LD>   Wall Street is slashing record company valuations. Despite efforts
to thwart them, digital pirates are still taking songs for free. And
label executives, scrambling to lure fans to record stores, have
sparked a price war that is putting new albums on sale for less than
$7 in many cases.</LD>
<LD>   Overall, global music industry revenue dropped about 8% to roughly
$31 billion in 2002, according to analyst estimates, leaving media
giants that only recently saw music as the key to their corporate
strategies to question whether they belong in the record business at
all.</LD>
<TE>   Yet getting out is a problem, too. Any company that hits the
auction block now probably would bring only a fraction of its peak
price.</TE>
<TE>   The key question of the moment is how to reverse the year's 11%
slide in U.S. album sales -- the worst performance for the crucial
domestic in more than a decade. The latest results follow a 3%
decline last year.</TE>
<TE>   With profits plunging at the largest companies, some analysts
predict that a torrent of layoffs is more likely than an industry
revival in the months ahead.</TE>
<TE>   This company-by-company assessment of the year's performance is
based on regulatory filings, Nielsen SoundScan estimates of U.S.
market share through Dec. 22 and interviews with key industry
players.</TE>
<TE>   Profit figures are for the nine months ended Sept. 30 or the most
recent period for which data are available, measured against
year-earlier results. Because companies report in different
currencies and under varying methods, these comparisons reflect
estimates made in consultation with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. For
foreign-owned companies -- that is, all the major distributors except
Warner Music Group -- figures are based on average currency rates for
the period.</TE>
<TE>   Holiday sales, which typically account for more than one-third of
annual revenue, haven't been counted yet. To date, however, data
suggest that the record industry needs more than a good Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   It needs a miracle.</TE>
<TE>   Universal Music Group</TE>
<TE>   * U.S. market share: 28.9%</TE>
<TE>   * Worldwide sales through Sept. 30: $3.9 billion, down 5%</TE>
<TE>   * Operating profit through Sept. 30: $172 million, down 51%</TE>
<TE>   * Major labels: Interscope Geffen A&amp;M, Island Def Jam, Universal,
MCA</TE>
<TE>   How far has the value of music fallen?</TE>
<TE>   Look no further than the world's biggest record label, which was
assembled just four years ago in a deal then worth $10.4 billion.
This year, new accounting rules forced French parent Vivendi
Universal to take a charge of about $3 billion to reflect the decline
in the worth of its music company.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the hit to the bottom line, Chairman Doug Morris again
dominated the charts with blockbusters from every genre. Jimmy
Iovine's Interscope Geffen A&amp;M complex takes the crown as the
nation's top seller of new releases -- including the year's biggest,
Eminem's "The Eminem Show," which has sold 7.4 million copies. The
string of platinum-sellers also includes the rapper's "8 Mile"
soundtrack, plus offerings from Puddle of Mudd, No Doubt, Sheryl Crow
and DreamWorks' country phenom Toby Keith.</TE>
<TE>   The Lyor Cohen-led Island Def Jam machine, for its part, delivered
one of the year's biggest debuts with Ashanti. Meanwhile, it also
cranked out hits from Ludacris, Ja Rule (the "Pain is Love" album,
not the new, slower-selling "Last Temptation") Cam'ron and
Hoobastank. But onetime icons Bon Jovi and Mariah Carey got off to
slow starts.</TE>
<TE>   Universal Records' Mel Lewinter and Monte Lipman once again struck
platinum with hip-hop stars Nelly and Big Tymers.</TE>
<TE>   Things were far quieter over at Jay Boberg's MCA Records, though
R&amp;B diva Mary J. Blige kept on selling.</TE>
<TE>   Rivals say Universal's big labels continue to overspend on talent
and promotions. And there is speculation that pink slips, which
already have hit the Motown division, may spread throughout the
company as Vivendi Universal prepares its entertainment properties
for a likely spinoff or sale.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Warner Music Group</TE>
<TE>   * U.S. market share: 17%</TE>
<TE>   * Worldwide sales through Sept. 30: $2.9 billion, up 4%</TE>
<TE>   * Operating profit through Sept. 30: $76 million, up 15%</TE>
<TE>   * Major labels: Warner Bros., Elektra, Atlantic</TE>
<TE>   You've got belt-tightening!</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner's music division didn't land a single album in the
year's overall top 10. But it still managed to raise its profit level
heading into the holidays after Chairman Roger Ames clamped down on
promotional costs, including trade magazine advertising, and
overhauled back-office operations.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros. once again finished the year as the AOL empire's most
profitable label, but it still fell short of its glory days as a
haven for innovative newcomers such as Jimi Hendrix and Joni
Mitchell. In fact, the unit cut its release schedule about 20%.</TE>
<TE>   Still, its savvy marketing machine scored with acts inherited from
now-shuttered affiliates in last year's Warner Music Group
restructuring, including Josh Groban and Disturbed. The label's new
management team of Tom Whalley and Jeff Ayeroff also counted on the
Red Hot Chili Peppers, Linkin Park and Enya to keep the engine
humming, along with Michelle Branch from Madonna's affiliated
Maverick label.</TE>
<TE>   One Warner Bros. weakness is that it's barely in the lucrative
rap-music game, and insiders still are waiting for Whalley's fabled
ears -- which picked up on new acts such as Tupac Shakur and the
Wallflowers during his tenure at Interscope Records -- to find a
home-grown chart-burner. Sluggish domestic sales also stung
Maverick's Alanis Morissette and Warner stalwarts the Goo Goo Dolls.</TE>
<TE>   Over at Elektra Entertainment, it's been a difficult year, though
label chief Sylvia Rhone came through with a hit from Missy Elliott
and broke new artist Tweet. The label's weak streak could be reversed
if Rhone can extract new albums next year from rock bands Metallica
and Staind.</TE>
<TE>   Things were also tough at the Atlantic Group, where long-awaited
albums from Brandy and Uncle Kracker bombed. But the label's prayers
for continued sales from Christian rockers P.O.D. came through, and
there still may be a chance to salvage Kid Rock's most recent album.
Under Chairman Val Azzoli and new co-presidents Ron Shapiro and Craig
Kallman, the label also has built a potent black-music roster, with
the Nappy Roots and Fat Joe breaking through this year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sony Music Entertainment</TE>
<TE>   * U.S. market share: 16.5%</TE>
<TE>   * Worldwide sales through Sept. 30: $3.5 billion, down 1%</TE>
<TE>   * Operating loss through Sept. 30: $142 million, contrasted with a
$61-million profit a year earlier</TE>
<TE>   * Major labels: Columbia, Epic</TE>
<TE>   Sony Music Chairman Thomas D. Mottola weathered a year in which
his wife's sisters were kidnapped and one of his biggest acts,
Michael Jackson, depicted him as the devil.</TE>
<TE>   The sisters are free, and Jackson has quieted down. But Mottola
has to rescue the Sony Corp. music operation, whose bottom line was
hurt by charges from an international restructuring, even though a
number of albums scored on the charts.</TE>
<TE>   One effort: more advertising-based promotions, such as a
much-touted deal with PepsiCo Inc. Sony also hopes to woo
ex-Interscope marketing whiz Steve Stoute to its executive suite, if
talks pan out.</TE>
<TE>   On the label front, Sony settled the Dixie Chicks'
royalty-accounting dispute in time for Columbia to make the country
act a cross-over pop sensation and the company's biggest seller at
3.4 million copies. Other major successes: John Mayer, Bruce
Springsteen, System of a Down and Nas. Those, plus Columbia's storied
catalog, helped make Don Ienner's label the nation's overall
market-share champ for a fifth year in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Even in a down year for the industry, Epic Records, led by
executives Dave Glew and Polly Anthony, still is regarded as a hit
factory. This year, it delivered big sellers from stars Celine Dion,
Jennifer Lopez and Shakira, while breaking through with new acts B2K
and Good Charlotte. One soft spot: Korn's long-awaited album topped
out at 1.2 million copies, which was respectable but far below
projections.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bertelsmann Music Group</TE>
<TE>   * U.S. market share: 14.8%</TE>
<TE>   * Worldwide sales for the six months through June 30: $1.1 billion</TE>
<TE>   * Operating loss through June 30: $41 million</TE>
<TE>   (Closely held Bertelsmann doesn't publicly report results and
declined to provide data for yearly comparisons.)</TE>
<TE>   * Major labels: Arista, J, RCA</TE>
<TE>   BMG rediscovered its catalog, turning out an Elvis Presley
compilation that sold 2.3 million copies. But it's going to take more
than repackaging "Jailhouse Rock" to make up for the ill-advised
arrangement with Zomba Music's Clive Calder.</TE>
<TE>   Calder's deal of a lifetime -- he exercised an option that forced
BMG's parent company to buy his slipping label for $2.7 billion --
all but assures that the German firm will find music a red-ink zone
for years to come.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, BMG gave observers whiplash, bringing music icon
Clive Davis back as chief of a combined J Records-RCA operation, less
than three years after driving him from his seat of power at its
Arista label. Even Davis won't find it easy to revive RCA. He may
start by trying to keep the Dave Matthews Band from jumping ship. The
band is shopping a new deal, though sources say it owes the label two
more albums.</TE>
<TE>   As for Arista, the only real question may be: Does anyone still
think Antonio "L.A." Reid can't run a pop label?</TE>
<TE>   If so, they clearly weren't paying attention to Reid's results at
the unit, which he took over in 2000 amid doubts by some critics
about whether his R&amp;B roots would translate. Arista delivered two of
the six biggest albums of the year with Avril Lavigne and Pink, while
posting solid sales from Usher, new act Clipse, and a decent start
for the Carlos Santana album. Reid's decision to bid adieu to Sean
"P. Diddy" Combs and his expensive Bad Boy label probably will save
him a bundle, but rivals claim he continues to waste money on joint
ventures with producers Jimmy Jam &amp; Terry Lewis, She'kspere and
TrackMasters.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   EMI Group</TE>
<TE>   * U.S. market share: 9.3%</TE>
<TE>   * Worldwide sales for the six months ended Sept. 30: $1.5 billion,
down 10%</TE>
<TE>   * Operating profit for the six months ended Sept. 30: $86 million,
up 253% (EMI doesn't report quarterly results.)</TE>
<TE>   * Major labels: Capitol, Virgin</TE>
<TE>   With nowhere to go but up, EMI posted solid worldwide results
thanks in part to a cost-cutting drive that eliminated 1,900
employees and tightened the cap on executive salaries.</TE>
<TE>   Now, top executives Alain Levy and David Munns have vowed that by
spring EMI will break even in North America, where its record
division has long been a money-loser.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, EMI is hitting a crossroads, and it's at the intersection
of Hollywood and Vine: The verdict is still out as to whether new
label chief Andy Slater has the vision to revive Capitol, although he
eked out modest hits this year with such acts as Kylie Minogue,
Coldplay, the Vines and Dirty Vegas. Morale is rising at Capitol
headquarters -- known simply as the Tower -- and spirits may perk up
further if EMI can close a new record deal with Radiohead.</TE>
<TE>   At the relatively small Blue Note division, executive Bruce
Lundvall deserves a reward for signing singer Norah Jones, the
company's biggest seller with 2.4 million copies sold -- although
rivals joke that it shouldn't come in the form of stock. EMI shares,
like those of rivals, have plunged.</TE>
<TE>   Virgin Records continued to be a financial sinkhole, delivering
only a Rolling Stones compilation (while handling radio promotion for
Blue Note's Norah Jones). After the label's move from Beverly Hills
to New York and a reorganization in which about 80% of the staff quit
or were fired, industry watchers are waiting for new co-chiefs Matt
Serletic and Roy Lott to put their imprint on the company. Things
could turn up next year with new albums from Janet Jackson and buzz
bands the Exies and Black Rebel Motorcycle Club.</TE>

<LD>It is way past time for our various governments, legislatures,
attorneys general, and courts to admit that corporations cannot
commit misdeeds -- only persons can ("Brokerages Balk at Hefty
Settlements," Dec 11).</LD>
<LD>   The continuing actions of corporate executives, personally or
through underlings, purposely or by failure to supervise, causing
losses of millions to others while reaping millions themselves,
should be treated as felonies, resulting in prison and loss of their
misbegotten fortunes.</LD>

cost the executive wrongdoers nothing, but at great cost to innocent

<TE>   Punishment of guilty brokerages by fines of up to $75 million seem
like a slap on the wrist and does not appear to provide any
compensation to those who were misled by the brokerages.</TE>
<TE>   A more meaningful punishment would be equal to the total capital
losses incurred during a period (to be determined) by those
victimized by each brokerage. This sum, or a reasonable fraction of
it, would then be distributed to the victims in proportion to their
losses. Everyone would benefit from this approach.</TE>

<HD>For 2003, Media Sector Fomenting Rebellion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sallie Hofmeister</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many media pundits predict that next year will be a time for
rebuilding. But just as surely, it will be a time for rebelling.</LD>
<LD>   Granted, tremendous turmoil in the media sector this year is
likely to lead to a search for stability in 2003, as leading media
companies such as AOL Time Warner Inc., Vivendi Universal and Walt
Disney Co. focus intently on recovery rather than rapid expansion
through acquisitions.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, for most media executives, cost cutting will be the order
of the day as they hunker down amid a still-lethargic economy and
continued accounting probes in pockets of the industry.</LD>
<TE>   Yet that doesn't mean there won't be plenty of battling between
media giants, as well as within them. Among the expected
developments: Cable companies will revolt against their program
suppliers over pricing, and at least a couple of top executives will
face mutinies within their own ranks.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some predictions for 2003 -- some bolder than others --
based on interviews with analysts, investors and industry executives:</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner will bid farewell to its chairman, Steve Case.</TE>
<TE>   The architect behind the troubled merger of the world's largest
entertainment company and its leading Internet service provider will
resign under pressure in February, giving the board enough time to
print up proxy statements with a new slate of directors for a vote at
the company's annual meeting in May.</TE>
<TE>   The board will appoint a nonexecutive chairman from within its
ranks, leaving current management, under Chief Executive Richard
Parsons, in place.</TE>
<TE>   The ouster will be cheered within Time Warner, where Case is seen
as a symbol of an America Online culture that led to regulatory
scrutiny of the company's accounting practices and overzealous
promises that backfired on investors.</TE>
<TE>   On Wall Street, however, Case's departure will be greeted with a
big yawn. Many already viewed Case as little more than a figurehead
who lost power and credibility amid AOL Time Warner's stock plunge
and a housecleaning of top management that left Time Warner
executives in charge.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Viacom Inc. will see a shakeup at the top.</TE>
<TE>   Despite assurances by Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone that the
contract of his No. 2 would be renewed, President Mel Karmazin will
hit the road.</TE>
<TE>   The two strong-minded execs will not be able to set aside their
egos and personal agendas to come up with a new working arrangement.
The departure will set off a power struggle among division heads.</TE>
<TE>   Karmazin, for his part, will kick back and count his money as
feelers come in from Disney and AOL.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The balance of power will shift from program suppliers such as
Disney to distributors such as Comcast Corp.</TE>
<TE>   After completing its acquisition of AT&amp;T Broadband in late 2002,
Comcast will use its clout as the nation's leading cable operator to
extract better deals from all of its programming suppliers. In the
process, the company will save hundreds of millions of dollars in
programming costs, just as it promised Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   Comcast already has filed a lawsuit against Starz Encore Group,
challenging one of the most expensive programming deals in the cable
industry, after inheriting the movie channel's contract from AT&amp;T.</TE>
<TE>   Sources say the cable operator also could use the courts to fight
similar battles with other programmers -- or simply refuse to give
channels their customary rate increases when contracts expire. Other
television executives say the cable operator plans to launch new
channels, potentially undercutting the value of existing networks.</TE>
<TE>   They say Comcast is particularly keen on starting regional sports
networks in competition with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., which
charges some of the highest rates in the industry for its sports
channels.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, media giants that control families of channels --
including News Corp., Viacom, AOL Time Warner and Disney -- aren't
going to roll over. But Comcast is poised to play hardball.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, one cable executive suggests that ESPN will be Comcast's
biggest target. The Disney-owned sports channel has imposed
particularly steep annual rate increases on its cable customers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   News Corp. and Liberty Media Corp. will take control of DirecTV
after three years of trying, triggering a war between the satellite
concern and its cable industry rivals.</TE>
<TE>   Murdoch, partnering with John Malone's Liberty Media, will make a
deal to buy General Motors Corp.'s satellite service, DirecTV -- only
to face a torrent of opposition from the cable industry.</TE>
<TE>   In their lobbying campaign, the cable companies will argue that
DirecTV would give News Corp. too much power over both content and
distribution, allowing the company to favor its own programming for
satellite distribution and unfairly withhold it from cable operators.</TE>
<TE>   But the anti-News Corp. effort with Washington regulators will
only be pushed so far. The cable industry still must rely on
Murdoch's company to provide it with some of its most popular
programming, including Fox News and Fox's regional sports channels.</TE>
<TE>   And in the end, Murdoch will win the war.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Malone will make a successful play for control of Vivendi
Universal's entertainment properties, beating out billionaire Marvin
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Oil tycoon Davis will fail to raise enough money to buy the
Universal entertainment assets, as would-be investors remain queasy
over the piracy of music, Universal's biggest business.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Malone's Liberty Media will invest cash, plus its
100%-owned stake in the Starz Encore Group, in a new company made up
of Vivendi's U.S. entertainment assets.</TE>
<TE>   Liberty will wind up with more than 25% of the new Universal and
then take the company public.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Diller, the current co-chief of the Universal entertainment
group and a close ally of Malone's, will become chairman of the
public company. But he will hire a high-profile CEO who allows him to
concentrate on his Internet company, USA Interactive.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Michael Eisner will remain chairman and chief executive at Walt
Disney.</TE>
<TE>   Amid investor pressure on the Disney board to bring in a new CEO
such as Viacom's Mel Karmazin or News Corp.'s Peter Chernin, Eisner
will hang on to his post.</TE>
<TE>   But it's not because of any major improvement in the company's
financial performance. Disney's stock price will remain depressed as
every segment of the company, save for its cable networks, continues
to sag.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, stockholders will remain restive through 2003. By
year's end, speculation will again emerge about a corporate takeover
by Comcast, which will have paid down its debt and shaped up the AT&amp;T
properties, laying the groundwork for its next major conquest.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A fight will erupt in Washington over further loosening of media
ownership rules, delaying deregulation.</TE>
<TE>   Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael Powell will
move to relax decades-old rules that restrict who may own
broadcasters and how large they can grow. But opposition within the
agency will postpone any policy changes until at least late in the
year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A public offering by AOL Time Warner's cable division will pump
liquidity into the troubled industry.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner will spin off its cable arm, which in turn will
buy the systems owned by Cablevision Systems Corp. That will give
Time Warner Cable control over the largest coverage area in the
industry, spanning from Long Island to New York City.</TE>
<TE>   With Comcast and Time Warner calling the shots within the
industry, pressure will mount on third-ranked Cox Communications
Inc., troubled Adelphia Communications Corp. and Charter
Communications Inc. to sell or merge.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Allen, the billionaire who controls Charter, will refuse to
throw in the towel, even as his company slips closer to Bankruptcy
Court. Ultimately, he will refinance Charter's operations as a
federal investigation of how the company accounts for subscribers is
resolved.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The music industry will continue to implode, undermined by
Internet piracy.</TE>
<TE>   With pirates stealing the equivalent of 30% of the annual revenue
at some major record companies, EMI and Warner Music are trading at
nearly a third the value they were two years ago, when they last
attempted to merge.</TE>
<TE>   Cutting its losses before values decline any further, AOL Time
Warner will shed its music group, selling out to EMI.</TE>

<LD>Retailers Take Their Lumps for Holidays</LD>
<LD>   Retailers staggered to the finish line after a brutal holiday
selling race, with even Wal-Mart Stores Inc. conceding that improved
business in the days before Christmas was "too late and too little"
to allow it to make its sales target.</LD>
<LD>   By one estimate, U.S. retail sales between Thanksgiving and
Christmas fell 11% from year-earlier levels, though some experts
cautioned that comparisons were made difficult by this year's shorter
sales season.</LD>
<TE>   Retailers reporting disappointing sales included Target Corp.,
Federated Department Stores Inc. and FAO Inc., the parent of toy
retailers FAO Schwarz and Zany Brainy, which said it would close as
many as 70 stores, in part because of poor holiday sales.</TE>
<TE>   Sharper Image Corp., San Francisco-based purveyor of unusual gifts
and gadgets, managed to buck the trend, reporting that December
same-store sales were up 7% through Christmas Eve.</TE>
<TE>   The sluggish holiday shopping portends trouble for the broader
economy, which has been held up by hearty consumer spending even in
the face of a jobless recovery and declining growth in personal
incomes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Judge Orders Microsoft to Bundle Java, Windows</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge ruled that Microsoft Corp. must distribute Sun
Microsystems Inc.'s Java programming language with the Windows
computer operating system, giving Sun a big victory in its
long-running antitrust lawsuit against the world's largest software
maker.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge J. Frederick Motz in Baltimore said his
decision to grant a preliminary injunction was needed to roll back
"market conditions in which [Microsoft] is unfairly advantaged" over
Sun, a Palo Alto-based maker of computer servers and workstations.</TE>
<TE>   His ruling could cost Microsoft tens of millions of dollars in
repackaging and distribution costs. The decision means Motz believes
that Sun is likely to prevail in its $1-billion suit against
Microsoft, scheduled to go to trial late next year.</TE>

<TE>   State Egg Industry Faces Outbreak of Newcastle</TE>
<TE>   California's commercial egg industry worked to contain a
potentially ruinous outbreak of a deadly farm disease.</TE>
<TE>   State officials ordered the destruction of 100,000 infected hens
and quarantined poultry in three Southern California counties because
of exotic Newcastle disease, which is deadly to poultry but cannot be
contracted by humans.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said it had been discovered at a poultry farm near
Riverside, the first occurrence in a commercial flock since 1974.
They prohibited the movement of poultry, poultry products and nesting
materials from Los Angeles County and portions of Riverside and San
Bernardino counties.</TE>

<TE>   U.S. Declines to File Charges Against Global</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles decided against filing criminal
charges against Global Crossing Ltd., Chairman Gary Winnick or any of
its other executives over the company's aggressive accounting
practices or alleged document destruction.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. attorney's office lacked the evidence to show that
executives at the telecommunications company had misallocated costs
or had obstructed justice by shredding sensitive documents, a source
said.</TE>
<TE>   The decision closed the books on the U.S. attorney's investigation
of Global, which filed for bankruptcy protection in January under
$12.4 billion in debt and soft demand for its 100,000 miles of cable
worldwide.</TE>

<TE>   Enron Says It Underpaid State Power Grid Agency</TE>
<TE>   Enron Corp. disclosed that it underpaid the operator of
California's electricity grid by as much as $50 million because of
errors by Computer Sciences Corp., which Enron had hired to read its
customers' meters.</TE>
<TE>   Houston-based Enron said it could take weeks to determine how the
errors occurred. A Computer Sciences spokeswoman confirmed the errors
but said the underpayment probably was closer to $9 million.</TE>
<TE>   Under the state's energy deregulation law, Enron began selling
power to major companies and institutions in 1998. Company
representatives said last week that they could not say whether its
customers, which for the period in question included the University
of California and the California State University, would be liable
for the underpayments.</TE>

<TE>   Charter Replaces Two of Its Top Executives</TE>
<TE>   Cable television operator Charter Communications Inc. fired two
top executives in a bid to regain investor confidence amid a federal
investigation of its accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   Charter, which serves about 500,000 customers in Southern
California, announced that Chief Operating Officer David Barford and
Chief Financial Officer Kent Kalkwarf would be replaced immediately.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis-based Charter, the No. 3 U.S. cable operator, would not
specify why the executives were fired but acknowledged that the
action followed its review of matters "including those relating to
the previously disclosed grand jury investigation."</TE>

<TE>   Amgen Factory Means New Hope for Patients</TE>
<TE>   With tens of thousands of patients on the waiting list for its
rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel, Amgen Inc. had to find a way to get
more of it to market.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the company declared its mission accomplished when the
Food and Drug Administration approved a refurbished Rhode Island
factory that would enable Amgen to double shipments.</TE>
<TE>   The Thousand Oaks company acquired a potential blockbuster in
Enbrel when it bought Immunex Corp. for $9.6 billion in July. But the
underperforming factory proved to be an obstacle.</TE>

<TE>   Irvine Firm Wins OK for Dry-Eye Medication</TE>
<TE>   Allergan Inc. received long-awaited regulatory approval to market
the first prescription treatment for dry-eye disease, a condition
that affects an estimated 1 million Americans.</TE>
<TE>   The eyedrops, known as Restasis, are not viewed as a blockbuster
drug for the Irvine-based pharmaceutical company, best known for
selling the wrinkle-banishing agent Botox.</TE>
<TE>   But Restasis eventually could generate $500 million in sales
annually, the company said in announcing its intent to put the drops

<TE>   Piggy Spurns Mickey for Media Entrepreneur</TE>
<TE>   The parent of Jim Henson  Co. agreed to sell a 49.9% stake to a
group headed by media entrepreneur Dean Valentine, thus ending Walt
Disney Co.'s flirtation with the struggling creator of the Muppets.</TE>
<TE>   EM.TV of Germany, Henson's owner since March 2000, would retain
controlling interest in the creator of Miss Piggy, Kermit and other
popular characters. Terms were not disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Valentine is a former chief executive of United Paramount Network.
He and partners hope to revive a franchise that was hugely popular in
the late 1970s and early '80s but has seen recent movies flop at the
box office.</TE>

<TE>   Now Playing and Playing and Playing...</TE>
<TE>   And for those who found the news of the week, and the year,
something to forget, the movies proved to be a popular escape.</TE>
<TE>   Industry sources estimate that Americans will have flocked to
theaters 1.5 billion times by year's end, the most since 1959. That
helped generate $9 billion in studio revenues and renewed hope for
struggling exhibitors.</TE>
<TE>   One psychologist credited the news as much as Hollywood marketing
muscle, noting that after 9/11, "the real world is probably more
terrifying than Americans have ever known."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Does The Times have an agenda regarding its coverage of Gary Winnick?</LD>
<LD>   While reading "Winnick Puts Cash in Fund for Workers" (Dec. 20.),
about Mr. Winnick's $25-million deposit of his own money into an
escrow account for the losses sustained by employees in the company's
stock, that's the impression a reader would get.</LD>
<LD>   I think it is important to note that he originally made this offer
while testifying voluntarily before a congressional committee. He
could have given nothing and remained silent, as was his
constitutional right.</LD>
<TE>   Certainly, it was in the interests of all employees, including Mr.
Winnick, that Global Crossing succeed.</TE>
<TE>   Stating that he "oversaw Global's crash" implies that he could
have reversed the market forces that led to the bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, it was his entrepreneurial foresight and drive that built
an infrastructure of technological complexity and enormous cost.</TE>
<TE>   Using the pejorative term "handlers" to describe the public
relations people used by most high-profile businessmen and publishing
an unflattering photograph only reinforce the bias obvious in the
tone of the article.</TE>
<TE>   George Choderker</TE>
<TE>   Westwood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So Gary Winnick can testify in front of a Senate committee and
promise to pay back $25 million, and now suddenly federal prosecutors
drop their investigation of him?</TE>
<TE>   Winnick destroyed lives of stockholders and employees with his hot
air and scummy accounting schemes.</TE>

<HD>Lowering DVD Prices May Curb Piracy</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the motion picture industry wants to really combat illegal DVD
copying, I'd suggest that they take a cue from what happened to the
music industry ("Sellers of Pirated DVDs Targeted," Dec. 11): If you
charge too much for a legally made product, it only creates demand
for an illegal product.</LD>
<LD>   The music industry will go to its grave believing it can charge
$18.99 for a disc that any kid on a computer can make for 20 cents.
And now look where they are.</LD>
<LD>   DVDs should have a suggested retail price of $10, not $29.99 or
even $19.99. They can be made for around a dollar apiece by the
industry. Want to see piracy stop? Reduce the demand by reducing the
prices.</LD>

<HD>Cross-Check Could Prevent Identity Theft</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Protecting Your Good Name From Thieves" (Nov. 30) proposes a "fraud
alert" on credit reports, requiring creditors to call for credit
approval after signs of identity theft appear.</LD>
<LD>   But identity theft can be prevented altogether by requiring
verification upfront -- instead of after the debt has been incurred,
the creditor has lost the funds and the consumer faces the
humiliation of credit reconstruction.</LD>
<LD>   Focus on prevention, not repair.</LD>
<TE>   Why couldn't a simple cross-check be mandatory before any
applicant is granted credit or required to repay?</TE>

<HD>Cyclical System Puts Costs on Employers Now</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re: "Jobless Benefit Costs to Increase" (Dec. 17):</LD>
<LD>   As chairman of the state Senate Committee on Labor and Industrial
Relations, I too am concerned about keeping our economy healthy and I
understand the importance of keeping small business strong.</LD>
<LD>   The story noted that "with most employers paying an additional $21
per worker next year, the increase comes at a time when companies
already are struggling" with other costs.</LD>
<TE>   It fails to include the fact that when these unemployment laws
were created, California businesses didn't complain about the
cyclical system of payment that creates this situation.</TE>
<TE>   Under the cyclical system, employers pay the lowest rates in boom
years when unemployment is low. But in order for the system to stay
financially afloat, employers have to pay the highest rates in
recession years when there is higher unemployment.</TE>
<TE>   The system was very popular during the last six years while
employers saved more than $4 billion due to lower employer
contribution rates.</TE>
<TE>   Complaining now is like refusing to pay the credit card bill in
January after a flurry of holiday overspending.</TE>
<TE>   And let's keep this in perspective. The increase amounts to less
than one penny per worker hour.</TE>

<HD>Medicare Reimbursement for Home Care Is Limited to Pros</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Liz Pulliam Weston</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I'm living with my mother, who has the beginnings of
Alzheimer's. She is unable to function on her own because of her
dementia. Physically, she is in good shape. Mentally, she gets quite
confused and doesn't even remember sometimes that I'm living with
her. Can I get any reimbursement from Medicare for being a live-in
caregiver? I am not getting paid anything. We live off her trusts and
the estate of her late husband. I am 58 and gave up my job, my life
in another state and my friends to take care of her. At this point I
don't feel comfortable leaving her alone for too long during the day
and have decided it wouldn't be wise for me to get a part-time job.
Are there any financial programs I can investigate?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Ed Long, an attorney who specializes in elder law, says
it's extremely unlikely that Medicare would pay you for your work.</LD>
<LD>   First of all, Medicare doesn't pay for most home-provided care --
particularly the kinds of custodial care needed by people with
dementia. What meager pay is provided goes for professionals. So
Medicare would pay your salary only if you were a licensed nurse,
Long said, and willing to work for a home-care agency that served
clients other than your mother.</LD>
<TE>   Some states, such as California, have programs linked to Medicaid
that provide some support services for in-home caregivers.</TE>
<TE>   Medicaid is a separate government program that does pay for
custodial care -- but usually only for the indigent. Given your
mother's resources, your family probably doesn't qualify.</TE>
<TE>   Long suggests that you contact your local Area Agency on Aging,
listed in the government section of the phone book, for more details
and for other resources that might provide some help. Alternatively,
you could talk to a geriatric care manager or an elder law attorney
in your area.</TE>
<TE>   If your mother is well off, by the way, you could arrange to be
paid a reasonable salary from her assets. You'll want to talk to the
elder law attorney about the best way to do this. There's nothing
wrong with such arrangements, as long as the salary you take isn't
exorbitant.</TE>

<TE>   Closing Card Accounts Won't Help Credit Score</TE>
<TE>   Q: In your response regarding the effect on a FICO credit score
when an account is closed, you gave some misinformation. As a
well-informed mortgage broker whose entire business is built upon
repeat clients and referrals, I have had the opportunity to view and
track a consumer's credit history and score fluctuations over an
extended period. I have witnessed scores improving after accounts
were closed. The scoring model perceives that a consumer with
numerous credit cards is at a higher risk of credit problems than a
consumer with only a few credit cards. The only way to eliminate this
problem is to close accounts, or not open them in the first place. My
purpose in sending you this letter is that I see consumers every day
who are not able to obtain the loan they want for the home they want
due in part to erroneous advice.</TE>
<TE>   A: If you're telling clients to close accounts in order to improve
their FICO credit scores, then you're the one handing out erroneous
advice.</TE>
<TE>   The company that creates the FICO credit score, Fair, Isaac &amp; Co.,
says it unequivocally: Closing credit accounts can never help a
credit score, and may hurt it.</TE>
<TE>   That's because the score measures the difference between available
credit and how much is being used. The more available credit is being
used, the worse the potential effect on the score. Reducing the total
available credit by shutting down an account makes any remaining
balances look bigger, proportionately.</TE>
<TE>   You're right in saying that too many accounts also can hurt a
score. But once the account has been opened, Fair Isaac says, the
effect on the credit score can't be reversed by shutting down the
line of credit.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the number of open accounts is just one of the numerous
factors that help shape a score. Another is the passage of time. That
may be why you've seen some scores rise after an account was closed.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than making assumptions about how credit scoring works, you
might want to contact the National Assn. of Mortgage Brokers, which
has information and seminars for lending professionals on this topic.
Your clients deserve a broker who truly is well informed -- not just
one who thinks she is.</TE>

<LD>When duty calls, Navy SEAL David H. hangs his life insurance policy
on the refrigerator before heading out to deploy with his unit.</LD>
<LD>   Going to war forces you to face the prospect of not coming back,
said David, who asked that his full name not be used for security
reasons. Though HE'S trained to handle fear of his own death, he
doesn't want to worry about whether his wife and three children will
face an economic crisis if he's killed in action.</LD>
<LD>   "My mother-in-law thinks it's morbid, but it's something you have
to think about," he said. "God forbid that you would leave your wife
hanging."</LD>
<TE>   Thousands of military families in California and around the
country are "buttoning down" their finances as the nation braces for
a possible war in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the preparations fall under the category of basic training
in terms of financial planning. But they take on added significance
for military families, whose primary breadwinner can be called away
on short notice for weeks or months at a time. In addition, military
personnel, depending on the job they perform, can face greater risk
of injury or death than civilian workers.</TE>
<TE>   There are two federal laws specifically designed to help military
personnel when they are deployed away from home, said Christopher
Michel, chief executive of Military.com, a Web site that caters to
members of the armed forces.</TE>
<TE>   The Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act requires lenders to cut
interest rates on existing loans to active duty military members to
6% or less from the date that they deploy to when they are discharged
from active duty. It also protects the service member from
foreclosure or some other legal proceeding while he or she is away.
To receive these benefits, military personnel must notify their
lenders, Michel noted.</TE>
<TE>   The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act
ensures that reservists and National Guardsmen will have jobs to
return to when they've completed their military service.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, military personnel must consider the same issues as
anyone else who wants to make sure that their spouse and children
would not be left in the lurch if something unexpected were to happen
to them.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to review their finances with their family, identify
the potential risks and put in place solutions," said Susan
Pamerleau, vice president of member services with USAA, a San
Antonio-based financial services company that specializes in serving
the military.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some issues for military families to keep in mind:</TE>
<TE>   * Budget, balance sheet and bills: It's not necessary to have a
detailed budget showing where every dollar is spent. But it's
important to have a broad-brush budget that indicates how much money
is coming in -- and from what sources -- and how much is going out.</TE>
<TE>   A budget provides a basis for other pivotal calculations, such as
a family's life and disability insurance needs. A balance sheet
spells out what assets a family has and where they are -- especially
cash -- in case one partner needs to tap assets in the absence of the
other.</TE>
<TE>   For service members who are about to be deployed overseas, the
most immediate concern is making sure the bills get paid. Navy SEAL
David addresses this by charging all of his family's bills to one
credit card, which he has arranged to pay electronically. Automatic
bill payment services also are available. Another option: Going over
the process with your spouse, a friend or another relative who is
able to pay the bills on your behalf.</TE>
<TE>   * Power of attorney: This legal document gives a trusted friend or
family member the ability to act as your proxy -- paying bills and
handling financial transactions, such as the sale of a house or a
car, in your absence.</TE>
<TE>   A power of attorney may not be necessary if you have carefully
structured ownership of assets and payment of bills in advance. But
it provides security in case some detail was overlooked.</TE>
<TE>   Executing this document is simple -- the forms are readily
available in many office supply stores, as well as from lawyers and
sellers of legal documents. USAA offers a printable version on its
Web site, Pamerleau noted. A big caveat: Make sure you choose someone
trustworthy to serve as your proxy. That person will hold the legal
right to take control of your finances. If he or she isn't
trustworthy, it could be a disaster.</TE>
<TE>   * Life insurance: Anyone with dependents should have life
insurance, but determining the right amount of insurance is tricky.
It hinges on how much the family spends, their other resources and a
variety of other variables, including the ages of children, the
amount of debt and the family's contingency plans. Questionnaires are
available on the Internet, including one at www.aafmaa.com, which can
help determine a reasonable amount.</TE>
<TE>   * Will: Legal experts estimate that 70% of the population doesn't
have a will. People who die without a will leave their survivors to
rely on state laws to distribute their assets and assign guardians
for minor children.</TE>
<TE>   Those with close-knit nuclear families may find that those laws
suit their wishes. But experts caution that those with complicated
family situations or unusual desires must at least ensure that they
have named guardians for their children, even if they haven't
specified how they'd like to distribute their assets.</TE>

<LD>Re "Priests Begin Public Penance in O.C.," Dec. 19:</LD>
<LD>   To show "penance" and "contrition" for the action of their peer
priests, 16 clerics gathered in front of a crowd of reporters and in
the glare of TV lights to perform such acts as:</LD>
<LD>   Reading to children.</LD>
<TE>   Giving up the use of a car for a day.</TE>
<TE>   Working as a janitor's assistant at a school.</TE>
<TE>   There were other suggested acts, such as wearing clerical attire
to a shopping mall where the so-garbed priest could "encounter
hostile stares and comments."</TE>
<TE>   Said one priest: "The pain of our negligence or blindness is very
palpable here."</TE>
<TE>   While the context of his comment was [about] how these priests
were blind to the sexual activities of predator priests, I have to
comment on their current blindness and arrogance in such
insignificant acts.</TE>
<TE>   In her daily life, Mother Teresa's acts were of such significance
that these priests should be ashamed at their presumption that their
actions could be viewed with anything short of total disdain.</TE>
<TE>   I am not nor have ever been a Catholic and am not currently a
member of any church.</TE>
<TE>   However, the actions of the Catholic bishops and such priests have
injured and continue to injure the wider community.</TE>

<DH>Bright Balkan Morning: Romani Lives and the Power of Music
in Greek Macedonia, Photographs by Dick Blau, text by Charles and

<LD>"The power of music lies in its participatory discrepancies, and
these are basically of two kinds: processual and textural." So
declared Charles Keil in his previous book, "Music Grooves," an essay
collection he co-wrote with MacArthur Fellowship-winning
ethnomusicologist Steven Feld. Since you're probably wondering what
this jargoneering academic is spouting about, let him continue:
"Music, to be personally involving and socially valuable, must be
'out of time' and 'out of tune.' " Now perhaps you're getting Keil's
gist, grinning or just as likely grimacing. He's saying that any
music worth a damn forswears foursquare rhythms and pure note values.
But let him go on: "For participatory discrepancy one could
substitute 'inflection,' 'articulation,' 'creative tension,' 'relaxed
dynamism' or 'semiconscious or unconscious slightly out of syncness.'
For process one could say 'groove,' 'beat,' 'vital drive,' 'swing,'
'pulse' or 'push,' and for texture, 'timbre,' 'sound,' 'tone
qualities,' 'as arranged by' and so forth." And so on. You know.</LD>
<TE>   "Music Grooves" appeared in 1994, the third straight year in which
Keil had collaborated on a new book, and in 1995 won the University
of Chicago Folklore Prize. It's about far more than music or folklore
-- Feld's scholarship is broadly suggestive, and Keil is a strikingly
original anarcho-humanist thinker. Nevertheless, Keil remains almost
unknown outside the tiny discipline of ethnomusicology, where he cuts
too wide a swath and too many corners to enjoy the preeminence he
deserves. In 1966, at age 26, he published "Urban Blues," a study of
B.B. King and Bobby Blue Bland that both presaged rock criticism and
led ethnomusicology away from isolated nonurban "purity" into the
global village. Even so, "Bright Balkan Morning," Keil's sixth book,
is his best so far. Accommodating some 200 illustrations shot and
collected by photographer-collaborator Dick Blau, with a Feld
soundscape CD situating the somewhat archaic music of the Macedonian
Roma in a modern ambience of Stevie Wonder and Christmas carols, it's
a beautiful and important work recommended to anyone who cares about
how ordinary outsiders get by and get over in a world economy of
rampaging corporations and embattled nation states.</TE>
<TE>   Keil's theory of participatory discrepancy was seeded by his
experience of black musics in America and Africa. But it was
formulated after prolonged contact with the white ethnics of Polonia,
who inspired 1992's "Polka Happiness," and now the crucible of
northern Greece, where his wife and coauthor Angeliki grew up.
Fundamentally a musical concept, participatory discrepancy serves too
as metaphor and model for both universalist humanism and radical
pluralism. Africans meet Polish Americans meet "Gypsies"; the groove
of the process meets the roughness of the texture meets the
tense-yet-relaxed dynamism of the slightly out-of-sync.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than equating the serious with the somber, the
long-suffering, the tragic, Keil valorizes the urge to party: "Today
we let it all go -- release, discharge, breaking, spilling, spraying
-- we give of ourselves, our substance, to each other, and it feels
very good." And balancing Charles Keil's flights is Angeliki Keil's
detailed attention to human context. Not that Charles doesn't see
such things; he's a sensitive reporter who scrupulously follows the
money that passes to these professional musicians. But he leaves full
description to his wife, a sociologist who fills in some history and
contributes nine oral autobiographies and three round tables. And
first, Roma scholar Ian Hancock lays out origins.</TE>
<TE>   Gypsies, as the Roma are still often known, began as soldiers
and/or camp followers in armies raised in India to repel Islamic
invaders shortly after AD 1000. Their language is a patois inflected
by all the many tongues with which it's coexisted, especially
Byzantine Greek, and while their musical vocation goes back to their
army days, "Gypsy music" per se is a chimera. The Roma have no music
of their own -- Spanish flamenco and Hungarian verbunkos, both also
"Gypsy" genres, sound nothing like the zurna-and-dauli trios
chronicled by Keil, who had no luck locating the "authentic" music he
was told Greek-Macedonian Roma played for themselves. They are
entertainers who are prouder of their technique than their culture
and who call themselves "instrumentalists" rather than the artier
"musicians." Keil dwells on this distinction; he likes the idea of
artists being merely "instrumental," servants of some larger force.
In Macedonia, two such forces are prominent.</TE>
<TE>   First is the ancient sound of the zurna (imagine a cross between a
clarinet and an alto sax with wavery pitch), and the dauli (a
double-headed bass drum thumped with a big stick on one side and
rattled with a little one on the other). Second is the modern culture
clash of Greek Macedonia, where Keil breaks down influences into
"Vlach, Sarakatsan, Slavic, Pontic, Thracian, Romani -- and so many
more local variants" -- not least the "ethnic Greeks" from Asia Minor
who were forcibly repatriated circa 1923, after the Greco-Turkish
War. The zurnas, which are fighting a rear-guard battle against
clarinets, bouzoukis and DJ sound systems, link Macedonian revelers
to both immemorial ritual and the party ideal of kefi, a borrowed
Turkish term whose meaning Keil teases out in an eloquent end note.
But the zurnas achieve this link to the deep past only by
encompassing the heterogeneous impurity of the region where they
happen to survive.</TE>
<TE>   Given the ethnic warfare that triggered World War I and that has
beset the Balkans since the death of Tito, we may think of Greece as
a paragon of democratic stability. But into the bitterly fought
communist insurgency of the late '40s, its 20th century history was
every bit as Balkanized, with the Roma a visible dark-skinned
minority. Identified with none of the region's supposedly indigenous
groups, they mediate among all of them. Weddings typically bring
together families of inconveniently mixed ethnic loyalties as well as
a stew of bosses, clients, employees, co-workers, neighbors and
fellow students. As a result, Roma musicians pride themselves on
their knowledge of multiple song traditions, all filtered through
instruments that predate those traditions, played with technical
skill, crafty showmanship and expressive flair -- in strict request
order.</TE>
<TE>   "Bright Balkan Morning" celebrates the interactive energy of this
process -- the participatory discrepancies that animate the
relationship of an instrumentalist to his audience and his fellow
players. Moreover, its form embodies the values of collaboration --
Blau and Feld contribute illuminating essays, and in the end Angeliki
gets more pages than Charles. This is a plus -- her prose has
loosened up since "Polka Happiness," and her vivid description of the
war-ravaged Greece of her childhood helps establish a tone that the
interviews flesh out.</TE>
<TE>   The slant here could be branded anti-modern; after 30 years
pursuing an instrument that could be disappearing from the face of
the earth, no anarcho-humanist is likely to be down with disco sound
systems or, more broadly, capitalist development and homogenization.
But the Keils never allow their devotion to music to compromise their
deeper devotion to human society. Angeliki's documentation of the
material struggles of the Roma makes it seem not just natural but
admirable for the instrumentalists to count their money, move up the
class ladder and put music aside when a more remunerative line of
work presents itself in or out of Macedonia. And far from dismissing
self-consciously "cultural" if not government-supported attempts to
prop up old musics as unnatural, they welcome them as the progressive
historical developments they are. In the end, however, it's the music
itself that inspires Charles Keil -- music he describes with a vigor
and affection that's rare in any species of writing, much less the
academic kind: "With my back to a wall, I immediately feel the
throbbing overtones. Sometimes I feel them as an identifiable
higher-pitched tone inside my head, but more often they register as a
sensation of blurring, static, dust on the needle of a record player,
a buzz like the one that sometimes comes from being too close to the
speakers of a loud rock band." Mere sensationalism, sniff the
canon-keepers of "classical's" rival European tradition. Keil, who
has been combating this tradition all his life, begs to differ. The
party goal of kefi, he observes, is a conscious spiritual mechanism,
different from duende or Gemutlichkeit or even ecstasy -- more a
"contemplative 'emotional engrossment' " that shouldn't be
romanticized or sensationalized. "There is in Greek parties an
element of 'fake it until you make it,' as when African American
gospel shouters pretend to be filled with the holy spirit until in
fact they are. But as Greek partyers shout out 'Oh!' or 'Aman!' or
people at tables burst into song, they may be in their kefi or
inducing it in themselves and others, but they are not out of their
minds or having an 'out-of-body' experience."</TE>
<TE>   This is what Charles Keil envisions -- nothing less than a
reconciliation, as opposed to obliteration, of the mind-body dualism
that causes so much pain in the world. He's too realistic to believe
that this reconciliation will be accomplished in history with zurnas;
he'll be pleased if the horns he loves hang on at all. But he's never
going to stop promulgating it. "Bright Balkan Morning" is his
strongest argument yet.</TE>

<DH>A Cycle of the West, John G. Neihardt, University of

<LD>Epic poems are hard to come by, and no wonder. Traditionally they are
long, dense, stern, heroic, imbued with sentiment, written in
language ranging from dignified to majestic, charged with conflict
and all but impervious to anything coarse or comic. Nobody knows how
long Homer labored over "The Iliad" and "The Odyssey," or how long
Virgil pored over "The Aeneid," which runs to 12 books. Goethe
started on Faust in his youth but kept polishing it into his 80s. The
"Divine Comedy" proceeds for an even 100 cantos through Hell,
Purgatory and Paradise; the Mahabharata of India swarms with 90,000
couplets. And in all but the epics of the spirit world, each is
steeped in the milieu of its particular and specific region:
"Beowulf" is Old English; the "Nibelungenlied" is German; the
"Kalevala" is Finnish; "El Cid," Spanish; the Arthurian legends,
English; "Cuchulainn," the oldest epic poem of Western Europe, is as
Irish as Connemara.</LD>
<LD>   We, a relatively young country, have produced few epic poems,
notably "The Song of Hiawatha," for whose meter Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow borrowed the fine four-footed trochaic beat of the
"Kalevala," and Stephen Vincent Benet's "John Brown's Body." The
vigorous, mural-minded epic, "A Cycle of the West," written by the
late John G. Neihardt and published by a university press against
prevailing winds in the book industry, helps to make up for this
deficit.</LD>
<TE>   It was a work that occupied Neihardt for 29 years, during which
time he produced 505 pages of rhymed iambic pentameter, a prodigious
feat considering that very few of the couplets betray forced or
awkward rhyming partners. The narrative flows like the Missouri,
Neihardt's favorite river, through 40 panels of the "Cycle's"
cyclorama of characters, landscapes, seasons, wars and "tales of
struggle, triumph and defeat."</TE>
<TE>   Neihardt is best known for "Black Elk Speaks," the biography of
the Lakota visionary and healer. In the introduction to "A Cycle of
the West," he tells us that his maternal grandparents were "covered
wagon people" and that as a boy he lived in a sod house. "If I write
of hot winds and grasshoppers, of prairie fires and blizzards, of
dawns and noons and sunsets and nights, of brooding heat and
thunderstorms in vast lands, I knew them early."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the work is vivid, haunting, at times heart-rending, with
surges of power and beauty especially evocative to naturalists,
topographers and readers who find common ground with Henry David
Thoreau. Neihardt is at once poet, dramatist, historian, cicerone,
moralist and Greek chorus. His canvas teems with characters real and
invented, some Bunyanesque, and mingled among them are recognizable
figures such as George Armstrong Custer, Crazy Horse, Sitting Bull,
Red Cloud, various Great White Fathers and soldiers named Fetterman,
Powell, Harrington and Carrington.</TE>
<TE>   "Cycle" contains five narrative segments: "The Song of Three
Friends," "The Song of Hugh Glass," "The Song of Jed Smith," "The
Song of the Indian Wars" and "The Song of the Messiah." In each,
Neihardt's pentameter is firmly in charge. Even the brogue of a
brawny Irishman, Mike Fink, who represents the work's only approach
to comic relief, speaks the meter:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nor did I git me hand back from the slap</TE>
<TE>   I give him till he landed on my glim,</TE>
<TE>   And I was countin' siventeen of him</TE>
<TE>   And ivry dancin' wan of him was air!</TE>
<TE>   Faith, whin I hit him he was niver there;</TE>
<TE>   And sure it seemed that ivry wind that blew</TE>
<TE>   Was peltin' knuckles in me face. Hurroo!</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This grand mosaic of frontier days: of trappers and furriers and
their hard-bitten lives; of a frenzied bear that almost kills one of
them; of the telling -- still, rather doggedly, in iambs -- of a
poker game; of a terrifying prairie fire and even more terrible
battles in serial wars to dispossess Indians; of idealized dignity
and noble speeches by chiefs; of the perfidy of bumbling Great White
Fathers. And it is all this compounded in terms as lofty as they are
emotional. (It is a measure of Neihardt's ambition and imagining of
the "Cycle" that he wrote the dedication of an opening segment in
untranslated Greek.)</TE>
<TE>   Though Neihardt's focus is historic, he is still sensitive to the
land and to the seasons, and his language is similarly majestic.
"Bull-roaring March had swept across the land," he writes in one
instance. "A gently grieving thing like April rain," in another. And
"... May sickened into June ...." And when he lengthens his stride,
the effect is equally stirring,</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ... The curtain of the storm began to fray:</TE>
<TE>   The poplars' howling softened to a croon;</TE>
<TE>   The sun set clear, and dusk revealed the moon</TE>
<TE>   A thin-blown bubble in a crystal bowl</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Neihardt is severe at times. In a segment titled "The Yellow God,"
he writes of the Gold Rush:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And through the cities went the singing lure,</TE>
<TE>   Where drearily the human welter squirms</TE>
<TE>   Like worms that lick the slime of other worms</TE>
<TE>   That all may flourish. ...</TE>
<TE>   Sell the family cow!</TE>
<TE>   Go pawn the homestead! Life was knocking now!</TE>
<TE>   There might not ever be another knock.</TE>
<TE>   Bring forth the hoarding of the hidden sock,</TE>
<TE>   Pour coppers from the dear dead eyes of Joy!</TE>
<TE>   Go seek the god that weighs the soul by troy;</TE>
<TE>   Be saved, and let the devil take the rest!</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It would be a joy to report no downside to Neihardt's enterprise,
but even Homer nods. There are outcroppings of archaisms and
inversions: "But hark!"; "of evil hap"; "the swoln Missouri's flank";
"It came to pass" (eight times); "conspirant with the overbending
skies"; "the litten smoke"; "there lurked some crouchant thing";
"tempestuously broke the day." But such infelicitous turns are
outnumbered by passages of grace and authority.</TE>
<TE>   In the final chapter, "The Song of the Messiah," Neihardt abandons
narrative course and sublimates his story to a stirring apotheosis
steeped in metaphysical religiosity. It deals at length with The Holy
One, The Everlasting Word, the Savior, the Holy Tree, The Nations of
the Dead, "a shining that was not the sun's," "the faith that grasses
know," Wakatanka (The Great Spirit) and ultimately Jesus.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ... it was He! That starry calm</TE>
<TE>   Was on His face. In either lifted palm</TE>
<TE>   A white scar gleamed; and there upon His side</TE>
<TE>   The wound Wasichus gave Him when He died</TE>
<TE>   Was like a scarlet flower ....</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The ending raises an issue, not about separation of church and
statement but about what may be construed as incompatible with what
has preceded it. While in keeping with Neihardt's literary
temperament, it becomes from today's perspective perhaps too
metaphysical. Whether such an engagement enhances or damages the work
becomes a matter of the reader's taste. Whatever the resolution --
temporal, historical or religious -- this long-jointed poem is an
extraordinary transit of terrain, not tidied by airplane-window
perspectives but through vast, rugged, challengingly inhospitable
terrain, scarred by struggle, massacre and war: an epic that is by
turns vivid, exalted, devastating, bloody and beautiful.</TE>

<HD>The original soul man</HD>
<DH>Josh White: Society Blues, Elijah Wald, Routledge: 352 pp.,
$21.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anthony Heilbut</AU>
<BD>Anthony Heilbut is the author of "The Gospel Sound:
Good News and Bad Times," "Exiled In Paradise" and "Thomas Mann: Eros
and Literature."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Elijah Wald first mentioned Josh White to his parents, their
memories clashed. His father recalled an earthy laborer, sweating
soulfully; his mother, a sleek entertainer who changed his silk shirt
twice during a performance. The greatest strength of Wald's "Josh
White: Society Blues" is its recognition that this division was
intrinsic to White's career and that its balance of folk art and show
business was singular, inspired and even heroic.</LD>
<LD>   White was a cusp artist who consolidated his style as country
blues was winding down and gospel music was revving up. He was born
Feb. 11, 1914, in Greenville, S.C., the son of a laundress and a
tailor who served as a part-time preacher in a Methodist church. Much
of his childhood was ill-starred. His father was beaten so badly by
the police that he ended his days in a mental institution, and his
mother could barely support White and his six siblings. He went on
the road at the age of 8, guiding blind itinerant singer-guitarists,
banging the tambourine, witnessing two lynchings, shivering and
starving but sending home good money.</LD>
<TE>   But his precocious talent made a way for him. He was handsome and
popular, and the beneficiary of a childhood as artistically fruitful
as it was otherwise barren. The main reason was his mother's
participation in a sanctified church, one of the small Pentecostal
congregations where song and dance comprised most of the service. The
harmonic and melodic demands of religious music were far more
expansive than blues, and mastering them enabled White to much later
"adapt his style to jazz, pop, and European folk melodies." (A
similar education led a classical vocalists like Marian Anderson to
progress from spirituals to lieder).</TE>
<TE>   Blue notes came originally out of church moans and slurs, and a
gospel singer could apply them whenever, wherever. Blues itself might
not even be the best vehicle, but White knew that blue tonality was
his ace. In 1950, while allowing that white men could play jazz and
blues, he added, "Negro musicians manage to get those in-between
tones, that sort of strained intonation, better than any white
musician can." It was the closest he ever came to a racial challenge.</TE>
<TE>   His recording career began at 18. Wald allows that these early
blues exhibit a callow facility but insists that the great work lay
years ahead. I disagree. From the beginning, White's style was fully
achieved and strikingly new, at least for blues. Greenville was the
home of the Dixie Hummingbirds, later to become a world-famous gospel
quartet, and White is more properly measured not against Blind Lemon
Jefferson and Blind Willie Johnson but against the Hummingbirds and
its lead singer, Ira Tucker, or the group's bass singer in 1939,
Claude Jeter, who later cultivated a slinky falsetto that would be
shamelessly echoed by Al Green. Within a few measures of his first
record, "Black and Evil Blues," White leaps into falsetto. A few
takes later, his voice drops an octave into a growling bass, part
Louis Armstrong, part storefront preacher. Within the first session,
he covers almost three octaves. His first instrument had been the
tambourine, and he clearly loved percussive, rapid-fire syllables,
occasionally singing such lines a cappella because his fingers
weren't quick enough.</TE>
<TE>   In 1927, Blind Willie Johnson had recorded the first gospel blues
(a minor-key version of the 16-bar form), "Motherless Children," in
which his guitar, standing in for the congregation, frequently
completed his thoughts in sustained non-vocalized moans. Similarly,
White's use of "passing chords" to bind the melodic units derived
from melisma, the extravagantly configured runs of a lined-out hymn.
Having learned from quartets to sing different vocal parts, White
played his guitar high and low, indeed several keys lower than Blind
Willie, as if voice and guitar obeyed the same impulse. He seldom
belted, preferring a dry, laconic style (not the obvious choice of a
young virtuoso) and his reading of songs like "Things About Coming My
Way" exhibited an introspective authority that could not be faked
unless he was a better actor at 18 than he would be in his 50s.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps better than his blues, which he recorded under the names
Joshua White and Pinewood Tom, were the gospel recordings attributed
to "Joshua White (The Singing Christian)." In his early masterpiece,
"There's a Man Goin' Around Taking Names," a song he recorded many
times but never with the same intensity as the first version, an ad
lib spirit allows him all kinds of sanctified freedom ("lord, lord,
lord, takin' names") and a blood-curdling conclusion ("he's writing
left and right, among the colored and the white").</TE>
<TE>   Pace Wald, the young White was a trailblazer in blues and gospel:
His "In the Evening" anticipated Robert Johnson's phrasing by two
years, and in August 1935, he became only the third artist to record
one of the new songs known as "gospel," composed by the man who named
the genre, Thomas A. Dorsey. In "How About You," White sings out as
if in church, his guitar deliriously breaking time, grabbed by the
Holy Ghost.</TE>
<TE>   Most remarkable about White's early records is their juxtaposition
of secular, sacred and (latently) political. On one session,
supported by Walter Roland's churchily florid piano, he veered from
"Sissy Man Blues" and "Homeless and Hungry Blues" to biblically
derived gospel songs, all of them brilliant performances. Another
recording, "Prodigal Son," a deathbed confession to a brokenhearted
mother, was released under Pinewood Tom's name but would have wrecked
any church with its terrifying vision of the wages of sin. In later
years, White's repertory would encompass more sophisticated lyrics
but none richer in thematic terms.</TE>
<TE>   By the mid-1930s, he had moved to New York, where, at 19, he
married Carol Carr, an unglamorous, practical woman, the well-chosen
wife of a sensationally handsome man, cocksure and gregarious to a
fault. A crippling hand injury nearly ended his career, and he spent
the next years doing manual labor to support Carol and their kids.
But by 1939, through a series of fortuitous connections well traced
by Wald, he had entered a whole new world, that of folk music. Though
his chops had been compromised (his high notes shot along with his
speedy arpeggios), he adopted a style that retained his best
qualities: When he sang "Strange Fruit," his version was far more
churchy than Billie Holiday's, stressing words like "blood" in a way
that interrupted the legato flow to great expressive purpose and
adding moaned vocals that duplicated his passing chords. He was also
singing lyrics that were defiantly political.</TE>
<TE>   White was embraced by the musical left, black and white. Black
progressives had argued throughout the 1930s about the political
implications of folklore. Richard Wright declared that blues were the
new spirituals, their visionary leaps more than compensating for the
forays into violence and mindless sex (similar apologies have been
mounted for rap). As White replaced his more evangelical spirituals
with freedom songs, he sounded like a working-class radical, a figure
black progressives had despaired of finding. The white left was even
more gratified to claim White. He may have briefly joined the
Communist Party, perhaps because its civil rights positions were
unimpeachable, at least before World War II, when the party opposed
labor strikes and civil rights protests as diversions from the effort
to defeat Hitler and save Stalin.</TE>
<TE>   On the strength of albums produced by John Hammond, he made new
fans in the Roosevelts. Two years after the Daughters of the American
Revolution refused to let Anderson perform in Constitution Hall, an
act that prompted a mass protest led by Eleanor Roosevelt, FDR's 1941
inaugural gala, held at Constitution Hall, would include White and
the Golden Gate Jubilee Quartet, along with Charlie Chaplin, Ethel
Barrymore and Mickey Rooney, and the Daughters didn't say a mumbling
word.</TE>
<TE>   But despite his new public, the former star of "race records" --
the term used at the time for rhythm and blues -- had lost his own.
He griped that black bobby-soxers only wanted to hear double-entendre
blues like "Jelly Jelly" and lacked the patience for deeper, more
political anthems. But you can't blame them. In 1940 White's vocal
support had come from quartets such as the Golden Gates and the
Carolinians (whose tenor, Bayard Rustin, would undergo a political
journey more amazing even than White's, rising to his creation of the
1963 March on Washington, after which he would be hounded out of the
movement because of his sexual nature, and die, the rare black -- and
probably the only openly gay man -- to be lamented in Commentary).</TE>
<TE>   With the Carolinians, White had romped through "King Jesus Knows
That I'm Coming," a rearrangement of a song Mahalia Jackson had
recorded three years earlier. But by 1944, his vocal accompaniment
came from the dreary Almanac Singers in a lumbering Popular Front
rewrite of the spiritual "Hold On," which offered Godspeed to FDR,
Churchill, Chiang Kai-Shek and Stalin (what a quartet -- and who sang
lead?). How could such music inspire black audiences when they could
fly with the Dixie Hummingbirds?</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, "Jelly Jelly" was his signature. For, as Wald stresses,
White was a surpassingly sexual performer. Traces of his multi-octave
range now informed a variety of liquid gobbles and ecstatic squeaks
that left nothing to a woman's imagination. As he had introduced blue
notes to polite society, he now became the first soul man, a muscular
athlete, supremely comfortable in his gleaming skin. No black man had
displayed himself so confidently before a white audience (the
light-skinned, wavy-haired Cab Calloway represented something more
stylized and frenetic). Josh White Jr., a star in his own right,
marvels at his father's audacity: "It's lucky he didn't get killed
for it." You get a sense of White's magnetism from a video, "Free and
Equal Blues" (available from Vestapol), which includes performances
made almost 20 years after his prime. As women always noted, when he
tunes his guitar, he's actually flexing his muscles. His carriage is,
at once, dignified and tantalizing. During "Jelly, Jelly," his
shoulders rock sinuously while he strokes and pounds his guitar, more
love object than musical tool. At 48, he makes rockers such as Elvis
and Mick Jagger seem gauche and unseasoned.</TE>
<TE>   White's persona seduced his listeners, female and male alike. He
despised anything that smacked of the stereotype: In 1939, he
deplored the use of "nigger" in Broadway lyrics. In 1951, he demanded
the excision of black-face Al Jolson routines in a London musical.
All showman, he reckoned himself an "actor," not a "clown," his
brutally dismissive term for older artists such as Leadbelly. It
signifies that his pupils included women like the singers Libby
Holman and Eartha Kitt (both may have been his lovers; the army was
very large). He showed them how to flirt and not pander, and they
showed him that one could be provocative and enigmatic, tease and
give nothing away.</TE>
<TE>   The 1940s were White's glory days. He had a near-pop hit, "One
Meat Ball," packed the best clubs and appeared in a movie with
Randolph Scott. He popularized what he considered the anti-"Strange
Fruit," "The House I Live In," an inspirational anthem that he sang
without any blue notes, as if to extend its democratic embrace.
(Frank Sinatra was equally known for the song; comparing the two
versions reveals Sinatra to be more formal and derivatively bel
canto: White's later version of "One for My Baby" also benefits by
comparison.)</TE>
<TE>   But the good times ended with the McCarthy era. In an attempt to
win the support of the publication Red Channels and thereby escape
its black list that might -- and would eventually -- stymie his
career, he met with right-wing journalists and even volunteered to
testify before Sen. Joseph McCarthy's House Un-American Activities
Committee. He named no names, distancing himself only from Paul
Robeson's putative declaration that no Negro would fight against the
Soviet Union (Robeson had in fact been misquoted). Instead he
deplored communism itself while asserting that whatever elements he
admired in the movement dovetailed exactly with "Christianity,"
boasting that he had raised his children to be devout patriots. He
was proud that so few Negroes had joined the party, thereby
displaying their "common sense," and told Negro Digest that the Reds
had played him for a chump. Naturally White's old lefty friends were
appalled. But when Pete Seeger composed an angry letter, his fellow
Weavers proved less judgmental. They understood that White was
terrified of jeopardizing the security of his wife and children and
that the government might have blackmailed him with revealing
photographs.</TE>
<TE>   But Jackie Washington, a folk singer greatly inspired by White,
offers the most convincing, if disheartening, analysis. White simply
didn't have a dog in the hunt. He hadn't been a committed radical,
and, finally, he was a black man trying to get over, "taking care of
business." If the lefties could say they made him by supplying his
first white audience, he could reply that he gave them authenticity
and proved that they were more than bourgeois academics.</TE>
<TE>   From cynosure to pariah, White became a despised figure in
vanguard circles. Though his career survived, particularly in Europe,
American folkies increasingly saw him as a burned-out case. They had
loved him singing protest songs, but they blasted his more recent
performances of English and Irish ballads. Yet these performances
were very fine. In "Molly Malone," he characteristically emphasized
the word "crying" and with each reading supplied more inspired blue
notes. He took "Barbara Allen" and, with bluesy glissandi,
immediately split the difference between Childe Ballad and Grand Ole
Opry. Two highlights of the 1960s video are "Danny Boy," exactly the
kind of ditty that his family would have sung around the piano, and
"You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To," wherein he moans whole phrases,
perhaps because he has forgotten the words and, as the spiritual
advises, was looking to the hills.</TE>
<TE>   The contemporaries he now considered rivals were Harry Belafonte,
who had capitalized on his most commercial traits; and Ray Charles,
whom he would mimic in the car and, supposedly, out-holler. Why not?
Both Charles and White had uncovered the soulful elements in country
music.</TE>
<TE>   With suave tact, Wald considers some very intimate matters. We
learn that White was a father engaged enough to comfort one daughter
during her first period and to introduce his son to a sexual partner
when the boy was 11. The children led middle-class lives, attended
private school, never heard him speak ungrammatically and were
stunned by the colloquial slang of his first records. Wald also
interviewed two of White's lovers, one of whom reveals that he
occasionally sold his favors to rich women. Nor did she blame him: He
had a family to support. Most amazing are the interviews with his
wife. She knew everything and accepted it, having decided that, in
this case, she had to be the greater lover, confident that he would
always return home.</TE>
<TE>   To the last, White remained a trouper. In his last popular
incarnation, he became the college boy's Johnny Mathis with
recordings of love songs that provided all the soundtrack a folkie
needed. He played smaller clubs to sparser crowds, traveled circuits
in the South that were still largely segregated, was obliged to hock
his guitar more than once, was shamed to see his wife go out and get
a job. Judging by a photo of his mother, psoriasis ran in the family,
and he was tormented by the ailment in, of all places, his fingers.
He suffered from ulcers and heart problems, drank and smoked too
much, worried always about his position as both a black man and an
artist who was dismissed by ignorant latecomers, in Wald's fine
phrase, after having "nurtured the aesthetic that now condemned him."</TE>
<TE>   He died at 55 in 1969, a victim of "all this hard traveling." Wald
lets Carol White have the last words. Despite the infidelities, which
extended to feeble attempts on his deathbed, White remained her man.
After he died, she tried to hold up and be brave, but once she neared
the house he had killed himself to buy, "it was over. It was over."
He had wished to be cremated, but she buried him in an open coffin,
dressed so that he might be "as handsome in death as he was on the
stage." She never failed him.</TE>
<TE>   The wisest remark about popular culture comes from Marcel Proust.
He wrote, "The people always have the same messengers": their
songwriters. "And a book of old songs should move us like a town or a
tomb." It's so, whether the song is "Lili Marlene" or "Molly Malone,"
"Yesterday" or "Tomorrow," "Beer Barrel Polka" or "Get Ur Freak On."
A book about popular music should evoke that spirit. Wald's book does
that and more while reminding us of the naysayers who would still
give White a hard time. Rock is anything but pure, yet in their most
triumphal moments, rock critics remain as convinced of their ability
to detect inauthenticity as the folkies who turned White into an
invisible man: the credo having survived the aesthetic and the
politics.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile the interplay of hot sex and hot gospel remains as
potent as in the days of Pinewood Tom a.k.a. the Singing Christian.
Witness Destiny's Child's inclusion on the same album as
"Bootylicious" the hymn "Jesus Loves Me." Oh, Josh, you should be
alive today.</TE>

<HD>Tales through dark glasses</HD>
<DH>Things You Should Know, A.M. Homes, HarperCollins: 224 pp.,
$23.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jonathan Levi</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Levi is a contributing writer to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The writer A.M. Homes has been compared to Vladimir Nabokov. She has
been compared to Samuel Beckett and John Cheever. Her first book,
"The Safety of Objects," is being turned into a movie starring Glenn
Close. She has won a Guggenheim Fellowship. Yet the 11 stories that
form her latest collection, "Things You Should Know," provide a
perplexing lack of explanation for this very real success.</LD>
<LD>   These are stories of alienation and dysfunction, perennially
popular themes. And some of them show early signs of blossoming into
stories. In "Remedy," a 35-year-old-woman, lost in a mediocre
relationship, goes home for the weekend only to find that a strange
man has moved into her old house and stolen her parents' affections.
In "Georgica," a young woman on the rebound from a car accident and a
canceled wedding wanders the beaches of the Hamptons in search of
recently filled condoms that might provide her with a commitment-free
form of impregnation.</LD>
<LD>   A couple of stories feature suicidal whiners married to
super-competent woman (who nevertheless arm themselves against
disappointment by hiding Louisville Sluggers under their nuptial
beds).</LD>
<TE>   Yet Homes nurtures her premises with either a bland prose or a
self-conscious stylization that suffocates whatever life might be
possible. In "The Chinese Lesson," the Caucasian husband of an Asian
American woman tries to connect to the Chinese culture she has so
emphatically rejected. When his ailing mother-in-law, Mrs. Ha, comes
to live with them, Geordie finds a way to connect. He has a microchip
implanted in Mrs. Ha's back. Armed with a global-positioning screen,
he can track his mother-in-law when she goes on walkabout.</TE>
<TE>   Not a bad variation on a Henny Youngman joke. Unfortunately,
Homes' timing is more sledgehammer than borscht belt. "I am walking,
holding a small screen," Geordie's story begins, "watching the green
dot move like the blip of a plane, the blink of a ship's radar.
Searching. I am on the lookout for submarines. I am an air traffic
controller trying to keep everything at the right distance. I am
lost."</TE>
<TE>   Then, lest there be any doubt as to the nature of the battle lines
--Geordie and Mrs. Ha (the lost ones) vs. Susan (nee Ha) -- Homes
silences them with geography and carpentry. "Susan is minimal, flat
like Kansas. She is physically non-existent, a plank of wood, planed,
smooth. There is nothing to curl around, nothing to hold onto."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the prose masquerades as poetry, as in the opening to
"Remedy." "It is about wanting and need, wanting and need -- a
peculiar, desperate kind of need, needing to get what you never got,
wanting it still, wanting it more, nonetheless." Even Kansas has more
hills.</TE>
<TE>   This may be the salient feature of the Homes universe: that color
and imagination are as unattainable in prose as they are in life. If
this universe can be described at all, it must be described
impersonally, since all personality is suspect: "There is a girl in
the backyard, floating alone on a raft in the water. There is a
tremor. The lights in the house flicker, the alarm goes off. In the
pool, the water shifts, a small tidal wave sweeps from one end to the
other, splashing up onto the concrete," Homes writes in not one but
two stories, "Raft in Water, Floating," and "The Weather Is Sunny and
Bright Outside."</TE>
<TE>   Now compare a pool described by, say, Homes' predecessor in
suburban commentary, Cheever: "The pool, fed by an artesian well with
a high iron content, was a pale shade of green. It was a fine day. In
the west there was a massive stand of cumulus cloud so like a city
seen from a distance -- from the bow of an approaching ship -- that
it might have had a name. Lisbon. Hackensack." Or a similar scene
from a certain book by Nabokov: " ... then, without warning, a blue
sea-wave swelled under my heart and, from a mat in a pool of sun,
half-naked, kneeling, turning about on her knees, there was my
Riviera love peering at me over dark glasses."</TE>
<TE>   There are those, evidently, who read something more into Homes,
who see Cheever in Homes, the way Humbert saw a Siren in a skin-kneed
prepubescent. But sometimes Kansas is only Kansas, and flat fails to
rise.</TE>

<HD>The scoop on Scotty Reston</HD>
<DH>Scotty, James B. Reston and the Rise and Fall of American
Journalism, John F. Stacks, Little, Brown: 374 pp., $29.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Kaiser</AU>
<BD>Charles Kaiser, a reporter for the New York Times in
the 1970s, is the author of "The Gay Metropolis: 1940-1996" and "1968
in America."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>James Reston is already a name that means little to most people under
age 30, but for several decades, his reporting was the standard that
most serious newspapermen and -women used to measure the quality of
their work. The bulwark of the Washington bureau of the New York
Times from the 1950s to the 1970s, Reston was a master stylist and a
master scoop artist. His style was the product of early insecurity
that fueled years of hard work, including the keeping of "notes of
vivid phrases" as a cub at Associated Press. Most of the scoops came
from emulating his mentor, Walter Lippmann. During their time in
Washington, only Reston matched Lippmann's flair for ingratiation
with the man of the moment, whether it was John Foster Dulles or
Henry A. Kissinger.</LD>
<LD>   As John F. Stacks makes clear in "Scotty," Reston's improbably
patrician sense of himself often enabled him to project a kind of
evenhanded objectivity -- until the end, when his work slid into
sycophancy. In many ways, Reston's 1991 autobiography, "Deadline: A
Memoir," is a richer read than Stacks'. Indeed, Stacks borrows from
"Deadline" to fill in the gaps in his own narrative, yet his book is
valuable as an affectionate portrait that also depicts the less
admirable aspects of Reston's character.</LD>
<TE>   Years before E.B. White's observation that success requires a
willingness to be lucky, Reston had mastered that lesson. As with so
many all-American-up-from-nowhere sagas, there was nothing in his
Ohio childhood to herald his eventual prominence. The son of
impoverished Scottish immigrants, Reston was spurred on by his
father's earthy charm, his mother's rigid discipline and his own
terror of "being ridiculed as an outsider."</TE>
<TE>   Luck started early for him -- in high school, where he became a
star golfer and, soon after, the caddie at the Dayton Country Club
for James Middleton Cox, publisher of the Dayton Daily News (in 1920,
Cox had also been the Democratic candidate for president). A few
years later, when Reston's $100 college tuition check bounced because
the Ohio bank on which it was drawn had failed during the Depression,
it was Cox who rescued him with a $100 loan and, later, a job at his
newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   In his first job with AP in New York, Reston struggled a bit on
$45 a week, but when he met the great ocean liners in New York's
harbor to interview "arriving big shots," he got a free breakfast
that was big enough to last him all day. His colleagues wrote their
stories on flimsy paper and filed them on the legs of homing pigeons,
which flew from the ship to their roosts atop newspaper buildings.
Then, when he was still 25, he got his first nationally syndicated
column, "A New Yorker at Large," which he wrote six days a week. It
made him "a welcome unpaying guest all over town, with tickets to the
shows or the opera and even the run of all the big restaurants."</TE>
<TE>   The luck continued when Reston was sent to London by AP to be a
sportswriter -- and then was hired by the London bureau of the New
York Times on Sept. 1, 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland and World
War II began. Just seven days later, Reston displayed the prose style
that made him one of the wisest hires the Times ever made: "The
world's largest city folded up tonight, just like London, Ohio. After
a week of war there is not a single play or movie in town; there is
not a chink of light in Piccadilly Circus; the big restaurants are
deserted, and the boys didn't even play football in London today ...
If you can possibly imagine all the youngsters from the lower East
Side and Hell's Kitchen and Brooklyn and the Bronx suddenly thrown
into every corner of every safe mansion in Westchester and upper New
York State and New Jersey, you will have a vague idea of what the
evacuation was like."</TE>
<TE>   "The writing was luminous, full of clever images, yet relaxed,
even casual," Stacks writes. And, most important, "it was not like
anything else that was appearing in the Times of that era." When
Reston was simply a superb hard-news reporter, his work left him
practically without a peer. But he quickly became a power player in
his own right; that was when he began to do things which seem more
questionable with the passage of time.</TE>
<TE>   Stacks provides a quote from Russell Baker's memoirs that best
encapsulates Reston's character: "There was an old-fashioned, boyish
look about him. With black hair, slightly curly, and a wide mouth
that smiled readily, and a brow so serene that it seemed never to
have scowled. At first glance he looked as if he might have stepped
down from an old photograph over the velveteen settee in a 1912
parlor. The eyes told a rather different story. He had the shrewdest,
wisest, most disconcerting gaze I had ever seen on an honest man."</TE>
<TE>   The shrewdness led to his hiring of such magnificent talent as
Baker, Robert B. Semple Jr., Tom Wicker, Linda Greenhouse, Steve
Rattner and David Dunlap. But it also led to the cultivation of all
those powerful men, and that's where the trouble started. "There was,
at the heart of Reston's style of journalism, a sense of common
purpose with the government and political leaders," Stacks writes.
"The press and the government, although with different interests and
different priorities, were seen by Reston as collaborators in one
enterprise, the preservation of the United States of America."</TE>
<TE>   That attitude will sound like sacrilege to many journalists who
came of age after Watergate and were trained to believe that they
must always assume an adversarial posture with their subjects. But
Stacks argues that during most of Reston's career, his approach
yielded excellent results. Because he had superb judgment, Reston
could provide an intimate and balanced analysis of the good and bad
things the government was doing.</TE>
<TE>   When Reston crossed the line from insider to outright
collaborator, however, it could lead to disaster. On the eve of the
1945 Yalta Conference, Arthur Vandenberg, a "self-important and very
isolationist Michigan Republican" and ranking minority member of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, showed Reston a speech he wanted
to give urging Western Allies to restrain Soviet expansionism. Reston
thought it was pretty good, but he told the senator it was "only half
a speech."</TE>
<TE>   Rather than stop there, Reston suggested that Vandenberg add the
idea of a treaty among the Soviet Union, France, Britain and the
United States opposing any future German expansion. Vandenberg jumped
at the suggestion, and the speech caused a sensation. Despite his
role in writing it (Lippmann later claimed he was the co-author),
Reston felt no compunction about praising the speech in the Times as
"wise and statesmanlike." Three years later, he cited the speech in
an article for Life that argued for Vandenberg's suitability for the
Republican presidential nomination. In his memoirs, Reston insisted
that he had never endorsed Vandenberg for the presidency, but he
admitted that the piece in Life was a "foolish mistake" for which the
Times "properly rebuked me."</TE>
<TE>   This embarrassing incident reveals a degree of collaboration
between reporter and politician that makes last month's allegations
that Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes had improperly cooperated with the
Bush administration look like the mildest of misdemeanors.</TE>
<TE>   By the beginning of the 1970s, Reston seemed to have let down his
guard altogether. Kissinger was a master media handler, but no one
was more successfully manipulated by him than Reston. In December
1972, the Times Pentagon correspondent filed a story predicting the
imminent resumption of the bombing of North Vietnam, but when
Kissinger told Reston that it wasn't true, Reston got the story
spiked. Then the bombing resumed -- with Kissinger's private support
-- but because it provoked such a violent reaction, Kissinger
persuaded Reston to write another column saying "it may be and
probably is true that Mr. Kissinger as well as Secretary of State
Rogers ... are opposed to the president's bombing offensive in North
Vietnam." Revealingly, Reston writes nothing about this incident in
his memoir. Instead, there is a seven-page homage to Kissinger's
genius -- an obeisance duly rewarded with a blurb from Kissinger on
Reston's book.</TE>
<TE>   Reston's least successful year was 1968, when publisher Arthur
"Punch" Sulzberger asked him to serve as interim executive edtior
before Sulzberger decided to make A.M. Rosenthal the head of the
daily paper. Reston admitted that he had no aptitude for the editor's
job and never felt at home in New York: It was a city that always
"scared" him. When he returned to Washington as a mere columnist, his
interactions with Kissinger led to some of the sharpest criticism of
his career. In 1972, former Times reporter J. Anthony Lukas accused
Reston of lapsing into irrelevancy after the upheavals of the 1960s.
"Some of those who have worked ... with Reston ... may wish that he
were a little less cozy with power," said Lukas, "a little less
reverential toward the System, a little more outspoken about the
evils they detect in American society." When Reston published his
memoirs in 1991 after retiring at 80, he offered no answers to his
critics.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, while Stacks never shies away from criticism of his
subject, he remains firmly in Reston's corner -- showing the same
talent for balance that Reston had at the peak of his career. "I do
firmly believe," he writes, "that this nation would be better served
if there were again Scotty Restons mining the inner workings of the
government and telling us the truth about what they pry loose." In an
era when cable news "journalists" like Bill O'Reilly now command the
prominence that Reston once enjoyed, who could disagree with that
judgment?</TE>

of an American Song, Jody Rosen, Scribner: 224 pp., $24</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ken Emerson</AU>
<BD>Ken Emerson is the author of "Doo-dah!: Stephen Foster
and the Rise of American Popular Culture." He is writing a book about
pop songwriters in New York City during the 1950s and '60s.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Songs make history," Irving Berlin declared. "And history makes
songs." Yet a precious few songs outlive their eras and elude, if not
transcend, history. This is especially true in America, land of
diversity and novelty, where tradition is short and memory shorter.
It takes more than a catchy tune, a heartfelt lyric and a hook to
make a standard that sticks in our scattered national consciousness.</LD>
<LD>   Steve Turner's "Amazing Grace: The Story of America's Most Beloved
Song" and Jody Rosen's "White Christmas: The Story of an American
Song" explore how two such standards were written and why they have
endured. An Englishman and former slave trader writes a hymn beloved
by African Americans. A cantor's son from Russia takes the Christ out
of Christmas and composes one of America's favorite Christmas songs.
These ironies, far from being coincidental, are essential to both
songs' staying power. To be sure, the slow waves of melody that crest
midway through "Amazing Grace" are both uplifting and lulling, and
the hints of dissonance and minor and diminished chords imbue "White
Christmas" with a haunting melancholy. But religious and racial
confusion -- muddling colors and creeds, the sacred and the secular
-- augments these songs' appeal.</LD>
<TE>   Much of America's most successful popular music embraces such
contrarieties as eagerly as Walt Whitman's poetry. It's a way to get
one's arms around our motley multitudes. John Wesley, the founder of
Methodism, saluted John Newton, author of the lyrics of "Amazing
Grace," as "a healer of breaches, a reconciler of honest but
prejudiced men, and a uniter (happy work!) of the children of God."
"Amazing Grace" and "White Christmas" are uniters, dissolving
people's differences in piety and kitsch, yet each retains a tang of
contrariness that honors those differences.</TE>
<TE>   Turner's book is a twofer: a biography of John Newton and an
account of "Amazing Grace" since its composition in 1773. Turner, the
author of five previous books about rock 'n' roll, is a Christian of
unspecified but evidently evangelical affiliation. Some readers will
find it disconcerting when he writes, "It was as though God had put
his hand on my shoulder" or observes, "Slavery was as acceptable as
abortion is today ...."</TE>
<TE>   But Turner's faith gives him a profound empathy for Newton's
spiritual odyssey from a shanghaied sailor, deserter, blasphemer and
slaver to an Anglican minister, hymnodist and antislavery crusader.
It also lends him insights into how differently the song has been
understood over the centuries. Noting that an encounter group
inspired Judy Collins to record the first and biggest hit version of
the song, Turner comments, "In the era of transformative therapies
'Amazing Grace' was no longer automatically perceived as a song about
the mercy of God but as a celebration of human potential."</TE>
<TE>   Reconstructing Newton's life at sea and in Africa requires a lot
of "probablys" and "would have beens." Turner makes imaginative use
of seafarers' journals and letters to contrast life above-decks,
where officers amused themselves with games and dancing, and
below-decks, where seamen abused each other and livestock. At its
best, Turner's account has the briny savor of a Patrick O'Brian
novel, but it occasionally wanders off course in irrelevant detail or
sinks into sheer surmise, as when he speculates that Newton "may have
used slave girls for sex" or "may have taken short-term African
'wives.' " Pondering these possibilities, Turner betrays a startling
racial, cultural and gender bias when he supports "the fact that
African women didn't think it immoral to sleep with someone they
might never see again" by citing as his sole authority an Englishman
who enjoyed the favors of village chieftains' "concubines."</TE>
<TE>   Turner is more interested in words than in music, which he
describes less vividly than Rosen in "White Christmas." Perhaps this
is because "Amazing Grace," like many hymns of its era, was
originally sung to a variety of familiar tunes by congregations who
seldom read music. It took 62 years for Newton's verses to find the
melody we recognize today in a famous American compendium of hymns,
"The Southern Harmony." "Amazing Grace" was always more popular in
America than in England, which preferred another Newton hymn,
"Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken." Turner conscientiously
chronicles the song's semi-independent development in the white and
black churches of the South, its introduction to the North after the
Civil War by evangelists like Dwight Moody and Ira Sankey, and its
appropriation by the folk revival and civil rights movement.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought of it as a Christian song," Joan Baez says, which
is as perfectly understandable as never thinking of "White Christmas"
as a Jewish song. Rosen's "White Christmas" is three books in one: a
detailed account of the song, a deft biographical sketch of Berlin
and a whirlwind tour of 20th century American popular culture. Rosen
traces the song's origins to a revue that Berlin contemplated but did
not complete, and he suggests that one reason "White Christmas" is
"the darkest, bluest tune ever to masquerade as a Christmas carol" is
that the holiday had not been "merry and bright" for Berlin and his
Catholic second wife since the death of their infant son on Christmas
Day, 1928, 12 years before Berlin composed "White Christmas."</TE>
<TE>   While Rosen is psychologically astute, I wish he didn't use the
word "carol" so naively. Carols are religious, and "White Christmas"
does not qualify as "the Great American Christmas Carol" or rank with
"O Little Town of Bethlehem" and "Go Tell It on the Mountain." Like
"Silver Bells" and "I Saw Mama Kissing Santa Claus," "White
Christmas" is a Christmas song, and even within this secular seasonal
category, "Jingle Bells" is every bit as all-American, nearly a
century older and more widely sung.</TE>
<TE>   Rosen doesn't have to stake exaggerated claims for "White
Christmas" to make his first book a gold mine of information and
insight. The first volume of Gary Giddins' biography of Bing Crosby
ends in 1940, leaving Rosen plenty of elbow room to chronicle
Crosby's recording of the song and the making of the movie that
introduced the song, "Holiday Inn." Because the 1942 film was
otherwise highly forgettable, Rosen reminds readers that Crosby
performed one sequence in blackface and links "White Christmas" to
burnt-cork minstrelsy and 19th century songs that pined for a lost
childhood home and appealed to Americans uprooted by immigration and
urbanization. He clinches his argument by connecting Berlin's "May
your days be merry and bright" to "All merry, all happy and bright"
in Stephen Foster's "My Old Kentucky Home."</TE>
<TE>   Rosen is at his best when describing the prominent role that
enterprising, assimilating Jews played in creating 20th century
American popular culture and thereby 20th century America's image of
itself. Though this is hardly virgin territory -- Neal Gabler, for
instance, surveyed it in "An Empire of Their Own: How the Jews
Invented Hollywood" -- it remains touchy. Once I alluded in an
article to the "Jewish sensibility" of a later generation of American
songwriters: Neil Sedaka, Howard Greenfield, Carole King, Gerry
Goffin, Barry Mann, Cynthia Weil and others. Rosen notes that Jerry
Leiber and Mike Stoller, father figures and charter members of that
generation, wrote a letter to the editor dismissing my observation as
"hogwash" that made "about as much sense as implying that Irving
Berlin's Jewishness influenced his writing of 'White Christmas.' "</TE>
<TE>   Rosen makes it abundantly clear that Berlin's Jewishness
influenced his authorship of not only "White Christmas" but also
"Easter Parade" and "God Bless America." The Great American Songbook,
he argues, "is a soundtrack of assimilation: the musical record of a
marginalized people's conquest of the cultural mainstream." "Yankee
Doodle Yiddishkeit," he calls it. Pointing out that Sammy Cahn,
Harold Arlen, Yip Harburg and other songwriters were also cantors'
kids who mastered the popular idiom, Rosen draws an intriguing
parallel to Ray Charles, Sam Cooke, Aretha Franklin and other black
singers whose "soul music" crossed over from gospel to pop.</TE>
<TE>   "White Christmas" is a song about distance -- between California
and the East Coast, a palmy present and a Currier &amp; Ives past, Jew
and Gentile -- and the yearning to overcome it. So is "Amazing
Grace," though here the distance is between man -- a "wretch like me"
-- and God, a gulf that only grace can bridge. Such yearning, as well
as ambiguity, gives both songs legs. The ironies and duplicities of
their histories encourage us to see in these standards what we will
yet prevent us from exhausting their music and meaning.</TE>

<HD>The libretto of life, frame by frame</HD>
<DH>Cinema's Illusion, Opera's Allure: The Operatic Impulse in
Film, David Schroeder, Continuum: 372 pp., $35</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James McCourt</AU>
<BD>James McCourt is the author of numerous books,
including the novels "Mawrdew Czgowchwz," "Wayfaring at Waverly in
Silverlake" and the forthcoming "Queer Street: The Rise and Fall of
an American Culture, 1947-1985 -- Excursions in the Mind of the
Life."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Between the ages of 7 and 35 (childhood and adolescence), I spent a
lot of time in picture palaces and opera houses. Broken dreams were
my racket, love trouble my on-site forensic lab, and the ruling
passions of my life opera and motion pictures, twin hierogamous
monarchs of the coinciding arts scrutinized in "Cinema's Illusion,
Opera's Allure." The two seemed entwined indeed, and I came to
believe myself not merely the viewer-listener but truly one of their
marked offspring; I yearned (transgressively) to be with them in bed,
working all day-for-night like Marcel Proust (see Lauren Bacall
baiting Humphrey Bogart in "The Big Sleep"). Precocious, I understood
early that life was a question of strong music making a weak libretto
into a high melodrama of awe-filled recognition.</LD>
<LD>   Then I became metaphysical about both, to preserve them, for to my
dismay, they had begun the long irreversible slide into,
respectively, televised entertainment and architectonic spectacle by
which the really massive mass audiences engendered by the population
explosion and easy money were able to capture each. They traded in
the experience of being overwhelmed for the infinitely less
enervating one of working a little emotional and aesthetic karaoke.</LD>
<TE>   The essential value of metaphysics is consolation. Those decades
of great opera and great motion pictures, gone in real time, are all
still there in stolen moments, in film cans, on records, even in
lobby cards, and "Cinema's Illusions, Opera's Allure" is an
enormously engaging dialogue with that same long-gone still-here
time. Were there world enough and space enough, I would enter into a
long and spirited discussion with it and its author until the sun
came up over Mt. Helicon. It is that kind of book, and good for it
and David Schroeder both.</TE>
<TE>   It is only that the premise it argues, with so much exhaustively
researched detail and in such an exuberantly engaging riff-style, has
always struck me as a vivid notion trying without real success to
stretch itself into a big idea. That said, vivid notions can and
often do nourish the mind on its way to big ideas, not to mention the
fact that big ideas are sometimes carded as being categorically
insane. Consider the ruckus over Catherine Clement's "Opera: The
Undoing of Women," whose author has bounded into the realm of
critic-as-diva, or anti-diva, depending on one's aesthetic politics,
whereas vivid notions, even when underwhelming, do indeed pitch a
protective sanity the zealot too often abandons with dire results.
(All the same, what a world, what a world, where vivid notions
dissolve metaphysical ideas with the negligee aplomb of good little
girls from Kansas destroying beautiful wickedness.) In any case we
may all be barking up two curved sides of the same wrong tree, for
are we not being told with some finality that all lexical, aural,
imagistic, sung, spoken, danced and otherwise felt experience is to
be subsumed any minute now into hypertext?</TE>
<TE>   In the heightened reality of gesture that is cinema, gesture is
parceled into segments and reassembled. The master shot, the long and
medium shots, the two-shot, the close-up, diopter lenses, back
projections and matte work, the dialectical montage cut, the
mise-en-scene tracking shot, the invisible cut, all are pure cinema,
derived from silent mimesis, the architectonics of trompe l'oeil and
what we have come to call the dance. They bear no essential relation
to the heightened reality of speech (either soliloquial, rhetorical
or choral) in song that was Greek tragedy and became opera in the
last years of the Florentine Renaissance.</TE>
<TE>   Opera proceeds according to the rubric "prima la musica, dopo le
parole," first the music, then the words. The musica of film is not
the music enhancing the film but the regulated pulse of an equation
derived from either the mise-en-scene over the montage or vice versa,
and it is the product (and not the ratio) of the music and the script
that makes the talking picture.</TE>
<TE>   A complete operatic experience -- orchestra and singers going at
it in full throttle -- can be had absent any spectacle, while on the
obverse, a complete cinematic experience (of, say, D.W. Griffith's
staggering "Intolerance") can be had in a dead silent auditorium,
with no aural complement but the subway rumbling underneath.</TE>
<TE>   Concerning the application of actual operatic motifs to cinema
itself, together with the practice of tagging characters and
situations with signature tunes, are these really structural
essentials or rather erotic enhancements, the effect of which will
depend very much upon one's musical preferences rather than on one's
sympathetic eye? (I'm thinking of two particular high-concept uses of
the Wagnerian imprint in significant pictures: Jean Negulesco's
"Humoresque" in which Joan Crawford walks from her sumptuous Long
Island beach house into the Atlantic Ocean while on the radio John
Garfield renders the aforementioned "Liebestod" on the violin,
relayed from Carnegie Hall; and Samuel Fuller's counterpointing in
"Verboten" of the seven-note motif from Siegfried's Funeral March
with the opening four-note so-called "fate" motif of Beethoven's
Fifth Symphony.)</TE>
<TE>   And Fritz Lang's "Die Nibelungen" saga really has nothing at all
to do with Wagner or his ethos; it is a quite faithful translation to
the screen of the great medieval German epic, one source among many
Wagner appropriated. Nor do the Nibelungen represent mieskeit Jews;
they are clearly avatars of the medieval German grotesque in which
"lesser" human beings seem (like Rumpelstiltskin) to resemble
pictures seen in old gnarled trees, or lumps of earth half-fashioned
into men.</TE>
<TE>   And, as it were, on the rim of the coin, the dizziest
appropriation in all kitsch cinema, the transformation of motifs from
Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony into the love duet from the fake opera
"Tzaritza" in the Jeanette MacDonald-Nelson Eddy melodrama "Maytime"
(1937) is certainly the epitome of ... something else.</TE>
<TE>   Of film directors whose work in film and in opera has
cross-fertilized to produce masterful effects in each medium, Luchino
Visconti's "Traviata" for Maria Callas at La Scala comes readily to
mind, as do two of his screen masterpieces, "Senso" and "Ludwig," and
ought we not consider two European post-Visconti, post-Max Ophuls
mise-en-scene operatic-cinematic extravaganzas of the recent past:
Hans Jurgen Syberberg's "My Hitler" and "Parsifal"?</TE>
<TE>   As for opera itself realized as cinema, for me the masterpiece is
not Ingmar Bergman's beautiful "Magic Flute" starring the Royal
Theatre at Drottningholm, nor Joseph Losey's stately "Don Giovanni"
starring the Villa Rotunda, but Abel Gance's absolute-cinema
translation of Gustave Charpentier's "Louise," starring Georges Thill
and Grace Moore.</TE>
<TE>   Which calls to mind the fact that in reality the opera diva, as it
has for more than two centuries ahead of the movie star, can show her
cadet sister both how to act up (Grace Moore once threw Greta Garbo
out of her Connecticut weekend house party for obdurately refusing to
sign the guest book) and class up (Rosa Ponselle once gave serious
singing lessons to, yes, Joan Crawford).</TE>
<TE>   And if Mae West's parlor production of Camille Saint-Saens'
"Samson et Dalilah" in "Goin' to Town" is the most moving example of
the seraphic inane in all of cinemoperatics, then Dorothy Comingore's
appearance (faithfully chronicled here) singing Bernard Herrmann's
pastiche "Salammbo" in Orson Welles' "Citizen Kane" is surely the
most terrifying. It is, in fact, in this immortal sequence that the
transgressive hierogamy the adolescent aesthete so feverishly
imagined was shown him in ... reality?</TE>
<TE>   It is the chapter on "Vertigo" (in which Clement's book is
pointedly invoked) that readers will find the most persuasive
correlations between the two art forms. Schroeder is at his keenest
here, not least in pointing out Herrmann's debt to "Tristan und
Isolde" (although it should be noted that this great score is at
least as redolent of Schoenberg's "Verklarte Nacht"). The chapter is
reason enough for the book.</TE>

Translated from the German by Leslie Willson, Princeton University
Press: 582 pp., $35</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Frederic Morton</AU>
<BD>Frederic Morton is the author of "The Rothschilds: A
Family Portrait" and "A Nervous Splendor: Vienna, 1888-1889," both
National Book Award finalists.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A curious feature distinguished Thomas Mann's writing career: He
lived like a literary man. Many of his fellow icons in the 20th
century developed legends that tended to upstage their work: Marcel
Proust's cork-lined room, James Joyce's rebel exile or the public
virilities of Ernest Hemingway. By contrast, Mann's private life
seemed to be almost boringly bookish.</LD>
<LD>   "Buddenbrooks," published when he was 25, proved the precocity of
a lavish gift. By that time he had already moved from his native
Lubeck to Schwabing, Munich's Greenwich Village. But he was never a
young bohemian. No absinthe, no avant-garde pranks in bordellos. The
scion of a distinguished clan, he married in 1905, at 30, the heiress
of a cultural dynasty. It was a very proper, lifelong union that
produced six children. Decade after decade, Mann appeared to combine
harmoniously, diligently, serenely, the role of paterfamilias with
that of grandee of letters. He traveled en famille as he held his
lectures, signed his books and accepted -- with decorous humility --
his Nobel Prize and his honorary doctorates, his tributes and

<TE>   True, something a bit awry always stirred through the cuff-linked,
homburg-hatted texture of the Mann oeuvre; some fly buzzed in the
haute-bourgeois ointment. Some aesthetic abnormality would inflict on
burgher health an iridescent infection, much as an impurity in an
otherwise sound oyster produces the shimmer of a pearl. But only the
shimmer connected the pearls of Mann's fiction to the author himself,
not the flaw that produced it.</TE>
<TE>   This picture changed after Mann died in 1955. Many of his letters
were published, including the candid correspondence with his
author-brother Heinrich and an even more candid diary. And then a
rather different Thomas Mann emerged. When he wrote, his very soul
broke into a sweat during the daily travail from the top of the page
to the bottom. No matter how acclaimed the end product, the crucible
of creation often stressed him into exhaustion, dyspepsia,
self-doubt.</TE>
<TE>   In private he was bisexual, tentatively drawn to some women,
dangerously entranced by many youths. Everywhere, from the confusions
of his Lubeck adolescence to the Nobelist court he held in America,
to his final apotheosis after his return to Europe, some sweet peril
was whispering. Some seductive bane waylaid him -- a painter in
Munich, a California tennis player, a waiter in Zurich. Everywhere he
found himself in Venice, with death glimmering through the beauty of
a forbidden boy.</TE>
<TE>   Many Mann readers remained unaware of these revelations. His
biographers, at least those I'm familiar with, were largely content
to record them, with due astonishment. Hermann Kurzke's account in
"Thomas Mann: Life as a Work of Art" is different. Its centerpiece is
Mann's dark side, and for more than 500 pages, the book tracks the
labyrinthine ways in which that darkness nourished genius.</TE>
<TE>   Kurzke documents how Thomas' queasy envy of his heterosexual
brother tints his portrayal of Schiller's feelings about Goethe in
the story "A Harsh Hour." And how the pain of young Mann's yearnings
for the painter Paul Ehrenberg still pulses 40 years later through
the desire of one character (Ines Institoris) for another (Rudi
Schwerdtfeger) in "Doctor Faustus." And how the novel "Royal
Highness" brings on stage an epaulet-wearing autobiographical
disguise in the shape of Prince Klaus Heinrich, who conceals his
crippled arm, reflecting Mann's qualms about the hidden corruption of
the artists. And how in the "Joseph" tetralogy, the protagonist's two
wives, Rachel and Leah, enact the author's complex relationship with
his spouse Katja. And in the tetralogy again how the chaste Joseph
(rejecting Potiphar's wife) is the continent-though-tempted Thomas
Mann on the one hand and, on the other, " ... a handsome boy whom
Thomas Mann loves and whom, in telling his story, Mann keeps before
him for years, daily anew and with tender sympathy."</TE>
<TE>   Many such insights backlight the Mann canon with an acumen as
impressive as the scholarship buttressing it. This biography is a
feast for literary critics. The book, however, starves some
curiosities that it stimulates. I wish, for example, that Kurzke had
fleshed out the domestic theater of the Manns. How did this marriage
remain so miraculously functional? Mann's children are slighted.
There's little about the contradiction they were privy to: in public,
their father's august image; at home, certain idiosyncrasies, like
his erotic impulses, barely suppressed, toward his son Klaus. And the
book's subjective focus limits its treatment of Mann's interactions
with the world at large. I'd like to have learned more of the twists
and turns of Mann's metamorphosis from German nationalist in World
War I to fanatic foe of Adolf Hitler in World War II.</TE>
<TE>   This American edition of Kurzke's work also falls short on another
level. It bristles with omissions: no general index, no bibliography,
not even source indications. Often the context offers no clue whether
a quoted passage is from a letter, diary entry or autobiographical
publication, and Leslie Willson's translation from the German keeps
lapsing into a thick accent, aping the German sentence structure. The
translator misunderstands a number of idioms. "Politisieren," as used
by Kurzke, means to "discuss politics," not "to politicize";
"plastisch" means "vivid," not "plastic"; "blau-augig" means "naive,"
not "blue-eyed." The list is annoyingly long.</TE>
<TE>   But the book's chief lack derives from its great virtue. With
brilliantly erudite perspicacity, Kurzke opens before us the chasm
running through Mann's life; Mann felt that his artist's alienation,
his creative decadence were separated from the mainstream's wholesome
middle-class robustness. Why, then, did this same middle class laurel
him as its preeminent poet? Was it because Mann, in mining his flaw
for his art, expressed the pathology endemic to Western culture?
Kurzke has the equipment to engage the question. I wish he had done
so here.</TE>

<LD>Ice Cream, Helen Dunmore, Grove: 218 pp., $23</LD>
<LD>   No one captures the silence of winter quite like Helen Dunmore.
Her writing has the palette of winter, the suffocating, muffled
restraint of winter and the glorious detail of a winter landscape.
Readers of "Ice Cream," a collection of short stories about various
forms of human vanity, will feel as if they are taking a cure,
wrapped in blankets, watching a cook meet the pen pal she has lied to
for so long, or the model desperate for a taste of ice cream, or the
writer with the overbearing ego. There, the patient reader thinks
smugly to himself, but for the grace of literature go I.</LD>

<TE>   Earth and Ashes, Atiq Rahimi, Translated from the Dari by Erdag M.
Goknar, Harcourt: 96 pp., $19</TE>
<TE>   We sometimes talk about the power of photographs to bring the
reality of war back home. Rarely, we think, are words able to etch
images in our minds so indelibly. "Earth and Ashes," a novel written
by Atiq Rahimi, a young Afghan who was 17 when the Soviet Union
invaded Afghanistan (and now lives in Paris), is as painful and
unforgettable as a photograph.</TE>
<TE>   A grandfather, Dastaguir, and his young grandson, Yassin, are on
their way across northern Afghanistan to Kabul, where Dastaguir's son
and Yassin's father, Murad, work in the mines. Theirs is a grisly
mission: to inform Murad that their village has been wiped out in the
Soviet invasion. Murad's wife, sister, mother, uncles, aunts,
everyone has been killed. Yassin (perhaps 4 or 5) is left deaf by the
explosion of the bomb and asks his grandfather why the stones can't
speak anymore when he throws them, and why the Russians have stolen
everyone's voices. Dastaguir, who has not slept for a week, tries to
decide whether to tell Murad, whether this news will be like sticking
"a dagger in his heart." He knows that Murad, so like himself, will
seek revenge.</TE>
<TE>   Rahimi has written the book in the second person, so that you feel
the torment of the grandfather even more acutely. Woven throughout
are references to the 11th century Persian epic, "The Book of Kings."
It tells about the creation of the world and features three
characters who appear in "Earth and Ashes": Rostam, who kills in
battle the son he did not know about; Sohrab, his son; and Zohak, the
tyrant, who rules with serpents that feed off the brains of young
men. Who would you most like to be? Would you rather have blood on
your hands or on your throat?</TE>

<TE>   Tales From the Cuban Empire, Antonio Jose Ponte, Translated from
the Spanish by Cola Franzen, City Lights: 90 pp., $11.95</TE>
<TE>   "Tales From the Cuban Empire" is the Cuban "Arabian Nights," told
for our modern times. In this collection of stories, each told with a
wild mania, the narrators, like Scheherazade, are desperate to save
their lives by telling their story. There is the woman in the airport
bathroom who left her country to get away, not from just one man, but
all men. She tells her story to the bathroom attendant. There is the
apprentice in a butcher's shop in the Chinese Quarter, whose mentor
has taught him how to lead a knife through the spaces in the meat, so
as not to dull the blade. "No violence, no raising of eyebrows," he
repeatedly tells his student. There is the inhabitant of the
subterranean city, a student of urban planning, who learns the
virtues of vertical building in a city whose geographic limits have
been reached. "What your blood tells you every night is a mere mirage
of the open road. If the land comes to an end, unearth what's
underneath the construction. Excavate, walk on the vertical." There
is the tale told by a prison barber of escapees who swam to the court
of Queen Elizabeth II in England. And there is the story of the Congi
heads, a tribe of Cubans exiled in Russia whose members name
themselves after their national dish, congi, a mixture of black beans
and rice. Is the teller saved by the tale? Each story loops back upon
itself, arrives at an inconclusive end and should be read once more.</TE>

<LD>One Foot in Eden, Ron Rash, Novello Festival Press: 222 pp., $21.95</LD>
<LD>   Here's Billy Holcombe, hardscrabble tobacco farmer and luckless
fisherman, musing on the overwhelming predicament he's found himself
in: "I couldn't outsmart a fish with a brain the size of a butter
bean but here I was trying to out slick a sheriff who'd passed most
of his life catching people like me." The narrators who take turns
telling this dark tale of infertility, infidelity and murder in a
mountainous corner of South Carolina in the 1950s have their own
unique ways of talking. And, as much as they seem to be in denial
half the time, they can be, like Billy, downright startling in their
self-assessments.</LD>
<TE>   Ron Rash, the author of two story collections, gives these
characters -- Billy, his wife, their son, the sheriff and the deputy
-- enough twang to sucker us in. But he refuses to lay on the corn
pone as he deftly orchestrates this backwoods mystery about a family
up to its neck in trouble. The story itself is simple: The local
ne'er-do-well Holland Winchester turns up missing and his batty
mother insists that the innocuous Billy and Amy Holcombe have
something to do with it. But in revealing the tangled
interconnections between Billy, Amy and Holland, Rash gives us
something considerably more complex than an Appalachian whodunit.
Why, for instance, doesn't Billy seem particularly distressed by the
crime he's apparently committed? Why would Amy Holcombe choose such a
cruelly pragmatic method of dealing with her husband's sterility? And
who will even care once the whole valley gets flooded out by the big
dam that Carolina Power is putting up?</TE>
<TE>   There's a disturbing sense in these pages that evil can be
swallowed up by time or cleverness or disregard. But as the rising
water begins to filter across the tobacco and cabbage fields, Rash
ruefully suggests that past wrongs also have a disconcerting way of
floating to the surface. Equal parts vintage crime novel and Southern
Gothic, full of aching ambivalence and hard compromises, and rounded
off by bad faith and bad choices, "One Foot in Eden" is a veritable
garden of earthly disquiet.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cold Water, Gwendoline Riley, Carroll &amp; Graf: 166 pp., $20</TE>
<TE>   "Cold Water," a seductive novella about a 20-year-old barmaid
working in a Manchester dive, won the prestigious Betty Trask Award
when it was first published in England. It has the compelling
immediacy of a sketch dashed off in the trenches of late adolescence.
After all, its photogenic young author, Gwendoline Riley, is just a
whisper older than Carmel McKisco, her drink-slinging, mildly adrift
and wholly sympathetic heroine, and as slight as "Cold Water" is, its
unvarnished reportage gives the book a surprising heft and an
undeniable ring of authenticity. Compared to other baby writers who
should be cramming for their finals rather than vetting manuscripts
(and there's been a slew of them lately), Riley gives us a voice
that's authoritative, crafty and wry. There's maturity in it too, if
only because she's brave enough to let youth speak for itself. Carmel
is a kind of pixie Bukowski in Converse All-Stars, making her way
around suitably dire Manchester -- its rain-slicked streets, its used
bookstores, its sweaty rock clubs -- without much direction or
urgency. It's that perfectly respectable young-adult listlessness
that turns up in concerned editorials as "apathy." Between shifts at
the bar, Carmel tells us that her absentee parents are "pieces that
have been removed from the game board," that "when I go to the
pictures I always sit in the very middle of the first row" and that
"feelings can seem so fragile and unlikely, why not keep them strange
and beautiful instead of sharing them with anyone who'll listen[?]"</TE>
<TE>   Carmel, you suspect, is a modern romantic with exceedingly low
expectations and a very mellow lifestyle. She wonders about the
tortured singer she used to follow as a teenager, now wasting away
somewhere in a bed sit. She has a soul-stirring but inconclusive
fling with an American backpacker. She spends a lot of time with her
fellow barmaids. Yet for all the hanging out and hooking up, there's
little connection for Carmel, making "Cold Water" a classic cruel
story of youth. But Riley tells it with affection and mildness,
making this familiar tale -- of the sad yet enviably slack -- seem
brand new.</TE>

<HD>He has a bigger picture in mind</HD>
<DH>Edward Norton's heard the rap: He's difficult. Since when
does harmony help a film?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rachel Abramowitz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Edward Norton is eating a burrito. It seems more a pastime that would
have better suited Ed Norton, as he was known before he became
famous. Unlike some of his contemporaries, Edward does not use a
faux-familiar nickname like Tom, Brad, Matt or Ben; he's made it
clear that he's not the guy who would ever end up in a Tiger Beat
poster or deemed by People magazine the sexiest man alive.</LD>
<LD>   You can even hear the Hollywood cognoscenti struggle with the
all-too-human impulse to chuck the formality of his moniker and just
call him Ed. But one fears, sitting across from Norton, clothed in a
casual black shirt and jeans hanging off his frame, that such
familiarity might be taken as reductio ad absurdum, an unwanted
winnowing down of his persona. It's hard to imagine Edward Norton
deigning to share his name with a talking horse.</LD>
<TE>   Since he burst on the scene eight years ago with twin Oscar
nominations for his film debut "Primal Fear" and then for "American
History X," Norton, a onetime upper-middle-class kid from Columbia,
Md., has been posited in public-relations speak as the Gen-Y actor's
actor, the inheritor of the great acting mantle worn by such
luminaries as Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman. In person, the
33-year-old looks like an elongated choirboy, with a round face, weak
chin, watery blue eyes and a lean body that stretches out like Gumby.
It's an actor's face, perfect in its indistinct opaqueness and
malleable as putty.</TE>
<TE>   Hair dramatically changes his visage -- it can rise upward from
his scalp to give him fury, or flop around over his forehead to make
him seem weak or sniveling. With the addition of a goatee (like in
"American History X" or his current film, "25th Hour"), he can appear
menacing, and without, he easily dissolves into sweet harmlessness.</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, a tiny mustache lies across his upper lip like a
dead caterpillar, an unfortunate reminder of a part (the villain) he
didn't want in a movie ("The Italian Job") he didn't want to make but
was forced into making (at the point of a multimillion-dollar
lawsuit, but more about that later).</TE>
<TE>   Norton doesn't much relish interviews, but he's not cold. Caught
without a costume, the cerebral Ivy League graduate simply uses words
to veil himself. His voice is thin, but he talks and talks, amiably,
like a savvy and articulate politician. Still, much of what he says
drifts by in a haze of benign erudition, and that seems to be the
point.</TE>
<TE>   It's only in flashes that a more vital Norton pops out. One is the
secretly amused, adoring light that emanates from his face when he
talks about his longtime girlfriend, actress Salma Hayek (only in
context of course, discussing their film "Frida").</TE>
<TE>   The other is a kind of contentiousness -- mostly clamped down and
tightly disciplined -- that nonetheless flickers to life in the
discussion of such life-and-death issues as artistic integrity. One
senses that Norton enjoys debate and responds more respectfully when
not allowed to steamroll. He also appears to have a taste for
control. This is why acting, even at the level of being a movie star
who can command $9 million a picture, can be frustrating for a
would-be Renaissance man like Norton.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess there's part of me that's always resented it, if you're a
painter or a writer or a photographer, even if no one's buying it,
you can sit in your room and do it. But to be an actor, you have to
have someone else say yes to you," he says. "You're beholden. Someone
else is allowing you the opportunity, and that annoys me. Again,
there's this sort of built-in vulnerability and lack of autonomy in
terms of control of your own work as an actor. I always found that
aspect of it very difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the reason is that, when working, Norton does not merely
show up and recite his lines, but impresses himself body and soul on
the production. Euphemistically speaking, he's a man of a thousand
questions, approaching each role with his Yale-educated brain, ready
for a little deconstruction.</TE>
<TE>   He's also known to have wielded the pen himself on everything from
"American History X" to last year's caper film "The Score,"of which
he says, "I rewrote 'The Score' pretty totally." He also wrote the
shooting draft of "Frida," girlfriend Hayek's labor of love, although
he was denied credit in a Writers Guild arbitration. And of course,
there's the famous tale of how he spent two months in the editing
room of "American History X," which apparently improved the film but
led to very public distress on the part of neophyte director Tony
Kaye.</TE>
<TE>   None of it is the expected role of an actor, particularly a
relatively young one, but Norton thinks the customary terminology to
describe relations between talent and directors is basically ignorant
of the organic nature of the creative process. "I'm not being
defensive," he says, rising to the debate. "That's a received set of
criteria, about arbitrary assignations of what's an actor, what's a
director.... It doesn't mean anything. Some people do certain things
and some of them do others."</TE>
<TE>   Harmony on the set, he says, is way overrated. "People wrestle
sometimes making movies," he says with exasperation. "I think
conflict is a very essential thing. If the reasons everyone is
pushing each other have to do with a group desire to make things as
good as possible, that's a great thing! And I think a lot of very
happy productions have produced a lot of very banal movies."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the idea of an actor assuming alternate roles (such as
screenwriter) gives many in Hollywood pause, for the simple fact that
movie stars usually carry so much more power than writers, directors,
editors and most studio execs. The industry tends to view articulate,
opinionated actors with great wariness, but it does make allowances,
chiefly for box office clout and also for talent. As one Hollywood
player who knows him notes, "If he were stupid and difficult, that
would be one thing. But he's smart and talented and difficult, that's
another."</TE>
<TE>   Always asking questions</TE>
<TE>   Even his friends and admirers say Norton can be challenging.</TE>
<TE>   "I think any actor who is reasonably smart is going to want to
make sure the person who they're following into battle has done their
homework. Under most normal circumstances, that probing ends three to
four weeks into the making of the production. That's not true with
Edward. It continues through 4 in the morning on the last day of
shooting. 'But do you really think ... ?' " says David Fincher, who,
through a grueling multi-month shoot, guided Norton in an unnerving
performance in the controversial "Fight Club."</TE>
<TE>   "I appreciate that. It's nice to have a backboard, somebody to
ricochet ideas off," says Fincher, adding, "He's tough. He's cruel
but fair, as Monty Python once said."</TE>
<TE>   "Edward tended to intellectualize the material but not his
performance," says director Brett Ratner, who recently directed
Norton in the Hannibal Lecter film "Red Dragon." "He likes to
challenge the director. It's all about intellectual debate. His
questions are valid. It's not easy.... I think it did take some
manipulation on my part to get him to do what I wanted. I thought he
helped me make the film better."</TE>
<TE>   "Frida" director Julie Taymor says of Norton, "He brings a certain
kind of perfectionism, which has its place, but sometimes you can go,
'OK, OK, we can't do another take.' " Taymor was understandably wary
of Norton and Hayek's relationship when Norton first volunteered to
rework the final draft of the script, but was pleased with the
result. "Salma let her writer and director go off and do their work.
He did a wonderful draft and it's sad that it's not credited."</TE>
<TE>   To Norton, an actor assuming many hats shouldn't come as a
surprise. "I could reel off the actors who I think are extremely
involved in the work they do on levels other than acting and who
write and direct and produce: Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Tom Cruise.
You think Tom Cruise doesn't have a hand in every aspect of
everything that he does?" he says.</TE>
<TE>   The actor doesn't appear to take the set Sturm und Drang
personally. Despite their dust-ups during the week, Ratner says that
all during the Florida shoot, Norton would call him on weekends to
hang out. He fought with Fincher but reveres him,and cheerfully
admitted after the film that he hadn't understood exactly what the
director was doing.</TE>
<TE>   He chortles with disarming laughter when asked if he's arrogant.
"Arrogance is the assumption that you know best exclusively. It's
like 'Broadcast News' when the guy says to Holly Hunter, 'It must be
great to always be the smartest person,' and she says, 'No, it's
awful.' It's hilarious. I've never felt like that though," he says.
"You're lucky enough to get in the room with people like Fincher or
Milos [Forman], you know you're not the smartest person in the room.
It's great. I love those situations."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, it's more when Norton smells weakness that problems can
erupt. Ratner believes that the actor has something of a savior
complex, at least when it comes to movies. "If you're a weak
director, and you're intimidated by his power or presence, or the
fact that he's the star of the film, you're going to create damage
and make the actor think you have no opinion. Edward's instinct is
going to be, 'I have to take over this film.' He's going to try to
rescue the film. That's a blessing and a curse."</TE>
<TE>   The entrepreneur</TE>
<TE>   While some might grumble now at Norton's penchant for being more
than simply an actor for hire, it's that same entrepreneurial spirit
that catapulted him out of the life of the unemployed actor.</TE>
<TE>   His early mantra could have been to defy expectations. In his
first audition for "Primal Fear," he pretended he was from
Appalachia, a ruse made possible only through repeated viewing of
"Coal Miner's Daughter." When he tried out for "The People vs. Larry
Flynt," he went off-book to present his own version of his character,
the lawyer who argues Flynt's case before the Supreme Court, a kind
of moxie that appears to have impressed director Forman enough that
he invited the young upstart to join him for six weeks in polishing
the script.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always thought people limit themselves in auditions," says
Norton. "Maybe it was presumptuous but I never felt constrained
necessarily by the words that they had given me. I always felt I
should try to make this better because it's not Edward Albee. You
don't run across movie scripts very often that have been wordsmithed
in a way that you shouldn't mess with it. Like with 'Larry Flynt,'
that part of that lawyer, it was a drastically underwritten part."</TE>
<TE>   Norton doesn't want to talk about his personal life (which
includes a high-profile romance with Courtney Love), but that proviso
also seems to include distinctive details about his childhood, his
artistic influences and much of his life before fame. He claims that
any public knowledge about Norton as a person will impinge on his
effectiveness as a chameleon-like actor. The facts on the surface are
relatively straightforward: He's the oldest son of an environmental
lawyer and an English teacher, and the grandson of master developer
James Rouse, who created the nation's first shopping mall.</TE>
<TE>   He attended Yale, where he studied Japanese and history, rowed
heavyweight crew. He acted but didn't appear to have taken the
incestuous Yale drama community by storm. His college friend Stuart
Blumberg recalls that Norton played Mouse and he played Moonbeam in
one college production of "A Midsummer Night's Dream." "We were side
players, so we had an hour when we were not on stage. We'd go to
Naples [a local pizza parlor] and get drunk in the middle of the
show."</TE>
<TE>   Norton's goofy side isn't aired in public very often. He sang "I'm
Through With Love" to Drew Barrymore in the 1996 Woody Allen film
"Everyone Says I Love You" and played an innocent children's show
host in this year's little-seen black comedy "Death to Smoochy." He
was also allowed the lofty sum of $32 million to direct "Keeping the
Faith," a 2000 romantic comedy about a priest (Norton) and a rabbi
(Ben Stiller) who fall in love with the same woman.</TE>
<TE>   Norton sounds vaguely embarrassed that he made his directorial
debut with fluff. He says, however, that he needed to try directing,
"to satisfy the part of myself that wanted to have more total
creative control over the telling of a story. It helped me relax, in
a way. I think probably since doing that, I am more conscious of,
beyond just [an actor's] hard work, what a director needs in terms of
your moral support." The film is also dedicated to his late mother,
who died of a brain tumor in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   No coming to Lee's rescue</TE>
<TE>   One film that Norton didn't think needed rescuing was "25th Hour,"
Spike Lee's moody tale about the last day in Monty Brogan's life
before he goes to prison to serve a seven-year sentence for dealing
drugs. As played by Norton, he's a callow but surprisingly
sympathetic white-collar pusher, a charismatic screw-up just
discovering the bitter taste of shame.</TE>
<TE>   Lee is one of those directors Norton admires, calling him the "the
most underappreciated great American filmmaker." Norton cut his
salary to a reported $500,000 to make the $15-million film a reality.
Lee, in turn, took Norton's searching style with equanimity. There
was a two-week rehearsal period for Norton to get it all out of his
system, and after that, the 37-day shooting schedule didn't leave a
lot of time for hyper-analysis. "I understand the questions are
coming from a good place," Lee says. "He's trying to make anything he
does the best it can be."</TE>
<TE>   The film, which opened Dec. 19, has polarized viewers and critics.
Some found it trite and unconvincing, while others said it was
profound, a wrenching look at a man who's just coming to grips with
the reality of his wasted life, intertwined with a homage to a city
wracked by the devastation of Sept. 11. Although Norton chafes at
this interpretation, it's also the latest in a growing series of
films by Norton that deal with what it means to be a young man in
America at the turn of the century. The oeuvre, which also consists
of "American History X" and "Fight Club," is not pretty, filled with
misguided men struggling with consumerist culture, seduced by false
idols, fueled by rage and testosterone, often blinded by their own
self-importance, and running headlong into the ramifications of their
actions. It's untethered masculinity casting about desperately for
meaning and connection.</TE>
<TE>   He takes pride in the careful selection of every movie he's made,
shunning most mindless commercial fare, in an attempt perhaps to live
up to his advance billing as a great American actor. This is why the
situation with "The Italian Job" is so painful.</TE>
<TE>   Norton fairly quivers with indignation when asked about it. He
fastens his gaze on the listener and, clearly enunciating every word,
says: "My contract with Paramount explicitly forbids me from
discussing the film or the nature of my employment without their
permission and they have very definitively not given me permission to
discuss it."</TE>
<TE>   The fracas dates to "Primal Fear," when Paramount, in return for
casting the unknown, extracted from Norton options for several more
films at modest rates. It's a common studio practice, and, according
to several with knowledge of the deal, Norton's contract initially
called for several options in the $100,000 range, but was later
renegotiated for one option at $1 million, now almost 90% off his
movie-star rate.</TE>
<TE>   In the intervening eight years, the two sides haggled about what
the film should be until, finally, this year, the studio demanded he
star in "The Italian Job," a remake of the Michael Caine heist film
starring Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron. The studio threatened to
file a multimillion-dollar lawsuit if he balked.</TE>
<TE>   Paramount Vice Chairman Robert Friedman says, "We've been trying
to work it out, and it was getting to the point where legally we had
reasons we needed to exercise the option."</TE>
<TE>   For Paramount, the deal has worked out fine. The studio cut $8
million out of the budget and, says Friedman, "Norton's acted very
professionally. We're thrilled with him." Of course, there's an
alternate explanation to describe an Edward Norton who simply shows
up and goes through the paces, no questions asked. This is the Edward
Norton who doesn't care.</TE>
<TE>   This is probably Norton's bigger point -- at least about himself.
He has spent the last several hours determinedly trying to stay two
steps ahead of the interviewer, a process occasionally foiled by his
natural loquaciousness. "Some people have sort of tried the difficult
angle, but I don't think that's it because I'm too fundamentally
enthusiastic about the whole enterprise," he says finally.</TE>
<TE>   To Norton, being difficult is performing like a jaded
paycheck-grubbing automoton. Contorting his sentence to make a point,
he says,</TE>
<TE>   "To me, being difficult is not being enthusiastic, and talking
about it and trying to improve the performance."</TE>

<HD>An immigrant tale that scratches off history's veneer</HD>
<DH>Flawed, yes, but 'Gangs' breaks new ground with its
gloves-off portrayal of a pivotal era.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Baker</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Martin Scorsese's "Gangs of New York" begins in the bowels of the
Earth, which is appropriate, because he is digging deep -- perhaps
deeper than any filmmaker has ever done before -- into the American
past.</LD>
<LD>   As the movie opens, the Dead Rabbits, a legendary Irish street
gang in pre-Civil War New York, is preparing for battle against their
"Native American" (i.e., Anglo) rivals. Down in the cellars of the
Old Brewery, the Rabbits sharpen blades, sharpen teeth, pick up crude
clubs. As the U2 soundtrack swells, they march upstairs, kick open a
door -- and emerge suddenly onto a gorgeously stark, snow-covered
Paradise Square, smack in the middle of the Five Points and, what is
more, America.</LD>
<LD>   The scene is thrilling. Before us on the screen is a forgotten
people, marching literally up from the depths of history. The Old
Brewery was just that, a vast, abandoned beer brewery that became a
slum unto itself, but in Scorsese's depiction, its basement bears a
more-than-passing resemblance to the Roman catacombs. His Irish
immigrants go up to battle with both a Gaelic cross and a pagan
amulet, a brace of dead hares, swinging from a stick before them.
They are even led by a "priest," the fictional gang leader "Priest"
Vallon (Liam Neeson), who wears a protective, clerical-looking
leather collar around his throat.</LD>
<TE>   Surely no filmmaker has issued such a brazen challenge to the
verities of American history, or to the history of its cinema. It is
more than coincidence, surely, that Scorsese's immigrant troika --
the priest, the cross-bearer, the man carrying his obscene gang
standard -- replaces here the old Yankee Doodle Dandy flag bearer and
fife-and-drum icon that goes back to the Revolution. The "Gangs"
advertising tagline is "America was born in the streets," and we are
made immediately to understand that Scorsese means it, that by his
lights the real America, the one we know today, did not really exist
before immigrants fought their way in.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, these opening moments are the best part of the film.
They are so powerful that they all but overwhelm the rest of the
movie, because they are all we really need to see. Scorsese does
provide another resonant, matching shot much later, when Leonardo
DiCaprio, playing Vallon's son, returns from disgrace and near death
to nail a dead rabbit back up in Paradise Square. In this
resurrection, he walks out through Bandits' Roost, a notorious
alleyway near the Five Points that was immortalized by the great
photographer-reformer Jacob Riis in his book "How the Other Half
Lives."</TE>
<TE>   Riis took two photos of the Roost. In the most famous one, which
now adorns the cover of the latest printing of Herbert Asbury's book
"The Gangs of New York," it looks like the very wellspring of urban
dread. Idle men lounge along the alley walls and stare menacingly
into the camera; one is carrying what looks like a club, or even a
shotgun. In the other less well-known picture, the alleyway is
transformed. There is a religious festival going on, the Feast of St.
Rocco, and a poignant, homey altar, blazing with candles, has been
erected at the back of the Roost.</TE>
<TE>   This is, in short, the yin and yang of the immigrant experience,
and Scorsese makes the most of it by having DiCaprio's character come
out of the alley, walking toward where Riis' camera would have been.
We are, for the first time, seeing this world from the immigrant's
point of view.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know if a comparable shot exists in all of American
cinema. What's more -- as Scorsese, the formidable film scholar, was
undoubtedly aware -- the pictures of Bandits' Roost also served as
inspiration for D.W. Griffith's groundbreaking 1912 two-reeler "The
Musketeers of Pig Alley," the very first gangster film. Scorsese, in
other words, is taking on not only the received history of America,
but also how that history has been depicted, directly challenging the
ghost of Griffith -- the earlier, false claimant of a "new birth" for
America.</TE>
<TE>   As both scenes indicate, "Gangs of New York" is a tremendously
ambitious film. It has even been said that -- in the age of digital
-- this may be the last, true movie epic. Certainly, Scorsese's
decision to shoot the film at Rome's Cinecitta Studios has paid off.
The look of the movie is fantastic, almost hyper-realistic. The crude
wooden buildings drive home the point that much of antebellum New
York was itself little more than a frontier town, raw and violent,
and open for the taking.</TE>
<TE>   Scorsese loads his film as well with telling historical details.
Here are bucket-shop bars that serve beer and whiskey sucked through
a rubber hose, straight from the barrel. Here is a genuine
rat-baiting -- a sport that entailed betting on how many rats a
trained terrier could kill -- and there is a legendary, gangland
bouncer known as "Hellcat Maggie," who supposedly bit off men's ears
with her well-honed teeth and kept them in a jar by the bar. Here is
a volunteer fire company that breaks up a draft office roundup by the
U.S. Army, and sets off the worst riot in American history.</TE>
<TE>   But what is so significant about Scorsese's film is not that it
may or may not be the last movie epic, but that it is the first -- at
least the first to be made about this other, secret history of
America. Think about it. For all that we relentlessly celebrate the
immigrant experience, for all that we pay lip service to our
multicultural roots, when was the last time you saw a serious film
about urban, immigrant life in the 19th century? An America this
poor, this tempestuous and rebellious and unformed has been depicted
only in our most nightmarish, post-apocalyptic fantasies -- whose
costumes and gang loyalties "Gangs" also evokes.</TE>
<TE>   Of fact and fiction</TE>
<TE>   To many viewers, the squalor and the violence of "Gangs" will be
stunning, even shocking. Others will debate the accuracy of the film,
but here the best dictum is from "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance":
"When the legend becomes fact, print the legend."</TE>
<TE>   Asbury's book is a secret history unto itself, a lurid, colorful
collection of gangland anecdotes that has been around since 1928,
fascinating even the likes of Jorge Luis Borges with what he termed
its "barbarian cosmologies." Certainly the realities of that old
America are as astonishing as anything Asbury could make up.</TE>
<TE>   But Scorsese is unable to impose a strong story on the book. The
plot of his adaptation is a simple revenge tale, and its
one-dimensional characters repeatedly stand up to make stilted, often
incoherent speeches about America. The artist seems overwhelmed by
his love of ritual, the same devotion to ceremony and myth that has
served him so well in films from "Mean Streets" to "The Age of
Innocence."</TE>
<TE>   The old New York demimonde was both more and less lawless than
what Scorsese has depicted, but what's worse is how he has distorted
crucial power relationships. The Irish did not wait around for
DiCaprio or any other king to return to them; the whole basis of
their victory in the new world was collective action, through the
political machines that let them take over entire urban governments.
New York's politicos controlled the gangs -- not the other way around
-- and the police were something of a gang unto themselves, who
single-handedly held the city in the Union during the Civil War draft
riot.</TE>
<TE>   The draft riot is "Gangs' " big finish, but it looks and feels
like something crudely tacked on. The whole rest of the film has
revolved around the confrontation between the Irish and the Nativist
"Know-Nothing" anti-immigrant gangs, battling for the soul of America
in the most elemental manner in the streets. The riot, by contrast,
was more of a class rebellion that turned into a racist massacre,
with the Irish both leading the lynching of numerous African
Americans and -- in the police and the military units that were
hurried back to the city -- ultimately crushing the revolt.</TE>
<TE>   Scorsese, to his credit, shows a quick scene or two of the attacks
on New York's black residents, but these are too fleeting to truly
register. Before this, moreover, the one, minor black character in
the whole movie has been a Dead Rabbit whose whole purpose seems to
be to signal who the good white guys are -- something that has become
the worst sort of Hollywood cliche.</TE>
<TE>   But it would be all but impossible to sort out the full power
relationships in any film about this dense, immensely complicated
period (which is why, as any of us novelists will tell you, books are
such a superior medium). Scorsese's work becomes a triumph simply by
ripping away the veil of our conventional history and replacing it
with the brawling, bleeding, yearning America that was really our
national past.</TE>
<TE>   He makes the critical connections throughout the movie, both
cinematic and historical, and it is not only that his flimsy wooden
houses tie us to the cow towns and the frontier. Daniel Day-Lewis's
Nativist gang leader speaks in an accent and patois redolent of both
mid-20th century New York and modern movie gangsters -- something
that is altogether appropriate, since our modern mob is descended
directly from the street gangs portrayed here.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the movie there is an eerie shot of the World Trade
Center towers, filmed before Sept. 11, and an even more evocative and
premonitory shot during the draft riot when, after a catastrophic
bombardment, the DiCaprio and Day-Lewis characters stumble blindly
about in an enormous cloud of dust -- the end of their world, at
least, upon them.</TE>
<TE>   "No one will ever even knew we were here," one of them eulogizes
sadly. They will now.</TE>

references to her Puerto Rican background in the film. What's so
bewildering? Jennifer has always made it loud and clear she's a
Boricua from the Bronx, and she happens to include it in her latest
film. Dreisinger asks, "Doesn't all this make J. Lo the poster gal
for Puerto Rican America?" Maybe.</LD>
<LD>   I commend Dreisinger's recounting the talents of Rita Hayworth; so
then why does it seem like an insult when she calls Hayworth and J.
Lo "chameleons"? That's what all good actors are, and what they get
paid to do. And, yes, sometimes J. Lo uses tanning cream and "urban
clothing," and "pulls off European designers with the best of them."
Why is this an issue when it comes to J. Lo? Many actors can act and
look "ghetto" one minute and in the next look very "European." She
further states, "If 'Latin-ness' can be taken on and off, sported for
one film or video shoot and then discarded for another, then how
absolute can it be?" I don't know, Baz, you tell me! As a Latina, I
am sure you can enlighten me (no pun intended).</LD>

<LD>Regarding Robert Hilburn's prognostications for the future ("Rock's
Bright New Day," Dec. 22), what ever happened to Badly Drawn Boy?
Damon Gough delivered not one but two great albums in 2002. The
first, "About A Boy," was a bold step for the relatively unknown
British songwriter (my choice for movie soundtrack of the year). The
second, "Have You Fed The Fish?," is a thoughtful, personal, melodic
and intelligent statement. How many others on Hilburn's list can lay
claim to that quality output?</LD>
<LD>   And gee, two years ago I discovered Badly Drawn Boy because of a
great interview conducted by one Robert Hilburn. How easily one
forgets, huh Bob?</LD>

<LD>Baz Dreisinger's amusing and caustic article obscures how the
cultural codes and semiotics of racial and ethnic representation are
nested in historical and contemporary race relations. Shifting the
charge of ethnic authenticity onto the narrow shoulders of J. Lo. is
not acceptable. Although the artist is implicated to some degree in
the "ethnic sleight-of-hand" that Dreisinger highlights, the onus of
its form and function is a product of the film industry rather than
individual Machiavellian chutzpah. Dreisinger not merely misses the
boat, she gets lost on her way to the dock.</LD>
<LD>   The racial dynamics she alludes to involve ranking Lopez's past
and current beaus of the moment on an arbitrary pigmentation scale to
measure her racial-ethnic authenticity. Adopting that type of logic
invites the absurd. For example, if Samuel L. Jackson divorces his
black wife and remarries a white woman at the same time he takes a
part playing a West Indian immigrant, does that make him less black,
"Cablanasian" or worse, a sellout?</LD>
<LD>   The dream factory's cookie-cutter compulsion to churn out racially
bland widgets for audience consumption is the true homogenizing
culprit, not Lopez's culpability in playing by the rules of racial
engagement that run the Hollywood marketing machine. To borrow from
the hip-hop parlance of the day: Don't hate the player, hate the
game.</LD>

<TE>   The subject of Latino racial identity fascinates me. Latinos who
are predominantly white don't hesitate to call themselves white.
Check out the self-descriptions on the love-line pages in
Spanish-language newspapers. We Anglos understand that many "white"
people are actually tan or even brown in color, such as Greeks,
Italians, Armenians, etc. But for some strange reason, we don't
assign the same racial status to Spanish people. Spain is in Europe.
Europeans are white. If somebody is born in Latin America, of mixed
Spanish and Indian blood, they can still be considered white, just as
such white Americans as Burt Reynolds or Johnny Bench are considered
white, although they proudly proclaim their Indian heritage.</TE>
<TE>   But in America, as the author of the article undoubtedly is aware,
a visible sign of African racial background is treated differently.
In America, if you are visibly part black, you are black. Even if
your name is Garcia instead of Jones or Smith. That is our racial
caste system, as of the year 2002. We shall see what the future
brings.</TE>

<LD>The film industry has fallen victim to the dumbing-down of America,
especially when it comes to noise. When did movie theater managers
decide to turn the volume up so high that people, even children, are
forced to cover their ears? Many savvy moviegoers have taken to
wearing ear plugs.</LD>
<LD>   Soundtracks today are offensive in volume. The music scores tend
to be constant and intrusive rather than supportive, repeating the
same brief theme countless times, so that anyone with a musical sense
is annoyed.</LD>
<LD>   Audiences over 50 are being treated as though they simply don't
matter. Not only in quality of films (how many explosions can one
story support?), but with the noise factor. A recent film, "About
Schmidt," told the story of a 66-year-old man in search of the
meaning of life. Obviously, the film was aimed at the "geezer
market." Yet, in a Santa Monica theater, the gray-haired audience was
subjected to high-volume rap music over advertisements before the
trailers began.With common sense, and respect for seniors, theater
owners and filmmakers would do much better. This is the fastest
growing segment of the population and could become the fastest
growing target demographic movie audience.</LD>

<LD>I am writing in response to Nicolai Ouroussoff's characterization of
the board of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art as "gutless" ("The
One That Got Away," Dec. 22). It seems to me that the board members
have come to their senses. The idea of purposefully destroying almost
all of the buildings of the museum so soon after the destruction of
the World Trade Center was grossly insensitive. The timing was
terrible. In addition, what major donor would be interested in
contributing to the new building knowing that it too will be torn
down when it no longer fits the latest architectural fad?</LD>

<HD>The joy of trying to figure out a film</HD>
<DH>For one viewer, 'Adaptation' offers a rare chance to engage
the audience's imagination.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Nichols</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the audience, we like to be involved, to work a little. It is
called using your imagination, and in the theater and movies, it's a
lot of fun. In "Our Town," the fact that two ladders and a bare stage
represent the town of Grovers Corners, and ultimately the whole
universe, is an exciting part of the experience of the play.</LD>
<LD>   The audience is a muscle; use it or lose it.</LD>
<LD>   You have to go back quite a long time to find a film that involves
the audience in a series of puzzles as compelling as those in
"Adaptation." (Which of the events is fact, which fiction? Does
Charlie Kaufman have a twin brother? Is the twin really dead? And so
on.) I thought hard about when viewers last had so integral a role in
a film and came up with "Lawrence of Arabia" -- partly because
censorship then precluded open and clear references to Lawrence's
sexuality and thus we had to do some figuring that pulled us into the
proceedings.</LD>
<TE>   Then there was "2001," where so much of the story was told in
images instead of words that understanding it took time and
consultation with those also in love with this great film.</TE>
<TE>   And now, 35 years later, we're talking about "Adaptation."</TE>
<TE>   Adaptation, the word, has an ever-growing number of meanings in
this movie. The first, of course, refers to the adaptation of a book
about orchids as a screenplay. There's the Darwinian adaptation of
flora like orchids, and fauna like us, to an ever-changing
environment. But the meaning that's most interesting to me is the one
that refers to the way in which we in the movie business need to
adapt to the tides of change in films. The Charlie Kaufman character,
a professional screenwriter, is stunned to discover that his brother,
who has never written anything more than a postcard, can come up with
a screenplay that excites the studio far more than his own. Meryl
Streep portrays a "real" character who's caught up in a writer's
imagination (Charlie Kaufman's first, then Donald Kaufman's), and
winds up trying out sex, drugs, car chases and shootings. The
character gets drawn and redrawn by both Kaufman brothers until --
adaptation at work -- she's in the middle of the
drugs-chases-shootings business.</TE>
<TE>   Movies have changed, the screenwriter(s) seem to say. You take the
jobs that are offered, you do the best you can. This is expressed
with engaging brilliance and humor.</TE>
<TE>   We get to see jokes and meanings unfold continually as the story
develops, and as we take it home and examine the pieces, turning them
this way and that. My family, friends and I got into arguments about
the movie, its meaning, its ending: "Is all that violence really
necessary?" "But that's the point, it's the joke!"</TE>
<TE>   We don't need it to be simple. The joy is in figuring it out.</TE>
<TE>   Movies are a very young art form, 107 years old to be precise.
Since the Lumiere brothers invented them in 1895, they have developed
with astonishing rapidity. Some of us have seen movies change from
the time of "Casablanca," when movies concerned themselves with other
parts of the world, to the present, in which we are involved with
ourselves, but dream of other planets and their denizens.</TE>
<TE>   "Adaptation," like "Being John Malkovich," moves the evolution (or
is it adaptation?) of movies along. This is a pleasure for those of
us who are used to seeing progress and greatness in things that take
hard work to understand and appreciate. Nobody ever enjoyed reading
"Ulysses," I don't care what they say. And, although I risk my life
here, there aren't a lot of laughs in "Citizen Kane."</TE>
<TE>   "Adaptation," I believe, is that rare thing: something brand new
that is a hell of a lot of fun.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Director Mike Nichols' films include "The Graduate" and "The
Birdcage."</TE>

the most precious thing. Because you have occupied my entire heart."</LD>

<TE>   The plot: Boy (Sang-Hyuk) loves girl (Yu-Jin). But girl falls for
a mysterious new boy (Joon-Sang) who transfers into her high school
-- on a secret quest to find his biological father. Just as Yu-Jin
and Joon-Sang's love begins to blossom, Joon-Sang is killed in a
truck accident. Or is he? And that's just Episode 3. Various
wrenching conflicts in this 10-year love triangle include that boy
and girl are actually brother and sister, or that boy and boy are
brothers. Yes, there's an amnesia plot line.</TE>
<TE>   The atmosphere: Snow falling over white hills. Sentimental piano
music.</TE>
<TE>   The back story: "Winter Sonata," now out on DVD, is Part 2 in a
quartet of k-dramas airing on the Korean Broadcast System. Korean
dramas, with their heart-rending love-hate plots and classic tales of
convoluted relationships, are setting ratings records all over Asia,
fueling a growing fervor for all things "kim-chic." The "Sonata"
cycle began in 2001 with "Autumn Story" and is KBS' highest-rated
drama. Although the race to cast the next tear-jerker is on, the lead
male heartthrob is set to be drafted into the real-life Korean army.

<KH>BRIEF ENCOUNTER</KH>
<HD>As years float by</HD>
<DH>A TV veteran casts his eye over half a century of Rose
Parade broadcasts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN CONWAY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For more than half a century, KTLA-TV broadcaster Stan Chambers has
covered the Rose Parade in Pasadena. Missing only a few parades since
1949, Chambers, who's 79, has risen before dawn on New Year's Day,
yanked on a pair of long johns, swaddled himself in woolly outerwear
and set out to tell viewers about some of the world's most
extravagant floral displays.</LD>
<LD>   As he prepared to do it for the 49th time, he reflected on parades
gone by.</LD>
<LD>   The parade has evolved quite a lot in the years you've been
describing it. What do you recall about covering the Tournament of
Roses in the early years?</LD>
<TE>   The fun part is when you think back to 1949 and remember there was
no transcontinental cable; everything was local. It was strictly for
the Pasadena-L.A. area then. And people watched TV because it was TV;
they didn't expect anything more than a picture. So, to have the Rose
Parade with all those floats appear was just something people
couldn't believe. In those days, it was new, informal and exciting.
Nobody knew what would happen next.</TE>
<TE>   There's plenty of opportunity for gaffes on live TV. Any
uncomfortable moments over the years?</TE>
<TE>   The most awkward and potentially the most embarrassing moment came
in those early years when I was interviewing people in the
distinguished visitors' section and, all of a sudden, someone walked
up to me who I didn't know. The second before I began to talk I
realized it was Gen. Omar Bradley. In TV you have to be lucky.</TE>
<TE>   Is there a moment that stays with you?</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, when a B2 bomber did a parade flyover in a salute
to our armed forces. Here was this huge plane that is so silent you
don't even hear it till it goes past and explodes in a roar. At that
moment, it became a symbol of America -- our power, our strength, our
future. It was so moving, emotional.</TE>
<TE>   Have you ridden on a float?</TE>
<TE>   Yes, and it was a big thrill. I played a TV reporter on a float
that was saluting television. When you are on television, you forget
the number of people at home that you talk to every day. The big
thrill of going down Colorado Boulevard was seeing thousands of
people waving and cheering. And then, as we continued, there were
thousands more.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back at all the times and ways you've covered the parade,
what says the most about the changes you've seen in television during
your career?</TE>
<TE>   That year long ago when our station manager decided we would cover
the two-hour parade twice. When we finished covering the parade at
its starting point, we followed motorcycle escorts to catch up and
did it all over again. Imagine it: There was no videotape. If you
were going to be live, you were going to be live.</TE>

<HD>Out with the old</HD>
<DH>In L.A., there's more 'erase-atecture' than preservation.
Are we a tear-down town?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Snakes shed scales. Roses drop petals. And Los Angeles levels
buildings -- about three per day.</LD>
<LD>   Taken together, a year's worth of demolition permits amount to a
new sort of ghost town, one whose structures once were scattered over
the city's 465 square miles. It's an upscale ghost town, dominated by
more than 135 Westside homes, many scraped away to make room for
houses even larger.</LD>
<LD>   The rest of phantom L.A., as gleaned in a Times study of 2001's
1,211 demolition permits, includes sites as familiar as the Gilmore
Bank -- the '50s Modernist structure at the Farmers Market complex,
leveled to make room for the Grove shopping mall -- and as obscure as
the Shell station at South La Brea Avenue and Rodeo Road, which is
now a bare-scraped lot.</LD>
<TE>   This "erase-atecture," as some architectural historians call it,
gives builders room to press forward with their perpetual reinvention
of the city, and it often protects the public from unsafe structures.
But nobody knows just how much valuable history the wrecking balls
obliterate each year, because in most cases, nobody's keeping track.</TE>
<TE>   About 85% of the city's standing structures have never been
surveyed for historic or cultural significance, a study by the Getty
Conservation Institute found in late 2001. Experts say this appears
to put Los Angeles substantially behind such cities as Chicago (which
completed a survey of its pre-1940 properties in 1995), Seattle
(which in 2001 began a six-year building inventory project) and New
York (where officials have stopped short of a citywide survey, but
have logged a list of landmarks and historic districts that includes
22,000 properties, roughly 3% of the city's total). By those and
other measures, authorities in and outside Southern California say,
official Los Angeles lags behind most major U.S. cities in attending
to its architectural history.</TE>
<TE>   "You hate to wake up to the sound of chainsaws or bulldozers,"
says Dwayne Howard, who failed earlier this year in his efforts to
block partial demolition of a Mar Vista home designed by modernist
Gregory Ain. Although Howard's efforts may lead to designation of a
tract of Ain-designed homes as a historic zone, much of the
threatened house was torn down in May.</TE>
<TE>   The city's leaders "have a responsibility that they're not living
up to," says Alan Leib, volunteer chairman of the Los Angeles
Conservancy's modern committee.</TE>
<TE>   For 40 years, city officials have been building a list of historic
monuments, but without any particular methodology. Typically, a
property goes unnoticed unless a resident nominates it, and those
nominations, usually a dozen or two a year, frequently materialize as
last-ditch acts of desperation when demolitions are threatened.</TE>
<TE>   "I dare say that Los Angeles has never chosen to take itself
seriously," said Timothy P. Whelan, director of the Getty
Conservation Institute, which is trying to build support for a
citywide survey.</TE>
<TE>   But among homeowners and entrepreneurs who are wary of creeping
government restrictions, the word "historic" alone can start a
debate.</TE>
<TE>   "In the abstract, I don't have any problem at all with surveys,"
says attorney Tom Larmore, who is part of a Santa Monica homeowners'
revolt against that city's historic-designation process. "I think
inventory is an important part of any system. But the city should not
be in a position of mandating that your house be historic. It's just
a fundamental impairment of individual freedom. In the process of
trying to preserve some old building so you can drive by it once a
year and say, 'That's nice,' you're really impinging on somebody."</TE>
<TE>   If that movement's signature-gathering campaign succeeds, says
Larmore, Santa Monica's voters may in 2003 or 2004 face a ballot
measure that would essentially give single-family homeowners veto
rights over any historic designation.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, meanwhile, the scales are weighted differently.
Demolition applications get less scrutiny, and repeated efforts to
take better measure of the city's architectural history have
collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know what we have in this city," says Ken Bernstein, the
Los Angeles Conservancy's director of preservation issues. In 2001,
he said, his organization lobbied to save about three dozen imperiled
addresses, usually alerted at the 11th hour by protests from
neighbors. Some of those buildings have been preserved and given
historic monument status, like the Chateau Colline apartment building
in Westwood. Others, like the Gilmore Bank, were leveled anyway when
city officials were unable or unwilling to intervene.</TE>
<TE>   Among the demolition targets that nobody told the conservancy
about, the roll call runs from sacred to profane: in the 5900 block
of South Main Street, a church dating to 1929. In the 2500 block of
North Soto Street, a 1940 dance hall. On West 4th Street in San
Pedro, a 1932 mortuary. On North Telfair Avenue in Pacoima, a chicken
coop from 1938. On Newcastle Avenue in Northridge, a bomb shelter
from the early Cold War days of 1956.</TE>
<TE>   To review last year's demolitions in Los Angeles, The Times used
computer software to link city and county records, then analyzed the
age, type and location of buildings targeted for destruction. Of all
permits, roughly one in four were for garages or carports only.
Residential buildings outnumbered commercial structures by a wide
margin. Among the findings:</TE>
<TE>   The city's wealthiest neighborhoods, largely overlooked by
architectural surveys, do the most demolition.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Palisades, where census figures show the median household
income is nearly three times that of the rest of the city, had more
teardowns authorized than any other ZIP Code area in the city: 54,
including 41 homes, most of them built between 1940 and 1952.
Brentwood, with incomes about twice the city average, ran second,
with 50 demo permits issued, 36 of them for houses, most from the
1940s.</TE>
<TE>   Neither area has ever had a city historic survey -- an alarming
oversight, says preservation expert and Getty researcher Kathryn
Welch Howe, because "those are areas of great architectural
significance, since there has been affluence throughout time in those
neighborhoods."</TE>
<TE>   Other areas never surveyed by the city, despite a history of
notable residential architecture, include Bel-Air, most of the
Hollywood Hills and Silver Lake, home to many of the 36 Case Study
homes, built from 1945 to 1962, that architects prize as forerunners
of the modernist movement. Any assessment of those neighborhoods,
said architectural historian Richard Starzack of Myra L. Frank &amp;
Associates, "is going to have some pretty important architects
represented."</TE>
<TE>   But in such neighborhoods, even a big-name architect's work may
not withstand homeowners' big ideas. In 1998, technology mogul Gary
Winnick bought a 12,000-square-foot home designed in the 1960s by
celebrated architect Paul Williams for Ronald Reagan confidant Henry
Salvatori, then leveled it. After the razing, Winnick lost interest
in the 4-acre property and traded it to developer David Murdock, who
turned around and sold it again a year later for $15 million.</TE>
<TE>   In early November, bulldozers leveled the "Pink Palace" of Holmby
Hills, an 8,200-square-foot 1935 Spanish-style home built at 10100
Sunset Blvd. for Rudy Vallee, much amended by Jayne Mansfield and
later taken over by Engelbert Humperdinck. The current owners, listed
as Burns Sunset Properties LLC, have cited plans to combine the
1.4-acre site with two neighboring properties to make a 10-acre
compound.</TE>
<TE>   Buildings from the early 1920s and late 1940s are the most likely
targets.</TE>
<TE>   That's not surprising, historians note, since so many structures
went up during those boom eras, just before the Depression and just
after World War II's conclusion. More than 200 structures built from
1947 to 1950 were targeted for demolition last year, along with 156
structures that went up from 1923 to 1926.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are the periods of housing that are being hit all over the
country," said Adrian Scott Fine, a senior program officer for the
National Trust for Historic Preservation, who recently completed a
report on tear-downs nationwide. "That's a big percentage of the
historic housing stock for a lot of communities." In many cases, he
added, "the houses that are going down are perfectly good houses."</TE>
<TE>   But they're not big houses. Fine notes the average new American
house measured 1,000 square feet in 1950; 1,500 square feet in 1970;
2,260 square feet in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Locally, demolitions typically jump with every economic boom.</TE>
<TE>   Demolition permits in Los Angeles have fluctuated since 1997,
rising and dipping between 955 and 1,418. In Santa Monica, officials
granted 276 demolition permits from 1999 through 2001, and 58 in the
first nine months of 2002. In Beverly Hills, officials report that
they issued 65 residential demolition permits from 2000 through 2001
and 21 in the first nine months of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   But beyond Southern California, the National Trust's Fine warned
in a July study, "a disturbing pattern of demolitions is approaching
epidemic proportions in historic neighborhoods across America."</TE>
<TE>   In days gone by, Fine and colleague Jim Lindberg wrote, the
tear-down phenomenon was mostly limited to ultra-rich neighborhoods,
such as Beverly Hills, where new residents have long knocked down
sound old homes to build bigger, more luxurious residences. Now, the
National Trust study asserts, historic neighborhoods in Chicago,
Denver, Dallas and elsewhere are among more than 100 communities in
20 states reporting growing numbers of tear-downs.</TE>
<TE>   To grapple with such issues, city-to-city comparisons show, New
York has a staff of about 45 devoted to architectural preservation
duties; Chicago and San Francisco, 10 staffers each; Washington,
D.C., Seattle, Atlanta and Phoenix, four to nine full-timers each.
Los Angeles has two to four, depending on how employees are counted.</TE>
<TE>   Further, authorities note that Los Angeles is the only major
American city that has not yet joined a federally sponsored
"certified local partner" preservation program, which offers
financial incentives to cities that agree to survey their historic
resources and appoint commissioners with training in architecture,
archeology or city planning. Given the relatively low cost of
joining, that program "should be a no-brainer," says the L.A.
Conservancy's Bernstein. City officials say they're working toward
joining the program.</TE>
<TE>   And although the Los Angeles City Council has granted protective
historic status to 15 neighborhoods and 738 individual sites, within
its 465-square-mile area, that sort of protection is weaker in Los
Angeles than in many other cities. Instead of blocking an owner's
demolition plans, as a monument designation does in New York, such a
designation by itself in Los Angeles can only delay demolition for up
to 360 days.</TE>
<TE>   Further, the city's monument list includes some surprising
omissions, such as the 1954 Capitol Records building in Hollywood --
one of Los Angeles' foremost icons, with an exterior that resembles a
stack of records with a stylus on top. Nobody has nominated it, city
officials say. (Despite its local omission, the Capitol Records
building is listed as a state historic resource. Historic status at
the city level typically carries more protection than inclusion on
state or national monument lists, preservationists say.)</TE>
<TE>   "Not every old building needs to be saved," says John Welborne, a
Los Angeles preservation consultant who sits on the board of the
National Trust for Historic Preservation. "But there are a lot of
good examples of historic architecture out there that can be
adaptively reused." Too often, he says, "it hasn't been done."</TE>
<TE>   The process</TE>
<TE>   When a property owner in Los Angeles plans to level a building,
the first step is to apply for a permit with the city's Building and
Safety Department. That department typically sends an inspector to
check out the targeted structure, and if the building doesn't already
carry a historic designation, inspectors are unlikely to raise an
alarm. In fact, the application form asks many questions about
location, valuation, the owner and the contract, but no questions
about the age of the structure involved.</TE>
<TE>   The city Building and Safety Department's spokesman and chief
residential inspector, Bob Steinbach, said his department has, on
occasion, flagged threats to potentially significant buildings, "but
I can't remember the last time that it happened. We don't track
that." He also said the city keeps no record of how often demolition
requests are turned down.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Oren, the city's historic preservation officer, says that in
15 years, he can't remember ever getting a call from Building and
Safety officials seeking advice on a proposed demolition that didn't
already have a historic designation. In Santa Monica, by comparison,
a city landmarks commission reviews demolition applications for every
building more than 40 years old.</TE>
<TE>   L.A.'s current practices, asserts the Getty's Howe, amount to "a
pattern of inadequate appraisals, last-minute interpretations, and
limited negotiating room in the designation and reviews process. This
has resulted in the destruction of important buildings along with the
erosion of community trust and loss of investment dollars."</TE>
<TE>   Right now, Howe says, developers are probably spending $1 million
or more yearly on legally mandated piecemeal pre-project studies that
might not be necessary if a city survey was in place. Given that,
says Howe, she suspects "it's costing Los Angeles more to be without
a survey than to develop one."</TE>
<TE>   Howe and others have made this case in recent meetings with City
Councilman Jack Weiss, who hopes to build a coalition to push forward
with a citywide survey. Weiss, whose 5th District territory includes
much of the city's Westside, on Oct. 22 persuaded colleagues to set
up committees of city officials and outside experts to explore survey
options.</TE>
<TE>   But experts acknowledge that the cost is likely to be well into
the millions, and Weiss isn't ready to suggest a timetable or funding
source. To fly, he acknowledges, the project may depend for most of
its money on sources outside city government, perhaps some from the
Getty, some from other philanthropies and some from the private
sector.</TE>
<TE>   Getty officials have underwritten Howe's 2001 study, hired her for
a long-term position and in 2000 established a three-year Preserve
L.A. program, which last April awarded $1.3 million in grants to
government agencies and nonprofit organizations caring for historic
buildings. But Getty's leaders say they can't bankroll a survey
alone.</TE>
<TE>   That puts the spotlight on city officials, whose preservation
history includes several false starts.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council first pledged to survey Los Angeles' historic and
cultural resources in 1962, when its members approved the city's
first Cultural Heritage Commission ordinance. But the survey, one of
the ordinance's costliest elements, was postponed. It was still
waiting 38 years later, when a new City Council approved another
survey proposal as part of another ambitious cultural plan -- then
backed off from the spending when economic doldrums set in.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the loudest voice for preservation is that of the Los
Angeles Conservancy, founded 24 years ago as a nonprofit organization
that leads neighborhood tours and raises alarms when it hears of
imperiled historic properties.</TE>
<TE>   Rethinking attitudes</TE>
<TE>   THE group's most public victory came six years ago, when it sued
to keep the Archdiocese of Los Angeles from demolishing the
quake-damaged St. Vibiana's Cathedral. (Downtown redeveloper Tom
Gilmore purchased the building and plans to renovate and reopen it as
an arts venue.) Since then, the conservancy's dues-paying membership
has grown from 4,500 to 7,200, and the group's modern committee has
won a reputation for ferocity in its quest to get the public to start
thinking of '40s, '50s and even '60s buildings as historic.</TE>
<TE>   The group's most closely watched address at the moment is the
Ambassador Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard, which dates to 1921 and was
the site of Robert F. Kennedy's assassination in 1968. The Los
Angeles Unified School District, owner of the 24-acre site, wants to
open a school complex there, and it has not decided whether to
convert the existing structure (which the conservancy is urging) or
level it.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, preservationists and the school district are old
adversaries. Although the district has taken a historic inventory of
its 947 schools -- many of which count among the community's most
familiar and beloved structures -- it has successfully resisted any
city historic designations.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the Ambassador, says Bob Moeller, the school
district's director of new construction, "we've really tried to
engage the conservancy, and we're open to preservation. But it has to
be within our budget."</TE>
<TE>   The economics that nudge the wrecking ball forward can be
powerful, especially in the vast majority of buildings that aren't
already on a monuments list or subject to a state-mandated
environmental impact report.</TE>
<TE>   Older buildings are especially ripe targets these days, says the
conservancy's Leib, because investors are attracted by historically
low mortgage rates, rapid appreciation and the chance to acquire
small buildings on large lots.</TE>
<TE>   Although it may cost $300,000 to $400,000 to buy a
1,500-square-foot house on a flat lot, knocking one down and scraping
it away is probably a matter of $3,000 to $4,000, and takes a day,
maybe two.</TE>
<TE>   "We just smash it up and separate what we can," says Jeff Hale,
president of Fast Forward Concrete Cutting in Canoga Park. A
1,500-square-foot house, he added, usually includes about 100 tons of
concrete (foundation, slab and driveway) and 20-some tons of
"everything else."</TE>
<TE>   Larger demos can be more complicated, requiring months as workers
take steps to separate materials and contain asbestos, sometimes even
limiting air pollution by enclosing a structure in shrink wrap. And
many large demos are coming up.</TE>
<TE>   In Century City, for instance, two eight-story buildings, which
include the 30-year-old Shubert Theatre and offices of the ABC
Entertainment Center, will be leveled in coming months to make room
for a new 15-story office building.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Unified School District headquarters building at
450 N. Grand Ave. is to be leveled in February, with a new high
school to rise in its place. The Caltrans District 7 headquarters
building, a 1949 modernist office building with a 1960 annex covering
a full city block along Spring Street between 1st and 2nd streets, is
to be leveled in favor of a public plaza in 2005, its occupants
relocated to a new office now rising next door.</TE>
<TE>   Less certain is the fate of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art,
where trustees announced plans a year ago for a demolition and
reconstruction costing an estimated $200 million to $300 million,
then put it all on hold in early December, saying fund-raising was
lagging.</TE>
<TE>   Still, "stuff comes in almost every day," says Jerry Hernandez,
manager of Santa Fe Wrecking in downtown Los Angeles, casting a
glance toward a ton or two of orphaned porcelain. "We probably have
about 300 toilets. We go as far back as about the 1890s."</TE>
<TE>   Working with demolition companies, firms such as Santa Fe Wrecking
harvest fixtures from doomed buildings, taking the best bits for
resale on lots like the one at Olympic Boulevard and South Santa Fe
Avenue. Each day, Hernandez and company sort glass doorknobs, stack
doors, wrangle sinks, drag wrought iron to the alley out back and
hose down old bathtubs, mostly claw-footed models from the 1930s and
before.</TE>
<TE>   "We have about 200 tubs," Hernandez says.</TE>
<TE>   How does he know?</TE>
<TE>   "Every year," he explains, "we do an inventory of what we have."</TE>

<LD>MIRAMAX chief Harvey Weinstein stood outside the theater after the
Los Angeles premiere of "Gangs of New York," greeting colleagues with
hearty handshakes and the buoyancy of a winner. He chatted amiably
with Variety columnist Army Archerd and bear-hugged director Kevin
Smith. There was no sign of the man characterized in a recent New
Yorker profile as a bombastic bully who is alienating Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, when asked what he thought of writer Ken Auletta's piece,
Weinstein chuckled and shook his head, saying, "Nothing." Behind him,
Miramax publicist Karen Paul repeated the evening's mantra, "Gangs of
New York."</LD>
<LD>   Here in Premieresville -- so-called by grumbling celebrity
photographers because eight films opened the week of Dec. 15 --
studio rivalries don't exist, co-stars are endlessly generous and
every director is "amazing." The red carpet is a parallel universe, a
media spectacle that even studio executives admit does little to
boost box office but is nevertheless integral to the Hollywood hype
machine.</LD>
<TE>   It's an experience that can exhaust even the most die-hard film
promoter. At the Westwood premiere of "The Hours," a Reuters reporter
stuck a long microphone in Nicole Kidman's face and shouted
repeatedly, "Why should your fans see this movie?" The actress
laughed and walked away, saying, "I don't know! I can't sell it!" To
an Australian TV reporter who asked, "Did this seem like an unlikely
role for you?," Kidman quipped: "I answered that question to you at
the junket!"</TE>
<TE>   Despite the disorienting strobe effect, the red-carpet premiere
draws critics and academy voters during the crucial season when
nominations are decided.</TE>
<TE>   Kidman's film was among the eight that premiered mid-December,
along with "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," "Catch Me if You
Can," "Narc," "Antwone Fisher" and "Gangs of New York." "Rings,"
"Gangs," "Catch" and "The Hours" earned Golden Globe nominations on
Dec. 19.</TE>
<TE>   After the "Gangs" premiere at the Directors Guild on Sunset
Boulevard, Quincy Jones shook director Martin Scorsese's hand
furiously, congratulating him. Later, Jones joined the chorus of
audience members apparently shaken by the film's brutality. "Some of
the stuff I could hardly look at," he said. Director Michael Mann
reserved comment on his friend's film, saying only, "It was a massive
effort." Others maneuvered through the after-party, nibbling caviar
and salmon and shaking their heads over Daniel Day-Lewis' turn as the
tyrannical gang leader Bill the Butcher. "What a performance, this
guy!" said actor Robert Forster. "It was the kind of movie people
don't make anymore," said Jennifer Tilly.</TE>
<TE>   At the reception for "The Hours" -- also starring Julianne Moore
and Meryl Streep -- guests compared notes on the film, which inspired
some to conversations of a philosophical bent and others to Oscar
forecasting. Producer David Foster summarized the opinions of several
when he asked, "How do we choose between these three women? That
should be three nominations right there."</TE>
<TE>   More important for the premiere regulars, however, was the next
stop. "Where are you going tomorrow night?" one woman asked a friend.
" 'Antwone Fisher,' " he said.</TE>

<LD>At the dawn of the 2003 awards season, it's the party designers, not
the actors, who are most harried, slinging silks and booking venues
in the hope that their shimmering affair will be the favored backdrop
for victory.</LD>
<LD>   Nostalgia is the palette from which some have drawn, as both the
Academy Awards and the Golden Globes celebrate significant
anniversaries this year -- their 75th and 60th, respectively.</LD>
<LD>   Although the Oscars are still three months away, Governors Ball
producer Cheryl Cecchetto has already planned the March 23
post-ceremony party down to the waiters' white gloves, the 30-piece
string orchestra and the chandeliers of orchids.</LD>
<TE>   That's no small task, considering that her every decision must be
approved by the academy's 11-member ball committee.</TE>
<TE>   To mark the anniversary, Cecchetto is dressing the Grand Ballroom
of the Hollywood &amp; Highland complex to resemble the Blossom Room of
the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel circa 1929, the location of the first
awards dinner. She has taken her cues from a black-and-white
photograph from that night featuring Joan Crawford, Sid Grauman, Al
Jolson and Mary Pickford, among a tuxedoed crowd.</TE>
<TE>   The enormous room will be awash in tones of sepia, silver, white,
ivory and black. The walls will be draped in velvet and the tables in
silk. Each centerpiece of lilies, roses and dendrobiums will feature
a framed replica of a memento -- a menu or ticket stub -- from an
early Academy Awards dinner.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything will tingle," said Cecchetto with a party designer's
enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   HBO's party designer, Billy Butchkavitz, envisions "something from
a Busby Berkeley movie scene" for the cable network's Jan. 19 Golden
Globes party at the Beverly Hilton. His post-Deco decor, he said,
will resemble that of a cruise ship circa 1930-45.</TE>
<TE>   Three days later, Butchkavitz will cast off nostalgia for a more
modern affair in Park City, Utah -- HBO's Sundance Film Festival
party at the popular beer hall Harry-O's.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm doing a whole party around ice," he said. "Trees covered with
mirrored shards and huge icicles hanging from the ceiling. Lasers
too, and human forms coming off the balconies that look like frozen
humans. I just want to get that cold winter look."</TE>

<HD>Good things come in threes</HD>
<DH>Walt Disney Concert Hall's trio of gala concerts and
parties aim to be eye-popping as well as ear-opening.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ann Conway</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unpredictable. Curvy. Dramatic. Those are the catchwords for the trio
of soirees that will celebrate the opening of the new Walt Disney
Concert Hall in October. Inspired by architect Frank O. Gehry's
undulating stainless steel structure at the corner of 1st and Grand,
the galas for 2,000 people each on three consecutive nights -- two to
be held in a transparent tent atop a parking structure across the
street, and one in the hall -- are expected to raise upward of $3
million for the Los Angeles Philharmonic's inaugural season in its
new home.</LD>
<LD>   The rationale for three evenings of concerts and parties was the
chance to "introduce people to the hall while crossing musical
barriers," says arts activist Ginny Mancini, chairwoman of all three
galas.</LD>
<LD>   "On the first night they'll hear the tried-and-true classics. On
the second, the new music of the 21st century. And on the third,
we'll honor the European composers who fled Nazi Germany to come to
Hollywood and were hired by the film industry. And each gala will be
different -- people won't believe the transformations that have taken
place," she adds. "Guests will have three unique experiences."</LD>
<TE>   Mancini, a native Angeleno and widow of composer Henry Mancini,
has chaired benefits such as the reopening of UCLA's Royce Hall and a
season opener for Los Angeles Opera. But she's pinching herself over
her leading role in the opening of what some say will be one of the
world's great concert halls. "This is the biggest thing to ever hit
L.A.'s social scene," she says. "When I was a kid, the biggest thing
that happened to me was when I played hooky to watch the mayor cut
the ribbon on Union Station. We've stepped up a bit."</TE>
<TE>   Thirty percent of the tickets have already been sold, at prices
ranging from $125,000 for the Trio Package (10 tickets and primo
seating for all three concerts and galas) to $500 per ticket for the
Oct. 24 bash in the hall. Individual tickets for the Oct. 23
opening-night celebration are $1,500 each, with tables for 10 ranging
from $15,000 to $50,000. Tickets for the final gala on Oct. 25 are
$1,000 each, with tables selling for $10,000 to $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   The party designers have dreamed up eye-popping effects -- from
light shows and fireworks displays set to music to sudden "reveals"
of the surrounding metropolis. "Think of them as galas with a twist.
With Frank Gehry nothing is predictable, and we want to incorporate
those elements into all three evenings," says Marianne Weiman-Nelson,
a partner in Special Occasions of Los Angeles.Opening night, with its
"Sonic LA" concert theme, will feature a pre-concert reception in the
hall and gardens, and a post-performance black-tie celebration in the
rooftop tent, where guests will dine on a menu by Joachim Splichal
and dance to the sounds of Pink Martini. The decor will be
autumn-toned, in shades ranging from apricot to burnt orange,
cranberry to chocolate. "Remember, with Frank Gehry there are no
lines. Each color palette will turn and flow into the next. We will
even use color to help guests find their seats," Weiman-Nelson says.</TE>
<TE>   Gala Night 2 -- with the dress code a less formal "L.A. Chic" and
the concert themed "Living LA" -- will showcase the hall and its
gardens, with guests finding "a surprise at every curve," Mancini
says. "We'll have food stations and different entertainment
throughout the hall."</TE>
<TE>   On Gala Night 3, themed "Soundstage LA," guests will again
celebrate in the tent at a black-tie dinner dance featuring the Henry
Mancini Institute Big Band. On this night, the decor will be Art
Deco, in a salute to downtown's architectural past. "Custom-made
mirror chandeliers that will reflect the city are being created. The
gala color scheme is blue, black, white and silver, and glass panels
are being engraved and etched," Weiman-Nelson says. "And don't expect
round [dinner] plates."</TE>
<TE>   Determined to be uniquely dressed at each affair, Mancini has been
carrying around swatches of the Disney Hall upholstery -- a muted
pattern in shades of pale green, orange and red -- in her search for
gala gowns. "I thought it would be fun not to clash with the
fabrics," she says. "As special as the galas are going to be, I want
to be equally glamorous."</TE>

<DH>Author Craig Childs wanders far off the beaten track to
tell of the life in seemingly barren landscapes -- and also to have
fun with friends.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Salter Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>Blanding, Utah</DL>
<LD>CRAIG Childs finds it strange to be in a place "where people actually
go." Eight months of each year he spends walking the Southwest,
mostly the Colorado Plateau. If he's lucky, the way he sees it, he
gets lost. Traveling in an area that has a few footprints here and
there, a place to park the truck before you walk into the canyon,
well, he finds this funny, the way some of us chuckle if we happen to
find ourselves in McDonald's.</LD>
<LD>   What is he looking for? Back when he was writing "The Secret
Knowledge of Water" in 2000, he was prowling around the desert
looking for water holes and explaining the dynamics of desert floods
in his sense-surround style. He wasn't thinking about his career as
an author, but then his second book came out earlier this fall, "The
Soul of Nowhere" (Sasquatch Books), about wandering with friends from
the Sierra Madre in Mexico to the canyons of Utah to the Sea of
Cortez, noticing the shards and scrawls of earlier civilizations.</LD>
<LD>   It was the end of anonymity for Childs, who now, at 36, finds
himself a regular correspondent for National Public Radio, writes for
everything from Outside magazine to High Desert News and is working
on a new book about the Anasazi Indians.</LD>
<TE>   As a naturalist, Childs falls somewhere between the conservative
conservation of John Muir and the anarchistic leanings of Edward
Abbey. He is fierce about leaving things alone but gentle when it
comes to man's place in the universe. He is often put in the
uncomfortable position of disagreeing with environmentalists who
express an urgency that he feels is sometimes unwarranted. If
anything, his travels have shown him how temporary we are, how tiny
our mark, how insignificant.</TE>
<TE>   As a writer, Childs is most interested in telling the story of a
landscape and conveying what it feels like to be there. It is a
writing style not unlike Rachel Carson's (particularly in "A Sense of
Wonder") and Aldo Leopold's in "A Sand County Almanac," writers who
both expressed the fear that if people had no sense of the wild, it
would be that much harder for them to care about protecting it.</TE>
<TE>   Childs, however, engages in as few environmental debates as
possible. He has developed a set of skills that he believes can be
used in every environment, even the dark canyons of Manhattan. They
involve paying attention, being aware of yourself as part of the
place, tracking and having a good time with friends, not necessarily
in that order.</TE>
<TE>   Childs invites a guest to join him and some friends on a two-day
hike in southern Utah on the condition the exact location not be
revealed. The group includes Dirk Vaughan, a 46-year-old ex-Denver
cop who now lives in Moab, Utah; Colin Wann, who, at 24, is nicknamed
"The Boy" and lives pretty much out of his truck; and Childs' wife,
Regan Choi, who is five months pregnant with their first child and is
a serious hiker in her own right.</TE>
<TE>   Along the hike, the group spots granaries, kivas, dozens of arrow
flints and pieces of pottery, and what Childs believes was an
unopened grave site, surely a treasure trove of baskets and beads and
pots and clues. But he lets the mystery lie and leaves the grave
untouched.</TE>
<TE>   The day before, Childs and Vaughan had found a large black-and-red
painted Anasazi pot, partially buried in sand. They did not move it.
They sat with it for many hours. On the open market, Vaughan says,
that pot would sell for $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   Childs does not look vertically. He does not dig. He looks
horizontally at a site, trying to piece together the patterns of life
and travel and survival that have been etched in the landscape,
visible only to the still, trained eye. In some ways, this method
harks back to the time of the gentleman naturalist, the explorer who
walked and wrote stories about his field work, long before computers
allowed for the kinds of data analysis and extrapolation based on
case studies.</TE>
<TE>   When not exploring, he and Choi live in Colorado. This winter,
they are having indoor plumbing installed, which doesn't seem to
rouse the level of excitement one might expect. No, they are more
excited about the quantities of cherries and peaches they get in the
spring and summer from neighbors. The two met while working for an
outdoors outfitter.</TE>
<TE>   Embalmed artifacts</TE>
<TE>   In the early 20th century, of course, there was a great deal of
plundering of artifacts, of dragging them back to museums to be
embalmed in glass cases. Childs and company do not want to see this
happening on their account. "The object is to become lost," Vaugan
says. "Look forward as much as backward. Never go down a path you
couldn't go back on."</TE>
<TE>   There has been much debate about whether the Anasazis were in fact
a violent people and whether they engaged in cannibalism, a theory
supported by various evidence, from skulls with spoon marks on the
inside, to DNA found in cooking fires to mass bone fields.</TE>
<TE>   The northernmost Anasazi, on the other hand, were primarily
hunters and gatherers, and both Childs and Vaughan feel that they
were more peaceful and more creative than their grain-gathering
agricultural cousins, who spent much of their lives hoarding grain
and fighting over food supplies.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't read much," says Childs as he walks, carrying packs to a
plateau where the group will camp for two nights. "I'm trying to
develop my senses and some other, extra sense." He puts his hand on a
partially dead 300-year-old juniper, notices the drainage ditch at
its roots, how it fell and how it twists.</TE>
<TE>   "Every object has a trail leading to it and away from it, a kind
of perpetual motion in which there is no loss and no gain, only
movement."</TE>
<TE>   Childs is hampered in walking by his compulsion to write. He
carries a small leather notebook in which he makes inscrutably tiny
notes that fill every speck of whiteness on the page.</TE>
<TE>   In less than 20 minutes, the group is crouching under an overhang
by a 700-year-old Anasazi granary, looking across the canyon to an
arch formation through which the setting sun sends a perfect beam
straight out.</TE>
<TE>   In the morning, the friends discuss routes. The four can see
possibilities under ledges that it seems no human without wings could
get to. Along the route, there are several granaries in good shape,
one of which shows handprints and corncobs inside.</TE>
<TE>   Childs and Vaughan speculate about dates and building methods and
routes in and out of the site. At the end of the day, heading back to
camp, Childs hangs back and whistles down the canyon. He's found
something. Vaughan, who is tired, groans.</TE>
<TE>   "He always does this. It'll be the end of the day and he'll point
and say, 'What about going over there?' We have a word for it. We
call it Lelandia. His middle name is Leland. The last thing you want
to do at the end of a day is go to Lelandia. But it's always where
the treasures are."</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, the three crouch around an unopened burial site on a
north-facing ridge. "It's important to leave things intact so that
other people can feel this sense of discovery," explains Childs. The
landscape weaves a spell on them. They start howling and jumping like
monkeys, playing around.</TE>
<TE>   "Craig gets as close as any writer I know to that interface
between writing and doing," Vaughan says, and the comment rings true.
Childs' writing engages more of the senses at once than that of most
any naturalist: "This place was hungry," he wrote in "The Soul of
Nowhere." "Pulling in everything it could, filling itself with the
tumult of the earth. I could smell it all around, the feral,
seductive scent of decay and sprouting seeds. And this solitary ray
of sunlight. It was a stranger down here, a thing of logic and
propriety fallen into the filthy underworld. I was tempted to at
least reach my hand into it, but decided not to. I had only come to
look at it out of curiosity. I left it alone. I turned and worked my
way deeper into the chasm's throat."</TE>
<TE>   The group breaks camp the next morning and walks back, careful not
to crumple too much crypto-soil, a delicate, living layer of topsoil.
"When you walk up to a precarious boulder and push on it and it tilts
and cracks, some of your relationship is defined. Maybe the
clumsiness of your action will spin around and bite you," Childs
says.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the truck, a fine red dust covers everyone. "What I want
to know," says Childs, who will continue on with Wann for another
four weeks, "is why am I so hungry for this?"</TE>

<LD>National Lampoon stepped back into the parody business earlier this
month with a characteristically tasteless but mildly amusing
skewering of the entertainment business.</LD>
<LD>   Among the less offensive items in its Hollywood Reporter
look-alike, "The Hollywood Retorter":</LD>
<LD>   An obituary for Feathers, "MGM's script-choosing parrot," who "had
worked at MGM since 1991, greenlighting various projects throughout
his tenure by nodding his head at one of a fan of scripts laid out in
front of him. Many credit him with single-handedly jump-starting the
once ailing studio. 'Feathers had a gift,' stated MGM/UA President
Michael Nathanson. 'For a bird whose brain was roughly the size of a
plump raisin, he had a keen eye for scripts that perfectly mirrored
what America wanted to see at a given time.' "</LD>
<TE>   A barbed-wire-adorned ad for "Writers Concentration Camp": "Two
feature-length screenplays a day? Sound unreasonable? Not with our
intensive immersion method!! Don't miss the train!"</TE>
<TE>   And on a sweeter note, a look at "Bram Stoker's Count Chocula,"
billed as a new Jonathan Demme project: "Demme's coldly majestic
style and Chocula's raw animal sexuality blend as nicely as bananas
and corn flakes."</TE>

<HD>Stars can't act their age now</HD>
<DH>Suavity, worldliness, sophistication -- traits of the past
are lost on today's actors and fans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Whittle</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Browsing through a Hollywood memorabilia shop recently, I came across
a batch of transfixing old photos. They were copies of one of the
best-known fashion advertising campaigns of the past 40 years, for
Blackglama furs. The famous tagline -- "What becomes a legend most?"
-- was all that accompanied this series of smokily glamorous
black-and-white portraits, dating largely from the '60s and '70s, of
such stars as Marlene Dietrich, Sophia Loren and Natalie Wood.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't the sight of all these beautiful bodies draped in
politically incorrect animal pelts that was so startling. It was that
in their sophistication, their urbanity, indeed, in their sheer
adultness, these people seemed like creatures from another planet.
They suggested worldly experience -- of sex, love, wealth and wit --
and at the same time managed to wear it all lightly.</LD>
<LD>   Such adults, in all their cosmopolitan splendor, seem to be an
endangered species in today's world of micro-celebrity. The stars who
twinkle in our current firmament might be sexy, buff, quirky and full
of elfin energy, but adult they are not. There is a world of
difference between the debonair Cary Grant in "Charade," and Mark
Wahlberg, who plays the same character in the current remake, "The
Truth About Charlie." The former is urbane, the latter simply urban.</LD>
<TE>   We live, it seems, a million light years away from the knowing,
rakish charm of Clark Gable and Carole Lombard, the regal old-world
bearing of Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh or even the
diamond-studded panache of Richard Burton and Liz Taylor. It's Brad
and Jennifer, and Reese and Ryan who rule our world now, but they do
so more as prom king and queen, and that is how we respond to them.</TE>
<TE>   Where did all the adults go? Studios report the core movie
audience is in the 16-to-24 age group. As a result, filmmakers strain
every chord to keep their attention.</TE>
<TE>   The actors on the big screen today are, in fact, mostly the same
age as ever they were, but with few exceptions, they look, sound, act
and respond like teenagers, or at least people on whom real adulthood
has yet to dawn. The sight of Catherine Deneuve and Fanny Ardant in
the recent French comedy "8 Women" -- elegant, indifferent,
self-mocking, adult -- contrasts sharply with that of the
superannuated adolescents parading before us now in most mainstream
movies and on TV.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody seems to be playing roles that are age-appropriate," says
Peter Rainer, film critic of New York magazine and chairman of the
National Society of Film Critics. "It's good that there has been a
certain freeing up in terms of age in the movies, but it doesn't
compensate for what we've lost. In earlier times, a cult of youthful
innocence certainly existed, but you still had more people portraying
mature characters and stories that were adult-oriented. And studio
movies are also being produced by younger people, with no background
in them and little life experience of anything else."</TE>
<TE>   Quick to mature</TE>
<TE>   A quick look into the film archives brings the point home. It's
sobering to consider that when the cool, sophisticated, restrained
Grace Kelly wafted into the frame in Alfred Hitchcock's "Rear Window"
in 1954, she was just 25. And that when Lauren Bacall told Humphrey
Bogart to just "put your lips together and blow" in "To Have and Have
Not," she was a mere 19. Compare that with the zany, "aren't I
crazy?" muggings of 30-year-old Cameron Diaz or the blank waifishness
of the unfortunate Winona Ryder, so evident in her
doe-caught-in-the-headlights look during her trial. (And for the
ultimate juvenile offense! How one yearns for the full-blooded drama
of a Lana Turner murder trial.)</TE>
<TE>   The difference between the suave reliability of the pristine Cary
Grant and the sputtering tentativeness of his supposed modern
incarnation, Hugh Grant, shows how, no matter how grown up you might
appear, it's required nowadays that in matters of behavior, it's best
to defer to the child within.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the terms "leading man" and "leading lady" increasingly
seem to be misnomers.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of glamour in today's celebrities is frequently bemoaned
by those nostalgic for the golden age. But it seems what we are
really regretting is the end of something bigger, adulthood. Being
grown up is the absolute prerequisite for possessing true glamour,
and the out-of-control cult of youth, with its desperate need to
praise the shiny and new above all else, has in the past 20 years
stealthily but effectively robbed us of a sense that adultness is to
be aspired to.</TE>
<TE>   "Our obsession with youth is not new, but it's definitely
accelerated," says Morris Berman, author of "The Twilight of American
Culture." Looking at American culture in Freudian terms, he says, we
can see how the "adult" part of the psyche, the superego, has, since
the '60s, effectively been discarded, leaving only the id -- that
part representing selfish, childlike desires. This is reflected in
the movies. "Infants want to be entertained and tend to resist
education," Berman says. "Compare movies from the '50s with those of
the '90s. Just in terms of camera time for conversation, those from
the '50s moved slowly and people talked. Now, the length of sentences
are short, and that's because a child's attention span is so short."</TE>
<TE>   This triumph of childhood over adulthood may have disabled whole
movie genres. The wispy romantic comedies of Doris Day and Rock
Hudson in the '50s might have borne little relation to reality, but
these actors played characters who were recognizably and
independently adult, and reacted to each other as such. Compare this
with the sweetie-pie, kooky little-girl posturings of Meg Ryan in
recent attempts at such pairings during the past decade, and "Pillow
Talk" takes on all the weight of a Chekhov play.</TE>
<TE>   If, as could be argued, an idea of European sophistication
informed our ideas of what was adult and glamorous in Hollywood in
past decades, then the worldwide dominance of a certain kind of
American culture -- its youth culture -- has effectively sidelined
it. "In the '50s and into the '60s, there was a European sensibility
that still had an influence in movies," said Barbara Steele, a
British actress and Emmy-winning producer, "and the American strength
was a great kind of freshness. Now, it's hard to relate to anybody on
screen. There's a sort of empty infantilism, a total lack of a sense
of experience."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the aura of sophistication that was spun around
celebrities in the past was often the work of publicists. Certainly,
as the newly unexpurgated diaries of the late British photographer
and socialite Cecil Beaton show, he was less than impressed by the
ordinariness and provincialism of many of the celebrities of
yesteryear he encountered in the flesh.</TE>
<TE>   But this does not take away from the fact that there was an
aspiration to mystery, to worldliness and the suggestion of having
been around the block -- qualities that don't fit well into our
current cultural atmosphere of perpetual adolescence. But, hey, we
can talk about that later, "Friends" is on. Pass me my water bottle
and baseball cap.</TE>

<HD>Prices Falling for Free Agents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Blum</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- The bear market isn't just on Wall Street anymore. Just
ask baseball's free agents.</LD>
<LD>   In a sport where prices have skyrocketed since 1976 -- except for
the collusion years and the fallout of the 1994-95 strike -- players
have seen prices stagnate, then drop since Alex Rodriguez signed his
record $252 million, 10-year contract with the Texas Rangers in
December 2000.</LD>
<LD>   "It comes as no surprise, and for a variety of reasons, that it is
some kind of a buyer's market," agent Tom Reich said Wednesday, 50
days before the start of spring training.</LD>
<TE>   Among the 157 players who filed for free agency following the
World Series, 61 have agreed to new contracts, ahead of last year's
pace on Christmas Day (50 of 154) but behind two years ago (75 of
136).</TE>
<TE>   Here's the telling sign: Just 18 players have gotten deals for $5
million or more total, down from 25 last year and 35 two years ago.
Only six players have gotten $20 million and higher, down from nine
last year and way below the 15 at this point following the 2000
season.</TE>
<TE>   And among the stars?</TE>
<TE>   Jim Thome is the only player to top $40 million, agreeing to an
$85 million, six-year contract with Philadelphia. Last year, New York
Yankees first baseman Jason Giambi ($120 million for seven years) and
Texas pitcher Chan Ho Park ($65 million for five years) topped that
level.</TE>
<TE>   And in 2000, one of the most talented free-agent classes ever,
seven players were over $40 million, a group that included Rodriguez,
Manny Ramirez ($160 million for eight years), Mike Hampton ($121
million for eight years), Mike Mussina ($88.5 million for six years),
Darren Dreifort ($55 million for five years), Denny Neagle ($51
million for five years) and Kevin Appier ($42 million for four
years).</TE>
<TE>   "There's a heightened awareness on the part of teams about player
compensation issues," agent Jeff Moorad said. "Some of that awareness
comes from the new labor agreement, some of it comes from I believe,
better coaching and guidance from central baseball. For the first
time in years, it seems teams have learned restraint, and some of
which is positive for the industry as a whole."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Glavine, a two-time Cy Young Award winner, wanted a guaranteed
four-year deal but settled for $35 million over three years from the
New York Mets. Jeff Kent, the 2000 NL MVP, got $18.2 million over two
years with Houston.</TE>
<TE>   No teams publicly pursued Greg Maddux, a four-time Cy Young
winner, and he accepted Atlanta's offer of salary arbitration. Roger
Clemens is willing to take a cut from the $15.45 million average
under his last contract to the $8 million-to-$10 million range in
order to stay with the New York Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   Ivan Rodriguez, a 10-time All-Star catcher, drew interest only
from the Chicago Cubs and Baltimore, and when he didn't like their
offers, he started to consider signing with a Japanese team.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees, looking ahead to increased revenue sharing and the
luxury tax, spurned high-priced free agents -- except when two
foreign stars came on the market, giving Cuban pitcher Jose Contreras
$32 million over four years and Japanese outfielder Hideki Matsui $21
million over three years.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta, Texas, Boston and Los Angeles, all not wanting to spend
big, didn't go after premier free agents. The Braves even dealt
pitcher Kevin Millwood to Philadelphia for minor league catcher
Johnny Estrada to save money.</TE>
<TE>   "We had no choice but to move payroll," Braves general manager
John Schuerholz said. "We had to trade Kevin Millwood. It wasn't a
pleasant thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   Mid-level veterans have been hurt most. A year after the Yankees
gave reliever Steve Karsay a $22.45 million, four-year contract, they
let Stanton go, and the left-hander's agents pushed hard until they
got a $9 million, three-year deal from the Mets. Frank Castillo,
coming off a $4.5 million, two-year contract with Boston, re-signed
for $800,000 for one year.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve of the players who filed for free agency have agreed to
minor league contracts, with no guarantee of major league termination
pay, up from six at this time last year.</TE>
<TE>   Why the drop-off?</TE>
<TE>   Except for the 32-year-old Thome, all the big-name free agents
were either over 35 or coming off injuries. Teams are putting more
players on the market, refusing to give contracts to 46 players by
the Dec. 20 tender deadline, up from 34 last year and 27 two years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "There are still a huge, huge number of players out there
unsigned," Texas GM John Hart said earlier this month. "Maybe there
is a buy out there, a bargain for a guy on a short term that can come
in."</TE>
<TE>   Ticket prices, which had increased 12 percent annually in 2000 and
2001, were essentially flat last year, with a major league average of
$18.31. The soft economy is hurting advertising sales for teams,
creating more pressure to cut costs.</TE>
<TE>   Since the end of the season, Colorado has traded Hampton, Florida
unloaded Preston Wilson and Charles Johnson, and Oakland dealt Cory
Lidle. The Yankees have been trying to trade Raul Mondesi, Rondell
White and Sterling Hitchcock, and Montreal has been seeking to get
rid of Bartolo Colon or Javier Vazquez.</TE>
<TE>   "I learned in the GM meetings that any payroll flexibility a club
has is going to be very powerful in the next few months," Oakland
general manager Billy Beane said.</TE>

<HD>Mets, Yankees Trades Still Uncommon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hal Bock</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>NEW YORK --When two teams compete in the same market, there is
usually grudging acknowledgment between them and sometimes, not even
that. Nowhere do the feelings run deeper than in New York, where the
Giants once returned mail from the Jets unopened and Ranger fans
still jeer ex-Islander Denis Potvin, 14 years after he retired.</LD>
<LD>   Now, though, an era of good feeling has emerged between the
baseball Mets and Yankees, generated by free-agent signings.</LD>
<LD>   The Yankees' brain trust is headed by Joe Torre, who first managed
the Mets, pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre, who had the same job at
Shea Stadium and dugout coach Don Zimmer, forever a footnote in Mets
history because he went 0-for-34 in their first season.</LD>
<TE>   Robin Ventura was traded by the Mets to the Yankees last year, the
first deal between the teams in eight years, and then re-signed with
the Yankees during the offseason.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Yankees signed Todd Zeile, who was Ventura's best friend
with the Mets. Not to be outdone, the Mets scooped up ex-Yankees
reliever Mike Stanton, who joined ex-Yankee Al Leiter on the pitching
staff.</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura trade was a landmark deal because it marked just the
sixth time the teams had exchanged players. No major league players
had passed between the teams since 1992.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a reason it takes eight years to make a deal," Yankees GM
Brian Cashman said then. "We're in competition with each other. You
always tread carefully with each other and respect each other from
afar. It could be another eight years, who knows?"</TE>
<TE>   There have been no other trades, although the Stanton signing was
somewhat related to the Ventura deal.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets acquired David Justice for Ventura and then almost
immediately traded him to Oakland for reliever Mark Guthrie. After
one year, Guthrie was not offered arbitration and his spot in the
bullpen went to Stanton.</TE>
<TE>   Mets GM Steve Phillips noted the cross-pollination of players
between the teams.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to think that the rivalry could be fueled any more than
it already is," he said. "But it may be. We'll see what happens."</TE>
<TE>   Relations between the Mets and Yankees have always been frosty,
ever since spring training 1962, when Casey Stengel used his best two
pitchers, Roger Craig and Al Jackson, to win the first exhibition
game between the teams.</TE>
<TE>   The expansion team's triumph over their haughty neighbors was a
benchmark, especially in Toots Shor's Manhattan saloon, where the
proprietor reported the patrons were celebrating like it was New
Year's Eve.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since George Steinbrenner took over stewardship of the
Yankees in 1973, spring training games between the teams have been
treated like Armageddon.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, though, each team has been attracted by the other's
players.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1996, not counting Justice, nine players have shown up on
both New York teams -- Ventura, Zeile, Stanton, Kenny Rogers, Tony
Tarasco, Allen Watson, Lance Johnson, Darren Bragg and Jose Vizcaino.</TE>
<TE>   Vizcaino was a Yankee only briefly, just long enough to break his
old team's heart by delivering the game-winning hit in the opening
game of the 2000 World Series.</TE>
<TE>   That was the same year that Roger Clemens beaned Mike Piazza in
the regular season and then threw a broken bat in his direction in
Game 2 of the World Series, prompting a $50,000 fine and inflaming
Mets fans.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets responded by refusing to allow the Yankees to use their
Shea Stadium training room during interleague games. Stanton was one
of the players barred. That won't be a problem for him next season.</TE>

<HD>Georgia, Coach Richt Keeping the Faith</HD>
<DH>Sugar Bowl-bound Bulldogs balance religion with a violent
game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Newberry</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>Mark Richt couldn't help himself: After Georgia clinched a spot in
the Southeastern Conference championship with an improbable
fourth-down touchdown pass, he blurted out his thanks to God.</LD>
<LD>   "I was overwhelmed by the journey God had taken me on," Richt
recalled Friday. "By no means was I saying, 'Thank God for letting us
win."'</LD>
<LD>   Even so, some people were miffed that Georgia's deeply religious
coach -- he once fasted for 40 days -- had chosen to go public with
such a personal issue. Indeed, the connection between faith and
football can be tenuous at times.</LD>
<TE>   Just listen to one of Richt's players, All-American defensive end
David Pollack. Around campus, the sophomore wears a bracelet with the
letters "WWJD" (What Would Jesus Do). Adorned with pads and helmet,
he morphs into a trash-talking, swaggering player who wants to put a
hurtin' on his opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to balance the two," Pollack said. "I'm nuts on the
field. Off the field, I'm pretty calm. You've got to have a switch
you can flip on and off."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, he can't be worried about tenets such as forgiveness
and love thy fellow man when going mano-y-mano with some 300-pound
offensive lineman.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess you could be soft on the field, but you're not going to
be a very good player," Pollack said. "Like I was saying, you've got
to be able to flip that switch on."</TE>
<TE>   While Richt's religious faith is well known, he rarely talked
about it publicly during third-ranked Georgia's run to the Sugar
Bowl, where the Bulldogs will meet No. 16 Florida State on New Year's
Day.</TE>
<TE>   The exception came on Nov. 16, shortly after David Greene threw a
fourth-down, 19-yard touchdown pass to Michael Johnson that beat
Auburn 24-21 and clinched the SEC East.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly overwhelmed by the moment, Richt started his postgame news
conference with comments that seemed better suited for the pulpit
than the gridiron. Afterward, he received a few letters complaining
it was an inappropriate time to bring up religion.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew we had done something special," Richt said, standing on
the field at the Superdome before a morning practice. "But I offended
some people. The last thing I wanted to do was offend anyone. I
apologize for that."</TE>
<TE>   In all fairness, Richt isn't one of those guys who praises the
almighty every time his team wins a big game. That doesn't mean he
considers the subject off-limits. After all, most religions are
centered on the concept of spreading the faith.</TE>
<TE>   "I try not to make a big deal out of it," Richt said. "But when
I'm asked about it, I'm not going to deny it."</TE>
<TE>   The second-year coach has made religion a big part of his program.
There are devotionals, chapel services and close ties with groups
such as the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. If fact, the team
attended an FCA breakfast before its Friday practice.</TE>
<TE>   Richt stressed that all of those activities are voluntary. For
him, faith is something that each of his players must discover on his
own.</TE>

<HD>Playoffs Possible for Cleveland</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Withers</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BEREA, Ohio</DL>
<LD>Like a giant, dangling carrot, the playoffs are right there in front
of the Cleveland Browns.</LD>
<LD>   "This is it," cornerback Corey Fuller said. "We've waited for this
kind of game for four years. This is what we wanted, playing for
something at the end of the year."</LD>
<LD>   With a win over the Atlanta Falcons today, and some help from
Oakland or Denver and Miami or the New York Jets, the Browns (8-7)
can clinch a spot in the AFC playoffs for the first time since 1994.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel good about where we are," quarterback Tim Couch said. "I
like our chances."</TE>
<TE>   Those chances will increase dramatically on Saturday if the
Raiders beat the Kansas City Chiefs (8-7), one of 12 AFC teams who
enter the weekend still alive in the jumbled playoff mix.</TE>
<TE>   But none of the complicated formulas, scenarios or possibilities
will matter much if the Browns don't win their home season finale.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland is just 2-5 this season at home, where Browns fans have
endured one disappointing loss after another.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a win this week at home to keep us in the hunt would get
a lot of fans back on our side," said Couch, a lightning rod for
abusive Browns fans all season. "I don't blame them for being upset
for the way we played at home. There's no excuse."</TE>
<TE>   Fuller, too, wants nothing more than to get Cleveland fans
excited.</TE>
<TE>   "I just know what it's going to be like in this town if we can
make the playoffs," he said. "When was the last time the Browns made
it, '94? That's going on 10 years. It's time."</TE>
<TE>   For Fuller, beating Atlanta with a playoff spot on the line has
added meaning.</TE>
<TE>   As a member of the Minnesota Vikings in 1999, Fuller lost to the
Falcons in one of the NFC's most memorable championship games when
Morten Andersen's 38-yard field goal in overtime sent Atlanta to the
Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "It took me two weeks to get over that game mentally and
physically," Fuller said. "That's how much I put into it."</TE>
<TE>   The Vikings went 15-1 that season, with an offense that set
several NFL records. But none of that mattered once Andersen's kick
split the uprights.</TE>
<TE>   "Corey probably played the best defensive game we've ever seen,"
said Browns linebacker Dwayne Rudd, one of Fuller's teammates in
Minnesota. "Corey was unbelievable. He played so well and made so
many big plays that he thought it would be enough to get us to the
Super Bowl."</TE>
<TE>   Fuller approaches this game with as much fervor, but he's not on
any one-man crusade for revenge.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been here three years and got my head kicked in," he said.
"That's enough motivation right there."</TE>
<TE>   Fuller is one of only 10 players remaining from Cleveland's 1999
expansion team, which went 2-14 and then 3-13 in 2000. He has lived
through the bad times with the Browns, and now that they're on the
verge of something special, Fuller doesn't want to see it wasted.</TE>
<TE>   And at 31, the nine-year veteran knows he won't have many more
chances.</TE>
<TE>   "This week, it's as important as going to the Super Bowl or the
playoffs," he said. "It ain't just no other game for me. It's big."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The road back from his injury has been a grueling one, his lengthy
rehabilitation made more difficult by nagging doubts about whether he
would ever recover fully.</TE>
<TE>   But Ed McCaffrey has responded with a productive season for the
Denver Broncos.</TE>
<TE>   Showing steady improvement throughout the year after breaking both
bones in his lower left leg early in the 2001 season, the wide
receiver has caught 62 passes for 791 yards entering today's
regular-season finale against Arizona. And he's gained admiration
from his teammates and coaches.</TE>
<TE>   "He's had a great year," coach Mike Shanahan said Friday. "There
were some questions going into summer camp if he'd be able to make it
through, but he's played well."</TE>
<TE>   Although he still limps occasionally, McCaffrey said his injured
leg "feels pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   Sometime during this season, McCaffrey changed his attitude --
from being a receiver coming off a major injury to being a receiver,
period.</TE>
<TE>   "My mindset now is I'm like every other receiver in the league,"
he said. "I want to make big plays every time I get a chance.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I've progressed a lot from the beginning of the season.
When I look at film from earlier in the year, I see I'm much further
ahead of where I was at that point in the season. I realize now that
in those first couple of weeks, I wasn't 100 percent.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, with a whole offseason to go, I'll be in even better
shape next year."</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, McCaffrey had his third straight 1,000-yard season for
the Broncos, catching a team-high 101 passes.</TE>
<TE>   Primed for another big year, his season ended abruptly in the
opener on Sept. 10, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Catching a pass over the middle in a Monday night game against the
New York Giants, McCaffrey collided with safety Shaun Williams and
broke the tibia and fibula in his left leg -- an injury that could
have ended his career.</TE>

<HD>Dungy Doesn't Get the Point on Offense</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Oates</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tony Dungy of the Indianapolis Colts, as a first-year AFC coach, is
doing the same things that got him feared and then fired in Tampa, an
NFC town.</LD>
<LD>   Dungy has risen to notoriety as a leader whose teams play strong,
creative defense -- but no offense.</LD>
<LD>   Thus Dungy's strength, defense, is at the same time his weakness.
He seems to reason that he can build a defensive team so sound that
he doesn't need an offense.</LD>
<TE>   Again this year, he's using a good offensive team only as a weapon
to help his defense. At Indianapolis, the role of his quarterback,
Peyton Manning, is the same as it was for Tampa Bay quarterback Shaun
King:</TE>
<TE>   * Run time off the clock with first-down ground plays and other
ball-control snaps.</TE>
<TE>   * Do not attack with first-down passes or other big plays.</TE>
<TE>   One of the NFL's brightest coaches, Dungy would lead them all if
only he'd come up as an offensive expert instead of a defensive
genius.</TE>
<TE>   You don't win pro championships Dungy's way.</TE>
<TE>   Four Leaders</TE>
<TE>   So the Colts are out of the Super Bowl race -- not mathematically,
maybe, but nonetheless certainly -- though they're equipped with a
coveted quarterback and a record-breaking receiver, Marvin Harrison,
and one of the best running backs, Edgerrin James. So who leads the
Super Bowl fight? Well, nobody.</TE>
<TE>   Who'll be there? That's easier. Going into the last regular-season
week of 2002 -- in a league that's become remarkable for parity --
four teams stand out, if barely.</TE>
<TE>   The NFC will be represented in Super Bowl XXXVII by the Tampa
Bay-Green Bay winner.</TE>
<TE>   The AFC will be there with the Tennessee-Oakland winner.</TE>
<TE>   The parity factor could turn up somebody else, but that's not
likely.</TE>
<TE>   Eagles Favored</TE>
<TE>   Of the NFC's four division champions -- San Francisco,
Philadelphia, Tampa Bay and Green Bay -- no team figures to win the
conference title.</TE>
<TE>   The 49ers don't play well east of San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles, the consensus Las Vegas favorite, alternated three
quarterbacks in winning the NFC East title, but that won't work in
the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers can win at Tampa Bay but not at Green Bay.</TE>
<TE>   The Packers can win at Green Bay but not Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   In the AFC, only one question remains: Will it be battle-tested
Tennessee or Oakland's great passing team?</TE>
<TE>   The two other division champions, Pittsburgh and the team that
wins in the AFC East, don't count.</TE>
<TE>   In a year of intense parity, a wild-card winner could emerge as
champion, but that's not likely.</TE>
<TE>   He's Like Elway</TE>
<TE>   A team that should be there, one would suppose, is Indianapolis
with Manning, Harrison and Dungy's defense. But, all year, Manning
has had to struggle in almost every second half for an absurd reason:</TE>
<TE>   Each week, his coaches spend the first half playing
ultra-conservative offense. They insist on running on first-down
plays, and otherwise take no interesting chances.</TE>
<TE>   Repeatedly this season, Manning has been in a second-half comeback
mode for the same reason that John Elway set so many comeback records
at Denver in the old days:</TE>
<TE>   The first Denver coach Elway had, Dan Reeves, was -- and at
Atlanta remains -- nearly as conservative as Dungy.</TE>
<TE>   There's no way that Elway would be remembered as a great
second-half comeback quarterback if, week in and out, Reeves had let
him play in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   And precisely the same is true of Manning and Dungy at
Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   In last Sunday's game, for example, Dungy fell behind at the half,
10-3, only because of rookie Jeremy Shockey's greatness at tight end
for the New York Giants.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Dungy and Manning were poised to make a typical comeback
until, on the first play of the second half, New York Coach Jim
Fassel shot them down with the NFL's play of the day, an exquisitely
timed flea-flicker pass for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   That's the problem with trying to win with defense alone. There's
no way for a good defensive team to make a successful defense against
a good offense on every play.</TE>
<TE>   At Denver, despite Reeves' satisfactory defensive team, Elway won
the Super Bowl only after he got a passing coach, Mike Shanahan.</TE>
<TE>   Typical Colt Series</TE>
<TE>   Last week's Colt-Giant game will be remembered -- unless the Colts
somehow change direction next month -- as the one that ruined Dungy's
first year at Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't second-half ineptness by Manning that beat the
Colts, for, after the flea-flicker play, the Giants won easily by
simply changing their defensive priorities to stop Manning's passing
instead of James' running.</TE>
<TE>   The game had been lost in the first half by Dungy's incredibly
unimaginative offense, which was characteristic of all Dungy's
first-half offenses.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, after the Colts had recovered a fumble on the New
York six-yard line, they ran on first down, ran it again on second
down, and ran it again on third down -- thereby telling the league,
once more, how a good coach manages to lose with Manning.</TE>
<TE>   On fourth down, they kicked the field goal that they might just as
well have kicked on first down.</TE>
<TE>   Best Matchup</TE>
<TE>   The most entertaining Super Bowl matchup this time might be
Oakland-Tampa Bay. It would pit new Raider Coach Bill Callahan
against last year's Raider coach, Jon Gruden, now at Tampa.</TE>
<TE>   Both men are former college quarterbacks who, in the NFL, came up
in the West Coast offense, the system originated by San Francisco
hall-of-famer Bill Walsh.</TE>
<TE>   As you can see every Sunday, the West Coast is a system in which
the coach can lean in either direction -- either running or passing
on critical downs, particularly first down.</TE>
<TE>   And at Tampa, Gruden leans toward running plays -- as he did last
season at Oakland -- whereas Callahan prefers to throw.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, with mature quarterback Rich Gannon in charge, Callahan's
team this year has, for long stretches of some games, thrown on every
down.</TE>
<TE>   That has given the Raiders the advantage over most opponents this
fall, though against Tampa they would be passing into the NFL's most
skilled defense -- Dungy's old defense -- exactly the one he built in
his time there, with almost exactly the same players.</TE>
<TE>   The question of a Gruden-Callahan Super Bowl would revolve around
pass-play football.</TE>
<TE>   How well would Tampa throw it with Brad Johnson at quarterback but
minus a running-play threat?</TE>
<TE>   How well would Oakland throw it with able short-passer Gannon
focusing on an even quicker release than usual?</TE>
<TE>   Though the Raiders are more experienced -- and experience counts
in Super Bowl competition -- Gruden would be favored.</TE>
<TE>   He's Like Bradshaw</TE>
<TE>   After Atlanta quarterback Michael Vick beat Minnesota on Dec. 1
with a long run to fix his record as an NFL starter at 7-1-1, he was
predictably stopped by Tampa Bay, and then unpredictably stopped by
Seattle before his up-and-down performance last Sunday in a 36-15
victory over Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   That set up one of today's big games: Atlanta (9-5-1) at Cleveland
(8-7) in an interconference headliner with a wild-card coloring.</TE>
<TE>   If Vick is one of the great NFL players of all time, as some
people reckon, why isn't he breezing to, at least, wild-card
recognition?</TE>
<TE>   The best answer is that, most of the time this season, in his
first year as an NFL starter, Vick is showing NFL people what he can
do -- not what he's going to do.</TE>
<TE>   In this respect, he is much like a hall-of-fame quarterback of
yesteryear, Terry Bradshaw, who helped deliver four Super Bowl titles
to Pittsburgh from 1975-80.</TE>
<TE>   It was evident in his first game as an exhibition starter that
Bradshaw was an extremely talented quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Only later did it become known that Bradshaw had been playing on
instincts alone that night, totally disregarding the Steeler game
plan because he didn't know how to follow it.</TE>
<TE>   Even after Bradshaw learned to read a game plan, he didn't settle
in as Pittsburgh's regular-season starter for several years.</TE>
<TE>   This whole season has been like that for Vick. Count on it: He's
the all-time run-pass quarterback even though he can't prove it yet.</TE>
<TE>   Worse luck, it's Vick who now has the conservative coach who once
held back Elway.</TE>
<TE>   He Needs Work</TE>
<TE>   The Rams lost for the first time with quarterback Marc Bulger last
week when two Seattle Seahawks made a Bulger sandwich and put him in
the hospital with a back injury.</TE>
<TE>   The play was a reminder that in the off-season ahead, Bulger needs
the kind of physical work that will strengthen his upper body.</TE>
<TE>   He came into the NFL with a frame that needs another 20 pounds, at
least, on top of his listed 215, if he's to be strong enough for pro
football.</TE>
<TE>   In an ideal world, Bulger would put on at least 15 pounds in the
next 12 months and another 15 pounds a year later.</TE>
<TE>   It's a great irony for Ram Coach Mike Martz that he has created
the league's best two passers on a substructure of frailness.</TE>
<TE>   No. 1 Kurt Warner isn't quite quick enough.</TE>
<TE>   No. 2 Bulger, who looks to be ahead of even Warner as a passer,
isn't quite strong enough.</TE>
<TE>   Seven Guesses</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta to win over Cleveland by five at Browns Stadium. If the
Falcons play this one not to lose, they'll lose.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay to win over Chicago by six on Red Grange's old field at
Champaign. Great cold-weather experience for Buccaneers, in case they
have to visit Green Bay later.</TE>
<TE>   Green Bay over New York Jets by one at East Rutherford, N.J. The
Jets might be starting to fly with Chad Pennington, who, at home,
could beat almost any team but Green Bay this week.</TE>
<TE>   New England over Miami by one at Foxboro. Patriot passer Tom Brady
is short on wide receivers but the Dolphins are short on road wins.</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis over Jacksonville by one at the RCA Dome. Peyton
Manning won't want to lose this one, and the Jaguars might not care.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State over Miami by a touchdown in the Fiesta Bowl. Never
pick against an undefeated Big Ten team in a bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma over Washington State by a touchdown in the Rose Bowl.
One-two in college football this season are USC and Oklahoma.</TE>

<HD>Words May Indeed Hurt Us</HD>
<DH>The harsh language of aggression and risk opens too many
doors to unacceptable behavior.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I've been receiving e-mails in the vein of this one: "Dear Mr.
Balzar. You complain all the time. How about some solutions?"</LD>
<LD>   Fair enough.</LD>
<LD>   And as it happens, I have one.</LD>
<TE>   Our subject is the woeful state of American business and, by
modest extension, the current state of American values.</TE>
<TE>   In this instance, I'll limit myself to that part of the problem in
which I consider myself not just an observer, or a fellow victim, but
a journeyman expert, more or less. That is, the language we use, and
the power that words have to misshape our thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   How do we get things back on track?</TE>
<TE>   Stop glorifying aggression and risk.</TE>
<TE>   We have talked ourselves into deep trouble by assigning false
virtues and granting respect to these two characteristics when it
comes to the pursuit of money.</TE>
<TE>   In most aspects of our lives, aggression is cause for dread, and
for understandable reasons. We don't want it in our children, in our
pet dogs, in rattlesnakes under the porch, in our encounters with
strangers and in our dealings with citizens of nations around the
world.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, risk.</TE>
<TE>   In our travels, at the lunch counter, in parking lots at night, we
strive to minimize, or at least control, risk. We wear seat belts. We
limit our fat intake. We park near light poles. Our good lives depend
on it.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere along the line, business was granted an exemption from
this norm.</TE>
<TE>   I suspect it began in modern times with that strangest of
businesses, big-money athletics.</TE>
<TE>   At first, aggression was used interchangeably and harmlessly with
hustle. But then it left hustle behind and came to signify real
aggression.</TE>
<TE>   We supplemented and embellished aggression with other words that
normally are meant as criticism but no longer are so in the
free-market context, like intimidation.</TE>
<TE>   Risk was once a synonym for daring and innovation. Then it too
came to signify far more: risking everything to win.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't enough to prosper. You had to dominate. In electricity
purveyance, as in football, our language now drips with metaphors of
anger, hostility and war.</TE>
<TE>   The characteristics that we wouldn't want in a neighbor are what
we expect in commerce. You have to annihilate the opponent.</TE>
<TE>   Business plans pay vague lip service to the interest of customers,
but the hearts of many -- the most aggressive and risky ones -- seek
to seize control of the market and, ultimately, hold the customer
captive. As in the case of Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, I'm mindful that American entrepreneurship has always
attracted the cutthroat, and often brought out the worst in them.
Gilded Age railroad tycoon Collis Huntington remarked: "Whatever is
not nailed down is mine. Whatever I can pry loose is not nailed
down."</TE>
<TE>   But in our better moments -- and isn't that the point of progress,
better moments? -- the vocabulary of business, and not incidentally
athletics, also allowed glory for finesse, for grace, for integrity.
How you won was important too.</TE>
<TE>   You don't have to stand back very far to see that among the
bubbles that sorely need popping in our free-enterprise system is the
language of aggressiveness.</TE>
<TE>   One way to achieve that is to restore stigma to a couple of words
that richly deserve it. An aggressive accountant should be regarded
with the same intolerance as an aggressive third-grader.</TE>
<TE>   We need less risk too. We can still have plenty of fun with
capitalism without putting everybody's job on the line in the next
go-for-broke, deregulatory market IPO merger scheme.</TE>
<TE>   Unchaining human enterprise and creativity need not also deprive
us of those qualities that give us dignity.</TE>
<TE>   Need we note, again, that the brunt of the losses on these
aggressive, risky deals has been borne by workers and investors, not
those who roll the dice or set the policies?</TE>
<TE>   Folks who sing from hymnals of risk and aggression should not be
admired but cross-examined.</TE>
<TE>   But, you say, globalism requires that we devour the world or the
world will devour us. In that case, globalism will impoverish
everyone.</TE>
<TE>   If unrestrained trade is just another way to unleash our
aggressiveness, another form of war instead of a process to advance
civilization, then we are overdue for a peace conference.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty years back, a chic book on the reading lists in business
schools was Sun Tzu's "The Art of War." Written more than 2,000 years
ago, this was the first known collection of aphorisms about the
precepts and theories of getting ahead of the competition.</TE>
<TE>   Sun Tzu's students have assumed leadership in our corporations. It
might be a good time for them to revisit this classic study. In
particular, Item 6 in Chapter 2, which states: "There has never been
a protracted war from which a country has benefited.... War is like
unto fire; those who will not put aside weapons are themselves
consumed by them."</TE>

<LD>Clarence Thomas spoke!</LD>
<LD>   The avalanche of media coverage afforded to Justice Thomas' recent
remarks in a cross-burning case before the Supreme Court demonstrates
once again that Thomas fascinates the American people as few justices
ever have.</LD>
<LD>   Sadly, though, almost all of the coverage focused not on the
substance of Thomas' remarks but on the fact that he said anything at
all.</LD>
<TE>   It's true that Thomas doesn't ask as many questions as the other
justices do, but neither did Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., who is widely
regarded as the most influential thinker in the history of American
law. When Thomas has a question, he asks it. When he doesn't, he
believes that the lawyers should be allowed to argue their cases
without being constantly interrupted.</TE>
<TE>   More important, Thomas does say a lot, mostly in his written
opinions. It's not unreasonable to suggest that he is the most
significant member of the current court, especially on matters of
race. Virginia vs. Black, the cross-burning case that sparked the
latest debate about his views, is only the most recent example of
this.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas has been shaping the debate on race since the early 1980s,
when he was chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
It was during his tenure that the EEOC shifted away from a
group-based approach to civil rights enforcement to an
individual-based approach. It was, of course, Thomas' rejection of
group-based relief in civil rights cases that led civil rights groups
to oppose his confirmation to the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Since becoming a justice, Thomas has continued to speak out on
questions of race. He has written powerful opinions on desegregation,
voting rights and affirmative action. In 1995's Missouri vs. Jenkins,
for example, Thomas became the first justice to directly criticize
Brown vs. Board of Education. He said the court was wrong in 1954 to
rely on disputable social evidence to declare segregation
unconstitutional rather than invoking the "constitutional principle"
that "the government must treat citizens as individuals and not as
members of racial, ethnic or religious groups."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas' conception of civil rights as an individual concern, not a
group concern, also explains his approach to voting rights. In 1994,
in Holder vs. Hall, Thomas wrote that racial groups shouldn't "be
conceived of largely as political interest groups," that blacks don't
all think alike and that existing case law should be overturned to
eliminate claims for "proportional allocation of political power
according to race."</TE>
<TE>   And in 1995's Adarand Constructors vs. Pena, Thomas characterized
affirmative action programs as being "at war with the principle of
inherent equality that underlies and infuses our Constitution." He
added that "so-called 'benign' discrimination teaches many that
because of chronic and apparently immutable handicaps, minorities
cannot compete with them without their patronizing indulgence."</TE>
<TE>   Not since Thurgood Marshall, the first African American appointed
to the Supreme Court and the justice whom Thomas replaced, has an
African American public official spoken out so forcefully on matters
of race. Both men were subjected to racism during their lives, and
both men were shaped by the experience.</TE>
<TE>   In Thomas' case, his body of work provides a strong philosophical
statement: Civil rights belong to each American, no matter his or her
race, not to the aggregate members of one race or group.</TE>

<LD>Proposals have been circulating for years to split California into
two separate states. These proposals are misguided.</LD>
<LD>   In truth, it is time for California to become a member of the
European Union.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this month, after difficult negotiations, an agreement was
reached to eventually add 10 new members to the European Union,
making it the largest confederation of national bodies ever, with
more than 450 million people. The addition of California would be far
smoother and less costly -- indeed, economically, California would
bring tremendous advantages to the EU.</LD>
<TE>   As an independent nation, we would be the fifth-largest economy in
the world, and our addition would help stabilize the European
currency, the euro. More open access to industrial and agricultural
markets would bring lower costs for trading goods and services to all
parties.</TE>
<TE>   California is far more politically and culturally similar to
members of the EU than to many other parts of the U.S. We have a
diverse, multilingual population, with strong universities and
educational institutions. Many visitors have noted that San Francisco
is the most European of American cities, and the state has a classic
Mediterranean climate. European wines are almost as good as ours,
especially some French wines. Like most governments in the EU,
California has acknowledged that global climate change is a real
problem -- something the U.S. government has failed to do. And the
position of most members of the EU on medical marijuana is similar to
that of California.</TE>
<TE>   What do we have to offer the EU? Our national parks and wilderness
areas are unmatched anywhere and are already heavily visited by
European tourists. Our environmental standards can serve as a model
for improvements elsewhere. No other EU member can offer major ports
on the Pacific Ocean or as vibrant an agricultural community. Film
critics have been complaining that Hollywood movies are too
"American" -- now they would be "European."</TE>
<TE>   Open markets would ease access to European goods for more than 35
million relatively wealthy California consumers as well as improving
access for Europeans to our own markets.</TE>
<TE>   There would, of course, be practical difficulties, but these can
be worked out. The U.S. government would have to build new military
facilities in other Pacific Coast states and set up customs stations
along our new borders with Nevada and Oregon. To keep the same number
of stars on the flag and the same number of senators, statehood would
have to be offered to Puerto Rico, Guam or Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   We'd have to start calling soccer "football" and football
"American football," though the World Series would become truly
international (no offense to the Blue Jays and Expos).</TE>
<TE>   No doubt reaction to this proposal would be mixed in the U.S.
After all, we send far more money to Washington than we get back in
federal funding and services -- and the loss of this revenue would
further exacerbate the ballooning federal deficits.</TE>
<TE>   Some policymakers may balk at the thought of losing so many
citizens and resources. But others may look upon this change
favorably.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican Party would lose an annoying thorn in their
political side. For millions of Americans, the ease of taking a
European vacation without having to fly across the Atlantic would be
a big plus. And frankly, plenty of Americans already think of
California as a foreign country. Let's make it a reality.</TE>

<HD>Smallpox Vaccine Policy Is Bad Science</HD>
<DH>Any support the administration has won is based on a
misleading premise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Linda Rosenstock</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It may come as a surprise to some that we don't make health policy in
this country based on portentous warnings from behind closed doors.
There is actually a science to calculating risk. Making such sweeping
decisions as President Bush has done on smallpox vaccination --
keeping the public and experts in the dark -- is simply indefensible.</LD>
<LD>   The limited support of medical and public health professional
organizations for the vaccination campaign may lead people to
surmise, incorrectly, that the mainstream of expert opinion is behind
the president.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, public health experts involved in consultation on the
recommendation, or those like me observing from outside the federal
decision-making apparatus, might have come to a wholly different
conclusion had the starting premise been a different one than "assume
there is a credible and small but finite risk of near-term
intentional exposure." In other words: "You health experts design a
plan based on information we may or may not have but cannot share
with you."</LD>
<TE>   This potentially false starting premise -- and the implication
that the risk now is sufficiently greater than it was before the
Sept. 11 attacks to warrant a wholesale new approach to one of many
potential biological hazards -- takes on a life of its own.</TE>
<TE>   Each state is mandated to design its smallpox vaccination
strategy.</TE>
<TE>   The debate at the national level shifts from whether anyone should
be vaccinated to who among those most "at risk" should be vaccinated
and in what order.</TE>
<TE>   Which part of the military? Which medical and emergency response
personnel? And once on this slippery slope, the truly extraordinary
recommendation emerges that all civilians be given the option to be
vaccinated.</TE>
<TE>   This particular recommendation reverses established public health
policy that once a clear public benefit exists, taking into account
known risk -- as with routine childhood immunizations -- then the
goal is universal coverage.</TE>
<TE>   And we learn from Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G.
Thompson that the smallpox vaccine will be provided to everyone free.</TE>
<TE>   Would that the administration provide vaccines of known value such
as for measles, mumps and rubella to the population at no cost. But
that is a different discussion.</TE>
<TE>   So is there anything prudent we can do to prepare for possible
germ warfare? Of course there is. First, the public deserves a clear
explanation from the administration about the evidence of a threat.</TE>
<TE>   We deserve to know what they know.</TE>
<TE>   If the risk is dramatically close to zero, as many of us in the
health field believe, then a prudent course would be to continue as
we are doing: working rapidly to manufacture a safer vaccine than now
exists, to be available when and if the risk determination changes.</TE>
<TE>   This is a credible course given the knowledge that smallpox does
not spread as rapidly as many other infectious agents and there is a
window of reasonable time (probably four days) when post-exposure
vaccination is still effective.</TE>
<TE>   If a credible, finite risk, even if small, can be convincingly
established, then there will be honest disagreement among scientists
and experts about the next best steps.</TE>
<TE>   The debate will hinge on when to begin a vaccination campaign,
before or after a documented case. And then the discussion, if we
choose to proceed with pre-exposure vaccination, will rightly hinge
on who should be vaccinated.</TE>
<TE>   For now, we have not been provided with convincing evidence that
any American should be.</TE>

<HD>Malnutrition Takes a Toll on Argentina</HD>
<DH>Rising food prices and unemployment from a 4-year recession
spread hunger across land known for beef, grain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mayra Pertossi</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>GARUPA, Argentina</DL>
<LD>Her dark, sunken eyes stare at the steam wafting from a pot of beans
and noodles. For Fabiana Casapava, 12, the watery gruel will be her
only meal of the day.</LD>
<LD>   Fabiana and her six siblings have been coming to a community soup
kitchen for their daily sustenance the last two years.</LD>
<LD>   Set in the sweltering Misiones province, her town of Garupa, 685
dusty miles northeast of Buenos Aires, is home to 32,000 people, most
of whom are struggling to make ends meet.</LD>
<TE>   Scrawny and underweight, Fabiana complains often of being hungry.
It's an ugly reflection of the times in a once-wealthy South American
country crippled by a four-year recession.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina prides itself as being one of the world's great food
baskets, but rising food prices and unemployment caused by the
protracted slump have spread hunger across a country famous for
fork-tender beef and unending fields of grain.</TE>
<TE>   The fiery red soil and verdant jungle around Garupa, in
Argentina's remote northeast corner, make for fertile tea and tobacco
plantations -- but little else. Even those fields stand barren,
victims of the economic turmoil. About 65% of the town's people live
in poverty and 70% of the children are undernourished.</TE>
<TE>   Fabiana's parents are unemployed; she rarely eats at home.</TE>
<TE>   "In the morning, I drink milk at school. But when there are no
classes, I have no breakfast," she says. "At home, sometimes we eat
dinner, and other times nothing, or just tea and bread."</TE>
<TE>   Children are dying or falling ill from hunger not only in Misiones
and the traditionally poorer north but also in some of Argentina's
richest provinces, such as the industrial region around Buenos Aires,
the capital.</TE>
<TE>   Ulises Soto, a physician who provides medical assistance for those
who come to Garupa's soup kitchen, says malnutrition has become all
too common. "You are out walking on the street and see children who
are obviously malnourished. Their stomachs are bloated, their legs
frail ... their eyes sunken." Many parents are unemployed, the
families barely scraping by on handouts and odd jobs. Houses are no
more than huts built of wood, straw and canvas. As many as 14 people
in an extended family can be found crowded into a single dwelling.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad works but he doesn't make enough to provide for us, so
sometimes there is no food," says Maria Rosa Barrios, 8, as she
eagerly downs bread and jam at the soup kitchen. She has walked 50
blocks from home for her only meal of the day.</TE>
<TE>   Although the government keeps no statistics on hunger, a study led
by the University of Buenos Aires and the Society of Pediatricians
estimates the nation of 37 million people is seeing an average of 27
children under 5 die daily from causes related to malnourishment.</TE>
<TE>   Many more are at risk, like Gustavo, 18 months. He weighs 13
pounds, far below average for a child his age. Oblivious to his
mother's efforts to console him, the hungry infant sobs in the
waiting room of the only hospital in Obera, about 75 miles east of
Garupa. "To see your child like this makes you desperate," says the
mother, Fabiana Bianchi. "Each day Gustavo was getting worse, to the
point he was only skin and bones."</TE>

<HD>Angry Women Dry Out Towns, Husbands</HD>
<DH>Villages in remote Mexican coffee-growing area ban liquor
sales to stop men from coming home drunk. Wives even rout beer
trucks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Julie Watson</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN RAFAEL TAMPAXAL, Mexico</DL>
<LD>As the Corona beer truck with its clinking bottles lumbered into this
Indian village in the mountains of central Mexico, angry women ran
out of their homes shouting: "Get out! Get out!"</LD>
<LD>   The women, many carrying babies in colorful shawls, forced the
driver back down the mountain before he could unload a single bottle
-- much to the chagrin of their husbands.</LD>
<LD>   Fed up with their men stumbling home drunk or falling over in a
stupor in their cornfields, the women of this remote Indian village
in San Luis Potosi state took matters into their own hands, refusing
to allow any more alcohol to be sold in their community of 250
people.</LD>
<TE>   Huasteco women -- whose customs don't allow them to own land
unless they are widowed or orphaned -- traditionally don't drink
alcohol and rarely hold positions of power.</TE>
<TE>   The women's defiance has spread like wildfire through these lush
mountains. Since their bold stand more than a year ago, women in at
least 10 Huasteco villages have persuaded their leaders to ban
alcohol, and another dozen communities are considering it.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of men are not happy with this," said Marcelina Martinez,
who helped turn back the truck from San Rafael. "They seem sad. But,
oh well, at least now they spend time with their families, so in the
end, things are better. They didn't want to listen to us, so we had
to get angry."</TE>
<TE>   Over the past decade, Huasteco women have taken on a greater role
in their communities as more men leave to find work, often in the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   Many women now manage the family budget -- something that may have
led to the alcohol bans, some say. The region relies heavily on
coffee, and growers are earning much less amid plummeting world
prices.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, if a man arrived home drunk, his kids could run over and
find something in his bag. But now, the little bit that men make,
they spend on drinking, and it's affecting the children," said Sabas
Estrada, whose village, Santa Rita, down the mountain from San
Rafael, is considering banning alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   Women say they also found support from the region's new
government. President Vicente Fox's National Action Party took power
in the Huastecos' most populous municipality, Aquismon, two years ago
and has cracked down on moonshine.</TE>
<TE>   The cane-based liquor, known as aguardiente or yuco, flows like
the rivers through the mountains, surrounded by sugarcane fields. A
popular Huasteco song proclaims aguardiente the best liquor because
all get drunk -- including the mayor and even the governor.</TE>
<TE>   National Action authorities have set up roadside checkpoints and
raids on illegal distilleries. One week, officials nabbed 2,900
gallons of bootleg.</TE>
<TE>   "Moonshine sellers around here are as powerful a mafia as drug
traffickers," said Raul Hernandez, the alcohol inspector of Aquismon.
"There are hundreds making it in their villages, in their homes, in
outhouses, even in caves."</TE>
<TE>   Liquor is an integral part of Indian ceremonies. Like many tribes,
Huastecos pour alcohol on the ground as an offering to Mother Earth
before planting. At festivals for each village's patron saint, men
dance to the traditional music of violins and guitars, then drink
until dawn.</TE>
<TE>   Women rarely drink, even at festivals, but they recognize alcohol
as an important part of their traditions. Because of that, most dry
towns lift their bans during celebrations. Some even allow families
to serve liquor at birthday parties and weddings.</TE>
<TE>   But inspectors acknowledge that such allowances have complicated
attempts to control use.</TE>
<TE>   "When we go to their homes and find beer, they always say, 'Well,
it's for a birthday party.' But I say, 'You can't be having a
birthday every day,' " said Isidoro Hernandez, Las Armas village
commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   Not all agree with the bans.</TE>
<TE>   "Alcohol has its positive aspects. For one, it's the only drug
that the government has legalized," said Ruben Hernandez, a San
Rafael schoolteacher. "But now a campesino can lose his liter by
being pulled over on the road. If they want to combat alcoholism,
they should fight it at its roots and close down the factories. But
they pay a lot of taxes, so nobody will touch them."</TE>
<TE>   Still, women say their bans have made a difference. As darkness
fell over San Rafael, young men sat on the main plaza, chatting and
chugging Coca-Colas.</TE>
<TE>   "My husband now is home early instead of stumbling in at 2 a.m. or
falling over drunk on the floor in the local store, where I used to
find him," Martinez said. "The beer truck still passes by, but it
never stops here. I think the driver is scared of us."</TE>

<HD>Morocco Wants Children Out of Workshops and Into School</HD>
<DH>Many are from families that migrate to the city to earn
money. Some are as young as 7, paid about $6 for a six-day week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eileen Byrne</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>FEZ, Morocco</DL>
<LD>A group of tourists wanders through narrow streets, marveling at the
age-old production techniques of the craftsmen.</LD>
<LD>   But a few steps off the beaten track, in hole-in-the-wall
workshops and ramshackle basements, adolescents and children work
with urgency and concentration. In these under-regulated workshops,
you either keep up the pace or go hungry.</LD>
<LD>   Many young workers are from families that have migrated to the
city, fleeing lower incomes in the countryside. Some are as young as
7, earning around $6 for a six-day week.</LD>
<TE>   These youngsters have been targeted in a drive by the United
Nations children's agency UNICEF and Moroccan authorities to persuade
artisans to stop hiring children under 12 and release those already
employed for a few hours of schooling each week.</TE>
<TE>   Officials also attempt to win over the hearts and minds of
parents, visiting them at home.</TE>
<TE>   Under legislation passed in 2000, all Moroccan children under 15
should be in school. In 1993, Morocco ratified the U.N. Convention on
the Rights of the Child, which says children should be protected from
economic exploitation.</TE>
<TE>   But there are no plans at present for a strict clampdown on child
labor.</TE>
<TE>   Officials justified this approach by pointing to the harsh
realities of a country of 30 million in which 20% of the population
lives in extreme poverty.</TE>
<TE>   "We remind the artisans of the terms of the U.N. convention," said
Laamoumri El Ghali, an official with the Handicrafts Ministry in Fez.
"But if we strictly enforced the law, many workshops would have to
close and we would have a lot of unemployed artisans."</TE>
<TE>   Families dependent on child labor, it is argued, would fall into
extreme poverty if it were abolished overnight.</TE>
<TE>   In a dilapidated stone building, two men were using improvised
welding equipment to make traditional copper teapots.</TE>
<TE>   El Ghali was the first official to visit, they told him. In
response to his query about accidents, a boy in an orange T-shirt was
fetched from next door. He pulled up his shirt to reveal burn tissue
covering most of his chest and stomach.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, a leak from a gas canister flared up as he was
lighting a gas ring. The scar tissue still gives him trouble. El
Ghali noted down his details -- Badr El Mbarek, age 15, burned.</TE>
<TE>   Metalworking is the most hazardous field, followed by jewelry and
mosaic-making, because of the chemicals used. Children working with
slipper-makers are exposed to vapors from the glue, and dust causes
respiratory problems for those working in the pottery sheds.</TE>
<TE>   Actors from a nongovernmental organization are being used in the
workplace to press home the problems of using child labor.</TE>
<TE>   In one scene performed before a group of artisans employing
children, a hard-pressed mother begged a craftsman to take on her
young son as an apprentice: "Just teach him the trade," she implored.
"You needn't pay him."</TE>
<TE>   There was embarrassed laughter from the audience. They recognized
the emotional blackmail of the mother, who a few weeks later would
demand payment for her child's labor.</TE>
<TE>   A reference to the effects of chemicals used in mosaic-making drew
sheepish laughter. "Your eyes are as red as traffic lights!" the
mother scolded the boy later. "Don't tell me you have started smoking
hashish!"</TE>
<TE>   The message was that child labor may be cheap and endorsed by
social attitudes, but it harms the child.</TE>
<TE>   Rached Sibaoueih, 35, a carpenter in Marrakesh, said some parents
still liked to place their child with an artisan over the school
holidays.</TE>
<TE>   "They prefer him to learn a skill than to hang around the streets
picking up bad habits," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Another carpenter, Mustapha K., said he would take his own son out
of school to learn the trade when he reaches 12.</TE>
<TE>   "I know boys who studied until they were 22 only to find
themselves unemployed now, being supported by brothers or cousins who
are artisans," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Through the 1970s and '80s, child labor was a taboo topic in
Morocco, says social anthropologist Chekib Guessous, author of a new
book on the subject.</TE>
<TE>   It was linked to the politically sensitive question of educational
provision. Poorer families used to regard schooling as of little use
in the real world.</TE>
<TE>   But attitudes are changing.</TE>
<TE>   Mokhsin, 8, who has worked in a Fez pottery shop since his father
and brothers lost their jobs, said: "When I go home, my friends who
go to school say working is good for nothing. They make me cry. If I
don't study, it's as if I don't exist."</TE>
<TE>   Just 234 of the thousands of children working in the Fez craft
sector were enrolled this year in the classes coordinated by UNICEF.</TE>
<TE>   Attendance is sometimes patchy, with employers pleading full
order-books. When they do turn up for classes, some of the children
are too exhausted to concentrate.</TE>
<TE>   There has been little pressure from political parties, trade
unions or wider public opinion for any stricter stance on child
labor.</TE>
<TE>   A rare press comment Nov. 1 called for those employing children to
be penalized.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time to move on to action," wrote the Fez correspondent of
Aujourd'hui le Maroc newspaper, noting that neither awareness-raising
days nor official measures had stopped the exploitation.</TE>

<HD>French Foreign Legion Draws Line in Ivory Coast</HD>
<DH>Elite troops tried to enforce a cease fire. But when
fighting resumed, France sided with the government, becoming a force
in its former African colonial empire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Clar Ni Chonghaile</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>DUEKOUE, Ivory Coast</DL>
<LD>French Foreign Legion soldiers crouch behind logs and sandbags,
training their anti-tank missiles, rocket launchers and heavy machine
guns west -- into rebel territory.</LD>
<LD>   Nearby is Ivory Coast's Sassandra River: Rebels hoping to advance
on the skyscraper-lined commercial capital, Abidjan, must first make
it across this silvery, natural barrier.</LD>
<LD>   The French forces are determined to make sure that doesn't happen.</LD>
<TE>   With hundreds of troops here and more on the way, France's
intervention in the swiftly growing Ivory Coast war marks its biggest
role in years in its former African colonial empire.</TE>
<TE>   French troops this fall took the back-seat role of enforcing a
cease-fire but stepped up their involvement when fighting between
rebels and government forces resumed with greater force.</TE>
<TE>   Ivorian rebels, who demand the president's resignation and new
elections, are emboldened by their success in recent weeks in the
west, capped by their seizure of the strategic city of Man.</TE>
<TE>   Now, rebels in the west say they want to capture Abidjan -- and
control the nation -- something that West African leaders and others
eager to preserve stability in the region hope to prevent.</TE>
<TE>   Ivory Coast's own forces retreated when rebels took Man, a main
western city with 135,000 residents.</TE>
<TE>   And as the dusty convoys of weary government troops pulled out,
the Foreign Legion moved in. Piling up bunkers, they set up a
checkpoint 55 miles south of the fallen city.</TE>
<TE>   "Between what we have here, and the river, they will not pass,"
vowed Col. Emmanuel Maurin, commander of the French in the west.</TE>
<TE>   Potentially, the French will make the difference in resolving the
war in Ivory Coast, despite having sworn off their role as the
policeman of Africa in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin ushered in what was
called the "ni-ni" -- or neither-neither -- policy for Africa:
neither indifference, nor interference. He also made cuts to
streamline the armed forces.</TE>
<TE>   As coups and coup attempts roiled countries from the Central
African Republic to the sands of Niger, France did nothing, a
remarkable inaction after so many decades of French colonial rule in
West Africa.</TE>
<TE>   This time, France says, the stakes are too high.</TE>
<TE>   Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, had been West
Africa's most prosperous and stable nation, a firm friend of France
and an important trading partner. About 20,000 French nationals live
here, many reluctant to leave even now.</TE>
<TE>   French leaders say their intervention has already prevented a
blood bath.</TE>
<TE>   "The threat to the entire region posed by the crisis in Ivory
Coast calls for a collective mobilization," French Foreign Minister
Dominique de Villepin told the French daily Le Monde.</TE>
<TE>   Ivory Coast's rebels took up arms Sept. 19, accusing President
Laurent Gbagbo's southern-based administration of persecution of
northerners. Rebels quickly took the northern half of the country.
Ivory Coast -- its own army ranks depleted by defections to the rebel
side -- brought in mercenaries and pleaded for help.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, new rebel factions have emerged in the west, including
Liberian fighters notorious for raping and pillaging.</TE>
<TE>   France sent 1,000 troops in the first weeks of the crisis to try
to restore a truce and is now doubling its involvement with a force
expected to reach 2,500 by the end of this month.</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of that deployment is the Foreign Legion, the
hired army famous for giving refuge to people who are at the end of
their options -- adventure-seekers, convicts, star-crossed lovers,
and others wanting to leave their old lives and real names behind.</TE>
<TE>   In Ivory Coast, the mix includes Portuguese, Germans, French,
English, and a host of other accents and nationalities. Many have
seen action on the continent before.</TE>
<TE>   Their official mission: to preserve stability, enforce the
cease-fire and prevent abuses by either side. Maurin says the troops
will use persuasion, dissuasion and intimidation before resorting to
their impressive array of arms.</TE>
<TE>   On the ground, the Legionnaires are in constant contact with
rebels and loyalists. Relations seem good, although they can turn
testy -- and fast.</TE>
<TE>   A gun battle erupted Nov. 30 between French troops and western
rebels, the more unrestrained of the two rebel blocs, killing 10
rebels and injuring a French soldier.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, farmers in central Ivory Coast flagged down
Legionnaires to disarm a grenade found in a field. Government troops
watched as the French detonated it, then gave the Legionnaires
thumbs-up and vigorous handshakes.</TE>
<TE>   It was a different scene up the road in the rebel-held town of
Vavoua. Legionnaires met rebel leader Zacharia Kone, who was angry
over France's intervention.</TE>
<TE>   Tensions eased after 15 minutes of to-and-fro between the French
and the rebel leader, but Kone urged the French to withdraw.</TE>
<TE>   "If the French were to leave today," the rebel said, "in three
days, we would be in Abidjan."</TE>

<HD>N. Korea Orders Ouster of Nuclear Inspectors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Shin</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>North Korea ordered the expulsion Friday of U.N. nuclear inspectors
and announced it will reactivate a lab able to produce weapons-grade
plutonium. The U.N. nuclear agency said its investigators were
"staying put" for now.</LD>
<LD>   The White House denounced Pyongyang's moves, and U.S. officials
said an envoy -- perhaps Asst. Secretary of State James Kelly --
would likely be sent to the region next month to confer with allies.</LD>
<LD>   The North Korean move heightened tensions over its plan to
unfreeze nuclear facilities shut down since 1994. The inspectors were
the last means that the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA,
had to monitor whether the nuclear complex at Yongbyon is being used
for weapons projects.</LD>
<TE>   Despite IAEA warnings, the North removed monitoring seals and
surveillance cameras from complex earlier in the week.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to IAEA head Mohammed Baradei on Friday, North Korea
demanded the inspectors leave "immediately" and announced its
intention to reopen the reprocessing lab.</TE>
<TE>   Pyongyang said in the letter that it had decided to reactivate the
Yongbyon complex after the United States canceled a shipment of fuel
oil promised in a 1994 agreement that froze the facilities -- and
because President Bush labeled the North part of the "axis of evil."</TE>
<TE>   The letter, a copy of which was obtained by the Associated Press,
also accused the U.S. of making the North "the target for the nuclear
preemptive strike."</TE>
<TE>   North Korea contends that it is restarting the reactor to generate
badly needed electricity after the United States and its allies cut
off oil shipments. The shipments were halted after recent revelations
that the North Koreans had been covertly developing nuclear weapons
in violation of the 1994 agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the rising tension, the U.S.-U.N. Command said Friday that
the North had violated the armistice that ended the Korean War by
bringing machine guns into the buffer zone separating the two Koreas
six times in the last two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The command said that in each instance, the North Korean troops
removed the weapons from the Demilitarized Zone at the end of each
day. Under the 1953 armistice, only rifles and other small arms are
permitted.</TE>
<TE>   In Crawford, Texas, President Bush's spokesman denounced the
demand for the inspectors' removal and called on Pyongyang to shut
down its nuclear weapons program.</TE>
<TE>   In Vienna, IAEA spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said that "at the
moment, our inspectors are staying put. They are on standby." The
U.N. nuclear watchdog currently has three inspectors in North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Baradei sent a response to North Korea's atomic energy chief, Ri
Je Son, demanding the North allow the inspectors to remain and
install new seals and surveillance cameras at the site.</TE>
<TE>   "The departure of inspectors would practically bring an end to our
ability to monitor [North Korea's] nuclear program or assess its
nature. This is one further step away from defusing the crisis,"
Baradei said.</TE>
<TE>   Pyongyang said it was reopening the reprocessing lab to give "safe
storage" to spent fuel rods that will come from the reactor it plans
to restart. The IAEA did not comment on the report on the lab.</TE>
<TE>   The lab can be used to extract weapons-grade plutonium from spent
fuel rods. North Korea already has 8,000 spent fuel rods in storage
that experts say could yield four or five nuclear weapons within
months. The KCNA statement, monitored by South Korea's Yonhap news
agency, made no mention of those stockpiled rods.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the IAEA said the North was moving fresh fuel rods into
the 5-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon. By Friday, about 2,000 new rods
had been moved to a storage facility at the site, up from 1,000 a day
earlier, spokeswoman Fleming said.</TE>
<TE>   The reactor needs 8,000 rods to be started, Fleming said.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea said it was sending special envoys to Russia and China
"at the earliest possible date" to seek help in resolving the
dispute.</TE>
<TE>   "We consider all possibilities but for now our focus is on
dissuading the North from restarting the radiochemical lab," said a
senior Foreign Ministry official who requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea, the official said, is pushing to hold a three-way
meeting with the United States and Japan early next year.</TE>

<HD>Hard Times Put the Squeeze on Sleaze Industry in Japan</HD>
<DH>Record unemployment and soaring bankruptcies have forced
more women into the sex trade. A variety of facilities exist.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hans Greimel</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Rika returns from an "assisted bath" with the day's first customer.
The humid air hangs heavy with the sweet smell of soap, and she
listlessly leafs through fashion magazines in a packed back room with
other young prostitutes.</LD>
<LD>   "If I get five customers, that's a good day," she said, flashing a
confident smile from beneath a dyed-red bob that matches her
checkered sundress.</LD>
<LD>   For the past month, this has been Rika's new job -- selling sex at
a top-class "soapland" brothel in Tokyo's Yoshiwara red-light
district, a grid of quiet streets immortalized in centuries-old
woodblock prints of kimono-clad courtesans.</LD>
<TE>   Smut has been a near recession-proof industry in Japan, despite
the country's decade of economic slump. All told, the Japanese spend
an estimated $13.9 billion a year on sex.</TE>
<TE>   But hard times are putting the squeeze on the sleaze.</TE>
<TE>   Given Japan's sour economy, Rika, 25, calls soapland "a move up"
from her old job waiting tables. She sometimes pockets $8,200 a
month. It pays for her $1,500 shopping binges and gets her closer to
her dream of retiring at age 30 with her own house.</TE>
<TE>   But for other women, Japan's red-light underworld is a last
resort, not an opportunity. Record unemployment and soaring
bankruptcies are forcing more women into the flesh trade -- at
cheaper rates and in more desperate conditions.</TE>
<TE>   For Hitomi, 24, a streetwalker from Thailand, it's about survival,
not spending sprees.</TE>
<TE>   She was laid off from a refrigerator factory, stripped of her work
visa and company housing. Now, a good night for her means recouping
the $65 in protection money she shells out to gangsters on her street
-- and not having to work until dawn.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The pricey soaplands, where hourly rates reach $820, are giving
way to low-end "pink salons" and cut-rate foreign prostitutes. Cheap
thrills there go for as little as $65.</TE>
<TE>   The number of soaplands has declined to around 1,200 from about
1,700 in the booming 1980s, said Takashi Kadokura, an economist at
Dai-Ichi Life Insurance who published a two-year study of the
underground economy earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the nation's 1,800 fly-by-night sex shops, where
customer turnover may be as fast as eight minutes, have seen revenues
jump 50% to $5 billion since then. Kadokura, giving an admittedly
rough figure, estimates that the average shop gets 32,800 visits a
year.</TE>
<TE>   Increased competition has sex clubs resorting to wilder antics,
younger women and lower prices.</TE>
<TE>   Phone that call-girl flier in the mailbox and you're likely to get
a housewife working part-time. An estimated 5% of girls in Tokyo's
middle and high schools have turned tricks to buy the latest
fashions, which are pricier but still viewed as necessities.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Japan outlawed brothels in 1956 after centuries of sanctioned
sex-selling in glamorized "licensed zones" like Yoshiwara. But there
are loopholes.</TE>
<TE>   Train stations are surrounded by "pink salons" promising sexual
massage and "telephone clubs" where men line up liaisons with
teen-age girls. Convenience stores stock brothel guides as thick as
telephone books. Household mailboxes are stuffed with "delivery
health" ads emblazoned with color photos of lusty schoolgirls.</TE>
<TE>   Surveys by anti-prostitution groups suggest that up to 40% of
Japanese men have paid for sex at least once. But last year, there
were only 1,032 arrests.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those were pimps because Japanese law targets sex brokers
rather than prostitutes or customers, said Takeshi Koyanagi, deputy
director of the Justice Ministry's research department. "It's very
hard to prosecute," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Soaplands duck the law by billing themselves as assisted
bathhouses. The tacit understanding is that whatever else happens
inside is a matter between consenting adults.</TE>
<TE>   A little more than 100 years ago, Rika's predecessors in the
"Nightless City" were prisoners displayed behind barred windows, with
little hope of buying freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the moats are paved over and Yoshiwara isn't even marked on
most city maps. The workers get a week off every month and regular
health checkups, plus enough cash for regular trips to Tokyo's glitzy
Ginza shopping district.</TE>
<TE>   But soaplands -- even in bastions like Yoshiwara -- are vanishing
like the geisha.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nothing symbolizes Yoshiwara's seedy flip side more than Tokyo's
Kabukicho district, where women like Hitomi prowl the frenetic,
neon-bathed alleys.</TE>
<TE>   Prostitution has always exposed women to disease, violence and
extortion. But activists say Japan's bad economy makes women more
willing to risk low-end work.</TE>
<TE>   Women at soaplands can hit a panic button and alert a tuxedo-clad
bouncer to trouble. But on the street or in a gangster-run massage
parlor, there are no such safeguards.</TE>
<TE>   Conditions are especially bad for the estimated 12,000 foreign sex
workers like Hitomi, said Yayori Matsui, director of the Tokyo-based
Asia-Japan Women's Resource Center.</TE>
<TE>   Many of them were trafficked into the country and indentured by
debt. The economic slump means that it takes them up to a year to buy
back their freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Matsui says it's an uphill battle, in part because of changing
mores.</TE>
<TE>   "There is also a growing point of view that it is a woman's right
to engage in prostitution," she said. "I feel helpless against this
trend."</TE>
<TE>   Like many foreign workers, Hitomi was lured to Japan with the
promise of a job -- in her case, a real job inspecting rubber seals
for refrigerator doors.</TE>
<TE>   But a year later, she was fired as part of the company's
restructuring plan.</TE>
<TE>   There was no shackling debt, but also no money to pay her way
home. Other Japanese employers wouldn't hire her for lack of proper
papers, qualifications and language skills.</TE>
<TE>   "In Japan, with the economy so terrible, foreigners are the first
to get fired. So they told me, 'We're sorry,' " she said. "I don't
like sex work, but I have to eat."</TE>
<TE>   So she took a tip from a friend and started selling herself
outside an hourly rate hotel with peeling wallpaper and no towels.
It's just enough to pay rent for the one-room apartment that she
shares with four other Thai women.</TE>
<TE>   Hitomi says she came to Japan full of hope that she would make
money, return to Thailand and start a family. But since she traded
her factory smock for a low-cut denim jacket and fuchsia lipstick,
she says, those aspirations seem more like fantasies.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't think about marriage or kids because I'm not a good
woman. The future is only dreams," Hitomi said. "What would you do if
you were me?"</TE>

<HD>Nez Perce Revive Their Tradition of Horsemanship</HD>
<DH>The tribe, stripped of its steeds after 1877, is
establishing a new breed that is a cross between Appaloosas and
Central Asia stallions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nicholas K. Geranios</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>LAPWAI, Idaho</DL>
<LD>Redwing Two Moons hung on to the reins as the exotic horse raced
around a small circular corral.</LD>
<LD>   Rarely ridden, the horse known as Yellowhand was refusing to take
orders from the 16-year-old member of the Nez Perce Indian tribe. But
after several minutes, the exhausted horse slowed to a trot and
submitted to the teenager's will.</LD>
<LD>   "You did good, Redwing," riding instructor Rudy Shebala said. "You
got the worst out of him, that's for sure. You keep him running until
he acts good."</LD>
<TE>   Despite the dust and the sweat, this small drama was an exercise
in cultural pride. After Chief Joseph made his famous vow in 1877 to
"fight no more forever," the U.S. Army stripped the Nez Perce of
their prized Appaloosa horses. It took more than a century, but the
Nez Perce are breeding horses again.</TE>
<TE>   "We are keeping up the traditions of our ancestors in our time,"
said Shebala, 45, who runs the horse program for the tribe.</TE>
<TE>   Horses were the trademark of the Nez Perce since they first
acquired runaway Spanish animals in the 1700s. Eventually, they bred
the Appaloosa war horses that allowed them to become a dominant
inland Northwest tribe.</TE>
<TE>   It was those horses that helped a small band of Nez Perce warriors
to outrun and outfight the U.S. Army for more than four months in
1877.</TE>
<TE>   Despite being slowed by their women and children as well as the
sick and the elderly, the Nez Perce conducted an epic flight across
parts of Idaho, Wyoming and Montana with the Army in pursuit. Only 40
miles from the Canadian border, soldiers caught the Indians in the
Bear Paw Mountains of Montana.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than see his people annihilated, Chief Joseph laid down his
rifle and the Nez Perce were taken to Ft. Leavenworth in Kansas. Many
of the tribe's surviving horses were given as prizes to soldiers and
other whites, and to tribes that helped the Army.</TE>
<TE>   With their nomadic existence at an end, the Nez Perce found little
use for horses in the following century, even after they were
resettled on a reservation in northern Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   While individual Nez Perce continued to raise horses, the practice
was dormant as a tribal enterprise until the mid-1990s, when a
proposal was made to start a horse farm as a "culturally appropriate"
business.</TE>
<TE>   By then, the Appaloosa breed had been appropriated by other
horsemen and is now registered by the Appaloosa Horse Club of nearby
Moscow, Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   So the tribe decided to create its own breed. They mixed western
Appaloosa mares and Akhal-Teke stallions from Turkmenistan in Central
Asia. A new registry, the Nez Perce Appaloosa, was launched.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to create a modern Nez Perce horse," Shebala said.</TE>
<TE>   That's more difficult than it sounds because over the centuries,
humans have mixed many combination of horses to create breeds, and it
can be difficult to find a new mixture.</TE>
<TE>   The first four stallions were donated to the tribe by a Minnesota
breeder.</TE>
<TE>   The idea was to blend the Appaloosa's blocky, muscular traits, and
distinctive spots on the rump, to the slim and elegant Akhal-Teke
horse. The Asian horses are believed to be similar to the original
Spanish horses brought to North America, which were the ancestors of
the Nez Perce war horse.</TE>
<TE>   The new breed -- the oldest is now 6 years old -- is distinguished
by a deep chest, pronounced withers and long muscles. The horses are
tall and built for endurance.</TE>
<TE>   Besides breeding horses, the program is intended to teach Nez
Perce youth the arts of horsemanship and horse management, and the
business opportunities available. Money is made by selling horses and
offering trail rides to tourists.</TE>
<TE>   The work of raising and training the horses falls to more than a
dozen Nez Perce high school students at a time, Shebala said.</TE>
<TE>   The tribe is proud of its program, he said, taking horses to
parades, shows and rodeos.</TE>
<TE>   "Our 16- and 17-year-olds say they were raised with horses,"
Shebala said.</TE>
<TE>   The work is physically grueling.</TE>
<TE>   One horse refused to accept a saddle, even though it had been run
so hard that foam lathered its body. Shebala and his son Sheldon, 24,
used lariats to tie up one of its legs and force it to lie on the
ground. The struggling horse nipped Sheldon in the arm.</TE>
<TE>   A saddle was strapped to the prone horse and 17-year-old Carl Ray
Powaukee straddled the animal as the others released the ropes. The
horse popped to its feet, with Carl neatly in the saddle. He rode the
angry animal for several minutes as it tried to knock him out of the
saddle by scraping the corral fence.</TE>
<TE>   Carl has been around horses much of his life, and last month
traveled to New York to learn horseshoeing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather do this than work anywhere else," Carl said. "To us,
it has to be important. We have to get our history back together."</TE>

<HD>Human Clone Is Born, Company Claims</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Malcolm Ritter</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>HOLLYWOOD, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Ushering in either a brave new world or a spectacular hoax, a company
founded by a religious sect that believes space aliens populated the
planet announced Friday that it has produced the world's first cloned
baby.</LD>
<LD>   A healthy 7-pound girl, nicknamed Eve by scientists, was delivered
by Caesarean section Thursday somewhere outside the United States,
said Brigitte Boisselier, chief executive of Clonaid. Boisselier said
the girl is an exact copy of the American woman who gave birth to
her.</LD>
<LD>   At a news conference, Boisselier offered no scientific proof,
provided no photos and did not produce the mother or child. She said
proof -- in the form of DNA testing by independent experts -- will be
available in perhaps eight or nine days.</LD>
<TE>   "You can still go back to your office and treat me as a fraud,"
she told reporters. "You have one week to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Cloning experts were skeptical or reserved judgment on the
announcement, which is certain to touch off fierce ethical, religious
and scientific debate. In Washington, the Food and Drug
Administration said the agency will investigate whether the
experiments violated U.S. law.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has no specific law against human cloning. But
the FDA contends its regulations forbid human cloning without agency
permission.</TE>
<TE>   "The very attempt to clone a human being is evil," said Stanley M.
Hauerwas, a professor of theological ethics at Duke University. "That
the allegedly cloned child is to be called Eve confirms the godlike
stature these people so desperately seek."</TE>
<TE>   Boisselier would not say where Clonaid has been carrying out its
experiments and did not identify the scientists involved.</TE>
<TE>   She said the mother is 31 and has an infertile husband. The couple
have decided not to face the media now, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Four other couples are expected to give birth to Clonaid-created
clones by early February, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Clonaid was founded in the Bahamas in 1997 by Claude Vorilhon, a
former French journalist and leader of a sect called the Raelians.
Vorilhon, who calls himself Rael, claims a space alien visited him in
1973 and revealed that extraterrestrials had created all life on
Earth through genetic engineering.</TE>
<TE>   Boisselier, who claims two chemistry degrees, identifies herself
as a Raelian "bishop" and said Clonaid retains philosophical but not
economic links to the Raelians. Rael is "my spiritual leader,"
Boisselier said.</TE>
<TE>   "I do believe we've been created by scientists," she said. "And
I'm grateful to them for my life."</TE>
<TE>   She said none of the couples are Raelians.</TE>
<TE>   So far, 10 women have been implanted with Clonaid-created cloned
embryos, Boisselier said; five had miscarriages in the first three
weeks, and the other five led to "Eve" and the four current
pregnancies.</TE>
<TE>   No couple has paid for the cloning effort, but some of the first
five couples invested in Clonaid, she said. She said she does not
know how much Clonaid will charge once it begins to offer the service
commercially.</TE>
<TE>   To gain convincing proof that "Eve" is a clone, Boisselier said
she accepted an offer by former ABC News science editor Michael
Guillen.</TE>
<TE>   Guillen, now a free-lance journalist who said he has no connection
to Clonaid, said he has chosen "world-class, independent experts"
whom he did not identify to draw DNA from the mother and the newborn
and test them for a match.</TE>
<TE>   "The baby is very healthy," Boisselier said. "The parents are
happy. I hope that you remember them when you talk about this baby --
not like a monster, like some results of something that is
disgusting."</TE>
<TE>   The notion of human cloning is controversial, both because of the
apparent risk to a baby -- cloned animals have shown a host of
abnormalities -- and because of other ethical considerations.
Boisselier contends that defects seen in cloned animals will not
necessarily appear in humans.</TE>
<TE>   "If my science is giving babies to parents who have been dying to
get one with their own genes, is my science worse than the one
preparing bombs to kill people?" she asked. "I am creating life."</TE>

<HD>Koppel, Neighbors War Over Estates</HD>
<DH>'Nightline' anchor wants to cap the size of nearby homes at
10,000 square feet. His critics say he's building a Taj Mahal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Matthew Mosk</AU>
<BD>Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the air, he has played the delicate role of referee to Israelis
and Palestinians. In the midst of South Africa's clash over
apartheid, he brought Foreign Minister R.F. Botha and Archbishop
Desmond Tutu into U.S. homes on the same television broadcast.</LD>
<LD>   But at home in Potomac, Md., where he is building a massive
riverfront estate on 16 acres of cattle pasture, Ted Koppel is at war
with his neighbors.</LD>
<LD>   The anchor of ABC's "Nightline" and his wife are entering the
fifth year of a ferocious land dispute that is headed for court in
Montgomery County. The Koppels contend in a lawsuit that their
neighbors have ignored an agreement to cap the size of their houses
at 10,000 square feet, a tad larger than George Washington's home at
Mount Vernon.</LD>
<TE>   " 'Don't build a monster McMansion' -- that's the essence of what
it is," said lawyer Thomas D. Murphy, who represents Koppel, 62, and
his wife, Grace Anne Dorney, 63.</TE>
<TE>   The neighbors have counter-sued, saying the Koppels have some
nerve policing the size of other houses while they are building their
own Taj Mahal. In interviews, the neighbors add that the Koppels have
chosen a strange setting to wage war against ostentation.</TE>
<TE>   About 16 miles northwest of Washington, Potomac is one of the
nation's wealthiest suburbs, where road signs warn drivers to yield
to horseback riders. It is also emblematic of America's recent
obsession with the megahouse. Two-thirds of the area's homes are
leviathans, boasting nine rooms or more (not including bathrooms).</TE>
<TE>   The houses that line Ardnave Place, the narrow incline that leads
to the Koppels' sprawling property, are in various stages of
construction. But residents who have moved in say their homes are no
different than scores of other mansions in surrounding communities.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole thing is ridiculous," said Diane Patronas, who bought
land near the Koppels in 1998. She declined to be interviewed at
length because she didn't want to fuel the dispute but added,
"Frankly, I can't believe a mature adult would do this."</TE>
<TE>   In the countersuit, the developers of the neighboring properties
say that every home in the subdivision is under the
10,000-square-foot threshold except one: the Koppels'. They allege
that the Koppel manse is expected to top 14,000 square feet. Koppel's
attorney called that claim "completely fabricated" and said that the
house would be 9,700 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   What no one can contest is that 10 years ago, the Koppels obtained
an unusual, contractual right to demand that their neighbors live
within these size constraints.</TE>
<TE>   The limit dates to 1993, when the Koppels spotted the 44-acre
cattle farm on a list of properties for sale by the Resolution Trust
Corporation, the agency that was overseeing the government bailout of
the savings and loan industry.</TE>
<TE>   Working under the corporate name Kodor Associates, the couple paid
$2.7 million for 16 acres of the site overlooking the Potomac River.
The Livingston Family Limited Partnership bought the rest, planning
to put 14 houses there.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the agreement with the Koppels, the Livingston group
pledged to restrict those houses to 10,000 square feet. The
arrangement, Murphy said, was cemented in covenants only after the
Koppels agreed to significantly increase their purchase price.</TE>
<TE>   "That was very important for [the Koppels], because they were
concerned that McMansions would overwhelm the ground, and they were
willing to pay a steep price to avoid that from happening," Murphy
said.</TE>
<TE>   But five years later, when builders started grading the lots along
Ardnave Place, the Koppels began worrying that the houses next door
were going to be much larger than promised.</TE>
<TE>   In letters to builder Mitchell, Best &amp; Visnic, Grace Dorney
pleaded for some proof that the houses would not exceed the
10,000-square-foot limit.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to have good relations with you, with Livingston
Partners, and with all the new neighbors," Dorney wrote in October
1998. "One of the components of this relationship is a commitment to
the covenants which we and Livingston Partners executed to protect
our property."</TE>
<TE>   In their court filings, the Koppels say they got the runaround
from the builder and were forced to sue when several mammoth houses
began to rise.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney for Livingston Partnership, Glenn Etelson, would not
comment on the case, citing a law-firm policy. But court papers
indicate that the dispute has focused on one issue: how to measure
the houses.</TE>
<TE>   Judges on Maryland's mid-level appeals court issued a preliminary
ruling that included basements in the measurement but dismissed
several of the Koppels' claims, determining that only two houses may
exceed the size threshold. Those cases have been returned to
Montgomery County for trial.</TE>
<TE>   For several of those who bought the houses in question, and
inherited the accompanying legal battle, the fight with the Koppels
has been a whopping headache.</TE>
<TE>   Shirley Ballard Miller, who bought a lot near the Koppels in 1998,
said her home was one of those cleared by the appellate court, but
not before the Koppels' attorneys crawled around her house with tape
measures.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all dumbfounded," Miller said of the dispute. "No one
understood what it was about. Why anyone would care so much about
every little inch."</TE>
<TE>   Miller said she and other neighbors were required to spend hours
in depositions, seated across from Dorney and her attorneys,
answering questions about what she knew and when she knew it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was all very annoying," she said, "But I tried not to let it
bother me."</TE>
<TE>   The Koppels referred calls requesting comment to Murphy, who said
the reason for all the antagonism is not that the English-born news
anchor, the son of a tire-factory owner, wanted the biggest house on
the block.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Murphy said, when the Koppel home is completed, it will
be "built into the land" and measure well under the
10,000-square-foot limit. A neighboring barn and chicken house will
be preserved. And the house, which sits beyond an earthen berm, will
not be visible from the approaching road.</TE>
<TE>   All that said, Murphy agreed, the motivations driving the dispute
-- which after years of litigation must itself have grown to be quite
costly -- are probably difficult for the average person to grasp.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about a strata that is so different from the vast
majority of the population," he said. "Everyone here has the dollars
and cents to do all of this."</TE>
<TE>   And the reason the Koppels do it, he said, is because they had a
vision for the land where they wanted to live and paid a premium for
the right to see that vision fulfilled.</TE>
<TE>   Not part of that picture, he said, were homes like the one on
nearby River Road, which was featured in a recent New York Times
article about the hulking homes of the American suburbs. Reading from
the news clipping, Murphy gasped at a photo of the
14,000-square-foot, $3.5-million neo-Italian villa, which boasts a
master bedroom with a 16-foot barreled ceiling and a kitchen with a
14-foot-long, two-tiered food preparation island that seats eight.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't want something like that on this particular piece of
land," Murphy said. "To them, it was just really important to know
that the land was being protected and respected."</TE>

<HD>Lighthouses Again Brightening Lake Champlain</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>ISLE LA MOTTE, Vt.</DL>
<LD>For almost 150 years, a squat, cast-iron lighthouse has stood on a
bluff overlooking the northern end of Lake Champlain a short sail
from the Canadian border.</LD>
<LD>   The 10-sided light atop the 30-foot tower used to guide barges
carrying lumber and paper or passenger steamships.</LD>
<LD>   It's been dark for almost three-quarters of a century. In 1933,
the job of guiding lake traffic was handed off to a nearby light that
until recently flashed from dark until dawn atop a steel tower.</LD>
<TE>   But the light room at the top of the lighthouse is flashing again,
as is another lighthouse that once cast a signal to mariners from its
19th-century light. Others on the lake are being relighted too.</TE>
<TE>   "We are keeping the signal for the mariner and putting some
history back onto Lake Champlain," said Coast Guard Chief Warrant
Officer David Waldrip, who oversees 134 lighthouses from the Canadian
border to New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Relighting the historic Lake Champlain houses involves more than
sentimentality. "It's going to be a huge savings for the taxpayer,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   That's because owners of the lighthouses will be responsible for
upkeep of the buildings while the Coast Guard only maintains the
lighting apparatus inside the top section of the tower.</TE>
<TE>   The first Lake Champlain lighthouse was relighted in August in
Alburg. A light atop a 1933 steel structure, known as a skeleton
tower, was returned to the adjacent 1858 lighthouse at Windmill
Point, about five miles north of Isle La Motte and just south of the
Canadian border.</TE>
<TE>   It's a vindication of sorts for Lucky Clark, who owns the
lighthouses at Isle La Motte and Alburg, and his son, Rob. The two
have spent a lifetime maintaining the lighthouses when they were
nothing more than government surplus property.</TE>
<TE>   "Evidently, way in the back of my mind, I said, 'Someday, people
are going to like these things,' " said Lucky Clark, 84, a retired
purchasing manager from Champlain, N.Y. His father bought the Isle La
Motte lighthouse in 1949. He bought Windmill Point in 1963.</TE>
<TE>   Clark was right.</TE>
<TE>   "The visible monuments to maritime history are these lighthouses
that are visible today. Now that they are going to have the lights
back in them, they'll be able to celebrate it that much more," said
George Clifford of Plattsburgh, N.Y., who wrote "Lake Champlain
Lighthouses."</TE>
<TE>   When it was last painted, the 1857 Isle La Motte lighthouse, made
of cast iron, was orange, but the sun has faded it to a mottled pink.
The Windmill Point lighthouse is blue limestone, quarried on Isle La
Motte.</TE>
<TE>   Clark's sister lives in the lightkeeper's home at Isle La Motte.
The Windmill Point home is vacant and being renovated.</TE>
<TE>   On a late summer morning, the only traffic on the lake off Isle La
Motte were a couple of fishing boats anchored in the passage between
Vermont and New York.</TE>
<TE>   It's very different from a century and a half ago when the
120-mile lake was one of the most important commercial waterways in
North America.</TE>
<TE>   Lake Champlain, thanks to a barge canal and the Richelieu River,
linked the Hudson and St. Lawrence rivers. In 1875, Burlington was
the third-largest lumber port in the country. The lighthouse at Isle
La Motte helped guide the lumber barges.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1920s, the U.S. Lighthouse Bureau started abandoning
kerosene lamps, which needed constant tending, in favor of steel
towers. Kerosene eventually gave way to acetylene, then electricity.</TE>
<TE>   Today, about 80 years after the government started abandoning
lighthouses, the skeleton towers that replaced them are reaching the
end of their lives. In many places, the Coast Guard is replacing
skeleton towers with aluminum towers. It would cost up to $100,000 to
refurbish each skeleton tower or $50,000 to replace each. The Coast
Guard estimates the cost of relighting Windmill Point and Isle La
Motte at $5,000 to $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   Lucky Clark bought the Windmill Point lighthouse after stumbling
into the owner while walking on the point with his family. Over the
years, both Clarks have spent their free time tinkering on the
lighthouses, fixing the foundation on Isle La Motte, replacing the
glass if it broke, anything to protect them from the elements.</TE>
<TE>   For years, their work was a curiosity. But, about 1975, the public
began to sense the mystique of lighthouses. Gradually, the Clarks
started thinking about relighting them.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, they had informal correspondence with Coast Guard
officials who were as enamored of lighthouses as they were, but the
Clarks never formally suggested moving the light back into the tower.</TE>
<TE>   But last summer, while the Clarks were working on the Windmill
Point lighthouse, a Coast Guardsman stuck his head through the hedge
and asked the way in. That discussion led to the idea of moving the
light from the tower on Windmill Point back into the lighthouse.</TE>
<TE>   What followed were plans to relight Isle La Motte and houses in
New York state on Cumberland Head, just outside Plattsburgh; on
Valcour Island and at Split Rock, near Essex, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Since Windmill Point and Isle La Motte were in good shape, little
needed to be done, and Rob Clark took on much of it himself. The
Clarks installed a Coast Guard-supplied solar panel that charges the
batteries for the optics. That light was also supplied by the Coast
Guard.</TE>
<TE>   Father and son estimate that they spent $400 on supplies and more
than 400 hours getting their lighthouses ready.</TE>
<TE>   Windmill Point was relighted Aug. 7, National Lighthouse Day, and
Isle La Motte on Oct. 5.</TE>

<HD>Two Generations Prosper by Descending Into Darkness</HD>
<DH>Although the Clean Air Act has decreased demand for Ohio's
high-sulfur coal, a father and 2 sons make a good living in the
mines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Casey Laughman</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>MIDDLEBOURNE, Ohio</DL>
<LD>It takes two generations of the Beaver family about an hour, maybe a
little more, to get to their jobs mining coal.</LD>
<LD>   Interstates don't run to where they earn their living. And because
mines keep closing and jobs keep disappearing, they have to travel
farther to get to work. Some mines have been as close as 30 minutes'
drive, others as far away as Lisbon, a two-hour commute.</LD>
<LD>   Getting there isn't easy. The roads wrap around the hills and
plunge down in the valleys of southeast Ohio. After dodging the
occasional deer and navigating hairpin turns, the Beaver men pick up
their lunch buckets, put on their helmets and board an express
elevator for what can turn out to be a 1,000-foot descent into the
coal.</LD>
<TE>   Rick Beaver and two of his adult sons, Charlie and Matt, are part
of a diminishing profession in Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Ohio's coal industry boomed, bringing high-paying jobs
to areas that needed them most. In 1970, the state turned out more
than 55 million tons of coal and the industry employed about 8,500
people. Last year, the industry produced about 25 million tons of
coal and employed 2,720 people.</TE>
<TE>   The passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970 means that Ohio's
high-sulfur coal has to be cleaned to ensure it conforms to federal
standards for sulfur dioxide emissions from burning coal. That
requirement has caused demand for Ohio's coal to decrease, said Doug
Crowell of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources.</TE>
<TE>   "From a marketability standpoint, nearly all of our coal is
labeled as high-sulfur," Crowell said. "When you wash our coal, it
seems as ... though the best sulfur-reduction you're going to achieve
is 50%," which still results in illegal sulfur-dioxide levels.</TE>
<TE>   Rick, 56, has been mining coal for almost 33 years, Charlie 13 and
Matt five. When Rick started, families weren't that common in mines.
Many of his co-workers today, however, represent a couple generations
working the mines.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be, if you was a company man, they wouldn't let your
sons or your daughters come in," he said. "But it's all changed now."</TE>
<TE>   Of the five Beaver children -- four boys, one girl -- only Charlie
and Matt followed their father into the mines.</TE>
<TE>   In an area where good jobs are hard to find, the Beavers say they
have carved out a good living for themselves by descending into
darkness and bringing out the light. Underground coal miners earn, on
average, about $54,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   On a cold November morning, Matt, 23 and the youngest,is seated on
a couch in the living room of his modest house just east of
Cambridge. Lights are on, "SportsCenter" plays on the TV, it's
comfortable inside.</TE>
<TE>   He can thank the mines.</TE>
<TE>   "I come home and my house is warm," said Matt, who began working
in the mines two days after he turned 18. "If I want to turn a light
on, I can. Coal's a big reason for that."</TE>
<TE>   About 90% of the state's high-sulfur coal is burned to provide
electricity.</TE>
<TE>   Rick, whose gray hair is slowly taking over his red goatee, is
enthusiastic when he talks about going into the mine.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just like walking in my house," he said. "There's no
difference to me, it don't bother me, I've been doing it so long."</TE>
<TE>   He started out as a mine worker and became a supervisor in 1974.</TE>
<TE>   "I got tired of the strikes," he said with a smile. "Never did
draw a full paycheck when I was in the union, seemed like. So I got
my state papers and became a boss."</TE>
<TE>   He runs his own crew now and says he plans to stick with mining
until he retires -- not for another six years, at least.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't want to do anything else," he said. "I've made a good
living coal mining. I've raised five kids with it. My wife's never
had to go to work."</TE>
<TE>   The other three Beaver children have good jobs outside the mining
industry: Kathy, 29, is a registered nurse who's taking time off to
rear her family; P.J., 27, is a hotel manager in Atlanta; and
25-year-old Mike works at a dialysis center.</TE>
<TE>   Rick's wife of 34 years, Judy, knows mining well. Her father,
uncle and grandfather were miners. "I used to worry," she said. Then
one day it occurred to her: "What's the use of worrying? Everything's
dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   Rick has lost two co-workers -- one killed in a supply-car
accident, the other crushed between two cars used to transport
workers underground.</TE>
<TE>   They almost lost Charlie.</TE>
<TE>   He and another miner were bolting, or shoring up the roof of the
shaft, at a mine in Lisbon when the roof started to drop chunks of
coal behind them -- a sign of a possible impending collapse. The two
were called out of the mine by their boss.</TE>
<TE>   "Right after they got out, the whole intersection came in," Rick
said. "He'd have been buried in there."</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Charlie hasn't had any close calls, but he did miss
work for two months this fall because of knee surgery for stress
fractures, which he says were probably caused by years of kneeling in
the mine.</TE>
<TE>   He never planned a career in coal mining. He studied history at
Ohio Wesleyan for two years, planning to be a teacher and coach, when
he made his first trip into the mine in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Charlie, I don't want you working in the mines,' " his
father recalls. "He said, 'Just for the summer, dad.' "</TE>
<TE>   It has been a 13-year summer.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, he kept reminding me, 'Hey, don't forget, you'll have
to check into finishing your schooling,' " Charlie said. "I said I
might as well do one or the other."</TE>
<TE>   Coal mining won; the money was good.</TE>
<TE>   He has some regrets about not finishing college, but he has made a
good life for his wife, Stephanie, and son, 7-year-old C.J.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, since I've been off with my knee for the last
month-and-a-half, I finally get to see what the real world's like
after 13 years," he said. "I call it being stuck in a cave for 13
years. I pray every day that the good Lord somehow, some way, gets me
out of it."</TE>
<TE>   He wants to be around when C.J. starts playing ball. But if his
son decides to become a miner, Charlie already knows what his answer
will be.</TE>
<TE>   "No chance," he said. "Absolutely no chance of me letting him do
that. That's the truth. My dad, he swayed me from it, but there was
no 'You're absolutely not going to do this. I'm not going to let
you.' "</TE>
<TE>   He has other plans for his son.</TE>

<HD>Castle Prison Finds Redemption as Spine-Tingling Tourist
Draw</HD>
<DH>The shuttered Ohio reformatory opened to the public in
1996. Visitors can choose from a dungeon tour, tower tour, Hollywood
tour or historic tour.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Emily Swartzlander</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>MANSFIELD, Ohio</DL>
<LD>Paint flakes off the interior walls of the old prison, some of them
pockmarked as if they have taken a few rounds of cannon fire.
Bathroom fixtures are ripped out of their lodgings. A musty odor
hangs in the air.</LD>
<LD>   Curiosity drew Catherine Ramsey here to the former Ohio State
Reformatory, an imposing structure she couldn't help but notice
whenever she visited her son at the prison next door.</LD>
<LD>   "I wanted to see the castle," she said.</LD>
<TE>   The sandstone and limestone prison that had a role in such films
as "The Shawshank Redemption" and "Air Force One" has grown in
popularity as a tourist destination since it reopened in 1995, five
years after it closed.</TE>
<TE>   The Mansfield Reformatory Preservation Society plans to turn the
prison into a museum and open it for business meetings, parties and
large tour groups. The society purchased it from the state for $1 in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Its medieval design and rich history are among the draws.</TE>
<TE>   About 37,000 people visited the 106-year-old building last year,
compared with 1,600 when the reformatory first welcomed tourists in
1996.</TE>
<TE>   Ramsey took two 30-minute tours, one of which took her down into
the damp basement of the structure -- six stories tall at its highest
point -- and the individual cells known as "the hole," where an
inmate was held in solitary confinement. The experience left her a
little shaken.</TE>
<TE>   When the prison opened in 1896 as a reformatory for first-time
offenders, a small cell was hidden behind two huge metal doors that
stood parallel to each other, no more than 2 feet apart. An inmate
who had broken the rules would stand between the two doors -- because
standing was all the narrow space allowed -- for hours at a time, the
only air seeping through an opening the size of a mailbox slot on the
exterior door.</TE>
<TE>   The inmate would go into the pitch-black, windowless cell to eat
and sleep.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of stuff they did in here that was inhumane,"
said Ramsey, who drove a little more than an hour from her home in
Seven Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The Mansfield Reformatory Preservation Society has raised about
$750,000 in a fund-raising campaign begun last year. It is expected
to cost about $16 million to fully restore the prison, said John
Toney, who writes grants for the society.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors climb stone steps leading to two sweeping verandahs and
enter the lobby, where stone arches and columns give way to steel
bars.</TE>
<TE>   Ramsey's second tour took her to cellblocks on the upper levels
and the guard tower. At the edge of an open cell, her camera captured
the sullen image, and she shuddered before hurrying away down the
hallway.</TE>
<TE>   Since renovations began, a new roof was put on half of the
building and electrical service was restored. The warden's quarters
is being renovated, and the prison's 350 windows are being repaired
or replaced.</TE>
<TE>   "There's still a huge amount of work to do, but from where we've
started, we've come a long, long way," said Dan Seckel, an architect
who serves as the society's president.</TE>
<TE>   The tours have grown to include an annual haunted house in the
fall and ghost hunts -- periodic unsupervised overnight stays for
those who want to search for paranormal activity. Fees vary for each
tour, ranging from $5 for a dungeon tour, tower tour, Hollywood tour
or historic tour to $50 for an overnight stay.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland architect Levi Scofield modeled the prison after the
medieval castles of Europe in an attempt to inspire the young male
prisoners first housed there. Scofield believed that if inmates lived
in a place that looked like greatness, it would help in their
reformation and inspire them to be better people.</TE>
<TE>   The prison typically housed as many as 2,400 inmates who were
trained in various skills, including landscaping. They designed and
maintained a small lake and public picnic area on the grounds.</TE>
<TE>   By the 1970s, the building was deteriorating, and it no longer met
the state's standards for a reformatory. In its final days as a
maximum-security prison, the 7-by-9-foot cells housed two men in a
space intended for one. The heating systems often failed, and the
building's structure fell into disrepair.</TE>
<TE>   When the building was shuttered in December 1990, its 3,200
prisoners were taken next door to the Mansfield Correctional
Institution.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Ohio State Reformatory has a charm that attracts
cinematographers.</TE>
<TE>   It has been a backdrop for a music video by rock band Godsmack in
2000, and the movies "Harry and Walter Go to New York" in 1976 and
"Tango &amp; Cash" in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   "It can be set in many, many different ways because of the Old
World appearance," Seckel said.</TE>
<TE>   Remnants of movies, such as a picture of Soviet leader Vladimir
Lenin left from "Air Force One," filmed here in 1996, or a sewage
pipe used in an escape by Tim Robbins' character in 1994's "The
Shawshank Redemption" can be seen on the Hollywood tour.</TE>
<TE>   The prison, which is listed on the National Register of Historic
Places, holds a special place for locals as well.</TE>
<TE>   Tour guide Ike Webb, a former guard here in the 1950s and '60s,
often shares his favorite stories, including the time that a warden's
wife complained about her laundry, which was cleaned by inmates, only
to find her next load starched so stiff that she couldn't wear it.
"She never complained again," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Webb felt compelled to help save the building that's been a part
of his life since his childhood. He was born less than a mile away
and played on the prison grounds when he was young, ice skating on
the pond or soliciting help from prisoners to pick wild strawberries,
he said. When he learned about the preservation society's efforts, he
decided to join.</TE>
<TE>   Seckel said residents think of the prison as a place that both
frightened and intrigued them.</TE>
<TE>   They would recall "driving past the prison with mom or dad, and
[their] saying, 'That's where the bad guys live, and if you are bad,
you will live there too,' " he said.</TE>

<SE>Part three in a weekly series about two mysterious deaths and
a reluctant witness.</SE>
<AU>Helen O'Neill</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>GREEN RIVER, Wyo.</DL>
<LD>THE STORY SO FAR</LD>
<LD>   Roger Brauburger had finally gone to the police with his secret:
Just three weeks before Liana Duke and her 5-year-old son fell to
their deaths on Lost Dog Trail, her husband had tried to hire Roger
to kill them. And now the husband wanted Roger to help him kill
again.</LD>
<LD>   From Associated Press</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   GREEN RIVER, Wyo.-- FBI agent Todd Scott hated his job that day,
couldn't remember a single task in his career that had sickened him
as much.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing can prepare you for this, he thought. No training can
teach you how to confront parents with proof that their two sons --
their only children -- had been plotting to kill them.</TE>
<TE>   Larry and Roberta Duke were gracious and kind. They talked of
their grief over Liana and Erik, whose photographs lined their living
room walls. They talked with pride about their sons, Mike and Bob.
Good boys, they said. Turned out real good.</TE>
<TE>   The couple refused to listen to the FBI tapes of their younger
son, Bob, plotting their murders. They angrily dismissed Scott's
explanation of the federal charges. The case hinged on the word of a
drug addict and loser, they said. Why would anyone believe Roger
Brauburger over their son?</TE>
<TE>   Scott's heart went out to them. There are some things, he thought,
no parents should ever have to believe.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The FBI wrapped up the case quickly. The brothers pleaded guilty,
saying they wanted to spare their parents the anguish of a trial.
Four months after their arrests, Bob Duke was sentenced to 10 years.
Mike Duke got 21 months.</TE>
<TE>   It was May 1999, nearly three years after the deaths of Liana and
Erik Duke.</TE>
<TE>   In Green River, the schoolteachers' sons and their murder-for-hire
plot was the talk of the town.</TE>
<TE>   People ached for the parents, who still marched into class every
day, stoic in their belief that their sons had been wronged. Friends
tried to comfort them, sent flowers and cards with little notes that
made muddled attempts at saying the right thing.</TE>
<TE>   But what could anyone say when the whole town was buzzing with the
same awful question: If Bob Duke was capable of plotting to murder
his parents, had he also killed his wife and child?</TE>
<TE>   There were many who shunned Brauburger, blaming him for inflicting
this pain upon the parents, upon the town.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like the town was divided," Brauburger said later. "Half
congratulated me and the other half hated me -- all because I had
done the right thing."</TE>
<TE>   Brauburger couldn't believe the outcome of the FBI case.
Initially, investigators had told him that Bob Duke would probably go
to prison for life. Ten years! That meant he'd be out in seven. And
his brother would be out in a few months.</TE>
<TE>   Brauburger had no doubt they would seek revenge.</TE>
<TE>   Brauburger was married now. He had a child and another on the way.
In a panic, he drove to the FBI in Cheyenne and demanded that his
family be put in the federal witness protection program.</TE>
<TE>   "I put myself on the line for you guys," Brauburger told Todd
Scott.</TE>
<TE>   Sorry, Scott told him. Brauburger didn't qualify for witness
protection. Duke simply wasn't considered dangerous enough.</TE>
<TE>   Brauburger was terrified. Everywhere he went, people whispered
behind his back. News accounts portrayed him as a drug addict,
although he insisted he'd given up drugs years ago. He had been
kicked off jobs by people who were friends of the Dukes. His ulcer
was getting worse. Even his home life was rocky: His wife, Heather,
had thrown him out a few times because she was so fed up with his
drinking.</TE>
<TE>   Many times he wondered: Why had he bothered?</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of the few times in my life when I had really done the
right thing, the hardest thing," Brauburger said. "And no one seemed
to care if I lived or died."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In his tiny basement office next to the courthouse, Tim Merchant,
division commander with the Sweetwater County sheriff's department,
had never been able to shake his doubts about the deaths of the
mother and child. With the conclusion of the federal case, he had a
new reason to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   Merchant is lean and weathered, proud of his badge and his roots
that go back five generations in this town. He trusts his instincts,
especially when things don't feel right. And nothing had ever felt
right about the deaths of Liana and Erik Duke.</TE>
<TE>   For nearly a year after the brothers went to prison, Merchant
mulled over the case. He pored over FBI documents.</TE>
<TE>   He tracked down Brauburger and found a man who felt bitter and
betrayed and terrified.</TE>
<TE>   When Bob Duke gets out of prison, I'm going to meet him with a
gun, Brauburger told Merchant.</TE>
<TE>   "If I don't kill him first, he'll kill me," he said. "And no one
else will protect me."</TE>
<TE>   Merchant listened. Brauburger's fear was believable. And so was
his story about what happened at the cliff at the end of Lost Dog
Trail.</TE>
<TE>   But Merchant needed more than Brauburger's word to make a case.</TE>
<TE>   He drove to the cliff and stood at the top, kicking through the
sagebrush, peering over the sheer 100-foot drop to the ledge where
Liana and Erik had fallen. The wind whistled, blowing up the dust.
The cliffs rose all around, dark and foreboding.</TE>
<TE>   No one brings a child to such a place, he thought.</TE>
<TE>   Back in his office, Merchant pulled out the file. He spread the
photographs across his desk and stared at them for a long, long time:
Liana, battered and swollen, her bruised body crumpled over a rock, a
thick purple mark ringing her neck. Little Erik in all his angelic
innocence, looking as if he were sleeping except his face was ashen.</TE>
<TE>   Merchant felt sick.</TE>
<TE>   This guy is not going to get away with this, he thought.</TE>
<TE>   In April 2000 Merchant went to his boss.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to reopen the Duke investigation," he told him.</TE>
<TE>   "Go for it," his boss said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The first person Merchant went to was Sweetwater County Attorney
Harold Moneyhun. Like Merchant, the 51-year-old prosecutor had been
haunted by the deaths of the mother and child for years.</TE>
<TE>   Moneyhun is tall and serious, with a quiet sense of authority and
a thoughtful, scholarly manner. In his heart he felt he had a murder
case. But could he prove it?</TE>
<TE>   The FBI tapes proved the plot against the parents, but they
offered nothing explicit about the wife and child.</TE>
<TE>   The cliffs were compelling: When he stood at the edge of Lost Dog
Trail, Merchant had no doubt he was looking at a murder weapon and no
doubt that the jury would feel the same. But that wasn't enough for a
conviction.</TE>
<TE>   And then there was Brauburger.</TE>
<TE>   "I believed Roger when he said Duke had offered him $15,000 to
kill his wife and child," Moneyhun said. "But would a jury be able to
see past Brauburger's own past, which we knew the defense would
raise? I just didn't know."</TE>
<TE>   Merchant showed Moneyhun the photographs. He pointed to the marks
on Liana's neck. Both men were thinking the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   Moneyhun e-mailed the photos to a pathologist friend in Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   The reply came back like a thunderbolt.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like she was strangled."</TE>
<TE>   Could this be their proof?</TE>
<TE>   They decided to seek a court order to exhume the bodies.</TE>
<TE>   For the next two months Merchant and a team from Moneyhun's office
tirelessly worked the case. Phone records, financial records,
insurance records. They dug up every scrap of information they could
find.</TE>
<TE>   They interviewed and re-interviewed everyone who had been at the
scene on Aug. 10, 1996 -- rescuers, firefighters, cops. They tracked
down Duke's old school friends and girlfriends and people he had
worked with.</TE>
<TE>   Over and over, they interviewed Brauburger. His story never
wavered.</TE>
<TE>   Gradually, they pieced together discrepancies in Duke's story: He
told some people that Erik had been playing with toys, others that
the boy was throwing rocks. He told some that the family had gotten
lost; others told investigators that Duke knew the trails well.</TE>
<TE>   They tracked down experts who might help their case: A fall expert
who dropped lifelike dummies from the cliff in an effort to prove
that Liana and Erik might have been pushed. A taekwondo expert who
explained ways of immobilizing people without leaving a mark. A
lichen expert who scrambled fearlessly around the cliff's edges and
concluded, unequivocally, that the cliff face had not given way. In
some of his accounts, Duke had said it had.</TE>
<TE>   But the key was the autopsy. That would be their trump card.</TE>
<TE>   On July 7, the bodies of Liana and Erik Duke were exhumed.</TE>
<TE>   Four days later the autopsy results came back: The injuries were
horrific, but they were consistent with a fall.</TE>
<TE>   Liana Duke had not been strangled.</TE>
<TE>   Merchant and Moneyhun were so devastated they considered dropping
the case.</TE>
<TE>   But there was more bad news.</TE>
<TE>   Sifting through financial records, Merchant found a $1,000 check
from Duke made out to Roger Brauburger in October 1996, two months
after the deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Hush money? That was what it looked like.</TE>
<TE>   Merchant was furious. Had their key witness been lying to them?</TE>
<TE>   "We warned you there were to be no skeletons or we would find
them," he yelled at Brauburger.</TE>
<TE>   Brauburger was a nervous wreck. He'd lost work over this case --
days when he had to skip jobs for yet another interrogation by
investigators. His health was suffering. He had put himself on the
line for the cops, the FBI and now the prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   He needed these guys to believe him. If they didn't, no one would.</TE>
<TE>   Desperately, Brauburger explained that the loan was drug money. He
had this dumb idea that he could borrow the money to buy marijuana,
sell it and pay Duke double what he owed.</TE>
<TE>   "It was stupid and it didn't work," Brauburger said. "But I'm
telling the truth."</TE>
<TE>   Merchant had no choice but to believe him.</TE>
<TE>   But would a jury?</TE>
<TE>   Next week: The courtroom faceoff.</TE>

<TE>   How This Story Was Reported</TE>
<TE>   -  From Associated Press</TE>
<TE>   This story is based on extensive interviews with investigators
from the Green River (Wyo.) Police Department and the Sweetwater
County Sheriff's Department; prosecutors; the FBI; witnesses,
including Roger Brauburger and his family; relatives of Liana and
Erik Duke; and jury members. It also drew on court testimony and
evidence submitted in both the federal and state cases, including FBI
tapes of conversations between Bob Duke and Brauburger, the coroner's
report, photographs of the scene and of the autopsies. Research
included attendance at the trial and the sentencing as well as visits
to the cliff at the end of Lost Dog Trail. Duke and his family
declined to be interviewed.</TE>

<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>LAKE HILL, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Every day, Eugene Pettet walks the mossy banks of Mink Hollow Stream
and Cooper Lake doing his job -- checking water levels, adjusting
valves, watching for trespassers.</LD>
<LD>   It's an idyllic workplace, and Pettet has spent 30 years here,
living in the same lakeshore home where his wife, the last
caretaker's daughter, grew up.</LD>
<LD>   But these days, Pettet fears that even his quiet lake with its
occasional loon could be a target for terrorists, attracted by a
billion gallons of pristine mountain water waiting to be pumped to
the faucets of the city of Kingston a dozen miles east.</LD>
<TE>   No longer do big road signs declare the lake and the stream
property of the city's water department. They were put away.</TE>
<TE>   "We changed all the locks" -- to the fences, the sheds,
everything, Pettet said.</TE>
<TE>   In an age when all the nation's communities are worried about
terrorism, water is not a spectacular target compared with a nuclear
plant or a skyscraper. But it's everywhere. And every town depends on
it.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to instill fear in America, hit a rural area," said
Judy Hansen, who has run Kingston's water department for 20 years.
"All water utilities, even the small trailer parks, are taking this
seriously."</TE>
<TE>   So is the federal government, which has ordered each water utility
to assess its vulnerability to terrorist attack and ways to protect
it. The Environmental Protection Agency has put together millions of
dollars in grants and training programs, with more promised.</TE>
<TE>   Water, however, presents a special puzzle to those trying to
protect the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say that although water shouldn't be ignored, it's not the
easiest target. Reservoirs are so huge, they are hard to poison.
Quality checks and purification should detect and block chemical or
biological attacks. Bombs could shut down pumping stations, but
probably wouldn't leave many casualties.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, water is incredibly hard to protect because of
those huge reservoirs, miles of distribution systems, access points
on every street, home and business. And everyone depends on it for
life.</TE>
<TE>   "How are you going to protect every single fire hydrant out
there?" said Greg Evans, director of the Center for the Study of
Bioterrorism and Emerging Diseases at St. Louis University. Quick
response -- rather than blanket protection -- is the way to prepare,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the concern about water is real. President Bush underscored
that when he kicked off his campaign for a homeland security agency
at a Kansas City water treatment facility that was protected by a
rusty chain-link fence next to a busy city street.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, the EPA began providing $53 million in grants to
water systems to assess their vulnerability and come up with
emergency response plans, beginning with those serving more than
100,000 people. By the end of 2004, smaller utilities must do so too,
including Kingston, population 25,000.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, officials should review personnel background checks,
computer security, access to pump stations and water sources, and the
safety of chlorine used to treat water, the EPA said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always imponderables," said Tracy Mehan, EPA's assistant
administrator for water. "You develop security options to deal with
some threats, and then creative, evil people come up with other
avenues of attack."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the EPA has begun studies to improve detection
and analysis of potential chemical or biological threats in drinking
water, and the best ways to make plants and pipes harder to damage.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration's budget, still being debated in
Washington, includes $22 million to help water utilities with
training and technical assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Water utilities complain that that doesn't go far enough because
it only pays for part of the cost of studies and reports -- not the
actual improvements. If the government is serious about protecting
water, it needs to provide more money, they say.</TE>
<TE>   The American Water Works Assn., a group that represents 80% of the
nation's water utilities, estimates that at least $1.5 billion is
needed nationwide for the most basic steps, and several billion more
for extensive improvements.</TE>
<TE>   The first $115,000 vulnerability assessment grant went to a
suburban Maryland water commission, although safety improvements
there could reach $100 million, the Washington Suburban Sanitary
Commission estimated.</TE>
<TE>   Kingston, on the west bank of the Hudson River some 110 miles
north of New York City, pumps 3.5 million gallons of water each day.</TE>
<TE>   Emergency management and law enforcement officials here and in
surrounding Ulster County worry not just about supplies for the city,
a onetime capital of the state, but for scores of small towns across
the craggy Catskill Mountains nearby.</TE>
<TE>   The county is also home to much of New York City's massive network
of drinking water reservoirs. Sept. 11 brought armed guards and road
closures.</TE>
<TE>   In the county's 1,100 square miles, at least 50% is watershed --
where streams form or groundwater collects -- for someone's drinking
water, said Art Snyder, the county's emergency management director.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not something you can protect like a building. You can't
lock all the doors and set up barricades," he said. "There's hundreds
of miles of shoreline."</TE>
<TE>   Mink Hollow Stream collects runoff from the steep Catskill slopes,
its gurgling waters home to coveted brook and brown trout. An old
stone weir diverts water to a grate, where a hand-cranked wheel in a
locked shed controls the flow.</TE>
<TE>   The water runs through cast iron pipes to Cooper Lake. Gravity
takes out much of the silt and carries the water through more pipes
down to the treatment plant, where it's filtered through sand and
anthracite, and disinfected with chlorine.</TE>
<TE>   From the treatment plant, gravity takes the water into another
reservoir, where it runs to more than 8,000 service connections and
900 hydrants in Kingston.</TE>
<TE>   In all, security improvements are likely to cost $2 million,
Hansen said, while the annual water budget runs $2.5 million. These
costs will wind up on the bills of the city's water users unless the
federal government helps.</TE>
<TE>   Locks, fences, cameras and more watchfulness are the first
improvements being considered as Kingston looks to protect its
supplies. Other steps "you wouldn't see," Snyder said. The
vulnerability assessment itself, like studies that the county has
done on how to respond to other terrorist attacks, won't be public
either.</TE>
<TE>   These reports are kept in draft form because they're always
changing -- and also because that means they're not subject to state
Freedom of Information laws, Snyder said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to give the public confidence; we are focused on
it," Snyder said. "But we also don't want to make it public so people
who want to do harm can circumvent it."</TE>
<TE>   Upstairs in the 103-year-old water plant, where high school
students still take their annual tour, a 10-foot-wide American flag
covers most of one wall.</TE>
<TE>   That went up a few days after Sept. 11. It covers a detailed map
of the city's water system.</TE>
<TE>   Out at the lake and stream, Pettet, with a walkie-talkie hanging
from his overalls, will continue his patrols. It's not high-tech, but
it works.</TE>
<TE>   "Vigilance is the big thing up here," Hansen said. "He's our eyes
and ears here, literally."</TE>

<HD>Grandmother Steps In to Ease Loss of Mother</HD>
<DH>Thelma Davis has taken in five grandchildren and two
others. Grandparents provide stability and a bond, experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martha Irvine</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>SKOKIE, Ill.</DL>
<LD>Barrington Jones came to live with his grandmother that awful Sunday
nearly nine years ago. He still recalls it vividly -- staring at his
mother's body, uncomprehendingly, as she lay in bed.</LD>
<LD>   Barrington, then just 7 years old, thought that she was asleep.
She'd been having one of her seizures. So her children did as she
always asked. They left her alone to rest and wait it out.</LD>
<LD>   This time, however, Hillary Jones -- a single mother of four  --
never woke up.</LD>
<TE>   "I didn't really understand what happened until after a while,"
Barrington said.</TE>
<TE>   A tall, lanky 16-year-old, he is now the oldest of seven children
that his grandmother, Thelma Davis, and her husband, Wilfred, have
taken into their home in the suburbs just north of Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   It is a common scenario: the 2000 Census found 2.4 million
grandparents who are primary caregivers to grandchildren. Sometimes,
the parents have died, walked away or struggled financially. Still
others lose custody because of drugs or abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Many psychologists and social workers who specialize in families
say grandparents often provide stability and a bond that allows a
child not only to survive but thrive. They can be a familiar, warm
presence that softens the pain of a parent's absence.</TE>
<TE>   But it's not always easy.</TE>
<TE>   Resources -- money, time, energy -- are often stretched,
particularly for grandparents on fixed incomes or whose health is
declining. And frequently, experts say, the grandchildren have
residual issues over their parents that even the most dedicated
grandparents have trouble resolving.</TE>
<TE>   Barrington knows how that is.</TE>
<TE>   He loves his grandmother, and she loves him. She is, in many ways,
his anchor. But sometimes he still feels adrift and alone, even in a
crowded, two-level apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, he says, his grandmother's love just can't replace his
mother's.</TE>
<TE>   "I just feel like something's missing," he said. "There's a hole
there, you know? I try to fill it with other things. But it's hard."</TE>
<TE>   His sullen face brightens as he recalls a favorite memory of his
mom -- getting to stay up when his younger siblings were asleep to
play cards with her or watch TV together. She was only 30 when she
died.</TE>
<TE>   Barrington misses her, even when he tries not to.</TE>
<TE>   He'd also like to see more of his father, who visits occasionally
but has a new family that Barrington doesn't really feel part of.</TE>
<TE>   He's even been wondering if he belongs with his grandmother and
Wilfred, since they took in the other four children three years ago.
Two are the children of Thelma's son, Harold, who's struggled with
cocaine addiction. The youngest two are not Harold's but have the
same mother as his kids. She lost custody of all four amid
accusations of neglect.</TE>
<TE>   Their presence makes Barrington yearn even more for his own
mother, even if she struggled on public assistance to raise him and
his siblings with little help from the boyfriends who fathered them.</TE>
<TE>   "Back then, I thought life was good. It wasn't really that good,"
Barrington said. "But honestly, I think it would be better because we
wouldn't have to go through all this mixing up."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, money is just as tight for Thelma and Wilfred as it was
for Barrington's mom, despite the aid that the couple receives from
the state of Illinois for rearing their grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Thelma used to work 12-hour shifts as a certified nursing
assistant but has cut back on her hours to care for the children.</TE>
<TE>   Their grocery bills run about $250 a week. And earlier this year,
the couple fell behind on payments and were evicted from the
townhouse they were buying in nearby Evanston.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Thelma says she had no choice but to take in all seven
children -- six boys and a girl.</TE>
<TE>   "I call them all my children. I want them with me," said Thelma,
who's been surrounded by young ones much of her life.</TE>
<TE>   The mother of eight of her own, she came to this country from
Jamaica in 1967 to work as a nanny and maid with families in Miami
Beach and then Chicago's wealthy suburbs. She married Wilfred, a
native of Belize, in 1981 and had her youngest child, Frances, with
him the next year.</TE>
<TE>   "Many babies have passed through these hands," she said, holding
them out and smiling broadly.</TE>
<TE>   Now Wilfred supports the family by driving a forklift at a
sporting goods company, while she runs the house -- going to
parent-teacher conferences, doing heaps of laundry, making sure that
homework is done and shirts are tucked in.</TE>
<TE>   She's enjoying her second chance at parenting.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think my own children got as much out of me as these ones
do," said Thelma, 60. "I used to work so much. I'd be so tired.
They'd want to tell me something and I'd say, 'Mmm hmmm.' But I'd be
falling asleep."</TE>
<TE>   Still, keeping up with seven children is a challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Time for individual attention is short. And Thelma readily
concedes that she's sometimes unsure how to comfort Hillary's kids --
including the oldest, Chantel, who is putting herself through college
and lives on her own.</TE>
<TE>   "Now it's really telling how hurt they were," Thelma said.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, she says, they burst into anger, seemingly for no
reason. Other times, they are aloof.</TE>
<TE>   Christoff, Barrington's 13-year-old brother, occasionally goes
straight to bed after school. Barrington likes to seek out the
emptiest room in the family's four-bedroom apartment in Skokie.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really need that much attention. I don't like that much
attention," he said. "When I do get attention, it's to work."</TE>
<TE>   Even at his high school -- a sprawling campus with thousands of
students -- Barrington says he mostly keeps to himself.</TE>
<TE>   "Most dudes have a best friend or two best friends," he said. "But
I'm not really like that. Most of the time, I'd rather be by myself."</TE>
<TE>   In his room in the basement, Barrington keeps an old photo of his
mom. Alongside it are pictures of a few girls from school, including
some he has dated.</TE>
<TE>   Girls, he says, are easiest to talk to: "I don't know why. Maybe
they fill some of that hole that's there."</TE>
<TE>   His grandmother, a church-going woman who can be protective to a
fault, grimaces at the idea of Barrington dating.</TE>
<TE>   She's been reluctant to let him get his driver's license or go to
school dances. She also frequently lectures him about AIDS, all the
while watching his eyes for signs of drug use.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see the badness yet, but I'm always scared," said Thelma,
who sometimes vents her concerns at a monthly meeting for
grandparents rearing their children's children.</TE>
<TE>   Her worrying sometimes causes Barrington to keep his plans secret
-- "even if it's just going to the mall to get something to eat," he
said. But his gratefulness eases his frustration.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever I'm mad at her, I just don't say anything," he said.
"She's been there for me a lot."</TE>
<TE>   He's less forgiving of Wilfred, his grandfather by marriage but
not by blood.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't really speak," Barrington said, complaining that Wilfred
often rides him about playing sports. (He joined his school's
wrestling team this fall when Wilfred wanted him to play basketball.)</TE>
<TE>   Wilfred -- who is the family enforcer when things get rowdy or
chores go undone -- says he's the one who initiates conversations
with Barrington. But starting work at 6 a.m. also leaves him little
energy for parenting when he gets home.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't go nowhere -- work, home, watch this," Wilfred said,
pointing to a fuzzy-screened black-and-white television on the
kitchen table. "After the news, bedtime."</TE>
<TE>   Down the hall, Barrington is slouched on the living room couch,
watching the family's other TV. Christoff and their 10-year-old
brother, Nicholas, occasionally join him.</TE>
<TE>   If he belongs anywhere, Barrington says, it's with the two of
them.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, they get on my nerves. But I want to be there for them,"
he said, pausing for a moment.</TE>
<TE>   "But I don't want them to be like me. Sometimes, I feel like I'm
not going nowhere."</TE>
<TE>   In more upbeat moments, Barrington talks about becoming an
electronics engineer or an author. A junior high teacher once told
him that he had a talent for writing fiction.</TE>
<TE>   His grandmother supports his college dream but says he'll have to
bring up his grades -- and likely pay his own way.</TE>
<TE>   He's determined anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at this situation and I think about how I want to have a
better house, a better job, better income, better stuff for my kids,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Just everything better."</TE>

<HD>Life on the Mississippi Moves Crusty Author to Tears</HD>
<DH>Mark Twain's last trip to his boyhood home was to be
low-key but became a media circus. Bittersweet memories haunted his
visit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jim Salter</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>HANNIBAL, Mo.</DL>
<LD>The white-haired man squinted from the lectern at the star-struck
youngsters and old friends eager to hear his stories. But the words
that usually came so easily weren't there.</LD>
<LD>   The bittersweet recollection of his boyhood; thoughts of time's
passage; lost friends and loved ones; and the knowledge that he was
home for the final time overcame him.</LD>
<LD>   Mark Twain bowed his head and sobbed.</LD>
<TE>   It was 100 years ago that the author and humorist paid his final
visit to Hannibal, his hometown and the inspiration for his most
famous works. Twain spent parts of five days in late May and early
June 1902 in Hannibal, a visit that gave him a burst of inspiration
yet a strong sense of melancholy and an enhanced awareness of his own
pending mortality.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at his age and the fact that he had not been here for
12 years before that visit, he probably knew it would be his last
trip back to Hannibal," said Henry Sweets, curator of the Mark Twain
Boyhood Home and Museum, centerpiece of the downtown historic
district built largely on Twain's legacy.</TE>
<TE>   Twain was born Samuel Clemens on Nov. 30, 1835, in the tiny
northeast Missouri village of Florida. His family soon moved to the
Mississippi River town of Hannibal.</TE>
<TE>   The picturesque setting and roughhewn characters were the
inspiration for fictional St. Petersburg, Mo., in "The Adventures of
Tom Sawyer," "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" and some of his
other works. Tom and Huck, Becky Thatcher, Injun Joe and others were
based on real childhood friends and town characters.</TE>
<TE>   Twain left Hannibal at 18, taking a job on a steamboat (where he
took his pen name -- "Mark Twain" was a phrase indicating that the
water was a safe depth) before becoming one of America's greatest
writers. He returned only sporadically, usually for brief visits
during lecture tours or to attend a funeral, Sweets said.</TE>
<TE>   In late 1901, the University of Missouri contacted Twain about
making the trip to Columbia for an honorary doctorate.</TE>
<TE>   "He saw the trip also as a chance to return home quietly to
Hannibal," said Paul Sorrentino, professor of English at Virginia
Tech and a noted Twain expert.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of a quiet visit home, though, the trip turned into a
media circus. More than 100 newspapers chronicled Twain's every move.</TE>
<TE>   The sleepy river town that Twain left as a teenager was a far
different place in 1902. Ron Powers, author of a book on Hannibal,
"White Town Drowsing," wrote that the city at the time boasted 18,000
residents (about the same as today), 56 daily passenger trains, 112
factories, a streetcar system and the world's largest Portland cement
plant.</TE>
<TE>   Twain's first two stops -- to his boyhood home and Mount Olivet
Cemetery -- symbolized his internal struggle, according to
Sorrentino.</TE>
<TE>   "Whereas the home represented his youth and the imaginative world
of Huck and Tom, the cemetery -- the burial ground of his parents;
his brothers, Henry and Orion; and most of 'the boys' from his past
-- reminded him of the painful reality of the present," Sorrentino
wrote in an issue of the biannual Mark Twain Journal.</TE>
<TE>   Intertwined with the melancholy was the joy of revisiting his
boyhood haunts and relishing his celebrity. Twain met with
grade-schoolers, handed out diplomas at the high school graduation,
quipped with reporters, lectured at churches, and attended receptions
and dinners in his honor.</TE>
<TE>   One day, he and boyhood pal John Briggs took a long carriage ride.
A reporter for the Ralls County Record went along as the men rode the
hilly riverside landscape, talking about old friends and old times.</TE>
<TE>   "Let us be boys again today and live over the past, for this is
one of the happiest days of my life," Twain said.</TE>
<TE>   As they passed an orchard, Twain and Briggs recalled stealing
peaches -- then plotting revenge against the slave who set dogs on
the young thieves. At a river overlook, Twain recalled swimming the
width of the river -- barely.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the closest call I ever had," Twain said.</TE>
<TE>   The trip to Hannibal was so inspiring that Twain contemplated
revisiting Tom and Huck as adults, Sorrentino said. He began putting
together a two-part book that would culminate with the old friends
returning to St. Petersburg late in life.</TE>
<TE>   But after writing half the manuscript, Twain destroyed it,
apparently torn over how the characters should ultimately end up.
Were they prosperous, successful, insane? Twain ultimately decided
that it was best not to know.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the joy of his visit and the burst of creativity,
newspaper reports noted several incidents where Twain was overcome
with emotion.</TE>
<TE>   He was barely able to make it through a speech at the Presbyterian
Church on May 30. As he wrote in a letter to his wife, Livy, "I had
to stand silent a long minute till I could speak without my voice
breaking." Twain "wept manly tears," the St. Louis Republic wrote, as
he spoke of "the cordiality of my reception by the old -- old men and
women who knew me here when I was a boy."</TE>
<TE>   Later that day, Twain spoke to the Labinnah (Hannibal spelled
backward) Club. St. Louis Post-Dispatch writer Robertus Love wrote
that the speech began in typical Twain fashion as he charmed the
crowd with his characteristic wit.</TE>
<TE>   "Then Mark Twain's whitened head was bowed for a moment and his
shoulders shook," Love wrote. As the tears came, Twain "seemed to be
groping for words. He mumbled something that was not understood, and
at last he looked up into the now tense, sympathetic faces of his
auditors."</TE>
<TE>   Those faces, Love wrote, "showed love for the town's foremost
citizen, who has proved upon this occasion and many others that he
loved his old home."</TE>

<LD>One of the least conventional holiday greetings we received this week
came from California Institute of the Arts. The art school has
somehow found the frontier between Christmas card and video game --
something we didn't know existed but are now grateful to have found.</LD>
<LD>   The card, covered in multicolored, kaleidoscopic spirals,
instructs recipients to go to a Web site at www.volvox.dasdeck.de.
This is a "Volvox image generator," which is, of course, what we
figured.</LD>
<LD>   Designed by CalArts alumna Andrea Tinnes, who earned a graphic
design MFA in 1998 and now lives in Berlin, Volvoxes (Volvi?) are
"ornamental character, or dingbats, superimposed concentrically," and
based on the illustrations of two turn-of-the-century biologists.
There's a description of multicellular organisms on the Web site that
we did not entirely understand.</LD>
<TE>   After a little messing around on the site, we ended up with an
enormous winged blue thing that rotated and surged toward us, kind of
like a giant, deranged moth. But after picking up a little skill with
the program, we produced nuanced forms, harmonious blend of colors
and shapes, and promptly drifted into a psychedelic haze.</TE>
<TE>   We were then summoned and asked to get back to work. The whole
experience left us wondering what they're smoking out in Valencia.
And more to the point, can they get us some?</TE>

<HD>Angelenos getting into the ACT</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Four Los Angeles dramatists -- Jon Robin Baitz, Lynn Manning, Alec
Mapa and Luis Alfaro -- will have works produced in 2003 at Seattle's
ACT Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Egan is bringing the L.A. bouquet as he transplants himself
from producing director of the Mark Taper Forum to his new job as
artistic director at ACT.</LD>
<LD>   ACT's season -- the first picked by Egan -- will include "Chinese
Friends," a new play by Baitz, whose close friendship with Egan
bloomed 16 years ago when Egan directed Baitz's breakthrough play,
"The Film Society," at Los Angeles Theatre Center. The Taper, where
Egan has worked since 1984, has since produced three plays by Baitz
-- with a fourth, the Egan-directed "Ten Unknowns," opening in March.
Egan, who will direct "Chinese Friends," has installed Baitz as ACT's
writer-in-residence for the next three years. Among their other
projects, the two plan to co-produce a new documentary theater piece
about John Walker Lindh.</LD>
<TE>   Three other Taper-related shows will take up slots in the ACT
season. Egan will direct Manning's "Weights," which he also staged in
2001 for Taper, Too. Another Taper, Too production, "Mapa Mia," which
opens Jan. 21 at the Ivy Substation in Culver City, will land at ACT
next fall. And Egan has tapped his fellow Taper staffer, Alfaro, for
"Borderlands," a primarily solo piece in which Alfaro will be the
main performer.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a Los Angeles flavor, definitely," Egan said. But he
also points to some Northwest connections: ACT will collaborate with
its Seattle neighbor, the Intiman Theater, on the world premiere of
Craig Lucas' "The Singing Forest," with Intiman artistic director
Bartlett Sher directing. But there's a Taper connection there too:
Sher recently was at the Taper directing "Nickel and Dimed," an
import from the Intiman.</TE>
<TE>   ACT also has announced that Warner Shook, the Intiman's artistic
director from 1993 to 1999, will direct the West Coast premiere of
Edward Albee's "The Goat or Who Is Sylvia?," winner of the 2002 Tony
Award for best play. Egan says he hopes the Intiman collaboration
will signal off the bat his aim of bringing a spirit of cooperation
rather than competition to the Seattle scene.</TE>
<TE>   Egan is no stranger to that scene: Before joining the Taper, he
was associate artistic director of the Seattle Repertory Theater.
Although he is shuttling plays northward now, more than a few have
traveled the opposite route: In 1997-98 alone, the Taper imported
four shows spawned in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Egan's other play picks for his first season at ACT are Pamela
Gien's touring one-woman show, "The Syringa Tree," recently seen at
the Pasadena Playhouse and now at the Canon Theatre in Beverly Hills;
"The Little Locksmith," a new solo piece by Linda Hunt; and Arthur
Miller's "All My Sons."</TE>

<LD>When the $11-million renovation of the Redondo Beach Performing Arts
Center is officially celebrated at a Jan. 17 gala, Carol Channing
will descend a grand staircase that was designed to look like the
Titanic's.</LD>
<LD>   Why would the organizers of a grand opening want to evoke memories
of one an ill-fated maiden voyage?</LD>
<LD>   Because the Civic Light Opera of South Bay Cities spent a lot of
moola on the set for "Titanic: The Musical" in 2001, and the group's
executive producer, James Blackman, thinks the scenery "would help
the evening along."</LD>
<TE>   "It looks like a beautiful hotel lobby. I don't want the stage to
look like 'America's Funniest Home Videos,' " Blackman said. "It
won't read as if we're on the Titanic."</TE>
<TE>   But on second thought, he added, "maybe I'll wear a chain of
rabbits' feet."</TE>

<LD>   What do you give someone who changed an art form by making it
consider bold new possibilities? A celebration, that's what -- the
kind of blowout that UCLA will host in Royce Hall and at other campus
sites in late January to observe the 50th anniversary of Cunningham's
dance company. Starting Jan. 30, three different programs will
showcase works created from 1956 to 2000, with the premiere of
"MiniEvent" enlisting the Kronos Quartet on opening night. Cunningham
himself reads the text from "How to Pass, Kick, Fall and Run" on Jan.
31.</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles Music Center</TE>
<TE>   Venue for experiments</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Disney Hall opens late in the year, but much earlier, in the
"vintage" Music Center across the street, experiments in dance
programming are likely to test the Southland's appetite for dance
adventures. In May, for instance, expect the locally based Diavolo
Dance Theater to invade the Ahmanson Theatre and maybe even link up
with other hyperphysical ensembles in a kind of mini-festival. Our
spies also report serious Music Center interest in the Bay Area's
classical innovator Alonzo King and his contemporary, chamber-size
LINES Ballet. Nobody's talking officially, but the dance hunt is
definitely on.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Villella</TE>
<TE>   Choreographer</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The man who created a whole new style for American-born ballet
stars -- who proved that you can dance the fanciest classical steps
at the most improbable speed without adopting any highfalutin airs --
brings his acclaimed Miami City Ballet to the Cerritos Center for the
Performing Arts on May 2 and 3. Wanna mambo? You will when you see
Villella's splashy, full-evening "Neighborhood Ballroom" on the
second and last night of the Miami visit. (More sedate choreography
by Balanchine and Petipa is scheduled on the opening program.)</TE>

<LD>Gae Aulenti</LD>
<LD>   Architect</LD>
<LD>   Italian architect Aulenti made her reputation with the Musee
d'Orsay in Paris and several Italian projects, including an Italian
Pavilion for Seville's Expo '92. Her style is often noted for a sense
of space, and an imaginative use of wood and brick. Aulenti, who says
she likes "forms in a harmonious relationship with the context for
which they are created," also works in interior and industrial
design. American fans will have a chance to see the 75-year-old
architect's work when the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco, her
biggest commission in the U.S., opens in March. The revitalized 1917
structure across from City Hall will include an indoor courtyard, a
sense of openness and an attention to historic details.</LD>

<TE>   Zaha Hadid</TE>
<TE>   Architect</TE>
<TE>   The sleek, fluid designs of Baghdad-born, London-based Hadid, who
worked with Rem Koolhaas, have been seen mostly in Asia and Europe.
But her first major U.S. commission opens next year: the first
free-standing building of the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   The 52-year-old architect is best known for her fragmented design
of a Hong Kong club house, which was included in the important 1988
Deconstructivist exhibit at New York's Museum of Modern Art but never
built. Her office is working on an arts center in Rome and a public
square in Barcelona; her ski jump in Innsbruck, Austria, just opened.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   United Architects</TE>
<TE>   Architectural team</TE>
<TE>   This group of innovative young Turks, which came together to
design what's become dramatic, well-received plans for the World
Trade Center site, is made up of six firms. The group includes Los
Angeles architect Greg Lynn and UN Studio, a cutting-edge Dutch
company that will complete a single-pylon bridge in Utrecht,
Netherlands, in March and an addition to Wadsworth Atheneum art
museum in Hartford, Conn., in 2006. Lynn, 38, teaches at UCLA and is
known for conceptual and high-tech digital architecture -- including
the award-winning Korean Presbyterian Church of New York. His firm,
Greg Lynn FORM, is based in Venice. United Architects may join forces
again for a transportation complex in Portland, Ore.</TE>

<LD>Bill Viola</LD>
<LD>   Video artist</LD>
<LD>   The mystery of human consciousness has been at the center of
Viola's art for 30 years. Thirteen video works, all new since the
L.A. artist's terrific midcareer survey at the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art in 1997, make up the international touring show "Bill
Viola: The Passions," organized by the J. Paul Getty Museum (Jan.
24-Apr. 27). The show includes the Getty-commissioned "Emergence," a
film transferred to high-definition video and based on a painting of
the Pieta by early 15th century Florentine master Masolino.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Laura Owens</TE>
<TE>   Painter</TE>
<TE>   L.A. artist Owens has sprinted to the head of the international
pack of a younger generation of artists with deceptively casual
canvases that freely mix Western and Eastern traditions (English
embroidery and Chinese landscapes, to cite one surprising
concoction). Plus, when she paints big, her work addresses a viewer
the way good installation art does: as an active, physical
participant. Owens' first solo museum show, organized by the Museum
of Contemporary Art (March 16-June 22), will feature 20 paintings and
15 drawings.</TE>

<TE>   Lee Bontecou</TE>
<TE>   Sculptor</TE>
<TE>   They said it couldn't be done -- but it apparently has been: "Lee
Bontecou: A Retrospective" begins its national tour at the UCLA
Hammer Museum (Oct. 7, 2003-Jan. 12, 2004). Steel, wire and canvas
wall-reliefs from the 1960s by the famously reclusive Pennsylvania
artist were the focus of a small gem of an exhibition at the Museum
of Contemporary Art 10 years ago. Bontecou brought to a remarkable,
feminist-inspired conclusion an otherwise largely uninspired genre of
Abstract Expressionist sculpture in that work, but she's shown rarely
in the last 25 years -- making this exhibition the focus of much
curiosity.</TE>

<LD>Mary Yukari Waters</LD>
<LD>   Fiction writer</LD>
<LD>   This year, Waters, 37, earned a master of fine arts in creative
writing from UC Irvine -- and her short stories appeared in three
prestigious anthologies: "The Best American Short Stories 2002"
(Houghton Mifflin), "The O. Henry Prize Stories 2002" (Anchor) and
"Pushcart Book of Short Stories: The Best Stories From a
Quarter-Century of the Pushcart Prize" (W.W. Norton). Waters, who
lives in West Los Angeles, also won a 2002 NEA Creative Writing
Fellowship award of $20,000.</LD>
<TE>   Her new collection of short stories, "The Laws of Evening"
(Scribner), is due in May. If it takes off, she'll join the shining
list of writers -- Alice Sebold, Glen David Gold and Michael Chabon,
among others -- who've launched careers from Irvine's prestigious
writing program.</TE>

<TE>   Nina Revoyr</TE>
<TE>   Novelist</TE>
<TE>   Revoyr's debut novel, "The Necessary Hunger" (Simon &amp; Schuster,
1997), the story of two female high school basketball players who
fall in love in Inglewood, won critical acclaim from Time magazine
and others. Revoyr, 33, who grew up in Culver City, turned to writing
as an undergraduate at Yale and went on to earn a master of fine arts
in creative writing/fiction from Cornell. But she's held her
California focus. Her second novel, "Southland" (Akashic Books), to
be published in April, is gathering early praise as a story about
family, race and murder in the Crenshaw District.</TE>

<TE>   Chris Abani</TE>
<TE>   Poet</TE>
<TE>   Abani fled Nigeria in 1991. In 1985, at age 18, he was imprisoned
after the Nigerian government deemed his first novel a threat to
national security, and in 1990, he was held on the country's death
row after the production of his third play led to a conviction for
treason. Abani, now a Middleton Fellow in creative writing at USC,
won the 2001 PEN Center USA Freedom to Write Award for poetry. In
early 2003, his new book of poems, "Daphne's Lot," is forthcoming
from Red Hen Press.</TE>

<LD>Eva Mendes</LD>
<LD>   Actress</LD>
<LD>   She caught our eye playing Denzel Washington's girlfriend in
"Training Day," directed by Antoine Fuqua. Now they're set to team up
again in MGM's fall thriller "Out of Time," with Mendes playing
Washington's love interest but in a more substantial, profile-raising
role. The 25-year-old Cuban American actress, who started out doing
commercials, also will star in "Once Upon a Time in Mexico," opposite
Antonio Banderas and Johnny Depp. It's the final chapter in director
Robert Rodriguez's trilogy, which started with "El Mariachi." And
she's in Universal's summer sequel "The Fast and the Furious 2." Her
sultry looks and sassy demeanor are reminiscent of the first "The
Fast and the Furious" female lead -- Michelle Rodriguez, one of the
few Latin actresses to land major roles in blockbusters. Mendes may
be next.</LD>

<TE>   Actor</TE>
<TE>   Nam was born in Argentina and grew up in Australia. His Korean
parents are in the fashion business, his brother dances in London,
and his sister writes books in Africa. How could Nam not become an
actor? The 23-year-old makes his studio film debut in March's "The
Perfect Score," a tale of six high school students who filch the
answers to the SAT. As Roy, a loner who joins the heist, Nam also
steals the movie. "When I came to L.A. to audition for the part, I
had $30 in my bank account," says Nam, who now lives in New York but
no longer tends bar. "I couldn't afford to tip the driver when he
dropped me off at Paramount. So when he opened the door, I just ran."</TE>

<TE>   Rodrigo Prieto</TE>
<TE>   Cinematographer</TE>
<TE>   Prieto has been a key part of the new wave of Mexican cinema,
thanks to his work on such films as "Amores Perros" and
"Sobrenatural" (All of Them Witches). But in the past few months,
he's emerged as one of the hottest young cinematographers in
Hollywood, helping create a dazzling visual look for such films as
Julie Taymor's "Frida," Curtis Hanson's "8 Mile" and Spike Lee's
"25th Hour." The 37-year-old cinematographer, who splits his time
between Los Angeles and Cuernavaca, Mexico, is back at work with
"Amores Perros" director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu on a new film,
"21 Grams." Co-starring Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro,
the film will be released later next year. Prieto has also shot a
documentary about Fidel Castro, directed by Oliver Stone, that is
slated for release by HBO next year. He and Stone plan to work
together on "Alexander the Great," starring Colin Farrell, which
could begin filming sometime next year.</TE>

<LD>William Bolcom</LD>
<LD>   Composer</LD>
<LD>   Bolcom, the subject of the Pacific Symphony's 2003 American
Composers Festival, is such a determined eclectic that he can't be
summed up easily. He's versed in ragtime, American popular song,
rock, jazz and more styles of classical music than one musician has a
right to be. The wonder -- and his epic "Songs of Innocence and
Experience," the festival's culminating work, is a wonder -- is that
he makes all of it his own. Bolcom will be in residence in Orange
County for the festival's five concerts, starting Jan. 28.</LD>

<TE>   Karita Mattila</TE>
<TE>   Soprano</TE>
<TE>   This Finnish singer seized the spotlight in the fall when she
assumed the title role in "Kat'a Kabanova" at San Francisco Opera.
She sang Janacek's music with stunning conviction and accuracy, and
brought such depth to her character that it felt as though a vital
secret of life were being revealed. Strauss' "Four Last Songs," which
Mattila will sing with the Los Angeles Philharmonic in March, also
exposes what's vital, but this time in the last embers of a life well
lived. Singing them is a juggling act between sentiment and
determination; Mattila is just such a juggler.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Masaaki Suzuki</TE>
<TE>   Artistic director</TE>
<TE>   It's strange to recall just how suspicious the early-music
community establishment was when organist, harpsichordist and
conductor Suzuki formed his Bach Collegium Japan in Tokyo in 1990.
Then the choir and orchestra recordings started coming out, and they
proved so impressive -- startlingly good intonation on period
instruments; a compelling feel for Bach's spiritual message -- that
the ensemble's discs now wind up at the top of critics' lists. For
his Los Angeles debut in April, Suzuki will go to the very heart of
Bach, with the St. John and St. Matthew passions at Royce Hall.</TE>

<LD>50 Cent</LD>
<LD>   "Get Rich or Die Trying" might be the most brutally honest
debut-album title since Notorious B.I.G.'s "Ready to Die," but rising
rap star 50 Cent hopes it won't turn out to be as prescient. Dropped
by Columbia after his 1999 single "How to Rob," which advocated
stealing from big rap stars, earned him nine bullets from an unknown
assailant, 50 Cent grabbed a spot on the "8 Mile" soundtrack with his
single "Wanksta." The too-brash gangsta from Queens has made his name
by upping the ante on insult and outrage, and now he's been singled
out by kingmaker Eminem and his chief counsel, Dr. Dre, who will
produce the debut collection for Interscope/Aftermath/ Shady, a label
alliance that did OK in 2002 with "The Eminem Show."</LD>

<TE>   The Distillers</TE>
<TE>   The Return of the Raw couldn't have come at a better time for the
Distillers. The L.A. band, fronted by Australian Brody Armstrong,
made a mighty noise in 2002 with its second album, "Sing Sing Death
House," and is now poised to sock it to a public that's been softened
up by more polite punk-</TE>
<TE>   rockers and garage-rock revivalists. The trio penetrated the KROQ
playlists with "City of Angels," bringing an uncommon personality and
ferocity -- not to mention an arresting female rock voice. Warner
Bros. Records head Tom Whalley was impressed enough to bring the band
into the fold from indie Hellcat/Epitaph. The next Distillers album
will come out in the fall on Hellcat/Epitaph/Warner Bros., after a
high-visibility platform on the summer's Warped Tour.</TE>

<TE>   The Music</TE>
<TE>   It's always risky placing your bet on a new sensation from
England, but in contrast to most of its Brit brethren, the Leeds
quartet known as the Music at least has the stated desire and
ambition to conquer America. The band also has a grand sound that
mixes Zeppelin, Queen and U2 into an electronics-spiked sonic storm,
a reportedly charismatic frontman in Robert Harvey, and a U.S. label,
Capitol, that put another newcomer, the Vines, on the map in 2002.
The debut album "The Music" comes out Feb. 25, just as the group
embarks on a U.S. tour opening for Coldplay.</TE>

comedian and writer, is going where many celebrities have gone before
-- to the late-night talk show arena. He will host his own
talk-variety series for FX this summer. Jones will have more going
for him than most movie stars who think hosting a talk show is a

well-intentioned young Sen. William Sterling Jr., who is out to shake
up the Senate. No word yet on if father and son will be running into

Now producers at 19 Entertainment are out to find the ultimate
"All-American Girl," who not only has charm, beauty and charisma, but
can also dance, sing, act and display an aptitude for sports. Girls
from all over the country will battle for the crown on ABC's

not completely functional. A bookshelf, for example, might also look
like a table turned on its side, with legs extending forward, as if

<DH>In Miami, a new generation of independent Latin music
producers competes with the town's former kingpin, Emilio Estefan Jr.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Agustin Gurza</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>Miami</DL>
<LD>Behind the wheel of his bright red Ferrari Modena, Fabio "Estefano"
Salgado is having a flash of road rage under a ferocious Florida sun.
The hot record producer and songwriter is trying to weave past an
indecisive driver in a beat-up Corvette that is drifting toward the
side of the road.</LD>
<LD>   Salgado shifts gears to pull ahead. But the Corvette suddenly
moves back into his path, forcing him to hit the brakes. Steaming,
Salgado honks the horn, his curly hair dangling over the bandanna
across his forehead, a stream of expletives sizzling over the roar of
the engine.</LD>
<LD>   The Corvette freezes and lets the Ferrari by. Smart move. These
days, it's futile to try to get in the way of the brash, big-talking
Colombian, one of the most sought-after producers in the Latin record
industry.</LD>
<TE>   Salgado -- who goes by the stage name he used in the '90s singing
duo Donato y Estefano -- is still revved up as he races to his
Midnight Blue Studios in North Miami Beach. That's where his company
recorded the smash 2000 album by Mexican pop singer Paulina Rubio,
salvaging her sagging career and nurturing her crossover aspirations.
Nobody can stop him now, says the agitated musician, who was named
BMI's top Latin songwriter in 2000 and 2002 for garnering the most
airplay.</TE>
<TE>   His competitors may try to throw roadblocks in his path, says
Salgado, who's working on tracks for Ricky Martin's new
Spanish-language album. But some day soon, he boasts, he's going to
have the whole market to himself. Then everybody will be kissing his
feet, he says, though he puts it more crudely in Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   But Salgado's goal of dominating Miami's Latin music scene is
becoming increasingly unattainable in a rapidly changing market.
Neither the city nor the industry is what it was when Salgado came to
town 10 years ago, empty-handed and hungry for success.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, when people thought of Latin music in this tropical
seaport, only one name came to mind -- Emilio Estefan Jr. Along with
his wife, singer Gloria Estefan, the enterprising Cuban American went
from heading a local salsa-meets-disco band called Miami Sound
Machine to building a musical conglomerate that seemed to monopolize
the business.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the White House and the recording academy turned to
Estefan as the spokesman of Latin music in the United States. Almost
every aspiring songwriter and producer wound up knocking at the door
of Estefan Enterprises in trendy South Beach. By the time the rest of
the country became aware of the so-called Latin explosion in 1999,
the year of Martin's "Livin' La Vida Loca," Estefan's staff had
worked with every big name in the business, including Ricky and
Shakira.</TE>
<TE>   Today in Miami's Latin music business, however, the era of one-man
rule is over. A new generation of independent producers has emerged
in the past few years, competing for market share with Estefan's
Miami Motown. They are the city's new sound machines -- a mushrooming
creative force bringing an array of styles and approaches to the
recording process.</TE>
<TE>   Some, like Salgado and fellow Colombian Kike Santander, are
defectors from the Estefan camp who have built rival hit-making
organizations with their own staffs of producers and songwriters.
Others, like Cuban American Lester Mendez, who recently worked with
Shakira and Carlos Santana, have carved independent paths to success.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a new sound coming out of Miami," says manager Fernan
Martinez, an industry veteran who represents Salgado as well as
Colombian pop-rock star Juanes. "Producers have been desperately
looking for another formula, something more contemporary, a little
more rockish."</TE>
<TE>   The proliferation of Latin producers, including veterans Rudy
Perez (Christina Aguilera) and Desmond Child (co-author of Martin's
"Vida Loca" and "The Cup of Life") has helped fuel Miami's recording
studio renaissance. But most important, their emergence means
alternatives for developing and established artists.</TE>
<TE>   Singer-songwriter Jorge Moreno, named this year's best new artist
at the Latin Grammys, said he sought out young Miami producers such
as Mendez and A.T. Molina to get a fresh fusion of sounds.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to be in the machine," he says. "I have my own way
of thinking how the production should go, and I wanted to do my own
thing."</TE>
<TE>   Santander, Salgado and Mendez are riding the crest of the latest
Latin music wave. Santander leans to the traditional pop of artists
such as young Spanish discovery David Bisbal. Salgado's Latin pop
sound is more upbeat and danceable, in the style of his new albums
for Mexican pop rivals Thalia and Rubio. And Mendez is in a world of
his own, cool and bicultural like Shakira.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the best thing that could happen," Santander says.
"Everybody wins by having better and more producers, because the
quality of the music improves. And the public wins because it's good
to hear on the radio things that sound different."</TE>
<TE>   Splintering of the empire</TE>
<TE>   Not long ago, Santander and Salgado were busy making hits for the
Estefans. They had no sooner arrived in this country, by separate
paths, than they handed Gloria Estefan the best Spanish-language work
of her career.</TE>
<TE>   The first song Salgado wrote for her was the nostalgic, rousing
title cut to her 1993 smash album "Mi Tierra." And Santander, who
holds a medical degree from the Universidad del Valle del Cauca in
his hometown of Cali, co-produced Gloria's 1995 Grammy-winning album,
"Abriendo Puertas."</TE>
<TE>   The title, which means "opening doors," would prove prophetic for
the budding career of the former ad jingle writer, then 34, who wrote
every cut on the festive, folk-tinged album. Before the end of the
decade, Santander would go on to work with the top names in Latin
music, all under the Estefan umbrella. He helped expand the style of
Mexican singer Alejandro Fernandez from mariachi to pop and composed
and produced tracks for Thalia and actress-singer Jennifer Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the hallway of Santander's modern, glass-and-metal offices
in South Beach is covered with plaques acknowledging the popularity
of his songs, including the huge hit "Azul" by Mexico's Christian
Castro. Santander, who recently produced two Carlos Santana tracks,
was also named BMI's Latin songwriter of the year, tied with Salgado
and others in 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Santander is known for his formal personal style and conservative
pop sound. But during an interview on the eve of his recent
honeymoon, he appeared relaxed, dressed in a cream-colored linen
shirt, Dockers and tan sandals.</TE>
<TE>   He says he learned much from his years with Estefan Enterprises,
especially Estefan's team approach of bringing studios, producers,
songwriters and executives under one production roof.</TE>
<TE>   "He offered everything in one package, including a record label,
which is my next step," says Santander, who plays piano, guitar and
accordion.</TE>
<TE>   Santander also learned the value of PR -- of "creating a brand,
because Emilio Estefan is a brand, and I am doing the same with my
name."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, it was Estefan's knack for capturing the media
spotlight that contributed to Santander's much-publicized conflict
with his former employer. Two years ago, he sued Estefan, claiming he
was not getting the public credit nor the compensation he deserved.</TE>
<TE>   Estefan denied the allegations and countersued. The bitter dispute
was settled out of court, and Santander now says the relationship is
amicable. Still, the lawsuit highlighted a hidden rift: It was the
first time an insider had so publicly challenged the Estefan empire.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like suddenly the bubble burst," says Santander, who won
this year's Latin Grammy for producer of the year. "Now, he's one
more player among many. Nobody can monopolize something as big as
Latin music. It's too vibrant, it moves too much to try to pretend
that somebody could control this."</TE>
<TE>   Estefan's response: There's room for everybody.</TE>
<TE>   The 25-year industry veteran acknowledges that his share of the
Latin Top 10 may have slipped in recent years, but he still has more
work than he can handle. His 16 producers and 42 songwriters are
keeping his eight recording studios humming around the clock. Despite
the recession, "this was a good year for me," he says, citing the
success of works by Colombian singer-songwriter Carlos Vives and
Shakira's smash crossover album, "Laundry Service," for which he was
executive producer.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'm doing great," Estefan says. "I have no complaints."</TE>
<TE>   Far from expressing concern about talent leaving his organization,
Estefan says he's proud that former proteges are doing so well.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the happiest I could be right now that I helped other
people's dreams come true."</TE>
<TE>   Rags to riches</TE>
<TE>   Salgado does not deny that he owes his first big break in the U.S.
to his former employer. Before joining Estefan as a songwriter,
Salgado says, he was living poor in New York. Now he lives in an
elegantly appointed Miami Beach home, with a dragon in a fountain
greeting visitors out front and Jet Skis parked on his backyard patio
on glistening Biscayne Bay. Salgado is not bashful about showing off
his collection of luxury Swiss watches, including a $200,000,
diamond-encrusted Frank Mueller that has no minute hand.</TE>
<TE>   "I came here searching for the dream, to make music," says
Salgado, a guitarist. "The American dream."</TE>
<TE>   Making dreams come true takes hard work, he says. The night before
the interview, he had stayed up until dawn preparing new material for
Alexandre Pires, the first pop singer from Brazil to cross into the
Spanish-language market since Roberto Carlos in the 1970s. Still,
Salgado seemed to have energy to spare, speaking rapidly about the
business, his success, his taste for minimalist, Japanese-style
furnishings.</TE>
<TE>   Later, seated behind a console at his cramped studios, he
excitedly previews a slick and catchy dance track he wrote for Puerto
Rican merengue singer Gisselle. It appears on her new album, which
his company produced. He bounces and sings along like an enthusiastic
music fan, the child of average folks who listened to radio and
bought records.</TE>
<TE>   "This really does sound modern," he concludes. "Takes her out of
that Nuyorican milieu they had her in."</TE>
<TE>   Salgado worries that Latin producers are stuck in formulas. They
need to evolve and stay fresh lest they lose fans to the mainstream
English market.</TE>
<TE>   "Why do people turn to other music? Because maybe we don't give
them what they want," says Salgado, who admires the classic
songwriting craft of Spaniard Manuel Alejandro. "Let's make good
songs with lovely lyrics, darn it. Let's stop making garbage and
stupidities just so we can brag that we are the biggest and best in
the world.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to make good music so that the public can believe in us
again."</TE>
<TE>   The Lester Mendez sound</TE>
<TE>   Crafting a contemporary sound is the specialty of Lester Mendez.
But public relations is not. You won't find a Lester Mendez Web page.
Rarely will you even read a Lester Mendez interview.</TE>
<TE>   The slightly built, baby-faced musician shrinks from the
limelight. During a recent interview, he kept folding and unfolding
his arms, clearly unaccustomed to being the focus of attention.</TE>
<TE>   His facilities are funky, not fancy, located in a hidden Coconut
Grove cottage on a quiet street with no sidewalks. There's a kind of
carefree, hippie atmosphere, here, with overgrown vegetation and
fading paint. It's a world away from the flash of South Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about glitz," says the soft-spoken Mendez. "It's more
about vibe."</TE>
<TE>   His is a cool, laid-back vibe that instantly resonated with
Shakira. The first time they met, in the mid-'90s, he says the
Colombian singer kicked off her shoes and started talking about the
British bands she loved back in Barranquilla -- Blur, Depeche Mode,
the Cure.</TE>
<TE>   Mendez, born in Cuba and raised in Miami, had grown up with the
same groups. "Yeah, it was cool," he recalls of the meeting. "She'd
remember the bass line from [Blur's] 'Girls and Boys' and I'd say,
'Yeah, I love that!' And I'd bring out the CD, and we'd listen to
it."</TE>
<TE>   That connection, facilitated by Estefan, turned out to be a gold
mine. Before the pair parted that day, they had written their first
song -- "Octavo Dia" (Eighth Day), a defiant social protest included
on Shakira's multi-platinum 1998 album, "theseDonde Estan Los Ladrones?,"
which Mendez co-produced.</TE>
<TE>   That album established Shakira as a star in Latin America and
launched Mendez's career too. Until then, the creative keyboardist
had been a moderately successful Miami studio musician, touring with
Spanish crooner Julio Iglesias and recording with rock guitarist
Jimmy Page. Today, he's being courted by renowned record executive
Clive Davis, who asked Mendez to collaborate on Carlos Santana's
recent "Shaman" album as producer and arranger.</TE>
<TE>   The mop-topped producer has also worked with heartthrob Enrique
Iglesias. Most recently, he's been working on songs with pop singer
Jewel, putting a Mendez groove under Jewel's storytelling English
lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike his colleagues, Mendez did not come up through the ranks in
Miami's tightknit music industry.</TE>
<TE>   "I always felt I had to find my niche, do stuff that's true to me,
the kind of music I like," says Mendez, who's now experimenting with
new twists to old Afro-Cuban jazz. "I always felt that's how it was
going to happen for me -- finding my own path."</TE>
<TE>   In a sign of where the industry is headed, he went his own way.</TE>

<DH>The networks count on Craig Zadan and Neil Meron to turn
out classy special events that draw big ratings. Now the duo is
looking to weekly TV for a secure future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Jensen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>New York</DL>
<LD>There's a new Professor Harold Hill coming to town, to sell parents
on the dubious virtues of 76-trombone marching bands, when ABC
revives "The Music Man" in mid-February. A new Billy Flynn has just
arrived too, and the scheming "Chicago" lawyer, embodied by Richard
Gere, is hard at work concocting perfect story lines to win clients
the attention of tabloid newspaper reporters and sympathy of gullible
juries.</LD>
<LD>   Even those master salesmen might have learned a thing or two from
Craig Zadan and Neil Meron. The executive producers behind "Music
Man" and "Chicago," the business partners have perfected a
razzle-dazzle sell-job in recent years persuading doubtful
entertainment executives and audiences that decades-old musicals can
have a new life as events for a new generation.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike Hill, the duo's Storyline Entertainment has come up with
the goods to back up their sweet talk, resulting in a successful
string of television hits, including CBS' Bette Midler-starring
"Gypsy," and at ABC, "Annie" and the music-filled "Life With Judy
Garland: Me and My Shadows." The films have earned critical praise
for their fidelity to the material, big production values and
inspired casting. The projects have been important for the networks
at a time when competition is fierce and TV movies are a difficult
audience sell.</LD>
<TE>   So Zadan and Meron expanded their sales pitch. The Miramax
theatrical release "Chicago," a film version of the Broadway musical
starring Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger and Gere, just opened,
after weeks of buzz about possible Oscar nominations. Up next, and a
big test of whether Storyline can break into completely different
territory, is the ABC action-adventure series "Veritas: The Quest,"
set to launch Jan. 27. More feature films, dramas and even sitcoms
are in development.</TE>
<TE>   The new projects come on top of a busy -- some might whisper
overextended -- period for Storyline's bread-and-butter business. A
"Martin and Lewis" biopic earned solid ratings for CBS in November.
Final details are being cleaned up on the much-anticipated "Music
Man," which stars Matthew Broderick. Casting on a new "Fiddler on the
Roof," also for ABC, is ongoing. CBS is expecting a three-hour film
about the creation of "I Love Lucy" for May.</TE>
<TE>   "Our interests were never 'Friday the 13th Part 3,' " says Meron.
"Or Part 8," adds Zadan.</TE>
<TE>   Lucky for them, nostalgia TV came in vogue just as they were
hitting their stride. Both raised in Brooklyn, Zadan, 53, and Meron,
48, first met in New York in the 1970s, when Meron, a Brooklyn
College student, invited Zadan, author of a book on Stephen Sondheim,
to speak at a lecture series. Eventually, Meron went to work as
Zadan's assistant on a series of club acts at the Ballroom in SoHo;
they later spent three years working together at Joseph Papp's New
York Shakespeare Festival. In 1979, Zadan moved to Los Angeles, where
he lives in the Hollywood Hills; Meron, who lives in West Hollywood,
followed in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   With a long string of theater credits and a grab bag of Hollywood
film and television jobs between them, including Zadan's just-ended
work as producer of "Footloose," they teamed up in the mid-1980s to
form Storyline, first focusing on long-to-gel features. It was in
1993 that having realized TV was a faster process, they hit it big
with "Gypsy," spurning the then-vogue "women in jeopardy" TV movies
for a project that got CBS' attention only when they promised they
could bring in a star and landed Bette Midler. Some 36 million
viewers tuned in.</TE>
<TE>   "Cinderella," for ABC, followed in 1997, with its groundbreaking
colorblind casting of Whitney Houston, Brandy and Bernadette Peters.
(In between, there were some less notable projects, the Jack
Lemmon-James Garner feature film "My Fellow Americans" and the
well-received "Serving in Silence: The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story,"
starring Glenn Close as an Army officer ousted for being gay.)</TE>
<TE>   With ABC's 1999 "Annie," Storyline took off, catapulting them,
along with Robert Halmi Sr., into the top rank of big-event TV movie
producers at a time when few are making it in the shrinking business.
Susan Lyne, now president of ABC Entertainment, was running ABC's
movie department and took on oversight of "Wonderful World of
Disney," where "Annie" was in development.</TE>
<TE>   Same-old movies of the week weren't working with bored audiences,
and Zadan, Lyne says, "knew that I was looking at new ways to break
out television movies. We really needed to look at each movie we
greenlit as an event in and of itself. Craig and Neil really believed
they could deliver movies that made people forgo their regular TV
habits and tune in to ABC."</TE>
<TE>   "Susan was the first person to treat us as filmmakers and not as
suppliers," says Zadan, who goes on to compare the woman who is their
biggest client to Jackie Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   Storyline, which does much of its production work in Toronto, did
seem to have the charmed touch. Other producers' TV movies about '60s
and '70s rock drew lackluster audience response; Storyline's "Beach
Boys: An American Family" followed on ABC and succeeded. Zadan says
that as with all of their films, the key was to "give it an emotional
core" that revolves around family. "If we can't find that, then we
find it hard to tell the story," adds Meron.</TE>
<TE>   So "Beach Boys" was about an abusive father; "Martin and Lewis" a
platonic love story about two men as close as brothers; "Annie" about
a little girl looking for family; and "Music Man" will emphasize the
love story. With biopics especially, Zadan says, the audience will
come based on the appeal of learning about "a show business icon, but
they'll stay because they can relate to the emotional point of view."</TE>
<TE>   Others around Hollywood zero in on different Storyline strengths.
The company, they say, is about bringing in the stars and then
selling the projects to audiences once they are finished. "They
realize that making the movie is often the least of it," Lyne says,
crediting their savvy choice of material as well as casting.</TE>
<TE>   Salesmanship and stars</TE>
<TE>   Often drawing on theater relationships, Storyline has delivered
stars. Case in point: Broderick, just off Broadway's hit "The
Producers," to play Harold Hill. They had put out feelers to Billy
Crystal, Kevin Kline and Steve Martin in the role, Zadan says;
Broderick heard about the part and approached them; he was the only
one to be offered the role. Zadan had known him through the actor's
wife, Sarah Jessica Parker, who played Rusty in "Footloose." His
charm is the opposite of that of the slick Robert Preston, who
originated -- and, in essence, has personified ever since -- the
"Music Man" role, and the casting has raised eyebrows in the
entertainment world. Zadan calls him "adorable," a word no one would
ever apply to Preston in the role.</TE>
<TE>   That's the appeal, Lyne says: "It's about how can we surprise both
[the audience and the critics] with the mix of casting." Broderick's
Marian the librarian will be Kristin Chenoweth, not as well known to
TV viewers but a darling of New York musical theater.</TE>
<TE>   As for the selling, Quinn Taylor, who oversees ABC's movie
department, calls Zadan and Meron "the single best marketing machine
in town." Lyne agrees: "Nobody is better at marketing their
material."</TE>
<TE>   For "Annie," they spent weeks fine-tuning a theatrical-length
trailer to send to reporters, something ABC had never done, to build
buzz for a project that wasn't going to be finished until very close
to its air date. They also have good relationships with many
important TV critics. Then there's the prodigious amount of e-mail
Zadan sends out with quotes from positive reviews (such as a recent
Liz Smith column devoted entirely to a rave about "Chicago") and news
of awards, wins or just nominations, an in-your-face approach that
rankles some. Zadan blames former Walt Disney Studios Chairman Peter
Schneider, who, he says, "screamed at us that we were sending too
many faxes" and insisted they start using e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   The ability to generate attention can make others want to get on
board. "I have not yet worked with any producers more adept at
getting publicity for themselves and their projects," said Kirk
Ellis, a journalist-turned-writer who has worked on three Storyline
projects, adding that, "I've been a beneficiary of that."</TE>
<TE>   "They come in with these great big branded titles and put every
breath into these movies," says Bela Bajaria, who runs CBS' movie
department. "They are so passionate about the movies they do,
sometimes working for years to get the rights to material. It's never
just for the gig; it really is about making this movie."</TE>
<TE>   Zadan and Meron say they are drawn to projects that have an untold
side, such as the love story in "Music Man," which they want to be
more believable in the ABC project than in the original play or
movie. "Perfect" movies aren't candidates for remakes: "We would
never do 'The Sound of Music,' " says Zadan.</TE>
<TE>   "Music Man" had a typical several years' long gestation, starting
in Zadan's Hollywood Hills living room in about 1998, just before the
revival of Meredith Willson's 1957 hit. The producers held a
star-cast read-through with Crystal as Hill; Bernadette Peters as
Marian; Shirley Jones, who played Marian in the 1962 film, as Mrs.
Paroo; Christine Ebersol and Edward Asner, among others; and catering
from Greenblatt's Deli on Sunset Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with the original show, "we realized there was a whole
other show here," says Meron, with a darker, more emotional second
half, and they committed the next day. Once they tapped Broderick for
the role, they had to wait more than a year for him to be freed up
from "The Producers."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview in New York in November, during a particularly
frenzied period when they were in town to finish up editing on
"Chicago" and with "The Music Man" still in post-production in Los
Angeles, the two vied collegially to tell their stories. Unlike many
partnerships that break down into a creative partner and a financial
one, both do all of the jobs at the business, although Meron
gravitates toward the prep work and hiring, while Zadan likes
post-production. "They can really take over, one for the other," says
Helen Verno, executive vice president, movies, at Sony Pictures
Television, where Storyline has had a long producing deal for films
such as "Martin and Lewis."</TE>
<TE>   On projects, say some who have worked with them, they use more of
a "good cop, bad cop" routine. When "Music Man" had some early
setbacks, Zadan fired off a middle-of-the-night e-mail suggesting
that the top behind-the-scenes team be fired (it wasn't). "They're
both good cops," says Sony's Verno, although she adds that "Neil
sometimes has a gentler approach and Craig sometimes has a firmer
approach."</TE>
<TE>   Despite some on-set tensions, the same directors and production
staff -- even those who have had contentious experiences -- tend to
work with them over and over, partly drawn to the scope of the
projects. Network executives have been known to get frustrated with
the process too. Bajaria says much can be allowed "when people are
that good at what they do and deliver the goods time after time."</TE>
<TE>   With successes to their credit, Zadan and Meron tend to get bigger
budgets to play with than the average TV movie producer. Lyne says
the two "have to work within the same budgetary constraints that
everybody else does," at least for event movies, but concedes that
Storyline pictures, which recoup some costs from video sales, aren't
done for the standard $3.2 million for two hours. The three-hour
"Music Man" will come in at more than $15 million, according to
people familiar with the numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted to make a film that would look good and be right for
the material," Ellis says of writing "The Beach Boys." He says he was
told to ignore traditional TV scale in writing the script and think
feature film; later, the team pared back to meet budget constraints.
"We did incredibly elaborate concert sequences with hundreds of
extras, instead of the usual four extras moving in front of and
behind the cameras over and over again," Ellis says.</TE>
<TE>   Not everything has been coming up roses recently. With the
"Fiddler on the Roof" remake, they started out with hopes of casting
Crystal and Bette Midler as Tevye and Golde. Instead, the
much-praised but lesser known Victor Garber -- who also had starring
roles in "The Music Man," "Life With Judy Garland," "Annie" and
"Cinderella," when not playing Jennifer Garner's slippery father on
"Alias" -- is expected to play Tevye and the Golde casting remains
undecided. ABC recently took the long-promised remake of "Mame," with
Barbara Streisand as an executive producer and Cher in the starring
roll, off its futures list because the much-delayed project hasn't
come together, although network sources said ABC would still like to
revive it.</TE>
<TE>   With bravado to rival Harold Hill's, Zadan and Meron haven't gone
timidly into their new ventures, many of which seem to have few
threads in common with the formula that has worked for Storyline so
far. Zadan rattles off a list of eight series with script orders at
Disney's Touchstone Television: five comedies and three dramas.
Series television, says Meron, is a way to "make a better living.
It's a great way of securing the future."</TE>
<TE>   Among the prospects: an hourlong drama set in the world of
gladiators. A dramedy about a young businesswoman who also must take
over her family business, which happens to be a Mafia family ("Sex
and the City" meets "The Sopranos," Zadan says). A half-hour
"anti-'Sex and the City' show about real Midwestern housewives." And
a sitcom, in its second go-round in development, about gay parents,
which would be groundbreaking if it gets on the air.</TE>
<TE>   There's also another theatrical film, based on Ray Bradbury's
futuristic novel "Fahrenheit 451," with Mel Gibson, as well as "a
slew" of family feature films for Disney, Zadan says. In addition to
"Fiddler" for ABC, the pair are working on a movie based on
"Ghostlight," New York Times columnist Frank Rich's memoir of growing
up fascinated by the theater, and a live-action "Hunchback of Notre
Dame," with new music from Stephen Schwartz and Alan Menken to
augment their original songs for the animated version.</TE>
<TE>   At CBS, a long-in-the-works biography of Ronald and Nancy Reagan
and a remake of "Butterflies Are Free" are in development.</TE>
<TE>   The list is lengthy for a reason, they say. "I made the most
tragic mistake of life after 'Footloose,' " Zadan says. He was new to
Hollywood in 1984 and focused for years on the movie, neglecting to
begin development of other projects. When "Footloose" was a hit "for
two seconds, I was a very hot producer. All the studios were wining
and dining me, and I had nothing to make." He began to put things in
development, but by then, he says, "people had moved on. It was a
really bad time for me in life. I wasn't able to capitalize on
'Footloose' at all and I never made that mistake again."</TE>
<TE>   Most imminently, there's "Veritas: The Quest," an "Indiana
Jones"-like show about a father and son's archeological adventures in
"search of the truth behind the mysteries of history and
civilization." With a tough 8 p.m. Monday time slot, up against CBS'
comedies, NBC's "Fear Factor" and the WB's family-friendly "7th
Heaven," industry observers are already speculating that it may be
short-lived. ABC's Lyne calls it "a really fun commercial program,"
but the network declined to make it available for viewing.</TE>
<TE>   It may also have the dubious distinction of being one of the most
expensive pilots ever, having started out as a $7-million, two-hour
movie that was cut to an hour. ABC was considering a lengthier
hourlong version without commercials, but in the end it will air with
ads. Zadan says the shorter version was chosen so the program could
air the night after ABC's Super Bowl broadcast.</TE>
<TE>   Lyne says she wasn't skittish about giving Zadan and Meron a shot
at a series despite their lack of experience in the genre. "I think
that they are smart enough producers and so committed to winning that
I had every confidence that what they didn't know about the series
business they would learn very fast. And they are: Day by day, week
by week, they are more assured in that arena. They are going to be
great series producers."</TE>
<TE>   Of more concern is the big pile of projects on their dance card.
"Of course I worry. I would love them to do nothing for anyone but
our network," Lyne says. "It's hard to reel them in because they are
in demand and they've worked hard to be able to cast this wide net."
But, she added, "they said they could do it and I do trust that if
they tell me they can pull it off, they will do it."</TE>

<LD>Craig Zadan and Neil Meron have helped to revive the musical genre in
film, executive producing "Chicago," a possible Oscar contender. But
they've been busiest as the leading producers of musicals and offbeat
programming on TV, including high-profile biographical movies and a
series due to premiere in January. Below, a sampling of these
projects.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "Veritas: The Quest" (premiering on ABC</LD>
<TE>   Jan. 27)</TE>
<TE>   The action-adventure series is Storyline's first leap into series
television under its deal with Disney's Touchstone Television.</TE>
<TE>   The show tells the story of a 17-year-old boy (Ryan Merriman) and
his archeologist father (Alex Carter) who discover the mysteries of
life together -- not unlike the classic animated series "Jonny
Quest." The show, developed by writers Patrick Massett and John
Zinman ("Lara Croft: Tomb Raider") and directed by Bryan Spicer, has
been described as a hybrid of "Alias" and "Raiders of the Lost Ark."</TE>
<TE>   To help launch the series, the network has moved Sunday-night
stalwart "The Practice" to 9 p.m. Mondays -- immediately following
"Veritas." The midseason show is one of several that ABC
Entertainment President Susan Lyne is counting on to reverse the
network's sagging fortunes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Life With Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows" (ABC, February 2001)</TE>
<TE>   Produced by the singer's younger daughter, Lorna Luft, it drew an
estimated 20.3 million viewers on opening night -- the largest
audience for a made-for-TV movie since CBS' "Jesus" in May 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Blanchard as the teenage Garland and Judy Davis as the adult
version both earned Emmy awards for their portrayal of the woman some
regard as Hollywood's greatest entertainer. Directed by Robert Allan
Ackerman, the ABC broadcast captured a total of five Emmys.</TE>
<TE>   Based on Luft's book "Life With Judy," the show presents a loving
portrait of a former vaudeville baby whose personal and professional
ups and downs continue from her ascent to stardom in the 1930s to her
death from a drug overdose in 1969 at age 47.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Beach Boys: An American Family (ABC, February 2000)</TE>
<TE>   This four-hour miniseries zoomed in on the band that defined the
California surf sound, while internal conflicts threatened to break
them apart. It focuses, in particular, on the emotional pain of
Brian, Carl and Dennis Wilson, and their father's attempt to sabotage
their lives.</TE>
<TE>   One of the producers of the project was sitcom actor John Stamos
("Full House") -- a drummer in a touring version of the band. He
originally planned to play Dennis but, by the time he signed a deal
with Storyline, he was too old for the part.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, newcomer Nick Stabile won the role with relative unknowns
Frederick Weller (Brian), Ryan Northcott (Carl), Matt Letscher (Mike
Love) and Ned Vaughn (Al Jardine) rounding out the cast.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone was impressed. "The actors may resemble the Beach
Boys, but when it's time to perform their songs, they're animatronic,
and when it's time to emote, they're unconvincing," said the Houston
Chronicle. Still, the network got healthy ratings with the shows,
which served up a good dose of '70s nostalgia.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Martin and Lewis" (CBS: November 2002)</TE>
<TE>   "Martin and Lewis" follows the tumultuous 10-year friendship
between Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin -- a brilliant comic team torn
apart by personal incompatibility. Written and directed by John Gray,
the movie tracks the duo in their prime -- when they shot 10 movies
and became a TV fixture.</TE>
<TE>   Critics praised both lead actors, who had to rely on film clips
because they were too young to remember the pair. Jeremy Northam
("Gosford Park") played the cool, detached Martin, while Emmy winner
Sean Hayes ("Will &amp; Grace") re-created the insecure Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis was reportedly unhappy about the project when it was in
development, but by the time it aired he had become one of its
strongest supporters.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>One pounded the keyboard next to Yo-Yo and bagged the top national
security job with Bush. The other grabbed an Oscar last March, then
bedded Bond this fall.</LD>
<LD>   One is attempting to save the free world by going nose to nose
with Saddam Hussein, the linchpin of the Axis of Evil. The other
actually does save the cinematic free world by thwarting an evil
renegade North Korean colonel who, thanks to the miracle of DNA
splicing and astute overseas casting, somehow winds up resembling a
demented, redheaded Hugh Grant.</LD>
<LD>   Condoleezza Rice and Halle Berry: the Newsweek profile subject and
the Cosmo cover girl. You probably won't ever find them swapping
fashion tips on Rodeo Drive or comparing missile throw-weights in the
West Wing.</LD>
<TE>   But last week at the Ralphs checkout counter there was Rice, the
first black woman ever to serve as national security advisor, in
modest, from-the-neck-up repose, complete with alpha stare and
U.S.-flag lapel pin. Right next to her on the magazine rack was
Berry, the first black woman to win a best actress Academy Award,
complete with flattering bare shoulders and a typical Cosmo come-on
headline promising "Her Most Honest Interview Ever." Even so, Berry's
pose was as much about power as about pulchritude.</TE>
<TE>   Black women haven't had an easy time attaining such uncontested
prominence, either in politics or pop culture. Sometimes their public
triumphs are woefully short-lived, as in the sad cases of C. Lani
Guinier and Joycelyn Elders, both the beneficiaries of
equal-opportunity dumping by their putative advocate, Bill Clinton,
when the going got tough.</TE>
<TE>   Even after serving as Stanford University provosts or snapping up
gold statuettes, black women may find themselves still pounding on
the door, hoping the Washington or Hollywood establishment will
finally invest in them the trust and responsibility they have earned.
Now, for a change, someone has.</TE>
<TE>   "That's something very different for a white man, I believe, to
put their trust in a black woman," says Lundeana Thomas, who teaches
African American theater at the University of Louisville. "For
President Bush, he's not only saying, 'I trust you with my life,'
[he's saying] 'I trust you with my country.' Putting the whole
country's defense into this black woman's hands. That's a lot. And
the jury's still out on whether she's doing a great job or whatever.
My thing is, she's maintaining."</TE>
<TE>   "Black, Brainy and Bush's Secret Weapon" is the way Newsweek touts
its 10-page portrait of "The Real Condi Rice." Substitute Bond (James
Bond) for Bush, and you've got an instant copy block for posters of
"Die Another Day," the umpteenth 007 flick, in which Berry co-stars
opposite Pierce Brosnan.</TE>
<TE>   In Newsweek's profile, we learn that Rice has won over the
president by keeping peace among the Bush inner circle. Between
confronting Al Qaeda and shopping Saks Fifth Avenue, Rice somehow
found time earlier this year to perform a duet with cellist Yo-Yo Ma
(she's a recital-quality pianist). The magazine can't help tattling
about Rice's "weakness" for Ferragamo pumps, but it also features a
photo of her pumping iron.</TE>
<TE>   We've also learned that Berry, her academy accolades
notwithstanding, had to win over her "Die Another Day"
partner-in-mayhem. According to at least one published report,
Brosnan had briefly wondered if Berry had the requisite acting craft
to hold her own against prior Bond heroines. (Having the requisite
dimensions for an Ursula Andress-style retro bikini was apparently
never a problem.) In the movie, Berry's wise-cracking, butt-whipping
character, Jinx, is presented as Bond's secret-agent equal, and she
even takes the aggressor's role in their obligatory undercover
interlude.</TE>
<TE>   "I think one of the things that I admire about Halle Berry is that
she knows how to use her image and to use it in ways that benefit
her," says L.A. fiction writer Paula L. Woods, author of "Inner City
Blues" and "Stormy Weather: A Charlotte Justice Novel." "I thought
her performance in ["Die Another Day"] was masterful, saucy and with
that little bit of innuendo."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, diving off cliffs and blowing up bad guys isn't
remotely as dangerous as trying to juggle the competing egos and
agendas of Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, et al. But Berry's
accomplishments go deeper. After winning the Oscar for "Monster's
Ball" last spring, she gracefully rode out a heated debate over
whether her sex scenes with Billy Bob Thornton reinforced or
shattered old cultural stereotypes of black women.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Berry may have helped save the ailing Bond franchise, which
has been stuck on cruise control since the late 1970s, trying to
breeze by on Oxford-inflected insouciance and bad double-entendres.
Bond's bosses finally realize it's a tricky planet out there, and
middle-age white guys can't expect to run the whole show by
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "Die Another Day" had a strong opening weekend and has been
holding up well at the box office. Brosnan's temples may be graying
suavely, but the series had been having trouble attracting teens,
young adults and women to its martini-dry, Cold War worldview --
until now. Already there are plans to create a Jinx spinoff
franchise.</TE>
<TE>   Woods says it's tough for any popular image of a woman to "embody
the brain, the brawn and the beauty" simultaneously, "but I think it
becomes exacerbated when you lay race on top of it." Why, she asks,
is Rice considered a "secret weapon" when "anyone who follows foreign
affairs knows she's intimately involved in [Bush's] foreign policy
and is one of the people he relies on."</TE>
<TE>   "I think the challenge for Condoleezza Rice," Woods concludes, "is
how is she going to manage her image." Will she be like Halle Berry,
or like Guinier, Elders and Anita Hill, who reluctantly found others
creating an image for them?</TE>
<TE>   Rice "can't control what Newsweek says, she can't control the way
they take a photograph," Woods says. "But I think she was almost
masterful in that she didn't give them anything she didn't want them
to know."</TE>
<TE>   Which is prudent, perhaps, now that saving the world, like making
a hit movie, seems a lot more complicated than it used to.</TE>

<HD>Success won't pay the bills</HD>
<DH>As it nears its 10th birthday, Diavolo Dance Theater has
solid bookings, a major commission and a new home -- but looks can
deceive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Victoria Looseleaf</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Diavolo Dance Theater is all about risk. Its director, Jacques Heim,
sends his dancers plunging off 7-foot-tall jungle gyms, cavorting
down a giant wooden staircase on skis, bicycles and boogie boards, or
ricocheting across a vertical pegboard like human pinballs.</LD>
<LD>   And then there's the biggest risk of all: keeping afloat a
full-time dance company -- one that regularly tours, unveils new
work, pays its dancers a salary and does it all based in dance-poor
L.A.</LD>
<LD>   As the company approaches its 10-year anniversary, its risk-taking
has largely paid off. Since 1999, it has mounted annual national
tours (this season, 30 cities are on the schedule); kept its dancers
in paychecks for 30 weeks of the year and, as of August, set itself
up in its own rehearsal/performing space, 6,000 square feet of
wide-open loft, with lockers, and a new dancer-friendly floor at the
Brewery Complex in downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   On top of all that, Heim has been tapped to choreograph Cirque du
Soleil's next permanent show in Las Vegas (scheduled to open in
2004). But none of that has tamed the risk.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though we look like a million-dollar company," explained
Parisian-born Heim in his heavily accented English in mid-December,
"yesterday I realized I couldn't pay my dancers, because our
operating cost is so high. It's a tough time."</TE>
<TE>   The paycheck situation, according to Heim, is mostly a temporary
cash-flow problem. The troupe's new digs, which Heim says are
necessary because of the scale of a work-in-progress, "DreamCatcher,"
almost tripled the company's rent and cost it $20,000 in renovation
fees.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Diavolo picks up its performing and touring schedule
(first gig: Pepperdine University, Jan. 16, then on the road, and
then back in L.A. in May), which will help cover bills. The new space
will also be put to use for paid workshops and some performances.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, fundraising is proceeding at a furious pace; if
necessary, Heim says, the company will take out a loan. The dancers
have forgone one check before going on a planned four-week hiatus.</TE>
<TE>   "Not getting a paycheck put a slight damper on Christmas," said
four-year Diavolo dancer Monica Campbell, "but Diavolo attracts the
kind of people who are willing to work for nothing. That's why we all
stick around. 'DreamCatcher' is built, and I know we already have
bookings for next year. There is light on the horizon."</TE>
<TE>   The problem, says Heim, is keeping the momentum going.</TE>
<TE>   "The first five years were difficult, but the next five are the
real challenge," he said, shaking his head and his long gray
ponytail.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Are you going to continue or are you going to fold?' We've come
to a big hump and we need to create a bridge to go over the bad
water."</TE>
<TE>   Heim founded Diavolo in 1992, a year after earning a master's in
choreography from CalArts. He was 27, a graduate of street performing
in France, and had already established his signature style: one part
modern movement and one part acrobatics. Another trademark: the use
of a structural prop, a set piece off which the dancers literally
bounce.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, the company's eight dancers, actors and acrobats proved a
critical hit at Edinburgh's Fringe Festival. The same year Diavolo
received three Lester Horton awards, the Los Angeles dance
community's annual awards, for its Magritte-influenced farce "Tete en
L'Air."</TE>
<TE>   The company continued to play a variety of Los Angeles venues,
including UCLA's Schoenberg and Royce halls, and rack up Hortons (the
company has nine; Heim has three for choreography). It was producing
a new work about every two years (the pieces are labor intensive to
create and mount) but it was still operating at the stripped-down
level common to most L.A. dance companies: minimal overhead, no
salaries. Everything was paid for on a per performance or per project
basis.</TE>
<TE>   Budget grows twentyfold</TE>
<TE>   The first turning point came in 1999, says Heim, when he hooked up
with manager David Lieberman, who also represents Merce Cunningham
Dance Company.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman began getting the troupe national bookings, and despite
the costs of touring, more performances -- the creation of a market
that is larger than just Los Angeles -- meant the earned-income
coffers grew.</TE>
<TE>   Exposure paid off with donors and grant makers, among them the
California-based James Irvine Foundation and Brody Foundation
Fellowships. Diavolo even established a fan base in Japan, and
recruited a "road company" for a two-month run in that country,
adding to the company's income.</TE>
<TE>   Heim says that Diavolo's budget before 1999 was $30,000; in '99 it
grew to $100,000. This fiscal year the budget is $700,000.</TE>
<TE>   A chunk of the budget increase comes from a commission for the new
work, which is itself a result of the upward trajectory of the
company. "DreamCatcher," which will premiere at the Carpenter Center
in Long Beach in October, is a commission from eight presenters
across the country that have liked Diavolo's work on tour. They put
up enough money to cover the considerable cost of the work's new set
piece -- an $80,000, 16-foot-tall tubular aluminum wheel with
webbing, a giant modernist version of a Native American dreamcatcher,
the circular feather-and-string object meant to separate bad dreams
from good ones.</TE>
<TE>   Those commissioners will each present the piece during its
"premiere" tour starting next fall and, after that, Heim hopes that
it will go on to be booked to a wider touring audience.</TE>
<TE>   That's a model that Heim would like to see repeated -- commissions
that help defray expensive start-up costs with a built-in tour as
well -- but only as long as he can balance the rest of the overhead
to make it work.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. County Arts Commission Executive Director Laura Zucker
presents, among other things, dance at the John Anson Ford
Amphitheatre. Numerous arts organizations have cash-flow problems,
she says. "It's hard to establish a cash reserve, an endowment.
Companies have to find different strategies to survive successfully."</TE>
<TE>   " 'DreamCatcher' is an apt title," says Jordan Peimer, program
director at the Skirball Cultural Center and a former Diavolo board
member. "It's about the ability to keep the dream up in the air."</TE>
<TE>   No town for football or dance</TE>
<TE>   Heim faults himself for the fact that this month too many bills
came all at once, as he puts it. But he also points out that the
safety net for dance in L.A. is virtually nonexistent.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, what's missing is a support system," he said, lamenting
L.A.'s attitude toward dance. "It's a bit like saying there's not a
football team here. It's a scandal. L.A. should have a major dance
company, whether it's a major modern company or a major ballet
company."</TE>
<TE>   New York City, the capital of U.S. dance, is a place where
companies also struggle to survive financially -- even powerhouse
American Ballet Theatre has had to trim its season back in the face
of falling donations post-Sept. 11 and in the wake of a bad economy.
But it has the sort of infrastructure that Heim says doesn't exist in
L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Consider New York's Dance Theater Workshop, which recently built a
new, $9-million facility. The workshop presents 50 artists a year and
also serves another 900 artists with studios and media labs, with an
emphasis on emerging and mid-career artists.</TE>
<TE>   David White, executive director and producer of DTW, notes that
"everybody has financial Sturm und Drang now."</TE>
<TE>   Like Heim, he sees L.A.'s problem as deeper than money. "Dance as
an art form requires a friction of community -- people sharing
studios, dressing rooms, backbiting, kibitzing and all that stuff.
L.A. has a dance community, but it doesn't act like a dance
community. L.A. is the sum total of a lot of smaller communities."</TE>
<TE>   Heim has hopes that the Music Center's renewed interest in dance
might create more of a local focus for the art form. When the
Philharmonic moves to Walt Disney Concert Hall in the fall, it will
open stage space for other kinds of programming. Heim is already
booked to dance at the Ahmanson Theatre in May as part of the
center's efforts to add more dance to the mix at Grand Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had a home at the Ahmanson," says Heim, fantasizing, "and
were performing there every two years, there would be an awareness
among L.A. audiences. We could build a bigger mailing list and create
bigger fundraising."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Heim likens his dancers to warriors, and not just
because of the moves they are required to do. They have to be, as he
says, "in top shape and not be afraid of heights and blood."</TE>
<TE>   The whole company has to apply the same fearlessness to keeping
Diavolo on its feet in hard times, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like going into war -- put on a warm coat, get food and a
backpack, put your goggles on and good luck."</TE>

<HD>Passing the torch from one explorer to another</HD>
<DH>Nicolas Cage directs James Franco in 'Sonny,' a role Cage
once sought.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter McQuaid</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It had to happen. It's the way things go when they go the way they
should: A young, edgy, adventurous actor has a role in mind --
something he's been dying to do. And one day, the actor, who has
aged, confronts the role, which hasn't, and if he has any sense of
himself -- and any taste at all -- knows it's time to let it go.</LD>
<LD>   Or, if you're Nicolas Cage, time to take the director's chair and
give a younger, promising actor -- in this case, James Franco -- a
shot.</LD>
<LD>   Sitting at the patio restaurant at the Avalon Hotel in Los
Angeles, Cage is way better-looking in person than on screen. Polite,
thoughtful, beautifully turned out in a sport jacket and slacks. He
listens. He lights other people's cigarettes. His hair is slightly
thinning on top. (Much has been made of Cage's thinning hair; in
person, it adds a note of masculine urbanity that is probably the
only note he hasn't struck with his acting jobs.) He exudes
earnestness and sincerity.</LD>
<TE>   Which, for a snarky reporter, is like chum to a shark. In this Age
of Irony, however, Cage's sincerity is a refreshing alternative to
the usual cover-yourself blather that is often the main course in
these discussions.</TE>
<TE>   Franco is not as good-looking in person as he is in movies. And
that's a good thing, too. Franco has to work hard not to read as a
full-lipped, come-hither Calvin Klein model. In real life, he's
rougher around the edges, hinting at a maturity that, if he lives up
to his promise, could encompass a whole spectrum of opportunities --
even ugly people.</TE>
<TE>   At this moment, both actors are at work promoting "Sonny," Cage's
directorial debut, which stars Franco in the title role as a Bourbon
Street brothel-reared escort who returns home from the Army to try to
break free of "the life."  Brenda Blethyn plays his mother, Jewel, a
madam and also his pimp, who is dead set against his breaking free.
Mena Suvari is a female prostitute Jewel has recruited and installed
in Sonny's old room. Brenda Vaccaro plays one of Sonny's socialite
clients and Harry Dean Stanton does a poignant turn as Jewel's beau.
Whenever possible, Cage used local actors in supporting roles, and
contented himself with playing a gay pimp with a taste for cocaine
and fashion in the Monte Rock vein. (Cage got to make use of a
retina-scorching yellow jacket that once belonged to Liberace.) Set
in New Orleans and shot on a shoestring (Cage used his home there for
interiors), "Sonny" is a sympathetic look at a slice of life most
Americans come into contact with only peripherally.</TE>
<TE>   It was a script Hollywood was aware of only peripherally for many
years. Cage himself had the script for 15.</TE>
<TE>   "Richard Gere had passed on it to do 'American Gigolo,' " he says.
"I found myself very emotionally connected to it and compelled by it
and I wanted to play the part myself, but I couldn't find a director
to commit to it. Barbet Schroeder came close but decided to do
'Barfly' instead, and the script went back on the shelf.</TE>
<TE>   "The subject matter wasn't the sort of thing studios were
gravitating toward" -- which may be the understatement of the year
for Hollywood in the '80s -- "even though The Times called it one of
the Top 10 Never Produced Scripts" in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   "I forgot about it and moved on. I had thought about directing
something actor-driven and about family, and one night I was in bed
and the light went off: 'I wonder where that script is?' "</TE>
<TE>   The market had most definitely changed as well, thanks to the
explosion of interest (and dollars) in extra-studio filmmaking, and
an increasingly sophisticated public willing to consider thornier
subject matter.</TE>
<TE>   Still, no one was exactly throwing money at him, Cage says. "Most
people didn't want to bite or put the money into it, but Paul Brooks
had worked with me [as a producer] on 'Shadow of the Vampire.' 'Big
Fat Greek Wedding' notwithstanding, he wasn't afraid to take a chance
on something bold and unconventional." Which is also why, Franco
says, he jumped at the chance to work with Cage. "From what I had
heard, I knew he wouldn't be afraid to try things."</TE>
<TE>   Comfort levels</TE>
<TE>   For certain, Cage has never been afraid to try things -- sometimes
to great acclaim, other times to ridicule. He seems comfortable with
that.</TE>
<TE>   If Franco's answers are any indication, he is still warming up to
the notion of public exposure. He is painstaking, complete,
definitive in his answers.</TE>
<TE>   When asked what appealed to him about the project, he answers:
"Uhhm, the role had tremendous dramatic possibilities, very eccentric
kind of role annnnd, he lives in a world the script depicts in a way
we haven't seen.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew Nic was doing it, and some of my favorite roles of his
were men who had a very difficult time integrating into the normal
world for one reason or another. And because he had considered
playing the role himself ... I figured he'd have great insight into
it."</TE>
<TE>   Cage admits he had been unaware of Franco's previous work --
"Spider-Man," "City by the Sea" and the cable movie "Dean" -- but
warmed up to him immediately.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted the person I met in my office. I had heard about James
and I thought his face told a story. He was very enthusiastic. I was
very impressed by the emotion that was at his fingertips. He can turn
on a dime and get to this very intense, emotional, vulnerable and, at
the same time, dangerous place."</TE>
<TE>   No question, Franco is asked to embody an explosive mix of rage
and longing when Sonny's naivete about "squares" is shattered. It's
dangerous territory for any actor and a minor miscalculation -- in
just one scene -- can send a promising young actor, or even a
veteran, straight to the "Mommy Dearest" Camp Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   Cage was confident that wouldn't happen. "I never wanted to block
anything James was working on or calm him down. I tried to cultivate
a set where actors would feel safe with me to explore. I think being
an actor is a very vulnerable thing; you're asked to bare your soul
in front of people. It was a set where the people working with us
would respect what James was doing.</TE>
<TE>   "James would come in and I would let him do whatever he wanted in
the first four takes. And then I had some ideas I wanted to try. I
certainly like extreme situations, I like to dance there and he's
able to go there. And he would come in with ideas and he was right. I
trusted him."</TE>
<TE>   Originally set in the '60s in Lafayette, La., the script by John
Carlen was updated to 1981 and the action moved to New Orleans. (A
legal dispute with another writer over authorship was settled, and
the Writers Guild awarded Carlen sole credit.)</TE>
<TE>   Cage's rationale for the changes was that "I didn't know the '60s.
I knew the '80s and it was my time." As for moving the action to New
Orleans: "There's a buzz to the city, and the music is wafting out on
the street 24 hours a day. There's so much to do indoors, so when it
goes outside I want there to be a buzz to it, and New Orleans is like
a character unto itself. And I thought, 'How interesting if a
character grew up on Bourbon Street. What would that do to him and
his family?' " For his part, Franco, who grew up in an artistic
family in Palo Alto, was a stranger to being "turned out," so he and
Cage set to work meeting the Crescent City's male sex workers.</TE>
<TE>   "There were all types, and people were into it for all different
reasons," Franco says. "Some felt it was a chosen lifestyle. Some
were trapped in this business and tried to leave but wouldn't make a
fraction of the money, and with Sonny it was emotional reasons as
well."</TE>
<TE>   "It was interesting seeing the different dynamics," adds Cage. "It
was almost like therapy. Figuring out what one person might need to
give them pleasure and passion.... James and I came to the idea of
him being able to clock what a woman's fantasy might be. The
perception wasn't really seen as something to hurt, but to give some
relief or aid or help in their clients' loneliness."</TE>
<TE>   Cage shies away from drawing any moral conclusions about this
subject matter -- on the record or in the movie.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to present something without judgment and let the
situation unfold in a way that seemed truthful, rather than moral.
These are people, and they have feelings and emotions, thoughts, and
they can be hurt just like anyone else. I really think it's up to
people's interpretation. Let them be the judge. I don't want to
impinge on anyone's secret discoveries; anyone's interpretation is
valid. The story has its own life now.</TE>
<TE>   "I was at a screening, and there was this elderly couple in front
of me and the man was like 'Oh, my God! What is he doing?' and the
woman was like 'Ssssshhhh! It's her fantasy, it's her fantasy.' And
she got it in that regard and I thought that was cool."</TE>
<TE>   Both actors have an agenda. For Franco, "it's my big development
period, though that may never change." On the other hand, Cage, at
40, is looking for his second creative wind.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to go through something of a renaissance in my work,
not be comfortable with what I do, stay on the high wire, if I fall
that's OK. If I can do something without judgment and people can make
their own conclusions. I hope I can keep doing that, take the chances
I want to take, and learn and grow."</TE>

<HD>Frayed treasures woven together</HD>
<DH>The Southwest Museum's collection of Native American
textiles is enormous, esteemed and largely unresearched. A new book
hints at the big picture.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Suzanne Muchnic</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The trials and tribulations of the Southwest Museum have been widely
chronicled in the past decade. If the beloved but chronically
underfunded institution wasn't reeling from the misdeeds of former
director Patrick Houlihan -- who in 1993 was convicted of selling
valuable baskets, textiles and paintings from the museum's collection
-- it was desperately seeking a sugar daddy who never materialized.</LD>
<LD>   During the past year, most of the news has spun off a controversy
over the museum's possible partnership with the Pechanga band of
Luiseno Indians in Riverside County or the Autry Museum of Western
Heritage in Griffith Park. The matter was settled in late November,
when trustees of the Southwest and Autry voted to merge. Touted as a
union of cowboys and Indians, the new arrangement will put the
impoverished, 95-year-old Southwest Museum under the umbrella of a
14-year-old institution with a $100-million endowment.</LD>
<LD>   What has been at stake in this long-running drama is the Southwest
Museum's 350,000-piece collection, which is one of world's best
holdings of Native American art and artifacts. But beyond noting the
collection's priceless value and high reputation, the news hasn't
offered much insight into what, exactly, is in the collection or why
its endangered status has struck such fear in the hearts of the
cultural cognoscenti.</LD>
<TE>   The collection is so vast that it may never be fully displayed or
studied, but a hefty new publication delivers a ray of light along
with hope for the future. Underway for the past 10 years -- and
supported by a patchwork of grants, goodwill and hard work -- this
massive research project reveals what some of the fuss is about.</TE>
<TE>   "Southwest Textiles: Weavings of the Navajo and Pueblo" presents
more than 250 Native American textiles, photographed in color and
described in detail, between the covers of a handsome new book. But
behind every book, there's a story. And this one is particularly
complicated.</TE>
<TE>   The textiles were woven as blankets, rugs, tapestries, ponchos and
dresses in a profusion of geometric patterns or pictorial narratives.
The compositions range from relatively simple stripes to bands of
zigzags, checkerboards and diamonds. Over the years, natural dyes
were supplemented with yarns in synthetic hues, and the artists'
compositional vocabulary expanded to include flags and maps of the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   All these woven works were collected over 100 years by dozens of
people who admired them as art or wanted to preserve remnants of a
"dying culture" but knew little about the culture itself. Usually
buying and gleaning tidbits of information from dealers, the
collectors rarely met the weavers. Inevitably, the documentation that
accompanied their donations was sketchy at best.</TE>
<TE>   Had the museum been wealthier and more professionally managed when
the bulk of its collection was gathered, the staff probably would
have filled in some of the gaps. But as the Southwest's art holdings
grew, its financial resources dwindled. Meanwhile, the textiles piled
up in the tower of the museum's Spanish revival building on Mt.
Washington. Curators could barely see the weavings, much less do the
research required for a scholarly catalog.</TE>
<TE>   All that may change now that the Southwest Museum is merging with
the Autry. If the partnership evolves as planned, the textile book
will be one in a series of major publications on the Southwest's
collections, museum director Duane King said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, "Southwest Textiles" is the first and it's a
publishing landmark. It was written by Kathleen Whitaker, who was
chief curator at the Southwest Museum from 1991 to 2000 and now
directs the Indian Arts Research Center at the School of American
Research in Santa Fe, N.M. It contains essays on the colorful
characters who founded the museum and shaped its collections, a list
of donors and a glossary, along with a page or two on each of the
textiles. An accompanying CD-ROM provides an analysis of the fiber
and construction of weavings featured in the book and a complete
inventory of the museum's 2,160-piece textile collection.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first major treatment of our Native American textiles
since 1934," King said, referring to a classic publication on Navajo
weaving by Charles Avery Amsden, the museum's curator and
secretary-treasurer from 1927 to 1941. "And this far surpasses that.
It's a definitive work, with as much information as could be put into
a single volume."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest challenge was finding time to do the project, Whitaker
said. But far from the only challenge. The book wouldn't have been
published if she and her associates hadn't solved daunting physical
problems and dug up answers to hundreds of questions, or if the
Norman F. Sprague Jr. and Mildred E. and Harvey S. Mudd foundations
hadn't provided the funds.</TE>
<TE>   The project started in 1992 with a grant from the National
Endowment for the Arts to photograph 200 of the more than 1,300
Navajo rugs and blankets in the museum's collection, Whitaker said.
As she selected examples to be documented, she became aware of
conservation problems throughout the collection of Navajo and Pueblo
textiles and decided a thorough survey was needed. A 1994 grant from
the Institute of Museum and Library Services launched the
conservation study. During the same year, the Ahmanson Foundation
provided funds for a three-year lease of a space in Pasadena, where
the staff could spread out the textiles, examine them, recommend
cleaning and treatment, and plan a new storage system.</TE>
<TE>   By 1996, work was well underway but far from complete. "We are
indebted to the Ahmanson Foundation for extending its grant for three
more years," Whitaker said. With additional help from the NEA and a
private donor, the textiles are now rolled on acid-free tubes,
wrapped in protective sleeves and stored on metal racks at the
museum, where scholars have easy access to them.</TE>
<TE>   While the conservation work was underway, research produced new
information about many items in the collection. Chemical tests on
fibers and dyes helped curators establish dates of manufacture.
Classic publications on Navajo and Pueblo textiles by Amsden and
George Wharton James, along with many other printed sources, helped
to clear up questions about the works' origins and provenance.</TE>
<TE>   "We reviewed each museum piece in terms of our records on its
cultural origin and date of manufacture, and then compared our
findings to information in every previous publication," Whitaker
said, recalling an intense period of fact-checking and discovery.</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, she and her associates had little to go on. "Once
something is transferred out of the hands of its maker, the last
thing we usually know -- and maybe the only thing -- is who the buyer
was and how much was paid for it," she said. "That's the way of the
world in material culture."</TE>
<TE>   The book proves her point and can make a present-day collector
weep. A Navajo rug with a complex crystal pattern could be purchased
for about $1 a square foot in 1911. Relatively simple blankets worn
by Navajo women could be had for $5 apiece in 1929. A late 19th
century Navajo "eyedazzler" tapestry, with a serrated diamond motif
outlined in contrasting colors, cost $30 in 1943.</TE>
<TE>   Other pieces were more highly valued. Charles Fletcher Lummis, who
founded the Southwest Museum in 1907, began collecting historic and
contemporary Native American textiles in the 1880s and bequeathed 34
of them to the museum. Among the finest is a Navajo poncho made
between 1840 and 1859. In a 1925 book by Lummis, he doesn't reveal
the amount he paid, but says he bought the poncho "in 1889, after
weeks of diplomacy." The seller, Martin de Valle, who was governor of
Acoma Pueblo, "bought it 30 years earlier from a Navajo war-chief for
a lot of ponies and turquoise."</TE>
<TE>   A Navajo serape from the same period, also purchased from De
Valle, "is worth two hundred dollars, and not a dozen of them could
be bought at any price," Lummis wrote. "You can easily reckon that
the thread in it cost something, at six dollars a pound, and the
weaving occupied a Navajo woman for many months."</TE>
<TE>   Lummis was a writer, photographer, ethnologist and an editor at
The Times who left his home in Chillicothe, Ohio, in 1884 and walked
to Los Angeles, arriving the following year and settling into an
unorthodox lifestyle. He traveled widely in the Southwest and kept a
daily journal, in which he wrote about his passion for traditional
Native American textiles.</TE>
<TE>   He had enthusiasm for the Indians he met and what he called their
"primitive" existence. The museum's archives contain a photograph of
a barefoot Lummis in a Navajo poncho and another of him posing with a
group of Navajos at El Alisol, his home in the Arroyo Seco. Still,
like many collectors at the time, he bought and sold textiles
according to his taste and was more dilettante than scholar.</TE>
<TE>   The museum's collection evolved through the generosity of many,
including Anita M. Baldwin, daughter of "Lucky" Elias Jackson
Baldwin, who built Santa Anita racetrack in Arcadia and named it
after her, and Fred Kimpton Hinchman, a Southwest curator who built a
huge personal collection and donated 311 textiles to the museum.</TE>
<TE>   The benefactors range from vacationers who picked up souvenirs on
their travels through Indian country to those who tailored their
acquisitions to a serious purpose. Most of the donors, however, kept
incomplete and inaccurate records, especially when it came to the
artists themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Amsden, a Harvard-educated archeologist and ethnologist who
elevated the museum's professional stature during his 14-year
curatorial tenure, was an expert in Navajo textiles, but even he was
rarely involved with the weavers or Navajo society.</TE>
<TE>   "They were interested in the objects, not the people who made
them," Whitaker said.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the artists' names have not survived with their work.
"Language played a role in that," Whitaker said. "The collectors
couldn't speak to Indians and couldn't understand or write their
names."</TE>
<TE>   One thing the researchers could do was add ethnographic names of
textiles to the English versions in the book. A Navajo pictorial rug,
for example, is a beeldlei; a Hopi white cotton kilt is a kokom
vitkuna. "We tried to incorporate the native voice," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Praising Whitaker's accomplishment, King said her book "will have
a shelf life for centuries." But she makes no such claim.</TE>
<TE>   "We did as much as we could in the time available," she said. "But
this is such a phenomenal collection, it could be researched
forever."</TE>

<LD>Record executives are combing high schools and college towns looking
for the next Avril Lavigne or John Mayer, hoping that interest in
singer-songwriters doesn't wane before they can get their albums out.</LD>
<LD>   Radio programmers are trying to avoid being caught with songs that
have outstayed their welcome, a time period that seems to be getting
ever shorter.</LD>
<LD>   And record-store buying supervisors are looking for, well,
anything. As one put it, "A good trend would be people coming into
the stores instead of downloading."</LD>
<TE>   It's a time of wishing and hoping and praying in the music biz, a
time of transition, and a time when it's hard to get experts to give
predictions about what's on the horizon.</TE>
<TE>   "The theme for the first part of the year will be, 'What is the
new world order of rock?' " says Bob Bell, senior pop buyer for the
Wherehouse chain.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be new albums from Linkin Park, Staind, Limp Bizkit
and Deftones, bands that have been huge in recent years, and it will
be interesting to see if the Strokes and the White Stripes have
stolen their thunder," he said "And with Metallica, it may be the old
guard that rules."</TE>
<TE>   Country music is looking hopefully to fresh faces, with the big
guns (Shania Twain, Faith Hill, Tim McGraw and the Dixie Chicks)
having released their new albums in the past few months.</TE>
<TE>   "Country is changing," says Tonya Campos, music director of L.A.
country station KZLA-FM (93.9). "Not enough time has gone by for it
to develop into the next thing it's going to change into. Who knows?
With listeners and programmers, it's about the song right now, not
about the name. Even with Faith and Shania and Tim, the first songs
that came out did not test well."</TE>
<TE>   And hip-hop and R&amp;B?</TE>
<TE>   "What we're seeing is, with so much product in the market, the
turnover is very high," says Dorsey Fuller, music director of L.A.
urban station KKBT-FM (100.3). There "used to be a longer shelf life
for most records. Now we find we have to expose the flavor-of-the-day
record until the new flavor comes in, and the turnover is a lot
quicker than it used to be."</TE>
<TE>   There's even cross-genre experimentation going on. KZLA has had
surprise success with the Kid Rock-Sheryl Crow duet "Picture," while
at hip-hop KPWR-FM (105.9), music director E Man reports tremendous
interest in rhythmic tracks from pop acts (JC Chasez of 'N Sync) and
rock bands (Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit).</TE>

<TE>   Handicapping the new releases</TE>
<TE>   When asked to gaze into crystal balls and pick the
most-anticipated new releases for 2003, radio and retail
representatives were tentative at best with their selections. With
their help, though, we've handicapped the races for the first months
of the new year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rock</TE>
<TE>   Win -- Linkin Park, title to be announced, due March 25. The L.A.
band's debut was the biggest-selling album of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Place -- Metallica, title TBA, tentatively due in June. Inside
word is the veteran band's new music is its rawest yet.</TE>
<TE>   Show -- Limp Bizkit, title and release date TBA. A lot of mystery
surrounds this, from how the band will compensate for the loss of
guitarist Wes Borland to the musical direction (rock versus hip-hop).
"I think everyone wants to see what Fred [Durst] will do next," says
Lisa Worden, music director of KROQ-FM (106.7).</TE>
<TE>   Worth watching -- AFI, Staind, Rancid, Deftones, White Stripes,
Strokes, Mars Volta, Zwan.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pop</TE>
<TE>   Win -- Beyonce Knowles, "Dangerously in Love," Feb. 11. Producers
for the debut from the Destiny's Child star include the Neptunes,
Missy Elliott and Timbaland.</TE>
<TE>   Place -- JC Chasez, title and release TBA. The initial success of
Justin Timberlake's debut solo break from the Backstreet Boys is a
good omen for this 'N Sync-er's solo foray. Tentative plans are for
Chasez to finish the album in March. His Dallas Austin-produced
single, "Blowin Me Up (With Her Love)" from the "Drumline"
soundtrack, is off to a strong start.</TE>
<TE>   Show -- Celine Dion, "A New Day," March. Max Martin, Peer Anstrom,
Rick Wake and Umberto Gatica have all been producing tracks for the
collection, which is expected to be released in conjunction with the
opening of Dion's concert production in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Worth watching -- Madonna, Robbie Williams, Ricky Martin, Lauryn
Hill.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hip-hop</TE>
<TE>   Win -- 50 Cent, "Get Rich or Die Trying," TBA.</TE>
<TE>   Place -- Fabolos, "Street Dreams," March 25.</TE>
<TE>   Show -- Ashanti, title and release TBA. Ubiquitous in 2002, the
singer will record a new album in early 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Worth watching -- Ice Cube, newly signed to former N.W.A partner
Dr. Dre's Aftermath label.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   R&amp;B</TE>
<TE>   Win -- Beyonce Knowles</TE>
<TE>   Place -- R. Kelly, "Chocolate Factory," Jan. 28. With the crooner
still facing child pornography charges in Chicago, there are many
uncertainties about his public support and his availability to
perform and promote the album. But the curiosity factor is very high.</TE>
<TE>   Show -- Mary J. Blige, title TBA, June. Reunites the singer with
executive producer Sean "P. Diddy" Combs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Country</TE>
<TE>   Win -- Aaron Lines, "Living Out Loud," Jan. 7. With the focus on
new artists, this Canadian rookie is turning heads with a great voice
showcased on the country Top 10 single "You Can't Hide Beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   Place -- Carolyn Dawn Johnson, title and release TBA. Another
Canadian, Johnson earned the Academy of Country Music best new female
talent award for her 2001 debut, "A Room With a View."</TE>
<TE>   Show -- Brad Paisley, title and release TBA. The West Virginian is
ready to step into country's top ranks.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Gone but not forgotten</LD>
<LD>   It may be only a phantom city, but demolished Los Angeles has
enough points of interest to keep any tour guide busy.</LD>
<LD>   Last year's demolition records show that residential buildings
outnumber commercial buildings (mirroring citywide patterns) and that
permits for new housing units outnumber demo permits by more than 4
to 1. However, as affordable-housing advocates note, the new units
are typically pricier than the old. Among structures that were
targeted for wrecking in 2001:</LD>
<TE>   Absences of note</TE>
<TE>   Outside Los Angeles city limits, county government devotes less
staff time to preservation than City Hall does, and several other
cities have seen controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Irving Gill's Dodge House came crashing down in 1969, in part
because it lay just outside Los Angeles city limits, in
then-unincorporated (and less restricted) West Hollywood. The house,
a 1916 mansion, was widely seen as the signature work of Gill, an
architect who was among the first to bring together Spanish Colonial
influences and modernist innovations. Apartments rose in the Dodge
House's place.</TE>
<TE>   Among demolitions near L.A. in 2001 were two homes by architect
Rudolf Schindler -- his 1924 Packard House in San Marino and his 1931
Wolfe House in Avalon. In March 2002, Richard Neutra's 1963 Maslon
House in Rancho Mirage (in Riverside County) was razed as well.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most significant individual buildings lost from Los
Angeles, architectural historians say, are:</TE>
<TE>   Vanished monuments</TE>
<TE>   Even the city's list of protected monuments holds phantoms --
structures that were demolished or otherwise lost even after winning
historic designations.</TE>
<TE>   On Hindry Avenue and Hindry Place near the Los Angeles
International Airport, the city's Airports Department bought and
leveled 16 houses, all built in 1949, as part of a voluntary program
to expand airport territory and give exit options to homeowners in
noisy areas.</TE>
<TE>   At 2011 Sunset Blvd., near Alvarado Street in Echo Park, the city
of Los Angeles bought and leveled the Peerless Hardware building to
make room for a new city library. In the process, the neighborhood
lost a bold-hued mural, painted in 1995 by Ernesto de la Loza. The
mural paid homage to manual laborers -- and a year later, as the new
library rises, day laborers still gather at the site to wait for
drive-by job offers.</TE>
<TE>   At 3017 S. University Ave., near USC, Hebrew Union College
purchased the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity house, a two-story 1960s
building that was leased to the fraternity by the university, then
knocked it down to make way for a parking lot. The fraternity moved
on to a house on 28th Street.</TE>
<TE>   At 6333 W. 3rd St., A.F. Gilmore Co., owners of the 68-year-old
Farmers Market complex, not only relocated the Farmers Market clock
tower but also razed the Gilmore Bank Building. (Past demolitions on
the property include a drive-in theater and the old baseball stadium
where the minor league Hollywood Stars once played.)</TE>
<TE>   Neutra's modernist home in the San Fernando Valley was built with
stylized moat and stark geometry for film director Josef von
Sternberg in 1935. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, author Ayn Rand
took up residence there and created the most famous architect in 20th
century American literature, Howard Roark, in her novel "The
Fountainhead." The home was razed in 1971 to make room for a housing
tract.</TE>
<TE>   The Richfield Tower downtown on South Flower Street, a
328-foot-high Art Deco skyscraper, went up in 1929 with steel lattice
work on top spelling out "Richfield." It featured black masonry (to
symbolize oil) and gold terra-cotta trim. It was demolished in 1968
and replaced three years later by the 699-foot-high Arco Plaza
Towers.</TE>
<TE>   The Fox Carthay Circle Theatre at Carrillo Drive and San Vicente
Boulevard, a Spanish Revival building with a tiled dome, hosted the
premiere of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." It was demolished in
March 1969.</TE>
<TE>   The "Castle" mansion on South Bunker Hill Avenue, built in 1882
and declared a monument in 1964, was relocated in 1969 to make way
for a new batch of business-district skyscrapers, but burned before
it could be renovated.</TE>
<TE>   The Garden Court apartment building at 7021 Hollywood Blvd., a
1919 exemplar of courtyard housing and once among the city's most
elite addresses, was declared a monument in 1981 but razed in 1984.
The Hollywood Galaxy mall now stands on the site.</TE>
<TE>   The 1906 Philharmonic Auditorium on West 5th Street at Pershing
Square was declared a monument in 1969, then demolished 15 years
later. The site is now a parking lot.</TE>

<HD>Corporate culture drained of its colorful characters</HD>

<AU>DAVID SHAW</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In my early years at The Times, at the end of the 1960s and the
beginning of the '70s, I often marveled at the stylish prose turned
out by several colleagues whose writing was so evocative and so
lyrical that I came to think of them as poet-journalists. When Bella
Stumbo died early this month, at age 59, she became -- sadly,
shockingly -- the fourth member of that elite group to succumb at a
relatively young age. Dave Smith died in March, at 64; Chuck Powers
in 1996, at 53; Jim Stingley in 1984, at 43.</LD>
<LD>   Talent and early death were not all these four had in common. They
all worked hard and played hard, with booze, drugs and inner demons
as not infrequent companions. And they were all genuine characters.
Jim shambled through the newsroom, unkempt and unshaven, looking more
like a lumberjack than a reporter. Dave had various psychological
problems, and in 1968, after he wrote a long, brilliant profile on a
deeply troubled mass murderer named Benny Smith, one editor here
nicknamed Dave "Benny the Shrink." Chuck and Bella were a couple for
a while -- a ferociously tempestuous couple -- and I can still recall
Bella punching Chuck in the mouth during one of their more public
quarrels at The Times' local saloon.</LD>
<TE>   I miss these four--and their talent. I have at my desk, in a file
labeled "Others' Epics," copies of several of their stories. An early
paragraph in Dave's Benny Smith profile: "Inwardly, in one dark
valley where his mind comes more and more to dwell, and where no one
else can see, corrosive fantasies leap and flicker, finally taking on
life of their own -- stronger than that of their quiet, timid
creator."</TE>
<TE>   Dave, Bella, Chuck and Jim were all long gone from The Times when
they died, but I think their absence symbolizes a void in our
profession (and our society) that's even greater than their talent.
There aren't many larger-than-life characters being hired in big-city
newsrooms -- or stepping into the larger political arena -- these
days.</TE>
<TE>   The only true character I can recall The Times hiring in the past
decade or so lasted about two weeks in the mid-'90s. His newsroom
colleagues ridiculed him and complained about him, and he got no
support from the then-top editors. He left in a New York minute.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not saying that today's reporters aren't good. Most newspaper
staffs are better than they were 30 years ago -- better-educated and
more sophisticated. Many, at The Times and elsewhere, are fine prose
stylists. But they aren't characters. They aren't colleagues about
whom you go home and say, "Geez, you'll never guess what Bella [or
whoever] did today."</TE>
<TE>   This is more than a lament for the good old days. And I certainly
don't long for the days when many reporters played poker in the
newsroom, took free meals and gifts with both hands, and drank their
lunch out of half-pint bottles stashed in the bottom drawers of
tobacco-stained desks. But I'm convinced that when you take the
characters out of the newsroom, you also take some of the character
out of the newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Newspapers are generally more responsible today than they used to
be. But they're also -- often -- less interesting. There are far
fewer stories of the sort that make a reader say, "Wow, I never
thought I'd see that in the paper." I'm thinking of a mood piece
Chuck wrote after hanging out with derelicts in MacArthur Park, for
example, and I'm thinking of an impressionistic blend of hippie
dialogue and quasi-dramatic construction, written by Dave Felton,
another of The Times' 1970s poet-journalists.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for the absence of such stories is that the editors who
run newspapers today are less likely to be colorful characters
themselves. Again, I'm not saying they're not good journalists. Some
are better than their predecessors. But in the 1970s and early '80s,
when I first started writing about the news media, several top
editors --Ben Bradlee at the Washington Post, Abe Rosenthal at the
New York Times, Gene Roberts at the Philadelphia Inquirer-- were not
just excellent journalists, they were also unconventional, eccentric
and eminently quotable. Their papers reflected that in various ways
-- as witness the Post's gutsy, adrenaline-filled pursuit of the
Watergate story.</TE>
<TE>   Have such characters disappeared entirely from the big-city
editing ranks? No, not entirely. New York Times executive editor
Howell Raines -- a fly-fishing Southern charmer who quotes "Dizzy"
Dean, "Bear" Bryant and W.B. Yeats -- would fit most folks'
definition of a character. That doesn't mean an editor who's a
character will necessarily hire reporters who are characters -- or
that only characters hire characters. Bill Thomas, a superb editor,
is the golf-playing son of a Midwestern banker. No one would call him
a character. But he hired and/or inspired all of The Times' prose
poets of the '70s.</TE>
<TE>   Times have changed, though. Newspapers are increasingly part of
large conglomerates run by men with MBAs on their walls, rather than
printer's ink in their veins. In a time of increasing competition for
the reader's time and the advertiser's dollar, newspapers and their
parent corporations don't think they can afford characters,
risk-takers, people who might embarrass them and damage the price of
their stock.</TE>
<TE>   It's in politics too</TE>
<TE>   This corporatization of our culture -- the rise of respectability
and the decline of raffishness -- is happening throughout society,
especially in the bland-leading-the-bland world of politics. Who
could have envisioned the people of California -- the state that gave
the world "Big Daddy" (Jess Unruh), "Gov. Moonbeam" (Jerry Brown) and
"the Gipper" (you know who) -- having a gubernatorial race this year
between the aptly named Gray Davis and the stupefyingly stolid Bill
Simon.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was a young political journalist," R.W. Apple of the New
York Times told me not so long ago, "there were plenty of honest
scoundrels and jolly rogues in American politics.... Wayne Hays.
Lyndon Johnson. Charlie Halleck. Everett Dirksen. There were a lot of
great characters around in American politics--rich, intriguing,
prolix, often demagogic."</TE>
<TE>   Now? We have a lot of dreary centrists and technocrats clinging to
the middle of the road-- ideologically and stylistically.</TE>
<TE>   The media are at least partially responsible for this. Our
increased scrutiny and cynicism, the powerful role television has
come to play, the reliance on polls and the resultant emphasis on
who's-ahead, horse-race journalism have all served to homogenize the
candidates and to discourage some potential candidates from running
-- and some running candidates from saying or doing anything risky,
anything not pretested by polls and approved by consultants.</TE>
<TE>   But changes in the press corps have also contributed to this
graying of the political process. "Reporters," says Jim Naughton,
president of the Poynter Institute, "now take themselves too
seriously."</TE>
<TE>   As the media have become less quirky, less eccentric, they've
become less tolerant of quirkiness and eccentricity in the candidates
they cover. Much of the character has disappeared from the political
process as well as the newspaper--and society is poorer for that.</TE>
<TE>   Some characters may be only characters, unworthy of our respect. I
shudder at the thought of a character like Strom Thurmond in the
White House. But whatever their flaws, we could sure use a Teddy
Roosevelt or Lyndon Johnson in the White House and an Everett Dirksen
or Mo Udall in Congress -- and a Bella Stumbo in the newsroom. Given
what she got B.T. Collins, then chief of staff for Gov. Jerry Brown,
to say about his boss (he's "out in Uranus half the time"), I would
love to see her writing about Trent Lott.</TE>

Davidson, announced that he plans to retire at the end of 2004. The
founding father of Los Angeles' flagship theater company -- the CTG's
Mark Taper Forum -- as well as artistic director of the Ahmanson
Theatre for the last 13 years, Davidson will stay through the opening
of the Taper's Culver City wing, the Kirk Douglas Theatre, in 2004.</LD>
<TE>   The update: The CTG board hired headhunter Gregory Kandel of
Management Consultants for the Arts to assess the leadership needs of
the organization. Kandel met with the board and staff but not yet
with any candidates for the job or jobs. Still to be determined is
whether the Taper and Ahmanson responsibilities will be split, as
they were before Davidson added the Ahmanson to his Taper duties.</TE>
<TE>   A.S.K. Theater Projects</TE>
<TE>   The news: A leading benefactor of new play development, A.S.K.
Theater Projects, went through a major shakeup, marked by the
departure of numerous staffers, the cancellation of a readings
series, and concerns by local artists that A.S.K. was focusing more
on out-of-town artists and larger institutions.</TE>
<TE>   The update: Executive director Kym Eisner outlined three "core
programs" that A.S.K. will continue to support: individual artists
(whom she defined as "not just playwrights") and ensembles, local
organizations that demonstrate a commitment to new work (including
Los Angeles County's ongoing Hot Properties series and the Taper New
Work Festival that A.S.K. co-funds) and national organizations that
produce new work. The organization's Playwrights in the Schools
program has been axed, and the fate of A.S.K.'s Common Ground
festival of workshops is still up in the air, she said. The staff has
been reduced from 11 to six.</TE>
<TE>   Americans on the London stage</TE>
<TE>   The news: A wave of American actors, including Madonna, Gwyneth
Paltrow, Woody Harrelson and Jake Gyllenhaal, may have crested when
British Equity protested the casting of three non-British actors,
including star Glenn Close, in the subsidized National Theatre's "A
Streetcar Named Desire."</TE>
<TE>   The update: Martin Brown, a spokesman for British Equity, said at
year's end that Equity officials "met with the National Theatre to
seek assurances that this was not the start of a trend to increase
the number of overseas performers. We were given the assurances we
were after."</TE>
<TE>   Kirk Douglas Theatre</TE>
<TE>   The news: Kirk and Anne Douglas gave $2.5 million to the campaign
for the conversion of an old movie house, the Culver Theater, into
the 320-seat Culver City branch of Center Theatre Group, to be used
primarily for play development and youth-oriented theater.</TE>
<TE>   The update: The cost estimate for the facility rose to $10.9
million from an earlier estimate of $7 million to $8 million. Plans
for a 100-seat second stage that would have occupied the old
theater's balcony were dropped because of costs. CTG managing
director Charles Dillingham declined to disclose how much money for
the Douglas had been raised. Meanwhile, the Taper began the move to
Culver City by outfitting the 99-seat Ivy Substation, a few blocks
from the Douglas, and staging its New Work Festival there in the
fall.</TE>
<TE>   Geffen Playhouse</TE>
<TE>   The news: The Geffen Playhouse received two $5-million gifts, one
from David Geffen and another from the Skirball Foundation. The
Westwood theater launched a $15-million campaign that aims to build a
125-seat theater on the east side of the Geffen property, to renovate
and expand by about 40 seats the existing Geffen auditorium, and to
provide a $2-million endowment for the company.</TE>
<TE>   The update: The new small theater will be named after the late
philanthropist Audrey Skirball-Kenis, who died in June. Construction
is not expected to begin until 2004 and will require Geffen shows to
move to a temporary facility.</TE>
<TE>   Shubert Theatre</TE>
<TE>   The news: Theatergoers said goodbye to the Century City home of
many of L.A.'s longest-running musicals, slated to be replaced as
part of an office development. Many of its seats and other equipment
were distributed to other theaters, and demolition was predicted for
the fall.</TE>
<TE>   The update: The empty building still stands. City approvals of the
new development have been delayed, with a Planning Commission hearing
in February the next step. The developer's plans include some sort of
a "cultural amenity," but the nature of the "amenity" -- whether a
performing arts facility, a gallery or some other project -- has not
been decided.</TE>
<TE>   New York ticket prices</TE>
<TE>   The news: In autumn of 2001, an astonishing $480 ticket price for
the best seats at "The Producers" rocked Broadway. This year several
other shows joined Broadway Inner Circle, the "Producers"-allied
company that managed these premium tickets, although no other show
went as high as $480.</TE>
<TE>   The update: A new high was set for an off-Broadway ticket price --
$115 -- for an all-star rendition of Brecht's "The Resistible Rise of
Arturo Ui," with Al Pacino in the lead. The production sold out, but
a spokesman for the play said box office receipts weren't sufficient
to pay for the costs, although income from contributions may yet make
up the deficit.</TE>

<LD>The soldiers moving swiftly through Afghanistan a year ago swept up
thousands of suspected terrorists, members of the Taliban or Al Qaeda
who had reigned cruelly over Afghans and launched attacks against
U.S. targets. Hundreds of suspects were flown to Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba, where they remain. But as often happens in the initial
confusion of military assaults, some of those arrested were innocent.
It's long past time for the Pentagon to determine which were guilty
only of being in the wrong place at the wrong time and to free them.</LD>
<LD>   Military sources told Times reporter Greg Miller that dozens of
prisoners in the jail at the U.S. Navy base in Guantanamo have no
meaningful links to Al Qaeda or the Taliban. In many cases,
intelligence officers in Afghanistan recommended that the prisoners
not be sent there in the first place. Their superiors overruled them.</LD>
<LD>   The sources said operatives extensively questioned at least 59
detainees who they determined were of no further intelligence value.
Questioners recommended that those prisoners be freed in Afghanistan
or sent to their homes in Pakistan. The U.S. shipped them to Cuba.</LD>
<TE>   Keeping innocent men in jail intensifies anti-Americanism in the
prisoners' home countries. It also can push the guiltless into the
arms of terrorists at Guantanamo. The problem is made worse by the
Bush administration's decision to classify the prisoners as enemy
combatants who can be held indefinitely without hearings or lawyers.
Representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross
monitor jail conditions, and the organization said in February that
the captives were entitled under the Geneva Conventions to have a
hearing before "a competent tribunal."</TE>
<TE>   In March, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said some prisoners
might be transferred to other countries and some might be released.
Yet, nine months later, the U.S. has freed only five, including two
men who appeared to be in their 70s and said they never helped the
Taliban. Military sources suggest that many of the remaining 600
prisoners are caught up in a bureaucracy that is afraid to free them
lest someone later prove they were terrorists after all.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. forces have done a good job using up-to-date intelligence to
find and arrest Al Qaeda members in Pakistan, Yemen and elsewhere.
That's a better way to protect Americans than jailing innocent
farmers and taxi drivers for a year without charges or a hearing --
and a much better way to project American values.</TE>

<HD>Rx for Universal Care</HD>
<DH>Move the debate on the uninsured into the mainstream.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Rob Phillips and his girlfriend Heather Fay were on their way to the
Long Beach Airport when their little black Honda smashed into what
became a 216-car pileup on the 710 Freeway. Miraculously, no one was
killed that foggy Sunday morning, but Phillips, a cashier at Wild
Oats in Pasadena, and Fay, an aspiring filmmaker-cum-waitress, were
among 100 people injured. A Times story on Christmas Eve documented
the young couple's struggle since the Nov. 3 accident to mend
physically, emotionally -- and financially.</LD>
<LD>   Their recovery has been challenging enough without the added
pressure of $36,000 in hospital bills and no medical insurance to pay
them. One in five Californians is one car accident or one heart
attack away from just such a financial disaster -- or worse. Since
the Clinton administration's plan crashed in the early '90s,
comprehensive, nationwide reforms that would expand coverage to the
millions of Americans without health insurance have gone nowhere.
Today a handful of California legislators support state reforms.
Employer groups are banding together to expand coverage and keep
costs down. This month, insurance executive Bruce Bodaken, who heads
Blue Shield of California, entered the debate with a proposal he
calls "universal coverage, universal responsibility."</LD>
<TE>   Rather than replacing the current system of employer-sponsored
health insurance that covers about 60% of Californians (Phillips had
been days away from signing up for such coverage), Bodaken's plan
would build on it. To cover the 6.3 million Californians without
employer-sponsored insurance, his proposal knits together a number of
reform models, some considered conservative, others more liberal. He
would make insurance mandatory so that the healthy pay their share,
which some Republicans favor, and require all but the smallest
employers to either offer it or contribute to a state insurance pool.
He calls for a greater effort to sign up the 30% of the uninsured who
already qualify for some type of government help but aren't enrolled
-- a challenge that will no doubt have to wait until California
climbs out of its $34-billion debt hole.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics say the new plan is self-serving since it would
increase business for Blue Shield and other insurers. Longtime
universal-care advocates would prefer to scrap the entire system, tax
everyone with an income and have the government be the "single payer"
for health care, as it is now for Medicare and Medicaid. But they
have failed to gain the support needed for such an overhaul, even in
good times.</TE>
<TE>   The first step toward universal care must include a public effort
to establish a floor and a ceiling for which services should be
covered.</TE>
<TE>   As distasteful as the idea of "rationing" is to many people,
universal-care advocates are right to assert that it goes on every
day, depending on money and luck. And whether Bodaken's plan is right
for California or not, it helps move the debate on universal care
into a fully mainstream arena.</TE>

<LD>The motion picture industry went into 2002 anxious about a few "end
is nigh" scenarios that pundits had painted since 9/11: that fears
would keep people at home rather than at the movies, that digital
piracy would begin depressing box office revenues the way it had been
eroding music CD sales and that rising anti-Americanism might erode
Hollywood's overseas revenues.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, more Americans went to the movies than at any time since
1959, and box office revenues worldwide were up sharply over 2001,
which was already a record year. Hollywood's tinsel turned out to be
the silver lining in an otherwise bleak U.S. holiday sales season.
People flocked to films that provided comfort much as "The Wizard of
Oz" and "Snow White" did in the Depression years before World War II.</LD>
<LD>   All five of the top-grossing films since 9/11 -- "Spider-Man,"
"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," "Star Wars: Episode II
Attack of the Clones," "Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the
Ring" and "Monsters, Inc." -- were more than merely escapist. They
were movies that managed to make serious money off their belief in
human potential. In all five, warmhearted protagonists managed to
succeed because of their faith that human goodness would ultimately
triumph over otherworldly (read: not inevitable) evil.</LD>
<TE>   Hollywood even managed to profit from finding a bit of distinctly
American optimism in the rapper Eminem, writer of misogynist,
nihilist lyrics and star of the autobiographical movie "8 Mile."
Director Curtis Hanson managed to find in Eminem's life a can-do
pragmatism and a determination to reject the cynical racial tensions
of his time.</TE>
<TE>   It's no secret that studio executives are less focused on
bettering the human condition than on inventing marketing vehicles
and spinoffs such as the toys that compel parents to purchase
overpriced plastic for their children. Still, Hollywood's success in
2002 can't be attributed to relentless marketing alone, as the dismal
failure of two aggressively marketed films -- the Madonna vehicle
"Swept Away" and Disney's "Treasure Planet" -- shows. Hollywood's
accomplishment was in spinning narratives that a world otherwise
divided would be drawn to.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, these narratives are not original. The industry adopted
the sort of can-do, almost willfully sunny American pragmatism that
intellectuals such as John Dewey and Oliver Wendell Holmes pioneered
in the 19th century. But Hollywood's success at popularizing this
philosophy, in a world suspicious of big business and of the power of
the United States, should not be dismissed.</TE>

<LD>Re "Founder of the Clash Propelled Punk Rock Into the Mainstream,"
Dec. 24:</LD>
<LD>   I had the privilege of seeing Joe Strummer fronting the Clash at
the Roxy in Hollywood, which was rock 'n' roll at its finest:
intimate, genuine, no facades, no rock star attitude, no MTV hype, no
chasm between star and audience -- just pure passion. Every raspy
word Joe forced out came directly from his heart. There are a lot of
talented musicians currently out there, but there will never be
another Joe.</LD>
<LD>   His passing leaves a permanent void in the rock world, and a lump
in my throat.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Zine Targets Strip Club for Cleanup," Dec. 25: While it may have
been legally sanctioned, as he claims, L.A. City Councilman Dennis
Zine's alleged personal raid against a Tarzana strip club while
wearing his police reserve uniform creates at least the appearance of
a conflict of interest. Was he acting as a City Council
representative or a police officer? This country has always tried to
maintain a strict separation of legislators -- those who make the
laws -- and the law enforcers. Wisely, in my opinion.</LD>
<LD>   If the allegations regarding the Frisky Kitty warranted
investigation, Zine should have requested that the appropriate city
department conduct it. His "routine bar check" makes it appear that
he's straddling a line that shouldn't be straddled. He needs to
decide which branch of the city government he's working for -- and
suspend the other. He can't do both jobs effectively at once, and his
"Carrie Nation with a badge" routine is not only frightening but
actually lends legitimacy to the club owner's lawsuit claiming
harassment.</LD>

<LD>Pity poor George, the desperate fugitive described in your piece
about a return to the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem (Dec. 25).
A modern-day Jean Valjean is he, a romantic hero pursued mercilessly
by the mighty Israeli war machine. He's also apparently a dutiful and
loving husband and father and, no doubt, kind to animals.</LD>
<LD>   But missing from the article is that our poor George might also be
responsible for the deaths and maiming of numbers of innocent Jews
who were walking to the market, eating pizza or on their way to
school. The indescribable agony he might have caused to his victims
before they died in the street or for months as they lay in the
hospital doesn't seem to belong in the picture. The irreparable

his wife and child for only a short time before having to go

comrades have left behind. Probably not; nor, apparently, does The

<TE>   Re your Dec. 24 article on the settlement of Ofra in the West
Bank: It would seem these illegal settlers, as well as those of other
illegal settlements, always fall back on claiming God gave the land
to them. Until some voice booms out from the skies saying so, it
would seem the illegal settlers are just trying to steal land that
doesn't belong to them.</TE>
<TE>   When I hear of settlers getting attacked and killed in Gaza or the
West Bank, I have absolutely no sympathy for them; they deserve what
happens to them. Unfortunately, our government continues to support
Israel, giving terrorist fanatics a justification, in their minds, to
attack us. It's time to cut Israel loose. Israelis are quite capable
of defending themselves; let them defend their illegal settlements,
as well, until they wise up and realize the settlements aren't worth
it. They sure aren't worth the risk to America.</TE>

<TE>   American Jews have the same right to criticize Israel's government
as Israelis do ("Is Unity Good for the Jews?" Opinion, Dec. 22). But
we shouldn't. The reason is simple: Only Israelis vote in Israeli
elections and have to live with the consequences of their choices. It
is arrogant for American Jews to urge Israel to take "risks for
peace" that Israelis judge to be too dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, American Jews must not be willing to fight to
the last Israeli. Diversity is not the issue. The Peace Now/Oslo
approach has not been censored -- it has been rejected as a failure
(at least for now), both in Israel and here. American Jews must unite
in expecting continued U.S. support for Israel because the Jewish
state continues to face existential threats.</TE>
<TE>   The only position that American Jewry can conceivably agree on is
to support the policies of the democratically elected government of
Israel, whatever they may be.</TE>

<HD>Bush's Faith-Based Initiative Treats All Groups Equally</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dec. 24 commentary by Karen McCarthy Brown criticizing President
Bush's faith-based initiative is yet another projection of myopia
about this issue. The point of the government's involvement is to
allow faith-based and small community agencies to play on equal
ground with other larger, secular or public organizations to obtain
support for valuable programs. California is one of the 10 "champion"
states that are working diligently on a national scale, funded by the
federal government through Faith and Communities Engaged in Service
(FACES) to be inclusive of all groups to access funding to serve the
poor and marginalized.</LD>
<LD>   The preponderance of our agencies serve "people of color"
regardless of culture or faith, with no intention to proselytize.
Brown's assertion of Bush's creation of an elitist list reducing
religious traditions to a meager three is also not fair. I have been
involved with other, smaller faith groups she mentions. They are
welcome to participate, like all of us. She would have the president
mention all faith groups as the commercial announcers do to cover all
the legal bases -- saying all of the conditions so fast that all are
named but no one can hear or understand them all.</LD>

<TE>   During the 2000 presidential campaign, George W. Bush was asked if
the Nation of Islam would be among the beneficiaries of faith-based
funding. Bush demurred, insisting he had no intention of subsidizing
those who "preach hate." That pledge was broken spectacularly in
October when a portion of $30 million in taxpayer funds was awarded
to a religious charity run by TV preacher Pat Robertson.</TE>
<TE>   One would be hard-pressed to find a more prominent
religious-political figure in American life who preaches hate as
often and as vigorously as Robertson. The Christian Coalition founder
is on record hating virtually everyone who dares to oppose his agenda
or embrace a theology different from his own.</TE>
<TE>   A federal grant to Robertson rewards bigotry. It forces taxpayers
to support his ministry against their will and illustrates why the
Bush faith-based initiative should be scrapped. Keep church and state
separate.</TE>

<TE>   Brown needs to spend some quality time on the streets of our
nation's largest population centers. After witnessing what America's
faith-based organizations are doing for the needy and learning about
how much more they could accomplish if they had the means, she might
acquire a different view concerning this issue and admit that those
organizations most likely to receive funding are the same
organizations that have been lovingly reaching out to hurting people
of every race and creed for years.</TE>

<LD>Re "L.A. Elementary Schools May Get Sixth Grade Back," Dec. 20: I am
amazed that the Los Angeles Unified School District is considering
such a massive change with little or no input from parents and
teachers. If I recall correctly, this is the same district that just
a few years ago gave the public a whole litany of reasons for moving
the sixth-graders to the middle school; now it wants to move them
back?</LD>
<LD>   Not long ago the district said that year-round schools put kids at
a disadvantage; now it wants to spin the year-round schools into a
new format. To make matters worse, the proposed calendars will
negatively affect the elementary schools. Track A is most like the
traditional school calendar year, but Tracks B, C and D leave much to
be desired. Track B has a big chunk of vacation time midyear;
students will miss most holiday activities in their elementary
schools, including Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas and Hanukkah.
Students on Track C will take a long break just before state testing.
The 60-day break means 60 school days, which equates to three entire
months off. How many students fare well on tests after taking three
months off?</LD>
<TE>   Students on Track D will be in school from July of this new school
year until April of next year, with little or no real break. If you
want to burn out a kid, that's one way to do it. I can see everyone
running for Track A and heaven help those stuck on Tracks B, C and D.
I hope the school board takes a careful look at the consequences of
its actions.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Chartering New Course for Schools," by Richard Lee Colvin,
Commentary, Dec. 23: There are two glaring flaws in this latest
concept to save our floundering education system by opening 100 new
charter schools.</TE>
<TE>   First, with one parenthetical comment, Colvin dismisses athletics
as a frivolous distraction that gets in the way of education ("and no
football team"). Athletics plays a vibrant role in the development of
young people. All students, not just participants, benefit from a
good athletic program. Participants learn life lessons in teamwork,
cooperation and hard work over and above the joy of playing their
particular sport. Students in general have a better attitude about
their school when a good athletic program is in place. Creating a lot
of little schools with no sports teams would diminish the richness of
the overall education process.</TE>
<TE>   Second, if you create 100 new schools, who is going to teach
there? Or will they just pick from the thousands of qualified
applicants lined up to join the LAUSD?</TE>

<HD>Race Has a Place in College Admissions</HD>
<DH>Students learn more, and learn more powerfully, in settings

<SE></SE>
<AU>William D. Adams</AU>
<BD>William D. Adams is president of Colby College in
Waterville, Maine.</BD>
<DL>WATERVILLE, Maine</DL>
<LD>Close observers of American higher education were not surprised by
the U.S. Supreme Court's recent decision to review two cases
involving admission methods at the University of Michigan. Both
cases, one concerning the law school's admissions practices and one
its undergraduate admissions practices, challenge the university's
use of race as a "plus factor" in deciding which students to accept.
The school has maintained that a diverse student body provides
educational benefits and says that considering race as a factor in
admissions is essential to ensuring diversity.</LD>
<LD>   The increasingly bitter struggle over affirmative action in
college admissions has gradually eroded the legal and philosophical
authority of the court's landmark decision in Regents of the
University of California vs. Bakke. In that case, the court held
that, though quotas that set aside a fixed number of seats for
minority applicants are not legal, educational institutions can
consider race as a factor in deciding which applicants to admit. For
better or worse, a new framework seems both inevitable and necessary.</LD>
<TE>   What sort of framework is it likely to be? Since the court has
avoided discussing Bakke for almost a quarter-century, it is
impossible to say with certainty. But as the lawyers begin to sharpen
their rhetorical positions, it is worth recalling two fundamental
truths about American higher education at the beginning of this new
century.</TE>
<TE>   The first concerns the educational value of diversity. Unlike
employment practices, where remediation of the effects of past
discrimination has been the primary philosophical and legal hinge of
affirmative action, the legitimacy of seeking diversity through the
admission process has been linked to educational purposes and
effects. That linkage is grounded in the notion that students learn
more, and more powerfully, in settings that include individuals from
many different backgrounds and perspectives.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the Bakke decision, this notion was still somewhat
theoretical at highly selective liberal arts colleges. My own
institution, Colby College, was in 1978 composed largely of white,
middle-class students from suburban Boston and New York. In the
environment of the residential college, where interaction among
students and faculty is at the core of the educational process,
homogeneity placed severe limits on the exploration of many issues in
American life and history.</TE>
<TE>   Graduates of that era report feeling unprepared for the world they
were destined to work and live in. After a recent visit to the
campus, one Colby alumnus from the late 1960s told me how struck he
was by the evident change in the intellectual tone and atmosphere of
the college since his graduation. He attributed that change in part
to increased diversity. "When I graduated," he said, "I knew the one
African American in my class. It was a very confining and somewhat
complacent world."</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1970s, with growing skill and assurance, top liberal
arts colleges have been learning how to capitalize on the educational
promise of diversity. At Colby, we have made great strides, but still
have a long way to go before we have anything close to a
representative student body. Last year, students of color from the
U.S. constituted roughly 12% of the first-year class.</TE>
<TE>   No one closely associated with the daily realities of our
institutions would disagree with the assertion that greater diversity
has made us better where it matters most -- in our ability to deliver
a powerful and relevant educational experience to our students.
Colby's classrooms are now more likely to produce the kind of
conversations and thinking our students will need to be successful in
the world and to contribute to it in meaningful ways.</TE>
<TE>   The opponents of affirmative action have tried to reduce the
educational pursuit of diversity to the mechanical application of
racial preferences. Racial differences are important to any
meaningful notion of diversity, but at every liberal arts college I
am acquainted with, the commitment to diversity is multifaceted. We
have dedicated considerable effort and financial resources, for
instance, to recruiting students from different socioeconomic
backgrounds, and we have consistently sought diversity of talents --
athletes, bassoonists, debaters -- in the construction of each class.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, we have increased dramatically the number of
international students on our campuses, as well as students from all
regions of the U.S. All of these differences have educational value
and significance for our students and faculty, and most are
considered, though never mechanically, in admission decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Precisely because of the enormous significance of diversity to the
educational mission of colleges and universities, any serious
diminution of our ability to consider those differences in the
admission process would have profoundly negative consequences for the
quality of the experience we provide. And our ability will be
diminished if the legitimacy of considering race, among other
factors, is not preserved in any legal framework replacing Bakke.</TE>
<TE>   The importance of such latitude is particularly apparent at this
time of year, when admission decisions are being made. I recently
traveled to New York to interview a number of candidates who were
identified by a unique program that introduces colleges and
universities like Colby to candidates from schools and backgrounds
not typically represented in our applicant pools.</TE>
<TE>   The remarkable individuals we talked to, about 20 in all, were
clearly eager, and for the most part ready, to take advantage of a
Colby education. The objective credentials of the 10 we ultimately
selected -- their SAT scores, for instance -- differ from those of
their typical potential classmates. But these differences were not
and should not be decisive in our admission of those students, in
view of the larger purposes and goals of the college. Without the
ability to consider attributes other than abstract and quantitative
academic markers, it would be difficult, perhaps impossible, to bring
such students to Colby.</TE>
<TE>   The matter does not end here, however. We have told ourselves for
a very long time, and rightly so, that broad access to higher
education is one of the principal guarantors of equal opportunity in
American life. We should not be surprised or displeased, then, by the
positive effect that greater diversity on college and university
campuses has had on American society as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   As students leave our institutions to confront the challenges of a
multicultural world, they have the tools to help the rest of us cope
more productively with the racial, cultural and ethnic differences
that constitute both our national glory and our greatest challenge.
This is not so much about the remediation of the effects of past
discrimination as it is about affecting positively the country's
social relations in the future. A more compelling interest is hard to
imagine.</TE>
<TE>   Several years ago, a fund-raising trip took me to an airport where
I happened to talk with the owner of the local shoeshine concession,
an elderly African American man. He was curious about what I did for
a living. When he learned of my institutional affiliation, he noted
with quiet pride that one of his seven children had graduated from
that very place nearly two decades earlier. With even more pride, he
went on to inform me that his son had just been named the deputy
attorney general of his state.</TE>
<TE>   The story is memorable for several reasons, and not least in its
affirmation of what we have espoused since the republic was formed
about the tight bond between democracy and education. The Supreme
Court now has the opportunity to secure a crucial link in that chain.</TE>

<AU>William M. Arkin</AU>
<BD>William M. Arkin is a military affairs analyst who
writes regularly for Opinion. E-mail: warkin@igc.org.</BD>
<DL>SOUTH POMFRET, Vt.</DL>
<LD>In the early morning of Oct. 23, 1983, a suicide bomber crashed a
truck loaded with 12,000 pounds of explosives through the security
perimeter of Headquarters Battalion Landing Team 1/8 at Beirut
International Airport. The resulting explosion killed 241 U.S.
Marines and wounded 70 others. An almost-simultaneous suicide attack
a few miles away destroyed a building occupied by French
paratroopers; 58 died.</LD>
<LD>   President Reagan later said he had been rendered "almost
speechless by the magnitude of the loss."</LD>
<LD>   At the time, Colin L. Powell was a major general, the senior
military assistant to then-Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger.
Writing about the events in his autobiography, Powell decried the
fact that the battleship New Jersey had previously been lobbing
Volkswagen-sized shells into the hills surrounding Beirut -- "as if
we were softening up the beaches on some Pacific atoll."</LD>
<TE>   "Since [the terrorists] could not reach the battleship, they found
a more vulnerable target, the exposed Marines at the airport," Powell
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Today, as the year draws to a close with the United States
pressing its global fight against terrorism and preparing for combat
in Iraq, the Beirut bombings of almost 20 years ago stand as a
bellwether for the U.S. military and for members of the
counterterrorism community.</TE>
<TE>   For those who read its history, Beirut also stands as a reminder
to the public that failure to think carefully about seemingly obvious
policy decisions may carry a heavy price.</TE>
<TE>   Beirut happened two decades before the terrorist attacks of Sept.
11, 2001, brought the phrase "asymmetrical warfare" into the
language. Yet much about it is painfully current: the tangled chains
of command, the poor communications, the intelligence warnings that
were discounted or ignored. Reagan was shown to be detached and
ignorant of the complexity of foreign affairs. American policymakers
were revealed as oblivious to the motivations of those they were
confronting. Senior military leaders such as Powell saw their
concerns brushed aside.</TE>
<TE>   And what stand out most conspicuously 20 years after Beirut are
the lessons not learned.</TE>
<TE>   "What I saw from my perch in the Pentagon," Powell wrote about
Lebanon, "was America sticking its hand into a thousand-year-old
hornet's nest."</TE>
<TE>   Well, the hand is back in. The "groupthink" that once allowed
political and military leaders to march headstrong into the Lebanese
quagmire blinds our leaders now. What is more, the tangible and
rhetorical resort to "war" strengthens the hand of terrorists and
opens the way to potentially ruinous fissures in American society.</TE>
<TE>   At this point in any critical analysis, it is mandatory to say
that terrorism is monstrous. To fail to utter this mantra is to
appear to sympathize with terrorists, or to join those who excuse the
Sept. 11 attacks because of U.S. policies and actions in the Middle
East and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   I believe, in fact, that terrorism -- in that it intentionally
targets the innocent with no other purpose than to terrorize -- is
pure evil.</TE>
<TE>   That said, in the 15 months since Sept. 11, defense spending has
skyrocketed, war has been waged from Afghanistan to Yemen and a new
Department of Homeland Security and an old national security state
have sprung to life -- though the national security establishment has
a new raison d'etre.</TE>
<TE>   And, as evil as terrorism is, there is a cost in all this for
America. By turning the country into a fortress, we cripple our
spirit and inhibit our economy. Both diplomacy and military
effectiveness are incapacitated by the never-ending demands of
security and "force protection."</TE>
<TE>   Freedom is not, as Janis Joplin wailed, "just another word for
nothing left to lose." It is the vital core of our society,
responsible for most of what we treasure -- including the material
things. And freedom is wounded by secrecy and the curtailment of
civil liberties.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorists set out to kill ordinary people at random to sow fear
and destroy civilian morale. Terrorists win when we escalate our
response to the level of war. U.S. interests would be better served
by not always responding to terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorists should not be allowed to determine U.S. foreign policy,
nor exert such a powerful influence over the American spirit.</TE>
<TE>   There is a third way between war and surrender: Putting terrorism
in its place to deny terrorists much of what they crave.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorists, expert Brian Jenkins wrote in 1984 after the Lebanon
attacks, "can attack anything, anywhere, anytime; governments cannot
protect everything, everywhere, all the time." In other words,
terrorists will always attack the least-defended target. And as long
as grievances, real and perceived, persist, terrorism will persist.</TE>
<TE>   To respond with military escalation and war is to create the exact
state that terrorists most hope to achieve. The groupthink mode that
seems so powerfully at play in the Bush administration blinds our
leaders to this truth. It suppresses critical thought and silences
dissidents. It also creates an illusion -- and an expectation -- of
invulnerability.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of American and Western culture need not be
underestimated or excused, but we should not fail to reckon the costs
and risks of the path we choose. Nor should we assume there are no
alternatives to the current course.</TE>
<TE>   It is military professionals themselves, those who might be
thought the most gung-ho about the war on terrorism, who are most
likely to question the present course. "Killing ants" is how military
leaders often describe it in private.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Washington looks more and more like the city terrorist
sympathizers are fond of describing: a mighty capital seized by fear
and panic, giving free rein to aggression in the name of
self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   Self-defense? What's wrong with that? After all, the United States
was attacked. But the United States -- its sovereign territory in its
embassies and ships -- has been attacked before. In some ways,
nothing is new here except the magnitude of the American loss.</TE>
<TE>   The effectiveness of any action against terrorism depends on
limiting our definition of terrorism to the acts of private groups
and not governments, to those with no political authority or pretense
of political authority.</TE>
<TE>   This is an important distinction because it rejects policy
arguments, however indirect, that justify the intentional targeting
of the defenseless.</TE>
<TE>   Second, it is essential that we tightly confine the term
"terrorism." Pasting that label on everything from passive civil
disobedience to environmental activism introduces the wrongheaded
notion that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter,
allowing some to argue that even George Washington was a terrorist.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, our response to terrorism must stem from clear
thinking. We must reject groupthink. Osama bin Laden has his
grievances: the inroads of secularism into Islam, the U.S. military
presence in Saudi Arabia, the uncritical U.S. support of Israel and
the supposed defense of the innocent in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Though we must abhor Bin Laden's actions and seek to neutralize
his minions, the issues should provoke introspection on our part. We
must not reward the absolute evil of terrorism by stampeding into
policies that ultimately work against our own interests -- not even
in the name of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   A military friend of mine quips that when the war on terrorism
began, 80% of the Islamic masses hated us. Now, he says, 100% hate
us. That is not the arithmetic of success.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the entire U.S. military, NATO and a large coalition of
others -- a total of more than 90 nations, according to Secretary of
Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld -- are mobilized to fight the war on
terror. We have elevated evil and amoral thugs into soldiers, the
equals of our own. And our war has given aid and comfort to an
illegitimate leadership, to people we should otherwise dismiss.</TE>
<TE>   When Rumsfeld and other administration officials describe
terrorism as the gravest threat to America, when they warn that it
will last decades, they are most likely pleasing terrorists no end.</TE>
<TE>   After Beirut, after the Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia,
after embassy bombings and countless hijackings and suicide attacks,
after the blasting of the battleship Cole -- and finally, after the
World Trade Center and the Pentagon -- now, the United States is
recognizing "them." Indeed, the United States has virtually
recognized the state of Bin Laden, declared war, and through
short-term successes in military action, inadvertently increased
sympathies for the terrorist "cause."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the administration's fervor to eliminate terrorism
raises each attack to the level of a battle victory -- thereby aiding
recruitment and bolstering terrorists' credibility.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, the American government should protect American lives
and interests. That is its job. But it should not be at war with
terrorism as an entity, because that opens the way to reorganizing
the American government in a frenzy, taking liberties from the
American citizenry and threatening freedom of information and the
sanctity of privacy.</TE>
<TE>   And overseas, we will have recreated Beirut, providing new power
and identity to those who have no legitimate claim upon them.</TE>

<HD>Cut Taxes to Guarantee the Recovery Will Continue</HD>
<DH>Four Economic Views: There's one point on which analysts
agree: The U.S. economy is shaky. But beyond that basic truth, there
is little consensus. Why things soured, how to get back on track,
even how bad the situation really is: All these points are hotly
debated in financial circles. We asked four economists to look at the
state of the economy and propose solutions. Their ideas are presented
here.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bruce Bartlett</AU>
<BD>Bruce Bartlett is a senior fellow with the National
Center for Policy Analysis in Washington.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, which is the
final word on such things, a recession began in July 1990 and ended
in March 1991. Yet, during the 1992 presidential campaign -- long
after the recession was officially over -- Bill Clinton convinced
voters that the economy was still ailing and that President Bush was
responsible. Clinton's ability to successfully make that case was the
single biggest factor in his victory.</LD>
<LD>   The memory of those times guarantees that the U.S. economy is
going to occupy much of President George W. Bush's attention next
year. He knows that the economic policies he sets in place in 2003
will largely determine his electoral success in 2004. The first
President Bush, like his son, had extremely high approval ratings
early in his term. Clinton won only by blaming his opponent day after
day for mishandling the economy.</LD>
<TE>   Perceptions tend to lag economic reality. It took almost two years
after the 1990-91 recession had ended before most people believed
that it was over, which presents Bush with a problem. In fact, the
recession that began in March 2001 is probably behind us -- although
the National Bureau of Economic Research has not said so yet. But
according to a recent Los Angeles Times Poll, 61% of Americans
believe we are still in recession. A big reason is that unemployment
is still rising and may fall very slowly even after it has peaked.
The lingering effects could be felt well into 2004.</TE>
<TE>   This is why Bush has decided to put forward a big tax stimulus
plan early next year, expected to be in the $300-billion range. It is
also why he has made significant changes in his economic team, firing
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and his chief economic advisor,
Lawrence B. Lindsey.</TE>
<TE>   Bush feels he must get his ducks in a row next year, because by
2004 it will be too late. He wants to ensure that growth will be
robust then, with low or at least falling unemployment. Given the
unavoidable lag between changes in economic policy and their effect
on growth and employment, any policy changes must occur as early in
2003 as possible to be effective in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Many economists believe that further stimulus is unnecessary.
O'Neill apparently was one. Press reports suggest that he was fired
for resisting the push for new stimulus, believing the economy was
doing well enough on its own. After all, real gross domestic product
was up 4% in the third quarter, well above its historical average.
Adding new stimulus in a time of growth, Bush's critics contend,
could contribute to inflation and push the Federal Reserve to raise
interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   Without knowing the final details of Bush's tax plans, I think he
is right to see the balance of risks as weighing more toward the need
for stimulus than lower deficits. The risk of doing nothing is
significant, and the president's stimulus package could be justified
even if the economy was roaring. In the end, he has rightly concluded
that the risk of a "double-dip" recession outweighs the risk of
overstimulating the economy. So, what should be done?</TE>
<TE>   In all likelihood, the president will set out to make some badly
needed corrections to the way our tax system is structured.</TE>
<TE>   The administration will probably propose some relief from the
current double taxation of corporate profits. Taxes of up to 35% are
paid once in the form of corporate income tax. The profits are taxed
again -- at up to 39% -- after they are distributed to stockholders.
In the end, the overall federal tax rate on corporate profits can be
as high as 60%.</TE>
<TE>   Economists have long criticized this system, saying that it
encourages companies to borrow rather than issue equity and to retain
earnings rather than pay out dividends. It also reduces investment by
raising the cost of capital. Eliminating this kind of double taxation
-- as most other countries have -- makes sense whether or not the
country is in recession.</TE>
<TE>   Reducing double taxation now, perhaps by allowing a partial
dividend exclusion for investors, might also provide economic
stimulus by boosting the stock market. With stock market wealth down
by $8 trillion from its peak, people obviously are not as able or
willing to spend. If reducing double taxation led to a jump in the
stock market, as many economists think it would, then the result
might be an increase in consumer confidence and spending, which would
increase short-term growth. Economists call this the wealth effect.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the likely Bush administration plan to increase
depreciation allowances is another economic correction that makes
sense regardless of how the economy is doing -- and it would also
provide a short-term stimulus. Such allowances let businesses write
off investments in facilities and equipment. Lagging business
investment is a key reason for slow economic growth. By lowering
taxes on investments in productivity-enhancing equipment, the
government is encouraging something that will serve the economy both
long- and short-term.</TE>
<TE>   The principal argument against such tax incentives -- from both
sides of the aisle -- is that they will further increase the budget
deficit. The real problem with deficits is that they can cause
interest rates to go up. But with interest rates at historic lows,
the potential effects of a slightly larger deficit would be minimal.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, the country's most serious deficit issue is not the
on-budget deficit, but rather the off-budget deficits in the Social
Security and Medicare systems. Raising the long-run rate of growth by
lowering taxes on savings and investment would do far more to help
this problem than running a smaller deficit next year by resisting
new tax cuts.</TE>
<TE>   It may well be that the economy will recover nicely on its own
even if there is no additional tax stimulus next year. But Bush
cannot afford to take that chance. Even if he can't get what he wants
through Congress, he will want voters to know he tried. If it turns
out there is a double-dip recession, the onus will be on those who
opposed the stimulus, not on him.</TE>
<TE>   Bush understands that, even with his party controlling the House
and Senate, he faces a tough battle, especially in the Senate, where
Democrats have powerful procedural weapons at their disposal to delay
and amend presidential initiatives. At a minimum, they will extract a
political price for giving the administration what it wants.</TE>
<TE>   The president knows the stakes are high -- but worth the fight. He
has carefully weighed domestic economic concerns against the great
unknowns of a war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   A successful war could ultimately have political and economic
benefits, like lowering the price of oil by raising Iraqi oil output
after a regime change. However, the short-term costs could be high,
with temporarily higher oil prices and larger military outlays. Bush
feels that his tax proposals -- with their likely results of raising
stock prices, increasing business investment and spurring economic
growth -- are needed to help offset any short-run disruptions that
may result from war. I think he's right.</TE>

<DH>Can one small Mexican lobster co-op's sustainable practices
become a model for success?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Fulbright Foote</AU>
<BD>William Fulbright Foote is the director of EcoLogic
Enterprise Ventures, Inc., a "green" loan fund based in Cambridge,
Mass. that finances small-scale producer organizations in Latin
America.</BD>
<DL>PUNTA ABREOJOS, Mexico</DL>
<LD>Off this pristine beach in Baja California Sur may lie the secret of
balance between seafood, which people need to eat, and its
environment, which is fast eroding.</LD>
<LD>   The blue waters here are teeming with spiny lobsters and
well-tended traps, a testament to the successful efforts of
small-scale fishermen who have carved a niche for themselves in the
international marketplace while preserving a sensitive environment.
The World Wildlife Fund-sponsored Marine Stewardship Council, a
global group that certifies sustainable-fishing practices for
consumers, is currently reviewing the Baja fishery. If the lobster
operation earns the Council's "green" seal of approval next year, it
will be the first fishery from a developing country to receive the
prized label.</LD>
<TE>   But green seal or no, these are troubled waters. Just a few miles
down the beach, and throughout Mexico, overfishing threatens to sink
the entire industry. Fish and other seafood -- especially lobster --
have never been in greater demand, with the world's total fishery
production today bringing in $131 billion annually. Since 1960, the
world catch has increased more than threefold, from 27 million to
more than 91 million tons a year. Fishermen worldwide are harvesting
marine life faster than it can replenish itself, causing sharp
declines in virtually every commercially important species of fish in
the sea. Meanwhile, nearly 25% of what is caught gets tossed back
into the ocean either dead or dying.</TE>
<TE>   In Mexico, the situation is particularly bleak, and there is
compelling evidence pointing to the Mexican government as the primary
culprit for the fishing crisis here. In the early 1990s, the
administration of President Carlos Salinas aggressively deregulated
Mexican commercial fishing without creating an effective system of
permits and licensing.</TE>
<TE>   Boats lack license plates. Motors go unregistered. Virtually
anyone, anywhere, can become a commercial fisherman. As a result, the
vast majority of Mexico's fisheries, which together make this country
the world's sixth-largest global fish producer, now operate under
free-for-all conditions. Consider also the years of endemic
corruption at the federal, state and local levels, and you can begin
to see the scope of the industry's severe economic and environmental
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Take the Gulf of California. "It's complete chaos," says Manuel
Gardea, a lobster fisherman and abalone diver turned entrepreneur who
helped found a whale-watching company called Ecoturismo Kuyima in the
town of San Ignacio. "It's crawling with [poachers]. You just can't
compete."</TE>
<TE>   Luis Bourillon, a marine biologist in Guaymas, posits that 12,000
to 16,000 small-scale fishing boats operate in the Gulf of
California, about half without permits. In fiberglass skiffs, they
catch 100 species using gill nets, which trap all marine life. Many
nations ban them; Mexico does not. Even more indiscriminate are the
shrimp fleets, which use bottom-scraping dragnets that catch 10
pounds of other marine creatures for every pound of shrimp. Almost
all of the excess is discarded because there is no market for it.
Pressured by a powerful commercial fishing lobby, the federal
government and its state-owned oil company subsidize marine-diesel
fuel costs by 50% to artificially maintain overbuilt, nonviable
fleets.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, Punta Abreojos Cooperative stands in stark contrast with
the dominant forces that have contributed to the global fishing
crisis. Picture an isolated lobster-fishing village on a singularly
beautiful and nearly virgin beach at the conjunction of desert
terrain and the Pacific coastline. Founded in the 1930s, about 550
miles south of San Diego, the community-based business rigorously
respects area closures, restrictions on fishing gear, minimum legal
sizes and protection of pregnant females. With 200 members, the co-op
undertakes aggressive surveillance and policing of its entire fishing
area (radar systems, radio communications, armed night patrols) to
stop poachers who overtax the lobster population and harm its fragile
marine habitats.</TE>
<TE>   What makes Punta Abreojos different? It holds an exclusive
concession to its fishing territory. In the 1930s, the leftist
government of President Lazaro Cardenas allocated exclusive
management rights to fishing co-ops along the Pacific coast of Baja
California. The government assigned a group of high-value species
(lobster, abalone and others) within a restricted fishing territory
for each organization.</TE>
<TE>   No one got rich, but geographically isolated communities developed
and took care not to over-exploit their precious resources. When
necessary, fishermen defended their concessions for economic
self-preservation, not necessarily environmental conservation. When
fishing legislation changed under Salinas, Punta Abreojos went on the
offensive as part of a federation of nine lobster cooperatives in the
area.</TE>
<TE>   "We hounded the politicians in Ensenada and Mexico City," recalls
Pablo Arce, president of Punta Abreojos Cooperative. "Companeros
mobilized and marched. In 1993, we got a new 20-year concession that
embodies clear delimitations of our exclusive fishing zone and
species access."</TE>
<TE>   Its natural resources relatively secure, Punta Abreojos could then
focus its attention where most Mexican fishermen cannot -- on how to
compete in a fast-changing international marketplace. Following the
example of peasant coffee farmers in southern Mexico, the cooperative
decided to market its eco-sensitivity, allowing it to compete in the
world marketplace on something other than price.</TE>
<TE>   In Punta Abreojos' case, its fishermen have a comparative
advantage in lobster taken in environmentally sensitive ways and thus
have the potential to command premium prices. The co-op also happens
to lie inside the 6.2-million-acre El Viscaino Biosphere Reserve, the
largest protected natural area in Mexico. U.S. companies such as
Whole Foods Market, Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines and Lindblad
Expeditions promote and sell eco-labeling programs like that of
Marine Stewardship Council, encouraging better fisheries management
through market-based incentives. Though the market today for such
products is small in North America and Western Europe, its
development in coastal areas of Mexico and across Latin America might
have major significance for fishermen who otherwise would have to
compete in the highly volatile marketplace.</TE>
<TE>   To get there requires productive investment. In December 2002,
Punta Abreojos began replacing aged outboard motors with cleaner,
more-efficient engines through a pilot credit program established by
the organization I direct, EcoLogic Enterprise Ventures, a "green"
loan fund based in Cambridge, Mass. A next-generation technology,
four-stroke motors are much cleaner and quieter than traditional
two-stroke outboard engines. Ubiquitous in Baja, two-strokes dump as
much as one-third of their gasoline and oil into the water, while
producing significant air pollution. By contrast, four-strokes use on
average 30% to 50% less fuel than two-strokes, yielding immediate
monetary savings for fishermen.</TE>
<TE>   Along Mexico's coastlands, these engines could prove an economic
boon to cash-strapped fishermen everywhere. As Arce, who signed the
loan contracts on behalf of his co-op, explains, "Everybody in the
region wants to buy four-strokes. But nobody is going to invest in
new motors or in surveillance or environmental protection if they
know they cannot keep poachers from stealing their resources."</TE>
<TE>   Poachers, that is, or politicians. In 1995, the Mexican government
and Mitsubishi Corp. announced plans to build the world's largest
saltworks on the shores of San Ignacio Lagoon, the last pristine
winter birthing lagoon for the gray whale. Planned just down the
beach from Punta Abreojos, the project's scale threatened the co-op's
fishing territory and related livelihood.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next five years, well-known nongovernmental organizations
such as the National Resources Defense Council, the International
Fund for Animal Welfare, and Earth Island Institute led an
international campaign that persuaded then-President Ernesto Zedillo
to drop the plans. Their global campaign succeeded, in large measure,
by finding traction in the grass-roots organizing of Punta Abreojos.
Not coincidentally, those same U.S.-based NGOs are now partially
guaranteeing the loans for four-stroke engine purchases.</TE>
<TE>   As Punta Abreojos marries conservation goals with economic
rewards, its business model and responsible fisheries management
serve as examples for others, both locally and internationally. Out
of enlightened self-interest, a stringent conservation ethic has
emerged among member fishermen.</TE>
<TE>   Punta Abreojos demonstrates that local fishing communities could
be the core constituency in the global battle to save marine
biodiversity. There, perhaps, lies at least one secret of balance
between fish-for-food and their environment. But until Mexico moves
to regulate the free-for-all fishing along most of its coastline,
Punta Abreojos is likely to remain impossible to emulate.</TE>

<HD>The Case for Public Spending</HD>
<DH>Four Economic Views: There's one point on which analysts
agree: The U.S. economy is shaky. But beyond that basic truth, there
is little consensus. Why things soured, how to get back on track,
even how bad the situation really is: All these points are hotly
debated in financial circles. We asked four economists to look at the
state of the economy and propose solutions. Their ideas are presented
here.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James K. Galbraith</AU>
<BD>James K. Galbraith holds the Lloyd M. Bentsen Jr. Chair
in Government/Business Relations at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of
Public Affairs, University of Texas at Austin, and is senior scholar
at the Levy Economics Institute.</BD>
<DL>AUSTIN, Texas</DL>
<LD>The economy is in trouble. Investment, far below what it was two
years ago, shows little sign of revival. Consumer spending, having
held up remarkably well during the same time, is now more likely to
tail off than to accelerate. And though the federal government could
soon be spending an extra $100 billion to $200 billion on war, its
spending otherwise is also in decline.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush team knows all this. And it realizes that the president's
neck is on the line if stagnation continues and unemployment rises
into 2004.</LD>
<LD>   And so, Keynesian economics (my native creed) is back. As John
Maynard Keynes stressed, total spending matters -- and not who does
it or for what purpose. Tax cuts and deficit spending are therefore
on the agenda; low interest rates seem here to stay. Stimulus is the
watchword of the day. It remains only to fill in the details, or so
it seems.</LD>
<TE>   But quick-convert Keynesians are unlikely to be good ones. And
their programs, based on crude ideas and analogies -- for instance,
to the tax cuts that led to the Reagan boom of 1984 -- may prove
ineffective today. This is the political danger President Bush faces,
and one that any Democratic opponent had better try to understand.</TE>
<TE>   Though tax cuts aimed at the middle class might keep their
spending going for a time, the president will aim his tax cuts first
and foremost at business and the rich. But lowering taxes on profits
and capital gains by no means ensures that American corporations will
rev up their investments. They might. But it is a shaky bet, since
many companies doubt they can earn the profits that would enable them
to benefit from the breaks.</TE>
<TE>   If firms were to get tax breaks they didn't plow back into growing
their companies, then tax cuts simply would be passed along to
shareholders as dividends or to executives as salary. In neither case
could we expect the effect on consumption spending to be large. And
so, if the Bush tax cuts fail to stimulate investment, they won't
have much effect on consumption either.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's consumption plan has one main tenet: relying on Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to keep interest rates low so that
households will continue to borrow. But this fix, which has
undeniably worked so far, may run out of steam soon. How much more
debt will households willingly incur? How much more will banks
willingly lend? And, having cut short-term interest rates to the
bone, how far can the Federal Reserve bring down long-term interest
rates without putting a lethal squeeze on bank balance sheets? Banks
make their money, after all, on the spread.</TE>
<TE>   In government, budget slashing at the state and local levels could
unleash chaos. State and local governments are looking at revenue
gaps that would require them to cut spending or raise taxes by more
than $100 billion to balance their budgets. This potential for
home-grown disaster seems to have been off the administration's radar
so far.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush strategy is therefore unlikely to generate the growth and
profitability required to restart strong business investment,
stabilize households and basic government services and bring down
unemployment. A war with Iraq would certainly stimulate spending and
profits. But if Iraq proves to be the puny opponent that the
administration expects, then even that boost would be at best
temporary and fairly small.</TE>
<TE>   This opens the way for Bush's opponents to advance a different
program. But such a program cannot be built on nostalgia for the
Clinton years, with its balanced budgets and booming markets. That
bubble has burst once and for all. The current problems, which were
not created by Bush alone, must be solved in new ways.</TE>
<TE>   First, Democrats should stand for saving the government that we
have. State and local government spending on schools, health care,
the environment and core services is deeply needed and well
supported. That spending is also imperiled. A federal revenue-sharing
program is the simplest way to save it, though other devices, such as
increasing the Medicaid match, would help as well.</TE>
<TE>   This kind of spending would, of course, bring deficits. But in
fact, the deficits already exist. Either they will be dumped on
American households -- through higher state and local taxes or
service cuts -- or the federal government, which alone can afford to
do so, can shoulder the debt for the next few years.</TE>
<TE>   Second, Democrats should support temporarily cutting Social
Security payroll taxes now to encourage private consumption by
working families. If Congress would refuse to pass a permanent repeal
of estate taxes, revenue expected from that source could be credited
to the Social Security Trust Fund, keeping it more or less whole.
What better way to promote fairness than to recycle accumulated
wealth into the retirement system that supports us all?</TE>
<TE>   Third, if the private sector won't invest, let Democrats call for
the public sector to take up the slack for a while.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, the government should devote resources to solving
one of our biggest problems: energy. We need a more diversified
transportation system. We need programs that promote conservation and
the development of renewable fuels. And the government can also help
by enacting needed social improvements like extended unemployment
insurance, universal health coverage and a prescription drug benefit.</TE>
<TE>   Such measures -- if large and bold enough -- would position the
Democrats as pro-growth and anti-unemployment in ways Bush could not
credibly claim to be. But we must also recognize the dangers of our
situation, for these affect us as Americans, Democrats and
Republicans alike.</TE>
<TE>   The lurking economic threat today is to the dollar. We no longer
live in the world of 1969, when the Bretton Woods institutions -- the
exchange-rate system then run by the International Monetary Fund --
protected us (up to a point) against the financial excesses of
Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is it still 1981, when then-Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A.
Volcker could defend the dollar with double-digit interest rates.
Today interest rates must remain low, but even so, our ability to
grow depends on the caprice of global markets. It depends
specifically on the willingness of the rest of the world's nations to
add to their holding of dollars and dollar debts. This they have
done, without fail, for 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   But will they continue, in the face of low interest rates, a flat
stock market, deepening Japanese stagnation, debt defaults in Latin
America and perhaps an unpopular war? Or will they start shifting
assets out of dollars, adding a dose of devaluation, and perhaps
inflation, to our miseries? Will they perhaps turn Europe -- with its
balanced economy, diversified energy sources and low military
spending -- into a rising center of world finance? And if that starts
to happen, how on earth should we respond?</TE>
<TE>   It's not an easy question. There is certainly no easy answer. But
we may need to ponder it if we hope to enjoy a return to prosperity
any time soon.</TE>

<HD>When a Nation Turns Nasty</HD>
<DH>As income gap grows, so does tension between Chavez's
allies and foes.</DH>

<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>A new revolution is underway in Venezuela. But it won't produce the
social reforms President Hugo Chavez vows to impose. Nor is it the
revolution promised by the opponents who would like to oust him.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, both sides are unwittingly collaborating to usher in a
new era, where violence and intolerance are the standard for politics
in this country of 24 million. Revolutions, even peaceful ones, have
victims, and in Venezuela the victim may well be civility.</LD>
<LD>   This new revolution has been brewing for decades, as the chasm has
widened between those who benefited from the country's oil wealth and
the ranks of the poor. But it was the April 11 coup attempt, which
temporarily ousted Chavez and left scores dead, that defined the days
to come. Those events made clear to both sides the power of violence.</LD>
<TE>   For most of the last decade, Venezuela avoided falling into the
habits of casual violence that have plagued its neighbor Colombia.
But today, nearly four years after Chavez was swept into office with
his messianic promise of leading the country's swelling number of
poor into the promised land of the middle class, Venezuela is one of
the most polarized countries in Latin America. The space for dialogue
and tolerance is quickly fading, and what remains is a country where
violence is the language of choice.</TE>
<TE>   In Caracas, once-peaceful neighborhoods have been transformed into
pro- or anti-Chavez strongholds. At Plaza Francia, a square once
known as a tranquil Sunday afternoon gathering spot, a group of
dissident military officials has taken over. A sign proclaiming it a
"free territory" greets visitors who come to hear the former officers
call for Chavez's removal. The daily speeches are laced with attacks
on Chavez's character, including accusations that he is a murderer
and coward.</TE>
<TE>   Less than a mile away, a group of Chavez supporters is camped out
at the offices of the state-run oil company. Signs warn opponents
this area is off limits to "coup plotters," a reference to the
president's opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Such scenes are repeated throughout the city. Bakeries have
erupted into violence after pro- and anti-Chavez customers have
exchanged words. Foreign newspapers report a growing number of
divorces over political differences.</TE>
<TE>   In some neighborhoods, Chavez opponents and supporters toss
firecrackers at one another's homes. "I know of a building where the
neighbors no longer speak to each other," said Hugo Gomez, a
47-year-old former bank manager who, thanks to the recession, now
drives a taxicab. "It got so bad that we've declared my apartment
complex a neutral area," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But he can't insulate himself from the hatred that is increasingly
becoming a way of life. Recently, he said, a woman sat on the hood of
his cab and tried to prevent him from driving to work during a
nationwide work stoppage called by the opposition. "I tried to
explain to her I wasn't pro- or anti-Chavez but simply a man in need
of earning his living," he said. "But she wasn't satisfied with my
explanation and began calling all sort of names and insulting me.
I've never had anything like that happen to me."</TE>
<TE>   For many Venezuelans, the deterioration of simple civility is of
greater concern than who rules the country. Chavez opponents, not
content to simply advocate regime change, carry placards featuring
Chavez's head in a toilet and chant, "You son of a bitch!" During a
march this month to commemorate South American liberator Simon
Bolivar's death, police worked to avert a confrontation between pro-
and anti-Chavez forces. As I walked past the crowd, one Chavista spat
in my face, smiling when he saw me recoil. He believed the press had
taken sides with opposition leaders. A few blocks earlier, a Chavez
foe had yelled at me that foreign reporters are ignorant.</TE>
<TE>   Demonstrators on each side insist it is the other that has
abandoned dialogue. "We are only defending ourselves," an opposition
marcher told me, pointing to the flowers tied to the end of a flag as
evidence of the peaceful nature of the Bolivar rally. But when the
crowd reached the wall of police trying to keep the two sides apart,
the scene resembled a World Wrestling Federation match more than a
peaceful march to honor South America's most revered hero.</TE>
<TE>   The country's electronic news media, too, have joined the fray.
All four of the country's privately owned TV stations have replaced
their usual commercials with anti-Chavez ads calling for the
president to step down. Soap operas and variety shows have been taken
off the air to provide room for broadcasts that feature lengthy
speeches and the opposition's calendar of events.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, on the state-run TV station, government officials
insist that there are no major problems facing the country, even
denying the existence of lines at gasoline stations that have
followed a strike by oil workers.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Chavez stays or goes, life has changed in Venezuela.
Hatred and anger have taken over its streets and citizens. Whoever
governs the country going forward will face the huge task of
restoring civility, because without it, no side wins.</TE>

<HD>Stimulate, but Watch the Red Ink</HD>
<DH>Four Economic Views: There's one point on which analysts
agree: The U.S. economy is shaky. But beyond that basic truth, there
is little consensus. Why things soured, how to get back on track,
even how bad the situation really is: All these points are hotly
debated in financial circles. We asked four economists to look at the
state of the economy and propose solutions. Their ideas are presented
here.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rudolph G. Penner</AU>
<BD>Rudolph G. Penner is a senior fellow at the Urban
Institute. He was director of the Congressional Budget Office from
1983 to 1987.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>We are witnessing a new twist in the longtime struggle between tax
cutters and budget balancers. In an astounding role reversal, many
Democrats have donned the hair shirt of fiscal responsibility worn
for so many decades by Republicans -- who never gained much political
advantage from their economic rectitude. Meanwhile, the Republicans
have become the good-time party of government largess, offering tax
cuts for every occasion.</LD>
<LD>   But to understand the switch, one must understand the reasons
behind it. And here it becomes apparent that the parties -- and
factions within the parties -- approach the balance between tax cuts
and balanced budgets very differently.</LD>
<LD>   So what are the nuances of today's positions? Both parties have a
smattering of traditional conservatives who approach budget questions
from a strong belief in reducing the size and scope of government.
They think that the best way to limit government spending is to limit
revenues: You have to starve the beast in order to control the beast.</LD>
<TE>   There is an element of truth to this theory. Almost certainly,
government spending is lower today than it would be if President
Reagan had not managed to pass his large tax cuts in 1981. But
spending was never brought down to quite the levels hoped for by
supporters of Reagan's initial tax cuts, and many of the cuts were
whittled away by a series of significant tax increases between 1982
and 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Supply-siders also favor tax cuts. This faction believes tax cuts
are the quickest way to promote economic growth -- with the most
rabid of the breed believing that tax cuts will ultimately increase
revenues. Again, there is an element of truth to the theory. Tax
burdens can become so oppressive that they stifle economic activity
and encourage illegal tax evasion. When some marginal income tax
rates exceeded 90%, they may have had such an effect. But we got rid
of such absurdly high tax rates long ago, and empirical evidence
strongly suggests that across-the-board cuts in today's rates would
reduce, not increase, revenues.</TE>
<TE>   Among the budget balancers, the most extreme faction argues that,
contrary to conventional wisdom, increased government deficits do not
stimulate the economy. Rather, they raise interest rates so much that
deficits become contractionary by stifling investment. Like
supply-side economics, this theory suffers from a lack of empirical
support. It is difficult to find any relationship at all between
deficits and interest rates. This does not necessarily mean that no
relationship exists. It just means that it is overwhelmed by other,
more important factors such as monetary policy and changes in
inflation.</TE>
<TE>   Tax cutters often seize on the weak relationship between interest
rates and deficits to rationalize increasing the deficit. But
deficits negatively affect the economy whether or not they push up
interest rates. Deficits tap private savings, leaving less to finance
investment. They also increase our reliance on foreign borrowing.
Ultimately, deficits reduce national wealth, and that is bound to
reduce long-run living standards.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest deficit danger, though, is that the national debt will
get completely out of control, increasing faster than our incomes.
The interest bill on that debt is also then likely to grow faster
than our incomes. It can then become politically impossible to raise
taxes and cut spending fast enough to keep up with the rising
interest bill, which can cause debt to explode. Governments often
print money under these circumstances to avoid issuing more debt.
Hyperinflation soon follows.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s and early 1990s, there was cause to worry about an
exploding debt. Between 1979 and 1993, the debt rose from 26% to 50%
of gross domestic product. It was imperative that we do something
about the situation, and we abandoned all thought of using deficit
increases to stimulate the economy. Taxes were actually raised during
the recessions of 1982 and 1990.</TE>
<TE>   It is hard to feel the same sense of urgency about today's
deficit. It was $159 billion in 2002. Adjusted for the size of the
economy, 1983's deficit would have amounted to more than $600
billion. That does not mean that today's deficit is desirable; it
only means that it is not alarming. Ironically, that makes it harder
to make fiscal policy choices. We cannot focus single-mindedly on
deficit reduction, which means that every call to increase the
deficit must be weighed on its merits.</TE>
<TE>   Passive increases in deficits are generally acceptable when they
are the result of wars or recessions. It is very inefficient to
respond to every temporary change in the budget by changing tax laws.
Moreover, increased deficits can cushion reductions in economic
activity associated with recessions.</TE>
<TE>   The question before us at the moment is whether we should be more
aggressive and purposely increase the deficit with the goal of ending
the sluggishness now afflicting the economy. I do not believe that
would be wise. It would be almost impossible to design a package,
implement it and have it affect economic behavior before the second
half of next year. Almost all economic forecasters see the economy
resuming its recovery at a decent pace before then. Of course,
forecasts do not typically factor in a war. If war with Iraq were to
go badly, and there were a very large and lasting effect on oil
prices, some fiscal relief would then be justified.</TE>
<TE>   The administration properly differentiates proposals aimed at
increasing jobs from proposals aimed at enhancing long-run economic
growth. It is discussing some appealing tax cuts to promote the
latter. These include reducing the heavy tax burden on dividends,
increasing deductions for capital losses and increasing deductions
for retirement saving plans such as IRAs. In many economic models,
such tax cuts can enhance economic growth for a time despite their
negative effect on the deficit. Unfortunately, the ill effect of the
deficit grows as the interest bill on the associated debt grows.
Eventually, the positive effects of improved incentives are
overwhelmed by the negative effects of the revenue loss.</TE>
<TE>   The answer is clear.</TE>
<TE>   If President Bush wants tax cuts aimed at growth, he should offer
them in the context of a credible overall budget plan that shows
progress in reducing the budget deficit over time. If the
deficit-increasing effects of growth-oriented tax cuts are countered,
they will have an unambiguously positive effect. Liberals will
protest tax cuts for capitalists, but that argument has never
resonated well with voters -- and today there are many more
capitalists than there used to be.</TE>
<TE>   It will not won't be easy to develop such a plan. Republicans are
committed to providing prescription drug coverage under Medicare --
the most important spending initiative in decades -- and they will be
pressured to provide expensive tax cuts to limit the number of
citizens drifting under the alternative minimum tax. But a long-term
deficit-reduction plan could be managed if discretionary spending,
including defense, is treated austerely.</TE>
<TE>   Managing all this will take leadership from Bush. Budgeting must
be done with discipline. The president will have to veto some
spending measures, which he has not done so far. The compassionate
conservative will have to become less compassionate.</TE>

<HD>Deficits Are OK in the Short Run</HD>
<DH>Four Economic Views: There's one point on which analysts
agree: The U.S. economy is shaky. But beyond that basic truth, there
is little consensus. Why things soured, how to get back on track,
even how bad the situation really is: All these points are hotly
debated in financial circles. We asked four economists to look at the
state of the economy and propose solutions. Their ideas are presented
here.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert M. Solow</AU>
<BD>Robert M. Solow is an emeritus professor of economics
at MIT and winner of the 1987 Nobel Price for economics.</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Reasonable economic policy is always a balancing act. The short-term
needs of the economy have to be balanced against long-term needs.
Private interests have to be balanced against public interests.
Policies to benefit the well-off and well-placed few must be balanced
against policies that benefit ordinary folk, because economic
strategies, whatever their intended purpose, tend to aid some groups
and harm others.</LD>
<LD>   To take an obvious example: Budget deficits play a useful role in
a temporary recession when the basic problem is a shortage of buyers
for goods and services. But over the long haul, chronic deficits can
be a major drag, particularly if the basic problem is the need to
build up productive capacity by investment and saving. Economic
decisions are difficult, pitting one worthy goal against another:
Should we improve education and infrastructure, say, or stimulate
private consumption?</LD>
<TE>   The Bush administration has failed to express coherent ideas about
the balance between short- and long-term goals, simply reiterating a
belief that cutting taxes is good, year in and year out. One effect
of tax reduction is to cause revenues to disappear and thus make it
harder for Congress to meet the popular need for public services. On
the one hand, the administration wants to shrink and marginalize most
functions of the federal government. But on the other hand, it
advocates spending much more on the military and policing. This has
been one persistent thread in the administration's economic policy.</TE>
<TE>   Another has been to transfer income and wealth from low- and
middle-income families to the already rich. Last year's showpiece tax
bill was the major instrument, of course. But even the gutting of
environmental regulations seems designed to favor large oil, timber
and other companies. In one of the dramatic culture changes of recent
years, it is no longer politically necessary to hide regressive
shifts of income and wealth from poorer to richer in anything but the
most perfunctory way.</TE>
<TE>   How do these policies connect to the current scene? If the
preliminary figures for third-quarter gross domestic product are
about right, our economy will have grown about 3% in the last year.
That is not a bad average rate of growth, but the fourth quarter of
2002 is expected to be noticeably weaker. In any case, the strong
rebound that usually follows even a mild recession has not occurred.
In the third quarter of 2001, we were in a recession, and average
growth since then has left the economy with some slack. The
unemployment rate is at 6% and could safely fall to 5%, which would
add almost 1.5 million jobs. Capacity utilization in industry -- the
country's production capacity actually being used -- is now 75% to
76%; in the 1990s, it stood at 82% to 83%. There is clearly room for
the economy to expand toward its productive potential. That is what a
post-recession upswing is supposed to do. Instead, we have a hesitant
economy, with investors and consumers worried about the stock market,
Iraq and corporate swindles.</TE>
<TE>   So there is a case for a short-term stimulus. The economy would
sooner or later recover without one, but there is no virtue in
waiting around while capital and labor are standing idle. The
administration has talked about a package in the
$250-billion-to-$300-billion range, a substantial amount representing
2.5% to 3% of the gross domestic product.</TE>
<TE>   The trouble is that some of the elements being proposed would
provide no stimulus at all:</TE>
<TE>   * Ending the double taxation of dividends (corporate profits are
taxed at source, and then again if and when they are paid out in
dividends) may be a good thing or a bad thing, but it would have
trivial short-term effects on the economy. If it is, as expected, in
the administration's package, it would be merely another step in the
regressive redistribution of income.</TE>
<TE>   * Making the 2001 tax cuts permanent and accelerating their
implementation would be somewhat stimulative, but there are more
effective ways to stimulate the economy. Clearly, the main purpose of
that proposal is to take purchasing power away from the federal
government and deliver it to the wealthy.</TE>
<TE>   * More-favorable treatment of depreciation for corporate-tax
purposes would probably elicit very little new investment, given that
we have excess production capacity. But such action would surely
elicit thanks from corporate treasurers.</TE>
<TE>   So, what might the Democrats propose instead?</TE>
<TE>   * The extension of unemployment insurance benefits is as close to
a no-brainer as one is likely to find. (It should have been enacted
months ago and might appear in a Bush bill.)</TE>
<TE>   * Temporary tax reductions are generally not very powerful
incentives for immediate consumer spending, but a one-year
forgiveness of the Social Security payroll tax might work because
much of it would go to working families of modest means. The paper
loss to the Social Security Trust Fund could be made up from general
Treasury revenues.</TE>
<TE>   * There is urgent need for substantial revenue-sharing from the
federal government to the states, cities and counties. The recession
and slow recovery have gutted state and local revenues. Since they
operate under constitutional balanced-budget constraints, governors
and mayors are being forced to make drastic cuts in basic and
necessary public services. This weakens the economy -- states and
cities spend twice as much as the federal government -- and could
spell disaster for many low-income people who are the main
beneficiaries. An increase in the federal reimbursement for state
spending on Medicaid is an obvious candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Such moves would be expensive, certainly, but it all goes back to
that short-run/long-run distinction: When the economy is weak, as it
is now, there is no reason to shy away from deficit finance. What is
damaging to the longer-run growth of the economy is the accumulation
of debt into the future, when it runs the risk of shifting investors
away from private securities.</TE>
<TE>   One obvious possibility for preventing a long-term debt pileup is
to cancel as much of the regressive 2001 tax cut as necessary.
Getting rid of it will shore up federal revenues when the economy has
recovered and shortage of demand is no longer the problem. I think
Democrats could learn to like incentives for private and public
investment, but that is an issue for the longer run. The problem now
is to get there.</TE>

<LD>"The Secret Garden"</LD>
<LD>   By Frances Hodgson Burnett</LD>
<LD>   A plain story is what it might be to you at first, but once you
follow your imagination into the story, it becomes a book like never
before.</LD>
<TE>   Mary is a spoiled-rotten girl who lives in India. Ayahs (maids)
wait on her hand-and-foot.</TE>
<TE>   After her parents are killed, she moves to a grand mansion in
London. I shouldn't tell you any more or it will give the book away.</TE>
<TE>   "The Secret Garden" is a great book for the fourth grade and
higher. I hope you enjoy this book of happiness.</TE>

<TE>   By Paul Fleischman</TE>
<TE>   Wesley didn't have a lot of friends. One night, these weird seeds
flew into his backyard. Over the next few days little tiny red
flowers started popping up like umbrellas. They got bigger and bigger
and bigger. Wesley didn't know what they were. He used the plants to
make cool stuff like a flute, mosquito repellent, sunscreen and a
hammock. The kids thought it was cool.</TE>

<LD>Doug loved snow and ice. Soon he would be flying down that beautiful
white mountain that you can see from Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   He looked cool in his new teal blue parka, and he was about to do
something really cool. He was going to snowboard! His community group
had sponsored a trip to Mt. Baldy. As they loaded the bus and headed
toward the mountains, he boasted, "Watch me be the best! I was born
to snowboard! I own these mountains!"</LD>
<LD>   On the mountain they rented snowboards. Teresa, their instructor,
showed everyone how to carry the boards and how to balance and carve
their way down the mountain.</LD>
<TE>   "To stop, you sit down and fall back into the mountain," she said.
"Since this mountain is at a high angle, you'll just have to fall
back a foot or so. This is how snowboarders rest as well. Steepness
can be a snowboarder's best friend!"</TE>
<TE>   "I'll go first!" Doug told the others as he looked down the snowy
mountain. The trees below suddenly looked very small!</TE>
<TE>   Doug led the group down the hill right behind Teresa, who had told
them, "One at a time. Stay in a line. Follow me."</TE>
<TE>   "Wow! I'm doing it!" yelled Doug as he bent his knees low and
started carving a wide turn in the white layer of snow.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly he fell back and stopped.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone else stopped too -- almost on top of Doug.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you all right?" asked Teresa, as she made her way back to the
others.</TE>
<TE>   But Doug couldn't answer. He was too busy huffing and puffing. "It
must be the thin air up here," he explained.</TE>
<TE>   Teresa gave him a good hard look. "When was the last time you
exercised?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Ah ... well," Doug stammered.</TE>
<TE>   Helping him up, Teresa asked, "You mean you can't even remember!?
That's not good."</TE>
<TE>   Doug realized that it didn't matter how cool he looked or how well
he learned how to handle and ride a snowboard. Unless he was
physically fit, he couldn't do any of it!</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I'll need to work out more so the next time I come up
here I'll be able to snowboard instead of no-board!" he laughed.</TE>

<HD>L.A. rule aids tenants in no-fault evictions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Postema</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I am 77 years old and I have lived in my rent-controlled
apartment in Los Angeles for the last 26 years. If I were told to
move from my apartment for whatever reason, would I be eligible for
$2,000 or $5,000 in relocation assistance?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: If you were asked to leave the apartment as the result of
a no-fault eviction (one in which you were not at fault in any way),
such as an owner-occupancy eviction, you would be entitled to $5,000
for relocation assistance under the Los Angeles Rent Stabilization
Ordinance. Those entitled to the higher $5,000 level of assistance
include tenants 62 and older, the disabled and renters with children
younger than 18.</LD>
<LD>   Relocation fees apply only to no-fault evictions. If the reason
you are told to move because of an eviction where you are at fault,
such as for nonpayment of rent, you are not entitled to relocation
fees.</LD>
<TE>   Relocation fees are paid per unit</TE>
<TE>   Question: I am buying a rent-controlled triplex in Van Nuys and I
am planning to move into one of the units. I will have to evict two
tenants from a unit and I think that I may have to pay them $2,000
each in relocation fees. Is this true?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: This is not true. Relocation fees, which are only payable
to rent-controlled units in Los Angeles (other cities may have their
own versions of relocation assistance payment laws), are paid per
unit, not per tenant. If your tenants are entitled to relocation fees
under the law and the amount of the assistance is $2,000, then they
are entitled to $2,000 in total for relocation money, or $1,000 each.</TE>
<TE>   Is paint included in wear and tear?</TE>
<TE>   Question: A previous column said that painting and cleaning fees
can be charged against the security deposit, but charges for normal
wear and tear are exempt. Aren't painting and cleaning charges exempt
as normal wear and tear if someone lives in an apartment unit for at
least one year?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: You may think it's a dirty deal, but cleaning never is
considered normal wear and tear, even if you live in the apartment
for 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   If the apartment is clean when you move into it, it is your duty
to leave it just as clean. Otherwise, the landlord can deduct the
actual costs of cleaning the apartment to get it back into its
original condition.</TE>
<TE>   Painting charges are a horse of a different color. Although the
law does not specify how long normal wear and tear is for painting,
most courts have decided that it is somewhere between three and five
years, not one year.</TE>
<TE>   Thus if you live in the apartment for one year and it must be
repainted when you move out, expect to pay 66% to 80% of the painting
cost, the prorated amount of the paint job.</TE>
<TE>   For example, if the owner prorates the painting cost over five
years, you will be charged 80% of the cost of repainting. If the
owner uses three years, you would pay 66% of the cost.</TE>
<TE>   Owner must add interest to deposit</TE>
<TE>   Question: I own a rent-controlled apartment building in Los
Angeles and I have a long-term tenant who is moving out of the
building. When did the requirement to pay interest on security
deposits begin in the city?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: The requirement to pay interest on the security deposits
of tenants living in rent-controlled apartments in Los Angeles began
Nov. 1, 1990. Computing the amount of the interest is a bit of a
chore because there are different rates for different years. Interest
is paid at the following rates: from Nov. 1, 1990 to Dec. 31, 2000,
the rate is 5%; for calendar year 2001, 2%; for year 2002, 1.5%. The
rate falls to 1% for 2003.</TE>

<HD>Is flood insurance like money down the drain?</HD>
<DH>Residents in federally mandated areas must have coverage
despite dearth of rainfall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Bertolucci</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In John Sheppard's 35 years in Long Beach, he's never seen much in
the way of dramatic flooding. Heavy rains and clogged storm drains,
certainly, but not the sort of catastrophic 100-year flood that would
warrant the mandatory federal flood insurance imposed upon him from
1998 to 2002. This is the first winter in five years that Sheppard,
who owns a two-bedroom, one-bath home built in 1950, hasn't had to
pay about $300 annually for flood insurance.</LD>
<LD>   Luckily for Sheppard and more than 130,000 other residents of Long
Beach and nearby communities in Southeast Los Angeles County,
mandatory flood insurance ended a year ago with the completion of the
Los Angeles County Drainage Area project along the Los Angeles and
Rio Hondo rivers.</LD>
<LD>   But thousands more Southland homeowners, coastal and inland,
remain in federally mandated flood zones and must pay annual
insurance premiums ranging from $300 to $1,000.</LD>
<TE>   Even if you're not David Geffen's beachfront neighbor in Malibu,
or you're so far inland the only time you see the surf is on
"Baywatch" reruns, you still may reside in a flood plain. Pockets of
flood zones pepper the Southern California landscape. Steep canyons
that experience heavy runoff after winters rains, including areas in
Topanga Canyon, San Gabriel, Altadena, Malibu Lake and the Santa
Monica Mountains are mandatory coverage areas, according to Geoffrey
Owu, an associate civil engineer for the L.A. County Department of
Public Works.</TE>
<TE>   Although Los Angeles  County is a semiarid region that receives on
average less than 15 inches of rain per year, some of the mountain
areas receive more than 40 inches. Years of drought and sporadic
rainfall periodically yield to El Nino downpours that tear shrubs and
trees from parched hillsides, resulting in mudslides, plugged storm
drains and flooded streets. And beachfront homes and condos from
Santa Barbara to San Clemente can turn into breakwaters during harsh
storms.</TE>
<TE>   Six times in the last 121 years, Los Angeles rainfall totals have
exceeded 30 inches, more than twice the annual average. The most
recent 30-inch deluge in the 1997-98 season resulted in significant
regional flooding.</TE>
<TE>   In Laguna Beach, for instance, a wall of mud plowed through narrow
Laguna Canyon Road, killing two people and forcing the evacuation of
eight homes. And in Malibu, heavy rainfall caused an ocean cliff to
buckle and one home to collapse. In both areas, flood insurance was
mandatory.</TE>
<TE>   To clarify, flood insurance is required only if there's a mortgage
on a house in a mandatory area. If the house is paid off, the owner
isn't required to buy flood coverage.</TE>
<TE>   A mandatory flood policy purchased from conventional insurance
carriers such as Allstate or Travelers Insurance is actually a
federally backed policy from the National Flood Insurance Program
(NFIP), which is administered by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA). Most of the premium is funneled to a FEMA-managed
fund, which is used to finance disaster-relief efforts across the
nation.</TE>
<TE>   Technically, the NFIP expires Tuesday because Congress failed to
renew the program before adjourning in November. However, U.S. Reps.
Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio) and Barney Frank (D-Mass.) said they will
introduce legislation to reauthorize the program.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of homeowners aren't required to buy flood coverage
-- and they don't. Long Beach insurance agent Ron Schwab estimates
that his office wrote from 30 to 40 flood insurance policies before
the federal requirement was lifted in that area. Now they have "three
or four" policies.</TE>
<TE>   Since the standard homeowners policy doesn't cover flood damage,
an extra policy may be worth the added expense, according to FEMA and
insurance industry officials.</TE>
<TE>   "If you get wiped out by a flood, your homeowner's insurance won't
pay anything," said Ed Charlebois, head of flood insurance for
Travelers. "If water rises up [into your home] from a creek, a river
or the ocean, that's viewed as flooding and won't be covered."</TE>
<TE>   Flood insurance coverage typically goes beyond natural disasters.
For instance, it will cover a sewer line that backs up into your
bathroom and drenches the carpet.</TE>
<TE>   Charlebois' argument could be dismissed as an insurance industry
scare tactic, but federal officials agree that flood insurance makes
sense for many homeowners. "People who live in flood plains sometimes
believe they'll get disaster assistance if they're flooded, but the
vast majority of floods aren't presidentially declared disasters,"
said FEMA flood planner Michael Shore.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, not all coastal towns are subject to
mandatory insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in a moderate or minimal flood-hazard zone, and flood
insurance isn't mandatory here," said Howard Fishman, risk manager
for the city of Manhattan Beach. "It boils down to two words: storm
drains. We have some steep streets, but our storm drains capture the
water from heavy rains."</TE>
<TE>   Some homeowners in flood-prone areas adopt the
better-safe-than-sorry philosophy and buy flood coverage. .</TE>
<TE>   "I bought it voluntarily because I thought there was a real
[flood] risk," said Downey homeowner and former City Council member
Diane Boggs, who bought the insurance for her previous home, which
was was in a flood plain. "It was during the El Nino years."</TE>
<TE>   Some homeowners, such as Long Beach resident Joe Sopo, consider
the insurance a thinly veiled "flood tax" designed to fatten the
Feds' disaster relief pot.</TE>
<TE>   "We referred to it as a flood tax, not flood insurance," said
Sopo, a real estate agent. "Sometimes you feel like you're
subsidizing those people you see in the news where one of the major
rivers in the Midwest has flooded," said Jeanette Gavin, president of
the Belmont Shore Residence Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Her Long Beach neighborhood of about 3,000 homes, located near San
Pedro Bay, is required to have the insurance. Other homeowners
disagree with the flood-tax conspiracy theory. "These were engineers,
not politicians," who built the flood models of the L.A. Basin, Boggs
said, and they weren't concerned with fattening FEMA's disaster fund.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with high premiums, Charles Wolter learned during a
city-sponsored flood insurance meeting that Belmont Shore residents
could slash premiums by having their properties surveyed. The surveys
showed that more than 30 homes were above the flood plain. Their
insurers, after receiving this information, switched the homeowners
to discounted "preferred risk" policies.</TE>
<TE>   "As a group, we saved over $10,000," Wolter said.</TE>

<HD>El Segundo is a leafy refuge on the urban edge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>June Casagrande</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>El Segundo is a little slice of small-town living tucked into the
most unlikely place: under the roar of Los Angeles International
Airport, in between the Hyperion sewage treatment plant and the
Chevron refinery, and fringed by its own high-powered commercial
district, home to such corporate heavyweights as Boeing Co. and
Mattel Inc. Drawing card</LD>
<LD>   With its convenient location near jobs, transportation and
beaches, the city draws people seeking a quaint, close-knit community
just minutes from the big city. Not surprisingly, it's an oasis for
many airline workers. It's also a place from which  executives can
leave their glass skyscrapers and return to tree-lined neighborhoods
in about five minutes without even taking advantage of the 105 and
405 freeways. Low crime rates sweeten the deal.</LD>
<LD>   Wow factor</LD>
<TE>   With a Main Street that could have been inspiration for Norman
Rockwell, the downtown area includes the elements for creating a
community where neighbors know each other's names: a park, a
well-tended library and even an indoor public swimming pool.</TE>
<TE>   Hot spots</TE>
<TE>   The oval that forms the center of town and includes addresses in
the 500, 600 and 700 blocks of mostly east-west streets is widely
considered the place to buy. Homes for sale here average between
$500,000 and $800,000.</TE>
<TE>   The northeast part of town has recently been dubbed "Million
Dollar Hill." This small elevated area contains a handful of houses
that are El Segundo's priciest. A roughly 4,000-square-foot home at
the corner of Walnut Avenue and Bungalow Drive is listed at $1.2
million. Another on Bungalow Drive sold recently for more than $2

<TE>   Just seven homes were for sale in mid-December, one of them a
condominium, another a townhome. They range from $299,000 to $1.2
million. In 2000, 58% of households rented the units they occupied.</TE>
<TE>   Good news, bad news</TE>
<TE>   Despite the many pluses of El Segundo, so named because it was the
site of Standard Oil Co.'s second refinery, there are some downsides.
The biggest drawbacks loom on the outskirts of this 5 1/2-square-mile
city. Los Angeles International Airport is busy, loud and imposing.
The Hyperion Wastewater Treatment Plant, near the ocean, can be
unpleasant when the air wafts inland.</TE>
<TE>   Also, City Hall has been called insensitive to renters and
rental-property owners in lower-cost neighborhoods. About three years
ago, city officials created a dog park on Imperial Avenue without
notifying neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Report card</TE>
<TE>   The El Segundo Unified School District is made up of two
elementary schools, a middle school and two high schools. Measured by
the state's latest Academic Performance Index, the elementary schools
and middle school are the strongest. In 2002, Richmond Street
Elementary scored 866 and Center Street Elementary scored 851 out of
a possible 1,000, both surpassing the state target of 800. El Segundo
Middle School scored 853. El Segundo High had a score of 786. Arena
High, a nontraditional, self-directed-study program, scored 576.</TE>
<TE>   Weather report</TE>
<TE>   El Segundo's location next to the ocean keeps temperatures
comfortable. Winter temperatures range from 46 to 64 degrees; summer

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jim Nabors slept here. The actor-singer, who gained fame as goober
Gomer Pyle in his own comedy series (1964-72), once called this
classic Bel-Air estate home.</LD>
<LD>   Almost every room in the Mediterranean mansion opens to a
city-to-ocean view, and yet the house and its grounds are private.
The landscaping, with antique brick pathways and sandstone retaining
walls, helps to ensure seclusion. There is a courtyard with a
fountain and a hidden lily pond with a wishing bridge.</LD>
<LD>   The estate was built in 1938 for an owner of the Portland Cement
Co.</LD>
<TE>   About this house: The view is the thing, from downtown L.A. to the
Pacific. The more than 1.5 acres of grounds slope gently to the
south, opening the house to sunlight from dawn to dusk. There is a
sunroom in the master bedroom to take advantage of the light. The
suite also has a study-library with a wet bar, walk-in wardrobes and
an onyx bathroom and sauna, which open to a balcony. Downstairs,
there is a terrace between the living and dining rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Asking price: $12.9 million</TE>
<TE>   Size: The home has five bedrooms in 8,900 square feet, and it is
on 1.63 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Features: The property, which runs from street to street and is at
the end of a cul-de-sac, has a four-car garage and on-site parking
for 14 guest cars. There is more parking along the driveway. There is
also a guest or staff cottage off the porte-cochere. Among the other
features are a wine cellar, breakfast room, butler's pantry and large
living room with a fireplace. On a lower floor opening out to the
pool are a projection-game room and an English pub room with a bar
and a fully equipped catering kitchen.</TE>

<HD>He flirted, now Dr. Phil's ready for commitment</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Ruth Ryon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Phil McGraw, host of the syndicated talk show "Dr. Phil," and his
wife, Robin, liked the area where they had been leasing so much that
they purchased a newly built home in Beverly Hills just before the
holidays for about $7.5 million in cash, real estate sources said.</LD>
<LD>   They had been leasing another Beverly Hills home at $20,000 a
month since coming to California from Texas this past year.</LD>
<LD>   The home they bought has about five bedrooms in an estimated
12,000 square feet. The walled and gated home, on nearly an acre,
also has two fireplaces, a library, a master suite with a sitting
room, limestone floors, a pool, a guesthouse, a three-car garage and
a circular drive.</LD>
<TE>   The pool is lined with imported, mature palm trees, and there is a
grand entry in the main house, with a sweeping circular staircase.</TE>
<TE>   "Dr. Phil" was launched in September. Before that, the Dallas
psychologist, 52, appeared weekly for a few years on "The Oprah
Winfrey Show," wrote self-help books and co-founded the Texas-based
legal consulting firm Courtroom Sciences Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Winfrey became his mentor after he coached her through a lawsuit
and trial with the Texas cattle industry. Winfrey credited him with
helping her to triumph in the case in which a cattle breeders'
association had filed a libel suit over remarks Winfrey had made
about beef.</TE>
<TE>   'Happy Days' mom lists home</TE>
<TE>   Marion Ross, who played Mrs. Cunningham on the sitcom "Happy Days"
(1974-1984) and has a recurring role as Drew Carey's mother on "The
Drew Carey Show," has listed one of her two beach houses in Cardiff
by the Sea at $679,000.</TE>
<TE>   The actress has lived primarily at her Happy Days Farm in Woodland
Hills since the early 1980s, but she also has owned the side-by-side
beach cottages for years, inheriting the one she is selling from her
mother in 1973. Ross has been using that cottage as a guesthouse and
the other one as a weekend getaway.</TE>
<TE>   She long held a notion of growing old in one of the cottages while
housing help in the other. Instead, Ross, in her early 70s, put a
second story on one so she could see the ocean, "and it turned out to
be so grand, we didn't need the other house," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The house that is on the market has two bedrooms and one bathroom
in slightly more than 1,200 square feet. It was built in 1951 and has
French doors, formal living and dining rooms, hardwood floors,
Spanish tile and a den with a wood-burning fireplace. The houses are
four blocks from the beach and about a 30-minute drive north of San
Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Ross recently appeared on "Gilmore Girls," "That '70s Show" and
"Touched by an Angel." She is also the voice of the grandmother on
the popular children's cartoon show "SpongeBob SquarePants."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Howard and Michael Hegedus at Coldwell Banker, Encinitas,
have the listing.</TE>
<TE>   From Down Under to Hills dweller</TE>
<TE>   Natalie Imbruglia, the singer-songwriter who was once a soap-opera
star in her native Australia, has purchased a Hollywood Hills home
for about $2.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Imbruglia, 27, bought a five-bedroom, 5,400-square-foot
Mediterranean-style home, built in the 1950s. The house also has six
bathrooms, a media room, a deck, a guest room/office, a patio with
fountains and city views, and an attached three-car garage.</TE>
<TE>   The singer, who became a pop sensation four years ago with her hit
single "Torn" from her debut album, "Left of the Middle," left L.A.
earlier this month to go on tour in Australia. She appears in the
movie "Johnny English," a British spy spoof starring Rowan Atkinson
and John Malkovich. It is scheduled for release in March.</TE>
<TE>   'Gilmore Girls' actor makes move</TE>
<TE>   Chad Michael Murray, who has had recurring roles on the WB's
"Gilmore Girls" and "Dawson's Creek" and plays the Lone Ranger in a
two-hour movie to air on the WB in February, has purchased a Sherman
Oaks townhouse for nearly $600,000.</TE>
<TE>   The actor, 21, moved to L.A. from Buffalo, N.Y., a little more
than two years ago. He plans to do some remodeling, putting in
hardwood floors and new tile in the three bathrooms. The
2,500-square-foot townhouse has three bedrooms, a fireplace, spa and
deck with a bar.</TE>
<TE>   Murray recently completed principal photography on the Disney
movie "Freaky Friday," due out next fall.</TE>
<TE>   Francine C. Meyberg of Coldwell Banker, Sherman Oaks/Encino,
represented Murray in his purchase.</TE>
<TE>   'NYPD Blue's' McGee trades up</TE>
<TE>   Jack McGee, who plays Sgt. Mahoney on "NYPD Blue" and Bert on
"Family Affair," and his wife, Stephanie, have purchased a Studio
City home for $589,000 and sold their former home, in the same area,
for $480,000.</TE>
<TE>   The McGees sold their former home to Kevin Blank, visual effects
supervisor for the TV series "Alias." Blank moved up from a Studio
City condo he bought two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The house that the McGees bought has two bedrooms in 1,420 square
feet. Built in 1949, the traditional-style home also has two
fireplaces, a den, a dining room with wainscoting; plantation
shutters, hardwood floors and ceilings with wood beams.</TE>
<TE>   The house that the McGees sold has three bedrooms in 1,550 square
feet. The Spanish-style home, built in 1923, also has a guesthouse,
gardens and a pool.</TE>
<TE>   McGee, who worked as a firefighter in New York City before he
became an actor, has appeared in such movies as "Basic Instinct"
(1992), "Backdraft" (1991), "Born on the Fourth of July" (1989) and
"Lethal Weapon 2" (1989). He has been in many series and had a
recurring role in "Chicago Hope."</TE>
<TE>   Diane Sydell of Prudential, John Aaroe, in Encino represented the
McGees in selling and buying, and she represented Blank in buying the
McGees' former home and his condo.</TE>
<TE>   The wrecking ball fells Pink Palace</TE>
<TE>   High-end sales watchers might be so dazzled by the numbers on the
Westside this year that they haven't noticed that a well-known Holmby
Hills house that sold in September is no longer there.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't officially a landmark, but it was a familiar sight for
many motorists and Old Hollywood fans traveling on Sunset Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   The Pink Palace, which became famous as the home of the late
actress Jayne Mansfield, was built in 1935 for crooner Rudy Vallee.
Until September, it had been owned since the '70s by singer Engelbert
Humperdinck.</TE>
<TE>   The seven-bedroom, 8,200-square-foot house, on 1.5 acres, was sold
as part of a 10-acre compound that included two other homes, one of
which also has been razed. The compound sold in the low $30-million
range to Roland Arnall and his wife, Dawn. He is a longtime
Democratic supporter and owner of Ameriquest Capital, a financial
services company.</TE>
<TE>   The Pink Palace needed work, and it would have been hard to fix
with its small rooms, low ceilings and few closets. The lot, which
sloped into a ravine, needed regrading, Realtors said. This might
explain why the house had been on and off the market for 13 years.</TE>

<KH>114TH ROSE PARADE</KH>
<HD>When the world passes by your door</HD>
<DH>Residents on Pasadena's parade route endure the bleachers
and enjoy the spectacle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Wedner</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's 48 hours before New Year's Eve, and the Eaves family of Pasadena
already is bracing for the revelry of uninvited guests: The cyclone
fence is up around the property, the security guard is posted outside
to keep strangers at bay and their party guests are armed with
street-access passes to clear police lines. By dawn, Rose Parade
marching bands will be tuning up outside their South Orange Grove
Boulevard condominium amid neighing horses.</LD>
<LD>   But the inconveniences are worth it to the Eaves, who awake at
4:30 a.m. and fling open the curtains so that their grandkids and
guests can be among the first to see three-story floats a stone's
throw away.</LD>
<LD>   "We love it," said Hayden Eaves. "It's a great big party out
there, and we wouldn't miss it."</LD>
<TE>   For the 350 million TV viewers worldwide who tune in to the Rose
Parade, the annual extravaganza offers a finely orchestrated
spectacle of floats, bands and horses making their way down the
commercial stretch of Colorado Boulevard from the residential Orange
Grove.</TE>
<TE>   What they don't see are the monstrous grandstands that go up
before Christmas and obscure some properties, the portable toilets
that dot neighborhoods and the year-end incursion of RVs that park in
front of homes the last three days of the year. Judging from years
past, homeowners mostly will barricade their properties and enjoy the
festivities, suffering surprisingly little property damage.</TE>
<TE>   "For 24 hours, once a year, I can give up privacy and access,"
said Boyd Smith, who lives on a stretch of Orange Grove a couple of
blocks from the parade's staging point. "I'd give a week up. The
parade brings a lot to the community."</TE>
<TE>   And it does bring a lot, like up to 1 million visitors, or 10
times the city's population. Thousands of early-bird visitors sack
out the night before in front of homes that range from $350,000
condos and townhouses to multimillion-dollar mansions. Then there are
the hordes who descend on east Pasadena neighborhoods for the
post-parade viewing of floats. Parade organizers devote two
committees exclusively to the needs of homeowners who live near the
staging and end points.</TE>
<TE>   Residents in those areas do enjoy some perks: a pre-parade
reception at the Tournament House, the $15-million Wrigley estate
that serves as parade headquarters, and free tickets to the
post-parade display of floats for residents near the terminus.</TE>
<TE>   When selling a home here, disclosure rules require that
information about the parade be given to prospective buyers because
homeowners are entitled to the "quiet enjoyment of one's property,"
said Jack Cooley, manager of the Coldwell Banker's Colorado Boulevard
office.</TE>
<TE>   "Our first year here, we didn't want to stay in town; we thought
it would be a disaster," said Joanne Eaves, who takes her
grandchildren and guests for a tour of the floats and a
people-watching expedition every year after New Year's Eve dinner.
"But it was great."</TE>
<TE>   The party atmosphere begins at 9 p.m. on Dec. 31 and lasts until
early in the morning, participants say, when die-hard revelers sit in
bleachers or lawn chairs in front of their homes to watch the parade.</TE>
<TE>   Preparing the neighborhoods is a monumental task involving
hundreds of volunteers, said Scott Jenkins, chairman of the
Tournament of Roses formation area committee that secures the parade
staging area the night before, places the floats in order and assists
residents as they try to navigate the neighborhood before the
extravaganza.</TE>
<TE>   "After 114 years, we've perfected this," Jenkins said. "The
residents are very supportive; they feel the sense of history and
tradition and like being a part of it."</TE>
<TE>   The first Rose Parade, staged in 1890 by members of Pasadena's
exclusive Valley Hunt Club to showcase California's mild winter,
attracted 2,000 to the town of 391. Many of the early residents were
wealthy winter transplants from the East and Midwest who had built
huge mansions along what is now Orange Grove and is mostly
condominiums and apartments. The city's current 134,000 residents
play host to as many as a million parade visitors.</TE>
<TE>   With the human invasion have come some problems homeowners never
dreamed of, said Vince Farhat, a former South Orange Grove
condominium resident. The year his homeowners' association declined
to put a fence up due to financial considerations, he walked outside
on New Year's Day and stumbled over scores of strangers on the
property's front lawn, sleeping or barbecuing on hibachis.</TE>
<TE>   Another year, Farhat said, some condo residents found parade
revelers using the complex's laundry room as a public bathroom.
Dealing with the intruders was a small price to pay for being in the
center of the action. But, he added, "the next year, we put up a
fence."</TE>
<TE>   To ward off vandalism and other damage, owners put up temporary
fences at their own expense. One corner homeowner spent $700 for the
extra security. Otherwise they are on their own with their home
insurance policy, except in the unlikely event that a float jumps a
curb, in which case the Tournament of Roses will cover the damage
claim. Pasadena handles claims under its jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   Location is everything, even in a parade. The Eaves' condo sits on
a choice spot for TV cameras. This year, as in the past, KTLA-TV has
put up a fence around the property in exchange for using the area as
a staging ground for some parade coverage. The television station,
which, along with the Los Angeles Times, is owned by Tribune Co.,
also supplies a private guard at the complex.</TE>
<TE>   The day-by-day playbook for parade preparations rivals those used
by the teams going to the Rose Bowl. From the 1,200 portable toilets
placed along the parade route to hot chocolate stands dotting the
boulevard, every detail is worked out well in advance, Jenkins said.</TE>
<TE>   Weeks before the parade, committees mail notices to residents who
live around the route, informing them of neighborhood restrictions
before and during the event. They also give them passes that allow
access to and from their streets Dec. 31 and Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Parking is restricted along the parade route and in front of
residents' homes. On Orange Grove, for example, only those with
passes can gain entrance to the area once the floats start to line up
about 9 p.m. on New Year's Eve. Vehicles that park within a block
north or south of the parade route are subject to parking
restrictions, including random vehicle searches by the Pasadena
Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   But the hundreds of recreational vehicles that flock to the city
before the parade are able to park in designated lots and overnight
on most other streets, said Janet Pope, a Police Department
spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Some homeowners use the event to start traditions.</TE>
<TE>   For four decades the Lamb mansion on Orange Grove was the place
for police to down doughnuts and coffee on New Year's morning during
a break in their patrol duty.</TE>
<TE>   Lucile and Lawrence Lamb bought their Victorian mansion, also
known as the Denham-Talcott mansion, in 1961 after their kids were
grown, but that didn't stop the extended family from showing up en
masse before New Year's Day every year to help put up bleachers in
the frontyard for parade viewing, said Bruce Lamb, 69, the couple's
son.</TE>
<TE>   One year, Lamb recalled, the family let ABC-TV to set up a
broadcasting tower in their backyard, which earned them a live
interview during the event.</TE>
<TE>   "We helped people out, and they helped us in return," Lamb said.
"The police protected our house from crowds who used to encroach on
the property on parade day. They kept an eye on our place."</TE>
<TE>   Where the parade ends, homeowners face a different onslaught.
Damian Washington and Sylvester Walters live on the stretch of East
Sierra Madre Boulevard where the crowds line up shoulder-to-shoulder
after the parade to view the floats. They've grown to tolerate the
situation over the years.</TE>
<TE>   "We're desensitized to it by now," Washington said. "You get the
horns blowing from visiting Rose Bowl teams and thousands of people,
but we put up with it. We've grown up here and know what to expect."</TE>

<HD>Mold verdict reduced on appeal</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Texas appeals court threw out most of a $32-million jury verdict
against Farmers Insurance Group on Dec. 19, cutting the award to the
$4-million range for a family's toxic-mold claims.</LD>
<LD>   The Austin court said it could not support the jury's findings
that a Farmers' subsidiary had "knowingly" breached its duty of good
faith and fair dealing toward Melinda Ballard, who had sued over
water and mold damage in her 22-room mansion.</LD>
<LD>   The 2001 verdict stunned insurers, who blamed rising claims for
mold and water damage for higher homeowners' premiums.</LD>

<KH>Destination: The Netherlands</KH>
<HD>In Amsterdam when it sizzles</HD>
<DH>It may be cold outside, but the city heats up as residents
and visitors, fired up on fireworks and champagne, ring in the New
Year.</DH>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>Amsterdam</DL>
<LD>When we lived in this city in 1998 and '99, we were always out of
town for New Year's Eve. The last week of December, we caught a train
to Paris or Bern, Switzerland, pushing against the tide of Brits,
French, Germans, Belgians -- seemingly everyone in Europe under 30 --
as they poured into Amsterdam.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike in the United States, where the holiday often calls for
private, indoor celebrations, Europeans mark New Year's Eve by
gathering in public spaces, from the Brandenburg Gate to the Bastille
to Trafalgar Square. Among these, Amsterdam's celebration has become
legendary, and last December my 18-year-old daughter, Kira, and I
came back here to see what we had missed.</LD>
<LD>   Although there were wisps of pink in the iron gray sky, it looked
cold outside as our train traveled from Brussels into the
Netherlands. Cows grazing in wet fields gave way to houses pressed
against one another.</LD>
<TE>   But I lost interest in the passing scenery when a cute blond came
aboard at Den Haag. She was 6 years old, decked in bright red
corduroy pants and matching boots. Her mother's gentle cry of
restraint, "Louisa! Louisa!" had no effect whatsoever as she
methodically punched her unperturbed (and sturdy) younger brother. As
our train pulled into Amsterdam's Centraal Station, she smiled at me
charmingly while landing the last few blows.</TE>
<TE>   After checking into the Hotel Acro near the Rijksmuseum in the
central city, we meandered toward Van Baerlestraat to see whether we
could find a favorite family-run restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Darkness comes early in wintry Amsterdam. It was a clear night,
perfect for -- brrrring ... BRRRRing -- dodging bicyclists and being
reminded, sternly, to stay out of their lane. After we were safely
anchored on the pedestrian path, we resumed our walk, which took us
past the museum's gardens, sidewalk artists and skaters on an ice
rink.</TE>
<TE>   A little farther and there it was: Djanoko Indonesisch Restaurant.
Amsterdam is filled with Indonesian restaurants, considered among the
best in the world and most offering a rijsttafel, or rice table, a
way to savor many Indonesian specialties. A hibachi is set before
you, and the parade begins. Dish after dish is brought out, till
delicacies crowd your table. Some are spicy, some mild, all
intriguingly different: white rice, fried rice, beef, pork, chicken,
satay, vegetables, fried coconut, eggs, peanut dishes and a variety
of sauces. Prices begin about $15 for 14 items and climb from there.</TE>
<TE>   After such a large meal, it felt good to take another long walk
along the city's quiet canals. We followed Nieuwe Spiegelstraat, the
street that stretches from the front of the Rijks. Crooked bridges
crossed over canals, the blackness twinkling with the reflection of
strings and strings of holiday lights. Below, houseboats were dressed
for the holidays with red ribbons and colored lights. Shop windows
bulged with antiques and toys, books and clothes. Sounds were so
muted that we could hear the lap of the water, the crunch of
footsteps, the soft whir of a bike. Too tired even to revisit the
cafe (now a wine bar) at the corner of Keizersgracht and Nieuwe
Spiegelstraat, we headed back to our hotel for sleep.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday morning in Amsterdam, there is only one place to be:
sipping tea as you read a paper, looking out onto Spui Square from
the cozy glass-enclosed porch of Cafe Luxembourg. All the expatriates
were here, having picked up their English-language papers at
Athenaeum Booksellers across the street. We lucked out and won a
prime front-row table facing the square. We nursed steaming cups of
hot tea and munched crisp biscotti, feeling lazy as bikes and trams
flew past outside.</TE>
<TE>   Not that we were going to waste the day. At Nieuwe Kerk (in nearby
Dam Square) there's always something interesting happening. Last year
it was the royal wedding between the crown prince of the Netherlands,
Willem-Alexander, and Maxima Zorreguieta, an Argentine. We became
privy to all their plans, from the tiered cake to the golden coach,
at a special exhibit fondly titled, "Ja, ik wil," or "Yes, I do."</TE>
<TE>   Next we wandered to Amsterdam's Historisch Museum. Kira had never
realized that it was originally a civic orphanage and wanted to take
a closer look. The museum's cafe-restaurant caught our eye because it
was serving a traditional Dutch winter favorite: erwten soep met
stokbrood. For $4, we each got a hearty bowl of pea soup, rich with
bites of sausage. With rugged brown bread on the side, it was just
the thing to keep us warm on a blustery day.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier I had spotted a sign at a restaurant on Begijnesteeg that
promised a wonderful apfelstrudel, and so, for dessert, we wandered
in that direction. Freshly made that morning and covered with vanilla
sauce, the apple strudel tasted all the better because it was served
in a rambling room in a centuries-old building by the handsome son of
the house. We chatted with his parents as they geared up for New
Year's Eve.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to eat tomorrow, you'll want to make a plan today,"
warned the wife, answering the phone yet again, though she had just
taken her last reservation. "On New Year's Eve, every restaurant in
Amsterdam is filled."</TE>
<TE>   For New Year's Eve we had put ourselves into the hands of our
friends the Russells, who were notorious for not planning. I crossed
my fingers.</TE>
<TE>   Snap, crackle and pop</TE>
<TE>   The morning of Dec. 31 was cold and wet, perfect for what I had in
mind. Poor weather often brings better deals, and I was hoping to
find some at the Monday morning flea market known as Noordermarkt.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a light rain, there was a spark of excitement in the air.
As I was about to drop a few postcards in a mailbox, a woman warned
me not to, saying, "It's New Year's Eve," as if that explained it
all. Inside the post office, I learned that some partyers have been
known to throw firecrackers through mail slots, and so, on New Year's
Eve, most locals leave mailboxes empty.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly I heard distant pop pop pops and fizzzzzzles, though they
had been there all morning. They would not be legal in the city for
several hours -- only from 4 p.m. Dec. 31 to 4 a.m. Jan. 1 are they
allowed -- but fireworks were going off all over Amsterdam. With
festivities sounding in the air, I worried that Noordermarkt would be
canceled.</TE>
<TE>   But when I arrived I saw rows of booths lining the cobbled square
behind North Church, or Noorderkerk. A calliope was playing.
Furniture, silver, leather, tins, hot egg rolls, carpets, thread, old
postcards, all were stacked enticingly in baskets and bins or spread
across the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Several happy hours later, laden with bags, Kira and I chanced
upon an antique store and cafe that promised "Drinks + Furniture for
Thee &amp; hot chocolate." For 20 minutes we relaxed in the cozy dining
area without being noticed. We would have liked a sip of that hot
chocolate, but we left without finding anyone to serve us.</TE>
<TE>   Later that day, after visiting the Rembrandts and Vermeers at the
Rijks- museum, we stopped at Small Talk, a cafe on Van Baerlestraat
that serves wonderful apple pancakes. Often signs in English signal a
touristy waste of time, but not here. The place always seems to be
filled with Dutch people ordering pannekoeken, which is exactly what
I was hungry for.</TE>
<TE>   I asked our waiter how much time an apple pancake would take.</TE>
<TE>   "Two days," he teased. "You want it? You want to take time? Should
I place order?"</TE>
<TE>   It was worth a good bit more than the 25-minute wait. Tender
chunks of apple were delicious in a large, thin pancake, sprinkled
generously with powdered sugar.</TE>
<TE>   Next we visited Albert Heijn (Holland's favorite grocery store)
across the street, and noticed a good price on French champagne. We
stocked up.</TE>
<TE>   That evening, people poured into squares throughout the city,
particularly the Dam, Rembrandtplein, Leidseplein and Nieuwmarkt,
where the Chinese community puts on a superb fireworks show that can
last two hours. In Leidseplein, where we went to meet the Russells,
bottle rockets streaked through the air while the Beatles' "All You
Need Is Love" blasted from speakers. The square was one enormous
party, complete with lasers, street performers, sparklers, dancing
and fire eaters. There were also bottles of champagne being shared
with strangers, an Amsterdam tradition.</TE>
<TE>   There were no entry charges, no corporate sponsors and, as far as
I could see, no regulations. The police were there only to discourage
violence and theft, not to spoil the festivities.</TE>
<TE>   But we had dinner to worry about. As suspected, the Russells had
not made reservations. But it pays to be a loyal customer, and their
favorite restaurant, Granada, promised to squeeze us in. I don't know
how they jammed another table in for us. The place was packed.</TE>
<TE>   After eating delicious tapas, we ordered paella, which usually
requires advance notice. We were the last customers to leave, well
past 11.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, the city was sizzling. Bursts of light filled the sky.
Firecrackers were going off by the pack. In Leidseplein they were
still passing around bottles of champagne. With no official countdown
to midnight, no gong, no ball drop, the crescendo seemed to build
like a wave; then it held, as revelers checked their watches,
realized the year had changed and grabbed someone to kiss.</TE>
<TE>   For Kira, Kim Russell and their friends, the night was young and
the party stretched across the city. But for the elder Russells and
me, it was time to retreat. As we left the madness behind, a low fog
rolled in. We crossed the canals, struck by how, only a few blocks
away, the crackle and boom of fireworks could fade and mellow. Even
on this rowdy night, the city offered pockets of tranquillity.</TE>
<TE>   The slumbering city</TE>
<TE>   On New Year's Day, Amsterdam sleeps in. At 11 a.m. Jan. 1, the
city was as silent as I have ever seen it. No one stirred. The loud
bangs had stopped. The fireworks were finished, leaving black streaks
and scorched confetti on the sidewalk. The Pancake Bakery on
Prinsengracht was rumored to be the only restaurant open.</TE>
<TE>   Kira and I planned to catch a bus to a friend's house, but even
the bus drivers were missing in action. We waited 50 long, cold
minutes before one came.</TE>
<TE>   But this is a city that knows how to recover from a hangover. By
evening, trams were running, the streets were clean, shops were open
and people were out -- ready to party again, I'm sure.</TE>

<DH>A House Somewhere: Tales of Life Abroad, Edited by Don
George and Anthony Sattin, Lonely Planet, $13.99 Time Out: Patagonia,
Time Out Guides Ltd., Penguin, $16.95 Manufacturing rebirth: Porches:
Art and Renewal on River Street, Photographs by Nicholas Whitman,

<AU>Christopher Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Does homemaking abroad really deserve its own literary genre? Clearly
the reading public thinks so, as evidenced by brisk sales of Peter
Mayle (who has made a career of writing about his French residency
since 1990's "A Year in Provence") and Frances Mayes (who gave her
home in Italy similar treatment in 1996's "Under the Tuscan Sun" and
sequels).</LD>
<LD>   Maybe, given the success of those two and many others in their
wake, it was inevitable that anthologies would follow.</LD>
<LD>   Sure enough, the writers in this book tell of new, renovated and
borrowed homes in foreign lands, of quirky contractors, eccentric
neighbors and the magic of looking up one day in a previously strange
place and realizing: I'm home now.</LD>
<TE>   But instead of piling on quaintness and condescension -- traits I
fear most in this home-away-from-home genre -- "A House Somewhere"
mostly takes a broader view and goes more places than one author
could take you.</TE>
<TE>   In many travel books, authors spin relatively meager experience
into overlong narrative.</TE>
<TE>   Here we have the opposite: Editors George and Sattin have selected
passages that compress rich, sustained experiences -- some pleasant,
some startling, some harrowing -- into few words.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those words are choice indeed, such as William Dalrymple's
account of the morning his landlord in New Delhi cut off his water
supply. The author had hosted guests the previous evening.</TE>
<TE>   "Last night I counted seven flushes," Dalrymple's Mrs. Puri
announces. "So I have cut off the water as protest."</TE>
<TE>   And then, he writes, "she paused to let the enormity of our crime
sink in."</TE>
<TE>   My favorite pieces were Vida Adamoli's touching and comic account
of local characters in an Italian beach town she calls Torre
Saracena, and Karl Taro Greenfeld's fond, dry-witted reminiscence of
his Paris student days in an enormous loft shared with a promiscuous
kleptomaniac, an inexpert painter of vast canvases depicting crucial
moments in St. Louis Cardinals baseball history, and a Nerf
basketball.</TE>
<TE>   The book gives us 26 writers and a bracing geographical range.
Lily Brett's troubling tenure in New York City yields to Jeffrey
Tayler's atmospheric (but also dismaying) stay in Marrakech, which
yields to Tony Cohan's deft and hilarious account of a tightly wound
gringo's slide into heedlessness during Mexican Independence Day
festivities in San Miguel de Allende.</TE>
<TE>   There are flaws.</TE>
<TE>   Many readers intrigued by this topic will have already digested
the passages from Mayle and Mayes, and perhaps contributions from
Cohan and Paul Theroux (from 1985's "Sunrise With Seamonsters") as
well.</TE>
<TE>   Also, because 18 of the 26 stories are excerpts from previously
published texts, a reader has the sense of joining a conversation in
progress; there are many unexplained references and characters on the
periphery.</TE>
<TE>   Don't count on the most compelling stories coming from the most
famous names.</TE>
<TE>   The contributions from Isabel Allende and Jan Morris, for
instance, are fairly slight. The best finds here are from some of the
least familiar names.</TE>
<TE>   In South America, nature, si; night life, no</TE>
<TE>   Once upon a time, the words "Time Out" on a cover meant you were
going to read about night life, probably in London (where this
guidebook publisher is based) or New York. But the staff has been
diversifying, and this slim first edition on the stark, gorgeous and
mostly empty southern tip of South America is certainly evidence of
that.</TE>
<TE>   The book covers the Chilean and Argentine sides of the region,
including many color photographs and maps and a fair dose of
historical context. Compiled with extensive local input, it
emphasizes natural wonders, from beaches to glaciers, with particular
attention paid to guest estancias, old ranches that have been
converted to lodgings.</TE>
<TE>   The guide has ads, which always annoy me in a book, but it also
contains the pledge that neither they nor any payment has influenced
any review.</TE>
<TE>   The beauty that lurks behind urban blight</TE>
<TE>   Much of the world has heard of Frank Gehry's great silvery
Guggenheim museum in Bilbao and how that building's appeal is helping
transform a formerly forlorn industrial city in northern Spain. A
similar story is unfurling in North Adams, Mass., a formerly forlorn
mill town (and later factory town) in the Berkshires, a few miles
from the Ivy Leaguers of Williams College and Williamstown.</TE>
<TE>   Since the early 1990s, North Adams' idle old mill (and later
factory) has been under transformation. It reopened in 1999 as the
Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (MassMoCa). This book isn't
the story of the mill conversion (MassMoCa has told that story in
another book) but of the property across the street. There, a pair of
entrepreneurs have converted five old workers' row houses into an
unexpected hotel. The Porches Inn opened on River Street in 2001, and
it stands as a symbol of the ripple effect that the leaders of North
Adams are hoping for.</TE>
<TE>   As the images show, North Adams remains an unfinished renewal
project, and this book may or may not lure you there. But it might
remind you, architecturally or otherwise, of the possibilities hiding
behind what looks like blight.</TE>

<HD>Vegas-like mirages in the desert</HD>
<DH>Tribal casinos in the Palm Springs area try hard to
replicate Nevada's real deal.</DH>

<DL>Coachella</DL>
<LD>I peeled a $100 bill out of my wallet and fed it into the dollar slot
machine as my two new friends, Shauna and Jennifer, looked on.</LD>
<LD>   First spin, and the machine gave me $5.</LD>
<LD>   "Wow," said Shauna, who was wearing impossibly low hip-huggers.
"You won!"</LD>
<TE>   "You don't mind us looking over your shoulder, do you?" asked
Jennifer, sheathed in a tiny black miniskirt.</TE>
<TE>   Well no, not at all, actually. At the moment, life is good. The
casino floor is lively, the cocktail waitress has just floated by
taking orders, and I have pleasant company at the slots.</TE>
<TE>   This might have been Las Vegas, but in fact I was at the Trump 29
Casino east of Palm Springs. With its plush appointments and
expansive main floor, it was the closest thing to a real-deal Vegas
casino I would see last month during a tour of Coachella Valley
gaming palaces.</TE>
<TE>   Las Vegas has long been a popular holiday destination for Southern
Californians. But the Palm Springs area offers a decent alternative,
as the casinos on Native American lands have become a far cry from
the converted bingo halls of years past. Besides, the drive is
shorter and great outlet shopping is nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Just keep in mind: Although you can get a good gambling fix, the
experience is no match for the adrenaline rush of Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   My wife, Alison, and I headed out on a Friday afternoon and made
our first stop at the two outdoor outlet malls in Cabazon, off
Interstate 10 about 90 miles east of downtown L.A.</TE>
<TE>   We knew we were in trouble when traffic was backed up on the
freeway -- perhaps not surprising, since this was the Friday after
Thanksgiving. The parking lots at Desert Hills Premium Outlets and
neighboring Cabazon Outlets were jammed.</TE>
<TE>   The shopping would have to wait, but the gambling could begin. We
drove a couple of miles down Seminole Drive to Casino Morongo, which
was jampacked.</TE>
<TE>   While Alison checked out the slots, I circled the blackjack tables
looking for an open seat. The only one I could find was at a table
where the minimum bet was $25 -- too rich for my blood.</TE>
<TE>   In Vegas, the casino would have opened a new table. Not here. The
place was apparently operating at capacity. We played the slots
awhile -- Morongo has 2,000 of them -- but the lack of elbowroom
became tiresome, and we left for our hotel.</TE>
<TE>   We had booked two nights at the Miramonte, a Mediterranean-themed
resort off Highway 111 in Indian Wells. The best rate we could get
from the hotel directly was $269 a night. On a tip, we tried the
booking agency RoomStar (formerly SaveCash Vacations,
www.savecash.com), which negotiates discounted rates for hotels in
Palm Springs, San Diego and Phoenix. It offered the Miramonte for
$169 Friday and $179 Saturday, plus tax and the $15 nightly resort
fee charged to all guests.</TE>
<TE>   There were a few catches: RoomStar charged my credit card
immediately, and if I canceled the reservation within three days of
arrival, I would have been reimbursed for the second night only. Our
room preferences -- nonsmoking, king bed -- weren't guaranteed. But
it's a great way to save money if your plans are firm and you can be
flexible about the room.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel merits and miscues</TE>
<TE>   The Miramonte was laid-back and relaxing. We got the kind of room
we requested, and the staff and concierge were especially helpful.
There are three pools, including one big enough for lap swimming, as
well as nicely landscaped grounds. Our room was satisfactory.</TE>
<TE>   But there were minor annoyances. We arrived more than an hour
after check-in time, yet the room wasn't ready, despite a call ahead
to confirm our arrival. We used the cotton swabs in the bathroom the
first day, and they weren't replaced the second. We had to call the
front desk to get a key for the mini-bar. And when we returned to our
room Saturday night, our keys didn't work.</TE>
<TE>   For dinner, at the concierge's recommendation, we tried Pacifica
of the Desert. The swordfish, shrimp and Chardonnay were excellent,
but the service was spotty.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday we headed to the Trump 29 Casino in Coachella. The former
Spotlight 29 Casino was renamed in April after the Twentynine Palms
Band of Mission Indians signed a development deal with Donald Trump.</TE>
<TE>   The contrast with Casino Morongo was striking. The place has the
look of a Nevada casino. The floor is brightly lighted, and customers
have ample room at the tables. There's even a 2,500-seat theater
showcasing talent such as Bill Cosby, Brian Setzer and Tony Bennett.</TE>
<TE>   I planted myself at a $10 blackjack table. Before I could get
change for my hundred, the pit boss yanked the dealer and installed a
replacement: a white-bearded gentleman who's a dead ringer for Kenny
Rogers, the Gambler himself.</TE>
<TE>   I battled the dealer up and down; a half hour later my $100 stake
was at $80, and I wagered half of it. The dealer slipped me two aces.
I split them, sliding out my remaining $40. No luck. I drew small
cards, and the money was gone.</TE>
<TE>   I headed for a cluster of Bally "Playboy Slots" to chill, and
that's where I ran into Shauna and Jennifer. The demographic here
skews older than Vegas -- besides winning cars at the slots, you can
win golf carts -- and these two stood out. Both were wearing Playboy
T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you real Playmates?" I asked. (Mr. Suave, that's me.)</TE>
<TE>   It turned out they were: Shauna Sand was Miss May 1996, and
Jennifer Walcott was Miss August 2001. They said I could get a signed
T-shirt if I just played the slots, so into the wallet I went. Later
I introduced them to Alison, who was bemused by my heightened
interest in slot machines.</TE>
<TE>   From Trump, we pushed on to Fantasy Springs Casino, one I-10
offramp west in Indio. Although not quite as upscale as the Trump
casino, Fantasy Springs also has the look of a Vegas gambling hall.
And to my surprise, there was a craps table.</TE>
<TE>   California's 1998 Indian gaming initiative legalized slot machines
and card games (such as blackjack and pai gow poker) in which the
house is the bank but not roulette and dice games such as craps.</TE>
<TE>   Unless those games are played with cards.</TE>
<TE>   That's the idea behind Carde Craps at Fantasy Springs: Draw two
cards instead of rolling the dice. I put $20 on 6, but the dealer
drew 7 -- craps. I moved on.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, most players stick to slots and blackjack. But craps
tables and roulette wheels generate much of the energy and excitement
in Vegas. That, and the fact that you can walk outside, into a
blizzard of lights and themed hotels, and take your pick of giant
casinos within walking distance.</TE>
<TE>   In the Coachella Valley, you walk outside to parking lots with
charter buses.</TE>
<TE>   Still, with so many casinos in the area -- including the big new
Agua Caliente Casino in Rancho Mirage, operated by the same tribe
that runs the Spa Casino in downtown Palm Springs -- you definitely
can have some gambling fun. Compared with Nevada, the dealers aren't
as sharp (cards took errant flight more than once) and the options
aren't as plentiful, but the drive is far more pleasant.</TE>
<TE>   And with the short drive, we had time and energy to check out El
Paseo shopping district in Palm Desert and the Shields Date Gardens
in Indio, and enjoy a late-night dinner at LG's Prime Steakhouse in
La Quinta. The rib eye and filet mignon were served perfectly cooked
to order and sizzling hot, accompanied by an Edna Valley Pinot Noir
and sides of sauteed mushrooms, spinach and fried potatoes.</TE>
<TE>   And yes, the next day we had enough stamina to hit those Cabazon
outlets on the way home.</TE>

<KH>Destination: Virginia</KH>
<HD>Museum keeps parade memories afloat</HD>
<DH>After they've done their turn on Colorado Boulevard, some
of the floral spectacles get a new home in the Shenandoah Valley.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James T. Yenckel</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>Shenandoah Caverns, Va</DL>
<LD>For a few brief hours, the Rose Parade floats delight millions around
the world who tune in or turn out to see the floral spectacles. Then
many of those floats are destroyed.</LD>
<LD>   But not all.</LD>
<LD>   In this small town in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley just 100 miles
west of Washington, float builder Earl C. Hargrove Jr. has opened one
of the state's fastest-growing tourist attractions: an airplane
hangar-size showcase for award-winning parade floats, many of them
from the Rose Parade. He calls it American Celebration on Parade, and
this 43,000-square-foot space is a fantastical realm of giant singing
ducks, playful bears, stately eagles and fearsome dragons.</LD>
<TE>   The fragile flowers that once decorated the floats -- Rose Parade
floats must use only natural materials -- are gone. They have been
replaced with traditional float-building materials such as "petal
paper," thin, fluttery strips of paper that are true to the original
colors.</TE>
<TE>   On a visit here last month, I was told that all but three of the
27 floats on display were from Pasadena's annual New Year's Day fest.
(The exhibit may vary because some of the floats are rented out to
other parades.)</TE>
<TE>   Here I found "All Aboard," a showmanship trophy winner at the 1994
Rose Parade that even in semi-retirement still dazzles. This faithful
reproduction of an Old West train is decked out in vivid red, blue
and gold and includes a steam engine that stands two stories tall.
With a coal car and a passenger car, it stretches 100 feet. It takes
three people to operate it. It rolled again in President Clinton's
second inaugural parade in 1997 and in three Philadelphia
Thanksgiving Day parades.</TE>
<TE>   Hargrove, 74, is no stranger to the float business. He and his
father before him have constructed floats for every presidential
inaugural parade since Harry S. Truman's in 1949. For some parades he
builds 30 or more, and he also decorates inaugural ballrooms. His
pride in his profession prompted him to open American Celebration in
July 2000. It features some of his own historic inaugural floats.</TE>
<TE>   "Most parades pass by quickly. This is a chance to linger and
appreciate the talent and imagination that produce these works of
art," he says of the museum, which is next to another popular
attraction he owns, Shenandoah Caverns.</TE>
<TE>   A Rose Parade fan, Hargrove typically buys parts of those floats
to display at American Celebration or to incorporate in his own
works. He gets them from Phoenix Decorating Co. of Pasadena, one of
the largest Rose Parade float builders. A complete float and its
cross-country move can cost as much as $50,000, says Marvin Bond,
director of marketing for Hargrove Inc. of Lanham, Md., Hargrove's
float-building company.</TE>
<TE>   As a parade lover and three-time Rose Parade veteran, I wandered
eagerly among the floats. I felt as though I was witnessing an
ongoing parade -- except that I was moving and the floats were
standing still. I read signs detailing their history.</TE>
<TE>   The elephant had been bedecked in red chrysanthemums for the 2001
Rose Parade. Red petal paper replaced the blooms.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, I activated a family of giant polar bears, trophy award
winners in the 1998 Rose Parade. One husky fellow shook his head, and
two others rolled about on a simulated Alaskan ice floe. Once they
were clothed in white flowers; now white fur adorns them.</TE>
<TE>   Among his own floats, Hargrove is perhaps proudest of a huge
American flag, 63 feet long and 24 feet tall. The flag, perched atop
a farm wagon hidden from view, is made of red, white and blue
hand-stapled puffs of satin using 1 million staples. It was supposed
to appear in President Reagan's second inaugural parade in 1985, but
the procession was canceled because of bitter cold. When a special
ceremony for parade participants moved indoors, the flag went inside
as the backdrop on the stage. It subsequently marched in the
inaugural of the first President Bush in 1989.</TE>

<HD>The 2002 airline scorecard posts lots of losses, lots of
wins</HD>
<DH>Heightened security, bankruptcies caused problems for
fliers, but some fares plunged.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane Engle</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This has been a miserable year for flying on U.S. airlines -- or a
pretty good year, depending on your point of view. Certainly it has
been a year of extremes.</LD>
<LD>   The negatives, of course, have grabbed headlines. Battered by
Americans' fear of flying after Sept. 11, defections of business
fliers and the troubled economy, US Airways and United -- two of the
10 majors -- filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Smaller
carriers Midway, National and Vanguard stopped flying, stranding
thousands.</LD>
<LD>   Tightened security made travel an ordeal, especially early in the
year. We learned to arrive at the airport hours earlier, whip off our
shoes and belts while enduring embarrassing searches, and excise
scissors, knives and a laundry list of other banned items from our
carry-ons.</LD>
<TE>   The second half of the year brought a blizzard of restrictions on
low-fare tickets, higher excess-baggage fees, stingier compensation
for being bumped or delayed and higher prices for paper tickets.</TE>
<TE>   But there were plenty of pluses. Leisure travelers enjoyed low air
fares. Discounters JetBlue and Southwest added routes and flights.
More planes took off on time. Airlines lost less luggage.
Self-service check-in stations mushroomed.</TE>
<TE>   We are arguably safer in the air than we were before Sept. 11,
2001, thanks to more than 44,000 federal security screeners deployed
to all 429 of the nation's commercial airports -- beating a Nov. 19
deadline that critics said they couldn't make.</TE>
<TE>   "For passengers, this was a good year," says Jamie Baker, a J.P.
Morgan airline analyst. "For [airline] shareholders, it was anything
but."</TE>
<TE>   Peter C. Yesawich, president of Yesawich, Pepperdine, Brown &amp;
Russell, a marketing firm based in Orlando, Fla., refines it a bit
more. "If it's convenience you're looking for, it was a challenging
year," he says. "If it was a great fare you were looking for, you
should have found it."</TE>
<TE>   Here's a look at how leisure air travelers fared in key areas:</TE>
<TE>   Fares: "We got ourselves one heck of a deal in 2002," says Tom
Parsons, chief executive of Bestfares.com, a travel Web site. "We're
seeing fares that go back to the 1980s."</TE>
<TE>   A few months ago, Parsons says, $198 round trips were available
between San Diego and London. I recently booked round trips from LAX
to Las Vegas for $38 and to Oakland for $54, about half the lowest
fares during much of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, domestic coach passengers were paying about 20% less for
tickets last month than in November 2000 and 5% less than a year ago,
when prices were depressed by post-Sept. 11 trauma, according to the
Air Transport Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The uncertain economy and pressure from discounters are driving
fares lower, experts say. This year's news includes JetBlue's
dramatic growth from its West Coast hub in Long Beach and Southwest's
new nonstops between LAX and the Baltimore-Washington airport.</TE>
<TE>   Not all fares have fallen. Round trips from the West Coast to
Australia, for example, continue to run $1,000 or more, largely
because there's not much competition there, Parsons says. The average
international fare was up slightly in November from 2001 and about
10% less than in 2000, the ATA reports.</TE>
<TE>   Performance: Although airport security hassles bedeviled us for
much of the year, we had some pleasant surprises once we got on the
planes.</TE>
<TE>   In September, flights run by the 10 largest U.S. airlines took off
on schedule 88% of the time. It was the best score since the U.S.
Department of Transportation began collecting comparable data in
1995. (The average slipped to 84.2% in the most recent DOT report,
for October.)</TE>
<TE>   Also in September, the airlines' rate of mishandled baggage, which
includes lost, damaged and pilfered bags, dropped to 3.04 reports per
1,000 passengers, another low. (The rate was slightly higher, 3.09,
in October.)</TE>
<TE>   Some experts say the airlines performed better only because
traffic fell. The ATA, which represents U.S. carriers, credits
industry-wide customer satisfaction initiatives, begun three years
ago, that promised to improve on-time flights and baggage delivery.</TE>
<TE>   Restrictions and fees: In their hunt for revenue, strapped
airlines transferred a host of costs to customers. Many changes went
unannounced, and travelers got some nasty surprises at the ticket
counter.</TE>
<TE>   Is your bag overweight or too big? That may cost you $25 or $50 or
$80 because the airline either set a new policy or began enforcing an
old one. Got a third bag to check? Hand over $40 to $80, depending on
the carrier.</TE>
<TE>   Airlines added or increased fees up to $25 to issue paper tickets
on routes on which e-tickets were available. They also ended
commissions to travel agents, some of whom responded by charging
customers $50 or more to process tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Several airlines began declaring nonrefundable tickets to be --
well, nonrefundable. To reuse such low-fare tickets, you had to call
the airline in advance or on the same day as your scheduled flight
and rebook. Some have rescinded plans to charge such ticketholders
$100 to fly standby the same day. "We have been listening to our
customers, and we agree with them that their travel experience should
be simpler and easier," says United Senior Vice President Chris
Bowers.</TE>
<TE>   Amen</TE>
<TE>   A look ahead: American recently cut walk-up fares by about 40% in
400 markets and offered just four categories of coach fares: walk-up,
two levels of 14-day advance purchase and a new 30-day advance
purchase. The 30-day is lower than the 14-day fare but 10% to 15%
higher than promotional sale fares, analyst Baker says. The result:
somewhat higher leisure fares and a big break for business travelers.</TE>
<TE>   Expect more such experiments in 2003 as airlines try to find the
elusive formula that extracts more money without alienating
cost-conscious consumers.</TE>

<LD>In the article "To Get Holidays Off the Ground, Prepare for Stormy
Weather" (Travel Insider, Dec. 22), you suggested that the couple
going on a cruise pack a toothbrush in their carry-ons. Why not
suggest that they take only carry-ons for a four-night ship trip?
People can avoid problems and save time by not checking their
luggage. I am amazed how much stuff people take when they travel by
air.</LD>
<LD>   My rule of thumb is, if you can't take it as carry-on, you are
taking too much. This works for most of my trips, including weeklong
cruises and multi-week trips to Europe.</LD>

<LD>Regarding "The Accidental Treasures of Venice" (Dec. 15): When my
husband and I were in Venice for two weeks in May, I visited many
churches, just like the author, Madeline King Porter.</LD>
<LD>   The photo of the Madonna dell'Orto brought back memories. I walked
there to track down a church mentioned in "Miss Garnet's Angel" by
Salley Vickers, a wonderful novel set in contemporary Venice.</LD>
<LD>   I visited at least 21 churches -- some more than once -- and even
then did not see all the ones Porter saw.</LD>
<TE>   My favorite is Santa Maria dei Miracoli, which is small and hard
to find. It is covered with slabs of many shades of marble, inside
and out.</TE>
<TE>   Another favorite was the Gesuiti (not to be confused with the
Gesuati). It is huge and full of green and white marble columns and
walls, and it gave me the feeling of being underwater.</TE>
<TE>   There are so many wonderful works of art. I am ready to return and
experience the rest of the Venetian churches.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Copper Canyon Thrill Ride" (Oct. 27) brought back memories. My
husband and I traveled there in the fall of 1985 with four friends
and our son Ben, who was 5.</LD>
<LD>   We flew from Tijuana to Los Mochis and then took the train to
Creel and stayed three nights at the Sierra Lodge. From there we
hiked to the falls and, the following day, traveled to the mission
school in Creel with supplies for the school and the clinic.</LD>
<LD>   It was a wonderful experience for Ben to give trinkets, crayons,
pencils and paper to the children playing in the schoolyard. He even
gave one boy his Frisbee. And it was unforgettable for the adults to
see how primitive the clinic was and how appreciative the personnel
was for the cases of medicines we brought.</LD>
<TE>   We then traveled to Cerocahui and stayed at the Hotel Mision.</TE>
<TE>   The following day we hired a truck to take us to Urique at the
bottom of the canyon. We piled into the flatbed of the pickup and
headed off for the ride of our lives. Our driver raced into the
canyon like a madman, and we just laughed.</TE>
<TE>   In Urique there were no automobiles, only horses and donkeys. We
sent Ben across the river with our friends in a box suspended on a
cable, and he loved every moment.</TE>
<TE>   There's something about that kind of trip that makes one throw
caution out the window. We probably wouldn't travel on the pickup and
in the box on the cable now, maybe because we're older and wiser.</TE>

<LD>Four Seasons chain dips its toes into cruising</LD>
<LD>   This may be the ultimate soft adventure for affluent baby boomers:
diving and snorkeling excursions in the remote Maldives aboard a
128-foot catamaran run by Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts.</LD>
<LD>   The Four Seasons Island Explorer this week begins regular three-
to seven-day cruises that visit atolls in the Indian Ocean island
republic, about 400 miles southwest of Sri Lanka.</LD>
<TE>   The vessel is based at the luxury chain's Maldives resort at Kuda
Huraa, but you don't have to be a resort guest to take a cruise. The
three-deck vessel has 10 cabins measuring 215 square feet and a
484-square-foot Explorer Suite.</TE>
<TE>   There are two sun decks with Jacuzzi, a restaurant, bar, lounge
and library. Each air-conditioned cabin has its own phone, DVD and
music system and bathroom with tub-shower. Rates, which vary by
season, begin at $340 per person per night, double occupancy, for
cabins and $700 for the suite. They include all meals and excursions
but not alcoholic beverages. 011-960-444-888,

<TE>   Fees at state parks will go up this week</TE>
<TE>   Fees at California state parks will increase Wednesday. Among
them: Regular day-use fees will range up to $5 instead of $3; annual
day-use passes will increase to $67 from $35. Basic camping fees will
be $13 instead of $12. Boat launching, formerly free, will cost up to
$4; annual boat-launch passes will be $45.</TE>
<TE>   The park service noted that fees will still be lower than in
2000-2001, when many were reduced or eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak offers fares for bid on Internet</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak has begun offering fares for auction on EBay. You must
purchase with a credit card, and there is a $4.95 handling fee. Not
all routes are up for bid. Recent ones included Chicago-to-Los
Angeles round trips on the Southwest Chief. The top of 20 bids when
checked was $81, compared with regular fares starting at $330.
(Sleepers are extra.) Log onto www.stores.ebay.com/amtrakauctions.</TE>
<TE>   Traveler's notes</TE>
<TE>   US Airways, which had announced plans to charge holders of
nonrefundable tickets $100 to stand by for flights for the same day,
said it would offer them the option of obtaining confirmed seats for
the same fee. The change takes effect Wednesday.... New York City is
extending its smoking ban, which now applies to restaurants with more
than 35 seats, to all restaurants and bars. The ban is expected to
take effect by late March.</TE>

<HD>In Lewis and Clark's footsteps</HD>
<DH>The 200th anniversary of the explorers' odyssey will be
marked for several years.</DH>

<LD>The bicentennial of the epic Lewis and Clark expedition, which mapped
the U.S. west of the Mississippi, kicks off next month at the
Virginia home of the man who ordered it, President Thomas Jefferson.
The next four years will bring events across the country. They will
mark the 1804-06 journey of the 48-member Corps of Discovery, led by
Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, which traveled from Missouri to
Oregon and back.</LD>
<LD>   The team failed in its main mission: to scour the country's vast
new Louisiana Purchase for the Northwest Passage, a water connection
that Jefferson and others erroneously believed linked the Atlantic
and Pacific oceans. But the trip was a watershed, bringing back news
of the West's Native American cultures and natural environment, and
opening the region for European settlement.</LD>
<LD>   For the bicentennial, the entrance hall of Jefferson's Monticello
estate, near Charlottesville, Va., is being refashioned as Indian
Hall, where the president displayed Indian crafts, plants and animal
specimens collected by Lewis and Clark.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the original objects have been lost, except for antlers
from North Dakota, said Wayne Mogielnicki, a Monticello spokesman.
Based on inventories from the time, members of the Lakota,
Mandan-Hidatsa, Cherokee and other Native American peoples have
reproduced items using original methods.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit, "Framing the West at Monticello," will run Jan. 16
through Dec. 31, 2003. Tours of the property next year will focus on
the expedition.</TE>
<TE>   The house is open daily; hours vary. Entrance fees: $13 for
adults, $6 ages 6 to 11. (434) 984-9822, www.monticello.org.</TE>
<TE>   Other openings and events include:</TE>
<TE>   December: A $7-million Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center opened
this month in Hartford, Ill., 15 miles north of East St. Louis. The
center, one of several in the U.S. devoted to the expedition, is
across the Mississippi from the mouth of the Missouri River, near
where the trip began. It includes a 55-foot replica of the explorers'
keelboat. In May 2004, reenactors will depart from a replica of Lewis
and Clark's fortress here.</TE>
<TE>   Oct. 14 to 26: A commemoration of Lewis' arrival in Louisville,
Ky., and his meeting with Clark will include performances, exhibits,
Native American and African American programs and an expanded version
of the annual Falls of the Ohio Lewis and Clark River Festival.</TE>
<TE>   January 2004: An exhibit of more than 500 Lewis and Clark
artifacts will open at the Missouri Historical Society in St. Louis
and will later travel to several cities.</TE>
<TE>   An events schedule through 2006 can be found at
www.lewisandclark200.org. The site is maintained by the National
Council of the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial, which moved its
headquarters from Portland, Ore., to St. Louis during the summer. Its
phone, (888) 999-1803, is shared with the Missouri Historical
Society.</TE>

<HD>A hotel's life</HD>
<DH>Returning over the years to a favorite little Parisian inn
on the Left Bank: Its story tells it all.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Dannenberg</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Of course it's true that you can't go home again. But there are times
when you can't even go on vacation again.</LD>
<LD>   I had a pretty good idea what to expect when I checked into the
Libertel Hotel Bellechasse in Paris' trendy 7th arrondissement, just
around the corner from the Musee d'Orsay and midway between Boulevard
St. Germain and the Seine. It was one of many Left Bank boutique
hotels, with an elegant lobby and sitting room fronting the narrow
Rue de Bellechasse.</LD>
<LD>   The clerk, an attractive young woman in a salmon-hued business
suit, found my reservation on the computer terminal concealed in her
faux antique desk and asked, "You have stayed with us before?"</LD>
<TE>   "Yes and no," I replied. Appearances notwithstanding, this place
was more than just a hotel to me, and I'd brought a lot more baggage
than my carry-on.</TE>
<TE>   My mind raced back to the first time I walked into the Bellechasse
in 1971, before this kid standing before me was even born. It was the
same old building, maybe 40 feet wide and four stories tall, but it
was not the same hotel, not by any stretch of the imagination.</TE>
<TE>   My friend Dan, an old Paris hand, had recommended the place, and
my wife, Cathy, and I were happy to find a one-star hotel in such a
prime Left Bank location. It wasn't as prime as it is today, of
course, for the Musee d'Orsay hadn't been built; it was still the
bustling Gare d'Orsay railroad station. The room set us back about
$10 a day -- not the cheapest room in town back then but affordable
for a couple of weeks.</TE>
<TE>   There was nothing special about the tiny room, which had a
swaybacked double bed and a sink. Bath and other facilities, such as
they were, were down the hall (with brown folded sheets of toilet
paper the consistency of paper bags). The halls were narrow and dark.
The lobby, guarded by the fattest cocker spaniel I had ever seen,
was, to be charitable, simple, with a few breakfast tables near the
entrance, a reception desk at the opposite wall, and a creaky spiral
staircase to the left. Amenities were scarce; the decor was tattered
and shabby.</TE>
<TE>   But we were young.</TE>
<TE>   It seemed a fairly typical tourist place, and that's what it may
have been for some guests. That wasn't our experience.</TE>
<TE>   The desk clerk, Michel, was a Jew raised in Oran, Algeria. He had
studied at Berkeley, so he was fluent in English, and we had lots to
talk about. Michel's family managed the hotel, and he was helping out
for the summer along with his cousin Daisy. He was quite an operator,
having, so he said, fought in Algeria as a teenager and been a
swimmer on the 1960 French Olympic swimming team.</TE>
<TE>   Le Colonel</TE>
<TE>   There were many interesting characters at the Bellechasse. There
was Clement, the night clerk, a little guy with red cheeks, a red
nose and a beret cocked on his bald head. He didn't speak any
English, but he was garrulous and friendly, especially after sneaking
around the corner for a cognac. There were the animated Spanish
maids.</TE>
<TE>   But most memorable was Le Colonel. We never knew his name, and it
never dawned on us to ask. A pensioner living at the Bellechasse, he
was a gaunt, small man in his 70s who shuffled around the lobby for
hours at a time, always dressed in the same shabby dark suit and
vest, always covered with ashes from a yellow Gitane cigarette.</TE>
<TE>   He was retired from the French army, having begun his service as a
teenager in World War I. Although a bit worn around the edges and
slowed by age, he had a haughty and detached demeanor and still
looked like a man used to being saluted.</TE>
<TE>   Because of our poor French and his poor English, I never got much
information on his military career, except for his oft-repeated tale
that he learned his English while working as an orderly for Gen.
Pershing in 1917. Critical as he might have been of Americans in the
abstract, he took us under his wing, chatting us up whenever we
crossed paths in the lobby.</TE>
<TE>   Because it was August, a time when, back then, much of Paris was
closed down, he took it upon himself to escort us around the
neighborhood to point out the best choices among the few open
bakeries, butchers and wine and cheese shops. The Colonel gave the
latter special attention, trying as best he could to pass on what
seemed arcane knowledge about goat, sheep and donkey cheese. It was
as animated as he got, his reedy voice rising as he gestured tightly
toward the bewildering displays. We didn't have a clue what he was
trying to tell us, except when he brayed like a donkey, but the
cheeses were all great.</TE>
<TE>   Michel and his relatives adopted us during our two-week stay,
taking us to places we would never have seen as tourists. Some were
exotic. Some not.</TE>
<TE>   One evening Michel announced that we had to experience couscous
for dinner. He drove us to a neighborhood that seemed to me what the
casbah in Algiers might look like, with young Arab men hanging out on
streets dominated by shops and restaurants with Arabic lettering. It
seemed a little disconcerting, even threatening. We pulled up in
front of a cafe, and Michel hopped out and shook hands with the
owner, beckoning us to follow him inside.</TE>
<TE>   I asked him if he was uncomfortable eating at an Arab restaurant.
"But, Jeem, zeez are not 'Arabians,' " he said. "Zay are Jews."
Gesturing dismissively at the "real" Arabs down the street, and ever
conscious of the divide between Arab and Sephardic Jew in Paris, he
added, "Jewish couscous eez better."</TE>
<TE>   As an assimilated American Jew, I knew little of the culture of
the Jews dispersed throughout the Arab world when the Spanish
expelled them in 1492. And it was a shock to me that I couldn't
distinguish them from their Arab neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Another day Michel took us to the opposite end of the Paris social
spectrum, when we went to meet his older brother at a posh country
club outside the city. This was a Jewish club, not unlike those that
sprang up outside most American cities in the 1950s, when newly
successful Jewish businessmen and professionals, excluded from the
old-line Gentile establishments, founded their own retreats. We might
have been in Milwaukee, except for the language and the food.</TE>
<TE>   Our vacation passed quickly. We spent lots of time with Michel,
heard more about Daisy's love life than we wanted, and generally felt
like insiders at the Bellechasse. We were even invited to watch the
little black-and-white TV in the staff room off the lobby. On the day
we left I went to the desk to settle the bill and got a surprise.</TE>
<TE>   "Zehr ees no bill," Michel said. I protested, but he would hear
none of it. We were his guests. That was that.</TE>
<TE>   The next year we returned to France, visiting Michel in Paris and
at his family's apartment in Cannes, but after a few years we lost
touch with each other, as sometimes happens.</TE>
<TE>   The renovation</TE>
<TE>   In the fall of 1978 I passed briefly through Paris. My plan was to
stop for a night at the Bellechasse, but when I pulled up in front I
was shocked to see the hotel gone and the building a gutted shell. A
sign on the front indicated a major renovation. Where had Michel
gone? Daisy? Clement? The Colonel?</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until a few years later that my friend Dan sent me a
brochure from the "new," two-star Hotel Bellechasse that had risen
from the rubble. By that time I had lost all contact with Michel, but
I kept the brochure.</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, Cathy and I returned to Paris and decided to give the
Bellechasse another try. A little older and less spontaneous, we made
a reservation through a travel agent, noting that the hotel had gone
upscale in its room rates, which hovered around $80.</TE>
<TE>   Some things were the same, however. Most of the old shops were
still there. Though the hotel facade hadn't changed much, the
remodeling inside was extensive. The reception desk was now off to
the left, and the breakfast area, with its own TV, had been moved to
the back. The stairs were in the same place, but we marveled at the
new addition to the lobby: a tiny elevator.</TE>
<TE>   The clerk was a young guy who spoke English well, as did most of
the clerical staff. The maids were now all Africans and generally
aloof. Or maybe it was us.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, we asked the clerk about Michel and his family, the
Colonel and the old crowd, but he knew nothing of them and didn't
expect anyone else did. So much for institutional memory.</TE>
<TE>   Our room was an improvement over the original, especially because
it had a private bathroom and a TV. But the French mattress and
toilet-paper technology still hadn't caught up with ours. Despite its
face-lift, it still felt a little like the old place, and we were
comfortable there, half expecting to pass the Colonel in its
claustrophobic hallways. Our visit was relatively uneventful, but not
completely.</TE>
<TE>   One morning we decided it might be fun to take the Metro to the
Marais district on the Right Bank -- the old Jewish Quarter -- to
have lunch at a well-known deli on the Rue des Rosiers called Jo
Goldenberg. Come lunchtime, however, the temperature rose and we
decided to pick up food and eat at the hotel, as we often did. The TV
was on as we spread our lunch on one of the breakfast tables.</TE>
<TE>   We watched a news bulletin announcing a catastrophe, with film of
police cars and a cordoned-off crime scene. Gradually we realized
that it was at Jo Goldenberg. Arab terrorists had assaulted the
restaurant at lunchtime, tossing grenades and spraying the crowd of
locals and tourists with machine-gun fire. Six were killed, 22
wounded.</TE>
<TE>   We visited the Bellechasse again in 1990, a stay that was
memorable only because Saddam Hussein chose to invade Kuwait at the
same time. The neighborhood had changed a little: The opening of the
Musee d'Orsay in 1986 had brought more tourists than commuters to the
area. Try as I might, I could never learn anything more about Michel.
Nor did the hotel offer any additional glimpses of intimacy or
familiarity.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime in the late 1990s I recommended the place to friends.
They had booked another hotel but checked out the neighborhood while
visiting the museum. They found the building in ruins, to be
remodeled once more, its third incarnation in a quarter-century.</TE>
<TE>   Since my first stay at the Bellechasse in 1971, I have been to
France at least 20 times and stayed at many Parisian hotels. My early
Bellechasse memories have receded. I have found new interests, new
friends and even relatives in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Then someone sent me a brochure advertising the again-new
Bellechasse, now a three-star property of a French hotel chain. Since
I was to be in Paris in September 2001, I thought I'd give it a look.
I booked only my last night there, because it charged about $160 for
a single. There is a limit to what I will pay for a sentimental
journey.</TE>
<TE>   One last visit</TE>
<TE>   Little did I know that just a week before I arrived a handful of
terrorists would strike America, dragging us into a far more
treacherous world, one we thought an ocean away. Sure, I could have
canceled and hunkered down near home. Many did. Life in America had
changed in an instant.</TE>
<TE>   But staying home wasn't going to ameliorate any sense of loss I
might have felt. Besides, one reason for my trip had been to plumb
the depths of a lifetime of Paris travel experiences, so it seemed
that I might as well see whether the sense of loss that was so
palpable in the States would somehow survive the flight over the
ocean.</TE>
<TE>   It happened that the taxi driver who took me to my hotel was an
Arab. That is unremarkable in Paris, but I found myself
uncharacteristically on edge, a little suspicious. He was friendly
enough, though, and I felt a little ashamed worrying about this nice
guy who was just making a living.</TE>
<TE>   Most American guests were no-shows, and images of the smashed twin
towers adorned all the magazine covers in the lobby, but it didn't
seem that Paris had changed all that much.</TE>
<TE>   Months later some Americans would see things differently,
considering boycotting France because of attacks on Jews and Jewish
institutions and the perceived indifference of French officials. But
France has always been home to currents of anti-Semitism, sometimes
violent. Our narrow escape in 1982 confirmed this for me. Perhaps the
trauma of Sept. 11 sensitized Americans to what they could previously
ignore in safety.</TE>
<TE>   On my final night in Paris I checked into the Bellechasse. The
hotel facade was still simple but more elegant than before. The glass
entryway seemed more imposing, with automatic sliding doors (which
annoyingly opened without warning every time one ventured within 10
feet or so).</TE>
<TE>   The lobby was the same size, of course, with plush couches and
easy chairs and sculptures, but now there was a wide staircase
leading down to a well-appointed dining room and garden. Not a cocker
spaniel in sight.</TE>
<TE>   The uniformed desk clerk was quite a change from the old days too.
I mentioned this to her, but when I discerned the politely bored
expression of a young person enduring a geezer moment, I headed for
my room. The elevator was new and could hold as many as three or four
people. My compact single room had a firm mattress, a nice bathroom
and windows overlooking a manicured garden. CNN was always available
on the TV. There was a chocolate on my pillow. But as I walked the
halls, expensively papered but still dark and narrow, I half-expected
to bump into the Colonel.</TE>
<TE>   It was, in any event, a brief and uneventful visit, meant only to
satisfy my curiosity. No adventures. No stories. No contact. Maybe
there is something about affluence that retards the kind of personal
travel experience that resonates within me. The more upscale the
Bellechasse became, the less interesting it was.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe it was me. I had come to revisit my memories but realized
that they resided inside me, not in a hotel, which was, after all,
only a building.</TE>
<TE>   Early the next morning I got up to catch a cab to the airport. The
night clerk, wearing the male version of the hotel uniform, was tired
and clearly eager to go home. After figuring out that the $600
telephone bill in his hand wasn't mine, he handed me a computer
printout of my bill. I offered him my credit card.</TE>
<TE>   This time he let me pay.</TE>

France on business as a clothing designer for skateboarder-apparel
maker Matix, was pleasantly surprised by the port town. As he snapped
pictures of the hotel's shimmering pool, this joie de vivre scampered
into frame. "What a fun age in life," Gomez writes. "Not a care in
the world."</CP>

<HD>Longing for spots that are no longer found on the map</HD>
<DH>There's a compelling romance to places that don't exist
anymore -- or that were really just cartographers' mistakes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Spano</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You expect places to stay put. Once they're on maps, they should
remain there. But cartographers know hundreds of places that don't
exist anymore, from the tiny Krakatoan islets of Indonesia, all but
wiped out in a volcanic eruption in 1883, to the vast U.S.S.R., which
made anachronisms of atlases when it disbanded more than a decade
ago.</LD>
<LD>   "To a surprising extent, most places are incredibly persistent,"
says Allen Carroll, chief cartographer for the National Geographic
Society in Washington, D.C. "But the world is very dynamic."</LD>
<LD>   I would like to visit Prussia, for example, which has a long
history but no longer exists on modern maps. Similarly, I want to see
the majestic spires of Glen Canyon on the Colorado River in Utah,
which were obliterated after the construction of Glen Canyon Dam;
Tibet before the Chinese takeover; and scads of places in Eastern
Europe I've read about but can't find on maps: Pomerania, Volhynia,
Bukovina, Courland, Bessarabia, all of which sound to my ear like the
homelands of nutty dukes and counts in Marx Brothers movies. The more
gone Bessarabia is, the more I want to see it.</LD>
<TE>   That's the romance of places off the map.</TE>
<TE>   To console myself and better understand why places aren't as
permanent as I think they ought to be, I turned to geographers, who
cite a variety of reasons that towns, countries, regions and
geographical features disappear from maps, even though they may
remain in history books and memory.</TE>
<TE>   Natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods and volcanic
eruptions have swept away such places as the Krakatoan islands and
half of Santorini, now a crescent in the Aegean Sea edging the
caldera of the volcano that formed the Greek island.</TE>
<TE>   Norman Thrower, a professor emeritus of geography at UCLA, adds to
the list the slowly encroaching ocean, which has engulfed coastal
hamlets in southeastern England. When the tide goes in or out, you
can still hear their old church bells ring, he says. Global warming,
which is thought to be raising ocean levels, imperils low-lying
islands and littorals from the North Atlantic to the South Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   Places appear and disappear when hydroelectric facilities are
built, damming rivers and creating lakes where there were once
valleys. This explains in part why such projects are increasingly
controversial among environmentalists. Some at the radical end of the
spectrum would like to see Utah's Glen Canyon Dam blown up,
unleashing the once wild Colorado River and draining 186-mile-long
Lake Powell.</TE>
<TE>   Others rue the ongoing construction of the Three Gorges Dam in
China. Expected to generate huge amounts of electricity and control
flooding on the Yangtze River, it will also displace, destroy or
diminish countless cities, towns, areas of natural beauty and history
by the time it's completed in 2009.</TE>
<TE>   Author James Dickey turned the romance of lost places into high
adventure with his novel "Deliverance." In 1972 the book was made
into an unforgettable movie, filmed on the Chattooga River between
Georgia and South Carolina. In it, four weekend canoeists set off to
run a river just before it's dammed.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole valley will be under water. But right now it's
wild.... We really ought to go," says one of the characters in the
novel, underscoring that wilderness and rapids are also obliterated
by dams.</TE>
<TE>   Through the years, cartographers have made mistakes, showing
places on maps that never existed. Such is the case with Friesland,
purportedly an island southwest of Iceland that persisted on charts
from 1558 to the 1660s, when cartographers decided it was mythic and
consigned it to the scrap box.</TE>
<TE>   Politics and war above all change maps. East Germany and South
Yemen surrendered their sovereignty in 1990; Tibet became a part of
China by force in 1951. Bessarabia, bounded by the Dniester and Prut
rivers in southeastern Europe, was part of the Roman Empire, Turkey,
Russia and Romania before it changed hands again after the fall of
the Soviet Union. To find where it was, you have to go to Moldavia
and Ukraine.</TE>
<TE>   There are 192 countries in the world, according to the National
Geographic Society. Its count currently agrees with that of the U.S.
State Department, though this isn't always so. "Different
organizations have different criteria for defining independent
countries," says David Miller, senior editor for National Geographic
maps. "For us, an independent country needs to declare independence,
control territory, demonstrate political stability and have
international recognition."</TE>
<TE>   So goodbye, Bessarabia.</TE>
<TE>   I know it's still there because I think, dream and read about it.
Call me romantic. I don't care. I'm even holding out hope for
Shangri-La, that lost lovely valley beyond the Karakoram Mountains
where, in James Hilton's 1933 novel, "Lost Horizon," people live on
and on.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't long life that compels me. It's the idea that, while
countries and cartographers come and go, there could be amazing
places in the world that aren't on maps because we don't know they're
there.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The National Maritime Museum, Park Row, Greenwich, London,
England, 011-44-20-8312-6565, www.nmm.ac.uk, is a good place to see
old, now- erroneous globes.</TE>
<TE>   "No Longer on the Map," by Raymond H. Ramsay (Viking Press, 1972),
tells the fascinating stories of places that once appeared on maps
but never existed.</TE>

<LD>   Maintaining wild places on a low-cost vacation for volunteers</LD>
<LD>   Resolve to spend more time in the wild, wide open spaces next year
by taking a trip with Wilderness Volunteers, an organization that
offers low-cost working vacations at some of America's most beautiful
national parks and recreation areas.</LD>
<TE>   You can collect seeds and cut down invasive plants at Arches
National Park in Utah, remove barbed wire fences at Hart Mountain
National Antelope Refuge in Oregon or study the various species
roaming through Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee and
North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, volunteers donated 15,000 hours during weeklong
vacations across the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a range of participants: lawyers, Kmart workers, doctors,
high-tech people who spend too much time in front of a computer,"
said group spokeswoman Susan Laarman. "There's a wide age range too,
from young people to retirees."</TE>
<TE>   The 40 trips planned next year include such sites as Glacier
National Park in Montana, San Juan Islands National Historic Park in
Washington, Big Bend National Park in Texas, Mt. Hood National Forest
in Oregon and Picture Rocks National Lakeshore in Michigan. Groups
are limited to 12; some sites in Alaska and Hawaii are already full,
Laarman said.</TE>
<TE>   Cost: $198 per person, including meals and lodging. Volunteers
sometimes stay in lodges but often camp. Participants must be
physically fit.</TE>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you plan to ride the rails in Europe in the next few months, you
can save on the price of a youth rail pass if you buy it by Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Eurail, which offers special passes for travelers younger than 26
on their first day of travel, will increase prices by 3% to 5% on
Wednesday. Buy a pass now at 2002 rates and you'll have six months
from the date of purchase to begin using it.</LD>
<LD>   Eurail Youth passes are popular because they allow flexibility on
routes and plans. The passes are valid for unlimited second-class
travel throughout 17 European countries.</LD>
<TE>   Not all European trains have second-class service, so before you
board, check that there's a second class, especially on high-speed
trains. If you travel on a train that doesn't have second class,
you'll pay a penalty.</TE>
<TE>   At 2002 rates, a 15-day pass costs $401; 21 days, $518; one month,
$644; two months, $910; and three months, $1,126. An alternative is
the Eurailpass Youth Flexi Pass, which is valid for any 10 days of
travel within two months for $473, or any 15 days within two months
for $622. Eurail Passes are also honored for a reduced fare and
sometimes free travel on some shipping lines. For details, check the
bonus section on the Rail Europe Internet site at www.raileurope.com.</TE>

<TE>   Missing Link Tours, a Las Vegas company that offers backpackers
tours of the Grand Canyon and Las Vegas in 15-passenger minivans, has
started a 12-hour Los Angeles-to-San Francisco transportation service
that includes stops to enjoy coastal scenery. The fare is $69. Vans
travel north on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and south on Wednesdays and
Fridays. They take Highway 1 and stop in Santa Barbara and in Montana
de Oro State Park, just south of Cambria, to view elephant seals.
They then cut inland to travel up U.S. 101 to San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   An express shuttle, which makes the journey in seven hours with
only one stop, goes north on Interstate 5 on Saturdays and south on
Sundays. It costs $49. Departures are from Venice Beach, Santa
Monica, Hollywood and Union Station.</TE>
<TE>   For details, contact Missing Link, 9604 Pacific View Drive, Las
Vegas, NV 89117; (800) 209-8586, www.tmltours.com.</TE>

<TE>   Federation packages include accommodations in hostels (with six to
10 beds per room) in the Cite des Sciences, D'Artagnan and Leo
Lagrange (Clichy) youth hostels; breakfasts; a travel pass that can
be used on the subway, buses and regional trains; a card for free
admission to the Louvre, Musee d'Orsay and other monuments and
museums for three days; and a Seine River cruise.</TE>
<TE>   Two nights' lodging with a three-day transportation pass costs
$121; three nights and a three-day pass, $142; four nights and a
five-day pass, $173.</TE>
<TE>   You must reserve the package at least two weeks ahead. Contact the
national office of the Federation Unie des Auberges de Jeunesse, 9
Rue de Brantome, 75003 Paris; www.fuaj.org.</TE>
<TE>   The federation recently introduced a ski bus that travels once a

French Alpine towns of Autrans, Tignes, Seez, Les Deux Alpes and
Serre Chevalier. The price from Paris to the resorts is $91. It also
has ski and snowboard packages in Annecy, Aix les Bains and Chamonix,

<HD>Good News on Arco Front</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It was good news indeed earlier this month when oil giant Arco agreed
to spend millions of dollars to clean up contamination beneath 143
gas stations in Orange County, a move that ends a costly and
time-consuming legal battle.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement that ended a legal battle initiated by the district
attorney involves underground plumes of MTBE, a gasoline additive
that may cause cancer. Though MTBE has yet to seriously imperil the
county's water supply, scientists caution that it's only a matter of
time. Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas should be applauded for pushing
Arco to agree to a proactive solution. The negotiated solution also
sets a standard by which other oil companies operating in the county
should be judged.</LD>
<LD>   On one level, the agreement marks a sad but necessary chapter in
this country's push to remedy environmental insults that threaten the
health of its residents. MTBE ironically has been added to gasoline
to make it burn cleaner and reduce air pollution. But when the
chemical leaks from underground gasoline storage tanks, it quickly
spreads through soil and water, creating a cancer threat to animals
and, most likely, humans. California is in the process of phasing out
the dangerous chemical.</LD>
<TE>   But that plan to stop using MTBE doesn't deal with the existing
problem created as the additive silently leaked from underground
storage tanks. Arco, which already has spent $16 million to clean up
gas stations in the county, has a clear legal obligation under state
and federal law to clean up underground pollution. So do Shell Oil
and other oil companies that sell gasoline in the county -- and the
county is right to pursue those companies with lawsuits akin to the
one lodged against Arco.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the settlement contend that Arco simply agreed to do
what's required by federal and state environmental law. That
assessment might be valid. But this country traditionally has waited
too long to treat environmental insults.</TE>
<TE>   Subsequent legal wrangling can delay cleanup efforts for years and
create a funding shortage -- witness the lengthy list of
environmental disasters on the federal government's Superfund list.</TE>
<TE>   Arco has agreed to spend $3 million to study the level of
contamination at its gas stations and allow an independent
environmental consultant to determine the exact amount of pollution
and the level of treatment needed to clean it up. Given the
real-world problems of finding funds to clean up the environment, the
settlement is better than waiting until the damage has been done and
then arguing over who will fund the cleanup.</TE>

<LD>Suddenly, the Board of Supervisors is worried about the will of the
people. A judge has warned the supervisors that a March ballot
measure to adopt an Orange County charter might be unconstitutional.
But the board is going ahead with plans to spend at least $200,000
preparing for a Jan. 28 election that might never happen.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously, the voters want it to happen," outgoing Supervisor
Cynthia P. Coad said of the election, "so we don't really have a
choice."</LD>
<LD>   Funny. The supervisors sure thought they had a choice when Orange
County voters passed Measure H, the health-care initiative, and
Measure F, an initiative to stop the El Toro airport. In both those
cases, the board sued to overturn the public will.</LD>
<TE>   The board feels differently about Measure V, which changed Orange
County from a municipality that follows the state's general law to
one with its own set of operating guidelines. The strange charter
that came before voters said, in essence, that Orange County will
follow the state's general law in all aspects but one. The sole
deviation: When a supervisor's job opens midterm, the voters rather
than the governor will choose a replacement.</TE>
<TE>   Former Supervisor Todd Spitzer, a Republican, admits he pushed for
the measure to keep Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, from filling the
seat being vacated by Spitzer, who has moved on to the state
Assembly. But that had nothing to do with Davis' party, Spitzer said.
It's just good government.</TE>
<TE>   How strange that no one worried about good government in 1987,
when a position opened on the board. The reason: Then-Gov. George
Deukmejian was a Republican, and so was his appointee, Gaddi Vasquez.</TE>
<TE>   Empowering voters to hold a special election to choose their own
local representatives is a fine idea, except perhaps for the cost,
which critics contend was never revealed to voters. But charters are
serious business, a sort of mini-constitution for counties. These
government-defining documents should result from careful
consideration, lively public debate and judicious refinement. None of
that happened with Measure V.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Andrew P. Banks' concerns about the charter
extend beyond the election cost and the lack of finesse that went
into its design. Voters passed the measure believing that future
charter changes could be made only by them, the judge said, because a
county attorney made that assurance in the supposedly impartial
ballot analysis of the measure.</TE>
<TE>   In truth, because the charter picks up state law in almost every
regard, the Legislature can change that law -- and thus the charter
-- at any point.</TE>
<TE>   Measure V needs a serious examination. The county should have done
that before the March vote. Instead, the court will do it Jan. 21 --
a week before the scheduled election of a new supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors should have asked the judge to delay the election but
decided instead to go ahead. That decision helps no one. Postponing
the election wouldn't have allowed Davis to appoint a Spitzer
replacement. It would have frozen the process until the matter is
resolved -- the prudent move.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the county will spend $200,000 and the five candidates
will launch expensive, time-consuming campaigns to attract voters to
what could prove a phantom election.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Festival of the Arts and its offbeat hit show, the Pageant of the
Masters, have staged a post-curtain encore by signing a lease to stay
in Laguna Beach for at least 40 years. That outcome should have been
obvious from the start, but it took a dramatic sideshow and an
eleventh-hour rescue effort to keep the pageant from moving after 70
years in the same town.</LD>
<LD>   Almost everyone is entitled to share the blame for the nasty
mini-fiasco that engulfed the festival for a year. The city was a
recalcitrant negotiator on the festival's new lease, reluctant to
make needed improvements to the aging site. The festival board, led
by a Mission Viejo mayor, had its own grandiose agenda to take its
show on the road, at least down to San Clemente. Such a move would
have erased the quirky community charm of the pageant, in which
people pose as works of art, complete with live orchestral
accompaniment.</LD>
<LD>   San Clemente could have been a better civic neighbor in the
dispute. Instead of waiting for the city and festival to sort out
their differences -- or call it quits -- the larger southern neighbor
played the spoiler, insinuating itself into ongoing negotiations with
offers of a gigantic year-round site and an upscale restaurant.</LD>
<TE>   It was more than a matter of civic pride. The pageant, which sells
out its eight-week run each summer, brings in tourists who spend
millions of dollars on shopping, food and hotels.</TE>
<TE>   Strangest of all was an early ruling by an Orange County Superior
Court judge, whose interpretation of the festival's incorporation
papers defied common sense. Those papers state that the annual summer
event must take place "in or about the city of Laguna Beach." The
judge used a broad -- even sprawling -- definition of "community" to
decide that San Clemente was "in or about" Laguna Beach. Even he
admitted that when those words were written, they were meant to keep
the event within the city's sphere, which included unincorporated
areas in Laguna Canyon and South Laguna.</TE>
<TE>   The festival is such a Laguna fixture that its own foundation
voted to stay in the city, no matter where the artists ended up
going, and keep the festival's $2.7 million in holdings there as
well.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach residents were only slightly less vehement about the
festival than they were about wanting to kill the El Toro airport
plan. And like the airport, the festival's impending move south came
to such a sudden stop, with one election, that it felt like an
anticlimax.</TE>
<TE>   The festival members voted to recall most of the board. The
pageant stayed. And now, with the lease signed, it will stay at least
a few decades more. Too bad they can't write the history of
mismanaged rent negotiations into the lease. It could save everyone a
lot of trouble in 40 years.</TE>

<LD>Re "Zoning Change OKd; 446 Trees to Be Lost to Homes," Dec. 19:</LD>
<LD>   When the planning commissioners approved the destruction of almost
500 mature oak and sycamore trees in Trabuco Canyon for the
SaddleCreek/SaddleCrest development, during the meeting, testimony
became so heated at one point commission Chairman Chuck McBurney
threatened to cut off one of the speakers ... namely myself. At the
point that happened, I had merely mentioned our "notorious planning
department," which caused the august chairman to reach for his gavel
and state flatly that he did not want to hear any more negative
things said against that body.</LD>
<LD>   Forgive me, but I was under the impression that in a public
meeting one was entitled to state an opinion, without having to get
agreement from an "official" that what was about to be said was what
the person wanted to hear!</LD>
<TE>   It has been widely reported that the Planning Department is in
significant disarray. Wouldn't you know, the very day that I and
others were being chastised by the commissioners for questioning if
there might be a conflict of interest for the Planning Department in
approving SaddleCreek and SaddleCrest, the head of that group was
busy resigning because he had received a nice retirement package. Of
course, in the weeks leading up to that, there was much mention of
missing millions, poor planning, lawsuits, frivolous spending and so
on. I can see our taxpayer dollars are hard at work!</TE>
<TE>   I imagine it goes something like this: Have the Planning
Department spend several years in cozy back-room dealings with
developers (check, done that), spend millions on new computer system
and buy fleet of SUVs (yes sir), rubber-stamp approval by planning
commission and attempt to stifle public dissent (yep), rubber-stamp
approval by O.C. Board of Supervisors (coming), inevitable lawsuit
(for sure), ruling by reactionary judge, bring in the bulldozers. At
least local government stays fully employed. So maybe, instead of
chopping down oak trees in what's left of our pristine areas, we
should be rooting out dead and diseased wood in whatever branch of
government it lurks. Personally, I suspect dry rot in the Orange
County Hall of Administration. And by the way, anyone know where we
might find 500 or so tree-sitters?</TE>
<TE>   John Sefton</TE>
<TE>   Trabuco Canyon</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Here in Newport Beach, we go crazy when the city cuts down 20
ficus trees, imports that have nothing to do with the natural ecology
of Balboa Peninsula. But where is the arbor committee when it comes
to defending from the developer's saw hundreds of mature oak and
sycamore trees at Santiago Canyon and Live Oak Canyon (nearby in the
Santa Ana Mountain foothills). These trees are the meager remains of
true, indigenous Southern California forest.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Clarita, people who care about trees are fighting for one
live oak tree by sitting in it for two months. For them, planting a
seedling beyond the new road is not adequate mitigation. But here in
Orange County, only a small band of environmentalists seems to care
enough about our arboreal heritage to object to the destruction of so
many trees that are highly significant to a vision of Orange County
before it was overrun by paving and people. Where are the values of
the mainstream regarding the preservation of nature and our continued
ability to access it? We cannot be silent or delegate our collective
responsibility for the preservation of California's natural heritage
to a small group of environmentalists. We are all responsible for
preserving it.</TE>
<TE>   How can 162 houses that require disfiguring mountain foothills and
covering them with concrete possibly be more important than
preserving 600 acres of rolling foothills and the more than 1,000
mature live oak and sycamore trees that grow on them? How can 162
houses be worth changing the zoning requirements of the Trabuco
Foothill Specific Plan, designed to perpetuate the natural resources
and rural character of this area? The Orange County Planning
Department has abdicated its stewardship of preserving the meager
remnants of true nature in Orange County, not only for us but for
future generations.</TE>
<TE>   This disdain for zoning ordinances is appalling. If it is so easy
to overturn thoughtful ordinances protective of our natural heritage
for the sake of 162 houses, why have any ordinances? The commission
has behaved dictatorially and with condescension to the citizens who
came to object to its abuse of power.</TE>

<LD>Re "Fighting for Serenity," Dec. 22:</LD>
<LD>   I read with interest the latest in a long line of articles about
the Saddleback Meadows project. I represent a nearby landowner also
proposing development, so I am familiar with the area and interested
in the media's coverage of it. The basic angle of the story was an
interesting and legitimate one: development pressure pushing into
previously remote areas.</LD>
<LD>   The quotes from people with different viewpoints seemed to try to
look at the issue with some balance. However, the article implies
that the site is relatively pristine, when in fact it is highly
degraded (the endangered fairy shrimp present are found in disturbed
stock ponds, not natural vernal pools, and no gnatcatchers are
present). The most troubling "factual" assertion is that the
Saddleback Meadows site is the "only remaining wildlife corridor
connecting thousands of acres of open space." Have the editors of the
paper ever pressed the reporters who keep repeating this claim as
fact? Sure, the attorney who keeps suing the project has made this
claim (he may even believe it), but is Diane Wedner (or her editors)
aware that Dennis Murphy, a professor of conservation biology and
former president of the Society for Conservation Biology, recently
analyzed this assertion and found it fallacious?</LD>

<LD>Re "Familiar Clause Takes a Toll," Dec. 22, Editorial:</LD>
<LD>   I am happy to report that Riverside County, the Riverside County
Transportation Commission and the Orange County Transportation
Authority have worked out contract language that eliminates the
non-compete agreements for the 91 Express Lanes.</LD>
<LD>   Riverside County has supported OCTA's effort to buy the toll road
primarily because the purchase would eliminate the non-compete clause
and allow crucial improvements to the Riverside Freeway. OCTA's
commitment includes an investment of more than $200 million.</LD>
<TE>   Riverside County voters demonstrated their commitment by extending
our Measure A transportation sales tax. The extension guarantees more
than $490 million will be spent to improve the Riverside Freeway in
Riverside County. This all hinges on OCTA buying the toll road and
eliminating the non-compete clause.</TE>
<TE>   I'd like to stress that officials in Orange and Riverside counties
are working closer together than ever before to address
transportation issues, such as new transit and rail service and the
need for another corridor linking the two counties. I know our
growing relationship with Orange County will achieve lasting
transportation solutions that benefit residents in both counties.</TE>

<LD>Re "One Terrible Act Should Not Obscure Frats' Good Side," Dec. 14:</LD>
<LD>   Ross McCollum's plea for understanding of the fraternities falls
on a deaf and hostile ear in my home. You see, I live on the beach in
Newport, where we are subjected almost every night to the noisy,
raucous, drunken antics of the frat boys and their screeching,
dingbat sorority sisters.</LD>
<LD>   They scream, they drink, they live like the lowest order of
beer-guzzling, football-watching yahoos this country has to offer,
with zero respect for any of their neighbors and an obvious
indifference to their presumed academic callings. These guys deserve
every molecule of bad press they get.</LD>

<HD>Airport Buffer Zone Creates Another Divide</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "El Toro's Airport Buffer Retained by State Panel," Dec. 20:</LD>
<LD>   The California Airport Land Use Commission was wise to keep the
military-size El Toro buffer zone around the closed El Toro Marine
Corps Air Station. There are hundreds of federal, state, and local
agencies that can step in and open that airport.</LD>
<LD>   Builders who say their projects are being held up because they are
incompatible with the airport should ask themselves what would they
be doing now if the Marines had decided not to leave El Toro. A new
War Powers Act could easily derail Irvine's vicious scheme for
incompatible development, even if it managed to annex the base.
Irvine must learn that there are more important things than the
housing developers that run their city.</LD>
<TE>   Donald Nyre</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The ceaseless flood of letters from the few remaining El Toro
airport supporters clearly reveals what the rest of Orange County has
known all along. This entire airport issue has nothing to do with
Orange County passenger demand, international trade, job creation or
any of the myriad of other issues used to disguise the true agenda.
Newport Beach wants to rid itself of the inconvenience of John Wayne
Airport by putting the jets over the heads of thousands of others
seven miles away. Fortunately, the majority of county residents
recognizes this charade for what it is and has defeated an El Toro
airport once and for all. Turn out the lights Newport. The El Toro
party is over.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Soden</TE>
<TE>   Lake Forest</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Airport Land Use Commission did the right thing by maintaining
the buffer zone around El Toro. Despite the long odds of an airport
ever being built, our county seriously needs a timeout from more
development to deal with the problems of water availability, runoff,
sewers, crowded classrooms, traffic, landfills, and even
transportation infrastructure like (gasp!) airports.</TE>
<TE>   Measure W purported to be a "quality-of-life" measure promising
"open space and a nature preserve." It was a way to stop traffic and
pollution from an airport. Yet, development of the buffer zone -- and
the base itself -- will mean even less open space and even more
traffic and pollution. The big winners from Measure W are developers.
Eliminating the airport zoning and the buffer zone allows the
possibility to shoehorn 250,000 more people into Orange County. We
are already one of the densest and largest counties in the nation,
well on our way to becoming another New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   If there had been reasonable county growth, El Toro never would
have been an issue. More people will equal more consumption and more
airport demand.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to sprawling Orange County are three slow-growth
Central Coast counties: Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo and Monterey.
Sure, all have airports. However, having resided in two of those
three counties, I can attest the airports are small and friendly and
do not pose a nuisance. In Marin County, where the reuse of Hamilton
Air Force Base as a commercial airport was rejected, slow growth has
prevented an unwanted airport somewhere else. Because Orange County
voters rejected an El Toro airport, there should not be any more
growth to exacerbate the county's airport demand.</TE>
<TE>   Rex Ricks</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Go, Newport Beach officials! If residents of this county want more
flights, let them get their own airport.</TE>
<TE>   They have one that they have chosen not to use. El Toro does not
have the proximity to population density that John Wayne has. We will
not sit idly by while planes take off and land 24 hours a day. I
applaud Newport Beach's attention to the quality of life of its
residents.</TE>

<LD>Re "Forget the Speculation -- Spitzer Served Well," Dec. 8:</LD>
<LD>   Leonard Kranser, a strong activist in the effort to stop an El
Toro airport, continues to spin his political opinions. It doesn't
surprise me that Kranser is trying to justify the actions of his
friend, former Supervisor Todd Spitzer, while maligning opponents
Cynthia and Tom Coad.</LD>
<LD>   Spitzer may be a smart and articulate politician, but the decision
to vacate his supervisor seat early was certainly not due to any
altruistic reasons, as Kranser suggested. It was nothing more than a
clever scheme purposely designed to keep Tom Coad from being able to
run for Spitzer's vacated seat. Some call that smart politics, but
most of us consider it just a plain dirty trick.</LD>

What about all the children who have not been brought to the United

<TE>   Mitchell's proposal to provide taxpayer-subsidized college
education to illegal immigrants is a bad idea. Even though the
students themselves had no part in breaking the law, the fact is that
they are not citizens and as such have no right to remain here at
all, let alone receive Cal Grants. If they wish to attend college,
they should go back to their native countries and do so.</TE>

<LD>Re "Davis Says Tax Hikes Likely as Shortfall Soars," Dec. 19:</LD>
<LD>   Before blaming Gov. Gray Davis for all of our financial woes,
voters should look in the mirror. Last month Proposition 50, the
Clean Water Ballot Proposition, was approved by more than 54% of
those who voted. Much of this $6-billion raid on the state's general
fund will be going to finance acquisition of troubled projects from
landowners who put up millions to convince the gullible that it would
require no tax increase. What about the "clean water" promised in
those TV commercials? Well, the sponsors did come through in that
promise: All taxpayers are going to take a bath for sure.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas C. Rogers</LD>
<TE>   San Juan Capistrano</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Where was Davis when the state's budget shortfall was approaching
$3 billion? $5 billion? Or even $7 billion? He was too busy
increasing state spending that far outpaced our growth and raising
reelection money to advance his personal goals. Raise taxes? I think
not! How about lowering taxes that stimulate growth that generates
revenues? How about reforming workers' comp to bring back much-needed
jobs? Do what you were elected to do, Davis, and lead. Don't expect
Joe Citizen to bail you out.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Ashton</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I read where Davis is going to raise automobile registration fees
to help offset the budget deficit that he helped to create. Once
again taxing some but not all Californians. There are hundreds of
thousands of people in California who do not own a car, so they would
escape the increase. If he wants to tax everyone equally, why not tax
the food we buy at the grocery market? Everyone has to buy food. You
can live in California without a car, but not food. Wake up, Gray
Davis. You and your friends might have lots of money, but the
majority of us are living payday to payday.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Esslinger</TE>
<TE>   Fountain Valley</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   None of our elected representatives appear to have the slightest
grasp of economic reality. Everyone should remember this at our next
election.</TE>
<TE>   At the state level, in spite of an increase of almost $15 billion
over the past two months on top of a mind-boggling pre-existing
deficit, our new lawmakers are billing the taxpayers for their new
cars! I have yet to hear anyone, legislator or bureaucrat, ask to
rescind their recent pay raise or do what most businesses have had to
do: lay off employees or ask for wage concessions.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County supervisors are no better. After revelations
that the Planning Department has no idea how to plan, the supervisors
have given Thomas B. Mathews a golden parachute for increased
benefits in an earlier retirement. If he worked for any company, he
would have been fired for incompetence.</TE>
<TE>   I hope the voters have a long memory and remember these people at
the next election.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Economy Looks Good -- Not Great -- for 2003</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James L. Doti</AU>
<BD>James L. Doti is president of Chapman University in
Orange and the Donald Bren Distinguished Chair of Business and
Economics.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Borrowing from Leo Tolstoy: All economic expansions resemble one
another; every downturn is unhappy in its own way. This time around,
the unhappiness relates to the fact that while the U.S. economy
appears to be in an expansionary stage, jobs continue to be lost.</LD>
<LD>   The reason for this seeming anomaly is surging productivity.
Global competition combined with overcapacity has led businesses to
shed jobs while keeping output intact, thereby increasing output per
worker. The danger is that the job losses will eventually undermine
consumer spending, leading to recession.</LD>
<LD>   Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve are obviously nervous about
such a scenario and have responded with stimulative monetary policies
that have resulted in a real federal funds rate close to zero and
money supply growth of 10%. Government spending policies have also
been highly stimulative, with total federal and state deficits
projected to hit about $220 billion in 2002.</LD>
<TE>   These actions should be enough to move real GDP growth in 2003 to
3.1%, compared with 2.5% in 2002. This higher spending growth,
however, is expected to lead the Fed to reverse direction and start
increasing the federal funds rate by the second half of next year.
Long-term rates, including the mortgage rate, are projected to
increase about 100 basis points over the next year.</TE>
<TE>   These national trends obviously have important implications for
our local economy. In Orange County, higher spending growth at the
national level should spur greater job formation, while higher
mortgage rates will slow the pace of housing starts and reduce the
level of mortgage refinancing.</TE>
<TE>   This latter effect is significant in that record levels of
refinancing during the last year have given consumers a pipeline to
tap into the wealth created by higher housing prices. And it has been
this positive wealth effect that, in large part, has canceled the
negative impact of the stock market crash. It's sobering to note that
while the combined market capitalization of the New York Stock
Exchange and NASDAQ is off almost 35% from the high reached in August
2000, Orange County public companies are off 56%.</TE>
<TE>   Without a refinancing boom in housing to help fuel the purchase of
big-ticket items such as automobiles and household remodeling, what
will stimulate local spending and job growth? Fortunately, the worst
of the information technology crash is over. Though a strong recovery
is not in the offing, this high-tech industry, which is vitally
important to Orange County, will not be a drag on the economy as it
has been in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the purchasing managers index for Orange County that is
prepared by the Anderson Center for Economic Research suggests that
the manufacturing sector is starting to turn around after several
years of decline. In addition to a rebound in information technology,
significantly higher military spending and volume of international
trade on the export and import sides will spur job growth in
high-tech and durable goods manufacturing sectors.</TE>
<TE>   This year also included the creation of a study of data gathered
by Chapman University's A. Gary Anderson Center for Academic
Research. That study, which measures consumer confidence at the local
level, declined in 2002 but is significantly higher than that of the
U.S. This bodes well for Orange County to continue to outperform the
nation.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the Chapman University Model shows the county economy
generating 23,000 net new jobs in 2003 -- an improvement over 2002,
which had virtually no job growth.</TE>
<TE>   On the construction front, total building permit valuation is
forecast to again hit $3.3 billion, about the same as in 2002 and
2001.</TE>
<TE>   With all the weakness in the county's job growth in 2002, it's
surprising that housing price appreciation hit double-digit levels,
averaging 12.7%. Is a bubble forming in housing prices that will soon
burst? The answer to this question, at first glance, appears to be
yes, if one considers that this very rapid appreciation rate occurred
the same year that jobs were lost, stock market values and
concomitant option values dropped sharply and housing affordability
neared historic lows relative to the rest of the nation.</TE>
<TE>   On the other side of the equation, the supply of new and resale
housing remains tight. Demographic trends also auger well for housing
demand, as does our projection of a return to positive job growth.
Overall, we see the negatives strong enough to reduce housing
appreciation significantly, but the tight supply should keep it at
least in positive terrain at 2.0%.</TE>
<TE>   Chapman's forecast for Orange County contains good news. Following
the 1990-91 recession, the U.S. recovered while Orange County
continued to decline. Hit by the double whammy of sharp declines in
military spending and a depression in the construction industry,
Orange County continued to lose jobs and didn't really come out of it
until 1995 after declaring bankruptcy. Now things should be
different. The economy won't exactly be flying high, but it's a lot
better than being indefinitely grounded.</TE>

<HD>How Can Corporate Ethics Fail? Gradually</HD>
<DH>Are you asked to do things you couldn't tell your mom?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jone L. Pearce</AU>
<BD>Jone L. Pearce is dean of the Graduate School of
Management at UC Irvine and president of the Academy of Management.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The past year was a tough one for corporate leaders -- and for
business schools, which have not been left blameless. The MBA
credentials held by executives undergoing the "perp walk" have been
widely noted, and many have charged business schools as complicit.
Critics have called on business schools to teach more ethics classes.</LD>
<LD>   But are ethics courses the answer? After all, most of those
executives charged with crimes received their business degrees after
taking required ethics courses. Centuries of experience have shown
that ethical debates do little to stop individuals from lying,
cheating or stealing.</LD>
<LD>   We in business schools can help, but we can be more useful if we
do what we have been trained to do: Observe and then try to
understand what has happened.</LD>
<TE>   My own observation is that bad behavior is more a problem of the
slow and careful socialization of some managers and professionals who
now believe that exploitive, misleading actions are OK. It can be
called the "boiled frog problem." When you put a frog in a pot of
water and turn on the heat, the frog stays in the water and gets
cooked. But if you put a frog into water that is already boiling, the
frog will try to jump out and save itself.</TE>
<TE>   I am quite sure if you put fresh business-school graduates onto
the Enron audit or in the WorldCom executive suite, they would have
jumped out. No, it took years of careful socialization to produce
those Boiled Frogs.</TE>
<TE>   Why does Boiled Frog socialization happen, and what does it look
like? In part, it is a natural consequence of the difficulty of
drawing clear lines. Sophisticated adults realize that rigidly
following all rules isn't always sensible. In the real world, rules
must be bent when following them would do more harm than good. A
rigid, rule-insistent martinet should not progress beyond the first
level of management in any organization. And life isn't fair. The
older you get, the more you see that time and chance play a role, and
even the swift got that way through lucky genes.</TE>
<TE>   Ethics aren't always black and white, but that doesn't mean good
lines cannot be drawn. Business schools can help by speaking the
truth about those who draw the line too low. There is no golden key,
no ethics discussion that will provide lapse-proof protection to
everyone for all time. We learn where to draw our lines through
experiences, and those are different for everyone.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us back to our Boiled Frogs. Some new business-school
graduates will be thrown into companies where the water feels cold
but is slowly getting warmer. What do such pots look like, and how
can you recognize the heat before you get boiled? If you can answer
yes to these scenarios, the water is getting too hot:</TE>
<TE>   Do co-workers make job decisions for personal gain at the expense
of their employers or clients, and then laugh about it over lunch?
Pocketing personal profits from IPOs that were only offered to get
you to steer business to the investment banker clearly is not right.
Yes, we all do each other favors, but there is a line between a lunch
and an introduction and thousands of dollars of personal gain at your
employers' or clients' expense.</TE>
<TE>   Are you asked to do things you couldn't tell your mom? She is more
sophisticated than you thought back when you were a kid, and she
(unlike your boss) really is looking out for your interests.</TE>
<TE>   Are those who want to play fair denigrated with terms like "Boy
Scout" or "sissy"? People who call you these names are trying to get
you do something stupid. It probably isn't a coincidence that women
are overrepresented among the whistle-blowers in the corporate
scandals: They have no manhood to be threatened.</TE>
<TE>   Do the people who practice the above get ahead in your
organization? The water heats slowly, and in Boiled Frog companies,
neophytes are not shown the serious stuff too soon. New employees are
tested in small steps.</TE>
<TE>   If you see any of these Boiled Frog indicators, quit your job now.
Lengthy legal investigations are very expensive, and the money you
will make stamping license plates is much less than what you will
earn at your next job. Let the truly unethical people do the jail
time.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, my own coldly observing eye and commitment to truth
compel me to note that some faculty members in some business schools
are the first to turn up the heat on the pot of water. Here's how to
spot it: Your classroom instructor says business is a game of poker
and that everyone knows everyone else is lying.</TE>
<TE>   Business isn't a poker game. If people find out you are lying to
them, they will not take it lightly.</TE>
<TE>   In short, business schools should worry about telling our students
that they should be good, and that should make them smarter. Look
around. Think about the implications of what you are seeing, and
never be afraid to leave a bad situation. Isn't that the reason you
got your MBA in the first place?</TE>

<HD>Russell Berrie, 69; Toy Seller and Master Marketer of the
Cute, Cuddly and Cheap</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Russell Berrie, master marketer of things most people didn't need but
had to have, from small teddy bears to plastic trolls, has died. He
was 69.</LD>
<LD>   The founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Russ Berrie &amp;
Co. died Wednesday of heart failure in Oakland, N.J., where his
company is based.</LD>
<LD>   The one-time Bronx street kid and college dropout spent many years
selling toys for other businessmen. More than four decades ago,
Berrie offered his boss the bright idea of creating a few cutesy
items that could be sold for $1.</LD>
<TE>   When he was turned down -- the employer couldn't understand how to
make money on such low-priced merchandise -- Berrie set himself up as
an independent representative for various toy manufacturers and began
selling some of his own concoctions along with others' products.</TE>
<TE>   He designed his own items to be sold for $1, beginning with the
imaginative "fuzzy wuzzies" -- tiny critters made out of sheepskin
with moving eyes that bore various heartfelt messages. He called them
"three-dimensional greeting cards," and they caught on quickly.</TE>
<TE>   In 1963, with $500, a rented garage for storage and a closet in
his apartment for an office, Berrie founded his company. Sales went
from $60,000 the first year to $250,000 the second and $750,000 the
third.</TE>
<TE>   Over nearly four decades, Berrie offered the latest "impulse
gifts," which have included coffee mugs, various types of greeting
cards, kitchen magnets, candles, picture frames and perennially
popular stuffed animals, along with -- whenever they were in style --
trolls. Despite inflation, he kept prices at less than $10 for most
items.</TE>
<TE>   "We give you value, and we put a smile on people's faces," Berrie
said in a CNBC interview the day before he died.</TE>
<TE>   The little trolls, based on characters from Scandinavian folklore,
were introduced in the U.S. toy market by Thomas Dam of Denmark a
couple of years before Berrie went into business for himself.</TE>
<TE>   But Berrie, who admitted personally identifying with the trolls,
saw the expressive little characters as something he could cash in
on. During their spurts of popularity in the 1970s, the '80s and
again in the '90s, Berrie became one of the top three marketers of
trolls in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, sure, there were lawsuits. But a federal court ruled that
garden-variety trolls belonged in the public domain, and said no one
company -- not even Dam -- owned exclusive rights to the generic
troll design.</TE>
<TE>   When Berrie married his third wife, Angelica, in 1993, they
decorated their wedding reception tables with 9-inch-high blue- and
pink-haired trolls. Bride and groom trolls topped their cake.</TE>
<TE>   After all, trolls helped provide a current annual revenue for Russ
Berrie &amp; Co. of somewhere around $300 million.</TE>
<TE>   Berrie, who owned 26% of the company's stock as of September,
according to Bloomberg News business wire, made only one admitted
misjudgment with his business. In the early 1970s, he diverted his
attention and energy from sales and marketing -- always his strong
points -- and set up five factories to make his own products.</TE>
<TE>   By 1977, he had learned his lesson and turned to independent
manufacturers in Asia to subcontract production of his gift items,
while he concentrated on selling and product development.</TE>
<TE>   "Manufacturers should manufacture, accountants should account and
salesmen should sell," he told the Bergen (N.J.) Record in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   As a boy, Berrie was greatly impressed by the generosity of the
New York Police Athletic League, which enabled local police to take
him and other street kids to Yankee Stadium for baseball games every
summer.</TE>
<TE>   When he grew up and could afford it, Berrie became a
philanthropist, beginning with a $500 gift to the United Jewish
Appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Berrie went on to donate tens of millions of dollars to hospitals,
including $13.5 million in 1998 to the College of Physicians &amp;
Surgeons of Columbia University to establish the Russell Berrie
Medical Science Pavilion and the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, in
honor of his mother. He also gave lavishly to colleges and youth
support groups in the eastern United States and in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Berrie donated his time as well as money, serving as chairman of
the Center for Christian-Jewish Understanding and working to promote
the Special Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   His Russell Berrie Foundation earned the 2001 outstanding
foundation award of the New Jersey chapter of the Assn. of
Fundraising Professionals. Of all his personal accolades, Berrie most
prized his 1998 designation by Fortune magazine as one of the 40 most
generous Americans.</TE>

<CX>   Russell Berrie obituary -- The obituary of Russell Berrie in Sunday's
California section incorrectly said he died in Oakland, N.J. He died
at his home in Englewood, N.J. In addition, the obituary stated that
he married his third wife, Angelica, in 1993. In fact, she was his
fourth wife.</CX>

left Christmas Eve by his father under the "safe haven" law, a
hospital official said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The law allows a mother or any adult to anonymously leave unwanted
babies at any hospital within 72 hours of birth without the threat of
prosecution.</LD>
<LD>   The boy was dropped off at nearby Long Beach Memorial Medical
Center about 7 p.m. Tuesday, officials said. The baby will be turned
over to the county Department of Children and Family Services on
Monday.</LD>

<HD>County Audit Shows $1 Million Missing From Defunct Agency</HD>
<DH>San Gabriel Valley job training center closed recently over
alleged mismanagement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Zeke Minaya</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County auditors are searching for nearly $1 million that
appears to be missing from the tangled records of a San Gabriel
Valley employment agency that closed recently because of alleged
mismanagement.</LD>
<LD>   County officials have hired an independent accounting firm to
review the records of the Mid San Gabriel Valley Consortium and
determine what happened to the money. A final report is not expected
before February, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "The county will perform a 100% fiscal and program review," said
Adine Forman, a county spokeswoman.</LD>
<TE>   In response to this and other alleged accounting irregularities,
the county in November terminated its contracts with the El
Monte-based consortium, stripping away its more than $4-million
annual budget. The move, which forced the consortium's board to fire
the 42-member staff and end its job-training services, became
effective Nov. 30. Employment assistance is being handled by Career
Partners, an agency tapped by the county to take over the
consortium's contracts and headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   The consortium was founded 26 years ago to help people prepare for
jobs and find work. Last year, more than 17,000 residents of Baldwin
Park, El Monte and South El Monte walked through its doors looking
for help, according to county documents. The agency's six-member
board is made up of city council members from the three cities, who
are, in turn, responsible for appointing an executive director.</TE>
<TE>   The county unearthed several problems during a routine annual
audit of the consortium's financial records last spring, Forman said.</TE>
<TE>   Looking through the fiscal 2000-01 books, investigators discovered
that the county had been overbilled by $979,018. Consortium managers
padded their ledgers from month to month as a safety net, the
organization's officials explained at the time. Consortium
administrators returned the money in August.</TE>
<TE>   The county then examined the fiscal 2001-02 records to see if the
same overbilling practice had been repeated, Forman said. That's when
investigators were unable to locate the nearly $1 million, a
development that led to the pending independent audit, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators also found that the consortium had not been paying
its bills, Forman said. The consortium had an outstanding balance
totaling $443,831 owed to more than 75 vendors, according to county
documents.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators found that alleged problems were not restricted to
the handling of money, the county documents show. In a Nov. 14 letter
critical of the consortium, the county's head of Community and Senior
Services, Josie Marquez, wrote that "services claimed were not
provided. Clients were served at unapproved sites. Clients were
dissatisfied with services provided or with lack of services
provided."</TE>
<TE>   The consortium has had four executive directors during the last
year. None could be reached for comment. Officials from the cities
once served by the consortium are waiting for the audit results,
hoping to find out what went wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as the million dollars, I can't see someone putting it in
their pocket and walking out," said Manuel Lozano, Baldwin Park's
mayor and a former president of the consortium board.</TE>
<TE>   El Monte Mayor Rachel Montes said she is glad that local residents
who had turned to the consortium for help will continue to have a
place to go for job training despite the problems. "I'm disappointed,
like everybody else," said Montes, a consortium board member. "My
first priority is serving our communities with job resources."</TE>

<HD>Freeway Extension Eases Gridlock -- for Now</HD>
<DH>A 14-mile addition to Foothill roadway has drivers racing
through parts of the San Gabriel Valley, but traffic experts fear it
won't last.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hugo Martin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a region cursed with the nation's worst gridlock, a new 14-mile
stretch of freeway that opened in the San Gabriel Valley last month
is being welcomed like a cool oasis in a parched desert.</LD>
<LD>   The extension of the Foothill Freeway from La Verne to Rancho
Cucamonga is close to commuter nirvana: smooth pavement and
graffiti-free street signs. During a weekday rush hour in Claremont,
traffic on the new stretch was moving at 75 mph -- in the slow lane.</LD>
<LD>   "It's fabulous," said Molly Mitchell, a Los Angeles County
sheriff's deputy who credits the new Foothill Freeway extension for
cutting 20 minutes out of her daily commute from her home in Rancho
Cucamonga to her job in Whittier.</LD>
<TE>   She is so happy with her commute that she is almost sorry to be
retiring from her job in three months.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish they had finished it three years ago," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The relatively free-flowing roadway has become so tempting to some
lead-footed drivers that the California Highway Patrol recently
cracked down on speeders, netting 200 violators, including a motorist
who was clocked at 95 mph on a weekday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone is happy with the side effects of the new
freeway, and transportation experts predict the fast-moving traffic
will not last.</TE>
<TE>   Some commuters complain that the new extension is drawing traffic
off the chronically congested San Bernardino Freeway, which runs
parallel to the Foothill Freeway, and dumping additional cars and
trucks onto the previously built section of the freeway that cuts
through Azusa, Glendora, Monrovia and Arcadia.</TE>
<TE>   "Going that way is ugly," Carmen Valverde, who commutes from her
home in La Verne to her job in East Los Angeles, said while filling
up her tank at a gas station near the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   But with a huge population boom expected in Riverside and San
Bernardino counties, experts say it is only a matter of time before
the entire stretch of the Foothill Freeway gets as ugly as other
gridlocked freeways in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the California Department of Transportation said it
is too early to tell for certain how the new extension will affect
traffic patterns throughout the region.</TE>
<TE>   But some transportation experts say the freeway will probably
start to fill up soon as a result of "latent demand," a theory that
says adding freeway lanes will only accommodate more driving trips,
thus making freeway construction only a temporary solution.</TE>
<TE>   "When congestion gets bad, people get more judicious about
driving," said Brian Taylor, director of the Institute of
Transportation Studies at UCLA. Conversely, he said, when congestion
eases, drivers are more inclined to get behind the wheel.</TE>
<TE>   State transportation officials say the extension -- part of a
larger 28-mile stretch that will be completed by 2006 -- is probably
one of the last major freeway projects in Southern California. For
the most part, the state will focus on maintaining existing freeways
and adding carpool lanes where possible.</TE>
<TE>   For some motorists, it has been too tempting. The CHP recently
deployed 16 patrol cars and a helicopter to crack down on speeders on
the new stretch of freeway between Fontana and Claremont.</TE>
<TE>   "Speeds are significantly higher today on that stretch," said CHP
officer Bill Russell.</TE>
<TE>   It seems the extension has already benefited the entire freeway
system in the region. The 14-mile stretch connects with a previously
completed six-mile section between Fontana and Rancho Cucamonga and
hooks up with Interstate 15, creating a new, more direct route from
Los Angeles County to Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Since the freeway extension opened, CHP officials and airborne
traffic reporters say traffic has been much lighter on the parallel
San Bernardino Freeway. Traffic on parallel city streets, such as
Foothill Boulevard and Baseline Road, has also eased. Before the
extension opened, such roads were usually gridlocked during peak
commute hours.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly makes getting around a whole lot better," said
Carole Anthony, president of the Upland Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   She said merchants along the parallel thoroughfares hope the
improved traffic flow will entice more shoppers to patronize
businesses on the now-clearer streets.</TE>
<TE>   The new freeway section has been good news to businesses that
depend on reliable transportation, including Holliday Rocks, a sand,
gravel and concrete company in Upland. Jim Holliday, the company's
vice president, said his company can now haul concrete to customers
as far away as Los Angeles without fear that it will dry and harden
along the way.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big improvement for us," he said.</TE>

<HD>She Shares Her AIDS Archive With the World</HD>
<DH>A nun built a Web site that has become the definitive
information source on the disease.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Gottlieb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a San Juan Capistrano mobile home, Sister Mary Elizabeth Clark has
labored for a dozen years on a homemade computer network creating
what AIDS experts say is the most definitive -- and perhaps the most
accessible -- source of information on the disease.</LD>
<LD>   The 24-by-60-foot trailer a few blocks from the beach is the
headquarters of the AIDS Education Global Information System, a free
Web site with 750,000 documents on the pandemic.</LD>
<LD>   The vast archive, which Clark and her staff of two update daily
with articles from medical journals, magazines, news services and
newspapers from around the globe, has had more than 7 million hits
this year. AEGIS lists court decisions, fact sheets and treatment
information at www.aegis.org. If anyone has come close to collecting
the definitive AIDS library, it is the 64-year-old Clark.</LD>
<TE>   She has built the computer network, negotiated with publishers for
permission to use their material and has worked on average 18 hours a
day for years updating the database.</TE>
<TE>   "She provides incredible and important information for my daily
life, and I couldn't get along without it," playwright and AIDS
activist Larry Kramer said. "I want to know everything about AIDS and
the politics of it and the treatment of it and the research of it.
And in one Web site, she combines it all with such incredible skill
and speed and accuracy that the mind boggles."</TE>
<TE>   Users include the afflicted and the powerful.</TE>
<TE>   During the Clinton administration, Clark said, AEGIS software
showed that each day at 9:30 a.m. Eastern time someone would access
the Web site from the executive office of the president of the United
States to check the latest postings.</TE>
<TE>   For people in isolated areas who have access to a computer, AEGIS
can be invaluable. Its "Ask the Doc" project, started in January, has
fielded 170 questions from six continents, such as a recent one from
an Ethiopian whose HIV-positive son is 4 1/2. The man wondered if his
son would live long enough to go to college.</TE>
<TE>   "To be able to write a medical doctor in the U.S. and get an
answer to a question for free is really phenomenal," said Dr. Mark
Katz, who directs HIV care for Kaiser Permanente of Southern
California and is AEGIS' medical advisor.</TE>
<TE>   AEGIS recently was nominated for inclusion in UNESCO's Memory of
the World Programme, which is dedicated to preserving valuable
holdings of all types in archives and libraries around the world. The
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's
principal aims are to promote collaboration among nations, to fight
intolerance and further human rights.</TE>
<TE>   Kramer has suggested Clark for an award from the American
Foundation for AIDS Research.</TE>
<TE>   AEGIS, which has a budget of about $200,000, survives on grants,
mostly from Connecticut drug manufacturer Boehringer Ingelheim.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the trailer, the loud hum of a computer cooling system
provides a 24-hour-a-day soundtrack to the work. Luckily for
neighbors, there is plenty of soundproofing. AEGIS has taken over the
dining room and living room. Clark has turned her bedroom into an
office she calls her "command post."</TE>
<TE>   Long before she started AEGIS, Clark had a penchant for drawing
attention. That's what happens when you enlist in the Navy as a man
and in the Army as a woman, then try to become an Episcopal nun.</TE>
<TE>   She spent 17 years in the Navy as Michael Clark, where she learned
electronics and scuba diving and rose to the rank of chief petty
officer before being honorably discharged in 1974. Clark had been
married twice by then and fathered a son. She underwent a sex change
in 1975 and moved to Orange County to take care of her aging parents.</TE>
<TE>   She enlisted in the Army Reserves in 1976, and her recruiter later
said Clark had never hidden the fact that she was a transsexual.
After 19 months of service, though, higher-ups voided her enlistment.
The sex change, the Army said, disqualified her for enlistment. She
sued with help from the American Civil Liberties Union, winning a
$25,000 settlement and an honorable discharge.</TE>
<TE>   Then she got religion, and controversy quickly followed. Clark had
been reared in Pontiac, Mich., as a Southern Baptist -- a "right-wing
religious zealot," she called herself. But she said she fell away
from religion because of racist churches she saw when stationed in
the South.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, she felt a pull back toward religion and began
searching for a religious order dedicated to social justice. "I was
interested in becoming a nun from when I was 8 years old," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Clark formed her own order and took vows of poverty, chastity and
obedience at St. Clement's By-the-Sea Episcopal Church in San
Clemente. The bishop rejected them within the week. The Episcopal
Diocese said she had not met the requirements for forming a new
order, that she needed more sisters and more time.</TE>
<TE>   Undeterred, Clark continues to consider herself a nun.</TE>
<TE>   "I made my vows to God, not to a church," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In January 1989, she headed to Missouri to herd cows. The plan --
not a well-thought-out one, she now concedes -- was to make enough
money ranching to donate beef to homeless shelters and the needy. It
didn't work out, but her time there led to her life's work.</TE>
<TE>   "I can safely say that if I hadn't gone to Missouri, AEGIS
wouldn't have happened," Clark said.</TE>
<TE>   In the town of Stover, southwest of Jefferson City, a
circuit-riding doctor showed up once a week for four hours. At the
local Wal-Mart, she noticed a young man she thought had AIDS. In
those days, an AIDS diagnosis meant death was imminent.</TE>
<TE>   The man was terrified neighbors would learn of his disease and
treat him as an outcast. It got her thinking about AIDS sufferers
living isolated and apart from people who could provide emotional
support and information on their condition.</TE>
<TE>   She remembered her 1986 gallbladder surgery in Orange County, and
the doctors and nurses who were fearful of her because of her sex
change. She thought the emerging AIDS epidemic might have been behind
their attitudes.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, she was HIV-negative. "It was a good object lesson
showing me how vulnerable an HIV-positive person was," she said.</TE>
<TE>   When Clark moved to her parents' mobile home in San Juan
Capistrano, she built a computer. Then she launched the electronic
bulletin board that became AEGIS as the Internet blossomed.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think too far into the future," she said. "It just
started to ... grow."</TE>
<TE>   Clark still lives in the mobile home with her 91-year-old father,
who is blind. The American Catholic Church, a small religious group
that doesn't require that clergy be celibate, has recognized her as a
nun. Occasionally, she attends a Roman Catholic church.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everyone has to ... [learn] it's not the religion, but
the spiritual relationship you have with God that's important," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Clark has two full-time assistants and an accountant who is trying
to put the organization on solid financial footing. She still rises
at 5 a.m. and peruses the Web for items AEGIS should pick up. But her
role these days is to ensure that the computers keep running.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in the background," she said, at which her helpers laughed.</TE>
<TE>   Clark knows she must train others so AEGIS can continue without
her.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in effect the de facto history of the epidemic," she said.
"I never knew we'd grow this big."</TE>

<HD>Lucy Grealy, 39; Wrote Candid Memoir on Her Disfigurement</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mary Rourke</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lucy Grealy, whose 1994 memoir, "Autobiography of a Face," was a
fearless account of growing up with a disfigurement caused by cancer,
died Dec. 18 in New York City. She was 39.</LD>
<LD>   Her fiercely honest account of this tortured existence and what it
was like for her to be "ugly" in a society obsessed with physical
beauty captured national attention. For a time she was the toast of
talk shows and literary circles. More recently, however, she suffered
from depression. She had been staying at the home of friends at the
time of her death. The cause was not announced.</LD>
<LD>   Born Lucinda Margaret Grealy (pronounced GRAY-lee) in Dublin,
Ireland, she was one of five children. Her father, Desmond, helped
found RTE, the Irish national broadcasting network, before he moved
the family to Spring Valley, N.Y., when Lucy was 4.</LD>
<TE>   He worked as a news producer for ABC and CBS, commuting to New
York City. Her mother, Trena Anne, stayed at home to raise their
children.</TE>
<TE>   Grealy was diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma, a rare and often lethal
form of cancer that began as a dental cyst. Starting when she was 9,
Grealy had chemotherapy and radiation treatments as often as five
times each week for five years. It dissolved nearly half of her jaw
bone.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next 15 years she had 30 surgeries, hoping each time to
restore her once-pretty face. Most of the operations were failures.</TE>
<TE>   Grealy's memoir about the long years leading up to her imperfect
face launched a book tour and a spate of articles about her.
Interviewers invariably described her large, bright eyes as
expressing a type of wisdom formed by pain.</TE>
<TE>   Book reviewers called her story unforgettable.</TE>
<TE>   "So many memoirs make you feel that you've been sealed up inside a
wall with a monomaniac," wrote Margo Jefferson in the New York Times.
"A really good one, like 'Autobiography of a Face,' makes you feel
there is more to ask and learn. You are not just seeing a writer; you
are not trying to see yourself. You are seeing the world in a
different way."</TE>
<TE>   While other teenage girls hoped that a new haircut or diet might
bring true happiness, Grealy hoped that each new surgery would make
her lovable. "How could I pass up the possibility it might work, that
at long last I might finally fix my face, fix my life, my soul?"</TE>
<TE>   "When my face gets fixed, then I'll start living."</TE>
<TE>   Her physical pain was compounded by the taunts of schoolboys who
called her "dog girl." In seventh grade she decided she was too ugly
for school and spent most of the year at home.</TE>
<TE>   By the time she wrote about these experiences, at 31, Grealy had
gained some perspective. "I'd spent 15 years being treated for
nothing other than looking different from everyone else," she
explained in her memoir. "It was the pain from that, from feeling
ugly, that I always viewed as the great tragedy in my life. The fact
that I had cancer seemed minor in comparison."</TE>
<TE>   During her long years of illness and recovery, her family
struggled with other problems. Grealy's older brother developed
schizophrenia at 17. Her mother was hospitalized for depression. Her
father could hardly bear the pain of seeing Lucy in the hospital, and
the family's medical bills were crushing. Desmond Grealy died when
Lucy was 15.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very hard to talk to Lucy," her mother later said about
those years. "I had four other children and there were a lot of other
tragedies going on in our family at the same time."</TE>
<TE>   Lucy's twin sister, Sarah, said that illness did not greatly
change her twin's natural inclinations. "Lucy was a loner," Sarah
said in 1994. "She would have been a loner whether this happened to
her or not.... I think Lucy went through something that she wasn't
able to explain when she was young."</TE>
<TE>   At 18, Grealy entered Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, N.Y.
For the first time she made real friends and found something outside
of herself to absorb her. "Poetry became a religion for me," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   The poems of Rainer Maria Rilke and John Ashbery brought back
feelings she had while she was recovering from chemotherapy sessions,
when "simply to 'be' was reason enough for joy. I knew that joy was a
kind of fearlessness, a letting go of expectations."</TE>
<TE>   She graduated from Sarah Lawrence in 1985 and entered the master
of fine arts program at the University of Iowa in 1987. She later
taught at both schools and at Amherst College, Bennington College and
New School University.</TE>
<TE>   Her poetry began to appear in literary magazines, gaining a stream
of honors and awards. She won the Academy of American Poets Prize and
the Times Literary Supplement Poetry Prize. Her first book, "Everyday
Alibis," included poems and a novel.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, she received the Whiting Writer's Award for new literary
talents.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Grealy published her third book, "As Seen on TV:
Provocations," a collection of essays, including one on what it was
like for her to become a U.S. citizen, and others on riding horseback
and learning to tango.</TE>
<TE>   Only her memoir brought her the recognition and acceptance she
longed for and never thought she would know. The burst of attention
thrilled and unsettled her. "There are points where I think, 'Great,
I'm getting famous for being ugly,' " she told People magazine in
1994.</TE>
<TE>   She refused to wear makeup and mistrusted the beauty editors who
called. "They wanted me to represent the truism, or the platitude,
that beauty is only skin deep and it's what's on the inside that
makes you beautiful," Grealy told the Boston Herald in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   She preferred an alternative to their cliche: "It is important to
enlarge the repertoire of people you can find attractive," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Grealy wished she had learned that lesson sooner. "If I had put
one-tenth of the energy I spent obsessing over my face and my body
into my work, I could have written 'War and Peace' 10 times over,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   During one of Grealy's book tours, an interviewer asked whether
pain and suffering are a prerequisite for great art. She doubted it.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at it this way," she said. If a bad childhood made someone
an artist, "we'd be a country of geniuses."</TE>
<TE>   Grealy is survived by her mother and three siblings.</TE>

<KH>TIMES HOLIDAY FUND</KH>
<HD>Clinic's Teen Aides Ease Peers' Fears</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nita Lelyveld</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At first glance, the North Hollywood waiting room looks
doctor's-office standard -- beige walls, rows of salmon-colored
chairs, a reception desk walled off with glass. On a recent night,
16-year-old Maricela entered the room, clutching her boyfriend's hand
and looking nervous.</LD>
<LD>   She had come to the Valley Community Clinic's Teen Clinic scared
-- that she might have a sexually transmitted disease, that she
might, a week after first having sex, not know how to keep from
getting pregnant.</LD>
<LD>   Waiting to be seen, she sat hunched in on herself, shoulders
nearly parallel to the floor. Then she began to relax a little.</LD>
<TE>   Partly it was seeing Christina Aguilera belting out a song on the
waiting room TV, always tuned to MTV. Mostly it was seeing other
teenagers like herself working on the clinic staff.</TE>
<TE>   "They're laughing and joking -- not so serious," Maricela said.
"Seeing people my age -- that makes me feel less embarrassed."</TE>
<TE>   The Teen Clinic, open on Saturdays and until 9 p.m. four nights a
week, gives Valley teenagers extensive training so that they can talk
accurately to their peers about difficult subjects: STDs, AIDS,
contraceptives, pregnancy testing. Before a jittery youth speaks to a
nurse or sees a doctor, one of the teenagers on the staff opens the
conversation, asking the reason for the visit, easing fears.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley Community Clinic is one of 56 service organizations
that received grants from last year's Times Holiday Campaign. The
help was desperately needed. The organization doesn't just run the
Teen Clinic, but also provides everything from basic medical care to
optometry and family counseling to thousands of uninsured and
underinsured people of all ages across the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the clinic had 45,000 patient visits, though it has
only enough staff and funding to scratch the surface of the need,
said Ann Britt, its president and chief executive. And state and
county health-care cuts are increasing the demand.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we've fully felt the impact of it yet. It's going
to get much worse," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Teen Clinic's services are free or low-cost. Medications are
free. And there's much more to the program than doctor visits. The
clinic's health educators fan out across the Valley, teaching health
education at nearly every public high school. That's how many
teenagers first find out there's a place they can go to ask questions
and get care. Many are poor and don't have regular doctors. And they
are frightened.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Hernandez, 18, was the clinic staff member who helped put
Maricela at ease. He started working at the clinic 3 1/2 years ago,
when he was younger than Maricela. "I tried to make her smile. I
joked a little," he said. "She said she felt kind of embarrassed. I
told her she didn't have to be. And I think it helped."</TE>

<HD>Low-Key Inauguration Planned for Davis' Second Term</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregg Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>With Californians bracing for a grim year of higher taxes and severe
cuts in state spending, Gov. Gray Davis is scaling down inaugural
celebrations marking the start of his second term Jan. 6.</LD>
<LD>   The dilemma for Davis: how to reward supporters with the expected
celebratory spoils without projecting a "let them eat cake" attitude
toward Californians facing painful budget cuts, one advisor said.</LD>
<LD>   Davis and his aides say the leaner festivities will reflect the
subdued tenor of the times. They will spend less than $1 million on
four official functions, all paid for from private donations --
compared with $3.7 million lavished on 13 events when the Democratic
governor took office four years ago.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a low-key inaugural," said Gabriel Sanchez, spokesman for
the Davis inaugural committee.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor recognizes the situation California is in. He wanted
to do events that were dignified but appropriate and respectful of
the times."</TE>
<TE>   With most states facing severe budget shortfalls, many governors
across the country are taking a similarly austere approach to their
inaugurals. But even less prosperous Alabama is planning to spend
between $750,000 and $1 million to celebrate the election of
Republican Bob Riley as governor.</TE>
<TE>   Davis is going further than some of his counterparts by scrapping
plans for the traditional inaugural ball in favor of a casual
"Celebrate California" party at the Sacramento Convention Center.
Other events from the first Davis inaugural have also been shelved,
including a black-tie gala and a rock 'n' roll ball.</TE>
<TE>   True to his self-described centrist tendencies, Davis paid tribute
to the political right and the left with his choices for inaugural
co-hosts: the California Chamber of Commerce and the California Labor
Federation. Uniting these longtime political protagonists in a common
cause underscores the inaugural's theme of "bringing Californians
together," Sanchez said.</TE>
<TE>   The official inaugural schedule begins Saturday with a "Day of
Service" in Southern California. About 9 a.m., Davis, other elected
officials and more than 100 volunteers will gather at the Banning
Park Childcare Facility in Wilmington to restore a mural, plant
greenery and perform other chores.</TE>
<TE>   The next stop for the governor and other participants will be
Century Villages at Cabrillo in Long Beach, a transitional housing
facility for homeless veterans and others. The group is supposed to
pick up trash, refurbish a basketball court, plant trees and perform
other acts of service.</TE>
<TE>   Next Sunday, Davis will attend Mass with his wife and other
members of his extended family, probably in Sacramento, Sanchez said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis will be sworn in at noon the following day at Sacramento's
Memorial Auditorium. California Chief Justice Ronald George will
administer the oath of office.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Davis will have lunch with the corporate and individual
donors -- about 70 people -- who are picking up the tab for the
inaugural events, to "thank them for their support," Sanchez said.</TE>
<TE>   The final event will be the casual-dress "Celebrate California"
party that evening at the Sacramento Convention Center for invited
guests only. Tickets cost $15, compared with admission prices of $25
to $125 for events celebrating Davis' first inaugural.</TE>
<TE>   "What the governor wanted was for the party to be less formal,"
Sanchez said. "It's not a ball. Top hats are not required and are not
encouraged."</TE>
<TE>   The inaugural committee is raising about $1 million to cover the
costs of the celebrations, with donors choosing from three levels of
sponsorship: $50,000 for platinum status; $25,000 for gold status and
$10,000 for silver.</TE>
<TE>   Funding inaugurals from corporate and private donations is common
practice in California and other states.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics suggest it is crass to hold even subdued celebrations
when the state is facing a projected budget shortfall of nearly $35
billion. But Davis defenders say the celebrations are the trappings
of democracy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a time for Californians to celebrate," said Assembly Speaker
Herb Wesson (D-Culver City). "It's a time for Californians to be
proud."</TE>

<HD>Iranian Anger on AM Dial</HD>
<DH>Persian station KIRN serves as a forum for immigrants upset
by Dec. 16 detentions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Mena</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As dozens of immigrant men were being jailed during a special INS
registration, a small Persian-language radio station became a town
plaza of the airwaves for friends and relatives -- a gathering place
for the frustrated, the angry and the scared.</LD>
<LD>   The station, KIRN-AM (670), canceled its programming to focus on
the registration, which some callers likened to the internment of
people of Japanese ancestry during World War II. The station
spearheaded a protest rally outside the Federal Building in Los
Angeles. It took calls from jailed immigrants.</LD>
<LD>   To some, the coverage bordered on shock radio, stirring anger
among immigrants. But to many, it marked a coming of age for
Hollywood-based KIRN, proving that a small, low-wattage station could
be a powerful conduit to an ethnic community searching for answers
and a forum.</LD>
<TE>   "The station is a kind of town hall," said Navid Sharafatian, a
listener. "It became a clearinghouse of information. There is Farsi
television and other radio, but 670 has become a meeting place for
the Iranian community."</TE>
<TE>   Station representatives said they preempted programming to talk
about the detention of certain Middle Eastern immigrants because they
wanted to be the prime source of news for the Iranian community.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in a major market, but the Iranian community is a small
town and we are the meeting place," said John Paley, station manager.
"If a kid loses his dog, we are on the story. To be on top of [the
detentions] was a natural."</TE>
<TE>   Usually Homespun</TE>
<TE>   Typically, the station buzzes with hominess. KIRN talk show host
Sharzad Ardalan, for instance, spends an hour a week taking calls
from listeners looking for lost friends. She recently hooked up a
caller with a long-lost schoolmate, whom the caller could identify
only by her first name. The schoolmate called in to the show from
Israel.</TE>
<TE>   When Persian pop diva Googosh, silenced for two decades by Islamic
fundamentalists, couldn't make her fall concert in Los Angeles
because she was not granted a visa on time, she apologized to her
fans on KIRN.</TE>
<TE>   KIRN is the brainchild of radio executive Howard Kalmenson, who
bought two Spanish-language radio stations in the 1960s because he
sensed a growing market in Los Angeles. Kalmenson, who now owns 30
stations through Lotus Communications, used the same logic when he
saw an area known as "Little Tehran" on the Westside.</TE>
<TE>   After the 1979 revolution, the largest population of Iranian
emigrants in the world settled in Southern California. Though census
figures say slightly more than 101,000 people in the five-county area
are of Iranian ancestry, community leaders insist that the number is
closer to 600,000.</TE>
<TE>   Kalmenson's research showed no major media broadcasting in
Persian, except for a few hours of radio and television on other
stations and radio programs on closed-circuit broadcasts that could
be heard only by those who have adapters.</TE>
<TE>   The station cranked up in August 1999 with no advertising and "has
been more successful than our wildest dreams," said Paley. For the
most part, the advertising is local, ranging from Mercedes Benz of
Laguna Niguel to Flames Restaurant in Glendale to Alef Market in
Beverly Hills. On Saturday and Sunday afternoons, real estate,
banking and medical firms fill the airwaves with infomercials.</TE>
<TE>   Shows focus on maintaining traditions and thriving in a new
culture, including live Persian coverage of Laker games. Listeners
call in with praise and criticism as if they were phoning relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Farhang Holakouee, an American-trained family counselor, runs a
call-in show from 3 to 5 p.m. in which he may spend as much as 30
minutes with a single caller. Much of the discussion revolves around
cultural adaptation and the differences between immigrant parents and
their American-born children.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 16 it changed, and his show was dominated by calls from
men jailed by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. The
INS had asked immigrants with visitor status to register by that
date. But when many came forth voluntarily for fingerprinting,
photographs and interviews, they were taken into custody because
their visas had expired, even though many were processing their
paperwork to gain U.S. residency.</TE>
<TE>   The Iranian community was outraged at the detentions, feeling that
the practice implied they were terrorists and that the U.S. could
unfairly deport some to a country they left decades ago as children.
By midday, KIRN was flooded with calls.</TE>
<TE>   Some Disappointed</TE>
<TE>   Some Iranian Americans were disappointed by the station's nonstop
coverage. Massoud Akhari, a volunteer with the Orange County-based
group International Harmony, called the programming "shock radio."</TE>
<TE>   "The radio should not have encouraged a protest in front of a
federal building," said Akhari, who thought public protests were in
poor form.</TE>
<TE>   "The appropriate thing would have been to go to the INS and speak
calmly about what is happening."</TE>
<TE>   But many listeners found common ground by dialing in KIRN after
the INS registration.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is listening day and night to find out what is going
on," said Soheila Jonoubi, an attorney who helped lead the protest
outside the INS offices. "It was a way that no one had to go through
this alone."</TE>

<HD>Organizers of Kwanzaa Celebration Reach Out</HD>
<DH>With Orange County blacks so few, their emphasis is on
educating the wider community.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claire Luna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jah-Anen Mobley and his two sons are pounding their drums, his wife a
whirling blur in a rainbow garment. When the Orange County members of
an African music ensemble are staging a performance, one Anaheim
family is all the audience gets.</LD>
<LD>   To celebrate the African American holiday of Kwanzaa in Orange
County, where only 2% of the population is black, organizers have to
work a little harder to get the point across. Aside from making do
with a smaller-than-normal number of musicians, the organizers have
to invite storytellers from other counties and purchase costumes and
traditional paraphernalia in Leimert Park, a neighborhood at the
heart of Los Angeles' black community.</LD>
<LD>   But the nearly 150 people who attended a Kwanzaa celebration
Saturday at the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana were still enthralled as
Mobley and his family danced, children lighted candles symbolizing
the holiday's seven principles, and narrators explained the holiday's
history.</LD>
<TE>   The African Cultural Arts Council, a museum affiliate, has held
the event for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Kwanzaa, created in 1966 by a Cal State Long Beach professor,
stretches from Dec. 26 to Jan. 1 and celebrates the connection
between black Americans and African traditions.</TE>
<TE>   The holiday is marked in Orange County at homes, in churches and
elsewhere by other organizations. But none has the drawing power of
the Bowers Museum event. The museum also honors Juneteenth and Martin
Luther King Jr.'s birthday, and is for some African Americans in the
county the closest thing they have to a cultural hub.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all so spread out around the county," said Virginia
Stovall, event chairwoman. "This is the only place where you'll see
this many black people together in Orange County, outside of church."</TE>
<TE>   When an elementary school teacher wandered through the crowd
before the event, inquiring where she could buy a Kwanzaa
candleholder in Orange County for a classroom display, Stovall and
other event organizers were stumped. "Are you sure you can't get up
to L.A.?" Stovall asked. "Our community down here hasn't gotten that
far yet to have those kinds of stores."</TE>
<TE>   With a few dozen more attendees than last year, the event and
other cultural celebrations show Orange County is embracing its black
community more, said Mobley, who this month started organizing Sunday
reggae events in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   "We're growing, strengthening our circle," he said. "Since there
aren't a lot of us here, our emphasis is on getting people of all
races and cultures interested in African traditions."</TE>
<TE>   Willia Edmonds, co-organizer of the event, said she wished more
races were represented among attendees, more than three-fourths of
whom were black.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be nice to have more of a mix so it becomes less an us
or a them thing," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "This event helps people cross cultural boundaries, removing the
mystery behind the holiday."</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Rose, 27, of Whittier said Kwanzaa events are the only way
she can teach her two sons the meaning of the holiday.</TE>
<TE>   "My grandmother had told me Kwanzaa was about black people trying
to separate and be their own power," Rose said. "But I learned today
that it's about appreciating our culture and hoping others do the
same."</TE>

<HD>Bid to Reform Consumer Act Gains Steam</HD>
<DH>Assemblyman, trial lawyers call for change in law that
businesses charge has made them victims of extortion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Monte Morin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pressure is mounting to amend one of California's stiffest
consumer-protection laws amid charges that it allows attorneys to
effectively extort money from businesses with frivolous lawsuits.</LD>
<LD>   An Anaheim assemblyman plans to hold hearings on the matter and
said he would introduce legislation changing portions of the Unfair
Competition Act next year. Meanwhile, a top trial lawyers group, long
a defender of the act, said it is time to make reforms.</LD>
<LD>   The act was designed to help consumers fight unfair business
practices by prohibiting such things as false advertising and
price-fixing. It allows plaintiffs to file lawsuits even if they have
not been directly harmed by the alleged wrongdoing.</LD>
<TE>   The act has long been criticized by business groups, which claim
it allows attorneys to shake down merchants with false claims.
Supporters have successfully fought efforts to amend the law over the
years, arguing that it gives consumers the ability to "prosecute"
unfair business practices that district attorneys don't have time to
pursue.</TE>
<TE>   But now, even the leader of the Consumer Attorneys of California
said he would support changes, saying that some attorneys are abusing
the act. He said others have cited a Beverly Hills law firm that over
the last year has filed thousands of suits against Southern
California restaurants, nail salons and auto-repair garages.</TE>
<TE>   That firm, the Trevor Law Group, says those businesses are
cheating the public. The suits accuse restaurants of not meeting
health codes, garages of selling used parts as new and similar
violations. But defendants say the lawyers are cooking up frivolous
suits based on government records of routine citations just to
pressure businesses to settle for about $2,000.</TE>
<TE>   State Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer this month called on the State Bar
Assn. to examine whether disciplinary action should be taken against
the attorneys, likening some of their tactics to extortion.</TE>
<TE>   "At latest count, there are five firms that are just taking
advantage of a wonderful consumer-protection statute," said Bruce
Brusavich, president of the Consumer Attorneys of California. "We're
encouraging the attorney general and the State Bar to crank up their
investigation into the groups. Meanwhile, we're seeing if there's a
legislative way to take the extortion incentive out of this law."</TE>
<TE>   Brusavich has two changes in mind: require judges to approve all
litigation settlements and make those settlements public. He said
these changes would help prevent the quick out-of-court settlements
that many businesses say they are pressured to make to avoid
drawn-out and expensive trials.</TE>
<TE>   Brusavich's statements mark a change for the organization. The
previous president, Robert Cartwright, said several months ago:
"Nothing's perfect in this world, but for the most part it's a good
law.... [It] protects consumers against wrongful conduct by
institutions. People who don't like to be held responsible for
tobacco, toxins or pollutants or who are perpetrating financial fraud
don't like the law."</TE>
<TE>   Should the Legislature tinker with the act, it would not be the
first time. A few years ago, lawmakers amended it to bar suits over
software packaging after the computer industry complained about
lawsuits alleging that oversized boxes misrepresent the value of
software.</TE>
<TE>   Taking the first step toward new changes in the law, Assemblyman
Lou Correa (D-Anaheim) plans to hold a Jan. 10 hearing on complaints
from business owners. He said he would propose changes to the act
based on testimony at the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to make sure we're examining the full extent of the
problem," Correa said. The law "is supposed to prevent unlawful
business practices, yet this code is being used to perpetrate
unlawful business practices by some very unscrupulous people."</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, the suits are filed on behalf of consumer groups
with close connections to the lawyers handling the suits. Although
the consumer groups can seek monetary restitution, the lawyers can
recover attorney fees from settlements.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the outcry, the Unfair Competition Act still has its
defenders. Eric V. Traut, president of the Orange County Trial
Lawyers Assn., said the law is needed because county prosecutors
don't have time to go after wrongdoing by small-business owners.</TE>
<TE>   "The law gives the little guy a lot of power to get a remedy they
wouldn't otherwise have," Traut said. "I don't think it's too broad.
In some areas it's too restrictive."</TE>

<HD>After Year of Calm, Looming War Makes U.S. Ripe for Storm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It almost seems like I'm tempting fate by bringing this up, but as
2002 turns the corner and the new year is introduced with the
drumbeat of war, I've got to ask a question.</LD>
<LD>   Was it luck, smarts, or the mercy of the gods that kept us safe
this year?</LD>
<LD>   Every time there's a suicide bombing in the Middle East or another
horrific act of terror somewhere in the world, I can't help but think
of the relative calm here at home.</LD>
<TE>   Peace has never felt so unsettling.</TE>
<TE>   If someone can strap explosives to his body and stroll unnoticed
past heavily armed soldiers in Israel, why hasn't a suicidal nut done
it in a crowded California shopping mall or at a high-profile
football game?</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, 2001, I feared that in the new world we'd have
nerve gas in the subway stations and bombs in our harbors. I wondered
if the crew that plotted to blow Los Angeles International Airport to
smithereens might only have inspired its brethren to finish the job.</TE>
<TE>   So far, it's eerily quiet. So is our security better than we might
think?</TE>
<TE>   Wouldn't that be nice.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing has happened because, most likely, terrorists have decided
it's not time yet, and that only makes the quiet more chilling.</TE>
<TE>   We're nearly as vulnerable now as we were before Sept. 11, 2001.
If you don't believe me, senior U.S. officials have admitted it's not
a question of if, but when we'll be hit again.</TE>
<TE>   If that's not spooky enough, a recent Washington Post story
reported that Cabinet members and other managers are rotating in and
out of an underground bunker, and one official said he had begun to
wonder whether it's safe to work so close to the White House.</TE>
<TE>   So what exactly do they know? And should we be building our own
bunkers?</TE>
<TE>   "You're asking the very questions that are being asked by top law
enforcement and intelligence officials around the country," says
Steven Emerson, who wrote "American Jihad: The Terrorists Living
Among Us."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anyone has the answers. The fear, of course, ranges
from the well-planned, coordinated mega-attack, to the single suicide
bomber," adds Emerson, who long before 9/11 warned that Islamic
terrorists would be gunning for America.</TE>
<TE>   In a moment of darkness, it occurred to me that there might very
well be a plan.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as the bombs start falling in Iraq, maybe we start getting
hit at home, not only as a tit for tat, but because we'd be an easier
target with our focus overseas.</TE>
<TE>   Not 10 minutes after the bombing starts, you know as well as I do
that the cockroach Osama bin Laden is going to crawl out from under a
rock and dance a jig on international television, rallying new
recruits to make war on the West.</TE>
<TE>   According to Emerson, law enforcement agencies across America are
already bracing for payback.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not based on hard-core information, but they fear an
outbreak of terrorism accompanying the invasion of Iraq," said
Emerson, who now runs the Investigative Project, a Washington
intelligence agency.</TE>
<TE>   As despicable a man as Saddam Hussein is, it's one more reason
that going after him now is not worth it. He's been contained for
years, and he can be boxed in for many more.</TE>
<TE>   If our own presidential Cabinet is hiding out in bunkers, the
smart move is to put everything into the war on terrorism, to keep
our eye on North Korea, to reconsider Arab-Israeli policy, to deliver
more economic aid and fewer soldiers to the Middle East, and to get
rid of this ridiculous campaign, run by a Madison Avenue maven, to
polish up our image abroad.</TE>
<TE>   It's our actions and policies that matter, not our words and
images.</TE>
<TE>   If all that fails, and Saddam fires up a nuke or moves on a
neighbor, then go ahead and blow his beanie all the way to
Bakersfield.</TE>
<TE>   So what can we mere mortals do while the drama plays out?</TE>
<TE>   We can keep filling up the tank, cranking the heat, and trying to
forget how much everybody hates the fat kid at the party. Or we can
recognize our own culpability. In a world of limited resources, we
keep big-footing around the planet, grabbing whatever we need to keep
us in high cotton at rock-bottom prices.</TE>
<TE>   When you make your New Year's resolutions, forget taking up yoga
or cutting out red meat. Try reading the news. Send a screaming
e-mail to your congressman. Wave a sign. Exercise your 1st Amendment
instead of your abs.</TE>
<TE>   The quiet is scary.</TE>
<TE>   Whether you're for or against the war, now is the time to
understand that every move we make will eventually be felt at home,
where it's been so, so quiet in the year 2002.</TE>

<HD>Cities Leery of 'Megan's Law' Web Site</HD>
<DH>County's version gives only a general idea of where sex
offenders live. For details, people must then visit the Sheriff's
Department.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Martelle</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County Sheriff's Department Web site designed to help
residents pinpoint neighborhoods in which convicted sex offenders
live has failed to catch on with municipal law enforcement officials,
severely limiting the amount of information available over the
Internet.</LD>
<LD>   So far, officials have signed on in only 11 of the county's 34
cities, representing less than a quarter of the county's population.
Most of cities are in the southern part of the county.</LD>
<LD>   County officials said they expect more cities to join as legal
questions are resolved.</LD>
<TE>   "Many have said they have the same questions the county had about
liability issues," said Sheriff's Capt. Ron Wilkerson, who heads the
department's Support Services Division. "They are going through their
internal processes to make sure it's the right thing for them."</TE>
<TE>   The county's largest cities -- Santa Ana and Anaheim -- have not
joined, and neither have newer, growing cities like Irvine, where
officials said they have withheld involvement because of questions
about the Web site's effectiveness and legality.</TE>
<TE>   Two cases are pending before the U.S. Supreme Court challenging
Internet posting of files from the Megan's law database -- a public
notification program named for a New Jersey child who was raped and
murdered in 1994 by a convicted sex offender in her neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the court heard arguments in cases that could shut
down programs in Alaska and Connecticut, which post names and
photographs of convicted sex offenders, even after they have served
their sentences. Critics say that practice amounts to
unconstitutional added punishment; defenders say it simply gives
quicker access to public information -- individual criminal
histories.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Web site uses a different format. It allows
people to type in an address or select a public facility, such as a
school or park, and learn whether a convicted sex offender lives in
the general area.</TE>
<TE>   The site does not offer the offender's name or address. Instead, a
user sees a map with circles representing the area in which a sex
offender lives and is told whether the offender is considered a high
risk for committing another attack.</TE>
<TE>   A user can then go to the Sheriff's Department and see the area's
Megan's law file, which includes names, photographs and details on
offenders' crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to wait and see how the Supreme Court decision comes
out, and then we'll see what our legal counsel says about whether or
not we should participate in this," said Irvine Police Sgt. Dave
Freedland.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, 30 states -- but not California -- make Megan's law
registries available to the public on Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Web site was conceived after the high-profile
kidnapping and slaying of 5-year-old Samantha Runnion in July. It was
approved by the Board of Supervisors in August, and launched Nov. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Some questioned the program then, noting that the man accused of
killing Samantha had lived nowhere near her and was not a convicted
sex offender.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim officials have not chosen to participate, partly because
of concerns that the site "would provide some people with a false
sense of security when maybe they should be concerned, and for others
it would alarm them when there is no cause for alarm," said Sgt. Rick
Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   The public has access to the Megan's law registry at police
stations in cities with populations of more than 200,000, or at
regional sheriff's department offices.</TE>

<HD>Search Expands for Pregnant Woman Missing Since Dec. 24</HD>

<LD>Volunteers continued the search Saturday for a pregnant woman who
disappeared Christmas Eve, while a reward for information leading to
her return increased to $500,000. Authorities have received more than
260 tips on a police hotline and have expanded the search to rural
areas throughout Stanislaus County.</LD>
<LD>   Another anonymous donor contributed $375,000 to a fund established
for Laci Denise Peterson, who is eight months pregnant and was last
seen at a Modesto park just before 10 a.m. on Dec. 24. Her husband,
Scott, was on a Bay Area fishing trip at the time, Modesto police
said.</LD>
<LD>   With the help of 50 volunteers, police searched Saturday in
western Stanislaus County for the 27-year-old woman. They also served
a search warrant at a warehouse used by Scott Peterson's fertilizer
business and seized his fishing boat, said Det. Doug Ridenour.</LD>
<TE>   Peterson is not considered a suspect in his wife's disappearance,
Ridenour said.</TE>

<HD>Panel Seeks Bill on Preserving Open Space</HD>
<DH>Supervisors are urged to push for legislation that would
let voters decide whether to fund a district through a sales-tax
increase.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amanda Covarrubias</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An advisory panel has asked Ventura County supervisors to push for a
new state law that would allow local voters to decide whether to
impose a 1/8-cent sales-tax increase to preserve open space.</LD>
<LD>   Money generated by the tax -- about $11.5 million a year -- would
provide funding for a proposed open-space district that would acquire
and manage undeveloped land throughout the county.</LD>
<LD>   Officials with the countywide Open Space Advisory Committee said
they have not decided how the district should be funded. They are,
however, urging supervisors to work with legislators to write a bill
that would allow the tax question to be put on the March 2004 ballot.</LD>
<TE>   Creation of the open-space district itself would also be on the
same ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't get that legislation now, it won't be open to us
later," committee co-Chairman Jim Engel said. "We want to keep our
options open."</TE>
<TE>   Counties may place a sales-tax increase of 1/4-cent or higher on a
ballot without legislative approval, but anything less must be
authorized by the Legislature. A sales-tax proposal would have to be
submitted to the state by Jan. 24 and introduced in the Legislature
by Feb. 21 to be considered for approval in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors are expected to consider the advisory committee's
request early next year, said Engel, who heads the Ojai Land
Conservancy. That nonprofit group has purchased and preserved open
space in the Ojai Valley for 16 years.</TE>
<TE>   The advisory panel also is looking at alternative ways to generate
money for the proposed district, including a so-called parcel-tax
increase. To pass, such a tax would have to be approved by a majority
of the affected property owners. A special sales-tax increase would
require approval by two-thirds of the voters.</TE>
<TE>   "The committee is not recommending at this time that your board
designate a 1/8-cent sales-tax increase as the funding measure,"
Engel and committee co-Chairman Joe Gibson said in a letter to
supervisors. "The committee continues to analyze funding options and
believes all options are still under consideration."</TE>
<TE>   While the proposed sales-tax increase would generate about $11.5
million based on figures from the 2001-02 fiscal year, the amount a
property assessment would collect is not yet known, said county
planner Debby Millais, who is working with the advisory committee to
develop an open-space district.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the funding question, voters are expected to decide
in March 2004 whether such a district should be created and how it
should be governed if formed.</TE>
<TE>   The 41-member advisory panel was so divided on the governance
issue last month that it asked the Board of Supervisors for guidance.
Supervisors suggested the committee delay an early decision on the
issue.</TE>
<TE>   Some advisory members believe the five supervisors should have
decision-making authority over the district's purse strings because
they already represent voters countywide.</TE>
<TE>   But others argue the public does not trust the county board to
spend wisely. If supervisors are put in charge, that faction says,
voters would be less willing to tax themselves to preserve open
space.</TE>
<TE>   An appointed board, or one independently elected, are better
options, argue the opponents of a supervisor-controlled board. A 2001
public-opinion survey supports that view.</TE>
<TE>   Respondents selected the Board of Supervisors as their
least-favorite choice for administering the proposed district. Those
responding in the September 2001 poll commissioned by the county said
they preferred either an elected or appointed panel.</TE>

<LD>"Bartender, a shot of Jack Daniels. And keep 'em coming."</LD>
<LD>   The man at the end of the Newport Beach bar couldn't help but
overhear the lonely figure four stools down. "Got those
end-of-the-year blues, huh?" he asked sympathetically.</LD>
<LD>   "In spades," the bourbon man said, knocking back what he fully
expected to be the first of many. "You wouldn't believe the kind of
year I had. 2002 can't end soon enough for me."</LD>
<TE>   "I hear you, my friend," the other said. "I'm not looking for a
contest, but I doubt your year was any worse than mine."</TE>
<TE>   "Well, let me buy you a drink, and we'll see about that. What'll
you have?"</TE>
<TE>   "Just a ginger ale, thanks."</TE>
<TE>   "That's no way to forget your troubles, but have it your way. OK,
you go first."</TE>
<TE>   No Mo</TE>
<TE>   "Would you believe Mo Vaughn was a neighbor of mine until the
Angels traded him? All because of that, I put him on my Fantasy
League baseball team, and the guy stunk up the joint."</TE>
<TE>   "That's it? Listen to this: I was an Angels' season ticket holder
for 28 years -- until last winter when I gave them up."</TE>
<TE>   "You got me there."</TE>
<TE>   "It gets worse. The only reason I gave up my Angels tickets was so
I could buy Lakers tickets this season."</TE>
<TE>   "Ouch. Let me buy the next round. OK, how does this sound: I voted
for Tony Rackauckas for district attorney and convinced my friends to
do the same. Now they won't speak to me."</TE>
<TE>   "Big deal. I had to give a testimonial for the guy at a black-tie
dinner last summer. Within six months, he'd been chastised by the
county grand jury, the state attorney general and the county auditor.
He's been examined more often than a dead frog in a ninth-grade
biology class."</TE>
<TE>   "Got me again, but try this on for size. I lived next door to
Tawny Kitaen and Chuck Finley for six months. Had to listen to all
their ruckuses. What a pair."</TE>
<TE>   "Normally, I'd feel sorry for you, but you won't believe this.
After they separated, I was surfing the Web to meet somebody online.
I wound up on a blind date with Tawny. She spent the whole night
telling me how much she hated left-handed pitchers."</TE>
<TE>   "Brother, you have had an incredible year. What'd you do to
deserve such a string of luck?"</TE>
<TE>   Hard Luck</TE>
<TE>   "You tell me," he said, before ordering his third Jack. "But I'm
just getting going. After waiting since I was a teenager for four
other cousins to die off, this was the year I was going to get the
summer rental cottage at Crystal Cove. I got the contract to print up
the 'Tom Coad for Supervisor' bumper stickers. I had an 'Eat Free

<HD>Floats May Be Priced Out of Pasadena</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>During these days between Christmas and the New Year, thousands of
people line up on Raymond Avenue in Pasadena to tour the Rose Palace
parade float barn -- and unwittingly to witness what may be the end
of an era.</LD>
<LD>   The Rose Palace, a city-owned facility, is the only place in
Pasadena where floats are still built. It may prove to be the last. A
confluence of factors -- from a rise in the rent on the building to
its location in the midst of a city redevelopment zone -- is forcing
parade organizers to consider relocating construction of floats out
of the Rose Palace. And that, in turn, has raised this once
unthinkable prospect:</LD>
<LD>   Soon, no Rose Parade floats may be built in Pasadena.</LD>
<TE>   To longtime parade fans, such a possibility might seem like
Switzerland without clockmakers. But it is in keeping with the
changing relationship between Pasadena and the Tournament of Roses,
the not-for-profit organization that puts on the parade and Rose
Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Once so close that Pasadena City Council members were generally
granted Tournament of Roses membership, relations, while cordial, are
now more formal and distant.</TE>
<TE>   Contacts between Pasadena and the parade that made it famous are
governed by a 72-page master agreement that treats the city as
landlord and the parade as tenant. Unlike competing New Year's
festivals in Miami and New Orleans, the Tournament of Roses receives
no public subsidy to tie it to its hometown.</TE>
<TE>   Already, more than half of the parade floats are built in
tournament-owned barns in Duarte and Azusa. And nearly two-thirds of
the tournament's volunteers -- the white-suiters who are famous
parade-day ambassadors for the city -- live outside Pasadena,
according to its roster.</TE>
<TE>   This fall, the future of the Rose Palace facility has emerged as
the latest sign of separation. According to public documents, the
city will soon raise the rent from $87,600 to $209,315 annually. City
officials say the increase reflects market rates; parade officials
say such a steep hike could eventually leave them little choice but
to end their Rose Palace lease and find another place for building
floats. Given rising property values in Pasadena, finding large and
affordable warehouse space would be difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "Would we like to stay in Pasadena? Absolutely. But clearly in the
long run, we're being priced out of this place," said Scott Jenkins,
a lawyer who represents the tournament and also is a high-ranking
volunteer member. "From my personal perspective, I think the city is
trying to give us incentive to move on."</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins said the city and the tournament continue to cooperate
closely in handling security and operations of the parade. But
financially and legally, "the relationship is more arm's length than
it was before."</TE>
<TE>   For much of its history, the Rose Parade was largely run by the
city fathers, who were eager to attract residents and visitors by
showing off the warm winter weather. As a matter of self-interest,
city leaders were more willing to join the tournament, pay its
membership dues and volunteer time during the holidays for the glory
of Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   With such overlap between city and parade officials, the
relationship was informal. The bylaws of the Pasadena Tournament of
Roses Assn. say only that the parade operations should be
headquartered "at any place within the State of California."</TE>
<TE>   But in the second half of the 20th century, the tournament's
membership remained mostly white and conservative, even as Pasadena
became more diverse. A decade ago, after a furor over the selection
of a descendant of Christopher Columbus as grand marshal for the 1992
parade, local activists and a young mayor criticized the tournament's
lack of racial diversity and scrutinized its relationship with City
Hall.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, under pressure, the tournament made two fundamental
changes. It altered its leadership structure to allow women and
members of minority groups a shorter path to its executive committee.
And it entered into a detailed master agreement with the city
government.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement established a schedule of rents that the tournament
would pay for use of city-owned facilities, from the Rose Palace and
the Rose Bowl to the tournament headquarters on Orange Grove. It
spelled out a variety of other fees, totaling more than $1 million
annually, to cover the costs of the parade. It also required that
annual operating profits be shared with the city. And, to the
annoyance of some tournament rank-and-file members who must scramble
for extra tickets, the document granted the city extensive ticket
rights for both the parade (2,100 seats) and the game (1,200).</TE>
<TE>   Since its adoption eight years ago, the agreement has drawn
bitter, if private, criticism from some tournament volunteers, who
complain that city political leaders are more interested in
collecting money and tickets than in the health of the parade.</TE>
<TE>   The organization's most recently available tax records, for the
years 1996 to 2001, show the tournament is hardly a financial
colossus. The tournament has annual revenue of about $8 million, much
of it from the game, which is used to subsidize the money-losing
parade. The tournament's chief executive officer, Mitch Dorger, makes
$173,639; he is one of only two employees who make more than
$100,000, tax records indicate. Net operating profits have been
small, topping out in 2000 at $381,000.</TE>
<TE>   Those finances, combined with the newer master agreement, leave
the tournament less flexibility in dealing with rising rents and land
prices in Pasadena. Rather than rent more Pasadena facilities to
build floats, the tournament itself now owns large warehouse sites
for float building and storage east of Pasadena, in relatively less
expensive areas of Azusa and Duarte. (The well-known Rosemont
Pavilion in Pasadena, also a city facility rented by the tournament,
can be used for decorating floats but not building them.)</TE>
<TE>   Among parade insiders, speculation is rampant that Rose Palace
float construction could move east in the next few years. The city's
decision to double the rent is only one indicator.</TE>
<TE>   City officials say they are eyeing the building for redevelopment
as part of a new technology corridor. The Rose Palace is an
attractive site because it is close to the Huntington Memorial
Hospital, a new campus for Art Center College of Design and a station
for the coming Gold Line trains to downtown L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "That area is promising for redevelopment, and float building --
even though it's important to the city -- is not the highest and best
use for that area," said Eric Duyshart, Pasadena's economic
development manager.</TE>
<TE>   CL Keedy, the Tournament vice president who handles real estate
issues, cautioned that there has been no official decision to leave
the Rose Palace and that "we won't exclude Pasadena or any other
city" if a replacement must be found.</TE>
<TE>   Duyshart said the city has already tried to help the tournament
find alternative sites in Pasadena. But the cost of Pasadena real
estate, combined with the need for a float warehouse as large as
50,000 square feet, has stymied the search.</TE>
<TE>   "Float-building is not a great fit for the land values in
Pasadena," Duyshart said.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the Rose Palace, float builder Bill Lofthouse said he has
had little word on the future of the building.</TE>
<TE>   As owner of Phoenix Decorating, Lofthouse subleases the building
from the tournament, which rents it from the city. As the last
Pasadena float builder, he is an unofficial ambassador for the event,
and treasures his location as a place to meet visiting dignitaries
and talk about the art of float building.</TE>
<TE>   But as the parade's largest float builder, he would welcome a new,
larger facility. At the Rose Palace, he built 25 of the 54 floats for
the 2003 parade. The 25,000-square-foot space allows him to have only
eight floats on the construction floor at one time. He would prefer a
new 50,000-square-foot facility.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to leave the city," he said. "But something will
have to happen, and I don't know what it will be. Wherever we end up
going, it's going to be hard to stay in Pasadena."</TE>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>James "Fred" Buck, 72, an engineer for General Electric who evaluated
lighting systems for major league baseball stadiums, died Wednesday
of pancreatic cancer at a hospice in Cleveland.</LD>
<LD>   Buck began evaluating and recommending the proper lighting in
major league parks in 1962 at the request of the American League.</LD>
<LD>   Initially, he taught several retired umpires to use light meters
for measurements. In 1982, he personally took over field testing.</LD>
<TE>   Buck also taught retired major league players to take light
readings in minor league parks.</TE>
<TE>   "He would check for the brightness, and the lighting fixtures
would have to be aimed in certain ways to minimize glare for the
ballplayers," said Ralph Kaiser, a retired GE lighting engineer who
knew Buck.</TE>
<TE>   Before joining GE in 1954, Buck was an Army sergeant during the
Korean War, where he won the Bronze Star.</TE>
<TE>   After retiring in 1987, he continued to examine stadium lighting
for major league baseball.</TE>

<HD>Performing Arts Venue Now Winning Ovations</HD>
<DH>Critics said Thousand Oaks complex would sink the city in
debt. But eight years after opening, the $86-million facility
continues to lure big crowds.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than a decade ago, plans to build the largest regional
performing arts center between Los Angeles and San Francisco shook
the city of Thousand Oaks to its core.</LD>
<LD>   Critics warned the $86-million project would sink the city into
debt, open the floodgates to traffic and stand as a concrete eyesore
on the edge of the Ventura Freeway. Petitions were filed, recalls
launched, angry words exchanged.</LD>
<LD>   But eight years after the imposing monument to culture and civic
pride opened its doors on Thousand Oaks Boulevard, the naysayers
largely stand corrected.</LD>
<TE>   Millions of dollars in loans have been repaid to various city
sources, the 1,800-seat main hall continues to attract large
audiences, and local performers delight in showcasing their talent at
the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's been a cultural benefit. Everything I've read says
attendance is good," said former Councilwoman Elois Zeanah, one of
the project's fiercest critics and who still holds some reservations
about the Civic Arts Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the plaza's most important legacy is how it helped the
38-year-old city become a self-contained municipality that doesn't
rely on others to fill its needs, said longtime supporter and former
Councilman Frank Schillo, now a county supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the central focus for the arts in this community, and it
shows we're not tied in any way, shape or form to Los Angeles
County," said Schillo, who used to drive south to see plays. "We're a
complete city."</TE>
<TE>   The transformation has been so complete that 2 million people from
the Conejo Valley and beyond have paid from $8 to $100 a ticket to
see shows at the Civic Arts Plaza since its premiere performance Oct.
21, 1994, when entertainer Bernadette Peters took the main stage.</TE>
<TE>   Although early projections said attendance would hit 1 million in
five years, it accomplished that goal in three, said theaters
director Tom Mitze, who manages the 1,800-seat Kavli Theater and
400-seat Scherr Forum.</TE>
<TE>   People are drawn to the wide mix of programs designed to appeal to
mainstream tastes, from touring productions of Broadway blockbusters
"Cats" and "Miss Saigon" to the less-renowned but equally intriguing
Shanghai Ballet, Mitze said.</TE>
<TE>   Crowds also turn out to see local companies such as the Channel
Islands Ballet, Santa Susana Repertory and the New West Symphony, the
Civic Arts Plaza's resident orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   "We listen to what the public says, and they say they want
family-oriented entertainment," Mitze said. "Just about everyone I
talk to says they're so grateful they don't have to drive to Los
Angeles to see a show."</TE>
<TE>   The two theaters operate on a $3-million annual budget generated
by rental fees, concessions and other sources, including a $250,000
annual gift from the nonprofit Alliance for the Arts.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1999, the city's General Fund has contributed $250,000 a
year to the theaters to cover the cost of services provided by other
departments. In addition to the alliance's hefty contribution --
generated by interest on a $3-million endowment -- Friends of the
Civic Arts Plaza supplies hundreds of volunteers who serve as ushers
during performances.</TE>
<TE>   "We are one of the only public theaters in the nation running in
the black," said former Councilwoman Linda Parks, who was elected
after the plaza was already in operation.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Civic Arts Plaza was built, detractors warned that its
tangled financing would plunge the city into insolvency. Because some
deals for funding fell through, officials led by then-Mayor Alex
Fiore sunk the downtown Redevelopment Agency heavily into debt to
realize their dream.</TE>
<TE>   The agency issued $28 million in bonds and borrowed $19 million
from at least 10 city accounts to build the $64-million complex and
buy the $22-million, 22-acre site.</TE>
<TE>   Most severely depleted were the insurance reserve and fixed-asset
replacement funds. One covers liability in court cases; the other
replaces worn-out city equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the Redevelopment Agency has repaid all but $1.6
million of the internal loans, said Candis Hong, the city's finance
director. The remainder is owed to fixed-asset replacement and is
scheduled to be repaid by 2010, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The outstanding bond debt is being repaid at a rate of $1.8
million a year with a payoff scheduled in 2025, Hong said.</TE>
<TE>   Because the theaters do not turn a profit, the money to pay back
the debt comes from property taxes generated by the downtown
redevelopment district, Hong said.</TE>
<TE>   But longtime detractors say the dollars lavished on the 10-story,
modernist structure they consider an eyesore could have been better
spent on parks, streets and acquiring open space than on city
leaders' "ego project."</TE>
<TE>   Zeanah and other critics said they supported the idea of a
community theater, but contend the Civic Arts Plaza was too
extravagant and that Thousand Oaks did not need a new city hall.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the steel and concrete building clashed with the
overall look of the low-slung city with its open ridgelines and
unobstructed views.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not like the design, and I still don't," Zeanah said. "I
think it's atrocious. I'm embarrassed every time I drive by on the
freeway. It was the officials and the politicians and their
supporters who wanted it the way they wanted it, and they didn't want
any public interference."</TE>
<TE>   Others were not so thrilled by the dull-brown rectangle of copper
strips adorning the freeway side of the building. The abstract
sculpture created an uproar in the community, with some armchair art
critics complaining it resembled solar panels or a giant radiator
grille stuck on the concrete wall.</TE>
<TE>   So fierce was opposition to the project that activists tried to
recall Fiore, who died in January, and Schillo. Together with former
Councilwoman Judy Lazar, they formed a powerful triumvirate.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel they really ramrodded it through," Zeanah said.</TE>
<TE>   After the complex was erected, the recall efforts faded. "It was
very important for us to try to do what was right," said former
critic Lori Kissinger, a Thousand Oaks reading specialist who
sometimes takes her students to children's programs at the plaza.
"After 10 years, the passion dies down."</TE>
<TE>   But Zeanah said the financial fallout lives on through the city's
annual subsidy and in the building's second elevator added last year.
The elevator's total price tag grew to more than $1 million because
of cost overruns. The subsidy is expected to climb to $394,000 this
year and $416,500 in 2002-03.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing you can do now is to keep city officials from
giving rosy financial projections," Zeanah said. "It's been
constructed, but the cost is still going up."</TE>
<TE>   Critics also cite the "sweetheart deal" struck two years ago with
Caruso Affiliated Holdings Inc. to develop the 10 acres next to the
Civic Arts Plaza. Part of the original 22-acre site, the parcel was
envisioned by Schillo and Fiore as the future home of a shopping and
entertainment complex that would help revitalize aging Thousand Oaks
Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Several plans fell through over the years, and the property's
future now rests with Los Angeles Police Commissioner Rick Caruso and
his Santa Monica-based development company. Caruso's $40-million
proposal for the Civic Arts Plaza includes a 12-screen movie theater,
several restaurants and retail stores, a three-story office building
and a 1 1/2-acre lake that would morph into an ice-skating rink in
winter. The city has pledged $12.2 million in redevelopment funds
toward the project.</TE>

<HD>Arts Plaza Wins Ovations</HD>
<DH>Critics said it would fail, but the Thousand Oaks facility
continues to lure big audiences.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>More than a decade ago, plans to build the largest regional
performing arts center between Los Angeles and San Francisco shook
the city of Thousand Oaks to its core.</LD>
<LD>   Critics warned the $86-million project would sink the city into
debt, open the floodgates to traffic and stand as a concrete eyesore
on the edge of the Ventura Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   Petitions were filed, recalls launched, angry words exchanged.</LD>
<TE>   But eight years after the imposing monument to culture and civic
pride opened its doors on Thousand Oaks Boulevard, the naysayers
largely stand corrected.</TE>
<TE>   Millions of dollars in loans have been repaid to various city
sources, the 1,800-seat main hall continues to attract large
audiences, and local performers delight in showcasing their talent at
the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's been a cultural benefit. Everything I've read says
attendance is good," said former Councilwoman Elois Zeanah, one of
the project's fiercest critics and who still holds some reservations
about the Civic Arts Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the Arts Plaza's most important legacy is how it helped
the 38-year-old city become a self-contained municipality that
doesn't rely on others to fill its needs, said longtime supporter and
former City Councilman Frank Schillo, now a county supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the central focus for the arts in this community, and it
shows we're not tied in any way, shape or form to Los Angeles
County," said Schillo, who used to drive south to see plays. "We're a
complete city."</TE>
<TE>   The transformation has been so complete that 2 million people from
the Conejo Valley and beyond have paid from $8 to $100 a ticket to
see shows at the Civic Arts Plaza since its premiere performance Oct.
21, 1994, when entertainer Bernadette Peters took the main stage.</TE>
<TE>   Although early projections said attendance would hit 1 million in
five years, it accomplished that goal in three, said theaters
director Tom Mitze, who manages the 1,800-seat Kavli Theater and
400-seat Scherr Forum.</TE>
<TE>   People are drawn to the wide mix of programs that are designed to
appeal to mainstream tastes, from touring productions of Broadway
blockbusters "Cats" and "Miss Saigon" to the less-renowned but
equally intriguing Shanghai Ballet, Mitze said.</TE>
<TE>   Crowds also turn out to see local companies such as the Channel
Islands Ballet, Santa Susana Repertory and the New West Symphony, the
Civic Arts Plaza's resident orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   "We listen to what the public says, and they say they want
family-oriented entertainment," Mitze said. "Just about everyone I
talk to says they're so grateful they don't have to drive to Los
Angeles to see a show."</TE>
<TE>   Production companies and sponsoring organizations pay rental fees
of $420 a day for the smaller venue and $1,890 for the larger one.</TE>
<TE>   The two theaters operate on a $3-million annual budget generated
by rental fees, concessions and other sources, including a $250,000
annual gift from nonprofit Alliance for the Arts.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1999, the city's General Fund has contributed $250,000 a
year to the theaters to cover the cost of services provided by other
departments, such as payroll processing by the Finance Department.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the comparably sized Cerritos Center for the
Performing Arts in southern Los Angeles County receives a city
subsidy of about $2 million a year to keep its $8.7-million operation
afloat, said Laurie Kajiwara, a spokeswoman for the city of Cerritos.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the alliance's hefty contribution -- generated by
interest on a $3-million endowment -- Friends of the Civic Arts Plaza
supplies hundreds of volunteers who serve as ushers during
performances.</TE>
<TE>   "We are one of the only public theaters in the nation running in
the black," said former Councilwoman Linda Parks, who was elected
after the plaza was built. "It shows that Thousand Oaks is
exceptional in its volunteers and in its public. There's incredible
numbers of people willing to give up their time and money to help run
it."</TE>
<TE>   Before the Civic Arts Plaza was built, detractors warned its
tangled financing would plunge the city into insolvency.</TE>
<TE>   Because some deals for funding fell through, officials led by
former Mayor Alex Fiore sunk the downtown Redevelopment Agency
heavily into debt to realize their dream.</TE>
<TE>   The agency issued $28 million in bonds and borrowed $19 million
from at least 10 city accounts to build the $64-million complex and
buy the $22-million, 22-acre site.</TE>
<TE>   Most severely depleted were the insurance reserve and fixed-asset
replacement funds. One covers liability in court cases, the other
replaces worn-out city equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the Redevelopment Agency has repaid all but $1.6
million of the internal loans, said Candis Hong, the city's finance
director. The remainder is owed to fixed-asset replacement and is
scheduled to be repaid by 2010, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The outstanding bond debt is being repaid at a rate of $1.8
million a year with a payoff date scheduled in 2025, Hong said.</TE>
<TE>   Because the theaters do not turn a profit, the money to pay back
the debt comes from property taxes generated by the downtown
redevelopment district, Hong said.</TE>
<TE>   But longtime detractors say the dollars lavished on the 10-story,
modernist structure they consider an eyesore could have been better
spent on parks, streets and acquiring open space than on city
leaders' "ego project."</TE>
<TE>   Zeanah and other critics said they supported the idea of a
community theater, but contend the Civic Arts Plaza was too
extravagant and that Thousand Oaks did not need a new city hall.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the steel and concrete building clashed with the
overall look of the low-slung city with its open ridgelines and
unobstructed views.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not like the design, and I still don't," Zeanah said. "I
think it's atrocious. I'm embarrassed every time I drive by on the
freeway.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the officials and the politicians and their supporters who
wanted it the way they wanted it, and they didn't want any public
interference."</TE>
<TE>   Others were not so thrilled by the dull-brown rectangle of copper
strips adorning the freeway side of the building. The abstract
sculpture created an uproar in the community, with some armchair art
critics complaining it resembled solar panels or a giant radiator
grille stuck on the concrete wall.</TE>
<TE>   So fierce was opposition to the project that activists tried to
recall Fiore, who died in January, and Schillo. Together with former
Councilwoman Judy Lazar, they formed a powerful triumvirate.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel they really ramrodded it through," Zeanah said.</TE>
<TE>   After the complex was erected, the recall efforts faded. "It was
very important for us to try to do what was right," said former
critic Lori Kissinger, a Thousand Oaks reading specialist who
sometimes takes her students to children's programs at the plaza.</TE>
<TE>   "After 10 years, the passion dies down," Kissinger said.</TE>
<TE>   But Zeanah said the financial fallout lives on through the city's
annual subsidy and in the building's second elevator added last
year). The elevator's total price tag grew to more than $1 million
because of cost overruns. The subsidy is expected to climb to
$394,000 this year and $416,500 in 2002-03.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing you can do now is to keep city officials from
giving rosy financial projections," Zeanah said. "It's been
constructed, but the cost is still going up."</TE>
<TE>   After the plaza was built, it began leaking during rainstorms, and
the beige concrete exterior became discolored and cracked.</TE>
<TE>   The city sued 17 parties, including several construction companies
involved in building the structure. The city eventually won a
$6.9-million settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The first phase of work to fix the structural and aesthetic damage
is underway.</TE>
<TE>   Critics also cite the "sweetheart deal" struck two years ago with
Caruso Affiliated Holdings Inc. to develop the 10 acres next to the
Civic Arts Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the original 22-acre site, the parcel was envisioned by
Schillo and Fiore as the future home of a shopping and entertainment
complex that would help revitalize aging Thousand Oaks Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Several plans fell through over the years, and the property's
future now rests with Los Angeles Police Commissioner Rick Caruso.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso's Santa Monica-based development company boasts a long list
of shopping and retail complexes, from the Grove at Farmers Market in
Los Angeles to the Westlake Promenade and the Calabasas Commons.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso's $40-million proposal for the Civic Arts Plaza includes a
12-screen movie theater, several restaurants and retail stores, a
three-story office building and a 1 1/2-acre lake that would morph
into an ice-skating rink in winter.</TE>
<TE>   The city has pledged $12.2 million in redevelopment funds toward
the project.</TE>
<TE>   Despite lingering ill feelings, Schillo said the Arts Plaza is
fulfilling its promise to give local residents a place to enjoy
high-quality entertainment, for community groups to stage their shows
and for children to learn how art can enrich their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Every day from his first-floor office at the Arts Plaza, Schillo
can see yellow school buses lined up, bearing youngsters eager to
experience the wonders of the stage -- a live symphony orchestra or a
drama unfolding before their impressionable eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives them an exposure and a feeling that 'I'm comfortable
with the arts,' " Schillo said.</TE>
<TE>   "And maybe someday they'll be coming to the theater and buying
tickets."</TE>

<HD>Student Chefs Seek Taste of Fame</HD>
<DH>More foodies are going to culinary school, but many
students want more than just a job -- they want to be stars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Pierson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wolfgang Puck laughs when he recalls how a date abandoned him on a
Beverly Hills dance floor 25 years ago after he told her he was a
"cook."</LD>
<LD>   Of course, that was before he became a celebrity chef, one who
helped popularize haute cuisine in America by turning Spago into a
brand name and a Hollywood hangout.</LD>
<LD>   Then came the Food Network and a generous helping of spinoff books
and magazines that further elevated cooking from a casual hobby to a
glamorous profession in which the biggest stars are often male chefs,
like Puck, Michael Lomonaco or Emeril Lagasse.</LD>
<TE>   Spurred by this hip kitchen culture, a new and ambitious
generation of foodies is flocking to culinary schools with an
appetite for big-time success. For many, the aim is not only a
high-paying job, but also fame. "It used to be that if a young person
were going to culinary school, it would be tantamount to running off
to join the circus," said Eileen Opatut, senior vice president of
programming and production at the Food Network. "It's now a highly
sought, competitive career."</TE>
<TE>   The number of culinary programs that offer certificates or
associate's and bachelor's degrees has shot up 60% in the last five
years, from 269 nationwide to 431, according to Shaw Guides Inc.,
which publishes education information.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1994, the California School of Culinary Arts in Pasadena has
grown from 16 students at one site to 1,200 students at four
locations. Tuition runs about $35,000 for the 15-month program at the
school, which is part of the Cordon Bleu network of international
culinary studies.</TE>
<TE>   Student Vanessa Iantorno, 20, a devotee of the Food Network and
the Discovery Channel's cooking programs, said her dream is to become
an executive chef with her own cooking show -- but with a slight
twist.</TE>
<TE>   She wants to sing.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't sound as far-fetched as it would have a decade ago.
After all, Lagasse holds food concerts in which he cooks backed by a
jazz-rock band.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you acquire the skills, you can do anything you want, if you
put your mind to it," Iantorno said.</TE>
<TE>   Marvin David, a 24-year-old Filipino American student, said Asian
celebrity chefs such as Ming Tsai and the campy Japanese show, "Iron
Chef," inspired him to enroll in culinary school and pursue opening a
Pacific Rim fusion restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   "I had always toyed with the idea of being a chef," said David,
who has applied for an internship at the Playboy Mansion. "Television
fueled the fire."</TE>
<TE>   Kyle Connaughton, head chef at the school's restaurant, said the
influence that the media has had on his students cannot be
underestimated. But that influence has been good and bad, he said.
His biggest concern is that television makes the cooking life look
all too easy.</TE>
<TE>   "The generation before had to seek out information about [renowned
chefs] Alice Waters and Jeremiah Towers," said Connaughton, a former
pastry chef at Spago. "Now they're presented with celebrities on TV
and over the Internet. They're able to draw more of a learning
experience, but it also gives them an unrealistic look at what the
industry is like."</TE>
<TE>   Christy Yoo, 21, said roughly a quarter of the people who started
classes with her at the California School of Culinary Arts dropped
out because TV gave them the wrong impression.</TE>
<TE>   "The media has a very big impact, especially on young people," Yoo
said. "Everybody wants to be famous."</TE>
<TE>   But the road from cook to executive chef is arduous.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say only a small percentage of talented graduates will end
up in fine dining, let alone on television. The lucky ones will land
jobs in mid-range hotels, cafeterias, cruise ships and restaurant
chains.</TE>
<TE>   Others will end up in low-level positions where the pay can run as
little as $30,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   "Not many people are going to come straight out of school and come
work at Spago or Chinois [on Main]," said Puck, referring to two of
his gourmet restaurants. "But I think restaurants like the Cheesecake
Factory and Houston's -- casual dining -- will be very happy with the
graduates."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Bracken, executive chef at the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly
Hills, said he is weary of those whose ambition exceeds their talent.
He tells the story of a recent culinary school graduate who applied
to be a sous chef -- the second-in-command chef -- but had yet to
spend a day on the line preparing hot food.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a medical student wanting to perform cardiovascular
surgery," Bracken said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the number of student applicants continues to climb, as the
culinary industry continues to grow. Restaurant sales are projected
to reach a record $426.1 billion in 2003, up 4.5% from this year,
according to the National Restaurant Assn. That would represent the
12th consecutive year of growth.</TE>
<TE>   As the business grows, so does the number of jobs. Restaurants
employed 11.3 million workers in 2000, the most recent figures
available, an analysis of Bureau of Labor statistics shows. Overall,
California added 32,500 jobs in the food and beverage business sector
during that period, a 3.6% increase from the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   The profile of culinary students is also changing. In recent
years, most applicants were older, second-career types. But that is
no longer the case.</TE>
<TE>   Some schools said that a large percentage of their students are
right out of high school. At the California Culinary Academy in San
Francisco, enrollment has doubled to 1,200 in the last two years,
largely from an influx of teenagers, inspired in part by television.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our largest population," said David Chomsky, the school's
director of education. "I would attribute that growth to celebrity
status. It's now an appealing job to kids in high school."</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the country, the culinary program at Johnson &amp; Wales
University has reached capacity at all five of its campuses,
officials said. Based in Rhode Island, the school offers a
military-like regimen that requires students to rise at 6:15 a.m. and
follow strict uniform guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   But officials there caution that students should take a realistic
view of their career path and not be seduced by what they see on TV.
Too many students are unprepared for the years of hard work --
sometimes in unglamorous settings -- that it often takes to become a
top-flight chef.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not graduating chefs," said Steve Shipley, the school's
assistant director of culinary education. "We're graduating
food-service workers. You have to pay your dues before you become an
executive chef."</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the Food Network -- which is jointly owned by
Scripps Howard and Tribune Co., parent company of The Times -- said
they don't want to mislead people about the profession and its
hardships.</TE>
<TE>   All their featured chefs have established themselves in the
industry before appearing on camera, they said. Even one of the
channel's brightest young stars, 27-year-old Jamie Oliver, started as
a child working in his dad's pub in England before moving on to
traditional training.</TE>
<TE>   But Food Network officials also know that the journey to chefdom
makes for good TV. Edison Mays Jr. is one of a handful of budding
chefs at the Art Institute of California-Los Angeles being followed
by camera crews from the cable channel's reality series "Cooking
School."</TE>
<TE>   He also cooked food for a program on KCAL-TV Channel 9 and is
scheduled to cook for a show on SoapNet. He wants to own a
"comfort-food" restaurant grounded in the French techniques he's
garnering in school.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I'm caught up in this wave of attention," said Mays,
26. "This work is nothing like you see on TV. It's not like Emeril
saying, 'Bam!' It's about physical ability, punctuality and
satisfaction."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, professional cooks are quick to remind the younger set
that they often work 12-hour days, six days a week, in oppressively
hot kitchens. They warn that professional cooking in a real-life
kitchen environment, with all the work-day pressures, doesn't much
resemble the relaxed atmosphere of a TV show.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a desk job," said Mark Peel, co-owner and head chef of
the restaurant Campanile in Hollywood. Peel did not attend culinary
school but 24 years ago was sent by former boss Puck to France for an
apprenticeship.</TE>
<TE>   "My very first job in Paris, I had to reach in and gut recently
plucked, still-warm ducks before my very first cup of coffee."</TE>
<TE>   For all the positive influence that cooking shows have had on the
industry, school officials said it's important for young people to
know that their chances of superstardom are slim.</TE>
<TE>   "It's dangerous to be too ambitious, whether you're talking about
being a chef or someone inspired by Tiger Woods or Michael Jordan to
pursue sports," said Mark Erickson, vice president of the Culinary
Institute of America, which has campuses in California and New York.</TE>
<TE>   "On one hand, it's great to have those goals and to recognize the
dedication and intense amount of work it requires. But these vaulted
positions are reserved for the very few."</TE>

<HD>Heavy Snow Hits the Sierra</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A powerful storm dumped heavy snow in the Sierra Nevada, triggering
car accidents and shutting down roads to Lake Tahoe.</LD>
<LD>   Several locations on Interstate 80 and U.S. Highway 50 near
Placerville, Calif., were closed late Saturday afternoon because of
snowfall, according to the California Highway Patrol.</LD>
<LD>   "It's totally nasty," said Kathi Scott of the Kingvale Shell
Station west of Donner Summit. "It's coming down in bundles. Even
four-wheel-drives are having trouble. It's a good day to stay
inside."</LD>
<TE>   Authorities urged motorists to wait until the storm passed before
heading up to the ski resorts.</TE>
<TE>   A winter storm warning from Yosemite to Kings Canyon remains in
effect until this morning, with 1 to 2 feet of snow expected above
7,000 feet. Snow was also expected in Reno and other valley floors of
northwest Nevada, according to the National Weather Service.</TE>
<TE>   The blast of snow comes after a series of storms earlier that
dropped more than 10 feet of snow in the Sierra.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not as strong as the storms of two weeks ago, but certainly
it's another potent front coming through," said forecaster Roger
Lamoni.</TE>
<TE>   High winds in Reno on Saturday caused scattered power failures and
some property damage, authorities said. Gusts of more than 100 mph
were reported on the Sierra crest. "It certainly exacerbated some
damage from two weeks ago," Lamoni said.</TE>
<TE>   Forecasters expected a temporary return to dry weather this
afternoon before more rain or snow hits the area Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   "New Year's Eve and New Year's Day look like they'll have pretty
nice weather," Lamoni said.</TE>

<HD>Tape of Teen Assault Suspect Inadmissible</HD>
<DH>Judge says the girl, accused of threatening an officer with
a knife, had asserted her right to remain silent in the second
interview.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandra Murillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some tape-recorded statements made by a 14-year-old girl shot by a
police officer in May will not be admissible in court, a Superior
Court judge has ruled.</LD>
<LD>   The decision by Judge Herbert Curtis III concerned a tape-recorded
interview in which the girl tells detectives three times that she
does not want to talk to them.</LD>
<LD>   The girl is on trial on suspicion of felony assault of an officer
during a brief confrontation in her Ventura foster home. She
allegedly threatened Officer Kristen Rupp with a knife.</LD>
<TE>   Rupp shot the girl several times after she refused to drop the
knife, the officer testified last week.</TE>
<TE>   Police interviewed the girl twice after the shooting. The first
interview was within an hour of the shooting, and Curtis has said
that interview is admissible because the girl agreed to speak with
detectives and was read her Miranda rights.</TE>
<TE>   But the second interview, conducted after the girl's surgery, was
inadmissible because the girl said she didn't want to talk and
therefore asserted her right to remain silent, Curtis said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the minor pretty much made it clear she didn't want to
talk," Curtis said, explaining that the suspect was groggy from
surgery and did not knowingly waive her Miranda rights.</TE>
<TE>   On the second tape, the girl tells detectives she came toward an
officer with a knife because she "wanted to die." On the first tape,
she tells officers she was trying to drop the knife when Rupp began
firing.</TE>

<KH>L.A. THEN AND NOW</KH>
<HD>Rose Queens Have Come a Long Way Since 1930</HD>
<DH>Nowadays, the honoree and her court get the royal
treatment. But it wasn't always a position with perks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Cecilia Rasmussen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pasadena's New Year's Day parade was a simple affair when Holly
Halsted Balthis reigned as queen of the 1930 Tournament of Roses.</LD>
<LD>   Nowadays the Rose Queen and her court are driven to hundreds of
events and receive lavish designer wardrobes, beauty makeovers,
etiquette training, speech coaching, dry-cleaning, portraiture and
teeth whitening on the scale of a Hollywood production.</LD>
<LD>   But 70-plus years ago, Balthis helped decorate the float on which
she would ride, using asparagus ferns and home-grown roses. She was
given all of $10 to buy lengths of lace and eggshell satin and to
hire a dressmaker to make her dress. That was it -- no frills. She
wore no crown atop her bobbed brown hair, which she styled herself
for the big morning. Eventually, her parade dress became her bridal
gown.</LD>
<TE>   But Balthis doesn't begrudge the modern perquisites. "It's great
what the girls get today," she said. "I'm all for it."</TE>
<TE>   Rose Queens were an on-and-off thing: Some early parades had them,
some didn't. Not until Balthis reigned on New Year's Day 1930 did
there begin an unbroken line of Rose Queens. Balthis, now 94, also
holds the distinction of being the oldest living Rose Queen.</TE>
<TE>   She was born Holly Halsted in Pasadena in 1908, in a house at the
same fashionable Granite Drive address where actress-pop singer
Jennifer Lopez's new eatery, Madre's, now stands. Before that, the
address was known to Pasadenans as that of the Chronicle restaurant,
which was built on the site of Balthis' parents' Craftsman cottage.</TE>
<TE>   "My grandparents owned a fish market at the corner of Fair Oaks
and Colorado," she said. "That was when Old Town was new."</TE>
<TE>   An education major at UCLA, Balthis was working full time in the
Tournament of Roses' public relations department when the honor came
her way.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the Depression years, and I would go to school a semester
and then work a semester in order to be able to continue with my
education," she said. "I made $135 per month, which was a really good
salary then. We shared an office with the Pasadena Chamber of
Commerce, across the street from the Green Hotel."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike young women today, who compete by the hundreds and appear
before a committee of judges, she did not try out for Rose Queen. "I
was chosen because I worked for the tournament for several years and
knew the directors and Pasadena officials."</TE>
<TE>   Until Balthis was chosen, there had been no queen since 1914, and
before that, only in 1905 and 1906. Clearly, it was a much more
casual process than it is today.</TE>
<TE>   "I was allowed to choose my own court to accompany me on the
float," she said. She picked her sister, 15-year-old Gabrielle, and
five high school friends.</TE>
<TE>   These were gentler days before world TV broadcasts of the parade.
Because she was familiar with the event, Balthis handled all her own
publicity. She arranged for her sister and friends to pose for photos
with her in a Dodge convertible alongside a pond at the exclusive
Raymond Hotel. (All that's left today is its gatehouse, which is a
restaurant.)</TE>
<TE>   "Then all of us stood inside a large jigsaw puzzle of the United
States at Pasadena's Brookside Park. I had been with the tournament
for so long that all this was like second nature to me," she said.
"Oh, we've come a long way, baby, since those days."</TE>
<TE>   Balthis was 22, older than more recent teenage queens, a college
student and knowledgeable about the parade. Self-assured since high
school, when she had been elected president of the Girls League and
president of her social club, she took this queen business in stride.</TE>
<TE>   On parade-day morning, Balthis' proud father put his daughters
into his old Hudson and drove them to the beginning of the parade
route. The Rose Queen's biggest thrill atop the rose-festooned float
came when it rounded Orange Grove and Colorado and sailed past the
cheering multitudes.</TE>
<TE>   "But the big thrill, of course, is going to the Rose Bowl on the
arm of your escort," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her escort turned out to be her fiance, Frank S. Balthis, a
Harvard Law School student. He had been sending her special-delivery
letters every Sunday for three years. Thirty-one years after they
were married, he became an appellate court justice.</TE>
<TE>   That afternoon, USC's "Thundering Herd" beat the previously
undefeated University of Pittsburgh team, 47-14. Much of the nation
tuned the radio to the Rose Bowl game, narrated by legendary sports
broadcasters Ted Husing and Graham McNamee, the Vin Scullys of their
day.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl stadium where Balthis presided was only 7 years old.
It had been the inspiration of William L. Leishman, president of the
Tournament of Roses when it was built and a friend of Balthis.</TE>
<TE>   Until 1923, the New Year's Day game was played at Tournament Park,
now part of the Caltech campus. But in 1922, after spectators pushed
over a wooden fence that surrounded the field and rushed inside,
Leishman and architect Myron Hunt decided the place was no longer
usable.</TE>
<TE>   He and Hunt took tournament and Pasadena city officials on a tour
of the Arroyo Seco dump, which was filled with boulders and trash. He
waxed lyrical about its potential as the site for a sports stadium.</TE>
<TE>   As Balthis remembered it, Harlan Hall, a reporter for the Pasadena
Star-News "and quite a character, was on loan to the tournament as a
publicist." He said, "Since we have a Rose Parade, we should call
this the Rose Bowl. And that's what they did."</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl is football's anchor, a link to its history. The
Four Horsemen played there, coached by Knute Rockne, in Notre Dame's
only Rose Bowl appearance (1925; Notre Dame defeated Stanford,
27-10).</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl is where, in 1929, California center Roy Riegels
famously ran 65 yards the wrong way, setting up a safety that cost
Cal an 8-7 loss to Georgia Tech.</TE>
<TE>   It's where USC's Doyle Nave completed a pass to Al Krueger to beat
Duke, 7-3, in 1939, in one of college football's greatest finishes.
Those seven points were the only ones scored against Duke that entire
season.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl did not become a Big Ten-Pacific coast match until
1947. The Rose Parade itself began in 1890, and the football games in
1902, when Stanford faced the University of Michigan. Before then,
accompanying athletic events had included polo and tug-of-war. By the
third quarter, Stanford surrendered, trailing 49-0. The next year,
the Tournament of Roses reverted to polo. Later, it tried chariot
races. Football didn't return until 1916.</TE>
<TE>   In 1930, before the last rose petal was swept from the streets of
Pasadena, Balthis took off her finery and went back to an ordinary,
comfortable life. She dressed up again in her satin parade dress with
a gardenia corsage when her fiance took her dancing at the Cocoanut
Grove nightclub in the Ambassador Hotel. "It was so romantic," she
said, with all those palm trees with faux monkeys in them.</TE>
<TE>   Five months later, they were married. The bride wore her $10
parade dress. That dress had multiple uses and wearings: "Eventually
my dress became a long-sleeved blouse because it got so bad, and I
can't remember what happened to it."</TE>
<TE>   Hearth and home remained the focus of her life. She spent many
hours in volunteer work and helping her husband, who died in 1978.
They were married 47 years and have a son, Frank Jr. Today she lives
in the same south Laguna Beach house that she shared with her husband
for many years.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the Rose Queens who followed her received hundreds of fan
letters, especially from soldiers during World War II. Balthis
remembers only one -- from a man she called Rye the Rice Writer. "He
painstakingly inscribed my name, date and the words 'Tournament of
Roses' on a grain of rice and sent it to me from back East. He kept
it up for several years and then stopped."</TE>
<TE>   In June 1986, Balthis was asked to help kick off Pasadena's 100th
birthday celebration by riding on a float. But when she heard the
float was a wagon drawn by mules, she set the committee all atwitter
by refusing. She didn't want to ride in a mule cart.</TE>
<TE>   The matter was submitted to Pasadena's Centennial Parade
Committee. Meetings were held, discussions took place and
negotiations were conducted. Someone even suggested trying to pull
the wool over her eyes by covering the mules with a lot of flowers
and calling them ponies, but someone else doubted that would work.</TE>
<TE>   At last, Balthis agreed to clamber aboard the elegantly decorated
hay wagon for a mule-powered ride, drawn by the Smiser Mules -- "very
lovely animals who live in San Marino," parade coordinator Shirley
Mannings said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Rose Queens didn't receive crowns until 1931, the year after
Balthis' reign. So in January 1990, when she rode on a float with 41
other former monarchs in the 100th Rose Parade, she had to borrow
rhinestone headgear. "I felt like Cinderella with borrowed finery,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   That December, 60 years after her reign, she got her very own
crown.</TE>
<TE>   The crowns of every Rose Queen since 1931 have been retained as
property of the Tournament of Roses Assn. All are kept in a locked
display case at the Tournament House. Only Balthis has been permitted
to keep her crown, because it was given to her by Eastman Kodak Co.,
sponsor of the annual Rose Queen reunion.</TE>
<TE>   Monday, the grande dame of all Rose Queens will show up once again
for the reunion brunch in Pasadena. Her successors affectionately
call her their "Queen Mum."</TE>

<LD>Counselor Cynthia Martini has her hands full giving college-admission
guidance to more than 1,000 students at Fullerton's Sunny Hills High
School. Her job may soon get much easier and give pupils and their
parents an edge in the complicated process.</LD>
<LD>   This fall, Martini became one of the first to try a new Web site
created by USC's admissions department as a sort of electronic
guidance counselor to track high school students' grades, activities
and test scores and link them to information about colleges and
financial aid.</LD>
<LD>   "Kids at most schools wouldn't even think to do those things until
their junior or senior year, when I or one of my peers tells them to,
and by then it's almost too late," Martini said.</LD>
<TE>   "This site will enable students at even the most understaffed
schools to access the same amount of information as those at little
private schools," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Martini and a handful of her Southern California peers volunteered
to provide the first wave of feedback about the site during a campus
information fair for high school guidance counselors. The site, which
cost the university $300,000 to create, became available to students
this month.</TE>
<TE>   USC officials say the Web site -- preparingforcollege.usc.edu --
is intended not as a recruitment tool but as a means to level the
college-admissions playing field for students of varying educational
and socioeconomic backgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   "This is truly a public service," said J. Michael Thompson, the
Los Angeles university's admissions director, who developed the
concept last spring.</TE>
<TE>   At a spring reception for incoming Sunny Hills students, Martini
plans to tell families of eighth-graders to start using the site.
Although she has yet to introduce the site to her students, she did
create a portfolio for a fictional senior to explore its
capabilities. It reminded her about financial aid deadlines and
alerted her to additional classes she needed to take to be eligible
for University of California campuses.</TE>
<TE>   "It keeps everything organized for you, so it's all there when
it's application time," she said. "All those essential details in the
process tend to get forgotten until the last minute when kids and
their parents are freaking out about the big picture."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Los Angeles Unified School District board
members voted to begin urging the district's roughly 177,000 high
school students to use the site. Such information can help close the
achievement gap between ethnic and socioeconomic groups, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson helped launch a similar site called UC Gateways as UC
Santa Cruz's admissions director three years ago. But it is available
only to participants in the UC system's programs for high school
students.</TE>
<TE>   The USC site may be the only university-sponsored service that
provides information about the college admissions scramble to all
students, parents and counselors, not just those headed in its
direction.</TE>
<TE>   Those run by other universities have use restrictions or include
information about only the colleges in their system, Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   Once a year, users of the USC site will be asked if they are
interested in attending that school. If they say yes, their contact
information will be forwarded to the university's recruitment office.
Those who say no or don't respond can continue to use the site
without further inquiries.</TE>
<TE>   Registered users can create printable records of every high school
course and standardized test they have taken, along with awards,
extracurricular activities and work experience.</TE>
<TE>   Students also can compare colleges, take IQ and personality tests,
find links to other college Web pages, get financial aid and
scholarship information, and access career pages such as Monster.com
and the Peace Corps (www.peacecorps.gov).</TE>
<TE>   Visitors could almost forget it's a USC site. There's just a tiny
logo in one corner, and only users familiar with the campus would
recognize libraries, buildings and classrooms in the "college life"
photos atop each page.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't set out to create a world where all the information was
about USC," Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's for every student, not just aspiring Trojans."</TE>

<HD>Hospital's $50-Million Make-Over Underway</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amanda Covarrubias</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As its onetime rival down the street prepares to double in size,
Ventura County health officials have begun $50 million in upgrades
and earthquake renovations at the county's public hospital.</LD>
<LD>   The Ventura County Medical Center, constituting several buildings
in midtown Ventura, sorely needs a make-over, especially on a 1954
building that houses neonatal intensive care, pediatrics and some
obstetrics and surgery beds, hospital director Mike Powers said.</LD>
<LD>   But the work, needed in part to meet strict new earthquake safety
standards by 2008, will not include an expansion, county officials
said.</LD>
<TE>   Several private hospitals in the county -- including Community
Memorial two blocks away, Los Robles Regional Medical Center in
Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley Hospital -- recently announced
retrofitting plans that include expansions. The Community Memorial
and Los Robles projects will cost about $120 million each, the new
Simi Valley wing about $35 million.</TE>
<TE>   At Ventura County Medical Center, construction began five months
ago on a new kitchen, cafeteria and laboratory building, scheduled to
be completed in two years. The current kitchen and cafeteria are in a
modular building that will be razed, and the laboratory will be moved
from the old administration building, Powers said.</TE>
<TE>   About $8 million of the $14-million cost is being paid by a state
grant awarded in 1994 to hospitals that receive a disproportionate
share of low-income patients. County taxpayers will foot the
remainder. The $36-million seismic upgrade is in the planning stages,
but most of the work will be limited to the 48-year-old building,
Powers said.</TE>
<TE>   Two other structures -- one housing the inpatient psychiatric unit
and the other containing the emergency room, intensive care and
obstetrics and gynecology -- are in good shape and will require
little work, Powers said.</TE>
<TE>   The oldest building on the site was erected in 1920. Since it will
be used only for administrative and support staff offices, and not
for patients, it does not fall under the stringent new state rules.</TE>
<TE>   Although financing still has to be worked out, Powers said he
expects the design and bidding process to be completed by 2005 and
construction to begin in 2006. A state law passed after the 1994
Northridge earthquake requires all California hospitals to meet
strict standards by 2008 to prevent their buildings from collapsing
during earthquakes.</TE>
<TE>   According to hospital industry projections, about half of the
state's 2,700 medical buildings at 450 sites have to be reinforced or
rebuilt at a cost of about $10 billion to meet the state
requirements.</TE>
<TE>   But with many hospitals scraping by financially, they may not be
able to borrow the millions of dollars needed for upgrades. Powers
said he does not believe that will be a problem for the county
hospital, despite the fact it loses millions of dollars a year on
operations.</TE>
<TE>   Powers said the Board of Supervisors could elect to pay for the
project by issuing tax-exempt certificates of participation, which
are similar to bonds for long-term financing.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital's $145-million annual operating budget could handle
paying back a loan at a rate of about $2 million a year, Powers said.</TE>
<TE>   The county also may be able to buy time by taking advantage of an
exception that extends the state's deadline to 2013 if some seismic
work on a substandard building has begun, Powers said.</TE>
<TE>   And with so many public hospitals in California scrambling for
funding, the state may decide to extend the deadline for everyone as
the Legislature struggles with its own budget crisis, Powers said.</TE>

<HD>Arson Hits Australian Detainee Camp</HD>
<DH>Hospital treats 11 after a second deliberate fire at the
holding center for asylum seekers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CANBERRA, Australia</DL>
<LD>A fire swept through a detention center for asylum seekers early
today in southern Australia in what officials said was the second act
of arson in as many days.</LD>
<LD>   Bedding, furniture and shower curtains were set on fire at the
Baxter detention center in South Australia state, said fire service
spokesman Bill Dwyer.</LD>
<LD>   The blaze destroyed 17 rooms in the men's compound, and nine
detainees and two staff members were treated at a hospital for smoke
inhalation, said Pete Pederson, a spokesman for the Department of
Immigration.</LD>
<TE>   Baxter is the newest of seven detention centers in mainland
Australia where about 1,200 illegal immigrants, most of them from the
Middle East and South Asia, are being held while their applications
for asylum are considered.</TE>
<TE>   The last three years have seen riots, arson and self-mutilation by
detainees, drawing widespread criticism of Australia's treatment of
asylum seekers.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the centers are collections of temporary buildings
surrounded by razor wire in remote camps.</TE>
<TE>   Some detainees who have been refused refugee visas but cannot be
returned to their home countries have languished in the camps for
more than three years.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter opened earlier this year as Australia's first detention
center built specifically for asylum seekers. It has a capacity of
1,200 but currently holds 215 detainees, including men, women and
children.</TE>

<HD>Chechen Blast Questions Mount</HD>
<DH>With the deaths from suicide bombing at 55, officials try
to discover how it was carried out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Dixon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>MOSCOW -- As the death toll from a double suicide blast in Chechnya
grew to at least 55, Russian officials on Saturday were desperately
seeking to explain how the attackers got through several military
checkpoints to bomb the pro-Moscow government headquarters -- the
most heavily protected building in the capital.</LD>
<LD>   Friday's attack, which injured more than 120 people, raised new
doubts about Moscow's Chechnya policy, but officials vowed to press
ahead with a referendum in the republic, due in March, to help decide
its future.</LD>
<LD>   Critics, however, questioned official claims that the Chechen
conflict is over and that the republic is stable enough for a
meaningful referendum.</LD>
<TE>   After Russia's unsuccessful 1994-96 Chechen war and more than
three years of conflict since 1999, the pressure is on Russian
President Vladimir V. Putin to demonstrate a victory. Determined to
show Russians that life in Chechnya is normal, he has dismissed the
idea of peace talks with the separatist rebels who oppose Russian
rule.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials privately concede how difficult it would be for
Russia to accept peace talks after Chechen rebels took hundreds of
hostages in a Moscow theater in October. But some analysts doubt that
the referendum is the right tool to resolve the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "The referendum is unlikely to bring about peace in Chechnya,
simply because the main reasons of the war have not been removed,"
said Alexander I. Zhilin, a Moscow-based military analyst. "There are
still forces, both inside and outside Chechnya, that are financially
and politically interested in the continuation of hostilities."</TE>
<TE>   Suicide bombers driving a truck and a military jeep charged the
headquarters of the Chechen administration in the capital, Grozny, on
Friday, causing two enormous blasts and reducing the building to a
shell. Some reports put the number of dead at 57. Rescuers worked
until dark Saturday but had found no survivors since Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's Foreign Ministry issued a statement Saturday saying that
Chechen rebels are international terrorists and warning that the only
way to fight terrorism is to "give up political stereotypes and
double standards" -- a reference to Russia's view that Chechen rebels
should be hunted as vigorously as Al Qaeda militants.</TE>
<TE>   Zhilin said the attack "testifies to the fact that the [Russian
forces] do not control anything in Chechnya, not even their own HQ.
If a couple of suicide drivers can stage a successful attack on a
government complex, it means only one thing: There is utter disorder
there."</TE>
<TE>   Viktor Kazantsev, Putin's representative in the Caucasus, placed
the blame on authorities in Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   "Those in charge of the security of the government compound did
exceptionally badly. Carelessness was shown by many, from a
rank-and-file soldier to high-ranking people," he said, suggesting,
without naming names, that a Chechen minister had been negligent.</TE>
<TE>   Kazantsev insisted that if well-established security procedures
had been followed, the attack could never have succeeded.</TE>
<TE>   Chechen Prime Minister Mikhail Babich said investigators were
looking into how the bombers managed to bring so many explosives into
central Grozny. He said they apparently had no special documents or
passes.</TE>
<TE>   But Chechnya's deputy interior minister, Akhmed Dakayev, offered a
different version, suggesting that the two vehicles used by three
kamikazes had military license plates and official passes and that
the attackers were carrying identification papers, wore Russian
military uniforms and did not look Chechen.</TE>
<TE>   The strike against the most visible symbol of Moscow's rule in
Chechnya came after a series of headline-grabbing attacks by rebels,
including the Moscow theater takeover and the downing of a huge
Russian military chopper in August, which killed 119 servicemen.</TE>
<TE>   The head of the pro-Moscow administration, Akhmad Kadyrov,
insisted Saturday that the referendum would go ahead.</TE>
<TE>   But Boris Y. Nemtsov, the liberal leader of Russia's Union of
Right Forces party, said the vote could not replace serious political
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "The authorities have profaned this idea and turned it into a
farce. If the referendum is held in Chechnya's current situation, if
it is held at gunpoint and with acts of terror there on a regular
basis, then who will believe the results and the legitimacy of such a
referendum?" Nemtsov said.</TE>
<TE>   "Moscow should stop the practice of incessant mopping-up
operations that only generate terrorism," he said, referring to
blockades and searches of Chechen villages in which many civilian men
have been detained by the Russians, never to be seen again.</TE>
<TE>   "When a peaceful civilian is wounded in the course of a mopping-up
operation or goes missing, 10 other people go into the mountains [to
become rebel fighters]. This is why Moscow should start thinking
about pulling the troops out," Nemtsov said.</TE>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>KABUL, Afghanistan -- Treading cautiously on the issue of atrocities
in a country that has seen many in 23 years of war, the United
Nations said Saturday that it will help investigate several mass
graves in northern Afghanistan this spring but will leave it up to
Afghans whether and how to proceed with any evidence that is
uncovered.</LD>
<LD>   Site work for a U.N.-sponsored feasibility study for an
investigation has just been completed, and excavations at three or
more sites around Sheberghan and Mazar-i-Sharif may begin as early as
April, a U.N. source said Saturday on condition of anonymity.</LD>
<LD>   Due to the political climate, the United Nations will not press
the Afghan government to launch a truth commission or war crimes
tribunal even if a wealth of evidence indicating atrocities is found,
sources said. Past U.N.-led investigations of alleged mass slayings
in Rwanda, Guatemala and the Balkans have led to such panels.</LD>
<TE>   "In our view, what is to be done with the results of the
investigation needs to be decided by the Afghans in a nationwide
debate. In a country with transitional justice, one just emerging
from a long period of conflict, conditions might not be mature enough
to deal with human rights violations of this magnitude," said an
international human rights expert working in Afghanistan who asked
not to be named.</TE>
<TE>   Further complicating the situation is that allegations of mass
graves abound in Afghanistan, a source said. That presents
fair-minded officials with the problem of where to start digging.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation in northern Afghanistan began after reports
surfaced that hundreds of captured Taliban fighters died last year in
metal shipping containers during their transfer to prisons by
Northern Alliance militiamen. Taliban prisoners at the Sheberghan
prison told a delegation from the U.S.-based Physicians for Human
Rights last January that hundreds of their comrades never arrived at
the prison after giving themselves up in the city of Kunduz.</TE>
<TE>   In a report in August, Newsweek magazine said as many as 1,000
people may have suffocated in the containers. Spokesmen for Northern
Alliance leaders have acknowledged that some captured Taliban
fighters died but say that no more than 200 perished. They contend
that the deaths were not intentional but were caused by disease and
battle injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Among the sites likely to be analyzed is one in Dasht-i-Leili,
near Sheberghan, where the principal mass grave of the Taliban
prisoners is said to be. But in a bid to assuage Northern Alliance
leaders who now control the region and who initially resisted the
investigation, international officials have agreed to study two or
more sites around Mazar-i-Sharif that allegedly contain victims
killed by the Taliban in 1997 and 1998 -- before the U.S.-led force
and the Northern Alliance drove the regime from power last year.</TE>
<TE>   Before the multisite plan was hammered out, Northern Alliance
warlords told the United Nations that they could not guarantee the
safety of investigators, drawing a rebuke from Lakhdar Brahimi, the
U.N. special envoy to Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. human rights groups called for a probe of the shipping
container deaths after witnesses said U.S. soldiers may have been
present during the transport. U.S. troops were seen accompanying
warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum's forces during several stages of the
prisoner transfer, according to news reports. But the Pentagon said
this summer that an internal inquiry found no U.S. involvement in the
deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Site work for the U.N.-sponsored feasibility study for the probe
was performed by William Haglund, a noted forensic anthropologist
from Seattle who has analyzed mass graves in Rwanda, the Balkans and
Sri Lanka and who visited Sheberghan prison with the physicians
group.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview after a recent trip to Afghanistan, Haglund
described a grave site he visited as "very large" but declined to
estimate how many victims could be buried there. Haglund is expected
to make recommendations to the U.N. in late January.</TE>

<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>The Iraqi government scoffed Saturday at Washington's decision to
deploy thousands of additional troops to the region in preparation
for possible war, as U.N. arms inspectors visited five suspected
weapons sites in and around the capital.</LD>
<LD>   "Whoever dares to strike Iraq and its people will pay a high
price," the official Iraqi army newspaper, Al Qadissiya, said in an
editorial.</LD>
<LD>   Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh opened a seminar in
Baghdad on Saturday saying that Iraq would defeat any invader.</LD>
<TE>   "We will fight from village to village, from city to city, from
street to street in every city," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of U.S. troops, two aircraft carrier battle groups and
scores of combat aircraft have received orders since Christmas to
ready themselves to head to the region in January and February, U.S.
defense officials said Friday. Military personnel will go to Kuwait,
Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain, among other locations.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi Information Ministry said teams of U.N. inspectors went
to the Al Qa Qaa complex, near Baghdad, and four other sites,
including the Al Kindi vaccine factory -- which was also inspected
Dec. 22 -- and the Ibn Yunis engineering plant.</TE>
<TE>   The inspectors have visited Al Qa Qaa eight times since they
resumed work Nov. 27. The huge complex houses several factories,
including one used to make parts for missiles.</TE>
<TE>   During the inspections in the 1990s, the United Nations destroyed
tons of Iraqi chemical and biological weapons and dismantled Iraq's
nuclear weapons program.</TE>
<TE>   However, the inspectors do not believe they had found all of
Iraq's banned arsenal by the time they left ahead of U.S. and British
airstrikes in late 1998.</TE>
<TE>   After the airstrikes, Iraq refused to allow the inspectors to
return and insisted that it had no weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq agreed to readmit the inspectors after the passage of U.N.
Security Council Resolution 1441, which warns Baghdad of "serious
consequences" if it does not cooperate with the U.N. disarmament
process. The United States and Britain have threatened to back that
up with force if necessary.</TE>

<HD>Voters in Kenya Oust Ruling Party</HD>
<DH>Its 40-year hold on power comes to an end, as the
opposition takes over parliament and the presidency with a landslide
victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Solomon Moore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa</DL>
<LD>Kenya's opposition party won a landslide election victory, sweeping
parliamentary contests and taking over the presidency from one of
Africa's most enduring dictators, officials announced today.</LD>
<LD>   An election commission official and an independent voting monitor
said the National Rainbow Coalition's Mwai Kibaki -- a career
politician and two-time presidential challenger -- had beaten Uhuru
Kenyatta of the ruling Kenya African National Union party. An
official announcement was due later in the day after the results were
certified.</LD>
<LD>   Outgoing President Daniel Arap Moi, Kenya's second president,
handpicked political neophyte Kenyatta, 42, to succeed him. Kenyatta
campaigned on his youth, his outsider status and his name -- his
father, Jomo Kenyatta, was Kenya's first president.</LD>
<TE>   But with most of the vote counted, Kibaki led by more than 30
percentage points and his party, known as NARC, had at least 116
seats in parliament to KANU's 42, with some races yet to be decided.
Kibaki was ahead by more than 1.5 million votes out of about 5
million cast, according to figures from the independent monitor, the
Institute for Education in Democracy.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say that ordinary Kenyans are tired of seeing their
leaders pocketing public funds and rewarding their friends.</TE>
<TE>   As the tally worsened for KANU, even Kenyatta and Moi announced
their satisfaction with the election and their willingness to abide
by the results.</TE>
<TE>   Kenya's relatively peaceful election was a welcome addition to a
series of promising developments in Africa -- potential resolution of
two major wars, in Angola and in Congo, and creation of two
multinational partnerships devoted to good governance and economic
prosperity.</TE>
<TE>   But a smooth transition of power will be only one small step in
Kenya's recovery after 40 years of KANU party rule. Kibaki will lead
a hastily formed coalition that owes its creation more to political
expediency than to deep ideological agreement.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, euphoric Kenyans were dancing in the streets, but
most political experts believe that Kibaki's honeymoon will be
brutally short as he is confronted with the long-neglected needs of
his constituency. Basics such as housing, clean water and education
are inaccessible to most Kenyans. Millions don't have enough to eat,
and AIDS is taking a terrible toll.</TE>
<TE>   "Once the election is over, the question becomes: Will Kibaki and
the National Rainbow alliance be able to rule with coherence?" said
Hermann Hanekom, a researcher at the Africa Institute, a South
African think tank. "Does Kibaki have what it takes to form an
effective government, or will he be confronted with constant
infighting?"</TE>
<TE>   Speaking from Nairobi, the capital, Adebayo Adedeji, chairman of
the British Commonwealth's election monitor group, said Friday's vote
was a democratic explosion. He estimated that as many as 50 political
parties proffered candidates -- a positive development after so many
years of single-party rule. But he was also worried about NARC's
ability to keep its promises. "People's expectations are going to be
very high," said Adedeji, who is also a professor at the African
Center for Development and Strategic Studies outside Lagos. "If
public service delivery does not meet those expectations, that will
create divisions that will challenge the democratic process in
Kenya."</TE>
<TE>   Kibaki has as good a chance as any politician at unifying his
fractious nation, observers said. He is an established member of
Kenya's elite, having fought for independence from Britain in the
1960s. He is also a member of the nation's largest and most powerful
ethnic group, the Kikuyu tribe. Kibaki served under both of Kenya's
previous presidents, as vice president and as finance minister.</TE>
<TE>   Although Kibaki comes to power on promises to clean up government
corruption and reorient the nation's economy, critics say that he was
a beneficiary of the cronyism that defined Moi's rule. Kibaki
combined his roles as entrepreneur and senior government official to
amass a fortune in real estate, banking and retail investments.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Kibaki's liabilities did not seem to damp Kenyans' spirits
on Friday. As he sat in a raucous Nairobi bar, Manal Lemayian, a
member of Kenya's election commission, said Kibaki's impending
victory showed that "you cannot win leadership in Kenya by money or
fighting."</TE>
<TE>   "It's the people's choice that matters," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lemayian said Kenya's relatively bucolic balloting was the
culmination of two years of training poll workers, educating voters
and lobbying politicians to change election laws. For the first time,
ballots were counted at local polling stations, minimizing risk they
might be tampered with on the way to a central location. This
election also imposed stricter standards regarding privacy, Lemayian
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts say that Kenya's neighbors are counting on East
Africa's richest nation to make a comeback.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. also has taken an interest in Kenya's fortunes because of
its strategic location near the Horn of Africa and because it has
twice been targeted by Islamic extremists for bomb attacks -- at the
U.S. Embassy in Nairobi in 1998, and last month, at a Mombasa hotel
that was popular with Israeli tourists.</TE>

<HD>Northern City Could Be Key to U.S. Invasion of Iraq</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robin Wright</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CHAMSHAMAL, Iraq</DL>
<LD>CHAMSHAMAL, Iraq -- Just a 30-minute drive from this isolated
checkpoint, beyond Iraqi troops and artillery deployed on a rocky
ridge, lies a city that could make or break a U.S. intervention in
Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Kirkuk may even be one of the first stops for American troops.</LD>
<LD>   The northern Iraqi city's importance was first hinted at in the
Old Testament. King Nebuchadnezzar cast the Jews of Babylon into a
"burning fiery furnace" -- a site that some Middle East scholars
believe was the endless flame from Kirkuk's natural gas, a clue to
oil deposits discovered about 2,500 years later that give modern Iraq
its economic and strategic importance.</LD>
<TE>   But protecting Iraq's oil wells to ensure that President Saddam
Hussein's forces don't destroy them, as they did Kuwait's rigs before
withdrawing from that country in 1991, is only one reason that U.S.
troops may deploy in this city. More important, say U.S. officials
and Iraqi dissidents, is its ethnic makeup.</TE>
<TE>   Kirkuk is the Jerusalem of Iraq, a city of about 900,000 people
with conflicting claims on the land. Rivalries are so deep that any
scramble for the city could become a war within a war -- with Iraqis
fighting among themselves to claim it, potentially dragging in
neighboring countries.</TE>
<TE>   "Taking Baghdad will determine the outcome of the war. Sorting out
Kirkuk will determine what happens afterward," predicted a senior
U.S. official.</TE>
<TE>   In a twist on the conflict over Jerusalem, Arabs now dominate
Kirkuk, largely because of a deliberate and decades-long campaign by
the Iraqi leader to change the makeup of its population.</TE>
<TE>   Between 120,000 and 200,000 Kurds, as well as Turkomans and
Assyrians, have been expelled from Kirkuk since 1991, according to
U.N. officials and a recent Human Rights Watch report. Tens of
thousands were forced out in earlier decades.</TE>
<TE>   Most were dumped at this lonely checkpoint, where Kurdish guards
man a small cement shelter, or two other crossing points into the
northern Iraqi enclave known as Kurdistan. And most are still waiting
near here to reclaim their seized land, homes and possessions turned
over to Arabs during Hussein's rule and to bring Kirkuk back under
Kurdish control.</TE>
<TE>   "Kirkuk is the embodiment of the Kurds' suffering in Iraq. It's
the place of the most brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing, which
continues to this day," said Barham Salih of the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan, or PUK, which controls this checkpoint and half the
Kurdish enclave that has gained self-rule since 1991 under protection
from U.S. and British warplanes.</TE>
<TE>   "For Iraq to be peaceful and rid of its terrible past, any new
government has to redress the injuries of the people of Kirkuk," said
Salih, prime minister in the eastern sector of Kurdistan.</TE>
<TE>   A recent study by the Brookings Institution warned that, if
Hussein is toppled, the anger and plight of hundreds of thousands of
displaced people could ignite "political struggles that are now
dormant, suppressed by the larger struggle against the regime in
Baghdad."</TE>
<TE>   But undoing the past presents its own problems, which is why
American troops are likely to try to take and hold Kirkuk as one of
the early acts of any military operation, U.S. officials say. The
goal will be to prevent any race for the land by Kurds and other
displaced minorities -- and the outbreak of an internal war that
could divert U.S. attention and unravel the postwar transition.</TE>
<TE>   In the confusion of conflict, that may be a tough assignment, U.S.
analysts and Kurdish officials concede.</TE>
<TE>   Ibrahim Aziz Biez, 29, is a Kurd born in Kirkuk, where his family
ran a bakery. He was forced into exile in Kurdistan in 1992 and soon
after joined the peshmerga, the guerrillas whose name means "those
who face death."</TE>
<TE>   "Now I have two big goals in my life -- to get rid of Saddam
Hussein and to go home to Kirkuk," he said. "Kurdistan without Kirkuk
is like a human being without a heart."</TE>
<TE>   Biez is not unusual. A U.N. survey found that about 45% of the
Iraqis formally deported or unofficially squeezed from Kirkuk expect
to return if Hussein is ousted.</TE>
<TE>   With the peshmerga, the Kurds have a force to make this more than
just a civilian rush to retrieve land. Indeed, most of the roughly
50,000 fighters aligned with one of the two dominant Kurdish groups
in northern Iraq have ties to Kirkuk. The majority are from families
forcibly deported from the area, according to a Kurdish official.</TE>
<TE>   "Saddam Hussein says Kirkuk is the center of the north -- for
intelligence, the military, to administer the region, and even for
his Baath Party's northern headquarters. If it's the capital of the
north, it should be after he goes too," said Noshirwan Mustafa, a
Kurdish author and historian. "So we demand that the Kurdistan
regional government annex it. We will never give up Kirkuk."</TE>
<TE>   The city's status has been a top issue since the Kurdish
parliament resumed in October after a six-year hiatus due to internal
tensions. One proposal calls for Kirkuk to be named the capital of
Kurdistan -- a step that could provoke other ethnic groups.</TE>
<TE>   It could also anger Turkey, which traditionally sees Kirkuk as a
stronghold of Iraq's ethnic Turkomans, a smaller minority. Turkey
also fears the effect that a stronger Kurdish region would have on
its own restive Kurds, who are the world's largest ethnic group
without a state. Even Kurds recognize that any attempt by their
fighters to capture the city could provoke Turkish military
intervention.</TE>
<TE>   Any move by Turkey might in turn draw in neighboring Iran. The
Arab world also could become concerned if Kurds -- who are ethnically
Indo-Europeans -- should try to take back the homes, businesses and
land given to Arabs.</TE>
<TE>   In an attempt to calm passions, Kurdish leaders lately have begun
taking a pragmatic line.</TE>
<TE>   The PUK and the Kurdistan Democratic Party, or KDP -- the two
dominant northern parties -- have pledged that Kirkuk's prized oil
fields should continue to be administered by the central government
in Baghdad. The area, one of two leading Iraqi oil sites, produces up
to 1 million barrels a day and has more than 10 billion barrels of
proven reserves, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Kurds began receiving a significant share of Iraq's wealth only in
1996, when the U.N. "oil-for-food" program began channeling oil
revenues through the U.N. for distribution throughout the country.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders are also showing flexibility on Kirkuk as the regional
capital. In an interview, KDP leader Massoud Barzani said the issue
is negotiable. PUK leader Jalal Talabani said in a separate interview
that Kirkuk should be a "city of brotherhood" for all ethnic groups.</TE>
<TE>   The most urgent issue for U.S. troops may be preventing a mass
influx of Kurds into Kirkuk during the chaotic early stages of any
U.S.-led military operation.</TE>
<TE>   "If U.S. troops come to Kirkuk, I welcome it," said Mustafa, the
historian. "It solves the problem of Turkey and prevents the danger
of 23 Arab countries and Iran getting drawn into an internal problem
-- at least for now."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>Iraq complied with a key United Nations demand Saturday by giving
weapons inspectors a list of more than 500 scientists linked to the
nation's nuclear, chemical, biological and missile programs, a U.N.
official said.</LD>
<LD>   U.N. weapons investigators hope that the list will open avenues to
learning more about Iraq's suspected weapons programs.</LD>
<LD>   U.N. inspectors are supposed to be allowed to speak to Iraqi
scientists in private -- an option Washington hopes will prompt
scientists to reveal hidden arms programs.</LD>
<TE>   So far, inspectors have interviewed two key scientists -- both in
the past week. Both, however, refused to talk alone with U.N.
officials, and Iraqi officials remained present.</TE>
<TE>   "We have received from the Iraqi National Monitoring Directorate a
list of names of personnel associated with Iraq's chemical,
biological, nuclear and ballistic missile programs," Hiro Ueki, the
spokesman for the U.N. office in Baghdad, said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The list marks Baghdad's latest show of cooperation with the new
weapons inspections. While strenuously denying that it possesses any
weapons of mass destruction, Iraq has so far complied with most U.N.
Security Council requirements, including allowing the initial return
of inspectors and giving access to sites the experts want to search.</TE>

<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli troops shot to death a Palestinian girl Saturday in the Gaza
Strip, Palestinian medical workers said, while soldiers clashed with
Palestinian university students in the West Bank.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinians said 9-year-old Hanneen Abu Suleiman was shot in the
head outside her home in the town of Khan Yunis when troops opened
fire from a Jewish settlement a few hundred yards away.</LD>
<LD>   Her home is next to a cemetery between the Palestinian town and
the Jewish settlement. Palestinian security sources said Israeli
soldiers had fired from a watchtower in the settlement. Israeli
military sources said troops had returned fire in the direction of
the cemetery after gunmen shot at their outpost.</LD>
<TE>   The soldiers were unable to verify hitting anyone, the Israeli
sources said. Palestinians had said earlier that there was no
fighting when the child was shot.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Israeli troops clashed with Palestinian students during
an operation near Bethlehem University. A military source said troops
came under attack by students throwing stones from inside the
college. Soldiers responded by firing rubber bullets and stun
grenades into the building, the source said. No injuries were
reported.</TE>
<TE>   Also Saturday, Israeli troops blew up the house of an Islamic
Jihad member in Dura, a village near Otniel, the West Bank settlement
targeted Friday in a Palestinian attack that killed four Israeli
seminary students and injured eight others gathered for a Sabbath
dinner.</TE>
<TE>   The military would not say if the militant, who was not at home at
the time, was suspected in the seminary attack.</TE>
<TE>   In the same village, troops also demolished the home of a militant
from Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement who was shot to death by soldiers
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's seminary attack came a day after Israeli troops killed
nine Palestinians in raids, ending a relative lull in the fighting.
The large death toll raised concerns that the escalation of violence
could influence Israel's Jan. 28 election, boosting the chances of
the hard-liners.</TE>

<HD>Allied Airstrikes in 'No-Fly' Zones Could Benefit Iraq</HD>
<DH>Four years of U.S. and British bombing runs aimed at
degrading Baghdad's defenses may have been divulging tactics to the
enemy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Esther Schrader and Greg Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Despite stepped-up bombing runs by the U.S. and Britain over Iraq's
"no-fly" zones in recent months, President Saddam Hussein's air
defense network has probably improved since the 1991 Persian Gulf
War, defense analysts say.</LD>
<LD>   The flights are designed to gather intelligence on Iraqi weapons
capabilities and degrade Iraq's air defenses in the run-up to a
possible invasion, experts say. While precise data on the targets of
the strikes are closely guarded by the Pentagon and U.S. intelligence
agencies, analysts concur that the bombings have limited Baghdad's
ability to organize and execute coherent military actions.</LD>
<LD>   Nevertheless, Hussein has acquired new air defense equipment in
the last decade from Ukraine and Serbia and has probably learned a
significant amount about U.S. tactics from the continual airstrikes
in the zones. The latest strike came Thursday against military
command and communications targets in southern Iraq, three days after
Iraq shot down a U.S. unmanned surveillance drone. The drones and
other aircraft have been patrolling the two zones established by the
U.S. and Britain after the Gulf War.</LD>
<TE>   Iraq considers the flights violations of its sovereignty and has
been trying to shoot down allied planes since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The southern no-fly zone, covering a vast swath of Iraq below the
33rd parallel, was established to protect Shiite Muslims in the south
from Hussein's military. The northern zone was established to protect
Iraqi Kurds above the 36th parallel. When threatened by Iraqi air
defenses, U.S. and British pilots are authorized to fire missiles at
and drop bombs on such sites.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the air patrols have kept tensions high between
Iraq and the U.S. and Britain, with pilots flying daily missions over
Iraqi air defenses and sometimes being targeted by Iraqi fire. As the
U.S. has stepped up pressure on Iraq to give up what Washington says
is a covert weapons of mass destruction program, senior U.S.
officials have acknowledged that the air patrols are assigned to do
as much surveilling of Iraqi weapons capabilities as protecting of
the Kurds and Shiites.</TE>
<TE>   "The targeting has shifted as we have gone on war footing," said
one former military officer who closely tracks U.S. activities in
Iraq. "We are hitting more valuable military targets, command and
control centers. We realized at some point that trying to hit
individual radar sites was futile. They would just move them, and we
were risking pilots' lives for little return."</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, briefing reporters last
month, said U.S. pilots patrolling the zones routinely perform
"aerial inspections" of Iraqi weapons sites. But Iraq's continued
targeting of U.S. jets has given the Pentagon an excuse to begin
dismantling Iraq's network of surface-to-air missiles and
antiaircraft guns.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the missions have provided significant fodder for
U.S. analysts seeking to gauge Iraq's military capabilities. Planes
patrolling the no-fly zones are equipped with sophisticated sensors
that can gather data on large areas of Iraq outside the zones.</TE>
<TE>   "We fly these missions primarily for reconnaissance purposes. They
provide a vast amount of detailed information on Iraq," said Anthony
Cordesman, a defense analyst with the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a Washington think tank.</TE>
<TE>   However, some analysts say the U.S. and British airstrikes may be
counterproductive to some degree.</TE>
<TE>   With U.S. air power as great as it is, "there's a strong argument
to be made that we would be better off mapping Iraq's air defenses in
detail in peacetime but holding our fire so we can take them out very
quickly in wartime, rather than giving Iraq a decade to learn about
what we do and how we do it," said Michael O'Hanlon, a defense
analyst with the Brookings Institution.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. warplanes enter Iraq through aerial "gates" from Turkey,
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and carriers in the Persian Gulf. Roughly 10,000
U.S. military personnel fly and support about 200 planes to maintain
the zones, with some British help. As the U.S. and Iraq move closer
to war, both sides are using encounters in the zones to probe each
other's capabilities and tactics, said William Schneider Jr.,
chairman of the Defense Science Board, an influential Pentagon
advisory panel.</TE>
<TE>   "There are reciprocal motivations to have more incidents,"
Schneider said. "The Iraqis are anxious to learn more about how the
U.S. has adapted over the past dozen years. The U.S. is interested in
seeing how Iraqi air defenses have been reconfigured."</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's decision to send two of its fighter jets to shoot down a
U.S. surveillance drone 100 miles south of Baghdad last week seemed
at least partly designed to test whether the U.S. would move to
protect the unmanned aircraft, Schneider said.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq took considerable risk in pitting the jets against the
Predator drone, Schneider said, because Iraq's air force is so
depleted it can ill afford any losses.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq has only about 300 warplanes, Schneider said. The country
never recovered 100 or more planes it evacuated to Iran during the
Gulf War. And the existing fleet continues to shrink amid a chronic
shortage of equipment and parts.</TE>
<TE>   "They have difficulty in keeping them flying," Schneider said. As
a result, even senior Iraqi military pilots get only about 120 hours
of flying time a year, he said. Junior pilots are lucky to get 20. By
contrast, U.S. pilots are required to fly at least 20 hours a month
just to retain their status.</TE>
<TE>   Overmatched in the air, Iraq has concentrated its resources on
bolstering its air defense system and has made significant progress
despite trade sanctions and constant U.S. surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   Schneider said that although the Iraqi military has deteriorated
substantially since the Gulf War, there is evidence that its air
defense network has improved, aided by important new radar and
optical equipment from Serbia and Ukraine.</TE>
<TE>   The equipment is designed to allow antiaircraft batteries to
target enemy planes even when radar is jammed or fails, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Their ground-based surface-to-air missile capacity is probably
greater" now than it was before the Gulf War, Schneider said.</TE>
<TE>   Benjamin Works, executive director of the Strategic Issues
Research Institute, said the air defenses set up immediately around
Baghdad and out of range of bombers patrolling the no-fly zones are
of particular concern.</TE>
<TE>   "The air defense system around Baghdad is far more lethal than it
was in '91," Works said. "Pentagon planners take this very
seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Hussein's forces have also been moving more materiel into the
no-fly zones, Works said.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq has also gone to great lengths to conceal and protect its
communications infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   In the Gulf War, Schneider said, the U.S. discovered
communications cables buried under the Tigris River. Since the war's
end, he said, Iraq has spent millions of dollars linking its military
command centers with fiber-optic cables buried deep in the sand.</TE>
<TE>   "But eventually, they have to connect to something," Schneider
said, "and what they connect to has to be aboveground, a radar
station or a command center that supports the radar and the missile."</TE>
<TE>   The allied airstrikes Thursday probably targeted such facilities.
But even when these are hit, they are often repaired within weeks,
Schneider said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials believe that many command facilities are hidden in
mosques or hospitals or other locations surrounded by civilians. It
is not clear how much intelligence the United States has on those
sites.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't know how much the U.S. knows," Schneider said. "They
may be waiting until the last minute to strike some facilities so
Iraq will not have time during the conflict to make repairs."</TE>

<HD>Israeli Army Probes Slaying of Palestinian Grandmother</HD>
<DH>Officials say they are looking harder into civilian deaths
in the West Bank and Gaza.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilkinson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NABLUS, West Bank</DL>
<LD>The killing of Shaden abu Hijleh was both typical and not typical.</LD>
<LD>   The 61-year-old grandmother sat on her front porch, embroidering.
Her husband, a renowned local doctor, was next to her, tending the
thyme plants he had taken to growing during the endless weeks in
which Israeli military forces had confined Nablus residents to their
homes.</LD>
<LD>   Around dusk, two Israeli armored army vehicles -- the kind that
passed every day -- stopped in front of the Abu Hijleh residence. One
or more soldiers opened fire in the couple's direction, not 30 yards
from where they sat in plain view, according to witnesses and
survivors.</LD>
<TE>   Fourteen bullet holes form an arc on the glass front door and part
of the stone wall. One bullet apparently hit just above Shaden's
head; when she cowered, another bullet penetrated her left side. That
one killed her. Her husband, Jamal, 64, was nicked on the top of his
skull.</TE>
<TE>   Shaden abu Hijleh was one of 41 Palestinian civilians killed by
Israeli forces in October as the Israeli-Palestinian war staggered
into its third year and noncombatants on both sides had become the
most common casualties. An average of one Palestinian civilian a day
has been killed in the two months since, according to a tally kept by
B'Tselem, the Israeli human rights organization. The oldest was 95;
three were 2 years old.</TE>
<TE>   (Approximately 45 Israeli civilians were killed in the same
period, the majority in two attacks on buses by Palestinian suicide
bombers.)</TE>
<TE>   Where Abu Hijleh's case takes a turn, however, is in the way it
was handled. The Israeli army, under pressure from the dead woman's
children -- two of whom hold U.S. citizenship -- launched a detailed
investigation. An initial report said she had been killed by a stray
bullet, but top officials didn't accept that. The results of a second
inquiry have not been made public.</TE>
<TE>   With Israel facing criticism for repeated killings of Palestinian
civilians, top military officials say they have begun conducting more
vigorous probes of alleged use of excessive force or other abuses.</TE>
<TE>   One year ago, The Times examined the Israeli army's practice of
investigating the sins of its own and found that most probes were
cursory and that serious punishment was rare. The failure to pursue
alleged abuses worried some influential Israelis, who contended that
it was corroding the morale and discipline of a people's army and
nurturing a culture of impunity.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Israel's war with the Palestinians has metamorphosed
into a protracted battle between the region's most powerful
mechanized army and a string of ruthless guerrilla forces. In what it
described as an attempt to cut off the march of suicide bombers into
Israel, the army at midyear reoccupied most of the West Bank,
positioning its forces in the middle of cities and refugee camps and
entrapping 2 million Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   The toll among civilians rose steadily. Maj. Gen. Moshe Yaalon,
who in July took over as army chief of staff, issued new orders in
October requiring that an internal investigation of each killing of a
civilian be completed within 72 hours and that a full report arrive
on his desk within 21 days.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights activists who have long protested civilian deaths,
however, say the changes are cosmetic. Only high-profile cases are
investigated in any depth, activists say. The vast majority fall by
the wayside.</TE>
<TE>   Most investigations remain within the military chain of command,
which outsiders view with suspicion. A number of cases are elevated
to a stricter level of legal scrutiny within the military judiciary,
and those cases almost always end in courts-martial.</TE>
<TE>   A total of 281 cases had been opened by late this month; 20
involved the killing of Palestinians. In most of the rest, soldiers
were accused of stealing, vandalism and improper use of firearms that
did not result in injury.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 2,000 Palestinians and 700 Israelis have been killed in 27
months of violence.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of killings continue to be attributed to the fog of
war, according to top army officials interviewed for this report.
Soldiers who fire back when shot at might hit civilians in congested
residential areas, and they might miscalculate when having to decide
whether an approaching Palestinian is friend or foe. These incidents
are almost always considered by the army to be justified, the
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are fighting in very crowded, intense areas, where you can
hardly distinguish between a terrorist and a civilian," chief army
spokeswoman Brig. Gen. Ruth Yaron said. "It is extremely complex, and
the ability to distinguish between an innocent man and a terrorist is
almost impossible."</TE>
<TE>   Yael Stein, a researcher with B'Tselem, said soldiers -- young,
undertrained, confused and terrified -- are not being held
accountable.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing happens to a soldier who kills a child," he said. "The
policy of being trigger-happy is a natural consequence when there's a
policy of impunity."</TE>
<TE>   Of the 20 investigations into the killing of Palestinians, two
involved tanks that opened fire on crowds inside the West Bank city
of Jenin. In one incident, a journalist, Imad abu Zahra, was killed
in July; in another, a youth working with international activists was
shot.</TE>
<TE>   The most serious punishment to be meted out involved a lieutenant
colonel who said he shot into the air to disperse a crowd in the West
Bank village of Nazlat Zeid on Oct. 4. A 15-year-old boy, Mohammed
Zeid, was killed. The officer was discharged from command duty, was
demoted and has no future in the army, Yaron said. He may yet face
criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   When 16 people were killed in the Gaza Strip city of Khan Yunis
during a military operation Oct. 7, however, the commanding officer
received nothing more than a mark on his file and probation. Most of
the dead were killed when a helicopter gunship fired a missile into a
neighborhood. The army concluded that eight of those were armed
"terrorists" and that two others were unarmed members of the radical
Islamic Hamas movement. The remaining six were classified as
"unknown."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians identified the six as civilians, including a
50-year-old woman, a 13-year-old and two 16-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   The army has acknowledged disproportionate force. When soldiers
fired three shells into a crowded refugee camp in southern Gaza on
Oct. 17, killing six people, the commander later conceded that one
shell would have been sufficient. Rules were rewritten after the
incident, Yaron said, to prohibit the firing of mortars in densely
populated areas "unless there is no other choice."</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis also contend that Palestinian gunmen deliberately
shoot from populated areas to draw return fire onto civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Col. Daniel Reisner, who heads the Israeli army's international
law division, said it is still too early to tell whether Yaalon's
orders have made a big difference. The aim, he said, was to speed up
the process.</TE>
<TE>   "The global picture was: The longer we keep allegations on the
table without refuting them, the more credible they become," Reisner
said. "And when something really did happen, we need to know
quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Army officials also said there is no standard for how field
investigations are conducted. Some delve deeply; others are quite
superficial.</TE>
<TE>   "Every commander determines whether he's reached the truth,"
Reisner said. "There is no textbook on investigations.... We see a
great variety."</TE>
<TE>   Reisner said the army has to strike a balance between issues of
accountability and the ability of a unit or soldier to carry out a
mission.</TE>
<TE>   "You tell a unit that a lawyer is coming to brief you afterward,
you kill the mission," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In a report issued in September, Amnesty International blamed both
Israel and the Palestinian Authority for failing to protect children.
By its count, 250 Palestinian children and 72 Israeli children were
killed in the conflict between September 2000 and the end of August.</TE>
<TE>   It remains to be seen whether any real changes will come in the
Israeli army's handling of cases.</TE>
<TE>   Affluent and prominent, the members of the Abu Hijleh family have
agitated for justice. They enlisted the support of the U.S. Embassy
and hired an attorney to sue Israel. They took unusual steps to
document their case, including photographing their mother's dead body
minutes after it arrived at the hospital. They saved the bloodstained
embroidery she was working on when she was struck down.</TE>
<TE>   In her "martyr" poster -- every Palestinian killed by Israel
receives such tribute -- Shaden abu Hijleh wears pearls and lipstick,
looking more like Donna Reed than a dangerous radical.</TE>
<TE>   Her son Saed, 36, a political science professor at the local
university, built a special tomb for her in Nablus' crowded cemetery.
He says he is determined that Israel answer for her death.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can make it just a little bit harder for the soldiers to
pull the trigger," he said, "then my mother won't have died in vain."</TE>

<HD>Venezuela Imports Gasoline</HD>
<DH>Fuel arrives from Brazil in response to the shortage caused
by the monthlong walkout. President Chavez decries opposition
strikers.</DH>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>Venezuela imported Brazilian gasoline Saturday in a role reversal for
the oil-rich nation whose government is struggling with a strike that
has made fuel scarce.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said the gasoline being unloaded by the Brazilian tanker
Amazon Explorer at the eastern port of Puerto la Cruz would help
undermine the 27-day-old opposition strike aimed at driving President
Hugo Chavez from office.</LD>
<LD>   Chavez, who has sacked striking executives, sent troops aboard
idled tankers and replaced some crew members with foreigners in a bid
to kick-start crippled state oil firm PDVSA, and decorated loyal
workers at Puerto la Cruz with medals.</LD>
<TE>   "We haven't yet obtained victory, but we are going to win the
battle for PDVSA, the battle for Venezuela," he roared in a typically
colorful speech spiced with references to South American independence
hero Simon Bolivar.</TE>
<TE>   Blasting strikers as "criminals" and "traitors," he said that the
opposition, which is led by business and unions, would be defeated
and oil production would soon return to normal.</TE>
<TE>   The strike has almost completely choked off fuel shipments from
the world's fifth-largest oil exporter, and started a gasoline
drought in a country where people are accustomed to filling their gas
tanks for the price of a hamburger.</TE>
<TE>   The protest also has caused headaches in the United States, which
usually buys about 14% of its oil imports from Venezuela and is
facing possible disruptions to Middle Eastern oil supplies if it goes
to war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The Amazon Explorer's 521,900 barrels will cover fuel needs in
this gasoline-guzzling nation for only about a day. One strike
leader, former PDVSA executive Juan Fernandez, compared the ship's
arrival to "emptying a bottle of water in the desert."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez's opponents say the former paratrooper, who was jailed
after an unsuccessful coup attempt in 1992 but won an election in
1998, is trying to found a communist dictatorship modeled on the rule
of his Cuban friend Fidel Castro.</TE>
<TE>   Demanding immediate elections, his opponents refuse to wait until
August, when Chavez says the constitution will allow a referendum on
his government, due to continue until 2007.</TE>
<TE>   His rule has been marred by allegations of corruption and
authoritarianism, and the country was in deep recession even before
the strike hamstrung the economy.</TE>
<TE>   But Chavez retains significant support among the poor, grateful
for anti-poverty policies such as easy loans.</TE>
<TE>   Polls show he is still more popular than any single figure from
the opposition, which has staged huge street rallies.</TE>
<TE>   In a fresh sign of the divisions cleaving Venezuela, opposition
demonstrators clashed with Chavez supporters in the western city of
Barquisimeto before riot police broke up the disturbances with tear
gas.</TE>
<TE>   Lines hundreds of cars long outside Caracas filling stations have
become a common sight.</TE>

<HD>Clerics Denounce Cloned Baby Claim</HD>
<DH>Catholic, Jewish and Muslim leaders condemn the effort to
artificially begin life. Politicians amplify calls for a global ban.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>VATICAN CITY</DL>
<LD>The Vatican joined leading Muslim clerics and Jewish rabbis Saturday
in denouncing as immoral, brutal and unnatural the claim that the
first cloned baby had been born. Political leaders, meanwhile,
stepped up calls for a global ban on human cloning.</LD>
<LD>   The reaction came a day after a cloning company whose leader
believes that extraterrestrials are responsible for life on Earth
announced that a baby girl, "Eve," had been born as a clone of her
American mother.</LD>
<LD>   There has been no scientific confirmation, however, and the
announcement has been met with doubt by the scientific community and
revulsion by ethicists, who say cloning humans would compromise
freedom and individuality.</LD>
<TE>   A Vatican statement Saturday noted that the announcement came with
no scientific proof and that it "has already given rise to the
skepticism and moral condemnation of a great part of the
international scientific community."</TE>
<TE>   But "the announcement in itself is an expression of a brutal
mentality, devoid of any ethical and human consideration," the
statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Muslim clerics said that cloning humans disrupted natural law and
would create a "chaotic" future for humanity.</TE>
<TE>   "Science must be regulated by firm laws to preserve humanity and
its dignity," said Ali Abu Hassan, a cleric from Egypt's Al Azhar
University, the top religious institution in the Sunni Muslim world.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, a senior Saudi cleric, Ayed bin Ahmad Qurani, said
human cloning is wrong "because it will cause an imbalance in the
human nature God has created," and it would lead to the spread of
unknown diseases, he said. In addition, it could replace marriage for
the sake of reproduction through one gender without the need for the
other, which is "sinful, sinful, sinful," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Jerusalem, Israel's chief Rabbi Yisrael Meir Lau said that in
principle, Judaism favors technological developments and medical
progress that can help save a life or solve infertility problems, but
rejects the artificial creation of life.</TE>
<TE>   "The moment medical science tries to take upon itself duties and
areas which are not its responsibility such as shortening life,
cloning or creating life in an unnatural way, we must set down
borders in order not to harm the basic belief that there is a creator
of the universe in whose hands life and death are placed," a
statement from Lau's office said.</TE>
<TE>   Clonaid, the company that made the announcement, was founded by
the Raelian sect, which has a "scientific creation" theology. Sect
leader Rael claims life on Earth was created by extraterrestrials
through genetic engineering.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Emperor Akihito will undergo surgery next month for prostate cancer,
Japan's Imperial Household Agency announced Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors examined Akihito, 69, Tuesday after blood tests over the
past few years had shown "slightly worrisome" signs, an agency
spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   A prostate biopsy revealed the cancer cells, the spokesman said.</LD>
<TE>   Doctors believe that the cancer hasn't spread and that the emperor
has a "good chance of a full recovery," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The emperor is scheduled to undergo an operation at Tokyo
University Hospital in mid-January to have the cancerous tissue
removed and will be hospitalized for about a month, the spokesman
said.</TE>
<TE>   Akihito's eldest son, Crown Prince Naruhito, will temporarily
assume the emperor's duties if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Agency officials said last week that the emperor had not had
prostate problems in the past and had been feeling well.</TE>
<TE>   But his annual January exam was moved up about a month after his
recent blood tests in- dicated a possibility of pros- tate cancer,
the spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   The emperor hadn't complained of pain or shown any other symptoms,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement will allow the emperor to withdraw from some New
Year's festivities at the Imperial Palace, though he is still
scheduled to appear for his traditional Jan. 1 holiday address.</TE>
<TE>   Under Japan's postwar constitution, the royal family has no
official political powers.</TE>

<HD>North Korea Rebuffs U.N., Insists Nuclear Inspectors Must
Go</HD>
<DH>Three monitors at a facility that has the means to make
weapons will leave by Tuesday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alissa J. Rubin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>VIENNA</DL>
<LD>North Korea held fast Saturday to its demand that international
nuclear inspectors leave the country, rebuffing pleas from the U.N.
to keep the monitors in place. They will leave the country by
Tuesday, officials said. A North Korean official told the three
inspectors, who work for the U.N.'s Vienna-based International Atomic
Energy Agency, that they can no longer monitor activities at the
Yongbyon nuclear facility, 55 miles north of the capital, Pyongyang.</LD>
<LD>   Activity at the site, which includes several facilities related to
the manufacture of nuclear weapons, had been frozen under a 1994
agreement with the United States. However, North Korea declared this
month that it intends to restart its nuclear program and has begun
taking steps to do so.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a country in defiance of its international obligations,"
said Mohamed ElBaradei, the IAEA's director general, who has tried to
use the tools available to the U.N. nuclear watchdog to get North
Korea to slow down the revival of its nuclear program. On Friday, he
urged North Korea to reconsider its expulsion order, to no avail.</LD>
<TE>   The inspectors will depart  the site today for Pyongyang and leave
the country Tuesday -- the first day there is a flight out, said
Melissa Fleming, a spokeswoman for the agency. They are expected to
arrive in Vienna later in the week.</TE>
<TE>   The Yongbyon site includes a nuclear research reactor, a storage
pond that holds about 8,000 spent fuel rods, and a laboratory that
can extract plutonium from spent fuel rods and reprocess it for use
in weapons.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea has said it is restarting the nuclear facilities to
generate electricity, which it desperately needs to get through the
winter. Its supply of fuel oil was cut off in October when the United
States refused to continue to deliver it after North Korea admitted
to having a secret program to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons.
However, experts say the North's reactor cannot generate a
significant amount of electricity.</TE>
<TE>   Countries in the region quickly expressed their distress at North
Korea's decision to expel the inspectors and geared up for regional
talks aimed at trying to find a way to defuse the situation. But it
is the United States that must engage with North Korea if there is to
be a peaceful solution, diplomats in China and Russia said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Losyukov strongly urged
the United States to seek dialogue rather than confrontation with
North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot achieve anything through accusations, pressure or
tight demands, not to mention threats," Losyukov told the Interfax
news agency. "That will only make it worse."</TE>
<TE>   South Korean Foreign Minister Choi Sung Hong called his Chinese
counterpart, Tang Jiaxuan, on Saturday to reconfirm their shared
belief that the Korean peninsula should be nuclear-free, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Minister Tang said the Chinese government hopes the United States
and North Korea will resolve the issue through dialogue," said South
Korean Assistant Foreign Minister Lee Tae Shik.</TE>
<TE>   Japan announced it would use diplomatic channels to register its
distress over North Korea's action and was ready to work with the
United States and South Korea to defuse the situation.</TE>
<TE>   But the United States continued its refusal to talk to the
impoverished Communist regime, refusing to make any overtures, saying
that to do so would be bowing to nuclear blackmail.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States will not negotiate in response to threats or
broken commitments," White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan said.</TE>
<TE>   As for the United Nations, the 35 countries that make up the
IAEA's board of governors will meet in Vienna on Jan. 6 to decide
what steps to take. They are expected to refer the situation to the
U.N. Security Council. However, it is unclear what action the council
could take that would make a difference.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the situation in Iraq, where U.N. inspectors have been
allowed to enter to examine suspect sites, North Korea is blocking
any such examination of suspicious areas. That leaves the Security
Council few options other than the unlikely one of authorizing the
use of force. Sanctions, another option, might be tried, but the
country is already so impoverished, some people question whether they
could have much effect.</TE>
<TE>   The order expelling the inspectors capped a tension-filled week in
which North Korea took daily steps toward restarting its nuclear
weapons program by cutting seals placed by the IAEA on the Yongbyon
nuclear facilities and disabling surveillance cameras the agency had
put in place.</TE>
<TE>   Most worrisome to nuclear weapons experts is that in the last two
days workers appeared to be beginning to repair the plutonium
reprocessing lab. Plutonium can be used to make nuclear weapons. Even
if North Korea could not manufacture a bomb, weapons-grade material
is highly marketable and the cash- and food-starved nation could sell
it to other countries interested in building nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The lab will take two to three months to be put in working order,
experts said.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. officials watching the situation unfold said that for the
moment at least, there appears no easy way to defuse the
confrontation.</TE>
<TE>   "They are still pursuing their policy of defiance. They continue
to escalate a crisis situation," ElBaradei said. "This road they are
embarking on is completely a dead end."</TE>

<HD>Pakistan Police Arrest Suspect in Car Bombing</HD>
<DH>The Islamic militant confessed to involvement in the blast
that killed 14 people in Karachi last spring, official says.</DH>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Authorities formally arrested a detained Islamic militant Saturday
for a car bombing in May that killed 14 people, including 11 French
nationals, a police official said.</LD>
<LD>   Asif Zaheer, who was detained this month for allegedly planning an
attack on U.S. diplomats in the southern port of Karachi, had
confessed to involvement in the May 8 bombing in the city center, the
police official said.</LD>
<LD>   "We have arrested him for the killings of French nationals.... He
is the first person arrested for the French killings," he said.</LD>
<TE>   The 11 French victims were technicians helping the Pakistani navy
build submarines. The attack was one of several on foreigners in
Pakistan this year.</TE>
<TE>   Police surrounded the court when Zaheer, handcuffed and with his
face covered, arrived in a van, witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   Zaheer -- an activist of the Harkat-ul-Jihad-i-Islami group -- was
detained Dec. 14 with two others, Sohail Noor and Mohammed Yousuf.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, police seized a car packed with 22 pounds of
explosives, which they said was to be used in a suicide attack on
U.S. diplomats in Karachi.</TE>
<TE>   Another police official, who asked not to be identified, said
Zaheer had provided important clues about other suspects involved in
the killing of foreigners in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Islamic militants in Pakistan have been angered by the
government's backing for the U.S. war in neighboring Afghanistan that
toppled the Taliban regime and chased away members of Al Qaeda.</TE>

<HD>Protesters in Pyongyang Rally Against U.S.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Demick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>An anti-American rally was held Saturday in the North Korean capital
of Pyongyang in solidarity with demonstrations taking place in South
Korea over a fatal traffic accident involving U.S. soldiers, the
North Korean news agency reported.</LD>
<LD>   The report described an enthusiastic crowd of 10,000 "citizens
from all walks of life" rallying at the open-air theater of the youth
park in Pyongyang.</LD>
<LD>   Along with soaring tension over North Korea's nuclear program, the
official news agency known as KCNA has spewed a steady stream of
anti-U.S. rhetoric, but few public demonstrations have been reported.</LD>
<TE>   The report Saturday, which could not be independently verified,
referred to an accident in June in which two 13-year-old girls were
run over by an armored minesweeping vehicle near the demilitarized
zone that separates the North from the South. A U.S. military court
martial last month acquitted two soldiers of negligent homicide, a
verdict that has sparked regular demonstrations in Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   The North Korean news agency accused the U.S. of "killing Koreans
in cold blood."</TE>
<TE>   In South Korea, conservatives have accused the North Koreans of
fomenting an anti-American atmosphere in an attempt to enlist South
Korean support for the standoff with the U.S. over nuclear weapons.
President-elect Roh Moo Hyun has been a strong supporter of continued
aid to North Korea and a cautious critic of the Bush administration's
policies toward the North and Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   But Roh on Saturday appeared to distance himself from the
anti-U.S. demonstrations and urged activists to suspend the almost
nightly candlelight protests over the girls' deaths. At a meeting
with organizers of the demonstrations, he promised to deal with their
demands for a revision in the Status of Forces Agreement that governs
the role of the 37,000 U.S. troops in South Korea after the North
Korean nuclear crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Later, about 1,200 people marched with candles toward the U.S.
Embassy in Seoul. Previous events have drawn crowds of as many as
50,000.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WELLINGTON, New Zealand</DL>
<LD>Authorities are investigating three men who enrolled in a
scuba-diving course that taught the use of underwater explosives and
then did not complete the course, police said today.</LD>
<LD>   The three paid $4,180 each for the commercial diving course about
six months ago, but two never turned up and the third attended only
one lesson, the Sunday Star-Times newspaper reported.</LD>
<LD>   Police confirmed that they were investigating the incident but
would give no further details.</LD>
<TE>   The newspaper did not explain why the use of underwater explosives
would be taught at the school.</TE>
<TE>   The paper quoted the owner of the dive shop in the town of
Hamilton as saying he became suspicious and contacted local police
after the three men, who he believed were Middle Easterners, failed
to ask for a refund.</TE>
<TE>   The owner told the newspaper that the three men said they had no
diving experience. The man who attended one lesson later phoned to
say he had broken an arm and a leg and would not return.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, the FBI began checking dive shops around the
country in May to see if Al Qaeda operatives had been taking scuba
training.</TE>

<LD>A ban on personal watercraft at Lake Mead National Recreation Area
has been postponed until April 10, the National Park Service said.</LD>
<LD>   The Park Service reached an agreement with Bluewater Network, a
San Francisco-based environmental group, that will allow use of
personal watercraft until April 10 while officials for the recreation
area finalize a management plan for lakes Mead and Mohave.</LD>

<HD>Priority Remains War on Terror, but Bush Sets Domestic
Goals</HD>
<DH>The president uses his weekly radio address to outline a
modest agenda including a drug benefit, the faith-based initiative
and limiting lawsuits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Gerstenzang</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WACO, Texas</DL>
<LD>President Bush is entering the second half of his term with a slim
list of proposals on his domestic policy agenda but a growing
likelihood that he will be able to put more of his program of
"compassionate conservatism" into effect than during his first two
years in office.</LD>
<LD>   White House attention is focused largely on potential war with
Iraq, the ongoing campaign against terrorism and accelerating tax
cuts to stimulate the economy. But social policy will round out the
quartet of issues Bush will focus on to build a case for reelection.
The president used his weekly radio address Saturday to outline his
priorities on the domestic front, beyond his call for quick
congressional action to extend emergency unemployment benefits that
lapsed at the end of the week.</LD>
<LD>   On the president's list: health care, drug costs, limiting certain
lawsuits, carrying out the education legislation he signed a year
ago, continuing the 1996 welfare overhaul and making it easier for
religious groups to tap the federal treasury to carry out charitable
programs.</LD>
<TE>   "We will keep our commitment to America's seniors by working to
reform and modernize Medicare and include a prescription drug benefit
to help seniors who are squeezed by rising drug prices," Bush said.
"We will tackle the crisis of frivolous lawsuits that drive up the
cost of health care."</TE>
<TE>   "We will work to reauthorize the historic welfare reform law that
has improved so many lives," he added, in a speech taped at his ranch
about 30 miles from here. Bush is on a two-week holiday break from
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The focus on drug benefits for the elderly, the faith-based
initiative and welfare revisions leaves Republicans optimistic that
the president will have assembled a domestic record that will help
him avoid the political fate of his father's presidency.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Bush's reelection drive was foiled in 1992 largely over
voters' belief that he had ignored their economic woes and domestic
matters while fighting the Persian Gulf War the year before.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, said that a survey of 2,000
voters on election day last month found that "a sizable number of
people voted Republican because they thought the Republicans more
likely to deliver a drug benefit."</TE>
<TE>   Gaining congressional passage of such a measure, Luntz said, would
demonstrate that Republicans "can deliver what they promised to an
electorate willing to give them a chance and now expecting results."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Luntz said, "it plays against type," putting
Bush in the role of a compassionate leader, when the public sees
Republicans' strength in the hard-edged realm of law and order and
national security.</TE>
<TE>   With the focus on welfare, religious charities and prescription
drug costs, Bush is "raising all the issues the Democrats blocked
that have significant support across the political spectrum," Luntz
said.</TE>
<TE>   Each was part of Bush's original agenda and won approval by the
House, where Republicans held a majority, and were blocked in the
Democratic-led Senate.</TE>
<TE>   With Republicans gaining a majority in the Senate and several
moderate-to-conservative Democrats likely to support Bush's proposals
or some version of them, Luntz and others give the president a high
chance of success with the modest list.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the two parties are not far apart on an important element
in the drug proposal: A Republican measure would cost from $325
billion to $375 billion over 10 years, a Democratic measure would
cost about $500 billion. The gap is wider, however, on the mechanics
of the competing plans.</TE>
<TE>   "If it doesn't get done, it will be seen as a breach of promise,
and that doesn't go well with the citizens," said William A. Galston,
a professor in the school of public affairs at the University of
Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   But the prescription drug program carries a political weight
beyond the substance of the measure itself. It is seen, Galston said,
as a test of Bush's ability to deliver on his 2000 campaign promise
to change the tone of partisan bickering in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Because it is unlikely that any serious legislation will be passed
in 2004, a presidential election year, "what happens in 2003 will
really define in the public's mind whether or not the tone has
changed, and that's why prescription drugs will be so fateful," said
Galston, who was President Clinton's deputy assistant for domestic
policy. "I don't think the president can afford to go into 2004
without a prescription drug program."</TE>
<TE>   This will give Democrats leverage and may make it more difficult
for Bush to place a take-it-or-leave-it proposal on the table.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the success of the war against terrorism, the outcome
of the president's campaign to disarm Iraq and the state of the
economy will trump any element of the social policy agenda on
election day 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The White House acknowledged the role of the security issues in an
internal document, obtained by Associated Press, that puts the war on
terrorism atop Bush's reelection agenda. The list continues with
protection of the American homeland, access to health care and its
cost, and legal reform.</TE>
<TE>   "The big priorities continue to be winning the war on terrorism,
protecting the American people and strengthening our economy," said
Scott McClellan, a deputy White House press secretary.</TE>
<TE>   Emphasizing the limited effects that specific domestic programs
will have on the electorate's 2004 decisions, Ross K. Baker, a
professor of political science at Rutgers University in New Jersey,
said: "They'll add some rouge to the cheeks of the proposals, but
they won't be trotted out at the Oscars."</TE>
<TE>   However, beyond providing the president with specific
accomplishments to take to the voters, the domestic agenda can create
an aura "that makes Republicans look more compassionate," Baker
added.</TE>
<TE>   During Bush's first two years in office, the divided Congress
approved the $1.35-trillion, 10-year tax cut he championed as the
centerpiece of his economic policy and the overhaul of federal
education programs that was at the heart of his social policy agenda.
But otherwise, it approved only a limited number of the president's
programs.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Reed, who for eight years directed Clinton's domestic policy
efforts, said in a recent forum at the Brookings Institution that
Congress' reluctance to act notwithstanding, the approach of the 2004
presidential election will invigorate the White House.</TE>
<TE>   "They do have some problems here on the home front, and the
president seems attuned to at least seeming to care about these
problems," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As a veteran of the 1996 presidential reelection drive, Reed said,
"I can tell you there will be enormous pressure from inside the West
Wing to get things done."</TE>

<KH>DISPATCH FROM SEATTLE</KH>
<HD>A Shopping Institution Falls on Lean Times</HD>
<DH>Unable to keep up with new big-box stores, the quirky
family-owned discount retailer stages a grand-finale sale.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Howe Verhovek</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>There may be other places in the world to find a $6 sleeping bag or a
$14.99 rubber raft, a $2 pair of sandals or a 99-cent mousetrap.</LD>
<LD>   But it just won't be the same as finding a bargain at Chubby &amp;
Tubby's, said John Krasucki, a longshoreman browsing the shelves the
other day at the quirky retailer, a 55-year-old Seattle institution
on the verge of going out of business.</LD>
<LD>   "Selling out to the bare walls! Entire store on sale!" read the
banners at the flagship outlet in Seattle's Rainier Valley
neighborhood. For longtime Seattle residents such as Krasucki, that
is lamentable, the passing of one of those landmarks that give
Seattle its distinctive character.</LD>
<TE>   "I've been shopping here for more than 40 years," Krasucki said.
"I remember coming here as a kid, buying my first pair of Converse
sneakers at a Chubby &amp; Tubby."</TE>
<TE>   The liquidation of the three Chubby &amp; Tubby outlets has generated
an unusual amount of hand-wringing in the Seattle area, becoming the
subject of local news accounts.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Chubby &amp; Tubby was uniquely dialed into what Seattleites
wanted," said Dori Monson, the host of a talk show on KIRO-AM. "Every
time I'd go in there, not only would I find what I was looking for,
I'd find two or three other things that I didn't even know I needed.
I think people here hate the idea of losing it."</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1947 as a military-surplus outlet in a Quonset hut by
Irving "Chubby" Frese and Woodrow "Tubby " Auge, the stores thrived
for decades, selling an eclectic array of goods.</TE>
<TE>   But with Frese's death at the age of 82 in 1997, eight years after
Auge died, the stores' ownership has been in the hands of the next
generation of family members, who apparently have concluded that
their small-box stores are having too difficult a time keeping up in
a retail world dominated by big-box players. And unless a buyer
emerges in the next few weeks, the stores are expected to close for
good.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels like a changing of the guard, like we're all going to
see a monopoly of the Home Depots and the Wal-Marts," said Paula
Terrell, a customer checking out the shelves for more bargains, such
as the $19.99 union suit, a full-body undergarment ("Just like
Grandpa's," reads the sign).</TE>
<TE>   As the liquidation continues, it is not clear how much longer the
stores will be open. General manager Mike DiCecco did not return
telephone calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Cliff Frese, nephew of the co-founder and president of the stores,
said Saturday: "We've been struggling, and we can't struggle anymore"
to keep the business afloat. Frese, who divides his time between Los
Angeles and the Seattle area, still hopes a "viable buyer, perhaps
someone with a real sentimental attachment to Chubby &amp; Tubby's" will
emerge in the coming weeks. In the meantime, the liquidation
continues.</TE>
<TE>   The stores long had the feel of a perpetual, highly crowded
rummage sale, and just five years ago in a commemorative circular
celebrating "50 golden years in Seattle," the company boasted that
"this granddaddy of all discount stores has survived an invasion of
competitors as big as football fields."</TE>
<TE>   But in recent days Chubby and Tubby has taken on a threadbare,
downcast feel as customers clean the shelves.</TE>
<TE>   If Chubby &amp; Tubby does close, it will join other longtime local
retailers that have closed in the last year or so, including
Bushell's Auction House, which shut its doors after 96 years, and
Warshal's Sporting Goods, which closed after 80 years in business.</TE>
<TE>   Frese's general philosophy of salesmanship -- "Buy it cheap, stack
it high and sell it out" -- was in evidence in nearly every narrow,
crammed aisle of his stores.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, Chubby &amp; Tubby has long been known for its
huge selection of inexpensive Christmas trees. That tradition started
shortly after the first store's opening in 1947, when Frese and Auge
began selling trees, cut from power company right of ways, for 97
cents apiece. The rock-bottom prices continued over the years, with
$5.99 the starting price for trees this season.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a guy in here the other day very upset," said Brad Rogers,
a medical student working as a Chubby &amp; Tubby tree salesman this
year. "He said he'd bought his tree every year here for more than 50
years. He said, 'Where am I supposed to buy my tree now?' It just
won't be the same."</TE>
<TE>   Many customers offered a similar dirge.</TE>
<TE>   "You always just felt very at home here," said Vera King, a
retired beautician who has bought sporting goods over the years at
Chubby &amp; Tubby for her four children and six grandchildren. "It's not
too big. It's an old-timey sort of place."</TE>
<TE>   Said Cat Jobes, a nurse who has long come to Chubby &amp; Tubby for
her gardening needs: "When a store likes this goes, it just feels
like life is getting a bit more homogenous."</TE>

<DL>FORT COLLINS, Colo.</DL>
<LD>The arrests of six Middle Eastern men who were not taking enough
college courses to satisfy their visa requirements have prompted
Colorado State University to start a class to educate foreign
students about immigration laws.</LD>
<LD>   A CSU student was among those arrested by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service over the last two weeks for enrolling in fewer
than 12 hours of courses. The other five attend University of
Colorado campuses in Denver and Boulder.</LD>
<LD>   None of the men was suspected of other violations, the INS said.</LD>
<TE>   An immigration lawyer will lead the workshop for male students
from 13 nations, CSU officials said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Hallett, director of International Student and Scholar
Services at CSU, posted $5,000 bail for the arrested CSU student. "I
hope it's the last time that ever happens," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jerome Bookin-Weiner, director of International Programs at CSU,
said most of the jailed students had legitimate reasons for being
under the requirement.</TE>

<HD>Pair of Multiple Killings Eerily Similar</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Tillamook and Lincoln counties share a border, a coastline and the
snowy ridges of the rural Coast Range. And now they share a dubious
distinction: Each is the site of one of the largest mass killings in
Oregon -- spaced exactly a year apart.</LD>
<LD>   On the morning of Dec. 21, a father and son out hunting in the
remote Tillamook State Forest saw drops of blood on the snow. The
trail led to a hand sticking out of the snow with blankets piled on
top of it. The hunters raced to call police from the nearest
convenience store.</LD>
<LD>   Police quickly uncovered the body of 31-year-old Renee Morris and
by nightfall found the bodies of her three children -- Bryant, 10,
Alexis, 8, and Jonathan, 4 -- nearby.</LD>
<TE>   Two days later, the Tillamook County district attorney charged
Edward Morris, 37, with multiple counts of aggravated murder in the
deaths of his family. He is still missing and believed to be on the
run, possibly in northern Washington or Canada. The crime recalled a
similar case last year in Lincoln County, 70 miles to the south.</TE>
<TE>   Over a weeklong period beginning Dec. 19, 2001, Oregonians watched
in horror as the bodies of first one and then two more young children
and their mother were pulled from shallow coastal waters around
Waldport and Yaquina Bay. Mary Jane Longo, 34, and Madison, 2, were
found curled in a suitcase; Zachary, 4, and Sadie, 3, had weights
tied to them.</TE>
<TE>   And, like Morris, Christian Longo fled as authorities charged him
with multiple counts of murder. He was arrested in Tulum, Mexico,
three weeks after the first body drifted to the surface.</TE>
<TE>   The stark parallels between the cases jarred even veteran
investigators. Detectives haven't ruled out the possibility that
Morris could be a Longo copycat, FBI spokeswoman Beth Anne Steele
said. "Our folks have a great familiarity with the Longo case," she
said. "The cases are very similar, with a father who's a suspect in
the murder of his wife and three kids."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI and local agencies familiar with the Longo case rallied
around the Morris investigation and shared information about what
worked -- and what didn't -- a year before. Neither rural department
had ever handled such a large, gruesome case.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators hoped a segment Saturday about Morris on the TV
program "America's Most Wanted" would help break the case, as it did
with Longo.</TE>

<HD>Clinton Takes Bush to Task Over Unemployment Aid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton led Democrats in making political hay out
of the loss of federal aid for hundreds of thousands of unemployed
workers.</LD>
<LD>   As nearly 800,000 unemployed Americans saw their federal jobless
benefits end Saturday, Clinton blamed their financial pain on
President Bush and his fellow Republicans in Congress.</LD>
<LD>   For the unemployed and their families, "this has been a holiday
season filled with too much uncertainty and not enough joy," Clinton
said in the Democrats' weekly radio address. "This year did not have
to end on such a sad note for them."</LD>
<TE>   Since New Yorkers elected Clinton to the Senate two years ago, she
has pursued a low-key agenda of promoting issues important to her
state and of building relationships -- and thus her effectiveness --
in the clubby Senate. Saturday's speech was another step onto the
national stage for the former first lady, who might run for
president.</TE>
<TE>   Aides insist that Clinton does not plan to seek the presidency in
2004, and she has promised to serve her full term, which ends in
2006. But a poll of Democrats released last weekend found she would
lead the field of likely candidates for the party's 2004 presidential
nomination.</TE>
<TE>   Most speculation, however, has centered on a 2008 campaign for
Clinton. Becoming chief advocate on an issue Democrats have targeted
as a winner helps her build a new profile that would be necessary in
any national run.</TE>
<TE>   In the radio address, Clinton contrasted Bush's record on
unemployment benefits with the more generous policies of her
husband's administration.</TE>
<TE>   In the waning days of the just-ended Congress, the
Democratic-controlled Senate approved a $5-billion plan to extend
benefits an additional 13 weeks for people then receiving them or who
were newly eligible. The House passed a more modest $900-million plan
of five extra weeks for workers in a few states with high
unemployment rates.</TE>
<TE>   With lawmakers at an impasse, Bush refused to lend his support to
break the logjam while Congress was in session. On Dec. 14, more than
three weeks after lawmakers left town, Bush asked Congress to enact a
retroactive extension when it resumes work in January.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Clinton looked back to her husband's record: "In the
recession of the early 1990s, we increased benefits five times.
Today, our unemployment rate has soared to 6%, and Congress and the
president have extended benefits only once -- and once is not
enough."</TE>
<TE>   In his radio address Saturday, Bush mentioned that one extension
of federal benefits -- the one that expired Saturday -- as a success
on his watch and asked again for another.</TE>

<HD>Churches Await Trickle-Down Effect From Lottery Winner</HD>
<DH>West Virginia man promised to tithe 10% of his Powerball
prize. Three pastors are in line to split $17 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLESTON, W.Va.</DL>
<LD>One of the Church of God's basic tenets is the tithe -- the donation
of 10% of one's earnings to the parish. In Summers County, where the
median income is $21,147 a year, that doesn't necessarily add up to
big bucks.</LD>
<LD>   But 10% of $170 million -- that's another story.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, two days after Powerball jackpot winner Andrew "Jack"
Whittaker announced plans to donate $17 million to three pastors, two
of the likely recipients said they're excited -- and nervous -- and
are wondering about the details. How will the donations work? Can
they use the money for their own parishes or will it be a fund they
simply administer?</LD>
<TE>   And most fundamentally: Did Whittaker -- who mentioned the places
where his donations would go but not the pastors -- really mean them?</TE>
<TE>   "We'll just have to wait and see what happens," said Bishop Cecil
Welch, the pastor of the parish in Hinton, where Whittaker grew up.</TE>
<TE>   Said C.T. Mathews, senior pastor at the parish in nearby Hurricane
where Whittaker now attends: "The whole world's looking at West
Virginia."</TE>
<TE>   Hinton is a rail-stop town of about 3,000 in Summers County near
the Virginia border. Welch said all of his 50 members tithe to the
church, including Whittaker, whom he has known for 19 years.</TE>
<TE>   Whittaker hasn't contacted Welch since winning Wednesday's
$314.9-million jackpot -- the largest single lottery ticket in U.S.
history -- and Welch declined to speculate in depth. But he said the
parish needs a new gym and an after-school center for its youth.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1886, the Church of God claims 6 million members in 150
countries. Among its principles are evangelism and an individual
experience of God, which can include speaking in tongues.</TE>
<TE>   Whittaker still donates to the Hinton church, though he and his
family attend the Hurricane church. The Whittaker family lives in
Scott Depot.</TE>
<TE>   Mathews said Whittaker hasn't contacted him either. But he said
Whittaker, a millionaire contractor before the lottery hit, already
has been generous in helping the church.</TE>
<TE>   "We know him real well -- real good people," Mathews said. He said
Whittaker's wife, Jewell, teaches at a "children's church" on
Wednesday nights.</TE>
<TE>   Mathews said he wants to create a youth worship center and
Christian school for his church, as well as a day-care center and
drug counseling program for teens. He said any donation would be
welcome.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, it'd help," he said. "If we could get this off the ground,
we'd just be blessed."</TE>
<TE>   The third pastor with ties to Whittaker is Gerald Abreu, for 12
years a pastor in Hurricane and now in Torrance. Abreu couldn't be
reached for comment Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the pastors Whittaker eventually names even get to decide
what to do with the money isn't yet clear.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Whittaker said he intended to give 10% of his
$170-million, single-payment gross winnings to three Church of God
pastors -- one in Hurricane; another at a parish near Jumping Branch,
Whittaker's hometown; and a third in California -- to administer a
fund to help the poor. He didn't give details.</TE>
<TE>   John Auge, who is acting as Whittaker's spokesman, said details
wouldn't begin to be worked out until Monday.</TE>
<TE>   He said that after jetting to New York for media appearances,
Whittaker is back home in West Virginia, resting and "prayerfully"
contemplating his next move.</TE>

<HD>Baggage Scanners Ready for Debut</HD>
<DH>Checked luggage will be screened as of Tuesday. Equipment's
in place but a work in progress.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Air travelers may face more intrusions and inconvenience when the
federal government's requirement to screen all checked luggage goes
into full effect Tuesday, experts in the aviation industry predict.</LD>
<LD>   But massive gridlock appears unlikely because the additional
scrutiny by Transportation Security Administration screeners should
take no more than 10 minutes for most passengers, government and
airport officials said. That should fit within the 90-minute check-in
window that airlines already recommend for travelers with luggage.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it's going to go pretty smoothly," said Kevin Mitchell,
chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, an advocacy group for
passengers. The security agency "got a lot of kudos for its
performance over Thanksgiving, and they have a great incentive not to
let the progress they made slip away."</LD>
<TE>   Travel is usually light around the New Year's holiday, so any
problems with the luggage checks may not emerge until the volume of
passengers picks up. Some airports may prove to be more of a
bottleneck than others. Another uncertainty is the security
administration's lack of a written policy for compensating travelers
if items are lost or damaged during searches.</TE>
<TE>   Although screening all checked luggage with explosive-detection
equipment is a milestone in trying to prevent terrorist attacks,
aviation security is widely expected to remain a work in progress for
years.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the equipment rushed to airports may soon be rendered
obsolete. Research is underway to find technology that is faster,
more accurate and less bulky.</TE>
<TE>   Other changes in the works include a "trusted traveler" program
for those who pass background checks. Also, software developers are
working on an expanded edition of a computerized passenger-profiling
system used to screen reservations.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, after Congress imposed the luggage-screening deadline,
even Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta said it was
unrealistic.</TE>
<TE>   Now, in a major accomplishment for the security agency, most of
the nation's 429 commercial airports will have the bag-screening
equipment installed and operating on time.</TE>
<TE>   Congress recently gave the agency some wiggle room by allowing it
to grant extensions at airports that could not meet the deadline.
These facilities are expected to provide comparable security by using
other measures, such as bomb-sniffing dogs, hand searches and
assurances that a bag gets pulled from the cargo hold if its owner
fails to board the flight.</TE>
<TE>   All airports in Southern California have announced that they will
have new luggage-screening technology ready in time and will not
require any waivers.</TE>
<TE>   Around the country, fewer than 20 airports are expected to receive
extensions, although they are likely to be large facilities such as
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and Denver International
Airport.</TE>
<TE>   The satisfaction of making the deadline may be tempered in coming
years by the cost of replacing much of the equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The security administration "has been so totally engrossed in
meeting their deadlines that they have not taken the time to look for
technology that would let them do the job with fewer people and not
lessen security," said Douglas Laird, an aviation consultant and
former security chief for Northwest Airlines.</TE>
<TE>   Security officials acknowledge that meeting the year-end deadline
will be only a first step, but they say they had no other option.
Lawmakers were not about to grant an across-the-board extension. And
more importantly, the air transportation system remained under the
threat of a terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   James M. Loy, head of the security agency, said that Tuesday is
not the finish line.</TE>
<TE>   "What we want is the next-generation detection capability," Loy
told reporters recently. "I have every expectation that American
ingenuity ... will produce a better mousetrap."</TE>
<TE>   For now, the security administration is relying on two kinds of
technology: CT scanners similar to those used to find tumors in the
human body, and trace detection units that can pick up residues left
by explosives.</TE>
<TE>   The agency plans to install more than 1,000 CT machines, with a
price tag of $1 million apiece, and about 4,600 trace detection
units, at about $45,000 each. The federal government pays for the
machines and their installation, while airports have been covering
the cost of renovations to house the equipment.</TE>
<TE>   CT machines scan the insides of closed bags while an operator
scrutinizes images on a screen to resolve questions about suspicious
items. The trace units measure for explosive residue on a swab that
has been touched to the outside of a closed bag or the contents of an
open one.</TE>
<TE>   Both devices have drawbacks. The minivan-size CT scanners have a
false alarm rate of about 30%. Using trace units, a high proportion
of bags must be opened -- and their contents swabbed -- to ensure a
credible level of deterrence. Last week, the security agency asked
travelers to leave their luggage unlocked to facilitate inspections.</TE>
<TE>   An advantage of the CT scanners is that they can be built into the
luggage conveyor system and require fewer bags to be opened. The
security agency's idea for a long-term solution calls for a system
that can be meshed with the conveyor belts.</TE>
<TE>   At Los Angeles International Airport, both kinds of technology
will be installed in terminal lobbies for now.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an interim solution," said Paul Haney, a spokesman for
the city agency that operates the airport. "In the long term, we are
going to have the in-line solution: equipment that is part of the
conveyor systems."</TE>
<TE>   Because LAX has been targeted for attack by terrorists in the
past, the city decided early that it was important to meet Tuesday's
deadline. Haney estimated that it will cost $162 million to renovate
the conveyor belt system to accommodate future built-in technology.
Most LAX terminals will be ready for the next generation of equipment
by the end of 2003, he said.</TE>
<TE>   New Year's Eve plans for David Stone, federal security director at
LAX, call for him being at the airport. Stone will have 1,400 baggage
screeners ready. He has been studying computer models of how the bag
screening will work, looking for ways to improve efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   The big unknown, he said, is how much time it will take to resolve
questions about suspicious items. "Screeners are going to be real
careful, particularly in the early going," Stone said.</TE>
<TE>   To make the screeners' jobs easier, the agency has asked travelers
to leave gifts unwrapped, avoid packing food in checked luggage,
spread books out instead of stacking them, put shoes on top of other
articles and put personal items in clear bags.</TE>
<TE>   "There are going to be some additional delays. But in the world we
live in today," Stone said, "that seems to be a small price to pay
for [more] security."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Friends, relatives and fellow soldiers gathered Saturday to grieve
for a U.S. paratrooper killed during a firefight in eastern
Afghanistan, with a major general calling him a "servant of our
nation."</LD>
<LD>   Sgt. Steven Checo, 22, of the 82nd Airborne Division, died Dec. 21
from a gunshot wound.</LD>
<LD>   A funeral Mass in Spanish was held at Mother Cabrini Church, not
far from where the child of Dominican immigrants grew up in the
Manhattan neighborhood of Washington Heights. He and his family had
moved to Elizabeth, N.J., about three years ago.</LD>
<TE>   "Not only has he served, but he has given the ultimate sacrifice,
his life, so you and I can be free in this land of ours," Father
Joseph Orlandi told mourners.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Edward Egan also offered a prayer during the Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Checo was honored with a 21-gun salute by uniformed soldiers from
the 82nd Airborne at a cemetery in the Bronx, where his body was to
be cremated. The division commander, Maj. Gen. Chuck Swannack,
presented flags to his mother and father.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a very dedicated, faithful, servant of our nation,"
Swannack said.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't know how proud of him we are," said his brother, Erik.</TE>
<TE>   Checo was the 17th American killed in hostile action in
Afghanistan in the war on terror.</TE>
<TE>   As a boy, he had been active with a Navy-based youth group and
wanted to join the military "from the get-go," said his uncle,
Gilberto Checo. "That was his life."</TE>

<HD>States, White House at Odds on Environment</HD>
<DH>Bush is a big supporter of local control. But officials say
that backing disappears when their regulations buck the desires of
industry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Shogren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>No recent president has been quicker than George W. Bush to embrace
the virtues of state and local control. But when it comes to the
environment, William Becker discovered, that commitment can evaporate
when state regulation would be tougher on industry than federal
rules.</LD>
<LD>   Becker, who represents administrators of state air-pollution
programs in Washington, met with White House officials last month to
appeal to them not to weaken the Clean Air Act.</LD>
<LD>   He used the administration's own rhetoric about the value of local
decision making to support his case. Surely, he said, the
administration would not stand in the way of states that wanted to
enforce tougher clean-air rules on utilities and major polluters.</LD>
<TE>   Wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "My argument was totally ignored," said Becker, executive director
of the State and Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators and
the Assn. of Local Air Pollution Control Officials. "They talk about
states' rights, but they take away key tools states have needed to
clean up the air."</TE>
<TE>   Becker's experience reflects a pattern apparent throughout the
Bush administration's implementation of environmental policy,
according to state officials and environmental activists. When state
and local interests collide with what industry wants, these activists
and officials say, the administration has tossed its states' rights
ideology out the window. "We've seen a dramatic curtailment of
states' rights," Becker said.</TE>
<TE>   The trend does not stop with air pollution. Other, apparently
similar cases include extending oil drilling leases off California's
coast and allowing the mining of clay in Reno to produce cat litter.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials say the decisions result from collisions of
two of the administration's guiding principles, provided by the
nation's Founding Fathers.</TE>
<TE>   "Thomas Jefferson's views of strong states' rights are clearly a
part of the administration's philosophy; we also recognize the value
of Alexander Hamilton's strong central government to promote commerce
and a strong economy," said John Graham, administrator of the office
of regulatory affairs at the White House Office of Management and
Budget. "Balancing those two perspectives is very difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Early in Bush's term, environmental agency officials tried to give
states more control. The EPA asked Congress to shift $25 million
annually from federal to state efforts to enforce pollution laws. And
the Interior Department tried to send $450 million -- half of the
money in its land and water conservation fund -- directly to state
officials to use as they determined best. Congress said no.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials have continued to assert their commitment
to state decision making. In a speech to the National League of
Cities Conference in March, Environmental Protection Agency
Administrator Christie Whitman said: "I believe very strongly -- as
does another former governor, President Bush -- that those closest to
the problem are often best-suited to finding solutions that get
results."</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Interior Department officials say their commitment to
state decision making has guided their hands-off approach to the
conflict among California water agencies over the state's allotment
from the Colorado River.</TE>
<TE>   But when states have made specific requests of the Bush
administration, they have not always received the answer they wanted.</TE>
<TE>   In the recent Clean Air Act case, some states asked for the
authority to either adopt the new national rules or keep their
existing ones. The new national rules give big polluting facilities
more leeway in deciding when they have to install modern
pollution-control devices during major modifications of their
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The administration argues that industries will reduce pollution in
exchange for the new flexibility. California and other states
disagree.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel our rules are better," said Jerry Martin, spokesman for
the California Air Resources Board. "We think that it would be a big
step back to adopt the Bush rules."</TE>
<TE>   The administration required states to adopt the rules or go
through a complicated process to prove their programs are more
effective. But state officials are worried that the EPA will reject
any such efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "Equivalency is in the eye of the beholder," Martin said.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Holmstead, the EPA's assistant administrator for clean
air, called the complaints about the Bush administration usurping
states' prerogatives a "red herring" -- particularly in California's
case.</TE>
<TE>   "California has [an air pollution] program that looks way
different than the rest of the country," Holmstead said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the state's efforts to control air pollution predated
federal regulations, California was given a special right in the
Clean Air Act to chart its own course.</TE>
<TE>   But this year, the administration rejected California's bid for a
waiver from the federal requirement to include an additive, such as
ethanol, in its gasoline to reduce vehicle pollution. The state said
newer refining techniques made ethanol unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   Another conflict over air rules concerned California's "zero
emissions" vehicle program, which was implemented in 1990 in an
effort to put smog-free electric cars on the road. California wanted
to modify the program to reflect the new realities in the auto
industry by giving manufacturers credit for producing hybrid cars --
fueled partly by electricity and partly by gasoline -- that they
could use toward meeting quotas for "zero emissions" vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   In October, the administration sided with DaimlerChrysler and
General Motors Corp. against California in a case before the U.S. 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco challenging the program.
The government argued that granting credits for hybrids preempted the
federal government's sole authority to set fuel-efficiency standards
for automobiles, because the criteria for hybrids are defined in
reference to fuel-economy standards. The case has not been decided.
Martin called this further proof of the administration's refusal to
let California decide for itself how to clean its air.</TE>
<TE>   Graham agreed that, at least in this case, the administration had
given the upper hand to national economic concerns over states'
priorities.</TE>
<TE>   "We are arguing ... on both grounds of law and policy, that it
makes sense to have one set of uniform fuel economy standards for
vehicles," Graham said. "Remember that we see value both in the
opportunity for states to make their own choices and also for the
federal government to promote economic development and jobs through a
single, federal standard."</TE>
<TE>   This is only one of several examples of the administration's going
to court to thwart state initiatives. It has not always succeeded.</TE>
<TE>   The White House has been fighting to overturn a district court
decision that affirmed California's right to review federal proposals
to extend offshore oil leases. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals
early this month upheld the lower-court ruling, effectively blocking
new oil drilling off the California coast in the near future.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the administration occasionally appears to be acting
not out of concern over the potential economic fallout from a
particular decision, but out of fear of a precedent that could have
broad economic consequences.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, they cite a Justice Department friend-of-the-court
brief in support of a lawsuit by the Chicago-based Oil-Dri Corp.
against Washoe County, Nev. The county rejected a permit application
for a project that would allow clay mines on federal land and a
cat-litter processing plant on adjacent private land.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department argued with the company that the county had
overstepped its authority, because the 1872 Mining Act gave the
federal government control of mining on public land.</TE>
<TE>   "They have taken a position in support of the industry's
argument," said Assistant Dist. Atty. Madelyn Shipman.</TE>
<TE>   California has felt the brunt of these decisions because the state
is progressive on environmental protection, environmentalists say.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest clash between California and the Bush administration
may be yet to come. Graham hinted that California's effort to
regulate carbon dioxide from vehicle tailpipes could be next.
California is writing rules that would make it the first in the
nation to regulate greenhouse gases that contribute to global
warming. Graham said that once the regulations are done, it will be
clear whether the federal government will intervene.</TE>

<HD>United Airlines' Union Leaders Back Interim Wage Cuts</HD>
<DH>Troubled carrier's pilots would see pay drop 29%;
attendants would lose 9%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Officials representing United Airlines pilots and flight attendants
said Saturday they would recommend approving temporary pay cuts to
help the troubled carrier slash costs.</LD>
<LD>   Leaders of the Air Line Pilots Assn. met Saturday and approved a
temporary 29% wage cut effective Jan. 1, ALPA spokesman Dave Kelly
said.</LD>
<LD>   The Assn. of Flight Attendants will recommend that its members
ratify a 9% interim wage cut also effective Jan. 1, association
spokeswoman Sara Dela Cruz said.</LD>
<TE>   The unions are scrambling to preserve their contracts following
United's motion filed Friday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court to scrap its
labor contracts if it fails to reach voluntary wage concessions.</TE>
<TE>   The unions have until Jan. 8 to approve the voluntary wage cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "Once again, our pilots have taken extraordinary steps today of
significant wage concessions -- taking more than our fair share of
the pain -- as part of their commitment to helping the company and
securing its future," said Paul Whiteford, chairman of United's ALPA
unit, which represents the carrier's 9,000 pilots.</TE>
<TE>   Whiteford said he expected a difficult period of negotiations as
United works with its unions on a long-term recovery plan.</TE>
<TE>   United, an Elk Grove Village, Ill.-based unit of UAL Corp., said
Friday it had reached tentative agreements with unions representing
its pilots, flight attendants, dispatchers and metrologists.</TE>
<TE>   The No. 2 U.S. airline said it would ask a judge to enforce pay
cuts on the International Assn. of Machinists, which has yet to agree
to cuts.</TE>
<TE>   The airline is seeking a 13% pay cut from machinists, about twice
the amount it had sought before filing for Chapter 11 on Dec. 9, the
largest bankruptcy in aviation history.</TE>
<TE>   United needs wage cuts from employees to meet the terms of its
$1.5-billion loan agreement to help the airline emerge from
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Four large institutions have provided the carrier with an initial
$800 million to help it operate while in bankruptcy. But it must meet
specific cash flow targets by Feb. 15 to receive an additional $700
million in financing.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a temporary agreement to give United the financial relief
it needs to meet its [loan] covenants and at the same time allows us
to better preserve our jobs and quality of life," Dela Cruz said.
"It's the best of two bad choices."</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Al Jazeera, the Arab satellite television channel known to broadcast
statements from Osama bin Laden, will reach out to the West starting
in February with an English-language Web site.</LD>
<LD>   "It will be original news in English tailored to a Western
audience. We are very conscious of our pole position in world media
terms at the moment," Joanne Tucker, managing editor of Al Jazeera's
English-language Web site, said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Al Jazeera -- based in the tiny Gulf Arab state of Qatar -- began
broadcasting in 1996, bringing scrutiny to governments in the Middle
East where many of the region's news outlets are under some form of
official control.</LD>
<TE>   It started the Arabic Web site http://www.aljazeera.net in January
2001, offering news, analysis, video clips and programming from the
channel. About 39% of the Arabic Internet site's visitors come from
North America and Europe, according to the Web site.</TE>
<TE>   The English Web site is set to be the first step in the network's
English-language plans, which could include an English-language
television channel, Tucker said.</TE>
<TE>   Plans to begin operating the English-language Web service were in
place even before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United
States, Tucker said.</TE>

<HD>New Warship's Bow May Have WTC Steel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ALBANY, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Steel salvaged from the wreckage of the World Trade Center was headed
to a Mississippi shipyard Saturday to possibly become part of the bow
of the USS New York, a warship named in honor of those who perished
in the Sept. 11 terrorist attack.</LD>
<LD>   It was the Navy's idea to incorporate the steel into the vessel,
said Capt. Kevin Wensing, a Navy public affairs officer in
Washington.</LD>
<LD>   He said the steel was removed Friday from the New York landfill
that holds much of the debris from the twin towers and was being
shipped to the Northrop Grumman shipyard at Pascagoula, Miss., where
construction of the warship is to begin next year.</LD>
<TE>   The USS New York will be the fifth of 12 amphibious assault ships
in the San Antonio class, which the Navy calls one of its most
technologically innovative. The 684-foot vessel will carry a crew of
402 and up to 800 Marines.</TE>
<TE>   If the trade center scrap meets specifications, it will be melted
down and used to configure the leading edge of the ship's bow, said
Northrop Grumman spokesman Jim McIngdale.</TE>
<TE>   The $800-million vessel should be ready for active duty in 2007.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very proud that the twisted steel from the WTC towers will
soon be used to forge an even stronger national defense," New York
Gov. George Pataki said.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, only submarines are given state names, but New York
officials lobbied Navy Secretary Gordon England to make an exception.</TE>
<TE>   The structural steel, primarily from a section of beam about 20
feet long and weighing 20 to 30 tons, was part of the wreckage taken
across New York Harbor to the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island
after the Sept. 11 attack. It is believed to have been part of the
south tower, the second of the twin skyscrapers hit by airliners
hijacked by terrorists but the first to collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 2,800 people died in the trade center attack.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the structural steel from the towers already has been sold
for scrap.</TE>
<TE>   Other Navy ships have been named USS New York or USS New York
City. The most recent USS New York was a battleship, commissioned in
1914, that fought in the Atlantic and Pacific during World War II.</TE>

<HD>N. Korea Shows Its Bluster Is No Bluff</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Demick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>For people with the unenviable task of deciphering what is regarded
as one of the world's most impenetrable countries, the question of
the moment is: How far will North Korea go?</LD>
<LD>   Until a few days ago, the conventional wisdom here was that the
foundering Communist government was engaged in elaborate bluff over
its nuclear arms program designed to pull the United States into a
dialogue and extract more aid from Washington. After all, the North
Koreans are famous for an idiosyncratic negotiating style in which
they try to solve a crisis by creating another one.</LD>
<LD>   But their decision Friday to expel U.N. nuclear inspectors and
their declaration that they intend to reopen a lab where plutonium
can be reprocessed for use in weapons suggests that they are deadly
serious about making an atomic bomb.</LD>
<TE>   "They have a multi-pronged approach. Their initial hope is to
negotiate with the United States, but if that doesn't work or if the
negotiations go badly and things escalate, they will become a nuclear
power," said Kim Tae Woo, an arms control expert with the Korea
Institute for Defense Analyses in Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   The speed at which the government in Pyongyang is plowing ahead
with its nuclear program has astonished even veteran North Korea
watchers. From the time the North Koreans declared their intention to
restart the program, Dec. 12, only 10 days elapsed before they
removed U.N. seals and disabled surveillance cameras that had been in
place to enforce a freeze agreed to eight years ago. Four days later,
they were seen loading fresh fuel rods into their only completed
nuclear reactor, a 5-megawatt, Soviet-designed plant in Yongbyon, a
secretive nuclear complex 55 miles north of Pyongyang, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, North Korea notified the U.N. International Atomic
Energy Agency that it was booting out inspectors monitoring the
freeze, and on Saturday it declared the expulsion would take place
Tuesday -- the earliest possible date, since there are only two
flights weekly out of North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "They are working at extreme speeds. There is no reason to believe
that the North Koreans will give the United States the luxury of
time. If they waited, they feel they would be strung out and ignored
and that they would be assumed to be too chicken to cross the lines,"
said Peter Hayes, head of the Nautilus Institute in Berkeley, which
specializes in energy issues in North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   The North Koreans' admission in October to U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State James A. Kelly that they had a plan to secretly
enrich uranium for use in nuclear weapons was cause for
consternation, but not undue alarm because uranium enrichment --
which requires thousands of gas centrifuges -- is a slow, painstaking
process.</TE>
<TE>   Their decision to reopen the 5-megawatt reactor was more
troubling, but again not cause for panic because the reactor will
take at least a few months to restart and at least another year
before its fuel rods could be used for bomb making.</TE>
<TE>   The real crisis -- and one which could be only a few days in the
making -- is the reopening of a chemical reprocessing plant whose
sole function is to extract weapons-grade plutonium out of fuel rods
from the reactor.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea already has about 8,000 spent fuel rods containing
highly radioactive material ideal for that purpose. Under the 1994
deal that froze Pyongyang's nuclear program, the fuel rods were
safely stored in a cooling pond under 24-hour surveillance by remote
TV monitors and inspectors. But with the cameras disabled and the
inspectors on their way out, there is little to stop North Koreans
from taking the next step.</TE>
<TE>   "To restart the 5-megawatt reactor will create enough alarm....
But if they try to reprocess the spent fuel, that will create a very
serious crisis," said Chun Yung Woo, an officer in South Korea's
Foreign Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   Hayes agreed: "The real fast track for them is not the research
reactor; that is just a game they are playing. The real fast track is
to take out the fuel rods and put them in the reprocessing plant. If
they do that, they are really calling a three-alarm fire."</TE>
<TE>   Given the rapid pace of recent weeks, it appears likely that the
North Koreans will go as far as they can to produce a nuclear bomb or
perhaps to add to an existing arsenal. The CIA believes North Korea
had already produced one or two nuclear weapons before the 1994
freeze, although it is unclear whether it has the technical know-how
to mount them on a missile.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea's long-range Taepodong missile can easily reach Japan
-- as was terrifyingly evident in 1998 when Pyongyang test-fired one
over Japanese territory. U.S. intelligence officials believe that
North Korea is developing a multistage missile capable of reaching
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they are bluffing. They feel they are fighting for
their lives, and if they are going to go down, they want to take
everyone with them," said Cho Myong Chol, a North Korean economist
who defected to South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea watchers say the paranoid regime fully believes the
United States is bent on toppling it and is seeking guarantees for
its survival, even asking Washington for a nonaggression pact.
Pyongyang wants to negotiate directly with United States. The 1994
agreement that froze the North's nuclear program in exchange for
energy assistance was a treaty between North Korea and the United
States, although South Korea, Japan and the European Union are
helping to pay for the program.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the Bush administration has resolutely refused bilateral
talks with North Korea, saying it will not succumb to nuclear
blackmail. U.S. officials say the administration will refer the
matter to the U.N. in an attempt to build an international effort to
isolate and contain North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Pinkston, a North Korea specialist at the Institute for
Nonproliferation Studies in Monterey, said that strategy is likely to
accelerate the downward spiral of relations.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to make North Korea want to get those nukes even
faster," he said.</TE>

<HD>Strategy Against Iraq Calls For Swift Attack</HD>
<DH>A Pentagon battle plan begins with intense airstrikes, then
a ground assault on key targets. The focus shifts to Hussein's power
base.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Esther Schrader</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>With its decision to deploy 25,000 U.S.-based troops to the Persian
Gulf region, the Pentagon is implementing a plan for a possible war
with Saddam Hussein that calls for the rapid unleashing of massive
air power backed by light, mobile ground forces trained to penetrate
quickly into the heart of Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   The deployment orders, sent out last week, call for readying five
wings of powerful fighter jets, B-1B Lancers capable of carrying
scores of bombs at a time, Predator drones and two aircraft carrier
battle groups. The orders come even as U.N. weapons inspectors are
stepping up their searches for any evidence that Iraq retains banned
weapons.</LD>
<LD>   "It shows that, following the holidays, the U.N. inspections can
be expected to get more serious and the U.S. buildup can be expected
to get more immediate and with more of the direct combat forces
flowing in," said Benjamin Works, executive director of the Strategic
Issues Research Institute, a think tank.</LD>
<TE>   "I think you can expect a very rapid ground campaign," Works said.
"The geography allows it, the scenario dictates it, and the forces we
are moving are tailored for this kind of maneuver."</TE>
<TE>   The plan also is designed to signal how solid the Bush
administration's resolve is to unseat Hussein from power, a senior
military official said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is significant. It involves multiple air, land and sea
assets. And Iraq should make no mistake about our intentions," the
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   In Crawford, Texas, President Bush in his weekly radio address
Saturday repeated his warning that the U.S. will confront Hussein
head-on. "The United Nations Security Council has unanimously
affirmed that Saddam Hussein is a danger to his neighbors and to the
peace of the world," Bush said. "The burden now is on Iraq's dictator
to disclose and destroy his arsenal of weapons. If he refuses, then
for the sake of peace, the United States will lead a coalition to
disarm the Iraqi regime and free the Iraqi people."</TE>
<TE>   With thousands of land, sea and air troops at bases across the
country preparing this weekend to leave their homes and families, the
brinkmanship that has played out between the U.S. and Iraq for 11
years appeared to be edging closer than ever to war. The deployment
order calls for moving the troops out over the next few weeks, with
the first leaving just after New Year's.</TE>
<TE>   The selection of five wings of warplanes and bombers shows that
the U.S. is readying its major air assets for a large-scale bombing
campaign designed to wipe out Iraqi air defenses in the first days of
a campaign, military analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   And the apparent absence of heavy armored divisions among the
ground troops being deployed probably means that war strategists have
decided on a plan that calls for crippling Hussein's command by
striking Baghdad and key targets first.</TE>
<TE>   Such a strike could be launched quickly, starting with intense and
focused air attacks on a scale that would dwarf the air campaigns in
the 1991 Persian Gulf War and recently in Afghanistan, according to
military officials and analysts. That would be followed by a combined
airborne and ground assault on strategic targets, with lightly
equipped ground troops advancing rapidly from Kuwait, where the U.S.
already has positioned significant troops and equipment, to Baghdad.
Such a campaign would require 70,000 to 100,000 troops, they say.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the 1991 attack, which primarily targeted Iraqi military
assets and troops, the plan would seek to decapitate the Iraqi
government by hitting Hussein's institutional power base, including
presidential palaces, military and security police facilities and
bases. Particular attention would be given to Hussein's hometown of
Tikrit, while targets such as bridges and other infrastructure
targets would be avoided.</TE>
<TE>   As many as 250,000 soldiers, Marines, airmen and sailors could
eventually be deployed to the region under the plan, but many ground
troops would be held back at bases in Turkey, Kuwait and Qatar as
reserve forces in case the initial invasion met unexpected
resistance.</TE>
<TE>   "They're deploying enough air power to start the war, but still
not enough ground forces to finish the war, so to me this confirms
that they think of this as a sequenced operation," said Owen Cote,
associate director of the security studies program at MIT. "When this
war kicks off, all the forces needed to finish the war are not going
to be there."</TE>
<TE>   The ground campaign would start in Kuwait, but avoid getting
bogged down in southeastern Iraq, in the spongy marshland between the
Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Instead, the main force would advance
toward Baghdad through the desert that covers western Iraq and much
of the south.</TE>
<TE>   "What you're seeing is a very, very competent military doing what
a competent military does," said Harlan Ullman, a military analyst at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "It is preparing
for the possibility of an all-out campaign to end the regime of
Saddam Hussein and at least the destruction of his weapons of mass
destruction programs, no more, no less."</TE>
<TE>   It is Iraqi air defenses that pose among the thorniest problems
for war planners casing out options for attacking Iraq. Since 1991,
Hussein has vastly improved his air defenses, particularly those
around Baghdad, installing mobile radars on truck beds, smuggling
high-technology missile systems into the country from other nations,
and building a fiber-optic network that has greatly improved his
military's communications capability.</TE>
<TE>   "Since you can't smash up the Iraqi infrastructure, because you're
looking to liberate the people, then what you have to do is destroy
the air defenses, the command and control facilities, the
intelligence capabilities, in rapid fire," Works said. "And then you
need to move so fast to unseat Saddam that he doesn't have time to
mount a credible urban defense."</TE>
<TE>   As the military prepares for a potential conflict, deployment
orders are putting a damper on New Year's celebrations in military
towns across the country. When the movements are completed, the
Pentagon will have positioned about half of the 50,000 troops
officials previously had indicated would be moving to the region.
They will join about 57,000 troops in position.</TE>
<TE>   "These men and women could be over there till it's over, and that
could be a long time. And if the administration does not initiate
military operations sooner, then there's no telling how long they
could be on station," Ullman said. "So the uncertainties on the home
front to which there are no answers are extraordinary."</TE>

<HD>4 Killed, 18 Injured in Residential Hotel Fire</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An early morning fire in a downtown San Bernardino residential hotel
Saturday killed four men, including the building manager, who armed
himself with a fire extinguisher and rode the elevator up into the
center of the third-floor inferno.</LD>
<LD>   Firefighters responding to a 12:55 a.m. call from the Sunset Hotel
said they witnessed their "worst nightmare" as about 20 people, one
dangling a baby, screamed for help from third-story windows on all
sides of the U-shaped building. A few looked as if they were
preparing to jump.</LD>
<LD>   "You pull up and you are looking at 20 to 25 people who are going
to die if you don't do something very quickly," said Battalion Chief
Mike Alder, among the first to arrive. Residents, he said, "had
absolute terror in their eyes, absolute terror."</LD>
<TE>   It took firefighters about 15 minutes to pull people to safety and
extinguish the blaze, which started in a 32-gallon plastic trash can
next to the third-floor elevator. But in the meantime, temperatures
in the hallway and in some rooms rose to an estimated 1,000 to 1,800
degrees, melting smoke detectors and other fixtures, fire officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We know the fire started in the trash can, but how is something
we are still investigating," Alder said. "There are two
possibilities, like a cigarette, or it was intentionally set."</TE>
<TE>   Eighteen tenants were injured, four critically, all suffering from
smoke inhalation.</TE>
<TE>   The building had a recent history of fire code violations, but all
had been corrected by November, city officials said. Since August,
two fires had broken out in third-floor trash cans near the elevator.
They were quickly extinguished, but the cause could not be
determined.</TE>
<TE>   The body of the building manager, identified by family members and
friends as Bob Downs, 49, was found lying on the third floor,
straddling the threshold of the open elevator door with a fire
extinguisher by his side.</TE>
<TE>   "He probably took one breath and it was over," Alder said.</TE>
<TE>   Eighty firefighters responded to the stucco building in the city's
downtown core, about 60 miles east of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   City officials described the hotel, where rents range from $425 to
$500 a month, as a "place of last resort" for formerly homeless and
low-income families and some with drug, alcohol or mental health
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Residents on the first and second floors of the 111-unit building
were able to escape down the stairs. But most on the third floor
faced the real horrors of the blaze, unable to flee through the fiery
hallway.</TE>
<TE>   Many said their screeching smoke detectors first alerted them to
danger. Creston Lewis, 26, his girlfriend and a neighbor were quickly
trapped inside their rooms by smoke and fire.</TE>
<TE>   "My girlfriend opened the door and, before I could close it, our
neighbor came plowing in, covered in soot," Lewis said. Within
minutes, the smoke was so intense that he was crouching on the floor,
trying to breathe.</TE>
<TE>   "I decided I'm either going to die here or try and get to the
window," he said, choosing to make a run for it in the pitch-black
room. "My neighbor was hanging out of it. I grabbed her to keep her
from falling -- screaming and hollering for help. I was about ready
to pass out from fatigue."</TE>
<TE>   His rescue was shaky. Firefighters wanted Lewis to exit feet
first, but it was hard for the exhausted, gagging man to get a grip
on the window. "I managed to get my feet out and took it step by step
going down" the ladder, he said. "There was commotion on the ground.
Nobody knew who got out and who didn't."</TE>
<TE>   The three tenants who died had all tried to escape through the
hallway, fire officials believe. One man was found lying in the
corridor. The other two had apparently opened their doors, allowing a
deadly gust of heat and smoke to blast inside, fire officials said.
"If they didn't go into the hallway, they had time," said Battalion
Chief Allen Simpson.</TE>
<TE>   Victoria Dodd, 15, the mother of a 7-month-old baby, said the heat
was so intense inside their small third-floor unit that she and
family members, including three other children, splashed water on
their faces to breathe as they waved desperately for help from the
window. "I was crying for my grandmother in another third-floor room.
She's in a wheelchair ... she made it out," Dodd said. "I have no
food, no formula, no clothes," she said, adding that she could still
"smell the fire all over" her body.</TE>
<TE>   Dodd escaped in jeans and a T-shirt. Others were rescued from
their windows in nightclothes and were later given sweatsuits and
shoes by the Red Cross, which opened an emergency shelter at San
Bernardino High School. About 100 people were left homeless, and were
being temporarily housed, either in the shelter or in local motels.</TE>
<TE>   The building, which is about 40 years old, did not have
sprinklers, being exempt because of its age from a law that requires
sprinklers in new apartments and hotels, city officials said. The
fire was contained to the third floor of the building, causing about
$100,000 damage.</TE>
<TE>   Downs, the building manager, had celebrated his 49th birthday
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Harvey Cohen, who attended San Bernardino High with Downs, said
his friend had struggled with "terrible life problems, some medical,
some substance abuse." He described Downs as a "matter-of-fact guy, a
burly guy with a tough hide.... Knowing Bob, he would have not left
that building until everyone was out."</TE>
<TE>   The San Bernardino County coroner has identified all but one of
the victims, but because their families had not yet been notified
their names were not released Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the 18 injured were in critical condition at Loma Linda
University Medical Center, where they were being treated for smoke
inhalation. One is a 73-year-old man and the other is a 44-year-old
man. Two more people were taken to Arrowhead Regional Medical Center
in Colton, where they remained in critical condition on ventilators.
The rest were still being treated for minor injuries or had been
released. Other victims were taken to St. Bernadine Medical Center in
San Bernardino or Community Hospital of San Bernardino. Five of the
victims with minor injuries were children.</TE>
<TE>   The Fire Department last inspected the building and all its rooms
on July 30, said San Bernardino City Fire Marshal Doug Dupree. The
department found that some fire alarms were not working, and not
enough smoke detectors had been installed.</TE>
<TE>   The owner, Siegfried D. Faucette, corrected the violations within
24 hours, Dupree said.</TE>
<TE>   Faucette also was ordered to install no-smoking signs inside the
building, which some people ignored, several residents said Saturday.
They said they often found cigarette butts ground into the carpet.
Faucette could not be reached for comment Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   City Atty. James F. Penman said he spoke with Faucette at the
site, and described him as grief-stricken over the deaths, especially
that of the manager. Penman said officials believe smoke detectors
and the fire alarm system were in working order.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Faucette had complied with a Fire Department order to
install heavy, solid-wood doors designed to be more fire-safe than
the building's previous plywood doors. Officials credit those doors
with saving lives. "They were installed just in the nick of time, "
Penman said.</TE>

<HD>Many States Face Gloomy Budget Choices</HD>
<DH>Despite months of steep cost-cutting, the worst is yet to
come. A Virginia prosecutor is seeking corporate sponsors for certain
types of cases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephanie Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Struggling through their worst financial crisis in half a century,
states are freeing prisoners, closing libraries, hiking college
tuition, even halting prosecution of abusive spouses as legislators
scramble to plug budget gaps that seem to widen by the day.</LD>
<LD>   Ambitious initiatives to subsidize health insurance and child care
for minimum-wage workers, to reduce class sizes, to train welfare
recipients for jobs, have been put on hold or sharply cut back in
state after state, from California to New Jersey, Minnesota to
Florida.</LD>
<LD>   And the outlook for the new year is grimmer still.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think there's any way around it. People are definitely
going to be hurt," said Colorado state Sen. Penfield Tate, a
Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   As governors prepare to release their budgets next month for the
upcoming fiscal year, many find themselves needing to cut the
equivalent of an entire year's spending on prisons, welfare and
transportation combined. And that's after 18 months of frantic
cost-cutting to bring the 2001 and 2002 budgets in line.</TE>
<TE>   At least a dozen states face deficits equal to 15% or more of
their annual budgets. In a few states, California among them, the
deficit could be 25% of the budget.</TE>
<TE>   Most rainy-day reserve funds are bare, or close to it. Several
states have even used up future revenue, selling off the payments
they are scheduled to receive from tobacco companies over the next
two decades for a lump sum of up-front cash.</TE>
<TE>   But such maneuvers go only so far. States are facing a collective
deficit of at least $60 billion for the 2003 fiscal year, which
begins July 1.</TE>
<TE>   Governors in Arkansas, Connecticut, Nevada, New York and here in
Missouri are trying to prepare the public for various tax increases.
Already in the last year, Tennessee has raised its sales tax,
Massachusetts has reinstated a levy on capital gains and North
Carolina has stepped up collection of corporate taxes by closing
loopholes. In addition, at least 17 states have raised levies on
cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   All told, changes in tax law for the current fiscal year raised
$6.7 billion for the 50 states. This is the first year since 1994
that state taxes collectively showed a net increase, according to
Stateline.org, which monitors legislation nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   But newly elected governors in half a dozen hard-hit states are
determined to stick with campaign pledges to hold the line on further
tax hikes. That leaves them no choice but to cut spending. Yet the
most obvious waste and the least popular programs have already been
axed.</TE>
<TE>   "There just are no easy choices left," said Raymond C. Scheppach,
executive director of the National Governors Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "These cuts will have quite a bit greater impact than any we've
seen before," added Ed Penhale of the Washington state budget office.
"It's health care. It's education. These are cuts where they hurt the
most."</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the crisis is clear: Two-thirds of the states report
declining revenues.</TE>
<TE>   Many budget directors woefully miscalculated their tax receipts
this fiscal year on the assumption that the economy would revive. As
workers lost jobs, personal income taxes came in 13% lower than
forecast. As businesses struggled to stay afloat, corporate taxes
came in a staggering 22% under projections, according to the
governors association.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the loss stems from the major tax cuts that 43 states
enacted in the boom years of the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank,
estimates that the cuts are costing states a collective $40 billion a
year.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the cost of health care continues to soar. Spending on
Medicaid -- the joint federal and state health insurance program for
the poor -- grew more than 13% this fiscal year, the fastest rate of
growth in a decade. In response, at least 11 states -- California
among them -- have proposed eliminating subsidized health coverage
for hundreds of thousands of low-income residents.</TE>
<TE>   The cutoffs vary from state to state, but those scheduled to lose
insurance include some senior citizens with incomes as low as $6,560
a year and some parents earning as little as $9,200 a year. In
Tennessee alone, advocates expect nearly 270,000 people will lose
their subsidized insurance -- most of them "working poor" parents
earning perhaps $6 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   "At the office today, I must have taken calls from 30 people who
were terminated from the program and didn't find out until they went
to the pharmacy to try to pick up their medications," said Tony Garr,
director of the Tennessee Health Care Campaign, an advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how we can live with ourselves, with some of the
cuts we're talking about making," added Rick Carter, president of
Care Providers of Minnesota, a trade association for nursing homes.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that sounds like a lobbyist talking," Carter said. "And,
yeah, I am a lobbyist. But on the other hand, I've never seen it
quite like this before."</TE>
<TE>   "It's the most difficult situation states have faced in a long
time," agreed Bill Pound, director of the National Conference of
State Legislatures.</TE>
<TE>   The Virginia state treasury is so pinched that prosecutor Harvey
Bryant is appealing to corporations to sponsor some of the legal work
he can no longer afford to do, such as prosecute misdemeanor domestic
violence cases. Police will still take such assaults to court, but
they won't have any legal help from Bryant's office, unless a private
donor steps forward.</TE>
<TE>   "We could have the Nike Domestic Violence Prosecutor. Though we'd
have to change their slogan to 'Just Don't Do It,' I guess," said
Bryant, who serves the city of Virginia Beach, where about 2,200
offenders are charged with domestic abuse misdemeanors each year.</TE>
<TE>   His tone sobered. "We're going to have to get creative, all of us,
in all these states facing budget deficits," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Wisconsin, several college campuses have moved to reduce
student enrollment next fall by as much as 15% in anticipation of
drastic state cuts. In Kansas, about 31,000 senior citizens will be
cut from a program offering free meals.</TE>
<TE>   Massachusetts trimmed $2 million from the budget by cutting back
on flu vaccines. Alabama may reprise a cost-saving measure from last
year: suspending jury trials.</TE>
<TE>   In Michigan, legislators hope to save money by eliminating tough
sentencing laws that required certain drug offenders to remain behind
bars at least a decade.</TE>
<TE>   In Oregon, prosecutors will stop handling minor crimes, such as
shoplifting.</TE>
<TE>   And in Kentucky, Gov. Paul Patton commuted the sentences of 567
low-level felons -- from drug traffickers to burglars to repeat drunk
drivers -- springing them from prisons just before Christmas to save
the state money.</TE>
<TE>   Here in Missouri, lawmakers plan to end health-care coverage for
36,000 low-income parents. Appropriations for higher education also
face deep cuts, forcing the University of Missouri to raise tuition
8.4% and to add a $9-per-credit-hour surcharge. The university system
also has eliminated at least 400 faculty and staff positions,
canceled some courses and deferred campus maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   "It adds up to death by a thousand cuts," said Joe Moore, a
university spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Much smaller programs are also being squeezed. Places for People,
a nonprofit agency serving the mentally ill, has lost nearly $100,000
in state grants over the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Director Francie Broderick has stopped sending outreach workers to
contact the homeless. And she has to turn away many of the desperate
people who knock at her St. Louis office each week, seeking help.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to refer them elsewhere, but the truth is, every place has
a waiting list," Broderick said.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell them to emphasize that they're a danger to themselves or
others, so they can get to the top of the list. Just being alone and
miserable is not enough to get you services anymore. Not in this
climate."</TE>

<LD>When UCLA went shopping for a football coach this month,
administrators at the university found themselves in a predicament.</LD>
<LD>   They could offer a high-profile job, a team steeped in tradition
and a scenic campus. But the $600,000 salary wasn't sufficient to
lure an established coach from another school.</LD>
<LD>   May we show you something in a coordinator? Perhaps an
up-and-coming assistant?</LD>
<TE>   The new economics of college football are such that every team in
this week's major bowl games -- the Fiesta, Rose, Orange and Sugar --
pays its coach at or near $1 million a season, if not twice that
much.</TE>
<TE>   Salaries are being pushed ever higher by the so-called "arms race"
that has rival athletic departments spending tens of millions on
everything from Heisman Trophy campaigns to new weight rooms and
enlarged stadiums.</TE>
<TE>   When seven figures is the benchmark for a veteran coach -- and
anything less seems like bargain hunting -- questions arise: Can a
high-priced hire generate the revenue to justify his salary? What
does all this spending say about the financial health and sanity of
the game?</TE>
<TE>   Even Joe Castiglione, the Oklahoma athletic director who paid
Coach Bob Stoops $2 million to lead the Sooners to the Rose Bowl, is
alarmed by the volatility of the marketplace.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as one institution makes a move, other institutions feel
like they need to follow suit," he said. "It almost seems like a
bidding process."</TE>
<TE>   Or a feeding frenzy.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as the early 1990s, no coach made $1 million. Then
three men -- Florida State's Bobby Bowden, former Florida Coach Steve
Spurrier and former Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz -- neared or exceeded
that mark and the paradigm shifted.</TE>
<TE>   Now, more than 20 football coaches at large Division I schools
have moved into the seven-figure neighborhood. The same thing has
happened in basketball.</TE>
<TE>   That was too rich for UCLA, so Athletic Director Dan Guerrero
focused on candidates with lesser track records who fit his $600,000
budget. He settled on Denver Bronco assistant Karl Dorrell.</TE>
<TE>   The same week, Texas A&amp;M spent $1.5 million to $2 million to lure
Dennis Franchione from Alabama. The Crimson Tide filled its vacancy
by luring Mike Price from Washington State for a reported $1.5
million a year.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're not willing to pay, you're not going to have a shot at
the successful and established coaches," said Jeremy Foley, the
Florida athletic director who gave $2 million to Spurrier and still
couldn't keep him from jumping to the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   Marquee hires are "a safe decision, and not necessarily a bad
one," Foley said. "If you hire an established guy, that's an easier
sell to the fans."</TE>
<TE>   It can also make sense in terms of dollars and cents, said Rick
Burton, director of the Warsaw Sports Marketing Center at the
University of Oregon, where Coach Mike Bellotti belongs to the
million-dollar club.</TE>
<TE>   Burton said escalating salaries are a function of the market.</TE>
<TE>   "There are guys out there who are winning and getting paid only
$300,000," he said. "But there are also guys getting $1 million and
their performance is measurable in a lot of tangible ways."</TE>
<TE>   A winning team boosts ticket sales, endorsement contracts and
television money. Experts believe -- but cannot prove -- that alumni
and boosters are more likely to donate.</TE>
<TE>   Harder to gauge is the "Flutie Factor," a controversial theory
that originated in 1984 when Boston College quarterback Doug Flutie
defeated Miami with a long final-play touchdown pass on national
television and his school subsequently experienced a surge in student
applications.</TE>
<TE>   This line of reasoning suggests that a coach who wins "might have
the ability to pay for himself very quickly," Burton said.</TE>
<TE>   The equation appears to work for the 40 athletic departments in
Division I that have seen their average annual profit rise from $3.8
million to $5.3 million in two years, according to a National
Collegiate Athletic Assn. report.</TE>
<TE>   "The revenue from our football team is much greater than the
expense," Oklahoma's Castiglione said. "The net amount allows us to
fund other programs that cannot make it on their own."</TE>
<TE>   Perspective Check</TE>
<TE>   But there is a flip side to the story.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure I agree with the concept that coaches deserve $1
million," said Daniel Fulks, accounting program director at
Transylvania University in Lexington, Ky. "That's more than [twice]
what we pay the president of the United States and probably five
times what we pay the president of the university."</TE>
<TE>   Each year, Fulks compiles the NCAA's Revenues and Expenses for
Intercollegiate Athletics Programs report. In 2001, he found that
while those 40 athletic departments prospered, 74 others operated at
an average deficit of $3.8 million. Almost 30% of football programs
were likewise in the red.</TE>
<TE>   At these schools, salaries and benefits consumed more than a
quarter of the athletic budget.</TE>
<TE>   Such spending represents a "fundamental corruption" of higher
education, said a 2001 report from a high-powered commission.</TE>
<TE>   "A college provost points out that his school spent more money
hiring the head football coach than it did hiring five department
heads -- combined," the Knight Foundation's Commission on
Intercollegiate Athletics stated.</TE>
<TE>   Or, in the case of Iowa Coach Kirk Ferentz, who will receive $1.6
million for leading his team to the Orange Bowl against USC on
Thursday, 15 times what the governor of his state earns.</TE>
<TE>   There is additional concern about the gap between haves and
have-nots. While some universities with $1 billion-plus budgets can
afford to boost spending, others cannot -- or will not -- keep pace.</TE>
<TE>   Within the University of California system, chancellors have been
reluctant to let their athletic directors get caught up in the arms
race.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're in a situation that Cal or UCLA is in, the
multimillion-dollar coaches are not in your scope," California
Athletic Director Steve Gladstone said. "It's incumbent on those
athletic directors to be more creative. You're forced into more of a
discovery mode."</TE>
<TE>   Hiring an unproven commodity can by tricky. Gladstone hit the
jackpot when he spent $600,000 on Jeff Tedford, an Oregon assistant
who took over at Cal, led the Golden Bears to a 7-5 record and was
named Pacific 10 Conference coach of the year. "To discover someone
is enormously satisfying," Gladstone said.</TE>
<TE>   The results have not been as rewarding at nearby Stanford, where
the Cardinal also hired an up-and-coming assistant, Buddy Teevens,
and struggled this season.</TE>
<TE>   Even if a gamble pays off, schools often pay dearly to keep a
winning coach.</TE>
<TE>   At Oklahoma, Stoops began at $675,000 in 1999 before zooming up
the pay scale. It took one good season for Cal to renegotiate
Tedford's contract to an unspecified amount closer to $1 million.
Foley went through the process -- at a pricier level -- trying to
keep Spurrier at Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "If you lose a highly successful coach over dollars, you have to
spend money to find another one," he said. "If he doesn't work out,
you have to pay him and start over. You could end up spending even
more money."</TE>
<TE>   The dollars have, to some extent, changed the nature of the job.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Coach Mark Richt, whose contract was renegotiated from
$800,000 to $1.5 million on Thursday, said: "If someone gave me more
money, they shouldn't expect me to work any harder because I'm
already working hard."</TE>
<TE>   But they might ask him to wedge more duties into his day. In an
effort to recoup their investment, athletic directors shepherd
coaches through weekly television shows, endorsement responsibilities
and booster functions.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of this job is to promote the program and the university and
you fund-raise as well," said USC Coach Pete Carroll, who earns more
than $1 million. "I get called on to do a lot of stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Running a Reverse</TE>
<TE>   There have been attempts to reverse this mega-buck trend.</TE>
<TE>   When Iowa State gave its basketball coach a lucrative contract two
years ago, state Rep. Ed Fallon introduced legislation to limit
athletic salaries at state schools but received little support. In
the late 1990s, when the NCAA capped salaries for assistants, a
federal jury ruled it had violated antitrust laws and the association
paid a $54.5-million settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, I think the only way you can get it to stop is to
get an antitrust exemption from Congress," Fulks said.</TE>
<TE>   With all this talk of revenues and expenses, it might seem like
coaching has become more about the bottom line than the offensive
line. That isn't entirely true.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Riley, the former coach of the San Diego Chargers and Oregon
State, withdrew from Alabama's search for a chance at UCLA, where he
would have been willing to take considerably less money, in part
because his family lives on the West Coast. Coaches also consider the
prestige of a program and what the move might do for their resumes.</TE>
<TE>   Dorrell eagerly accepted UCLA's offer because it was his first
head coaching job.</TE>
<TE>   But even before his introduction as the new Bruin coach, the
39-year-old showed he was savvy about the economics of his trade.</TE>
<TE>   "If you win games," he said, "the money comes."</TE>

<LD>Do we have to ring in the new year? Because I don't see a lot of
rings for Los Angeles in the new year.</LD>
<LD>   Too bad we can't just unplug the clocks, keep the old calendars up
and stay right here in the year 2002 AD (Angeleno Domination).</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers' third consecutive championship and that improbable
Angel World Series triumph made this special. Do you realize how rare
it is for a city to snag two of the four major league championships
in the same calendar year? It's happened only five times in the last
34 years.</LD>
<TE>   Add in the Sparks' WNBA championship, the Galaxy's MLS
championship, USC's return to prominence -- and a new addition to its
Heisman Trophy collection -- and there were almost enough trophies to
allocate one to each of the region's area codes.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately they might have to last awhile. There's not a lot of
Cristal in the crystal ball.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers and Clippers aren't in the playoff picture at the
moment. The Ducks and Kings hang right on the margin. The Dodgers'
winter moves showed that their primary concern for 2003 is the budget
sheet, not the World Series. USC and UCLA haven't exactly done
anything to make you book hotel rooms in New Orleans for the Final
Four.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks and Galaxy could very well repeat. The Sparks are
running things the way the Lakers used to. The Galaxy has played for
the MLS Cup four times in the league's seven years, so it's always
within reach.</TE>
<TE>   But those victories don't lift the spirits of the entire city, or
have Ice Cube saying, "Today was a good day." When the Sparks staged
their first victory rally outside City Hall, a couple hundred people
showed up. And the next Galaxy championship T-shirt I see will be the
first.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is, the closer you get to the core of the teams this
city cares about, the colder this championship trail becomes. The
virulent spread of Angel fever -- and the Angels' World Series games
drawing bigger TV numbers than the Lakers' NBA Finals -- shows that
there's still a deep love of baseball here. And another year of 3
million fans coming through the turnstiles at Dodger Stadium reminds
you that there's still a bond to the city's first big league team.</TE>
<TE>   Too bad there won't be much love going back out. For this season,
the Dodgers' allegiance is to the books, to doing anything they can
to stay below baseball's luxury-tax threshold. They traded longtime
Dodger Eric Karros in a cost-cutting move, stayed out of the bidding
for Jim Thome and folded early on Jeff Kent and Cliff Floyd.</TE>
<TE>   Presumably, full seasons from Kevin Brown and Darren Dreifort
would give them a better pitching staff than last year's -- but as
they get older they're even less likely to remain injury-free.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, there's the unthinkable possibility that Staples Center
could be dark come playoff time. The Kings have to be worried about
Jason Allison's knee, and Adam Deadmarsh is one hard shot to the
cranium away from another concussion.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers got Lamar Odom back Saturday night. That should help.
Not only must they shake off their disappointing start, they'll have
to fight through surprising teams such as Phoenix and Seattle just to
make the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe they'll finish with a big enough surge to land one of the
eight Western Conference berths. That's about as much as we can
expect out of them. NBA teams don't go from playoff outsiders to
champions in one season. (Then again, NBA playoff teams don't go from
champions to playoff outsiders in one season. Right, Lakers? Right?).</TE>
<TE>   What would May and June be like without the Lakers and their
postseason drama? A lot like March without the annual resurrection of
Steve Lavin and the UCLA Bruins. They're not exactly racking up the
victories that will get them to the NCAA tournament at this point. If
they do get in, it's hard to imagine them with a favorable seeding.</TE>
<TE>   When the new year begins, it will do so without a local team in
the Associated Press men's college basketball top 25. In last week's
Sagarin ratings of every Division I team, the highest local school is
UC Irvine at No. 100.</TE>
<TE>   If one of the other local schools can squeeze into the tournament,
it probably won't be around for long. Since Loyola Marymount's run to
the elite eight in 1990, only the Pac-10 schools have made it to the
second weekend of the NCAAs.</TE>
<TE>   Is it up to Anaheim again? The Ducks have been a pleasant
surprise. But how much of their success is a mirage, propped up by
the NHL's thanks-for-coming system of awarding points for ties and
overtime losses? The Ducks' 15 wins are the fewest among the NHL's
Western Conference playoff contenders.</TE>
<TE>   It could be up to their Disney partners.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels -- the longest shot in 2002 -- would appear to be the
safest bet for 2003. They'll bring back the bulk of their
championship club, a balanced team that can afford down seasons by
one or two players.</TE>
<TE>   The rally monkey proved to be one of the greatest assets in
sports, but can it compete with that other force of nature -- George
Steinbrenner's checkbook? The Yankees went international once again
to load up with Japanese slugger Hideki Matsui and Cuban pitcher Jose
Contreras.</TE>
<TE>   You knew there'd be some sort of cosmic repercussions for the
Angels winning the World Series, and now we have it. Sporting
apocalypse around the rest of L.A.</TE>
<TE>   It reminds me of "Superman II," when Superman lured the Krypton
villains to the Fortress of Solitude and zapped away all of their
powers while he preserved his own. Whew, that one's from back in the
day -- 1980 to be precise. Good year. That's when the Lakers won the
first of their five championships of the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   I'm just a little nostalgic, that's all. Maybe it's from all that
reminiscing on the good old days of 2002.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Retired college basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian has had it with his
outlaw image, as he told the Las Vegas Sun's Dean Juipe.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm always made to look like the bad guy," Tarkanian said. "All
the [stuff] I've taken over the years and not once has anyone found
anything resembling a serious violation."</LD>
<LD>   Wrote Juipe: "He was repeatedly targeted by the National
Collegiate Athletic Assn. and all but despised by occasional critics.
There were and probably still are some people in power who just don't
like the man. But I do and always have, so when he ... went on
something of a rant, he was preaching to the choir.</LD>
<TE>   "Always very conscious of the media, he's riled these days because
of a few hits he has taken of late pertaining to a just-completed
investigation at Fresno. He wants to make it clear to his friends in
Las Vegas that he was no more guilty of improprieties at Fresno than
he was at UNLV, where a jealous president harpooned the Rebels and
all but railroaded him out of town."</TE>

<TE>   Trivia time: What was the first school to open the college
football season as the No. 1-ranked team and remain there until
winning the national championship -- since the Associated Press poll
began in 1950?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Captain comeback: John Elway's renowned reputation for getting
himself out of jams on the gridiron has apparently transferred to the
links, as Elway demonstrated in becoming the first non-PGA Tour
professional to compete in the ADT Skills Challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Elway, who has a handicap of 2, actually fared better than he
thought he would against the pros in the 11-year-old event, which was
taped last month at Boca Raton, Fla., for airing on NBC Saturday and
today.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought where I might do the best was long drive, or trouble
shots," he told The Times' Larry Stewart. "I have more experience
with trouble shots than those guys."</TE>

<TE>   Nice guys finish last: Atlanta Journal-Constitution columnist
Curtis Bunn insists that the nice-guy routine doesn't work for
coaches anymore, especially in the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   "Jettisoning Lon Kruger was hard only because he is a decent guy
who knows basketball," Bunn wrote. "The decision, however, was easy.
The Hawks under Kruger were as uninspired as a dried-up lemon, the
most uninteresting team in the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   "Even the Memphis Grizzlies have Hubie Brown as coach. Not that it
makes sense; Brown, 69, was a loser in his last job in New York
nearly 20 years ago and one of the most nasty and vile personalities
in the game. But at least he has a spirit."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1961, Wilt Chamberlain scored 60
points for the Philadelphia Warriors against the Los Angeles Lakers
at Hershey, Pa., where he later played his 100-point game.</TE>

<TE>   Trivia answer: Top-ranked Florida State went 12-0 in 2000,
finishing the season with a 46-29 victory over Virginia in the Sugar
Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: San Jose Mercury News columnist Skip Bayless believes
Deion Sanders' ego and self-absorbed need to break his own story of
playing for the Oakland Raiders alerted other teams to the plan and,
thus, torpedoed it.</TE>
<TE>   "If he just could have kept his mouth shut," Bayless wrote, "he
might be checking himself out in silver and black."</TE>

<HD>Clippers Get a Lift, Not a Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There were merely flashes Saturday night, brief glimpses of what once
was and what could soon be again.</LD>
<LD>   In the end, the Clippers had to settle for decidedly mixed results
during a 99-92 loss to the Golden State Warriors before a crowd of
18,499 at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Lamar Odom played basketball for the first time in 11 months,
showing off hook shots, perimeter jumpers and smooth drives to the
basket, hanging in midair and drawing fouls. He rebounded the ball
easily and found open teammates.</LD>
<TE>   But Odom also tossed up an airball or two, bricked a couple of key
free throws late and got caught out of position more than once on
defense.</TE>
<TE>   Judging by Saturday's loss, the Clippers (12-18) still have
issues, but getting Odom back in action solved one of them. By game's
end, he had 21 points on seven-for-19 shooting, eight rebounds and
two assists in 37 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to win that game in the worst way," Odom said after the
Clippers were outscored, 9-3, in the final 1:01. "We lost and that's
the bottom line. Of course, I felt a little dead-legged for the most
part. It's my first time playing ball in 11 months. It's something I
have to fight through."</TE>
<TE>   Asked what he believed he needed to improve, Odom said, "Shooting.
Everything."</TE>
<TE>   Antawn Jamison led the Warriors with 28 points, fouling out with
1:09 remaining. Gilbert Arenas scored 23 points. Golden State almost
let a 19-point lead in the third quarter slip away in the game's
final minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Andre Miller had 23 points, 11 assists and six rebounds for the
Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   Corey Maggette added 18 points in his second game since returning
from arthroscopic knee surgery. Elton Brand was held to two points on
one-for-five shooting and had six rebounds in 42 minutes, one game
after tying his season high with 29 points in a 108-95 loss to the
Phoenix Suns.</TE>
<TE>   Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry was furious after the game, not the
least bit encouraged by the return of his most versatile player.</TE>
<TE>   "We played [lousy]," he said, "and that's the bottom line. They
deserved to win. They played harder and they rebounded the heck out
of the ball. We got some good shots and we can't make a shot. You're
not going to beat anybody shooting 38% in this league. Everybody is
going to play a zone against us until we make shots."</TE>
<TE>   Odom sat out 71 games and 344 days since last playing Jan. 18,
2002, when he went 24 minutes against the Cleveland Cavaliers at
Staples. He played only 29 games last season because of the wrist and
ankle injuries and because of an eight-game suspension for violating
the NBA's drug policy.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers were 31-40 while he was sidelined.</TE>
<TE>   Hours before tipoff against the Warriors, Odom walked into an
empty Staples Center wearing a 1960s-era blue-and-white Laker jersey
with Elgin Baylor's No. 22 on the front and back.</TE>
<TE>   With no restrictions placed on Odom's participation by the team's
medical staff, Gentry started the 6-foot-10 small forward. Odom
received thunderous cheers from the crowd during the pregame
introductions.</TE>
<TE>   "They say he can play as much as he can play," Gentry said. "He
didn't say anything to me about starting. I decided I was going to
start him."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Olowokandi won the opening tip, Odom chased down the ball,
flipping it behind his back to Miller before it went out of bounds.
Odom then lined up a jump shot from the right wing that missed.</TE>
<TE>   He would miss three more shots before making his first basket
since going on the injured list last Jan. 24.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it was nervous energy or perhaps just plain old rust, Odom
shanked his first four shots before swishing a three-pointer over
former Clipper Earl Boykins, who stands all of 5-5.</TE>
<TE>   Near the end of the half, Odom zipped through the lane with the
ball in his left hand and Arenas on his right hip. Odom lifted the
ball toward the basket, Arenas fouled him and the ball swished
through. Odom made the free throw and the Clippers were within 47-41.</TE>
<TE>   Boykins' three-pointer at the halftime buzzer gave the Warriors a
50-41 lead. The Clippers led only once in the first half, using a 9-0
run to go ahead, 38-37.</TE>

<HD>Ducks Can't Handle Canucks</HD>
<DH>Anaheim loses second game in a row as Vancouver scores on
five of its first 11 shots in 7-3 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>VANCOUVER, Canada</DL>
<LD>As timetables go, the Mighty Ducks have a ways to go before having to
deal with the Vancouver Canucks' headaches.</LD>
<LD>   Things like division-title races, home-ice advantage for the
playoffs and banner-draping ceremonies seem another mighty decade
away for the Ducks ... at least on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "It's taken [Vancouver] three years to get here," Duck Coach Mike
Babcock said before Saturday's game. "We would like it not to take as
long."</LD>
<TE>   Judging by the Canucks' 7-3 romp, even a three-year plan seems a
bit optimistic for the Ducks. This was a game between the NHL's two
most improved teams from last season. When it was over, everyone,
from the 18,422 at General Motors Place to the guys wearing Duck
uniforms, was clear on who topped that list.</TE>
<TE>   This one was over after the Canucks' first 11 shots, five of which
were goals.</TE>
<TE>   Trent Klatt and Todd Bertuzzi each scored two goals. Markus
Naslund scored his league-high 24th goal and had two assists. The
Canucks had a power-play goal and a short-handed goal.</TE>
<TE>   "We played an 'A' team and we didn't bring our 'A' game," Babcock
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks began the game already feeling down. They learned at the
morning skate that Paul Kariya's father, Tetsuhiko Kariya, died of a
heart attack in Vancouver on Friday night. Kariya played, logging 20
minutes and had an assist.</TE>
<TE>   "That just shows what kind of special player Paul is," Duck center
Matt Cullen said. "It shows his character and what kind of guy he is.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously tonight was tough on all of us. This was a tragedy. For
Paul to come out and play was unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   The Canucks were the Western Conference's worst team in 1998-99,
but improved each season since, slipping into the playoffs as the No.
8 team last season.</TE>
<TE>   They started this season 3-4-4-0 but now sit atop the Northwest
Division with a 22-10-5-0 record.</TE>
<TE>   "They came out of relative obscurity," Cullen said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what we want to do and that's definitely where we came
from."</TE>
<TE>   To avoid a return trip, the Ducks need to get their act together.</TE>
<TE>   They had won six of seven games and were in a playoff spot on
Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   They have been outscored, 11-4, in losses to San Jose and
Vancouver since then.</TE>
<TE>   The seven goals Saturday were the most the Ducks have given up
since a 7-4 loss to San Jose on March 29, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to stop this now," Cullen said. "We have a defensive
foundation that hasn't been there the last two games. Fortunately,
that's an easy thing to get back. All it takes is hard work."</TE>
<TE>   Jean-Sebastien Giguere, the hottest goalie in the NHL a week ago,
saw 11 shots on goal and gave up three goals in the first period
before Babcock mercifully gave him the rest of the night off.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Gerber, Giguere's replacement, gave up two goals on the
first two shots he saw.</TE>
<TE>   "They had some pucks that had some eyes out there," Babcock said.</TE>
<TE>   "When that first goal went in at the start of the second period, I
think we panicked.</TE>
<TE>   "We started running around trying to get things back together, but
we never did."</TE>

<DL>VANCOUVER, Canada</DL>
<LD>Tetsuhiko Kariya, Paul Kariya's father, died of a heart attack Friday
evening in Vancouver, but Kariya played Saturday against the Canucks.
Duck officials gave Kariya the option of remaining in Vancouver with
his family for as long as needed, but he is expected to play tonight
in Calgary.</LD>
<LD>   T.K. Kariya, a high school math and physical education teacher in
Vancouver, retired in June 2001. He had seen his son play every time
the Ducks came to Vancouver and traveled to Southern California last
February to watch him play in the All-Star game.</LD>
<LD>   T.K. is survived by his wife, Sharon Kariya, three sons and two
daughters. Steve Kariya, who plays for the Canucks' minor league team
in Manitoba, returned home Saturday. Martin Kariya remained at the
University of Maine, where he plays hockey.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks expressed interest in New York Ranger forward Radek
Dvorak but backed off because the asking price was too high. The
Rangers were believed to be seeking a forward in return....
Defenseman Fredrik Olausson was a healthy scratch against Vancouver.
The Ducks play games on successive days and wanted to rest the
37-year-old veteran.</TE>

<HD>Giants Get Wild-Card Spot After It Almost Slips Away</HD>
<DH>Barber loses three fumbles but runs for 203 yards in 10-7
overtime victory over the Eagles.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Running back Tiki Barber found redemption Saturday, and so did kicker
Matt Bryant. As a result, the New York Giants are headed for the
playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Bryant, who needed a lucky ricochet to make an extra point that
tied the score, kicked a 39-yard field goal in overtime to topple the
Philadelphia Eagles, 10-7, and secure a wild-card berth for the NFL's
most improbable playoff team.</LD>
<LD>   Setting up that winning drive was Barber, who had his best and
worst day as a pro. He rushed for a career-high 203 yards but lost
three fumbles in the process, as many as he lost in the first 15
games of the season.</LD>
<TE>   Still, the only offensive plays the Giants called in overtime were
Barber runs -- six of them for 29 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "He came up to me after the game, put his arm around me and said,
'Hey, Coach, thanks for sticking with me,' " Giant Coach Jim Fassel
said. "It wasn't a hard call for me. He's won a lot of games for me.
I stuck by him before, I'll stick by him again."</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles stuck by their man, too. But Pro Bowl kicker David
Akers didn't come through. He was wide right on a 35-yard attempt
with 1:16 remaining in regulation. He might have been bothered by a
shoulder stinger he suffered while making a tackle on the opening
kickoff, but he was in no mood to elaborate after the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got one word to say to you: I missed," he said, proving this
was neither his day for kicking nor counting.</TE>
<TE>   The loss put home-field advantage in jeopardy for the Eagles
(12-4), who need the New York Jets to beat visiting Green Bay today
to avoid hitting the road in the NFC playoffs. Philadelphia had won
six in a row and nine of 10.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants (10-6), meanwhile, are just happy to make the playoffs.
After all, they were 6-6 in early December after consecutive losses
to Houston and Tennessee. Since, they've won four in a row and erased
any doubts about Fassel's job security.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants join Philadelphia, Tampa Bay, San Francisco and Green
Bay in the NFC playoff field. Atlanta can secure the final spot today
with a victory at Cleveland or a loss by New Orleans against visiting
Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   "We've played football about as bad and as well this season as
anybody can play it," Giant defensive end Michael Strahan said. "To
win 10 games and make the playoffs is huge."</TE>
<TE>   New York limited the Eagles to 209 yards and blemished the record
of quarterback A.J. Feeley, who dropped to 4-1 as a starter.
Philadelphia's only touchdown came on its opening drive, when
receiver James Thrash scored on a 20-yard reverse.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't able to connect," Coach Andy Reid said. "That comes
back to me getting the guys in the right position to make plays. I
didn't do a very good job of it."</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say the Giants made the most of all their
opportunities. They lost three of seven fumbles, had two turnovers in
the red zone and saw two touchdowns called back because of penalties.
Bryant missed a 36-yard field-goal attempt, rattled through a PAT,
and shanked a kickoff.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants didn't get on the scoreboard until midway through the
fourth quarter, when tight end Jeremy Shockey outjumped safety Brian
Dawkins to make a beautiful one-handed catch for a seven-yard
touchdown. Shockey, true to his University of Miami roots, started
talking trash as they tumbled to the ground. He then popped to his
feet and celebrated by heaving the ball deep into the stands.</TE>
<TE>   "It was so unfortunate that we had so many turnovers, because we
could have put up a lot more points," said Shockey, who had a
game-high 10 catches for 98 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Barber was so overcome by emotions after the game, he sat on the
bench with his face buried in his hands and cried. He could never
remember doing that after a game, win or lose.</TE>
<TE>   "The gamut of emotions I ran through today was unbelievable," said
Barber, who touched the ball 40 times and accounted for 276 yards. "I
told Matt Bryant after he kicked that field goal that it takes a lot
to make me cry. But when that thing went through, I couldn't help
myself."</TE>
<TE>   Although Barber was officially responsible for three fumbles, he
had four by his count. On the final drive by his count, he and
quarterback Kerry Collins had a bad exchange and the ball hit the
turf. Barber pounced on it and Collins was charged with the fumble.
But the two later said the miscue was caused by Barber being out of
position.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't slick," Barber said of the football. "It wasn't enough
awareness on my part. I was getting complacent on the contact, and
that's what [the Eagles] are known for. They go for the ball, they
strip it, they hit you hard and they pull it out. They got me."</TE>

<HD>Got Koko Gets Victory for Headley and Solis</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Bob Mieszerski</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Second with Royally Chosen in last year's La Brea Stakes, trainer
Bruce Headley and jockey Alex Solis had a better result with Got Koko
in the Grade I race Saturday at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   Got Koko, a 17-1 shot making her graded stakes debut, overhauled
Spring Meadow, another outsider at nearly 20-1, in deep stretch and
won going away.</LD>
<LD>   At the end of her seven furlongs in 1:22 2/5, the 3-year-old
daughter of Signal Tap, who is owned by Headley and restaurateur Paul
Leung, had 3 1/4 lengths on the runner-up, who was half a length
better than 17-1 shot and pacesetter Erica's Smile.</LD>
<TE>   A $30,000 yearling purchase at Keeneland, Got Koko, a Texas-bred,
won for the fourth time in eight starts.</TE>
<TE>   The victory in the La Brea was her fourth in five tries on the
main dirt track and that's where she will remain.</TE>
<TE>   The next step is the $150,000 El Encino Stakes at 1 1/16 miles on
Jan. 19. A Grade II, the El Encino is the race where Royally Chosen
lost a gut-wrenching nose decision to Affluent in a contest chosen
the best of the 2001-2002 winter-spring meet.</TE>
<TE>   "Knock on wood, we'll continue on with her [to the El Encino],"
said Headley.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what our plan is. It's really quite a thrill to beat a
field like that."</TE>
<TE>   A winner twice in three starts on the dirt at Santa Anita, Got
Koko was seventh after a 44 3/5 half-mile, came wide and, with an
eighth of a mile to go, there was no doubt she was going to pick up
her biggest win.</TE>
<TE>   "Bruce and I have always thought she was a Grade I filly and she
proved it today," said Solis, who escaped serious injury a race later
when Most Likely, a 6-year-old gelding trained by Headley, suffered a
fatal injury in the stretch of a $62,500 claimer on the grass. Taken
to Arcadia Methodist Hospital for precautionary X-rays, Solis was
reported to be conscious and alert.</TE>
<TE>   The race favorite, You, who was seeking her sixth Grade I victory
since being purchased privately by trainer Bobby Frankel for owner Ed
Gann in the summer of 2001, instead turned in a rare stinker. You,
the daughter of You and I, engaged Erica's Smile from the inside for
the first half-mile, then tired late to finish fifth at 4-5. It was
only the third time in 15 races she has been worse than third.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very disappointed in her performance," said Patrick
Valenzuela, who rode the favorite for the first time. "She was
running easy on the backstretch, but when we got to the quarter pole,
she gave it up."</TE>
<TE>   Frankel did win the other stakes on the card Saturday, taking the
$76,350 Hill Rise with heavily favored Peace Rules.</TE>
<TE>   With two racing days left in the year, Frankel is $129,418 short
of Wayne Lukas' 14-year-old record of $17,842,358 in stable earnings.</TE>

<KH>ORANGE BOWL / USC vs. IOWA</KH>
<HD>Money Player</HD>
<DH>Three years ago, Brad Banks was a junior college wide
receiver; now, as quarterback for No. 3 Iowa, he's the Heisman
runner-up</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rob Fernas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>IOWA CITY, Iowa</DL>
<LD>Brad Banks is running several hours late, and the television crew
waiting to film a sound bite with the Iowa quarterback is growing
impatient.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, word comes that Banks is on his way. He enters the room
at the Hayden Fry Football Complex and immediately disarms everyone
with his brilliant smile and easygoing manner.</LD>
<LD>   A member of the TV crew hands him his No. 7 jersey, which he puts
on before being interviewed and taken through a series of poses that
will be shown during the national telecast of Thursday's Orange Bowl
game between Iowa and USC.</LD>
<TE>   Keeping appointments usually isn't a problem for Banks, but these
are hectic days for the unassuming senior. Demands for his time have
put a strain on him, even if he doesn't like to admit it.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to go out and have a great year," he says. "All
this other stuff just came with it. I'm enjoying it."</TE>
<TE>   Some have their doubts. The day after Banks returned from the
Heisman Trophy ceremony in New York, where he was runner-up to USC
quarterback Carson Palmer, he was so tired he could barely keep his
eyes open, an Iowa official said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, you'll rarely hear Banks complain. It's not part of his
makeup.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he feels pressure in his role as leader of the nation's
third-ranked team, he stifles a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't worry about pressure," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Banks' background has helped prepare him for the spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   There was pressure in being the youngest son of Charles Banks, a
farm-labor contractor who reared Brad on a heavy dose of discipline
amid the sugar-cane fields of Belle Glade, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   There was pressure in being the starting quarterback as a
sophomore at Glade Central High, a coaching move that upset several
teammates because Banks replaced a more experienced senior.</TE>
<TE>   There was pressure in flunking out of Central Florida as a
freshman and realizing he might have blown his best chance to play
Division I football.</TE>
<TE>   "It just made me tougher," Banks said. "I'm glad I went through
it. God has been with me all the way."</TE>
<TE>   Banks' emergence this season -- his first as a starter at Iowa --
is the kind of rags-to-riches tale that attracts attention. In
leading the Hawkeyes to an 11-1 record, he answered skeptics who
didn't think he could play quarterback at the major college level.</TE>
<TE>   "It's got to be one of the all-time great stories in college
football," Iowa Coach Kirk Ferentz said.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, Banks was a wide receiver at Hinds Community
College in Raymond, Miss. He switched positions the next season and
passed for more than 2,000 yards in leading Hinds to an 11-1 record,
but few four-year schools recruited him as a quarterback. North
Carolina State wanted him to play receiver.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa took a chance by signing him and has reaped the rewards.
Banks is second in the nation in passing efficiency with a rating of
166.1, having thrown for 2,369 yards and a Big Ten Conference-best 25
touchdowns, with only four interceptions. He also is a threat to run,
with 387 yards and five touchdowns rushing.</TE>
<TE>   "We really weren't looking for a JC quarterback that year, but he
was the best guy on our board," Ferentz said. "When we met him, we
just fell in love with him."</TE>
<TE>   Charles Banks asked only one favor from the Iowa coaches who
recruited his son: "Give him a chance."</TE>
<TE>   Brad Banks speaks of his 60-year-old father with a combination of
admiration and frustration. He lets out a sigh when recalling what
his father repeatedly told him.</TE>
<TE>   "He always said, 'One day, you're going to thank me for all this.'
I was like, 'Man, get out of here.' [But] I thank him all the time
now."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't always like that.</TE>
<TE>   "Because, growing up, he wouldn't let me do anything," Banks said.
"I couldn't go places other kids could go. I had to be in at a
certain time."</TE>
<TE>   With most of his older siblings already on their own, Banks spent
a lot of time alone at home. Among his hobbies was chasing rabbits in
the sugar-cane fields of Belle Glade, a small town where 28% of the
families live below the national poverty line.</TE>
<TE>   "Home, chores, just doing nothing," Banks said of his childhood.
"The only thing I'd do around the house is tear up stuff. I'd make
basketball goals out of paper plates in my room, just play in there
all day."</TE>
<TE>   Charles Banks and his wife, Vida, have 12 children from previous
marriages. Brad is six years younger than his nearest sibling. The
older boys were good athletes, and it wasn't long before Brad was
tearing up peewee football fields.</TE>
<TE>   "Brad got the ball and he would run from one end of the field to
the other," Vida Banks told the Des Moines Register. "He had both
teams chasing him."</TE>
<TE>   He displayed enough talent as a high school sophomore to become
the varsity quarterback at Glade Central. After some early struggles,
he led his team to the playoffs as a junior and to the state
championship game as a senior.</TE>
<TE>   Central Florida was among the few universities that offered
scholarships to Banks, who had trouble getting qualifying scores on
his college entrance exams.</TE>
<TE>   He sat out his freshman season as a redshirt, watching senior
Daunte Culpepper direct the Central Florida offense. Banks remains
close to Culpepper, quarterback for the Minnesota Vikings, and they
frequently talk on the phone.</TE>
<TE>   "He taught me how to be a person, how to treat people," Banks
said. "He took me under his wing. He treats me like a little
brother."</TE>
<TE>   Having a successful mentor wasn't enough to keep Banks from
straying. Plagued by homesickness, he spent more time making the
three-hour drive from the Central Florida campus in Orlando to Belle
Glade than he did going to class.</TE>
<TE>   Academic problems forced him to drop out.</TE>
<TE>   Given a second chance at Hinds, Banks became more dedicated in the
classroom and slowly resurrected his football career.</TE>
<TE>   Once at Iowa, he quickly seized his opportunity. When another
quarterback transferred last season, it opened a spot for Banks as
the backup to senior Kyle McCann. Banks completed 60% of his passes
for 582 yards in a limited role.</TE>
<TE>   "We used Brad as a changeup pitcher, bringing him in here and
there to change the tempo of the game," Ferentz said. "We gave him a
chance to learn.</TE>
<TE>   "We always had a great feeling about Brad. He's a guy who's
improved with the opportunity he's had out there, be it at practice
or in a game."</TE>
<TE>   Banks began this season with a starting job and a good feeling
about the team.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew coming into this year from two-a-days that it was going to
be a great year," he said. "Everybody was ready. These guys love
football. To be around guys like that makes everything more easy for
you."</TE>
<TE>   After Iowa's third game, however, Banks wasn't considered the best
quarterback in the state. He was outplayed by Iowa State's Seneca
Wallace in a 36-31 loss to the Cyclones, in which Banks lost two
fumbles within a five-minute span.</TE>
<TE>   He redeemed himself two games later, passing for 261 yards and
four touchdowns in a 42-35 overtime victory at Penn State. Banks
completed a six-yard pass play to his cousin, wide receiver C.J.
Jones, for the winning touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Banks came through again the next week against visiting Purdue. He
drove Iowa 87 yards for the game's final touchdown, a seven-yard,
fourth-down pass play to tight end Dallas Clark with 1:07 left in a
31-28 victory.</TE>
<TE>   If the nation wasn't already aware of Banks and the Hawkeyes, a
34-9 victory at then-No. 8 Michigan on Oct. 26 did the trick. Banks
completed 18 of 29 passes for 222 yards and two touchdowns as Iowa
handed the Wolverines their worst home loss since 1967 on its way to
an 8-0 Big Ten record. Through the ups and downs, Banks never wavered
in his quiet confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very steady," Ferentz said. "He keeps the same demeanor
about him all the time -- win, lose or draw. I think that's a great
trait for a leader to have. He keeps the team stable and focused."</TE>
<TE>   A career in the NFL could be a longshot for the undersized Banks.
Although listed at 6 feet 1, he's actually 5-11. Still, he's hoping
for a shot.</TE>
<TE>   If that doesn't materialize, Banks said, he would like to work
with children, perhaps as a teacher and coach.</TE>
<TE>   "I love kids," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Banks is enjoying being a big kid himself. With
his final college game set in Miami, an hour's drive from Belle
Glade, he is looking forward to playing before a large contingent of
family and friends. It will be the culmination of a whirlwind season
for Banks, one that has included a slew of awards and the kind of
attention that can make a young man's head spin.</TE>
<TE>   "It hasn't sunk in yet," he said.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Avert Worst-Case Scenario</HD>
<DH>L.A. gains a measure of confidence and a rare road victory,
albeit over West's weakest team, 112-93 at Denver.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>OK, so it wasn't the Sacramento Kings.</LD>
<LD>   That was Mark Blount lining up at center against Shaquille O'Neal
on Saturday night, not Vlade Divac.</LD>
<LD>   That was Junior Harrington bringing the ball up court, not Mike
Bibby.</LD>
<TE>   But when you've been struggling and stumbling and sputtering as
the Lakers have, you are happy for the chance, any chance, to rebuild
confidence, regain dominance and take your victories where you find
them.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday night, the Lakers found themselves at the Pepsi Center
playing against the Denver Nuggets, arguably the worst team in the
league, indisputably the worst in the Western Conference, and they
took advantage of the opportunity, cruising to a 112-93 win in front
of a sellout crowd of 19,099.</TE>
<TE>   In improving to 12-19, the Lakers beat a team that fell to 6-23,
lost its ninth in a row and dropped to 4-11 at home.</TE>
<TE>   "We're happy as long as they are Ws, not Ls," guard Derek Fisher
said after the Lakers won for only the third time in 16 games away
from Staples Center this season.</TE>
<TE>   There was plenty for them to be happy about. Kobe Bryant, despite
playing with a slightly sprained right wrist, came out hot, hitting
his first nine shots, and finished 15 for 26 with a game-high 39
points. O'Neal scored 22, pulled down a game-high 13 rebounds and
showed some of the bounce and movement that has often been absent
since his return from off-season toe surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, Coach Phil Jackson had discussed his center's
struggles for the umpteenth time.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just not as mobile," Jackson said, "not as active to the
ball. There's an economy of motion. He's saving steps a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Not in the first quarter, though, when O'Neal, perhaps invigorated
by his wedding Thursday, put on a coast-to-coast show that brought
back memories of a younger, friskier Shaq.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Denver basket, O'Neal blocked a driving layup attempt by
Rodney White, secured the ball, took off downcourt on a dribble
drive, spotted Bryant breaking for the basket and launched a
perfectly timed alley-oop pass that Bryant slammed through the hoop.</TE>
<TE>   As he headed back up court, O'Neal offered a wink to the press
table.</TE>
<TE>   That was the only clue to how he felt about the play, since O'Neal
again was a no-show in the locker room after the game. He hasn't
conducted a postgame interview in three weeks, since the Lakers beat
the Dallas Mavericks at Staples Center on Dec. 6. And it took the
biggest comeback in team history to nudge that interview out of him.</TE>
<TE>   On a night the Lakers equaled their season high with the 112
points and shot a season-best 58.4% from the floor, some of the
reserves also got playing time, notably Tracy Murray, who scored
seven points, hitting three of four from the field.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very aggressive," said Jackson. "He shot the ball well. He
helped himself."</TE>
<TE>   All the numbers weren't positive for the Lakers, however. They
continued their tendency to turn the ball over, a fault that has been
a key factor in their season-long slump.</TE>
<TE>   They committed 19 turnovers Saturday night to only 12 for the
Nuggets.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like [the Nuggets] were pressuring us," said Brian Shaw.
"It's just that we got careless, sloppy with the ball. It's something
we've just got to keep working on."</TE>
<TE>   Another negative Laker tendency surfaced Saturday, their habit of
letting seemingly beaten opponents get back into games. The Laker
killer instinct, a major asset during their championship runs the
last three seasons, continues to be missing in action.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, ahead by 13 points early in the third quarter and
apparently cruising, the Lakers allowed the hapless Nuggets to go on
a 10-0 run.</TE>
<TE>   But this time, the Lakers withstood the charge, then went on one
of their own.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, we have struggled in that situation," Bryant said.
"When a team gets back in the game, it has stayed in the game.
Tonight, that wasn't the case."</TE>
<TE>   That's not the only thing that has changed, according to Bryant.
The Laker attitude, he said, has undergone a transformation.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand," he said, "that we are faced with a big challenge,
and we are starting to get excited about it. We are not down. We are
tired of going through the same old, same old. The competitive juices
are starting to flow."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, beating up on poor, inept Denver is one thing. Picking
on someone their own size, like Sacramento, is quite another matter.</TE>

<LD>Becky Sundstrom won the women's 500 meters in the U.S. Speedskating
Long-Track Championships at Kearns, Utah, on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Along the way to becoming the national champion in the distance,
with two victories in two days at the championships, Sundstrom
recaptured the excitement she used to find in racing.</LD>
<LD>   "That's been really cool, to feel excited and to skate well," she
said after winning in 38.59 seconds.</LD>
<TE>   Sundstrom won the opening 500-meter race Friday in a personal-best
38.49 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   In other races Saturday, Joey Cheek cruised to victory in the
men's 500 in 35.16 seconds, Shani Davis won the men's 1,500 in 1

<KH>ROSE BOWL / WASHINGTON STATE vs. OKLAHOMA</KH>
<HD>Days of Reign</HD>
<DH>Miami's winning streak is impressive but still well short
of the 47 consecutive games won by Oklahoma in the 1950s</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Wharton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The scoreboard glowed dumbly that gray afternoon, the clock melted
down to zeros, no question about the outcome. Oklahoma had lost, 7-0,
to Notre Dame, yet the Sooners could not believe it.</LD>
<LD>   "The players didn't leave the field," recalls Joe Rector, a tight
end on the team. "I just got down on my knees and stayed there for
what felt like an hour."</LD>
<LD>   Fans in Oklahoma Memorial Stadium were dumbstruck, planted in
their seats. "I'm talking about 62,000 people," says Bob Burris, a
former player in the stands that day. "Nobody moved."</LD>
<TE>   The date was Nov. 16, 1957, and the Sooners had just lost a
football game for the first time in four years.</TE>
<TE>   Think about it. A president took office, served his term and was
reelected. A war ended in Korea and another began in Vietnam. Along
the way, dozens of Saturday afternoons came and went, each bringing a
chance for the Sooners to slip against a ranked opponent or take an
underdog too lightly.</TE>
<TE>   Forty-seven games and not one letdown. Not a single loss.</TE>
<TE>   On the glum day it ended, Oklahoma figured to trample an outmanned
Irish team and plow ahead toward a third consecutive national
championship. "We didn't even think about losing," Rector says.</TE>
<TE>   Funny thing is, they did not think much about winning either. The
streak was hardly ever mentioned. No one realized it was
extraordinary or felt undue pressure to keep it alive.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds egotistical, but we expected to win every game," says
Jimmy Harris, the quarterback for much of the streak. "Hell, we
thought that was the way it was supposed to be."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Games They Won</TE>
<TE>   The record book shows that college football's longest winning
streak belongs to Mount Union -- 54 games -- but that was in Division
III against the likes of Rowan, Muskingum and Otterbein.</TE>
<TE>   No big-time school has approached Oklahoma's feat. Miami, at 34
victories, has a chance but would have to defeat Ohio State in the
Fiesta Bowl, go unbeaten next season and win another bowl game. Until
that happens, the Sooners rank with Joe DiMaggio hitting safely in 56
games and the Boston Celtics winning eight consecutive NBA
championships in the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   "Phenomenal," says Paul Hornung, the Hall of Fame halfback whose
1956 Notre Dame team was a victim in the procession. "They played
some tough teams and just won everything in sight."</TE>
<TE>   The dynasty started unexpectedly. Though the Sooners had
established themselves as a powerhouse with a national championship a
few years earlier, the fall of 1953 found them rebuilding after the
departure of Heisman Trophy winner Billy Vessels.</TE>
<TE>   The season began with a loss to Notre Dame and a tie at
Pittsburgh. Then their legendary coach, Bud Wilkinson, shook things
up by switching his players from one position to another, and the
team responded with a 19-14 victory over Texas.</TE>
<TE>   The date was Oct. 10. The streak had begun.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma wasn't big along the line of scrimmage but, as Hornung
recalls, "the one ingredient they always had was speed. They ran that
split-T formation and they always had a halfback who was quick."</TE>
<TE>   Just as important, they had Wilkinson.</TE>
<TE>   His hair was beginning to gray in those days and he always wore a
suit, always stood straight. He was articulate but selective with his
words.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the kind of person who never raised his voice, never
cursed," Harris says. "He'd tell you what to do and if you screwed it
up, he'd tell you again. If you screwed up a third time, you didn't
get another chance. He'd stick you at the end of the bench."</TE>
<TE>   Practices were short and intricately structured, no detail
unattended. "It's like when you're practicing to kick an extra point,
he had it down to a science that the guy on the end of the line would
stick his elbow out a little more to block the rusher coming around
the outside," Harris says.</TE>
<TE>   That might sound quaint by today's standards, but Wilkinson
coached in a different era, before outsized staffs that included
video specialists, nutritionists and team psychologists. He had only
four assistants.</TE>
<TE>   "Bud was one of the first coaches who was so well-organized," says
Burris, the halfback who later coached high school football in Texas.
"I could tell you our practice routine to this day, it was so strict
and exact."</TE>
<TE>   The Sooners needed repetition to hone their offense, which relied
on quick handoffs to the fullback and option pitches.</TE>
<TE>   "You did it over and over until you knew exactly what you were
doing," Harris says. "You could run it blindfolded and just hear the
other guys."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Winning Was Birthright</TE>
<TE>   The 1953 season ended with nine consecutive victories, including a
7-0 defeat of Maryland in the Orange Bowl. In 1954, the Sooners went
10-0 and the following season won all 11 games to earn a national
championship.</TE>
<TE>   As the streak grew, players had various reasons for not discussing
it. Some were superstitious, others simply confident. Winning was
considered a birthright. As Harris said, why shouldn't Oklahoma
prevail each Saturday?</TE>
<TE>   Wilkinson downplayed the victories, adamant about the cliche that
his players focus on the next game. The only time he broke that rule
was for Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma had never defeated the Irish and was scheduled to visit
South Bend midway through the 1956 season. The previous spring,
Wilkinson installed a scheme that included flankers split wide, then
kept his special offense under wraps until the Oct. 27 game.</TE>
<TE>   His players recall he was wound up that week, working the team
harder than usual. In private, he made a rare comment to his
quarterback: "We've got this game."</TE>
<TE>   The tone was set early when Hornung took the ball in the shotgun
formation and All-American linebacker Jerry Tubbs broke into the
backfield.</TE>
<TE>   "You could hear that hit all the way through the stadium," Rector
says. "It was really a lick, I can tell you. They just quit."</TE>
<TE>   Hornung says only: "It was a tough ballgame."</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma won, 40-0, and might have scored twice as many points if
Wilkinson hadn't inserted the third string. The coach finally had a
victory over the Irish. The irony was, his team almost blew the
streak the following week.</TE>
<TE>   Playing at Colorado, the Sooners fell behind, 19-0, in a
mistake-filled first half. Wilkinson, with an understated flare for
the dramatic, uttered only one thing to his players at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   "Men, you don't deserve to wear these jerseys," he said. "But
there's one man in this stadium who thinks you can win ... and that's
me."</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma swamped the Buffaloes in the second half for a 27-19
victory and, four games later, secured another national title.</TE>
<TE>   How good were the Sooners? After the season, Hornung played in a
college all-star game and, doubling as punter, wanted to practice
catching snaps from Tubbs, the Oklahoma standout who played center on
offense.</TE>
<TE>   Hornung dropped back 15 yards and Tubbs asked, in a Texas drawl,
"You gonna stand that far back?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, Jerry, 15 yards is normal."</TE>
<TE>   The first snap bounced eight yards short. The second bounced five
yards short. Hornung recalls thinking: This guy made All-American?</TE>
<TE>   Tubbs stood up and turned around.</TE>
<TE>   "Sorry," he said. "We never punted at Oklahoma."</TE>
<TE>   Hornung chuckles at the memory. "It was the truth," he says. "I
looked it up. They had six punts that season and five were quick
kicks."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Simpler Era</TE>
<TE>   Burris watches college football today -- the 100-man rosters and
third-down specialists, the nickel backs and designated pass rushers
-- and he marvels at how coaches can prepare so many players each
week. His era was simpler.</TE>
<TE>   Players remained on the field for offense and defense. Freshmen
were ineligible. Scholarships were unlimited but rosters were small.</TE>
<TE>   "Our travel squad was limited to 36 players for a conference
game," he says. "The same guys played most of the time."</TE>
<TE>   Not only was a smaller team arguably easier to coach, players did
not leave school early for the NFL. They faced none of the modern
hype and distractions, no ESPN "SportsCenter" to remind them of the
streak, no Web sites dissecting each game.</TE>
<TE>   "If it were going on today," Rector says, "we'd be much more
aware."</TE>
<TE>   But Hornung doesn't want to hear any claims that winning 47
straight games was easier in the 1950s than it would be now.</TE>
<TE>   "A winning streak is a winning streak," he says. "Oklahoma played
in the Big Seven Conference and there were some good teams. Miami's
schedule isn't that tough."</TE>
<TE>   One more thing. Harris recalls that his offense, predicated on
speed, got a break from Mother Nature. He says, "All those years, I
don't think we ever played on a wet, muddy field."</TE>
<TE>   In the near loss at Colorado, it had snowed the day before but the
storm subsided by kickoff.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that had a lot to do with the streak," Harris says. "I
mean, there's got to be a little luck involved."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Game They Lost</TE>
<TE>   Luck ran out against Notre Dame the following season.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish were struggling to rebuild after Hornung's departure to
the NFL and had lost the previous two weeks. If anything, Oklahoma
might finally have succumbed to complacency.</TE>
<TE>   The vaunted Sooner offense could not move the ball that day. Only
the defense kept them in the game and Wilkinson later conceded, "I
was willing to settle for a scoreless tie in the third quarter."</TE>
<TE>   But with less than four minutes remaining, the Irish made headway.
They drove to within three yards of the end zone and, facing a fourth
down, decided to go for broke.</TE>
<TE>   "I was sure we were going to hold them," Rector says. "They ran a
little old option play we hadn't seen before."</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame quarterback Bob Williams faked to his fullback and
pitched the ball to Dick Lynch, who ran around right end for a
touchdown. Oklahoma had time for a list-ditch drive, but Williams
intercepted a pass in the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   It was quiet in Memorial Stadium. "Real quiet," Burris says. "It
was a shocker."</TE>
<TE>   In the locker room, after the players had finally dragged
themselves off the field, Wilkinson told them: "No one will ask you
about the games you won, they'll ask you about the game you lost."</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, so many years later, the Oklahoma football media
guide includes an account of that afternoon in its "Biggest Games"
section. None of the previous victories are mentioned.</TE>
<TE>   Yet there might be renewed appreciation for Oklahoma's streak if
Miami wins the Fiesta Bowl and manages to rebuild after losing
quarterback Ken Dorsey next season. If the Hurricanes get close to
the record, people might look back.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe then they will understand what Rector was feeling when he
lingered on the field after that loss to the Irish. When the streak
finally ended, he said, "it became apparent to me what we had done."</TE>
<TE>   There is a pause.</TE>
<TE>   "Forty-seven games."</TE>

<HD>UCLA Sinks Lower Against Michigan</HD>
<DH>Bruins drop to 2-3 at Pauley Pavilion, 2-5 overall, with
81-76 loss to Wolverines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA's leading scorer wore street clothes.</LD>
<LD>   The second-leading scorer was guarded so closely he appeared to
wear a Michigan jersey.</LD>
<LD>   And a season-high Pauley Pavilion crowd of 10,001 wore frowns.</LD>
<TE>   Yes, losing is beginning to wear on the Bruins, who sounded weary
with frustration after an 81-76 loss to the Wolverines on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "We get so intimidated," forward Andre Patterson said. "Once
again, a slow start did us in. We practice hard then don't have any
swagger in the games."</TE>
<TE>   A halftime deficit of seven points grew to 16 with 12 minutes to
play and resulted in the Bruins' third loss in a row, dropping them
to 2-5. Pacific 10 Conference games haven't started and already the
prospect of UCLA making the NCAA tournament is remote.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins have not had a worse start since 1945-46, a pre-John
Wooden edition that opened with a loss to an opponent called the
Carroll Shamrocks.</TE>
<TE>   This season's squad probably will be finished before St. Patrick's
Day rolls around March 17. The Pac-10 tournament concludes March 15.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought that in my senior year I'd be in such a bad
rhythm and the team would be likewise," forward Jason Kapono said.</TE>
<TE>   Blanketed by Michigan defenders who realized Bruin scoring options
were limited because leading scorer Dijon Thompson was out because of
a sore knee, Kapono scored five points on two-for-10 shooting. He
missed all five of his three-point shots and scored only on a
loose-ball layup in the first half and a post move with five minutes
left.</TE>
<TE>   He was fouled on the latter basket and made the free throw to cut
Michigan's lead to 69-63. On the next two UCLA possessions, however,
Kapono hurried a long three-point attempt and Cedric Bozeman shot an
airball from behind the arc.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA pulled within four with 24.5 seconds left on three-pointers
by Ryan Walcott and T.J. Cummings, but Michigan made enough free
throws to maintain the cushion.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Horton, a freshman, made seven of 10 three-point shots and
led Michigan with 24 points.</TE>
<TE>   Forwards Bernard Robinson Jr. and LaVell Blanchard both scored 18
points and set the tone early, both making three-pointers as the
Wolverines seized an 11-2 lead. UCLA's ball movement improved and
with Bozeman making two three-pointers the Bruins pulled within 30-29
with five minutes left in the half.</TE>
<TE>   The rally was short-lived, however.</TE>
<TE>   "We fought back well by playing better defense and showing
patience with the ball," Coach Steve Lavin said. "Then we got away
from what got us close.</TE>
<TE>   "We take too many perimeter shots. Even our post players are
stepping off the block too much and doing it."</TE>
<TE>   T.J. Cummings was the worst offender. The junior forward led UCLA
with 19 points, making seven of 16 shots, but he forced several
attempts and had only five rebounds because he spent so much time
outside.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody wants to shoot and I need to start yelling at players,"
said Walcott, a point guard. "I'm too nice. I blame myself for not
getting my teammates good shots. We can turn this around, but it's
going to take some real determination."</TE>
<TE>   Michigan (5-6) could give the Bruins inspiration, having won five
in a row since losing its first six.</TE>
<TE>   "We made a vow to start the season 0-0 after the first six games
and these kids have won five in a row now," Wolverine Coach Tommy
Amaker said. "They competed hard against a storied program like UCLA
in a place where not very many people come here and win."</TE>
<TE>   Amaker must not have checked UCLA's schedule. Including two
exhibition losses, the Bruins are 2-5 at home. They are 0-3 on
national television, 0-1 on the road and 0-1 on a neutral court, so
there isn't much optimism that opening Pac-10 play at Washington on
Thursday will change their fortunes.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe they can find solace in the history books. The last time the
Bruins started 2-5, in 1984-85, they bounced back to go 12-6 in the
Pac-10, finished 21-12 and won the NIT championship.</TE>
<TE>   Improvement will have to be swift to duplicate that kind of
finish. Bozeman, the point guard, said it starts with teamwork.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to get everybody involved and get to the point where we
are unselfish," he said. "We need to share the ball."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   False Starts</TE>
<TE>   A look at the three seasons that UCLA has started 2-5 since
1948-49, John Wooden's first season as Bruin coach:</TE>
<TE>   Season: 2002-03</TE>
<TE>   Coach: STEVE LAVIN</TE>
<TE>   Losses to: San Diego; at No. 4 Duke; Northern Arizona; at No. 18
Kansas; Michigan</TE>
<TE>   Comment: The Bruins are on pace for their fewest victories since
1945-46, when they were 8-16. Among the losses that season was one to
a team called 20th Century Fox. This season's UCLA team also appears
to be fading to black.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Season: 1984-85</TE>
<TE>   Coach: WALT HAZZARD</TE>
<TE>   Losses to: Santa Clara; at No. 2 DePaul; at Memphis State; at BYU;
at No. 8 St. John's</TE>
<TE>   Comment: The Jukes of Hazzard, led by sophomore Reggie Miller,
finished 21-12 -- including a magical run to the ... NIT ("We're No.
65!") championship. The NIT championship banner hung around Pauley
Pavilion for a few years before it was finally determined how silly
it looked alongside the row of NCAA championship banners and was
removed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Season: 1961-62</TE>
<TE>   Coach: JOHN WOODEN</TE>
<TE>   Losses to: at BYU (twice); Colorado State; at Creighton; at
Houston</TE>
<TE>   Comment: Though still a few years removed from being recognized as
the Wizard of Westwood, Wooden nonetheless worked his magic in an
18-11 season. The Bruins overcame their worst start in 16 seasons to
win the conference championship and make their first NCAA Final Four
appearance under Wooden before losing to eventual champion Cincinnati
on a last-second shot. Eventually, anything less than an NCAA
championship would be unacceptable at UCLA.</TE>

<HD>Flames Give Coaching Job to Sutter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It took less than a month for Darryl Sutter to find a new team.</LD>
<LD>   Sutter was hired as coach of the Calgary Flames on Saturday and
will make his debut tonight against the Mighty Ducks. He was fired by
the San Jose Sharks on Dec. 1 after an 8-12-2-2 start.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a thrill, it gives me shivers," Sutter said.</LD>
<TE>   Calgary fired Greg Gilbert on Dec. 3. Gilbert was in his second
full season as coach after taking over the team in March 2001, when
Don Hay was fired.</TE>
<TE>   Al MacNeil, the special assistant to General Manager Craig Button,
was the interim coach.</TE>
<TE>   Sutter's name was among the first to surface as a potential
candidate when the Flames fired Gilbert and assistant Brad McCrimmon.
Sutter's family has roots in Alberta and his brother, Brian, coached
the Flames for three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   In little more than five seasons with the Sharks, Sutter had a
regular-season record of 192-182-60.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a short-term deal for me," Sutter said. "I want the
identity of the Calgary Flames back to where it was -- this is a
tough town, a tough place to play. Just to restore that is really
important."</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Sutter became just the second coach in league history
to guide his team to five consecutive seasons of point improvement.
He led the Sharks to a club-record five consecutive playoff berths.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Todd Simpson of the Phoenix Coyotes was suspended for two games
without pay by the league for high-sticking King forward Ian
Laperriere.</TE>
<TE>   In the second period of Thursday's game between the Coyotes and
Kings, Simpson was assessed minor penalties for roughing,
unsportsmanlike conduct and high-sticking.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson, suspended for three games in November for high-sticking
Rob DiMaio of Dallas, is considered a repeat offender under the terms
of the collective bargaining agreement.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Goalie Tom Barrasso cleared waivers and was released by the St.
Louis Blues.</TE>
<TE>   Barrasso, 37, was signed as a free agent Nov. 4 during a rash of
goalie injuries. He was 1-4 in six games with a 3.28 goals-against
average and an .879 save percentage.</TE>
<TE>   He had been expected to compete with Fred Brathwaite for the
backup job behind Brent Johnson, but has not played since injuring
his back Nov. 29.</TE>
<TE>   Barrasso is 369-277-86 with a 3.25 goals-against average and 38
shutouts in 777 games.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Sean Burke learned he would be in goal Saturday night for the
first time since spraining an ankle in late October, about the last
thing on his mind was a shutout.</LD>
<LD>   But Burke made 23 saves and the Phoenix Coyotes defeated the
Philadelphia Flyers, 4-0, at Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   Burke, who has 32 shutouts in his career, sat out 29 games after
spraining an ankle Oct. 22 at Nashville.</LD>
<TE>   "The first period, I felt rusty, like I hadn't played in a while,"
Burke said. "I wasn't nervous. I was apprehensive. It took a while to
find my legs.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, your confidence is something you have to build upon. I
didn't know what to expect of myself."</TE>
<TE>   The Coyotes said they knew exactly what to expect from Burke.</TE>
<TE>   "He is one of the premier goalies in the league," Coach Bob
Francis said. "It is good to have him back."</TE>
<TE>   Burke credited Francis with the Coyotes' strong showing.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of focus," Burke said. "Bob Francis did a great
job this morning of really pumping us up.</TE>
<TE>   "Tonight was the kind of game you can play against any team in the
league and be successful."</TE>
<TE>   Ladislav Nagy, Tony Amonte, Daymond Langkow and Daniel Briere
scored to help the Coyotes end a two-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 3, Montreal 2 -- Martin Straka scored two goals in the
second period, helping host Pittsburgh win its fourth in a row and
end an eight-game winless streak against Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Islanders 3, Carolina 0 -- Chris Osgood made 25 saves at
Uniondale, N.Y., and helped the Islanders kill 10 penalties in
recording the 35th shutout of his career.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston 1, Atlanta 0 -- Rob Zamuner scored a power-play goal late
in the first period and John Grahame stopped 29 shots at Atlanta for
the fourth shutout of his career.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 6, Columbus 1 -- Brent Johnson made 26 saves at
Columbus, Ohio, and the Blues extended their unbeaten streak to four
games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Rangers 2, Florida 1 -- Darius Kasparaitis' first goal
this season, scored 56 seconds into overtime, lifted the Rangers at
Sunrise, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 2, Washington 1 -- Scott Niedermayer scored with 49.5
seconds left in overtime on a power play the host Devils got when the
Capitals were called for too many men on the ice.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 4, Nashville 2 -- Sean Avery had a goal and an assist, and
Kris Draper, Boyd Devereaux and Sergei Fedorov also scored for the
defending Stanley Cup champions at Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 4, Buffalo 3 -- Marian Gaborik had a goal and two
assists at Buffalo, N.Y., and Minnesota improved to 8-1-1 when
Gaborik, who finished with three points for the fourth time, has more

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton 3, Toronto 2 -- Todd Marchant knocked in his own rebound
at 4:35 of overtime at Edmonton, Canada, and the Oilers ended a
five-game losing streak.</TE>

<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>Mike Allen kicked a 37-yard field goal in overtime to send Wisconsin
to a 31-28 win over No. 14 Colorado in the Alamo Bowl on Saturday
night.</LD>
<LD>   Wisconsin's Brooks Bollinger threw two touchdown passes and ran
for a touchdown with 51 seconds left in regulation, with Allen
kicking the game-tying extra point. The Badgers (8-6) improved to 7-1
in bowl games under Coach Barry Alvarez.</LD>
<LD>   Allen, a walk-on, had to shake some jitters before his winning
kick.</LD>
<TE>   "I haven't been automatic from 37," said Allen, who was 11of 18
this season with a long of 48 yards. "Luckily today I was."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado (9-5) got the ball first in overtime but lost 2 yards on
three plays before Patrick Brougham missed a 45-yard field goal
attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Wisconsin then gained five yards on three consecutive runs to set
up the winning kick by Allen, who was mobbed by his teammates on the
field.</TE>
<TE>   Bollinger passed for 163 yards and ran for 82 more in the eighth
fourth-quarter comeback of the senior's career.</TE>
<TE>   "No question about it, this program needed this so bad," Bollinger
said. "Especially for the young kids, to point this program in the
right direction."</TE>
<TE>   Wisconsin started the season 5-0 before fading badly down the
stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Brown rushed for 97 yards and a touchdown on an Alamo
Bowl-record 28 carries for Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, who rushed for 1,744 yards during the season but missed the
last two games with a bruised sternum, also missed most of the fourth
quarter with a mild concussion.</TE>
<TE>   Don Strickland set an Alamo Bowl record with a 91-yard
interception return and D.J. Hackett caught two touchdown passes.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado starting quarterback Robert Hodge threw a touchdown and
three interceptions in the first half before he was lifted late in
the second quarter for Zac Colvin.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado badly missed Brown as it tried to hold a 28-21 lead after
Colvin threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to Hackett in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Wisconsin, which ranked second in the nation in turnover ratio,
nearly gave the game away with four against Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   The Badgers led 21-14 before a pair of fumbles changed momentum in
the third.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Leonhard's botched punt return set up Brown 4-yard touchdown.
Anthony Davis then fumbled on Wisconsin's next play from scrimmage to
set up a Colvin scoring strike to Hackett.</TE>
<TE>   Leonhard's Big Ten record-tying 11th interception of the season
set up Brandon Williams' 10-yard touchdown catch from Bollinger.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the best game of my life," Leonhard said. "It just
proves the character of this team."</TE>
<TE>   Bollinger's seven-yard pass play to Darrin Charles gave Wisconsin
a 21-14 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Brown took a while to get cranked up. He had just 34 yards in the
first half against a gang-tackling Wisconsin defense. He finally got
going in the third after Wisconsin's first fumble gave Colorado the
ball on the Badgers' 25.</TE>
<TE>   Brown carried seven consecutive times before bowling over three
defenders on a four-yard touchdown.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Tennessee State has suspended Coach Nolan Richardson III indefinitely
for an undisclosed violation of university policy.</LD>
<LD>   Richardson, the son of former Arkansas coach Nolan Richardson, was
suspended Friday and did not travel with the team to Ohio State for
Saturday's game.</LD>
<LD>   The suspension, first reported by Nashville television stations
and the Tennessean newspaper, was confirmed by the university in a
statement Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Assistant Hosea Lewis filled in as coach for the Tigers.</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA is investigating the program for rules violations under
Richardson. The inquiry involves allegations of impermissible
practice out of season, providing extra benefits to recruits and
unethical conduct by a coach.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson is 23-41 since he was hired at Tennessee State in April
2000. He played two seasons at Oklahoma State and was an assistant
under his father at Arkansas from 1991 to 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State defeated Tennessee State, 94-73.</TE>

<TE>   Luis Flores joined an exclusive club Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The junior guard had 24 points, 10 rebounds and six assists to
lead Manhattan to a 68-63 victory over Iona in the championship game
of the Holiday Festival at Madison Square Garden and was selected MVP
of the tournament for the second consecutive year.</TE>
<TE>   Only Jimmy Walker of Providence in 1965 and 1966 and Norman
Richardson of Hofstra in 1998 and 1999 won the award in consecutive
years.</TE>
<TE>   The only other players to win it more than once are Tom Gola of La
Salle (1952 and 1954), David Russell of St. John's (1979 and 1982)
and Chris Mullin of St. John's (1981 and 1984).</TE>

<LD>   UCLA (6-4, 1-0) at Oregon State (7-3, 1-0), 1 p.m., KTDD (1350),
KBET (850) -- The Bruins are seeking their first 2-0 Pacific 10 start
since 1999-00 and their first road sweep to open conference play
since 1998-99. UCLA is averaging 80.6 points, and the 93 points
scored against Oregon on Friday was its second highest point total
this season. The smallish Bruins continue to negate their height
deficiencies with a relentless full-court press that is responsible
for the bulk of 22 turnovers a game they force. Oregon State Coach
Judy Spoelstra earned her 200th coaching victory in the Beavers'
63-61 win over USC. Oregon State is 6-0 at Gill Coliseum, its best
home start since 1983-84.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   USC (5-6, 0-1) at Oregon (4-6, 0-1), 1 p.m. -- USC doesn't need to
stew over its two-point loss to Oregon State any longer. But the
Trojans certainly weren't happy the Beavers shot 32 free throws while
they shot 19, even if Oregon State missed 13. If the Trojans want to
avoid an 0-2 conference start for the second time in three seasons,
they will need to improve their second-half shooting. On Friday, for
the fourth time in its last seven games, USC made fewer than 10 shots
after halftime. Oregon's 25-point loss to UCLA was the second worst
home defeat in Pac-10 play. The Ducks were missing leading scorer
Cathrine Kraayeveld, who had inflammation in her right knee. Her
return date is undetermined.</TE>

<TE>   Loyola Marymount (5-6) vs. Siena (5-3) at Bozeman, Mont., 4:30
p.m. PST -- The Lions emerge from an eight-day rest to open play in
the four-team Montana State tournament. The Lions shot poorly at home
last Saturday in a 75-68 loss to Montana. Sophomore guard Charles
Brown scored 23 points, 21 in the second half, against Montana, but
the Lions couldn't overcome nine of 29 shooting (31%) in the first
half. Guard Prosper Kerwanga leads Siena with 15.9 points and 7.4
rebounds per game.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Seventh-ranked Illinois got an unpleasant surprise in the second

<LD>   "We lost the game in the first five minutes of the second half,"
Illinois Coach Bill Self said after the Illini fell, 77-74, to
Memphis on Saturday at Memphis, Tenn.</LD>
<LD>   After trailing at halftime, 37-31, Memphis returned to make three
consecutive three-point baskets to go up, 40-37.</LD>
<TE>   The Tigers (6-2) led by eight points three times in the second
half, but Illinois closed in the final minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Illinois (8-1) had a chance to tie the score, but Dee Brown's
three-pointer fell short with two seconds left. Brown, the team's
freshman standout, had 19 points for the game.</TE>
<TE>   "They outscored us [by] 10 points or so in the first four or five
minutes of the second half and then they controlled the game the rest
of the way," Self said.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Massie, in his first game of the season, scored 13 points
and had 10 of his 12 rebounds for Memphis in the second half. He was
academically ineligible for the first seven games.</TE>
<TE>   Massie wouldn't comment after the game, but Memphis Coach John
Calipari said he got just what he was expecting from the 6-foot-9
senior.</TE>
<TE>   "Chris Massie gives you what you need...." Calipari said. "I kept
saying to everybody, 'I like my team. I like my team.' We've got
three better wins than we did maybe all of last year already --
Mississippi, Syracuse and Illinois."</TE>

playmaking led the Panthers (9-0) on a 15-4 run just before halftime

<HD>It's Just Another Day for Pitino</HD>
<DH>Louisville coach takes his team's 81-63 victory over
Kentucky, his old school, completely in stride.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>If Rick Pitino took any extra satisfaction from his new team beating
his old team, he barely showed it.</LD>
<LD>   As the last seconds ticked off in Louisville's 81-63 victory over
No. 14 Kentucky at Freedom Hall on Saturday, Pitino got up from his
crouch on the sideline and calmly walked to midcourt to shake hands
with Wildcat Coach Tubby Smith, his former assistant.</LD>
<LD>   "Everyone will say, 'Well, he's holding it in,' but I love beating
Kentucky as much as I love beating anybody else," said Pitino, who
coached the Wildcats from 1989 to 1997 and led them to the 1996
national championship.</LD>
<TE>   But a smile sneaked across Pitino's face during his postgame news
conference.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any special feelings, but it would've been terrible
if we'd have lost," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky transfer Marvin Stone scored 16 points and Ellis Myles
had 11 points and 14 rebounds for Louisville (7-1), which ended a
three-game losing streak to its rival.</TE>
<TE>   Pitino avenged a 20-point loss to the Wildcats in his
much-ballyhooed return to Rupp Arena last December. He was making his
first appearance in his former home arena, and fans screamed insults
at him from the start in Kentucky's 82-62 victory.</TE>
<TE>   The rude reception stuck with the Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   "We really wanted to get this win for Coach, the way they treated
him last year," Myles said.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky (6-3) quieted the crowd with a fast start, dominating the
boards and building a 20-9 lead. The Wildcats got 15 of the first 16
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "I told my assistants if we don't start rebounding, we're
practicing tonight," Pitino said. "I don't know if my staff told my
team."</TE>
<TE>   But the rebounding evened out, and the Cardinals improved their
defense. Kentucky had only three baskets in the last five minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcats led 33-30 at halftime, but Erik Brown, who's from
Lexington, made a three-point basket with 17:03 left to initiate a
17-4 run by the Cardinals. Kentucky also missed nine of its first 10
second-half shots.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd noise intensified with each Louisville basket as the
lead bulged to 47-37 by the 14-minute mark.</TE>
<TE>   "The home court was the difference," Pitino said. "I know how much
this game meant to our fans."</TE>

<KH>OAKLAND 24, KANSAS CITY 0</KH>
<HD>Raider Situation Is Advantageous</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>The Oakland Raiders worked their "bad weather plan" to near
perfection.</LD>
<LD>   They ran and ran and ran.</LD>
<LD>   Charlie Garner made running in deep puddles and a steady downpour
look easy, cutting from side to side and grinding out yards in the
Raiders' 24-0 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs on Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Garner carried 29 times for 135 yards and a touchdown as the
Raiders (11-5) assured themselves of being top-seeded in the AFC
playoffs and earned a much-needed bye they will use to get healthy.
They shut out the Chiefs for the first time in franchise history --
the teams have played 88 times -- and will have home-field advantage
throughout the AFC playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I pride myself in being able to go out and run the football in
any conditions," said Garner, who for the first time since coming
across San Francisco Bay from the 49ers last season was not limited
in his carries.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since I came over I wanted [that chance]. It didn't present
itself until today," he said. "When it does, you take it."</TE>
<TE>   The Chiefs (8-8) had to win and have several other teams help them
to make the playoffs. They missed the postseason for the fifth
consecutive season.</TE>
<TE>   Rich Gannon completed four of his first five passes, but finished
seven for 14 for a season-low 79 yards and a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Gannon needed 475 yards to break one of the league's most
prestigious records: Dan Marino's 5,084 yards passing in 1984.
Gannon, one of the favorites for the NFL most valuable player award,
also fell short of becoming only the second quarterback to go over
5,000 yards in a season. He needed 390 to do that.</TE>
<TE>   "Fine with me," Gannon said. "That was not really my focus."</TE>
<TE>   Garner had a one-yard touchdown run early in the second quarter,
then on Kansas City's next possession, Rod Woodson intercepted Trent
Green to set up another Oakland touchdown -- a 15-yard pass play from
Gannon to Doug Jolley.</TE>
<TE>   Zack Crockett had an eight-yard scoring run in the fourth quarter
and Sebastian Janikowski kicked a 27-yard field goal.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City played without star running back Priest Holmes, who
was sidelined with a hip injury. Holmes leads the league with 2,287
yards from scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   The Chiefs managed only 63 yards in the first half -- 22 rushing
-- and 21 offensive plays to the Raiders' 39. The Chiefs also had
only three first downs before halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City did not reach the red zone until the final play of the
game when players were already walking onto the field from the
sidelines. The Chiefs failed on fourth down at the Raider 38 in the
third quarter and at the 30 in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "The offense sat there on the sideline and got cold and wet, and
then when we got back in there, we couldn't get in a rhythm," Chief
receiver and kick returner Dante Hall said.</TE>
<TE>   The rain fell hard from the start. The field was so soaked before
kickoff that the Raider logo in the middle of the field smeared and
paint was spread for several yards. The south end zone was a pool, as
was a 10-yard area at the other end of the field.</TE>
<TE>   But the Raiders surely prefer these conditions over the thought of
having to make another playoff trip to the frigid Northeast, where
they were eliminated last season in a snowy, disputed playoff loss to
eventual Super Bowl champion New England.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's win avenged a 20-10 loss at Kansas City two months ago
-- Oakland's lowest scoring output of the season.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders have been striving for offensive balance, and they're
finally getting it. For two straight weeks, the running game has
carried them. In a 28-16 win over Denver that earned the Raiders
their third division title in a row, Oakland used six straight
running plays in one touchdown drive.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Oakland ran for 280 yards, only the team's second
game over 200 this season.Aside from Garner, Crockett rushed for 72
yards and Tyrone Wheatley ran for 69. "We got here with the pass, and
now we can finish it with the run," left tackle Barry Sims said.</TE>

<KH>CLIPPER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Ankle Sprain Puts Jaric on Sideline</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like ships passing in the night (and on stormy seas), one Clipper
returned from the injured list and another's name was put on it.</LD>
<LD>   Lamar Odom returned to the court Saturday after an 11-month layoff
because of wrist and ankle injuries, but Marko Jaric had to go on the
injured list after suffering a high sprain of his left ankle during
Friday's loss against the Phoenix Suns.</LD>
<LD>   It's the same injury Odom suffered Feb. 18, but to the right
ankle. Remarkably enough, Jaric walked without a limp Saturday.
X-rays taken of his ankle were negative.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know what to think," he said as he entered the team's
locker room before Saturday's game against the Golden State Warriors.
"It's amazing. They put me on the injured list, but I don't know...."</TE>
<TE>   Jaric must sit out at least five games, which means he cannot be
activated until after the Clippers' game Jan. 5 against the San
Antonio Spurs. He had been filling in for shooting guard Eric
Piatkowski, who was put on the injured list Friday because of a lower
abdominal strain suffered Dec. 10.</TE>
<TE>   Piatkowski went on the injured list just as Corey Maggette was
activated after sitting out a month after undergoing arthroscopic
surgery on his right knee.</TE>
<TE>   Jaric, a 24-year-old rookie from Yugoslavia, averaged 10.1 points
and 5.2 assists in his last 10 games. His season averages are 7.9
points and 3.1 assists. He was the last player in Coach Alvin
Gentry's usual rotation to be sidelined by injury.</TE>
<TE>   "It may look like he's walking good," Gentry said of Jaric. "But
to actually make turns and cuts is another story. I was looking
forward to having him and Lamar and Andre Miller on the floor
together. They're three good ballhandlers who can move the ball and
create things."</TE>

<HD>Report: Brooks Hired as Coach at Kentucky</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former NFL coach Rich Brooks was in Kentucky on Saturday night amid a
report the Wildcats had asked him to become their football coach.</LD>
<LD>   CBS Sports said Kentucky had picked Brooks, who guided the St.
Louis Rams in 1995 and 1996.</LD>
<LD>   Reached at the couple's home in Oregon, his wife, Karen, told
Associated Press that he was in Kentucky, but would not say whether
the job was his. A call to Brooks' cell phone was not immediately
returned.</LD>
<TE>   Brooks Downing, media relations director at Kentucky, said he
couldn't confirm or deny the CBS report and said he didn't know
Brooks' whereabouts.</TE>
<TE>   Downing said that Athletic Director Mitch Barnhart would make an
announcement concerning the coaching job by Monday at the earliest.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, Grambling State Coach Doug Williams said Kentucky had
offered the job to someone -- but not him.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, a former Super Bowl most valuable player as quarterback
of the Washington Redskins, was in the running for the job. He said
Barnhart told him the school had selected another person.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks guided Oregon to its first Rose Bowl appearance in 37
years, when the Ducks lost to Penn State in 1995. He is Oregon's
career victories leader with 91 in 18 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks was the defensive coordinator for the Atlanta Falcons from
1997 to 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Guy Morriss resigned Dec. 9 as coach at Kentucky to become coach
at Baylor.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Karl Dorrell met with Idaho Coach Tom Cable on Saturday, the first
of at least four interviews the new UCLA coach will conduct this
weekend with prospective assistants.</TE>
<TE>   Cable, who was on the Colorado staff with Dorrell in 1998, said
earlier this week that he has a standing offer from Dorrell to become
offensive coordinator. Steve Axman of Washington and Jon Embree of
Colorado also are offensive coordinator candidates, although both
have said they are not inclined to leave their current jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Dorrell met with six UCLA assistants Friday, but did not meet with
defensive coordinator Phil Snow.</TE>
<TE>   As many as four of the current Bruin assistants could be retained.
Dorrell wants to hire six assistants by Jan. 2 to bolster recruiting
efforts and have his entire staff of nine assistants assembled by
Jan. 10, when several recruits are scheduled to make campus visits.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Six Fresno State players are ineligible for the Silicon Valley
Football Classic on Tuesday at San Jose because of academic problems.</TE>
<TE>   A Western Athletic Conference rule requires athletes to pass at
least six credits to play in a bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   The Fresno Bee identified them as defensive end Nick Burley,
linebacker Sam Williams, receiver Marque Davis, cornerback Demorieux
Reneau, left guard Fitu Tu'ua and linebacker David Adamo. All but
Adamo are starters.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Michigan State coach Bobby Williams, who was fired Nov. 4,
will receive $490,000 this week as part of his termination agreement
of $550,000, approved last month.</TE>

<HD>Grieving Wilfork Focuses on Future</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>The thoughts and tears come when Vince Wilfork is alone, usually
while he eats, watches television or lies in bed. And the sadness of
losing both parents within six months hits harder than any opponent
on the football field.</LD>
<LD>   The pain may never end, but the Miami defensive tackle expects it
will get easier to handle, especially with so many good things ahead
of him.</LD>
<LD>   Wilfork has the national championship game against No. 2 Ohio
State on Friday, the birth of his second child in February, his
graduation next December and then a probable career in the NFL. He
just wishes his parents could be around to share it.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not easy to do, but you have to look forward to things,"
Wilfork said. "If I dwell on my mother and my dad all the time, I'll
be a sad person, and I know they wouldn't want me to do that.... They
will be very, very, very missed, but I'll move on from here and make
the best of it."</TE>
<TE>   Having football to fall back on helps.</TE>
<TE>   Wilfork practiced with the top-ranked Hurricanes on Friday for the
first time since his mother's death on Dec. 16.</TE>
<TE>   He missed more than a week of practice, and coaches and teammates
weren't sure he would return for the Fiesta Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   But Wilfork never considered skipping the game. He knew all along
he would be here. His parents wouldn't have it any other way.</TE>
<TE>   "Football is my release," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Wilfork, 46, died five weeks after suffering a stroke Nov.
7. Her son missed the Tennessee game to be near her, then returned to
school.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately for him, he grew up about 60 miles north of Miami's
campus, making it possible for him to visit her regularly in the
hospital.</TE>
<TE>   So before school, after practice, sometimes between studying
videotape and working out, Wilfork would call to tell her he would be
there in about half an hour. When 30 minutes had passed, his cell
phone would ring. It would be his mother, asking him where he was.</TE>
<TE>   "When I got there, she would see me walking in that door and it
would just brighten up her day with that big smile of hers," Wilfork
said.</TE>
<TE>   Her smile is one of the things he'll miss most. It had come to
mean much more since his father, who "taught me everything I know,"
died in June from kidney failure as a result of diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   Wilfork spent countless days by his father's hospital bedside,
too, trying to understand all the machines and medications. David
Wilfork, 48, died just days after asking for and receiving his son's
national championship ring.</TE>
<TE>   "He was everything to me. Everything," Wilfork said. "There wasn't
a day that passed that I didn't talk to him. If I needed someone to
talk to, I always turned to him."</TE>
<TE>   Now Wilfork finds himself focused on the future:</TE>
<TE>   * The 6-foot-2, 350-pound sophomore expects to make a big impact
against the Buckeyes.</TE>
<TE>   * Wilfork and his longtime girlfriend, Bianca, have a 5-year-old
son, D'Andre, and a second child on the way. The baby girl, who will
be named Destiny, is due Valentine's Day.</TE>
<TE>   * Wilfork, who was forced to sit out the 2000 season because of
test scores, also is on pace to graduate in December, and he promised
both parents before they died that he would get his degree. That
means putting off the NFL for another year. "I know my mom and my dad
would probably kill me if I did [leave school], so I'm not going to
break my promise," he said.</TE>
<TE>   * He probably will be a first-round draft pick in 2004, especially
when considering that he leads the Hurricanes with 15 tackles for
losses and 29 quarterback hurries, despite missing a game and playing
backup to Matt Walters and William Joseph.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a bright future ahead of me, and I can't let something
like this go to waste," he said.</TE>

<LD>The opposing coach called it lucky. His own coach termed it
opportunistic.</LD>
<LD>   But there was no question that the goal scored by Matt Van
Berckelaer of Santa Ana Mater Dei was the game winner Saturday in the
Monarchs' 3-1 overtime victory against Dana Point Dana Hills in the
championship game of the Huntington Beach Marina boys' soccer
tournament.</LD>
<LD>   Defender Brad Smith gave Mater Dei (12-1-2) its final margin of
victory when he scored a goal with less than a minute left in the
20-minute overtime period. But Van Berckelaer broke a 1-1 tie five
minutes into overtime when he lobbed a shot over backpedaling Dana
Hills goalkeeper Andrew Schafer while battling defender Daryl Osborn
for the ball.</LD>
<TE>   "I just kind of reached my leg around him," Van Berckelaer said of
Osborn. "I saw the keeper coming out so I put it up over him."</TE>
<TE>   Dana Hills (9-4-1) took a 1-0 lead midway through the second half
when Rafael Guzman scored on a rebound of a Ryan Oakes shot that was
blocked by goalkeeper Jesse Forsythe. But Mater Dei, the No. 5-ranked
team in the Southland by The Times, tied the score a minute later
when Tim Chicoine scored after a long pass from midfield bounced past
goalkeeper Brian Mason.</TE>

<TE>   Senior goalkeeper Shannon Hilliker recorded her fourth shutout in
five games and seventh of the season and Dana Hills scored twice in
the second half to defeat Phoenix Horizon, 2-0, in the Foothill
tournament championship game.</TE>
<TE>   Junior stopper Jackie Zabek scored with an assist from Dianne
Pastier in the 43rd minute for the Dolphins (11-1-1). Senior forward
Emily Baker scored off a corner kick in the 63rd minute. To win the
tournament for the first time, the Dolphins beat defending champion
Santa Margarita, 3-2, in a semifinal.</TE>

<HD>On and Off the Court, She's a Coach for Life</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wife, mother, coach and teacher. At 41, Melissa Hearlihy is living
life to its fullest. She is the kind of role model teenage girls look
toward for guidance and inspiration.</LD>
<LD>   She has stayed in the trenches of high school coaching for 18
years trying to prepare girls to compete on and off the court.</LD>
<LD>   Based on championships and victories alone, she has been a runaway
success. Her basketball teams won 11 league championships and three
section titles in 15 years at Mission Hills Alemany High. In two
years at North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake, she has won one section
title and two league titles. This month, she earned her 400th victory
and her team is off to an 11-2 start.</LD>
<TE>   But Hearlihy wouldn't have passed up college jobs and continued to
juggle family responsibilities if coaching were only about
championships.</TE>
<TE>   She talks about a group of players who graduated from Alemany in
1990. Every year, they try to get together as part of a family
reunion.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been to each other's weddings, and it fulfills me in a
way that I don't think anything else could," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Making a difference in teenagers' lives is what motivates
Hearlihy.</TE>
<TE>   It might be requiring two girls to sit through practice in street
clothes for missing the middle school bus, to teach them a lesson
about punctuality. It might be running her players through a
strenuous conditioning drill to teach them about not giving up.</TE>
<TE>   She is a born leader who's not afraid to raise her voice and
demonstrate strength and toughness. Through athletics, she's teaching
girls ideas and instincts that will help them in the real world.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to be a little tougher and not so thin skinned, which
we tend to be," she said. "Our feelings get hurt much easier. I think
athletics gives us the avenue to be tougher and not so sensitive."</TE>
<TE>   Hearlihy and her husband, Bill, have been married for 10 years.
They have two sons, Josh, 9, and Kyle, 2. Hearlihy remembers asking
Josh what he thought of his teacher last year, Ms. Petty.</TE>
<TE>   "Ms. Petty is just like you," he said. "She's tough but fair."</TE>
<TE>   To gauge what impact Hearlihy has made on her players, take a look
at Sarah Webb, who graduated from Alemany in 1992. She hadn't played
competitive basketball until Hearlihy put her on the varsity team as
a freshman.</TE>
<TE>   Her first reaction was to quit after all the conditioning drills.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to be kidding," Webb said. "The soreness, the physical
endurance I'm going through. Even my dad was saying, 'This is crazy.'
"</TE>
<TE>   Webb survived and hasn't forgotten what it meant to play
basketball for Hearlihy.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the confidence you build from working hard and working
toward a goal and keeping focus carries through other life lessons,"
she said. "It was a great four years that I wouldn't trade for
anything."</TE>
<TE>   Webb has gone on to become a school psychologist and has two
infant boys with her husband, Rob, the athletic director at Claremont
Webb. Looking back, she marvels at how Hearlihy was able to coach,
teach and raise a family.</TE>
<TE>   "She never lost any dedication to the team," Webb said. "I don't
know how she did it. She always made us feel we were her No. 1
priority."</TE>
<TE>   Times have changed. At a much earlier age, girls are playing
basketball and aspiring to obtain college scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   "The [increased] availability of scholarships has made basketball
more influential in their life," Hearlihy said.</TE>
<TE>   Hearlihy was surprised to hear from Josh's teacher that he, too,
was talking about earning a scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'You got to be kidding.' She goes, 'Well, where's he
getting it from?' He's grown up in that world. That's what people
talk about," Hearlihy said.</TE>
<TE>   Through time management, Hearlihy demonstrates every day to her
players how to be a mother, wife and teacher.</TE>
<TE>   "The nature of my job allows my kids to be around," she said. "If
I was a doctor, I couldn't have them in the surgery room. If I was a
lawyer, I couldn't have them in the courtroom. Even though my hours
are long, there are days I spend time with my kids."</TE>
<TE>   Coaching high school basketball doesn't feel like a job to
Hearlihy. She may never stop because her husband won't let her.</TE>
<TE>   "He will do anything to help my program," Hearlihy said. "It would
never be in question to ever quit coaching. I may have to coach until
I die. Now that our kids are going to start going through coaches, we
know how important it is to have somebody to trust your kids with."</TE>
<TE>   Just last week, Eleanor Dykstra of Cerritos Valley Christian
picked up her 600th victory after 30 seasons coaching basketball.</TE>
<TE>   With coaches the caliber of Dykstra and Hearlihy leading the way,
girls won't be lacking in successful women role models.</TE>

<LD>The last eight San Gabriel Handicaps have been won only by trainers
in the Hall of Fame.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to the late Charlie Whittingham, who won with Rainbow
Blues five years ago, Richard Mandella won the Grade II in
consecutive years with Romarin (1995-96), Bobby Frankel scored with
Martiniquais in 1997, Brave Act won two in a row for Ron McAnally in
1998 and 2000, and Irish Prize won the last two renewals for Neil
Drysdale.</LD>
<LD>   Mandella, Frankel, Mc- Anally and Drysdale all have a chance to
win another San Gabriel today as the four have a majority of the 11
entrants in the $150,000 race at 1 1/8 miles on the turf. The San
Gabriel is the next-to-last leg of a pick six with a carryover of
$160,167.</LD>
<TE>   Besides Blue Steller, Frankel is also scheduled to be represented
by 8-5 favorite Decarchy, who will have a new rider in Jerry Bailey.</TE>
<TE>   The country's leading trainer also entered Sumitas, but he will
run in a softer spot Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   A troubled fourth in the Citation Handicap last month at Hollywood
Park, Decarchy has never lost at Santa Anita. He is perfect in three
starts on the local course with his most recent win coming in the
Jimmy Kilroe Handicap on March 2.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Wrangler, Say Florida Sandy, Late Carson and
Multiple Choice head the field in the $100,000 Gravesend Handicap at
Aqueduct. The Grade III sprint was supposed to be run Thursday but
was postponed when racing was canceled because of bad weather.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Kevin Krigger. Back in Northern California after
spending some time on the local circuit, Krigger had the best day of
his career Thursday, winning four races at Golden Gate Fields.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: The field in today's seventh at Golden Gate Fields. The
12 original entrants in the maiden claimer are a combined 0 for 108.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A trifecta in the second keying Secret
Approval on top with Maria's Mirage, Happy Michelle, Neeshanha and
Throw Me Roses in the two hole and all in the third spot.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/5. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $19/$31.60. Total money bet: $52.</TE>

<HD>Writer's Cramp Is a Concern for Murray</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before every game, Coach Andy Murray writes down on a board the
numbers of the players he expects to see in both teams' lineups, with
the injured Kings listed in the left corner.</LD>
<LD>   After Alexander Frolov (cut cheek), Eric Belanger (back) and Bryan
Smolinski (eye) were added to the list, Murray agreed that he'll soon
need a longer board if the Kings continue to lose players to injury.</LD>
<LD>   "Isn't that incredible?" Murray said after practice Saturday
morning. "You can put a pretty good team together with those guys on
the left side."</LD>
<TE>   But for every injured Jason Allison (knee), Adam Deadmarsh
(concussion), Aaron Miller (abdominal), Steve Heinze (concussion),
Ken Belanger (concussion) and Erik Rasmussen (back), there's a fresh
chance for such young players as forwards Jerred Smithson and Jared
Aulin.</TE>
<TE>   Forward Brad Chartrand, who got his chance to break into the King
lineup full-time last season, said the new faces add a sense of
excitement to the team.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a test for our team because it's an exciting challenge,"
said Chartrand, who will be asked to step up on offense when the
Kings play the Colorado Avalanche, the team that has knocked them out
of the playoffs the last two seasons. "The new faces are going to be
hungry. For some of them, it's going to be their first game in the
NHL. It's a chance for them to show their stuff."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Belanger and Rasmussen were put on the injured list Saturday to
make room on the active roster for Aulin and Steve Kelly, who were
recalled from Manchester of the American Hockey League.</TE>

<LD>Although Morning Snow didn't get a chance to run for a $1-million
bonus this month in the Los Alamitos Million, the Kindergarten and Ed
Burke Memorial winner does hold the distinction of running the
fastest 350 yards of the 2001-02 meet.</LD>
<LD>   The 2-year-old filly went 350 yards in 17.35 seconds, the quickest
time at what is the most often run distance for quarter horses at Los
Alamitos.</LD>
<LD>   The only track record set during the meet was by Classic First,
who went 220 yards in 11.68 seconds several months ago.</LD>
<TE>   Among the thoroughbreds, Cielo Canosa and Oh To Win shared the
fastest 4 1/2-furlong clocking. They both won in 50.70 seconds; the
fastest time for an Arabian at the same distance was 57.40 by Allegro
Aa.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Fishers Chick. 2. Our Flying Chick. 3. Emperor's
Victory. 4. Jusred. 5. Traffic Attraction. 6. Watching The Pie. 7.
Dynamo Nitro. 8. Bcr Grab The Cash.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Peggy Perfect, Traffic Attraction and Finish First Baby
Cs in the fifth; Watching The Pie, Flirtatious Phyllis and Bw
Annihilator in the sixth; single Dynamo Nitro in the seventh and use
Bcr Grab The Cash, Tougherthantherest and Shakin Assets in the
eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Ub In My Heart is debuting in a bad race in the

<HD>Trail Blazers Win in Sacramento</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Portland Trail Blazers aren't letting anything distract them from
playing winning basketball.</LD>
<LD>   Bonzi Wells scored a season-high 32 points and Rasheed Wallace had
30 as the Trail Blazers won their seventh in a row, a 119-113
overtime victory over the Sacramento Kings on Saturday night at
Sacramento.</LD>
<LD>   Portland has dealt with its share of off-court problems this
season.</LD>
<TE>   "We put all the adversity behind us, all the stuff that was
written and said," Wells said. "Now we're just concentrating on
playing and trusting each other."</TE>
<TE>   Wells showed no effects from missing the last two games because of
a suspension -- he had 23 first-half points and added seven rebounds
and six assists for the Blazers, who outscored Sacramento, 17-11, in
overtime.</TE>
<TE>   The win ended Portland's five-game losing streak at Arco Arena.
The Blazers, who have four consecutive road games over the next week,
have won seven of their last nine away from home.</TE>
<TE>   "We're coming together right now," Coach Maurice Cheeks said. "The
key is the commitment to the team."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bibby had 22 points, seven rebounds and six assists for
Sacramento, which was coming off its biggest win of the season,
Christmas Day against the Lakers. Chris Webber had 20 points and 10
rebounds, but missed 16 of 24 shots and had six turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone knows they are one of the most talented teams around,"
King Coach Rick Adelman said of the Trail Blazers. "They are on a
roll right now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 101, Boston 95 -- Tracy McGrady scored 25 points and Mike
Miller had 20 at Orlando, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   The Magic played without Grant Hill, who has tendinitis in his
left ankle. Hill has sat out six games this season, and played no
more than 10 minutes in three others. He will have tests Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The Magic averted a four-game losing streak against Boston, which
got 34 points and nine rebounds from Paul Pierce.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 107, New York 82 -- Steve Nash scored 19 points and Nick
Van Exel scored 15, helping the host Mavericks to their first
100-point effort in five games.</TE>
<TE>   Latrell Sprewell had 16 points for New York, which had its most
lopsided loss this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Utah 98, Philadelphia 69 -- Karl Malone and Matt Harpring each
scored 20 points to help extend Philadelphia's road losing streak to
five games.</TE>
<TE>   The Jazz made 36 of 72 shots and won for the fourth time in five
games.</TE>
<TE>   Malone and Harpring, a former 76er, each had eight rebounds. The
Jazz outrebounded the 76ers, 45-33.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 109, Chicago 95 -- Tony Parker scored 32 points at
Chicago, matching a career high, and the Spurs won their seventh of
nine.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Williams scored 15 of his 23 points from three-point range,
but it wasn't enough to help the Bulls avert their third consecutive
loss.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 104, Milwaukee 96 -- Kenyon Martin scored 24 points and
Jason Kidd had 23 at Milwaukee, and the Nets completed a
home-and-home sweep of the Bucks.</TE>
<TE>   Lucious Harris, who scored 25 points in the Nets' 110-90 victory
over the Bucks on Friday, had 17 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 91, New Orleans 84 -- Ron Artest scored 23 points, and
reserve Erick Strickland scored 12 of his 20 in the Pacers' decisive
run at Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Strickland, who replaced an ineffective Jamaal Tinsley at point
guard, sparked a 16-9 rally in the last 3:21.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 106, Minnesota 82 -- Richard Hamilton scored 24 points,
and Chauncey Billups had 21 against his former team at Auburn Hills,
Mich.</TE>
<TE>   The Pistons improved to 8-3 against the Western Conference -- best
of any Eastern Conference team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Washington 84, Atlanta 76 -- Jerry Stackhouse scored 15 of his 29
points in the fourth quarter at Washington, and the Wizards ended a
three-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   The Hawks lost their ninth consecutive road game.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A new year beckons, which is good news for at least two teams around
here.</LD>
<LD>   Lakers: Hi! We're your defending three-time champs! We know we've
got you a little worried but that's nothing, compared to what we're
feeling here at Ground Zero. We've all been a little cavalier, but
we'll try our best to dig ourselves out of this hole. If we can't,
hey, live and learn, or get busted and learn faster.</LD>
<LD>   Shaquille O'Neal: I resolve to get over it, just as soon as they
get me eight teammates who can play.</LD>
<TE>   Mitch Kupchak: What do you mean by "can play"?</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal: Let's say, good enough to make the Kings' roster.</TE>
<TE>   Kupchak: In that case, do you think you could get by with four
teammates who can play?</TE>
<TE>   Phil Jackson: No, really, after the holidays we'll make our move.
I'm thinking next Labor Day.</TE>
<TE>   Charley Rosen: Not that this came from Phil or Tex Winter or
anyone else giving me a ride to the hotel, but if Kobe Bryant would
just pass more sometimes, and shoot more at others, the Lakers would
be fine.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant: Hello, Mike? It's Kobe again.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Jordan: I learned my lesson this time. No more comebacks,
ever. In basketball, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Donald T. Sterling: I'm puzzled again. I still want to win as much
as I ever did.</TE>
<TE>   Clipper fans (in unison): That's the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Sterling: No, seriously. It's like I told my friend, T.J., when
last I tried to embrace him, if Elgin Baylor wants to keep those
little whiners, we will, as long he uses his own money. By the way,
if you're so hot to keep them, you can kick in a few bucks too.</TE>
<TE>   David Stern: First, let me say how pleased we are to have
survived, er, to be here. With our continuing efforts at
globalization and with the development of our young stars, it's good
to be back where we belong as a new millennium dawns before us.</TE>
<TE>   Russ Granik: Uh, David, our attendance is actually still a little
soft ...</TE>
<TE>   Stern: The millennium I'm talking about is the 3000s. We'll be OK
by then, won't we?</TE>
<TE>   Portland Trail Blazer owner Paul Allen: Bob, you know I prefer to
stay in the background while I'm out buying one of everything. But
I'm worried that by staying silent, it makes it look as if I'm OK
with this little reign of terror our guys seem to be visiting upon
Portland.</TE>
<TE>   Trail Blazer General Manager Bob Whitsitt: No problem. I asked the
guys to be more careful. They said from now on, they'll be little
angels. By the way, did you see that the Cleveland Cavaliers
suspended Ricky Davis for going off on John Lucas and most of his
teammates? We already have about four guys at his position, but we
could pick him up and he has only an $18-million deal.</TE>
<TE>   Allen: Sure. I think I have that much on me.</TE>
<TE>   Stern: In the meantime, does anyone want to buy a women's league,
only slightly tarnished?</TE>
<TE>   Madison Square Garden President James Dolan: I told the press what
a great team we have, but I don't think they're going for it. We're
losing, our players are old and no one wants any of them. Oh, and
we're going to have to come up with $40 million in luxury tax this
summer.</TE>
<TE>   Cablevision CEO Charles Dolan: That's OK, son.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte (N.C.) Mayor Pat McCrory: Let's see, we can keep the
Hornets with George Shinn and Ray Wooldridge, or start all over with
Larry Bird and an expansion team. We'll take the expansion team!
Here's the new arena you needed. Oh, Larry won't be joining us?</TE>
<TE>   Bird: Talk about a broken dream. Someone else puts up $300 million
and I get a piece of an NBA franchise. This is heartbreaking. Oh,
well, back to Florida and more golf.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Tagliabue, Bud Selig and Gary Bettman: Give us this again:
You've got this city that hates your owners so much, it won't build
them another arena to replace the other one that it built, which is
only 14 years old, so they split ... and then you put another
expansion franchise and get another arena in the same city? For,
like, 10 times the original $32.5 million?</TE>
<TE>   Stern: I had no choice.</TE>
<TE>   Tagliabue, Selig and Bettman: We're not worthy!</TE>
<TE>   Shinn: To show our commitment to morality as well as championship
basketball, we'll ask a dignitary to offer a prayer before each game.
Please stand for tonight's invocation by New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin.</TE>
<TE>   Nagin: Bless us all with health and peace, take the Hornets to the
NBA Finals and if we run into the Lakers, please have the Earth open
up under Shaq's feet and swallow him whole. Amen.</TE>
<TE>   Ernie Johnson: Charles, they're coming back to us, turn off "Blind
Date" and get over here.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Barkley: Like I was saying, Jay Williams will still wind
up being the rookie of the year, or I'll kiss Kenny Smith's donkey
again!</TE>
<TE>   Donkey: Do I get a vote in this?</TE>
<TE>   Faces and Figures</TE>
<TE>   Now it's the Sacramento Kings' turn: Said Vlade Divac after their
Christmas Day victory over the Lakers, "They are not close to the
team we played in the playoffs. It's much harder to play the
Clippers. But if we play our game, we know we can beat anybody."</TE>
<TE>   King co-owner Joe Maloof, who reportedly spent $30,000 on four
courtside seats, on O'Neal's "Queens" jab: "We made some jerseys and
shirts that read 'Sacramento Queens' for our team store. They're not
our bestsellers, but it's been worth it."</TE>
<TE>   Boston's Paul Pierce, told that Miami's Caron Butler says he
patterned his game after Pierce's: "I guess it's sort of like a
compliment as for how far I've come. But I'm like, man, I'm 25 and
there are 17-year-olds and 18-year-olds coming into the league." ...
Chicago's Jalen Rose, whose school, Michigan, forfeited the games he
played there, on being told that Ron Mercer is wearing his old No. 5
with the Indiana Pacers: "Someone will probably be wearing it in Ann
Arbor soon, since I don't have a college career anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee's Sam Cassell, on underachieving teammate Tim Thomas:
"He's talented enough that we don't have to spoon-feed him. You've
got to go get it and I think he realizes that. Tim has to pick his
times when he has to go. He has to get himself involved. That's what
good players do. Only centers let the guards get them involved.
You're a big guy, but you ain't a center. Chase the ball." ...
Cleveland's Davis, challenging Indiana's Ron Artest for the
unofficial title of wackiest great player, woofed and laughed in the
Pistons' faces en route to his third 40-point night in the Cavaliers'
recent upset. Said Detroit's Corliss Williamson, "It ticks you off,
but if you think about it, if you were having the type of game he
was, you would probably be doing the same thing. I really wanted to
get a hard foul on him, but I never could."</TE>
<TE>   Karl Malone, bristling at criticism about shooting a career-low
42% -- he's a lifetime 52% shooter who never dipped under 49% until
last season -- argued at practice with Coach Jerry Sloan, who had
previously noted, "If you're running the pick and roll and you don't
roll, you can blame somebody else all you want, but who's supposed to
roll? Somebody else roll for you? You can punish other people all you
want, but you've got to accept responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   The Jazz then won in Dallas, Memphis and Houston.</TE>
<TE>   After a storm had knocked out the lights during the Houston
Rockets' game with Utah, the teams agreed to finish with only half of
them back on. The Jazz players proceeded to make their last four
shots, showing, said the Houston Chronicle's Jonathan Feigen, they
can, indeed, run their offense in the dark.... Orlando's Grant Hill,
after shooting three for 17 and taking 15 rebounds in a victory over
the Pistons: "I was doing my best Ben Wallace impression."</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The Utah Jazz's game against the Philadelphia 76ers was interrupted
briefly Saturday night when a rat was thrown onto the court.</LD>
<LD>   Utah's Karl Malone was about to take his second of two free throws
with 4:13 left in the second quarter when the rat landed on the
court. It was thrown from the top of the lower deck and skidded to a
stop at Malone's feet.</LD>
<LD>   Malone was startled and took a step back, while teammate Scott
Padgett walked over and kicked the rat under the front row next to
the Jazz bench. Utah assistant trainer Terry Clark scooped up the
dead rodent in a towel and disposed of it.</LD>
<TE>   The person responsible for throwing the rat ran from the arena and
went across the street to a shopping complex, where he eluded
security guards.</TE>

<LD>**** Makings of a classic</LD>
<LD>   *** Smash-mouth football</LD>
<LD>   ** Good for an end around</LD>
<TE>   * Strictly fantasy fodder</TE>
<TE>   * Minnesota (5-10) at Detroit (3-12), 10 a.m.: Viking Coach Mike
Tice is safe, so the only suspense will be waiting to see what
becomes of Lion Coach Marty Mornhinweg and General Manager Matt
Millen. At least they can tell the unemployment office that they have
experience now. LINE: Minnesota by 3 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   ** Dallas (5-10) at Washington (6-9), 10 a.m.: Reasons to watch?
There are plenty. Darrell Green's final game. Emmitt Smith needing 38
yards to reach 1,000 for the 12th consecutive season. Dave Campo
keeping an eye out for a Bill Parcells sighting in the tunnel. LINE:
Washington by 7.</TE>
<TE>   * Tennessee (10-5) at Houston (4-11), 10 a.m.: It's not how you
start, but how you finish, right? If Texans can somehow bookend their
season-opening victory over Dallas with a victory over the
playoff-bound former Houston Oilers, those shredded Enron documents
can be put to use for a ticker-tape parade. LINE: Tennessee by 9.</TE>
<TE>   **** Miami (9-6) at New England (8-7), 10 a.m., Channel 2, KNX
(1070): Quick trivia question: Which team has the longest current
streak of reaching the playoffs? If you said the Miami Dolphins, five
seasons, you're right. If you say the Miami Dolphins after today,
there's a good chance you'll be wrong. LINE: Miami by 1.</TE>
<TE>   ** Baltimore (7-8) at Pittsburgh (9-5-1), 10 a.m.: Steelers
hinting that a loss wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing since their
momentum wouldn't be slowed for the playoffs. But with no break
between conference title games and Super Bowl, players might want to
rethink that mentality. LINE: Pittsburgh by 7  1/2.</TE>
<TE>   * Cincinnati (2-13) at Buffalo (7-8), 10 a.m.: High drama for the
Bengals as they try to prevent themselves from becoming the worst
version in team history. Never has Cincinnati won fewer than three
games in a season. LINE: Buffalo by 7.</TE>
<TE>   *** Atlanta (9-5-1) at Cleveland (8-7), 10 a.m., Channel 11:
Oddsmakers were at a loss this week trying to figure out the last
time a visiting team with only one more victory than the home team
was favored to win. Then again, Browns only have victories over
Cincinnati and Houston at home this season. LINE: Atlanta by 3.</TE>
<TE>   ** Carolina (6-9) at New Orleans (9-6), 10 a.m.: Said Saint center
Jerry Fontenot: "We can't blame anybody else for us being where we
are." Saints are 5-0 against first-place teams and 0-2 against
last-place teams. The Panthers are a last-place team. LINE: New
Orleans by 7.</TE>
<TE>   ** Jacksonville (6-9) at Indianapolis (9-6), 1 p.m.: Thank
goodness for Colts they have clinched a postseason spot since they
have looked like anything but a playoff team lately, losing two of
their last three. One thing they don't need this week is a must-win
situation. LINE: No line.</TE>
<TE>   *** Green Bay (12-3) at New York Jets (8-7), 1:15 p.m., Channel
11, KNX (1070): If after all the morning games the Jets still have a
chance for a playoff spot, look for that fourth-quarter push. New
York is 6-2 in its last eight and has outscored its opponents, 63-9,
in the final quarter during that span. LINE: New York by 1.</TE>
<TE>   ** Seattle (6-9) at San Diego (8-7), 1:15 p.m.: After such a
promising start (6-1) fizzled for the Chargers, here's some more
feel-good news: If not for missed field-goal attempts in overtime by
San Francisco's Jose Cortez and Denver's Jason Elam, San Diego would
be riding an eight-game losing streak. LINE: San Diego by 3.</TE>
<TE>   ** Arizona (5-10) at Denver (8-7), 1:15 p.m.: Shannon Sharpe is in
cheerleader mode, needing Atlanta, Green Bay and Miami to win this
week for the Broncos to have a chance at the postseason. "You'll pull
for almost anybody to get you where you need to be." That's the
spirit. LINE: Denver by 11.</TE>
<TE>   ** Tampa Bay (11-4) at Chicago (4-11), 5:30 p.m., ESPN, KLSX-FM
(97.1): Warren Sapp knows where he'll be all day as the playoff
scenarios unfold, but don't expect the Champaign, Ill., Chamber of
Commerce to hire him as spokesman any time soon: "They say there's
not a lot to do in Champaign, other than watch TV." LINE: Tampa Bay
by 7.</TE>
<TE>   * San Francisco (10-5) at St. Louis (6-9), Monday, 6 p.m., Channel
7, KNX (1070): Even Ram quarterback Jamie Martin doesn't sound
convincing when trying to build up a game that defines the term
"meaningless": "Everyone's going to be watching, it's the last game
of the year, all that stuff." LINE: No line.</TE>

<LD>Issues, the NFL had issues during its 2002 season. And with only a
few final quarters left to be played, some of them have even been
resolved ...</LD>
<LD>   Bledsoe or Brady?</LD>
<LD>   New England Patriot fans grappled with this one for months, opting
for the status quo through Tom Brady's 3-0 start, glancing enviously
at departed Drew Bledsoe as Brady lost his next four starts, rallying
behind Brady after he beat Bledsoe in Buffalo, and standing firmly
behind their man as Bledsoe struggled down the stretch ... until
Brady lost successive starts to the Titans and the Jets.</LD>
<TE>   Statistical breakdown: Brady has the edge in completion percentage
(62.5 to 60.8), passer rating (87.1 to 84.9), touchdown passes (27 to
23) and interceptions (13 to 15). Bledsoe has the edge in yards
(4,128 to 3,543).</TE>
<TE>   Head to head: Brady won both meetings by a cumulative 65-24
margin.</TE>
<TE>   Bottom line: Brady can still win the AFC East title if things fall
right today. Bledsoe made the Pro Bowl, but he has one touchdown pass
and six interceptions in his last three games. In the process,
Buffalo dropped to 7-8 and out of contention.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ricky or Deuce?</TE>
<TE>   The biggest trade of the off-season gave Miami the AFC's leading
rusher and left New Orleans with the NFC's top rusher and two extra
first-round draft choices. Ricky Williams broke the Dolphin
single-season rushing record weeks ago and has 1,668 yards before
today's regular-season finale against the Patriots. Deuce McAllister
stayed behind in New Orleans to rush for 1,271 yards. Williams has 14
rushing touchdowns, McAllister 13.</TE>
<TE>   So, it was the fabled trade-that-helps-both-teams?</TE>
<TE>   Not quite. Both Williams' Dolphins and McAllister's Saints are
9-6. For New Orleans, that's an upgrade -- the Saints went 7-9 in
2001. But Miami was 11-5 in both of the two seasons preceding
Williams' arrival.</TE>
<TE>   If the Dolphins lose and Atlanta defeats Cleveland today, the
NFL's biggest trade of 2002 will leave Williams and McAllister, with
3,000 yards rushing between them, on the sidelines as the playoffs
begin.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Emmitt or Hambrick?</TE>
<TE>   The thumbnail on Emmitt Smith's clawing, scratching pursuit of
Walter Payton's rushing record used to be: The old Cowboy is putting
his interests ahead of the team, which would be better off handing
the ball to Troy Hambrick and building for the future instead of
celebrating the past.</TE>
<TE>   Then Smith got the record right before Halloween. Before the
confetti could be swept up, Hambrick was popping off about
time-to-get-me-mine. Cowboy Coach Dave Campo, who already had too
much on his plate, tried to placate Hambrick, which caused Smith to
gripe about not getting his due respect. Then Campo tried to placate
Smith, which resulted in successive victories before San Francisco's
fourth-quarter rally on Dec. 8 knocked the wind out of the Cowboys,
who lost their next two games by a combined 64-10.</TE>
<TE>   Smith needs 38 yards today for his 12th consecutive 1,000-yard
season. Hambrick, reassigned to the background, has 311 yards in 78
carries. Per-carry averages are virtually the same -- 4.1 for Smith,
4.0 for Hambrick.</TE>
<TE>   The Cowboys are one loss away from their third consecutive 5-11
season. More Smith or more Hambrick wouldn't have made much of a
difference for Dallas, which needed much more out of its quarterbacks
and coaches.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier or Schottenheimer?</TE>
<TE>   Redskin owner Daniel Snyder knew what he'd be getting if he stayed
with Marty Schottenheimer: discipline, defense, off-tackle runs, 8-8.</TE>
<TE>   If he is half as smart as he thinks he is, Snyder also should have
known what he'd be getting with Steve Spurrier: lively news
conferences, never-ending controversy, three very dizzy occasionally
starting quarterbacks.</TE>
<TE>   There have been no surprises anywhere, including in San Diego,
where Schottenheimer landed and is one defeat today from bringing the
Chargers in at 8-8. Spurrier is 6-9, averaging two wins per
quarterback used, and along the way he probably figured out what the
league had been trying to tell him: You won't win in this league with
Shane Matthews and/or Danny Wuerffel leading your offense.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Ramsey? Spurrier says he'd like to build around the kid in
2003. But there are many college bowl games and scouting combines to
cross before then.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gruden or Dungy?</TE>
<TE>   Tony Dungy couldn't win a playoff game in Philadelphia while he
was coaching in Tampa, so his move to Indianapolis seemed the perfect
arrangement for everyone concerned.</TE>
<TE>   The Colts hadn't won a playoff game since 1995, and missed them
altogether in 2001, so Dungy represented an upgrade there.</TE>
<TE>   With Indianapolis, Dungy would not be required to win a playoff
game in Philadelphia, Philadelphia being in the other conference.</TE>
<TE>   And Jon Gruden, the man replacing Dungy at Tampa Bay, would surely
improve the offense and find a way to beat the Eagles.</TE>
<TE>   Is everybody happy?</TE>
<TE>   Not quite. Gruden's Buccaneers look strikingly similar to Dungy's
Buccaneers -- they rank first in defense, 22nd in offense, and if
Brad Johnson doesn't play, Tampa Bay's playoff run will be a short
one.</TE>
<TE>   Dungy turned the Colts' longtime sieve of a defense into an asset,
has won nine games and returned Indianapolis to the playoffs. He also
finally won a game in Philadelphia this season, 35-13. Gruden lost
his visit to the Vet, 20-10.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gruden or Callahan?</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers went 9-7 before making the Gruden trade. With a
victory over the Bears today, they will finish 12-4 with him.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders went 10-6 in their last season with Gruden. His
replacement, Bill Callahan, finished 11-5, winning the AFC West with
a team older than the one Gruden left behind. The Raiders stand to
get younger in 2003, holding the Buccaneers' first- and second-round
picks in the next NFL draft.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Warner or Bulger?</TE>
<TE>   Right, right, Kurt Warner went 0-6, Marc Bulger went 6-0, ring in
the new era immediately and ship Warner back to the Arena League.</TE>
<TE>   We've heard it all from the panicked masses in St. Louis, who need
to catch their breath and take another look at the teams Bulger
defeated: Oakland -- a nice one, granted -- followed by Seattle,
Arizona, San Diego, Chicago and Arizona again.</TE>
<TE>   And for all the talk about Warner's fragility, Bulger has been no
less brittle.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's game will be the fourth start Bulger will have to miss
because of injury.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams might want to hold off on mothballing Warner's jersey and
remember the league MVP trophy he won ... last January.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Alignment or Realignment?</TE>
<TE>   Despite much sky-is-falling hysteria over an 11-5 team possibly
getting left off the playoff express, the league, and the republic,
survived realignment.</TE>
<TE>   One reason: heading into Week 17, only three teams were assured of
11 victories.</TE>
<TE>   In the first season of realignment, 11-5 teams don't get jobbed
out of the playoffs -- they get carried to their postseason
appointments on royal litters amid burning incense and fanning palms.</TE>
<TE>   Had the NFL used the old alignment -- three divisions and three
wild cards per conference -- the results heading into the final
Sunday wouldn't be much different:</TE>
<TE>   NFC divisional champions: Philadelphia (East), Green Bay
(Central), San Francisco (West).</TE>
<TE>   NFC wild cards: Tampa Bay and the New York Giants, with Atlanta
and New Orleans scrambling for the third.</TE>
<TE>   AFC divisional champions: Tennessee (Central) and Oakland (West)
would have clinched, with Indianapolis leading the East.</TE>
<TE>   AFC wild cards: Pittsburgh. With 9-6 Miami and six other teams
scrambling for the other two.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Favre or Gannon?</TE>
<TE>   They are the favorites for the MVP award, and it will be tough to
vote against Rich Gannon, who broke the single-season record for
completions, chased Dan Marino's yardage record until the final week
and prodded an old Raider team to another division title.</TE>
<TE>   But where would the Packers be without Brett Favre? Certainly not
12-3, undefeated at home, with a chance to win home-field advantage
throughout the playoffs. No other quarterback could have stepped into
that situation -- his top three receivers from 2001 gone, his
offensive line a shambles -- and produced the same results.</TE>
<TE>   And if the Packers do get home-field advantage, Favre will
probably be spending late January in San Diego, prepping for his
third Super Bowl, with not a patch of tundra in sight.</TE>

<KH>ORANGE BOWL / USC vs. IOWA</KH>
<HD>Simpson Warmly Received at USC Practice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DAVIE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The voice was familiar, the gait halting, and the scene surreal.</LD>
<LD>   O.J. Simpson ended a near decade-long estrangement from USC's
football program Saturday when the 55-year-old former Heisman Trophy
winner limped toward the sideline during the Trojans' first
full-contact practice for the Orange Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Simpson, who moved to Miami three years ago and is in need of knee
replacement surgery, attended the practice at the invitation of
senior running back Justin Fargas.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think I could ever feel disconnected from 'SC, I really
don't," said Simpson, who shook hands, signed autographs and posed
for pictures with onlookers.</TE>
<TE>   After practice, USC players and coaches warmly received Simpson
with handshakes and hugs before inviting him to their makeshift
locker room.</TE>
<TE>   "It was good to have him out here," USC Coach Pete Carroll said.
"At 'SC, our guys hold a Heisman Trophy winner in the highest regard.
For them to get a chance to see him and visit with him was very
special for them."</TE>
<TE>   Simpson, who won the Heisman in 1968, said he had not attended a
USC practice since Ted Tollner coached the then-struggling Trojans in
the mid-'80s. Asked when he last had contact of any kind with a USC
football team, Simpson replied, "It's been a while ... probably since
my ordeal."</TE>
<TE>   Simpson was referring to one of the most sensational legal sagas
in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Simpson was acquitted of murder charges in connection
with the June 12, 1994, stabbing deaths of his former wife Nicole
Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald L. Goldman at her home in
Brentwood.</TE>
<TE>   But Simpson was subsequently found liable for $33.5 million in
civil damages in an action brought by the victims' families in Santa
Monica Superior Court. Last April, Simpson filed suit in Los Angeles
federal court to overturn the judgment.</TE>
<TE>   USC's players, in their early teens or younger at the time of the
initial legal proceedings, remain cognizant of Simpson's notoriety.</TE>
<TE>   "It's at the back of anybody's mind," junior offensive lineman
Lenny Vandermade said. "You're not going to totally block it out, but
you try to look at him in a positive manner and not put a negative
spin on it. I just kind of remember him as a football player and what
he did for 'SC."</TE>
<TE>   Simpson, one of the most prolific running backs in college and pro
football history, was the second of USC's five Heisman Trophy
winners. Mike Garrett (1965), Charles White (1979), Marcus Allen
(1981) and Palmer, this year's winner, are the others.</TE>
<TE>   Fargas, who has known Simpson for years, made a request before the
season to wear Simpson's retired No. 32 jersey, but was dissuaded by
Carroll for fear of a public backlash. Fargas invited Simpson to
Saturday's practice at the behest of several teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "He's such a big part of the tradition at 'SC and a lot of guys
have never seen him," Fargas said.</TE>
<TE>   Trojan players and coaches appeared stunned when Simpson,
accompanied by several friends, hobbled through the entrance to the
field wearing black sweat pants, black sneakers, a yellow golf shirt
and a black windbreaker draped over his shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   "The myth becomes reality," senior cornerback Darrell Rideaux
said.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson smiled, joked and fulfilled autograph and photo requests
that seemed to grow exponentially as word of his surprise presence
traveled.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson, who lives with his daughter Sydney, 16, and son Justin,
14, said he watches USC games on satellite and is pleased by the
Trojans' return to national prominence. He is undecided about
attending Thursday's game.</TE>
<TE>   "We got pushed around too much the last 15 years or so," he said.
"This year was the first time I saw us play the kind of ball that I
felt was why I came to 'SC. That fourth quarter, we were getting
after people."</TE>
<TE>   Simpson said he once played a major role in Trojan recruiting by
calling high school players, visiting USC when recruits were on
campus and entertaining them in his home.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he would like to play a role in USC's football program,
he replied, "Not really. They seem to be doing all right."</TE>
<TE>   When practice ended, Simpson congratulated Palmer and posed for a
few more photos.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great to finally have another Heisman winner at 'SC," he
said to the fifth-year senior. "But a quarterback?"</TE>
<TE>   Simpson hitched a ride on a golf cart for a trip to the Trojans'
locker room, where he signed more autographs for players and staff.</TE>
<TE>   When the last player was gone, Simpson slowly shuffled toward the
parking lot. The warm reception the Trojans offered was not atypical,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Occasionally, someone will yell something," he said. "For a
while, on the golf course, someone would say something, but I can't
remember the last time that happened. I'm not naive ... some people
don't like me, but what you saw out there today is normal. The public
has been very good to me. A lot better than the media."</TE>
<TE>   Simpson made his way to a black Lincoln Navigator, where Fargas
sat in the front passenger seat with Simpson's friends in back.</TE>
<TE>   As he climbed into the driver's seat and pulled on his seat belt,
Simpson said, "We are ... 'SC."</TE>

<HD>Better Late Than Never</HD>

<LD>Having Oklahoma in the Rose Bowl takes a little getting used to,
since the game traditionally features teams from the Pacific 10 and
Big Ten, but because of the bowl championship series configuration,
the Sooners, a Big 12 team, are here. Unfortunately for Coach Bob
Stoops, it's a year too late.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, the Rose Bowl was the national championship game and
Oklahoma was looking to repeat its 2000 national championship. The
Sooners lost to Oklahoma State in their final regular-season game and
were eliminated from the national championship picture.</LD>
<LD>   "Coaching a Rose Bowl isn't something you count on when you're at
Oklahoma," Stoops said Saturday. "But I was hoping we might be here
last year."</LD>
<TE>   Stoops, however, is no stranger to the Rose Bowl. He played in the
1982 Rose Bowl as a defensive back for Iowa and was a graduate
assistant coach for the Hawkeyes in the 1985 game. Iowa lost both
times, which explains Stoops' all-business attitude Saturday, which
included a closed practice at Loyola Maymount and no media access to
players. After trips to "The Tonight Show" and Disneyland, Stoops
wanted to stress the importance of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "This is as big as it comes," Stoops said. "I think that the
players understand the game is the most important experience they
will have here. I told them that winning is the most important thing
far and away because out of everything they do on this trip, the
outcome of this game is what they will remember most for the rest of
their lives."</TE>
<TE>   Stoops has other motivation, too.</TE>
<TE>   "[Oklahoma] hasn't played in a Rose Bowl," he said. "And at a
school with our great tradition you don't often get the opportunity
to be the first to do something. But with all the trophies we have in
our case, we don't have a Rose Bowl trophy."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl is three days away, but Washington State has already
scored a lopsided victory in a bowl of sorts.</TE>
<TE>   The Cougars won the 47th "Beef Bowl" at Lawry's restaurant, easily
consuming more prime rib than Oklahoma at one of the Rose Bowl's
long-standing traditions.</TE>
<TE>   When all the plates had been cleared, organizers were stunned by
the final count: Washington State had downed 585 pounds of prime rib
Thursday, Oklahoma only 440 pounds Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the biggest differences in beef bowl history," said
Todd Erickson, a Lawry's spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State had 134 people in its dining party, compared to
108 for Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State fans shouldn't be too happy that Oklahoma got too
full too quickly. Before the 1998 Rose Bowl, the Cougars consumed
more beef than Michigan, but lost the game, 21-16.</TE>
<TE>   Offensive lineman Brett Rayl ate a team-high seven cuts of prime
rib for Oklahoma. Four players ate four cuts each for Washington
State.</TE>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alex Acker scored 29 points and his three-point basket to start the
second overtime gave Pepperdine the lead for good in a 116-110
victory over Arkansas Little Rock in the opening round of the Lobo
Invitational on Saturday night at Albuquerque.</LD>
<LD>   Pepperdine (7-4) tied the score, 89-89, at the end of regulation
on Terrance Johnson's 24-foot three-pointer with one second left.
Acker's 10-foot jumper in the lane with 30.3 seconds left in the
first overtime tied the score, 100-100, and forced the second
overtime. Arkansas Little Rock (7-5) went for the last shot in the
first overtime. Jibrahn Ike put up a shot in the lane, which was
blocked from behind by Acker.</LD>
<LD>   Acker's three-pointer 13 seconds into the second overtime gave the
Waves a 103-100 lead and Pepperdine built the lead to 110-103 with 58
seconds left on a layup by Robert Turner.</LD>
<TE>   Pepperdine used an 18-2 run to take a 41-28 lead -- the biggest of
the game for either team -- with 5:53 left in the first half. The
Trojans got within 46-42 at halftime by scoring the last eight points
of the first half.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine 96, Indiana Purdue Fort Wayne 79 -- Jordan Harris and
Stanislav Zuzak came off the bench to score 18 points each as the
Anteaters led from start to finish before 1,997 at the Bren Center.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine (5-3) won its fifth in six games as six players scored in
double figures. Guard Ross Schraeder had 15 points in his first start
of the season and center Adam Parada had 14 points, eight rebounds
and three blocked shots.</TE>
<TE>   Parada had been struggling and had lost his starting job to Greg
Ethington. He said extra work on defensive position in practice paid
off Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "Staying out of foul trouble and staying on the court was the big
key," said the junior, who had fouled out of his last two games.
"It's hard to get into the flow if you're on the bench."</TE>
<TE>   Against a porous Mastodon defense, the Anteaters shot 62% in the
first half and took a 54-32 lead at intermission. Mike Efevberha had
all of his 13 points in the half as Irvine dominated from the outset.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Collins was the lone bright spot for the Mastodons (2-11) as
he scored a game-high 36 points. Collins had 21 of his points in the
first half, including five three-pointers. He finished with nine
three-pointers in 13 attempts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 75, CS Fullerton 61 -- Darrell Tucker had 23 points
and 11 rebounds as the Dons defeated the depleted Titans at San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   James Bayless and Shamell Stallworth had 10 points each for the
Dons (4-6).</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton, which suited up only seven players because of a rash of
injuries, got 16 points from Bron Groomes.</TE>
<TE>   Derick Andrew had 13, Jamal Forcheney 11 and Zakee Smith 10 for
the Titans (2-7), missing their two leading scorers Ralphy Holmes and
Pape Sow, with shoulder and ankle injuries respectively.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Washington 89, CS Northridge 80 -- Will Conroy scored 26 points
for the Huskies at Seattle as Washington (5-4) went over .500 for the
first time under new Coach Lorenzo Romar.</TE>
<TE>   Conroy, who averaged 2.5 points last season, leads the team this
season with a 15.0 average.</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Northridge (6-4) scored the first basket of the second
half, but then went the next six minutes without making a field goal.
During that stretch, Washington went on a 15-5 run and from that
point its lead was never threatened.</TE>
<TE>   After a five-game winning streak, the Matadors have lost two in a
row. John Clark scored nine of the Matadors' first 11 points and
finished with a career-best 22. Lionel Benjamin had 15.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bucknell 67, UC Santa Barbara 60 -- Kevin Bettencourt scored 19
points and Chris Rodgers had 18 to lead Bucknell in the consolation
game of the ASU/azcentral.com Hoops Classic at Tempe, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   Rodgers made seven free throws in the last 53 seconds to keep the
Bison (5-5) ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Branduinn Fullove had 18 points for the Gauchos (3-7), who have
lost five in a row for the first time since 1998-99, Bob Williams'
first year as coach.</TE>

<HD>Oregon Doesn't Give UC Riverside a Break</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EUGENE, Ore.</DL>
<LD>After a 108-67 thrashing of UC Riverside on Saturday, Oregon's Luke
Ridnour proclaimed the Ducks recovered from the holiday break and
ready for Pacific 10 Conference play.</LD>
<LD>   Ridnour scored 24 points and Luke Jackson had 20 as No. 11 Oregon
beat the overmatched Highlanders for its school record-tying 23rd
straight home victory.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Johnson added 12 points and 12 rebounds for Oregon (9-1),
which opens its Pac-10 schedule Thursday night against No. 4 Arizona.</LD>
<TE>   "That game right there was to get us back in rhythm," Ridnour
said. "It was a good chance to run and get ready for the Pac-10
season.</TE>
<TE>   "Once the Pac-10 starts, it's a whole new season."</TE>
<TE>   Oregon's lone loss this season came against Cincinnati on Dec. 17
in the Jimmy V Classic. The Ducks had been ranked as high as No. 5
after a victory over then-No. 14 Kansas on Dec. 7.</TE>
<TE>   "We got done what we needed to accomplish in the nonconference
season," Oregon Coach Ernie Kent said. "We have been thoroughly
tested."</TE>
<TE>   Nate Carter and Kevin Butler each had 14 points for UC Riverside
(1-5), which dropped its third straight. Coach John Masi kept his
players in the locker room long after the game with a loud lecture.</TE>
<TE>   With 23 straight wins at historic McArthur Court, Oregon matched
the school record set from Feb. 13, 1937, to Jan. 6, 1939. That team,
dubbed the Tall Firs, won the 1939 national title.</TE>

<HD>Virginia's Lundy Sets Himself Apart</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Wali Lundy spent most of his life chasing Avon Cobourne. In their
first head-to-head meeting, he finally passed him.</LD>
<LD>   Lundy scored four touchdowns and gained 239 all-purpose yards as
Virginia ended a four-game bowl losing streak Saturday with a 48-22
victory over No. 15 West Virginia in the inaugural Continental Tire
Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Cobourne, who graduated from Holy Cross High in southern New
Jersey four years before Lundy, ran for 117 yards and two touchdowns
for West Virginia.</LD>
<TE>   "Growing up, a lot of people always tried to measure me against
him," Lundy said. "I never did. I always tried to be my own player."</TE>
<TE>   Before he could finish talking about his days following Cobourne,
Virginia Coach Al Groh interrupted his star freshman.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think this guy needs to measure himself against anybody,"
Groh said. "He's going to be a big-time player."</TE>
<TE>   Lundy, who came in averaging 53.8 yards rushing and 27.6
receiving, ran for 127 and caught five passes for 76 yards. He scored
touchdowns on runs of four and 31 yards. He caught a 14-yard
touchdown pass from Marques Hagans and a 48-yard touchdown pass from
Matt Schaub.</TE>
<TE>   He said Cobourne had little to say to him after the game.</TE>
<TE>   "He just said, 'Good game,' " Lundy said. "You don't really want
to talk to another player after a game like that."</TE>
<TE>   Cobourne, who said he barely knows Lundy, praised his performance.</TE>
<TE>   "He played well. I mean, he represented," Cobourne said. "He's got
the talent, he started as a freshman, so I knew he had it in him. I
was hoping he wouldn't unleash it today."</TE>
<TE>   Schaub, the ACC player of the year, passed for 182 yards and a
touchdown, and Hagans returned a punt 69 yards for his second
touchdown as the Cavaliers (9-5) won their first postseason game
since the 1995 Peach Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia did an excellent job slowing Cobourne, the Big East's
all-time leading rusher, who was averaging 141 yards before the game.</TE>
<TE>   He ran for 54 in the first quarter and scored on a six-yard run
but didn't gain a single yard in the second quarter. He finished with
117 yards -- the 28th 100-yard game of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Cobourne added a one-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Cobourne ended his career with 5,039 yards, ninth-best in NCAA
Division I-A history.</TE>
<TE>   West Virginia is 9-4.</TE>

<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It cuts against the grain of what any coach preaches, but the most
effective UCLA player has been the one who has practiced the least.</LD>
<LD>   Andre Patterson continued his stellar play since becoming eligible
Dec. 13, blocking four shots, grabbing five rebounds and scoring
eight points on three-for-five shooting in 23 minutes against
Michigan.</LD>
<LD>   The sophomore forward is shooting 72.2%. He has been a strong
presence on defense as well, blocking seven shots in the 64 minutes
he has logged in four games since returning.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm just bringing energy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Forward Dijon Thompson did not play because of soreness in his
left knee. He is expected to play Thursday in the Pacific 10
Conference opener at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson, the team's sixth man and the leading scorer with a 17.0
average, did not practice Thursday and went through light drills
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   He woke up Saturday with soreness and trainers decided to hold him
out.</TE>
<TE>   His absence was felt. Michigan was able to focus on stopping Jason
Kapono, who was held to five points.</TE>
<TE>   "Dijon is such a threat," Coach Steve Lavin said. "With him out,
the [Michigan] defense could tag Jason. We had one less threat on the
floor."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ray Young did not start for the second time this season. The first
time, against Duke, he was held out because he was late to a meeting.</TE>
<TE>   This time Lavin said he merely wanted to shake up the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "With Dijon hurt, I wanted a spark off the bench," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Point guards Cedric Bozeman and Ryan Walcott started and the
Bruins were behind, 18-11, when Young came into the game. His leaner
in the lane pulled UCLA within 25-23 with 7:42 left in the first
half.</TE>
<TE>   He finished with nine points, five rebounds and four assists in 17
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman center Ryan Hollins, who played only two minutes of
garbage time against Kansas last Saturday, did not play against
Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Fey, the Bruins' other freshman center, scored six points
in 11 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UP NEXT</TE>
<TE>   Thursday at Washington, 7 p.m. -- The Bruins begin Pac-10 play
against the Huskies, who are 5-4 in their first year under Coach
Lorenzo Romar, a former UCLA assistant. The Bruins defeated
Washington twice last season.</TE>

<HD>Hutchinson Gives Ankle Some Rest</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Injured senior point guard Robert Hutchinson has not practiced since
severely spraining his right ankle Dec. 21 and he is not expected to
play again until the Trojans' third Pacific 10 Conference game, Jan.
8 at UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   "It will probably be up to Hutch, mostly, when he's ready to come
back," Coach Henry Bibby said Saturday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   Hutchinson initially sprained the ankle in the Trojans' loss at UC
Santa Barbara on Dec. 3. After sitting out USC's Wooden Classic
defeat against Missouri four days later, he re-injured the ankle last
weekend against La Salle when a pile of players rolled up his leg
during a scramble for a loose ball.</LD>
<TE>   Being in the middle of a stretch that has USC playing only once in
21 days has its advantages, Bibby said, dismissing the notion that
such a lull will make the Trojans (4-3) rusty for their Pac-10 opener
Thursday at Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been great," he said. "We've had time to teach. Guys have
had time to relax a little bit because there hasn't been pressure on
them and we've saved guys' legs. It's been a good time for us to be
off. I love it."</TE>
<TE>   The respite was made possible when, for the first time since 1997,
nonconference games were scheduled on the weekends after the Trojans
play UCLA. USC will play host to Pennsylvania on Jan. 11 at the Forum
and play at Nevada Las Vegas on Feb. 9.</TE>

<LD>An eager coach at USC's practice Saturday sprinted from one field to
another taking copious notes about everything from stretching
exercises to pass plays that stretch defenses.</LD>
<LD>   Lou Holtz, coach at South Carolina, was on a learning mission
after the Gamecocks finished 5-7. Holtz, who won a national
championship at Notre Dame, was impressed with the practice run by
Trojan Coach Pete Carroll, one of his proteges.</LD>
<LD>   "I'd never seen his practice," said Holtz, who hired Carroll as a
graduate assistant at Arkansas in 1977. "Normally most of my life,
we've been in a bowl game. But this is one of those years. I want to
make sure it never happens again."</LD>
<TE>   Carroll said Holtz called and asked if he could observe the
Trojans, who are preparing for Thursday's Orange Bowl against Iowa.
Holtz joined the coaches for breakfast and was introduced to the
players.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll go back and share the things with our team about the way
Southern Cal does things," said Holtz, who was 9-1-1 against USC when
he was coach at Notre Dame. "You always learn. I've never learned
anything by talking. I've only learned by listening and watching.
When I do interviews I don't learn a whole lot."</TE>
<TE>   Holtz said he was "privileged" to watch offensive coordinator Norm
Chow in action.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just so glad he didn't take the Kentucky job," Holtz said. "I
hope he stays out on the West Coast. I told him you get all kinds of
viruses when you go East."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll was part of an Arkansas staff that coached the Razorbacks
to an 11-1 record in 1977, including an Orange Bowl victory over
Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the great memories I have in coaching," Carroll said.
"It's one of the things that really showed me what the top end can be
like. I was hooked from that point on."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said the presence of former Heisman Trophy winner O.J.
Simpson and Holtz was not a distraction. "The energy on the practice
field surprised me -- maybe that had something to do with it,"
Carroll said. "Our guys are used to some flash and they kind of
answered the call today."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some players were disappointed, others thrilled that a chartered
fishing excursion was canceled because of high winds.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard there were big swells," Carroll said. "The guys can cast
off the back deck of the hotel."</TE>

<LD>Some people think Pullman, Wash., is at the end of the earth.</LD>
<LD>   Washington State linebacker Will Derting can only laugh.</LD>
<LD>   He and his family live on a remote ranch 30 miles from Okanogan,
Wash., with 2,000 head of cattle, a couple hundred horses and no
telephone service.</LD>
<TE>   Pullman is downright metropolitan to him.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles?</TE>
<TE>   "You can just drive and drive and there's cement forever," Derting
said. "It's nice to see a different place. I don't think I could live
here, though."</TE>
<TE>   Derting is from a place where you can still see the stars in the
night sky.</TE>
<TE>   At the team's hotel in Beverly Hills, the stars the players have
seen include Chris Webber of the Sacramento Kings, model Tyra Banks
and talk-show host Larry King.</TE>
<TE>   Derting hasn't caught a glimpse of any of them, but he has seen
some nice cars.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some Lamborghinis near there. We went and took pictures
of them the other day," he said, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   His heart is on the ranch.</TE>
<TE>   "The Columbia River is 200 feet from my house. I love it out
there. We've got TV, running water, the dish," Derting said. "But
still no phones. My aunt lives like two miles from me, and she has a
phone."</TE>
<TE>   The Cougars are just glad they convinced him to leave for a while
-- though Derting did once take a weekend off to help with the
branding at home.</TE>
<TE>   He made his mark quickly this season at Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   A redshirt freshman, Derting intercepted three passes in the
season opener against Nevada, returning one 98 yards for a touchdown.
He missed five games because of an ankle sprain in the second game,
but returned and later started the final four.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, he says it's probably easier to lasso a running back
than it is to take down a calf.</TE>
<TE>   "Depends on how big the calf is," Derting said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defensive tackle Rien Long fielded an assortment of "How slow is
Pullman?" questions, and responded with his wry wit.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that small," Long said. "And there is Moscow, which is a
whole other 10,000 people."</TE>
<TE>   Moscow, just across the state line, is the home of the University
of Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Backup quarterback Matt Kegel didn't practice Saturday after
twisting his back Friday, but Coach Mike Price said he expects Kegel
to be fine for the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Price, generally glad to throw his practice open to the media,
fans and recruits, will close all but 15 minutes of practice today.</TE>
<TE>   "I've just got to put some new trick plays in," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He also canceled Tuesday's final practice, and will simply hold a
walk-through in the hotel ballroom.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll just cool it," he said. "Besides, the traffic. Have you
noticed?"</TE>

<KH>THE UNTOLD WAR</KH>
<HD>Chasing Phantoms Across Afghanistan</HD>
<DH>A year after the fall of the Taliban, U.S. Special Forces
face a war in which the enemy won't fight and victory is undefinable.</DH>
<SE>ABOUT THIS SERIES: This is one in an occasional series
chronicling untold stories from the war in Afghanistan. To view more

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CHAGHCHARAN, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>With machine guns rocking in their
turrets, a convoy of Special Forces soldiers plowed into this
mountain town in pursuit of enemy fighters one cold winter afternoon.
What they found instead was a knot of rumors and contradictions.</LD>
<LD>   The local police intelligence chief, squatting on the dirt floor
of his compound, told the Americans intriguing tales of armed Taliban
and Al Qaeda supporters massed in a nearby valley. The soldiers
braced for battle.</LD>
<LD>   But in a rooftop redoubt across the street, the provincial
governor sat on a cushion with an automatic rifle tucked beneath his
hip and assured them that all enemy forces had been driven from the
area.</LD>
<TE>   Later, the local militia general, presiding over this grimy
provincial outpost from a hilltop fortress, offered yet another
scenario: There were no enemy fighters left, but some armed men in
the area sympathized with the Taliban and Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-man "A" team from the Army's 20th Special Forces group had
just stumbled upon what soldiers call "ground truth" -- the complex
and often confounding reality of the combat zone. Their bruising
17-day mission through the wilderness of western and central
Afghanistan this month produced no hard truths, only versions.</TE>
<TE>   More than a year after U.S. forces and their Afghan allies toppled
the Taliban regime, Special Forces teams are chasing ghosts. The
specially trained soldiers are primed for combat but frustrated by a
war in which the enemy refuses to fight and victory is not clearly
defined.</TE>
<TE>   With the American public and U.S. policymakers fixated on Iraq,
the Special Forces are locked in an unseen war here. A year ago, the
teams tracked and targeted the enemy for devastating airstrikes,
working closely with commanders of the Northern Alliance militia.
Today, their mission is radically different -- an ungainly mixture of
combat patrols, intelligence-gathering, nation-building and efforts
to win hearts and minds.</TE>
<TE>   Three-quarters of the Special Forces personnel in Afghanistan
today are citizen-soldiers from the National Guard and Reserves.
Their presence frees active-duty Special Forces to train for a
possible war in Iraq. For the first time in a combat zone, Special
Forces here are commanded by a National Guard officer.</TE>
<TE>   The 20th Special Forces team came to Chaghcharan, the capital of
remote Ghowr province, to purge the area of any lingering enemy
fighters. Because no U.S. forces had been to the region, the team was
ordered to report on the presence of armed militiamen, their
loyalties and their weapons, and to divine the intentions of warlords
and commanders who ostensibly backed the government of President
Hamid Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   It soon became evident that Ghowr, like virtually every other
province outside Kabul, the capital, was beyond government control.
It was one more example of the obstacles facing the U.S. military in
its long-term strategy of training a new Afghan national army to
replace warlords and militias.</TE>
<TE>   Long Road to Capital</TE>
<TE>   Just getting to Chaghcharan from Herat, 320 miles to the west
along the ancient Silk Road, was an ordeal. Vehicles got stuck in
mud, slid down icy ravines and were slowed by dust storms and
snowdrifts.</TE>
<TE>   The men navigated by hand-held global-positioning devices and
detailed Pentagon maps, yet they still needed help from shepherds and
old men on muleback to find their way. They carried the U.S.
military's most lethal weapons, but the only enemy they shot was a
dog that threatened their campsite.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the most innocuous situations, the soldiers never let down
their guard.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a bounty on our heads -- and they'd love to get a
Special Forces guy," said Mike, a medical sergeant, referring to
reports that Al Qaeda has offered $50,000 for an American soldier,
dead or alive.</TE>
<TE>   (Under ground rules governing media access to Special Forces
personnel, they can be identified by rank and first name only.)</TE>
<TE>   In Chaghcharan, a trading center made up of flimsy huts and muddy
streets, the men set up a safe house in a dilapidated former Taliban
guesthouse near a dirt airstrip, where they had a clear field of fire
out the front. But they worried about a hilltop behind them that
offered anyone with a weapon a clean shot. Every day, a long row of
men squatted, like crows on a line, and stared down at them from the
hilltop from dawn to dusk.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans spoke neither Dari nor Pashto -- trained for Latin
America, they speak Spanish -- so they relied heavily on their
civilian interpreter, Shafiq, an Afghan American bank manager from
Virginia. Shafiq, 33, was born in Kabul and raised in the U.S. from
age 14.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts to sort out who supported the Taliban and who did not --
and whether any Taliban or Al Qaeda holdouts remained -- were
frustrated by wildly divergent claims and counterclaims. Particularly
maddening were sessions with the police intelligence chief, a gaunt,
hollow-eyed former communist named Arafi.</TE>
<TE>   At their first meeting, Arafi made a show of ordering his
bodyguards out of his command post, saying he had something
confidential to share with the Americans. He told them that the
nearby Badgah Valley held 1,000 armed Taliban supporters. The valley
was "a mousetrap," he said. "They will let you in, then close off
your escape and kill you all."</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers retreated to their safe house to discuss the chief's
claims. The prospect of actually fighting and killing the enemy
seemed to energize them.</TE>
<TE>   John, 40, the team's intelligence sergeant, pointed out that Arafi
had refused to lead them to the valley unless American warplanes
bombed it and hundreds of U.S. troops went in. John didn't trust the
man, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now," Mike told his comrades, "the only people I trust are
standing in this room."</TE>
<TE>   The team commander, a soft-spoken captain named Dave, announced
his decision: They would drive into the heart of the valley in two
days' time.</TE>
<TE>   On the 10th day of the mission, the soldiers took two Humvees and
a modified Chevrolet Blazer, bolstered by thick blast blankets and
loaded with weapons, deep into the Badgah Valley. Dave stayed behind
with four Afghan guards to protect the safe house.</TE>
<TE>   At each village along the way, Shafiq questioned peasants, who
told an intriguing story: There had indeed been Taliban and Al Qaeda
fighters in the valley, enough to fill 40 to 50 vehicles. But they
had left three months earlier for new hideaways in Helmand province
to the south.</TE>
<TE>   The convoy pushed on. At a village near the far end of the valley,
where the intelligence chief reported that the Taliban had recently
attacked and killed several people, a few men sat idly in the
shuttered bazaar. Tumbleweeds blew through the dirt.</TE>
<TE>   Villagers said there had been no battle and no Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   "Forget it," said Ed, an Atlanta police lieutenant who serves as
the team sergeant. "There's nothing here."</TE>
<TE>   They drove back through the peaceful valley to Chaghcharan, where
they planned to have another talk with the intelligence chief.</TE>
<TE>   Dealing With the 'Muj'</TE>
<TE>   The Special Forces men had begun their mission 10 days earlier,
pulling out of Herat in a freezing rain. Their orders ran on for 10
pages: "Destroy Taliban and Al Qaeda forces and deny them
sanctuary.... Aggressively ID target(s) and destroy enemy forces....
Pursue survivors and establish U.S. presence."</TE>
<TE>   The enemy MLCOA (most likely course of action) was listed as
hit-and-run attacks, indirect fire and drive-by shootings. The MDCOA
(most dangerous course of action) was suicide bombings and
"improvised explosive devices."</TE>
<TE>   The convoy included a Toyota pickup carrying four young Afghan
gunmen supplied by Ismail Khan, the warlord who rules Herat and four
surrounding provinces. Supplied with American cash and weapons in the
war that dislodged the Taliban, Khan and other warlords now provide
the only measure of stability and security outside Kabul, often
through corrupt and brutal methods.</TE>
<TE>   The Special Forces team regarded Khan's men as a necessary evil.
The "muj," as they called them (though these gunmen were infants
during the Afghan moujahedeen's war against the Soviets), were kept
on a tight leash. The Americans knew they would report everything
they saw or heard to Khan.</TE>
<TE>   The men on this mission are from a National Guard unit based in
Auburn, Ala. Called up in August, they left behind wives and families
who know they are in Afghanistan but not what they are doing, or
where.</TE>
<TE>   The team commander, Dave, 38, owns a small computer company in
Atlanta. He relies heavily on the leadership of three veteran police
officers from the Atlanta area: Ed, 40, a master sergeant adept at
logistics and planning, and two streetwise staff sergeants, Dan, 43,
and Mike, 41.</TE>
<TE>   As they rolled toward Chaghcharan, they were on a "special
reconnaissance mission" with "direct action" potential. In other
words, they were looking for trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Canine Attack</TE>
<TE>   On the first night, they shot a dog. Frank, 35, the communications
sergeant, was on guard duty when a huge dog, growling and snarling,
bounded into the campsite.</TE>
<TE>   Frank threw rocks, but the animal kept charging. Finally, Frank
tagged him with a laser on his M-4 rifle, then squeezed off two
rounds. The dog yelped and fled, trailing blood.</TE>
<TE>   "Just a dog! Just a dog!" Frank hollered as the soldiers rolled
out of their sleeping bags, reaching for their weapons.</TE>
<TE>   As the men were breaking camp the next morning, a woman from a
nearby village approached. She said her husband had been smashed in
the forehead with a rock in a dispute over wheat.</TE>
<TE>   The medics, Mike and Dan K., 34, an emergency medical technician
from Alabama, hiked down into the village and found a man named
Baitulla, 45, with a glob of animal fat plastered on his forehead, a
home remedy. They peeled off the dried fat, cleaned the wound and
closed it with five stitches.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Dan," Mike said as they left. "Make a note to include some
Crisco in the medical kit."</TE>
<TE>   Providing medical care is part of the team's work. The visit
allowed John, the intelligence sergeant, to question villagers about
enemy activity. The team also handed out leaflets urging Afghans to
support the central government and report any Taliban or Al Qaeda
members.</TE>
<TE>   During the six days it took to drive to Chaghcharan, the team had
stopped at remote mountain villages to question village headmen on
military matters and assess humanitarian needs.</TE>
<TE>   It was like traveling back to the Middle Ages. The area has no
electricity, no running water, no telephones. Even in winter, some
people are barefoot and wrapped in ragged wool blankets. Many had
never seen an American and were only vaguely aware of the Sept. 11,
2001, attacks. The Special Forces convoy might as well have been from
another planet. At the sight of it, men and boys stopped in their
tracks and stared blankly.</TE>
<TE>   Every hour, the soldiers radioed their position to their
commanders. Every night, they sent an encrypted "sit rep" --
situation report -- via satellite phone.</TE>
<TE>   Late each afternoon, Ed, the team sergeant, began searching for a
"RON site," a place to remain overnight. The muj were dispatched to a
ridge line for perimeter security. The vehicles were parked inside a
triangle formed by the Humvees, their machine guns and grenade
launcher pointed outward.</TE>
<TE>   As the long trip wore on, the crowds of curious men and boys
waiting to greet the convoy grew larger. The team began to suspect
that the muj were using a radio, supplied by Khan, to notify gunmen
at upcoming checkpoints so they could cease any illegal activity --
such as demanding bribes or intimidating villagers. Ed ordered the
radio confiscated.</TE>
<TE>   The four muj turned sullen. Their pickup began to develop
mysterious engine ailments, delaying the convoy.</TE>
<TE>   After one delay dragged on for nearly an hour, Frank confronted
one of the muj, who told him, "It's in Allah's hands."</TE>
<TE>   "No," Frank said. "It's in our hands. We're leaving in 30 minutes
-- with you or without you."</TE>
<TE>   Minutes after Frank stalked back to his Humvee, the Toyota was
magically repaired and the convoy was on its way.</TE>
<TE>   On the fifth night, the convoy reached its highest point -- a
mountain pass at nearly 10,000 feet. The team decided to continue,
partly to hone night driving skills and partly because there was no
place to camp along the icy escarpments.</TE>
<TE>   Frank was at the wheel of the convoy's rear Humvee. Cameron, 30,
an engineering sergeant, was in the turret, manning a .50-caliber
machine gun.</TE>
<TE>   As Frank tried to negotiate a narrow curve, the edge of the
roadway collapsed. The Humvee, 12,000 pounds with armor and gear,
toppled over an embankment. Frank and Cameron tumbled inside, banging
their heads against flying ammo and equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Frank fumbled in the dark for his radio and said: "We flipped
over. Come on back." His voice was so faint that he had to repeat the
message three times before it got through.</TE>
<TE>   The men below gunned their engines and sped back up the mountain.
Dan K., the medic, suspected Frank had suffered a mild concussion.
Cameron was in worse shape. The soldiers strapped him to a backboard
and secured his neck in a brace. They wrapped him in blankets and
placed him onto the hood of a Humvee, the engine heat warming him as
the vehicle slowly rumbled down into a clearing.</TE>
<TE>   The team radioed for a medevac helicopter. They were told it would
take 40 minutes. But with each subsequent communication, it seemed to
the soldiers that no one else felt any particular urgency about the
situation. They thought it was because they had radioed Cameron's
vital signs, which were in the normal range.</TE>
<TE>   Special Forces commanders at three locations discussed by radio
how to respond. The team listened in, realizing that a helicopter
still had not been dispatched.</TE>
<TE>   The men cursed the delays. To Dan, it seemed another example of
"ground truth" -- that sharp discrepancy between what men on the
ground know to be true versus what commanders in the rear believe.</TE>
<TE>   Through the long night, Dan K. never left Cameron's side. He spoke
gently to him, joking and teasing as Cameron lay shivering on the
Humvee hood.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, at 3 a.m., well over three hours after the initial call
for help, two Chinook helicopters appeared over the mountaintops. The
Special Forces men knew the pilots were risking their lives, but they
wondered why, if the medevac was coming anyway, it had waited so
long.</TE>
<TE>   (Later, a military spokesman said it takes considerable time to
safely organize an evacuation from such a remote area at such high
elevations).</TE>
<TE>   As one Chinook hovered behind a ridgeline, poised to open fire on
attackers, the other landed with a jolt in the rocky clearing. Five
minutes later, it lifted off, with Cameron, Frank and Dan K. aboard.
The team was down to seven.</TE>
<TE>   At dawn, with snow falling, two soldiers climbed onto the belly of
the overturned Humvee and attached cables. A long-haul truck chugged
up the track, and the driver agreed to try to haul the Humvee up onto
the road.</TE>
<TE>   The big truck revved its engines, spewing black smoke and tugging
at the cable. A Humvee on the roadway pulled a second cable tight to
provide support. From the crevice, the stricken Humvee was dragged
backward up the incline and popped with a thud, right side up, on the
road.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone cheered -- even shepherds who had gathered to watch the
rescue.</TE>
<TE>   The Humvee was clogged with mud and ice, but its engine ran
perfectly. Even the .50-caliber machine gun was still working.</TE>
<TE>   Mike pointed out that the Humvee was Frank's second kill,
including the dog.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," John said. "But neither one was a confirmed kill."</TE>
<TE>   The convoy continued down the mountain toward Chaghcharan. On the
door of the battered Humvee, somebody had drawn an arrow pointing
skyward and a message: "This Side Up."</TE>
<TE>   Meeting With Arafi</TE>
<TE>   The day after the uneventful mission into the Badgah Valley, Dan
and Mike strode past a group of thugs milling outside Arafi's
compound in Chaghcharan and sat cross-legged on the dirt floor
inside, staring coldly at the spindly little intelligence chief.
Through Shafiq, their interpreter, they told him they had seen no
evidence of his thousand enemy fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Arafi was sweating. His hands were trembling. He explained that
the Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters were in hiding.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, the Americans said, the chief should personally lead
them to the enemy.</TE>
<TE>   Arafi shook his head vigorously.</TE>
<TE>   "We were willing to risk our lives, believing there were a
thousand armed men waiting to kill us," Mike said. "And you're not
willing to take us there?"</TE>
<TE>   "No."</TE>
<TE>   Dan turned to Mike and said, "We're wasting our time with this
guy."</TE>
<TE>   As they walked outside to their vehicles, past the assembled
ruffians glaring at them, Shafiq noticed that something had been
written on the dust-coated windows of one of the American vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   He looked closer and read: "Death to America." "God is Great."
"You are Infidels."</TE>
<TE>   Back at the safe house, the entire team, plus the muj, carefully
inspected the scrawled messages.</TE>
<TE>   Ed was furious. He sent Mike and Dan up the hill to discuss the
situation with Gen. Ahmad, the moon-faced militia commander who was
nominally Arafi's boss. Mike showed the general the writing on the
car.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to beat the guy's ass who did this," Mike said. "Will you
help me?"</TE>
<TE>   Ahmad made an elaborate show of rolling up his sleeves, then
grinned.</TE>
<TE>   After more joking, Mike posed a serious question: "Are we safe
here?"</TE>
<TE>   The general looked him in the eye.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as I'm here, nobody will touch you," he said. "If they
try, they will die -- or I will die defending you."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Mike and Dan coaxed from the general the real reason
the intelligence chief had been so eager for them to bomb the valley.
Members of his clan had been killed in a vendetta involving a rival
clan there. He wanted revenge.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans drove back to Arafi's compound. Ed confronted the
little man. He forced him to read the messages aloud, then asked who
had written them.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone else," Arafi said. His henchmen had disappeared from the
compound, and he was nearly alone. Across the street, the governor
and his bodyguards watched from their rooftop redoubt.</TE>
<TE>   "It happened in your compound," Ed said. "Don't you control who
comes in and out of your compound?"</TE>
<TE>   Arafi hesitated, then said that some people in town felt
threatened by the Americans and their weapons. They wanted to create
a rift between him and the Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Dan cut in: "We consider this a direct threat. If we are attacked
in any way, we will defend ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Arafi promised to find out who had written the messages. Ed
assured him that the U.S. military still wanted good relations with
everyone. The chief bowed and said, "I am embarrassed in front of my
people."</TE>
<TE>   Ed got back into the Humvee.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we got our point across," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That night, Ed ordered one of the Humvees parked in front of the
safe house, its .50-caliber gun aimed directly at Arafi's compound.</TE>
<TE>   'It's Like Police Work'</TE>
<TE>   After more than a week in Chaghcharan, the team learned that the
town had been scrubbed clean of weaponry in anticipation of their
arrival. Their movements had been relayed by radio from the militia
posts they had passed. Normally, residents said, militiamen dominated
the town, demanding protection money from merchants and extorting
"taxes" from passing trucks and taxis.</TE>
<TE>   Nor was the governor, a sad-eyed warlord named Mohammed Ibrahim,
as powerful as he had indicated in his meetings with Dave, the
captain. Ibrahim had claimed to control 2,500 militiamen. And he'd
said that although he had the support of the government in Kabul, his
fighters and civil service workers were not paid regularly.</TE>
<TE>   But in subsequent conversations with Gen. Ahmad, the Americans
learned that he, not the governor, was the real power in the
province. The general commanded several hundred militiamen, having
disarmed, by his account, Ibrahim's 300 fighters.</TE>
<TE>   And Ahmad's men didn't have to worry about getting paid by the
Kabul government. They were paid regularly, he said, by Ismail Khan.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans were careful not to be drawn into the power
struggle.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to sift through what people tell you, weigh it, evaluate
it, check it out," Ed said. "It's like police work."</TE>
<TE>   In that regard, the team's most important weapon was Shafiq, an
innately curious man. His casual manner put villagers at ease. Like
most Afghans in the region, he is an ethnic Tajik. And with his
distinctive Kabul accent, he was warmly welcomed by displaced
Kabulis.</TE>
<TE>   Even with his desert combat fatigues and M-4 rifle, Shafiq was a
reluctant warrior. Two weeks into the mission, he woke up in the dark
one morning, filthy and freezing, and asked plaintively: "Why would a
banker agree to become a Special Forces soldier?"</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers had their own irritations. When they bought supplies
in the bazaar, they were followed by men and boys who pushed and
shoved to get a look at the strange Americans. When they stripped and
bathed with buckets behind their safe house, a crowd gathered at the
hilltop garrison to watch.</TE>
<TE>   In the bazaar one day, the men encountered Baitulla, the Afghan
whose head had been stitched on the mission's second day. He said he
and his family had been banished from their village because his wife
had brought in Americans without consulting village elders.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans were not entirely welcome in Chaghcharan, either.
Shafiq's network of Kabuli sources told him that local militiamen
were desperate for the soldiers to leave so they could resume their
extortions and shakedowns. The Americans were starting to get hostile
looks. Ed ordered the Humvees started several times a night, so that
they would be warm and ready if the team suddenly had to fight its
way out.</TE>
<TE>   Frustration Mounts</TE>
<TE>   By now, the men had essentially completed the mission. But they
were stranded because a Humvee had been disabled by a faulty
power-steering pump. They were frustrated by the delay, but more by
their futile attempts to flush out and attack Taliban or Al Qaeda
fighters.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the invisible enemy," Mike said. "It's the germ in the body.
The body is sick, but how do you isolate the germ and kill it? It's
frustrating."</TE>
<TE>   Rich, 34, the team's weapons sergeant, considered Al Qaeda and the
Sept. 11 attacks a direct threat to his wife and children back in
Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why we're here -- to get the people who did it. But we
can't find them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The men were heartened by the news that Cameron had suffered only
bruised ribs and a bruised spleen. Frank was fine; the soldiers'
heavy combat vests had helped save them. Frank and Dan K. would
rejoin the team via a resupply flight that would attempt to land at
the Chaghcharan airstrip.</TE>
<TE>   Late one night, a C-130 cargo plane arrived overhead, its engine
roaring in the black sky. The Special Forces men had set up infrared
strobes and beacons to mark the airstrip for the pilot, who wore
night-vision goggles.</TE>
<TE>   After three failed passes, the pilot complained by radio that he
was blinded by the scattered lights in town. On the fourth pass, he
landed safely, but he was unhappy about how the strobes and beacons
had been set.</TE>
<TE>   The Special Forces team pulled its vehicles to the end of the
strip, behind the plane. The men expected the C-130 to pull forward
slowly as the crew rolled the supplies off a pallet, then take off
farther down the runway.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the crew abruptly tossed the boxes to the ground and the
pilot gunned the engines and sped off. The blast from the propellers
sent the men flying and blew out the windows on their two Blazers.</TE>
<TE>   When the plane had gone, the men got up, brushed off the glass and
dirt, laughed about it, then loaded up their gear and drove to the
safe house with Frank and Dan K. aboard.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, the men unpacked mail from home and fresh
supplies of three staples -- high-calorie field food called Long
Range Patrol, Gatorade and Slim Jim processed meat. Missing was the
power-steering pump for the disabled Humvee.</TE>
<TE>   Over the radio, they were told that their request for the pump had
been denied because the Humvee could be driven without it. The men
were incredulous. Trying to drive icy mountain switchbacks at high
altitudes without power steering or power brakes would be suicidal.</TE>
<TE>   Again, they were running up against ground truth.</TE>
<TE>   "They have no idea what the conditions are really like," Dan said.
He paused and added: "Hell, we didn't know how difficult the
conditions were till we got out here."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Dave, the captain, decided to repair the Humvee himself.
Using parachute cord, he managed to connect engine fans to cool the
engine and pump power-steering fluid.</TE>
<TE>   On the mission's 15th day, the team finally left Chaghcharan. The
first night, someone fired two shots at the convoy from a ridgeline.
In the turrets, Rich, the weapons sergeant, and Len, a communications
sergeant, swung their big guns, ready to fire. But there was nothing
but darkness.</TE>
<TE>   That night, they were forced to camp on an icy escarpment at 9,025
feet. They awoke to discover that a blizzard was approaching. They
had to get off the mountain.</TE>
<TE>   Halfway down, a radio call from headquarters ordered the men to
halt so that they could receive a coded message. Frank hauled out his
communications gear, set it up on the roadside and waited.</TE>
<TE>   The team, from the captain down, resented the delay. They were
squeezed between two high ridges, ripe for an ambush. When the
message finally arrived an hour later, the men cursed. It was
routine: an update on a B-52 bombing run south of Herat the day
before, some prosaic daily business -- and a warning that a snowstorm
was expected at their position.</TE>
<TE>   The convoy roared to life. They drove all that day and far into
the night. Some of the Blazer windows were covered with taped plastic
that was now flapping in the wind. The ailing Humvee groaned and
shuddered, but the captain's parachute cord held.</TE>
<TE>   In the open turrets, Len and Rich turned a sickly greenish-gray in
the biting winds and swirling dust. Inside his gloves, Rich's hands
were raw and cracked, with bloody fissures along the nails.</TE>
<TE>   In the dark, the men finally saw the twinkling lights of Herat. At
last, they pulled up to their safe house, dirty, exhausted, coughing
up dust. Each man collapsed into a deep, restless sleep interrupted
by calls to guard duty.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, they showered and unpacked their rucksacks. The
captain felt a sense of satisfaction; they had collected fresh
intelligence on a huge swath of what was previously unknown terrain.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. commanders now knew where militiamen were, their weapons and
whether they had radios. They knew the names of village headmen and
local commanders. They knew who backed the central government and who
was wavering. They knew who was paying whom.</TE>
<TE>   Clean and warm inside the safe house, the men relaxed on a sofa,
watching a World War II movie. They felt somehow unfulfilled; they
had trained for war but had found no one to fight. They were like
blind men struggling to touch obstacles in their path.</TE>
<TE>   "You know how you look at something and it's blurry, and you have
to turn it around and look at it from different angles to make it
come into focus?" Frank asked. "That's what it's like. Things are
still coming into focus."</TE>
<TE>   They longed for feedback, which they defined in soldiers' terms.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what feedback is?" Dan asked. "Feedback is having the
bad guy pop up, and then you kill him. That's feedback -- and we
don't have it."</TE>
<TE>   The Special Forces men fell silent, lost in their thoughts. Soon
they would be sent on another mission to another town in the frozen
wilderness. In the bitter darkness outside, someone had scrawled a
message on the repaired Humvee: "What's Next?"</TE>
