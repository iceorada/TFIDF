District.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forty years ago, Los Angeles city fathers realized that the proper
way to deal with increased air travel would be to develop a system of
regional airports instead of relying on one central location. This
led the city to the purchase of land in Palmdale and Ontario on which
to build airports that would help ease the overcrowding at Los
Angeles International Airport, which they knew was bound to occur
some- day.</LD>
<LD>   That day has arrived.</LD>
<LD>   But while the airport in Ontario is already open to commercial air
traffic (although it is underutilized), Palmdale Regional Airport
remains open only to private air traffic. Expanding Palmdale offers
the best alternative to adding more capacity to the already
dangerously overextended ground and air facilities at LAX--the only
major airport serving the 10 million residents of county's 88 cities
and unincorporated areas.</LD>
<TE>   Expanding LAX to accommodate millions more passengers would
multiply the already out-of-control amount of air and street traffic
at LAX. Increased air traffic would mean additional safety
concerns--currently, LAX ranks first in the nation in the amount of
near-collisions.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, LAX will have to grow, but with proper utilization of
the county's two major regional airports, the growth will be smarter,
better managed and have less impact.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the need to expand at Palmdale, however, former Mayor
Richard Riordan's administration focused its resources on expanding
LAX. It ignored the option of expanding the Palmdale airport,
claiming that the Antelope Valley, where Palmdale is located, would
not be able to support such an expansion.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors initiated a market
study on the viability of expanding the Palmdale airport. The study,
conducted a year ago by Tri-Star Marketing Co., found that opening
the airport to commercial air traffic would not only be viable but,
when fully operational, could help the Antelope Valley economy to
grow by nearly $65 million in annual revenue and provide an annual
payroll of $6.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   The recent election of James K. Hahn as mayor of Los Angeles and
the appointment to the LAX commission of Ted Stein, who supports the
expansion of regional airport facilities, mean that the idea of using
other airports to handle some of the region's air traffic is once
again being given serious consideration.</TE>
<TE>   In August, Hahn told the LAX commission that he was committed to
finding a regional approach to the area's need for expanded airports.</TE>
<TE>   Detractors would have us believe that LAX can accommodate the 38
million new passengers projected by 2020. Yet they fail to explain
how this will be accomplished at an facility that is landlocked
within only 3,500 acres, making it the nation's smallest major
airport.</TE>
<TE>   Palmdale airport, by contrast, is surrounded by thousands of acres
available for future expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn has called for further study of expansion of LAX and has said
that any new dollars spent on the airport would go first toward
addressing security concerns--not toward increasing its size.</TE>
<TE>   Palmdale and Ontario airports are located in the heart of the
fastest-growing areas in California and are convenient to 6.5 million
people residing in the Antelope, Santa Clarita, San Fernando, San
Gabriel and Pomona valleys as well as residents in Ventura, Kern, San
Bernardino, Orange and Riverside counties. More than 3 million people
live closer to Palmdale than to LAX.</TE>
<TE>   The regional plan would make LAX safer for airline traffic and
would reduce vehicle traffic congestion and air pollution in heart of
L.A. It would also contribute to a more convenient air travel system
for all Los Angeles County residents.</TE>
<TE>   These airports are each a part of an overall regional airport
plan--not a replacement for LAX but a way to relieve pressure on an
overburdened system and provide options to residents in the Los
Angeles area.</TE>
<TE>   After all, the city purchased these airports originally as part of
a strategic plan to address growth. Yet they go woefully
underutilized while local politicians spend precious city tax dollars
trying to sell a failed expansion plan to area voters.</TE>

<HD>Stop Terror at Its Source: Iran</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>YOSSI KLEIN HALEVI</AU>
<BD>Yossi Klein Halevi is the Israel correspondent for the
New Republic and a senior writer for the Jerusalem Report.</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>The Israeli operation that seized a ship filled with more than 50
tons of Iranian arms reportedly bound for Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Authority highlights Iran's central role in international terrorism.
And combined with recent Iranian threats to Israel's existence, the
weapons ship mocks the hope of those American officials who call for
including the fundamentalist Muslim regime in the anti-terrorist
coalition.</LD>
<LD>   The weapons on board the Karine-A vessel--which the Palestinian
Authority denies were headed its way--included Katyusha rockets
intended for use against Israeli towns and more than 11/2 tons of
explosives, which Israeli military intelligence agencies suspect may
have been earmarked for car bombings or suicide attacks. And the
revelation by the captain of the Karine-A of Hezbollah involvement in
transferring the weapons onto the vessel at least suggests that the
Lebanese terrorist group served as an intermediary between the
Palestinians and the Iranians.</LD>
<LD>   The emergence of a Palestinian-Iranian-Hezbollah connection
transforms Palestinian terrorism from a local to a global terrorist
threat. Iran's terrorist mischief becomes even more frightening in
the context of its nuclear program. Though Iran has insisted its
nuclear development is intended for peaceful means, at least one
Iranian leader is actively contemplating nuclear war against Israel.</LD>
<TE>   On Dec. 14, Hashemi Rafsanjani, former Iranian president and
currently chairman of the government's powerful guidance council,
told a Tehran University audience that the vast Muslim world could
easily survive nuclear war, while tiny Israel would be destroyed.
"The founding of the state of Israel is the worst event in all of
history," he said. "If the day comes when the world of Islam is
equipped with weapons similar to those that Israel possesses ...
nothing will remain after one atom bomb is dropped on Israel."</TE>
<TE>   That day could be approaching. According to Israel's defense
minister, Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, Iran is about three years away from
developing a nuclear strike capability. And Israel is already well
within range of Iranian missiles. That threat is hardly confined to
Israel alone: Iran is developing new generations of ballistic
missiles with intercontinental range.</TE>
<TE>   When the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin initiated the
Oslo peace process, one of his main rationales was the need to
neutralize the Palestinian conflict and free Israel for an eventual
confrontation with its existential enemy, Iran.</TE>
<TE>   Sooner or later, Rabin believed, Israel would be forced to destroy
Iran's nuclear capability, just as Israel destroyed Iraq's nuclear
reactor in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   Rafsanjani's speech reveals Rabin's prescience in identifying Iran
as a threat to Israel's survival.</TE>
<TE>   As Washington contemplates its next strike against terrorism, Iran
needs to be moved from the column of potential allies to the column
of potential targets. In fact, an attack on Iran--even before a
strike against Iraq--may be strategically compelling. Attacking Iran
first would preclude the danger of an Iranian seizure of Shiite areas
of southern Iraq. And an attack on Tehran could embolden the
democratic uprising against the mullahs that is stirring just below
the surface of imposed uniformity.</TE>
<TE>   Destroying the Taliban has been a crucial first step in the war
against radical Islam. But the real defeat of Islamic extremists must
happen in Tehran, where the movement won its most compelling victory.</TE>
<TE>   The message of modern holy war first emanated from Iran; indeed,
the war against the U.S. that culminated on Sept. 11 began with the
seizure of the American Embassy in Tehran in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's interception of the weapons ship has sabotaged Iran's
moderate image, carefully cultivated in recent months to avoid
scrutiny of its nuclear program. But now that its continuing
involvement in international terrorism has been exposed, it cannot be
allowed to continue its nuclear development unimpeded.</TE>
<TE>   If President Bush is serious about challenging terror at its root,
he cannot avoid a confrontation with the regime that initiated
anti-American terrorism and that is considering a nuclear nightmare.</TE>

<HD>Let Down His Rich Pals? Over His Dead Body</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SCHEER</AU>
<BD>Robert Scheer writes a syndicated column.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Talk about the politics of class struggle. George W. Bush now is
apparently willing to give his life to make the rich richer. "Over my
dead body" was his response to proposals to scale back the $1.35
trillion in tax cuts planned for the next 10 years.</LD>
<LD>   Notice that he didn't say "over my dead body" will the
homeless--many of them actually employed in low-paying jobs--sleep in
the snows of Minneapolis because the "faith-based" as well as
government shelters are short on funds. Nor is it "over my dead body"
that Enron workers will be left holding the bag emptied by the
president's good friend, Kenneth L. "Kenny Boy" Lay. Nor is it "over
my dead body" that the Boeing company will be given a $22-billion Air
Force contract as it fires thousands of its workers. The president
cannot say that "over my dead body" will he forget his pledge to
assist seniors with prescription medical costs, save Social Security
and revive public education, when in fact his tax cut has made it
impossible to deliver on any such promises.</LD>
<LD>   Nope, his is the manifesto of a true son of the super rich who has
never known a nanosecond of economic insecurity and genuinely
believes that the truly burdened are those with enormous wealth.</LD>
<TE>   The truly needy in the Bush lexicon are the very wealthy folks who
must be given tax breaks so they may more easily invest in the
economy. The rest of us are told it is our patriotic duty to buy
things we cannot afford, but the rich can only be expected to invest
if it does not cost them anything in after-tax dollars.</TE>
<TE>   With blase arrogance, the president now insists that his skewed
tax cut be amplified in the years to come. This is a cheerleader who
doesn't know the game is lost: Unemployment is at a decade high, the
huge Clinton budget surplus is now going into deficit, and eight
years of buoyant prosperity and growth have been turned into a sour
recession.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that none of this gives President Bush pause is the
purest indication that he does not, in the least, grasp the suffering
engendered by his policies.</TE>
<TE>   It does not have to be this way. The rich can indeed "get it," as
Franklin Delano Roosevelt and many other wealthy American leaders
have demonstrated. However, it does take a bit of work to wedge one's
feet into the pinched shoes of the less fortunate--work that the
president (like his father before him) has not been inspired to
perform.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps if the media and the Democrats had challenged Bush's
nostrums more forthrightly he could have moved beyond the ingrained
smugness of a rich brat.</TE>
<TE>   That did not happen, however, and instead the failure of this
administration's economic policies has been ignored, particularly in
the aftermath of Sept. 11. Indeed, that tragedy is turned to the most
shameful of partisan political purpose to explain away a recession
that began in earnest in March, half a year before the terrorist
attack.</TE>
<TE>   It is Bush and not Osama bin Laden who is responsible for
subverting the fiscally conservative policies of the Clinton years. A
true conservative would say that "over my dead body" would the
government siphon the surplus created by Social Security taxes to the
pockets of the rich, putting the nation further into the red.</TE>
<TE>   Bush may be the hero of the moment but it won't be so when future
generations try to collect their Social Security checks. If Bush
keeps it up he will be remembered as another Herbert Hoover, a
president who let the unemployment lines grow while the government
went broke catering to the wealthy.</TE>

<HD>Why Trucks Won't Yield on Drive Time</HD>
<DH>Restricting big rigs' access to freeways isn't economically
feasible. But over the long haul, as traffic grows, changes may
become necessary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In her agonizing daily commute from her Oceanside home to her job at
Cal Poly Pomona, Donna Tillman routinely battles the 800-pound
gorillas of Southern California freeways: big rigs.</LD>
<LD>   "I drive a Toyota, and I feel like a midget among these huge
trucks," the business professor said. "You cannot see around them
when you are moving from one lane to another."</LD>
<LD>   The 18-wheelers are not only big, but they also seem to be
reproducing right on the roadways. On some Los Angeles area freeways,
trucks account for nearly 15% of the traffic. That figure is expected
to grow as international trade continues to bring a surge of cargo
into the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.</LD>
<TE>   With that in mind, Tillman asks the question that most every
frustrated Southern California motorist has pondered at one time or
another: Why can't these trucks haul their loads after peak commute
hours?</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody would move a lot freer if the trucks were restricted to
between 8 p.m. and 5 a.m.," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Tillman is not the first to suggest what seems like a simple idea
for easing congestion in the mecca of freeway traffic jams. But
government and private groups that have promoted the idea say it
would almost be easier to achieve peace in the Middle East than to
keep big rigs off the freeways at peak commute times.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of after-hours truck deliveries worked well in Los
Angeles during the 1984 Summer Olympics, when truckers, warehouse
operators and retailers voluntarily adopted alternative schedules.
But a 1990 plan by then-Mayor Tom Bradley to ban trucks from city
streets during rush hours died after it ran afoul of federal
interstate commerce laws.</TE>
<TE>   Today, concerns over worsening traffic delays are so serious that
researchers at the Texas Transportation Institute are studying the
idea of building an underground freight pipeline system that would
carry cargo on a subterranean conveyor belt between Dallas and
Laredo.</TE>
<TE>   Because of burgeoning traffic problems, many large businesses,
such as Wal-Mart and Sears, already have most of their goods
delivered in the evening or early morning hours.</TE>
<TE>   But at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach--the nation's
busiest port complex--most business is done between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m.
Truckers begin to line up at dawn, waiting for the terminal gates to
open at 8 a.m. to pick up their cargo. About 5 p.m., the last
deliveries are loaded onto outbound trucks.</TE>
<TE>   Such a schedule puts about 34,000 big rigs on Southern
California's overburdened freeways smack in the middle of peak
commute hours. The number of trucks rolling in and out of the ports
is expected to jump to nearly 92,000 by 2020.</TE>
<TE>   To shift those deliveries to off-peak hours would require new work
schedules for terminal operators, truck drivers and warehouse
workers--changes that in most cases would mean overtime wages. None
of the businesses involved with the delivery of port cargo are eager
to pay such higher wages.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a matter of economics at this point," said Joan Wood, a
project manager at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.</TE>
<TE>   The unions that represent terminal workers and truckers say they
would be happy to work the later shifts--at a higher hourly wage. The
problem, they say, is that there is no demand for after-hour
deliveries, because most inland warehouses that accept the cargo
close between 5 and 6 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't make sense to have a driver pick up a shipment [after
hours] and then park," said Warren Hoemann, vice president of the
California Truckers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Off-Hours Deliveries Could Prove Costly</TE>
<TE>   Warehouse owners say they sympathize with the plight of
traffic-weary motorists, but they insist that they cannot afford to
pay workers to accept late-night or early-morning deliveries.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not possible to open at that time, because of the expense,"
said Ted Shayan, president of Concord Enterprises, a general
merchandise warehouse in Vernon. He said it would cost him an
additional $10,000 a day to accept late-night deliveries.</TE>
<TE>   He added that truckers cannot simply park their trailers on the
streets until the warehouses open in the morning, because the cargo
would be easy pickings for thieves.</TE>
<TE>   Other efforts are underway, however, to ease the increasing truck
traffic from the ports.</TE>
<TE>   The $2.4-billion Alameda Corridor, a high-speed railway from the
ports to downtown Los Angeles, is scheduled to open later this year.
Last year, the California Department of Transportation launched a
$400-million overhaul of the Long Beach Freeway, one of the most
heavily used truck routes in the region. The Southern California
Assn. of Governments is promoting the construction of several
truck-only lanes along some of the busiest freeways.</TE>
<TE>   But with predictions that truck traffic will nearly triple by
2020, several groups, including the MTA and the governments
association, say much more must be done to avert expanding gridlock.</TE>
<TE>   In its 2000 annual report to the state Legislature, the California
Transportation Commission called on truckers, shippers, and warehouse
and terminal operators to expand their hours of operation.</TE>
<TE>   "A key factor in mitigating this congestion is spreading the
demand for port access over a greater portion of the 24-hour day,"
the report states.</TE>
<TE>   Shipping Coalition Tackles Efficiency</TE>
<TE>   A group of shippers, manufacturers and other business groups
formed a coalition in 2000 to make cargo deliveries in California
more reliable and efficient. The group, the West Coast Waterfront
Coalition, includes such big-name manufacturers as Hewlett-Packard,
Nike and the Gap.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, coalition representatives promoted before a
congressional subcommittee the idea of extending truck delivery
hours.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Atkinson, the coalition's legislative representative, said
the idea would be difficult to implement because it would require a
"cultural change along the entire supply chain."</TE>
<TE>   But if businesses do not voluntarily adopt new schedules, he said,
increasing freeway delays could force state and federal lawmakers to
legislate such changes.</TE>
<TE>   It may take a while, but Philip Wright, vice president of Zim
Container Service, a terminal operator at the Port of Long Beach,
said change is inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   "We are a stubborn group of individuals," he said. But he added:
"In the long term, it's not an 'if' but a 'when' we change the way we
operate."</TE>

Danielle Steel (with a score of 10) made Amy Tan (5) look like a puny
footnote, but then got comeuppance from an ex-husband who bagged an
11. A wealthy environmentalist snagged three times as much limelight
as Sharon Stone.</LD>
<LD>   There are probably more constructive ways to start a new year than
to count boldfaced names in the society columns. But for the last
week this biggest of small towns has been doing it anyway. In what
has become a minor sport for Bay Area people-watchers, the Nob Hill
Gazette, the area's social calendar of record, published its annual
ranking of who was mentioned how many times last year in the pages of
the January 2002 edition.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 1,000 people, from George Lucas, the well-known Bay Area
filmmaker, to George Lucas, an opera-supporting retired tailor with
the same name, had made it into the publication at least twice.</LD>
<TE>   The Gazette's Tote Board has run for 11 Januaries, launched as a
lighthearted sendup by the monthly's owner. In recent years, however,
it has approached cult status as economic forces and journalistic
fashion have shrunk society coverage in the city's daily newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   Local pundits joke about it, socialites vie to get onto it and
philanthropists discreetly scan it for their own names and standings.</TE>
<TE>   "Hail, Anti-Social Losers!" the left-leaning SF Weekly joked last
year in an item announcing that "supersocialite" Ann Moller Caen had
"easily carried away the coveted crown" with 16 Nob Hill Gazette
mentions in 2000. The list for 2001 tallied 17 mentions for
Caen--high, but not high enough to beat Heide Betz, an unmarried and
socially active art dealer, who pushed her score to 19 when the
Gazette reported her appearance at a reception at Caen's "lovely
Pacific Heights home" with an appeals court justice.</TE>
<TE>   This time, the widow Caen shared third place with the city's chief
of protocol Charlotte Mailliard Shultz, wife of former U.S. Secretary
of State George Shultz, who said she had been hearing about her
notoriety all week.</TE>
<TE>   Runners-up Patricia Sprincin and Richard N. Goldman tied with 18
mentions. (Sprincin, for non-San Franciscans, is past president of
the city's Opera Guild and president-elect of the Symphony League,
and Goldman, a retired insurance executive and Republican
fund-raiser, is a backer of environmentalist causes and the widower
of a Levi Strauss heir. He said he learned of his accomplishment when
he called the Gazette's editor Sunday to invite her to a reception
for former L.A. Mayor Richard Riordan, whom he is backing in the
gubernatorial race.)</TE>
<TE>   The Gazette's owner and publisher, Lois Lehrman, says the Tote
Board originated as "a tongue-in-cheek competition" and a joke on the
Gazette's own reputation as a repository for Bay Area-status anxiety.
If the 23-year-old tabloid is frankly elitist, it also has a campy,
only-in-San Francisco feel to it. It features page upon page of
benefits, receptions and private parties, and its debutante-riddled
wedding section is titled "Mergers &amp; Acquisitions."</TE>
<TE>   But it is also one of the few publications in which pictures of
partying Gettys collide with candids from the annual ball for pet
lovers and their four-legged escorts.</TE>
<TE>   The April issue carried an account of a local party at which the
butler passed around an after-dinner tray of marijuana and a blurb on
the baby shower for Brown's love child, complete with a photo of
mother Carolyn Carpeneti and "Da Daddy," as "Da Mayor" was
re-nicknamed.</TE>
<TE>   The December issue opened with a shot of Grateful Dead bassist
Phil Lesh at a benefit for arts education, and closed with a
masquerade party for the city's new American Trial Lawyers' Assn.
president.</TE>
<TE>   For most of its history, the Gazette was a secondary player on the
social scene in San Francisco. Then-Chronicle columnist Herb Caen,
the city's most famous name-dropper, died in 1997, followed by the
death of the newspaper's prolific society editor Pat Steger in 1999.
The following year, the Chronicle was sold to the Hearst Corp.,
which, in turn, sold the rival Examiner to the Fang family.</TE>
<TE>   The changes in ownership, combined with the worsening Bay Area
economy, prompted a rethinking of the newspapers' styles and
editorial priorities. Society news--like local news in general--is
labor- and space-intensive and has become less popular in an era of
round-the-clock global celebrity gossip.</TE>
<TE>   But San Francisco is an intensely social and self-interested city,
and Merla Zellerbach, the Gazette's editor, said the sudden falloff
in mainstream coverage prompted almost immediate increases in
advertising at the publication, which has a controlled--or
targeted--circulation of about 75,000. Few would accuse the Gazette
of hard-hitting journalism, and it still employs columnist George
Christy, who resigned from the Hollywood Reporter last year amid
allegations that he had received sham movie credits from producers he
covered, thus enabling him to qualify for Screen Actors Guild
benefits. ("He's a good writer, and we haven't had any problem with
him, and he brings a quality of glamour and glitter," said
Zellerbach. "Also,he's the only one who really has access to Danielle
Steel.")</TE>
<TE>   "The Nob Hill Gazette has filled a void," said John Traina, a
Pacific Heights shipping executive, Faberge collector and Steel's
ex-husband. "San Francisco has always been a city of characters, and
people here have gotten used to finding out who those characters
are."</TE>
<TE>   The Tote Board is a partial--and, for some, coveted--roster of
those characters. Its method is rudimentary: A point is awarded for
each time a person is named as a first reference in an article or
item and for each time that person is pictured in a photograph. Staff
members compile an issue-by-issue count as the year progresses and
arrive at a grand total at the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, Zellerbach said, the count was decidedly
uncontroversial, but in the last few years, some scores have been
disputed. Two years ago, she said, a local woman privately complained
that someone at the publication must have it in for her because her
own count was significantly higher than the one in the year-end
tally.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a man corraled Zellerbach at a cocktail party with the
charge that he had been unfairly cropped from a party photo, thus
diminishing his Tote Board status. On Monday,  the editor said, "We
got a call from a lady who was very upset because all her friends
were on it and she wasn't." Lehrman said she plans to run a "whoops
column" in February to mollify the caller, an industrialist's wife,
and any other victims of an undercount.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the craziest thing, but it really seems to mean something to
people," Zellerbach laughed, adding that neither complainant was so
disgruntled that they objected to seeing their names in print
thereafter. "I suppose it's the old identity thing--it validates
people if they see their names in print, and the more times they see
it, the merrier."</TE>
<TE>   Local philanthropists note that the mentions are more than mere
ego boosters. Though the Gazette runs articles on wine, real estate,
books and fashion, its main bond with its audience is the coverage of
charitable events. Like most society pages, it is relentlessly
flattering and upbeat, and is one of the few outlets for advance
publicity on fund-raisers.</TE>
<TE>   "They're wonderful at helping promote philanthropy in this city,"
said opera and symphony backer Sprincin, who said she hadn't realized
she'd been mentioned an average of 1.5 times per issue last year.
"They'll almost always step forward when you're having trouble
selling out [at an event]."</TE>
<TE>   That said, it can be hard to resist a peek at any ranking,
especially one that might involve famous--or familiar--names. Who can
ignore news, for example, of Stone's 5-3 edge on her husband,
Chronicle Executive Editor Phil Bronstein, even after he was bitten
by a Komodo dragon? Or the fact that Mayor Brown was mentioned only
half as often as Frank Jordan--the ex-mayor who made headlines after
a campaign stunt in which he posed nude in the shower with two radio
deejays? Or the possibility that someone you know might be listed? "I
can't imagine anyone takes it seriously, of course, but my kids
pointed it out to me--'Oh, mom, look--you're mentioned more often
than dad!' Although 15 times? That means I was in there more than
once a month, which I can't imagine," laughed Dagmar Dolby (16), wife
of the founder and chairman of Dolby Laboratories, Ray Dolby (12).</TE>
<TE>   "But whatever. I came back from Tahoe last night, and there it
was. And I confess, I took it to bed and read the whole thing."</TE>

<HD>A Paris Original</HD>
<DH>From his stunning debut as the successor to Christian Dior
through the tumultuous decades to follow, fashion giant Yves Saint
Laurent captured the essence of it all in his own distinctive style.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARYLOU LUTHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paris designer Yves Saint Laurent began his career as the daring
young man on the flying trapeze.</LD>
<LD>   He was 21. It was his first collection following the death of his
predecessor, the legendary Christian Dior. And he had chosen what he
called the trapeze silhouette to begin his own ascent to the
sometimes dizzying heights of Paris haute couture.</LD>
<LD>   As a fashion reporter for the Chicago Tribune at the time, I found
it relatively easy to describe the clothes, which evolved from Dior's
own A-line. But what astounded me were the truly extraordinary events
that followed the Paris show.</LD>
<TE>   First, I ran to have a quick lunch at a nearby cafe, and an
English journalist asked if she might join me. We talked about the
show, and I mentioned that I had decided to end my story with "The
king is dead. Long live the king." She told me I could not. She said
that was a British expression, reserved for the monarchy. I didn't
tell her, but I went ahead and used it anyway, as it seemed a fitting
last sentence. And history has proved that it was, as Saint Laurent
has reigned as the king of fashion for most of his illustrious
career.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of that cold, cloudy January day in 1958, the young man
born in Algeria was on the balcony of Dior headquarters at 30 Avenue
Montaigne, waving and blowing kisses (the first air kisses?) to a
crowd of well-wishers that had gathered below in a kind of French
fashion frenzy I had never seen before and I have never seen since.
The ovation lasted for hours.</TE>
<TE>   I cannot imagine anything like this happening on Seventh Avenue.
From that day, he was revered by the French press. I've never seen a
designer treated with such respect.</TE>
<TE>   After serving in the French army, Saint Laurent opened his own
house in 1962. In the 40 years since, he has risen to become a
fashion icon, one of the most important designers of the 20th
century, the first living designer ever to have a retrospective at
the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1983. Two years later, he was
awarded the Legion d'Honneur by then French President Francois
Mitterrand. In 1998, a retrospective of his work was featured before
the World Cup soccer final at the Stade de France.</TE>
<TE>   Like any great designer, Yves Saint Laurent's most memorable
contribution has nothing to do with hemlines or shoulder pads, but to
his acuity as a social commentator. His blazered pantsuits of the
mid-'60s and his tuxedo for women in 1966 were the first fashion
expressions of women's liberation. His see-through dresses of 1968
and his posing nude for his fragrance ads were equally prescient as
harbingers of the sexual revolution.</TE>
<TE>   The first haute couture collection I covered at Saint Laurent's
own house was for the Los Angeles Times more than 30 years ago. It
was dubbed the "happy hooker" collection, a kind of haute salute to
the prostitutes of the Rue Saint Denis. One jazzy satin dress was
embroidered on the back with the words "Love Me Forever or Never." I
will never forget it, especially the fact that this amazing Frenchman
would do his fashion-writing in English.</TE>
<TE>   Even back then, when his clothes were stirring almost as much
controversy as his behavior, Saint Laurent was not one to give press
conferences or in-depth interviews, preferring, it would seem, to let
his clothes do the talking. The one journalist he talked most to was
John Fairchild, then the publisher of Women's Wear Daily, and later W
magazine. Fairchild treated Saint Laurent like a god, and managed to
get this memorable quote from him in 1986: "I don't want to compare
myself to God. I'm already a Saint."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who has attended Saint Laurent shows over the years has
seen his suffering, widely attributed to drugs and alcohol. Once his
longtime partner Pierre Berge pushed him on stage, clutching a hot
water bottle. Another time he was too ill to attend his own
collection. As the years progressed, Saint Laurent has become more
and more of a recluse, his partying days now but a distant memory.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, during summer haute couture season, the late Nina
Hyde of the Washington Post and I were walking from the Hotel
Intercontinental, where he has held most of his haute couture shows,
when sharp-eyed Nina cried, "Look, there he is in his limo!" With
that, she knocked on the car window, which he rolled down with a look
of complete terror, and said that the two of us just wanted to
congratulate him on his collection. He said nothing, but smiled
faintly. Before we could get in another word, the driver, who we
decided was more a bodyguard than a limo driver, drove off, leaving
us quote-less.</TE>
<TE>   When Alber Elbaz, a longtime assistant to Geoffrey Beene, was
being interviewed to replace Saint Laurent as the ready-to-wear
designer, I remember asking him if Saint Laurent would have any
say-so in his hiring or if it would all be up to Berge. Elbaz,
astounded by my question, said, "But of course Monsieur Saint Laurent
will make the final decision." And he did.</TE>
<TE>   Just as he has made the decision to retire.</TE>
<TE>   In my view, he has left the design of Yves Saint Laurent Rive
Gauche (his ready-to-wear line) to a worthy successor, acknowledging
the talent of American-born Tom Ford of Gucci. Just as Saint Laurent
began by emulating his predecessor, Christian Dior, Ford has drawn on
such Saint Laurent classics as the safari look, the Russian peasant
and the tuxedo--all with a distinctly Ford interpretation of what
looks right for now. Just as Saint Laurent was a fashion oracle of
the '60s and '70s, Ford is a fashion oracle of today. If you're
wearing a peasant blouse right now or a safari suit, you can thank
them both.</TE>

<DH>For women who don't want to count on Prince Charming or who
just like nice jewelry, the Ah ring is just the thing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCARLET CHENG</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three generations of Kirschenbaum women are sitting around the dining
table in Lily's orderly Woodland Hills home--Lily, 70, is the
grandmother, and by her sit daughter Lisa, 35, and granddaughter
(Lisa's niece) Jennifer Bailey, 17. All are proudly showing off the
same petite band of white gold, worn on the pinkie and inset with 11
sparkling, round full-cut diamonds. And while diamonds may or may not
be a girl's best friend, they can certainly give a welcome lift to
one's mood.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier last year Lily bought the ring for Lisa, then liked it so
much she bought one for herself. Soon her granddaughter was smitten,
too, and began asking for one. Lily gave Jennifer hers for Hanukkah.</LD>
<LD>   It's the Ah ring--which, according to the small booklet that came
with the mail-order bauble, stands for either "available and happy"
or "attached and happy," take your pick.</LD>
<TE>   Lisa spotted it first--in the March issue of Oprah Winfrey's "O"
magazine. A stack of them were prominently depicted on a full-page
spread, the opener for the section of Oprah's personal must-haves.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw it and loved it," Lisa recalls, "and I showed it to my Mom
and said I'd really love that for my birthday."</TE>
<TE>   Lisa says she liked the idea of a woman not waiting for a man to
buy her a diamond. "It was appealing that you could buy your own,"
she says, "even though [my mother] bought it for me!"</TE>
<TE>   The Ah ring is the brainchild of Ruta Fox, 39, who grew up in
Sherman Oaks and edited Exposure, an L.A.-based pop-culture magazine,
before she moved East in the mid-'90s. Two years ago, the New
York-based fashion and beauty writer treated herself to a diamond
pinkie ring.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd gotten this cute little pinkie ring and loved the way it
looked," she says by phone from Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   When her friends oohed and aahed over it, she helped them buy one
too. Pretty soon, it became a bonding agent, as well as a declaration
of their shared state of unmarried bliss. "It all started on that
girlfriend level," she explains. "We're all single, we're all
available, and we're all happy."</TE>
<TE>   Voila, the Ah ring!</TE>
<TE>   So many others were intrigued by the ring that at the end of 2000,
Fox decided to make and market her own. At first she imported a
slightly modified version of the ring, but, since last June, she has
had them manufactured in New York to her specifications. She
personally helps select the stones for the rings, which sell for $295
plus shipping costs.</TE>
<TE>   She relies a lot on word-of-mouth and an occasional media mention.
Her first break was being placed in the March issue of "O" magazine.
The orders poured in--by phone ([800] 310-9694) and online
(www.ahring.com)--and she has already sold 3,500 of the rings.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to suggest that instead of waiting for Mr. Right to give
you a ring," says Fox, "it would be phenomenal if you could get it
for yourself. It totally struck a nerve-- some people tell me, 'This
is the first nice ring I've bought for myself.'"</TE>
<TE>   And, yes, Fox continues to wear her ring--and to describe herself
as happy and single.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Woodland Hills, the ring is a hit in the Kirschenbaum
family.</TE>
<TE>   Lily extends her right hand and turns the ring to catch the light.
"It makes me happy to have this little ring on my finger. Some people
notice it, some people don't."</TE>
<TE>   Lisa admits it's "kind of neat to see your ring on Oprah."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just a copycat, I want everything they have," says Jennifer,
indicating her aunt and grandmother. "And I love jewelry, I'm
obsessed with it," says the UCSB sophomore, who wears two diamond
studs in each ear.</TE>
<TE>   The "available" part of the story behind the ring doesn't really
appeal to the women. Lily is married. Jennifer has a steady boyfriend
who buys her lots of jewelry. And, says Lisa, "I don't want to say,
'Hi, I'm single, look at my ring!'"</TE>
<TE>   Lisa does like the fact that she and a handful of old friends are
getting the ring, one by one. "These are the friends I've had since
junior high. Slowly but surely they're all getting the ring, so it's
a bonding thing as well."</TE>
<TE>   After a while she lets on another reason why the ring, which she
never takes off, feels right for her. "I was engaged, so I had a
diamond ring," says Lisa with a hint of wistfulness. "It was
heartbreaking when the engagement broke up. That was a sadness for me
to look at my hand and not see the ring that I loved for a year, so
this brings me a newer phase of my life."</TE>
<TE>   "My mom wants one now," says Jennifer. "She feels left out." She
turns to her grandmother. "She says she's going to get it for her
birthday in May. Will she?"</TE>
<TE>   Knowing that this may go into print, Lily is coy. "I think I may
get it for her, but don't tell her."</TE>

<LD>The legal battles are far from over for Bold magazine Publisher
Michael Davis, the man who earned notoriety last year after Tom
Cruise filed a $100-million defamation suit against him.</LD>
<LD>   Shortly after Cruise filed his suit, Davis fired the editorial
staff of his publication with promises to relaunch in the fall. Some
writers were told they weren't young or hip enough for his magazine.
Others were told the magazine was acquired by new investors.</LD>
<LD>   In recent weeks, Davis has been sued for sexual harassment by his
former female associate publisher, sued by a former writer for unpaid
writing fees and duped by another employee who billed the company for
false expenses. Now the magazine is indefinitely on hold.</LD>
<TE>   Davis could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, Davis claimed to have a videotape of Cruise having
sex with another man and sent out news releases alleging that the
actor had engaged in a homosexual relationship during his marriage to
Nicole Kidman, according to Cruise's lawsuit. No such article ever
appeared in Davis' magazine. Cruise dropped the suit in December
after the publisher admitted that he didn't have a tape. (Davis told
us last summer he had been duped by a source.) Now, Davis is barred
by the terms of the settlement from questioning Cruise's sexuality.</TE>
<TE>   But the hype hasn't stopped. Davis' publicist, Julie Smith,
claimed in a mass e-mail that "damaging tapes" will clear Davis of
the sexual harassment charges. And, in an e-mail to us, she wrote:
"No one has ever gotten his side of the Tom Cruise matter either.
Hint--Big Story."</TE>
<TE>   We'll believe it when we see it.</TE>

<TE>   Help From Writers</TE>
<TE>   If the government wants help in the war on terrorism, author and
entertainment lawyer Brian Lysaght has one piece of advice: Forget
about Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody in Hollywood thinks outside the box," Lysaght said over
lunch at Ca' Brea on La Brea Avenue. "If they did, they wouldn't be
in Hollywood. They'd be in independent film."</TE>
<TE>   Rather, the government should pick the brains of writers such as
Tom Clancy, and himself, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The plot of Lysaght's most recent novel, "Last Dance of the Viper"
(Forge Books, 2001), involves a terrorist conspiracy to distribute
the nerve agent Sarin. To write it, Lysaght read up on chemical and
biological warfare and became, in courtroom parlance, "intimate with
the facts."</TE>
<TE>   "Thriller writers are canaries in the mine" when it comes to
imagining terrorism scenarios, he said.</TE>
<TE>   A former federal prosecutor whose Santa Monica law firm handles
high-profile litigation, Lysaght often uses real-life cases as
inspiration for his books. "I see some of the greatest scams, some
wonderful scams," he said with a grin. "It's incredible--the
inexhaustible greed of men."</TE>
<TE>   The lawyer considers his crime fiction a meaningful hobby. "It
takes less time than golf, but you don't get the fresh air."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mix and Match Party</TE>
<TE>   Talk magazine hosted an unorthodox pairing of folks at a dinner
Thursday at Spago in Beverly Hills. General Motors executives, in
town for the L.A. Auto Show, mixed with James Woods, Elizabeth Shue,
her husband Davis Guggenheim, Pam and Ed McMahon, Jay Leno and his
wife, Mavis, and Arianna Huffington. It was a casual affair; Woods
chatted about his golf game, Huffington quizzed Jerry Bruckheimer on
his latest film, "Black Hawk Down," and "Stuart Little 2" director
Rob Minkoff made friends with GM President Gary Cowger. Let's see if
the stars of Minkoff's upcoming film arrive at the premiere in GM's
latest models.</TE>

<LD>LEARNING TO FALL</LD>
<LD>   The Blessings of an Imperfect Life</LD>
<LD>   By Philip Simmons</LD>
<TE>   Bantam</TE>
<TE>   176 pages, $16.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's a spiritual truth reflecting on much in life: We must learn
to fall if we're ever going to walk. As toddlers, tripping is part of
the deal as we try to balance our ungraceful bodies on stubby legs
and take our first steps. All risky enterprises require falls of some
sort. Author Philip Simmons, in his collection of life-affirming
essays "Learning to Fall," recognizes this truth. He writes with
clarity about the many ways we topple--both spiritually and
physically, sometimes with invigorating awe, more often with
terrifying speed.</TE>
<TE>   In sports, martial arts, dancing and rock climbing, Simmons
writes, we learn to fall bodily. Falling in and out of love is more
metaphorical, but involves the same sense of letting go and tumbling.
As we age, we fall from vigor into frailty and illness. Ultimately,
we will all take our biggest fall--from life into death. And yet,
though every act of falling is an integral part of life, he tells us,
"mostly, though, we learn to do it badly."</TE>
<TE>   Simmons has had to learn to fall, not out of choice, but due to
illness. At age 35 he learned he had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
or Lou Gehrig's disease, a fatal condition that has robbed him of
much of his physical competence. Confined to a wheelchair and having
difficulty speaking, he lives in the shadow of the New Hampshire
mountains he used to love climbing, and reflects on the tenuous
quality of life. In 12 essays, he meditates on the change of seasons
and what the physical world tells us of the human condition; his
nature writing is crystalline, exuding a vivid and incisive
sensitivity to his surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   He also considers his transformation caused by the progressive
illness, not solely in light of his own suffering but from a wider
perspective: that of the wisdom that's accumulated over the centuries
about physical deterioration, falling and death. Though primarily
writing from a Christian orientation, he pulls from a broad range of
wisdom traditions to consider his plight, and all of ours.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a story of triumph over adversity," he warns readers.
"The man chased by tigers does not win in the end, at least not
Hollywood fashion. In Christian theology, we fall so that we can rise
again later. That's a good story, too, but not the one I'm telling."
Rather, Simmons' story focuses on the victory found in falling
itself, of rushing headlong into the failings of life, and of
realizing that our own vulnerability is "the cost of walking upright
on the earth." (Prior to his illness, Simmons was a professor of
English at Lake Forest College in Illinois, and his love for
literature fuels his narrative. He quotes aptly from Thoreau, Marcus
Aurelius, Aristotle, Descartes, Freud, Sartre--even Woody Allen--on
surrendering to life's imperfections.</TE>
<TE>   "Mine is the mysticism of everyday life," he writes, "of the
heaped laundry and the bruised toe, of overcooked broccoli and leaves
spangled with dew, of sunrise and sorrow, laughter and linguine,
music and mold." This mysticism, he tells us, requires no special
powers beyond imagination, attention to the ordinary and "a
willingness to be surprised by grace."</TE>
<TE>   Though the book is an easy read, it is not facile in its
contemplation of the larger issues. Simmons' staunch refusal to slip
into self-pity is coupled with a sense of humor that enlivens the
tale. Commenting on his wife who makes sculptures out of salvaged
books, for example: "While ... I'm in my cabin in the woods writing
books, she's in her studio inflicting various tortures upon them, and
in this regard you could say we have a perfect marriage."</TE>
<TE>   Simmons commands us to stop the litany of worries long enough to
see the preciousness of each moment. Knowing you're going to die, he
suggests, pushes you to a wildness in life, an open-armed acceptance
of all its sundry parts, a willingness to live on the edge.</TE>
<TE>   The type of falling that most interests Simmons is not so much a
falling away from, but a falling to: When we fall from ego, from our
carefully constructed identities, we are then able to fall into
passion, into terror, into humility and into oneness with others who
are likewise falling. "We fall, at last, into the presence of the
sacred, into godliness, into mystery, into our better, diviner
natures."</TE>

<LD>Makeup and the Movies</LD>
<LD>   Makeup is used in movies to change and intensify actors' features.
In old Hollywood, Max Factor was the king of makeup.</LD>
<LD>   Factor was a Russian immigrant. He and his family moved from St.
Louis to Los Angeles in 1908. He opened a barbershop and was soon
making wigs for silent film stars. In 1914, Factor invented a lighter
makeup for actors who complained that the heavy greasepaint they wore
in the theater looked unnatural. He introduced eye shadow in 1916. By
the 1920s, many of Hollywood's most important stars and studios were
among his clients.</LD>
<TE>   Factor also created a line of cosmetics, including eye shadow, lip
gloss, eyeliner and rouge, for people who wanted to look like movie
stars. He called his products "makeup." Today, many women still get
ideas about makeup from the movies and use the modern version of
products and techniques that Factor pioneered.</TE>
<TE>   Factor won an Oscar in 1929 for his invention of a new kind of
makeup for actors in black-and-white movies. During the 1930s, he
built a studio at Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue that
contained makeup salons, laboratories and a wig-making department.</TE>
<TE>   His company was sold to Proctor &amp; Gamble in 1992, and its historic
makeup collection was donated to Hollywood Entertainment Museum.
There you can see a display of Factor's cosmetics and furniture as
well as photos of the movie stars who wore his makeup.</TE>
<TE>   The museum is open daily, except Wednesdays, from 11 a.m. to 6
p.m. For information, call (323) 960-4833 or visit
www.hollywoodmuseum.com.</TE>

<HD>'Can't' Is the Worst Word Ever</HD>
<DH>Part 2: The story so far: Emily has a weak heart. She
doesn't like the word "can't."</DH>

<LD>My best friend, Callie, said I can't do things, so I decided to make
a list of all the things Callie and I can do! I thought they were
pretty exciting.</LD>
<LD>   * We dressed up my cat, Pudder, and made her look like a little
old lady.</LD>
<LD>   * We had Chinese Checkers competitions where, I am proud to say, I
remained the world champ.</LD>
<TE>   * We read mystery books together and made scary sounds.</TE>
<TE>   But when it was a nice day, I knew that Callie would be out riding
her bike. And she was really into sports, especially soccer. So
during soccer season, she didn't come to my house too often.</TE>
<TE>   Now I admit that I did feel bad. Especially when Callie told me I
can't--which is my least favorite word. But deep inside, I knew she
was right. I couldn't ride bikes with Callie and I couldn't play
soccer. So on Saturday when Callie called and told me that she had to
go on a picnic with her friends after soccer practice and she
couldn't come over to make yarn octopus dolls, I felt sad. But I knew
what I was going to do. And no one was going to tell me that I
couldn't do it.</TE>
<TE>   I may not be able to play soccer. But I can write about the kids
who do!</TE>
<TE>   So the first thing Monday morning, I went to the office of Ms.
Carter, who is the head of our school newspaper, the Weekly Bugle.
Ms. Carter thought I was there to submit another poem. I write a lot
of poems. I told her, no, that this time I wanted to write a sports
story.</TE>
<TE>   Ms. Carter knows that I am not a sports person. But I told her
that Callie plays soccer and Linda is a great tennis player and Karen
does gymnastics and I want to write about all the cool things they
do.</TE>
<TE>   Ms. Carter laughed and said that sounded like a lot of stories.
She said to start with one. I should write a story about Callie.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: Will Emily's plan work?</TE>
<TE>   Cherie Troped says she started writing the very same way Emily
did. And she doesn't like the word "can't" either! This story will be
on The Times' Web site at www.latimes.com/kids.</TE>

<HD>'9-11': The Term Sparks a Minor War of Words</HD>
<DH>An appropriate expression to describe Sept. 11 attacks
defies consensus among linguists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RENEE TAWA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly four months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, there still
is no consensus--even among English-language experts--on how to refer
to the events. Last week, the American Dialect Society voted "9-11
and its equivalents" as its Word of the Year 2001, the phrase or term
that best characterizes the previous year. Meanwhile, online
discussion forums are featuring touchy exchanges on just what to call
the attacks in Manhattan and at the Pentagon following the recent
announcement of a controversial selection on another group's annual
list of banished words: "9-11," or "nine-eleven."</LD>
<LD>   At its annual meeting in San Francisco, the American Dialect
Society's linguists and lexicographers decided that the Word of the
Year should also include "911" and "Sept. 11." Some members had
argued against choosing number references, saying that outside North
America, the use of "911" as an emergency phone number is not widely
known. Also, in Europe and elsewhere, "9-11" is confusing, because
dates are abbreviated by giving the day first and then the month (For
instance, Sept. 11 would be "11-9").</LD>
<LD>   "Others were saying, 'It doesn't matter how the Germans do dates.
It's an American thing,'" said Wayne Glowka, chairman of the
society's New Words Committee.</LD>
<TE>   But members agreed that the title should go to an expression that
refers to the attacks, so they settled on "9-11" and "all the rest of
them," Glowka said. The term beat out finalists such as "ground
zero," "burka" and "let's roll," the phrase used by a passenger who
helped thwart hijackers on the United Airlines flight that crashed in
Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   The group has selected a Word of the Year since 1990 as a way to
highlight the dynamics of the language. Last year, "chad" was its
Word of the Year, the same term that topped the "List of Words
Banished From the Queen's English for Mis-Use, Over-Use and General
Uselessness," released by Lake Superior State University in Sault
Ste. Marie, Mich.  This year, the banished-words list's most
controversial entry is "9-11," which is referred to as an "annoying"
or "cute" abbreviation by members of the public who submitted
nominations. "Last year, we had Y2K and 24/7," wrote one nominator
from Michigan. "This new digital language (digitalk?) should be
banned ... Do we refer to the ... sinking of the Titanic ... [as]
4-14? A tragic event of such proportions should not be confused with
a telephone number." Added one nominator from Madison, Wis.: "It's
overused and sounds ridiculous. ... "</TE>
<TE>   The university isn't proposing any alternatives, said spokesman
Tom Pink. "How do you wrap it up into one word? Maybe you can't, or
maybe we shouldn't." Several people have criticized the university
for adding "9-11" to the banished-words list, saying its inclusion
trivializes the tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   On the banished-words list message board, one observer wrote:
"Consider 9-11's pedigree: We don't call her Jennifer Lopez, but
'J-Lo.' We didn't call the movie "Independence day," but 'ID-4.' We
don't work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, but '24/7.' Do we
really want to use this same cloth to fashion a word for [the
attacks]?"</TE>
<TE>   On www.plastic.com, a news and discussion Web site, the list drew
this reaction:  " ... this isn't about the World Trade Center. This
isn't about New York. To use those ideas in the description of this
event is to miss the point. Simply, it is a moment in time, in
history, not a place or a specific structure. 9-11, even
etymologically, is perfect."</TE>

<HD>In This Debate, Actions Speak Louder Than Words</HD>
<DH>Television* The Oscar-nominated 'Sound and Fury,' tonight
on PBS, explores the deaf community's conflicted reactions to hearing
via cochlear implants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN CLARK</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>If ever there were an aptly titled film, it's "Sound and Fury" (with
apologies to William Faulkner). Seldom have audiences been treated to
such a raw demonstration of invective between family members as in
this film. And it has the added benefit of being true.</LD>
<LD>   "You have a new relationship with the hair on the back of your
head," says the film's director, Josh Aronson. "In the fight at the
afternoon barbecue, where Marian and Peter go at it, what we have [on
film] is 10 minutes, but the fight went on for 45 minutes. It was
just amazing. I remember feeling, 'Oh, my God, we're shooting
something that's so real, so powerful.'"</LD>
<LD>   The subject of "Sound and Fury," which airs tonight at 9 on PBS
stations KCET and KVCR, might not seem incendiary. The documentary,
which was nominated last year for an Academy Award, examines the
controversy raging in the deaf community over the cochlear implant,
which enables deaf people to hear. A good thing, yes?</LD>
<TE>   Some deaf people are not so sure; other interested parties,
primarily the hearing, find this attitude bewildering, even
appalling. Perhaps the dispute would have remained as arcane as it
appears (at least to those with no stake in the issue) had Aronson
and producer Roger Weisberg not had the good fortune to find a family
on Long Island, the Artinians, that passionately embodies both sides
of the argument.</TE>
<TE>   In one corner is Peter Artinian, who, along with his wife and
three children, is deaf. When his youngest daughter, Heather, wants
an implant, he initially entertains the idea but increasingly becomes
resistant to it. In the other corner is Peter's hearing brother,
Chris, who fathers a child who is deaf. When he decides to get this
child an implant, the battle is joined.</TE>
<TE>   Kibitzing from the sidelines are Peter and Chris' opinionated (and
not at all conflicted) hearing mother, Marian; Peter's wife, Nita,
who at first wanted an implant herself; Chris' hearing wife, Mari,
whose parents are deaf; and assorted members of the deaf community.</TE>
<TE>   One of Peter's objections is that the implant is invasive,
requiring a half-inch penetration of the cochlea. Normally, only one
ear is implanted; the other is left alone to accommodate
technological advances. According to Aronson, of the 2 million
profoundly deaf people in this country, 18,000--mostly children--have
received the implant (it doesn't work so well on adults who've been
deaf all their lives). He compares the hazards of the procedure to a
tonsillectomy, although Peter has doubts about its safety and the
morality of subjecting a child to it without advocates understanding
what it's like to be deaf.</TE>
<TE>   So there is fear in the deaf community, fear of the procedure and
also, perhaps more to the point, fear of losing their children to the
hearing world. Heather would go to a hearing school and develop
hearing friends, to the exclusion of her family. The movie provides a
fascinating glimpse of the world she might give up, a world unto
itself, complete with its own language, American Sign Language, used
by about 400,000 people (the rest of the profoundly deaf lip-read and
speak). In fact, as Peter and others in the deaf community make
clear, they feel that their culture is in many ways richer than that
of the hearing world. And, like any minority, they are afraid that
the mainstreaming of its members would destroy that culture.</TE>
<TE>   As compelling as these arguments are, it's hard for a hearing
person to agree that the sanctity of the family and the preservation
of a culture are worth the price, especially when Marian notes that
deaf children are often developmentally behind hearing children.
Consequently, their employment and economic prospects are dimmer. Is
Peter really looking out for Heather's best interests, or his own? To
his way of thinking, Heather won't miss what she never knew, and
she'll be amply compensated for this deficiency by the deaf
community, some of whom don't consider deafness a deficiency anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, as in all arguments, the winner is the person with the
last word. The filmmakers were mindful of that.</TE>
<TE>   "The intent was always to be absolutely balanced, to walk the line
between the two and let both sides have their voice," Aronson says.
"For instance, that moment when both Marian and her husband more or
less accuse Peter of being abusive and the audience is feeling,
'Sure, this is a ridiculous thing to do,' we cut to Marian at the end
in tears saying, 'I'm just trying to get him beyond his fear.'"</TE>
<TE>   "We had to go back to the dailies to find something equally strong
for Peter to come back with because we felt we were tipping our hand
in Marian's favor," Weisberg says.</TE>
<TE>   These balancing acts were not the only thing found in the editing
room--the whole documentary was. Originally, the filmmakers intended
to profile five people who represented the conflict (both sides were
initially wary). Some of these stories were extraordinary, like the
cochlear implant recipient who had the process reversed and the
lawyer who'd deceived her fiance and law partners into believing she
could hear (she was an artful lip reader). Then they found the
Artinians. The family's saga began to make the other subjects seem
dramatically inert.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't realize that at first," Weisberg says. "We held on to
the notion that, OK, we found a great family and there's a drama here
and we'll weave them with these other subjects. The other subjects
had life experiences and opinions that could help inform this story.
But as we got further into the editing process, the other subjects
one by one were dropping off."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Aronson and Weisberg had vehement arguments of their own
over which of the subjects was going to make the cut. Ultimately, of
course, none of them did, although that was not the end of the
filmmakers' problems. They decided that rather than subtitle the
scenes in which the characters speak in American Sign Language,
they'd have the lines dubbed, which would allow the film, among other
things, to cut away from a speaker and not confuse the audience. To
this end, they used members of the crew for a temp track and then
cast voices to "play" Peter and Nita and even Heather. Because Peter
could easily be seen as the heavy in this drama, his voice was the
toughest to cast. Test audiences found him a trifle too objectionable
with the first voice they used, so they had to find another one.</TE>
<TE>   At least voices are a controllable element. At the end of the
film, the filmmakers were allowed to shoot the occasion on which
Chris' child, having received the implant, hears his first sound. It
was either a moment of high drama or a bust.</TE>
<TE>   "Often in those switch-ons, not a lot happens and it's not real
evident that a child is experiencing" sound, Weisberg says. "Or
sometimes the actions are really negative, so we got the best
reaction we could hope for."</TE>
<TE>   "Well," says Aronson, "the kid could have started saying algebraic
formulas. That might have been better. They warned us. A lot of the
kids just cry. I remember telling the cameramen [Brian Danitz, Gordy
Waterman], 'Now, [the doctor] is going to go, "One, two, three,"
bang,' and you've got to get to that kid. This is one moment in his
life that you can't miss.'"</TE>
<TE>   And to Aronson and Weisberg's everlasting relief, the cameramen
didn't. On the child's face is a look of surprise and, maybe, wonder.</TE>

<LD>NBC's midseason comedy "Imagine That" opens tonight as a
testosterone-lite "Mind of the Married Man," the HBO series driven by
lust and lusty fantasies.</LD>
<LD>   Although "Imagine That" isn't graphic, its tone is strongly
orgasmic. The premiere is totally about sex, as sketch comedy writer
Josh Miller (Hank Azaria) and his wife, Wendy (Jayne Brook), visit a
therapist twice to work out their problems in bed. He wants sex when
he wants it; she doesn't want it much at all. Meanwhile, all eyes are
on the breasts and thong underwear of the beautiful new assistant
hired by Josh's skirt-chasing partner, Kenny (Joshua Malina), for no
apparent reason other than her impressive bodily attributes.</LD>
<LD>   She came in and "blew me away," Kenny says. Josh: "I'm so glad you
said 'away.'"</LD>
<TE>   That's a sample of the humor in this series, whose adult material
is a terrible match for its 8 p.m. time period. With Azaria as an
executive producer as well as star, "Imagine That" has a nice cast
but delivers sporadically. Only rarely is the premiere funny, its
best moments yielded by Barb (Katey Sagal), the spacey head writer on
the TV series for which Josh and Kenny work. It's ironic that writing
should be problematic in the debut of a series whose setting is a TV
comedy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine That" premieres tonight at 8 on NBC. The network has
rated it TV-14 (may be unsuitable for children younger than 14).</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Signaling that it's not about to be left behind in the war for cable
news channel talent, MSNBC has hired conservative former presidential
candidate Alan Keyes to anchor a nightly talk show.</LD>
<LD>   In what could shape up as a battle for conservative viewers, the
opinionated former radio talk show host and diplomat will be pitted
at 7 p.m. against Greta Van Susteren, who last week was hired away
from CNN to anchor a show for Fox News Channel.</LD>
<LD>   The 51-year-old Keyes comes with a potential built-in audience of
fans loyal to his message decrying the moral decay in America, a
point of view quite distinct from Van Susteren, who was one of the
leading proponents on TV against impeaching President Clinton. There
is already speculation that viewers of Fox, with its reputation for
giving more air time than other channels to conservative voices, will
be put off by her show and might find Keyes an alternative.</LD>
<TE>   Keyes--whose Washington, D.C.-based show, "Alan Keyes Is Making
Sense," begins Jan. 21--also will be up against CNN's new
high-profile newscast anchored by Aaron Brown, making the hour an
intense battleground for the relatively small but dedicated news
channel audience. By some ratings measures, Fox and CNN are
essentially neck and neck during the East Coast prime-time hours,
with MSNBC drawing a smaller but advertiser-friendly younger
audience. Fox and CNN declined to address the competition issue.</TE>
<TE>   When executives at MSNBC began talking to Keyes several weeks ago,
"we did not know Fox was going to program one of the leading Clinton
supporters at [7 p.m.]," said Erik Sorenson, MSNBC's president and
general manager, referring to Van Susteren, whose new show will debut
in February.</TE>
<TE>   In the musical chairs that has lately characterized the cable news
wars, Van Susteren's show takes the place of a program that had been
hosted by Paula Zahn, until CNN lured her away in September. Zahn has
significantly improved CNN's ratings in the 4-7 a.m. timeslot. And
while CNN and Fox have both seen major morning viewership spikes
since Sept. 11, Zahn is now edging out "Fox and Friends."</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Sorenson said MSNBC had been looking for a new anchor
to round out its evening lineup, which also includes newscasts
anchored by Brian Williams and Ashleigh Banfield, in the wake of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Previously, the hour featured a taped
program called "Headliners and Legends," but news executives felt
that live topical programming was more timely, given the continuing
story of the war.</TE>
<TE>   MSNBC looked for someone "provocative and iconoclastic," according
to Sorenson, and Keyes was "the most intriguing" name on the list.
Keyes was a Reagan-era deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations
who ran for president in 1996 and 2000. He wrote "Our Character, Our
Future: Reclaiming America's Moral Destiny."</TE>
<TE>   Keyes fits fairly easily into MSNBC's lineup, which is known for
having a mix of political commentators. In the past, these have
included Republican Ollie North and Clinton advisor Paul Begala.</TE>
<TE>   On another front, CNN pulled a promotional ad for Zahn that
described her as "sexy." The promo, which wasn't approved by CNN
executives, was taken off the air after just one day, and CNN will
change its approval process for ads.</TE>
<TE>   CNN News Group Chairman Walter Isaacson said in a statement: "It
was a major blunder by our promotions department....I am outraged and
so is Paula, who has spent more than 20 years proving her credibility
day in and day out."</TE>

<HD>Court TV Quietly Winning a Crucial Trial--Gaining Viewers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To people who haven't been paying attention, the spotlight now
shining on Court TV due to its bid to televise the federal trial of
terrorism suspect Zacarias Moussaoui may seem like the channel's
brightest moment since O.J. Simpson.</LD>
<LD>   But TV industry watchers will tell you the real story of Court TV
is the remarkable, if quietly won, success it has achieved in recent
years without a circus-level trial to show.</LD>
<LD>   A change in programming strategy, begun shortly after founder
Steven Brill sold his stake to his big-media partners in 1997, has
seen Court TV increase prime-time ratings almost tenfold. Since then,
it has moved from a mid-level cable channel, available in about 30
million homes, to a basic-cable mainstay in close to 70 million
homes. Court TV is among the fastest-growing channels and is coming
off its best month ever in December.</LD>
<TE>   "If they were a newly launched network, it would be an amazing
story," says Gary Lico, president and CEO of CableReady, a developer
and distributor of programming to cable networks, including Court TV.
"But the fact that it is a turnaround is a more amazing story. It's
pretty tough to move the needle that much in that short a period of
time."</TE>
<TE>   What had been a niche channel closer in mission to C-SPAN than TNT
is now flirting with cracking cable's top 10.</TE>
<TE>   The fundamental change was similar to those enacted at other cable
channels, including MTV and, just recently, CNN, both of which
increased their audience by doing less of the thing for which they
were best known.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1991, Court TV used to rely on putting American
jurisprudence on TV and using the trials of the moment to fill its
programming. Just six weeks into the channel's existence, the William
Kennedy Smith rape trial helped put Court TV on the cultural map.</TE>
<TE>   "In some ways it was early reality television," says Herbert
Terry, an Indiana University telecommunications professor who studies
media and the law. "It was successful at representing the drama of
real life and people in stressful situations before we invented
'Survivor.' It's more real than reality TV."</TE>
<TE>   And Terry says he can't disagree with Court TV's claim to have
performed a valuable civic function over the years. "While there's
clearly a tendency of the service to choose extraordinary cases if
they can," he says, "I don't think it's entirely disingenuous for
them to say, 'We've helped educate people.'</TE>
<TE>   "The other impact has been for the most part positive on the
judicial system and the opening up of courts to cameras."</TE>
<TE>   CEO Sought Steady Prime-Time Lineup</TE>
<TE>   But when he took over Court TV three years ago, new CEO Henry
Schleiff moved to de-emphasize some of that signature courtroom
coverage by developing a steady prime-time lineup whose ratings would
not be dependent on how "hot" the trial of the moment was.</TE>
<TE>   Schleiff hired ex-judge and Fox News Channel anchor Catherine
Crier to host an evening talk show, spent the cash of owning partners
Time Warner AOL and Liberty Media for reruns of some big-name,
syndicated criminal justice shows, including "Homicide: Life on the
Street" and "NYPD Blue," and developed some documentary series, most
notably Court TV's signature series, "Forensic Files."</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't take a rocket scientist to see that there was a huge
opportunity there," Schleiff says. "When I walked in, my first budget
presentation showed a prime-time audience of 38,000 homes. We could
have done a budget presentation for each one."</TE>
<TE>   As for ratings, "we literally were doing a 0.1, which this phone
call would get." For December, Court TV did a 0.8 in prime time, and
the number of homes in the month's last week was up to 734,000.</TE>
<TE>   Brill, now a columnist for Newsweek, is cautious in assessing the
strategy begun after he left.</TE>
<TE>   "I never wanted to do things like show reruns of crime dramas,
because then you're just doing something that any other channel could
do," Brill says. "The danger is it puts them in the business of
bidding against everyone else. You also have to figure out with some
precision what you pay for each ratings point."</TE>
<TE>   (Schleiff says the station is making money "if you don't count
what we have expended on launch support"--expensive promotions that
help bring bigger audiences.)</TE>
<TE>   The station's boosters argue that, if you look at the trials it
has chosen to cover, Court TV has always had commercial motives, and
the new direction is only a firmer emphasis of that fact.</TE>
<TE>   The question some observers have is how far the dilution will go.
Will Court TV further turn away from trial coverage and analysis, now
the mainstay of its daytime programming? Schleiff says no.</TE>
<TE>   "It's what distinguishes Court TV," he says. "The combination is
what makes us different."</TE>
<TE>   Judge Leonie Brinkema will conduct a hearing Wednesday in U.S.
District Court in Alexandria, Va., on the channel's request that the
court allow cameras in the Moussaoui trial, scheduled for October.</TE>
<TE>   Debating Allowing Cameras in Courtroom</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers have sided with Court TV, arguing that cameras
will show the world the trial is being conducted fairly. Prosecutors
said a television presence could make it easier for terrorists to
retaliate against witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Most state courts allow television cameras, often at the
discretion of individual judges, and studies have suggested cameras
do not have the distorting effect their opponents fear.</TE>
<TE>   "As controversial as some of them have been," says Indiana
University's Terry, "they've by and large been positive
demonstrations that you can do this and the cameras don't
fundamentally screw things up. If O.J. got off, it was by and large
because of cunning lawyers who made a positive appeal to the jury and
not because of the presence of cameras."</TE>
<TE>   "In every case we did," agrees Brill, "I could make the argument
that televising the trial was good for justice, including O.J.
Simpson." In William Kennedy Smith as in Rodney King, for instance,
people who actually watched tended to be more sympathetic than the
wider public, with whom the verdicts were largely unpopular, he says,
and the Simpson case pointed up problems in the legal system.</TE>
<TE>   And the development of ever less intrusive technology, he adds,
"sort of forces the debate to be what it should be, which is: Should
anyone who wants to be able to watch a trial?"</TE>
<TE>   But with some minor exceptions, the federal courts continue to
prohibit them. Court TV is arguing that prohibition is
unconstitutional because, in essence, the framers intended for trials
to be public events. Terry says he is unsure whether the judge will
allow the Moussaoui case to be televised but expects that the time is
not too far off when even federal rules are relaxed significantly.</TE>
<TE>   However the Moussaoui decision goes, the controversy the request
has engendered has been good public relations for Court TV. Pushing
hard for the right to televise this high-profile trial only
re-emphasizes in people's minds the link between Court TV and
criminal justice.</TE>

<HD>Behold the Many Moods of Elvis</HD>
<DH>At the annual Birthday Bash, performers playfully and
lovingly pay tribute to Presley's varied influences, from roots
music, R&amp;B, pop, country and beyond.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Elvis hadn't existed, surely we'd have been forced to invent him.
That theory never rang truer than at the 17th annual Elvis Birthday
Bash, held Sunday at House of Blues in West Hollywood, just two days
shy of what would have been the King's 67th birthday.</LD>
<LD>   The infinite malleability of Elvis the man, the musician and the
pop-culture icon sustained a nearly five-hour show with dozens of
performers who, by turns, paid reverent, ironic, cynical, heartfelt,
joking or just plain impenetrable tribute to Presley's music and
public image.</LD>
<LD>   Anyone not familiar with Presley's culture-changing synthesis of
American roots music undoubtedly would have been perplexed trying to
pinpoint a unifying factor as various acts emphasized the multiple
facets of his music. Country, blues, R&amp;B, pop, bluegrass, Hollywood
hokum--all except the gospel music closest to his heart--got ample
air time.</LD>
<TE>   In some respects, the annual tribute turns into a "top this!"
challenge to each succeeding talent roster. The King's Order of El
Mysah came up with the best visual gimmick--everyone in the band wore
leopard-print fezzes and black turtlenecks--during respectable whacks
at "Blue Hawaii" and "Rock-A-Hula Baby" (whose composer, Ben Wiseman,
took a quick bow).</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, 30 years from now, no one's going to have half this much
fun saluting U2.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Rosie Flores, Billy Swan, Evie Sands, Big Sandy
&amp; His-Fly-Rite Boys, Russell Scott &amp; the Red Hots, the Sprague
Brothers and Kevin Banford &amp; the Bakersfield Boys stayed mostly
sincere in each of their two- or three-song sets.</TE>
<TE>   Event stalwart and co-founder James Intveld offered possibly the
most obscure song choice of the night in "Is It So Strange," a Faron
Young number Presley recorded in 1957.</TE>
<TE>   Most musicians favored '50s Elvis, which most aficionados consider
his most inspired period. Still, the capacity crowd got a generous
sprinkling of such kitschy film songs as "Spinout," "Stop, Look and
Listen" and, of course, "Viva Las Vegas." Flores offered one of the
few '70s Elvis numbers with an openly emotional performance of
"Always on My Mind," the Willie Nelson song Presley recorded in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   Other than a handful of renditions of his Sun Records-era scorcher
"Baby Let's Play House," there was impressively little repetition,
despite the number of participants. The artistic returns, and the
crowd, began to diminish markedly after about the third hour. The end
came two hours after that with a pair of Elvis impersonators whose
tacky outfits didn't obscure their genuine affection for the show's
honoree.</TE>
<TE>   Such a night.</TE>

<HD>A New Tempest in the  TV Set</HD>
<DH>Television* New academy chairman Bryce Zabel, originally
seen as a peacemaker, has added to the tumult of the group behind the
Emmys.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a roller-coaster ride with last year's twice-postponed Emmy
Awards, the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences--which presents the
television industry's top honor--still finds itself in tumult, this
time over stewardship of the nonprofit organization.</LD>
<LD>   The academy has long been plagued by internal disputes, with a
history of infighting that has prompted some leading television
officials to stay away and one senior executive, speaking on
condition of anonymity, to discuss the group as "a hornet's nest."</LD>
<LD>   Many within the organization hoped the situation would ease after
writer-producer Bryce Zabel was elected chairman in August, replacing
Meryl Marshall-Daniels, who served consecutive two-year terms.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, several members of the group's board of governors are
upset over last month's decision not to renew the contract of academy
president Jim Chabin without consulting the board.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, a showdown over how the academy is run could come
during a board meeting Wednesday evening, the first since the vote
was conducted.</TE>
<TE>   The latest academy brouhaha comes at a sensitive time, with
negotiations to begin next year on a new television contract
governing the Emmy Awards, which provides most of the academy's
annual revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Chabin had been pursuing closer ties with the New
York-based National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, which
organizes the news, sports and daytime Emmys, after its bitter split
from the West Coast academy in the 1970s. It's unclear how his
departure will effect those discussions.</TE>
<TE>   Zabel declined to discuss the reasoning behind the board's
decision but said it would be addressed Wednesday night. Chabin also
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Mindful of the academy's history, some officers are saying the
group needs to address issues pertaining to Chabin's renewal before
it can move forward.</TE>
<TE>   "I have great concern that the board was not consulted on a
decision as important as this," said Dan Birman, a documentary
producer who sits on the executive committee as secretary.</TE>
<TE>   Through an accident of timing, the Emmys spent extended time in
the spotlight during the fall. Postponed twice by the events of Sept.
11 and their aftermath, the Emmys became a litmus test for what some
anticipated would be an altered public tolerance of the fluffy and
inconsequential,  balancing that view against the insistence that
anything less than full-throated pursuit of such pastimes would be a
victory for terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Savoring that the Emmys went off largely without a hitch and to
mostly positive reviews, many within the academy were hoping for a
period of relative tranquillity.</TE>
<TE>   That changed with the vote regarding Chabin by the executive
committee, which consists in part of half a dozen appointed industry
leaders and six elected officers, among them Zabel, who assumed that
role during the fall and is said to have orchestrated the push to let
Chabin go. The board itself is made up of more than 50 industry
professionals representing each of 27 branches, from actors and
directors to editing and sound.</TE>
<TE>   Although the bylaws state that officers serve "at the pleasure of
the board," there is precedent for the executive committee's handling
the decision-making process in renewing contracts. Despite the fact
Chabin still has supporters within the board, the dissidents stress
that their principal concern is protocol, especially given that Zabel
ran for the chairman's job by promising to empower governors in the
organization's management. At the least, they want a fuller
explanation of the decision and assurances that the board has a
clearly defined role in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "If the board of governors is not making the final decision on how
the academy is run, then what are we doing there?" asked Steve
Binder, one of the directors branch's two representatives.</TE>
<TE>   Zabel said the executive committee "followed the rules" in making
its decision and that the board has the right to revise the academy's
bylaws if it chooses. "The board has the ultimate power over the
television academy ... and I do support the board's power," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall-Daniels, also an independent producer, amassed various
achievements during her tenure as chairman--among them altering
voting procedure to allow more people to participate in selecting
Emmy winners--but was also criticized for contributing to
factionalism within the group, straining relations with the paid
staff and at times withholding information from the board. Most
candidates she backed during last summer's election (including UCLA
professor Jeff Cole, who ran against Zabel) were defeated.</TE>
<TE>   During the last 25 years, only two high-level executives, the late
Columbia Pictures President John Mitchell and former Disney Studios
chief Richard Frank, have headed the academy, and the reluctance of
leading figures to become involved in recent years may have limited
the group's clout and prestige. Some academy veterans say that Frank,
for example, was better able to deal with the networks than those who
might harbor an incentive to parlay involvement with the group into
greater status within the industry.</TE>
<TE>   Insiders say the media attention showered on the Emmys may have
fueled tension between Zabel and Chabin over who should publicly
represent the academy in interviews with such news outlets as NBC's
"Today." Zabel disputed that  but would not discuss his relationship
with Chabin.</TE>
<TE>   However, Nancy Tokos, a member of the executive committee,
maintains that Zabel had plenty of support in deciding to make a
change and that it was "not in the best interests of the television
academy" to retain Chabin, who also clashed with Zabel's predecessor,
Marshall-Daniels.</TE>
<TE>   Zabel did acknowledge, however, the academy might need to
reexamine its structure. "It is clear that the academy needs to
grapple with the general issue of what they want the chairman to do
and what they want the president to do," he said. "Ultimately, the
board may wish to address that issue, but that's their call."</TE>
<TE>   A writer-producer who has worked on such shows as "Dark Skies" and
"Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman," Zabel received
considerable media exposure because of the Emmy postponements, and he
details those interviews on his Web site, which includes contact
information for speaking engagements and personal appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Zabel stressed that he doesn't view such appearances as a source
of income and, if anything, may wind up sacrificing work because of
the time he is devoting to the academy.</TE>
<TE>   "If the question is, do I hope to gain from having this job, the
truth is it goes the other way in many respects," he said.</TE>

<LD>   Watchdog Group Wins on Da Vinci Restoration</LD>
<LD>   The Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy, has abandoned plans to
restore Leonardo da Vinci's "The Adoration of the Magi," an
unfinished work by the artist, in the wake of protests from ArtWatch,
an international watchdog group dedicated to protecting works from
what it regards as overzealous restorers.</LD>
<TE>   According to BBC News Online, the international anti-restoration
campaign is supported by dozens of scholars of Renaissance art from
the United States, Britain and Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Uffizi director Annamaria Petrioli Tofani had argued restoration
was needed because of damage to the wood on which the painting was
based and the weakening adhesion of the paint. But ArtWatch sent an
open letter to the Uffizi asking that such action be put on hold
until the art world had been consulted.</TE>
<TE>   ArtWatch U.K.'s director, Mike Daley, called the prospective
restoration particularly troubling because the painting was
unfinished, he said. The Uffizi decision was especially gratifying,
he added, after the Louvre's decision not to restore the "Mona Lisa."</TE>
<TE>   "If the restorers had got to that, nothing would be sacred,
nothing would be left alone," he said. "It had seemed we'd reached a
point where the whole heritage of the world's art was fair game for
restorers."</TE>

<TE>   Report Disputes 'Copenhagen' Premise</TE>
<TE>   Werner Heisenberg, the scientific genius behind Adolf Hitler's
secret atomic bomb program, revealed its existence in 1941 to Niels
Bohr, the Danish scientist who became part of the Manhattan Project,
according to secret documents cited in London's Sunday Times. The
material indicates Heisenberg did not express moral doubts about
building a bomb for Hitler when he met with Bohr in Nazi-occupied
Denmark. Neither did he hint he might be willing to sabotage the
project.</TE>
<TE>   Both premises underlie Michael Frayn's award-winning play
"Copenhagen," which just concluded an L.A. run and is playing at the
Laguna Playhouse. The drama speculates on the significance of the
1941 encounter on the eventual failure of the Nazi atomic project.</TE>
<TE>   At the meeting, Heisenberg alerted Bohr to the existence of
Hitler's "Uranium club," according to a letter Bohr wrote but never
sent to his protege.</TE>
<TE>   "Essentially, the letter shows that Heisenberg told Bohr it was
possible that the war would be won with atomic weapons, indicating
that he was involved in such work," Finn Aaserud, director of
Copenhagen's Niels Bohr Archive, told the Associated Press on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Gerald Holton, professor emeritus of physics and the history of
science at Harvard University, said that Bohr's son had shown him the
letter in 1985 but asked him not to discuss it until it was publicly
released. The family had planned to do so in 2012--the 50th
anniversary of the scientist's death.</TE>

<TE>   TELEVISION</TE>
<TE>   Couric Defends 'Today,' Knocks 'GMA'</TE>
<TE>   Katie Couric, co-host of the "Today" show, shot back at critics
who said that the NBC morning program is softer than "Good Morning
America," saying that when it comes to programming, it's a case of
monkey see, monkey do.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to laugh when they do toy drives, just like we do, when
they do outside concerts, when they do a wedding," she says of her
ABC competitor in the current issue of Newsweek. "It's flattering,
but it would be nice for them to try some things that we haven't done
first."</TE>
<TE>   Couric, who just signed a record $65-million deal to stay with
"Today," said she was never close to leaving the network. Meanwhile,
"GMA" news reader Antonio Mora is leaving the ABC program to become
lead anchor at WBBM-TV in Chicago.</TE>

engineering and technical achievements.</TE>
<TE>   They include Pete Romano for the design and development of an

<HD>Springing to Action</HD>
<DH>Adopting Hong Kong's style of martial arts scenes, with their
ballet-like moves, has helped movie makers revive  a genre with
less graphic violence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD NATALE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just when it seemed that the Hollywood action film had reached its
nadir, a victim of one too many car crashes and explosions, it has
been reborn--with a decidedly Asian flavor.</LD>
<LD>   The prevalence of martial arts and Hong Kong-style balletic
choreography in American movies over the past few years has not only
refreshed the genre but also made it more accessible to a wider
audience, because the violence is less graphic and therefore more
ratings-friendly. In addition, action films, which were once almost
exclusively the purview of white male protagonists, have become more
inclusive, featuring female actors and ethnic minorities in heroic
roles.</LD>
<LD>   Though it has been evident in American movies since the first time
Bruce Lee kicked his way to cult fame in the '60s, the influence of
the stylized Hong Kong action genre truly broke through to the
mainstream with the Wachowski brothers' "The Matrix" in 1999,
according to many industry observers, revitalizing the way Hollywood
approached action in the most significant way since a guy named Bond,
James Bond, flicked his first high-tech gadget 40 years ago.</LD>
<TE>   The influence of the Hong Kong style goes well beyond Hollywood.
The French-language adventure "Brotherhood of the Wolf," which opens
Friday, is replete with martial arts and balletic choreography. It
adds a decidedly modern twist to the 18th century supernatural
thriller based on the legendary story of a hunt for the notorious
beast of Gevaudan, which terrorized the French countryside in the
years preceding the French Revolution.</TE>
<TE>   "Wolf" director Christophe Gans says he deliberately opted for
stylized action as a way of bringing contemporary vitality to the
movie. "'Brotherhood' is about old themes [such as] chivalry, and if
you want to talk to young audiences, you have to reference their
generation, which is familiar with video games and martial arts,"
Gans says.</TE>
<TE>   If "The Matrix," which used the Hong Kong style in a futuristic
sci-fi setting, was the breakthrough, then the 2000 independent hit
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," directed by Taiwan-born filmmaker
Ang Lee, confirmed its box-office potential for mainstream audiences.
(Yuen Woo-Ping did the choreography for both "The Matrix" and
"Crouching Tiger.") Lee based "Crouching Tiger" on his fond memories
of watching Hong Kong movies as a boy, and the film plugged into the
action audiences' appetite for martial arts and a quasi-mythological
dimension that also informed "The Matrix" and the earlier cult hit
"The Crow" (1994), starring the late Brandon Lee.</TE>
<TE>   The Hong Kong style was more than just a genre, encompassing
talents as diverse as John Woo ("Hard-Boiled"), Tsui Hark ("Peking
Opera Blues"), King Hu ("A Touch of Zen") and Yuen Woo-Ping ("Iron
Monkey"). But it has come to be an all-purpose label for a highly
stylized and carefully choreographed manner of dealing with violence
and physical action, everything from various kinds of martial arts to
swordplay and gun battles. What Bruce Lee did with his fists of fury,
Jackie Chan accomplished with his acrobatics and Chow Yun-Fat with
bullets.</TE>
<TE>   Elements from Hong Kong films first began to surface in American
movies such as Ridley Scott's 1989 film "Black Rain," says director
Peter Hyams, who then used them in his own 1994 film "Timecop,"
starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, and more recently in last year's "The
Musketeer."</TE>
<TE>   The use of Hong Kong-style action provided a justification for
revisiting Alexandre Dumas' swashbuckling, much-filmed "Three
Musketeers" tale, Hyams says. He was less interested in the martial
arts element than in the balletic choreography, which enhanced and
revitalized the swordplay sequences.</TE>
<TE>   "As with the Hong Kong films, it's breathtaking and also
cartoon-like," Hyams says. "It allows the audience to sit back and be
amused by the athleticism and the beauty of the choreography."</TE>
<TE>   The popularity of video games among the young generation of
filmgoers also helped set the stage for the acceptance of martial
arts and Asian-influenced action, says film critic David Chute, who
has written extensively about Hong Kong films.</TE>
<TE>   "Since many of the games were designed in Japan, it was a way of
acclimating [U.S.] audiences to that kind of movement and to
Asian-looking heroes," Chute says. That helped pave the way for
crossover stars like Jackie Chan and Jet Li and for the importation
of Hong Kong talents like John Woo.</TE>
<TE>   Since "The Matrix," stylized Hong Kong-style action has permeated
American movies from "Mission: Impossible 2" (directed by Woo) to
"Charlie's Angels" (choreographed by Hong Kong veteran Yuen Cheung
Yan) and "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider" (which is based on a video game).
Elements even pop up in films as diverse as "Ocean's Eleven" (in the
acrobatics of actor Shaobo Qin) and "The Lord of the Rings: The
Fellowship of the Ring," in the kinetic bouncing-off-the-wall battle
between Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Saruman (Christopher Lee).</TE>
<TE>   Proof of how  well-known the Hong Kong style is today comes from
the fact that it is ripe for spoofing in films like "Shrek," "Scary
Movie 2" and Steve Oedekerk's comedy "Kung Pow: Enter the Fist,"
which opens Jan. 18.</TE>
<TE>   For Oedekerk, the film is as much homage as a sendup. He has been
a fan of Hong Kong movies since the '70s. He says that the continuing
fascination with Hong Kong movies emanates from the athleticism of
the violence. "It's very much like watching a sport. Movies like
'Crouching Tiger' then took it to another level in which you
wondered, is it fighting or is it ballet? It's a wonderfully
expressive art form."</TE>
<TE>   The popularization of the Hong Kong style arrived in the nick of
time for Hollywood, says Los Angeles Times film critic Kenneth Turan.
The bone-crunching, bloody nature of the action genre had not only
peaked creatively but its excesses were also coming under attack from
Washington. Stricter enforcement of the R rating also made gore-fest
films less economically viable. The new stylization "allows Hollywood
to have its cake and eat it too," says Turan.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the Hong Kong style has broadened the audience
for action movies. Hollywood has repeatedly tried and failed to
create viable female action heroes. The mixture of women and guns
never quite jelled on the big screen. But when it came to making a
film version of the popular "Charlie's Angels," producer Leonard
Goldberg says that martial arts choreography was the perfect blend of
subject matter and style. .</TE>
<TE>   "'The Matrix' raised the bar," says Goldberg. "We knew we had to
reach for a new kind of action. You couldn't just shoot people and
have standard stunt fights."</TE>
<TE>   One of the hallmarks of the Hong Kong style is a mixture of action
and comic absurdity. And when Goldberg previewed "Charlie's Angels"
for audiences, the combination of humor and fluid movement received
high marks from audiences, who accepted and applauded the female
stars' physical prowess.</TE>
<TE>   It has also taken the sting out of violence, allowing more action
films to be rated PG-13 instead of R, enabling Hollywood to market
these movies to the all-important core teenage moviegoer. On the
other end, segments of the older audience who were turned off by
hard-edged action have also become converts to this new style.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not as threatening as gunplay," Hyams says. "You're not
killing or maiming people. If it wasn't true before Sept. 11, it's
now safe to say that shooting people is not amusing. When people leap
into the air and spin, you don't take it quite as seriously. It's
like telling the audience they don't have to worry."</TE>
<TE>   Now that it's reached critical mass, however, directors like
"Brotherhood of the Wolf's" Gans wonder how movies can sustain these
stylized elements without descending into parody. Hyams and others
contend that it will probably become a staple, though Hollywood is
unlikely to abandon car chases and gunplay.</TE>
<TE>   In his next film, Gans plans to combine movement with magic as a
way of evolving the style. And Goldberg is working hard to make sure
that the "Angels" sequel and his upcoming "Wonder Woman" film
credibly evolve the style. "We can't do what we did before. We have
to continue to push the envelope," Goldberg says.</TE>
<TE>   The Hong Kong style will continue to develop because it is part of
a tradition of physical action that is as old as movies themselves,
Gans believes. "If you look at Buster Keaton or Douglas Fairbanks
movies, what still amazes you today is their physical ability," Gans
says. "The only special effects that never grow old are what you can
do with the human body."</TE>

<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first-year show "The Guardian" is one of those serious dramas
with the plain title to prove it: You know, "The District," "The
Agency," the this, the that.</LD>
<LD>   What sets it apart are its compelling flawed hero, Simon Baker as
corporate lawyer Nick Fallin, and his volatile chemistry with Dabney
Coleman as his crusty father, Burton. The give-and-take between TV
newcomer Baker, who has a weather-beaten, Steve McQueen kind of
charm, and the veteran Coleman feels lifelike.</LD>
<LD>   As fans know, "The Guardian" traverses two legal worlds, cutthroat
corporate law and advocacy for troubled youths. The premise: While
striving to further his career, Fallin must serve 1,500 hours at a
Pittsburgh legal clinic because of a drug bust.</LD>
<TE>   In tonight's episode (CBS, 9 p.m.), co-written by creator David
Hollander, the battle of wills at the heart of the show heats up as
Fallin comes face to face with his addiction when his old dealer
turns up at his new workplace. Fallin's relationship with his
dad--and now ex-boss--also comes to a head as they square off in a
simple business negotiation that turns ugly.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, clinic chief Alvin Masterson (Alan Rosenberg) draws a
case that stirs the pangs of guilt that led him to a career in legal
aid. In a series in which no one escapes his past, co-star Rosenberg
helps anchor a potent cast.</TE>
<TE>   Like its protagonist, "The Guardian" has flaws. Courtroom scenes
can get maudlin, and some story lines feel rote, including tonight's
subplot about an abandoned baby.</TE>
<TE>   But the unlikely hit continues to unfold slowly, as characters
reveal themselves. Fallin surely will have to find redemption by
degrees. As viewers, we wouldn't want it any other way.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Visit the International Consumer Electronics Show, which began Monday
in Las Vegas, and you can see sales representatives hawking new
digital entertainment gadgets that let people mix content drawn from
the Web, television, radio, music CDs and movie DVDs. These devices,
although still unavailable in most stores, are already striking fear
in the heart of the entertainment industry.</LD>
<LD>   The industry has every right and obligation to vigorously defend
its copyrights. But some of its leaders are pressing for restrictions
that could end up hurting their business by turning off customers.
Their knee-jerk opposition to allowing consumers to copy digital
media has delayed revision of copyright laws for the digital era.
That has prevented manufacturers from distributing new digital
technologies, deepened the consumer electronics industry's current
sales slump, slowed the deployment of high-speed broadband Internet
access and halted the transition to digital TV, which is already
years behind schedule.</LD>
<TE>   Instead of suing to keep customers from "burning" CDs the way they
used to record cassette tapes, or instead of imprinting highly
restrictive and glitch-ridden anti-theft protection on every song or
movie scene, industry leaders should vigorously work with the
consumer electronics companies to develop ways to guarantee a fair
profit when people download and then copy or otherwise alter digital
content for personal use.</TE>
<TE>   One scheme, for example, would allow a record company to charge
for music in an all-you-can-eat bundle, much as AOL does for monthly
access to its content.</TE>
<TE>   In an opinion piece published last month in the online magazine
Salon, Paul Boutin, an editor at Wired magazine, accurately summed up
the challenge now facing entertainment companies: "Remove the
incentives for people to steal, rather than imposing more technology
that treats customers as would-be shoplifters.... Instead of telling
us not to steal, how about just giving us a way to pay?''</TE>
<TE>   There was a time when book publishers worried that Xerox copiers
could destroy their industry. And when television producers predicted
that videotape would chase off advertisers because time-shifters
could zap commercials. Now Chicken Little lives in the entertainment
industry. Copyrights are precious, but fighting last year's war won't
protect them.</TE>

<LD>The blame game has returned full-blown to Capitol Hill, and it's
dispiriting to see. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle kicked things
off Friday, declaring that President Bush's tax cut was responsible
for the current recession. Bush, he said, has created the "most
dramatic fiscal deterioration in our nation's history."</LD>
<LD>   The president, in California Saturday to appear at an Ontario
campaign rally, responded with equal ferocity, declaring that only
"over my dead body will they raise your taxes."</LD>
<LD>   Let's take a closer look at this rhetoric, within which hope of
passing a reasonable economic stimulus package is being burned to a
crisp. Daschle's charge is at least half-wrong. He also offers no way
to fix the situation. Bush alone can't be blamed for the recession,
though his insistence on sweeping cuts has worsened the nation's
fiscal health. And Daschle, after all the finger-pointing, never said
that the already-passed tax cuts should be delayed or repealed.
Either Democrats believe that the government needs more tax money or
they don't.</LD>
<TE>   As for the president, his preemptive refusal to reconsider any
part of his $1.35-trillion tax cut package is irresponsible, to say
nothing of his continued push for new or extended tax cuts for
wealthy families and big businesses. Before Sept. 11, he could
maintain that the budget surplus allowed the federal government to
carry out tax cuts. But now it's a different budgetary world. Sept.
11 hit an already faltering economy hard. Consumer confidence is
shaky, and the unemployment rate has risen to a seven-year high of
5.8%. On top of that are billions of dollars in new spending for
homeland defense.</TE>
<TE>   As Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who voted for the tax cut
package, has pointed out, the new situation means that the U.S. has
to reassess. The fact is that no country has cut taxes while it's
carrying out a war. The war on terrorism may differ from previous
conflicts, but it still is forcing the government to devote enormous
resources to the effort.</TE>
<TE>   The stimulus package, trapped in a partisan wrangle even before
the holidays, now looks like a sure sacrifice to this year's
congressional elections. Bush and congressional Republicans will keep
their version larded with goodies for big business, while the
Democrats will keep trying to expand health care benefits and
assistance to the jobless, without a way to pay for them. Some
old-fashioned assistance is necessary, but the Democrats should focus
more on forward-looking programs like training for high-tech jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The main problem remains that Bush stands by every penny of his
irresponsible tax cuts, while Daschle settles for blame without
solutions. It's always a chore for elected officials to get serious
about governing in an election year. But after voters saw the
bipartisan effort that went into new security measures and a
commendable education bill, it's exasperating to watch a return to
squabbling gridlock.</TE>

<LD>Telephone exhortations from President Bush and a personal visit by
British Prime Minister Tony Blair may have pushed India and Pakistan
a few inches back from the brink of war. But to reach a point where
anyone can breath easy, the two sides have to take the initiative
themselves. Pakistan has already made steps to meet Indian demands
that it rein in terrorists. Now it's up to India to respond, either
with a troop pullback or by agreeing to negotiations or, better yet,
both.</LD>
<LD>   The neighboring nations have fought three wars since both became
independent in 1947. Kashmir, the disputed territory occupied by both
countries, sparked two of those wars and again is the issue, after
last month's terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament building in
New Delhi that killed 14 people.</LD>
<LD>   India blamed the attack on two groups based in Pakistan that seek
independence for Indian-held Kashmir or annexation to Pakistan. The
government of Gen. Pervez Musharraf arrested the leaders of those
organizations and hundreds of their members, but India said the
arrests were not enough to warrant peace talks. The Indian prime
minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, missed a chance during a summit of
South Asian leaders last weekend in Nepal to have substantive talks
with Musharraf, settling instead for what Vajpayee termed a brief
"courtesy call."</LD>
<TE>   Vajpayee's brushoff ignores the tough domestic situation
confronting Musharraf, who seized power in a 1999 coup. Pakistan was
one of only three governments that recognized the Taliban, the
fundamentalist Afghan regime that had support among sectors of
Pakistan's intelligence agency, army and public.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, Musharraf shook up the army and intelligence corps
and moved to reduce the influence of Islamic extremists. But he must
move carefully. The murder last month of the brother of the Pakistani
official in charge of cracking down on extremists demonstrated the
danger faced by Musharraf and his supporters.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has telephoned Vajpayee and Musharraf to urge
restraint, and Blair made a similar plea in his visits to New Delhi
and Islamabad Sunday and Monday. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell
indicated last week that he might send an envoy to the region. He
should. A high-level delegation would emphasize the importance that
Washington attaches to peace between these nuclear-armed South Asia
neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Lal Krishna Advani, India's home minister, is due in Washington
today. Bush administration officials should remind him that although
both India and Pakistan insist they do not want to go to war, the
longer their troops are massed at the border, with missiles armed and
combat aircraft on alert, the greater the danger of a misread signal
or an error that will lead to all-out conflict.</TE>

<LD>Re "Airline Defends Banning Bush Guard From Flight," Jan. 4: An Arab
American Secret Service agent alleges bias when he attempted to board
a flight. Should individuals, even those in law enforcement, be
allowed to board an airplane with a firearm? My response is
unequivocally, no.</LD>
<LD>   The first and obvious problem, as noted by the pilot of the
American Airlines flight, is determining the validity of
identification. With the large number of police agencies and varying
identification documents, can we ask pressured airline security to
separate the real from the bogus? One must also consider the
possibility that a law enforcement officer may be suffering from drug
or alcohol abuse or mental illness. Do we want such a person to be
armed on an aircraft? I would worry that an officer might respond
inappropriately to a perceived threat. There is always the
possibility that potential terrorists or hijackers might become aware
that an officer is armed and might succeed in overpowering him.</LD>
<LD>   I would take no comfort knowing that the individual sitting next
to me is armed.</LD>

<TE>   I will not fly on any airliner on which the pilot does not have
the authority to say who gets on board. Of any airline, American
Airlines need look at only four months of history to realize that
outside checkpoints are not 100% reliable. If the pilot is
unreasonable in his decisions, charge him, sue him, discipline him
and have the comfort of knowing he will be alive to face the charges.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Bush Says He Won't Budge on Tax Cuts," Jan. 6: President Bush
vowed that his [10-year] $1.35-trillion tax cut would be repealed
only over his dead body. Instead of stimulating the economy, his tax
cut resulted in more massive layoffs and hard times for America's
poor, homeless and unemployed. The Republicans seem to have only one
solution for our economic woes--cut taxes for the rich and
corporations, increase military spending and spending for prisons and
the failed war on drugs, and when the inevitable deficit ensues,
balance the budget on the backs of the poor.</LD>
<LD>   Before we think about another massive tax cut we should ask
ourselves if that money couldn't be better spent on solar energy
research and development, better mass transit, more low-cost
affordable housing and some form of decent, affordable health care
for the medically indigent. The Republicans never met a tax cut they
didn't like or passed one that did an iota of good. The way they
serve and represent the rich and major corporations, you'd think they
were owned and controlled by them.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Jobless Rate Nears a 7-Year High; Political Debate Shifts,"
Jan. 5: Let me make sure I've got this right. Senate Majority Leader
Tom Daschle blames the current recession, which began in March, on
the policies of George Bush, who took office approximately 40 days
earlier on Jan. 20. Daschle says that the Bush tax cut is the primary
cause, even though Bush signed the bipartisan bill in June, three
months after the recession began. During 2001, the tax cut amounted
to a paltry $300 per individual taxpayer or $600 per married couple,
hardly enough to cause a recession.</TE>
<TE>   Americans need bipartisanship and straight talk from congressional
leaders. Daschle provides neither.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Times' Dec. 24 editorial embracing consumer appeals of health
plan decisions overlooks the serious implications of allowing a state
agency to rewrite health-care contracts. Blue Shield of California
established California's first voluntary external review process six
months before the state Independent Medical Review process was
created. The IMR process enables consumers to appeal a health plan's
decision only to determine whether a treatment is medically
necessary.</LD>
<LD>   In the case you cited, however, Blue Shield did not pay for the
weight-loss drug because it was not a covered benefit under the plan
chosen by the consumer. If the Department of Managed Health Care
forces health plans to pay for treatments that are expressly not
covered by their state-approved contracts, plans would be exposed to
unlimited financial risk for costly treatments that were never
considered in pricing the coverage. As a nonprofit health plan, Blue
Shield is obliged to challenge this decision to secure our ability to
pay the bills for 2 million members who need services that are
covered under their contracts.</LD>

<LD>According to "Pressure Is on Sharon to Negotiate" (news analysis,
Jan. 3), Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's goal is to be rid of
Yasser Arafat. It would be better for both Israel and Palestine to be
rid of Sharon. He is the most militant, arrogant head of a country
ever. I wonder, if people really knew how the Palestinians are
treated by the Israeli Defense Forces, if they would still defend
Israel. The IDF treats the Palestinians with contempt. My husband and
I have seen it over and over.</LD>
<LD>   Just as we condemn the suicide bombers, we also condemn the
Israelis' entrance into villages, where brutal killings of innocent
children and adults occur--under the direction of Sharon. Eighty
percent of those killed since the intifada began are Palestinians.
Over and over Israel has confiscated land from Palestinian owners to
build settlements for Jews, many from the U.S. We saw a beautiful
tree-covered hill above Bethlehem, and the next time we saw it, the
trees were stripped and cleared for a large settlement. We visited
bombed-out homes of peace-loving people where the shells were made in
the U.S. We Americans would never tolerate the arrogance that
Palestinians experience from the Israelis. Let us listen to their
cries.</LD>

<TE>   Your Jan. 3 editorial, "Crack of Light in the Mideast" and
front-page news analysis, read as if Sharon is the obstacle to peace
negotiations and Arafat is doing everything possible for peace.
Humbug! Sharon wants and needs peace, as do most rational people. But
a peace that is real. Not just the arrest of several lower-level
operatives but the confiscation of illegal weapons and the outlawing
of terrorist groups; the cessation of Arafat's promotion of a culture
of hatred and violence against not only Israelis (where is Israel on
Arab maps?) but all Jews--in his textbooks, media, speeches and
children's camps; of his refusal to arrest terrorists and to outlaw
terror groups; and of his refusal to accept the right of Jews to live
in all of the Palestine mandate (as Arabs have the right to live in
Israel).</TE>

<HD>Beach Access Debate Addresses Wrong Issues</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I think Steve Lopez ("A Walk on the Beach Is No Stroll in the Park,"
Jan. 4) and the public have this beach access story all mixed up. The
uproar in Malibu is not really about public access to a
five-foot-wide rocky beach, but about the steps that were taken to
make this "beach" a public access point in the first place.</LD>
<LD>   The California Coastal Commission is the only true dictatorship in
California. What it says goes, and it is as political an organization
as you can find in this state. Three individuals were able to
"donate" their way to concessions that are not available to common
taxpayers. Sure, it sounds better to write about rich Malibu-ites who
aren't that liberal, but the reality is that these small access
points aren't going to lead to hordes of umbrella carriers set up in
front of Haim Saban's house . . . or are they?</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I feel that your Dec. 30 article missed the real story potential
on the issue of beach access in Malibu. The article speaks about the
limited access onto Carbon Beach, a coastal stretch of Malibu;
however, it fails to address the fact that the public is unable to
park near any of the closed-off entrances onto the beach. The open
entrances are adjacent to large parking lots that allow people to
park and walk down the complete three-mile stretch of the beach with
no charge, unlike beaches such as Surfrider and Zuma that charge a
high fee for parking lot use.</TE>
<TE>   You briefly address Broad Beach, which people are truly unable to
use because the homeowners enforce their property rights to the mean
high tide line, unsurveyed since the 1920s. With an ever-changing
coastline, their ownership has prohibited many people from using the
nicest sections of this beach. These are the true abusers of the
access to the beach, not the Carbon Beach homeowners.</TE>
<TE>   Ashley Woods</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a former Malibu resident and a frequent visitor to Hawaii, I am
appalled that our public beaches remain inaccessible because of a
privileged few. In Hawaii all access ways are open and maintained for
public use. Even the hotel chains have public beaches with
lifeguards. California should not be an exception. God gave us the
Pacific for all to enjoy. You drive for miles without a glimpse of
the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Open your purses or wallets and give California taxpayers their
share. Or can excessive wealth, greed and power buy even the ocean?
Coastal Commission, do your job.</TE>

<HD>Kaiser Emergency Care Treats Patients Well</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Cases Reveal Lapses in Kaiser Emergency Care" (Jan. 2) describes
nine medical malpractice cases involving Kaiser Foundation Hospital
emergency rooms [decided] in the past seven years--nine cases among
more than 10 million patients treated. All of us at Kaiser Permanente
wish that number was zero. We acknowledge regretfully that errors in
medical judgment and in the delivery of care do sometimes occur. As
the Institute of Medicine's report on patient safety and medical
errors concluded, "to err is human." The challenge is to learn from
and prevent errors--and thus enhance the quality and service provided
to patients.</LD>
<LD>   Overall, we want to remind readers that the Kaiser Foundation
Health Plan continues to rank at the top or near the top of
independent surveys of quality medical care among health plans in
California. For example, just last fall the California Department of
Managed Health Care released its first-ever survey of the state's
HMOs. The Kaiser Foundation Health Plan in Southern California was
the only health plan to receive two-star ratings (good) in all five
of the department's categories. As a physician and medical director
of the Southern California Permanente Medical Group, I am proud to be
associated with the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan.</LD>

<HD>Thomas B. Silver, 54; Political Scholar</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thomas B. Silver, a scholar whose historical views guided his
extensive work in local government and on behalf of a Claremont
conservative think tank, died Dec. 26 at St. Jude's Hospital in
Fullerton. He was 54.</LD>
<LD>   Silver, a Fullerton resident, succumbed to an aggressive brain
tumor that had been diagnosed only a few days earlier.</LD>
<LD>   In a career that spanned academia and politics, Silver brought a
penetrating intellect and a modest, even-tempered demeanor to his
work, friends and colleagues said. He spent 16 years working for Los
Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, ultimately as chief of
staff, and was deeply involved in such issues as welfare reform and
developing mass-transit alternatives.</LD>
<TE>   "Tom was one of the most intellectual and down-to-earth
individuals I have known," Antonovich said. "He was a Renaissance
man. He was an author; he ran the marathon; he had an understanding
of finance, theology, political philosophy; and he was able to bring
people together and find solutions."</TE>
<TE>   Silver also served as an instructor at Harvey Mudd College in
Claremont in 1977, and as a consultant-panelist and outside reviewer
for the National Endowment for the Humanities in the early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   He was the author of a book, "Coolidge and the Historians" (1982),
which challenged the standard view of America's 30th president.
Silver argued that Calvin Coolidge was a great American statesman who
adhered to the essential principles of government laid out in the
Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution and stood firm
against a rising liberal tide.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of his death, Silver was working on a new book about
the Progressive movement and what he saw as its corrosive effects on
American politics and society.</TE>
<TE>   But it was perhaps in his long association with the Claremont
Institute, which he helped establish in 1979 and led as president for
the past year and a half, that Silver most continually engaged with
the issues dear to him. A center of passionate conservative
scholarship, the institute supports research, writing, publishing and
educational outreach on the moral and political principles embodied
in the Declaration and the Constitution. With an annual budget of $4
million, the nonprofit institute has made itself a valued resource
for conservative lawmakers in Sacramento and Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Larry P. Arnn, Silver's predecessor as the institute's president,
described Silver as "a quiet man, confident in his views, but capable
of fierce argument with people, always civil."</TE>
<TE>   In a Times story in March, Silver voiced the institute's mission.
"We want to overthrow the reigning orthodoxy," he said, "and we want
to, somewhere along the line, train a Franklin Roosevelt who will
then overthrow the New Deal."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Detroit and raised in Grand Rapids, Mich., Silver received
his bachelor's degree in political science from Kalamazoo College. He
studied at the Claremont Graduate School, where he earned a doctorate
in government. He is survived by his wife, Nancy, and two sons,
Arthur and Salvador Antonio.</TE>

<HD>Carl Wolz, 69; Founded World Dance Alliance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES DANCE CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carl Wolz, an influential choreographer, scholar, organizer and
advocate for dance, died Wednesday in New York City after a long
battle with cancer. He was 69.</LD>
<LD>   Although he choreographed more than 60 works and wrote respected
books and articles on Asian dance, Wolz is perhaps best known for
founding the organization that became the World Dance Alliance, and
serving as its president and then executive director from 1988 to his
death.</LD>
<LD>   Located at Wolz's home in New York City, the alliance represented
"the first effort to create networks of individuals and organizations
in the dance field across the world," said Judy Mitoma, director of
the Center for Intercultural Performance at UCLA, "and nobody was
more committed to this idea than Carl Wolz. He was a fantastic
administrator, always supporting dance throughout the world."</LD>
<TE>   Wolz was born in St. Louis, and after serving in the Navy during
the Korean War, majored in art history at the University of Chicago.
After dance studies there, he went to the Juilliard School in New
York and began dancing with the Lucas Hoving Company, a New York City
modern dance ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   In 1962, a fellowship allowed him to study Asian dance at the
University of Hawaii. After joining the faculty at the university, he
radically expanded the scope of its dance division, then taught in
Japan. In 1983, he became dean of dance at the Hong Kong Academy of
Performing Arts, serving there for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Under his administration, it hosted annual international festivals
involving dance academies, and from these grew the idea of a World
Dance Alliance, an expression of Wolz's "philosophy of using dance to
unify the human race," in the words of Bonnie Oda Homsey, a former
student of Wolz's and now the artistic director of the Los
Angeles-based American Repertory Dance Company.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, Wolz began a five-year professorship in the graduate
program of the Japan Women's College of Physical Education, after
which he returned to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   He received the Distinguished Alumni Award from the East West
Center in Honolulu in 1992; the Professional Achievement Award from
the University of Chicago in 1995; and an award for outstanding
leadership in dance research from the Congress on Research in Dance
in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his brother, Lee Wolz of Houston. A memorial
service in New York will be scheduled later this year. His family
requests that instead of flowers, donations be sent to the Carl Wolz
Fund at the Dance Notation Bureau, 151 W. 30th St., Suite 202, New
York, NY 10001.</TE>

<HD>Programs for Kids in Line for Fund Boost</HD>
<DH>Budget: Less than two months after halting expansion,
Davis will propose a major increase. Jobless benefits would be
widened too.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI and CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis will propose a significant state funding increase for
before- and after-school programs--less than two months after halting
a $30-million expansion of the programs.</LD>
<LD>   Although the freeze remains in effect, administration officials
said the governor's 2002-03 budget proposal this week will include
more money for the programs than trimmed out of the current spending
plan.</LD>
<LD>   "It's part of the governor's larger commitment to children," said
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio. "There will be a number of programs
specifically targeted at children that will be spared the budget
scalpel."</LD>
<TE>   The governor also is expected to announce today that he will seek
legislation making newly enhanced unemployment benefits retroactive
to Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   In November, Davis proposed delaying a $29.7-million expansion of
programs that offer tutoring services and recreational activities for
students before and after classes as part of a larger plan to knock
nearly $3 billion off an estimated $12-billion budget deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials said they did not expect schools would be
ready to use the money because the measure authorizing the expansion
did not take effect until this month, roughly halfway through the
school year.</TE>
<TE>   Assuming lawmakers approve the $29.7-million cut proposed by
Davis, California will spend $87 million on after-school programs in
the current fiscal year. The frozen spending included $14.85 million
for a new before-school program.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Tony Cardenas (D-Sylmar), who chairs the Assembly
Budget Committee and who wrote the measure enacting the $30-million
expansion, welcomed word of Davis' intention to restore the money in
2002-03.</TE>
<TE>   "Many latchkey children are left to fend for themselves and to get
themselves to school, but they don't," Cardenas said. "They wind up
getting involved in things they shouldn't be doing."</TE>
<TE>   The Davis announcement comes as actor Arnold Schwarzenegger is
proposing a ballot measure setting aside $550 million a year for
after-school programs.</TE>
<TE>   "Arnold would be thrilled" if Davis expanded the programs, said
George Gorton, campaign manager for the After School Education and
Safety Program Act of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "These programs bring some stability to these kids' lives," said
Wayne Johnson, president of the California Teachers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, organized labor's campaign to make newly increased
unemployment insurance benefits retroactive for California workers
who lost their jobs as a result of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks got
off to a muddled start.</TE>
<TE>   Top officials of the California Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO,
called a news conference to announce a bill that would make the
payments retroactive, but they refused to disclose the details of the
legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar), chairman of the Labor and
Industrial Relations Committee, who will introduce labor's bill, said
he was asked by the governor's office not to announce the bill's
contents.</TE>
<TE>   Alarcon said he complied because he was told Davis intends to
outline the proposal in his State of the State speech tonight. "I've
made a commitment to the governor that we'll allow him to make the
specific announcements," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The governor signed legislation last year that increased maximum
weekly unemployment payments from $230 in 2001 to $330 this year, and
to $450 by 2005. The new benefits will apply to jobless workers who
filed on Jan. 1 or later, but it did not apply to workers thrown out
of a job as a consequence of the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   When the new benefits law was signed Oct. 1, Davis and others
presumed that it would cover California's Sept. 11 jobless as well,
approximately 14,000 workers in the tourism industry, including
airline crews and hotel employees. It did not.</TE>

<HD>Dog-Mauling Survivor Says, 'I'm Sure They Were Going to
Kill Me'</HD>
<DH>Violence: Eleven of 13 animals in the pack have been
captured. The victim was saved by a passing motorist.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Using baited traps and nooses, animal control workers have captured
most of the feral dogs that mauled a jogger on a swath of desert in
Thousand Palms last week.</LD>
<LD>   As of Monday, Riverside County officials say, 11 of the reported
13 dogs in the pack were caught and are likely to be euthanized.</LD>
<LD>   Steve Jenkins, 48, of Pasadena remains in a Palm Springs hospital
after two surgeries.</LD>
<TE>   "They left me looking like a bloody piece of red meat," Jenkins, a
professional drummer, said Monday from his bed at Desert Regional
Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure they were going to kill me."</TE>
<TE>   He was saved by a motorist in an all-terrain vehicle who scared
the dogs away by honking his horn and shouting. The unidentified man
then called paramedics.</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Rivers, spokesman for the Riverside County Department of
Animal Services, said Monday that he is confident the entire pack
will be hunted down this week. "Traps are baited for the remaining
two," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The captured dogs--mutts and some mix-breed German shepherds--are
being quarantined for seven days to test for rabies. Rivers said they
will likely be euthanized soon after.</TE>
<TE>   Rivers said that attacks by packs are extremely rare and that this
was the first to take place in Riverside County in recent memory.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was just a combination of having a few aggressive
alpha dogs in the pack," Rivers said. "The rest are extremely
submissive, and submissive dogs can bite just as quickly because they
bite out of fear."</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins was in the desert area for a New Year's Eve gig in Rancho
Mirage with his band, Ronny and the Classics, a Vegas-style oldies
troupe.</TE>
<TE>   He suffered the pack attack on New Year's Day afternoon while
jogging solo along a road through salvage yards and sand mines, in an
area that residents say is a dumping ground for unwanted animals.</TE>
<TE>   Several miles from his hotel, Jenkins passed a sand mine where
dogs barked at him behind a fence.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't get too worried about it because I thought they were
contained by the fence," Jenkins recalled. "At first they looked like
normal dogs. It wasn't until later that I realized they were
vicious."</TE>
<TE>   One by one, the dogs squirreled under the fence to follow Jenkins.
"I wanted to stay cool and not run," he said. But the larger ones
began to nip at his heels and Jenkins was finally knocked to the
ground.</TE>
<TE>   For 10 to 15 minutes the dogs surrounded Jenkins, ripping flesh
until the motorist came to his aid.</TE>
<TE>   "Fortunately, the dogs didn't hit any arteries," Jenkins said.
"Doctors said that if they had, I might be dead."</TE>
<TE>   In the week since, Jenkins has undergone two sessions of surgery
for the wounds to his limbs and his abdomen.</TE>
<TE>   He said he is still afraid to look while doctors change his
bandages.</TE>
<TE>   He is expected to be released this week.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to recover. As a drummer, my body is my livelihood," said
Jenkins, who hopes he can locate and thank the good Samaritan who
rescued him. Authorities say they don't know the man's identity.</TE>
<TE>   Residents say dogs are frequently abandoned in the area and
sometimes are joined by runaways.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Jones, who owns the sand mine, said he has seen dogs thrown
out of windows of passing cars. He recalled discovering three of the
pack as puppies, starving in a cardboard box on the side of the road.</TE>
<TE>   Although he used to put out food and water for the emaciated
animals, he welcomes the crackdown.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had known what would happen, I wouldn't have fed the dogs. I
would have called animal control," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said they do not plan to hold Jones accountable for the
attack even though the pack lived mostly on his property.</TE>

<HD>Activists, U.S. Talking on Eve of Felony Trial</HD>
<DH>Legal: Greenpeace protest near Vandenberg in July resulted
in counts against 17. Lesser charges may resolve the case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eleventh-hour negotiations were underway Monday to settle the case
against 15 activists and two freelance journalists accused of
illegally entering a restricted military zone to protest an
antimissile defense test.</LD>
<LD>   The 17 are scheduled to go to trial today in Los Angeles on felony
charges connected with a Greenpeace protest in the Pacific Ocean off
Vandenberg Air Force Base in July.</LD>
<LD>   Some protesters paddled boats into the restricted zone offshore,
while others swam. Officials at the base said the test was delayed
only two minutes, but Greenpeace claimed that it was postponed by 40
minutes as the protesters were moved out of the missile's path.</LD>
<TE>   Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Los
Angeles, said the trial is still set to begin today. "But there are
ongoing settlement negotiations," he said, that could postpone or
conclude the case without a trial.</TE>
<TE>   Mrozek refused to describe the nature of the discussions. But
settlements in similar cases usually include a plea to a lesser
charge.</TE>
<TE>   The protesters and freelance journalists, from Germany, Australia,
Britain, India, Sweden and Canada, as well as the United States, face
felony charges of entering restricted waters.</TE>
<TE>   Though the maximum sentence on the charges is 11 years, nobody
expects any protester to face a sentence that long. Nonetheless, a
Greenpeace spokeswoman, Carol Gregory, has in the past accused the
government of filing unduly harsh charges, saying this shows a policy
change by the Bush administration to treat peaceful protesters much
more sternly than in the past.</TE>
<TE>   She was more circumspect Monday, declining to comment on the
government's motives.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. attorney's office has just given us a proposal," she
said. "We're discussing it right now."</TE>
<TE>   Government officials denied any policy shift has occurred. Mrozek
said recently that the conduct of the protesters was "very different"
from the behavior in previous demonstrations outside Vandenberg.</TE>
<TE>   Greenpeace organized the July demonstration to underscore its
opposition to the development of an antiballistic missile shield,
claiming that it could reignite an international arms race if other
nations try to build weapons that would counter it.</TE>
<TE>   The test fired an unarmed Minuteman II missile over the ocean,
where it was destroyed by an interceptor rocket launched from a
Pacific island.</TE>
<TE>   Vandenberg officials said the only disruption caused by the
protest occurred when two protesters jumped out of their small boats
and swam to shore on the base. When they emerged from the water, they
had hypothermia and had to be taken to a hospital by helicopter.</TE>

her boyfriend Saturday afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   It was the second such tragedy in a week in the San Joaquin
Valley. In Bakersfield, two children, 6 and 3, died in an apartment
fire on New Year's Eve after their mother allegedly left them home
alone while she went out with friends.</TE>

and Kings counties of poisonous irrigation runoff water, according to
federal documents.</LD>
<LD>   Draining the selenium-laden runoff from the San Joaquin Valley's
west side and completing the San Luis Drain could involve retiring
200,000 acres of farmland, treating water and dumping it in the delta

back from its worst slump in decades, according to a joint study
released Monday by three public policy groups.</LD>
<LD>   The region's economy will grow at a rate of 4.3% to 5.1% during
the next three to five years, based on projections from the Bay Area
Council, the Bay Area Economic Forum and the Assn. of Bay Area
Governments.</LD>
<LD>   The key to how fast the Bay Area bounces back will depend, in
part, on how long it takes the national economy to recover.</LD>

regional economy in the nation, and produces goods and services more

<LD>Bay Area rail and bus systems carry 1.3 million weekday passengers,
making them vital economic arteries--and an inviting target for
terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   "Terrorists clearly have identified public transportation ... as a
killing field," said Brian Michael Jenkins, a security expert who
co-wrote a new international study to glean the best counterterrorism
tactics from Bay Area, London and Tokyo transit systems.</LD>
<LD>   Issued by the Mineta Transportation Institute at San Jose State
University, the study praised BART's readiness for attacks but
criticized the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority's light
rail and bus lines for being "less concerned with the thought of a
terrorist threat than such issues as fare avoidance and graffiti."</LD>

<LD>Walt Disney Co. on Monday named a new president of entertainment for
its ABC television network and announced the resignation of veteran
executive Stu Bloomberg, underscoring the network's decline and its
need to reinvigorate programming.</LD>
<LD>   ABC named Susan Lyne, the network's well-regarded executive for
movies and miniseries, to head entertainment programming. Lyne will
assume many of Bloomberg's programming responsibilities. Stepping
down after a 22-year career at ABC, Bloomberg declined to comment.</LD>
<LD>   "A change is being made in the key creative role at the network,"
said Robert Iger, president of Walt Disney. "This is not about
placing blame. It's admitting the problems and figuring out the
solution and moving on."</LD>
<TE>   Just two seasons ago, ABC was the No. 1 network thanks in large
part to the hit game show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire." In its
zeal to capture the heat from the "Millionaire" phenomenon, Disney
and ABC executives decided to run the show four nights a week. When
the show unexpectedly ran out of gas, the ratings for the network
plummeted. In the last two years, ABC has fallen from No. 1 to No. 4
in the key 18-to-49-year-old demographic prized by advertisers.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of new hit shows as well as backup shows that could fill
the gap created by the failing "Millionaire" left ABC struggling to
fill its prime-time hours. Highly anticipated shows such as "Bob
Patterson," a sitcom starring "Seinfeld" alumnus Jason Alexander,
were instant failures, while ABC's long-running series--including
"Dharma and Greg" and "The Drew Carey Show"--started to lose their
audiences.</TE>
<TE>   The compounded effect has forced the network to provide
advertisers with free commercial time--known as make-goods--to make
up for the shortfall in the audience that they promised advertisers
last spring when they sold the bulk of their advertising time.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly the old direction wasn't working," said Larry Gerbrandt,
a senior analyst with Kagan World Media, a research company based in
Carmel. "I have a feeling [Bloomberg] is more the fall guy."</TE>
<TE>   Media analysts, Disney investors and Hollywood insiders agreed
that Bloomberg was only one member of a team of executives stretching
up through Iger and Disney Chief Executive Michael Eisner who made
the programming decisions. It's unlikely that a single management
change will be enough to cure the network's ills, several industry
sources said.</TE>
<TE>   To improve the network's performance, Iger, a former chairman of
ABC, said he and Eisner will become even more involved with
programming decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "We make no bones about being involved," Iger said. "Perhaps I
haven't been involved enough these past few years. I intend to devote
considerable time to helping [ABC Entertainment Chairman Lloyd Braun]
and Susan turn the network around."</TE>
<TE>   To do that, Iger said, it was necessary to replace the person most
responsible for making programming decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "The heart and soul of the prime-time schedule is the series. It
starts and stops at program development," Iger said. "Susan and I
have had long conversations. We'll try not to repeat the mistakes of
the past, some of which I made."</TE>
<TE>   Lyne, 51, is a relative newcomer to television, starting her
career as a journalist. The founder and former editor in chief of
Premiere: The Movie Magazine was also the managing editor of New
Times magazine and the Village Voice, where she edited stories that
won the Voice the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Reporting. She joined
Disney in 1996 as a creative executive in the feature film division
where she developed the Oscar-nominated film "The Insider." She
assumed the job of running ABC's movies and miniseries in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Despite her outsider status, Lyne won over much of the production
community with a series of successful projects including last
season's "Life With Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows" and the
Emmy-winning "Anne Frank." At a time when the other networks were
giving up on long-form television shows, ABC was scoring the highest
ratings for the category among adults 18 to 49 years old.</TE>
<TE>   "We're turning to a person with a proven track record who has a
great sense about her in terms of high-quality programming with mass
audience appeal," Iger said. "Those two things can be mutually
exclusive, but with Susan they aren't."</TE>
<TE>   Lyne fills a position that has been vacant since the exit of Jamie
Tarses in 1999, when Disney merged ABC with the studio's TV
production operation and tapped Bloomberg and Lloyd Braun as
co-chairmen of the entertainment television group. Lyne will report
to Braun, who will now be the sole chairman of the TV group.</TE>
<TE>   The management shakeup elevates Braun, a former entertainment
attorney who is known as a tough, bottom-line oriented negotiator.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the utmost confidence in Lloyd," Iger said. "He has an
incredibly important role, the point man on a lot of change we are
pushing," he said, noting that the network is advocating several
cost-cutting reforms including limiting the role of talent managers
in television production and reducing the fees paid to talent
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Lyne said ABC executives offered her the job last
week.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an opportunity and a challenge to be in charge of prime-time
programming," she said, noting that her approach will be to create a
mix of family programming, paying more attention to how ABC launches
and schedules new shows. "One of my priorities will be to try to
build a truly dominant night for ABC. The other networks have it and
we don't."</TE>
<TE>   Lyne, who is married with two teenage daughters, said she will
remain based in New York.</TE>
<TE>   According to talent agents and entertainment attorneys who work
with ABC, the problems at the network won't be easily fixed. Above
Lyne are several layers of corporate executives, making it difficult
to know who is really making the decisions. The fact that the
executive most closely associated with the creative decisions was
replaced--and the deal makers were not--signals that the corporate
executives will be calling the shots, half a dozen agents and lawyers
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg, 52, joined ABC in 1978 as a program executive and was
promoted in 1980 to vice president, variety series, specials and
late-night programming. His first major success was "That's
Incredible!" He was named vice president, comedy and variety series
development, at ABC Entertainment in 1982, then executive vice
president for prime time at ABC Entertainment in 1989. Bloomberg
helped oversee the creation of "Webster," "Who's the Boss?," "The
Wonder Years," "Roseanne," "Coach" and "Home Improvement." He was
named chairman of ABC's entertainment division in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his association with ABC, Bloomberg has been close with
his boss, Iger, sharing credit for turning the network around in 1990
with shows such as "Twin Peaks," "Thirtysomething" and "The Wonder
Years."</TE>

<HD>AOL Time Warner Lowers Forecast</HD>
<DH>Media: The company reveals a new strategy for estimating
earnings in 2002, promising not to set targets it can't meet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Unveiling a new management team and a new strategy for playing the
Wall Street expectations game, AOL Time Warner Inc. on Monday reduced
its forecast for 2002 cash-earnings growth and said that in the
future it will promise less and deliver more.</LD>
<LD>   AOL also said it will take a one-time, noncash charge of $40
billion to $60 billion in the first quarter to comply with new
accounting rules and draw on existing credit lines to pay Bertelsmann
$6.75 billion for the 49% of AOL Europe  it doesn't already own.</LD>
<LD>   The announcements came in a 90-minute conference call with Wall
Street analysts after the close of the stock market Monday. The
session served as a debut for Richard Parsons in his new role as
designated successor to Chief Executive Gerald Levin, who will retire
in May.</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps in a sign that the media giant already had begun more
skillfully guiding Wall Street, analysts last week began trimming
their revenue and earnings expectations.</TE>
<TE>   AOL shares gained 73 cents to $32.68 on the New York Stock
Exchange, which analysts said partly reflected relief that the
company would finance its AOL Europe purchase without having to issue
new stock and dilute the holdings of current shareholders. AOL shares
have fallen from a 52-week high of $58.41.</TE>
<TE>   Parsons told analysts that AOL will see growth of 5% to 8% in
revenue and 8% to 12% in earnings this year before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, the most commonly used
earnings measure.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, analysts had been expecting EBITDA growth of 15%
or more. One of Wall Street's most frequent criticisms of AOL has
been its propensity to fall short of management's ambitious revenue
and earnings targets.</TE>
<TE>   "We got no credit for our achievements [in 2001] because of the
high expectations we ourselves created," Parsons said. From now on,
he said, "we will try not to over-promise, and we will deliver."</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Scott Reamer at SG Cowen Securities said, "This is all
about resetting the bar, making sure that the new management team is
able to regain the Street's confidence."</TE>
<TE>   The noncash, first-quarter charge of up to $60 billion reflects
the sharp drop in value of the assets  AOL purchased when its
acquisition of Time Warner was completed early last year. Under new
accounting rules, AOL is required to reduce the amount of "goodwill"
on its books--the difference between the assets' purchase price and
their market value--to reflect that decline.</TE>
<TE>   The charge won't affect AOL's operations and will enable the
company to save $7 billion a year in noncash goodwill depreciation
costs, said Wayne Pace, AOL's new chief financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   Dragged down by a terrible advertising environment in the third
and fourth quarters, AOL said its full-year EBITDA for 2001 is
expected to come in at slightly below $10 billion, or 18% above the
2000 figure. Analysts had been expecting 20% growth. The official
earnings figures will be released Jan.30.</TE>
<TE>   In line with AOL's new conservatism on forecasts, Parsons said the
company's 2002 outlook anticipates no recovery in the U.S. economy
and no rebound in the advertising industry.</TE>
<TE>   AOL expects to achieve its earnings growth mainly from anticipated
gains in its subscriber base and its strong film division, Parsons
said.</TE>

<HD>Apple Unveils Its Redesigned iMac</HD>
<DH>Computers: The company hopes the desktop's innovative
design will help shore up its sagging market share.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Apple Computer Inc. unveiled a stylish new version of its iMac
desktop computer Monday, betting that flat-panel displays and a
complete redesign will shore up its sagging position in a market
dominated by PCs using Windows software from Microsoft Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs, whose biggest hit since
returning to the company was the original iMac released more than
three years ago, plans to target both iMac owners ready to upgrade to
a faster, better-looking system and new computer users.</LD>
<LD>   Apple followers said Jobs should have little problem with those
audiences and with workers in creative industries because the iMac
won't be extravagantly expensive, costing between $1,299 and $1,799.</LD>
<TE>   But the new design won't be enough to lure many Windows users
through the hassle of changing software and navigation habits,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very close to what I think a desktop computer should be,"
said analyst Rob Enderle of Giga Information Group. But unlike the
first colorful and rounded iMacs, the new machines "are evolutionary,
not revolutionary."</TE>
<TE>   Looking unlike anything on the market, the new iMacs have a
6-inch-high, off-white half-globe for a base that contains drives,
high-end G4 processor chips and speakers. An adjustable metallic
stalk connects the base to the 15-inch flat-panel screen, and the
keyboard and mouse connect to the back of the base.</TE>
<TE>   Some attendees at the MacWorld Expo convention that started Monday
in San Francisco compared the contraption to a table lamp. One said
it looked like a cosmetics case. And several said it reminded them of
the Cube, a sleek and expensive Mac that bombed after production
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller said the Cube flop taught the
company that consumers want flat-panel displays that come connected
to the rest of the computer.</TE>
<TE>   The new iMac had been expected months ago. Analysts said Apple had
been waiting for flat-panel prices to come down to the $400 or so
they cost computer makers now.</TE>
<TE>   Traditional PC customers can assemble flat-panel machines from
Dell Computer Corp., Gateway Inc. and others, with drives and other
machinery housed in a tower. The prices are similar, but the styling
is not.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the new iMac," said J.P. Morgan analyst Daniel Kunstler.
"It will bring in some new customers, but the question is how
quickly. It will be a bit more difficult this time around to bring
new converts."</TE>
<TE>   Apple's stock, which has gained 50% since Sept. 21, slipped 79
cents to $22.90 in Nasdaq trading.</TE>
<TE>   Innovation has kept Apple going, but it hasn't delivered hoped-for
growth against the Microsoft desktop monopoly in commodity PCs.
Apple's market share has fallen to under 5% in the last few years,
even as it introduced fresh and useful hardware and software.</TE>
<TE>   As computer shipments dropped throughout the industry, Apple
reported a loss of $25 million in its last fiscal year after three
years of profit. Sales shrank from $8 billion to $5.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "This might let them pick up 2% or 3% in market share, but going
past 8% is a tough challenge for Apple, even in the long term," said
consultant Tim Bajarin of Creative Strategies. "I don't care how cool
the box is, the ability to shift a huge amount of Windows users to
the Mac platform is just not a reality."</TE>
<TE>   Jobs said Apple has sold 6 million iMacs and 125,000 iPods, the
MP3 players it began shipping Nov. 10. The last of the three types of
new iMacs will begin shipping in March.</TE>

<HD>Argentine Move Hits Spanish Stocks</HD>
<DH>Currency: Foreign markets feel effect. Country's banks will
reopen Wednesday after a forced two-day closure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES</DL>
<LD>Spanish stocks dove in Monday trading as the market absorbed the
impact of the Argentine devaluation on multinational companies that
made billions of dollars in investments in Argentina during the
1990s, investments that have now lost value.</LD>
<LD>   This capital, which was racked by civil disturbances in December,
was calm Monday. Banks and exchange houses observed the first day of
a forced two-day holiday, with business set to open Wednesday when
pesos will start trading at 1.40 to the dollar. It will be the first
time since 1991 that the peso's official value has been weaker than
one dollar.</LD>
<LD>   Markets elsewhere were turbulent as the significance of the
devaluation sank in.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Spanish energy giant Repsol, which paid $15 billion for
Argentine oil giant YFP in 1999, lost nearly 8% on the Madrid bolsa
after the Argentine government said it would tax oil sales to create
a fund to help businesses withstand the devaluation. Spain's economy
minister complained about Argentina's economic plan before the
European Union in Brussels on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "If some of the conditions under which Argentinans and foreigners
have invested in your country must change, it should be done with the
consensus of those affected," said Spanish minister Rodrigo Rato.
Spanish banks alone are looking at losses of as much as $4 billion,
sources say.</TE>
<TE>   Spanish, U.S., French and other foreign investors poured more than
$35 billion into Argentina in the 1990s to acquire businesses
including water and electric utilities, banks and telephone
companies. Many were former state-owned utilities sold at auction
when they were privatized. Part of their lure was that customer
payments were indexed to the U.S. dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Now those investments have in one fell swoop been rendered less
valuable after Argentina announced Sunday it was devaluing the
currency by nearly 30%, abandoning the peso's 10-year link to the
dollar, and converting all dollar-denominated debts and contracts of
up to $100,000 to being payable in pesos.</TE>
<TE>   The country has also announced it is defaulting on the $135
billion it owes to foreign institutions and other creditors. The debt
grew as the government borrowed to pay for social services while the
economy went into recession and tax revenues dried up.</TE>
<TE>   The government is converting the denomination of loans and other
obligations from dollars to pesos to ease the pain to the middle
class of the peso's loss in value. The government at the same time
has promised dollar depositors whose accounts are now frozen they
will recover all their funds.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, banks' loan assets have been devalued, but their dollar
liabilities in deposits remain dollarized, creating a "balance-sheet
problem," said SCH economist Omar Borla in New York. The many
Argentine corporations that have borrowed dollars abroad are also in
a vise: the devaluation makes servicing that debt more expensive.</TE>
<TE>   The predicament caused shares of Spanish banks Santander Central
Hispano and Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, which between them control
roughly 20% of the Argentine banking system, to fall 4.4% and 3.3%,
respectively, Monday on the Madrid bolsa.</TE>
<TE>   The Spanish market overall fell 3.4%, as measured by the IBEX
index. Among Latin American markets, Brazil's main share index inched
up 0.3% Monday, while Mexico's eased 0.7%.</TE>
<TE>   Although generally positive about Argentina's decision announced
Sunday to bite the bullet and devalue, economists expressed
disappointment that President Eduardo Duhalde's economic plan
unveiled Sunday night wasn't comprehensive enough. He still has not
released details of his new currency policy, nor has he presented a
2002 budget, they complained.</TE>
<TE>   Others such as Gustavo Canonero of Deutsche Bank in Buenos Aires
had hoped that the Agentines would announce Sunday some sort of
tentative aid agreement with the International Monetary Fund. "It
delays the benefit of what they are trying to do," said Canonero.</TE>
<TE>   Although the government said it will print more money to add
liquidity to the parched money supply, the government hasn't yet said
how much. Printing too much money can stoke inflation fires, so
analysts are keen to know how much new currency will be printed. That
question mark, plus the uncertainty surrounding the 2002 federal
budget, which Economy Minister Jorge Remes Lenicov said Sunday would
be balanced, makes economists uneasy.</TE>
<TE>   "The measures are quite vague," said Bruno Boccara, director of
Latin American debt ratings at Standard &amp; Poor's in New York. "Until
you present a coherent strategy in this situation, confidence will
remain a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Argentina devalued Sunday because of three critical problems: a
crushing debt load, a growing economic depression and an overvalued
currency that made Argentine goods uncompetitive in domestic and
foreign markets.</TE>
<TE>   President Duhalde assumed power Jan. 2 after civil disturbances
caused the resignations of two previous presidents, Fernando de la
Rua and Adolfo Rodriguez Saa, over the previous two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Although the default will ease the government's fiscal deficit by
eliminating the need to make $7.5 billion in annual interest
payments, Deutsche Bank's Canonero said it will compound its problems
in the sense Argentina will find it impossible to attract foreign
investment or loans, which stimulate growth.</TE>
<TE>   Duhalde also needs to impose structural reforms that De la Rua and
his predecessors left undone, including the habit of Argentina's
provinces of spending more money than they take in taxes</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal, Europe's largest media firm, said it would raise
about 3.3 billion euros, or $3billion, by selling company-held shares
to trim debt and protect its investment-grade credit rating.</LD>
<LD>   The company is offering 55 million shares at 60 to 61 euros, below
Friday's closing price of 62.5 euros. The price is as much as 7%
above what Vivendi said it paid to buy back the stake last year.</LD>
<LD>   Vivendi Universal is paying off some of the 8.6 billion euros in
debt amassed in buying Seagram Co. and Canal Plus in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Vivendi's U.S.-traded shares fell $3.40 to $52.90 on the New York

<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the five largest record companies, BMG, is set to announce its
first licensing deal with an on-demand online music service it
doesn't own.</LD>
<LD>   The deal, which is expected to be announced today, lets San
Francisco-based Listen.com add music from BMG artists to its Rhapsody
jukebox service. Financial terms were not released.</LD>
<LD>   Listen.com is expected to announce a similar deal with EMI Group's
EMI Recorded Music, which has licensed its catalog to numerous online
services.</LD>
<TE>   Previously, the only service that offered consumers on-demand
access to BMG songs online was MusicNet, a distributor jointly owned
by BMG's parent company, Bertelsmann. All five major labels were
early investors in Listen.com, but none holds a significant stake in
the company.</TE>
<TE>   Subscribers to Rhapsody pay upward of $4.95 a month for access to
the online jukebox, allowing them to play unlimited songs but not
download or copy them.</TE>

<HD>DirectTV Chief Walks Fine Line as Sale Looms</HD>
<DH>Television: Roxanne Austin has turned the company around in
just a few months. She may soon need a job.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Roxanne Austin was promoted to president of DirecTV in June, the
nation's leading satellite television provider was in a bad slump.
Costs had rocketed, the company's growth rate was slowing, and shares
of DirecTV's parent, Hughes Electronics Corp., had dropped to new
lows.</LD>
<LD>   Austin made quick and sweeping changes, ranging from using
in-house sales teams for the first time to requiring customers to
sign up for a year's worth of DirecTV service. The moves earned her
the nickname "Hurricane Roxanne" within the ranks of the El
Segundo-based company.</LD>
<LD>   "We had to change, and we had to change fast," said Austin, 41,
who was plucked from her job as chief financial officer of Hughes to
turn around DirecTV. "DirecTV is one of the most successful start-ups
of all time. But what worked in the first few years was not going to
make us successful going forward."</LD>
<TE>   Yet even as DirecTV announces today its second consecutive quarter
of financial improvements, including adding 405,000 subscribers, the
overshadowing question is whether Austin can keep up the momentum
amid the pending $30-billion sale of Hughes to rival EchoStar
Communications Corp.</TE>
<TE>   In October, General Motors Corp. agreed to sell its controlling
interest in the company to EchoStar, bringing to a close a yearlong
takeover battle that proved a distraction for Hughes' top management
and was a factor in DirecTV's slide.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes shares gained 44 cents on Monday to close at $16.70 on the
New York Stock Exchange. EchoStar rose 33 cents to $28.92 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The EchoStar deal makes Austin's job particularly challenging
because it could ultimately cost thousands of jobs at DirecTV if
approved, or lead to turmoil if it is scuttled by federal regulators
and the company has to go it alone.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a real strange Alice-in-Wonderland time at DirecTV," said
Jimmy Schaeffler of Carmel Group, which tracks the satellite
industry. "Roxanne has to make her new bosses at EchoStar happy, all
the while wondering whether she should be looking for another job and
knowing the deal is not a slam dunk with regulators in Washington."</TE>
<TE>   Austin has restored some faith on Wall Street that the company is
back on track. DirecTV's 10.7 million U.S. customers make it the
country's third-largest pay television provider, after AT&amp;T Broadband
and Time Warner Cable.</TE>
<TE>   "So far, she has proven that DirecTV can stand on its own," said
Vijay Jayant, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. DirecTV "has got to work
as if there is a deal, but ... disprove sentiment that EchoStar wins
either way by weakening the competition in the event that the deal is
not approved."</TE>
<TE>   The deal faces serious scrutiny by the Justice Department because
EchoStar is DirecTV's only satellite competitor in the U.S. Together,
the two companies would serve more than 17 million households--one in
every five pay television homes.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar is expected to downsize the combined company
considerably.</TE>
<TE>   Although DirecTV has about 3,000 employees worldwide, perhaps the
most vulnerable are the 1,200 in El Segundo. EchoStar's home base in
Littleton, Colo., will be the headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar Chief Executive Charles Ergen is known for an
entrepreneurial zeal and lean operating style that contrasts with
DirecTV's more bureaucratic culture. While DirecTV employs droves of
corporate lawyers, EchoStar has just a few. Ergen is also famous for
making employees share hotel rooms when they travel.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said Austin was a fervent backer of the EchoStar deal,
believing that the cost savings to Hughes shareholders outweighed the
regulatory hurdles.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent interview, Austin refused to discuss the merger, but
acknowledged the management challenges it presents. "You're always
going to have anxiety in a merger," Austin said. "We have one job
we're focused on every day whether the merger goes through in nine to
12 months or not. That is to make DirecTV better."</TE>
<TE>   Before joining Hughes, Austin was a partner at Deloitte &amp; Touche
and a specialist in aerospace and defense and in mergers and
acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   While there, Austin, a native of Calico Rock, Ark., decided she
would rather run a business than be a consultant.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to be the decision maker," Austin said.</TE>
<TE>   Described by colleagues as determined and outspoken, Austin joined
Hughes in 1993, assuming the titles of treasurer, chief accounting
officer and controller before rising to CFO in 1997. Austin was
involved in several mergers that helped reshape Hughes from a defense
contractor into a satellite service provider.</TE>
<TE>   Her first shot at running DirecTV came in 2000, when Hughes
Chairman Michael Smith decided to bring in a president to free CEO
Eddy Hartenstein from daily operating duties.</TE>
<TE>   Hartenstein backed Austin for the job, but sources say he was
overruled by Smith, who favored veteran telecommunications executive
Odie Donald.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts say Donald could not navigate the complicated
politics of the organization or the mounting troubles at DirecTV. One
problem was a high churn rate because subscribers were canceling
service after becoming dissatisfied with DirecTV's spotty
installation service and consumer help lines. And TV piracy was
soaring, with DirecTV losing $150 million to theft of its signals in
the second quarter of last year.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, DirecTV spent $575 to generate each new account in
the second quarter, compared with EchoStar's $513.</TE>
<TE>   "Odie wasn't the right match for the job," Schaeffler said.
"Roxanne is a dynamo. She brings an unusual understanding of the
Hughes and the GM cultures and is well-respected in the ranks because
of her knowledge and experience."</TE>
<TE>   O'Donnell was swept out just months after Smith in a management
restructuring last summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Things were somewhat dysfunctional because of what was going on
at the top of the organization," said Austin, referring to her
predecessor's tenure, calling her own appointment a "whirlwind of a
week."</TE>
<TE>   On vacation, she drafted a lengthy handwritten blueprint for
DirecTV's turnaround that is now known within the company as
"Roxanne's Hawaii Manifesto."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the initiatives are well underway. To reduce commissions
and subsidies, Austin renegotiated contracts with distributors and
manufacturers of the dishes and set-top boxes.</TE>
<TE>   Austin also reduced the work force by 10%, the first layoffs in
DirecTV's seven-year history.</TE>
<TE>   Customer policies are also friendlier. DirecTV no longer charges a
fee for downgrading to a cheaper package of channels. Customers who
don't want to purchase a dish and set-top box can now lease the
equipment--a practice that has contributed to EchoStar's growth.</TE>
<TE>   Rewards came almost immediately, as churn rates and costs
declined.</TE>
<TE>   The company will announce today that it will begin delivering
local channels in 10 additional cities this year, bringing to 51 the
number of markets where it delivers local broadcast signals.</TE>
<TE>   "These [local channels] are key to our growth in 2002," Austin
said.</TE>
<TE>   So too, she said, is high-definition television channels that will
distinguish DirecTV from cable. DirecTV will offer exclusive 24-hour
coverage of the Winter Olympics in HDTV.</TE>
<TE>   "We've only scratched the surface," Austin said. "We still have
improvements to make, but we're heading in the right direction."</TE>

<HD>Location Shooting Flat in 2001</HD>

<LD>Filming of movies, TV shows, commercials and music videos on the
streets of Los Angeles was flat in 2001. The torrid pace of the first
half of the year was followed by a lull in the second, influenced by
Hollywood labor negotiations.</LD>
<LD>   According to permit figures released Monday by the Entertainment
Industry Development Corp., the number of days spent shooting
projects outside  studio lots totaled 27,435 in 2001, down less than
1% from 2000.</LD>
<LD>   EIDC spokesman Morrie Goldman said it is difficult to draw
conclusions from the numbers because so many extraordinary
developments occurred last year.</LD>
<TE>   Production was accelerated in the first half of the year as a
hedge against possible strikes by actors and writers, then slowed
after settlements were reached because studios had stockpiled
projects.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, production was affected by the recession, studio cost
cutting and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "It was such an unusual year. I don't think there's anything we
can say about 2001 other than we're glad it's 2002," Goldman said.</TE>
<TE>   Also making it difficult to compare last year's figures to 2000's
was the six-month strike that year by actors against advertisers.</TE>
<TE>   The EIDC numbers represent  days of shooting  in Los Angeles. They
do not include shooting on studio lots, but nonetheless are a
barometer of overall entertainment activity.</TE>
<TE>   Film permits issued fell 1%, while TV permits dropped 2%.
Commercials were up 13%, in part because the numbers in 2000 were off
because of the actors' strike. Shooting of music videos dropped 21%.</TE>

<HD>Ford Expected to Announce Restructuring</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co. is expected to announce Friday a sweeping
restructuring plan to shed costs, production capacity and as many as
20,000 workers amid its first year of losses in nearly a decade.</LD>
<LD>   The plan comes after a wrenching year at the world's
second-largest auto maker, which has been dogged by red ink,
shrinking market share, the Firestone tire recall and the ouster of
its chief executive.</LD>
<LD>   Ford officials have been tight-lipped about the details of the
plan, to be announced after it is approved at a board meeting this
week. Industry analysts have said Ford needs to eliminate 20,000
jobs, and even Ford's top executives say the auto maker must reduce
its production capacity.</LD>
<TE>   "I think you have to right-size. You have to evaluate what
capacity you need going forward," Chief Operating Officer Nick
Scheele told reporters Monday at the North American International
Auto Show in Detroit. "There's no magic about it. You've got to be
capacitized to what you're going to sell."</TE>
<TE>   Ford has the capacity to build 5.7 million units a year in the
U.S., even without going to a third shift, Scheele said. "I can't
remember when we sold 5.7 million units, ever," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ford's U.S. sales fell 5.5% last year to 3.96 million, down from
4.19 million in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The auto maker lost $1.4 billion in the second and third quarters
of 2001, and is expected to have a loss of about $2 billion for the
year, largely due to the $3-billion pretax charge it took in the
second quarter to replace potentially defective tires.</TE>
<TE>   Ford cut 5,000 salaried jobs through voluntary early retirements
last summer, eliminated bonuses to managers and has suspended
matching payments for employees' 401(k) retirement plans.</TE>
<TE>   But executives say they need to undertake more fundamental
reforms. "We don't come at this from the perspective of what will
sound good on Wall Street. We say, what are we going to do for the
long run that will make the company healthy, and what will be good
for us going forward to our second century," Scheele said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got the opportunity here to put in place something that
will be sustained for a considerable period in the future," he said.
"We want enduring profitability."</TE>
<TE>   Ford executives have not said whether they will close plants or
reduce shifts to reduce capacity, but Scheele said Monday that union
contracts would keep Ford from shutting any plants in North America.</TE>
<TE>   David Littmann, chief economist for Comerica Bank, estimated that
Ford will need to cut 7% to 12% of its work force. "In Ford's
case--in terms of actual, hard-nosed job cuts, I'm talking 12,700 to
14,000," Littmann said.</TE>
<TE>   But Kevin Tynan, auto analyst with Argus Research in New York,
said Ford is facing a dire situation. "It should be relatively
dramatic, and I would say if I had to ballpark on the high end, I'd
say 20,000" job cuts, Tynan said. "I think 15,000 to 20,000 is where
it should be."</TE>
<TE>   The new chief executive, 44-year-old William Clay Ford Jr., Henry
Ford's great-grandson, took over in October after firing Ford's
feisty and ambitious chief executive, Jacques Nasser, who was
criticized for his grand plans to make Ford a sprawling consumer
services company.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, we are in the middle of a painful but necessary
transformation of our company," Ford told some 2,000 employees Sunday
night at a raucous introduction of the Ford GT40, a concept
super-car.</TE>
<TE>   "We've made some progress already, but we're not finished. We'll
be making more announcements later this week," Ford said. "We thank
you for your hard work and dedication--and ask you to hang in there
with us as we repolish the oval and get it shining brightly again."</TE>
<TE>   Ford shares fell 44 cents to close at $16.50 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Ford is not the only domestic auto maker planning cost-cutting
moves.</TE>
<TE>   General Motors Corp. is expected to announce Thursday an
early-retirement offer for thousands of salaried employees in order
to eliminate more jobs and prepare for its toughest sales year in a
decade.</TE>
<TE>   GM will offer select groups of white-collar employees, age 50
years and older, an early-retirement package effective April 1 as
part of efforts to cut its 360,000 global work force through
attrition, buyouts and reducing contract employees.</TE>
<TE>   The new offer is similar to a package announced in December 2000
aimed at cutting salaried and contract jobs by 10%, Chief Financial
Officer John Devine told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, BMW Group said it sold a record 213,127 vehicles in
the U.S. market last year, a 12.5% increase. BMW now is the No. 2
premium brand in the country, after Toyota's Lexus division.</TE>
<TE>   Among small luxury importers, Rolls-Royce and Bentley Motor Cars
Inc. said combined sales of Bentley and Rolls-Royce models declined
6.7%, although Bentley brand cars grew 6%. Other auto makers reported
their U.S. sales results last week.</TE>

<HD>Homestore Recasts Management Team</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Resignation of CEO Wolff follows recently
announced accounting review.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE WEDNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Homestore.com Inc. Chairman and Chief Executive Stuart Wolff has
resigned, less than one week after the largest Internet lister of
homes for sale announced it had overstated revenue by as much as $95
million in the first nine months of 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Wolff left to pursue a new technology venture, the company
announced Monday. A new slate of officers has taken control of the
4-year-old Westlake Village business, which is reeling from a series
of setbacks. Most recently, the company came under fire for using its
own stock to pay operating expenses.</LD>
<LD>   Also Monday, trading in the company's stock resumed after being
suspended since Dec. 21. The shares plunged as low as $1.24 but
closed at $2.46, down $1.14, or 32%, on Nasdaq. The stock's 52-week
closing low of $2.28 was reached in early November.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts lauded the restructuring of Homestore.com's top
management, but they expressed skepticism about the long-term
prospects for the company, which until recently consistently
outperformed industry expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "Their success will depend on maintaining their present brand and
on how well they keep this management team together," said Kim
Pillon, an analyst at Nielsen/NetRatings, an audience measurement
service for the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   The Internet real estate listing company, whose Web sites include
Realtor.com, Homebuilder.com and Homestore.com, named board member
Joe Hanauer as chairman and W. Michael Long, the former chairman of
WebMD Inc., as chief executive, said Homestore spokesman Gary
Gerdemann.</TE>
<TE>   Jack D. Dennison, also formerly with WebMD, was named chief
operating officer, and Lewis R. Belote III will serve as chief
financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   Company executives expressed confidence that they can regain
credibility.</TE>
<TE>   "There is skepticism out there, and I believe it's justified,"
Long said. "When we can demonstrate we can relate well to our
customers, the confidence in our investors will return."</TE>
<TE>   The company is focusing on improving customer service, living
within its means and retaining its employees, Long said. In October,
the company slashed 700 jobs, about 20% of its work force.</TE>
<TE>   The company's troubles began months before the layoffs. In July,
the Justice Department ended a probe into possible anti-competitive
business practices by Homestore.com without taking action. The
agency's antitrust unit had been investigating the company's business
strategy, which includes exclusive contracts with many of the
country's largest residential property listing services.</TE>
<TE>   In dual setbacks last month, Homestore disclosed that its board
was investigating the company's books and that Chief Financial
Officer Joseph Shew had resigned because of personal reasons after
less than a year in the position.</TE>
<TE>   Three employees in Homestore.com's finance and business
development departments have been placed on administrative leave.</TE>
<TE>   The company said last week that the $351 million in revenue it
reported for the nine months ending Sept. 30 was $54 million to $95
million too high. An internal audit revealed that millions of dollars
in online advertising transactions had been incorrectly reported as
revenue. The transactions should have been accounted for as barter
deals related to purchases of goods and services from third parties.</TE>
<TE>   Trading in Homestore shares--priced at $80 two years ago--was
halted last month after the company said it was investigating its
accounting procedures. The company said Monday that it provided
"additional information" to Nasdaq, and market officials allowed
trading to resume at midday.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore shares fell 80% in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore.com was established more than four years ago and quickly
secured more than 95% of the nation's home listings, about 1.5
million entries. Its strength grew out of its relationship with the
National Assn. of Realtors, the industry's largest trade group. The
company's empire includes Web sites that provide listings for new and
existing homes and apartments, as well as remodeling, financial and
relocation information.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore's sites are among the most popular on the Internet,
ranking 21st among all Internet destinations, according to
Nielsen/Net- Ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Although the company's main business "appears sound," the
restructuring "may cause the company to bleed more cash than
anticipated," said Mark Rowen, a Prudential Financial analyst, in a
research report last week.</TE>

<HD>Firm to Help Hire Air Security Chiefs</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Department of Transportation has retained Korn/Ferry
International, the largest executive search firm, to help hire
security chiefs for the nation's 81 busiest airports, the Los
Angeles-based firm  said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The security directors will oversee all aspects of airport safety,
including passenger, baggage and cargo screening, and will report to
the Transportation Security Administration, an agency created in
response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Korn/Ferry would not disclose the value of the contract, and a DOT
official declined to comment, saying details were still being worked
out.</LD>
<TE>   The first phase of the assignment is culling candidates for the
nation's top airports. Later this year, Korn/Ferry will help recruit
security directors for the balance of the nation's 429 airports. The
new administration is expected to employ more than 30,000 people,
most of them at the airports.</TE>
<TE>   Airport security, which had been contracted to private vendors,
was sharply criticized after terrorists managed to board airliners
and crash them into the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Korn/Ferry shares rose 16 cents to $11.16 on the New York Stock
Exchange on Monday.</TE>

<HD>Legoland to Curtail Schedule, Cut Staff</HD>
<DH>Leisure: The economy and attendance slump have prompted
the park to close on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE HARRIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citing an uncertain economy and a drop in attendance since Sept. 11,
Legoland California said Monday that it will close its gates on
Tuesdays and Wednesdays until the summer.</LD>
<LD>   The cutback at the Carlsbad park will cost 30 of the 400 regular
employees their jobs. The move comes after Legoland and other theme
parks concluded an unexpectedly strong holiday season, fueled by
heavy discounting and an improvement in consumer confidence.</LD>
<LD>   Legoland officials have said the last two weeks of December were
the busiest of the year.</LD>
<TE>   Even so, Legoland's overall attendance last year was about 1.4
million, or 6% less than in 2000, said the park's president, Bill
Haviluk. Before tourism declined as a result of the terrorist
attacks, he said, the park was on track to meet or exceed attendance
from the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   Attendance has slumped at most theme parks. So far, Legoland is
the only park in the area to cut days out of its operating schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "We really had to evaluate our operational efficiencies after
[Sept. 11] and it became quite hard to justify 365 days," Haviluk
said. "Besides the regular travel and tourism crisis concerns, we
have another issue at Legoland and that is our market. It's kids 12
and under, and when the kids are in school, they're not here."</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear whether the five-day schedule during the off-season
would be permanent, but Haviluk said he expected it to remain in
place at least  a year or two. The new schedule takes effect Jan. 15.</TE>
<TE>   Since the 128-acre park opened in spring 1999, Haviluk said,
Tuesdays and Wednesdays consistently have been the slowest days of
the week--with fewer than 1,000 visitors. By closing  on those days,
Haviluk estimates, the park will save 12% to 15% in operating costs.</TE>
<TE>   The move didn't surprise industry watchers, who said Legoland,
owned by Lego Co. based in Billund, Denmark, had been the smallest
park in the country to keep a year-round operating schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a slow time anyway for theme parks," said Tim O'Brien,
senior editor of Amusement Business, an industry publication. "I
think if we saw them cutting days in the summertime, we'd know they
were in trouble," he said. "But they're not doing that. They're
basically closing 18% of the year and saving 15% as a result. Not a
bad deal."</TE>
<TE>   Most regional parks either shut down in the off-season or stay
open only on the weekends. Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia is
closed on most weekdays from Labor Day through Memorial Day.
Universal Studios and Disneyland remain open year-round but cut back
hours during the slow season.</TE>
<TE>   Some parks, such as Disney's California Adventure, restrict
certain attractions as part of the seasonal scaling back. One section
of DCA, the Hollywood Backlot, currently opens at least 90 minutes
after the main park opens.</TE>
<TE>   But Legoland's Haviluk said he didn't want to shut down
attractions for the sake of staying open all year. "We didn't want
people to come to Legoland and not get to see all of Legoland," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Haviluk said he does not expect to lose visitors as a result of
the scaled-back schedule. The Legoland park in England experimented
with the five-day schedule without an effect on attendance, he said.
Neither that park nor the third Legoland, in Denmark, is open
year-round.</TE>

<HD>Lucent Names Russo as CEO</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Struggling company turns to a former executive to
continue its radical restructuring plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Troubled Lucent Technologies Inc. on Monday named telecommunications
veteran and current Eastman Kodak Co. President Patricia Russo as its
chief executive, ending a management search that dragged on for more
than a year.</LD>
<LD>   Russo, 49, spent nearly 20 years at AT&amp;T Corp. and its Lucent
spinoff before leaving in August 2000. In April, she became president
and chief operating officer of Kodak, where she has led a campaign to
revive  sales and refocus the Rochester, N.Y.-based film maker.</LD>
<LD>   Russo's appointment as Lucent CEO makes her one of the few women
running a major U.S. corporation. It is a select group that includes
Carly Fiorina, another former Lucent executive and now chief
executive of Hewlett-Packard Co.</LD>
<TE>   Russo will replace Henry Schacht, who rejoined Lucent for a second
stint as chief executive  in October 2000 after the abrupt departure
of CEO Richard McGinn.</TE>
<TE>   McGinn's dismissal came amid a growing financial mess at the
Murray Hill, N.J.-based telecommunications equipment firm. As rumors
of bankruptcy swirled around the company, Schacht embarked on a
radical restructuring plan, slashing Lucent's work force in half and
selling off business units to stabilize the company's finances.</TE>
<TE>   The company posted a net loss of $16.2 billion for  its fiscal
year ended Sept. 30. Last month, Lucent warned that it would book a
larger-than-expected loss in  its fiscal first quarter because of the
retrenchment in equipment purchases among Lucent customers.</TE>
<TE>   Some investors had hoped the company would name an outsider to the
post, and the market's reaction to Russo's appointment, which was
announced early in the day, was less than enthusiastic. Lucent shares
fell 15 cents to $6.95 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   But Schacht called Russo a "great choice" for Lucent.</TE>
<TE>   "We were looking for a seasoned and proven leader, a CEO or COO of
a major company ... and hopefully, someone that knew us," he said.
"Pat clearly met all of the criteria."</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "She makes a good fit because she knows the company, she knows the
industry and more important, she already has relationships with the
company's key customers," said Dave Powers, a telecommunications
analyst at Edward Jones.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, Powers said, "the new strategic vision has already
been set, and bringing in someone from the outside at this point
would be more disruptive than carrying out the existing plan."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Christian, who has worked with Russo several times over the
years through his executive search firm, described her as "intense,
but with a sense of humor."</TE>
<TE>   He added that Russo might have been tainted somewhat because she
was at Lucent when it began to falter, "but the fact that she's being
brought back certainly clears the air completely, and shows the
board's belief that the problems were not of her making."</TE>
<TE>   Russo will inherit a  much smaller Lucent, with traumatized
employees and little hope of a sales rebound any time soon.</TE>
<TE>   She acknowledged that Lucent "has been through some difficult
times," but said she believes in the course laid out by Schacht,
calling it "a solid and credible plan."</TE>
<TE>   Under that plan, Lucent will focus on its core business of selling
network gear to large telephone companies, such as SBC Communications
Inc., Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&amp;T--the business Russo once
led.</TE>

<HD>3-Day Rally Ends on Earnings Worries</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: A Federal Reserve bank president says there's
room to cut rates further. The Dow falls 62.69 points.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks slipped Monday as the three-day New Year rally fizzled and
nagging worries about falling earnings overshadowed upbeat forecasts
from Compaq Computer and Circuit City Stores.</LD>
<LD>   "The market had a very powerful move in the first three days of
the year," said Robert Stovall, analyst at Prudential Securities.
"The enthusiasm of last week can't continue." The Dow Jones
industrial average rose 2.4% in the year's first three trading
sessions, while the tech-laden Nasdaq composite index gained 5.6%.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow dropped 62.69 points Monday, or 0.6%, to 10,197.05, while
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index eased 7.62 points, or 0.7%, to
1,164.89. Nasdaq fell 22.28 points, or 1.1%, to 2,037.10.</LD>
<TE>   Losers led gainers by 17 to 15 on the New York Stock Exchange and
by 20 to 17 on Nasdaq. Trading was active.</TE>
<TE>   In economic news, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta president,
Jack Guynn, said a rebound in economic growth might not arrive for
six more months, in contrast to more optimistic private economists
who say a recovery is already under way.</TE>
<TE>   But Guynn also said the Federal Reserve--even after 11 interest
rate cuts last year--has room to reduce rates further. He said there
were "hints" the economy was stabilizing but it was too early to say
it had turned the corner.</TE>
<TE>   Bond yields fell as investors bet that the U.S. economy will
remain shaky for the foreseeable future, making a Fed rate increase
unlikely. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to
5.04% from Friday's close of 5.13%.</TE>
<TE>   The possibility of more profit warnings ahead of the official
earnings season, which begins in mid-January, added to a cautious
mood on Wall Street. So far, the less-negative tone of profit
forecasts has boosted sentiment and helped spark a three-week rally.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 1,217 early profit announcements so far, 25% have been
positive. That's more than the 16% average in the first three
quarters of 2001, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Compaq, the No. 2 personal computer maker, rose 29 cents to $11.68
after forecasting a quarterly profit on revenue of $8 billion rather
than the loss seen earlier by the company, indicating the struggling
PC industry experienced surprising holiday demand.</TE>
<TE>   Circuit City, the No. 2 U.S. consumer electronics retailer,
rallied $2.29 to $29.75. The company reported strong December sales
and said fourth-quarter earnings would surpass the consensus
estimate.</TE>
<TE>   News of Circuit City's strong holiday sales pushed up shares of
rivals such as Best Buy, which hit a 52-week high of $76.60 during
the session but ended down 4 cents at $73.84. RadioShack also rose,
up $1.29 to $30.92.</TE>
<TE>   In other market highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Coca-Cola dropped after it was downgraded by an analyst at J.P.
Morgan Securities, who said expectations are too high. Coca-Cola
slumped $1.21 to $45.22.</TE>
<TE>   * ImClone Systems tumbled $7.66, or more than 17%, to $35.83.
Regulators said they would not accept the biotech company's
application to sell its eagerly awaited colon cancer drug, Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   * Halliburton rose 81 cents to $11.03 after the company said it
hasn't lost another asbestos case and isn't filing for bankruptcy.
The stock tumbled 23% last week--hitting its lowest point in 15
years.</TE>
<TE>   * Vignette, maker of software that enables companies to manage
their Web sites, sank $1.45 to $4.02. The company expects quarterly
revenue to be far below its previous guidance amid a continued
reluctance by large corporations to spend heavily on technology.</TE>

<HD>No Delay for Microsoft Trial</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge rejects company's request and will adhere to
fast-paced schedule to wrap up antitrust case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A federal judge Monday rejected Microsoft Corp.'s request to delay a
March 11 antitrust trial for at least five months, pushing aside the
software company's assertion that it would be "impossible" to be
ready in time.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly reminded the Redmond,
Wash.-based company that she warned all sides late last year that she
intended to adhere to a fast-paced time schedule to wrap up the
long-running case.</LD>
<LD>   "No one can claim they lack the resources," the judge said. "I'm
not going to disturb the agreed-to deadline at this point."</LD>
<TE>   Microsoft requested the delay shortly before Christmas, saying it
would be unable to complete its depositions, interview experts and
conduct other pretrial research before March 11.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it needed additional time because the remedy plan
proposed by nine states was "far broader than what anyone reasonably
could have foreseen in September" when the original deadlines were
set.</TE>
<TE>   The plan, which would require Microsoft to license its Windows
operating system to third parties and reveal the source code of its
Internet Explorer browser, is designed to punish Microsoft for its
illegal actions.</TE>
<TE>   The states, including California, are suing Microsoft to win
tougher penalties than those proposed under a settlement reached in
November between Microsoft and the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   Although the judge refused to grant Microsoft extra time, she
warned the states and other Microsoft rivals that they should not
attempt to stonewall Microsoft or delay in complying with the
company's requests for documents and interviews with executives.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft attorney Dan K. Webb complained that he has requested
information from 24 third parties, including several of Microsoft's
corporate rivals that are working closely with the litigating states.
So far, 18 have failed to respond, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They cannot drag their feet," Kollar-Kotelly said. If necessary,
she said she might compel rivals to cooperate with Microsoft or
remove them from the case entirely, barring them from testifying on
behalf of the states.</TE>
<TE>   "Third parties can't cooperate with the states and stonewall
Microsoft," Kollar-Kotelly said.</TE>
<TE>   Webb said he still believed it would be "impossible" to complete
the depositions of rival executives under the current time schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Brendon V. Sullivan, attorney for the states, dismissed
Microsoft's complaints, noting that the case has been ongoing for
several years, giving the company plenty of time to prepare.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, a Ralph Nader-backed consumer group in Washington is
complaining about Microsoft's practice of stockpiling cash, rather
than paying dividends. The Consumer Project on Technology warned
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates in a letter that it believes the
company's failure to pay dividends is an "unlawful device to shelter
Microsoft earnings from federal income taxes."</TE>
<TE>   The group suggested that Microsoft's growing $36-billion cash
balance might be subject to a little-known federal tax on
"accumulated earnings."</TE>
<TE>   A Microsoft spokeswoman said the company's board has no plans to
pay dividends. She noted that the U.S. tax code permits companies to
retain cash to fund businesses and that high-tech companies
frequently maintain large cash reserves for research, marketing and
acquisitions.</TE>

<HD>Bill May Limit Musician Contracts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A California state senator introduced legislation Monday that would
pave the way  for free agency for recording artists, potentially
adding fuel to a movement that appeared to be picking up steam in the
nation's capital.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Kevin Murray (D-Culver City) launched a bill to remove an
amendment to the state labor code that keeps recording artists tied
to contracts longer than other workers.  As the bill was officially
filed in Sacramento, Murray appeared in Washington to rally support
at a music industry conference at Georgetown University attended by
hundreds of musicians, lawyers and executives.</LD>
<LD>   "Some will see this as a move to restore fairness," Murray said.
"Others will see it as arbitrary and perhaps unfair. The record
companies have their arguments.... But we need advocacy for artists.
Now is the time for artists to take up arms and fight for their
rights."</LD>
<TE>   California law protects most entertainers from being tied to any
company for more than seven years. But musicians lost that protection
in 1987, when record companies secured an amendment to the state law
granting them power to collect damages for undelivered albums. Murray
said the amendment is unfair, and his bill has picked up support from
the California Federation of Labor.</TE>
<TE>   Before Murray spoke, a federal lawmaker who has been active on
online music issues, Rep. Rick Boucher (D-Va.), expressed support for
the idea of examining the law from a national perspective. Rep. John
Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) has indicated that he may hold hearings on
record contracts, and music lawyers said Monday that Conyers' staff
has made inquiries about how federal legislation limiting contract
terms could be written.</TE>
<TE>   But the record industry appeared prepared to mount a vigorous
defense of the law.</TE>
<TE>   Top executives from the five major record companies sent Murray a
letter Monday saying his bill would upset the "contractual balance
that now exists" between artists and record companies, and would
jeopardize the entertainment sector of California's economy.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody wants to have a public feud with artists--artists are the
lifeblood of the business. But in this case it's not something people
are going to support," said Hilary Rosen, president of the Recording
Industry Assn. of America, the label's lobbying organization.</TE>
<TE>   Rosen also cast doubt on whether Congress would intervene.</TE>
<TE>   "The implications of the federal government involving themselves
in contract law make it unlikely that anything would pass," she said.
"I've heard some [lawmakers] want hearings, and that might happen,
but I don't anticipate legislation."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the artists who attended the Future of Music Policy
Summit, however, said Murray's bill could generate momentum for a
broader movement of musicians seeking more detailed accounting
practices from record labels, health-care benefits and other reforms.</TE>
<TE>   "If Murray's bill passes, that may be the motivation that a
broader segment of the recording artist community needs to really
jump into the fray," said Johnny Temple, bassist in the rock band
Girls Against Boys, which was dropped by Geffen Records last year.</TE>
<TE>   "If this seven-year limit gets imposed on those contracts, they
can't just string artists along."</TE>

<LD>Knight Trading Group Inc., the largest dealer on the Nasdaq Stock
Market, agreed to pay $1.5million to settle regulatory charges that
it repeatedly violated trading rules.</LD>
<LD>   The penalty is the largest ever assessed by the National Assn. of
Securities Dealers for computer-related offenses. Knight Trading
violated securities laws and NASD rules from July 1997 to May 2001,
including failure to honor posted quotes and failure to promptly
display customer orders, the NASD said.</LD>
<LD>   Jersey City, N.J.-based Knight Trading also had inadequate
supervisory procedures, the regulatory order said.</LD>
<TE>   The company's stock fell 38 cents to $13.28 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Knight, which neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing, said its
shortcomings were largely technical and reflected many firms'
problems in coping with a surge in online trading.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Xerox Corp. said the Securities and Exchange Commission notified the
biggest maker of copiers that it was booking sales of equipment and
services inaccurately, in a manner that may inflate results.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC's chief accountant said the method used to recognize the
timing of revenue from lease purchase agreements "does not follow"
established procedures, Xerox said in a regulatory filing.</LD>
<LD>   In May, Xerox restated its financial results for the first nine
months of 2000, in part to reflect the misapplication of accounting
procedures for leases. Xerox said the differences cited by the SEC
are immaterial. The company, which has lost money in four of the last
five quarters, has been the subject of an SEC investigation since at
least June 2000.</LD>

<LD>The Treasury Department sold $12 billion in three-month bills at a
discount rate of 1.655%, down from 1.71% last week. An additional $14
billion was sold in six-month bills at a rate of 1.75%, down from
1.8%.</LD>
<LD>   The three-month rate was the lowest since Aug. 11, 1958, when the
bills sold for 1.524%. The six-month rate was the lowest since the
government began selling six-month bills in 1958.</LD>
<LD>   The new discount rates understate the actual return to
investors--1.684% for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,958.20 and 1.791% for a six-month bill selling for $9,911.50.</LD>

<LD>Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) recommended that
President Bush nominate Roel Campos, a Texan who is the son of
Mexican immigrants, as a member of the Securities and Exchange
Commission.</LD>
<LD>   If named by Bush and confirmed by the Senate, Campos would be the
first Latino to be an SEC commissioner.</LD>
<LD>   Daschle recommended Campos to fill a Democratic seat on the
five-member commission, in line with traditional practice.</LD>
<TE>   Campos, an attorney, is co-founder, operator and general counsel

<LD>   The GAO, Congress' investigative arm, is investigating drug

<LD>The U.S. Supreme Court refused to consider arguments that the
$206-billion nationwide tobacco settlement violates antitrust laws by
letting cigarette makers jack up prices in concert.</LD>
<LD>   The justices, without comment, turned aside an appeal by two
wholesalers opposed to the 1998 accord between tobacco companies and
46 states. The wholesalers sought to revive a suit against Philip
Morris Cos., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc. and British American
Tobacco's Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Federal courts have uniformly rejected antitrust objections to the
landmark settlement, concluding that tobacco companies are immune

attorneys general.</LD>

billion revenue passenger miles, a measure of the number of paying
customers that travel one mile. The carrier's capacity, or number of

percentage of seats filled by one percentage point to 71% compared
with last year.</LD>

<LD>The Food and Drug Administration said it is reassessing possible
restrictions on ephedra dietary supplements.</LD>
<LD>   The FDA says it has received more than 140 reports of "adverse
events" over the last three years that may be related to the
supplements, which contain ephedrine alkaloids from the ephedra, or
"ma huang" plant. The supplements are often taken in efforts to
increase energy levels or lose weight.</LD>
<LD>   Companies that make supplements that contain the substance include
Herbalife International Inc., Weider Nutrition International Inc. and
Twinlab Corp. The industry contends that the reactions, which ranged
from minor to fatal, weren't related to consumption of products
containing ephedrine.</LD>
<TE>   The FDA decided to withdraw the proposed restrictions after a
report by the General Accounting Office concluded that additional
evidence was needed before reaching a decision.</TE>

<HD>SAG Panel Says Errors to Force Election Rerun</HD>
<DH>Union: Committee says top three races may have been
affected last fall, including president Melissa Gilbert's victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a decision likely to set off a new round of fighting within the
already divided Screen Actors Guild, a union committee said late
Monday that voting snafus were severe enough last fall to invalidate
the union's 2-month-old election results for its top three offices.</LD>
<LD>   SAG officials said the development means that a new election will
automatically take place.</LD>
<LD>   Last fall's vote saw moderate candidate Melissa Gilbert win
handily over actress Valerie Harper in a bitter, high-profile race
for president. Harper and others protested the election after
questions about voting procedures surfaced.</LD>
<TE>   The five-member committee, headed by Fred Savage, sharply
criticized SAG's staff and Sequoia Voting Systems, which was hired by
SAG to run the election. Among the problems cited was giving New York
members two days longer than others to return ballots, and the
failure to include a signature line on ballots issued to New York
members.</TE>
<TE>   SAG officials refused to say anything else about the development.
Neither Gilbert nor Harper could be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The two other offices affected are recording secretary, in which
Elliott Gould won easily over Kevin Kilner, and treasurer, where Kent
McCord won a narrow victory over Amy Aquino.</TE>
<TE>   In making its decision, the committee said the voting
irregularities may have affected the outcome of the election, which
took place over several weeks last fall on a mail-in basis. Results
were announced Nov. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert's election was considered significant because she
campaigned on a moderate platform and was sharply critical of the
previous regime headed by actor William Daniels, who led SAG on a
six-month strike against advertisers in 2000. Harper openly supported
Daniels' policies, and promised to continue them if elected.</TE>
<TE>   The fight over the election results caused yet another bitter
split within SAG, which has been plagued by infighting for years.</TE>

<HD>SEC Accuses Teenager of Securities Fraud</HD>
<DH>Internet: O.C. youth allegedly bilked investors out of
more than $1 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON and DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal regulators accused a Mission Viejo teenager of civil
securities fraud Monday, alleging that the 17-year-old concocted an
elaborate Internet-based scheme that defrauded investors of more than
$1 million.</LD>
<LD>   In the second such case ever filed against a youth, the Securities
and Exchange Commission accused Cole A. Bartiromo of operating a Web
site and Internet message board that promised "risk-free" returns of
up to 2,500% within a few days or weeks of initial investments.</LD>
<LD>   The scheme, which occurred from at least Nov. 1 through about Dec.
15, duped more than 1,000 investors, the SEC said.</LD>
<TE>   The "Invest Better 2001" Web site claimed to make money by pooling
investors' funds and placing "safe bets" on sporting events,
according to the SEC. Some investors received payouts, but others
complained about not receiving promised returns--which may have
triggered the SEC investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Bartiromo, a senior at Trabuco Hills High School, appeared to go
to great lengths to drum up interest in his scheme. In a posting on
another Internet site, he promised that investors would earn 200%
within seven days--"plus 50% to the Red Cross!!!"</TE>
<TE>   Bartiromo listed four investment programs offering returns based
on length of investment. The most lucrative was the "2,500% Christmas
Miracle Program," pledging a 25-fold return to investors who sent him
money by Dec. 15. Participants were instructed to use one of a
handful of Net payment systems to transfer funds.</TE>
<TE>   In a settlement with the SEC, Bartiromo agreed to turn over about
$900,000 that had been transferred to an account at a Costa
Rica-based casino.</TE>
<TE>   Bartiromo also must repatriate within 48 hours any other funds
that he moved out of the country and provide a list of all U.S.
accounts within 20 days, said Alexander Vasilescu, an SEC attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Bartiromo may have to disgorge additional funds as the SEC
investigation continues, Vasilescu said. The agency also has asked a
federal court in New York to assess an unspecified fine, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The youth settled the charges without admitting or denying guilt,
Vasilescu said.</TE>
<TE>   Bartiromo declined to comment when approached by a reporter at a
baseball practice field at his high school Monday. "My lawyers told
me not to talk to anybody," he said. "I wish I could. I'd like to.
I'll talk when it's over, but I don't know when that will be."</TE>
<TE>   Bartiromo's attorney, David Bayless, did not return several phone
calls to his office.</TE>
<TE>   Indicating that it may charge others with helping Bartiromo, the
SEC's suit includes 10 "John Does" who may be named later.</TE>
<TE>   Bartiromo is the second case of a minor accused by the SEC of
securities fraud. The first was a high-profile case two years ago in
which a New Jersey teenager, Jonathan Lebed, agreed to repay $285,000
in misbegotten gains after allegedly using Internet message boards to
manipulate stock prices.</TE>
<TE>   The Lebed case raised questions about the potential for
Internet-savvy teenagers to be lured into Web-based financial fraud
in the wake of the stock market's historic surge in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the Bartiromo and Lebed cases there have been other
instances of teenagers attempting to commit securities fraud but they
were caught early and let off with warnings, an SEC spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   In one case, a boy offered to sell an "Online Scam Guide" listing
1,001 ways to bilk people via the Net. When approached by the SEC,
the youth burst into tears and said: "I am only a teenager. Please
don't tell my mommy," according to a 1999 speech by an SEC official.</TE>
<TE>   "There are plenty of kids without scruples," said Michael
Josephson, president and founder of the Josephson Institute of Ethics
in L.A. "I have a sinking feeling that more kids will admire what
[Bartiromo] did than be repelled by it."</TE>
<TE>   In interviews Monday, investors from as far away as Australia said
they were taken in by the scheme.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Daigle, a 47-year-old electrical engineer from Austin,
Texas, said he lost $6,000. He said he invested $30 in November.
After getting his first payout about a week later, he began investing
ever-larger sums.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought this was pretty neat so I kept going," Daigle said,
saying he believed it was legitimate because it was "so
professionally done." However, he became concerned when the payouts
stopped. "The fact that it was run by a 17-year-old makes me even
more upset," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bartiromo lives with his parents. His father, John, 44, is a
longtime employee of Southern California Edison. His mother, Jeanise,
41, is a grade school teacher.</TE>
<TE>   With TV crews and other media outside the family home Monday
afternoon, Bartiromo and his father drove off shortly after the son
returned from baseball practice.</TE>
<TE>   Some people who know Bartiromo said they were shocked at the
charges. "This is unbelievable," said Michael Greenwood, who moved
into a house across the street from the Bartiromos a year ago. "Cole
is a great kid, very quiet. The kids love him. He's very polite, so
polite it's sickening."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said Cole and his father are big sports memorabilia
collectors. The son has traded memorabilia over the Internet,
Greenwood said. He called the family "model citizens."</TE>
<TE>   Some of Bartiromo's baseball teammates knew he liked the fantasy
sports leagues on the Internet and said he was particularly fond of
WallStreetSports.com, an interactive game that blends sports with the
stock market. He often talked about going on EBay to trade sports
memorabilia, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was always talking about creating a golf tournament for us,"
said teammate Adam Mitchell.</TE>
<TE>   A member of Bartiromo's family told government investigators that
the youth was a cousin of Maria Bartiromo, a reporter for the CNBC
financial cable channel, a source said. But a CNBC spokeswoman said
"Maria is definitely not related to this young man. She's never heard
of him."</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wells Fargo &amp; Co. is poised to introduce a discount service for
wiring money to Mexico, the latest move in the banking giant's
courtship of the steadily growing Latino population within the United
States.</LD>
<LD>   The new service will charge a $10 flat fee for wiring as much as
$1,000 to Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   The price undercuts the rates charged by the dominant financial
wire services, Western Union Holdings Inc. and MoneyGram Payment
Systems Inc., which collect fees ranging from $15 for transfers up to
$300 to as much as $50 to send $1,000 to Mexico.</LD>
<TE>   Mexicans living in the U.S. wire an estimated $8 billion annually
to friends and relatives back home.</TE>
<TE>   Wells Fargo will launch the new service at one branch in Phoenix
and seven branches in Texas under a pilot program that will begin
before April.</TE>

<HD>Compaq, Gateway Say They Will Post Profits</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two struggling personal computer makers, Compaq Computer Corp. and
Gateway Inc., said Monday that they made money in the fourth quarter,
surprising analysts and investors and providing another hopeful sign
that the technology slump may be ending.</LD>
<LD>   Houston-based Compaq, the second-biggest PC maker behind Dell
Computer Inc., had a fourth-quarter profit before unspecified
expenses as sales rose for the first time in a year. San Diego-based
Gateway said it had a pretax profit excluding costs after four
straight quarters of losses. But the company missed analysts'
estimates.</LD>
<LD>   Compaq had sales of more than $8 billion, after forecasting as
little as $7.6 billion, on higher demand from businesses and holiday
shoppers. The company didn't give a per-share result; analysts
expected a loss of 3 cents a share.</LD>
<TE>   Compaq's report follows statements by analysts that the PC
industry's fourth-quarter sales beat expectations.</TE>
<TE>   PC retail sales rose 30% from the third quarter, compared with a
typical 15% to 20% increase, said Richard Gardner, an analyst at
Salomon Smith Barney Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Gateway's fourth-quarter sales fell 52% to $1.16 billion. Sales
averaged $1,660 a unit, beating the company's estimate.</TE>
<TE>   Compaq shares rose 25 cents to $11.93 in after-hours trading,
after closing up 29 cents to $11.68 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Gateway shares fell 35 cents to $9.90 after the announcement in
after-hours trading; they had closed up 43 cents to $10.25 on the
NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Bill to Protect Right to Copy Digital Files</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A congressman who has played a key role in high-tech issues said
Monday that he will introduce legislation aimed at protecting the
right of consumers to make copies of digital files, such as songs on
a CD.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. Rick Boucher (D-Va.), who sits on the Judiciary subcommittee
on the Internet and Intellectual Property, said he would try to amend
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which was designed to limit
piracy in the digital age.</LD>
<LD>   Critics of the act, which is aimed at preventing illegal copying,
say it is being used by the entertainment industry to prevent all
types of copying, including copying that is allowed under
intellectual property law.</LD>
<TE>   The copyright act criminalizes tools that can be used to
copy--such as software that can break electronic locks on DVD
movies--regardless of whether the copies are legal.</TE>
<TE>   Boucher believes such tools should be legal, but anyone making
illegal copies should face sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   The move comes a day after a Los Angeles Times story explored the
way new technologies are trumping copyright law, preventing consumers
from making legal copies of music, movies or books.</TE>
<TE>   Boucher also sent a letter to the Recording Industry Assn. of
America suggesting that copy-protected CDs may violate the 1992 Audio
Home Recording Act.</TE>
<TE>   Under that law, consumers pay a few extra pennies each time they
buy a blank recordable CD, and that money goes to the entertainment
industry as compensation for losses caused by copying.</TE>
<TE>   The payments were established as a legislative compromise at the
dawn of the digital age to allay fears that the industry would suffer
disastrous economic consequences from piracy.</TE>
<TE>   But Boucher said the industry may be breaking that legislative
agreement by using tools such as encryption.</TE>
<TE>   "I am particularly concerned that some of these technologies may
prevent or inhibit consumer home recording," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Boucher's letter included questions about the technology, how it's
being used and the industry's objectives that he wants the RIAA to
answer. The RIAA said it will respond to Boucher's request.</TE>

<HD>21st Century Insurance to Stop Selling Homeowner Policies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>21st Century Insurance is ending its three-year experiment with
selling homeowner insurance in California, and instead will refer
customers to a subsidiary of Calabasas-based Countrywide Credit
Industries Inc. for coverage, company officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Woodland Hills-based 21st Century, which is owned by American
International Group Inc., said it will stop renewing homeowners'
policies beginning Feb. 21 and will send customers to DirectNet
Insurance Agency Inc., which provides homeowner, rental and condo
coverage.</LD>
<LD>   21st Century returned to the homeowner insurance market in 1999
after being nearly bankrupted by the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The
company, which provides auto insurance to 6% of California drivers
and insures drivers in other Western states, was unable to build much
market share in California, the only state in which it offered
homeowner insurance. The company y insures fewer than 75,000
homeowners, less than 1% of the market, company spokesman Marty
Cooper said.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, the company had direct earned premiums of $30 million,
which accounts for 3% of the company's total insurance premiums,
Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   "Rather than beat their heads against the wall, they decided to
focus on the auto insurance business and grow that business," Cooper
said.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper said the decision was not influenced by insurers' growing
problem with mold-related claims. Thousands of health and property
damage claims related to mold have severely affected the Texas
homeowner insurance market, and experts say the problem is spreading
to California.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of real estate investment trusts delivered bigger gains than
the broader stock market for the second consecutive year in 2001, but
REITs will be hard pressed to perform as well in 2002 as they did
last year.</LD>
<LD>   REIT stocks will remain a stable investment, analysts believe, but
the recession is bound to catch up with an industry that relies on
rents paid by tenants in the office and industrial buildings,
shopping centers, apartment complexes and other commercial properties
owned by REITs.</LD>
<LD>   Indexes that track the "total return" of REITs--the combination of
the dividend they pay and the net change in their stock price during
the year--show that they outperformed both the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
and the Nasdaq composite indexes in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   The Bloomberg REIT index recorded a total return of 12.9% last
year, while the S&amp;P 500 fell 11.8% and Nasdaq dropped 20.8%.</TE>
<TE>   Many REITs will continue to report earnings growth and will
maintain or raise dividends this year, analysts forecast, but the
rates of growth are likely to slow.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't think REITs will be able to achieve the gains this year
that they achieved last year," said analyst Ann Melnick of A.G.
Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis. "The fundamentals in the real estate
industry are worse now than they were a year ago."</TE>
<TE>   Melnick expects REITs to deliver
high-single-digit-to-low-double-digit returns this year, comparable
to the "modestly positive" gains in revenue and income projected by
analyst Ross Smotrich of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Whether REITs can outshine the broader market again in 2002,
analysts say, will depend more on how the overall economy performs
than what happens in the real estate industry.</TE>
<TE>   REIT shares could still outperform the broader market if the
recession drags on and investors continue to favor stocks that
produce income rather than riskier growth stocks. But if the economy
begins to recover, experts believe more investors might switch to
stocks with more potential to rise quickly in value.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the concerns about REITs is that they did pretty well in
2001 because there was nowhere else for investors to go," Smotrich
said. "As the economy starts to recover and show some momentum, some
investors will surely go to other sectors."</TE>
<TE>   If the economy were to recover quickly, according to Melnick of
A.G. Edwards, REIT shares might suffer, even though the improving
economy would boost the earnings of REITs.</TE>
<TE>   A comparable situation occurred in the late 1990s, when
fast-rising technology shares came into favor while REIT shares
stalled, causing many REIT executives to complain that their stock
prices did not reflect the financial success of their companies.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of whether the recession drags on or the economy snaps
back, however, analysts agree that REIT stocks are not likely to
fluctuate wildly.</TE>
<TE>   "REITs will just plug along," as they usually do, said analyst
Todd Stender of Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co. in Los Angeles, expressing the
widely held view that well-managed REITs will continue to deliver
annualized dividend yields of 7% to 8%.</TE>
<TE>   Melnick said many investors view REITs as a defensive investment
that is not likely to plunge in value. "REITs have a sort of
'guaranteed' income stream because the tenants have leases of five to
20 years, depending on the sector," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Those long-term leases also prevent REITs from profiting
immediately when a recovery begins, Melnick said, because it takes a
while before leases expire and REITs can raise the rents in response
to increased demand.</TE>
<TE>   If REITs in general are defensive investments, health-care REITs
may be an even more defensive play.</TE>
<TE>   "I think health-care REITs as a group are poised quite well to
deal with a slower economy," said Kenneth B. Roath, chairman and
chief executive of Newport Beach-based Health Care Property
Investors, which owns hospitals and many other types of
health-care-related properties. "Being government-reimbursed puts
something of a cap on our growth, but it also puts a floor on the
downside during a recession."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Roath agrees with analysts who say investors ought to
evaluate REITs on the basis of an individual company's performance.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not saying that any one sector is going to outperform any
other sector this year," Melnick said. She advises investors to look
for companies with a history of earnings growth, a strong balance
sheet and management that has shown it can improve financial results
not just by acquiring property but also by implementing internal
operating efficiencies.</TE>
<TE>   REITs have fared well in part because they have continued to pay
rising or stable dividends during a time of falling interest rates
and thus are more attractive than money market accounts and bonds
offering lower yields. But it's not clear how REITs would fare if
interest rates rise.</TE>
<TE>   "If interest rates go up, the spread between [bond yields] and
REITs will narrow," Smotrich said, "especially since dividends will
probably not grow as much this year because REIT earnings are not
going to grow as fast."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Smotrich added, climbing rates could benefit
REITs in some ways.</TE>
<TE>   Rising rates sometimes slow the pace of home buying, which could
benefit apartment REITs, he noted, and rising rates could draw some
investors into REITs because they perceive real estate as a hedge
against inflation.</TE>

<HD>Circuit City's Sales Better Than Expected</HD>
<DH>Retail: In latest evidence of a turnaround, consumer
electronics seller posts 10% gain in December over year ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Circuit City Stores Inc., bucking the retail industry's sluggish
holiday season, Monday reported a better-than-expected 10% gain in
December sales versus a year ago. It also said fourth-quarter
earnings will probably beat analysts' expectations.</LD>
<LD>   The upbeat news was the latest evidence of a turnaround at the
Richmond, Va.-based consumer electronics seller, which has revamped
its product mix while improving customer service.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, the company's stock has surged in recent months and
rallied sharply Monday.</LD>
<TE>   "Circuit City is a company that is reinventing itself," said
Jefferies &amp; Co. analyst Donald Trott. The company was helped by more
promotional pricing, a favorable sector backdrop and improvement in
in-store execution, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Floor space that had been occupied with washers and refrigerators
two years ago gave way in December to products that are particularly
hot in the holiday selling season, such as video game cartridges and
consoles and digital cameras.</TE>
<TE>   A revamped employee pay structure meant improved employee morale,
which allowed the company to provide better customer service with
fewer employees, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Circuit City executives Monday said strong sales in personal
computer hardware and software, DVDs and digital cameras helped
propel sales in each of the company's 15 operating regions, which
will boost fourth-quarter earnings by as much as 5 cents a share, to
72 to 76 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call had expected
quarterly earnings of 71 cents on average.</TE>
<TE>   Shares in Circuit City rose $2.29 to close at $29.75 on the New
York Stock Exchange. Although the stock earlier in the day hit a
52-week high of $31.40, it is well off its peak in 2000 of $61.</TE>
<TE>   In a conference call Monday, Chief Executive W. Alan McCollough
said the company expects January and February sales to remain
healthy. He reiterated a management forecast of mid-single-digit
gains in stores open at least a year.</TE>
<TE>   Those numbers, however, are based on comparisons with dismal
results from a year ago, when sales for the first quarter were off
25%.</TE>
<TE>   Still, analysts said, Circuit City's December sales figures,
coming after November's 6% year-over-year gain, affirms the company's
changes. These include Circuit City's decision 18 months ago to get
out of the appliance business.</TE>
<TE>   That move, which was partly responsible for the 25% same-store
sales decline in the first quarter of 2001 and a 21% decline in
same-store sales in the second quarter compared with a year earlier,
paved the way for Circuit's December success, company executives
said.</TE>
<TE>   In a note to clients, analyst Shelly Hale of Banc of America
Securities said there is room for gains in Circuit City's market
valuation.</TE>
<TE>   "Circuit City was able to post a strong December [sales gain]
despite operating under a challenging macroeconomic climate," Hale
said.</TE>
<TE>   "In addition, as management noted repeatedly on the call, the
company was able to post stellar [sales gains] despite the fact that
Best Buy opened 56 stores in 2001 in Circuit City markets."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the nation's third-largest electronics seller,
RadioShack Corp., said Monday that December sales in stores open at
least a year fell 2% as compared with a year earlier</TE>
<TE>   The Fort Worth-based company said sales for the fiscal year to
date are up 1% in stores open at least a year, however.</TE>
<TE>   RadioShack also said earnings per share for the year are likely to
rise 13% to 15%.</TE>
<TE>   RadioShack stock rose $1.29 to $30.92 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Same-store sales--or sales from stores open at least a year--are
considered an important measure of a company's health because the
number excludes new and closed stores.</TE>
<TE>   "Circuit City had a lot of problems other companies didn't have,"
Jefferies analyst Trott said. "You're coming back from a depressed
level [that] is a little different than some of the other companies."</TE>

<HD>Chester W. Nimitz Jr., 86; Submarine Officer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN WEIL</AU>
<BD>THE WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Navy Rear Adm. Chester W. Nimitz Jr., a highly decorated World War II
submarine officer who was the son of the fleet admiral who helped
oversee the Allied victory in that war, has died. He was 86.</LD>
<LD>   Nimitz and his wife, Joan Labern Nimitz, died Wednesday at a
retirement residence in Needham, Mass. Family members said the couple
took their lives. Joan Nimitz was 89.</LD>
<LD>   "They were both very frail and fragile," said Nancy Nimitz, one of
Nimitz's sisters.</LD>
<TE>   Other family members noted that their deaths were not unexpected.</TE>
<TE>   "They had lived their whole life together and wanted to die
together," a daughter told Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving the Navy, Nimitz made a second career in the
high-tech field, becoming chief executive of Perkin-Elmer Corp.
before retiring in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Nimitz was the only son of Chester William Nimitz, the legendary
officer who took command of the shattered Pacific Fleet less than
three weeks after the calamitous attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941,
rebuilt it and helped lead the Navy and Marine Corps to victory over
Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., Nimitz followed in his father's footsteps
by attending the U.S. Naval Academy, from which he graduated in 1936.
After three years on the cruiser Indianapolis, he entered the
submarine service, as his father had.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Nimitz recalled her brother as "a very bright guy" and a man
of "absolute probity." As a submarine officer, he received training
in ascending to the surface from a damaged vessel and developed
another important quality: the ability to hold his breath for as long
as five minutes.</TE>
<TE>   At parties, she said, when challenged, he would reply, "Try me,"
and would then "sit there, with his face getting pinker and pinker."
The feat would be followed, she said, by a great "whoosh."</TE>
<TE>   The submarine Haddo, the first of the two that the younger Nimitz
commanded, received a Navy Unit Commendation in 1944 for the
close-range sinking of a Japanese destroyer. The admiral's military
honors included three Silver Stars.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, he commanded a submarine division based in San
Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Nimitz's service under the ultimate command of his father made for
some interesting family dialogue, Nancy Nimitz said.</TE>
<TE>   Once, she said, her brother telephoned her to complain about the
performance of an officer who served under her father and above her
brother.</TE>
<TE>   "Damn it," she recalled her brother saying, "the fleet is going in
the wrong direction, and Dad knows it and isn't doing anything about
it."</TE>
<TE>   In 1957, he left the Navy to join Texas Instruments. Nancy Nimitz
said the decision was prompted in part by recognition of the need to
pay for the education of three daughters, closely spaced in age.</TE>
<TE>   When his parents got word of his career-changing decision, she
said, it was an uncomfortable moment. She said their mother eased the
tension by saying to their father: "All right, now he's told you. Now
call him up and say it's OK."</TE>
<TE>   The Nimitzes had homes for years in Boca Grande, Fla., as well as
Wellfleet, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   They are survived by three daughters, five grandchildren and two
great-grandchildren. Joan Nimitz also is survived by a sister, and
Chester Nimitz is survived by three sisters.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Make Big Bid for Ishii</HD>

<LD>The Dodgers bid $11.5 million Monday for negotiating rights to
Kazuhisa Ishii, sources said, and they could learn as soon as today
whether the star Japanese pitcher is eligible to join their starting
rotation.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels, New York Mets and Texas Rangers were among other teams
submitting sealed bids by Monday's deadline. The Yakult Swallows,
Ishii's Japanese club, has four days to accept or reject the highest
bid, and sources said the Dodgers have the high bid.</LD>
<LD>   "We made a bid I feel is very fair and very competitive," Dodger
General Manager Dan Evans said.</LD>
<TE>   Evans would not confirm the amount of the bid, but sources said
the Dodgers wanted to maximize their chances by stretching beyond the
$5-million to $8-million bidding range projected last week.</TE>
<TE>   The Angel bid is below $10 million, a source said. The amounts bid
by other clubs could not be obtained.</TE>
<TE>   The Yakult club keeps the bid money; the winning bidder then must
negotiate a contract with Ishii. The left-hander wants a three-year
contract, to which the Dodgers would not object.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii, 28, went 12-6 with a 3.39 earned-run average last season
and is 78-46 with a 3.38 ERA in a 10-year career. If Kevin Brown and
Andy Ashby can return from injury, the addition of Ishii would allow
the Dodgers to send Eric Gagne to triple-A Las Vegas or use him in
relief or in trade.</TE>

<TE>   On the first business day since Tony Tavares resigned as president
of Anaheim Sports, the Disney executive responsible for overseeing
the Angels and Mighty Ducks said he is unsure whether to restructure
Tavares' position.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Pressler, chairman of Disney's parks and resorts division,
said he would take several weeks to define the job before filling it.
Pressler said he might eliminate one layer of management by asking
his general managers, Pierre Gauthier of the Ducks and Bill Stoneman
of the Angels, to report directly to him. If so, Pressler said,
Tavares' replacement would not involve himself in hockey or baseball
operations and would be responsible only for the business operations
of the two teams.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not really clear to me that I need to fill that position
with someone like Tony," Pressler said.</TE>
<TE>   Tavares cleared out his office Friday, within hours of announcing
his resignation. Three Anaheim Sports vice presidents--Andy Roundtree
(finance), Rick Schlesinger (legal) and Kevin Uhlich (sales,
marketing and stadium operations)--are sharing administrative
responsibilities.</TE>

<TE>   The Dodgers will begin the 2002 season against Barry Bonds and the
San Francisco Giants on April 2, kicking off a six-game
homestand--three against the Giants and three against the Colorado
Rockies.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers also said they'll finish the season with a six-game
homestand--two against Colorado and four against San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, the Dodgers will face AL East opponents in
their 18-game interleague schedule, which includes six games against
the Angels and three each against Boston, Tampa Bay, Baltimore and
Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Boston and Toronto visit Dodger Stadium, with the Dodgers playing

<TE>   A plan for publicly funded ballparks for the Yankees and Mets hit
a snag when New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the city won't
build stadiums this year because of its budget crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "At the moment, everybody understands--given the lack of housing,
given the lack of school space, given the deficit in the operating
budget--it is just not practical this year to go and to build new
stadiums," Bloomberg said.</TE>

<HD>Vargas' Time for Crime Is a Jog in Park</HD>
<DH>Boxing: Junior-middleweight champion wears electronic
anklet, allowing him to continue training for potential fight with De
La Hoya.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>World Boxing Assn. junior-middleweight champion Fernando Vargas,
sentenced to 90 days in jail for assault, is serving his time by
jogging down the streets of Oxnard, jumping rope and hitting the
heavy bag in his neighborhood gym.</LD>
<LD>   If all goes as Vargas hopes, he will formalize a deal Wednesday to
fight Oscar De La Hoya on May 4, and then spend some of his remaining
jail sentence attending news conferences in Los Angeles and Las Vegas
and flying to Miami to do a talk show.</LD>
<LD>   While it may seem as if the idea of punishment has gotten lost
somewhere along the way, what Vargas is doing has the full approval
of Santa Barbara law enforcement officials.</LD>
<TE>   He is serving his time via an electronic monitoring system, the
modern version of the old ball and chain. Vargas wears an electronic
anklet that emits a radio signal, allowing authorities to track him
at all times. Under terms of the agreement, Vargas must remain
confined to his Oxnard home, but is allowed to run 90 minutes a day
and work out at the nearby La Colonia Boxing Club, as long as he does
not do so during public hours.</TE>
<TE>   If Vargas, who has been under electronic monitoring for three
weeks, does not violate the terms of the agreement, he is expected to
be set free March 8.</TE>
<TE>   Last September, Vargas pleaded no contest to conspiracy to commit
assault in the beating of Doug Rossi, who suffered a broken finger
and cuts to the head when he was attacked by Vargas and several
others in a 1999 incident in a home in the Santa Barbara area.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the 90-day sentence, Vargas was given three years'
probation, 100 hours of community service and ordered to make
restitution to the victim.</TE>
<TE>   "Our aim was to see that Mr. Vargas was not treated any
differently than anybody else," said Hilary Dozer, a senior deputy in
the Santa Barbara District Attorney's office. "We bargained for jail
time, but administrative decisions were made for electronic
monitoring. We are satisfied that Mr. Vargas is being treated like
anybody else. There are work furloughs and all sorts of other
programs utilized in this county."</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen percent of those serving sentences in Santa Barbara
County are doing so by electronic monitoring. Some bargained for
their electronic anklets. Others were given the anklets to prevent
overcrowding in the jails.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally, someone under this program can only stay home or go to
work," said Victoria Rochester, a Santa Barbara probation manager.
"It's a little different for Mr. Vargas because his work involves
training."</TE>
<TE>   And traveling to promote a fight?</TE>
<TE>   "He could ask for permission to do that," Rochester said. "If
changes were to be made [in the terms of Vargas' electronic
monitoring], they would be made on a day-to-day basis."</TE>
<TE>   While some might question the fairness of Vargas being able to
continue his normal routine while supposedly paying for his crime,
Rolando Arellano, Vargas' co-manager, endorses electronic monitoring
as the most practical punishment for his fighter.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be too much of a liability putting someone as well known
as Fernando in jail," Arellano said. "This way, he is allowed to
maintain his ties to the community and serve his time for the
county."</TE>
<TE>   Vargas' life is not totally free of interruption.</TE>
<TE>   He has sacrificed by agreeing to work out in Oxnard until his time
is served, rather than going to his training headquarters in Big
Bear.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas chose not to comment on that hardship or any other aspect
of his electronic incarceration.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas is expected to have plenty to say if all goes as expected
Wednesday when his promoter, Gary Shaw, his co-manager, Shelly
Finkel, De La Hoya's promoter, Bob Arum, and De La Hoya's business
manager, Richard Schaefer, meet in Las Vegas to hammer out the final
details of the proposed 154-pound championship fight.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas won't be there.</TE>

<HD>Recasner Is Cut to Save Money</HD>

<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Making the sort of move that long ago established them as the most
eccentric team in professional sports, the Clippers waived reserve
guard Eldridge Recasner on Monday to avoid having to pay him a
guaranteed contract.</LD>
<LD>   Contracts are guaranteed for the rest of the season as of
Thursday. However, the Clippers are expected to sign Recasner to a
10-day contract.</LD>
<LD>   The move will save the Clippers money in the long run, but leaves
them vulnerable in the backcourt for the short term. Without Recasner
for games Monday against the Philadelphia 76ers and tonight against
the Washington Wizards, the Clippers have only two point
guards--starter Jeff McInnis and backup Earl Boykins.</LD>
<TE>   Keyon Dooling has been sidelined since November because of a badly
sprained left ankle. He isn't expected to be fit to practice until
later this month, which means the team will probably sign Recasner to
a second 10-day contract.</TE>
<TE>   Recasner will travel with the team, but cannot practice with the
Clippers or sit on their bench during games until he is re-signed.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Alvin Gentry on facing Michael Jordan tonight: "He's the
greatest player ever. The guys aren't going to change the way they
play. If anything it [will make] them play harder. These guys thought
they'd never have a chance to play against the guy. I don't think
they'll be in awe. It's like [Wayne] Gretzky or [John] Elway. You
respect them, but you also try a little harder against them because
of who they are."</TE>

<HD>York Prefers the Bright Side</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This has been a trying season for Might Duck defenseman Jason York.</LD>
<LD>   He left Ottawa, where the playoffs return every spring like the
swallows to San Juan Capistrano, and signed with the Ducks, who have
gone south, one way, again this winter. On top of that, York has
played with a sore left shoulder much of the season, which has
limited his abilities.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, York deserves the stiff-upper-lip award.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think we can really look back right now," said York, who
signed a three-year, $6-million contract last summer. "The good thing
is, we have a lot of hockey left. It's no time for anybody to hang
their heads. After the season we can sit back and assess things.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like to talk about other teams, but my first year in
Ottawa, we were 12 points out of a playoff spot with 19 games to go
and we made the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Duck General Manager Pierre Gauthier's investment in York
certainly has been one of his better moves, although that may be
grading on a curve. York has four goals and 15 points and has played
in all 43 games this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there have been a number of games where I hoped he would
have done more," Coach Bryan Murray said. "To be fair to Jason, I
know he has played with a shoulder problem for a long time. When we
signed Jason, Pierre said, 'Now we got six defensemen that can play.'
From that point of view, [Jason] has done what he was supposed to
do."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Disney spin: Paul Pressler, who oversees the Ducks as chairman of
Disney's parks and resorts, had refused to comment on the team all
season.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, when Anaheim Sports President Tony Tavares resigned,
Pressler finally assessed the situation, saying, " ... The Ducks are
playing extremely well. The puck is going to fall into the net any
night now."</TE>
<TE>   It did that evening ... once. The Ducks were beaten by Florida,
2-1, their fourth consecutive loss.</TE>

<KH>FIGURE SKATING NOTES</KH>
<HD>Clark Has New View in His 30s</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After 15 years of competitive figure skating, Shepherd Clark is
finally enjoying the U.S. championships.</LD>
<LD>   That he will be the oldest skater in the men's competition, which
starts tonight with the short program, doesn't bother him.</LD>
<LD>   "To come back to this atmosphere is great. This is not a threat to
me," said Clark, who is two months short of 31, five months older
than Todd Eldredge.</LD>
<TE>   "I could take it or leave it. I'm not defined by figure skating. I
used to be.... People ask me, 'Why are you still skating?' I've had
no sponsorship help. No financial help. No medical help. No one
believes in me. But I believe."</TE>
<TE>   A Boston native who splits his time between his hometown and
Atlanta, Clark was the 1989 U.S. junior champion and finished second
that year in the world junior championships.</TE>
<TE>   His best result at the senior national level was fourth in 1998;
he was fifth in 1999 but had to withdraw from the 2000 competition
because of injuries and didn't compete last year.</TE>
<TE>   For Clark, who designs jewelry and works for an energy company,
religious faith helped him persevere through back injuries that led
doctors to say he'd never skate again. Having a greater purpose helps
too: He has sponsored several children in impoverished countries
through World Vision, a faith-based organization that helps children
around the world, and he hopes his skating can raise money and
promote that cause.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything I do here will be a blessing," Clark said Monday after
practicing his long program at Staples Center. "People tell me,
'You're 30 years old. Get on with your life.' But it's what's here
and here that matter," he said, pointing to his head and his heart.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at skating as one of many things in my life. There's an
addiction one has to the stimulus created by this atmosphere. I'm
thankful that I have this.... I had some years of depression, when I
thought about suicide and made one attempt, but God prevented that.
It's like I've been a broken vessel and God put the pieces back
together and let the light shine through."</TE>
<TE>   Clark, who qualified by finishing fourth at the Eastern sectional
competition, said he has been working on a quadruple loop and hopes
to try it in his long program. "I'd like to see the face of [TV
skating commentator] Dick Button if I do it here," Clark said,
"because he was the first to do the triple loop in competition [at
the 1952 Olympics]. That would really be great."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Michael Weiss, who was fourth at last year's U.S. championships
and didn't qualify for the world team, said he's not discouraged by
his inconsistent season.</TE>
<TE>   "In 10 years, nobody is going to remember who won the Nations
Cup," he said, referring his shaky eighth-place finish at that Grand
Prix event in November.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to remember who won nationals and who won medals at
the Olympics. Subconsciously, I know that, and the big events are in
the next month and a half."</TE>
<TE>   To prepare for the U.S. competition, which will determine the U.S.
team for the Salt Lake City Winter Games, Weiss said he lost 13
pounds over the last two months. He usually carries 165 pounds on his
5-foot-8 frame, but he's about 150 now.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to look back and say, 'I didn't do this or that.' I
was 100% at the Olympics and I gave it my best shot," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be able to look back in a couple of years, when I'm
pushing 200 [pounds] and say, 'Look how skinny I was at the
Olympics.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angela Nikodinov was the only competitor among the top women to
take advantage of the first official free-skating practice Monday at
the Sports Arena.</TE>

<HD>Lynwood Sends Signal It Cannot Be Ignored</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lynwood's dominance has become so apparent, even Harbor City
Narbonne--a state champion from the City Section the last two
seasons--is talking about it.</LD>
<LD>   "I told the girls, if we played them today, I don't think we can
beat them," said Narbonne Coach James Anderson, who knows it's likely
his team will have to get past Lynwood's Sade Wiley-Gatewood and
Janice Bright in order to reach the state title game.</LD>
<LD>   Narbonne (10-3) and Lynwood (13-0) played in consecutive games
Saturday at Lynwood in the California Hoops Challenge, and neither
was challenged.</LD>
<TE>   Lynwood beat Brea Olinda, which was No. 9 last week, 53-29.
Narbonne followed with a 65-39 victory over then-No. 6 Lakewood
Artesia.</TE>
<TE>   "Lynwood is playing at such a high level right now," Anderson
said. "Brea's not at the level they've been in the past, but Brea is
still good, and Lynwood beat Brea like a drum."</TE>
<TE>   It was the second-worst beating Brea has absorbed since the
1995-96 season, when Santa Ana Mater Dei beat the Ladycats by 37
points.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson said the game against Artesia was bigger for Narbonne
than it was for Artesia.</TE>
<TE>   "The teams that have given us problems are teams like Artesia,
quick," he said, fully aware that Lynwood fits into the ultra-quick
category. "We've beaten some good teams, but I think it's important
that we take care of business at home. We need to get some confidence
back."</TE>
<TE>   Before playing at Lynwood, Narbonne had played all its games at
either Brea, Poughkeepsie, N.Y.; Phoenix or Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   One of Narbonne's losses was to Jacksonville (Fla.) Ribault,
54-48. Brea Coach Jeff Sink saw Ribault, and called it the best high
school team he had ever seen. On Saturday, Sink said if Lynwood used
its post players more in its offense, the Knights would be
"unbeatable."</TE>
<TE>   They already seem to be.</TE>
<TE>   Poly perfect: Where do Kameca Simmons, Aja Trotter and Long Beach
Poly fit into the mix with Lynwood and Narbonne?</TE>
<TE>   Like Lynwood, the Jackrabbits are in Division I-AA, and if the two
should meet in the Southern Section finals, both will advance to the
state regionals regardless of the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   Like Lynwood, Poly (15-0) is undefeated, having won the Ayala Best
of the West tournament last week with a 60-44 victory over Moore
League rival Long Beach Wilson. This season, Poly has beaten
Westchester, Torrance Bishop Montgomery, Lakewood Artesia, Rialto
Eisenhower, Pasadena Muir and Long Beach Wilson--all teams in The
Times' top 25--and two other teams ranked previously, Valencia and
Playa del Rey St. Bernard.</TE>
<TE>   So is it time to refer to Lynwood, Narbonne and Poly in the same
breath?</TE>
<TE>   "Until we play them and beat them, there's no way to tell," Poly
Coach Carl Buggs said. "Comparative scores, definitely. But they've
had success, and we're trying to get there."</TE>
<TE>   Buggs said he tried to get his team into the Brea tournament and
the Nike Tournament of Champions, but both were "overbooked."</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to do something special this year to get some invites,"
Buggs said. "We don't run from competition. But if a tournament's
full, what can you do?"</TE>
<TE>   Something lacking: After playing Narbonne a month ago, Lauren
Ervin talked about the rematch. The 6-foot-3 junior center from
Artesia called Narbonne "beatable" and the 74-66 loss that night to
the Gauchos "upsetting."</TE>
<TE>   But Ervin's resolve apparently didn't carry over to Saturday's
game. Coach Scott Roczey benched her in the fourth quarter for
"giving up."</TE>
<TE>   "Lauren became frustrated, and I took her out," Roczey said. "She
had ample opportunity to work through it. We have other girls on the
team who work hard and want to play."</TE>
<TE>   Artesia also played without its other top post player, 6-foot-2
junior Cacie Pope. She was suspended for the Narbonne game because
she was ejected from the previous game, a 75-67 loss to Poly.</TE>
<TE>   "Brea's down in talent from the past, but they always have
effort," Roczey said. "We have talent, we just don't always give the
effort."</TE>
<TE>   Junior achievement: Muir's junior varsity won the open division at
the Ayala tournament, going 5-0 against varsity teams from Coachella
Valley (11-7), Alta Loma (3-11), Monrovia (11-6), Chaffey (10-6) and
Ganesha (4-9).</TE>
<TE>   Three-pointers: Ventura made 12 three-point baskets to beat
Heuneme, 65-20. Ventura has 141 in 15 games.... Beverly Hills
defeated Compton Centennial, 73-4. Centennial scored on two
second-quarter free throws and a third-quarter field goal.</TE>

<HD>'Dedicated' Buchberger Enjoys 1,000th Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Kelly Buchberger was in his usual spot two hours before Monday
night's game, sitting astride an exercise bike.</LD>
<LD>   It was a special night for Buchberger, who was about to play in
his 1,000th NHL game, but the Kings' oldest and toughest player
wasn't about to break his pregame routine, even as a small group of
reporters stopped to interview him.</LD>
<LD>   "I've loved this game since the day I started playing when I was
3," he said, explaining his longevity. "My love and desire to play
every night is still there. You have to be really dedicated to the
game to play as long as I have."</LD>
<TE>   Buchberger, 35, played his first regular-season game for the
Edmonton Oilers in the 1987-88 season, but he made his NHL debut in
the 1987 Stanley Cup finals, helping the Oilers defeat the
Philadelphia Flyers.</TE>
<TE>   Claimed by the Atlanta Thrashers in the 1999 expansion draft, he
was traded on March 13, 2000, to the Kings, who wanted his veteran
leadership.</TE>
<TE>   He has given them that and more, having played in 220 consecutive
games.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a quiet leader," Coach Andy Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   "The other guys watch him practice every day and play injured and
banged up. You don't play 1,000 games in this league in the role that
he plays unless you're the ultimate competitor because that job is
the toughest job in hockey.</TE>
<TE>   "There are very few tough guys like Kelly Buchberger that play
1,000 games. That's a testament to him. He's fought all the battles."</TE>
<TE>   After practicing this morning in Montclair, N.J., the Kings will
bus into Manhattan to visit the site of the World Trade Center
disaster.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, with the situation involving Mark Bavis and Ace
Bailey, there's special meaning for us going to ground zero," Murray
said, referring to the King scouts killed when their hijacked flight
was crashed into the center.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt it like all of America and all of the world did on that
tragic day, but certainly with a couple key members of our staff
being involved, it's going to be a special moment when we visit."</TE>

<HD>Unlikely King Plays the Hero</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Saying he's no scorer, Laperriere finishes with two
goals, including the biggest, in 3-2 victory over Devils.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Ian Laperriere, the Kings' hyperkinetic forward, all but laughed it
off last month when he failed to convert a penalty shot in a loss at
Montreal, telling anybody who would listen, "I'm not a goal scorer."</LD>
<LD>   He'll have a hard time convincing anybody who saw him score two
goals Monday night in the Kings' 3-2 victory over the New Jersey
Devils, including the winner on a nifty backhand with 2:05 to play at
Continental Airlines Arena.</LD>
<LD>   After Eric Belanger's shot from the slot was stopped by Devil
goaltender Martin Brodeur, Laperriere picked up the rebound to the
right of the net on the forehand side of his stick. Patiently but
quickly, he shifted the puck to his backhand side and lifted a shot
into the wide-open net as Brodeur scrambled to get back into
position.</LD>
<TE>   Laperriere, who also scored a second-period goal, doubled his
season output in helping the Kings extend their winning streak to
three games.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still not a goal scorer," he said again afterward, though not
as convincingly as he had in Montreal. "I just had good chances
tonight and put them in....</TE>
<TE>   "Trust me, I want to score every game. I'm not a goal scorer, but
I want to score every game. I don't have the chances to score every
game--I do other stuff out there--but tonight I didn't have time to
think. Maybe it's when I think that I struggle. I didn't have time to
think there. I saw the open net and put it in."</TE>
<TE>   Unable to build on a 2-1 lead when they failed to score or even
get a shot on goal during a five-on-three power play late in the
second period, the Kings saw the Devils tie the score on a goal by
Jay Pandolfo with 11:13 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Then, with the clock winding down, Laperriere put them back on
top, sending many in the crowd of 13,638 toward the exits.</TE>
<TE>   "Eric just went to the net and I gave him the puck," Laperriere
said of the winning play, which started with his pass to Belanger,
who assisted on both of his linemate's goals and has four points in
two games. "I stayed around the net just to see what was going to
happen. The rebound just came to me and I had an open net.</TE>
<TE>   "It could have gone the other way. In the first 32 games of the
year, they were all going the other way. I was lucky enough that it
came right back on my tape."</TE>
<TE>   It was good sign for the Kings, who opened their five-game trip
Saturday with a 3-0 victory over the New York Islanders.</TE>
<TE>   "Couldn't be better," Coach Andy Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings have lost only one of their last nine road games,
winning six and tying two since Dec. 8, when they lost to the St.
Louis Blues, 2-0, and dropped six games below .500 to equal their
low-water mark of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Now, after a 9-2-3 run, they're one game over .500 for the first
time this season and only three points out of a playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   "We seem to be a team that doesn't quit," winger Steve Heinze
said. "We get behind the eight-ball, we work even harder. You know,
all those cliches. Hopefully, we don't have to get the gun to our
head before we start playing well and now we'll just be consistent
all the time."</TE>
<TE>   It will help if players such as Laperriere, who usually leaves his
mark in opponent's bruises, can help with the offensive load.</TE>
<TE>   "We need those guys to produce for us," defenseman Mathieu
Schneider said. "That's a big part of our success. Other teams are
going to key on our top guys. We need those other guys to score goals
in games like this, when tight checking becomes a huge part of the
game.</TE>
<TE>   "You look at the teams that have success [such as] Detroit and
Colorado--their role players are the ones that put them over the top.</TE>
<TE>   "If we get that, we're going to have a lot of success."</TE>
<TE>   One of their top guys, Adam Deadmarsh, scored first for the Kings,
his team-leading 15th goal tying the score at 1-1 with 5:52 to play
in the first period after John Madden had given the Devils an early
1-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Laperriere scored his first goal on an unusual play, pouncing on
the puck as it squirted out of a faceoff in the Devil zone and firing
it quickly at the net.</TE>
<TE>   It was a designed play, what Murray called "a double block."</TE>
<TE>   The winner, though, was all improvisation, a startling flash of
skating and puck-handling skill by a player who rarely gets a chance
to display either.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a big goal for our team," Laperriere said, grinning.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Another gray, icy day, another scoring swingman to defend.</LD>
<LD>   Must be the NBA's Central Division.</LD>
<LD>   A moment removed from Vince Carter, the Lakers get Jerry
Stackhouse tonight. Same scary offensive potential, same defensive
matchup.</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers will run Kobe Bryant, Devean George and/or Rick Fox at
Stackhouse, who finished second to Allen Iverson in scoring last
season, just ahead of Shaquille O'Neal and Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   Stackhouse's numbers are down, but Detroit's are up, despite
playing miserably the last three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Carter scored 24 points Sunday in Toronto. He missed 12 of 22
shots, got into foul trouble and was trampled by Bryant's seamless 31
points. Stackhouse's game is unlike Carter's, Bryant said, though
Stackhouse scored 76 points in two games against the Lakers last
season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's different guarding those guys," he said. "Stackhouse is more
physical. He likes to go to the basket more, and he gets to the
free-throw line more often."</TE>
<TE>   In part because of their steadier defense on players such as
Carter and Stackhouse, the Lakers have won four in a row, the last
two with O'Neal on the floor. He had missed the previous five because
of an arthritic toe.</TE>
<TE>   "There's more to it," Bryant said of the modest winning streak
with O'Neal. "We started hitting some shots and guys got a little
more in rhythm. Then again, just his presence on the floor changes
the dynamic of the game."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Phil Jackson was more succinct.</TE>
<TE>   "We were playing poorly and now we're playing better," he said.
"It's what we call the holiday blues. It's a tough time to play in
the NBA."</TE>
<TE>   George threw a perfect alley-oop pass to O'Neal late in the
Lakers' 109-89 win at Toronto. O'Neal got the dunk, and George got
the laugh.</TE>
<TE>   "I got one," he said, laughing, on his way up the floor.</TE>
<TE>   A third-year player still trying to match his physical gifts with
the intellectual side of the game, George isn't known as an eager
passer. That puts him in the NBA majority, but it doesn't stop the
needling.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the joke," he said. "That I don't pass. I think shot
first. When I do pass, they always comment about it."</TE>
<TE>   Fox practiced Monday with two stitches in his upper lip, cut
during Sunday's game.... O'Neal, dealing with two sore feet, did not
practice. Instead, he ran on a treadmill for 40 minutes.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Lindsay Davenport will sit out the Australian Open for the first time
in her professional tennis career because of a chronically injured
right knee. The No. 1-ranked Davenport may require surgery because of
cartilage damage.</LD>
<LD>   "She realizes it's not a nagging injury and it is something to
address," her agent, Tony Godsick, said Monday. "We will know more in
the next day or two."</LD>
<LD>   The Australian Open begins Monday at Melbourne, and Davenport
would have been the top-seeded player. She won the event in 2000 and
has reached the semifinals three other times.</LD>
<TE>   The knee kept Davenport out of action twice for long periods in
2001, most recently after the season-ending tour championships in
November at Munich, Germany.</TE>
<TE>   She reclaimed the No. 1 ranking in the semifinals against Kim
Clijsters but suffered the injury late in the match and was unable to
play the final against Serena Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Davenport rested the knee after the championships, resumed hitting
in December but reinjured the knee early last week.</TE>

<HD>Climate Appears Just Right for Ram Run to Super Bowl</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Weather? Who cares about the weather?</LD>
<LD>   The St. Louis Rams don't need to step outside for the rest of the
season--two games in the climate-controlled confines of their home
stadium and, assuming they win both, a finale at the Superdome.</LD>
<LD>   Their biggest concern is turnovers, which, for them, tend to come
in bushels. They had six in a loss to Tampa Bay and eight in a loss
to New Orleans. Hang onto the ball, and they should be hanging onto
the Lombardi Trophy.</LD>
<TE>   A look at the postseason field:</TE>
<TE>   The Favorites</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis (14-2)--The defenses that do well against the Rams are
those that rely on a great front four to put pressure on Kurt Warner,
allowing seven players to drop in coverage. Of the three NFC teams
that use that strategy effectively--New Orleans, Tampa Bay and the
New York Giants--only the Buccaneers are still around. If they win
their first-round game at Philadelphia, the Bucs are St. Louis-bound.</TE>
<TE>   The Ram to watch is defensive end Leonard Little, a converted
linebacker who hash 14.5 sacks in 13 games (a knee injury sidelined
him for three weeks), even though he's in only on passing downs.
Opponents are going to have to pay more attention to Little, who was
quick enough in the finale to chase down Atlanta's speedy Michael
Vick from behind.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh (13-3)--After throwing a league-low five interceptions
in his first 14 games, Kordell Stewart has thrown six in the past two
weeks. We'll find out if that's just a fleeting glitch or a return to
his old Keystone Kop days.</TE>
<TE>   Detractors in Pittsburgh are waiting for the bottom to fall out on
his dream season.</TE>
<TE>   Things are officially bad for kicker Chris Brown, who leads the
league with 14 missed field-goal attempts and has blown three PATs. A
lot of his problems have come at the open end of Heinz Field, where
the winds swirl with a vengeance. Only two opposing kickers--Gary
Anderson and Matt Stover--have made field goals there.</TE>
<TE>   The Steelers have a fantastic defense, but they tend to have
problems with quarterbacks who take a three-step drop and get rid of
the ball quickly. They like passers who hang on, hang on, hang on,
then disappear under a pile of defenders. Evidently, lots of
quarterbacks buy into that strategy; Pittsburgh boasts a league-best
55 sacks.</TE>
<TE>   Don't Count Them Out</TE>
<TE>   Green Bay (12-4)--The Packers have never lost a home playoff game,
and Brett Favre is 30-0 at Lambeau Field when the temperature at
kickoff is 34 degrees or colder. Two things that make him especially
effective in cold and/or wet weather: He has huge hands and he throws
a pinpoint, wind-cheating spiral. Ahman Green is a dangerous running
back who commands the attention of a defense, and he tends to play
well in crummy conditions. The Packers' soft spot? Receivers Bill
Schroeder and Antonio Freeman are average, and even Pro Bowl tight
end Bubba Franks doesn't strike fear in the hearts of defensive
coordinators. If Green Bay gets past San Francisco, it's bad news for
the Bears.</TE>
<TE>   New England (11-5)--He came out of nowhere--absolutely nowhere--to
rescue the Patriots, a team projected to finish no better than .500.
Far from being a household name, he was lucky to have a job when New
England signed him. Not quarterback Tom Brady, but running back
Antowain Smith. Cut by Buffalo last season and picked up by the
Patriots just before training camp, Smith has emerged as one of the
league's most reliable power backs. His ability to grind out yards
has taken a lot of pressure off Brady, the boy wonder of Beantown.
The No. 1 responsibility of Brady, who has thrown two touchdown
passes in five games: No critical mistakes. So far, it's working
beautifully.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago (13-3)--Jim Miller is one of the lowest-rated quarterbacks
in the league and, going by the numbers, is horrible in third-down
passing. But just as Trent Dilfer did for Baltimore last season,
Miller avoids turning over the ball and doesn't take unnecessary
risks. The Bears are feasting on the no-respect angle, constantly
referring to their us-against-the-world status. If they feel insecure
about their record, it figures. They have cornered the market on
lucky bounces and unbelievable finishes. Some people have crowned
Brian Urlacher the next Dick Butkus, but the guy playing in
Urlacher's shadow, Warrick Holdman, is one of the best-tackling
linebackers around.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco (12-4)--The 49ers are hurting for healthy defensive
ends, reminiscent of two years ago when they signed a rusty Charles
Haley for the playoffs. He was better than respectable. What should
they do now? What's Reggie White doing? It might not be a brilliant
personnel move (then again, who knows?) but it would be enormously
popular among sportswriters. Imagine, the 49ers heading to a
first-round game at Green Bay with White in tow. Story lines don't
get much better.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia (11-5)--The Eagles thumped Tampa Bay in the first
round of the playoffs last season, so the Bucs will be a welcome
sight for them this weekend. Donovan McNabb is developing a
reputation as a big-game quarterback, and Philadelphia's defense has
not surrendered more than two offensive touchdowns in a game this
season (including games against the Rams, Raiders and 49ers). The
biggest hole in the Eagles' game is running and stopping the run. It
doesn't help that they lost their best run-stopping tackle, Hollis
Thomas. Still, the Eagles should handle Tampa Bay and get to
Chicago--McNabb's hometown--for a second-round game.</TE>
<TE>   Wait Till Next Year</TE>
<TE>   Oakland (10-6)--The Raiders have lost three in a row and look
nothing like the team they were two months ago. They can't get their
running game going and their special teams have been a disaster
during the losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Miami (11-5)--With Daryl Gardner (neck) out, and Zach Thomas
nursing neck and shoulder injuries, the Dolphins will be hard-pressed
to stop the run. They just hope running back Lamar Smith has
something left and quarterback Jay Fiedler can limit his mistakes.
Neither is a given.</TE>
<TE>   New York Jets (10-6)--After winning at Oakland on Sunday, the Jets
chided New York reporters for writing them off. The writers might
have been hasty, but only by a week. The Jets can't generate enough
yards, and give up far too many, to survive in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Spoilers?</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay (9-7)--A second-round matchup with the Rams would make
for must-see TV, but first the Bucs have to win at Philadelphia. They
have never won a road playoff game and are 0-20 when the temperature
dips below 40 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore (10-6)--The Ravens did just fine relying on their
defense last season, and that same unit could put together another
postseason run. They beat Pittsburgh on the road this season, and did
a nice job of shutting down the Steeler running game.</TE>

<HD>Favre Says Strahan's Sack Was Legitimate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre swears he didn't take a dive
against the New York Giants, even if it did look like he gift-wrapped
Michael Strahan's record-setting sack Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   In the closing minutes of the game, "93-blast," a run play to the
left side, was sent in from the sideline. But Favre changed the
call--without telling anyone--from a handoff to Ahman Green to a
"keep-pass," where he rolls out on a bootleg to run with the ball or
pass it.</LD>
<LD>   Tight end Bubba Franks, thinking it was a run play, didn't block
Strahan, who simply fell on Favre when the quarterback tucked the
ball and went down.</LD>
<TE>   Favre said there was good reason not to tell any of his teammates
he was changing the call.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes the best keep-pass is when your line blocks the run and
has no idea," Favre said. "Sometimes if they know it's a keep, they
might peek back. That's not the first time I've faked a run without
anyone knowing. Sometimes it's the best play out there. I just wish I
was a little bit faster."</TE>
<TE>   Right tackle Mark Tauscher, who helped contain Strahan all
afternoon in the Packers' 34-25 victory, came the closest to
criticizing Favre.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just going to say it's disappointing. I'm not going to get
into anything else. It's disappointing," Tauscher said.</TE>

<TE>   The Detroit Lions fired defensive coordinator Vince Tobin after a
2-14 season in which the team gave up the second-most points in the
NFL.</TE>

<TE>   Kicker Sebastian Janikowski, who spent three days in the hospital
with a bacterial condition in his left foot, appears healthy enough
to rejoin the Oakland Raiders for the first round of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "He actually kicked before [Sunday's game against the New York
Jets] and said he felt good, but the decision was made not to have
him kick," Coach Jon Gruden said. "The plan is for Sebastian
Janikowski to be our kicker, and be ready to adjust."</TE>

<TE>   Quarterback Kurt Warner is expected to be ready for the St. Louis
Rams' playoff run, but is being told to avoid talking for a week
after taking a blow to the throat in the regular-season finale.</TE>
<TE>   Warner's voice was raspy after the 31-13 win over the Atlanta
Falcons. He said he took a knee or elbow to the throat early in the
game. He played the rest of the way, completing 25 of 30 passes for
280 yards and three touchdowns, though he did throw three
interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Later, team doctors discovered some bleeding of the vocal cords.
Team spokesman Rick Smith said it was a throat contusion and Warner
was told by doctors not to talk for seven days.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Florida's Roberto Luongo made 38 saves and the Panthers scored
quickly in the first two periods for a 2-1 victory over the Capitals
on Monday at Washington.</LD>
<LD>   Luongo recorded his 37th save on a shot by Peter Bondra after the
Capitals had pulled goalie Craig Billington with 24 seconds
remaining.</LD>
<LD>   Luongo capped a brilliant evening by stopping another shot from
Bondra with 14 seconds left.</LD>
<TE>   Washington squandered four power-play shots--including two from
directly in front of a fallen Luongo--midway through the third period
after Florida's Bill Lindsay drew an unusual unsportsmanlike conduct
penalty on a faceoff for twice swiping at Jaromir Jagr's leg.</TE>
<TE>   It took only 1:06 for Ivan Novoseltsev, who was unchecked in front
of the net, to score on the Panthers' second shot of the game off a
feed from behind the net by Niklas Hagman.</TE>
<TE>   The Panthers, who made the most of 18 shots, exploited the
Capitals' banged-up defense again early in the second period when
Pavel Bure took a cross-ice pass from Jason Wiemer and beat
Billington for a 2-1 lead at 1:28.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 4, Toronto 3--Defensemen Karel Rachunek and Wade Redden
each had two points at Ottawa as the Senators ended Toronto's
three-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa got goals from Andre Roy, Mike Fisher, Marian Hossa and
Rachunek despite directing only 16 shots at Curtis Joseph.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Roberts and Alexander Mogilny each had three points for the
Maple Leafs, who have lost eight of their last nine regular-season
games against the Senators.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Pittsburgh Penguins must wait a little longer for Mario
Lemieux's latest comeback.</TE>
<TE>   Lemieux, who said last week he was planning to return tonight
against Boston, isn't expected back until a Saturday home game
against St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Lemieux said Monday there is no problem with the surgically
repaired hip that has sidelined him for the last 22 games, but he
still isn't where he wants to be in his conditioning.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Florida Panthers traded defenseman Dan Boyle to the Tampa Bay
Lightning for a fifth-round draft pick in 2003. The Panthers also
recalled center Matt Herr from Hershey of the American Hockey
League.... New York Islander forward Steve Webb will have surgery
today for a broken hand and is expected to be out from six to eight
weeks.</TE>

<KH>ON THE NHL</KH>
<HD>Lindros Is Both Valuable and Risky for the Rangers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hours before the New York Rangers' Eric Lindros suffered the seventh
concussion of his career in a game against San Jose, Theo Fleury
talked about his linemate.</LD>
<LD>   "The concussion thing hasn't been an issue at all with Eric,"
Fleury said. "If you look at [Mighty Duck] Paul Kariya, who had to
sit out for a long time, he's come back and is playing well and no
one's talking about his [previous head injuries]."</LD>
<LD>   But later that night, Lindros did suffer another head injury, in a
first-period collision with San Jose's Mark Smith. The contact didn't
appear to be too damaging at first, but it turned out to be just the
type of innocent hit that points out the difference between Lindros
and Kariya.</LD>
<TE>   One player can't seem to avoid hits, the other works hard to avoid
them.</TE>
<TE>   "Eric is a physical player," Kariya said about his Canadian
Olympic teammate. "It's not like he can hide out there or play a soft
game."</TE>
<TE>   True. At 6 feet 4 and 240 pounds, Lindros is a muscular power
forward with great skill. He draws contact the way a magnet draws
nails. That's why the Rangers are taking a major risk by counting on
Lindros to lead them to the Stanley Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Richter has played like an Olympic goaltender. Brian Leetch
has returned to all-star form and Fleury is flying around the ice
like a youngster again. But Lindros has been the driving force behind
the Rangers' surge to the front of the pack in the Atlantic Division.</TE>
<TE>   If there were any doubt before Lindros had to sit out four games,
there shouldn't be now, seeing as how the Rangers went 1-3 without
him. When Lindros returned in the Rangers' 4-1 loss to Pittsburgh on
Saturday, he played tentatively, as he had during the exhibition
season.</TE>
<TE>   Lindros told Ranger broadcaster John Davidson that he'd known
immediately the extent of his latest injury, saying he knew it was
minor but wanted to be on the safe side because of his history.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a major concussion," he said. "I felt very confident in
the fact that things will return."</TE>
<TE>   When Lindros takes the ice on Wednesday for the Rangers' game
against the Kings at Madison Square Garden, expect him to be as
aggressive as he was before he sat down, complaining of a headache,
against the Sharks.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that I altered my game from the start [of the season],"
Lindros said. "I don't think I'm as physical [as before]."</TE>
<TE>   Kariya knows what it's like to return after having been sidelined
because of a head injury. In 1997-98, he sat out the 1998 Nagano
Olympics and the final 28 games of the NHL season because of
post-concussion syndrome. He did not return to the Ducks until the
start of the next season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been three years for me and I've gotten hit hard a lot of
times," Kariya said. "I didn't feel great afterwards, but I've never
had any symptoms of a concussion."</TE>
<TE>   Because of his well-documented experiences with concussions,
Kariya says Lindros is better prepared to deal with any problems he
has now. Once you sit out for a while, you're more aware, according
to Kariya.</TE>
<TE>   "No one can tell anyone else what to do," he said. "You have to be
yourself and consider your health. Eric has been through all of this
before. He knows what his body can take.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough situation because, obviously, Eric is a tremendous
competitor and one of the best players in the game. As a fan of the
game and a fan of him, you want to see him playing out there."</TE>
<TE>   Better Second Time Around</TE>
<TE>   Right wing Glen Murray, the former King who was shipped out in the
trade that brought in Jason Allison, has emerged as a consistent
scorer during his second tour of duty with the Boston Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   Murray played his first full NHL season with Boston in 1992-93,
but his playing time was shaky and he was traded to Pittsburgh in the
summer of 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "It's funny how things work out," Murray told the Boston Globe.
"You start your career and then you go away and come back. It's
different because I was so young. Before, I did play, but not in the
situations I do now. I feel like a big part of the team. You just
want to keep helping out."</TE>
<TE>   Skating on a line centered by Joe Thornton, Murray has 12 goals
and 25 points in 33 games with the Bruins, who have won seven of
their last nine games and moved into the No. 2 spot overall in the
Eastern Conference.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew it was going to be different coming back here because I
knew I was going to get a chance to play," he said. "Obviously,
getting to play with Joe and [Sergei Samsonov] has helped out a ton.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd never played with a left-handed-shooting centerman before.
It's kind of different, but it's working out great."</TE>
<TE>   Streaking Hurricane</TE>
<TE>   Carolina's Sami Kapanen has been on a tear. Over a recent six-game
scoring stretch, Kapanen had two goals and nine assists as the
first-place Hurricanes gave themselves some breathing room in the
Southeast Division.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran captain Ron Francis has seen a tremendous jump in poise by
Kapanen.</TE>
<TE>   "He's skating extremely well; handles the puck extremely well and
he can shoot the puck extremely well," Francis said. "Now he has the
confidence and belief that he's able to do that on a consistent
basis. Myself, and the rest of the team here are benefiting from that
process."</TE>
<TE>   In building a double-digit lead in points over the Washington
Capitals, Carolina has ridden Kapanen, who has climbed up the scoring
charts and was the league's No. 3 scorer with 45 points before
Monday's games.</TE>
<TE>   "With Sami, we have all sort of seen the talent and the ability he
had," Francis said. "It's a little bit of a growing process, and you
have to sort of experience some things and mature a little bit and
gain confidence in your game. I think that's just the biggest change
this year, he has so much more confidence in his ability on the ice."</TE>
<TE>   Line Shifts</TE>
<TE>   * The St. Louis Blues will skate into the Arrowhead Pond on
Wednesday with the stingiest defense in the league. With defensemen
Chris Pronger and Al McInnis holding things down, the Blues have
returned to a more basic style after flirting with becoming an
offense-first team.</TE>
<TE>   "We have got to play like we're in the playoffs now because that's
what this team is built to do," Pronger said. "We can't be playing a
run-and-gun game, you know, the way we kind of have the last few
years. Not playing very gritty, but playing a little bit more of a
finesse game and puck movement game."</TE>
<TE>   * The U.S. team made a respectable showing at the World Junior
Championships recently in the Czech Republic. The U.S. finished
4-1-2, losing only to gold-medal winning Russia. The U.S. defeated
Sweden, 3-2, in overtime, for fifth place.</TE>
<TE>   * Around Ottawa, Canada, Senator fans are hoping President-CEO Roy
Mlakar doesn't step down and return to Southern California to replace
Tony Tavares for Disney. Mlakar has local ties, including family, and
would be a good choice because of his hockey background and his love
of baseball.</TE>
<TE>   * Florida Coach Mike Keenan is already up to his old tricks,
letting it be known that he would love to have Ottawa's Shawn
McEachern and Boston's Bill Guerin in Panther uniforms. If Keenan
gets his way, Florida owners had better be ready to pay because
Guerin, who becomes an unrestricted free agent this summer, is
looking for a long-term contract starting at $8 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Quote of the Week</TE>
<TE>   "You look at that milestone and you wonder if anyone from my
generation</TE>
<TE>   could play that many games or have that sort of career. Everyone
has goals</TE>
<TE>   like those, but it's hard to imagine anyone can actually do it."</TE>

<HD>Kahle, Dierking Win in Novice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One performer continued a hot season and another made history at the
U.S. figure skating novice championships Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Danielle Kahle of Thousand Oaks, who led the competition after
Sunday's short program, held off Natalie Mecher and Lisa Danmiller in
the free skate to win the novice women's title.</LD>
<LD>   It was a third consecutive first-place finish this year for Kahle,
12, who won the novice Pacific Coast Championships and Southwest
Pacific Regionals before taking national honors at the Sports Arena.</LD>
<TE>   Mecher (second) and Danmiller (third) performed admirably but
could not catch Kahle, who had no dramatic errors or falls during her
three-minute program.</TE>
<TE>   "Once I got over the hard jumps I could just enjoy the rest of the
program," Kahle said. "I wasn't worried about winning or losing, I
just wanted to skate my best."</TE>
<TE>   In the novice men's division, Robert Dierking of Jamestown, N.Y.,
also avoided major mistakes in his free-skating program to overtake
Jason Wong for the men's title.</TE>
<TE>   In doing so Dierking, 13, who was third after the short program,
became the first skater to win a juvenile, intermediate and novice
championship in successive years.</TE>
<TE>   He was the juvenile winner in 1999, and the intermediate winner in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   His lone moment of trepidation came during a triple lutz, double
toe loop combination. On his second landing Dierking nearly fell, but
kept his balance, and nailed every jump that followed.</TE>
<TE>   "About three-fourths of the way through [the program] I knew I had
done well," Dierking said.</TE>
<TE>   Dierking then watched four other top skaters fall during their
free-skating programs.</TE>
<TE>   Wong, who slipped hard on the ice during warmups, fell twice
during his free skate to finish second.</TE>
<TE>   Evan Gibbs, ninth after the short program, had a strong effort in
the free skate and finished third.</TE>
<TE>   In other championship finals, Katie Boxwell and A. Williams Sears
won the novice pairs title, and Sarah Solomon and Benjamin Cohen won
the novice dance title.</TE>
<TE>   Shaun Rogers took the lead after the short program of the junior
men's championships at Staples Center.</TE>

<HD>Seifert Is Fired by Panthers</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>George Seifert's tenure as coach of the Carolina Panthers ended
Monday in the same way he spent much of the season--with his players
in the dark and most not really caring.</LD>
<LD>   It was that lack of energy and desire that cost Seifert his job.
He was fired Monday after three seasons capped by an NFL-record 15
straight losses in one season that owner Jerry Richardson said took
all the passion out of the franchise.</LD>
<LD>   "The energy has been sucked out of our organization and our fan
base," Richardson said. "We've lost 15 in a row.... We were 31st in
the league in offense and 31st in defense. It couldn't continue. I
had to make a change."</LD>
<TE>   Although the firing was expected, the players were the last to
know.</TE>
<TE>   Many said Seifert held his usual Monday morning meeting, never
mentioning his fate and acting as if he would be back next season.
But Seifert already knew his stint was done--Richardson said
discussions started between the two last Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "That's how he is, secretive, a to-the-vest kind of guy who holds
everything to himself," cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he was a players' coach."</TE>

<HD>Roaming Las Vegas With Ol' What's-His-Name?</HD>

<LD>Maybe you've seen my good friend Gene Wojawhogski--or however he
spells his name--on ESPN, or noticed his work in ESPN's (unreadable)
Magazine. He also tells me he's penned a number of books, but I
haven't met anyone who owns one.</LD>
<LD>   Now every time Gene Wojowhooski comes west he tries to convince me
to join him for a few days in Las Vegas, and this time I agreed as
long as he promised we would stay in one of the city's classier
hotels to make sure we didn't run into any Nebraska football fans.</LD>
<LD>   We had plans to meet Friday, but Gene Wojakillowski didn't arrive
until Saturday. That left me sitting alone in a Vegas hotel room
Friday, a big loser after betting the horses to kill time when my
cell phone rang. It was someone from Staples, who thought I was in
L.A. and on my way to the Laker game.</LD>
<TE>   "It's all been arranged," said the Staples Center official. "We're
finally going to get you together tonight with Salma Hayek."</TE>
<TE>   Tell me anyone has ever lost so much in one night in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AS YOU know, some people have all the luck. John Derek married
Ursula Andress, Linda Evans and Bo Derek while they were each in
their prime. Phil Jackson got Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, and
then Shaq, Kobe and Jeanie.</TE>
<TE>   I got Gene Wojaqueewski as a friend, and for all I know, he was
sitting in Staples Center Friday night with Salma--interviewing her
for his next book.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IT'S INCREDIBLE how lucky some people can be. For example, in
addition to being engaged to my daughter and one day having me as his
father-in-law, the grocery store bagger predicted right here before
the season began that Pittsburgh would win the AFC Central Division
and go on to win the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Right now the grocery store bagger thinks he's pretty smart. I saw
that same look on his face when I asked him on which aisle I could
find a can of three-bean salad, and he knew right away. I'm biased,
but I think the kid has a real future at Ralphs.</TE>
<TE>   As far as football goes, though, you and I know he's just lucky,
because there's no way anyone could have predicted in August that
Kordell Stewart would have what it takes to put the Steelers in
position to win the Super Bowl. Of course, I'd rather have him
thinking he's smart--than trying to get lucky.</TE>
<TE>   When I told Gene Wojo about the bagger's success in nailing the
Steelers, he suggested bringing the kid to Las Vegas, saying maybe
some of the bagger's luck might rub off on us.</TE>
<TE>   I have a little trouble thinking of the grocery store bagger as a
lucky charm. So I suggested to Wojo that the two of us--who worked
for competing newspapers covering the Broncos years ago--use just our
NFL expertise to wager on Sunday's games because, as Ralph Waldo
Emerson said, "Shallow men believe in luck."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, things didn't go well Sunday. But if I'm lucky, the
grocery store bagger will float me $20 until the end of the week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   RIGHT ABOUT now Jon Gruden is hoping they find a misrepresentation
in Tyrone Willingham's bio, so the Notre Dame job becomes available
once again.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CASEY WASSERMAN, owner of the Avengers and L.A.'s very own
favorite grandson when it comes to securing an NFL team for L.A.
again, was a guest on The SIMERS Show on Fox Sunday night. He
predicted New Orleans is the team most likely to move here and begin
play in the next three to five years.</TE>
<TE>   If you read his bio on the Avengers' website, however, it already
notes he owns OnSport, a sports business-consulting firm, and one of
his clients is the Chargers, who are contemplating a move to L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Now isn't that interesting.... "I have an ownership stake in the
company that is working with the team," Wasserman said Monday in
clarifying his relationship with the Chargers. "We're helping on the
business end, and it has nothing to do whether the Chargers move or
not."</TE>
<TE>   His bio also suggests he is a partner in the Pete Sampras Tennis
Academy, which is probably going to find a permanent home in the new
Cal State Dominguez Hills' project, which could also include a
training camp facility for the Chargers. Now isn't that
interesting....</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE DODGERS open the season at home against the Giants on April 2,
and it appears now they will probably be eliminated from the National
League race by the time Colorado comes to town April 5.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   APPARENTLY FOX must have thought that the reason Pete Carroll,
Mike Garrett and Bob Toledo have refused to come on The SIMERS Show
is because of host Todd Donoho. This would explain why they have
replaced Donoho with blabbermouth Barry LeBrock--check to make sure
my hair looks good--who is already bucking to have the show called,
The LeBROCK Show.</TE>
<TE>   As pretty as he is, some people should be seen and not heard.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE ROSE Bowl game between Nebraska and Miami will be shown
Wednesday at 6 p.m. on ESPN Classic. Classic?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Grady Birt:</TE>
<TE>   "As a Californian for Nebraska I was offended by [your] column
stating Nebraska fans were goofy and wore pink underwear. I'm
encouraging all Nebraskans who subscribe to The Times to cancel their
paper."</TE>
<TE>   To be honest, I can't really be sure they were wearing pink
underwear.</TE>

<HD>Growing Into Role, Hollins Is Now a Cut Above</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ryan Hollins of Pasadena Muir High should be a hero to every person
who has been cut from a basketball team.</LD>
<LD>   He has gone from unwanted to sometimes unstoppable. He has
transformed himself from a bench warmer to a top player on one of the
best high school teams in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   To say he has improved over the last three years wouldn't do him
justice.</LD>
<TE>   "It's night and day," Coach Don Grant said.</TE>
<TE>   Grant cut Hollins during tryouts for Muir's freshman team four
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "He was 6-2, super uncoordinated and couldn't catch the ball,"
Grant said.</TE>
<TE>   Hollins didn't give up on basketball. He started to grow. He was 6
feet 7 as a sophomore, 6-9 as a junior and reached 6-11 as a senior.</TE>
<TE>   He rarely played on Muir's junior varsity team as a sophomore. He
was a reserve on the varsity last season.</TE>
<TE>   But Saint Louis Coach Lorenzo Romar signed Hollins to a letter of
intent last November even though he had never started a game in high
school.</TE>
<TE>   Romar and others saw that Hollins had begun to figure out how to
use his body. The improvement has been startling. This season, he's
averaging 14 points and eight rebounds for the 15-0 Mustangs.</TE>
<TE>   Against Montebello Schurr, Hollins made 16 of 17 shots, had 15
rebounds and scored 33 points.</TE>
<TE>   It was a remarkable display of agility, coordination and
competence for a 17-year-old once judged not good enough to be given
a Muir uniform.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to show people I can play," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Grant is already convinced of Hollins' skills, but he doesn't feel
remorse for cutting him three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't always predict and project how tall a kid is going to
be," the coach said. "I think the one reason he's gotten to where he
is now is he didn't get frustrated. He's a competitive kid and
thrived on proving people wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Hollins has put on 25 pounds, increasing his weight to 205. He
predicts he'll reach 7 feet this year. He can run the court, make
medium-range jumpers, block shots and dribble when necessary.</TE>
<TE>   His growth spurt isn't the main reason he became a player. It was
his willingness to learn the basketball fundamentals that make a
difference.</TE>
<TE>   "It was hard work," he said. "In the summer, during the little
drills, other guys would laugh. I would take them serious. I might
not be able to do them right, but I was trying hard and they started
making sense."</TE>
<TE>   Passing drills, shooting drills, layup drills--Hollins worked on
every facet of his game.</TE>
<TE>   There's no denying the impact his size makes. He can't wait to
become a 7-footer.</TE>
<TE>   "That would be great," he said. "A half-inch more and I'll be
there."</TE>
<TE>   His growth spurt is a hassle when trying to find clothes. He had
two suits made for him when he was 6-8 and they no longer fit.</TE>
<TE>   "When I go to church, it's tight on me and I feel awkward," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   There's no more awkwardness to his basketball game.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a player," he said. "I can shoot, I can pass, I can run."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While Hollins is one of the tallest players in Southern
California, 14-year-old Drew Housman of Calabasas is one of the
shortest.</TE>
<TE>   He's 5-3, 110 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   "He looks like he's 12 or 13 but plays like he's 17 or 18," Coach
Russell White said.</TE>
<TE>   Any time Housman is on the court, there are whispers and stares.
Calabasas didn't have a varsity uniform small enough to fit him, so
he uses a jersey that barely hangs on his shoulders and reaches
almost to his knees if not tucked in.</TE>
<TE>   An injury to Calabasas' starting point guard pushed Housman into
the starting lineup for four games. During one stretch, he made eight
of nine three-point attempts.</TE>
<TE>   He knows his weaknesses. He understands opponents are going to try
to trap him and outmuscle him.</TE>
<TE>   But he has lots of strengths, from his basketball instincts to his
dribbling skills.</TE>
<TE>   "I've played with guys just as good on travel teams," he said.
"It's not like I get banged around a lot. Once they trap me, it's
tough to get out of it, but if I see it before it comes, I can avoid
it."</TE>
<TE>   Housman is a freshman who didn't get cut but had to prove he could
survive in a game of mostly big players.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Hollins, Housman is not going to be a seven-footer. He'd
settle for being a six-footer.</TE>
<TE>   "If I could get to six feet, that would be real good," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, like Hollins, he's not giving up basketball any time
soon.</TE>
<TE>   "You just stay calm and be smart, even though they might be bigger
than you," he said.</TE>

<HD>Stoops Rejects Florida, Remains at Oklahoma</HD>
<DH>College football: With Sooner coach out of the picture,
Gator athletic director turns his attention to Shanahan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Stoops said "No" to Florida on Monday, sending Athletic Director
Jeremy Foley to Denver to talk with Denver Bronco Coach Mike
Shanahan.</LD>
<LD>   Waiting anxiously back in Gainesville, Fla., are a handful of
players, including quarterback Rex Grossman, who want to see who the
Gators hire to replace Steve Spurrier before they commit to coming
back next year.</LD>
<LD>   "I would love to come back and play," Grossman said.</LD>
<TE>   "I am not ready to leave, but it may be the best decision for me
in the NFL. Who knows?"</TE>
<TE>   Grossman, the runner-up for the Heisman Trophy, said if Shanahan
were the coach, he would love to come back. But he needs to know by
Friday, the deadline for underclassmen to declare for the NFL draft.</TE>
<TE>   Receiver Taylor Jacobs, the most valuable player in the Orange
Bowl, is also wavering, after saying he would definitely come back.</TE>
<TE>   Foley wants to make a hire by Friday, as well--not only for the
sake of the players who are already Gators, but because recruiting
begins again in earnest on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   He knows he won't get Stoops, who was widely reported to be his
first choice. Foley traveled to Norman, Okla., early Monday to talk
to the Sooner coach, who was defensive coordinator for the Gators.</TE>
<TE>   When it was over, Stoops had decided to stay, although he denied
reports he had negotiated a new contract for a fat raise.</TE>
<TE>   "Jeremy knew coming in, I felt strongly committed to our program,"
Stoops said.</TE>
<TE>   When he arrived in Denver, Foley started working on Shanahan, who
became friends with the athletic director during his four seasons as
offensive coordinator at Florida in the early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously no offer, no nothing," Foley said. "We're friends and
we're going to talk. And you know, that's what's going to happen and
we'll see where it goes from there."</TE>
<TE>   Shanahan's contract pays about $4 million a year, and he would
almost certainly take a pay cut if he went to Florida.</TE>
<TE>   He has a new house in Denver, and his reputation is still strong,
even though the Broncos have had three consecutive disappointing
seasons on the heels of two straight Super Bowl titles.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier, who turned a Florida program that had been mediocre for
decades into one of the top, and most entertaining, programs in the
country over his 12 seasons, spoke to reporters Monday for the first
time since his sudden resignation Friday.</TE>
<TE>   He denied having an NFL job already lined up, but sounded as
though he knew something would come open soon.</TE>
<TE>   He said he had accomplished as much as he could at Florida, and it
was time to move on.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm intrigued to see if our style of offense, my style of
coaching, can be successful at the NFL level," he said. "I need to
find that out before I completely hang it up, before I call my last
play."</TE>

<HD>Walcott's Role Reduced</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enter Cedric Bozeman; exit Ryan Walcott.</LD>
<LD>   Bozeman's return after sitting out seven games because of a knee
injury apparently signals the end of Walcott's role as the first
point guard off the bench. Bozeman played 20 minutes as a reserve in
victories over Washington and Washington State last weekend and
Walcott never left his seat.</LD>
<LD>   Walcott, a redshirt freshman, averaged 10 minutes in the first
three games after Bozeman's injury, showing ballhandling and passing
skills. However, his playing time decreased even before Bozeman
returned, and he did not play against Georgetown on Dec. 29.</LD>
<TE>   "It will be more of a challenge to get Ryan into the games," Coach
Steve Lavin said. "But I won't hesitate to use different
combinations. He'll get opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   Lavin has used a nine-player rotation all season. Walcott, at this
point, is the 10th man.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bozeman started the first four games, but he has no problem with
coming off the bench for the foreseeable future.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just taking it slow and learning every day," he said. "It's
going to take some time."</TE>
<TE>   There is no urgency to change the lineup. The Bruins are 9-0 since
Bozeman was injured and fifth-year senior Rico Hines became a
starter.</TE>
<TE>   Although Hines has scored only 10 points, is shooting 17.2% and
has missed all 10 of his three-point shots, he is the team's best
defensive player and most vocal leader.</TE>
<TE>   "The intangibles Rico brings don't show up in the box score,"
Lavin said. "He's a special player. He takes charges, dives for balls
and plays with an intensity and maturity that come with experience."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The nine-game winning streak is UCLA's longest since 1997-98, when
the Bruins followed a 109-68 season-opening loss to North Carolina
with nine consecutive victories.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA also opened Pacific 10 Conference play 4-0 last season, the
only other time the Bruins won their first four in Lavin's six
seasons.</TE>

<LD>In jumping out to a 4-0 start in Pacific 10 Conference play, USC
swept Washington and Washington State by a combined 78 points.</LD>
<LD>   No. 11 UCLA, meanwhile, won its four games against the Huskies and
Cougars by a combined 35 points.</LD>
<LD>   A statistical edge to the Trojans as they prepare for their game
Thursday at the Forum against the Bruins, the only other unbeaten
Pac-10 team?</LD>
<TE>   "With the rivalry and all, all that is thrown out the window," USC
point guard Brandon Granville said. "It's going to be a war."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One of USC's fall signees has left his junior college team,
putting his future as a Trojan in jeopardy.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Wolfinger, a 6-foot-11, 225-pound forward at Ventura College,
did not return from the holiday break, leaving the fifth-ranked
junior college team without an explanation.</TE>
<TE>   "We got back from a holiday tournament Dec. 30 and he came in and
cleaned out his locker, so I haven't had any contact with him,"
Ventura Coach Greg Winslow said Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   "I know he was frustrated with some injuries and a lack of playing
time, but it's really unfortunate. I think he made a bad decision."</TE>
<TE>   Wolfinger, a native or Portland, Ore., transferred to Ventura from
St. John's.</TE>
<TE>   A sore hip and an abscessed tooth relegated him to the sidelines
for the first month of the season and he never really got into a
groove.</TE>
<TE>   As a junior college transfer, Wolfinger must complete his
Associate Arts degree to be eligible to play next season at USC.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC's three senior starters--Granville, small forward David
Bluthenthal and power forward Sam Clancy--continue to move up in the

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaun Powell of Newsday on the struggling New York Knicks:</LD>
<LD>   "What's really missing at the Garden this season is atmosphere.
It's not that intensity doesn't flare now and then at the corner of
33rd and Eighth.</LD>
<LD>   "But the night-in, night-out passion that once swirled inside the
building is gone, replaced by a passive crowd that doesn't expect
much from the home team anymore.</LD>
<TE>   "If the Garden indeed remains the place to be seen, it's
definitely not the building to be heard."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the NFL record for most touchdowns by a
rookie?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Will it help the hacker? Rick Telander in the Chicago Sun-Times:
"Are you ready for Callaway's soon-to-be-introduced HX ball?</TE>
<TE>   "The 'Hex' is the infant offspring of Steve Ogg, a former Boeing
aerospace engineer.</TE>
<TE>   "According to USA Today, 'on the cover of the ball Ogg created a
system of ridges that forms what Callaway calls a tubular lattice
network.' Can a miniature golf ball vineyard be far off ?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toilet Bowl game: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle:</TE>
<TE>   "Proposed: A postseason game between the two NFL teams with the
worst records. Reason: We can't get enough football. Plus, it would
provide motivation and interest for players of cruddy teams.</TE>
<TE>   "Besides, look at the Rose Bowl headlines. There's something pure
and cool about: 'Undisputed.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Take a cab: Gil LeBreton in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram:</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I made it. Thirty years of press boxes, and I finally made
it to the 'Granddaddy of Them All,' the storied Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "They call this the granddaddy, I'm assuming, because by the time
you find a parking space, you'll be one."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Why play it then? Heading into the bowl season, Bill Scheft of
ESPN the Magazine said no game was more aptly named than the GMAC
Bowl between Marshall and East Carolina--"because the matchup offers
0 percent interest."</TE>
<TE>   Comment from Tom FitzGerald of the San Francisco Chronicle:</TE>
<TE>   "Come to think of it, that also would describe the second half of
the Rose Bowl."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Also, "we wuz robbed": The Expedia online travel site is giving
English soccer fans Japanese-language tips for this year's World Cup,
London's Daily Telegraph reports.</TE>
<TE>   Phrases include "Who ate all the sushi?" and "Are you blind, ref?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1993, Michael Jordan scored 35 points
for the Chicago Bulls against the Milwaukee Bucks, becoming the 18th
NBA player to score 20,000 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Gale Sayers of the Chicago Bears, 22 in 1965.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Michael Wilbon of the Washington Post is not
convinced that Steve Spurrier will be a huge success as an NFL coach:</TE>
<TE>   "In college, he has two great advantages.</TE>
<TE>   "He could recruit speed from a talent pool that isn't available to
everybody. All college teams don't have the same access to the human
resources. And once he has those guys Spurrier can play all the mind
games he wants with them because he is in complete control of their
futures as potential professionals.</TE>
<TE>   "In the pros, players either laugh at college-level mind games or
they revolt."</TE>

<HD>Clippers Buried Without Praise</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: L.A. falls to 2-9 on road with 116-92 loss
to 76ers, who benefit from Iverson's first triple-double. Brand
admits he's hurting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>The Clippers made their first trip to the East this season, searching
for something more tangible than the grudging respect that seems to
follow them around the league these days.</LD>
<LD>   The praise is all well and good, but the Clippers are desperately
seeking victories away from the friendly rims, fans and officiating
at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   All they found Monday at the First Union Center was more misery
away from sun-soaked Southern California. The Clippers fell with a
thud to the Philadelphia 76ers, 116-92, before a crowd of 20,414.</LD>
<TE>   The loss was the Clippers' ninth in 11 road games. Only the Denver
Nuggets, who are 2-10, and the woebegone Chicago Bulls (0-17) have
worse road records.</TE>
<TE>   Power forward Elton Brand, who has been nursing a sore right elbow
the last week or so after taking a nasty fall, epitomized the
Clippers' struggles against the 76ers. Brand, who leads the team with
averages of 18.6 points and 11.1 rebounds, scored only nine points
and missed 10 of 14 shots. He also took 12 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   After several days of stoicism, Brand finally acknowledged he is
troubled by pain in his elbow. It was obvious to anyone who watched
him try to shoot the basketball Monday. All his baskets came on
tip-ins.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty painful," Brand said. "They've been trying to get me
to sit out. I thought I could help the team tonight. I don't want to
hurt the team."</TE>
<TE>   It's unlikely Brand, a former Bull, will miss tonight's game
against the Washington Wizards and another notable former Bull by the
name of Michael Jordan. The plan is for Brand to have his elbow
X-rayed, perhaps as soon as today, but more likely Wednesday, when
the Clippers travel to New York before facing the New Jersey Nets.</TE>
<TE>   "Anytime I do anything where I have to extend it," Brand said of
the pain in his right arm. "It hurts releasing the shot. It hurts on
free throws. It's anything where I'm extending."</TE>
<TE>   Playing without a fit Brand was difficult enough for the Clippers,
but Philadelphia's Allen Iverson recorded the first triple-double of
his career to make matters worse. No matter how the Clippers tried to
thwart him, including using a zone defense for a time, the man known
as "the Answer" solved it.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson went for 30 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds. He hit on
drives to the basket, including a spectacular reverse layup in the
first half. He also swished long-range jump shots.</TE>
<TE>   "Allen had a phenomenal all-around game," Philadelphia Coach Larry
Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   And since none of the Clippers did, the game quickly turned into a
runaway.</TE>
<TE>   Quentin Richardson led the Clippers with 21 points, but before the
game was over, they trailed by as many as 30.</TE>
<TE>   Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry wasn't around at the finish. He was
ejected with 8:31 remaining after receiving two technical fouls for
arguing with the officials. Iverson made both free throws and two
more after Earl Boykins fouled him, giving the 76ers a 93-68 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what he might have said or done to warrant the ejection,
Gentry bristled.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't say anything, not a single word," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers scored first on Corey Maggette's jump shot from the
right wing and never led again. Philadelphia led, 53-38, at halftime
and 83-64 after three quarters en route to its second victory over
the Clippers in less than two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The 76ers won at Staples Center on Dec. 26, the second game of a
seven-game trip.</TE>
<TE>   The 76ers returned Sunday to Philadelphia having lost four of
seven on their 13-day cross-country trip, with questions swirling
around them about Brown's future. Monday's victory was just the sort
of tonic the 76ers needed to put to rest, for a night at least,
thoughts of a future without Brown.</TE>
<TE>   "I was concerned about this game because I thought we would be
tired," Brown said. "We started out with so much life. I think when
you start out and it is too easy, it is very difficult if a team
comes back at you. We handled it extremely well."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers made one run at the 76ers, pulling within 32-31 after
Richardson's layup midway through the second quarter. But
Philadelphia rocketed away quickly, building its 15-point halftime
lead.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Win or Go Home: Sudden Death Baseball"</LD>
<LD>   Author: Gary R. Parker</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: McFarland &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $29.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Only eight times in the last 120 years of major league baseball
have teams tied for first, then squared off in a playoff to determine
a division or pennant winner. This book examines those playoffs and
the seasons leading up to them.</TE>
<TE>   The author grew up in Los Angeles and fell in love with baseball
as a fourth-grader in 1959. What did it for him was the National
League pennant race that year involving the Dodgers, who had moved to
Los Angeles from Brooklyn the previous year, and the Milwaukee
Braves. The Dodgers advanced to the World Series by beating the
Braves in the first two games of a best-of-three playoff .</TE>
<TE>   Parker, a freelance writer who lives in Palm Desert and works as a
publishing consultant for Sun Microsystems, is a typical baseball
fan. He is disillusioned by much that has transpired and is very much
against the wild-card playoff system that was introduced in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "The wild card has knocked a century of baseball tradition on its
ear and in the process done irreparable damage to a vital component
of the game's timeless appeal: its pennant races," Parker writes in
the introduction.</TE>
<TE>   Parker writes that he spent four years researching and writing the
book. He uses the playoffs as a backdrop to delve into a lot of
history and the people involved.</TE>
<TE>   The playoffs examined are the Dodgers-St. Louis Cardinals in 1946,
the Boston Red Sox-Cleveland Indians in 1948, the Dodgers-New York
Giants in 1951, the Dodgers-Braves in 1959, the Dodgers-San Francisco
Giants in 1962, the Red Sox-New York Yankees in 1978, the
Dodgers-Houston Astros in 1980, and the Seattle Mariners-Angels in
1995.</TE>
<TE>   The book includes forewords by Carl Erskine and Clem Labine, and
the well-researched text is supplemented by material gathered from
more than 30 interviews with players involved in the sudden-death
games. Also included are box scores from those games, plus some
interesting pictures and newspaper cartoons.</TE>

<HD>Five-Time U.S. Champion Eldredge Knows His Way</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a sport gone mad for spectacular quadruple jumps and garish
costumes, Todd Eldredge is a pair of loafers in a rack of
stiletto-heeled black leather boots.</LD>
<LD>   There's a thrill in wearing those heels, just as there's a thrill
in watching world figure skating champion Evgeni Plushenko of Russia
perform a quadruple-triple-double combination, or Russia's Alexei
Yagudin and U.S. champion Tim Goebel soar into the air on their
quads. But there's also a fear they will crash in a painful heap,
destroying the magic.</LD>
<LD>   Like those classic loafers, Eldredge is the comfortable fallback
who never goes out of style.</LD>
<TE>   The five-time U.S. champion and six-time world medalist is among
the masters of the underappreciated art of spinning, but he has
landed only two quadruple jumps in competition, at last season's
Masters of Figure Skating and Midwest Sectionals. If that's a dozen
or so fewer quads than his rivals have landed, who can say what
they'll be doing eight or 10 years from now, when they're 30, as he
is?</TE>
<TE>   While Yagudin, Plushenko and Goebel streak across figure skating's
landscape like comets, stretching the sport's technical limits,
Eldredge plugs away, steady and true. When others crash around him,
the Chatham, Mass., native picks up the pieces, as he did in winning
a bronze medal at last year's World Championships, a silver at the
national championships and a bronze at Skate Canada in November.</TE>
<TE>   It's entirely possible that scenario will be repeated at the Salt
Lake City Winter Olympics, allowing Eldredge to win the Olympic medal
he has chased since 1992.</TE>
<TE>   It's not too big a stretch to picture first-time Olympian
Plushenko alienating judges with his pelvis-thrusting antics and
fragmented music, as he did in finishing second to Yagudin at last
month's Grand Prix final at Kitchener, Canada. Or to imagine Yagudin
working himself into too high a state of anxiety to skate his best,
as he did at the Goodwill Games in Australia last autumn.</TE>
<TE>   And Goebel, who has undeniably advanced his artistry while
training with Coach Frank Carroll in El Segundo, might not have yet
persuaded international judges he is a complete enough skater to
merit a medal in his Olympic debut.</TE>
<TE>   Without too much difficulty, the planets could align so
Eldredge--even without a quad--could win the Olympic medal that
eluded him in 1998, when he faltered in the long program and finished
fourth, and in 1992, when he had a back injury and finished 10th.
Judges know him and respect his attention to the fundamentals of the
sport, and it's not farfetched to think they might be inclined to
reward him with a bronze medal.</TE>
<TE>   Eldredge's coach of more than 20 years, Richard Callaghan, has
heard that speculation. But Callaghan, whom Eldredge has followed
from Rochester, N.Y., to Philadelphia to Colorado Springs, Colo., to
San Diego to their current base of Rochester Hills, Mich., doesn't
limit Eldredge's sights to the third step of the podium.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's what everyone is thinking," said Callaghan, who
coached Tara Lipinski to a gold medal at Nagano in 1998. "I just know
... you can never underestimate him. You never know what's going to
happen. I just know when he's made his mind up in a crunch, he
usually does what he wants to do....</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone should have one [quad] in their arsenal. Whether under
the pressure of the Olympic Games everyone does it, that remains to
be seen."</TE>
<TE>   Eldredge smiles easily when asked if the competition at Salt Lake
City will be between the two Russians.</TE>
<TE>   "How many guys are there supposed to be [in the competition]?
Twenty-four? Then there are 24 guys who have a chance," he said. "I
don't see it being a 1-2 battle. Before the 1992 Olympics, it was
supposed to be between Kurt [Browning] and Viktor [Petrenko], and
Paul Wylie snuck into second place [between Petrenko and Petr Barna].
There are a lot of good skaters. On any given day, anyone can get in
there and get a medal."</TE>
<TE>   To get to Salt Lake City, Eldredge must finish in the top three at
this week's U.S. championships, which will determine the Olympic
figure skating team. He will begin that quest today at Staples Center
when he skates his short program.</TE>
<TE>   The 2-minute 40-second routine includes eight required elements
and can kill the chances of competitors who botch one of those spins
or jumps. It counts for 33% of the final score. The men will perform
their long programs, which account for the rest of their scores,
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Two Olympic spots are expected to go to Eldredge and Goebel.
Michael Weiss, who won the U.S. title in 1999 and 2000 while Eldredge
took a sabbatical from Olympic-eligible competition, is likely to vie
with Matt Savoie for the other berth.</TE>
<TE>   Sentiment will be on the side of Eldredge, who has represented the
Los Angeles Figure Skating Club since he trained in San Diego and was
awarded a lifetime membership for winning the bronze medal at the
1991 World Championships. Although he has had an admittedly bumpy
season that included error-filled performances at Skate Canada and
the Trophee Lalique competitions, he's determined to make his 12th
appearance at the U.S. championships a memorable one.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as nationals go, obviously I want to make the Olympic
team," he said. "That's my No. 1 goal. But I haven't won nationals in
a while [since 1998], and it would be nice for there to be no more
five-pack [of titles]. I want a six-pack.</TE>
<TE>   "The way I'm trying to approach it is, this is the last time I'm
going to do this, and I want to make it my best."</TE>
<TE>   Eldredge started skating when he was 5, switching within weeks
from hockey skates to figure skates because he liked to jump and
spin. The younger of two sons of a fisherman and his wife, Eldredge
pursued his expensive sport with the help of his seaside hometown,
which organized bake sales and other benefits to fund his dream. He
later returned the favor by financing a foundation that helps young
athletes in Chatham. In appreciation, the town named a baseball
diamond for him.</TE>
<TE>   His mother knew Callaghan's mother-in-law, and the two agreed that
Callaghan should accept the youngster at a summer skating academy
Callaghan was conducting in Rochester, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw a little kid that loved to skate and just worked really
hard," Callaghan said. "He had good talent and was so disciplined for
10 years old."</TE>
<TE>   Eldredge soon went to Philadelphia to work with Callaghan. Their
collaboration resulted in Eldredge's winning the U.S. novice men's
title in 1985, when he was 13, and the U.S. junior title in 1987,
when he was 15. That same year, he finished second to Rudy Galindo at
the world junior competition. In 1988 he won the world junior title
and finished eighth at his first senior-level U.S. competition.</TE>
<TE>   He won the 1991 U.S. title and was a favorite to repeat in 1992,
but had to withdraw because of a back injury. He was given a bye into
the Albertville Games because he was the defending national champion,
but he finished 10th.</TE>
<TE>   He again fell victim to misfortune in 1994. A severe case of flu
and a fever of 104 degrees sapped his strength during the U.S.
competition, where he finished fourth, missing the team that went to
the Lillehammer Games.</TE>
<TE>   Undaunted, he won the U.S. titles again in 1995 and 1997, as well
as the 1996 world crown. He won the 1998 U.S. title, even though he
fell on his planned quad, and had a good start at Nagano, standing
third after the short program. However, he couldn't hold it together
in the long program, reducing the difficulty of two combination
jumps, opening up on a triple axel and falling on an improvised
triple axel.</TE>
<TE>   Disappointed, he temporarily left the pressure-packed world of
Olympic-eligible skating to skate in pro-ams and shows.</TE>
<TE>   There are parallel skating universes: competitions for
Olympic-directed skaters, such as the U.S. championships and Grand
Prix events, and pro-ams, in which skaters who keep their Olympic
eligibility compete against skaters who gave up their eligibility and
turned professional. Then there are the pro-ams and shows, where
jumps tend to be simpler, and the pressure is reduced. Without the
duress of Olympic-style competition, Eldredge renewed himself
mentally and physically.</TE>
<TE>   "The time away is why he's getting better presentation marks now,"
Callaghan said. "He's had time to be more in tune with the audience,
to present his music and his material better, and he's more
comfortable in displaying his new presentation talent."</TE>
<TE>   Upon his return in the 2000-01 season, he finished second to
Goebel at the U.S. championships and third at the world meet, behind
Plushenko and Yagudin and one place ahead of Goebel.</TE>
<TE>   "I was able to learn some new things and incorporate new things
without worrying, 'I've got to do eight jumps,'" he said. "Now I know
I can do all those different things, and you find out your style and
what works best."</TE>
<TE>   His season up to now, he said, has been so-so.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, it could have been better, not so much the placements,
but the performances," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He has performed his "Carmina Burana" short program several times
but didn't debut his "Lord of the Rings" routine until the Grand Prix
final, after he'd scrapped another program to "Band of Brothers." He
was fourth at the Grand Prix finale, skating well only in his "1492"
long program in the three-part competition.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing I kind of wanted to do is peak at the end," said
Eldredge, who was lucky to finish third at Skate Canada and equally
fortunate to finish second in a weak field at the Trophee Lalique. "I
haven't skated quite up to normal early, but I feel things are
progressing....</TE>
<TE>   "[Plushenko and Yagudin] have to go out at the Olympics and do
their quads. It's not like they do them every single time they go out
there. Obviously, they do them more often, but it's definitely a case
of how an individual skates that night. Maybe at Salt Lake City, I'll
have a little bit of help from American fans, and there will be a lot
of energy and feeling. Who knows what could happen?"</TE>

<LD>We'll think we are hearing her music. We aren't.</LD>
<LD>   When Angela Nikodinov takes to the ice at the U.S. Figure Skating
Championships this week, the loudspeakers will blare classical, but
her mind will play oldies.</LD>
<LD>   Cackling from a car radio. Driving from Lake Arrowhead to San
Pedro. Sung loud and off-key and absolutely perfectly by her best
friend and coach, Elena Tcherkasskaia.</LD>
<TE>   "She would know all the words, even if they didn't sound like all
the words," recalled Nikodinov. "She would grab my hand and say, 'We
sing, Muska, we sing.'"</TE>
<TE>   We'll think she is hearing our cheers. She's not.</TE>
<TE>   Amid thousands of voices filling Staples Center for the local girl
who learned to skate at a mall, Nikodinov will hear only one.</TE>
<TE>   The only voice that ever convinced her that she was strong. The
only voice that made her believe she was beautiful.</TE>
<TE>   A voice that she can now only recognize when she closes her eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "She would call me 'My little angel,'" Nikodinov recalled. "Nobody
has ever called me that before."</TE>
<TE>   We'll think we understand her grace. We won't have a clue.</TE>
<TE>   For even the most unburdened athletes, it will be difficult enough
this week to execute precise moves under monster pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Now try that triple lutz with grief laced to your skates.</TE>
<TE>   Angela Nikodinov, 21, who finished third in last year's nationals
and fifth in the worlds, will contend for one of the top three
Olympic berths in women's singles.</TE>
<TE>   But she will do so while hauntingly skating pairs with Elena
Tcherkasskaia, her coach who died in Moscow on Nov. 12 of pancreatic
cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like I still don't believe it," Nikodinov said. "Like, to
me, it's still not real."</TE>
<TE>   Of course not.</TE>
<TE>   Because Nikodinov was never told Tcherkasskaia was gravely ill.</TE>
<TE>   Even Tcherkasskaia was never told.</TE>
<TE>   They both thought the 64-year-old coach was being treated for a
hernia or a blood disorder.</TE>
<TE>   Leonid Tcherkasskaia thought it would be easier for his wife and
her pupil if they didn't know.</TE>
<TE>   Two months and several desultory competitions later, Nikodinov
thinks, this is easier?</TE>
<TE>   "I know I should realize this has happened," she said during a
recent interview at the HealthSouth training center in El Segundo.
"But I still can't."</TE>
<TE>   Nikodinov never imagined that, on Sept. 29, when Tcherkasskaia
boarded a plane for Moscow for treatment of this supposedly unknown
illness, it would be the last time she would see her.</TE>
<TE>   She remembers waving as the car left her San Pedro driveway for
the airport.</TE>
<TE>   Said the coach, "Goodbye, my little angel."</TE>
<TE>   Recalled Nikodinov, "If I had known what was happening, I would
have locked her in my room, not let anybody take her anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Six weeks later, Nikodinov remembers being given the news in a
hotel in Germany, shortly before she'd thought she and Tcherkasskaia
would be meeting at a competition.</TE>
<TE>   It came from her father in a 7 a.m. phone call. He was crying. She
couldn't understand.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'She's dead? How can she be dead!'" Nikodinov
recalled. "I slammed down the phone. I couldn't breathe."</TE>
<TE>   She was so surprised and upset, she began throwing things against
a wall. Then she ran outside to a balcony. One team official was
fearful she would leap.</TE>
<TE>   She couldn't bear to attend the open-casket funeral. For four
days, she couldn't bear to leave her bed. For one of the most
important months of training, she couldn't bear to hire a new coach.</TE>
<TE>   She still has a photo of Tcherkasskaia on the computer screen
saver in her San Pedro bedroom. She still has her photos of the two
of them on her car's visor.</TE>
<TE>   It's now about goodbye.</TE>
<TE>   To the woman who, she says, changed her life, she never said
goodbye.</TE>
<TE>   Before she can skate forward toward an Olympic podium that once
seemed her destiny, she needs that goodbye.</TE>
<TE>   This week, with everybody watching and nobody understanding, she
will try again.</TE>
<TE>   There was a memorial service, a couple of days before Christmas,
in a Lake Arrowhead lodge near the home owned by Elena Tcherkasskaia
and Angela Nikodinov.</TE>
<TE>   It was Nikodinov's first chance to address her loss.</TE>
<TE>   The setting was perfect.</TE>
<TE>   Several top skaters were there, including Timothy Goebel and
Michelle Kwan.</TE>
<TE>   Other teachers and friends were there, in tribute to the former
Bolshoi ballerina who touched so many skaters with her choreography.</TE>
<TE>   Someone read a letter from former pupil Nicole Bobek.</TE>
<TE>   Someone else read a poem.</TE>
<TE>   There was a video. There was a prayer.</TE>
<TE>   Nikodinov watched it all from a fourth-row seat between Goebel and
new Coach Frank Carroll.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone else want to say anything?" asked the Rev. Randy Buechler.</TE>
<TE>   Nikodinov shuffled her legs. She hid her face. She couldn't move.</TE>
<TE>   "I said to myself, 'Get up!' But I couldn't get up," she said. "I
said it again. 'Get up!' But I couldn't get up."</TE>
<TE>   So it has been with her skating since Tcherkasskaia's death.</TE>
<TE>   She has started each competition strong, then faded.</TE>
<TE>   She finished third in three events, but did not qualify for the
prestigious Grand Prix Final, matching the best six female skaters in
the world.</TE>
<TE>   "When Elena was standing over there, I could feel her energy and
her power," Nikodinov said. "Without her, I felt naked."</TE>
<TE>   Last month she hired the famed Carroll to help her find her
balance.</TE>
<TE>   Recently spurned by longtime pupil Michelle Kwan, Carroll
understands something about loss.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not a miracle worker," he said. "I can only tell Angela,
'Put all those emotions in a fist and take them to a trash can and
put them in the can.'"</TE>
<TE>   He sighed.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are easy words to say, but very difficult to do."</TE>
<TE>   Especially when you are skating a long program to "Giselle" ...
and your late teacher once was Giselle.</TE>
<TE>   They began working together at Lake Arrowhead in the summer of
2000, with an atypically casual beginning for a relationship so
special.</TE>
<TE>   There was no contract. No handshake. No promises.</TE>
<TE>   Nikodinov had just left Coach Richard Callaghan because, she says,
she didn't like living in Detroit, his home base. She was, by most
accounts, a great athlete without great flair.</TE>
<TE>   Tcherkasskaia, a longtime famed choreographer, understood flair.</TE>
<TE>   Nikodinov couldn't express herself like a dancer.</TE>
<TE>   Tcherkasskaia couldn't skate.</TE>
<TE>   "We were an amazing team," Nikodinov said.</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, by the end of their second year together, Nikodinov
had risen from great potential to great resume.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen such a change," said Ice Castle publicist Cindy
Lang. "Angela didn't change into a different person. She changed into
herself."</TE>
<TE>   Uncertain moves became confident ones. The athlete became a
storyteller.</TE>
<TE>   "She turned her into a lady," said Nikodinov's mother, Dolores.</TE>
<TE>   So much that Dolores admits her husband became jealous.</TE>
<TE>   "They would come home to San Pedro and run into Angela's bedroom
giggling about something," she recalled. "Elena would tell us that
she knew all of Angela's secrets."</TE>
<TE>   The women traveled together, shopped together, worked together,
but mostly laughed together.</TE>
<TE>   "She had no children, so I became her daughter," Nikodinov said.
"The boys would come around and she would say, 'Five meters! Every
boy must stand back five meters!'"</TE>
<TE>   Being the good daughter, in late September Nikodinov prompted
Tcherkasskaia to see a doctor.</TE>
<TE>   Tcherkasskaia had spent about a week in bed, exhausted. Her chest
burned. Her face, always so bright and expressive under a baseball
cap, was dull and lifeless.</TE>
<TE>   Nikodinov practiced at the rink every day in front of an empty
chair draped with Tcherkasskaia's coat. They thought it was only flu.</TE>
<TE>   "Finally, I knew she was too sick, and I ordered her to get into
the car," Nikodinov said. "She didn't want to go. I made her go."</TE>
<TE>   They drove through rush-hour traffic from Lake Arrowhead to
Torrance for afternoon tests.</TE>
<TE>   That night, at midnight, the phone rang in Nikodinov's home.</TE>
<TE>   It was a doctor, telling Nikodinov's father that Tcherkasskaia was
very sick. The next call was to Tcherkasskaia's husband, Leonid, in
Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   "Then her husband called us from Moscow and told us it was
pancreatic cancer, but that we couldn't tell either of them about
it," Dolores recalled. "It was very hard. I cried about it. But what
could I do? We had to make up a story even to get Elena back to
Moscow for treatment."</TE>
<TE>   Nikodinov and Tcherkasskaia talked every day while she was in a
Moscow hospital. The teacher sounded more sedated each day, but kept
explaining that she was only having blood work.</TE>
<TE>   "People starting asking me whether she had cancer, and I said,
no," recalled Nikodinov. "That was not even on my mind."</TE>
<TE>   Then, in an instant, it became her life.</TE>
<TE>   "I know she would want me to get through this, to move forward and
succeed," Nikodinov said. "Sometimes it doesn't work. But I'm
trying."</TE>
<TE>   While watching Nikodinov skate, Tcherkasskaia used to clutch a
little wooden icon in her purse.</TE>
<TE>   Just before skating, Nikodinov would clutch her own icon, a blue
stone eye on a necklace that was given to her by her coach.</TE>
<TE>   Tcherkasskaia was buried with her icon.</TE>
<TE>   Nikodinov clutched hers throughout the interview.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an evil eye, given to me to keep away the bad stuff," she
said. "For me now, this is Elena."</TE>
<TE>   She squeezed it hard, then soft.</TE>
<TE>   "She would say, 'Muska, you can do this. You can do this.'"</TE>

<HD>Ravens Get the Swagger Back in Time</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Baltimore beats Vikings, reaches playoffs as
wild card and can't shut up about it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>You can't shut up the Baltimore Ravens. Turns out, you can't shut
them out of the playoffs, either.</LD>
<LD>   The well chronicled, high-volume season of the defending Super
Bowl champions, which began with an inside-look training camp
documentary on HBO, came down to the NFL's last regular-season game.</LD>
<LD>   By beating the Minnesota Vikings, 19-3, on Monday night, the
Ravens secured the AFC's final wild card. (Of course, the night
included NFL Films microphoned footage of Ravens Ray Lewis and
Shannon Sharpe during the pregame and halftime.) They will play the
Dolphins in Miami on Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   When the Seattle Seahawks and New York Jets won Sunday, it forced
the Ravens (10-6) to win this game or else sit out the postseason.</TE>
<TE>   They're in. And once again, it's on.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a ticket to the dance," defensive lineman Tony Siragusa
said. "Next stop is New Orleans."</TE>
<TE>   It was a minute after earning the right to play by squeaking by
the directionless Vikings, and they were thinking of the Super Bowl
site.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel confident," Raven Coach Brian Billick said. "We'd better
go in with a swagger, or don't go in. Otherwise you're going to get
your [butt] kicked, so why go?"</TE>
<TE>   "You get hot, a team gets hot, they can ride this thing out, kind
of like we did last year," Sharpe said. "We hope lightning strikes
twice."</TE>
<TE>   That would be two more times than the Raven offense did Monday.
Most of the point production came from four Matt Stover field goals.
They couldn't put the ball in the end zone despite running 12 plays
inside the Minnesota 11-yard line in the first three quarters.</TE>
<TE>   That was still better than the Vikings, who blew a perfect shot
with 1:05 left in the second quarter. Minnesota got the ball on the
Baltimore 10-yard line after Raven punter Kyle Richardson bobbled a
low snap and then fell on the ball on fourth down.</TE>
<TE>   But on Minnesota's next play, quarterback Spergon Wynn underthrew
Randy Moss in the end zone and Chris McAlister intercepted.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, the Ravens found some offense and Brandon Stokley took
an Elvis Grbac pass 46 yards, the key play in a 60-yard drive that
gave the Ravens their third field goal of the game, just as the first
half expired.</TE>
<TE>   The Vikings looked to be an easy target. They didn't have a shot
at the playoffs. You could say they were playing for pride, but how
much pride could a team that already lost to the Panthers and Lions
have left?</TE>
<TE>   Plus, they had all sorts of off-the-field issues, beginning with
Coach Dennis Green being forced out late last week. Green jumped
before he could be pushed, and negotiated a $5.4-million buyout to
soften the landing.</TE>
<TE>   Offensive line coach Mike Tice was named interim head coach. In
interviews with television and print reporters at halftime, Viking
owner Red McCombs said Tice is a strong candidate to get the job
full-time. McCombs cited his strong working relationship with Tice,
who joined the Viking staff two years before McCombs bought the team
in 1998. A Viking source said Tice is the favorite for the job.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys play hard for him, the guys love him," wide receiver
Cris Carter said. "He's got a great rapport with the players. Randy
[Moss] and  Daunte [Culpepper] like him, and that says a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Put it this way: Tice's chances of staying look better than
Carter's. Carter said he will void his contract and give the Vikings
the first chance to re-sign him, but that he also wants to play for a
contending team.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Vikings are really rebuilding," Carter said. "I think
we went from transition to rebuilding."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Ravens could be returning to Super Bowl form.
That's only because they're getting back to the formula that won the
championship last year: Iron-clad defense and ball-control offense.</TE>
<TE>   The offense didn't put the ball in the end zone Monday night, but
it did produce 212 yards rushing (133 by Terry Allen) and didn't have
a turnover.</TE>
<TE>   And the defense held Minnesota to 179 yards and scored the game's
only touchdown, a late fumble return by linebacker Jamie Sharper.
Peter Boulware had four sacks to finish as the AFC leader with 15.</TE>
<TE>   With Wynn (the replacement for the injured Culpepper) struggling,
Carter and Moss caught only seven passes between them.</TE>
<TE>   So the Ravens still have a chance, overcoming a rash of injuries
that included one to Jamal Lewis, last year's top rusher.</TE>
<TE>   "We're definitely a team to be dealt with," Sharpe said. "We might
not be the team to beat, but we're the team to deal with."</TE>
<TE>   So there you go. The Ravens are in the playoffs. Deal with it.</TE>

<HD>Secessionists, City Told to Resolve Terms of Breakup</HD>
<DH>Talks: If the Valley activists and L.A. officials can't agree,
LAFCO may set the conditions for them, Yaroslavsky warns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The head of a panel drafting terms for San Fernando Valley cityhood
advised secessionists and Los Angeles city officials Monday to resolve
their disputes over terms of the split or risk conditions they might not
want.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who heads a
subcommittee of the Local Agency Formation Commission, also suggested
that the Valley and Harbor areas may have to let Los Angeles continue
providing sewer service without dividing ownership of the sewer lines.</LD>
<LD>   Yaroslavsky weighed in on the secession issue as his panel began
deliberating terms of a possible municipal divorce. Valley VOTE President
Jeff Brain and Los Angeles Chief Legislative Analyst Ron Deaton detailed
for the panel where the two sides agree and where they disagree,
including sewers.</LD>
<TE>   "I just want to caution you against gamesmanship," Yaroslavsky told
representatives of both sides.</TE>
<TE>   If the two sides fail to agree on how to divide assets and
liabilities, it will be left to LAFCO to set terms and conditions to
accomplish those tasks.</TE>
<TE>   "You are better off [reaching agreement] than taking a chance on what
we are going to recommend," Yaroslavsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Valley VOTE prefers the creation of a joint-powers authority under
which the Valley would share ownership of the sewer system with Los
Angeles, Brain said. That would protect the Valley from discriminatory
rates, he told the panel.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO Executive Director Larry Calemine told the panel that the Valley
VOTE proposals do not appear practical or legal.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky said the issue might be settled by a requirement that Los
Angeles charge the Valley the same rates charged in the rest of the city
while maintaining full ownership of the system.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a logic to it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The county counsel is researching whether LAFCO has the power to
require uniform sewer rates. City officials have questioned whether the
agency has that authority.</TE>

<LD>A pickup truck belonging to a possibly suicidal Long Beach woman
missing since Wednesday was found near the Manhattan Beach pier Sunday
evening, and police said neighbors reported it had been parked since
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the husband of Jerri Antoinette Taylor, 47, said checks on
credit card charges had led to a Long Beach hotel that she apparently
stayed in the first night after leaving home.</LD>
<LD>   Taylor, who is about 5 feet 6 inches tall, weighing nearly 200 pounds,
with brown eyes and black, curly hair, about shoulder length, left a note
saying, "The world would be better off without me," before leaving home.</LD>
<TE>   A Long Beach police spokeswoman, Jana Blair, said there has been no
sign of foul play in the case, and expressed hope that Taylor would be
found alive and unharmed.</TE>

<LD>   About 1,500 low-income students--500 of whom are disqualified from

<LD>You may recall my story about a colleague who bought a device for
taping phone conversations on the basis of this testimonial from the
store clerk:</LD>
<LD>   "I can guarantee it. This is the very model Linda Tripp used to tape
Monica Lewinsky."</LD>
<LD>   By coincidence, I heard from a couple of readers who have received
letters asking them to donate money to the Linda Tripp Legal Defense
Fund. No, really. Tripp says the legal battles over her taping case have
left her busted. Sure enough, I found her Web site, which displayed a mug
shot of the new, slimmed-down Linda (see photo).</LD>
<TE>   And then it occurred to me: The solution for her money problems is
obvious. She should become a celebrity spokesperson for Radio Shack!</TE>
<TE>   I'm pleased I was able to contribute my two cents' worth to the
defense fund.</TE>
<TE>   What kind of bait was used, anyway? In his hometown newspaper, James
Moore of Long Beach read about a fisherman's catch that must have been
difficult to reel in (see accompanying). A Ford--can you believe it? Now,
a Plymouth Barracuda I could understand.</TE>
<TE>   Aging, Hollywood style (cont).: Grace Hampton of Burbank points out
that Nina Foch played the mother of Moses (Charlton Heston) in "The Ten
Commandments," though she was less than six months older than him. (What
about thou shalt not fib about your age?)</TE>
<TE>   And Hampton adds that in "Taras Bulba," Yul Brynner (b. 1915) played
the father of that famous Brooklyn Cossack warrior Tony Curtis (b. 1925).</TE>
<TE>   The pressure's really on now: When I misstated UCLA's football record
the other day, I pointed out that the late Times columnist Jack Smith
used to allow himself three mistakes a year.</TE>
<TE>   To which David Johannsen of Torrance writes: "Surely you're kidding. I
recall it was only two. And if I'm right, you've now used up your quota
for the year!"</TE>
<TE>   Milestones in pest control: I mentioned that the Burgundy Room in
Hollywood was named on Stuff Magazine's prestigious list of the "20 Best
Dives in America," largely due to the barmaids' willingness to "douse the
bar rail with lighter fluid and set it ablaze."</TE>
<TE>   Which prompted David Echt to recall "a visit of some 25 years ago to
the Formosa Cafe (seen in 'L.A. Confidential'). When I pointed out a
cockroach scooting across the bar, the bartender trapped it in an
upside-down glass, poured 151 rum all around it, released the bug and
simultaneously ignited the rum with a lighter. We switched to beer."</TE>
<TE>   Only in L.A.--lighting up your life!</TE>
<TE>miscelLAny:</TE>
<TE>   The day after Miami crushed Nebraska in the Rose Bowl, Lori Golden of
the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce encountered two tourists in T-shirts
that showed Florida beach scenes.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, you're the champions," Golden said.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, we're from Nebraska," one replied. "We decided to go
incognito."</TE>

<LD>An apartment house undergoing construction near the Beverly Center
was largely destroyed in a lunchtime fire Monday that sent a heavy pall
of smoke over portions of West Los Angeles and Beverly Hills.</LD>
<LD>   The blaze, in the 300 block of South Willaman Drive in Los Angeles,
caused no injuries but drew the largest turnout of firefighters--nearly
200 in all--since the Palomar Hotel fire last year in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Fire Capt. Steve Ruda said 29 companies from Los Angeles
city and county and the city of Beverly Hills took two hours and seven
minutes to extinguish the blaze in the four-story building.</LD>
<TE>   Scores of people were evacuated from nearby apartment houses. Ruda
said a few workers on the site escaped.</TE>
<TE>   He said there was only light damage to nearby buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey said the building could be a
total loss, although it was possible that part of the foundation could be
saved.</TE>
<TE>   Assessor's records showed the property is owned by Willaman Mews
Cottages LLC, and that its sale price as vacant land was $530,000.</TE>
<TE>   Humphrey said the cause of the blaze was under investigation, although
some witnesses said they saw flames coming from an electrical transformer
as the fire began shortly before noon.</TE>
<TE>   "This building was in the frame wrapping stage, there was a great deal
of building material on site, so this was a very combustible scene and
highly dangerous," Ruda said.</TE>
<TE>   Zieve Sherman, a worker in a nearby building used by Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center doctors, said it "looked like it might be electric,
because we saw blue sparks coming from lines surrounding the apartment
building even before the fire really got going."</TE>
<TE>   Another witness, Carlo Marino, manager of a nearby restaurant, said a
construction worker told him he thought the fire had started in the
transformer.</TE>
<TE>   Ruda said so much water was poured into the building as flames leaped
high into the air that firefighters feared a collapse of the structure.
He said fire units would stand by the smoldering structure through the
night.</TE>
<TE>   Police cordoned off several major streets, including 3rd Street, San
Vicente Boulevard and Burton Way for two hours, and even channeled
traffic on La Cienega Boulevard for a time, causing major traffic tie-ups
in the vicinity.</TE>

<HD>Pilot in ID Fraud Case Is Indicted</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Middle Eastern pilot being held in Arizona for alleged identity
fraud violations that came to light in the probe of the Sept. 11
terrorism attacks has been indicted in Los Angeles on two additional
charges.</LD>
<LD>   Malek Mohamed Seif, also known as Malek Mohamed Abdallah, was indicted
Thursday by a Los Angeles federal grand jury for allegedly lying to the
Immigration and Naturalization Service about his background to obtain
political asylum in 1998, a spokesman for the Phoenix U.S. attorney's
office said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The new charges were filed in California because the asylum paperwork
was filed here.</LD>
<TE>   Seif, 36, already faced dozens of charges of making false statements
to obtain a Social Security card and engaging in mail and financial
fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The Djibouti national has pleaded not guilty to the Arizona charges.
His attorney, Tom Hoidal, said Monday that he expects his client to
contest the California charges as well.</TE>
<TE>   The new indictment alleges Seif falsely claimed he was a Somali, fled
persecution in his homeland and lived in a Kenya refugee camp for several
years. In fact, he traveled to and from the U.S., trained as a pilot and
worked in Arizona, according to the charges.</TE>
<TE>   Hoidal said the asylum application was signed by a document preparer,
and it is unclear what information provided the INS actually came from
Seif.</TE>
<TE>   Seif has been behind bars since late October, when he was arrested
after agreeing to return to Phoenix from Europe. He left the United
States shortly before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Seif has not been accused of involvement in terrorism. But he has
acknowledged knowing one of the men suspected of hijacking planes on
Sept. 11, as well as a man suspected of training some of the attackers.</TE>
<TE>   Trial is set for later this month in Phoenix on the false identity
case. It is not clear whether the new case will be heard in Los Angeles
or consolidated into the Arizona case.</TE>

<HD>Man Opens Rear Door of Moving Jet</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A New Orleans man was taken into custody Monday after he allegedly
opened the rear door of a moving Southwest Airlines jet as it was cleared
for takeoff at Los Angeles International Airport.</LD>
<LD>   The man, 36, who was apparently intoxicated, was arrested after the
pilot turned the Las Vegas-bound jet around and returned to a gate, said
Matt McLaughlin, a Los Angeles FBI spokesman.</LD>
<LD>   The FBI expects to file a federal charge of interfering with a flight
crew and possibly additional charges for assault on a flight attendant,
he said. He wouldn't release the suspect's name, pending the decision on
the charges.</LD>
<TE>   Southwest Airlines Flight 1702 left the gate at about 3:10 p.m. As the
plane was taxiing, a man left his seat and walked to the rear of the
aircraft with one of his shoes in his hand, McLaughlin said.</TE>
<TE>   The man tried to open one of the plane's rear doors and hit a flight
attendant in the head with his fist when she tried to restrain him,
McLaughlin said. The man opened the door, depressurizing the cabin, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Two male passengers subdued the 6-foot-2-inch, 200-pound suspect and
the pilot returned to the gate, McLaughlin said. The flight continued to
Las Vegas.</TE>

<HD>Woman Pleads No Contest to Animal Cruelty Charges</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Ontario woman who kept 24 Saint Bernards and the carcasses of
other dogs in deplorable conditions in her home pleaded no contest Monday
to four counts of felony animal cruelty.</LD>
<LD>   Patricia Fraus, 65, faces up to 30 days in county jail and five years
of probation at her sentencing Feb. 13.</LD>
<LD>   The plea means that 21 of the Saint Bernards soon will be available
for adoption. The Inland Valley Humane Society says it has spent nearly
$100,000 to take care of the dogs since they were seized April 12 and
Fraus' home was condemned.</LD>
<TE>   "We're very anxious to place these animals in permanent homes," Humane
Society Executive Director Bill Harford said.</TE>
<TE>   Harford said he had received about 200 applications to adopt the dogs.
James Edward, supervisor of administrative services for the Humane
Society, said that 21 of the 24 dogs remain at the shelter after two were
returned to their rightful owners and one died.</TE>
<TE>   Don Pezza, a deputy district attorney for San Bernardino County, said
he would try to persuade Judge Paul Bryant to sign a court order
releasing the dogs in the next couple of days.</TE>
<TE>   Pezza said that Fraus appeared to have "a good heart" and did not
intend to be cruel, but that her situation got out of control.</TE>
<TE>   Under the terms of her probation, Fraus will not be allowed to care
for animals and will be subjected to unannounced searches by the Humane
Society, Pezza said.</TE>
<TE>   Fraus' associate, Jacqi Killeen, also pleaded no contest Monday to a
misdemeanor charge of animal cruelty. She faces three years of probation
and the same restrictions on dog ownership, but no jail time.</TE>
<TE>   She will have to pay restitution to the Humane Society, but the amount
has not been determined. Pezza and Killeen's attorney, Robert Rice, said
it was less than $5,000.</TE>

<HD>Veteran Pilot's Fatal Nose-Dive Perplexes Family and Officials</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Aerospace consultant, who worked with FAA, had 40 years
of flying experience.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There were no last-minute distress calls. No emergency signals.
Nothing, say investigators and airport officials, that might explain why
experienced pilot Don Dirian's plane spiraled and crashed nose first into
a field near Fullerton Municipal Airport.</LD>
<LD>   And with very little left of his burned-up Cessna 337 Skymaster,
investigators were starting their work probing Saturday's midday crash
with few clues.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, National Transportation Safety Board investigator Howard
Plagens began the paper trail: sifting through airplane certification
records, pilot certification records, medical records, maintenance
records, a history on the plane model--anything to help determine what
happened.</LD>
<TE>   He has no preliminary theories. "It's way too early to even look at
any of that," Plagens said.</TE>
<TE>   Dirian's relatives said Monday they were equally perplexed. Dirian,
69, had no serious medical problems. He was a pilot with 40 years
experience and meticulous with maintenance and safety.</TE>
<TE>   Even his job--an aerospace consultant and a designated engineer
representative for the Federal Aviation Administration--meant that Dirian
knew the ins and outs of his plane. In his work with the FAA, Dirian was
authorized to develop modifications or repair instructions for
engineering problems related to aircraft, FAA spokesman Jerry Snyder
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I flew with him a lot, and he was the only person I would fly with,"
said Dirian's daughter, Louise Dirian Loun, 40.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Dirian left his Whittier home for a weekend
ritual--heading to his office at Fullerton Municipal Airport to feed his
saltwater fish. He also went out for a flight.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a beautiful day, and he loved to fly," said another daughter,
Nancy Wigner, 36.</TE>
<TE>   It was a calm day, no winds, and when he requested permission to land
Saturday just 15 or 20 minutes after his departure, he was given the OK
to land on runway 6.</TE>
<TE>   After air traffic controllers cleared him, they noticed his landing
gear was still up, airport manager Rod Propst said. They warned him, and
within seconds, they witnessed him abruptly roll right and head for the
ground at 12:40 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The twin-engine plane narrowly missed businesses and houses in nearby
Buena Park before crashing and exploding in a vacant lot half a mile
short of the runway.</TE>
<TE>   "I can tell you, unequivocally, the plane stalled and then went into a
vertical attitude," Propst said. "It could have been a mechanical
problem. It could have been a human factors issue--[from] a catastrophic
medical event to pilot error."</TE>
<TE>   Plagens hopes to file a preliminary report by week's end. He also will
investigate the wreckage.</TE>
<TE>   Dirian's family, meanwhile, was fielding calls from his friends and
colleagues Monday, and finalizing plans for a memorial service, now
scheduled for Jan. 14 in Whittier.</TE>
<TE>   They talked of good times: a clam boil in September to celebrate the
Dirians' 45th wedding anniversary; a vacation in Hawaii; the way he'd sit
in his recliner, poring over aviation magazines and books; and his love
for the two family cats, Lizzie and Bubbles.</TE>
<TE>   "Even his cats looked forward to him coming home," Dirian Loun said.
"They'd sit in his chair when he was gone, and he'd say to them when he
walked in the house, 'All right, the good times are over.' "</TE>

<HD>Simi Valley Father Pleads Guilty in Shaking Death</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After proclaiming his innocence for more than a year, a 26-year-old
Simi Valley man pleaded guilty Monday to shaking his infant son to death.</LD>
<LD>   Brian Trelatsky faces a mandatory sentence of 15 years to life in
prison. He had been scheduled to stand trial this week on a charge of
child abuse causing death, which carries a penalty of 25 years to life in
prison. But before jury selection began, he offered to plead guilty to a
lesser charge of second-degree murder, and prosecutors accepted.</LD>
<LD>   Trelatsky entered his plea during a brief appearance before Ventura
County Superior Court Judge Ken Riley.</LD>
<TE>   A stay-at-home father, Trelatsky was the primary caregiver for Tyler
and an older son, Scottie, now 3.</TE>
<TE>   On the afternoon of March 28, 2000, firefighters and police responded
to a 911 call of a baby not breathing and found Tyler in cardiac arrest
at the family's home.</TE>
<TE>   Tyler was taken to Simi Valley Hospital for initial treatment, then
transferred to the pediatric intensive-care unit at Northridge Hospital
Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors determined he had retinal hemorrhaging and brain swelling,
symptoms consistent with shaken-baby syndrome, police said. He died the
next day.</TE>
<TE>   Trelatsky is scheduled to be sentenced Feb. 7.</TE>

<HD>Protesters to Address Oxnard Council</HD>
<DH>Reaction: Leaders representing blacks and Latinos are angered by
alleged comments by police official about recent officer-involved
shootings.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A coalition of community groups tonight plans to protest unfounded
suggestions that a 23-year-old artist killed by police was on drugs, and
comments by a police spokesman that Oxnard officers are "equal
opportunity" shooters.</LD>
<LD>   Leaders representing black and Latino groups said they will tell the
City Council that the purported statements of police spokesman David
Keith at a community meeting show an insensitivity to concerns about five
fatal police shootings in 2001 and a premature judgment that the slaying
of artist Robert Jones was justified.</LD>
<LD>   "Any representative for the city of Oxnard should not be out there
making these kinds of statements," said attorney Greg Ramirez, who
represents the Jones family and a group of local Latino lawyers. "Our
message is going to be that this is obviously a practice that is ratified
by the City Council and needs to stop."</LD>
<TE>   Ramirez, also a lawyer for the National Assn. for the Advancement of
Colored People, said that as the Police Department investigated Jones'
shooting, Keith offered the police's defense to one community group after
another.</TE>
<TE>   In late September, a month after Jones was killed, Keith noted the
race of police homicide victims and the officers involved and joked that
the shootings were "equal opportunity," Ramirez said.</TE>
<TE>   He also led listeners to believe Jones was under the influence of PCP
when officers shot the distraught, knife-wielding man as he hid in his
closet, the attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   "You can hear him on the tape say 'equal opportunity,' then there's
laughing," Ramirez said. "He's admitted an error in judgment [to a news
reporter]. Then he strongly infers that Robert Jones was on PCP. He
didn't plant drugs on Robert physically, but he may as well have, because
he says everything we see indicates it's PCP."</TE>
<TE>   Toxicology tests later found no illegal drugs in Jones' system.</TE>
<TE>   Keith could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   A transcript of Keith's comments prepared by court transcribers hired
by Ramirez's law office supports the lawyer's depiction of Keith's
comments.</TE>
<TE>   However, the transcript also shows that Keith stated repeatedly that
the department did not know whether Jones was on PCP, but that he acted
like someone under the influence of drugs. He said that Jones showed no
effects when twice doused with pepper spray and was not slowed much after
being shot twice with a beanbag shotgun.</TE>
<TE>   "Typically, you think of PCP and things like that when someone doesn't
react to those kinds of things," Keith said, according to the transcript.</TE>
<TE>   Police Chief Art Lopez said the department is investigating to
determine what Keith said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a personnel issue, so I can't discuss it," Lopez said. "I
haven't viewed the transcript or [heard] the tape. But I've been with
David Keith on a number of occasions when we have made comments, and he's
judiciously shied away from drawing any conclusions on the case."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, more than four months after Jones' mother called police to
take her armed, upset son to a hospital, Oxnard police are still
investigating the shooting and Jones' history.</TE>
<TE>   Police said initially that Jones was shot because the unemployed
artist, brandishing a 13-inch knife, moved toward officers who had
entered his bedroom and opened his closet. A full report will be
forwarded soon to the district attorney's office, which will rule on
whether the shooting was justified.</TE>
<TE>   The state attorney general, the U.S. attorney's office and the FBI
also are conducting inquiries into the circumstances of Jones' death.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is being done that we possibly can do to prepare our
officers to avoid these types of confrontations," Lopez said. "We're
serious about this."</TE>
<TE>   The Jones shooting was the fifth fatality by an Oxnard officer last
year. A sixth crime suspect was shot but survived. Lopez said that most
of the suspects were mentally ill.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the Jones killing, the police chief vowed to better
train his department to avoid fatal confrontations with mentally ill
people.</TE>
<TE>   Eight Oxnard officers finished a 40-hour training course in December.
And 20 to 25 of the roughly 200 officers will eventually be trained,
Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   Then at least one officer will be on duty at all times with expertise
in defusing potentially deadly showdowns with mentally ill people.</TE>
<TE>   "Friday night we had a situation where the crisis intervention team
was called out," Lopez said. "A suicidal individual held a knife to his
carotid [artery], and our people were successful in having him drop the
knife."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Bedford Pinkard said he welcomes the presentations by the
coalition formed last summer to investigate complaints of racial
profiling against local police agencies.</TE>

<HD>Bodies of Girl, Parents Found</HD>
<DH>Corona: Police suspect the father shot his wife, an LAPD officer,
and their daughter before killing himself.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles police officer, her husband and their teenage
daughter were found dead in their Corona home Monday in an apparent
homicide-suicide, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Police discovered the bodies of LAPD Officer Nancy Walden, 45; her
51-year-old husband; and their daughter at their Donatello Drive
residence in the Riverside County community on the Orange County border.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities did not release the names of the husband and daughter. But
neighbors said the girl was 16 and, despite her age, had passed the high
school equivalency exam and was scheduled to begin college this week.</LD>
<TE>   Corona police officers said they suspect the husband shot his family
and then himself, though they stressed that the investigation is
incomplete.</TE>
<TE>   About 11 a.m., police responded to a call from a relative who had gone
to visit the family and discovered their bodies, all in the same room on
the first floor of the two-story house. A handgun was found at the scene,
Sgt. Michael Abel said, and there was no sign of robbery or forced entry.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Walden had not reported for work as scheduled Monday at
the LAPD, where she was a patrol officer with the bus transit division.
She was last seen Sunday at the California Air National Guard, in which
she had enlisted. She was scheduled to go to Germany soon with the Guard,
LAPD Lt. Horace Frank said.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, Corona police had gone to the house after a report that the
husband was depressed, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said that Walden was outgoing, but that her husband was much
quieter. Louie Ilievski, who lives on the street behind the family, said
Walden's husband was an engineer.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday night, candles lined the street of tract houses in the south
part of Corona. Neighbors said the family had lived there since the tract
was built five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Marian Boerio, who also lives on Donatello Drive, said she and the
other women in the tightknit community had been crying all day.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all one big family and we're just shocked," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Boerio said Walden's family often hosted pool parties and neighborhood
get-togethers.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbor Brad Tucholski, 32, said the teen "was an extremely
intelligent girl, smarter than I am, kind of a loner."</TE>
<TE>   Walden, a six-year veteran of the LAPD, had worked in the Harbor and
Southeast divisions before joining the bus transit division, Frank said,
where she patrolled MTA bus lines and bus facilities.</TE>

<HD>Riordan to Air First TV Ad of Gubernatorial Campaign</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES POLITICAL WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan will air the first paid
television advertising of California's gubernatorial campaign today.</LD>
<LD>   The 60-second spot paints a glowing picture of Riordan's eight years
in Los Angeles City Hall and ends with a familiar phrase: "Tough enough
to turn California around." In Riordan's 1993 race for mayor, he won
using the slogan "Tough enough to turn L.A. around," a potent message in
the midst of the recession and the immediate aftermath of the 1992 riots.</LD>
<LD>   The new spot won't air in Riordan's hometown; the ad is running
virtually everywhere in California save the costly Los Angeles television
market, where Riordan is already a household name.</LD>
<TE>   By taking to the television airwaves, the well-to-do Riordan flaunts
one of his biggest advantages in the race against his GOP rivals,
Secretary of State Bill Jones and businessman Bill Simon Jr.: significant
resources and a willingness to spend generously on advertising, the chief
means of communicating with voters in this far-flung state.</TE>
<TE>   Jones has struggled to raise enough money to be competitive, and
Simon, who has a considerable personal fortune of his own, has chosen to
conserve money until closer to the March 5 primary. He is expected to
start his advertising on radio, perhaps as early as next week.</TE>
<TE>   Having hit the television airwaves, Riordan plans to keep advertising
through the primary, according to his advisors. The average viewer will
see the new spot from three to five times over the next week, a fairly
modest buy.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, who delivers his State of the State speech
tonight in Sacramento, is also expected to tap his considerable campaign
resources and begin airing commercials before the primary. However, he
may wait until after Jan. 19 when, by law, a lower advertising rate kicks
in 45 days before the primary.</TE>
<TE>   By taking to the airwaves now, Riordan will spend more money but may
avoid much of the expected pre-primary clutter.</TE>
<TE>   Although many Californians may be unaware of the looming primary, the
TV campaign is actually starting relatively late by recent California
standards.</TE>
<TE>   For the 1998 gubernatorial campaign, Democrat Al Checchi began airing
television advertisements nearly seven months before the primary; by this
point in the four-way contest that year, the candidates for governor had
already spent millions of dollars on commercials.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Checchi, Riordan hopes to avoid spending his own money, at
least through the primary.Riordan campaign officials refused to discuss
the size of the ad purchase, citing strategic considerations.</TE>

<HD>LAX Lot Fee May Hit $30 Per Day</HD>
<DH>Travel: Parking costs at outlying lots and other airports also
would rise considerably under a plan coming before a city commission.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The daily parking rate at Los Angeles International Airport would
be nearly double what it was just 14 months ago under a plan to be
considered today by the city Airport Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Airport administrators said the rate hike--to $30--is necessary to
plug a gaping hole in the airport's budget, caused by a significant drop
in air travel after the terrorist attacks. A deficit of $127 million has
been projected in the current fiscal year because of increased security
costs and lost revenues.</LD>
<LD>   The commission, meeting in Ontario, will also consider raising hourly
rates in parking structures in LAX's central terminal area and daily
rates in several outlying parking lots. Parking fees would also increase
at Ontario International Airport, the popular Van Nuys FlyAway lot and
for parking lots used by LAX employees.</LD>
<TE>   It's unclear how much revenue the higher fees would generate,
officials said, particularly because parking garages at LAX have only
been a little more than half full on most days since the attacks. The new
rates would go into effect Feb. 15.</TE>
<TE>   Under the rate hike, daily parking fees in structures at LAX would
increase 25% from $24 to $30--close to the highest rate at any major
airport in the nation. The jump, however, is lower than a $35 daily
parking rate proposed by the airport agency in December. Airport
commissioners put the hike on hold because they were loath to operate the
most expensive airport parking garages in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   If approved, the increase would be the second time in a little more
than a year that the airport agency has boosted daily parking rates in
the seven structures in the center of LAX. In October 2000, the agency
pushed rates from $16 to $24 a day in an attempt to coax airport-bound
travelers out of their cars and into mass transit.</TE>
<TE>   The increase is necessary, in part, to pay private security crews who
conduct random searches of vehicles entering LAX parking structures, in
compliance with a directive from the Federal Aviation Administration.</TE>
<TE>   "We clearly have increased costs since Sept. 11 to operate the parking
structures," said Paul Haney, an airport spokesman. "We're also looking
for ways to raise revenues while still remaining competitive with
airports around the U.S. and Southern California regional airports."</TE>
<TE>   At $30, the daily parking fee at LAX would be on par with rates at
Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport and at Burbank Airport.
Other large airports, however, charge less. New York's John F. Kennedy
International Airport and Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport charge
$24 a day. Parking is $23 per day in the central terminal area at
Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Other airports have raised rates after the attacks, including Boston's
Logan Airport, where parking in the central terminal area climbed from
$18 to $22 a day.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposal, hourly rates at the central terminal area garages
at LAX would increase from $2 to $3 for the first hour and $2 for each
additional 30 minutes after that, with a $30 cap for a day. If approved,
the plan would also raise fees at outlying airport lots--the first
increase in 12 years. Daily parking rates at Lot C would climb from $7 to
$10 and at Lot B from $5 to $8.</TE>
<TE>   At Ontario International Airport, daily parking rates in the central
terminal area would rise from $21 to $32, including a fine to discourage
parking for more than two hours. Airport managers said they hope the
change will encourage those parking overnight to use outlying economy
lots. The close-in spaces are intended for people who are picking up or
dropping off passengers, Haney said.</TE>
<TE>   Daily rates in Lots 2 and 4 at Ontario would jump from $10 to $12 and
in Lot 3 from $7 to $9.</TE>
<TE>   Hourly rates in Ontario, however, would fall from $5 for the first
hour to $1 every 30 minutes. Economy parking in Lots D, F and A would
decline from $3 for the first hour to no charge for the first three
hours.</TE>
<TE>   To recover the costs of operating the Van Nuys FlyAway lot--used by
about 800,000 people a year--commissioners will consider raising rates
from $2 to $4 per day. The plan includes a recommended increase from $22
to $30 per month for LAX employee parking in Lot D and from $11 to $15 a
month for employee parking in Lot E.</TE>

<HD>Agreement Reached for Custody of Jerry Garcia's Guitars</HD>
<DH>Legacy: Two will return to their maker, while band also will keep
two.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAWN HUBLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO
</DL>
<LD>A long-standing custody fight over the famed guitars of the late
Grateful Dead lead-man Jerry Garcia finally ended Monday, setting the
stage for an auction of a storied--and intensely coveted--piece of rock
history.</LD>
<LD>   After nearly a year of on-again, off-again litigation, lawyers
announced that they had reached agreement on the ownership of the five
instruments that had been handmade for Garcia by Bay Area luthier Doug
Irwin, and then bequeathed back to their maker.</LD>
<LD>   Under the agreement, two of the best-known guitars--nicknamed Wolf and
Tiger for the shapes of their intricate inlays--will revert to Irwin, and
two will stay with the Dead, which had argued that the instruments had
been communally owned and not Garcia's to will away.</LD>
<TE>   The fate of the fifth guitar is unclear. It is believed to have been
given away by Garcia to a member of the original Dead crew named Ramrod,
but lawyers on both sides say they have received conflicting stories
about its whereabouts. In any case, experts say, of the five guitars, it
was the one Garcia least played and thus the least valuable.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence K. Rockwell, the Dead's attorney, said the band is "happy
that the matter is resolved" and ready to get on with the deal's
execution. Garcia's bandmates have said they hope to make their
instruments, known as Rosebud and Headless, a key display at Terrapin
Station, a San Francisco museum they have long planned to open.</TE>
<TE>   Irwin, who has been destitute since he was nearly killed in a
hit-and-run accident three years ago, says he will keep Wolf, which he
custom-made for Garcia and sold to him for $1,500 in 1973. But, he said,
he will immediately put Tiger up for auction. The latter guitar, which
Irwin spent more than six years crafting out of coca-bola, maple,
mother-of-pearl and vermilion, was Garcia's signature instrument, and he
played it almost daily for 11 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I had to hold my nose, but I signed the deal," said Irwin,
whose insistence that the Dead had failed Garcia's memory by not handing
over all five guitars had been the main obstacle to settlement. Irwin and
the band had been friendly for decades. Self-taught in a 1960s
welfare-to-work program, he had developed his craft to the point that his
clients included such guitar greats as Neil Young and Carlos Santana. He
was so close to Garcia that the return of the Irwin guitars was Garcia's
sole bequest to a non-family member, although the musician's lawyers
misspelled Irwin's name in the will.</TE>
<TE>   But after Garcia's death and Irwin's reversals of fortune, his
relationship with the Dead deteriorated badly, with Irwin claiming that
the Dead had reproduced his signature guitar designs without paying him
royalties. Sources close to the band members said that he would
occasionally burst into their offices, angrily ranting, but that the
relationship was also a moral dilemma for them. Irwin, by this year, was
so down on his luck that he couldn't afford to get his woodworking
equipment out of storage and was living with his elderly mother in Hemet.</TE>
<TE>   His situation--and the confusion of legions of Deadheads, who followed
the case avidly on the Internet, pitted the band's reputation for loyalty
and philanthropy against their communal principals.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides had neared agreement in October, but Irwin had withdrawn
his approval when the Dead asked that he not publicly disparage the
agreement. He also objected to a clause that would have given the Dead
first right of refusal if he put any of the guitars up for sale. That
clause was removed from the final agreement--a move applauded by
memorabilia experts, who said it would have significantly inhibited
bidding, even with the cult-like devotion Garcia inspired in his fans.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody wants to commit to spending a lot of money just to find they
aren't going to get what they bid on," said Steve Routhier, a Florida
collectibles consultant who, as a vice president for Hard Rock Cafe
International from 1986 to 1996, built that restaurant chain's famed
memorabilia collection.</TE>
<TE>   "With [the clause] out of the way . . . it could be very competitive.
Very competitive. With Jerry's popularity and the fiendish following that
the Dead has and the fact that lots of their hard-core fans are now
wealthy--the Executive Deadheads, we used to call them--I wouldn't be
surprised if the bidding went into the high six figures."</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, a white acoustic guitar that had belonged to Buddy
Holly--estimated by Sotheby's to be worth $20,000--was sold for $249,500
to Gary Busey, the actor who had once played him. The white Stratocaster
that Jimi Hendrix played at Woodstock, now in the Seattle rock museum of
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, was bought by an Italian collector for
$325,000. In 1999, John Lennon's acoustic guitar fetched 140,000 pounds,
or about $201,530. The same year, Eric Clapton's "Brownie," the
tobacco-burst Stratocaster he played when he recorded "Layla," set the
record for rock guitars, selling for $450,000.</TE>
<TE>   The hot market of the 1990s has softened along with the economy,
experts say, but values have held firm for items of proven worth and
solid provenance. Irwin's lawyer said in October that a Connecticut
collector who had read about the court fight offered $200,000 just for
Wolf.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, an electric guitar billed as a "Doug Erwin Guitar Made for
Grateful Dead" was put up for auction on EBay, with bidding set at
$20,000. The item was removed Monday after Irwin's lawyer, Doug Long,
questioned its authenticity to EBay, which directed him to the seller, a
32-year-old recording engineer from Chico named Brian Asher.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't mean any disrespect or any kind of infringement," said
Asher, who described himself in an e-mail to Long as an "old-school S.F.
head Sufi mystic rocker" whose band had once opened for the Jerry Garcia
Band in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Asher said he had put the guitar up for auction at the behest of a
friend who had been told by a one-time employee of Garcia that Irwin
might have made it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just an extremely high-quality instrument with an incredible
neck. We just wanted to create some buzz."</TE>

<HD>Father Pleads Guilty in Boy's Shaking Death</HD>
<DH>Courts: Simi Valley man, who previously claimed innocence, avoids
trial on a more serious charge. He faces a sentence of 15 years to life
in prison.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After proclaiming his innocence for more than a year, a 26-year-old
Simi Valley man pleaded guilty Monday to shaking his infant son to death.</LD>
<LD>   Brian Trelatsky faces a mandatory sentence of 15 years to life in
prison. He had been scheduled to stand trial this week on a charge of
child abuse causing death, which carries a penalty of 25 years to life in
prison. But before jury selection could begin, he offered to plead guilty
to a lesser charge of second-degree murder, and prosecutors accepted.</LD>
<LD>   "What Mr. Trelatsky did today reduces his sentence by 10 years,"
Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Dee Corona said. But she said the penalty is
still significant because Trelatsky could be held in prison for life if
denied parole.</LD>
<TE>   Trelatsky entered his plea during a brief appearance before Ventura
County Superior Court Judge Ken Riley.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Deputy Public Defender Todd Howeth declined to explain the
reasons behind the plea change or discuss 10-week-old Tyler Trelatsky's
death.</TE>
<TE>   "I think because it is a very sensitive case, I'd rather wait," he
said. "I think the whole family, including Mr. Trelatsky, is devastated."</TE>
<TE>   A stay-at-home father, Trelatsky was the primary caregiver for Tyler
and an older son, Scottie, now 3.</TE>
<TE>   On the afternoon of March 28, 2000, firefighters and police responded
to a 911 call of a baby not breathing and found Tyler in cardiac arrest
at the family's mobile home.</TE>
<TE>   Tyler was taken to Simi Valley Hospital for initial treatment, then
transferred to the pediatric intensive-care unit at Northridge Hospital
Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors determined he had retinal hemorrhaging and brain swelling,
symptoms consistent with shaken-baby syndrome, police said. He died the
next day.</TE>
<TE>   Six months later, Trelatsky was arrested and charged with child abuse
causing death.</TE>
<TE>   At a preliminary hearing, his wife, Catherine Trelatsky, described him
as a loving father. But she also acknowledged that she sometimes found
bruises and scratches on Tyler.</TE>
<TE>   She described her son as a sickly child who weighed less than 5 pounds
when he came home from the hospital after his birth.</TE>
<TE>   She also testified that the couple's older son was jealous of the baby
and would sometimes pull on his arms and legs. She cited one incident in
which Scottie allegedly jumped on the baby's head and another in which he
allegedly hit the child on the head.</TE>
<TE>   But the medical examiner who performed the autopsy testified it was
unlikely a toddler could have inflicted the fatal injuries.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the brain swelling and hemorrhaging, Dr. Janice Frank
testified that Tyler had several rib fractures in various stages of
healing.</TE>
<TE>   Such fractures, she said, could be expected if a parent were "grasping
the child around the chest and shaking the child violently."</TE>
<TE>   A judge ruled the evidence sufficient to order Trelatsky to stand
trial. He is scheduled to be sentenced Feb. 7.</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Protest Targets Police</HD>
<DH>Reaction: Leaders of community groups to confront council about
alleged comments by a department official about recent shootings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A coalition of community groups tonight plans to protest unfounded
suggestions that a 23-year-old artist killed by police was on drugs, and
comments by a police spokesman that Oxnard officers are "equal
opportunity" shooters.</LD>
<LD>   Leaders representing black and Latino groups said they will tell the
City Council that the purported statements of police spokesman David
Keith at a community meeting show an insensitivity to concerns about five
fatal police shootings in 2001 and a premature judgment that the slaying
of artist Robert Jones was justified.</LD>
<LD>   "Any representative for the city of Oxnard should not be out there
making these kinds of statements," said attorney Greg Ramirez, who
represents the Jones family and a group of local Latino lawyers. "Our
message is going to be that this is obviously a practice that is ratified
by the City Council and needs to stop."</LD>
<TE>   Ramirez, also a lawyer for the National Assn. for the Advancement of
Colored People, said that as the Police Department investigated Jones'
shooting, Keith offered the police's defense to one community group after
another.</TE>
<TE>   In late September, a month after Jones was killed, Keith noted the
race of police homicide victims and the officers involved and joked that
the shootings were "equal opportunity," Ramirez said.</TE>
<TE>   He also led listeners to believe Jones was under the influence of PCP
when officers shot the distraught, knife-wielding man as he hid in his
closet, the attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   "You can hear him on the tape say 'equal opportunity,' then there's
laughing," Ramirez said. "He's admitted an error in judgment [to a news
reporter]. Then he strongly infers that Robert Jones was on PCP. He
didn't plant drugs on Robert physically, but he may as well have, because
he says everything we see indicates it's PCP."</TE>
<TE>   Toxicology tests later found no illegal drugs in Jones' system.</TE>
<TE>   Keith could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   A transcript of Keith's comments prepared by court transcribers hired
by Ramirez's law office supports the lawyer's depiction of Keith's
comments.</TE>
<TE>   However, the transcript also shows that Keith stated repeatedly that
the department did not know whether Jones was on PCP, but that he acted
like someone under the influence of drugs. He said that Jones showed no
effects when twice doused with pepper spray and was not slowed much after
being shot twice with a beanbag shotgun.</TE>
<TE>   "Typically, you think of PCP and things like that when someone doesn't
react to those kinds of things," Keith said, according to the transcript.</TE>
<TE>   Police Chief Art Lopez said the department is investigating to
determine what Keith said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a personnel issue, so I can't discuss it," Lopez said. "I
haven't viewed the transcript or [heard] the tape. But I've been with
David Keith on a number of occasions when we have made comments, and he's
judiciously shied away from drawing any conclusions on the case."</TE>
<TE>Shooting Still Under Investigation</TE>
<TE>   In fact, more than four months after Jones' mother called police to
take her armed, upset son to a hospital, Oxnard police are still
investigating the shooting and Jones' history.</TE>
<TE>   Police said initially that Jones was shot because the unemployed
artist, brandishing a 13-inch knife, moved toward officers who had
entered his bedroom and opened his closet. A full report will be
forwarded soon to the district attorney's office, which will rule on
whether the shooting was justified.</TE>
<TE>   The state attorney general, the U.S. attorney's office and the FBI
also are conducting inquiries into the circumstances of Jones' death.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is being done that we possibly can do to prepare our
officers to avoid these types of confrontations," Lopez said. "We're
serious about this."</TE>
<TE>   The Jones shooting was the fifth fatality by an Oxnard officer last
year. A sixth crime suspect was shot but survived. Lopez said that most
of the suspects were mentally ill.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the Jones killing, the police chief vowed to better
train his department to avoid fatal confrontations with mentally ill
people.</TE>
<TE>   Eight Oxnard officers finished a 40-hour training course in December.
And 20 to 25 of the roughly 200 officers will eventually be trained,
Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   Then at least one officer will be on duty at all times with expertise
in defusing potentially deadly showdowns with mentally ill people.</TE>
<TE>   "Friday night we had a situation where the crisis intervention team
was called out," Lopez said. "A suicidal individual held a knife to his
carotid [artery], and our people were successful in having him drop the
knife."</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez said that groups expected to be represented at tonight's
council meeting are the NAACP, the Mexican-American Bar Assn. of Ventura
County, the League of United Latin American Citizens, the Ventura County
Black Attorneys Assn., the California Rural Legal Assistance and El
Concilio del Condado de Ventura.</TE>
<TE>Councilman Welcomes Public Comments</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Bedford Pinkard said he welcomes the presentations by the
coalition formed last summer to investigate complaints of racial
profiling against local police agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Jones had filed two such complaints after being stopped twice by
Oxnard police in the months before his death.</TE>
<TE>   "I welcome their presence," Pinkard said. "I think the community
should come and let us know their feelings. But in cases like this it's a
personnel matter, really."</TE>

<HD>Simon Has Stock in Alleged Profiteer</HD>
<DH>Politics: Spokesman says the gubernatorial hopeful won't sell El
Paso Natural Gas shares.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATT LAIT</AU>
<AU>SCOTT GLOVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial candidate William E. Simon Jr. owns stock
in a natural gas company accused of taking advantage of California's
energy woes by creating an artificial supply shortage that sent prices
soaring.</LD>
<LD>   Simon, a Los Angeles investment banker, owns about $16,750 of stock in
El Paso Natural Gas Co., according to campaign aides and economic
disclosure forms filed by his campaign. Simon and his family's investment
company have owned the stock since 1988, Simon's brother and campaign
manager said.</LD>
<LD>   El Paso Natural Gas, a subsidiary of Houston-based energy giant El
Paso Corp., was accused last year of withholding natural gas from the
Southern California market to create an artificial shortage that would
boost gas prices.</LD>
<TE>   Company officials vehemently deny the charges, which are the subject
of a pending complaint before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
Simon, son of former Treasury secretary and investor William E. Simon,
was unavailable for comment on his investment, his spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Sal Russo, Simon's campaign consultant, said the candidate was not
aware of his financial interest in El Paso Natural Gas until he reviewed
his disclosure statement late last year. Russo added that Simon, upon
learning of the investment, did not perceive any conflict of interest and
has no plans to divest the stock.</TE>
<TE>   Russo and another campaign official noted that Simon's stock in the
company represents a "relatively small amount" of money compared with the
candidate's overall net worth. Simon is a multimillionaire.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're ultimately asking if he would do something detrimental to
the taxpayers of California to make himself $10,000, obviously the answer
to that is no," said Jeff Flint, a campaign spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   As he has campaigned for governor, Simon has repeatedly criticized
Davis for his handling of the state energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "His refusing to act last year when this terrible crisis could have
been limited to a manageable problem is something that even Bill Clinton
would have trouble pardoning," Simon said May 10 in a speech at a
birthday dinner for state Sen. Jim Brulte (R-Rancho Cucamonga). "Davis'
vision of California is shivering in the winter, sweating in the summer,
and reading by candlelight."</TE>
<TE>   Responding to the Simon investment in El Paso, aides to Davis
questioned their rival's statements.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be unfortunate if, at the same time the governor was trying
to keep the lights on, other candidates were profiting from California's
energy problem," said Roger Salazar, a spokesman for the Davis campaign.
"It leaves their motives open to question."</TE>
<TE>   Simon's financial interest in El Paso, Salazar said, "certainly
doesn't lend him any additional credibility on the issue."</TE>
<TE>   Garry South, Davis' chief strategist, called Simon a hypocrite.</TE>
<TE>   Sean Walsh, deputy campaign manager for GOP candidate Bill Jones, said
he was not surprised that Simon's vast portfolio contained an investment
in a firm doing business with the state.</TE>
<TE>   "When you come into the ring a very wealthy candidate with no
political experience, there's a lot of baggage that comes with you,"
Walsh said. "Charitably speaking, this is a substantial public relations
and political problem. Were he to become governor, it would be a legal
problem."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Stern, one of the authors of the California political reform act,
said that although elected officials are required to disclose potential
financial conflicts, state law does not provide for any penalty for a
governor who uses his position to advance his financial interests.</TE>
<TE>Stock Was Bought in 1988</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, who was a
wealthy venture capitalist before becoming mayor in 1993 and is now a
Republican candidate for governor, declined to comment on Simon's
investment. The stock in El Paso Natural Gas is owned by Alham Inc., a
Simon family investment company, in which William Simon is a partner.</TE>
<TE>   His brother and business partner, J. Peter Simon, said the stock was
purchased in 1988. As of last March, Peter Simon said, Alham owned 3,300
shares worth about $134,000. William Simon's personal share is about
one-eighth of that, or $16,750, Peter Simon said. The Simons have no role
in the management of El Paso Corp. or El Paso Natural Gas Co.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very long-term investment with very steep tax implications" if
the stock were to be sold, Peter Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he had not discussed the holding in El Paso Natural Gas with
his brother William since he declared his candidacy for governor last
year.</TE>
<TE>   "Billy hasn't been very involved [in the family business] over the
past six months," the younger Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   At the center of the allegations against El Paso Corp. is a deal in
which one El Paso subsidiary won the right to ship 1.2 billion cubic feet
of natural gas a day to Southern California through an interstate
pipeline operated by another subsidiary, El Paso Natural Gas Co.</TE>
<TE>   California natural gas prices skyrocketed during the months the
contract was in effect last year, then dropped dramatically after it
expired May 31. The California Public Utilities Commission and state
electric utilities alleged that the two El Paso subsidiaries withheld
shipping capacity on the pipeline during part of 2000, creating an
artificial shortage that boosted prices.</TE>
<TE>   In October, an administrative law judge found that El Paso Natural Gas
and El Paso Merchant engaged in "blatant collusion" that violated federal
rules when they negotiated the gas deal. He also determined that El Paso
Corp. had gained enough market share to have the ability to manipulate
California prices.</TE>
<TE>   The judge, however, found that the evidence was "not clear at all" as
to whether El Paso abused its position by driving up prices. He dismissed
that allegation.</TE>
<TE>   The judge, Curtis L. Wagner Jr., has since been directed to review a
portion of his decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
which has the final say in the matter.</TE>

<HD>Padilla Will Pay Penalty for Breaches</HD>
<DH>Ethics: Council president could be charged a record $79,321 for
campaign finance violations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a record settlement, Los Angeles City Council President Alex
Padilla has agreed to pay $2,500 in fines and repay the city $76,821 in
matching funds after the city Ethics Commission found he exceeded
spending and contribution limits in his 1999 election, officials said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Padilla issued an apology to his colleagues and constituents Monday.</LD>
<LD>   His campaign committee received the city matching funds in exchange
for agreeing to limit spending to $275,000 in the June 1999 runoff
election, but a commission audit found he exceeded the limit by $54,738.</LD>
<TE>   Padilla knew at some point that he was exceeding the spending limits
by choosing to pay campaign-related bills that came in after the runoff
election, according to David Gershwin, one of his aides. Gershwin said
Padilla faced the dilemma of making good on paying the bills and
exceeding the spending limit or staying within the limit and "stiffing
vendors."</TE>
<TE>   This is the third time the Ethics Commission has levied fines
involving Padilla's 1999 election. In 1999, the commission fined the
political arm of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor $2,000 for
failing to properly disclose $31,000 it spent on an independent campaign
supporting Padilla's election. In 2000, the commission fined cable firm
MediaOne for excessive campaign contributions to candidates, including
Padilla, in the election the year before.</TE>
<TE>   LeeAnn Pelham, executive director of the ethics panel, said that if it
is approved by the commission Thursday, the agreement with Padilla would
be the largest payment made in a settlement since the commission was
created.</TE>
<TE>   Pelham and Padilla signed the proposed stipulated agreement, which
stated that his campaign "significantly exceeded" the spending limit and
has agreed to pay back all $76,821 in city matching funds.</TE>
<TE>   The $2,500 fine is for accepting two campaign contributions in excess
of a $500 limit. The commission cited contributions from Kam Hekmat and
his company, a commercial building management firm called Indivest, and
city parks Commissioner Christopher Pak and his firm, Archeon
International Group, an architectural firm.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla can pay the fines and restitution by raising political
contributions, said Pelham, who declined to comment further until the
commission votes on the stipulation.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla said invoices for services that were submitted after the
election pushed his campaign over the spending limits.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not my intent or the intent of my campaign to exceed the
spending cap," he said Monday. "Exceeding the spending cap . . . was a
mistake on my part and on the part of my 1999 campaign committee."</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for Padilla, Fred Woocher, said he believes the amount of
excessive spending is closer to $27,000 because some spending identified
by the Ethics Commission was for noncampaign expenses such as his
inauguration and setting up his council office.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla won the 1999 runoff election with 67% of the vote against
health agency administrator Corinne Sanchez, who spent $126,574 in the
race.</TE>
<TE>   If Padilla had exceeded the spending limit before the election, the
cap would have been lifted for Sanchez, potentially lessening the
advantage Padilla enjoyed.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez welcomed the enforcement but said she did not believe the
excessive spending altered the outcome of her race.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Gray-Barkan, her campaign manager in 1999, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not a close election, so I don't think it had an effect on the
outcome of who won," Gray-Barkan said of Padilla's excessive spending.
"But the spending limits are certainly set up for a reason, to ensure a
level playing field, and they should be enforced by the Ethics
Commission."</TE>

<HD>Proposition 13 Case Could Cost O.C. Millions</HD>
<DH>Taxes: Schools, cities will also lose if the county complies with
judge's assessment ruling. Board mulls legal challenge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Schools, cities and county government would lose an estimated $147
million in taxes in the first year if Orange County complies with a
judge's ruling that a key method for assessing property is
unconstitutional.</LD>
<LD>   Schools would take the biggest hit, according to an analysis prepared
by Auditor-Controller David Sundstrom. Schools receive 64% of property
taxes, meaning they would lose $94 million in the first year, the
analysis estimated.</LD>
<LD>   Cities and special districts would lose a combined $32 million, with
redevelopment agencies and county government losing a combined $20
million.</LD>
<TE>   The dire predictions were presented Monday to Orange County
supervisors, who will meet behind closed doors today to decide how to
respond to the judge's ruling. County Counsel Benjamin P. de Mayo has
recommended appealing Judge John M. Watson's decision in hopes of having
it overturned.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is the practice of "recapturing" taxes on properties.
California's landmark 1978 property-tax reform measure barred assessments
from rising more than 2% a year, but assessors statewide--including
Orange County--routinely tack more than that onto properties where values
have slumped and then recovered.</TE>
<TE>   Watson, in a ruling signed last month, declared that the recapturing
method violated Proposition 13. Even though property values can drop
during bad economic times, the judge said, they cannot be raised more
than 2% a year regardless of how much the real estate market springs
back.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the ruling affects only the Seal Beach couple who filed the
suit; their home's assessed value rose 4% in 1998. The tax bill followed
a year in which their home's value stayed the same. Assessor Webster
Guillory argued that the increase was legal because it "recaptured" the
possible increase that otherwise was lost during the stagnant year.</TE>
<TE>   The argument was that assessment rose 2% plus 2% for the previous year
when the home didn't go up in value.</TE>
<TE>   Sundstrom estimated that Orange County would have to refund an
additional $285 million in excess property taxes paid between 1998 and
2001 if the 2% limit is upheld and applied retroactively to all property
owners.</TE>
<TE>   California taxpayers are closely watching the Orange County case
because it's the first time a court has ruled on the legality of
recapturing. Every assessor in California uses the same method, according
to county attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   If the case is upheld and given class-action status, it could cost
hundreds of millions of dollars in refunds and result in lower property
taxes for tens of thousands. Sundstrom estimated that the loss could go
as high as $4 billion if the ruling is upheld on a statewide basis.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest impact would come in the first year, with tax reductions
diminishing after that as homes are sold or transferred, losing their
protections under Proposition 13.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Bob Pool, who sued the county over his Seal Beach home, said
supervisors are "asking for a headache either way they go" on Watson's
ruling. If they appeal, they risk an appellate court affirming the ruling
and applying it to every county in California, he said. If they don't,
they risk being flooded with applications for refunds by every property
owner whose assessments increased more than 2% in a year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be an interesting thing to watch," Pool said. "They
kind of brought it on themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Pool has asked Watson to intervene against the county under a separate
provision of tax law. He has argued that the county must comply with a
requirement that taxpayers be notified of the right to file for a refund
if their taxes were overpaid by $10 or more. That way, taxpayers would
know about the ruling and how to file a claim, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The county has been telling people, 'Don't bother appealing [their
assessments] because what we're doing is legal,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pool and his wife, Renee Bezaire, bought their home for $330,000 in
November 1995. For two years, the home's taxable value stayed the same,
thanks to a flat real estate market. But in 1998, the assessor determined
that the home had rebounded and raised its taxable value to $343,332--a
4% jump.</TE>
<TE>   Watson has yet to rule on whether he will expand his ruling to
class-action status. He indicated in December that he would abide with a
request by Pool and county attorneys to wait until after supervisors
decide whether they will appeal the ruling.</TE>

<HD>'Encouraging' Recovery Takes Wing at John Wayne Airport</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Numbers of passengers, flights are climbing. But December
figures are 6% below those of a year earlier.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bolstered by holiday travel, passenger loads and the number of
flights at John Wayne Airport continued to recover in December, but
remained almost 6% less than a year earlier, according to figures
presented Monday to Orange County supervisors.</LD>
<LD>   "Last month was encouraging," said Ann McCarley, an airport
spokeswoman. "The numbers have been getting better and better every
month" following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   Statistics show that the airport accommodated 572,000 passengers in
December, 5.7% fewer than the same period a year earlier. But McCarley
said that from Dec. 20 to 24, the number of travelers was comparable to a
year earlier.</LD>
<TE>   The latest figures reflect a substantial improvement since September,
when the number of passengers passing through John Wayne Airport
plummeted by about one-third, from 600,000 in 2000 to 400,000 in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   County officials noted that the airport handled 7,249 commercial
flights in December, which was within 6.6% of the volume for the same
period a year earlier. That number also was an improvement over November.</TE>
<TE>   Additional security costs for December were $741,000, bringing the
total since Sept. 11 to slightly more than $2.5 million, the report
states.</TE>
<TE>   In early December, airport officials estimated John Wayne Airport's
loss as a result of the terrorist attacks at $10.4 million for fiscal
year 2001-02. To help recover, they have proposed increasing parking
rates and rents for hangars and aircraft storage.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, county supervisors have required the airport to file
monthly reports detailing passenger volume, flight operations and
security costs, among other statistics.</TE>

<HD>Carpool Lane Opens Today on 405 South</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 7 1/2-mile carpool lane opens this morning on the southbound San
Diego Freeway in the Sepulveda Pass, one of the state's busiest stretches
of highway, according to Caltrans.</LD>
<LD>   The $20-million project adds a fifth lane to the southbound 405 from
the Ventura Freeway (101) interchange in Sherman Oaks to the Wilshire
Boulevard exit in Westwood.</LD>
<LD>   "This will help ease the bottleneck under the 101," said Richard Katz,
co-chairman of the San Fernando Valley Transportation Strike Force.
"It'll be a number of small steps like this that add up to improve
people's commute."</LD>
<TE>   The carpool lane, which took 16 months to build, is part of a
$37-million effort to unclog traffic on the 405. But the improvements
will not include a carpool lane for motorists heading north into the San
Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   California Department of Transportation spokeswoman Margie Tiritilli
said no funding has been allocated to buy the right of way for a
northbound lane, which also would require broadening the Mulholland
Bridge.</TE>
<TE>   Still, those who drive the 405 say they welcome the one-direction
carpool lane, if only because its completion removes construction crews.</TE>
<TE>   "That is a horrible freeway to travel in the morning," said Jacqueline
Conners Appelbaum, an attorney who commutes from her Sherman Oaks home to
her Beverly Hills office. "Hopefully, now this will relax the
congestion."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles City Councilman Jack Weiss, whose district borders the
freeway, said his office fields frequent complaints about the freeway.
"Just having some closure on the project itself will be a positive thing
for motorists," he said.</TE>
<TE>   During peak hours, the extra lane--reserved for vehicles carrying at
least two people--is designed to draw 1,500 cars an hour from the other
lanes, Tiritilli said. Motorcycles with a single rider can also use the
carpool lane.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other 405 improvements is a new auxiliary lane that helps
motorists enter the northbound side of the freeway, between Mulholland
Drive and the Sepulveda Boulevard underpass. It should be completed by
June, Caltrans officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Groundbreaking will take place this year for another lane on the
connector between the northbound 405 and eastbound 101, to be finished by
the end of 2003. Caltrans also plans to add a lane to the northbound
Sepulveda offramp and build a ramp at Greenleaf Street in Sherman Oaks,
to be finished in 2009.</TE>

<HD>Pasadena Council Approves Gutting Raymond Theatre</HD>
<DH>Project: The owners plan apartments and shops but vow to restore
building's facade.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The curtain may have finally fallen on Old Pasadena's historic
Raymond Theatre, as the Pasadena City Council approved a plan Monday to
gut the landmark to make way for apartments, shops and offices.</LD>
<LD>   Despite pleas from preservationists, the council voted 6 to 2 to allow
the controversial project.</LD>
<LD>   "Empty buildings aren't very attractive," said Councilman Steve
Haderlein, who voted for the conversion.</LD>
<TE>   For more than 15 years, the future of the Raymond Theatre has been
debated. One councilman compared the 80-year-old landmark to a family pet
that has suffered the ravages of age but that no one is willing to put
out of its misery.</TE>
<TE>   At a public hearing last month, dozens of people protested the plan to
convert the theater at 129 N. Raymond Ave., saying it would effectively
"demolish" the theater that had showcased vaudeville, pornographic movies
and rock 'n' roll before sitting empty much of the last decade. The Los
Angeles Conservancy called the project a "facade-omy"--a term akin to
lobotomy--in which the insides would be removed and only the shell would
remain.</TE>
<TE>   But Councilman Steve Madison said the city has been assured that the
owners will restore the facade and maintain much of the building's
decorative fittings.</TE>
<TE>   The owners, Gene and Marilyn Buchanan, wanted council approval to
build 62 apartments in the parking lot and in the 90-foot-high stage
house. They would put offices in the balcony area and create retail
stores in the main space, while restoring the Beaux Arts facade of the
1,800-seat theater.</TE>
<TE>   "We finally got approval to move ahead with the project," Gene
Buchanan said after the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Led by Councilwoman Joyce Streator, the council included a requirement
that at least four of the housing units, or 6%, be affordable and perhaps
more if staff can negotiate it.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it does us any good to have a vacant dilapidated
building sitting there with a small parking lot," Streator said. "But in
all good conscience, we've got to include affordable housing."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Victor Gordo, who with Councilman Paul Little dissented,
said that was not enough affordable housing. A recently passed ordinance
requires projects to include 15% affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   Buchanan said he does not know how the affordable housing will affect
the project's economics. He does know, he said, that the theater was
never an economically viable option.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, attorney Pierce O'Donnell and entrepreneur Harvey Knell
failed in an effort to acquire the theater and preserve it. After
agreeing to buy it, the pair could not secure financing or a developer
for an adjacent apartment structure that they hoped would help fund the
$3.5-million purchase of the theater as a performing arts center.</TE>
<TE>   That failure weighed heavily on the council's decision Monday. Another
developer Monday, Urban Development Resources Corp., said it was
interested, but did not make a firm offer.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's decision may still be challenged in court by Pasadena
Heritage, a powerful local preservation group.</TE>

<HD>Signal Hill Survey Delivers Emphatic 'Yes' on ZIP Code</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Signal Hill's mail recipients have indicated that they
overwhelmingly favor finally getting their own ZIP Code, and the U.S.
Postal Service announced Monday that they all but certainly will.</LD>
<LD>   Postal surveys of Signal Hill residents and business owners were
counted Monday, revealing 68% support for the new ZIP Code, according to
city and postal service officials. They said 32% of returned surveys
opposed Signal Hill's being assigned an independent ZIP Code.</LD>
<LD>   All that remains is an official OK by U.S. Postmaster General John
"Jack" Potter, protocol that is expected by Jan. 15, said U.S. Postal
Service spokesman George Marsh.</LD>
<TE>   "There is no doubt it will be approved," he added.</TE>
<TE>   ZIP Codes are used by insurance companies to set premiums, by
telephone companies to organize phone number listings and even by grocery
store chains to decide where to locate markets. As a result, people in
this small oil town have long felt a lack of community identity that has
been exacerbated by the city's lack of a central business district.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, the city of 9,330 has shared three ZIP Codes with parts of
Long Beach, which has 49 times more people and totally surrounds Signal
Hill. The bigger city's higher crime rate has cost residents in higher
insurance premiums, and ZIP Code confusion has led to lost mail.</TE>
<TE>   Given the snags in mail and higher cost, why would any mail customer
prefer the shared ZIP Codes? Some businesses, such as the numerous car
dealerships in Signal Hill's new auto corridor, prefer the more
recognizable Long Beach address.</TE>
<TE>   After 12 years of dashed hopes in their campaign for an independent
ZIP Code, lobbying every level of government official, it was perhaps not
surprising that city leaders were muted and cautious in their response to
the news.</TE>
<TE>   Was City Manager Ken Farfsing going to celebrate the accomplishment
Monday night? After all, getting the city a new ZIP Code was one of three
tasks put before him when he interviewed for Signal Hill's top job six
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm waiting for official confirmation," Farfsing said. "Some kind of
letter. That seems reasonable."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Larry Forester was less subdued. "We got the ZIP Code!" he
blurted out in a phone interview. Then he caught himself. "I'm not going
to celebrate until Jan. 15. The Postal Service did a very good job."</TE>
<TE>   But what of his oft-told "little city that could" narrative, the tiny
town triumphing over towering bureaucracy?</TE>
<TE>   "With the federal government, I want to dot I's and cross Ts. And
after 12 years, I think I can wait a week."</TE>
<TE>   Come the official rubber stamp, efforts will begin to have Signal
Hill's ZIP Code changed to 90755 by July 1.</TE>
<TE>   The city's cause was long ago championed by U.S. Rep. Stephen Horn
(R-Long Beach), the retiring congressman whose appeal last month to
Potter set things in motion.</TE>
<TE>   Farfsing has worked six years on the matter. It was brought up before
he even got the job. Just having the postal survey of mail customers
conducted, a requirement before any ZIP Code change, thrilled him.</TE>
<TE>   Residents at the city's main hangout, Curley's Cafe, were also pleased
with Monday's announcement.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's just great," said Robert Lee, a 77-year-old oilman.
"About time."</TE>

<HD>School Board Member Charged With Perjury</HD>
<DH>West Covina: Elected official allegedly lied about living in the
district. He could face up to five years in prison.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A West Covina school board member was charged Monday with perjury
for allegedly lying that he lived in the district when prosecutors say
evidence will show he resides a dozen miles away in Downey.</LD>
<LD>   Peter Sabatino Jr., 48, surrendered to authorities at the downtown
Criminal Courts Building, where he made a brief appearance and a Los
Angeles Superior Court judge released him on his own recognizance.</LD>
<LD>   The 13-year incumbent was reelected in November despite news reports
just days before the election that investigators for the district
attorney had searched a home he owns in Downey.</LD>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Ceballos said Sabatino has his own room at
the Downey address. "When we searched the house, and it was 7 a.m., and
we found him there in his towel," Ceballos said. "His clothes were all
over the floor."</TE>
<TE>   He added, "Individuals we talked to indicate he is always there, that
his car is always there."</TE>
<TE>   Sabatino will be arraigned Jan. 22 on two counts each of felony
perjury by declaration and two counts of filing a false declaration of
candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   The charges come after a seven-month investigation into the school
board member. If convicted, Sabatino faces up to five years in state
prison. State election codes require candidates and school board members
to reside in the district that they represent.</TE>
<TE>   Warrants were served in October at four locations as part of the
investigation into Sabatino, a records manager for the Los Angeles County
Office of Education in Downey. As a school board member, Sabatino
receives $400 a month in compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Sabatino could not be reached for comment Monday. In an October
interview, he denied that he resided at the Downey house he bought in
1996. Sabatino said he lives in a home owned by his mother in an
unincorporated area in the West Covina school district. He listed that
house as his residence when he ran for the school board in 1997 and again
last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a longtime resident. I vote there. My bills come there," he told
The Times. "I spend time at the Downey house because my 17-year-old son
lives there. There isn't a bed there for me. When I stay there, I sleep
on the sofa," said Sabatino, who explained he is a single parent and his
son lives alone.</TE>
<TE>   Ceballos disputed Sabatino's argument. "He doesn't have a room there,"
he said, referring to the home of Sabatino's mother. He said
investigators searched the mother's house and did not find overnight
items such as toiletries and underwear. He said that address is only in
his mother's name in county records, while the Downey address is solely
in Sabatino's name.</TE>
<TE>   Sabatino told The Times that, during the Oct. 26 raid on the Downey
house on Bigby Street, investigators entered with guns drawn.
Investigators questioned him and seized bills and statements from that
house and his mother's house, searched his truck and took files from the
school district offices.</TE>
<TE>   In June 1998, Sabatino refinanced his Downey house using a Federal
Housing Authority-backed loan with a provision that he must use the
property as his "principal residence," records show.</TE>
<TE>   Sabatino is the third elected official or candidate to be charged with
living outside his or her district by the public integrity division
formed last year. In November, a South Gate candidate, Richard Mayer, was
convicted on seven felony counts. Huntington Park Councilwoman Linda
Guevara also has been charged with lying about her residence.</TE>
<TE>   A Democrat, Sabatino has said he is a victim of unfounded accusations
by his political enemies who, like Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley, are
Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Sabatino was appointed to the school board in 1988 to fill a vacancy
after an unsuccessful bid for office a year before. He was reelected in
1989, 1993, 1997 and 2001. In November, he garnered 24% of the vote to
edge out his nearest challenger by 44 votes.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: Vandals Damage School: Vandals scrawled anti-Semitic
graffiti and destroyed property over the weekend in several classrooms at
Erwin Street School in Van Nuys. It was the fourth break-in at the campus
in the last four months but the first hate crime, officials said. Glitter
glue and crayons were strewn across floors and swastikas were
spray-painted on blackboards and desks. Nothing was stolen. Classes were
held outdoors and in the auditorium Monday. At right, students pause to
look at some of the graffiti. Of the 1,000 students in pre-kindergarten
through fifth grade, about 70% are Latino and 20% are Armenian.
Fifth-grade teacher Janice Sonski said she nearly passed out when she saw
a 3-foot red swastika and the words "white power" painted on her
classroom door. "I wanted to cry," she said. Anyone with information is
asked to call police at (818) 893-6423.</CP>

<HD>Whoopi Goldberg Will Host Oscar Ceremony</HD>
<DH>Movies: It's not been decided whether people can watch stars arrive
at the new Kodak Theatre.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Actress and comedian Whoopi Goldberg has been named to host the
74th annual Academy Awards in March.</LD>
<LD>   It is the fourth time that Goldberg has hosted the ceremony--most
recently the 1999 show--but the first time for the Oscars at the new
Kodak Theatre in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   "It'll be the first broadcast done from Oscar's new home, and I love a
housewarming," Goldberg said in a statement. "And this broadcast, in my
opinion, carries a different weight, because it says that we as
filmmakers, actors and technicians worldwide will continue to do what we
do best and celebrate it. And who wouldn't want to front that?"</LD>
<TE>   The Oscar ceremony will be held March 24.</TE>
<TE>   The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has not decided if the
public will be allowed to watch the red carpet arrivals, due to security
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   The ballots for nominations are being sent out today, and the nominees
will be announced Feb. 12.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg, who won a best supporting actress Oscar in 1991 for her
performance in "Ghost" and a nomination in 1985 for her role as Celie in
"The Color Purple," follows Steve Martin as Oscar host; Billy Crystal
hosted in 2000. It was the first time for Martin, the seventh for
Crystal.</TE>
<TE>   Laura Ziskin, who is producing the Oscar show this year, said Goldberg
was chosen for her "great warmth, with humor, humanity and social
conscience, all qualities that I feel are essential for this year's show.
I look forward to collaborating with Whoopi to put on a meaningful and
entertaining evening."</TE>
<TE>   Although she earned Emmy nominations for her performances at the 66th
and 68th annual shows, Goldberg was not well received by many critics in
1999. Entertainment Weekly's Ken Tucker panned that performance as
"assiduously self-congratulatory and determinedly lame hosting."</TE>
<TE>   The Academy Awards for 2001 are widely considered to be one of the
most wide open Oscar races in years, with no clear favorites and a number
of smaller independent films likely to be nominated for major awards.</TE>
<TE>   The Kodak Theatre is part of the new Hollywood &amp; Highland project;
last year's show was at the Shrine Auditorium. The show will be broadcast
live on ABC.</TE>

<HD>Vandals Trash Rooms, Scrawl Swastikas in School Break-In</HD>
<DH>Valley Glen: The incident at the elementary campus, which has been
broken into four times recently, is called a hate crime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vandals scrawled anti-Semitic graffiti and destroyed property in
several classrooms at a San Fernando Valley elementary school in the
fourth break-in in the last four months at the site, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Classes were held outdoors and in the auditorium Monday while police
investigated the break-in at Erwin Street School in Valley Glen.</LD>
<LD>   Nothing was stolen, but school officials could not estimate the damage
to the classrooms and walls.</LD>
<TE>   Principal Carmel Vela-Madady said the weekend incident was the first
break-in classified as a hate crime at the school. Of the 1,000 students
in pre-kindergarten through fifth grade, about 70% are Hispanic and 20%
are Armenian.</TE>
<TE>   In several of the classrooms, glitter glue and crayons were strewn
across the floor and swastikas were spray-painted on blackboards and
desks.</TE>
<TE>   Fifth-grade teacher Janice Sonski said she nearly passed out Monday
when she saw a 3-foot red swastika with the words "White Power" above it
painted on her classroom door.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to cry," Sonski said as she pulled a cart of student
work--which she called her "portable classroom" until her own is
repaired--to her car after school. "This goes beyond being a crime
against a race or religion. This is a crime against humanity."</TE>
<TE>   School district and city officials called for strong repercussions
against the vandals.</TE>
<TE>   "These immature people brought a message of evil and hate to little
children," said City Councilman Jack Weiss. "This goes beyond vandalism."
He said what "disgusted" him most was seeing swastikas filling every inch
of a blackboard in a first-grade classroom.</TE>
<TE>   Repairs were expected to be finished today, although teachers said
they were told to be prepared for another day out of their classrooms.
School officials said they were working with the Los Angeles Unified
School District to improve security at the school, which does not have an
alarm system.</TE>
<TE>   All of Erwin Street's break-ins have involved prying open locks,
Vela-Madady said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just not what we wanted to come back to after our vacation,"
she said. "But the children are handling it well."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information about the crime is asked to call the Los
Angeles Police Department at (818) 893-6423.</TE>

<HD>Car Was Going 106 MPH in Fatal Crash, Police Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Mercedes-Benz station wagon carrying four Westlake High School
students was traveling 106 mph when it spun out of control and smashed
into a brick wall, killing the driver and one passenger three days after
Christmas.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County sheriff's investigators confirmed Monday that excessive
speed was a factor in the crash, Sgt. Patti Salas said.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities are awaiting toxicology tests to determine whether drugs
or alcohol were involved, though Salas said no evidence of either was
found at the scene.</LD>
<TE>   The driver, Kenneth Marshall Glass, 16, and front-seat passenger
Jordan Alexander Bass, 16, were killed in the accident, which occurred
just after 1 a.m. Dec. 28 on Westlake Boulevard near Hillcrest Drive in
Thousand Oaks, just blocks from their school campus. The posted speed
limit is 45 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Joshua Kuai, 16, and Jenae Chu, 16, were injured. Kuai was released
from UCLA Medical Center on Sunday night, authorities said. Chu remained
in good condition at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Woodland Hills
and was expected to be released today.</TE>
<TE>   Glass had a provisional driver's license, which means it was illegal
for him to carry passengers under the age of 20 without a parent,
guardian or licensed driver at least 25 years old in the car, Salas said.
His license also prohibited him from driving between midnight and 5 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Bass, Jordan's father and an attorney in the San Fernando
Valley, declined to comment on whether a lawsuit stemming from his son's
death would be filed.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan's mother, Cheryl Bass, also would not comment on a potential
lawsuit but was surprised by the extent to which police said Glass was
speeding.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, my God," she said, her voice quivering. "I knew they were going
very fast, but I never dreamed it was that fast."</TE>
<TE>   She also said she has known the Glass family for years and that they
are good, responsible parents.</TE>
<TE>   "None of those kids were supposed to get in that car, and they knew
that," Bass said. "They all made a very horrific choice against the very
fabric of what they've been taught."</TE>
<TE>   Salas, the sheriff's investigator, said the speed estimate was based
on physical evidence and skid-mark analysis at the scene. She added that
in her experience investigating accident cases, speeds that high are
rare.</TE>
<TE>   The teens who were killed were described by friends and family members
as smart, athletic and outgoing. Jordan Bass was an avid golfer with
dreams of playing competitively at UCLA. He also played guitar and drums
and was trying to start a rock band.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Glass was a part-time starter for the Westlake High varsity
basketball team. He had just played in a tournament game in Orange
County, which the team won, hours before the accident.</TE>
<TE>   His father, Craig Glass, did not want to comment on the information
released Monday about excessive speed, saying only that he remains sorry
about what happened.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what they did or why they did it," said Glass, an
attorney. "I will dearly miss my son, and my heart goes out to all of the
families involved."</TE>
<TE>   Westlake High School held a memorial service for the two teens Monday
afternoon--the first day back from winter break, said Lou Lightl, an
assistant principal. He said many students are still grieving for the
loss of their friends and classmates.</TE>
<TE>   Teenage driving safety is an increasing concern for police and school
officials in Thousand Oaks. Seven young adults have been killed in
crashes in and around the city since July.</TE>
<TE>   Salas said she spoke with Westlake High officials Monday about teaming
up to develop an education program targeted at parents and students.</TE>
<TE>   "People know they're not supposed to be driving that fast," Salas
said. "We've got to find a way to develop a message that will reach
them."</TE>

<HD>College Cashes In on Trade</HD>
<DH>Business: A weekend swap meet that raises funds for Oxnard campus
booms after Ventura rival closes.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The closure of Ventura County's largest swap meet has sent hundreds
of vendors and customers to a weekend bazaar at Oxnard College that may
generate more than $300,000 this year for scholarships, building projects
and to help needy students.</LD>
<LD>   Operated by the Oxnard College Foundation, the swap meet has grown
from 50 to between 350 and 400 vendors since August, and now operates on
Sundays as well as Saturdays.</LD>
<LD>   "We are a little different because we are actually raising money to
give back to the students," said Connie Owens, the college official who
administers the sales.</LD>
<TE>   Long a modest source of income, netting the college about $35,000 last
school year, the swap meet benefited greatly when the 101 Drive-In on
Telephone Road in Ventura shut down in the summer.</TE>
<TE>   The shift of thousands of customers to Oxnard each weekend means the
college's income from vendor fees could grow more than eight times,
accounting for nearly a third of the foundation's fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big, big help," said Owens, sitting in the college's Reentry
Center, a service for older students that benefits from the funds.</TE>
<TE>   Some vendors who left the 101 Drive-In moved to the Ventura College
Market. But officials there limited the number of vendors because they
wanted to remain the same size, Veronica Beltran of Ventura College said.
It has 270 vendors on Saturdays and 150 on Sundays.</TE>
<TE>   "I was able to take some of them," Beltran said. "But we did not want
to make any problems for the neighbors."</TE>
<TE>   Hosting swap meets has long been an innovative way to raise funds at
some California colleges.</TE>
<TE>   Campuses are natural settings for weekend marketplaces because they
have large parking lots that are typically empty on weekends, and campus
police who can provide security.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard College's swap meet had been operated by its community services
office for years, but it declined until it closed for a few months four
years ago, Owens said. Then the Oxnard College Foundation, with the
Latino-advocacy group El Concilio del Condado de Ventura, decided to take
it over.</TE>
<TE>   Owens said the new managers wanted to capitalize on the area's Latino,
Filipino and Asian residents, who account for most of the vendors and
customers.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Sunday, a mostly Latino crowd trickled into a parking lot
on the eastern side of the campus as salespeople hawked everything from
produce to jewelry to western wear.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the sellers are local, but a number are Los Angeles vendors
who sold goods at the Ventura swap meet.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of the ones I know say they like it here better," said Alicia
Dominguez, who with husband Juan frequently travels to Oxnard from
Torrance to sell inexpensive shoes.</TE>
<TE>   Like the other vendors, the Dominguezes pay $25 to set up their booth
for a single day, or $20 a day if they sign up for the entire month.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the Oxnard College Foundation's increased revenue will go
toward fulfilling its $70,000 endowment goal this year, Owens said. The
college is participating in a five-year federal program that will match
the first $70,000 raised each year by the foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation also gives about $20,000 in scholarships annually and
supports a program that aims to provide a computer for each Oxnard
College student, Owens said.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the foundation also may help the college pave a parking lot
and buy furniture for a new building to house the Reentry Center and
other school groups.</TE>
<TE>   "We started the swap meet thinking it was going to be small--just to
make sure we had enough capital to do our projects," Owens said. "But now
that it has gotten larger, we'll have enough extra income to help in all
the different areas."</TE>

<HD>2 Men Hold Up Bank, Flee With Bag of Cash</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County's first bank robbery of the year occurred Monday
morning when two men held up U.S. Bank in Camarillo and stole an
undisclosed amount of cash, federal authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The holdup occurred just after 10 a.m. at the branch in the 600 block
of Daily Drive. The bank occupies a first-floor suite inside a two-story
building. Neither robber was armed and no one was injured.</LD>
<LD>   According to FBI Special Agent Brent Robbins, a masked robber jumped
over the counter, opened a cash drawer and stuffed bills into a bag while
the other man, who wasn't masked, stood at the front door.</LD>
<TE>   The men fled in a stolen 1989 Toyota station wagon, which was
abandoned about a block away. Authorities believe they left the county in
a second vehicle parked nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have a surveillance video of the robbery and plan to dust
the stolen car for fingerprints. The men could also be responsible for a
Bank of America holdup in Thousand Oaks last month, Robbins said.</TE>

<HD>Police Estimate Speed at 106 MPH in Fatal Crash</HD>
<DH>Accident: Two teenagers were killed when vehicle hit a brick wall
in Thousand Oaks. Two of the passengers are recovering.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Mercedes-Benz station wagon carrying four Westlake High School
students was traveling 106 mph when it spun out of control and smashed
into a brick wall, killing the driver and one passenger three days after
Christmas.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County sheriff's investigators confirmed Monday that excessive
speed was a factor in the crash, Sgt. Patti Salas said.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities are awaiting toxicology tests to determine whether drugs
or alcohol were involved, though Salas said no evidence of either was
found at the scene.</LD>
<TE>   The driver, Kenneth Marshall Glass, 16, and front-seat passenger
Jordan Alexander Bass, 16, were killed in the accident, which occurred
just after 1 a.m. Dec. 28 on Westlake Boulevard near Hillcrest Drive in
Thousand Oaks, just blocks from their school campus. The posted speed
limit is 45 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Joshua Kuai, 16, and Jenae Chu, 16, were injured. Kuai was released
from UCLA Medical Center on Sunday night, authorities said. Chu remained
in good condition at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Woodland Hills
and was expected to be released today.</TE>
<TE>   Glass had a provisional driver's license, which means it was illegal
for him to carry passengers under the age of 20 without a parent,
guardian or licensed driver at least 25 years old in the car, Salas said.
His license also prohibited him from driving between midnight and 5 a.m.</TE>
<TE>No Comments on Possible Lawsuit</TE>
<TE>   Robert Bass, Jordan's father and an attorney in the San Fernando
Valley, declined to comment on whether a lawsuit stemming from his son's
death would be filed.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan's mother, Cheryl Bass, also would not comment on a potential
lawsuit but was surprised by the extent to which police said Glass was
speeding.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, my God," she said, her voice quivering. "I knew they were going
very fast, but I never dreamed it was that fast."</TE>
<TE>   She also said she has known the Glass family for years and that they
are good, responsible parents.</TE>
<TE>   "None of those kids were supposed to get in that car, and they knew
that," Bass said. "They all made a very horrific choice against the very
fabric of what they've been taught."</TE>
<TE>   Salas, the sheriff's investigator, said the speed estimate was based
on physical evidence and skid-mark analysis at the scene. She added that
in her experience investigating accident cases, speeds that high are
rare.</TE>
<TE>   The teens who were killed were described by friends and family members
as smart, athletic and outgoing. Jordan Bass was an avid golfer with
dreams of playing competitively at UCLA. He also played guitar and drums
and was trying to start a rock band.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Glass was a part-time starter for the Westlake High varsity
basketball team. He had just played in a tournament game in Orange
County, which the team won, hours before the accident.</TE>
<TE>   His father, Craig Glass, did not want to comment on the information
released Monday about excessive speed, saying only that he remains sorry
about what happened.</TE>
<TE>High School Holds Service for Victims</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what they did or why they did it," said Glass, an
attorney. "I will dearly miss my son, and my heart goes out to all of the
families involved."</TE>
<TE>   Westlake High School held a memorial service for the two teens Monday
afternoon--the first day back from winter break, said Lou Lightl, an
assistant principal. He said many students are still grieving for the
loss of their friends and classmates.</TE>
<TE>   Teenage driving safety is an increasing concern for police and school
officials in Thousand Oaks. Seven young adults have been killed in
crashes in and around the city since July.</TE>
<TE>   Salas said she spoke with Westlake High officials Monday about teaming
up to develop an education program targeted at parents and students.</TE>
<TE>   "People know they're not supposed to be driving that fast," Salas
said. "We've got to find a way to develop a message that will reach
them."</TE>

<HD>District Would Limit Growth</HD>
<DH>Land use: Supervisors are expected to support legislation that
would prevent development in the area. It would be funded with local
taxes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County supervisors are expected to back the creation of a
land-preservation district today, reviving a proposal that has been
blocked for months by one supervisor.</LD>
<LD>   Four supervisors--Steve Bennett, John Flynn, Kathy Long and Frank
Schillo--say they favor immediately asking state lawmakers to proceed
with the legislation necessary to put the district's formation on a local
ballot.</LD>
<LD>   Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara), who sponsored the
bill at the request of the Board of Supervisors, has dropped her
insistence that board members give it unanimous backing. That clears the
way for it to move through the legislative session that began Monday.</LD>
<TE>   If approved, a ballot measure on the district's formation will
tentatively be set for March 2004. The district would be funded either
through a sales tax increase or a property tax assessment.</TE>
<TE>   The district would purchase open space, farmland and parks across the
county to act as a buffer against runaway growth. It is intended as the
long-term successor to the SOAR anti-sprawl initiatives, which will begin
to expire in 2020.</TE>
<TE>Poll Indicates Strong Support</TE>
<TE>   The district has been in the works since 1998, when 68% of the
county's voters said they wanted one. A recent public opinion poll
commissioned by the supervisors confirmed broad support.</TE>
<TE>   But Jackson abruptly pulled the legislation last summer after
Supervisor Judy Mikels lodged opposition. Mikels said the bill put too
much emphasis on acquiring parks and that more time was needed to refine
its language.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson has since dropped her insistence that the legislation have
unanimous board support.</TE>
<TE>   "If one supervisor just doesn't want an open-space district, I don't
think that should basically sabotage the bill," Jackson said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Mikels said she still has concerns, but she said she might support the
bill today if the board agrees that it won't form the district without
placing it on a ballot. An earlier version of the legislation gave
supervisors the option of creating the district themselves.</TE>
<TE>Board to Name Advisory Panel</TE>
<TE>   Mikels said she wants a citizens advisory committee, appointed by the
supervisors and city officials, to give recommendations on ballot
language, funding measures and land-purchase priorities.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors are expected to create the advisory committee today. They
also will discuss the possibility of sharing the $416,000 cost of
creating the district with environmental groups that have expressed
interest in working with the county.</TE>
<TE>   But the most important thing the supervisors can do today is give the
clear signal that Ventura County wants a district, Flynn said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we can wait any longer," he said. "We have direction
from the voters to move ahead on this. The voters rule the roost and they
want an open-space district."</TE>

<HD>Claim Is Filed in School Beating</HD>
<DH>Education: The mother of a 14-year-old boy seeks more than $1
million from Orange Unified. Her son spent five days in intensive care.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The mother of an Orange middle school student brutally beaten by
classmates on his birthday has filed a negligence claim of more than $1
million against the school district.</LD>
<LD>   "It takes a price tag of this size for them to take notice," the boy's
mother, Robyn Worden, 40, said Monday. "I hope this will open their
eyes."</LD>
<LD>   The administrative claim, often a precursor to a lawsuit, was filed by
Worden on behalf of her son. It was received Monday by the Orange Unified
School District.</LD>
<TE>   On Oct. 5, three Portola Middle School students, all 13 at the time,
allegedly pummeled Jeremy Worden on his 14th birthday, during what
students said was a ritual that got out of hand.</TE>
<TE>   The boy spent five days in UCI Medical Center's intensive care unit
with a bruised spleen and has been home-schooled since.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the alleged attackers have been expelled and a third will have
a final expulsion hearing next week in front of the district Board of
Trustees. All three have been charged with assault. Trials are pending.</TE>
<TE>   Students at Portola have said it was customary for children to
playfully strike those celebrating birthdays, but called what happened to
Jeremy an aberration. School officials have since cracked down on the
tradition.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all shocked and disappointed and surprised and very sorry
that the incident happened," said Orange education board President Robert
Viviano. He declined to comment on Worden's claim because of potential
legal action.</TE>
<TE>   Viviano said Portola and district officials have improved student
safety since the incident, including hiring a second administrator in
charge of district campus security.</TE>
<TE>   But Worden said that is not enough. She wants to see more uniformed
police officers at Portola, where Jeremy is scheduled to return this
month.</TE>
<TE>   Worden's claim alleges Portola officials, including former Principal
Grace Campillo and Assistant Principal Sheldon Glass, failed to provide
adequate supervision for the students.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole system failed Jeremy that day," Worden said. "I don't want
to see this happen to another child."</TE>

<HD>Texas Boy to Appear in Arson Case</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 12-year-old Texas boy suspected of causing a San Clemente brush
fire that destroyed more than $4 million in property will probably arrive
in Orange County this week to answer to arson charges, according to
prosecutors.</LD>
<LD>   The boy, whose name authorities have not released, will be accompanied
by his parents in a tentative deal worked out with the boy's lawyer. But
if the boy doesn't arrive by Friday, Deputy Dist. Atty. Joe Williams said
he will initiate extradition proceedings.</LD>
<LD>   Defense lawyer John Barnett declined to comment Monday.</LD>
<TE>   The charges stem from an Aug. 1 brush fire that swept through
Trafalgar Canyon and destroyed six homes. Nobody was injured in the
blaze, but dozens of residents were evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, prosecutors announced they were filing charges against the
boy in Juvenile Court, alleging he tossed matches into brush in the
canyon and prevented two younger boys from extinguishing the flames.</TE>
<TE>   The boy, who lives in El Paso but was visiting at the time of the
fire, faces three counts of arson to an inhabited structure and one count
of arson to a forest.</TE>

<HD>Dreamers on the Move in Brea</HD>
<DH>Planning: The city is asking residents to drive or take provided
transportation to six sites to share their visions of their town's
future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brea planners have a simple request of their residents: Dream big.</LD>
<LD>   As part of the General Plan update--a bureaucratic, potentially boring
process--city officials are asking residents to take a look around, let
their imagination run wild and give their opinions on what the city
should become. They're even offering free transportation for a Jan. 19
"workshop on wheels."</LD>
<LD>   At each of six designated spots, residents will be interviewed by city
staff and given the opportunity to shape Brea's future.</LD>
<TE>   "We're really trying to get folks to seriously dream about the
future," City Planner David Crabtree said. "What is it that they want to
see happen? What shape do they want the future of the city to take?"</TE>
<TE>   It is no surprise that Brea is going the extra mile, literally, to get
people involved. The city embarked on a nationally recognized Art in
Public Places campaign in 1975, requiring every development costing more
than $1.5 million to contribute 1% of its value to outdoor sculpture for
public display. As a result, Brea now has 130 sculptures and art displays
scattered across the city.</TE>
<TE>   "Brea tends to be on the forefront of a lot of things," said Michael
Gold, deputy director of the Orange County League of California Cities.
"I think this is probably a way to better involve folks. I know that
increased public involvement has been the trend over the past few years
because people are just more aware of their community and want to be more
in touch with what the community is doing."</TE>
<TE>   Such strategies as workshops on wheels have become a tenet of wise
development, senior planner Karen Haluza said. "We'll put our Brea twist
on it, so it will be unique," she added.</TE>
<TE>   The Jan. 19 event is actually a self-guided driving tour with six
stops, but public transportation will be available for those who request
it.</TE>
<TE>   Among the stops will be the Brea Marketplace, South Brea Boulevard,
the hillside areas bordering the northern edge of the city, and Unocal's
Hartley Research Center.</TE>
<TE>   The other stops are to be determined.</TE>
<TE>   City staff will have photos to help start the discussion, with before
and after pictures of other developed areas and examples of what some
cities have done.</TE>
<TE>   "It just makes sense to get people out into the community," Haluza
said. "It's so much better than having people sit in a room and say,
'Now, tell me what you think of the west side of town.' "</TE>
<TE>   After the public input is compiled, it will be synthesized into a
draft general plan and presented first to the Planning Commission, then
to the City Council for adoption.</TE>
<TE>   Minor amendments to the General Plan are made periodically, and Brea
hasn't done a comprehensive overhaul since 1986.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the process is completed this spring, the city will have
an updated plan that includes an overview as well as details on such
matters as traffic patterns, noise levels and growth management.</TE>
<TE>   Brea has been growing steadily over the years, with a population now
just over 36,000. But how fast the city should grow--or whether it
should--are some of the issues to be addressed in the General Plan.</TE>
<TE>   Prime candidates for development, Crabtree said, are the hillside
areas not within city limits.</TE>
<TE>   But the city could seek to develop and annex them in the future if
area residents and officials decide to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Glenn Parker, formerly on the City Council and now a member of the
General Plan Advisory Committee, said the field-trip approach has worked
well for other Brea projects.</TE>
<TE>   During planning for downtown, for example, the city held a Downtown
Idea Fair.</TE>
<TE>   More than 250 people visited downtown alongside city planners. They
talked about architecture, public-spaces art and signage. Now, much of
what they envisioned has been implemented in the form of movie theaters,
restaurants and loft apartments.</TE>
<TE>   "It helps people stimulate their imagination and their thoughts,"
Parker said. "When you're sitting in a room, it's hard to remember
things."</TE>
<TE>   Different approaches to planning--advisory committees, workshops at
community centers and bus tours--ensure that a cross-section of residents
comes forward, Parker said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important that we have as many people involved as possible
to represent the whole community," he said.</TE>

<LD>Ventura County fire officials have scheduled a 100-acre controlled
burn today near Steckel Park, just outside Santa Paula.</LD>
<LD>   Weather permitting, firefighters will torch stacks of cut brush
between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m., said Terry Raley, the department's wild land
fire officer.</LD>
<LD>   The controlled burn, the county's first of the year, is being done to
prepare for a larger controlled burn later this year. The burn area is
near a ranch just off California 150.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, there were 55 controlled burns, with about 3,000 acres
torched. About 60 controlled burns are planned this year, Raley said.</TE>

<LD>Orange County voters remain opposed to a commercial airport at the
closed El Toro Marine base but aren't quite as sure about putting a park
on the base, according to a poll by a pro-airport group.</LD>
<LD>   In the survey commissioned by the Orange County Business Council,
about half the voters favored the park measure on the March ballot or
were leaning that way. Four in 10 opposed it. The airport plan was
opposed by 54% of those responding to the survey, conducted Dec. 17 and
18.</LD>

<HD>Davis to Ask for Broader Wiretaps</HD>
<DH>Security: The governor is expected to seek power for state, local
police to eavesdrop on any phone used by suspects, not just specific
numbers. E-mail also could be tapped.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis is calling for expanded authority to wiretap
Californians' phones and e-mail in the name of protecting against
terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   As outlined Monday by his top security advisor, former FBI agent
George Vinson, the legislation Davis seeks is similar to the Patriot Act
signed into law by President Bush in October. The governor's aides said
New York has adopted a similar statute, and proposals are pending in
Arizona and Washington state.</LD>
<LD>   Davis is expected to announce the proposal when he delivers his State
of the State speech tonight. Already, Democratic leaders in the
Legislature have expressed skepticism, suggesting the plan may have
difficulty winning majority support.</LD>
<TE>   The governor wants to grant authority to state and local police to
obtain court-approved "roving" wiretaps, allowing them to listen in on
any phone used by criminal suspects, rather than specific phone numbers
as permitted under current state law, Vinson said.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Davis is calling for legislation that would allow state
and local police to tap into e-mail communications and Internet sites,
something permitted under the federal act approved after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Although the proposal is pegged to the threat of terrorism, the
wiretap authority could be sought for any criminal investigation.</TE>
<TE>   California has had a statute since the mid-1990s permitting police to
tap specific phones of suspects primarily in drug and gang-related
investigations. But if suspects change telephones, police must apply to
judges for a new warrant.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who faces reelection in November, was working on what would be
his fourth and final State of the State speech in his first term as
governor. He has rewritten it several times, his aides said. Roughly a
fourth of the latest version was devoted to public safety and terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   If that holds, it signals that Davis will make law enforcement
positions a fundamental part of his campaign strategy. In his 1998
election campaign against former Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, Davis emphasized
his support of the death penalty and his backing from police.</TE>
<TE>   The state's existing wiretap law, which is far narrower than federal
statutes, has not been widely used. In 2000, there were 88 court orders
approving wiretaps in California.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, defense attorneys have challenged the use of wiretaps by Los
Angeles law enforcement authorities in pending cases seeking to have
convictions reversed.</TE>
<TE>   Vinson said the governor's goal is not necessarily to make it easier
for police to obtain court orders allowing electronic eavesdropping.
Rather, Davis wants to make the state's use of wiretaps more effective.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal would permit police to "wiretap the criminal or terrorist
so that if they start tossing phones, the authority to listen in on that
criminal activity follows the criminal," said Vinson, who was recruited
by Davis to be his security advisor after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "He wants to see California law enforcement modernized in their
techniques in investigating terrorists," Vinson said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' fellow Democrats in the Legislature were dubious.</TE>
<TE>   Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) noted that the
federal government "already has that power." Added Sen. Richard Polanco,
chairman of the Public Safety Committee, which would review the
legislation, "The feds have that authority, so why does the state need
it?"</TE>
<TE>   Senate Republican Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga said Davis'
proposal "makes sense," and dismissed opposition voiced by Senate
Democrats by saying: "Many of the Democrats in the state Legislature are
significantly more liberal than Americans as a whole."</TE>
<TE>   Vinson said terrorism investigations will remain primarily a federal
responsibility. But he said local police could open investigations using
state court-authorized wiretaps, and turn the matters over to the FBI
once the cases expand. At that point, the FBI could seek eavesdropping
authority under the broader federal wiretap statutes.</TE>
<TE>   Francisco Lobaco, lobbyist for the ACLU in Sacramento, denounced the
plan, saying innocent people could end up having police eavesdrop on
their private communications. "If the governor's proposal mirrors the new
federal law, then it will impose major intrusions into innocent people's
private lives," Lobaco said.</TE>
<TE>   The ACLU's Web site details its opposition to expanded surveillance
authority in the Patriot Act. The new federal law lowers the standard for
obtaining wiretap authority, the site says, requiring judges to
rubber-stamp any request law-enforcement deems "relevant to an ongoing
criminal investigation."</TE>
<TE>   And, it says, the law extends "this low threshold of proof to Internet
communications that are far more revealing than the numbers dialed to or
from a telephone, and to portions of e-mail communications that cannot
readily be separated from content."</TE>
<TE>   In his speech tonight, the governor is expected to acknowledge several
family members of victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, along with
police, firefighters and National Guard troops who will be in the gallery
overlooking the Assembly chamber, where he will give the address.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to talking about terrorism and public safety, Davis likely
will underscore his desire to continue funding public schools and health
care for children, while not cutting state aid to local government, Davis
spokesman Steve Maviglio said.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the state faces a budget deficit estimated to be $12
billion, Maviglio said, the governor remains intent on not raising taxes.
Davis likely will refer to ideas to stimulate the economy, and is
planning a news conference for Wednesday to further explain his plan.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction to the speech is sure to be sharper as the Democratic
governor lags in public opinion polls. All three Republican opponents,
former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, Secretary of State Bill Jones

<TE>   "Our hope is that he will not put on rose-colored glasses or try to
use security challenges confronting California for his own political
purposes," said Riordan advisor Kevin Spillane. "We need to have a candid
discussion of how California gets out of the energy debacle and budget
crisis."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Keeps Pressure on Al Qaeda</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Bombers target area in east where militants are
repeatedly trying to rearm and regroup, Pentagon says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Surviving leaders of the Al Qaeda terrorist network are repeatedly
trying to regroup at a warren of caves and bunkers in eastern
Afghanistan, despite three attacks on the complex in four days by U.S.
warplanes, senior Pentagon officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The most recent strike on the Zhawar Kili al Badr training camp, late
Sunday night, hit tanks and artillery, officials said. But military
intelligence analysts say they believe the camp, which snakes down a
narrow, winding desert valley near the town of Khowst, still harbors
terrorist militants.</LD>
<LD>   It is the same site hit by U.S. cruise missiles in 1998 in the Clinton
administration's unsuccessful attempt to strike at Osama bin Laden and
his top aides. It includes a number of caves built into the valley's
sheer cliff walls and is difficult to eradicate, said Rear Adm. John D.
Stufflebeem, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</LD>
<TE>   "We bombed again yesterday," Stufflebeem told reporters at a Pentagon
briefing Monday. "But we're not done there. . . . Something's coming out
of the ground. And we're after it."</TE>
<TE>   In discussing the repeated strikes on the training camp, and on other
suspected terrorist hide-outs in recent weeks, Stufflebeem painted a
picture of small bands of Al Qaeda loyalists on the run throughout
Afghanistan but persistently seeking to rearm and regroup where they can.</TE>
<TE>   "They are obviously widely dispersed," Stufflebeem said. "They are
attempting to regroup so that they can amass for leadership and mischief
purposes. . . . They're just trying to find each other and then,
obviously, to continue their war."</TE>
<TE>   Warplanes also struck Sunday in Khowst, about 10 miles from the
training camp, destroying what Pentagon officials described Monday as a
small cache of antiaircraft weapons. Khowst is known as the headquarters
of a former minister in the ousted Taliban regime, Jalaluddin Haqqani,
who is wanted by the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The strikes in Khowst and at the Zhawar Kili training camp were among
118 sorties flown by U.S. warplanes over Afghanistan on Sunday. The
aircraft involved included one B-52 and two B-1 bombers, one Navy F/A-18
jet fighter and one low-flying AC-130 gunship, Pentagon officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon has been particularly intent on striking Zhawar Kili,
hitting it with 250 bombs last week alone. But Stufflebeem denied reports
that Bin Laden was believed to be hiding at the compound.</TE>
<TE>   Stufflebeem said the camp, composed of three separate training areas
and two cave complexes, has drawn attention because it is a particularly
large Al Qaeda command center. Some Al Qaeda fighters might have
gravitated there from Tora Bora, the site of heavy bombing by U.S.
warplanes in December.</TE>
<TE>   "There are obviously still Al Qaeda and pro-Taliban [fighters] that
are loose there, and we're continuing to find them, and we're continuing
to strike their equipment as we've found them," Stufflebeem said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, U.S. forces continue to take Taliban and Al Qaeda members
into custody. The total number of detainees stood at 346 on Monday,
Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke said.</TE>
<TE>   Several senior members of the Taliban had surrendered, including three
ministers in the old regime, a spokesman for the governor of Kandahar
province told the Reuters news agency today.</TE>
<TE>   "Ministers of the Taliban and senior Taliban are coming one by one and
surrendering and joining with us," Khalid Pashtoon said. "Among those who
surrendered were former Minister of Defense Mullah Obaidulla, Minister of
Justice Mullah [Nooruddin] Turabi and Minister of Mines and Industry
Mullah Saadudin [Sayed]."</TE>
<TE>   Stufflebeem would not say how many senior Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders
were in U.S. custody. "We know senior leadership is being detained. We
know senior leadership has been killed. And we know senior leadership is
not yet in [U.S.] custody," he said.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,000 troops, most of them military police and construction
crews, were deployed over the weekend to the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba, to beef up security at former refugee camp sites that are
being transformed to hold the prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, British Prime Minister Tony Blair visited Afghanistan,
the first Western head of government to visit Kabul since the attacks on
New York and the Pentagon on Sept. 11, and he promised Afghans that the
world will not forget them.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking at Bagram air base north of Kabul, Blair said the
consequences of past neglect have been grave.</TE>
<TE>   "Afghanistan has been a failed state for too long, and the whole world
has paid the price--in the export of terror, the export of drugs and,
finally, in the explosion in death and destruction on the streets of the
U.S.," he told a news conference at the base.</TE>
<TE>   Blair flew into Bagram in the dead of night on a British Royal Air
Force C-130 Hercules transport with his wife, Cherie, and about a dozen
British government officials.</TE>
<TE>   They were met at the airport by Hamid Karzai, the leader of
Afghanistan's interim government. Blair was also expected to meet the
commander of British forces in Afghanistan, Maj. Gen. John McColl, and
the United Nations envoy to Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi.</TE>
<TE>   Blair praised British troops leading the U.N.-mandated International
Security Assistance Force in Kabul. About 500 British troops are deployed
in the Afghan capital, and 1,000 more are on the way. The full force is
expected to eventually number 4,500 troops, with detachments from up to
16 nations.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday night, a delegation of nine U.S. senators met with Karzai,
vowing to participate in Afghanistan's long-term reconstruction.</TE>
<TE>   After the meeting, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), who is leading
the delegation along with Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), promised continued
U.S. involvement in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "On our part, it is very critical that we remain here. I think we
learned at a very high and painful price the cost of a lack of
involvement in Central Asia on Sept. 11--and we're not going to let it
happen again," Lieberman said. "We're not going to repeat the mistake
that was made when the Soviets were pushed out of here and the rest of
the world essentially walked away."</TE>
<TE>   The senators, touring South and Central Asia, arrived at Bagram air
base for a stopover visit before continuing their trip.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Canada said Monday that it is sending 750 troops of a light
infantry battle group to Kandahar in southern Afghanistan as part of a
U.S. Army-led task force.</TE>

<HD>Yves Saint Laurent Bids Adieu to Couture Career</HD>
<DH>Fashion: The French designer helped shape not only an industry but
women's identities.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>PARIS
</DL>
<LD>Any doubt that 20th century fashion belongs to history was put to
rest in the chic Right Bank salon of Yves Saint Laurent on Monday when
the last of the great couturiers bowed out of the industry that he helped
shape for more than 40 years.</LD>
<LD>   He is the designer who popularized trousers for women and dressed
actress Catherine Deneuve in elegance. He made Mondrian paintings into
clothes and clothes into poetry for generations of women.</LD>
<LD>   But Saint Laurent, 65, said his spring haute couture collection--to be
shown later this month along with a retrospective of his work--will be
his last.</LD>
<TE>   The announcement marked the end of a fashion era defined by Christian
Dior, Coco Chanel and Saint Laurent. The Saint Laurent couture salon will
close, but the YSL Rive Gauche ready-to-wear line will continue under a
different owner and designer.</TE>
<TE>   "In many ways, I feel that I have created the wardrobe of the
contemporary woman and that I have participated in the transformation of
my times," Saint Laurent told a news conference here.</TE>
<TE>   "For a long time now, I have believed that fashion was not only
supposed to make women beautiful but to reassure them, to give them
confidence, to enable them to assert themselves," he said. "However, I
have chosen today to bid adieu to this profession that I have loved so
much."</TE>
<TE>   Shy and reclusive, Saint Laurent read his statement through his
trademark thick glasses, then departed quickly without taking questions
about his decision to close the fashion house that he founded with his
friend and business partner, Pierre Berge.</TE>
<TE>   Saint Laurent infused women's fashion with sex and power in an era of
women's liberation. He introduced to high fashion the trench coat and the
see-through blouse, the safari jacket and diaphanous skirt, and posed
nude for his own perfume ads.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Saint Laurent has complained about the rock-concert
style that younger designers, such as Jean-Paul Gaultier and Britain's
John Galliano of Christian Dior, have applied to women's fashion. He also
is said to have been at odds with the executives of Italy's Gucci Group,
which bought the Rive Gauche label and beauty business in 1999 and will
continue them under American designer Tom Ford.</TE>
<TE>   Berge said Monday that he believes this alienation is the reason for
Saint Laurent's retirement.</TE>
<TE>   "He no longer feels at ease in a world where people use women instead
of serving them," Berge said. Asserting Saint Laurent's predominance in
the fashion world, he added, "It's not very fun to play a tennis match
when you are all alone."</TE>
<TE>Depression and Health Problems Dogged Career</TE>
<TE>   Saint Laurent is known to have battled ill health and depression for
many years and had been hinting that he might retire out of weariness. At
the news conference in his gold and mirrored salon, he referred to his
demons as inspiration.</TE>
<TE>   "Every man needs aesthetic phantoms in order to exist. I have hunted
mine out, pursued them, tracked them down. I have grappled with anguish,
and I have been through sheer hell. I have known fear and the terrors of
solitude. I have known those fair-weather friends we call tranquilizers
and drugs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was able to come through all of that, dazzled yet sober," he added.
"It was Marcel Proust who taught me that 'the magnificent and pitiful
family of the hypersensitive are the salt of the earth.' I, without
knowing it, was a part of that family."</TE>
<TE>   Yves Henri Donat Mathieu Saint Laurent was born in Oran, Algeria. His
father owned a chain of movie theaters, and his doting mother served as
the boy's first muse. As Saint Laurent once wrote, "I can still see my
mother about to leave for a ball, coming to kiss me good night, wearing a
long dress of white tulle with pear-shaped sequins."</TE>
<TE>   He started working as a design assistant for Christian Dior in 1955,
and when Dior died suddenly less than two years later, he took over the
fashion house at the age of 21. By January 1958, the debut of his
trapeze-silhouette collection for Dior couture was received with
great--and at the time unmatched--fanfare.</TE>
<TE>   Saint Laurent presented his first fashion show under his own name in
1962 and stayed ahead of the times by creating dramatic new approaches to
clothing that have had lasting impact.</TE>
<TE>   His deluxe-hippie look, along with his peasant skirts and blouses, has
reverberated through international fashion since its debut decades ago.
In 1965, he applied modern art to fashion with his color-blocked Mondrian
dresses. The next year, he shocked the design world with tuxedos for
women. He introduced the skimpy sweater and the leather biker jacket to
high fashion and married ethnic influences from Africa and India to
Western fashion.</TE>
<TE>   "Saint Laurent all but invented what we now understand clothing to be
and as such is perhaps the founding father of contemporary fashion," the
Times of London said in an editorial. "As perhaps only a Frenchman could,
he both anticipated the most profound social change of the 20th
century--the dramatic alteration in the social and economic status of
women--and adapted to it."</TE>
<TE>   His influence has been felt all over the world. New York designer
Donna Karan said Monday that when she thinks of Saint Laurent, she thinks
of color and "his mix of cultures, his passion for Morocco, for Paris. It
has been a beautiful thing to have been in his moment."</TE>
<TE>   His life has been a productive and combustible mixture of timing,
talent and psychological turmoil. After being drafted into the army in
1960, he had a nervous breakdown. When the Dior house refused to take him
back, he successfully sued the designer and used the proceeds to start
his own business.</TE>
<TE>   He produced in spite of, or perhaps because of, his addictions--drugs,
alcohol, cigarettes, Coca-Cola--and his depression. For years at his
shows, audiences held their breath as much for the mental and physical
state of the designer as for the designs.</TE>
<TE>   But with amazing regularity, Saint Laurent introduced shocking, and
much-copied, innovations in fashion. Long before Calvin Klein thought to
sell denim with explicit sexuality, Saint Laurent posed nude in an ad for
the 1971 debut of his first men's fragrance.</TE>
<TE>   The Saint Laurent revolution slowed throughout the 1990s. In 1993,
Berge and the designer opened the doors for change when they sold the
ready-to-wear and fragrance portions of the business to the
pharmaceutical giant Sanofi, but they retained control of the haute
couture division.</TE>
<TE>Designer Relinquished Ready-to-Wear in 1998</TE>
<TE>   Five years later, Saint Laurent gave the first inkling of his desire
to slow down when he handed the design reins for his ready-to-wear
collection to Alber Elbaz so that he could focus solely on handmade
couture. Then Gucci Group purchased Sanofi Beaute, which owned the Rive
Gauche ready-to-wear label and the lucrative fragrances. By the beginning
of 2000, Gucci designer Ford had replaced Elbaz and assumed control of
the ready-to-wear.</TE>
<TE>   Not always happy with Ford's approach, Saint Laurent didn't fade into
the background. Days before Ford's debut as the new YSL designer, Saint
Laurent opened a Paris boutique selling remakes of his classics just a
few doors away from the under-construction, Gucci-controlled YSL
boutique.</TE>
<TE>   This has caused some to suggest that Saint Laurent and Berge might
rise again.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the fashion world noted that Saint Laurent had threatened
but never announced his retirement before. They too wondered if he has
put down his needle and thread for good.</TE>
<TE>   "I have troubles explaining this decision because he breathed and
lived through his work," said writer Edmonde Charles-Roux, a friend. But
she added: "I keep inside my heart the certitude that he has plans in
mind, that he has reserved a surprise for us. He must know today what he
will do tomorrow."</TE>

<HD>Questions Lurk in a Dead Village</HD>
<DH>War: U.S. says it bombed hamlet to kill Talibs. But locals claim
military fell victim to misinformation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>QALAYE NIAZI, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>No one can be found to tell this story firsthand. There is
disagreement from those who live nearby about the details of the bombing.</LD>
<LD>   But what is clear is that where a small village once stood in the arid
plains of east-central Afghanistan, there is little left but torn
clothing, piles of brick, pieces of human flesh and hair, and a
substantial stockpile of small-arms ammunition.</LD>
<LD>   The United States launched a fierce bomb attack on Qalaye Niazi before
dawn Dec. 29, as its inhabitants slept after a wedding celebration. Ten
homes are said to have been destroyed and dozens of people killed; the
exact numbers are in dispute.</LD>
<TE>   What isn't clear is why the village became an American target.</TE>
<TE>   The story of Qalaye Niazi raises difficult questions about the
accuracy of the local information the United States is getting about the
whereabouts of remaining Al Qaeda fighters. In this instance, and in the
Dec. 20 bombing of a convoy of tribal elders headed to Kabul, the
capital, for the new government's installation, it appears that the U.S.
military may have unwittingly become prey to misinformation from local
tribal chiefs and their cohorts, all of whom are competing for power and
territorial control.</TE>
<TE>   "People have received satellite phones for working as local agents.
And there have always been enmities and tribal disagreements in the
area," said Fazlullah, governor of Lowgar province, just to the north of
Paktia province, where the bombing took place.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no specific argument, just settling old scores and revenge.
As each regime has come they have wanted revenge on those in the previous
regime that have been unjust or cruel," said Fazlullah, who uses only one
name.</TE>
<TE>   Maj. Brad Lowell, a spokesman for the U.S. Central Command in Tampa,
Fla., acknowledged that American forces have given out satellite phones
to local Afghans to help identify suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban
hide-outs. He said those reports are always double-and triple-checked
with U.S. special operations forces on the ground, intelligence reports
from reconnaissance aircraft and other sources.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Special Forces have been in close contact with local groups in
the country for more than 90 days, Lowell said.</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the concern that the Afghans might steer U.S. warplanes
wrong, Lowell said: "We recognize the possibility of those types of
scenarios, and it's not like we would let someone like that call in the
airstrike. There is a process that we have. There are checks and balances
set forth to keep that from happening. We shouldn't rely on just a single
piece of information."</TE>
<TE>   The Qalaye Niazi episode epitomizes the dilemma the U.S. faces at this
stage of the war in Afghanistan. If the military is going to eliminate
every suspected former Taliban fighter still drifting around Afghanistan,
civilian deaths may be unavoidable.</TE>
<TE>   In the minds of tribal elders, relatives of Qalaye Niazi residents and
leaders of neighboring provinces, there is no doubt that the inhabitants
of the village were civilians, innocent of any activity related to
terrorism. The United States military has claimed that Taliban leaders
were hiding among the villagers.</TE>
<TE>   "These were just civilian people, businesspeople, poor people and
nomadic people," said Haji Saifullah, head of the tribal council, or
shura, in Paktia province.</TE>
<TE>   "The Americans received incorrect information to bomb that place,"
Saifullah said. "Maybe someone told them that they were Al Qaeda or
Taliban. There are so many people who have satellite phones. The person
may have reported that for revenge."</TE>
<TE>   According to U.S. officials, two surface-to-air missiles were fired at
the bombers during the raid. "We have identified that as a military
target," Lowell said, adding that the Pentagon has investigated the
Qalaye Niazi strike damage. "We have multiple ways to confirm."</TE>
<TE>   There are few black-and-white situations in Afghanistan. A walk around
Qalaye Niazi, for instance, makes clear that women and children were
killed by the U.S. bombing--there are fragments of skull with black
braided hair decorated with silver thread--an accessory common among
women in this region. And in Afghan society more than many others, women
have no role in the country's military or political life--they are true
civilians.</TE>
<TE>   But it is also evident that tons of munitions were stored
here--hundreds of boxes of .50-caliber machine-gun bullets used in
antitank weapons, antitank shoulder-fired missiles, crates of
rocket-propelled grenades, 90-millimeter shells and mortar rounds. What
was a village of about 100 people doing with all that ammunition?</TE>
<TE>   Further complicating matters, many Taliban officials have melted into
civilian life, and many tribal rivalries that have simmered for years
have broken into the open.</TE>
<TE>   "These tribal feuds have always been there--over land rights, water
rights--and when the Taliban left it was a free-for-all and everyone
wants a fiefdom of their own," said Amir Usman, the former Pakistani
ambassador to Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. does not understand the ways of Afghans, the willingness to
go to any lengths to eliminate an enemy, and these satellite phones
appear to have been distributed rather indiscriminately," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Paktia province, where both of the recent controversial bombings
occurred, lies along the east-central border of the country, where
mountain peaks rise to more than 10,000 feet. Some local residents and
commanders say Al Qaeda members and senior Taliban leaders passed through
the province on their way to hiding places in the mountains or in
Pakistan. It is difficult to know if a few are still hiding in small
villages such as Qalaye Niazi.</TE>
<TE>   Qalaye Niazi is a collection of hamlets separated by long stretches of
Afghan plain. The dwellings that were bombed, about two miles from
Gardiz, the provincial capital, housed farmers and at times some of the
Kuchi people, who are nomads.</TE>
<TE>   A week after the bombing, neighbors were still picking through mounds
of rubble, searching for the dead. They said 10 houses were struck.</TE>
<TE>   Strewn about were what appeared to be the remains of simple lives.
Pink, yellow and blue dresses elaborately embroidered with flowers and
leaves, and shawls far more colorful than those worn elsewhere by women
in Afghanistan, lay on the ground. Half buried under some bricks was a
child's severed shoe. And vanishing into the desert dust was flour from a
large metal bin whose top was twisted off by the powerful bombs.</TE>
<TE>   On the night of the bombing, the village had more than its usual
number of people because Bahram Jan, a farmer, was having a wedding party
for his son. Members of the bride's family had come from as far away as
Jalalabad, several hours by road, said Sher Khan, an elderly man who
lives in a nearby village and lost seven relatives and a car the night of
the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   The roar of the planes started around 3 a.m., and then the bombs began
to fall, according to neighbors who watched from a distance, some of whom
climbed on their roofs to see what was happening by the light of the
nearly full moon. Accounts are not completely consistent, but several
people said the planes flew three sorties over the village and a
helicopter hovered close to the ground firing flares and then rockets.</TE>
<TE>   "I got on the roof and I thought to myself, 'They are destroying my
family,' " Khan said. "I saw the people running from the village in the
light of the flares and the moon."</TE>
<TE>   Villagers said a number of women and children ran from the houses
toward a dry pond and irrigation canals, probably in search of protection
from the rockets and bombs, but were killed as they ran. An initial
investigation by the United Nations said the charges were well founded.</TE>
<TE>   After two hours, the aircraft left and dozens of people lay dead. The
United Nations report, which was based on a source's information that
U.N. officials described as reliable but unconfirmed, said that 52 people
died: 17 men, 10 women and 25 children. Among them were six neighbors who
rushed to the village to rescue victims but were fired upon, the U.N.
said. Khan said 48 people were still missing but that they had buried 10
people. In one grave, he said, they put the remains of three bodies, and
in another a number of pieces that could not be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Near the destroyed homes, the ground is covered with unexploded
ammunition--much of it Russian- or Chinese-made varieties that the United
States does not use. Three buildings that were damaged were packed with
unopened boxes of bullets. Clearly this village was a major ammunition
dump, but for whom?</TE>
<TE>   The elders of the Paktia tribal council say the munitions were
government property that predated the Taliban. They say the munitions
were moved to the village because they feared they would explode and
cause civilian casualties if Gardiz was targeted in the U.S. air
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   But anti-Taliban soldiers who accompanied visitors to the village said
they had no doubt that the Taliban had put the munitions there.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear why the United States left the ammunition intact rather
than destroying it. Much of the ammunition still looks as if it could be
salvaged.</TE>
<TE>   As the shadows lengthen and the winter air turns chill, four women,
their blue and pink veils blown by the wind, walk steadily toward the
destroyed hamlet. They have come to look for relatives who are missing.
As they approach, a plane streaks high overhead. A few men picking
through the rubble look up nervously. The plane makes a second sweep in
the other direction. The men call out to the women that it is not safe
and that they should turn back.</TE>
<TE>   Will anyone ever return to this village?</TE>
<TE>   "No one is alive to come back," said Haji Taj Mohammed. "We have not
seen any wounded."</TE>

<DH>Although the Taliban is gone, Afghan women remain wary of the
future. A culture of subservience has them awaiting male direction.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Beneath the sky-blue burka obscuring her budding womanhood,
16-year-old Parwana Yusufi sorts through her hopes and worries.</LD>
<LD>   The veiled garment is hated by virtually every woman forced to wear
it. First, it is hazardous to movement, vision and breathing. Then there
is the dehumanizing effect for the women of recognizing one another only
by their worn-out shoes.</LD>
<LD>   But for those most damaged by five years of fanatic Taliban rule, the
burka remains a safe refuge from which to wait and see whether the
outside world is truly changing.</LD>
<TE>   "I'll take it off when everyone else does," Parwana says. "No one has
told us yet that it's permitted to go without it."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout Afghanistan, women are still waiting for word from
male-dominated authority about what they can wear, what they can do, even
what they can aspire to.</TE>
<TE>   How much better women will fare in newly pacified Afghanistan remains
an open question. There are two outspoken and self-assured women in the
new 30-member Cabinet, and interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai has voiced
his intention to see women accorded more rights. But Afghanistan has long
been a patriarchal society where women have the status of men's
belongings. Socially segregated even at weddings and funerals, they
remain unwelcome wherever men gather, be that at sports events, political
gatherings or the newly reopened cinemas.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Taliban took over Kabul, the capital, in 1996, women were
legally allowed to hold jobs, drive cars, own property, divorce and take
their husbands to court for physical abuse. But those rights existed only
on paper.</TE>
<TE>   A legacy of subservience has endured despite the 1979-89 Soviet
occupation, which many women now look back on with guilty nostalgia, for
while their country was subordinate to Moscow, they were encouraged to
work and see themselves as men's equals. Today, despite the Taliban's
departure, most women still don their despised burkas whenever they are
in public and automatically settle themselves in the trunks of cars to
leave the seats for the men.</TE>
<TE>   The young women now emerging from years of domestic isolation will
probably have brighter prospects only if their men want that.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like my daughters to become doctors. I believe we will once again
be a country where educated people are respected," says Ahmad Yusufi,
father of Parwana and a rare Afghan male in his insistence that having
seven daughters is a blessing, not a burden.</TE>
<TE>   Yusufi's wife, Qotsia Moshref, was wed at 15 by parental arrangement.
She had to leave school when she bore her first child 10 months later but
went back between each of her pregnancies. She was 35 when she finished
high school.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't let [Parwana] be married until she's finished her education,"
says Moshref. "There have already been families who have asked for her,
but we now have the right to say no."</TE>
<TE>For Some, Independence Is Only a Fantasy</TE>
<TE>   Across this city of shattered homes and cratered roads, the young
women of another family also yearn for knowledge but remain at home to do
their father's bidding. Valued less than livestock because of the drain
they place on family resources, the four unmarried daughters of bathhouse
owner Nashid, who goes by one name, fantasize about careers and
independence.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to be a pharmacist," 24-year-old Florence dreams aloud.
She managed to finish high school before the Taliban halted girls'
education, but now she is betrothed to a cousin she hasn't seen since
childhood and must go to his household whenever he deems it time to
marry.</TE>
<TE>   As the oldest of Nashid's daughters still left at home, Florence
spends her days in the family's squalid outdoor kitchen, plucking poultry
and stewing vegetables for her father's dinner. In no hurry to marry, she
bides her time embroidering borders on silk trousers. She spends her
modest earnings on sweets for herself and her favorite sister.</TE>
<TE>   "She takes care of me," Farial, 20, says with a laugh. "I hope she
never gets married, so we can live like this forever."</TE>
<TE>   But the sisters accept their fate with resignation.</TE>
<TE>   "We must do what our father wants. It's our custom," says Farial,
shrugging off her lack of a say in her future.</TE>
<TE>   Choice is a concept slow in coming to Afghan women. Though some now in
middle age caught a whiff of independence during the Soviet occupation,
the very notion of deciding one's destiny has been drummed out of female
consciousness by successively severe regimes and their narrow
interpretations of Islam.</TE>
<TE>   Muslim fundamentalists toppled the Soviet puppet regime in 1992. The
moujahedeen warriors who fought the Soviets imposed a harsh version of
Sharia, the Islamic code, in effect relegating women to being chattel
even before the Taliban issued formal edicts proscribing women's public
roles four years later.</TE>
<TE>   Sima Samar, the new deputy prime minister responsible for women's
affairs, says the women of Afghanistan are still too frightened to seize
the chance for change.</TE>
<TE>   "Women have lost five years of their lives. They are too traumatized
by what has happened to do anything yet," says Samar, who hopes she is
signaling to other women their right to liberation by carrying out her
public duties without a burka. In deference to Muslim tradition, she
wears only a sheer scarf loosely arrayed around her short gray hair.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how much I can accomplish in six months," she says,
referring to the term of the interim government. "But I have promised my
strong sisters to do my best. We need security first, then basic
education. I don't want to see women begging on the streets. We need to
help these victims become equal members of society again."</TE>
<TE>   Getting out from under the shroud-like veil is only a symbolic
challenge, says Samar. "The damage they suffered to their confidence and
self-esteem will not be overcome so easily."</TE>
<TE>   Johida, an unmarried 24-year-old supported by her younger brother,
evinces the confusion felt by many Afghan women.</TE>
<TE>   "When jobs are available, I will get one. I'd like to work in an
office where people are coming and going all day. It would be so exciting
after these long days at home," she says with enthusiasm that wanes as
she contemplates the unknown. "I don't know how to go about it, though.
And after so many years out of society, I don't know how to behave."</TE>
<TE>   Johida once earned a secret living with grueling piecework in
Afghanistan's carpet trade. For a month's labor knotting silk and wool
threads 10 hours a day, she made the equivalent of $13. Her eyes are
ruined and her hands are cracked and gnarled from the rough fibers, but
she insists she could still handle the reading and writing required of an
office worker.</TE>
<TE>   Women who once worked for government offices have an edge over the
rest. The newly inaugurated Cabinet has invited those fired by the
Taliban to reapply for their positions and has promised priority to those
who lost their state jobs for no other reason than their sex.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most impatient applicants are female teachers, most of whom
continued to tutor girls in clandestine home schools, enduring beatings
and destruction of their property when the Taliban found them.</TE>
<TE>Teacher Who Withstood Taliban Wants Action</TE>
<TE>   Malia Sahak, a rotund dynamo in charge of first-graders at the Naswan
Abulkhasim Ferdosi school, crowded 25 girls into her tiny home during
each of three shifts, teaching from memory after Taliban enforcers tore
up her textbooks.</TE>
<TE>   "I want my salary for the past five years," she says, adding that
President Bush ought to direct U.S. aid to female Afghan teachers who
reopened girls schools as soon as the Taliban retreated. "We didn't walk
away from our responsibilities to educate girls just because these
fanatic men were running the country."</TE>
<TE>   English teacher Nadima Malwan knows recovery will be neither swift nor
easy. Her husband agrees with the Taliban edict against women's
employment and has allowed her to resume teaching only because he has
lost his own job and they need the income.</TE>
<TE>   "Our men weren't so upset with the old system," she says. "If there
weren't foreign eyes on our new leaders, I doubt anything would change."</TE>
<TE>   Whether Western vigilance will endure is a deep concern of many Afghan
women. Those who are old enough remember the lawlessness after the Soviet
troop withdrawal in 1989. With no outside pressure for democracy,
civilians were left at the mercy of rival warlords who imposed ever more
brutal regimes on the population. In Kabul alone, 50,000 civilians died
amid the bloody infighting before the Taliban came to power.</TE>
<TE>   "That women can come back to work is cause for joy and a sign of
respect," says Karima Salek, head of the Society of Afghan Women, which
is trying to reconstitute its welfare activities after a five-year
hiatus. Offices in one damaged government building are packed with women
eager for employment with the day-care centers, orphanages and
job-training programs to be run by the ministry Samar is heading.</TE>
<TE>   Salek's society also offers legal counseling for women.</TE>
<TE>   "Women have many of the same rights as men, but it has never been our
custom to assert them," says Salek, noting by way of example that women
are entitled to own property but in practice hand over everything but
their clothing to their husbands upon marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a functioning legal system, men literally get away with
murder. When Nabila Ayubi married last month, she went through the
daylong wedding rituals with the countenance of the condemned.</TE>
<TE>   "She's missing her mother," explained Farial, a guest at the nuptials.
Three years ago, Ayubi's father stabbed his wife to death with a pair of
scissors because she couldn't quiet their screaming baby. He was neither
prosecuted nor jailed.</TE>
<TE>Men Can Use Child Custody Against Wives</TE>
<TE>   Child custody is another lever men can use to subjugate women.
Children legally belong to their fathers, who retain them after a
divorce. Children are also passed down the male line of a family in the
event of the father's death, meaning a widow cannot take her children
from her husband's extended family if she remarries.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the only work available for most Afghan women is that which
men won't do. Tending kitchen gardens, baking bread and midwifery are
about the only pursuits that allow Afghanistan's many widows to feed
their children.</TE>
<TE>   Gulbakht, who also goes by one name, doesn't know how old she is but
thinks she was 14 when she got married. After giving her four children in
five years, her husband died, leaving her with nothing except an instinct
for survival. For the past eight years, she has rented a crude fire pit
in a walled courtyard where she could bake leavened loaves of naan
brought to her surreptitiously by local housewives.</TE>
<TE>   For 500 afghanis--about 10 cents--she continues to bake loaves as the
women who brought them grumble and gossip. At the end of her 10-hour day,
she has baked 150 loaves and earned about $15, most of which must go
toward wood and other expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Does she expect new opportunity now that Afghanistan is free of war
and intrusions? Do the women wonder what fate awaits them now that the
world is watching? Do they see an easier life for their own daughters
than the injustice and indignity they've been forced to endure?</TE>
<TE>   Gulbakht grimaces at the frivolous questions and returns her attention
to the baking that is the only life she knows.</TE>

<HD>Bush Father-Son Parallels Begin, and End, on Economy</HD>
<DH>Politics: The president works to prove himself in a recession--and
erase an image created by his dad.</DH>
<SE>Last of three articles
</SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>As a candidate, George W. Bush often seemed driven by a single
political motive: to avoid the fate of his father, whose quest for a
second presidential term foundered on a recession barely big enough to
register on the statistical scales.</LD>
<LD>   So concerned was the younger Bush that he devoted much of his 2000
campaign to pushing for tax cuts as "insurance" against a downturn almost
no one at the time saw coming.</LD>
<LD>   Yet having won both the presidency and his tax cuts--and having been
proved right about the downturn--Bush has still not shaken the political
demons of economic trouble.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, many analysts think Bush faces a maddening task in the coming
year. Despite having acted so decisively in the face of the September
terrorist attacks that he erased his stubborn reputation as a foreign
policy lightweight, the president now must prove himself all over
again--in the economic realm. And he must do so largely by expunging an
image created not by him, but by his father--that Bushes don't fully
appreciate the pocketbook concerns of ordinary Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy is Bush's soft underside," said Bill McInturff, a partner
with the prominent Republican polling firm of Public Opinion Strategies
in Alexandria, Va. "His father lost because he had a kind of patrician,
'let them eat cake' attitude. He's sworn not to let the same thing happen
to him."</TE>
<TE>   The president starts with some advantages. He confronts the recession
in a congressional, rather than a presidential, election year, unlike the
elder Bush. He can plausibly blame the terrorist attacks and the anthrax
threat, and not poor administration policies, for throwing the economy
off. Perhaps most important, he faces a public that does not yet seem
deeply worried about the recession, which began in March.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not seeing the kind of heightened anxiety we saw in the last
two recessions," said Karlyn K. Bowman, a polling expert with the
business-oriented American Enterprise Institute in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   But if Bush begins with a leg up, he still faces some daunting
troubles. He suggested as much by devoting his first major appearances of
the new year--in speeches over the weekend in California and Oregon--to a
combative defense of his economic stewardship, rather than to a
self-satisfied review of his anti-terrorism successes.</TE>
<TE>   The dimensions of his economic dilemma are most apparent in the eerie
parallels with his father's situation of a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   Both men were militarily triumphant and enjoyed sky-high public
approval ratings. But the senior Bush suffered a three-pronged economic
curse that his successes elsewhere did little to help. He was saddled
with an economy that stubbornly refused to recover in ways, such as
creation of new jobs, that average Americans could appreciate. He
advanced an economic policy that set off ideological alarm bells: tax
hikes that infuriated Republican conservatives. And he was stuck with a
team of economic advisors that could seldom agree.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is still too early to say whether the current president
faces a similar fate, some analysts see troubling signs.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a real risk that even when growth resumes, it will be
extraordinarily modest, much as it was in the early 1990s," said David D.
Hale, chief global economist with Zurich Financial Services in Chicago.
"The administration's economic team has shown little interest in doing
much about it; they have not been able to carry the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of former President Bush never tire of noting that the
early 1990s recession was the mildest in the postwar period, a mere
three-quarter contraction amid two solid decades of growth. Their
message: Had it not been for the economic fear-mongering of Democrat Bill
Clinton, their man would have won in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   What the supporters tend to overlook is that when measured in ways
that most matter to average Americans the recession was anything but
mild. It took the jobless rate a full 15 months after the start of
recovery to begin steadily declining. It took it almost three years to
return to pre-recession levels. And it knocked critical California into a
tailspin from which it took years to recover.</TE>
<TE>   The early '90s experience has to weigh heavily on the current
president because there's good reason to believe the economy could
perform similarly this time around.</TE>
<TE>   "The recovery is going to be slow and sluggish, not rapid and robust.
And so is job growth," said Donald H. Straszheim, president of Straszheim
Global Advisors in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Even if growth snaps back quickly, analysts said, it is unlikely to
result in companies adding lots of new workers or hiring back those they
have laid off. That's because of the unusual, inverted nature of this
recession.</TE>
<TE>   Most downturns in the post-war period began when consumers got carried
away with themselves and pushed demand beyond supply, setting off
inflation and forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates and
slow consumption.</TE>
<TE>   But this time, analysts said it was businesses that got carried away
by investing too much in new plants and equipment, pushing supply beyond
demand, driving down prices and forcing the Fed to slash rates.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got 180 degrees the opposite of what we usually have," said
James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer with Wells Capital Management
in Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   This unusual state of affairs cannot last, according to Paulsen and
others. Companies are already coping with over-investment through layoffs
and plant closings, and they are likely to continue doing so.</TE>
<TE>   That's certainly what happened in the only post-war recession similar
to the current one, the 1990-91 downturn, with dire political
consequences for the president.</TE>
<TE>   Bush senior is widely regarded as having committed one of the great
blunders of American politics--embracing a "no new taxes" policy critical
to the Republican right, only to renege on it, setting off howls of
betrayal. His son has gone to extraordinary lengths to avoid committing
the same error.</TE>
<TE>   But some analysts question whether, in his effort to distinguish
himself from his father, the president has set off similarly powerful
political alarms among Democrats. They wonder whether the resulting
partisan clashes make it unlikely the two parties could agree on an
effective economic stimulus package.</TE>
<TE>   They worry that by hewing to the right on economic policy, Bush risks
being seen by much of the public as not acting when the economy needs
it--the very perception that destroyed his father's chances for
reelection.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush is not thought of as a real powerhouse on the economy," said
polling expert Bowman.</TE>
<TE>   That, Bowman said, is because one of the president's biggest
accomplishments--the 10-year, $1.35-trillion tax cut--although "very
important to his [Republican] base, . . . wasn't anything most Americans
thought they were going to see, so it wasn't anything they focused a lot
of attention on."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the political fallout is already apparent.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy and jobs issues are up for grabs," said GOP pollster
McInturff. "We have to do something about the economy and be perceived as
doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Although the president has certainly revived the economic issue in
recent days, he so far has offered no new policy proposals and shown
little appetite for compromise.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, he seemed to go out of his way to echo the "no new taxes"
pledge that got his father in such trouble, telling an Ontario, Calif.,
audience that Democrats could reverse portions of last year's tax cut
package only "over my dead body."</TE>
<TE>   In a city where all politics is personal, no one caught more flak for
the elder Bush's 1992 defeat than his budget director, Richard G. Darman.
Darman's internecine war with other top economic advisors was widely
blamed for crippling administration efforts to fix the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Although there is no similar spat underway now, a wide array of
observers express deep disappointment with the current president's
economic team.</TE>
<TE>   "They're a very big puzzle," said William A. Niskanen, chairman of
business-backed Cato Institute in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   At key points last fall, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill appeared
to contradict chief economic advisor Lawrence B. Lindsey and R. Glenn
Hubbard, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, on
administration support for corporate tax cuts. But analysts said the real
problem was O'Neill's penchant for off-the-cuff remarks.</TE>
<TE>   The group's rising star may be budget director Mitchell E. Daniels
Jr., who will be on prominent display in the next month as the
administration unveils its budget blueprint for the coming fiscal year.
But he comes with his own baggage; he has proved to be so politically
abrasive even powerful Republicans such as House Appropriations Committee
Chairman C.W. "Bill" Young of Florida have refused to return his phone
calls.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, it appears that Bush himself will have to take on the task
of selling his economic program.</TE>

<HD>Crash Reveals Small Planes as Giant Security Headache</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Pilots such as the teen who hit a Tampa high-rise would
be hard to stop, experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The case of an apparently suicidal teenager who crashed a plane
into a Tampa, Fla., high-rise presents federal officials with a dilemma:
how to bolster the security of private aviation without suffocating its
long tradition of free flight.</LD>
<LD>   A post-Sept. 11 security system is already in the works for airlines.
But providing protections for more than 200,000 planes, 18,000 airports
and 500,000 pilots in private aviation is a tricky balancing act.</LD>
<LD>   "How do you have some security without crushing that free spirit?"
asked Gerald Dillingham, director of aviation issues for the General
Accounting Office. "Right now there is very little checking of private
pilots or their passengers. Maybe the beginning of an answer is that we
need to recognize we have a security gap."</LD>
<TE>   Small planes do not pack the sheer destructive power of jetliners.
They may weigh as little as a small auto and carry less than 60 gallons
of fuel.</TE>
<TE>   But little planes often putter about the skies with much less scrutiny
than large jets. Although commercial aircraft fly assigned routes
specified and monitored by air traffic controllers, pilots of small
planes often rely instead on their eyes and instruments to navigate.</TE>
<TE>   The Tampa crash--in which a 15-year-old flew a plane into a 42-story
building--raises questions about whether such an incident could happen
again with deadlier repercussions.</TE>
<TE>   To dismiss Charles Bishop, who left a note expressing sympathy with
Osama bin Laden, would be risky, private security experts said. If a
troubled teen could get hold of a small plane, so can a terrorist.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't just brush this thing off as some kid who went down," said
Charles Slepian, a New York lawyer who runs a think tank on
transportation safety. "That's what it may be, but it should serve as a
wake-up call. If you pack that Cessna with C-4 explosives and a
detonator, it is a delivery system."</TE>
<TE>   Billie H. Vincent, a former Federal Aviation Administration security
chief, said the government should conduct a thorough risk analysis of
potential threats posed by private planes. He believes that jets and
flight schools are the segments of the private aviation community where
additional security measures would bring the greatest benefit.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at what you can do about this, corporate jets and
flying schools are the things you need to look at," Vincent said.</TE>
<TE>   The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Assn., the largest group representing
private pilots, said the Bishop case is an example not of vulnerability
to terrorism, but of another national problem: troubled teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think this incident in Tampa was a security breach," said
Warren Morningstar, a spokesman for the organization. "This really was a
breach of trust, an unfortunate incident involving a young man who
apparently had some trouble, and folks didn't recognize he was in
trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't see this as an issue so much of security as of what is going
on with our young folks," Morningstar added.</TE>
<TE>   But the FBI was taking no chances. It seized two computers linked to
Bishop and is examining them to see if he accessed any Web sites
supporting Bin Laden, militant Islamic extremism or terrorism, FBI
Special Agent Sara Oates said in Tampa.</TE>
<TE>   In a report to Congress last month, the Transportation Department
acknowledged that light planes "could be used to strike ground-based
targets."</TE>
<TE>   "Their load-carrying ability, even if limited, enables the delivery of
explosives, compensating for their relative lack of kinetic energy
[speed] or fuel," the report says. "Given the ubiquity of general
aviation aircraft and airports, such aircraft are never far from major
urban centers, critical infrastructure and other targets."</TE>
<TE>   Bishop's fatal flight illustrates how vulnerable critical targets can
be. Authorities said they were relieved the teenager didn't aim for the
military's nearby U.S. Central Command, which directs the troops in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The government has warned private pilots that they could be shot down
by fighter jets if they seem to pose a threat. The Transportation
Department is also considering new security training for the general
aviation community, requirements for tighter airfield security, pilot
licenses less susceptible to forgery, and a system that would allow
airport operators to access government "watch lists" of potential
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said she knew of no additional security
measures being contemplated after the Tampa crash.</TE>
<TE>   The politically powerful pilots' association, meanwhile, is lobbying
to stave off a crackdown while recognizing the need for some improvements
in security.</TE>
<TE>   The association supports a proposal for more secure pilot licenses in
place of the current paper ones. It also calls for a profiling system to
help identify people who should not be allowed to buy or rent aircraft,
and for increased security awareness on the part of pilots and airport
operators.</TE>
<TE>   Morningstar said an analysis of federal statistics by the pilots'
association found 19 fatal crashes of small planes since 1982 that were
apparently caused by suicidal pilots. In 1994, a small plane hit a tall
tree outside the White House residential quarters. The pilot was killed,
and his intentions remain unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, general aviation has slowly returned to near-normal.
Kimberly Bradshaw, a master flight instructor at San Diego's Montgomery
Field, said the terrorist attacks have only "slightly" increased her
security concerns. Bradshaw said she is more cautious about who she will
take on an introductory flight.</TE>
<TE>   "I ask them about what their aviation goals are and how long they've
thought about becoming a pilot," Bradshaw said. "I don't want to get into
an airplane with someone who will pull a gun on me and say, 'Let's crash
into a building.' "</TE>
<TE>   Bradshaw said flight instructors already play a substantial, if
informal, role in screening who gets to be a pilot. For example, she said
she declined to teach a woman who wanted to fly so she could impress a
pilot boyfriend with whom she had a troubled relationship. The woman was
later arrested for going after her boyfriend with a gun.</TE>
<TE>   "We are the ones training pilots, and the FAA is going to hold us
responsible," Bradshaw said. "We are already nervous about flying with
people."</TE>
<TE>   Bradshaw would not second-guess the Florida instructor's decision to
allow Bishop to perform a preflight check by himself. "The problem is,
the student is going to solo someday," Bradshaw said. "Someone who is
dead-set on committing suicide by flying into a building is going to do
it anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Vincent, the former FAA security chief, wonders if the federal
government can effectively reach down to the hundreds of grass airstrips
with no control tower.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't have a system that is 100% free of risk when you have
200,000 airplanes and the freedom of flight that you have in this
country," he said. "General aviation is the heart of U.S. aviation, when
you get right down to it."</TE>

<HD>India, Pakistan Still Poised to Fight</HD>
<DH>South Asia: Musharraf says both sides have yet to step back from
the brink of war. Visiting Blair works to defuse tensions over Kashmir.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>President Pervez Musharraf said Monday that India and Pakistan had
not yet stepped back from the brink of war in Kashmir but that recent
events made it more likely that the two nuclear-armed nations could begin
reducing border tensions.</LD>
<LD>   At a weekend Asian summit in Nepal, Musharraf shook hands and
exchanged a few words with Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair also is visiting India and Pakistan to
try to defuse tensions, and he said Monday that "there is a way through
this" if the two sides start talking.</LD>
<LD>   Although Musharraf's comments, at a news conference with Blair, did
not suggest a breakthrough was near in Kashmir--where thousands of troops
are facing one another and at least 10 people died Sunday and Monday in
cross-border shelling--Western envoys noted that the Pakistani president
avoided bellicose language and reiterated that he would continue cracking
down on terrorists.</LD>
<TE>   Blair lauded Musharraf's role as a key member of the U.S.-led
coalition against terrorism. However, he equated two attacks on India by
Kashmiri militants with the terrorist attacks against the United States
on Sept. 11. Terrorism is terrorism, he said, regardless of where it
occurs or who its victims are.</TE>
<TE>   "We've welcomed some of the actions that have been taken by Pakistan
over the past few days," Blair said in New Delhi on Sunday, "but there is
no doubt what needs to happen [in Pakistan]. There must be a complete
rejection of the types of terrorist actions carried out on Oct. 1 and
Dec. 13."</TE>
<TE>   Five guerrillas launched a suicide attack on India's Parliament in New
Delhi on Dec. 13. Fourteen people, including the attackers, died. India
responded by building up its forces in Jammu and Kashmir, its only
Muslim-dominated state, and issuing a list of demands it expected
Pakistan to meet if the crisis was to be resolved.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 1, militants had assaulted the state legislature in Jammu and
Kashmir, killing dozens of people.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf, Western diplomats said, has gone a long way toward meeting
India's demands but has stopped short of denouncing anti-Indian Kashmiri
groups, which Pakistan has long supported.</TE>
<TE>   He has arrested the leaders of two groups India says were responsible
for the attack on Parliament, as well as about 300 of their supporters.
He has closed their offices, frozen their financial assets and, he said
Monday, will "analyze" the list of 20 Kashmiri militants India accuses of
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Both India and Pakistan have said they do not want war, and both have
said they will not use nuclear weapons. But the attack on its Parliament
outraged India, and it apparently views the United States' focus on the
region and terrorism as an opportunity to end such attacks emanating from
Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   What appears to be blocking attempts to find a diplomatic solution is
the issue of whether the militants in Kashmir are freedom fighters or
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "What is happening in Kashmir is a freedom struggle," said retired
Pakistani Gen. Syed Refaqat. "Virtually every Pakistani believes that.
Unfortunately, given our shared history, relations with India are never
going to be very stable, and that makes this crisis a diplomatic test for
everyone."</TE>
<TE>   President Bush said Monday that it was "very important" for Musharraf
to make a clear statement that he will crack down on terrorism. If he
does, Bush told reporters at the White House, "it'll provide relief . . .
on a situation that's still serious."</TE>
<TE>   Bush said the United States is trying to persuade India and Pakistan
that there are alternatives to war.</TE>
<TE>   He spoke to the leaders of both countries by telephone Dec. 29. In his
conversation with Musharraf, Bush urged him to accelerate efforts to
crack down on Pakistani political extremists.</TE>
<TE>   "This war scenario is not something Pakistan wants or needs," said
Ayesha Haroon, an editor of the Nation, an independent national newspaper
in Pakistan. "But frankly, I don't think there is a chance there will be
war. With Blair here, with talk of a U.S. envoy coming, there's great
international pressure, and that will be helpful in avoiding war."</TE>
<TE>   Although Musharraf denounced "terrorism in all its forms" Monday, he
may have to move cautiously on Kashmir. He alienated religious parties by
ending Pakistan's support for the Taliban in Afghanistan and by cracking
down on Islamic extremists, and he stands to anger his military if he
significantly changes policy on Kashmir.</TE>

<HD>Ship Captain Points at Arafat's Regime</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Chief of seized vessel with arms cache says he got orders
from man Israelis accuse of being Palestinian Authority's top smuggler.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>The captain of a ship carrying 50 tons of weapons that Israel says
were intended for the Palestinian Authority said Monday that he was a
longtime member of Yasser Arafat's Fatah organization obeying orders to
smuggle the arms.</LD>
<LD>   Omar Akkawi said he received his orders from a Palestinian official he
identified as Adel Awadallah, a man Israel says is in charge of
"smuggling operations" and weapons procurement for the Palestinian
Authority. "I'm a soldier. I obeyed orders," Akkawi said in a jail
interview with two Israeli television stations and Fox News.</LD>
<LD>   The Palestinian Authority has denied any knowledge of the arms
shipment and has accused Israel of using the capture of the ship on
Thursday to score public relations points.</LD>
<TE>   In a meeting with the European Union's foreign policy chief, Javier
Solana, Arafat said he has established a committee to investigate the
incident. In a statement, Arafat spokesman Nabil abu Rudaineh said the
Palestinian Authority president told Solana on Monday night that any
Palestinian involved with the shipment would be punished.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli commandos captured Akkawi's cargo ship and its 13-member crew
in the Red Sea. The ship was loaded with Katyusha rockets, mortars,
antitank missiles, 2 1/2 tons of C-4 explosives and other weapons worth
tens of millions of dollars, according to the Israeli army. The
Palestinian Authority is banned from possessing such weapons under peace
agreements it signed with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Akkawi confirmed that the ship was loaded off the coast of Iran and
that a member of the radical Shiite Muslim Lebanese group Hezbollah
helped load the weapons. Israel has said it regards Iran and Hezbollah's
effort to arm the Palestinians as a dangerous development.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, Israeli leaders said the capture of the weapons would
require a drastic shift in Israel's policy toward the Palestinian
Authority. But by Monday, it seemed that no immediate change was in the
offing.</TE>
<TE>   In an appearance before a committee of the Knesset, Israel's
parliament, Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said he did not
recommend that Israel declare Arafat an enemy, a term Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon applied to him at a news conference Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   But Ben-Eliezer also said that there is now "real quiet" in
Palestinian-controlled territories and that Israel will ease some
restrictions on Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip if the lull
in violence continues.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials seemed more concerned Monday with their own
performance in the affair, and with international coverage of it, than
with what it meant to Israel's future relations with Arafat. Officials
denounced the international media for failing to give the story the
attention Israel said it deserved.</TE>
<TE>   Brig. Gen. Ron Kitrey, the Israeli army spokesman, complained on
Israel Radio that few foreign reporters based in Israel attended a Sunday
news conference in the southern port city of Eilat where the army
displayed the captured ship and its cargo.</TE>
<TE>   Ministries blamed one another for failing to capitalize on what all
agreed should have been a public relations coup. Israeli Foreign Ministry
officials accused the army of mishandling the news conference and failing
to disclose more information about the ship sooner. The army, in
interviews on Israel Radio and in briefings of Israeli military
correspondents, hotly defended its performance.</TE>
<TE>   The uproar over the ship's capture overshadowed the latest effort of
U.S. peace envoy Anthony C. Zinni to secure a cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   But before ending a four-day visit to the region Monday, Zinni said he
felt progress had been made, and he told Israeli and Palestinian security
officials to keep meeting until his return Jan. 18. He asked the
Palestinians to step up arrests of militants and asked Israel to expedite
its lifting of restrictions on the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington on Monday, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher
said the Bush administration still does not know who hired the ship and
who was supposed to take delivery of the weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Akkawi, the ship's captain, told interviewers that he had intended to
offload the weapons onto three smaller boats at the Egyptian port of
Alexandria after passing through the Suez Canal. The boats, Akkawi said,
would then dump the weapons in special waterproof containers off the
coast of Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   Akkawi said he has been a Fatah member since 1976, is a former officer
in the Palestinian navy and currently works in the Palestinian Ministry
of Transportation. He said he understood that the operation was likely to
fail but agreed to do it because "it's the Palestinian right to defend
ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Akkawi said he did not know whether senior Palestinian Authority
officials were aware of the shipment. He said he dealt only with
Awadallah.</TE>
<TE>   But a senior army officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity Monday
night, said Israel is certain that Arafat knew of the smuggling attempt
"from top to bottom."</TE>
<TE>   Since fighting erupted between Israel and the Palestinians in
September 2000, the officer said, the Palestinian Authority has been
trying to obtain weapons that can reach Israeli cities and cause heavy
casualties.</TE>

<HD>Hitler's Physicist Told Mentor of A-Bomb Work</HD>
<DH>History: In secret documents cited in London newspaper, Heisenberg
expresses no moral qualms to Bohr.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>Werner Heisenberg, the scientist behind Adolf Hitler's secret
atomic bomb program, revealed its existence in 1941 to Niels Bohr, the
Danish scientist who later became part of the United States' Manhattan
Project, according to secret documents cited in a London newspaper.</LD>
<LD>   In a meeting with Bohr in Nazi-occupied Denmark, Heisenberg expressed
no moral reservations about building a bomb for Hitler, the documents
indicate. Neither did Heisenberg hint that he might be willing to
sabotage the project, the documents show.</LD>
<LD>   The information contradicts several historical accounts of the meeting
and an award-winning West End and Broadway play, "Copenhagen," in which
British playwright Michael Frayn speculated on the meeting's significance
in light of the eventual failure of the Nazi atomic project.</LD>
<TE>   During the meeting, Heisenberg alerted Bohr, his former mentor, to the
existence of Hitler's "uranium club," according to the documents.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, Bohr went to the U.S. to join the Manhattan Project,
which built the atomic bombs that were dropped on Japan in 1945.</TE>
<TE>   The new documents, including a letter Bohr wrote but never sent, were
reported in the Sunday Times, which quoted Dr. Finn Aaserud, director of
the Niels Bohr Archive in Copenhagen.</TE>
<TE>   "Essentially, the letter shows that Heisenberg told Bohr it was
possible that the war would be won with atomic weapons, indicating that
he was involved in such work," Aaserud told Associated Press in
Copenhagen on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Aaserud said that next month, the archives, which are part of the
Niels Bohr Institute, will release 11 documents written or dictated by
Bohr before his death in 1962, including his unsent letter to Heisenberg,
completed in 1958.</TE>
<TE>   Bohr and Heisenberg are considered among the greatest physicists. Bohr
was awarded the 1922 Nobel Prize in physics for nuclear research.
Heisenberg won the Nobel in 1932 for the creation of quantum mechanics.</TE>

to his Dec. 27 election, named a 20-member Cabinet and retained the post
of defense minster for himself.</LD>
<LD>   Emmanuel Kasonde was named finance minister, and Katele Kalumba was
appointed foreign minister. Mwanawasa warned that he would not tolerate
graft, which was rampant under his predecessor and mentor, Frederick
Chiluba.</LD>
<LD>   "Ministers will have no room for corruption or advancement of personal
interest. Any betrayal of these ideals will lead to us parting company,"
he told parliament.</LD>

<LD>President Fidel Castro held talks with six U.S. congressmen,
discussing the U.S. embargo and international events, participants said.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the congressmen later met with about a dozen of the island's
leading dissidents, who say they are seeking peaceful changes to Castro's
one-party system.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. William D. Delahunt (D-Mass.) said Castro, who also entertained
two senators last week, was conciliatory. "The tone reflected a new
attitude . . . one of less confrontation and effort to explore ways of
collaboration to put the Cold War behind us," he said.</LD>

<HD>Peacekeepers Greeted by Mixed Feelings</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Military men watch warily as foreigners arrive, but
residents of Kabul express joy at the prospect of stability.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>British soldiers were trying to start their mine-clearing machine.
French forces were setting up a hospital--and politely declining shots of
vodka offered by Russian peacekeepers to celebrate Eastern Orthodox
Christmas.</LD>
<LD>   Off to the side at the bomb-cratered Kabul International Airport on
Monday, Afghan fighter Abdul Sahmin watched silently. He and other former
Northern Alliance soldiers had been here more than a month already, a
month in which peace reigned not just at the airport but throughout the
capital. He wasn't certain they needed help.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm an ordinary soldier, and it's not my decision whether they come
or not," said Sahmin, 28. "If they have come for peace and for
peacekeeping, fine. If they have come to take Afghanistan, they should be
ready for a fight."</LD>
<TE>   Three days after Afghan interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai approved
an agreement authorizing 4,500 international peacekeepers to help
stabilize Kabul, the forces were streaming in, under the watchful eye of
a people who have never welcomed foreign soldiers for long.</TE>
<TE>'We're Very Happy'</TE>
<TE>   While Afghan military men--many of whom have long provided security to
the highest bidder--and some government officials are clearly wary of the
International Security Assistance Force, residents of the war-ravaged
city seem at times ecstatic over the arrival of the peacekeepers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very happy, very happy," said Khwaja Mohammed, 55, as he sat
cross-legged on the floor of his brother's shotgun shop--hunting guns
only--at the main bazaar here. "The Afghan soldiers could not control
Kabul."</TE>
<TE>   Advance elements from several nations arrived here even as
negotiations over the precise makeup and mission of the peacekeeping
force was being hammered out in Germany last month. But troops have
poured in over the last few days, with more than 1,500 on the ground now.</TE>
<TE>   British troops have begun patrolling the city, setting out from the
peacekeepers' headquarters, near the U.S. Embassy in the center of the
city, in armored trucks and jeeps. The soldiers have been heavily armed
but helmetless, as is the tradition for many peacekeepers, who believe
wearing a beret makes them more approachable.</TE>
<TE>   The patrols thus far appear to be limited to small convoys, with the
soldiers cruising the city but not walking the streets. More visible
outings are expected to begin when more of the international force is in
place.</TE>
<TE>   Under the six-month, renewable agreement, which was signed by Maj.
Gen. John McColl of Britain and Afghan Interior Minister Younis Qanooni,
the British will lead the contingent for the first three months. The
British force, slated to grow to 1,500, is by far the largest among the
16 countries that have pledged peacekeepers.</TE>
<TE>   About 200 French soldiers have arrived within the last few days, and
300 more are on their way. They are erecting a mobile surgical hospital
and securing the Kabul airport, which has an estimated 18,000 mines
spread around the airfield and bomb craters as large as 15 feet deep and
25 feet wide, some from U.S. attacks. Even so, French commanders said
Monday that they expect to have the airport fully operational sometime
next week, though de-mining and other work will continue.</TE>
<TE>   German, Danish, Turkish and other forces have begun arriving as well,
to provide everything from surgical teams to well diggers. The U.S.,
having decided not to prosecute a war and act as peacekeeper at the same
time, is not part of the force but has promised to provide
communications, logistical help and air support for the other nations.</TE>
<TE>   Terms of the peacekeeping agreement provide for a potentially awkward
situation: British troops patrolling Afghanistan's capital city while
Afghan troops look on.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the decision of the elders," said an Afghan soldier named
Abdullah. But he added: "At this time, I think it's a good thing. When
one [nation] has a problem, others should come and help it. This is their
responsibility. They're not doing any favors for us."</TE>
<TE>   Some people here and abroad are questioning the confinement of the
peacekeeping deployment to Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   A relative calm appeared to settle over the country immediately after
the Taliban was swept from power, but about the only tranquil place left
a month and a half later is Kabul.</TE>
<TE>Bandits Are a Problem</TE>
<TE>   Banditry is rampant in many parts of Afghanistan; the southern city of
Kandahar, spiritual center of the Taliban, has become so dangerous in
recent weeks that the United Nations has sometimes ordered its employees
not to go to work; in the east, the U.S. continues to bomb suspected
terrorist encampments; and near the western city of Herat, Afghan
authorities have reported inter-tribal skirmishes.</TE>
<TE>   Some wonder if the peacekeepers might be more useful elsewhere, while
others argue that true stability in the capital and government will
eventually spread to the rest of the country.</TE>
<TE>   "Kabul is OK," said Jawaid Mohammed, a hat salesman.</TE>
<TE>   "You can see this used to be a thriving capital," said U.S. Army Col.
Wayland E. Parker, the U.S. chief liaison to the international force.
"This city needs peacekeepers."</TE>
<TE>   To many people here, such debate is wholly academic.</TE>
<TE>   When some of the French and British convoys rolled into town, people
lined the streets to wave and cheer. "It was like WWII, when the
Americans came to Paris," said Col. Jean-Marc Marill, the commander of
the French contingent.</TE>
<TE>   Abdul Zaheer hasn't seen any of the peacekeepers yet, but he knows
they are here now, and he hopes their title proves accurate.</TE>
<TE>   "All we want now is peace," the 22-year-old said. "Maybe they'll bring
it."</TE>

<LD>Suspected Al Qaeda terrorists armed with bomb-making instructions
planned to attack the U.S. Embassy and American businesses in Singapore,
the island's government said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The 15 suspects--some of them members of Singapore's military--were
detained last month after authorities found bomb information along with
photographs and videotapes of targeted buildings in the suspects' homes
and offices.</LD>
<LD>   "The U.S. Embassy and U.S. commercial entities were the principal
targets," said Ong Chew Peck Wan, a spokeswoman for the Home Affairs
Ministry.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators also found materials linked to Al Qaeda, along with
falsified passports and forged immigration stamps, according to the Home
Affairs Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher praised
Singapore's efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "We applaud this specific action. We think it reflects their
determination to fight against international terrorism," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The suspects also have ties to militant groups in Malaysia and
Indonesia, the ministry said in a statement. Malaysian police have
arrested 13 people since Dec. 9 on suspicion of being members of an
extremist group with possible links to three men accused of involvement
in the Sept. 11 attacks in the U.S.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush named former Secret Service director John Magaw as
head of the new Transportation Security Administration on Monday,
bypassing the usual confirmation process by making the appointment while
the Senate is in recess.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's action means that Magaw can serve without confirmation for
about a year, until the end of the Senate's next session.</LD>
<LD>   The agency Magaw will head is an arm of the Transportation Department
and was created in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. It
will be responsible for developing and deploying new airport security
measures.</LD>
<TE>   The agency is to take charge of all airline security matters by Feb.
19. Magaw will oversee the hiring of 28,000 airport security screeners
and the installation of new systems to detect explosives in checked
baggage.</TE>
<TE>   Bush announced Magaw's nomination as undersecretary of Transportation
for security Dec. 10. It was stalled amid procedural maneuvering on
unrelated issues at the end of the last congressional session.</TE>
<TE>   Magaw, 66, who also headed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, has worked for the last two years as an anti-terrorism advisor
to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</TE>
<TE>   The Constitution grants the president power to make temporary
appointments to fill important government jobs without the Senate's
consent while the chamber is in recess. Such postings expire at the end
of the next congressional session--in Magaw's case, that probably means
by the end of this year.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, senators upset about a particular nomination will
protest the use of recess appointments as an abuse of presidential power.</TE>
<TE>   But this year, there was little reported controversy about the Magaw
nomination, and it was not entirely clear why the Senate failed to act on
it before adjourning Dec. 20 for a winter break. Congress is due to
reconvene Jan. 23.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) had no
immediate comment on the White House announcement.</TE>

<HD>Bush Signals Possibility of Deficit in New Budget</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Monday broached the prospect of a red-ink budget,
saying the cost of the war in Afghanistan, homeland defense and the
recession means the new spending plan he is preparing may show a deficit.</LD>
<LD>   Presidential aides had signaled in recent weeks that a balanced
federal budget was slipping away. But Bush himself had not publicly
acknowledged that likelihood for the budget he soon will send to Congress
for the 2003 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.</LD>
<LD>   "We had a national emergency, we're trying to win a war, and we're in
a recession," Bush said when asked about the budget. "Those will be the
priorities of my budget . . . recognizing that we may not balance the
budget for this year."</LD>
<TE>   White House budget director Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. warned late last
year that a balanced budget may not return until the 2005 fiscal year.
The economic boom of the 1990s had reversed years of deficit spending and
produced budget surpluses in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   The president made his comments before meeting with key economic aides
and Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Bush convened
the meeting within two hours of returning to Washington from a vacation
at his Texas ranch, reflecting efforts to spotlight his increasing focus
on solving the nation's economic problems.</TE>
<TE>   In other comments Monday, Bush signaled a renewed determination to
press Congress for an economic stimulus package. He said his budget
proposal would include measures intended to help pull the economy out of
recession--measures thwarted by Senate Democratic leaders last month.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush plan calls for a mix of large tax breaks for business, an
accelerated cut in income tax rates and expanded benefits for the
unemployed. The specifics include reducing the 27% income tax rate to 25%
in 2002, four years ahead of schedule. The plan also would provide 13
additional weeks of unemployment benefits for people who have lost their
jobs since March and a new tax credit to help the unemployed pay for
health insurance.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate Democrats charged that the package was too skewed toward
business and failed to adequately address health care needs for the
unemployed.</TE>
<TE>   According to Associated Press, congressional aides say that Bush's new
budget--which he will unveil on Feb. 4--is expected to propose about $730
billion for domestic and defense programs, excluding automatically paid
benefits such as Social Security. That is $24 billion, or 3.4%, more than
this year's levels.</TE>
<TE>   The government reported a $237-billion surplus in fiscal 2000. Last
spring, shortly after Bush took office, analysts projected that a decade
of surpluses would total $5.6 trillion. But the surpluses began to fade
with the passage in May of Bush's 10-year, $1.35-trillion tax cut.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats increasingly have blamed the vanishing budget surpluses on
the tax cut bill; on Friday, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.)
claimed it led to "the most dramatic fiscal deterioration in our nation's
history." But Daschle and other leading Democrats so far have stopped
short of proposing a rollback of any of the bill's tax cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Amy Coll, a spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget,
declined to say Monday how much the budget deficit was likely to be in
2003, because the administration's proposal was in flux.</TE>
<TE>   A recent analysis by the Democratic staff of the House Budget
Committee predicted that the deficit for fiscal 2002, which ends Sept.
30, would be about $3 billion and would jump to at least $43 billion in
fiscal 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Most Republican analysts on the Senate Budget Committee project a
budget closer to balance in these years. But they acknowledge that the
budget is sure to go in the red.</TE>

<HD>High Court Gives Lake Tahoe Landowners a Sympathetic Ear</HD>
<DH>Law: Divided justices debate whether a building ban merits
compensation for hundreds of families.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court justices, hearing arguments Monday in a Lake
Tahoe property rights case, appeared sympathetic to the hundreds of
families who have been barred from building homes on their lots, but also
wary of forcing local governments to pay compensation whenever they delay
new development.</LD>
<LD>   During a lively hourlong argument, the justices seemed sharply divided
on the Tahoe case, which pits the interests of land-use planners against
those of property owners.</LD>
<LD>   Ten years ago, the high court sided with a South Carolina man who was
told that he could not build anything on his beachfront lots. The court
ruled that property owners who are denied all use of their land must be
paid for their loss. The Tahoe case raises the question of whether this
rule of "mandatory compensation" should be extended to instances where
the government temporarily freezes development.</LD>
<TE>   In 1981, the Tahoe regional planning agency put a moratorium on new
housing around the lake because runoff from the hillsides threatened to
turn the clear blues of the lake into algae green.</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, about 700 families sued because their lots were
deemed susceptible to erosion and they were barred from building.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia spoke up
for the property owners during Monday's arguments.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't seem fair to me to say these people should bear the
burden" of preserving the lake, Scalia said. "It's a general societal
problem for which the entire society should pay. . . . Why should some
individuals have to make the sacrifice?"</TE>
<TE>   When a lawyer for the regional planning agency defended the "temporary
moratorium," the chief justice interjected sarcastically, "Maybe it
should all be a park."</TE>
<TE>   Rehnquist and Scalia are the court's strongest champions of property
rights, but they were not alone in taking up the plight of the lot
owners.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Stephen G. Breyer, a native of San Francisco, also noted the
potential unfairness of the moratorium.</TE>
<TE>   "The justification here is excellent--saving Lake Tahoe," he said. But
the method of accomplishing that end is questionable, he added. "We're
saying, 'You won't be able to build on your land.' Aren't they supposed
to have some remedy at law?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   The proper remedy, said the lawyer for the planning agency, is for the
individual property owners to bring separate lawsuits claiming that they
were victims of unreasonable treatment by the government.</TE>
<TE>   But that is a cumbersome, costly and unrealistic solution, said Santa
Monica attorney Michael M. Berger, representing the Tahoe lot owners. He
argued instead for an automatic rule.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's a total prohibition on using your land, it's a taking,"
Berger said. In such instances, the property owner deserves compensation,
even if it is a temporary prohibition, he said.</TE>
<TE>   To make his point, he cited the example of a car. "If I take your car
and park it in a garage for a year, you've lost the use of it," he told
the justices. The owner would expect to be compensated for the loss, even
if the car were returned later, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, among others, worried about forcing
local agencies to pay compensation whenever they deny building permits,
even temporarily.</TE>
<TE>   "What about your basic zoning laws?" she asked. "Is that an immediate
taking?"</TE>
<TE>   Not necessarily, Berger replied, if it involves an ordinary process of
obtaining a building permit.</TE>
<TE>   Washington attorney John G. Roberts, who defended the regional
planning board, argued that a moratorium does not strip owners of their
property. "Because the regulation is temporary, the land retains value,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   To this, Justice O'Connor said that the supposedly temporary
moratorium has been in effect for two decades. "It's been 22 years for
some of them. And there's no end in sight," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "You are talking about a government agency that is making sure this
land lies fallow," Scalia said.</TE>
<TE>   Later this week, the justices will vote on the case of Tahoe Sierra
Preservation Council vs. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 00-1167. It will
be several months before a decision is announced.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in other actions, the court:</TE>
<TE>   * Refused again to hear a free-speech challenge to the California law
that protects the rights of celebrities and their heirs to profit from
their likeness.</TE>
<TE>   Without comment, the justices turned away an appeal from Los Angeles
artist Gary Saderup, who had done charcoal drawings of the Three
Stooges--Moe, Larry and Curly--and reproduced them on T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>   The heirs sued, and the California Supreme Court agreed last year that
Saderup must pay them the $75,000 in profits he received. Under the
so-called "right to publicity" law, the heirs retain the publicity rights
for 70 years after the death of a celebrity. (Saderup vs. Comedy III
Productions, 01-368)</TE>
<TE>   * Refused to stop a California invasion-of-privacy lawsuit brought by
truckers who discovered that video cameras had been installed in the
men's room at a company shipping hub in Mira Loma in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The company, Consolidated Freightways, said it wanted to stamp out
drug use. Its lawyers also contended that federal labor law should shield
the company because the national contract made reference to the
possibility of video surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   But the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco rejected that claim,
and the Supreme Court refused to intervene. (Consolidated Freightways vs.
Cramer, 01-432)</TE>
<TE>   * Turned away a double jeopardy appeal from Terry L. Nichols, Timothy
J. McVeigh's accomplice in the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah
federal building in Oklahoma City. The action clears the way for his
trial on state charges of murder, which could lead to the death penalty.
Nichols has already been convicted in federal court of conspiracy and
involuntary manslaughter involving the deaths of eight federal agents,
for which he was sentenced to life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The 5th Amendment says, "No person shall . . . be subject for the same
offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb," but the Supreme
Court has historically refused to limit state and federal authorities
from bringing separate charges for the same crime. (Nichols vs. Oklahoma,
01-6794)</TE>
<TE>   * Refused to hear a Minnesota biology teacher's claim that he had
academic freedom under the 1st Amendment to refuse to teach evolution.
Rodney LeVake, the teacher, was transferred to another class, and he
sued.</TE>
<TE>   While federal courts have said university professors have academic
freedom, high school teachers have not won the same rights, and they can
be dismissed for refusing to teach the assigned curriculum. (LeVake vs.
Independent School District, 01-665)</TE>
<TE>   * Declined to act on the state of Texas' request that it review a
ruling by the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals that a man sentenced to
death for murder in 1984 was entitled to a new trial because his lawyer
slept through substantial portions of the original trial.</TE>
<TE>   The 5th Circuit said that Calvin Burdine's trial was fundamentally
unfair because of the "consistent unconsciousness" of his court-appointed
attorney, Joe Frank Cannon.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court, which has never ruled on whether a defendant is
entitled to a new trial because his lawyer frequently fell asleep during
a trial, gave no reason on why it was holding off any decision.</TE>
<TE>   However, some legal observers said they thought it was possible the
high court had declined to act because it granted review in a Tennessee
case last month, after the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that
Gary Cone, who was sentenced to death there in 1982, was entitled to a
new trial because his lawyer failed to offer any mitigating evidence
during the trial's penalty case.</TE>
<TE>   Although Cone's lawyer did not sleep during the trial, both cases deal
with the issue of what constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel
under the Constitution's 6th Amendment.</TE>

<LD>A man accused of pummeling a fellow hockey dad to death shoved
aside an assistant rink manager before the fatal beating began, the
manager testified.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas Junta, 42, is accused of beating Michael Costin to death after
the two argued over rough play at their 10-year-old sons' July 2000
hockey practice. Junta says he acted in self-defense.</LD>
<LD>   Nancy Blanchard told the Middlesex County Superior Court jury she saw
Junta and Costin, 40, scuffle briefly at the suburban Boston rink. She
said Junta returned about a minute later and she told him he couldn't
enter the rink.</LD>
<TE>   She said Junta pushed her against a wall. Junta then grabbed Costin by
the collar and threw him to the floor, Blanchard testified.</TE>

<LD>A former Tyson Foods employee pleaded guilty to conspiracy,
admitting in a Chattanooga court that he smuggled illegal immigrants into
the country to work for the poultry giant and provided them with
fraudulent identification.</LD>
<LD>   Amador Anchondo-Rascon could face five years in prison, a $250,000
fine and forfeiture of any gains from the alleged conspiracy, which
prosecutors say started in 1994.</LD>

Mexico would testify against six Tyson executives, including a vice
president, indicted last month.</LD>

<HD>Study Warns of Fallout in Rising Health Costs</HD>

<LD>With less money available to pay for increasing health care costs,
politicians, employers and consumers face difficult choices in the year
ahead, government statisticians said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Health care costs grew from 1999 to 2000 at the fastest annual rate in
12 years, signaling the "end of an era of reasonable health care cost
growth" and the beginning of a period of serious belt-tightening,
according to economists at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services. The slow economy contributed to the problem.</LD>
<LD>   "All the different payers are going to be under pressure to make
difficult choices in terms of what [health care services] they're able to
pay for," said Katharine Levit, director of the centers' National Health
Statistics Group and an author of the report, in a telephone news
conference.</LD>
<TE>   The government report on health care inflation, published today in the
journal Health Affairs, bolsters previously released studies by private
groups. Studies analyzing preliminary 2001 numbers have found that health
care costs increased by more than 10% last year, far more than the 6.9%
jump in 2000 cited in the government report.</TE>
<TE>   And like some other analyses, the new study identified hospital
spending and prescription drug costs as the primary forces driving the
increase. Spending for prescription drugs grew 17.3% in 2000, making
medicines the fastest-growing health care cost. But hospital care
accounts for the largest single category of health care spending, and its
cost jumped 5.1% from 1999 to 2000, the largest annual increase since
1993.</TE>
<TE>   Released at the beginning of an election year, the numbers point to
health care's continuing prominence as a political issue.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration, which early last year promised a prescription
drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries and expanded patients' rights,
now is faced with a sluggish economy and federal coffers drained by a
large tax cut and unanticipated expenses for the war and anti-terrorism
measures.</TE>
<TE>   "Consumers will be paying more for their health services . . . and
they may face benefit packages that look slightly different," said
economist Cynthia Smith, another of the report's authors.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Dennett, vice president for health policy at the American
Benefits Council, a trade association that represents large companies,
agrees that cost shifting from employers to employees is "very likely in
the short term if employers are faced with 15% to 20% premium increases."</TE>
<TE>   The only "light at all visible at the end of a pretty dark tunnel,"
Dennett said, comes from those working to give consumers more of a say in
their health care choices. Most large employers "are only now beginning
to look at how to do that," he said.</TE>
