<HD>HBO Films Move On to Fill Another Void</HD>

<LD>When Home Box Office came into existence, its appeal was pretty
obvious: movies, movies and more movies, with all the sex, violence,
nudity and language normally expunged when they played on television.</LD>
<LD>   Movies are still a big part of the pay channel's mix, especially
for those of us who can watch several minutes of "Gladiator" any time
we stumble across it. Yet HBO soon realized that the channel would
have to make its mark with original programs, both to stand apart
from other movie services and to justify those $10 or $12 monthly
fees.</LD>
<LD>   "The Larry Sanders Show" was there relatively early on to augment
boxing, concert specials and late-night nakedness, but for years
HBO's image largely rested on its made-for-TV movies. With racier
subject matter and bigger budgets, the pay service earned the Emmy
Award for best movie in seven straight years.</LD>
<TE>   Its dominance became so vexing that the major networks began to
question if HBO should be eligible at all, suggesting the clever
slogan "It's not TV. It's HBO" confirmed that the channel plays in a
different league.</TE>
<TE>   Then along came "The Sopranos," "Sex and the City" and "Six Feet
Under," award-winning series providing network executives new reasons
to seethe. HBO's movies, meanwhile, quickly found themselves
overshadowed, going from belle of the ball to less-than-beautiful
stepsister faster than you can say, "Ba-da-bing!"</TE>
<TE>   As a result, HBO's latest challenge has been to redefine its
movies. And while its series offer a counterpoint to the major
networks, executives say the movies have seized upon a different
niche--namely, the void left by a feature film industry whose
emphasis on blockbusters leaves scant room for thoughtful,
character-driven dramas.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw ourselves at first as filling a gap in the then-TV movie
business," said Colin Callender, president of HBO Films. "Now we look
at our movies as filling a gap in the motion picture business."</TE>
<TE>   Two recent productions underscore this approach: "The Gathering
Storm," a chronicle of Winston Churchill's years out of power before
World War II, which premiered last month; and "Path to War," a
$17-million production detailing the Johnson administration's descent
into the political quagmire of Vietnam, which makes its debut May 18.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond being more complex than your average summer movie with a
"II" or "3" affixed to it, both pictures sought to toe the line in
terms of historical accuracy--avoiding the sort of liberty-taking
that fueled controversy around such recent features as "A Beautiful
Mind" and "The Hurricane."</TE>
<TE>   Presidential historian Michael Beschloss--having winced his way
through "Thirteen Days," "JFK" and "Nixon"--served as a consultant on
"Path to War" and endorses the film's faithfulness to historical
record. He added that in a perfect world, film adaptations wouldn't
need to spin facts to make them more compelling. "I realize that is
not too likely, mainly because the needs of drama and the needs of
history are different," he said.</TE>
<TE>   HBO's world might not be perfect, but the channel does possess
certain advantages in that it doesn't live or die by the tyranny of
Nielsen ratings or weekend box-office receipts. Consider "The
Gathering Storm," whose most special effect is a flabby old
Englishman (played by Albert Finney) frequently shown sitting in his
bathtub. Its premiere drew only an estimated 2.7 million viewers.</TE>
<TE>   Now, someone at NBC who ordered a prime-time series delivering
that sort of audience or a film executive who had that many people
turn out for a $100-million summer blockbuster would probably begin
brushing up his resume.</TE>
<TE>   HBO, however, defines success on its own terms. "Gathering Storm"
generated glowing reviews and will be repeated again and again.
Although tune-in was relatively small, the movie connected with a
segment of the audience, just like boxing or "Real Sex" or a Britney
Spears concert.</TE>
<TE>   At HBO, the goal is not to reach everyone at once but rather to
patch together a quilt that will leave various components of the
subscriber base feeling satisfied. "We're looking at different movies
to speak to different parts of the audience," Callender explained.</TE>
<TE>   "Being freed up from the commercial pressures of the box office
... enables us to tell a story where we don't have to make the same
concessions a director working for a studio does. The historical
stories we tell, we want to get it right. We're not changing known
facts or adapting history to make better dramas."</TE>
<TE>   Small wonder that HBO engenders so much sniping among broadcasters
who speak enviously of an uneven playing field. When the rulebook
allows for putting quality ahead of quantity, bunt singles can
resemble home runs--a point even nonpartisans have noticed. As former
NBC Chairman Grant Tinker observed during a discussion last week,
"Programming HBO looks like a dream job."</TE>
<TE>   That said, the HBO movie appears to be at a crossroads, especially
with the series amassing most of the headlines. Even the hugely
expensive and ambitious miniseries "Band of Brothers" was
less-than-overwhelming ratings-wise, given the investment.</TE>
<TE>   If any of this has placed extra pressure on "Path to War," no one
at HBO is saying so, though hopes are clearly high. Though Beschloss
would prefer seeing more people crack open a history book, he
welcomes the meticulous care that has gone into the film, given the
effect such projects can have on public perception. "Filmmakers are
going to have a lot more influence on the way Americans see Lyndon
Johnson or Richard Nixon than any historian, no matter how well the
book sells," he said. "That's just a fact of life."</TE>
<TE>   An additional fact is that the major networks have cut back on TV
movies at the same time the local multiplex is offering a dwindling
list of options for those who were sentient for Johnson's inaugural.
All of that could bode well for the near-forgotten HBO movie, whose
slogan could just as easily read, "It's Not Your Latest Mega-Sequel
Aimed at Teenagers. It's HBO."</TE>

<HD>Gassing Up Fuel Cells</HD>
<DH>GM's S-10 pickup runs on gasoline converted to hydrogen on
board the truck, an interim step to the ultimate nonpolluting
propulsion system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>HONEOYE FALLS, N.Y.--The hum emanating from the pickup truck comes
from the same power source that has provided electricity for space
shuttles and Apollo rockets: a fuel cell.</LD>
<LD>   But whereas those cells are powered by pure hydrogen stored in
on-board tanks, this system--developed by General Motors Corp.--uses
gasoline converted to hydrogen on board the modified Chevrolet S-10.</LD>
<LD>   The pickup is the first drivable gasoline-powered fuel cell
vehicle, GM said.</LD>
<TE>   The truck is significant because a persistent obstacle to
widespread use of low-polluting or nonpolluting fuel cells in cars
and trucks has been how best to obtain the hydrogen that produces the
electricity used to power them.</TE>
<TE>   It is easier to extract hydrogen from methanol or natural gas, but
gasoline is the only one of the fuels already widely available to
motorists.</TE>
<TE>   With 180,000 filling stations in the U.S. "it makes sense to make
the gasoline stand the refilling spot," said Larry Burns, GM's vice
president for research and development.</TE>
<TE>   The system works by mixing low-sulfur gasoline with air and water,
then passing the mixture over a series of catalysts that extract the
hydrogen.</TE>
<TE>   The hydrogen then is routed to the fuel cell stack, where it is
combined with oxygen from the air to produce electricity.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists worry that the experimental gasoline fuel cell
still emits carbon dioxide. But GM said the levels are as much as 50%
less than from an internal-combustion engine. And the system achieves
up to 40% overall energy efficiency--50% better than a combustion
engine and the equivalent of 40 miles per gallon.</TE>
<TE>   Driving the truck during a demonstration at the auto maker's fuel
cell research facility in upstate New York last week revealed a
vehicle that is noisy at idle. The fuel pump is audible, though that
noise should eventually be eliminated. Passengers also can hear the
air compressor, sounding like a hair dryer, and a whine from the
electric motor.</TE>
<TE>   That motor produces 25 kilowatts of power, about 33 horsepower,
which is boosted by a large battery to a total of about 100
horsepower. The battery is kept charged by electricity from the
on-board fuel cell.</TE>
<TE>   The system hums and hisses, and it emits a cloud of water vapor
and carbon dioxide from the tailpipe.</TE>
<TE>   At speed, the truck produces smooth, normal responses, although at
6,300 pounds--2,500 more than a conventional S-10--it is heavy. It
takes a slug-like 15 seconds to accelerate from a standstill to 60
mph.</TE>
<TE>   GM said the goal at present is efficiency rather than performance
but insisted that fuel-cell-powered versions of the S-10 with
performance comparable to that of internal-combustion versions could
reach the market by 2010.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually all auto makers are deep into researching fuel cells.
They are seen as the ultimate nonpolluting propulsion system once
pure hydrogen becomes the fuel. GM's proposed system is an interim
step.</TE>
<TE>   "If you start with gasoline, you still get CO2 as a pollutant,
whereas if you store the hydrogen as a compressed gas, you just get
water vapor," said David Eisenhaure, chief executive of SatCon, a
Cambridge, Mass., company that produces systems that convert DC power
from fuel cells into AC power for industrial applications.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said, "the gasoline reformer is a fine step to get
people on the way" toward a pure hydrogen propulsion system.</TE>
<TE>   And hydrogen, said GM's Burns, "is the way of the future."</TE>
<TE>   The goal, he said, is "to get the automobile out of the energy and
environmental debate altogether."</TE>

<HD>Parts Seekers Get Help in Beating the Crush</HD>
<DH>Revised state rules aim to give consumers better access to
rare components before junked vehicles are reduced to scrap.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a victory for restorers, hot rodders and those who simply prefer
to do their own auto repairs, state air quality regulators have
agreed to give consumers the chance to buy scrapped vehicles, or
parts from them, before they are crushed into blocks of steel.</LD>
<LD>   The rules were written by the California Air Resources Board. The
board has been the chief proponent of destroying older cars and
trucks on the grounds that many of them are heavy polluters.</LD>
<LD>   Under the new program, administered by the state's air quality
management districts, interested consumers are notified by e-mail of
a vehicle's pending arrival at a salvage yard. The system also
provides for a waiting period before vehicles can be reduced to
scrap.</LD>
<TE>   Previously, cars and trucks sold to state-approved scrap programs
could be destroyed within days of arriving.</TE>
<TE>   "This makes parts that would otherwise have been lost become
available, and it gives the public the chance to find rare parts,"
said Frank Bohanan, technical consultant to the Specialty Equipment
Market Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The Diamond Bar-based trade group represents a large portion of
the automobile performance and customizing industry and was a major
player in the effort to halt wholesale, automatic destruction of
scrapped vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The so-called voluntary accelerated vehicle retirement program
typically pays motorists $400 to $600 to turn in older-model used
cars and trucks that still run.</TE>
<TE>   Scrap yards participating in the program earn pollution credits
they can sell to businesses seeking to avoid installing costly
antipollution equipment.</TE>
<TE>   But many auto enthusiasts complained that the scrap programs were
too draconian. By insisting that all components of a vehicle be
destroyed, opponents said, the programs eliminated valuable repair
and restoration parts.Intensive lobbying by groups such as SEMA
resulted in adoption earlier this year of rules that permit scrap
program operators to sell body, trim, upholstery and other parts not
associated with a vehicle's powertrain.</TE>
<TE>   The scrap yards also can sell entire vehicles to motorists who
want engine, transmission or other drive-line parts. But the state
will not issue pollution credits for vehicles sold instead of
scrapped, so the value of those credits probably will be added to the
asking price of the junked vehicle, Bohanan said.</TE>
<TE>   The new notification program, which began last month, enables
consumers to register their interest in particular vehicle makes and
models with the air resources board. Consumers can sign up for e-mail
notification through SEMA's Web site at www.enjoythedrive.com.</TE>
<TE>   When an owner makes an appointment to turn in a car or truck for
scrap, the system automatically logs the vehicle, scans the list of
interested parties and sends e-mail notifications to those it
identifies.</TE>
<TE>   A consumer interested in salvaging parts from the vehicle can then
call the scrap yard for an appointment, inspect the vehicle and
negotiate for parts.</TE>
<TE>   While the old system encouraged scrap-yard operators to junk cars
and trucks as soon as possible, the new system requires them to wait
10 days from the time an owner calls to arrange to sell them a
vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   The scrap yard must add seven days to the waiting period--for a
total of 17--if a consumer then calls to make an appointment to
inspect the car or truck for parts.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mail messages notifying consumers about a vehicle will
include the dismantling yard's location and the time the vehicle will
arrive.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good program," Bohanan said. "They are being proactive.
They are notifying you."</TE>

<HD>Ferrari Takes Fx to New Technological Heights</HD>
<DH>The $450,000 car succeeds the F50. Other new models include
Mercedes' super-luxury Maybach and VW's Touareg.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Italian car maker Ferrari will launch a successor to its exotic F50
next year and is showing a "design prototype," called the FX, that it
says provides a pretty good idea of what the finished car will look
like.</LD>
<LD>   The production model is scheduled to be unwrapped at the Paris
Auto Show in September. Ferrari is expected to make about 350 a year,
and buyers should expect to pay about $450,000 a car.</LD>
<LD>   The car will take Ferrari's most advanced, Formula 1-derived
technologies off the track and put them on the road. They include a
650-horsepower V-12 engine, a clutchless Formula 1-type transmission,
composite brake discs, traction control and electronically controlled
shock absorbers.</LD>
<TE>   Top speed is expected to be about 215 mph--with zero to 60
acceleration under four seconds--plenty quick to get you up steep
freeway onramps and merged into rush-hour traffic.</TE>
<TE>   The prototype was unveiled last week at a design exhibit at the
Tokyo Museum of Contemporary Art.</TE>
<TE>   Mercedes to Launch Super-Luxury Maybach</TE>
<TE>   In its relentless search for profit, luxury-car maker
Mercedes-Benz has extended its reach down into the middle classes
with vehicles such as the C230 Coupe, which sells for a mere $25,000.</TE>
<TE>   Now it's going in the other direction with an entry in what it
calls the super-luxury market.</TE>
<TE>   It won't be a Mercedes, though, but a Maybach--resurrection of a
name that was synonymous with chauffeurs and champagne in the Europe
of the roaring 1920s and dangerous '30s.</TE>
<TE>   It has been 61 years since Maybach Manufaktur quit building cars,
but Mercedes--whose founder, Gottleib Daimler, was friend and mentor
to Wilhelm Maybach-- has never forgotten. It was Maybach, after all,
who designed the first Mercedes, named after the car buyer's
daughter, for Daimler in 1901.</TE>
<TE>   Wilhelm and son Karl later started a business making engines for
the famed Zepplin airships, and in 1919 Karl Maybach began building
the luxury cars that bore his name.</TE>
<TE>   They ranged from two-seat roadsters to posh limousines. The
biggest, called the Zepplin, was 18 feet long and powered by a
12-cylinder engine.</TE>
<TE>   The new Maybach, scheduled to be launched in Europe this fall and
in the U.S. in spring 2003, will use a 550-horsepower,
twin-turbocharged V-12 engine. Each car will be built to order, and
DaimlerChrysler plans to offer a huge palette of luxury interior
appointments, including a number of high-tech touches such as a
wireless fax and an e-mail-capable integrated phone for the traveling
business executive.</TE>
<TE>   There will be two versions, a regular-length sedan at 18.8 feet in
length and a stretch sedan at 20.2 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Mercedes hasn't said anything out loud about pricing, but expect
it to start in the low $300,000s.</TE>
<TE>   The production version will be unveiled at the Paris show this
fall.</TE>
<TE>   Volkswagen's Touareg SUV Coming to U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Volkswagen, which brings the Touareg, its version of
Porsche's Cayenne super-sport utility vehicle (Highway 1, March 6,
2002), to market in the U.S. next year.</TE>
<TE>   The Touareg shares the Porsche's platform (as will a new Audi,
based on the Magellan concept, which probably will be introduced as
an '05 model).</TE>
<TE>   It will have features such as full-time four-wheel drive, air
springs, electronically controlled shocks and engines ranging from a
base 225-horsepower V6 to a 395-horsepower W-12--think of a pair of
V-6s mounted side by side.</TE>
<TE>   A trailer-hauling V-10 diesel with about 550 pounds-feet of torque
and 310 horsepower also is on the list.</TE>
<TE>   Transmissions will be six-speed, manual or automatic.</TE>
<TE>   Price tags probably will range from the low $30,000s to the
mid-$60,000s.</TE>

<HD>Auto Insurers Have All the Risk Factors Covered</HD>
<DH>If you're married, that's good. If you smoke, that's bad.
Your premiums are based on many logical and unfathomable criteria.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Automobile insurance costs are jumping sharply in California, an
unpleasant reality that will deliver a disproportionately harsh jolt
for many individuals.</LD>
<LD>   Allstate Corp., the state's third-largest insurer, announced last
week that automobile insurance rates would move up by 8.9%, adding
$64 to the average policy, which now costs $718 annually.</LD>
<LD>   Other insurers also are seeking to increase rates, saying they are
losing money on their policies in California and need the higher
rates to meet rising claims.</LD>
<TE>   Although the average rate bump is bad enough, some policyholders
are going to get stung by even larger increases, though others will
see smaller increases or even declines in their annual premiums.</TE>
<TE>   "When you hear that a company gets a 6.9% rate increase, that
doesn't mean that everybody gets that," said Mike Edwards, a
Department of Insurance bureau chief who has regulatory authority
over a portion of the industry. "Some may get a 15% increase and some
may get a decrease."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, if you're a teacher, lawyer, doctor, scientist or
engineer, you may be lucky and get a discount. If you're a cook,
politician or priest, you're nothing special in the eyes of the
insurance industry.</TE>
<TE>   How could that be possible? Why should a doctor but not a nurse
get a break? Why should a lawyer but not a lifeguard at the beach get
a break?</TE>
<TE>   It is all part of the calculus of California's remarkably complex
automobile regulatory apparatus that can raise or lower rates for
individuals and families based on 19 factors. The system leaves even
experts confused sometimes.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish there was a clear-cut breakdown, but there isn't," said
Pete Moraga, spokesman for the Insurance Information Network of
California, an industry trade group. "If I can't understand it, I
can't imagine how others feel who aren't involved on a daily basis.
It is complicated. [But] I don't think it's as bad as the tax code."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe. Under state law and Department of Insurance regulations,
the industry sets auto rates based on three primary and 16 secondary
factors.</TE>
<TE>   The primary factors--years of experience, driving record and miles
driven per year--account for 75% of the premium. The others, which
range from logical to bizarre, account for the rest.</TE>
<TE>   In the world of insurance, if you're married, that's good. If you
smoke, that's bad. But if you're a fast-food junkie, it doesn't
matter because there are no regulations that deal with the folks who
stuff their mouths with ketchup-coated French fries while behind the
wheel.</TE>
<TE>   If you're a young man, that's very bad. If you're a young man with
good grades in school, that's not quite as bad. If you're an elderly
lady, that may be good or bad--at some point, years of experience
transforms from a positive to a negative.</TE>
<TE>   Of the secondary factors, your home address tops the list: If you
live in Orange County, that's generally good. If you live in Los
Angeles County, you're probably toast. One exception is Catalina
Island, where you can't even have a car.</TE>
<TE>   Other secondary factors include the type and performance
characteristics of the vehicle, engine size, type of safety devices
on the vehicle, type of vehicle use and the percentage the vehicle is
used by the rated driver. Also, the driver's academic standing and
gender, whether the driver smokes, whether the driver has completed a
driver education program, whether the rated driver is part of a
household with other vehicles and whether the driver or that
household has multiple policies. And finally, a broad category called
secondary driver characteristics, and the relative frequency and
severity of claims filed by all drivers where the car is garaged.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are group discounts. They are why teachers and others
get occupational discounts. To obtain regulatory approval for such
discounts, insurance companies must show that the group has smaller
claims or that the company can market insurance to the group at a
lower total administrative cost.</TE>
<TE>   "It requires a large number of risks to do that," Edwards said.
"It would suggest that you couldn't do it for professional basketball
players, because there aren't that many of them. But you could do it
for teachers and lawyers."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the group discounts, there is the good driver
discount. Good drivers are defined as the folks with no more than one
point on their records. A point is generally one moving violation or
one at-fault accident. Good driver points are kept by the Department
of Insurance and are not related to the points kept by the Department
of Motor Vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Good drivers get a 20% discount. But good drivers who get into an
accident and earn a point can see their insurance rates shoot up even
though, with only that one point, they remain good drivers, Moraga
acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   The contraption that controls these rates is a product of
Prop.103, the 1988 ballot measure that was supposed to fix the
automobile insurance problem in California.</TE>
<TE>   After voters approved it, it was left to the Legislature and the
Insurance Department to develop the rules to implement the measure.</TE>
<TE>   The department gets about 9,000 filings a year from insurers
asking to adjust rates or make other changes in their operating
practices. Lately, they have been seeking higher rates, Edwards said.</TE>
<TE>   "Companies are pushing the envelope against the rate-making
standards we have," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't been able to give them all that they want, but in some
cases their losses are so tremendous we do give them all that they
want."</TE>

<HD>At 77, 'Path to War' Producer Is Still Driven to Tell
Stories</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Lowry</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Edgar Scherick spent 10 years trying to bring the Vietnam-era story
"Path to War" to the screen, at one point waiting for Barry Levinson
to decide if he wanted to direct the film before John Frankenheimer
agreed to come on board and delivered the project from limbo.</LD>
<LD>   Not that he's complaining.</LD>
<LD>   "A good script is like a bottle of wine. It gets better with age,"
the producer said.</LD>
<TE>   At 77, Scherick would be the first to admit he knows a little
something about aging. Yet despite suffering a stroke five years ago
that left him in a wheelchair, he continues to actively pitch and
produce projects. Already in the works is a movie for Showtime,
"Panic in the White House," documenting the reaction in Washington to
the events of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Scherick's storied career includes establishing the "Wide World of
Sports" franchise at ABC and later heading programming for that
network. As a producer, his credits range from the features "Sleuth,"
"Shoot the Moon" and "The Heartbreak Kid" to TV movies such as "Raid
on Entebbe"--still a favorite production 25 years later, though the
mere mention of it raises his blood pressure because ABC rushed a
competing version, "Victory at Entebbe," on first.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the face of well-documented charges of ageism that, as
Scherick points out, have left the Hollywood Hills brimming with
veteran writing talent that has no place to go, the producer said he
has never considered retiring.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the impetus of my life," he said. "I've done it so long, I
don't know what else to do."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, for all the hand-wringing about the state of made-for-TV
movies with the major networks having dramatically cut back in that
area, Scherick still finds himself fascinated by history and driven
to tell stories. The economics of the business are a mess, he
conceded, but "if a guy wants to pay me to get something I like made,
you don't have to open up the Bank of England."</TE>
<TE>   Scherick says he adheres to the same principles that guided him in
less frenetic times, such as the 1980s, when he could drop by
then-NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff's office
unannounced just to chat. "All I wanted," he said, "was to have the
respect of the people I work with and like the material I'm dealing
with."</TE>

<HD>Rising From 9/11 Ashes, Tribeca Film Fest Is on a Mission</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN CLARK</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Jane Rosenthal is multitasking. She's sending an e-mail while saying,
"I'm trying to do this in 120 days without having a nervous
breakdown."</LD>
<LD>   "This" is the Tribeca Film Festival, which has emerged fully
formed from the ashes of the World Trade Center disaster. In those
four months, producer Rosenthal and partner Robert De Niro organized
a three-ring circus that has generated a lot of buzz here. Starting
today and running through Sunday, it features, among other things,
150 films, more than a dozen panel discussions and an outdoor rock
and comedy concert.</LD>
<LD>   Asked recently if all of this isn't a bit nuts, Rosenthal, who is
also in the middle of production with De Niro (on "Analyze That") and
has two young children, says, "I thought it was nuts that two planes
could fly into the trade center."</LD>
<TE>   And that, in a nutshell, is the Tribeca Film Festival's guiding
principle: to memorialize what happened on Sept. 11 and to revitalize
lower Manhattan. Everything else--the logistics, the time and
financial constraints--is swept before it.</TE>
<TE>   The Tribeca Film Center, which houses Rosenthal and De Niro's
company, Tribeca Productions, was perilously close to the trade
center disaster. In the ensuing weeks and months, New York City
police and firemen, the National Guard, the Red Cross and Federal
Emergency Management Agency personnel were a regular feature of life
there, not to mention checkpoints, interrupted phone and transit
service, and smoke and ashes from the buildings' fires and collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Though much of the neighborhood has been put back together, 9/11
lives on in the people who live and work in TriBeCa--an abbreviation
for the triangle below Canal Street. It may explain the slightly
messianic quality that Rosenthal brings to the enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like we're trying to do something for the community," she
says emphatically, perched on the edge of a couch and looking a bit
wan. "We're not doctors or firemen or crane operators. We're
filmmakers."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps because of media interest in the festival, Rosenthal and
De Niro were able to attract some major studio films. Universal
Pictures' "About a Boy," starring Hugh Grant, opens the festival (De
Niro was one of the film's five producers), and 20th Century Fox's
"Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones" closes it (an enormous
coup, courtesy of director George Lucas). In between are Warner
Bros.' "Insomnia," with Al Pacino and Robin Williams, and "Divine
Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood," with Sandra Bullock and Ashley
Judd.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of holding an independent film festival in TriBeCa had
occurred to De Niro and Rosenthal before; the pair had been talking
about it off and on for the past 10 years, but other projects got in
the way. There were no more excuses after Sept. 11. This sense of
urgency also explains how they managed to secure the cooperation of
so many big names so quickly (although it's also true that Rosenthal
and De Niro have friends in high places).</TE>
<TE>   Rosenthal says they picked early May in part because it didn't
conflict with any of the other major festivals--although it ends only
three days before the Cannes Film Festival begins. Rosenthal insists
that this does not concern her. According to Tom Ortenberg, president
of Lions Gate, it shouldn't.</TE>
<TE>   "Cannes is an international market heavily influenced by European
film," he says. "Tribeca is a great coming-together of the indie film
community in the U.S. With or without Sept. 11 this would be a great
idea."</TE>
<TE>   Venues for the films are makeshift in time-honored festival
fashion. They include not only the local performing arts center and
nearby screening rooms but also auditoriums at Pace University and
Stuyvesant High School, where students had to flee uptown after the
Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenthal also tried to establish an outdoor screening venue. When
that didn't work out for financial reasons, they came up with a plan
for a rock and comedy concert in Battery Park.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the latest "Star Wars" episode and other major summer
films, will New Yorkers pay attention? No festival, no matter how
attractive, can take over New York the same way Park City, Utah (home
to Sundance), Toronto and Cannes are co-opted by their festivals. But
TriBeCa is a relatively small neighborhood of warehouses, lofts,
restaurants, boutiques, art galleries and cobblestone streets snug by
the Hudson River.</TE>
<TE>   In a way it brings New York down to a manageable size and may give
the festival a physical focus. It's also where a number of indie
production companies and studios are headquartered or have offices.</TE>
<TE>   The Tribeca festival is seen as fertile ground to show some
upcoming smaller releases. Miramax is here with "The Importance of
Being Earnest"; Sony Pictures Classics has "Thirteen Conversations
About One Thing" and "Happy Times"; Lions Gate, "Lovely and Amazing";
ThinkFilm, "The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys"; First Look, "Elling"
and "A Song for Martin"; Artisan, "Standing in the Shadows of
Motown." Many of these films have screened at other festivals, and a
number of them are opening soon.</TE>
<TE>   There is also a slew of films competing that don't have
distribution, including 15 feature films, 11 documentaries and 36
shorts. The festival's programmer is Eamonn Bowles, president of
Magnolia Pictures and a veteran of the indie scene. He and his
colleagues culled through some 1,400 films to arrive at a slate. His
mandate, he says, was fairly simple.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a lot of festivals froth at the mouth at getting a world
premiere," he says. "We're just looking for good films. We've got
films from Iran, Korea, all over the world, but we're not being
snobby. They're not inaccessible."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, they're intended to be seen--and bought. Rosenthal says
that De Niro insisted there be competitions and prizes, with the idea
that winners might get distribution. He apparently envisions the
festival as a market as well as a showcase.</TE>
<TE>   ThinkFilm President Mark Urman thinks this is not out of the
question. "If this takes hold, you will find next year people will
time unveiling a movie here," he says. "The buyers will be here
because of their proximity to it. [Artisan CEO] Amir Malin and
[Miramax chief] Harvey Weinstein only have to walk a few blocks."</TE>
<TE>   Rosenthal and De Niro want to make the festival an annual affair;
American Express, the festival's sponsor, has a three-year commitment
to support it. On the other hand, Rosenthal is not prepared to talk
about expanding from five days to a week or 10 days, as is typical
for the other major festivals.</TE>
<TE>   And what will the Tribeca Film Festival mean in 10 years, when the
festival will have evolved into a showcase for studio films or indie
films or both? Won't it be just another festival?</TE>
<TE>   "There were thousands killed at the trade center," Rosenthal says
soberly. "This will serve as a reminder."</TE>

<HD>Stones Tour: All Over the Map</HD>
<DH>Pop Music* The band will play large venues and small this
coming fall, including Staples, Edison Field and the Wiltern.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Few bands can cause as much excitement announcing a tour as actually
playing the shows, but the Rolling Stones did it again Tuesday. And
it wasn't just arriving via blimp at a New York City press
conference.</LD>
<LD>   Trumping speculation about whether the veteran British rock group
would focus on stadiums or sports arenas for its 40th anniversary
tour, the Stones announced they will play both, as well as a handful
of small theaters. In several major cities, they'll do all three.</LD>
<LD>   When the tour reaches Southern California in October, the group
will play Anaheim's Edison Field, Staples Center in downtown L.A. and
the 2,200-seat Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   In an era of escalating concert prices, tickets for the
small-venue shows will cost just $50, while prices will average $85
at stadium shows and $100 for the arena stops. The Stones will
compensate for the low-priced theater tickets with premium-priced
seats at the arena and stadium dates that will run $250 and up.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea just evolved," tour promoter Michael Cohl said Tuesday
of the three-tiered approach. "They had talked about doing all
stadiums, or all arenas, and it just wasn't getting the band excited.
They were like, 'Done that ... done that.'"</TE>
<TE>   Cohl added that singer Mick Jagger "mentioned that somebody in the
deep, dark past once said they wished they could do it all in each
city, and I immediately said, 'We could do that.'"</TE>
<TE>   "It's innovative," said veteran Los Angeles concert promoter Andy
Hewitt, who has promoted Stones shows on previous tours and will be
involved in dates in Los Angeles, Anaheim and Las Vegas on the new
tour.</TE>
<TE>   "We found that the club date we did in Las Vegas was the easiest
Stones show we'd ever done," Hewitt said of a stop at the MGM Grand.
"They downsize very easily and get back to their roots very easily."</TE>
<TE>   The Stones hold the record for the highest-grossing concert tour
ever with $121.2 million in 1994, but it would appear that topping
their own record isn't the first priority on this tour.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously they could have charged a lot more," said Gary
Bongiovanni, editor of the concert industry tracking publication
Pollstar. "It's nice to see they're being sensitive to the fans, and
not out to gouge people." Industry speculation has been that premium
tickets could go as high as $750 to $1,000.</TE>
<TE>   Said Cohl: "Just because you can charge more, it doesn't mean you
should. We're keeping prices within what we think the market is. This
tour clearly won't be in the top three or four [highest-grossing]
tours ever. There aren't enough dates."</TE>
<TE>   The Stones have played club shows occasionally on previous tours,
but they were usually unannounced warmup dates or surprise added
shows rather than part of the official tour.</TE>
<TE>   It's rare for major acts to include small theaters, arenas and
stadiums on the same tour because staging, sound and lighting
requirements typically are drastically different for each.</TE>
<TE>   The Stones tour includes 32 dates in the U.S. and Canada,
beginning Sept. 5 in Boston and arriving in Southern California for a
Halloween show at Staples Center. The Anaheim show follows on Nov.2
and then the Wiltern stop on Nov.4. The only other Southern
California appearance announced is a Nov. 14 show at the San Diego
Sports Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets for the Los Angeles-area shows are slated to go on sale
May19.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets also will be sold through an online venture between Clear
Channel Entertainment and Sam Goody music stores. Anyone who joins
the GetAccess program for a $60 annual fee will be allowed to buy two
tickets to any show on the tour, including the small-venue shows,
before they are offered to the public, as long as quantities hold
out.</TE>
<TE>   After the North American dates, including some in Mexico, the tour
will continue in Europe, Australia and Asia, where the band hopes to
play its first shows in China next year.</TE>
<TE>   The Stones are scheduled to record a few new songs to be included
on a career retrospective album.</TE>

<LD>   Meredith Vieira to Host Syndicated 'Millionaire'</LD>
<LD>   Spurning advances from CBS, Meredith Vieira has agreed to stay on
ABC's "The View" and become host of the syndicated version of "Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire," which will air in the fall. The first two
choices for host--Regis Philbin and Rosie O'Donnell--had turned down
the job.</LD>
<TE>   Vieira announced the move Tuesday on "The View." "It's the first
show that my family and I sat together, all of us, to watch. So I've
been in love with it as a parent," she said of "Millionaire."</TE>
<TE>   Though terms of the contract were not disclosed, a source close to
the talks said Vieira would earn about $5 million a year--a
considerable jump from the reported $500,000 salary she draws from
appearing on "The View."</TE>
<TE>   ABC had reportedly dangled the "Millionaire" job before Vieira
when it became clear that CBS was interested in her as a replacement
for Bryant Gumbel on "The Early Show." The network was able to make
the complicated deal because it co-produces "The View" and owns Buena
Vista Television, which produces "Millionaire."</TE>
<TE>   CBS had been waiting for Vieira's decision and now must look
elsewhere for Gumbel's replacement. The timing makes it likely that a
permanent host for CBS' third-rated morning news show won't be known
when Gumbel works his final day on May 17.</TE>
<TE>   MOVIES</TE>
<TE>   DreamWorks Victorious in Lawsuit Over 'Piece'</TE>
<TE>   A judge has dismissed a $10-million breach-of-contract lawsuit
filed by a producer of Barry Levinson's political comedy "An
Everlasting Piece" against the film's distributor, DreamWorks
Pictures.</TE>
<TE>   The suit, filed by Jerome O'Connor in February 2001, claimed that
the studio dumped the film--which grossed only $75,000 after opening
in a "platform release" on 13 screens--to curry favor with the
British government. The 2000 movie was set against religious and
political tensions in Belfast.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Harry L. Hupp of the U.S. District Court of Central
California wrote that, because the studio had paid for the movie, it
had the power "in the poker phrase, not to throw good money after bad
in costs of distribution. The producer, while undoubtedly
disappointed, has no right under the contract to complain."</TE>
<TE>   O'Connor's attorney said he plans to appeal the decision,
contending that it allows the studio "to engage in a whole range of
bad faith."</TE>
<TE>   THEATER</TE>
<TE>   A Cadillac on Winter Garden Marquee</TE>
<TE>   Another instance of the uneasy alliance between culture and
commerce: Broadway's historic Winter Garden Theatre, home to hits
such as "Cats," "Mame," "Funny Girl," "Wonderful Town" and its
present tenant, "Mamma Mia!," will be renamed the Cadillac Winter
Garden Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   The move is part of an agreement between the Shubert Organization,
which owns the theater, and General Motors, which makes the luxury
automobile. Terms were not disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Renaming theaters is nothing new on Broadway, although many are
named after theater people, such as Richard Rodgers, Neil Simon,
Helen Hayes and even critics such as Brooks Atkinson and Walter Kerr.
But that has been changing. When two old theaters on 42nd Street were
combined into one by Canadian impresario Garth Drabinsky, they were
re-christened the Ford Center for the Performing Arts. And the Selwyn
was renamed the American Airlines Theatre as part of a 10-year,
$8.5-million deal between the nonprofit theater company and the
airline.</TE>
<TE>   POP/ROCK</TE>
<TE>   Colosseum to Host</TE>
<TE>   Ray Charles Concert</TE>
<TE>   Rome's historic Colosseum will host what venue spokesmen say is
the first concert in its 2,000-year history. On Saturday, Ray Charles
will headline "Time for Life," an event dedicated to promoting global
harmony, the BBC reports.</TE>
<TE>   "This concert is to send a message that we have to seek peace even
when it seems impossible," said the city's mayor, Walter Vetroni.
"That's why we will have singers from countries who have been at war
with one another."</TE>
<TE>   Charles will be joined by Israeli singer Noa and Palestinian
musician Nabil, plus Algeria's Khaled, Argentina's Mercedes Sosa and
artists from Bosnia and Serbia.</TE>
<TE>   The concert launches a three-day international conference
promoting Glocalism--a new initiative aimed at fighting inequity and
conflict through a network of local communities.</TE>
<TE>   Jewel Minus Guitar</TE>
<TE>   on European Tour</TE>
<TE>   After suffering a broken collarbone and rib in a horseback riding
accident last month, Jewel will miss only the first two dates that
had been planned for her European tour. But she won't be able to play
guitar when she hits the road in Germany next week.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little weird.... I guess I'll have to polish up my dance
routine," the 27-year-old singer quipped.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   How happy is Sony Pictures Entertainment with the record $114.8
million opening of "Spider-Man" last weekend? So happy that it's
extending the company's Independence Day weekend--shutting down early
on July 3 and giving employees an extra vacation day on July 5,
according to Variety....Turner Classic Movies will celebrate director
George Sidney, who died Sunday, with a five-film festival today,
starting with "Show Boat" at 5 p.m.</TE>

<HD>Big Changes Suggested for Top Museum</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHANNA NEUMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The Smithsonian Institution's board of regents on
Tuesday made public the report of a blue-ribbon commission of
academics, journalists and museum administrators calling for a
top-to-bottom redo of the National Museum of American History.</LD>
<LD>   The report, endorsed Monday, was commissioned by the regents last
June to study how best to proceed in light of an $80-million donation
from California businessman Kenneth Behring.</LD>
<LD>   In its report, the 23-member commission, chaired by former
director of the federal Office of Management and Budget Richard
Darman, identified several problems. It cited a lack of coherence
("the museum does not seem to meet any obvious test of
comprehensibility"), a bevy of underrepresented subjects and a
displeasing appearance, which the commission calls "the attic
effect--the problem of clutter, darkness and confinement."</LD>
<TE>   The commission is recommending several design changes, such as
opening the center of the museum to create a vertical core. Other
recommendations include an orientation film and more attention to
underrepresented topics.</TE>
<TE>   The museum has been dealing with waves of controversy, including
the resignation of its director, since Lawrence Small's arrival 18
months ago as secretary of the Smithsonian--which includes the Museum
of American History, 15 other museums and galleries, eight research
centers and the National Zoo. Small has sought to increase private
donations to the museums but has also angered many of the curators by
allowing corporations and individuals to put their names on exhibits
and buildings.</TE>
<TE>   The commission was blunt in addressing the concerns of the
curators that the museums' scholarship standards be preserved and the
desire of Small and contributors that the museum be made more
user-friendly.</TE>
<TE>   "The National Museum of American History must impose a
comprehensible sense of intellectual order while avoiding gross
simplification or inattention to important schools of historical
thought."</TE>

<HD>Mixed Signals, But Coup Has Power to Spare</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>NATALIE NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If a revolutionary starts courting the mainstream, is that selling
out? If your tour is corporate-sponsored, can your anti-corporation
messages emerge untainted? If you believe in black power but court a
white audience, will you lose your soul?</LD>
<LD>   These questions came to mind Monday during a House of Blues
concert featuring Oakland hip-hop group the Coup, whose leader, Boots
Riley, has recently struggled with such dilemmas while seeking to
more widely disseminate his views against capitalism and the war in
Afghanistan, and for black and female empowerment.</LD>
<LD>   The show, which also featured human beatbox Kenny Muhammad and New
York turntablist ensemble the X-ecutioners, was part of a tour
sponsored by an energy-drink company. That aspect was represented by
20 minutes of clips capturing wild stunts by crazy fools on
skateboards, surfboards, et al. Often the background music was the
sort of rap-rock that is so popular among mainstream--i.e.,
white--audiences. Indeed, the X-ecutioners' trio of seasoned DJs--Rob
Swift, Total Eclipse and Roc Raida--got a big response from the
racially mixed crowd for "It's Goin' Down," a track that features
alt-metal act Linkin Park.</LD>
<TE>   The Coup easily obscured the tour's frivolous trappings,
delivering a powerful, P-Funk-like performance that was ideologically
riveting at times. The 45-minute set slightly lost focus by the end,
but the six musicians who joined Riley and fellow core member DJ Pam
the Funkstress helped fill out and energize the material drawn from
last year's "Party Music," which was named the No. 8 album of 2001 in
the Village Voice critics' poll.</TE>
<TE>   Where the album's laid-back ambience belies the urgency of Riley's
statements, the energetic live show underscored the power and fury of
his words. Which just proved that for the Coup, demanding attention
from inside the enemy's own logo-festooned territory was well worth
the risk.</TE>

<HD>Christians Are Putting Faith in Movie-Rating Web Sites</HD>
<DH>Internet* About three dozen online reviewers now screen
Hollywood movies for content that could be at odds with religious
values.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK PINSKY</AU>
<BD>ORLANDO SENTINEL</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Movies are an important diversion in Juneau, Alaska, especially
during the long, dark winter.</LD>
<LD>   So when Hona Burkholder, a 26-year-old youth pastor at that city's
Auke Bay Bible Church, wasn't sure whether "We Were Soldiers," a film
about the Vietnam War, was worth the trudge to one of the town's two
theaters, he didn't take any chances.</LD>
<LD>   Burkholder sat down at his computer, signed on to the Internet and
went to Christiancritic.com. There, he sought the advice of the
site's founder, Michael Elliott, an Orlando, Fla., businessman and
former actor who devotes his free time to divining "Christian
parables" from commercial movies. Recalling the old saying about
there being "no atheists in foxholes," Elliott gave the movie 31/2
stars out of a possible four.</LD>
<TE>   "This incredibly honest and graphically violent film about a
nearly forgotten Vietnam battle brings us as close to hellish
conditions as we should ever want to get," he wrote. "Asking God for
deliverance from such a place is not only reasonable, it often seemed
to be the only option at hand."</TE>
<TE>   That was exactly the information Burkholder was looking for.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike's rating reassured me that I could comfortably attend and
recommend 'We Were Soldiers' to parents who felt that their child
would benefit from a realistic picture of the horror of Vietnam," he
said, via e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   "I use Christian Web review sites for the same reason people
watched 'Siskel and Ebert' for so many years: to make an informed
choice before I plunk down $8 for a movie," Burkholder says.</TE>
<TE>   "Michael's site provides you with a good overview of content in
the movie so you can make a decision. I like Michael because he
doesn't eliminate the value of movies just because they are rated 'R'
or aren't 'Christian.' He leaves it up to each person to make their
own decision. Plus, he does a real good job of seeing the teachable
moments in movies. Even if a movie is rotten, he provides food for
thought to the viewer."</TE>
<TE>   Elliott's is one of about three dozen Web sites that offer movie
reviews to millions of believers who would like to go to the movies
without being shocked or offended. These sites started showing up in
the mid-'90s, and their popularity is more evidence of a decision on
the part of evangelical Christians to engage popular culture--albeit
selectively--rather than to reject it wholesale as decadent and evil,
says David Bruce, founder of Hollywoodjesus.com.</TE>
<TE>   "Movies are the common language of our culture," Bruce says. And
Christians don't want to be left out of the conversation. "We can no
longer say, 'Don't see this, don't watch that.' We can't do
that--it's all around us."</TE>
<TE>   Although evangelicals don't want to be left out of the culture,
they don't want to be seduced and corrupted by it either.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to encounter it before they criticize it," says the
Rev. Skip Parvin, pastor of Tuskawilla United Methodist Church and
former editor of the magazines Reel to Real: Making the Most of
Movies With Youth, and Reel Faith: Where Meaning Meets the Movies.
"One of the tendencies of Christianity has been to criticize the
culture without encountering it."</TE>
<TE>   When Kimberly Sapp's father decided that she shouldn't see the
movie "Rush Hour 2," the 14-year-old recalls, "I was very
disappointed, but I had to trust my dad because I knew it was the
best decision."</TE>
<TE>   Religious Families</TE>
<TE>   Are Movie Fans Too</TE>
<TE>   Movie fans dominate the Sapps' Winter Springs, Fla., household.
Ellen likes romantic comedies and anything based on the work of
novelist Jane Austen. Her four children, ranging in age from 11 to
17, prefer suspense and action films. The family's biggest movie fan
is Dad, a 45-year-old marketing consultant who keeps 30 soundtrack
CDs in his car.</TE>
<TE>   "I love movies," says Brent Sapp. "I love everything about them.
I'm a filmaholic."</TE>
<TE>   But as evangelical Christians, the Sapps don't want to be put off
by what they see on the screen, including extreme violence, coarse
language, nudity and sexual situations. So before Brent and Ellen
head out for a date, or drop their teens at the neighborhood
multiplex, they consult Screenit.com, a values-based Web site that
rates and analyzes commercial films.</TE>
<TE>   Screenit.com provides a comprehensive appraisal of films, with an
overall rating on a 10-point scale. It also offers a grid listing
such categories as: alcohol/drugs, blood/gore, disrespectful/bad
attitude, guns/weapons, violence, sex/nudity and profanity. For
profanity, the exact words are listed--with asterisks for some
letters.</TE>
<TE>   "For parents who are concerned about what they and their kids see,
it's a valuable tool," he says. "It helps you to establish your own
guidelines as to what you will or will not see. It makes you make a
choice."</TE>
<TE>   Like many aspects of life in the Information Age, Christian and
morality-based movie criticism has now entered cyberspace, providing
detailed guidance to tens of millions of believers. Hollywood has
taken notice.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Bock, a consultant who helps studios such as Warner
Bros., Universal and Disney market their movies to what he calls
"religious America," acknowledges the importance of the family-values
Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   "In the aggregate," he says, "they can be very effective at
getting the word out to their audience, and they can make a
difference. They can take a marginally successful movie--like 'The
Rookie'--and make it successful."</TE>
<TE>   In 1934, the Legion of Decency, affiliated with the Catholic
Church, was formed. For decades it wielded considerable influence
among moviegoers and led to the establishment of a production code
initiated by the film producers. The Legion was abandoned in 1976 and
later replaced by a new Catholic rating system.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in 1966 the Motion Picture Assn. of America developed
its own rating system, which has been revamped over the years.
However, many parents consider the MPAA ratings too vague, despite
recent efforts by the association to make it more specific.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, previews shown in theaters don't always reflect the
true content of films, parents say.</TE>
<TE>   They also contend that the toughest calls come with movies
containing objectionable elements yet worthwhile themes, films such
as "The Count of Monte Cristo," "Black Hawk Down," "Saving Private
Ryan" and "Schindler's List." Here, the sites can be particularly
helpful in determining the "tipping point" of such a movie--when a
film's positive, redemptive theme may be so compromised by sex,
language or violence that it should be avoided.</TE>
<TE>   However, not all evangelicals think that going to commercial
movies is critical to life.</TE>
<TE>   "Any illicit sex or any profanity" in a film disqualifies it from
consideration in terms of teaching morality and decency, says Randall
Murphree, of the American Family Assn. in Mississippi.</TE>
<TE>   "We realize that's a strong stand, one that many consider
unreasonable in today's culture," says Murphree, who edits the
organization's journal. "I personally think it is not irrational at
all. I have not been inside a movie theater--except to see Christian
films--in almost seven years. What have I missed? I have missed out
on all the immoral sexual content, the use of God's name in vain and
the gratuitous violence replete in so many of today's Hollywood-style
hits."</TE>
<TE>   News of the screening sites has spread as much through prayer
groups as by the Internet. Still, the screening sites do not offer
all the answers. Some parents say there are films that may be
appropriate for their teens--but only if they are watched with their
parents, either at the theater or on video or DVD at home.</TE>
<TE>   "What Christian Web users are looking for is a means of engaging
the stories that have moved them to tears," says Robert Johnston,
professor of theology and culture at Fuller Theological Seminary in
Pasadena. "They're looking for ways to continue the dialogue beyond
the cineplex."</TE>
<TE>   Elliott, the Orlando businessman, had just such a feeling after
seeing "The Man in the Iron Mask" several years ago. He noticed "how
many biblical principles were being displayed" in the movie.</TE>
<TE>   "It struck me that I could use the things I was seeing as an
application for what I was teaching in our home fellowship," he
recalls, wondering if it would be possible "to watch a secular
project with the aim toward gaining the spiritual benefit. So I
challenged myself."</TE>
<TE>   That challenge led Elliott, 46, to write his first film review.
His take on "The Man in the Iron Mask," in turn, led to his Web site,
subtitled "Christian Parables."</TE>
<TE>   Elliott's site, which promises reviews "of biblical proportions,"
focuses on the films' themes rather than objectionable elements.</TE>
<TE>   "A film can be edifying," he says, philosophically, "even if the
filmmaker didn't intend it to be."</TE>

company.</TE>

<HD>Two Shows Take a Serious Teen Timeout</HD>
<DH>'Ricki Lake' focuses on the consequences of pregnancy;
MTV's 'Breaking It Down' looks at the marijuana trade.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SACHS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Americans rarely ask more of television than to deliver a cheap
diversion from day-to-day drudgeries, a few hours of mindless
entertainment at the push of a button.</LD>
<LD>   But every so often TV programmers insist on answering a higher
calling. They want to provide a blueprint for living, to be a
resource for enlightenment. And if you're looking for a little of
both, particularly if you are a sexually active teen pot-smoker,
Ricki Lake and Serena Altschul have just the shows for you today.</LD>
<LD>   Lake's daily 5 p.m. program on KCOP regularly takes a
youth-oriented slant on well-worn daytime-talk themes of love,
betrayal and family discord, but today's show digs deeper with a look
at the problem of teen pregnancy.</LD>
<TE>   The host says the issue took on greater poignancy when she married
and became a mother, and she has hooked up with the Washington-based
National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy to mark a monthlong push
to draw attention to the cause.</TE>
<TE>   Lake has assembled a panel of girls and women who offer cautionary
tales of having a baby out of wedlock at a young age, and there are
also film clips from past shows on the subject.</TE>
<TE>   The most affecting is the story of one woman who had left her
newborn in a trash can when she decided that she couldn't face the
pressure and the disappointment of her family. The infant was found
alive by authorities and eventually reunited with the mother, and the
woman appears today to fill in viewers on their lives since the
incident.</TE>
<TE>   Today's "Ricki Lake Show" isn't really going to tell adults
anything they don't already know, and the absence of a single
syllable from any male on the issue is also a bit curious, but the
firsthand accounts are nevertheless absorbing and may even prove
helpful to some young viewers.</TE>
<TE>   MTV's "Breaking It Down With Serena Altschul" (at 10 p.m.) is more
informative than instructional, offering a look at the massive shadow
industry of the marijuana trade.</TE>
<TE>   Altschul takes viewers to a park in Manhattan where dealers,
buyers and police engage in a strange game of cat-and-mouse; then
it's off to British Columbia, Canada, where we are told the strongest
pot in the world is grown amid the most lenient drug-law enforcement
in North America.</TE>
<TE>   In B.C, we go inside several illegal pot clubs such as Blunt Bros.
and the New Amsterdam Cafe, which are ignored by police who say they
"have better things to do" than bust folks for marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   There are a few sobering words about how the potency of today's
super-grass has resulted in skyrocketing hospitalization rates, but
no details are given about what specifically the people are being
treated for, or the long-term effect on their health.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that kind of show.</TE>
<TE>   Then it's off to the U.S.-Mexico border for a look at one of the
spots where pot streams into this country--a total of 8,000 tons a
day, we're told.</TE>
<TE>   The affable Altschul maintains a light, gee-whiz demeanor through
it all and appears to be having the time of her life during a
helicopter raid in Hawaii. And why not? It's MTV, and it's that kind
of show.</TE>
<TE>   "The Ricki Lake Show" can be seen at 5 p.m. on KCOP. "Breaking It
Down With Serena Altschul" can be seen at 10 p.m. on MTV.</TE>

<HD>It's Easy to Fall for These Schemes</HD>
<DH>'Triumph of Love,' like its manipulative heroine, ensnares
the affections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Triumph of Love" is a triumph for Long Beach's International City
Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   Like "Side Show," "Triumph of Love" is a little musical that
didn't last long on Broadway in late 1997 but appears very much alive
in the more intimate environs of a Southern California mid-size
theater in 2002.</LD>
<LD>   This "Triumph" shares a leading lady with the Colony Theatre's
recent production of "Side Show." Misty Cotton sings with clarion
power and brings plenty of engaging enthusiasm to the character of
Princess Leonide--enough to make us excuse the character's more
manipulative qualities.</LD>
<TE>   Leonide's a schemer, all right. Although she rules make-believe
"Sparta," she has fallen for the young recluse Agis (Damon Kirsche),
who lives in an "18th century Greco-French topiary," beyond the city
limits. To get closer to him, she dons men's clothes and ensnares the
affections of the two stuffy sibling philosophers who run the
topiary: a woman (Teri Ralston) who thinks Leonide is a man, and a
man (Michael Zemenick) who discovers Leonide's a woman.</TE>
<TE>   Based on an 18th century comedy by Pierre Marivaux that also has
been adapted in recent years as a nonmusical play (South Coast
Repertory did it in 1997) and as a current movie, "Triumph" endorses
the importance of the heart, as opposed to the head.</TE>
<TE>   But the musical has fun finding its way to that conventional
conclusion. The whimsy of James Magruder's libretto and Susan
Birkenhead's lyrics is in the spirit of such '60s musicals as "A
Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" and "The Apple Tree."
The music--mostly by Jeffrey Stock, but with one song apiece by Van
Dyke Parks and Michael Kosarin--is a blithe blending of operetta and
old-fashioned musical comedy.</TE>
<TE>   The show breaks no ground. But in the hands of director Jules
Aaron, it's a tonic, with an appeal that grows steadily. The best
laughs occur near the end--indeed, at the end, in a parting line by
the disappointed woman deceived about her lover's gender.</TE>
<TE>   That woman is wonderfully well played by the veteran Ralston, who
moves from pinched rationalist to girlish inamorata and part of the
way back again. She brings substantial vocal chops to her big solo,
"Serenity." Zemenick, as her male counterpart, doesn't have as much
of a voice but is equally effective as a know-it-all who discovers
how little he knows.</TE>
<TE>   Kirsche has an amusing na- ivete and a supple voice. And a trio of
second-banana comics--Lisa Richard, Wayne Scherzer and Michael
Kostroff--enliven the story's sidelines and sing a funny tribute to
henchmen of all stripes.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley Kaye's set, although not as stunning as the one for the
nonmusical "Triumph" at South Coast, suggests the friskiness of
spring, and Shon LeBlanc's costumes create a few laughs of their own.
Dan Redfeld's seven-piece band keeps the show percolating.</TE>
<TE>   "Triumph of Love," Center Theater, Long Beach Performing Arts
Center, 300 E. Ocean Blvd. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2
p.m. Ends May 26. $27-$35. (562) 436-4610. Running time: 2 hours, 30

<HD>'Muslims': A Clear Picture of Islam</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MARK SACHS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's taken decades upon decades for the global forces in play to
create a world-changing event on the scale of the Sept. 11 terrorists
attacks. Yet in one two-hour block tonight, "Muslims" manages to
bring a crystalline focus to issues of kaleidoscopic complexity,
resulting in an all-too-rare "special" that is worthy of that tag.</LD>
<LD>   The "Frontline" production (9 p.m., KCET) takes viewers on an
international tour of the religion's strongholds in places such as
Egypt, Iran, Malaysia, Nigeria and Turkey, showing the myriad
gradations and interpretations that exist, helping to shatter the
monolithic mask that Islam wears for many here in the West.</LD>
<LD>   "With the events of Sept. 11," says Nigerian attorney Muzzammil
Hanga, "the West is frantically trying to establish two worlds--the
forward-looking Western world and backward, uncivilized Islamic
world."</LD>
<TE>   But the program also outlines the conflicts that exist within many
of the countries between Muslim traditionalists and those in the
religion who favor more personal freedom and equality between the
sexes.</TE>
<TE>   "We found that it is not Islam that discriminates against women,"
says feminist activist Zainah Anwar in Malaysia. "It is not the
verses in the Koran, it is the way that these verses have been
interpreted by men living in patriarchal societies who wish to
maintain their dominance, and their superiority and control over
women."</TE>
<TE>   In the second hour, the focus shifts from the taxis festooned with
images of Osama bin Laden in Nigeria to the cars and homes in the
U.S. draped in American flags, and what the post-9/11 political
climate means to Muslims here.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at Muslims in the U.S. as being in a very unique position
to be able to produce a model for how Islam can be lived [alongside]
other religions," says an Illinois man, perhaps echoing the hopes of
all of us.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Slick, sleek and genteelly erotic, "Unfaithful" is a high-gloss
morality play from the Architectural Digest School of Infidelity,
where the handsome furnishings arouse as much emotion as the
protagonists' tangled lives. With one key exception.</LD>
<LD>   Diane Lane, an actress since she was 6 and in movies from "A
Little Romance" through "A Walk on the Moon" since she was 12, gives
her most completely realized performance as the suburban goddess who
betrays husband Richard Gere with paramour Olivier Martinez. Lane's
finely emotional presentation is the film's convincer, one of the few
things about it that feel recognizably real.</LD>
<LD>   Otherwise "Unfaithful's" message of "you stray, you pay,"
efficiently delivered though it is by director Adrian Lyne and
screenwriters Alvin Sargent and William Broyles Jr., is as familiar
to modern audiences as miracle plays like "Everyman" and "Wakefield
Mysteries" were to medieval ones. Audiences went to those dramas, as
we go to this one, not to be surprised but to exult in the familiar,
to see comforting morals played out again and again.</LD>
<TE>   In this case it means watching prosperous beautiful people have
glamorous sex and irredeemably mess up their lives in the process,
proving once again, as one of the characters emphatically states, "it
will end disastrously. They always end disastrously." Lyne, the
veteran of "Fatal Attraction," "91/2 Weeks," "Indecent Proposal" and
"Lolita," is one of the movies' last moralists, an expert at using
taste and decorum to elevate soap opera material. His is the world of
amour fou, mad love, where people are so rip-their-clothes-off crazy
for each other we never have to expend the effort to wonder exactly
what the attraction is.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly Constance Sumner (Lane) and her husband Edward (Gere)
seem like a classic loving couple who have it all, down to a swell
house in White Plains, a cute dog and an even cuter kid (the
wonderfully solemn Erik Per Sullivan of "The Cider House Rules,"
"Wendigo" and TV's "Malcolm in the Middle.") But, on the other hand,
having been married for 11 years, the Sumners are well past the
having-hot-sex-in-restaurant-restrooms stage of their relationship
(if they ever had that stage in the first place.) The badly named
Constance's life has grown comfortable. Maybe too comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   Shopping in Manhattan's SoHo on one of the windiest days in movie
history, Constance literally gets blown into Paul Martel (French
actor Martinez), quite possibly the sexiest antiquarian book dealer
in the entire United States. Fashionably unshaven, with a shock of
black hair, an artistic scarf and a come-hither look, Paul is the
picture of sexy insouciance, the kind of casually hip guy who
probably knew who soundtrack musician Ali Farke Toure was even before
he partnered with Ry Cooder.</TE>
<TE>   The sidewalk collision has badly scraped Constance's knees, and
Paul invites her up to his loft for a quick bandage. "I am not an ax
murderer," he says in his best Left Bank accent. "I promise."</TE>
<TE>   Ever the practiced seducer, Paul offers his guest hot tea and a
few lines from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam: "Be happy for this
moment. This moment is your life." Knowing a come-on when she hears
it, Constance hastily retreats to White Plains, where husband
Edward's idea of excitement is wearing his sweaters inside out and
calling their son "kiddo."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly--there would- n't be any film if she
could--Constance can'`t get the more dashing Paul out of her mind.
Soon she is finding reasons to sneak into the city, and though she
fears having an affair will be a mistake, Paul trumps her by
insisting there is no such thing. "There is what you do and what you
don't do." You don't have to have seen Claude Chabrol's classic "La
Femme Infidele," the basis for the current venture, to know how this
is going to turn out.</TE>
<TE>   Though it is difficult to take "Unfaithful" as seriously as it
takes itself, on its own terms it's quite well done. A director for
more than 20 years, Lyne practically invented R-rated sexual
encounters; Sargent and Broyles are top-flight writers; and Martinez
and Gere, who 20 years ago might have played the Martinez role
himself, do everything right, albeit in a bloodless kind of way.</TE>
<TE>   The only performer who manages to get inside her character is
Lane. Whether it's her initial half-distrustful tentativeness, her
later sensual abandon or her never-ending ambivalence, Lane's
Constance seems to be actually living the role in a way no one else
matches, a way we can all connect to. Her reality is the only thing
that makes this artificial world worth inhabiting.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for sexuality, language and a scene of violence.
Times guidelines: The sexuality is of the late-night cable TV
variety.</TE>

<HD>A Sweeps Week Win for NBC</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>NBC's nostalgic 75th anniversary special and the network's current
lineup of series heavyweights teamed to provide NBC with a commanding
ratings win during the first full week of this month's sweeps, based
on viewing estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to stellar numbers for the three-hour-plus anniversary
show, NBC's "Third Watch" benefited from an "ER" crossover to deliver
that drama's highest rating since its premiere in 1999. The network
also posted better-than-usual Saturday results with the movie "Men in
Black" and respectable numbers for "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno"
and Bob Hope prime-time specials.</LD>
<LD>   Every major network except NBC was down more than 10% compared
with the same week last year, with ABC (falling 20%) posting the
steepest decline. The network's woes are demonstrated by the fact
that its most-watched program last week, "The Practice," ranked No.
27 overall.</LD>
<TE>   CBS was again led by "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation," which
ranked as TV's most-watched program for the eighth time in 32 weeks
this season. The network also received a boost last Tuesday from the
concluding half of "Living With the Dead."</TE>

<LD>In the spirit of today's coffeehouses, here are recipes to serve if
you have friends over for coffee--or tea. Be sure to have a bowl of
strawberries or finger-cut pineapple or melon to balance the mix. The
muffins and cake would also enhance a brunch menu.</LD>
<LD>   I like to warm up the muffins and cake in the microwave just
before serving. Use 10% power and check every 20 seconds (by touching
them) so that they are not overheated.</LD>
<LD>   Don't forget the milk and lemon wedges for tea drinkers when
setting the table.</LD>

<LD>Ocean liners are known for putting on a pretty good spread. This has
to do with modern refrigeration and the growing prosperity, and
therefore growing pickiness, of travelers, but a lot of it is simply
a consequence of the steam engine. Back in the days of sailing ships
(which were much smaller than modern liners to begin with), ocean
travel was at the mercy of the winds, so most fresh foods were out of
the question.</LD>
<LD>   Travelers got around it as best they could. A ship of any size
would include a sort of miniature barnyard--a couple of chickens and
maybe a goose for their eggs, a goat for its milk, sometimes a cow or
sheep--that could also mean fresh meat for special occasions.
Connoisseurs could grow their own herbs in pots. But everything else
had to be packed to keep indefinitely.</LD>
<LD>   Old cookbooks often give advice on what the passenger should bring
along on a sea voyage. Here are some typical tips for varying the
basic diet of hardtack, beans and salt beef:</LD>
<TE>   * Ham: Pack in charcoal to keep it from the rats and damp.</TE>
<TE>   * Goose, sausages, veal: Cook and pack in a cask with enough
melted butter or fat to cover by several inches. The butter or fat
would eventually see use in the galley, of course.</TE>
<TE>   * Tripe: Boil and barrel with vinegar. This vinegar would probably
get used in cooking too, for good or ill.</TE>
<TE>   * Fish: Salt a couple of hours, fry brown and barrel up with oil.</TE>
<TE>   * Root vegetables and mushrooms: Dry in a slow oven. Mushroom
powder would be useful for giving some semblance of flavor to
gravies.</TE>

<HD>Inventing a New Fruit</HD>

<AU>EMILY GREEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New Zealand botanists who run the Bay of Plenty fruit breeding
station HortResearch view the improvement of kiwifruit as nothing
short of a patriotic duty. Their industry handbook, "Kiwifruit:
Science and Management," even invokes America's most horticultural
president, Thomas Jefferson, declaring, "The greatest service which
can be rendered any country is to add an useful plant to its
culture."</LD>
<LD>   Since 1976, it has been the fondest wish of HortResearch breeder
Russell Lowe to provide New Zealand with a useful new kiwifruit. Like
all breeders of his generation, he lived in the shadow of the great
fruit breeder Hayward Wright, who perfected the classic green
kiwifruit, Actinidia deliciosa, for market.</LD>
<LD>   But as early as 1976, Lowe wondered about the potential of another
species of kiwifruit, the golden-fleshed Actinidia chinensis. In
contrast to the tart, green A. deliciosa, this is unabashedly sweet,
with golden and sometimes even red flesh.</LD>
<TE>   In 1987, Lowe began propagating seedlings, then crossbreeding
them. He needed a fruit that packed, stored and shipped well. Most of
all, it needed to taste good--six months after harvest, halfway
around the world from where it was grown. After what Lowe estimates
were "hundreds and hundreds" of rejects, in 1992 he had a sweet, gold
contender, with an odd little beak on the end.</TE>
<TE>   The next step was market research. Backed by a stricken kiwifruit
industry, Lowe began scouting Bay of Plenty kiwi orchards for the
best test sites. "I didn't want hobbyists with a dirty little corner
of the orchard to spare," says Lowe.</TE>
<TE>   After several years of testing, refining and perfecting the fruit,
the verdict was in: Lowe had done it. New Zealand had a
yellow-fleshed fruit that matured early, had the sweetness of a mango
and the novelty value of a mangosteen. New Zealand would pin its
hopes on Lowe's new fruit.</TE>
<TE>   This time the former Kiwifruit, now Zespri, Marketing Board not
only sewed up the plant variety rights, it patented the trade name:
Zespri Gold. The cultivar's more technical name, Hort 16a, comes from
the plot position in Lowe's test orchard.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the green Hayward, so dubbed in honor of Hayward Wright,
Lowe's cultivar will never bear his name. It will always be either
Zespri Gold or Hort 16a. "We made it deliberately obscure and boring
so there was no conflict with the commercial name of Zespri," says
Murray Judd, Lowe's boss at HortResearch.</TE>
<TE>   But go back to the HortResearch reference book and there is no
mistaking the pleasure and pride that he and Lowe take in Hort 16a.
It brings to mind something else Jefferson wrote about the importance
of introducing a useful new fruit: "One service of this kind rendered
to a nation is worth more to them than all the victories of the most
splendid pages of their history and becomes a source of exalted
pleasure to those who have been instrumental to it."</TE>

<DH>'One size fits all' is no way to cook.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is a restaurant my family goes to quite often that serves
wonderful short ribs, makes a killer hamburger and has a pot pie that
will make you fall to your knees. Unfortunately, they only know one
way to cook a vegetable--boiled, and quite nearly to death. While we
recognize that different cuts of meat require different cooking
approaches, sometimes it seems that vegetables are relegated to
one-size-fits-all status.</LD>
<LD>   So while we considerately braise tough cuts of meat to make them
soft and luscious, fry a hamburger for a crisp crust and juicy
interior, and gently poach chicken to keep it from becoming dry and
stringy, we carelessly cook vegetables as if they were afterthoughts.</LD>
<LD>   That occurred to me one recent weekend while I was preparing this
vegetable stew. At the market I had picked up some
artichokes--they're at the peak of their season--and paired them with
freshly dug little boiling potatoes. To shift the balance from sweet
to earthy, I threw in some brown mushrooms. The idea--after a weekend
of good eating--was to make a vegetable stew that would be filling
enough for a light dinner.</LD>
<TE>   I started by steaming the potatoes. You can boil them if you like,
but I find that the water they absorb during the boiling process
dilutes the flavor somewhat. Steaming leaves the taste bright and
intense. I braised the artichokes, cooking them with oil and just a
bit of water. Again, the goal is intensity--the final cooking over
high heat with the lid off evaporates all the water so the vegetables
are glazed in an artichoke-olive oil syrup. Finally, I browned the
mushrooms over high heat in just a little oil, cooking off their
moisture (this not only intensifies the flavor but prevents the stew
from becoming a murky brown mess from mushroom juices).</TE>
<TE>   Different vegetables demand different approaches. Plain sauteing,
without any added liquid, only works for vegetables that contain a
lot of water, like mushrooms. It takes heat and moisture to break
down the tough cellulose most vegetables are made of. (You were
wondering why those carrots stayed so hard no matter how long you
cooked them.)</TE>
<TE>   Finally, while you can steam almost anything, that doesn't mean
it's always the best way to cook it. Plain steamed vegetables by
themselves seem like diet food, more penance than pleasure. They're
best used in combination with other things--either served with some
sort of sauce or mixed into a more complicated dish.</TE>
<TE>   Though I love to braise vegetables such as artichokes, braising
doesn't work very well with potatoes. They contain so much starch
that it clouds the glaze and sticks to the bottom of the pan. And it
certainly wouldn't work for mushrooms.</TE>
<TE>   That's three widely varied cooking processes working toward a
single goal. When I brought the artichokes, potatoes and mushrooms
together, all that was necessary was one final fillip--shards of
salty, creamy pecorino Romano cheese to melt gradually over the top
of each plate.</TE>
<TE>   Artichokes can be somewhat tricky to cook. They contain a chemical
compound called cynarin, which is a very bad thing if you're trying
to pair them with wine, but a good thing if you're combining them
with anything else.</TE>
<TE>   Cynarin has the unusual effect of making everything taste sweeter.
Take a bite of cooked artichoke and then sip some water. Notice the
sweetness? You probably also notice that it is not necessarily a
pleasant taste. It seems more like the artificial chemical sweetness
you get from aspartame than the full, rounded flavor you get from
naturally occurring sugars. You can just imagine what that will do to
the taste of a glass of wine. Even the best will have that
distinctive warm Fresca finish.</TE>
<TE>   The Italians, with their genius for making something from nothing
(or in this case, less than nothing), have developed an after-dinner
drink from the artichoke, called Cynar. It is black as bile and just
about as bitter. Yet once you get over the initial shock, it is oddly
pleasing. Somehow it's just the thing to sip after a big dinner.</TE>
<TE>   For this reason, the Italians--who are just as susceptible to
food-health lunacy as anyone--have classed it as a digestivo, or
digestive drink. They believe that when you sip it, it tunes up your
tummy in much the same way a can of STP cleans up a dirty car engine
(in fact, they are of somewhat similar color and texture). There is
some scientific evidence, though far from conclusive, to suggest this
may actually work. Cynarin does promote the secretion of bile, which
might aid in digestion.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever effect cynarin has or doesn't have on your stomach, it
does make for some nice dishes. I like to pair artichokes with foods
that already have a subtle sweetness--meats such as pork and fish,
and vegetables like potatoes and fava beans. This way that added note
fits so naturally that you hardly notice it.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of a definite sweetening, the effect is more of a
heightening of flavors. Dishes with artichokes are rarely subtle.
They're big, noisy, brass band food. Throw in as much garlic as you
like, maybe even capers and anchovies too. Rosemary? No problem. And
some mint, some crushed red pepper flakes ... what else? Salty
cheese? Why not?</TE>
<TE>   Just so long as you give the vegetables their proper respect.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Artichoke Stew With Pecorino Romano</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 40 minutes * Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   To clean the artichokes, pull off the tough outer leaves until you
reach the pale green inner leaves. Cut off the top 1/3 of the tips.
Using a paring knife, peel the dark skin from the base and stems.
Finally, cut the artichokes into lengthwise quarters and drop them
into a bowl full of acidulated water (water with the juice of 1/2
lemon added). This will keep them from turning black. If you're using
large artichokes, follow the same steps, but after you've trimmed the
tops, scoop out the hairy chokes (a grapefruit spoon works well).
Slice the hearts into 1/2-inch pieces.</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 pounds small boiling potatoes, cut into small bite-size
pieces</TE>
<TE>   2 pounds medium artichokes, cleaned and cut up, about 4 artichokes</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup olive oil, divided</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup water</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   2 cloves garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes</TE>
<TE>   2 sprigs fresh thyme</TE>
<TE>   1 sprig fresh rosemary</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound cremini mushrooms, cut into small bite-size pieces</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons minced fresh mint</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons chopped green olives</TE>
<TE>   1 ounce pecorino Romano cheese</TE>
<TE>   Steam the potatoes over rapidly boiling water in a tightly covered
pan just until tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and set
aside.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the artichokes, 3 tablespoons of the olive oil, the water,
1/2 teaspoon of salt, garlic, red pepper flakes, thyme and rosemary
in a large skillet. Cover tightly and place over high heat. Cook
until the artichokes are just tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the lid
and continue cooking over high heat until all the liquid has
evaporated and the artichokes begin to make a sizzling sound from
frying in the oil. Stir frequently to keep the artichokes from
sticking. Add the potatoes and reduce the heat to low.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive
oil over high heat. When very hot, add the mushrooms and cook,
tossing frequently, until they have given up their liquid and are
beginning to brown, 3 to 5 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Add the mushrooms to the potatoes and artichokes and stir in the
mint and the olives. Season to taste with salt. Remove the thyme and
rosemary sprigs. Divide the stew evenly among 6 pasta plates or
shallow bowls and garnish with the cheese by using a vegetable peeler
to shave off thin strips over each bowl. Serve immediately</TE>

<HD>Kiwi, Act II</HD>
<DH>New Zealand tries to reclaim its national fruit in a world
now full of competitors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY GREEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAY OF PLENTY, New Zealand</DL>
<LD>A three-story-high billboard of a hairy berry announces that this is
kiwifruit country. Sure enough, driving into the temperate rim of
farmland surrounding the Bay of Plenty, the country's pine forests,
dairy farms and sheep holdings give way to a crazy quilt of orchards.
Some 2,100 different holdings, covering 24,000 acres, are screened
off from each other by towering cypress windbreaks.</LD>
<LD>   Kiwifruit is not so much big here as mythic. The seeds that a
traveling evangelist brought back from China in 1904 have grown into
a $350-million crop, New Zealand's No. 1 horticultural commodity.
Pass through an airport anywhere in the country, and the gift shops
will be stacked with kiwifruit jam, kiwifruit chutney, kiwifruit
jellies, chocolate-covered kiwifruit and sun-dried kiwifruit. The
name comes from "kiwi," the Maori name for a small, flightless bird
but is also synonymous with New Zealanders themselves. Just as
Britons are "limeys," New Zealanders are "kiwis."</LD>
<LD>   Why then are New Zealanders now insisting that their
kiwifruit--the same familiar green-fleshed berry that they worked so
hard to popularize--must be labeled with the computer-generated
neologism Zespri?</LD>
<TE>   The brand-name kiwifruit, they say, has become generic. In the
first century spent perfecting the kiwifruit, New Zealand never
patented its best-selling fruit variety or copyrighted the brand
name. Since 1931 in the United States and 1970 worldwide, new
varieties of fruit have commonly been patented, guaranteeing the
breeders who develop them royalties to repay the years, even decades,
of scientific trials that it takes to come up with a winner.</TE>
<TE>   Even without a patent, the trademark "kiwifruit," if copyrighted,
could have become the same kind of powerful marketing tool for New
Zealand fruit growers that the term Xerox is for the U.S. photocopier
company.</TE>
<TE>   With the fruit type and its trade name left unprotected, Italy,
Chile, France, Greece, China, Japan and the U.S. all started planting
vines taken from New Zealand and calling the fruit "kiwifruit." By
1990 kiwifruit was as likely to come from Emilia-Romagna as the Bay
of Plenty. By 1992 the glut was such that the market collapsed and
the New Zealand kiwifruit industry had gone broke.</TE>
<TE>   It was the cruelest of indignities. New Zealand was beaten at its
own game, by its own fruit, bearing its own name.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of curling up and dying, New Zealand rebounded. As
harvest approaches this month, New Zealand has not only a new name
but a new type of fruit, a mango-sweet yellow variety, Zespri Gold.
It wants its markets back, and no sacrifice, no fizzy brand name, no
gimmick is too painful or too silly.</TE>
<TE>   It's too early to say whether it will work. In the 1960s,
California was the first successful export market for New Zealand
kiwifruit. We are, say Zespri's marketing department, "early
adapters." But so far we haven't exactly adapted Zespri Gold. Since
its release in 2000, only a trickle of the fruit has arrived. This
summer, however, there are almost 3,000 tons of gold fruit headed for
U.S. supermarkets. To sell it, we can expect Zespri-sponsored chefs
on TV, Zespri demonstrators in supermarkets, Zespri recipes in
women's magazines ... in short, a full-court Zespri press.</TE>
<TE>   Even if some of the stunts sound silly, New Zealand's competitors
here in the U.S. cautiously applaud the antics. Behind the stunts,
they say, New Zealand is doing state-of-the-art fruit breeding. When
it comes to marketing the finished fruit as anything from cocktail
ingredient to potential cancer cure, branding fruit is rarely an
exercise in dignity. Witness the Chiquita banana lady.</TE>
<TE>   Taming the Wild Berry</TE>
<TE>   To appreciate just how important kiwifruit is to New Zealand, it
helps to understand how difficult it is to domesticate a wild fruit
in the first place. Farming is not foraging. Cultivated fruits must
grow consistently, have disease and pest resistance, taste good, look
good, ship well and store well.</TE>
<TE>   Only four major fruits and nuts were successfully domesticated in
the 20th century. The U.S. Department of Agriculture was responsible
for three of them: avocados, macadamia nuts and blueberries. New
Zealand, a country the size of Colorado, got the fourth: the
kiwifruit.</TE>
<TE>   It might have been four out of four for the U.S., had early
California growers had a better understanding of the kiwifruit's
sexual proclivities. Unlike many plants, which are self-pollinating,
kiwifruit is dioecious, meaning the plants come in sexes, and female
plants must be fertilized with pollen from a male to bear fruit.</TE>
<TE>   When kiwifruit, known by the Chinese name of yang tao, was first
sent from China to the U.S. in 1904, the USDA Plant Introduction
Station at Chico, Calif., produced a viable combination of male and
female vines. But when seeds were planted from these, the more than
1,300 seedlings then sent out for field trials were almost all
male--all show, no fruit. In spite of the warmest recommendations for
the plant out of China, the USDA wrote it off as an ornamental
curiosity.</TE>
<TE>   But at the same time, a teacher and evangelist by the name of
Isabel Fraser, who had been working in China, brought yang tao seeds
back to New Zealand. She gave them to neighbors who, ironically, had
learned orchard management in California. They enjoyed a more
fruitful mix of sexes. By the 1920s, what was known as the "Chinese
gooseberry" was a sensation in New Zealand's garden catalogs.</TE>
<TE>   It bore no relation to European gooseberries, other than a faint
similarity in taste. But for the next 30 years, the name stuck. The
region that would prove the most amenable to kiwifruit production was
around the Bay of Plenty. The area, known by the Maori name Te Puke
(pronounced tuh pookie), had almost all the things kiwifruit needed:
mild climate, consistent rainfall, rich volcanic soil, superb
drainage and a harbor with plenty of room for warehouses and fruit
freighters.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, like the Californians, Te Puke's farmers had trouble
sexing the vines. Nurserymen drove through the region selling lots of
five seedlings off the backs of trucks, the logic being that if a
farmer planted enough vines, odds were decent that a female would be
among them.</TE>
<TE>   Auckland-based nurseryman Hayward Wright intervened. To ensure
viable orchards, he popularized the practice of using scion wood, or
grafts, so farmers could know exactly what sex and variety of vine
they were splicing onto rootstock. Wright was also famous for his
ability to select the best vine stock before the plants bore fruit.</TE>
<TE>   "Quality in leaf," he believed, "reflects quality in fruit."
Wright grew dozens of seedlings, selected from among them and
crossbred kiwifruit vines until he had the variety we now know.</TE>
<TE>   The descriptions he left behind betray a lip-smacking pleasure in
the green-fleshed berry that he bred. They can be "eaten with sugar
or cream in fruit salads, pies, or made into jam or jelly," he wrote.
He particularly liked seeing them in "high-class fruit shops" and
finding rings of kiwifruit on cakes, "the flavor imparted being very
suitable for such a purpose."</TE>
<TE>   During his lifetime, his cultivar went under many names, including
Wright's Large Oval and Wright's Giant. But when he died in 1959, the
New Zealand ministry of agriculture renamed it the Hayward Chinese
Gooseberry. The supremacy of Hayward was guaranteed when research
showed it could spend months in cold storage with little discernible
detriment to the quality of the fruit.</TE>
<TE>   This was a fruit for export.</TE>
<TE>   Trades and Trademarks</TE>
<TE>   Though the first U.S. laws enabling horticulturalists to protect
plant variety rights came into force in the 1930s, New Zealand did
not have any such laws until 1987. So when New Zealand began
exporting the fruit in the 1950s, the plant was in the public domain.</TE>
<TE>   The first 100 cases of Hayward Chinese Gooseberries arrived in San
Francisco in 1959. Apocryphal stories abound that Americans balked at
what they saw as a somehow communist fruit. In fact, it was a plant
health scare, not a red scare, that caused the Chinese gooseberry
problems. Real gooseberries are prone to a fungus called anthracnose.</TE>
<TE>   So the Auckland fruit packers Turners &amp; Growers floated the
alternate term "melonette." That flopped when the New Zealanders came
to appreciate the impact of the import tariffs on real melons. It
took a Californian, the fruit importer N.L. Sondag, to ask for a
short Maori name that quickly connoted New Zealand and for Turners &amp;
Growers to respond with the suggestion "kiwi."</TE>
<TE>   By 1964, "kiwi berries" were on special offer from the
Oregon-based Harry and David's Fruit of the Month Club. "You had
better order now," warned the brochure, "they're scarcer than screen
doors on submarines." Perhaps most important in popularizing the
fruit in the U.S. was Los Angeles fruit trader Frieda Caplan of
Frieda's Inc. Not only did she champion the import of New Zealand
kiwifruit, but when the first California crop bore fruit in 1970, she
bought every last berry.</TE>
<TE>   As the name caught on, New Zealanders didn't think to copyright
the trademark name "kiwifruit." Even if it hadn't been feasible to
license the plant variety rights for the Hayward in the early 1930s,
it would have been possible to patent the name kiwifruit as it caught
on in the early '60s. The United Fruit Co. had registered the
Chiquita banana trademark as early as 1947, three years after
launching it with the Miss Chiquita character and her famous jingle.</TE>
<TE>   Briefly the buzz in California was that kiwifruit was the new
"glamour" crop and the "fruit of the future." Growers here began to
experiment with different varieties, and all manner of kiwifruit now
appear in farmers markets.</TE>
<TE>   But while California started the international fashion for
kiwifruit, Europe made it a craze. Sliced kiwifruit became a
signature garnish of nouvelle cuisine. For pastry chefs, it became
the required topping for cream tarts. The French, likening the whole
fruit to mice dangling from vines, named it "souris vegetales" or
"vegetable mice." Italians, noting that the fruit had twice the
vitamin C content of an orange, dubbed it "frutto della salute" or
"health fruit." By the 1980s, 75% of New Zealand's exports went to
Europe, and the Europeans themselves were madly planting Hayward
vines.</TE>
<TE>   Around Te Puke, orchards were going in so fast that production
more than doubled in four years. In 1986, New Zealand was exporting
just more than 100,000 tons. By 1990, this had jumped to 252,000
tons. Robert Martin, market access manager for Zespri, refers to the
frenzy as "that interesting time."</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, kiwifruit was bringing growers in excess of $1,400 per
ton. By 1987, Martin says, the price per ton had dropped to about
$1,000, and in 1988 to more like $700. "That year we decided that the
industry couldn't afford a competitive market system," he says. "We
were going to compete each other out of business."</TE>
<TE>   In November 1989 the growers voted to consolidate the export
business previously split among seven competing businesses into a
"single desk" monopoly, and the move was legalized by an act of
parliament. But as New Zealand eliminated internal competition,
external competition became ferocious. Bumper Italian kiwifruit
crops, planted with the help of European Union subsidies, began
bearing fruit in the late 1980s. Italy's kiwifruit crop increased
more than 75% in 1989 alone. In 1990 Italy outstripped New Zealand in
production.</TE>
<TE>   By 1991, says Martin, the two countries were in court, embroiled
in more than 107 lawsuits, with the Italians trying to block imports
from New Zealand by alleging that the antipodean fruit carried excess
pesticide residues.</TE>
<TE>   By 1992, France, Portugal, Chile and Japan had also steamed into
the international kiwifruit business, and the global fruit market
crashed. "We couldn't give kiwifruit away," says Martin. New Zealand
was left with 40,000 tons of kiwifruit sitting on pallets around the
world. The "single desk" had already advanced growers payment at a
rate of roughly $500 a ton. When the price fell to $350, "we couldn't
even pay back the advance," says Martin. "We were technically
bankrupt."</TE>
<TE>   Reinventing Kiwifruit</TE>
<TE>   The chairman of the Kiwifruit Marketing Board resigned. The debt
was restructured. New planting was capped. Existing orchards were
thinned. Orchard ownership fell from 3,500 holdings to 2,500.
Production dropped by a fifth. The New Zealanders decided there was
only thing to do: rename the national fruit, the marketing board, the
whole industry with one word.</TE>
<TE>   They wanted an equivalent of Kodak for kiwifruit, a word that was
pronounceable in every language, says Martin, and that "didn't mean
anything rude in any of them." He can't remember the other contenders
on a computer-generated list. Just the winner, just Zespri. It
connotes zest and Zealand and sprightliness.</TE>
<TE>   The Hayward kiwifruit, darling of pastry chefs, became Zespri
Green, the sports fruit. Advertisements for it show models
stretching, cycling, leaping, even performing aerobics in fruit
warehouses. All very perky, but behind the scenes, on a much more
fundamental level, New Zealand growers were reforming crop husbandry.</TE>
<TE>   After Italian allegations of pesticide regulation, the New
Zealanders didn't embark on a trade war; they reformed orchard
management. Hedgerows were ripped out to aerate damp orchards and cut
fungus problems. Prophylactic spraying was stopped to promote
beneficial insects. Along with a cleaner conventional product, Zespri
now markets New Zealand's organic kiwifruit, about 5% of the national
crop.</TE>
<TE>   But for the marketing ploy to work, the new name needed a new
fruit. Handily, New Zealand's fruit breeders came up with just that,
a gold species that was sufficiently unique to be trademarked a
Zespri Gold and to have the plant variety rights registered. Zespri
Gold constitutes 5% of New Zealand's kiwifruit crop and is now being
planted abroad by New Zealand's old competitors in the green market,
not least by Italy.</TE>
<TE>   But this time, says Zespri lawyer David Lazarus, Italy will have
to pay for New Zealand's farm technology. Lazarus has licensed
Italian farmers to grow 500 acres of the new gold kiwifruit to Zespri
standards, to be sold under a Zespri label. A quirk in Italian law
makes New Zealanders "virtual owners" of the farms. It now means that
a product of New Zealand might be grown in Italy. Or many other
countries. Similar licensing arrangements are being made in France,
Japan and the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Horsfall, president of the California Kiwifruit Commission,
is unfazed by the incursion here, which will involve perhaps 1,000
acres and produce fruit in a couple of years. He even praises Zespri
strategy, if cautiously. "It's an attempt to brand their product," he
says. "They were instrumental in introducing kiwifruit to the world
and instrumental in getting us started. They feel they have a unique
position within the category and want to capitalize on it.</TE>
<TE>   "But whether it works or not is still an open question. There's
Chiquita bananas, Sun-Maid raisins, Sunkist oranges," he says,
reeling off brand names, "but by and large, that kind of brand
recognition is fairly rare in produce."</TE>
<TE>   For a competitor, Horsfall has surprisingly genial relations with
Zespri. But then, kiwifruit has never been a major crop here, even
though California was the first place to embrace it. The state
produces about 30,000 tons of kiwifruit, compared with New Zealand's
210,000 tons and Italy's 350,000.</TE>
<TE>   To Horsfall, the problem is not foreign competition, not even
overproduction, but underconsumption. Currently Americans eat only
half a pound of kiwifruit a year. "If we're going to see some better
times returning," he says, "we're going to have to get consumers
eating them as an everyday fruit, like an apple. The biggest thing
that stops people is that it's just a pain to get past the skin."</TE>
<TE>   Back in Te Puke, breeders are hard at work trying to develop a
kiwifruit that can be peeled by hand. Meanwhile, with the arrival of
our first decent crop of his new gold fruit, expect a small tsunami
of spin: kids in gold VWs they call Zespri-mobiles. Chefs mixing
Zespri Bellinis. Zespri scoops, half knife and half spoon, called
"spifes."</TE>
<TE>   Ah, and health claims. It no longer seems good enough that
kiwifruit has twice the vitamin C of an orange and the motility
benefits of bran. As Zespri tells it, its New Age kiwifruit fights
heart disease, is good for vision and, hey ho, what's this shiny
leaflet? It is even, it seems, a sex aid. "Zespri Kiwifruit's unusual
amino acid characteristics provide a source of arginine, which is a
vasodilator...."</TE>

<LD>Quark is a traditional German fresh cheese with the look and
consistency of yogurt. Its flavor is mild and on the tangy side. Try
substituting quark for yogurt in some of your favorite recipes to
lower the calories, carbohydrates and sugar.</LD>
<LD>   Compared with nonfat yogurt, quark has 70 calories per half cup
while yogurt can have as many as 130 calories. It is also
considerably lower in carbohydrates and sugar. A half-cup has 4 grams
of carbohydrates and 2 grams of sugar, while nonfat yogurt has about
17 grams of carbohydrates and 17 grams of sugar.</LD>
<LD>   Add some grated horseradish to quark for a little zest. This
mixture, while good on crostini, would also be good spooned over
baked potatoes.</LD>

<LD>The Hollywood farmers market celebrated its 11th anniversary Sunday
with many delights and surprises. Half a dozen vendors had cherries,
of which the best were large, low-acid Brooks from Murray Farms of
Arvin, the earliest growing area in California. The stand also had
Royal Rainier (yellow with a pink blush), Tulare and Flavor Giant,
all better than the prevailing Burlats.</LD>
<LD>   Mark Silber of Grenada Hills' Papaya Tree Nursery made one of his
occasional appearances, offering lusciously juicy and sweet Big Jim
loquats, small but exquisite Oroblancos and pods of Santa Fe carob,
once touted as a major crop for California but now found mostly in
health-food stores as a chocolate substitute. His parents, David and
Tina, brought an exotic display featuring miracle fruit (eat one and
the sourest lemon tastes sweet), yellow pitahaya (a juicy and
mild-flavored spineless cactus pear), outlandish, squid-shaped
Buddha's Hand citron and jaboticaba, a grape-like Brazilian fruit
with a spicy hint of cinnamon.</LD>
<LD>   Laura Ramirez had excellent Pinkerton, Fuerte and Hass avocados,
along with beautiful Eureka lemons and unusual egg-shaped, deeply
blushed Spanish sanguinelli blood oranges. From Nipomo, the Pudwill
stand brought the first blueberries and raspberries of their season,
and blackberries.</LD>
<TE>   Dede and Jon Thogmartin of Colton had their unusual agretti,
slender, tubular greens with a mineraly flavor reminiscent of beet
leaves and chard.</TE>
<TE>   Customers were thrilled to see goat cheese vendor Emily Thompson
back. She makes fabulous cheeses near Ojai using milk from goats
pastured in Chino. Having been out of the markets for almost two
years, she resumed cheese-making just last week and had fresh La
Bastide roundels, plain or rolled in cracked pepper, dill or herbes
de Provence, and boutons de culotte ("trouser buttons") marinated in
olive oil with herbs.</TE>

<LD>Mondays can be bad enough without hearing, "What's for dinner?" But
with a pizza crust mix you can have a fast and freshly baked pizza
without breaking a sweat.</LD>
<LD>   Here are a couple of pizza ideas using toppings such as tomatoes,
spinach and prosciutto. Or get creative and use whatever's in your
refrigerator.</LD>
<LD>   If you have kids, a simple salad with ranch dressing rounds out
the meal. Or toss spring greens with vinaigrette. Ice cream is a must
for dessert.</LD>

<TE>   Look for packages of pizza crust mix in the baking aisle.</TE>
<TE>   2 (6 1/2-ounce) packages pizza crust mix</TE>
<TE>   Flour, for rolling</TE>
<TE>   2 plum tomatoes, thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced, divided</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup thinly sliced basil</TE>
<TE>   4 cups young spinach leaves, loosely packed</TE>
<TE>   1/4 pound thinly sliced prosciutto, cut into thin strips</TE>
<TE>   1 cup grated mozzarella</TE>
<TE>   1 cup grated Parmesan</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 450 degrees. Lightly grease 2 jellyroll pans.</TE>
<TE>   Prepare the crust mix according to package directions, combining
both in one bowl. Divide the dough in half and roll out each half on
a lightly floured surface to fit the pans. Place the dough on the
pans, patting it down.</TE>
<TE>   For the tomato pizza, cover one crust with the tomato slices, then
scatter half of the garlic over the tomatoes. Top with the basil. Set
aside.</TE>
<TE>   For the prosciutto pizza, spread the spinach leaves over the
second crust, then scatter the remaining garlic over the spinach. Top
with the prosciutto.</TE>
<TE>   Top each pizza with half of the mozzarella and half of the
Parmesan. Grind pepper over each pizza.</TE>
<TE>   Bake the pizzas until the cheese has melted and is bubbling and
lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Cut into pieces and serve.</TE>

<LD>Spice rubs, along with marinades and pastes, are a great way to bring
big flavors to grilled foods. On a lazy Sunday make up a batch of
this lip-buzzing spice rub, and you'll have plenty on hand for
grilling. This rub is perfect for chicken thighs and legs, pork or
beef tenderloin or shrimp.</LD>
<LD>   Here I've used leftover spice-rubbed grilled chicken thighs to
make a jambalaya-inspired soup.</LD>
<LD>   To make the rub, combine 1/4 cup each of coarse salt, dark brown
sugar and ground cumin in a bowl. Add 2 tablespoons each of pepper,
paprika, dried thyme, ground coriander and chili powder. Stir in 2
teaspoons of cinnamon and blend together. Store in a covered jar in
the pantry. Use a third to a half of the rub when grilling the
chicken that will be added to this soup.</LD>

<TE>   Louisiana-Style Chicken and Rice Soup</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 50 minutes</TE>
<TE>   2 andouille or chorizo sausages, about 2/3 pound, sliced into
1/4-inch-thick rounds</TE>
<TE>   1 to 2 tablespoons oil</TE>
<TE>   1 large clove garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   1 onion, chopped</TE>
<TE>   1 green bell pepper, cut into 1/2-inch dice</TE>
<TE>   1 red bell pepper, cut into 1/2-inch dice</TE>
<TE>   1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes</TE>
<TE>   3 (14-ounce) cans chicken broth</TE>
<TE>   1 bay leaf</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon dried thyme</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup rice</TE>
<TE>   4 grilled chicken thighs, skin removed, cut into 3/4-inch dice</TE>
<TE>   Arrange the sausage slices in a single layer in a large stockpot.
Cook the sausage over medium heat on both sides until lightly browned
and cooked through, about 4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and
set aside on a plate. There should be about 1 tablespoon of fat left
in the pan. Add enough oil to the pan so there is a total of 3
tablespoons. Swirl to coat the pan, then add the garlic and onion.
Cook, stirring frequently, until the onion is softened, about 3
minutes. Add the green and red peppers and cook 3 minutes longer.</TE>
<TE>   Add the diced tomatoes, including the juice, along with the
chicken broth, bay leaf and thyme. Bring to a boil over medium-high
heat. Lower the heat so the soup just simmers, partially cover the
pot and cook for 10 minutes. Stir in the rice, partially cover the
pot and simmer until the rice is almost tender, 10 minutes longer.
Add the sausage and chicken and cook until heated through, about 5
minutes. Remove the bay leaf. Ladle into warm soup bowls and serve
immediately.</TE>

<LD>DEAR SOS: I am a former Southern California resident now living in
Northern California. I really miss Clearman's Northwoods Inn
restaurants. I know quite a few years back you published the recipe
for their red cabbage salad.</LD>
<LD>   JUDITH CHENEY</LD>
<LD>   Via e-mail</LD>
<TE>   DEAR JUDITH: We first ran this recipe, developed by the Times Test
Kitchen, in 1990. It's based on the salad from the Clearman's
restaurant chain.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Red Cabbage Salad</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time and Total Preparation Time: 15 minutes, plus 2
hours standing</TE>
<TE>   1/2 head red cabbage, cored</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup oil</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons sugar</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons salt, or more to taste</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon seasoned salt</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon onion powder</TE>
<TE>   Shred the cabbage so it is irregular, with some fine and some
coarse shreds, and place in a large nonaluminum bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the oil, vinegar, sugar, salt, seasoned salt, pepper and
onion powder. Add to the cabbage and mix well.</TE>
<TE>   Cover the salad and let stand several hours to allow the flavors
to mellow and the cabbage to achieve a deep red color.</TE>

<LD>The big artisan breads behind the counter at Le Pain Quotidien
Bakery, which has shops in New York and Europe, are made in an Old
World style with natural leavening and Belgian flour. But don't worry
about buying a whole loaf and having it go stale before you can eat
it all; you can buy fractions of loaves. The bakery sells half or
quarter loaves of its 4 1/2-pound whole-wheat bread and half loaves
of its 2-pound walnut bread and its five-grain and raisin bread. The
delicious 1 1/2-pound rye bread, though, can only be purchased as a
whole loaf.</LD>
<LD>   4 1/2-pound whole-wheat loaf, $9.50; half loaf, $5; and
one-quarter loaf, $2.75. Two-pound walnut loaf, $5.50; half loaf, $3.
Two-pound five-grain and raisin loaf, $5.50; half loaf, $3.50.
One-and-a-half-pound rye loaf, $3.75. All from Le Pain Quotidien
Bakery and Communal Table, 9630 S. Santa Monica Blvd., Beverly Hills,
(310) 859-1100 and 11702 Barrington Court, Brentwood, (310) 476-0969.</LD>

she comes at it from the standpoint of feminist scholarship on the
history of women's pursuits.</LD>
<LD>   But the result is not as academic as it might sound. Haber is
genuinely fascinated by the interplay of cooking and people's lives,
and she loves a good anecdote.</LD>
<LD>   She's attracted to the problems of cooking in hardship
situations--the Irish potato famine, the hospitals of the Civil War,
the camps in which the Japanese interned Americans in the Philippines
during World War II--and to non-commercial food businesses, such as a
restaurant founded by refugees from Nazism as a charity and the Fred
Harvey restaurants of the old West, which were underwritten by a
railroad as a way of luring travelers. (The only commercial
restaurants in the book are those started by pioneering African
American woman restaurateurs such as Cleora Butler and Edna Lewis.)</LD>
<TE>   The story of the waitresses at the Harvey restaurants and their
role in bringing a note of refinement to the frontier is the sunniest
and most charming part of the book. The refugee restaurant, though,
is a relatively dry account of who worked there and when and why they
left. It has the air of a local interest story for Cambridge, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Haber misreads some things--the emphasis on game hunting in the
early Gourmet magazine had at least as much to do with Gourmet's
perennial aim at upscale readers as with machismo--but on the whole
she's remarkably generous to her subjects, and even finds kind things
to say about Henrietta Nesbitt, whose cooking for the White House of
Franklin D. Roosevelt was notoriously dull.</TE>

<HD>Winegrowing Season: Waiting for the Valley to Inhale</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROD SMITH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's winegrowing season started the other day. I had to put
on a jacket. It felt like a bucket of cold water down the back of my
neck. As a friend said through chattering teeth, "Somebody just
opened the icebox door."</LD>
<LD>   It might seem odd that a blast of frigid air would herald the
opening of fruit-growing season, but that's what makes California
distinctive.</LD>
<LD>   The day certainly didn't start out in the refrigerator. Just
before sunset we had arrived at a high ridge near the coast in
western Sonoma County. We'd brought along grilled pork sandwiches and
a bottle of Russian River Valley Pinot Noir, built a small fire and
settled in to watch the immense full moon drift up out of the
redwoods in dead-calm air, turning from orange to blazing white as it
cleared the lowland haze over distant Santa Rosa.</LD>
<TE>   It was T-shirt and shorts weather. We lounged comfortably in
wildflowers and grass that still had weeks of green left before it
would turn brown for the summer. The campfire smoke curled lazily
straight up to the stars.</TE>
<TE>   The wine was the '99 Dehlinger "Goldridge" Pinot Noir. It was
perfect for the evening, a gracefully exuberant Pinot with piercing
red berry and rose scents and bold red and black fruit flavor. Its
clear flavors and bracing acidity spoke of vines rooted in Gold Ridge
soil, the light sandy loam found primarily in the cool Green Valley
appellation near Sebastopol, in the southern Russian River Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The botanist Luther Burbank established a farm in Sebastopol
because he felt this soil was a magical medium for growing luscious
fruit, especially apples. This Pinot corroborated that vision. But
more than that, it spoke of a special grape-growing climate--not just
in the Russian River Valley but in all of coastal California.</TE>
<TE>   Winemakers take a lot of credit for creating fine wines. Growers
do, too, with considerably more justification. But it's really the
Pacific Ocean that makes California's wines outstanding.</TE>
<TE>   California is blessed with a cold coastwise current. Frigid to
begin with, it also causes an upwelling of even colder water from
great depths. In combination with onshore winds, these currents have
a significant cooling effect on vineyards in coastal wine districts
which otherwise would be much hotter.</TE>
<TE>   Without the ocean's influence, California would be too hot for
grapes such as Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon.
Extremely ripe fruit produces heavy, lackluster wines. The ocean's
cooling effect allows the grapes to ripen fully without losing the
precious acidity that creates intensity and fine structure. It
emulates the effects of altitude and distance from the equator. In
viticultural terms, vineyards near the coast seem to be at a higher
latitude than the map would indicate.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how it works: The northern and southern extremities of
California's Central Valley (with its two great lobes, the Sacramento
and the San Joaquin) reach very high temperatures during the summer
because of the way the terrain concentrates solar radiation. As the
hot air rises, it creates a vacuum that sucks cold marine air inland
via the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento River system, the Russian River
Valley and other gaps in the coastal mountain ranges south to Santa
Barbara County.</TE>
<TE>   The cool air typically flows inland during the afternoon, and it's
often accompanied by fog that lingers until dissipated by the sun
next morning. In the height of summer, the marine incursion is often
large enough to cool the Central Valley significantly. As for the
coastal valleys, the fog may cover them well into the afternoon for
days on end, until enough heat accumulates inland to drive it
offshore again. At that point the Central Valley begins super-heating
again, and the cycle is repeated.</TE>
<TE>   From the grape's perspective, the pace of sugar accumulation and
physiological ripening in the latter part of the season are
influenced by the way these fog events affect photosynthesis. Thus
the character of a vintage is marked by the rhythm of marine
incursions.</TE>
<TE>   This regular five- to seven-day cycle is perhaps best understood
using an organic model: Looking at a topographical map, you can
visualize California as a living, breathing organism, with the
Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys operating as a pair of lungs, the
Golden Gate and San Francisco Bay as a mouth and the delta as
trachea, and Lodi somewhere around the tonsils. The ongoing
respiration, as the Central Valley inhales and exhales throughout the
growing season, is what makes California wine grapes so good. The
situation is similar to the southern Mediterranean coast of
France--in fact, Lodi could be called the Languedoc of California.</TE>
<TE>   That's just what we were experiencing on that ridge in western
Sonoma County. It had been warm for a few days, and the interior had
super-heated (well, for that time of year) to the point where the
ocean began to breathe on the land. We felt the first stirrings as it
came ashore a few miles west. Its briny tang mingled with the warm
scents of redwood and pinecone, of green grass and wildflowers and
woodland under-story. The air had body, a texture and volume.</TE>
<TE>   And then it was just cold. Under the blasting ocean breeze, the
smoke from the campfire ran down the slope. It reminded me of
standing on Russian Hill in San Francisco, watching the great fog
serpent slithering in through the Golden Gate. We drank the last of
the Dehlinger Pinot Noir and then scrambled for fleece and long
pants, and without any discussion began packing things up for the
moonlight hike down the hill.</TE>
<TE>   Far below us on the plains and hillsides of the Russian River
Valley, hundreds of thousands of grape vines were feeling the change.
They were feeling it in Dry Creek Valley, in Alexander Valley and in
Chalk Hill. They were feeling it in Carneros and in Lodi. Similar
marine incursions would be happening farther south--in the Salinas
Valley, at San Luis Obispo, in the Santa Maria and Santa Ynez
valleys.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning was cool but clear. It will be another month or
so before the great weather machine cranks into high gear, before the
vine-tempering cold cycle begins in earnest and the fog comes into
play.</TE>
<TE>   But for grape growers, wine producers and a few wine fans who
happened to be out and about when the change occurred, the signal had
been unmistakable. The 2002 growing season is underway.</TE>

<DH>2000 Alban Vineyards Viognier, Central Coast, California</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I've found my summer aperitif.</LD>
<LD>   Winemaker John Alban spearheaded California vintners' interest in
Rhone varietals. In fact, his winery, in the Edna Valley near Paso
Robles, was the first in California devoted entirely to Rhone grape
varieties such as Viognier.</LD>
<LD>   Alban's Viogniers are consistently excellent, but the current
release is exceptional. With its scent of orange blossoms and violets
and a slight bitterness in the finish that balances the ripe, lush
fruit, it's a terrific white wine for the price, one that I'll be
drinking with pleasure all summer. Serve it well chilled.</LD>
<TE>   About $16. Widely available at fine wine shops and retailers. If
you can't find it, have your local wine shop contact the distributor,
Angeles Wine Agency, at (818) 764-2221.</TE>

<LD>I have a beer in hand. A Staples Center beer, 30 cents a sip.
Nonetheless, I am content. At 30 cents a sip, you'd better savor
every stinkin' bubble. I settle in my overpriced seat and lick
mustard from my thumb.</LD>
<LD>   "I am," I tell the boy, "officially happy."</LD>
<LD>   "Look how big Tim Duncan is," the boy says.</LD>
<TE>   "Maybe later," I say.</TE>
<TE>   We get to Staples early because, well, we don't get here very
often, the way Jack and Dustin do. The way Dyan Cannon does, an
actress/milkshake straw who evidently eats only birdseed and nuts,
and not too much of that.</TE>
<TE>   No, we're relative newcomers here to Staples, and it shows. The
boy and I are like two farmers visiting the White House for the first
time, necks craning, heads always tilted up as we mutter "Jeeesh,
it's big." Or "Hey, how 'bout them ceilings?" Stuff like that.</TE>
<TE>   "This," the boy says holding up his sandwich, "is the best
sandwich I've ever eaten."</TE>
<TE>   "This," I say, holding up the beer, "is the best beer I've ever
had."</TE>
<TE>   Let the game begin.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, right, there's a game here. Staples is, after all, just a
giant gymnasium, though it has no discernible musk the way a good gym
should--sweat, Pepsi and shellac.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's all these sweet-scented Laker Girls, doing moves that
would've made Elvis blush.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe it's all these schmoozers and shakers. Penny Marshall
over here. Jeffrey Katzenberg over there. What does a celebrity smell
like? I don't know, but it's got to be better than a gym.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, near as we can tell, the boy and I are the only two
non-celebrities at Staples on this fine Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Which works out OK for us, being the last two unfamous people in
L.A., though in this lovely and odd little town, that's bound to
attract attention on its own.</TE>
<TE>   "What did you do," some interviewer is bound to ask, "to attract
so little attention?"</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing," I'll answer.</TE>
<TE>   "That's for sure," the boy will say.</TE>
<TE>   "How 'bout them ceilings?" I'll marvel, and the poor interviewer
will move on.</TE>
<TE>   We came here in a hurry, left the house two hours before game time
with plans to stop at Philippe's for lunch then move on to Staples
for dessert.</TE>
<TE>   But that didn't work out so well, since it was Cinco de Mayo and
Chinatown was clogged. We inched toward Philippe's, then stopped
cold. Only in L.A. does Chinatown clog up on Cinco de Mayo, near a
restaurant named Philippe's.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's get out of here," I said, and spun the wheel, which put us
on Broadway, then 8th Street, then Hope. Just when traffic looks
bleakest, there's always Hope, itself clogged for some movie shoot.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll never get there," said the boy.</TE>
<TE>   "We're three blocks away," I said.</TE>
<TE>   It's the boy's first Laker game--a playoff game, no less--and he's
anxious to get there early. Wants to watch warmups. Wants to study
Shaq's smile.</TE>
<TE>   Talk about smiles. Before the game, the camera zooms in and Shaq's
face lights up the place, the face of basketball's reigning court
jester, master of the slam funk.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Shaq is the only sports millionaire who seems able to
crack a joke anymore. The only athlete having a good time.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the joking ends with the opening tip-off. The Lakers,
rusty from a long layoff, slog through the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq, you're not a forward," a fan shouts after he dares an
8-footer.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Robert, shut up!" says another, after Horry gets a
technical.</TE>
<TE>   Fickle, these Laker fans. And shy, too. For the first five
minutes, it's as if Laker fans have taken some group Botox injection
that has deadened them, removed their wrinkles and soothed their
high-priced cares.</TE>
<TE>   "Three-peat!" screams the boy, and I swear there was an echo.</TE>
<TE>   For the Lakers' woes continue. They dribble the ball off their
shoes and seem to gang up on one side of the basket, look across
court to find no one they know, then desperately ricochet a shot off
the rim, where it clangs like a horseshoe.</TE>
<TE>   It is basketball so awkward and ugly that actual boos finally ring
out across Staples.</TE>
<TE>   At courtside, Nicholson--possibly the Lakers' most ardent
fan--grabs the sides of his silvered head and twirls, spins like that
McMurphy character he played in "Cuckoo's Nest." Spins like a madman.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at Nicholson," I tell the boy.</TE>
<TE>   "Where?"</TE>
<TE>   And I point out Nicholson in his regular seat along the Spurs'
bench, a home-court advantage if there ever was one.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine coming in from Cleveland or Memphis and looking over to
see Nicholson three seats away, hair jutting out from the sides of
his head like crab grass? Imagine what that does to your game?</TE>
<TE>   In the second period, Heather Locklear arrives, and the Lakers
respond with new ferocity, though it might've been a mere
coincidence.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Kobe Bryant, the original Spider-Man, grabs Duncan's
head like a bus strap, then soars over the Spurs' star for a slam
dunk.</TE>
<TE>   The third quarter is when most of the bloodshed occurs. Shaq
gashes his finger, leaves the game to visit his tailor, then returns,
darned like a sock.</TE>
<TE>   In the fourth, Kobe leaves. Then Kobe returns. It's like one of
Shakespeare's farces, where every 30 seconds someone leaves and two
new guys show up.</TE>
<TE>   "You stink, Parker!" a fan yells at the Spurs' Paris-born guard.
"You stink, you French poodle!"</TE>
<TE>   I am standing. The boy is standing. Jack is standing. Best of all,
the Lakers are still standing, on bruised knees, the defending
champs.</TE>
<TE>   "Three-peat!" yells the now lively crowd, on its feet and
screaming for yet another NBA title.</TE>
<TE>   "Three-peat!" yells the boy, officially happy at his first Laker
game, here at Staples Center, gymnasium to the stars.</TE>

<HD>Speaking a Language That Latinas Are Eager to Hear</HD>
<DH>Sandra Guzman's book dishes on cultural differences in
dating, career, family.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARIA ELENA FERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I am layers of history that speak of beaches and snowflakes, rain
forests and tenements, Spanish and English, spicy food and fast food,
hip-hop and congas, apple pie and flan."--Sandra Guzman, "The
Latina's Bible" (Three Rivers Press)</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   As a Jerseyrican--Puerto Rican-born, New Jersey-raised--Sandra
Guzman grew up straddling two cultures, always feeling like an
oddball who didn't quite fit into either world. At home, her family
spoke Spanish, ate Puerto Rican food, watched telenovelas, and were
first devout Catholics, then devout Pentecostals. At school, Guzman
felt divided, as if another girl's soul took over her body, a girl
who embraced American attitudes and fashions, enjoyed rock music and
had the "unbecoming gringita habit" of expressing her opinion.</LD>
<TE>   Like most Latinas growing up in two cultures, Guzman found herself
in a constant tug-of-war between her heart and mind; her heart
beating for her family, her mind yearning for independence and
enrichment. Leaving home for college, for example, fired up Guzman's
spirit but meant nothing but angustia (anguish) for her protective
mother, who fretted over her daughter sleeping among strangers in a
dorm.</TE>
<TE>   "Born into a borderland and raised in a cultural middle," Guzman
said she grew up feeling frustrated and conflicted, wondering which
side of herself she would eventually have to give up: The devoted
daughter brought up to marry and have children? Or the woman who
dreamed of a career in journalism and living in her own apartment?</TE>
<TE>   What she didn't realize then was that, rather than conforming to
one of those molds, she was becoming a new breed of woman, a "nueva
Latina" who "owns English," dreams in Spanish and is "not exotic" but
rather "a confluence of Pan-Latino consciousness and American
influences," as the Emmy award-winning journalist and former editor
in chief of Latina magazine writes in her first book, "The Latina's
Bible: The Nueva Latina's Guide to Love, Sex, Spirituality, and La
Vida" (Three Rivers Press).</TE>
<TE>   "We are really a different generation of women," says Guzman, 37,
who is soon to be married for a second time, has a 14-year-old son
and is expecting her second baby. "This isn't something that just hit
me one day. It came organically. I wasn't like my mother or my
grandmother or my tias [aunts]. I was a new being that took the best
they offered me but let go of the taboos that also held me back. I am
definitely an American-made woman with all of the richness of the
Latino culture. I think it's kind of hot."</TE>
<TE>   "The Latina's Bible" is an inspirational self-help book that
celebrates U.S. Latino culture and offers Latinas compassionate and
humorous advice for taking better care of themselves, nurturing
relationships with family and friends and pursuing their dreams. It's
a book that screams "Latina girl power" but also gives away some
cultural secrets to non-Latinos interested in Guzman's lively
insights. Non-Latino men, for example, can glean valuable tips on
courting Latinas and understanding the importance and complexity of
Latino families. Guzman illuminates her regular visits to her
mother's house, where there is always music, plenty of food, children
running all around and adults talking over each other.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone foreign to that world might confuse my mother's home with
a madhouse, because to non-Latino ears, it may seem a bit loud," she
writes. "A man who dates me will have to find a way to fit in, to
feel comfortable in all the noise, and to understand the sense of
comfort it gives me to be there."</TE>
<TE>   The book also is filled with sidebars and statistics that give
context to Guzman's personal anecdotes as well as the stories of
Latinas across the nation whom she interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   While nueva Latinas are moving out of their parents' homes to
pursue careers or live with boyfriends--instead of getting married
and buying a house nearby, as is often expected--they also stretch
the umbilical cord rather than severing it, calling and visiting home
often and helping out their parents economically.</TE>
<TE>   As a nueva Latina, Guzman explains she feels a closer kinship to a
Mexican American who grew up in San Antonio than to a Puerto Rican
raised on her native island. Like Guzman, these Latinas grew up in
American schools, watching American television and struggling
internally with stifling old-country traditions. Along the way, these
kinds of bicultural children created a new language--Spanglish--and a
new culture with old and new rhythms while battling racism,
discrimination, invisibility and exploitation.</TE>
<TE>   "In many ways, this generation is luckier than the past," says
Guzman, who was raised along with her two brothers and two sisters by
her single mother, at first in the Puerto Rican fishing village of El
Tuque. When Guzman was 9, the family migrated to Jersey City when the
sneaker factory where her mother worked closed. Although she was
thrust into American culture, traditional Latino values dominated at
home: "Family is blood, have faith in Dios and church, respect the
elderly, girls are of the home, boys not."</TE>
<TE>   "We are forging a new way of being Latino. I certainly feel
sexually empowered, personally empowered and culturally empowered,"
Guzman says. "In our cultures, people don't pursue [their] dreams out
of guilt; women are made to feel they are abandoning their families.
But we've changed that. We have shown [our families] that as we
pursue our dreams, we will continue to cherish them. This ability to
balance all of the wonderful things provided in mainstream culture,
and not leave behind the things that nurture us, is what sets this
generation of Latinas apart."</TE>
<TE>   With warmth and humor, Guzman tackles a variety of complicaciones
(complicating issues), which nueva Latinas face on a daily basis,
from interracial dating and homophobia in Latino circles to problems
in the workplace and in their love lives. Her light and breezy
writing style intersperses funny English phrases with well-known
Spanish dichos (expressions). From surviving a control-freak mother
to dating without becoming a quasi-wife, Guzman implores her
bicultural mamitas [her peers] to be true to themselves above all.</TE>
<TE>   The same way she insisted on writing her book her own way when she
was shopping for a publisher. As editor of Latina, Guzman had been
approached several times about writing a tell-all book about Latinas.
But most publishing houses, she learned, had their version of the
message they wanted to put out. One publisher wanted her to become
the Iyanla Vanzant for Latinas; another wanted her to explore the way
Latina prisoners bond in their cells.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, she approached Three Rivers Press and found Becky
Cabaza, a Mexican American from Texas, who "just got it." "She has a
fantastic way of reaching out to her audience," says Cabaza,
executive editor at Three Rivers. "And it's a riot. Those different
lists in there, of what we call our grandmothers in the different
countries, and, oh yeah, that other list [about terms for the vagina]
is funny too. I thought, 'My God, this is about me.' And that's how
Latinas all over the country are reacting at book signings."</TE>
<TE>   Guzman's amusing take on the Latina sexual mystique also includes
a look at cultural expectations for virginity, and the "hot tamale"
stereotype. The Latino male expectation that his Latina be a saint
outside the home but highly skilled in the bedroom "can get crazy for
us," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Our mothers never heard of half the stuff we deal with. The
ticking clock? Que es eso? [What is that?] Our work pressures, our
relationship pressures. It's a whole new world that we've created,"
Guzman says. "It can get confusing, which is why I wanted to leave
this for future generations. But I believe we're better off for it.
My motto is, 'It's all doable, girl.'"</TE>

<HD>A Temple on the Edge of Doom</HD>
<DH>The oldest active Chinese Taoist sanctuary in California is
crumbling. Without restoration funding, this historical landmark
won't survive.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>MARYSVILLE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Most of the time you could drive past the Bok Kai Temple and easily
miss it. From the street in this tired Central Valley town north of
Sacramento only the back of the plain building is visible. The front
of the temple opens smack onto an earthen levee, which towers above
the structure. And once you do find the temple, most of the time its
door is locked.</LD>
<LD>   But during the Lucky Bomb Day festival the temple is impossible to
miss. On that weekend this past March the oldest active Chinese
Taoist temple in California is active indeed: At noon the line to get
in stretches around the corner. Everywhere, people are carrying
roasted suckling pigs on platters. The air is thick with firecrackers
popping, the booms of small bombs that throw rings into the sky for
children to catch and the sounds of Chinese.</LD>
<LD>   Inside the temple, food offerings are piled high, incense fills
the air as thick as barbecue smoke, and the small room echoes with
the rattle of fortune sticks, which are shaken in a bamboo container
until one of the numbered staves falls to the floor and foretells the
future. In the middle of an altar surrounded by elaborate wood
carvings, embroidered banners and hanging lanterns, Bok Kai stands
impassively, just as he has for more than a century.</LD>
<TE>   Bok Kai is the Chinese water god, the bringer of rain, the
preventer of floods and the banisher of evil. And since the temple
was built in 1880, locals like to point out, the town hasn't been
inundated even while the river has deluged neighboring Yuba City.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the site," says Paul G. Chace, who wrote a PhD thesis on
the temple's role in the community and visits every year from
Escondido, "where the saints can best watch over the town to see that
nothing good flows away and that nothing bad flows in."</TE>
<TE>   The only thing Bok Kai can't do, it seems, is to stop his house
from falling down around him.</TE>
<TE>   The Yuba River courses down the hills from Gold Country and pours
into the Feather River, about 40 miles north of Sacramento.
Marysville was founded at the confluence of the two rivers in 1851
and during the Gold Rush briefly swelled into one of the largest
cities in the state. Many of those drawn to the gold fields were
Chinese immigrants from the Canton province, who made up about a
quarter of Marysville's population of about 5,000 people and built
the second-largest Chinatown in California after San Francisco's.</TE>
<TE>   In 1880 the Chinese community built the Bok Kai Temple, replacing
a smaller temple from 1854. The new temple faced the Yuba River,
along the bridge leading into town. The building itself was
unremarkable, but the inside of the front porch was painted with a
lyrical mural showing robed figures, flying birds and graceful
calligraphy. The main altar featured the figurines of Bok Kai and six
other deities, intricate carvings, ceremonial weapons and other
artifacts imported from southern China.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the town turned out for the dedication ceremony, and the
annual Chinese New Year parade, held in February or March, soon
became Marysville's biggest civic event--which the city claims is the
longest running parade in the state.</TE>
<TE>   But though the festival still draws thousands every year, time has
been less kind to the temple. A levee was built in front of it, the
main street (and bridge) into town was moved downstream, and most of
the Chinese businesses that once thrived in the neighborhood have
closed. Today, fewer than 100 Chinese Americans live in the area.</TE>
<TE>   And the temple is falling apart. A plastic tarp covers part of the
roof; inside, the ceiling is collapsing in places; bricks in the wall
are crumbling and the floor is rotting away. Huge cracks mar the
sides of the murals on the porch, the roof of which looks like it
could snap off the building.</TE>
<TE>   "Even as we stand, a piece could fall," says George Rios, head of
the Friends of the Marysville Bok Kai Temple, a nonprofit group that
is trying to save the structure. "But all that can be brought back
again."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the National Trust for Historic Preservation declared
the temple one of the 11 most endangered sites in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Where there were once hundreds, if not thousands, of flourishing
Chinese temples throughout the West, only a handful remain, and the
Marysville structure is the only one dedicated to Bok Kai. "Those
murals may be unique in the world," says Chace, an art consultant.
"Taiwan repaints its temples. China tore down its temples in the
Cultural Revolution. But the Marysville temple will fall apart if
nothing is done."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s and '80s, the local Kiwanis and Lions clubs
contributed to repair projects, but the temple's needs far outstrip
the area's resources. The Friends of the Marysville Bok Kai Temple
and Marysville Chinese Community Inc., which owns the building, have
raised about $30,000--just enough to pay for a structural report due
this summer that will assess just how dilapidated the temple is and
recommend a renovation program.</TE>
<TE>   "The temple is not just for the Chinese community but for
everyone," says Stan Tidman, the city's coordinator for community
development. "The city has tried to help, but it doesn't have the
economic base that some communities have."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the temple reflects the declining fortunes of Marysville
itself. The town has 12,000 residents and shares the title of "prune
capital of the world" with neighboring Yuba City, but the dried-plum
business isn't exactly a growth industry. The city's historical
downtown is pretty, but boarded-up buildings and "for rent"
storefronts outnumber open businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The most prominent landmark in town is actually the Marysville
Hotel, a stately structure built in 1926 and listed on the National
Register of Historical Places but empty now for years and boarded up
to keep out squatters. There are also two grand old movie houses, the
State Theater and the Tower Theater, almost equally neglected.</TE>
<TE>   "There are more than 300 historical buildings in town," says
Tidman. "For a small town with limited resources, it's difficult to
maintain that resource stock."</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, the city has to pull down a historical building
(many of which are owned by absentee landlords) before it falls down.
Then there's the trade-off between preservation and development. The
biggest retail center in town is the Mervyn's store across the street
from the Bok Kai Temple, the construction of which required the
razing of part of old town Marysville, a loss still lamented by some.
"The old-timers say we really blew it," Tidman says.</TE>
<TE>   All of which makes scraping together repair money for the temple
that much harder.</TE>
<TE>   "They have an incredible resource and an enormous challenge," says
Anthony Veerkamp, senior program officer with the National Trust for
Historic Preservation based in San Francisco. "It's a huge challenge
for a rural, rather improvised community to do the kind of
fund-raising that will be required. It's a million-dollar project at
least. That's a challenge for any community."</TE>
<TE>   Marysville celebrated Chinese New Year this year as it has every
year since 1872: with a huge parade snaking through town. Behind the
Marysville's dragon, supported by 40 men, another 100 groups marched,
representing everyone from the Boy Scouts to the Sons of Norway.</TE>
<TE>   "Bok Kai is the patron of this town and its protector," says
Chace. "Marysville's temple is unique. The whole town has adopted it
as its principle landmark. After five generations they all party
together. It's a community thing."</TE>
<TE>   The next day was Lucky Bomb Day, Bok Kai's festival, which was
once widely celebrated in Chinese communities throughout California
but now takes place only in Marysville.</TE>
<TE>   Families from all over journey to Marysville. Kevin Vuoung has
been coming to Marysville from Oakland every year for six years--ever
since he heard about the temple from a friend. He waits in line at
the temple, pays for incense and fake money to burn as an offering
and then makes a prayer.</TE>
<TE>   "I wished [once] I had a boy," he says. "I got a boy. I wished I
had a girl. I got a girl. Now, I'm wishing for a better job."</TE>
<TE>   By 4 o'clock, when the bomb festival actually begins, most of the
crowd is gone. The skies are threatening rain. A procession of
Chinese elders marches out of the temple, firecrackers tossed as they
go. They carry a jade tablet representing Bok Kai, decked out in
ribbons, followed by smoking incense and a banging gong. "Their gods
are so powerful," marvels Chace, "but they don't have enough money to
build a new roof."</TE>

<HD>A Casual, No-Frills Shakespeare Production Played for
Laughs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gina Piccalo and Louise Roug</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Funk music filled the theater, and suddenly the stage was crowded
with bumping-and-grinding celebrities, who had cast off their star
personas for a reading of William Shakespeare's "Midsummer Night's
Dream." Among the most unrecognizable of the cast was Tom Hanks as
Bottom, the wannabe thespian-turned-mule.</LD>
<LD>   The two-time Oscar winner strutted onstage, a white bandana
covering his head, trousers belted high above his waist to reveal an
unusual choice of footwear: white socks and sandals. He moved with
bravado and spoke with a throaty Bulgarian-esque accent, rendering
all his lines comic.</LD>
<LD>   (After the show, Hanks explained that the play is set in Greece,
so, he chose to depict a modern-day Greek tourist. Rita Wilson, who
played the fairy queen Titania, had another explanation for her
husband's choice of accent: "He's doing my dad!").</LD>
<TE>   The Monday night show at the Geffen Playhouse in Westwood has
become an annual tradition since its beginning 13 years ago. Each
year, Hanks and Wilson, the event co-hosts, rally their friends for a
one-night-only reading of a Shakespeare play to benefit the
Shakespeare Festival/LA. Tickets, which range from $250 to $2,500
each, always sell out.</TE>
<TE>   The mood is casual. There is no set and no costumes (white socks
and sandals notwithstanding), and actors don't memorize their lines.
(Christina Applegate as Hermia and Peter Krause as Lysander earned
hearty laughs Monday night for missing cues and bungling speeches.)
This year, the cast got together for one five-hour rehearsal. "Then
they sit around and figure out how to outdo each other," said Ben
Donenberg, the festival's founder and producing artistic director.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Hanks and Martin Short, who played Puck, were the clear
crowd favorites. Short wore his hair standing on end until the joke
wore thin. Then he pulled his T-shirt halfway over his head, let his
ears protrude and read some lines as Katharine Hepburn and others as
John Wayne. Occasionally, he took on the odd mannerisms of his
beloved "SCTV" character Ed Grimley. "If one thing wasn't working,"
Short said, after the show, "I'd change it."</TE>
<TE>   Hanks, who last performed Shakespeare seriously in the late 1970s
in Cleveland, said the annual reading is as much fun for the cast as
it is for the audience. "All we do is laugh from beginning to end."</TE>

<TE>   Earnest Fans of a Fantasy Man</TE>
<TE>   On Monday night, a group of women realized a fantasy outside the
Writers Guild Theater in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Some had traveled several hundred miles for this: a smile, maybe a
chat and a picture.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm shaking right now," said 32-year-old Amparo del Aguila, who
had just met the object of her affection: Colin Firth.</TE>
<TE>   Firth, in town to promote "The Importance of Being Earnest," had
come to the British Academy of Film and Television Los Angeles
screening of the movie, where he met Aguila and her fellow fans.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not ashamed to like him," Aguila said. "He's the universal
man that everyone wants."</TE>
<TE>   And the encounter? Firth signed Aguila's production notes for the
movie. "He's everything I thought he was."</TE>
<TE>   Aguila isn't a celebrity hound, she said--only Firth has won her
heart. At work, a Palo Alto marketing and communications company,
colleagues are curious about her obsession. "Like, 'You're taking
time off to do what?'"</TE>
<TE>   Aguila was trailing Firth's "Earnest" junket to New York, where
the movie is set to premiere Monday, and had taken two weeks off from
work to make the pilgrimage. Fellow fans, Janice Charleboix, 53, from
Portland, and Kristi Bowman, 42, of Seattle, had also come just for
the screening. And to get in, they'd joined the sponsoring British
film and TV academy.</TE>
<TE>   The fans span a wide demographic. "There are 75- to 80-year-old
women who are learning to use the Internet so they can learn more
about Colin," said Charleboix. And 16-year-old girls like him, too,
she added.</TE>
<TE>   With other stars, "you can get disappointed by their personal
life," said Aguila, adding, "not that they owe us anything."</TE>
<TE>   At the Q&amp;A after the screening, one woman in the audience asked
how Firth felt about a couple of fantasy scenes in the movie. "Did I
really participate in any of the fantasies?" asked Firth. Exclaimed
the woman: "You did in mine."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stars Getting Into the Groove</TE>
<TE>   What two settings give you the best chance of spotting famous
faces in Los Angeles? One is any LAX gate boarding a New York nonstop
flight, and the other is the latest high-priced concert by a baby
boomer rock legend. Into the latter category falls the Paul McCartney
concert on Saturday at Staples Center, where the crowd included Jack
Nicholson (bearded, and grooving to "Fool on the Hill" like a hippie
in full flashback mode), Sly Stallone, John Cusack, Pat Boone (who
was way off the beat as he clapped along), Ted Danson and even Sir
Paul's friendly old rival, the reclusive Brian Wilson (who appeared
at times to doze but was revived by those neo-Beach Boy harmonies
from "Back in the U.S.S.R.").</TE>

<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Recently, this paper's Highway 1 section began taking questions from
the studio audience, and on the first go-round someone asked a
question that has gnawed at me for years.</LD>
<LD>   Heather Wall of Irvine, who has clearly lost too many years of her
life to looky-loos, wondered why the CHP or Caltrans hasn't developed
"a quickly inflatable wall that could block the view of an accident
from oncoming traffic."</LD>
<LD>   California Highway Patrol Sgt. Tim Malley was mildly amused by the
suggestion, but I think it's a perfectly splendid idea.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, I would go one, or perhaps 17, steps further. I think
that upon establishing residency in Los Angeles, one should have to
sign a waiver that allows the CHP to vaporize any car that, due to
impact or accident, is drawing the sort of gawking that should really
be reserved for a Tom Cruise sighting.</TE>
<TE>   To subsidize the reimbursement to drivers of the now nonexistent
vehicles, five cents will be added to the gasoline tax. A bargain,
when you consider the fistfuls of money most of us would be willing
to hand out the driver-side window to escape  rubbernecking gridlock.</TE>
<TE>   It should also be a fineable offense to have your vehicle break
down on the freeway due to imperfect maintenance. Why should the rest
of us suffer because some drivers are too lazy or over-scheduled to
remember that oil must be replenished, that gas is required for a car
to keep moving, that the water in their sports bottles might be put
to better use in the radiator? Talk about a city revenue generator.
And if you can't seem to keep up to date on these things, well, this
is the reason most of us get married.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the streetwise technology already in place could be put to
use to actually improve the lives of motorists. If cameras can be
used to nab stoplight runners, then they can be used to capture
stoplight harassers. You know, those disturbed individuals who use
those minutes to hurl sexual insults at or otherwise verbally abuse
and threaten their fellow drivers, and then roar off into the sunset.</TE>
<TE>   So get them on film. And then arrest them. Or send the tapes to
their moms.</TE>
<TE>   It would also be great if car horns could be programmed to say
"Excuse me," "Thank you" and "I'm so sorry." How hard could this be,
really, and just think of all the trouble it would prevent.</TE>
<TE>   I'm pretty sure we could also program cars to monitor, and
correct, bad driving habits. Some cars are now equipped to sound a
warning if something or someone gets within so many inches of their
back bumpers, in the hopes of decreasing the number of children
killed by cars backing up. Of course, this is the best use of such
technology.</TE>
<TE>   But once they've perfected that, wouldn't it be great if after so
many minutes of tailgating, a smart car would simply get off at the
next available exit and sit quietly for five or 10 minutes until its
driver came to his or her senses? Or if the car of a cautious driver
"knew" to keep out of the left lane?</TE>
<TE>   Just imagine a world in which cars simply refused to have their
horns honked for no good reason when driving through tunnels. Bliss.</TE>
<TE>   But the best feature any car could have is subtext. Like in "Annie
Hall" when Woody Allen's character and Diane Keaton's character are
having this inane conversation while their real thoughts run across
the bottom of the screen.</TE>
<TE>   That way, we could learn that the station wagon that just cut us
off is really "single mom, 3 kids, late for job intvw" or the driver
of the BMW that has changed lanes 15 times in as many minutes is
"about to turn 50, not coping well" or the Miata with a tendency to
drift "just met woman of her dreams, and her husband."</TE>
<TE>   Which doesn't really excuse road behavior that could get someone
killed, but it might make it a bit easier for the rest of us to
understand.</TE>

<HD>Glitter Taps Into a Golden Trend</HD>
<DH>Style* Adding sparkles to clothes and accessories has wide
appeal for preteen girls who call the fashionable look a form of
self-expression.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SARAH HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Girls' clothing stores these days look almost like discos.</LD>
<LD>   Glitter is everywhere--on T-shirts, jeans, accessories and pajamas
and even "lifestyle products" such as phones and picture frames--for
the tween-age consumer.</LD>
<LD>   "I like glitter [on clothes]. It expresses me," said Katie
Bujalski, 12, of Thomaston, Conn.</LD>
<TE>   In the last five years, it seems every mall in America has at
least one store--a Limited Too, a Zutopia, a Claire's--for tweens.
From the start, they've been liberally sprinkled with glitter. Even
the discount and department stores such as Wal-Mart have created
sections for tweens, ages 8 to 12, so named because they are between
being children and teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   Tweens, like teens, want to express their budding individuality
and don't want to be seen as little kids, designers say. Glitter is
the transition look between the Crayola-bright colors of childhood
and the muted hues of older teens.</TE>
<TE>   Touches of glitter in the clothing "give just enough of a special
quality without being overdone," said Joanne Arbuckle, children's
wear expert at the Fashion Institute of Technology.</TE>
<TE>   There's good retail sense in making tweens feel special. They are
among the largest demographic group of children today, according to a
recent study by Pennsylvania State University. It estimated that
tweens spend $36 billion in retail sales annually and influence $290
billion in purchases made by their parents.</TE>
<TE>   Tweens in training see echoes of the glitter boom in their own
clothes. For example, there are touches of glitter on clothing even
at the Children's Place and Baby Gap, which focus on children younger
than 8.</TE>
<TE>   "We use what the fashion trends are, but we keep it
age-appropriate," said Andrea McClarren, marketing communications
manager for the Children's Place. With glitter, "each item [becomes]
special and unique, giving it a little more of its own personality."</TE>
<TE>   Age-appropriate is a moving target. Fashions once questionable
even for young teenagers--hip-hugger jeans, body and hair glitter,
attitude T-shirts with rhinestone messages such as "naughty girl" and
belly shirts--are now offered to tweens.</TE>
<TE>   It's not unusual to hear mothers debating clothing choices with
daughters in the tween stores or setting rules such as no body
glitter in school.</TE>
<TE>   "What we find in [Limited Too], we agree on. Flashy, I don't mind;
revealing, forget it," said Denise Bujalski, recently shopping at a
Limited Too with daughter, Katie.</TE>
<TE>   According to a recent McCall's magazine survey, 77% of mothers
blame performers, including Britney Spears, for the almost
costume-like trends in tween clothing.</TE>
<TE>   "They are the obvious choices," Bujalski said, citing Spears and
Christina Aguilera as influences. "But now it is all around--TV
commercials, everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Retailers defend fashions as what the tweens want.</TE>
<TE>   "The fashion industry is not trying to play parent; [the final
say] is still up to the parents," Arbuckle said.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Atkinson, director of investor relations for Limited Too,
said most tweens must have their parents' approval before they buy
clothes, and parent input is apparent in the choices that are made.</TE>
<TE>   "While we do have hip-huggers and low-slung jeans, our most
popular items are knit bottoms that any mother in America wouldn't
mind their daughter wearing," Atkinson said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at our store, month in and month out, the
bestselling items are graphic tees [T-shirts with pictures, phrases
or a logo] and basic bottoms," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Limited Too's clothing line is not only designed with fashion
in mind, but it also takes into consideration the shopper's age.
Glitter, rhinestones and shiny threaded fabric make tween fashion
distinctive and special.</TE>
<TE>   Will this tween trend in glitter last?</TE>
<TE>   "The tween market directly follows the junior market. If it's hot
in the junior market, it becomes hot for tweens," Arbuckle said.
Right now "in the junior market, we are trying to stay relatively
conservative."</TE>
<TE>   Soon, the glitter may be fading from tween lives.</TE>

<LD>Push the Button When You Want to Cross</LD>
<LD>   Otto the Auto is a robotic car that visits classes throughout
Southern California, free of charge. Otto teaches children about
traffic safety through songs, blinking headlights and friendly
presentations in English and Spanish. Today he talks to Amanda about
pushing the button before crossing the street.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Amanda frowned as she stood on the street corner near the
stoplight. She watched the cars speed past for several turns of the
light before her friend, Otto the Auto, drove up.</TE>
<TE>   "Hi, Amanda," Otto said. "Why the long face?"</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, Otto, I'm so happy to see you," Amanda said. "I want to cross
the street on the green light like my mom and dad tell me, but there
is a red hand sign that tells me not to cross. I don't know what to
do."</TE>
<TE>   "Don't be frustrated, Amanda," Otto said. "When you come to a
corner like this, you have to push the button if you want to cross.
When it is safe, a white-colored sign showing a walking man will
flash, telling you that it's safe to cross. Sometimes the word 'walk'
flashes in white. Of course, you still need to look both ways for
moving cars, even if you get the sign that it's OK to cross."</TE>
<TE>   "But I've seen the red hand flash when I'm in the middle of
crossing the street. What do I do then?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a good question," Otto said. "If you start crossing when
the white signal showing the walking man is flashing, you will have
enough time to walk across. If the red hand flashes while you are in
the middle of crossing, you should continue quickly to the other
side. But you should never step into the crosswalk and start to cross
if the red hand is up, or a red 'don't walk' sign is flashing. That's
not safe."</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks, Otto," Amanda said after she pushed the button. "As soon
as I see the walking man, I'll be the walking girl!"</TE>
<TE>   Principals can arrange for Otto to visit schools by contacting the
Automobile Club of Southern California at (714) 885-2317. Visit
Otto's Web site at www.aaa-calif.com/otto for information and fun
activities for kids.</TE>

lemon, pepper and salt, ketchup, olive oil and a speck of onion.
Andrew tried the recipe and he got sick. Read the book to find out

<LD>Advice for Latinas from "The Latina Bible," Three Rivers Press, 2002.</LD>
<LD>   On crossing cultural and generational gaps:</LD>
<LD>   "When you find yourself making decisions that run counter to
cultural expectations, my advice is to approach the situation as the
Dalai Lama would--with gentle compassion. Gentle compassion, chicas,
means to recognize and honor the path your parents have walked, the
struggles they have survived, and the era they grew up in. Never
forget where they came from. Try on their shoes and empathize with
the shock, the fear, and the emptiness they experience as they see
their grown daughter live with strange and 'foreign' values. Wanting
your own space does not mean you do not respect your culture."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On Latina beauty:</TE>
<TE>   "I got to college and discovered that Mami's skinny hija
[daughter] was really a chunky boricua [Puerto Rican] in a gringo
world! That strange world outside of my barrio and family suddenly
stripped my chunkiness and rotund derriere of their attractiveness.
Unfortunately, it was my first time away from home, and my desire to
fit in was so intense that instead of questioning these new cultural
standards, I adopted them as my own--I started a war against my 'big'
butt and thighs. And it made me feel schizophrenic; too flaca [thin]
in the barrio and too gorda [fat] downtown. Where were Selena and J.
Lo back then, when I needed them?"</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Morrell's "Long Lost" (Warner, $25.95, 310 pages) is the sort
of compelling yarn you open at bedtime to sample the first few pages
and wind up wide-eyed at 3 a.m. wondering how the darn thing's going
to end.</LD>
<LD>   Here's the hook: Protagonist Brad Denning has a beautiful wife, a
terrific young son, a promising career. But he has not been able to
shake the guilt that has plagued him for decades, ever since he told
his kid brother Petey to stop bothering him and get lost. Taking him
a bit too literally, Petey never made it home again.</LD>
<LD>   His disappearance eventually destroyed the family, and Brad has
never been able to forgive himself. When a pleasant-enough homeless
man shows up, claiming to be Petey, Brad is dubious, but the guy has
all the right answers. No sooner is he accepted as the long-lost
little bro, the self-proclaimed Petey goes homicidal, shoving Brad
off a cliff and kidnapping the wife and son. Adding to the fears of
the badly damaged but recovering Brad, the largely disinterested FBI
agent assigned to the case tells him the perp is not his brother but
a serial killer who has eluded the agency for years.</LD>
<TE>   By this point, roughly the first fourth of the novel, Morrell has
delivered a model suspense thriller, earning enough goodwill to draw
us past the not-quite-enthralling section in which, like the author's
most famous creation, Rambo (yes, that Rambo, the hero of his 1972
novel, "First Blood"), Brad buffs up and rides out for vengeance.
Thankfully, that mood passes and the book shifts back to thriller
mode zooming on to its inevitable showdown, delivering a fair measure
of detection and application of logic and some genuinely suspenseful
moments along the way. Anyone with a serious fear of snakes should
probably avoid chapters seven and eight.</TE>
<TE>   A Hard-Boiled Collection Featuring an All-Star Cast</TE>
<TE>   In his introduction to the trade paperback anthology "A Century of
Noir" (NAL, $15, 521 pages), Max Allan Collins describes his
co-editor, Mickey Spillane, as "the most famous living mystery
writer," a claim that's difficult to dispute. He also states that
most of the 32 tales in the collection "are hard-boiled enough to
chip a tooth on." Again, fairly indisputable. It's definitely an
all-star affair with the likes of Ross Macdonald ("Guilt-Edged
Blonde"), John D. MacDonald ("Murder for Money"), Evan Hunter ("Dead
Men Don't Dream"), James M. Cain ("Cigarette Girl") and Chester Himes
("The Meanest Cop in the World") at the top of their respective
forms. Also well-represented are such current favorites as Lawrence
Block ("How Would You Like It?"), Sarah Paretsky ("Grace Notes") and
Marsha Muller ("Deceptions").</TE>
<TE>   The co-editors have chosen well from their own stock on hand, too.
Spillane's "Tomorrow I Die" is a mordant novelette with a surprise
ending; Collins' "Kaddish for the Kid" features popular sleuth Nate
Heller in a '30s-era tale that, as is the case with the Hellers,
mixes crime fact with crime fiction.</TE>
<TE>   Law Enforcer Becomes a Villain Targeting Lawyers</TE>
<TE>   There's a welcome air of edgy humor that sharpens Taffy Cannon's
"Open Season on Lawyers" (Daniel &amp; Daniel/Perseverance Press, $13.95
trade paperback, 288 pages). You can sense the fun to come from the
first sentences of the book: "Somebody was killing the sleazy lawyers
of Los Angeles. In the beginning, hardly anybody noticed."</TE>
<TE>   Cannon's two leads here are hard-boiled LAPD robbery-homicide Det.
Joanna Davis and her resourceful nemesis, Ace, also known as the
Atterminator, whose prey are attorneys who push the limits of the
law.</TE>
<TE>   The author moves the action from law enforcer to lawbreaker with
easy grace, but the action seems to be weighed in favor of the
villain who bumps off the liars for hire using original murder
devices that call attention to their most successful legal
loophole-picking. The lawyers are such an unlovely group that it's
almost impossible not to sympathize with the "Atterminator."</TE>
<TE>   Essay Fest Highlights 'Forgotten' Selections</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Jim Huang, editor of the Drood Review, one of the
better newsletters devoted to the subject of crime fiction, published
"100 Favorite Mysteries of the Century," a series of that many essays
written by members of the Independent Mystery Booksellers Assn. Now,
Huang is back with another trade paperback essay fest, "They Died in
Vain" (Crum Creek Press, $13, 192 pages), calling attention to, as
the subhead puts it, "Overlooked, Underappreciated and Forgotten
Mystery Novels."</TE>
<TE>   There are some surprising selections among the 103 tales. One
doesn't think of Vera Caspary's "Laura" or George Pelecanos' "The Big
Blowdown" as being particularly overlooked or forgotten, but the
comments about them are smart and on point. And any book serving as a
reminder of the joys to be found in titles such as the deliriously
witty "Fast Company," by the late screenwriter Harry Kurnitz, using
his "Marco Page" moniker, or Richard S. Prather's hard-boiled and
hilarious West Coast reply to Mickey Spillane, "The Wailing Frail,"
belongs on every mystery fan's reading list.</TE>

<HD>Shipping, Handling Charges Can Send a Consumer Into a
Frenzy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JURA KONCIUS</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last week, I smashed into the kitchen stove with a loaded laundry
basket. Off popped the front-right burner knob. The plastic cracked
as it hit the floor.</LD>
<LD>   Ouch. Here I was trying to complete one dreary domestic chore, and
I had created another: buying a replacement knob.</LD>
<LD>   The employee who answered at General Electric Appliance Part Sales
told me my accident would cost $18.82: $11.85 for the plastic knob,
$1.02 tax and a whopping $5.95 for shipping. Ordering from
www.geappliances.com would cost the same. So there was my choice: I
could use a pair of pliers to fire up the gas, or I could shell out
half the cost of the part to have a replacement knob sent Fed Ex
ground from Cranbury, N.J.</LD>
<TE>   L.L. Bean once offered free shipping, a policy it discontinued in
1991. But as the cost of postage has risen, so have shipping and
handling charges, to the point where delivery can cost more than the
item. (We're not even talking about fancy overnight options.)</TE>
<TE>   Since catalog sales in the United States have been growing at
twice the rate of regular retail, according to the Direct Marketing
Assn., the tacked-on cost doesn't seem to be deterring shoppers.</TE>
<TE>   I did an informal survey. There is quite a range in how much
companies charge to get an item into your living room. Let's consider
typical shipping and handling charges for a $150 item: L.L. Bean
would charge $10.95; Garnet Hill, $11.95; Talbots, $13; Martha by
Mail, $14.95; Sundance, $15.95; Smith &amp; Hawken, $18.95; Bombay, $21.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of diversity in how companies set charges," said
Amy Blankenship, spokeswoman for the marketers' association, which
has 5,000 member companies. "It's a business decision on what they
want to cover. Some build it into the price of the product." She
added, "Postage, shipping or handling charges should bear a
reasonable relationship to actual costs incurred."</TE>
<TE>   The best Web sites have shipping information clearly listed as a
FAQ (frequently asked question), but on some you can't find mailing
or shipping charges until you take your "shopping cart" to
checkout--after filling out billing address, shipping address,
telephone numbers and credit-card information. Catalog Age cited
research that online shopping carts were frequently abandoned because
frustrated consumers had no way of deciphering shipping costs without
going through the checkout. Count me in.</TE>
<TE>   Also, according to Catalog Age magazine, the direct-mail industry
is gearing up for a June 30 postal rate hike that increases costs 7%
to 10%.</TE>
<TE>   Some firms offer loyal customers a break. When L.L. Bean canned
free shipping, it quietly offered it to L.L. Bean credit-card
customers. From time to time, retailers offer free shipping for
orders over a certain dollar amount.</TE>
<TE>   The GE public-relations machine did all it could to make me feel
better about paying $5.95 to send a knob the size of an Oreo. Terry
Dunn, General Electric Appliances general manager for global
communications, said: "This price includes the labor associated with
pulling the part off a bin, packaging it up and putting a label on it
and preparing it for delivery." Dunn cited the complexities in
keeping parts in stock in five major warehouses across the country
for more than 200 million GE appliances. GE ships 10 million to 20
million orders a year from each warehouse. "There are a lot of
carrying costs associated with this business," said Dunn. "We make a
profit on the spare part, and you expect that we would." OK, OK. Even
GE deserves to make a profit.</TE>
<TE>   Blankenship pointed out that consumers shop from home for
convenience and for variety not found in local stores. "You may be
saving money because you aren't spending on gas, parking or impulse
buys at the mall," she said.</TE>
<TE>   I still felt ripped off. I weighed the GE envelope and knob--1.8
ounces, requiring 57 cents' postage; the padded envelope cost about
31 cents. At a downtown Fed Ex office, I was told it would cost $3.25
to ship the knob to Cranbury. Hmm. OK, fine. I had to pay the salary
of that hard-working warehouse employee.</TE>
<TE>   I finally pushed the new knob onto the stove. The darn thing
sticks out more than the other three knobs. Maybe I'll just charge GE
for gas to drive up there and get another one.</TE>

<LD>I washed my hands and slipped into one of Boody's yellow aprons so I
could help her behind the counter of the doughnut shop. We walked
over to a funny-looking machine. It had a big metal arm sticking out
the side.</LD>
<LD>   "You're gonna fill all these jelly doughnuts for me," she said,
giggling.</LD>
<LD>   "I am?"</LD>
<TE>   "Yep," Boody said. "I've got too many customers and not enough
time." She pointed at the five customers and laughed.</TE>
<TE>   Boody poured a bottle of sticky red stuff inside the machine.
"Let's start with berry filling," she said. "Now stick a doughnut on
this prong here and pull down the lever just once."</TE>
<TE>   I watched her stick on the doughnut and pull the handle as the
filling shot right into the side of the doughnut. Boody placed it on
a rack to cool.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be out with the lions," she yelled.</TE>
<TE>   I looked over at Boody as I worked. She seemed to dance her way
through the shop, stopping at each table to fill coffee cups and talk
to her customers. I imagined her like a ray of sunlight on a cold,
stormy day.</TE>
<TE>   I must have held down the lever too long. Before I knew it, the
sticky red filling shot out from the machine like lava from an
erupted volcano.</TE>
<TE>   "Uh-oh," I said. "I need some help."</TE>

<HD>Gateway Junk Ratings Are Cut Two Levels</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gateway Inc. had its junk ratings cut two levels by Moody's Investors
Service because of concern about the personal computer maker's
ability to lift sales and reduce costs enough to return to
profitability soon.</LD>
<LD>   The company's senior unsecured debt was lowered to Ba3, the
third-highest junk rating, from Ba1. Standard &amp; Poor's two weeks ago
reduced Gateway's credit rating to B-plus, the fourth-highest junk
level.</LD>
<LD>   Gateway shipped 645,000 PCs in the U.S. in the first quarter, a
30% drop from a year ago. Its market share fell to 5.8% from 8.3%,
according to research firm Dataquest Inc., while rival Dell Computer
Corp. lifted its share to 26.3%.</LD>
<TE>   Gateway began its biggest-ever ad campaign this year and is
redesigning its PCs with sleeker looks to help regain market share.</TE>
<TE>   Debt-rating changes are "irrelevant" to the company's strategy,
Gateway spokeswoman Ashley Wood said. "We have no long- term debt and
don't intend to incur any in the near future. Our projected growth is
not capital intensive." Gateway has $1.2 billion in cash and
marketable securities and an unused $300-million bank line maturing
in 2004, Moody's noted.</TE>

<HD>Senate Committee Chides Enron Board</HD>
<DH>Energy: Directors' failure to heed warnings about
accounting practices underscored during hearing on the firm's
collapse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Enron Corp.'s board of directors--which has insisted that it was kept
in the dark about the energy company's financial problems--was warned
in early 1999 that the company's accounting practices "push limits,"
according to documents released Tuesday during a hearing about the
board's role in Enron's collapse.</LD>
<LD>   But the board ignored the warning and other red flags because the
directors were reluctant to challenge and question the executive
officers of the once-hot company, lawmakers said.</LD>
<LD>   Even after learning from newspaper accounts in October 2001 that
the company's chief financial officer had pocketed millions of
dollars by running off-the-books partnerships, board members
hesitated to broach the topic. They asked Enron attorneys to script a
set of questions that they could ask and began the session by
thanking Chief Finanacial Officer Andrew Fastow for his "willingness
to visit with us," documents show.</LD>
<TE>   "You can't get more deferential and obsequious than that," said
Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), chairman of the Senate permanent
subcommittee on investigations, which is looking into Enron's
collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Levin said the committee is investigating possible
insider trading by a former senior Enron officer who asked his stock
broker to sell some of his Enron holdings shortly before the company
released its Oct. 16 earnings report, in which Enron first disclosed
a $1.2-billion charge against equity, related to the Fastow
partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we may want to sell some [Enron] calls in the next few
days before earnings are released," the executive wrote Oct. 2. "I
don't know anything, but I know how [Enron] works and I'm sure they
will be able to show strong recurring earnings, but with the market
where it is and the stock where it is, I expect them to take that
opportunity and do some housecleaning on some non-productive assets."</TE>
<TE>   At the time he wrote the e-mail, the executive was in the process
of leaving Enron, Levin said. He declined to identify the man, but
said the committee may refer the matter to the Securities and
Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   During a daylong hearing, Levin and other lawmakers chided five of
Enron's current and former board members for failing to protect
investors by keeping tabs on the company's complex financial dealings
and standing up to management.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) called some of the board's actions
"extraordinarily irresponsible," particularly in light of the fact
that board members profited handsomely from Enron stock sales and
other compensation, averaging $329,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   "The board of directors didn't just fiddle while Enron burned,"
Lieberman said. "They toasted marshmallows over the flames."</TE>
<TE>   Enron directors defended their record, shifting blame to Enron
managers and Arthur Andersen, which audited the company's books.</TE>
<TE>   Several also said it was unrealistic to expect part-time board
members to uncover hidden problems in a large, complex corporation
such as Enron.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot, I submit, be criticized for failing to address or
remedy problems that were concealed from us," said Herbert Winokur
Jr., who chaired the board's finance committee.</TE>
<TE>   Levin tried to show that the board did, in fact, receive several
warnings, including one from former Andersen auditor David Duncan,
who told the board's audit committee in February 1999 that some of
Enron's accounting practices were risky.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Jaedicke, former audit committee chair, said he did not
recall the specific warning, but conceded that the board had been
told on several occasions that Enron's practices were complex and
risky. He said the board relied heavily on Andersen's professional
judgment.</TE>

<HD>Broadcom Shares Fall After Contract Is Lost</HD>
<DH>Tech: Stock tumbles 17% on news of rival Texas Instruments'
deal with Motorola.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of semiconductor designer Broadcom Corp. tumbled 17% on
Tuesday after Motorola Inc., a major customer, selected a competitor
to provide additional chips for its next-generation cable modem.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Irvine-based Broadcom fell $5.22, to $24.72, in Nasdaq
trading after falling as low as $24.51 earlier in the session.</LD>
<LD>   The news weighed heavily on the shares, but Broadcom Chief
Financial Officer William Ruehle said the agreement between Motorola
and Broadcom rival Texas Instruments Inc. will not hurt his company's
revenue.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not replacing Broadcom business," Ruehle said. "This would
have no impact on our expectations going forward."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Tuesday, Motorola said it chose Texas Instruments, the
world's largest supplier of semiconductors for mobile phones, to
power its newest cable product.</TE>
<TE>   Motorola is one of Broadcom's largest customers, accounting for
about 14% of sales, said Frost Securities analyst Cody Acree. The
announcement raised concern that Texas Instruments could become a
larger competitive threat to Broadcom, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like they have lost a design win at Motorola's cable
business," Acree said. "It is not an immediate impact, but over the
next few quarters Motorola is going to be a major player in the cable
modem business."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Dallas-based Texas Instruments rose as much as 2.4% on
the news but closed down 4 cents, to $27.51, on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Ruehle said Motorola had been planning to bring on an additional
supplier of chips and that an agreement with another competitor,

<HD>Clear Channel Beats Forecasts</HD>
<DH>Media: Biggest U.S. radio company's quarterly loss widens
as a result of acquisitions, though not by as much as predicted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY M. SANDERS</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clear Channel Communications Inc., the biggest U.S. radio company,
had a first-quarter loss of $16.9 billion after writing down the
value of acquired assets. But the company's sales and profit before
the write-offs beat forecasts, boosting Clear Channel's shares.</LD>
<LD>   Clear Channel's loss widened to $27.85 a share from a loss of
$309.2million, or 53 cents, in the year-ago period, Chief Financial
Officer Randall Mays said. Sales in the latest quarter rose 4% to
$1.7billion. Excluding the acquisition costs, Clear Channel's profit
would have been $90.3million.</LD>
<LD>   Clear Channel, the owner of 1,200 radio stations in U.S. cities
including New York and Los Angeles, said the advertising market is
beginning to recover after the recession crimped spending last year.
Radio ad sales are forecast to rise at a low- to mid-single-digit
percentage rate this quarter, Chief Executive Lowry Mays said.</LD>
<TE>   "The most important thing is that they pushed up guidance for the
second quarter," said Angela Kohler, who manages about $450million
for the Federated Large Cap Growth Fund, the owner of 150,000 Clear
Channel shares. "Certainly, it casts a good halo over the entire
industry."</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel shares rose $1.54 Tuesday to $46.66 on the New York
Stock Exchange. They have fallen 15% in the last year. The San
Antonio-based company also is the world's biggest concert promoter,
and its programming assets include Rush Limbaugh's syndicated talk
show.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel is the latest in a string of media businesses taking
merger-related write-downs. AOL Time Warner Inc. last month reported
the biggest quarterly loss in U.S. history after reducing the value
of acquired assets by $54 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel became the biggest U.S. radio company when it bought
AMFM Inc. for almost $24billion in stock and assumed debt in August
2000. The company wrote down the value of acquired assets by $17
billion in the recent quarter after adopting an accounting rule
change.</TE>
<TE>   The rule change requires companies to review periodically the
value of goodwill, or the difference between the purchase price of an
asset and its fair market value. Companies record an expense if the
value has declined.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone understands it as an accounting change," Chief Operating
Officer Mark Mays said, referring to the write-down. "It's an
irrelevant number."</TE>
<TE>   Mays said the firm pared its debt to $9 billion in the first
quarter from $9.5 billion at the end of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding the write-down and a gain of 3 cents a share from the
sale of a TV license and debt repayment, Clear Channel would have had
profit of 12 cents a share in the quarter. On that basis, the firm
was expected to earn 8 cents on sales of $1.57 billion, the average
estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>

<HD>Group Challenges Comcast's AT&amp;T Bid</HD>
<DH>Cable: Consumer Federation asks local regulators to oppose
deal, saying rates will rise, service deteriorate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Opponents of Comcast Corp.'s planned $72-billion purchase of AT&amp;T
Corp.'s cable television business are taking their case to local
regulators to get municipalities involved alongside federal reviews.</LD>
<LD>   The Consumer Federation of America asked officials in Cambridge,
Mass.; Dallas; Montgomery County, Md.; and San Francisco to oppose
the acquisition, research director Mark Cooper said. Cable companies
have to win approval from local authorities to operate in a given
area.</LD>
<LD>   A larger Comcast will lead to higher rates and poor service, the
consumer group says. Comcast says it will save money with the
acquisition and boost sales, allowing it to expand programming and
services while limiting rate increases for basic cable television.</LD>
<TE>   "Quality will deteriorate as call centers move farther away,"
Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington-based Consumer Federation is made up of 280
consumer groups, including the American Assn. of Retired Persons, and
represents about 50 million members, Cooper said. It plans to file
complaints with regulators in other cities, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission are
reviewing the deal between New York-based AT&amp;T and Philadelphia-based
Comcast. The new company would have 22 million customers in more than
40 states.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Comcast fell 15 cents to $30.10 on Nasdaq. AT&amp;T fell 20
cents to $13.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Comcast spokeswoman Karen Dougherty Buchholz and AT&amp;T spokesman
Jim McGann declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The companies will need to spend time and energy resolving
consumer complaints and may need to agree to some conditions demanded
by local regulators, said Jimmy Schaeffler, chief executive of
research firm Carmel Group.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll just be a nuisance," he said. "They may have to give up
some concessions."</TE>
<TE>   The effort probably won't block the combination, said Schaeffler
and Maria Kovacs, an analyst at Commerce Capital Markets Inc.</TE>

<HD>Shooting Off Studio Lots Down in April</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shooting of films, TV shows, commercials and music videos on the
streets of Los Angeles continued to slide in April compared with a
year earlier, when production was in high gear as studios prepared
for potential strikes.</LD>
<LD>   The number of shooting permit days granted by the Entertainment
Industry Development Corp. fell 11% from a year earlier to 2,622,
according to the agency. The biggest drop was in feature film
permits, which fell 47% to 694 shooting days.</LD>
<LD>   TV and commercial indicators both rose, with the number of TV
permit days rising 23% to 1,299 and commercial days up 16% to 476.</LD>
<TE>   One permit day represents a single day of shooting on a project.
The numbers measure shooting only outside studio lots, where permits
aren't required. But the permit figures are considered a barometer of
overall local production activity.</TE>
<TE>   The lower film numbers reflect a change from the accelerated
production schedules a year ago when studios rushed to finish
projects as potential writer and actor strikes loomed.</TE>
<TE>   Although no strikes occurred, production on films has been
markedly slow since last summer because studios have a large number
of films in the can.</TE>

<HD>Sale of KCAL to Viacom Is Approved</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Viacom Inc., owner of the CBS and UPN television networks, won
approval from U.S. regulators to buy KCAL-TV in Los Angeles from
Young Broadcasting Inc. for $650 million.</LD>
<LD>   Viacom will own two stations in Los Angeles, the No.2 TV market in
the nation, when the transaction is complete.</LD>
<LD>   Viacom, based in New York, has six months to sell one of seven
radio stations in the Los Angeles area to comply with ownership
rules, the Federal Communications Commission said in a decision
Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   KCAL is the sixth-ranked station by sales in the Los Angeles area,
Viacom has said. Viacom has two TV stations in each of seven U.S.
cities and is seeking similar combinations to reach more viewers and
boost advertising rates.</TE>
<TE>   Viacom has said KCAL, which doesn't carry programs by networks
such as CBS, will remain an independent station when the purchase is
completed this year.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Viacom, the third-largest U.S. media company, fell 15
cents to $46.29 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of New
York-based Young Broadcasting fell 90 cents to $23.05 in Nasdaq
trading.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Sputter to End Day Mixed</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Blue chips manage to post gains, but Fed's
decision to leave rates unchanged troubles investors. Tech- sector
sell-off extends.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blue-chip stocks scraped out gains Tuesday as worker productivity
raced ahead at its fastest clip in almost 19 years. But the broader
market slumped after the Federal Reserve stood pat on interest rates
and reinforced investors' fears of a tepid economic recovery.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think it is a bear market. It is a crisis of confidence,"
said Stanley Nabi, managing director at Credit Suisse Asset
Management. "We are burdened with a lot of problems, particularly in
the area of technology and telecoms."</LD>
<LD>   Stocks weakened in the last half hour of trading and pushed the
Nasdaq composite index into negative territory, stretching the
tech-laden index's losing streak to five sessions.</LD>
<TE>   Investors, shaken by Monday's strong sell-off, held off on making
large bets ahead of quarterly earnings from Cisco Systems, the
world's biggest maker of the gear that powers the Internet. Cisco
reported after the market closed that quarterly profit more than
tripled last year's weak results and beat Wall Street estimates.</TE>
<TE>   In after-hours trading, Cisco shares jumped to $14.70 after
closing at $13.08, up 13 cents, in regular trading. The Nasdaq 100
after-hours indicator rallied more than 2.3%, boding well for today's
market.</TE>
<TE>   The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average rose 28.51 points, or
0.3%, to 9,836.55, failing to hold on to an earlier 111-point gain.
The Nasdaq lost 4.66 points, to 1,573.82, also shedding earlier
gains. The broad Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index slipped 3.18 points, or
0.3%, to 1,049.49.</TE>
<TE>   Losers beat winners by 9 to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange and
10 to 7 on Nasdaq. Trading was active.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq has fallen 7.3% over the last five trading days and is
now down 19.3% for the year, having lost ground in seven of the last
eight weeks on fears that weak spending by corporate customers has
stunted growth across most of the technology industry.</TE>
<TE>   "There's definitely concern with the precipitous decline we've
had," said Robert Cohen, a head trader for Credit Suisse First
Boston. "It's not encouraging."</TE>
<TE>   Pharmaceutical stocks were the biggest drag on the S&amp;P 500 after
Senate Democrats introduced legislation that would limit tax
deductions for marketing to what drug makers' spend on research.
Johnson &amp; Johnson declined $1.68 to $60.42, Wyeth fell $1.19 to
$53.99, and Bristol-Myers Squibb dropped 83 cents to $28.01. Pfizer
lost 80 cents to $35.75.</TE>
<TE>   Fed policymakers voted unanimously to keep the key federal funds
rate for overnight loans between banks at 1.75%--helping along the
patchy economic recovery with cheap borrowing costs for consumers and
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Fed policymakers cited an uncertain outlook for
spending growth and said risks remained balanced between inflation
and recession. Many analysts now say it is unlikely the Fed will
begin raising rates before August at the earliest.</TE>
<TE>   An 8.6% surge in worker productivity had helped lift the market
before the Fed decision. Productivity grew in the first quarter at
the fastest rate in almost 19 years as firms squeezed more out of
their work force instead of adding new hires in the tepid economy,
the government said.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news:</TE>
<TE>   * Insurers were the second-biggest losers on the S&amp;P 500. MetLife
dropped $2.29 to $31.86. Including money the biggest U.S. life
insurer set aside to cover the expected settlement of a Medicare
probe, earnings were below analyst expectations and some investors
said they are skeptical the company can meet 2002 estimates. American
International lost $1.90 to $67.65. The decline in insurance shares
follows comments investor Warren Buffett made at Berkshire Hathaway's
annual meeting over the weekend in which he discussed potential
losses from future terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   * Semiconductor designer Broadcom tumbled 17%, or $5.22, to $24.72
after Motorola, a major customer, selected a competitor to create its
next-generation cable modem.</TE>
<TE>   * Georgia-Pacific climbed 5 cents to $29.85 after saying it plans
to split into two and sell stock in its consumer products and
packaging business as part of a spinoff from its building-products
unit, which is plagued by asbestos liabilities.</TE>
<TE>   * Leading grocery supplies distributor Fleming jumped $2.38 to
$24.83. The company posted an increase of nearly 60% in quarterly
profit as improved business efficiencies and cost controls helped
results.</TE>
<TE>   * Manugistics Group, which had been one of the few bright spots in
the business-to-business software sector, plunged 33% after
executives said quarterly license revenue was running slightly behind
their target. Its stock ended down $4.05, or 33%, at $9.11.</TE>

<HD>Merrill Lynch Makes Settlement Offer</HD>
<DH>Securities: Proposal to New York's attorney general is said
to include fine, preventive measures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to bring an end to the latest investment industry scandal,
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. on Tuesday made a settlement offer to the New
York attorney general, who is accusing the firm's Internet analysts
of making supposedly unbiased public pronouncements that failed to
reflect their private scorn for many companies.</LD>
<LD>   Sources said Merrill's proposal addresses Atty. Gen. Eliot
Spitzer's demands that the firm pay a large fine, accept blame for
deceptive practices and make changes to ensure analysts aren't
skewing their findings to drum up lucrative business for Merrill
bankers working on stock and bond issues and takeover deals.</LD>
<LD>   The last demand is the trickiest, because Merrill had insisted its
analysts and investment bankers benefit mutually from working
together, but a Spitzer report that brought the case to public
attention last month said the analysts had become "tainted and
biased" by association with the investment-banking business.</LD>
<TE>   Sources said Merrill was adamant that any restraints on
analyst-banker relationships must be applied equally to the industry.
Though that also is Spitzer's stated goal, it required consultation
with the Securities and Exchange Commission on workable standards and
complex negotiations on how to guarantee other firms will adopt the
standards.</TE>
<TE>   "We're definitely making progress," said Spitzer spokesman Juanita
Scarlett, noting that a court hearing scheduled for Thursday had been
postponed until May 16 to give the two sides more time to negotiate
"because we are involved in productive discussions."</TE>
<TE>   At the hearing, a step toward filing civil or criminal fraud
charges, Spitzer is expected to schedule public testimony by Merrill
luminaries such as top Internet analyst Henry Blodget.</TE>
<TE>   In an example of a series of e-mails obtained by Spitzer's office,
Blodget referred to the stock of Internet firm InfoSpace Inc. as "a
piece of junk" in October 2000, when the Pasadena company was on
Merrill's "Favored 15" list of top stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill contends the communications have been taken out of
context, characterizing the often obscene comments as verbal banter
of the sort typical not only of investment firms but of, say, police
stations or newsrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch's stock fell 21 cents to $40.80 Tuesday, bringing
its decline to 24% in the month since Spitzer made his allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer has subpoenaed other securities firms, while the SEC, the
National Assn. of Securities Dealers and the New York Stock Exchange
also have investigated the analyst conflict issue.</TE>
<TE>   The case against the investment firm is being watched closely by
the brokerage industry and private attorneys, who regard Spitzer's
findings as free ammunition for hundreds of claims contending
investors were victimized by misleading research and abuses involving
initial public offerings.</TE>

<HD>Judge Wants to View a Modular Windows</HD>
<DH>Antitrust: Over the objections of Microsoft, states will
offer a version with removable features.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The federal judge overseeing the Microsoft Corp. antitrust case said
Tuesday that she wants to see a version of the Windows operating
system that has removable features.</LD>
<LD>   Over the objections of Microsoft, U.S. District Judge Colleen
Kollar-Kotelly said she would allow nine states seeking stiff
sanctions against the company to have a computer expert demonstrate a
version of Windows he has developed that can be customized.</LD>
<LD>   Kollar-Kotelly scheduled the presentation for May 15.</LD>
<TE>   A modular version of Windows is a key demand of the nine states,
which have rejected a proposed settlement of the 4-year-old case as
too weak.</TE>
<TE>   The states say a modular version of Windows would level the
playing field for non-Microsoft software trying to compete with
Microsoft's continued practice of attaching features to the operating
system such as its Web browser and multimedia player.</TE>
<TE>   But the software giant says it would be technically impossible to
offer multiple versions of Windows and would create havoc for
consumers and the computer industry.</TE>
<TE>   The non-settling states told the judge that Virginia-based
computer testing consultant James Bach had built his modular version
of Windows using Microsoft's own technology.</TE>
<TE>   Bach, who has worked as a contractor for Microsoft, created the
new version using Windows XP Embedded, a commercial version of
Windows designed for specialty devices such as cash registers and
automated teller machines.</TE>
<TE>   Bach will testify that his modular version of Windows is "robust
and reliable," Kollar-Kotelly said, citing the states' submission.</TE>
<TE>   The states named Bach as one of two witnesses they want to call at
the end of the case to rebut some of Microsoft's arguments.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft attorneys strongly objected, saying the states should
have brought Bach into the trial earlier when they were presenting
their initial case.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft to Acquire Danish Software Firm</HD>
<DH>Technology: The company buys Navision for $1.3 billion to
boost its presence in Europe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>In a bid to extend its reach into small and mid-sized European
companies, Microsoft Corp. said Tuesday that it was acquiring the
Danish business software house Navision for $1.3 billion in cash and
stock.</LD>
<LD>   The acquisition would be Microsoft's second-largest after its
$1.5-billion purchase of U.S. graphic software maker Visio in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   The move parallels Microsoft's $1.1-billion acquisition in
December 2000 of Great Plains Software, based in Fargo, N.D.</LD>
<TE>   Both companies produce software for the same market, but analysts
said Great Plains has been unable to gain much of a foothold in
Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Navision has likewise failed to significantly penetrate the U.S.
market.</TE>
<TE>   The Danish company, with some 1,300 employees in 30 countries,
specializes in applications for enterprise resource planning, as well
as customer relationship and knowledge management.</TE>
<TE>   Customer relationship management programs allow a company to keep
track of its entire relationship with a customer.</TE>
<TE>   Besides recording purchases and notifying users of a customer's
service needs, it can link to a company's financial catalog to
provide sales estimates, discounts and cross-promotions, and can be
used to create a marketing database based on customers' buying
habits.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts saw the acquisition as a good strategic move for
Microsoft, which had been considerably less aggressive about pursuing
acquisitions during its antitrust trial, which is in its penalty
phase.</TE>
<TE>   "Considering the footprint they will cover globally, and the type
of products they'll be offering, it means great coverage for
Microsoft," said Ken Kiarash of Buckingham Research Group in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts expressed surprise at the relatively high price
Microsoft paid for the company--more than 6.5 times Navision's sales.</TE>
<TE>   As of the end of the first quarter, Microsoft had $38.7 billion in
cash, equivalents and short-term investments.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft shares gained 85 cents to $49.47 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Auction of 5-Year Treasury Notes Meets Strong Investor
Demand</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors snapped up a record $22 billion in five-year notes sold by
the government Tuesday, with demand exceeding the amount bid at the
last quarterly auction in February.</LD>
<LD>   With the number of bids exceeding the number of available
securities by 1.7 times, demand for the new five-year notes was the
highest since the government sold $16billion of the securities in
November. Investors were lured to the note's 4.475% yield, which
exceeds that on the current five-year note, 4.33%.</LD>
<LD>   "There was solid demand for the notes," said Chris Rupkey, senior
economist at Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi Ltd. "Dealers wish they could
price supply this well all the time."</LD>
<TE>   The yield on the notes sold Tuesday was the highest since Aug. 8,
2001, when the securities yielded 4.67%. At the February auction, the
notes yielded 4.254%.</TE>
<TE>   The government plans to follow up Tuesday's sale with an
$11-billion auction of 10-year notes today to help finance the first
budget deficit in five years. Instead of paying off $89 billion in
debt this quarter as projected in January, the government has said it
will have to borrow a net $1 billion as a recession crimps tax
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The securities will be used to refund about $9 billion in
privately held bonds and raise about $24 billion in cash, the
government said. This week's auctions are the largest since August
1999, when the government borrowed $37 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Buyers were attracted to the five-year notes because their yields
are well above the 1.75% federal funds rate, traders said, providing
banks and other lenders the opportunity to profit on the interest
rate spread.</TE>
<TE>   At 4.475%, the note also attracted investors on expectations that
the Federal Reserve will refrain from raising interest rates until at
least midyear, analysts said. A bigger-than-expected surge in
first-quarter productivity, reported Tuesday, supported that view. As
expected, policymakers left rates unchanged at a 40-year low of
1.75%.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's "productivity report shows that people are working more
and earning less," said Sadakichi Robbins, head of fixed-income sales
and trading at Bank Julius Baer. "Combined with the recent decline in
equities, that will lead to a loss of confidence and weaker final
demand in the second and third quarters. The Fed won't move until at
least September," making the securities "a good buy."</TE>

<HD>Cisco Beats Expectations; Shares Jump After Hours</HD>
<DH>Earnings: Technology giant reports first year-over-year
quarterly gain in more than a year amid cost-cutting efforts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN KLAYMAN</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cisco Systems Inc., the No. 1 maker of gear that directs Internet
traffic, Tuesday bounced back as cost-cutting efforts boosted its
quarterly earnings to more than triple last year's profit.</LD>
<LD>   Cisco shares rose to $14.70 in after-hours trading. They closed at
$13.08, up 19 cents, in regular Nasdaq trading before the results
were announced.</LD>
<LD>   The San Jose-based company said fiscal third-quarter earnings
before one-time items rose to $838million, or 11 cents a share, from
$230million, or 3 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter.</LD>
<TE>   It was the first year-over-year quarterly gain in more than a
year.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue in the third quarter ended April 27 rose 2% to $4.82
billion from $4.73 billion last year.</TE>
<TE>   Including one-time items, net income in the quarter rose to
$729million, or 10 cents a share, from a net loss of $2.7 billion, or
37 cents a share, a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   It also rose from the second quarter's net profit of $660 million,
or 9 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts were expecting Cisco to earn 9 cents a share, with a
range of estimates from 7 cents to 10 cents, according to Thomson
Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   "The earnings per share is a cent better, and that's solely to do
with cost cutting," said Justin McNichols, a portfolio manager with
Osborne Partners Capital Management in San Francisco. "Gross margins
looked stronger than we expected. That was a surprise."</TE>
<TE>   In other earnings news:</TE>
<TE>   * Activision Inc., the publisher of "Tony Hawk's Pro Skater" and
other video games, said its fiscal fourth-quarter profit increased
more than tenfold.</TE>
<TE>   Net income for the quarter ended March 31 rose to $10.9 million,
or 17 cents a share, from $875,000, or 2 cents, a year ago, the Santa
Monica-based company said. Sales rose 30% to $164.9 million from
$126.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Activision fell 70 cents to close at $30.65 in Nasdaq
trading before earnings were released.</TE>
<TE>   * IVillage Inc., an online network for women, Tuesday reported a
wider first-quarter net loss due to an accounting charge, but revenue
rose 20% from $12.6 million to $15.1 million as it charged users for
horoscopes and other services to offset the slump in advertising
sales.</TE>
<TE>   IVillage said its first-quarter net loss widened to $17.9 million,
or 34 cents a share, including a $9.2-million accounting charge for
goodwill, from $12.2 million, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier.
The number of outstanding shares doubled from the first quarter of
2001. IVillage shares fell 14 cents Tuesday to $1.62 in Nasdaq
trading.</TE>
<TE>   * WebMD Corp., which makes management software for medical
practices and runs health Web sites, said its first-quarter loss
narrowed to $29.6 million as expenses for acquisitions declined.</TE>
<TE>   The loss, equal to 9 cents a share, compares with a loss of
$1.04billion, or $2.91, a year earlier when the company had expenses
for writing down the value of acquisitions. Sales fell to $196.3
million from $202.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   WebMD's shares fell 2 cents Tuesday to close at $6.48 in Nasdaq
trading.</TE>
<TE>   * Internet software developer Starbase Corp. in Santa Ana reported
a net loss of $32.1 million, or 42 cents a share, for its fiscal
fourth quarter ended March 31, compared with a net loss of
$6.4million, or 11 cents a share, for last year's final three months.
Revenue declined 28% to $11.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   Starbase shares fell 5 cents Tuesday to close at 40 cents in
Nasdaq trading.</TE>
<TE>   * QLogic Corp. said fiscal fourth-quarter net income fell 26% as
customers reduced purchases of the company's circuit boards and
switches that link components in computer data-storage networks.</TE>
<TE>   Net income for the quarter ended March 31 was $18.7 million, or 20
cents a share, from $25.2 million, or 27 cents, a year earlier, the
company said in a statement. Sales fell 8.9% to $90.8 million from
$99.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the Aliso Viejo-based company rose as high as $40.80
after earnings were released. They fell $3.74, or 8.9%, to $38.26
during regular trading on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Bill Aims to Curb Drug Ads</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four Senate Democrats who hope to lower prescription-drug costs
introduced legislation that would limit what drug makers spend on
advertising by cutting their tax breaks for marketing costs.</LD>
<LD>   Firms are allowed to deduct advertising expenses and research and
development costs from their taxable income. The Senate bill would
limit the amount drug makers can deduct for advertising to what they
spend on research.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. prescription-drug spending rose 17% to $121.8 billion in
2000, fed by a boom in direct-to-consumer ads, a study says. Sen.
Debbie Stabenow, the bill's chief sponsor, said lawmakers shouldn't
expand Medicare's coverage of prescription drugs without controlling
the cost of medicines first.</LD>
<TE>   "This is no small issue," said Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat.
"Companies are on such shaky ground in terms of ... spending 2.5
times their research and development expenses on advertising, that we
have to press forward."</TE>

<HD>HP Begins Reforming Firm</HD>
<DH>Merger: In absorbing Compaq, the company reveals which
products will be phased out. Layoffs begin Monday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN BERGSTEIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Putting the drama of an acrimonious proxy fight in the past,
Hewlett-Packard Co. on Tuesday began the arduous process of absorbing
Compaq Computer Corp. in the computer industry's biggest merger.</LD>
<LD>   Standing in front of multi-colored panels bearing employee
pictures and the words "we are ready," the company's top executives
said HP and Compaq's Web sites have been combined and the 150,000
employees have been given "playbooks" explaining the transition.</LD>
<LD>   "Clearly, we are focused on building one strong new company, one
strong new team, one strong new culture, and teamwork is going to be
a very important aspect of our success," Chairwoman and Chief
Executive Carly Fiorina said at a news conference at an HP facility
in Cupertino, Calif.</LD>
<TE>   Fiorina and HP's new president, former Compaq CEO Michael
Capellas, answered one of the biggest questions surrounding the deal
by revealing which products will remain and which will be phased out
over the next three years.</TE>
<TE>   In the home personal-computer market, HP's and Compaq's brands
will continue to be sold, but in business-focused desktops and
notebooks, Compaq models will replace HP's. HP's Jornada hand-held
computer is being phased out in favor of Compaq's iPaq line of mobile
devices.</TE>
<TE>   In computer servers that run Web sites and data centers, HP will
combine technology contributed by each company, such as Compaq's
high-performance computing capabilities and HP's system-management
software and proprietary operating system.</TE>
<TE>   HP still expects to cut no more than 15,000 jobs over the next two
years, with many positions lost through attrition and voluntary
severance programs. Layoffs will begin Monday and will be mostly
completed within six to nine months, Fiorina said.</TE>
<TE>   HP is retaining its name and headquarters in Palo Alto. It
acquired Houston-based Compaq for $19 billion in stock over vigorous
opposition from the children of HP's late co-founders, including
former HP director Walter Hewlett.</TE>
<TE>   The deal survived an exceedingly close shareholder vote and the
apparent opposition of a large percentage of HP employees.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts have said they expect Capellas, as the head of daily
operations at the company, to bear much of the responsibility of
reassuring and motivating uneasy employees.</TE>
<TE>   "It's what I do, it's what I love to do, and I take great pride in
it," Capellas said.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett-Packard shares, which now trade under the HPQ ticker
symbol to reflect Compaq's presence, rose 19 cents to close at $18.41
on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Peggy Lee Class-Action Suit Settlement Stalled</HD>
<DH>Larry Hagman objects to $4.75-million royalties agreement
for scores of scores of former Decca artists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN W. O'NEILL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The $4.75-million settlement of late torch singer Peggy Lee's
class-action royalties suit against Vivendi Universal hit a snag
Tuesday when actor Larry Hagman objected, saying the figure is too
low and the agreement may be unfair to some artists.</LD>
<LD>   Hagman is executor of the estate of his mother, Mary Martin, who
recorded for Decca Records from 1938 to 1946 and is best known for
her Broadway roles in the musicals "South Pacific," "The Sound of
Music" and "Peter Pan." The Decca label is under the entertainment
giant's Universal Music Group.</LD>
<LD>   Lee accused her record company of using questionable accounting
practices to cheat artists out of royalties for decades. Universal,
the biggest record company, acquired Decca artists through a series
of mergers.</LD>
<TE>   Hagman did not attend Tuesday's hearing, at which the settlement
was to have been finalized by Superior Court Judge Victoria Gerrard
Chaney. But in court papers, the actor urged the judge to reject it,
arguing that the financial award is "inadequate" to compensate "the
substantial losses experienced by hundreds of great musical artists
over a long period of time." Hagman added that the settlement forces
some artists to accept modifications to their contracts that favor
the record company.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're hearing in the courtroom is J.R., and not Larry
Hagman," said Lee's lawyer, Cyrus V. Godfrey, referring to Hagman's
role as scheming Texas oilman J.R. Ewing on the television series
"Dallas."</TE>
<TE>   The proposed settlement, reached just days before Lee's death in
January, also involves about 160 others who recorded for Decca before
January 1962.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of the settlement, Vivendi admits no wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for Lee and Vivendi said the settlement was fair and
reasonable, and the judge has given preliminary approval. But
Hagman's lawyer, Bruce A. Broillet, said the $1 million set aside for
artists who already have signed amended contracts for compact disc
sales gives them a better deal than those who have not.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this proposed settlement is a speeding train that was
moving down the tracks too quickly and was going to run over the
rights of some of our most cherished entertainers," Broillet said.
"We will now subject it to considerable scrutiny."</TE>
<TE>   Also objecting was band singer Tony Martin, 88, who recorded for
Decca from 1936 to the late 1940s, when he was best known for
"September Song."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Lee, Tony Martin was a so-called penny rate contract
artist, who was paid pennies per record instead of a percentage, said
his lawyer, Marc A. Karlin. When Martin's contracts were signed more
than 50 years ago, recordings were released on 78 rpm records that
included only a few songs. Court documents state that his contracts
were never upgraded to include royalties for longer-playing formats,
including compact discs.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a settlement proposal that gave us no way of knowing the
value of Tony Martin's claim or others with penny rate contracts,"
Karlin said.</TE>
<TE>   An attempt by Philadelphia lawyer Mark C. Rifkin to join the case
on behalf of the heirs of Curtis Mayfield and Jackie Wilson failed
after the judge refused to include them in the class-action suit.
Rifkin argued that the settlement let the record company off the hook
for a relatively small amount of money and sanctioned the
mistreatment of artists.</TE>
<TE>   "You're telling me, in essence, that the settlement stinks?"
Chaney asked.</TE>
<TE>   "In plain language, yes," Rifkin responded.</TE>
<TE>   "You seem to think that if you were in this case, you would do
much better," Chaney continued. "What is it that you want? You've
made a lot of noise for a lot of time, but I haven't heard any down
and dirty specifics."</TE>
<TE>   The judge then ordered the other lawyers to try to resolve their
differences within 30 days.</TE>
<TE>   "If at all possible, I want to keep this settlement together,"
Chaney said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the names of the class members have been filed under
seal, attorneys have identified some of them as Louis Armstrong,
Pearl Bailey, Patsy Cline, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, the
Andrews Sisters and Bill Haley and the Comets.</TE>

<LD>European Union officials gave the go-ahead for plans to hit the
United States with trade sanctions worth hundreds of millions of
dollars in a bitter transatlantic dispute over steel.</LD>
<LD>   The European Commission, the EU's executive body, said members of
the 15-nation bloc unanimously backed its idea of retaliating against
new U.S. steel duties with sanctions worth $300 million on a range of
U.S. goods starting June 18. EU ministers would have to give a second
approval for the sanctions to take effect.</LD>
<LD>   The commission also said the EU made a formal request to the World
Trade Organization to form a dispute panel to rule on the new U.S.
steel duties.</LD>

<LD>U.S. consumers added debt to their balance sheets at a slightly
slower-than-expected pace in March, a report from the Federal Reserve
showed.</LD>
<LD>   The Fed said consumer credit outstanding grew by $4.6 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $1.69trillion, the smallest gain since December
2001. In March, revolving credit--debt linked to credit and charge
cards--rose $1.5 billion, its slowest pace since December 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Nonrevolving debt, including closed-end loans for cars, education
expenses, recreational vehicles, boats and vacations, grew by $3.1
billion.</LD>

<LD>Federal regulators said that Consumers Union, the nonprofit publisher
of Consumer Reports, would recall a free glove compartment organizer
that included a flashlight that could overheat and a defective tire
gauge it gave to about 15,000 new subscribers.</LD>
<LD>   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration warned owners
that they should immediately remove the batteries from the flashlight
and throw it and the tire gauge away.</LD>
<LD>   Consumers Union said subscribers who got the kit will get six
extra issues of the magazine if they return the flashlight and gauge
or tell Consumers Union they threw them away. They also could cancel
their subscription early, the magazine said.</LD>

<LD>Britain's Queen Elizabeth will pay no inheritance tax on her late
mother's estate, a collection that included racehorses, jewels and
art worth about $73million, Buckingham Palace said.</LD>
<LD>   Inheritance tax on such an estate normally would be 40%. But under
a 1993 agreement, assets passed from sovereign to sovereign--or from
the consort of a former sovereign to the reigning monarch--are not
subject to inheritance tax.</LD>
<LD>   Buckingham Palace said the Queen was exempt from inheritance tax
as he or she needed an "appropriate degree of financial independence"
from the government and because a king or queen was unable to
"generate significant new wealth through earnings or business
activities."</LD>

<HD>Southwest to Fly Nonstop Cross-Country</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southwest Airlines Co., the low-cost U.S. carrier that made its
fortune by flying short hops, said Tuesday it will begin nonstop
cross-country flights in September, once again threatening its larger
rivals.</LD>
<LD>   The transcontinental service will be between Baltimore/Washington
and Los Angeles International Airport, with two daily flights, Chief
Executive James Parker said.</LD>
<LD>   The new flights, a departure from Southwest Airlines' short-haul
signature, come even as demand for air travel in general remains well
below year-ago levels in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   In April, major U.S. carriers reported a decline in systemwide
traffic of about 12%, reversing the trend of gradual improvement. In
March, traffic was down about 9%.</TE>
<TE>   The airline, based in Dallas, was the only one of the top eight
U.S. carriers to post a profit in both the fourth quarter of 2001 and
the first quarter of this year. Unlike bigger rivals, it did not lay
off employees or cut back capacity.</TE>
<TE>   Parker said Southwest did see some very long lines in the fourth
quarter, especially during the holidays.</TE>
<TE>   "We have made a lot of progress in the airports," he said. "The
flow of the customers is coming back to what it was in the pre-9/11
world."</TE>
<TE>   Including the new service, Parker said third-quarter capacity will
be up 8% over last year, with full-year growth of about 5%.</TE>
<TE>   Southwest shares closed down 15 cents at $17.84 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>House Passes Bill to Delay Airwave Auction</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AT&amp;T Wireless Services Inc. and other mobile-phone companies won
House approval of a bill to delay two auctions of airwaves in June
and give the industry time to resolve ownership disputes with
broadcasters. Television station operators such as Paxson
Communications Corp. control licenses to the airwaves until at least
2006 as they upgrade to digital TV. Federal law requires that the
government sell rights to the licenses to mobile-phone carriers by
September, even though they won't get to use the airwaves until TV
stations complete their upgrades.</LD>
<LD>   Mobile-phone companies are reluctant to take part in the June 19
sale unless they can find out exactly when broadcasters will
relinquish the frequencies. They worry they may have to pay billions
at the government auctions and billions more to get broadcasters to
give up the airwaves before 2006.</LD>
<LD>   The House bill postpones the auctions until the conflict is
resolved. The Senate is considering a similar measure.</LD>

to the Internet site www.newport.com.</LD>
<LD>   Newport Electronics sued, alleging trademark infringement and

<DL></DL>
<LD>The European Union agreed to impose a new tax on products downloaded
from the Internet--including software, videos and music--aiming to
help Europe's Web-based businesses compete with U.S. companies.</LD>
<LD>   EU Taxation Commissioner Frits Bolkestein said the new tax rules
"will remove the serious competitive handicap which EU firms
currently face."</LD>
<LD>   Bolkestein complained that U.S. giants of the industry levy no
taxes on online customers. The effect has been to give a sales tax
loophole to European buyers, who find cheaper-price goods on U.S.
sites.</LD>
<TE>   Although U.S. businesses are the focus of the legislation, the tax
affects all non-European Internet businesses selling digital
products, whether in the United States or elsewhere, said Nicholas
Colannino, a European Commission spokesman in New York.</TE>

<HD>Warburg Analyst Advises Investors to Sell JetBlue</HD>
<DH>Securities: Ratings recommendation is seen as sending a
message that firm's research is independent from investment banking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UBS Warburg analyst Samuel Buttrick on Tuesday advised investors to
sell JetBlue Airways Corp. shares less than a month after his firm
helped manage the discount airline's initial stock sale.</LD>
<LD>   Buttrick started coverage of JetBlue (ticker symbol: JBLU) at
"reduce," one of seven companies with the firm's second-lowest
rating. He said in a note to clients that shares are too expensive
after doubling from their IPO price.</LD>
<LD>   Buttrick's recommendation stands out because Wall Street analysts'
reluctance to criticize investment-banking clients has gotten them
into trouble.</LD>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York state
attorney general's office are investigating possible conflicts of
interest at Wall Street firms.</TE>
<TE>   "Warburg is clearly trying to send a message that they will be
independent on the research side from the investment-banking side,"
said Thomas Angers, director of research at Glenmede Trust Co. "You
wouldn't have seen this a year ago."</TE>
<TE>   Less than 1% of the more than 900 companies Warburg covers have
"reduce" ratings, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. The firm
has no "sells," its lowest possible ranking.</TE>
<TE>   About 3% of all analysts' ratings are "sells," according to
Bloomberg data, while 62% are "buys" and 34% are "holds."</TE>
<TE>   Buttrick didn't return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   "Saying JetBlue may be a little overextended is what should
happen," said Erick Maronak, director of research at NewBridge
Partners. "More firms should be willing to step up and say that a
stock is ahead of itself."</TE>
<TE>   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co., which led JetBlue's IPO last
month, started the stock at "equal-weight," saying shares are fairly
valued through 2003. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., which also participated in
the sale, placed a long-term "strong buy" on the shares.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe the scrutiny is getting analysts' ratings to be more
accurate," said Nick Redfield, a transportation analyst with Banc One
Investment Advisors Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan Stanley analysts William Greene and Kevin Murphy didn't
return calls for comment, and spokeswoman Diana Quintero declined to
comment. JetBlue also declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   JetBlue raised $158.5 million on April 12 by selling 5.87 million
shares at $27 each. The stock surged 66% on its first day of trading
and climbed as high as $54.50, about double its initial price.</TE>

<TE>   SEC Seeks Electronic Filing for Foreign Firms</TE>
<TE>   Foreign companies would be required to file registration
statements and other documents electronically with U.S. securities
regulators under rules expected to be adopted today.</TE>
<TE>   Ending the option of foreign entities to file on paper with the
Securities and Exchange Commission will boost the amount of
information investors can get through the SEC's Electronic Data
Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) system.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 1,310 foreign companies that filed documents with the
commission in 2000, only 232, or about 18%, chose to file on EDGAR
that year, according to the most recent SEC figures available.</TE>
<TE>   The measure, which also would apply to foreign governments
offering securities, will be considered for final adoption by the
three SEC commissioners at a public hearing today.</TE>
<TE>   The commission considered making foreign entities use EDGAR
several years ago, but backed off due to fears some parts of the
world were not technologically ready.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a proposal whose time has come and most people recognize
that," said Brian Lane, who headed the SEC's Division of Corporation
Finance before becoming a private securities lawyer. "This is about
getting more information into the hands of U.S. investors."</TE>

<TE>   SEC Makes Minor Changes to Analyst Rule</TE>
<TE>   The SEC made only minor changes in its plan to limit conflicts of
interest among stock analysts, responding to objections from Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co. and other Wall Street firms, SEC officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The revised plan is set to be adopted today as a rule that will
bar analysts from working under investment bankers and from being
paid out of revenue from specific investment banking transactions,
SEC market-regulation director Annette Nazareth said.</TE>
<TE>   The rule also will force firms to disclose in reports and during
TV appearances how much they stand to earn from companies covered by
analysts, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC proposal, which faces continued Wall Street objections,
falls short of more sweeping changes being pressed on brokerages by
New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer.</TE>
<TE>   "The SEC needs to establish that truly fraudulent analyst
recommendations violate the law, and [SEC Chairman] Harvey Pitt may
want to take some of the thunder back from Spitzer," Georgetown
University law professor Donald Langevoort said. "The next shoe to
fall may be SEC enforcement actions."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Offers Motive as Andersen Trial Begins</HD>
<DH>Courts: Prosecutor says partners initiated Enron document
shredding for fear of ban from auditing public firms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>A cadre of Arthur Andersen partners, fearing the consequences of
their shoddy audit of Enron Corp., decided to shred documents last
year before receiving a subpoena, prosecutors told a federal jury
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   In opening statements during the first criminal trial arising from
Enron's meltdown, a federal prosecutor said Andersen executives
initiated the destruction because they believed the firm's record of
run-ins with regulators meant that a new scandal probably would
result in the Securities and Exchange Commission suspending the firm
from auditing public companies.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday's opening statement marked the first time prosecutors have
tried to attach a motive to Andersen's alleged obstruction. A grand
jury indicted the firm March 7, and Andersen has pleaded not guilty.
A conviction could doom the Chicago-based accounting giant, which is
seeing an exodus of clients and international affiliates. An
acquittal could trip up the federal investigation of Enron.</LD>
<TE>   Andersen repeatedly tried Tuesday to block prosecutors from
discussing the details of the previous civil accounting-fraud cases
involving the firm, saying they were irrelevant. Such prior acts
often are inadmissible as evidence, but courts have allowed
exceptions for certain reasons, such as proving motive. Defense
lawyers typically fight the admission of prior so-called bad acts,
analysts say, because they tarnish the character of the defendant and
force attorneys to rebut additional allegations.</TE>
<TE>   But after U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon denied the defense
bid, prosecutors told the jury that Andersen last year agreed to pay
a $7-million fine to settle an SEC complaint alleging the accounting
firm issued misleading audits that enabled a client, trash-hauler
Waste Management Inc., to inflate earnings by $1 billion from 1993 to
1996. The settlement also included an injunction forbidding Andersen
from violating securities laws in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also cited the Sunbeam Corp. case, in which Andersen
last year agreed to pay $110 million to settle a lawsuit filed by
Sunbeam shareholders claiming the accounting firm helped Sunbeam
improperly boost profit.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution's first witness, SEC enforcement official Thomas
Newkirk, told the jury that the regulatory agency had made clear in
recent years that any firm found to be a repeat offender could expect
harsher treatment, including being prohibited from auditing public
companies.</TE>
<TE>   Even before he took the stand, however, prosecutors began
describing internal activity at Andersen they said indicated the firm
"knew the SEC was coming."</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Matt Friedrich, one of three prosecutors,
told the jury that Nancy Temple, an Andersen attorney in Chicago,
wrote in an internal memo in October about the firm's potential legal
exposure in its audit of Enron. Nineteen minutes later, Friedrich
said, she sent an unusual e-mail to Michael Odom, a senior partner in
Andersen's Houston office, asking him to make sure the office was in
compliance with Andersen's document-retention policy, which calls for
destroying documents deemed unnecessary to support an audit's
conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   Friedrich said the prosecution plans to show jurors a videotape of
Odom explaining the policy to Andersen employees, in which he says
they can shred documents until the day they receive a subpoena.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's lead attorney, Rusty Hardin, seized on the
videotape--apparently a training film--to poke holes in the notion
that senior Andersen officials devised a strategy to secretly destroy
their Enron records.</TE>
<TE>   "What kind of conspiracy is launched on videotape?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Hardin made his statement after losing a bid to bar any mention of
Andersen's previous accounting troubles. He told Judge Harmon that
citing the regulators' complaints would be "tremendously misleading"
to the jury.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're doing now is trying Arthur Andersen for their
accounting," Hardin protested at one point, to no avail.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides took every chance to criticize Enron, potentially
signaling that the trial will preview the themes of a broader case
against the now-bankrupt energy trader.</TE>
<TE>   In his opening statement, Friedrich said Enron "pushed the edges"
of accounting. Hardin recalled Enron, once Andersen's second-largest
client, as a "hard-charging, up to the line-type company."</TE>
<TE>   The legal attack on Andersen is expected to sharpen today as more
witnesses testify. Prosecutors are expected to call Carl Bass, a
Houston-based member of Andersen's Professional Standards Group, a
team of accounting specialists who provide guidance on complex
auditing issues.</TE>
<TE>   Bass is expected to testify that former Andersen partner David B.
Duncan and other Andersen executives who worked on the Enron audit
ignored his advice about how to account for off-the-books
partnerships. Bass was removed from dealings with Enron in March
2001, after Enron's chief accounting officer complained about him to
Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   In court Tuesday, Hardin downplayed the suggestion that Enron had
held sway over Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has said employees destroyed Enron-related documents last
fall in a belated attempt to comply with the firm's
document-retention policy.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors said Andersen's policy was "targeted at Enron" and
did not encompass documents from other clients.</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Guess Inc., a clothing retailer and designer, said it had a loss of
$3.6 million in its first quarter. Profit this year will be less than
forecast as sales to department stores and other retailers will be
lower than expected.</LD>
<LD>   The loss of 8 cents a share contrasted with net income of
$2.08million, or 5 cents, in the year-earlier quarter. Profit this
year will be as much as 16 cents, Guess said. The analysts' average
estimate was 21 cents, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.</LD>
<LD>   Guess said its department store and wholesale business had a loss
from operations of $6.7 million as it sold less full-price
merchandise.</LD>
<TE>   First-quarter sales declined 19% to $138.2 million from $170.1
million, Guess said. Sales this year are expected to decline as much
as 13%, with revenue in the first half dropping about 20%, the firm
said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, sales were $677.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Los Angeles-based Guess rose 17 cents to $7.95 on the
New York Stock Exchange. They have increased 6.7% in the last year.
The news was released after the close of regular U.S. trading.</TE>
<TE>   Other California companies reporting earnings, excluding one-time
gains or charges unless noted:</TE>
<TE>   * American States Water Co. reported first-quarter net income of
$3.8 million, or 37 cents a share, compared with $3.1 million, or 30
cents, a year ago. Revenue at the San Dimas-based water and
electricity distributor increased 10.4% to $44.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Edelbrock Corp. reported net income of $1.1 million, or 23 cents a
share, in its fiscal third quarter, up from $54,000, or 1 cent a
share, a year ago. The Torrance-based manufacturer of aftermarket
automotive parts said revenue increased 8.6% to $28.2 million.</TE>

<HD>Disney Chairman Courts Operators of Cable Systems</HD>
<DH>Media: Michael Eisner's appearance at trade show comes as
company seeks rate hikes for ESPN and ABC Family.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>Michael Eisner, disliked by many in the cable industry for his price
hikes for the popular ESPN channel, made a rare appearance Tuesday at
the National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn. trade show in an
apparent peace-making gesture.</LD>
<LD>   Eisner, Walt Disney Co.'s chairman, walked the convention floor
and later hosted a dinner for executives of the nation's largest
cable system operators. Eisner said he came to the cable convention
with no agenda.</LD>
<LD>   "There is no message," he said. "At the dinner tonight, we
probably won't even discuss business."</LD>
<TE>   Disney cable executives, who have been on the front lines of the
battle with the cable operators, were clearly relieved for Eisner's
support.</TE>
<TE>   Although Sumner Redstone, chairman of Viacom Inc., which owns MTV,
regularly hosts a dinner during the convention for cable operators in
a gesture of gratitude and goodwill, Eisner has not attended for
years.</TE>
<TE>   Privately, many cable operators said they get no respect from
Disney for helping build ESPN into the world's most profitable
television network and the most powerful brand in television sports.
They say they are angered that ESPN's rates are among the highest in
the cable industry. Most cable operators pay Disney $1.50 to $2 a
month per subscriber to carry the sports channel. Cable operators say
Eisner has hiked ESPN's rates about 20% a year for three years and
they keep paying it because losing the channel would provoke a
backlash from their customers.</TE>
<TE>   Disney President Robert Iger defended the rate hikes Tuesday,
saying ESPN's profit margins have suffered as the network has
invested in more sports programming to continue strengthening the
channel.</TE>
<TE>   Cable operators say they are unable to pass these price hikes onto
customers because they are under regulatory pressures to keep
consumer rates in check.</TE>
<TE>   "How can we continue to raise our rates to consumers by only 5% a
year if ESPN continues to raise its rates to us by 20% a year," said
one cable systems chief. "The issue with Disney right now is, are we
going to war?"</TE>
<TE>   Disney recently notified cable operators that it intends to raise
ESPN's rates an additional 20% this year to help pay for its new
contract with the National Basketball Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Cable operators said they signed long-term contracts with ESPN
agreeing to these yearly rate hikes to help cover the steep costs of
sports rights.</TE>
<TE>   Yet for the first time in years, cable operators see a way to
retaliate against Disney. Disney has been asking cable operators for
stiff fee increases for carrying its new ABC Family channel, which
the company bought from News Corp. last fall for $5.2 billion. To pay
for the purchase, Disney planned in some cases to double ABC Family's
rates to cable distributors.</TE>
<TE>   "Eisner is here because he's in trouble with the Family Channel,"
said an executive at a major cable operator. "He needs us more than
we need him."</TE>
<TE>   Contracts for carrying the ABC Family channels have expired for
all but two of the seven major cable operators. And those cable
operators so far have refused to pay Disney what it wants.</TE>

<HD>Fed Lets Key Rate Stand</HD>
<DH>Economy: Policymakers say degree of strengthening in demand
is uncertain. Meanwhile, report shows productivity grew at its
fastest pace since 1983.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Federal Reserve left its benchmark lending rate unchanged Tuesday
in an effort to prop up an economy that, despite more than six months
of growth and impressive new efficiency gains, continues to slouch
uncertainly toward recovery.</LD>
<LD>   Fed policymakers left the so-called Fed funds rate--the interest
that banks charge each other for short-term loans--at a 40-year low
of 1.75%, where it has been since December. The move assures
Americans that they will continue enjoying some of the lowest
borrowing costs in decades.</LD>
<LD>   Despite widespread predictions earlier in the year that the
economy would recover quickly, the central bank said in a statement
after its meeting Tuesday that "the degree of the strengthening in
final demand over the coming quarters ... is still uncertain."</LD>
<TE>   And central bank policymakers omitted from Tuesday's statement a
key phrase that followed their meeting in March--that the economy "is
expanding at a significant pace."</TE>
<TE>   "They're recognizing that we're going through a significant
downshift from the first quarter," said Allen Sinai, global chief
economist at Decision Economics Inc., a New York-based forecasting
firm.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, a new report showed that productivity--the economy's
ability to produce goods or perform services per hour of
work--unexpectedly grew at its fastest pace in nearly two decades
during the first quarter of the year. The increase gives the Fed more
maneuvering room to keep interest rates low by serving as a bulwark
against a revival of inflation.</TE>
<TE>   "The numbers confirm the 'new economy' is alive and still with
us," said Mark Zandi, chief economist with Economy.com, a West
Chester, Pa., forecaster.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed decision had been widely anticipated. Indeed, the stock
market sloughed it off almost as if it had not happened. The Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 slid to its lowest level in seven months, while the Dow
Jones industrial average climbed, but only modestly. By now, all
major market measures are down for the year.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the central bank decision was a striking
illustration of the confusing condition of the economy, which has
beaten the odds of a stock crash and terror attacks to make a
comeback--but without enough power to convince investors and some
economists that growth is self-sustaining.</TE>
<TE>   On the plus side, the economy expanded at a 5.8% annual rate from
January through March, and has continued growing in all but one
quarter since March 2001, when, according to an official panel, it
slipped into recession. In doing so, it has defied the traditional
definition of a recession as two consecutive quarters of contraction,
prompting doubts about whether it suffered a downturn.</TE>
<TE>   In the minus column, unemployment hit a 7 1/2-year high of 6% last
month, when the economy added its first jobs since July, and
corporate investment has come to a virtual standstill.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unusual to be uncertain about where we're headed this far
into a recovery," said David M. Jones, chief economist with
investment firm Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co. in New York. Under these
conditions, he said "the Fed is in no hurry to hike rates. It's
afraid the economy isn't strong enough to tolerate it."</TE>
<TE>   By leaving the rate unchanged, the Fed ensured that the commercial
banks' prime rate, off which the borrowing costs of millions of
business and consumer loans are keyed, will remain at 4.75%, its
lowest level since 1965. Low rates should encourage consumers to keep
buying and may eventually persuade businesses to resume making
capital investments.</TE>
<TE>   The value of those business investments appeared to be borne out
in the latest productivity figures, which showed the government's
measure of the amount of work performed by American employees per
hour rose at an exceptionally strong 8.6% annual rate from January
through March.</TE>
<TE>   That was the fastest rate since a 9.9% jump in the second quarter
of 1983. It was substantially above the 5.5% pace of growth during
the last three months of last year, and was a full point higher than
most economists had predicted.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said that a large part of the improvement was cyclical
and occurs whenever the economy comes out of recession. But they
added that part of it was traceable to new technology that allowed
companies to boost output even as they cut work hours.</TE>

<HD>Jazzercise Teacher Wins Bias Fight</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jazzercise Inc. says it no longer will require instructors to look
trim and fit, settling a woman's complaint that she was refused a job
because she weighed 240 pounds.</LD>
<LD>   The change in company policy, based on a settlement with the San
Francisco woman and mediated by the city's Human Rights Commission,
was announced Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "Recent studies document that it may be possible for people of
varying weights to be fit," Jazzercise said in the settlement.
"Jazzercise has determined that the value of 'fit appearance' as a
standard is debatable."</LD>
<TE>   Jennifer Portnick, 38, complained that San Diego-based Jazzercise
refused to hire her as an exercise-class instructor because her
build--5-foot-8, 240 pounds--would give students the impression she
was not in shape.</TE>
<TE>   She filed a complaint in February alleging discrimination under
San Francisco's "fat and short" law, which bars discrimination on the
basis of weight and height.</TE>
<TE>   Portnick said she works out six days a week and has mastered the
complex dance steps required to teach Jazzercise. She now runs her
own fitness program and said she does not plan to reapply to
Jazzercise.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm absolutely thrilled with this outcome," she said. "I'm lucky
to live in San Francisco, where there's a law to protect people like
me."</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Portnick last year, Maureen Brown, Jazzercise's
director of franchise programs, wrote that "Jazzercise sells
fitness."</TE>
<TE>   "Consequently, a Jazzercise applicant must have a higher
muscle-fat ratio and look leaner than the public," Brown wrote.
"People must believe Jazzercise will help them improve, not just
maintain their level of fitness."</TE>

<HD>Gallo Sues Hilton to Block Use of Its Name</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>E&amp;J Gallo Winery sued to block a customer, Hilton Hotels Corp., from
opening a chain of Italian restaurants named Gallo Rosso.</LD>
<LD>   Gallo, which means rooster in Italian, said it began using the
name in 1933 when Ernest and Julio Gallo founded the company. The
family has spent more than $600 million promoting the name, selling
billions of bottles of wine.</LD>
<LD>   Hilton's plan for a Gallo Rosso chain, with a red rooster image,
would lead consumers to "invariably associate" the new restaurants
with Gallo wines, the suit said. That "will cause Gallo to lose
control of the manner in which its famous trademark is promoted,"
giving consumers the impression "there are now two Gallo brands, one
for wine and another for Italian restaurants."</LD>
<TE>   Closely held Gallo, based in Modesto, has successfully sued many
others who tried to use the name for such products as salsa, beer,
cheese, rice, coffee bags and shoes. Kathy Shepard, a spokeswoman for
Beverly Hills-based Hilton, said the company doesn't comment on
litigation. On Tuesday, Hilton shares rose 11 cents to $16.01 on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The suit, filed last week in U.S. District Court in Fresno,
doesn't say whether Gallo Rosso restaurants would be in any of
Hilton's hotel chains or be separate.</TE>

<HD>Personalizing TV With On-Demand Services</HD>
<DH>Satellite and cable firms are letting viewers take control
of programming.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The fierce competition between cable and satellite TV services is
driving a fundamental change in the way television is delivered,
giving consumers a growing number of ways to seize control of the
programming schedule.</LD>
<LD>   After several years of dabbling with video-on-demand services, the
country's top cable TV companies are enabling millions of customers
to watch what they want, when they want.</LD>
<LD>   Four kinds of on-demand service are emerging from cable operators
this year, with satellite companies working on a fifth.</LD>
<TE>   The systems have some glaring weaknesses--they don't offer the
most popular TV programs, they're not included yet in the regular
cable program guides, and the selection is no match for the local
video store. Yet cable operators, satellite companies, studios and
networks all have a stake in getting the new services up.</TE>
<TE>   For cable operators, VOD is one of the few services that clearly
separates digital cable from satellite TV and traditional basic
cable. Satellite companies counter with personal video recorders,
which have limited on-demand potential but are extremely popular with
their owners.</TE>
<TE>   A number of movie studios, meanwhile, have embraced VOD as a step
up from pay per view, which has generated fewer dollars than most
other outlets for their films. And several TV networks see on-demand
services as a new way to turn programs into cash, with or without
advertisers' support.</TE>
<TE>   HBO, for example, is testing a service that lets subscribers watch
any original program from that month's lineup at any time. A
subscriber can watch "Six Feet Under" at 8 p.m. Tuesday instead of 11
p.m., or even watch all four of the month's episodes back-to-back.</TE>
<TE>   The shift to on-demand is expected to be gradual, yet it
challenges many of the ways networks promote shows, build audiences
and attract advertisers. For starters, cutting programs loose from
their time slots means networks lose the benefit of running new shows
after popular and established ones.</TE>
<TE>   And broadcasters can't assure local merchants that their
commercials will be seen before the big holiday sale or promotion
ends.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, cable and phone companies have been hyping video on
demand for years without ever committing to it. But analyst Josh
Bernoff of Forrester Research Inc., a technology research and
consulting firm, said, "This is real. These [cable] guys are going
for this in a huge, huge way.... This is the year they're all doing
VOD."</TE>
<TE>   For a cable operator, the new VOD services start with two-way,
high-capacity digital networks. The operator stores several dozen
movies on a powerful central computer, and customers browse through
titles on their TV screens. When they find one they want to watch,
the central computer streams it to their digital converter box. The
computer can pause, rewind and fast-forward the movie in response to
commands from the customer's remote control, just as if the movie
were on videotape.</TE>
<TE>   The last wave of VOD services came and went in the mid-1990s, when
a group of major cable and phone companies launched and then
abandoned several experiments with interactive services. Although
consumers liked VOD, the systems required such expensive set-top
boxes and computers that they were economically unfeasible.</TE>
<TE>   Suppliers of VOD technology eventually adapted their services to
basic digital converter boxes, and the cost of computers plummeted to
the point where on-demand services could turn a profit. The lingering
issue today is obtaining the rights to offer programs on demand--some
top Hollywood studios have yet to strike deals with VOD services, and
winning the rights to the major networks' prime-time shows is
complicated by the interests of producers, licensees, syndicators and
advertisers.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, cable operators are enthusiastic about VOD in part
because it's something the satellite companies can't offer, said
Mitchell E. Kertzman, chief executive of Liberate Technologies, which
makes software for set-top boxes. VOD also helps convince consumers
to switch from analog to digital cable, which cable operators view as
a springboard to future services, Kertzman said.</TE>
<TE>   Satellite TV operators DirecTV and DishNetwork don't have the
capacity on their orbiting transmitters to beam programs on demand.
Instead, they're offering receivers with built-in personal video
recorders, laying the foundation for a different kind of on-demand
service.</TE>
<TE>   In recent roll-outs of VOD, the increased control and convenience
leads consumers to order two to three times as many movies as they do
with regular pay per view, said Greg DePrez, a vice president at
Starz Encore Group. Their usage increases even more, DePrez said,
when they can order an unlimited number of programs for a flat fee.</TE>
<TE>   Starz has been a leading advocate of "subscription video on
demand," offering consumers on-demand access to 100 of the 800 movies
that are scheduled to run on the Starz Encore channels each month.
HBO and Showtime also have begun subscription VOD services built
around their original programming, and Walt Disney Co. subsidiary
ESPN plans one to let subscribers call up extreme sports programming
on their TV or computer.</TE>
<TE>   Companies still are trying to figure out how much to charge for
these services. Fees for subscription VOD are expected to cost
between $3 and $10 a month, although several cable operators have
included such services in their digital cable packages at no extra
charge.</TE>
<TE>   A third version of VOD is being developed by Comcast Corp., which
would become the largest U.S. cable operator if its $72-billion bid
for AT&amp;T Broadband is approved.</TE>
<TE>   Later this year, Comcast plans to offer a free VOD tier to
digital-cable subscribers that includes 750 hours of programming each
month from cable and broadcast networks, said Dave Watson, executive
vice president of marketing and customer service.</TE>
<TE>   Watson wouldn't say which shows will be offered, but the networks
developing on-demand versions of their original programming include
NBC, A&amp;E, Lifetime, Discovery, CourtTV, Comedy Central, ESPN, BBC
America and TNT. Comcast has found so much interest among programmers
in its new on-demand service, it's "running out of shelf space" on
the company's central computers, Watson said.</TE>
<TE>   A final variation being explored by cable operators is to record
programs digitally on central computers as they're broadcast, letting
customers replay them on demand. To avoid getting ensnared in a
copyright dispute, the operators are focusing on news and sports
programs whose rights are readily available.</TE>
<TE>   The only deployment so far has been by Adelphia Communications
Corp. in Buffalo, N.Y. Earlier this year, the company made Buffalo
Sabres hockey games available on demand for free on digital cable.</TE>
<TE>   The satellite operators' on-demand strategy starts with personal
video recorders, which Bernoff estimates were in 700,000 of their
customers' homes by the end of 2001. Once PVRs have sufficient
capacity, satellite companies could broadcast 10 to 15 popular movies
to customers' recorders in the middle of the night, and users would
pay only for the ones they watched.</TE>
<TE>   Cable operators have been slow to deploy PVR-equipped converter
boxes, but the pace is picking up.</TE>
<TE>   Time Warner Cable and Cox Communications Inc. have started testing
a PVR-equipped digital cable box from Scientific-Atlanta Inc., and
Charter Communications Inc. has announced plans to deploy this fall a
PVR-equipped box made by Motorola Inc.</TE>
<TE>   One potential pitfall of PVRs for cable operators is that they may
dim customers' interest in VOD.</TE>
<TE>   David Rothman, a Cablevision customer in Long Island, N.Y., has
filled his customized digital recorder with movies from various cable
channels. "Now I've got 120 to 180 hours of movies on my hard drive,"
Rothman said. "It's unlikely, unless there's something very new, that
I'm going to want to go to video on demand."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the recorders enable cable operators and advertisers to
store personalized, interactive programming in subscribers' homes,
creating a new source of revenue, said Manu Mehta, chief executive of
Metabyte Networks, which supplies the PVR software for
Scientific-Atlanta's boxes.</TE>
<TE>   For example, he said, consumers could shift from a 10-second
commercial for a cruise line to a stored program that provides an
interactive tour of the ship. Or they could click on a beer ad to
launch a video game sponsored by the brewery.</TE>
<TE>   "In the long run, the cable operators see PVR as a new way of
doing business," Mehta said. "PVRs will change television."</TE>

<HD>Pension Change Hurts Workers, Audit Finds</HD>
<DH>Benefits: Early retirees are underpaid by as much as $199
million annually, Labor Department reports.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Early retirees covered by so-called cash balance pension plans may be
shortchanged by as much as $199 million annually, according to a
recent government audit, providing ammunition to critics of the
controversial retirement plans.</LD>
<LD>   Since the early 1980s, 300 to 700 traditional corporate benefit
plans--known as defined benefit pensions--have been converted into
cash balance plans. Cash balance plans are supposed to be more
portable and attractive to younger workers, but critics have long
charged that the plans short-change older workers and endanger
generous subsidies to those who choose to retire early.</LD>
<LD>   The Department of Labor's Office of Inspector General examined 60
pensions that had converted to cash balance plans and found that in
about 20% of them--13 plans--the amount owed to early retirees was
miscalculated, sometimes underpaying workers by more than $50,000.</LD>
<TE>   The reason for the miscalculation is complex. Using the rules set
down in law, early retirees should get more than the cash balance
reported in their accounts. But some companies either gave the
retiree only the amount shown to be accumulated, or used the wrong
interest rate to determine their benefits, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   The retirees in the sample group were underpaid by about $17
million annually, the report said. That led the inspector general to
conclude that thousands of workers affected by unaudited plans may be
underpaid by $85 million to $199million per year.</TE>
<TE>   "This report proves that a number of companies are illegally
slashing the pension benefits of their employees by hundreds of
millions of dollars every single year by shifting to cash balance
plans," Rep. Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.), said Tuesday. "Even worse, the
federal government is giving these companies the green light to
illegally reduce the pension of their employees because the feds are
simply ignoring the laws that are on the books."</TE>
<TE>   The inspector general recommended that the Department of Labor
devote more resources to auditing plan payouts.</TE>
<TE>   It also suggested that the department initiate enforcement against
the 13 plans that underpaid workers. Neither the 60 plans audited,
nor the 13 plans that had miscalculated benefits were named in the
report.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Secretary of Labor Ann L. Combs questioned the audit's
findings, saying it was unclear whether the sample group was
representative enough to draw such broad conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Combs contended that the Department of Labor doesn't
have jurisdiction over the plans, saying the Internal Revenue Service
was responsible for ensuring that companies properly calculated
pension benefits.</TE>
<TE>   If Combs is right, the IRS has a big stick to wield against
companies that underpay workers. The agency can disqualify a
corporation's pension plan, requiring the company to pay tax on all
the assets accumulated in the system.</TE>
<TE>   The agency has rarely, if ever, used this authority. However,
labor attorneys maintain the IRS has occasionally threatened to
disqualify plans that fail to right past wrongs.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it was unclear Tuesday whether the retirees who had been
underpaid would be made whole. Some of the plans that were examined
had been converted to cash balance status more than a decade ago,
beyond the statute of limitations in some states.</TE>
<TE>   However, pension experts maintained that the report made it clear
that regulators--the IRS and the Department of Labor--need to keep a
closer eye on benefits paid to retirees involved in cash balance
plans in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "When there's this much smoke, you'd have to assume that there's a
fire," said University of Alabama law professor Norman Stein, a
member of the Department of Labor's pension advisory counsel.</TE>
<TE>   "These kinds of errors ... strike me as an issue of fiduciary
responsibility on which the Department of Labor does have authority."</TE>

<HD>Cigarette Smuggling Probed</HD>
<DH>Trade: U.S. officials are investigating allegations that
tobacco firms are sending huge shipments to Iraq despite embargo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN and WILLIAM C. REMPEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. authorities are probing allegations that cigarette makers R.J.
Reynolds and Japan Tobacco Inc. have violated trade sanctions against
Iraq by channeling billions of dollars worth of cigarettes into the
country through intermediaries, sources have told The Times.</LD>
<LD>   The allegations of illegal shipments to Iraq first surfaced
publicly in a civil lawsuit by the European Union, which accused
Reynolds, Japan Tobacco and Philip Morris Cos. of evading hundreds of
millions of dollars in taxes by promoting a vast cigarette-smuggling
scheme.</LD>
<LD>   Federal investigators separately have launched a criminal
investigation, tracking shiploads of cigarettes suspected of being
diverted through Cyprus and other authorized ports into Iraq despite
the trade embargo.</LD>
<TE>   Dean Boyd, spokesman for the U.S. Customs Service, said he could
"neither confirm nor deny any such investigation." But people
familiar with the probe said it involves at least six customs
investigators based in the U.S. and abroad.</TE>
<TE>   These sources said the Customs Service is working with federal
prosecutors in the office of the U.S. attorney for the Southern
District of New York. A spokesman for that office also declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Reynolds spokesman Seth Moskowitz said company officials hadn't
heard of the probe. If contacted by authorities, "we'll ... provide
whatever information is required," Moskowitz said.</TE>
<TE>   "To my knowledge, nobody from this company has been involved in
any smuggling activity," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Guy Cote, spokesman for JT International, the Japan Tobacco
subsidiary that acquired the international cigarette business of
Reynolds in 1999, also said his firm was unaware of the
investigation. Cote said that, as far as company officials know,
their cigarettes have not been shipped to Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   In court papers and exhibits filed in U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn, the EU has claimed that Reynolds' Winston cigarettes and
other brands have flowed into Iraq continuously--and illegally--since
August 1990, when U.S. trade with Iraq was outlawed after its
invasion of Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   The trade sanctions, ordered by former President George Bush under
the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, bar not only direct
shipments but also moving goods through middlemen or third countries.
Penalties for criminal violations range up to 12 years in prison and
a $1-million fine. Civil penalties of as much as $275,000 per
violation also may be imposed.</TE>
<TE>   According to some estimates, as much as one-third of exported
cigarettes are smuggled across national boundaries to evade duties
and taxes. Cigarette makers say they send products through legitimate
channels and aren't responsible for diversions that may occur later
in the distribution chain. In the Iraq case, knowledge or intent to
violate trade sanctions would be required to prove a criminal charge.</TE>
<TE>   The EU's smuggling lawsuit was dismissed in February by U.S.
District Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis, though his ruling did not
absolve the tobacco companies or address the Iraq allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, Garaufis ruled that the suit could not proceed because
other countries are barred from using U.S. courts to collect unpaid
taxes. The EU has filed an appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraq allegations involve cigarettes produced at a former
Reynolds cigarette factory in Puerto Rico that was transferred to
Japan Tobacco in 1999 as part of the sale of Reynolds' international
business.</TE>
<TE>   According to the EU's claims, cigarettes from the plant were
shipped to European ports, then rerouted to a Reynolds' distributor
in Cyprus, and ultimately routed to Turkey and trucked into Iraq. JT
International announced this year that it plans to close the Puerto
Rico plant.</TE>
<TE>   In support of its claims, the EU filed an affidavit by Tugrul
Ozsengul, identified as a Turkish security consultant, who said he
had witnessed the shipments into Iraq on a visit to the border area
in December 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to the Habur border gate of Turkey with Iraq and I
witnessed that Winston cigarettes and Philip Morris brand cigarettes
were being shipped across the border into Iraq," Ozsengul said. "I
questioned people working and living in the area about these
shipments and learned that almost every day lorries, mainly of the
above-mentioned brands, have been shipped to Iraq, and this situation
has persisted for several years."</TE>
<TE>   The EU further claimed that a terrorist group, the Kurdistan
Workers' Party, may be involved in the cigarette trade, citing a
document it filed under seal to protect an informant.</TE>
<TE>   The EU also said that Uday Hussein, son of Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein, probably has profited from the venture, citing claims by a
high-ranking Iraqi defector that Uday Hussein controls the country's
cigarette trade.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, a Reynolds subsidiary, Northern Brands Inc., pleaded
guilty to U.S. charges in a cigarette smuggling case and paid a $15
million fine.</TE>
<TE>   A Northern Brands sales executive also went to prison in the case,
which involved contraband cigarettes sent from upstate New York
across the border into Canada to evade Canadian tobacco taxes.</TE>
<TE>   In filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Reynolds
has disclosed that it is under investigation by the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police in connection with the Northern Brands case.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999 and 2000, Reynolds also received document subpoenas from a
federal grand jury in North Carolina that is looking into possible
shipments of contraband cigarettes to Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said that investigation is continuing and is separate from
the probe by prosecutors in New York of alleged shipments to Iraq.</TE>

<HD>Energy Firms Get Jolt From Wall St.</HD>
<DH>Securities: Concerns over Enron memos prompt investors to
dump power stocks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors dumped energy stocks Tuesday amid fears that the documents
pointing to Enron Corp.'s rigging of California's electricity market
could lead to revelations about other traders and power suppliers.</LD>
<LD>   The memos say other unidentified firms used Enron's techniques,
and the stock market "is concerned that if the state of California
can prove that Enron manipulated the market--and this seems a step in
that direction--then some of the other companies did the same thing,"
said Mark Easterbrook, an analyst with RBC Dain Rauscher, an
investment firm.</LD>
<LD>   The head of the power industry's trade group said the Enron memos
"raise serious questions that must be resolved" and urged the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission to aggressively keep probing for any
wrongdoing.</LD>
<TE>   "If anyone ultimately is found to have engaged in these practices,
we will join with FERC and all California customers in condemning
this behavior and seeking appropriate remedies," Lynne Church,
president of the Electric Power Supply Assn., said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street chose to sell the industry's stocks and ask questions
later, and shares of power companies fell sharply regardless of their
market presence in California. Among the worst hit: Mirant Corp.,
which tumbled $1.34 a share, or 12%, to $9.75; Calpine Corp., down
$1.05, or 11%, to $8.70 a share, and Dynegy Inc., which plunged
$2.59, or 17%, to $12.26 a share, all on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   FERC late Monday released memos from Enron lawyers that outlined
tactics used by Enron's traders to create artificial power shortages
and increase the company's profits during California's energy crisis
in 2000-01. Critics immediately declared the documents the "smoking
gun" that proves Enron's culpability.</TE>
<TE>   The memos also mentioned other unidentified companies following
the same practices in California, echoing allegations made by state
officials that several power firms manipulated the state's
electricity market for their advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, strategies like those detailed in the Enron memos were not
unknown to California energy officials and were not confined to
Enron, according to a report last year by California's grid operator.</TE>
<TE>   The report accused electricity producers and resellers of
overcharging Californians by $6.7billion between May 2000 and March
2001, and bolstered the state's case that California is due as much
as $9billion in refunds from power companies.</TE>
<TE>   Several public and private energy sellers used a variety of
techniques, lumped together under the term "economic withholding," to
manipulate electricity prices in California, said the report,
prepared by economists for the California Independent System
Operator, which operates the state's electricity grid and market.</TE>
<TE>   The report, based on confidential bidding data, also discussed the
physical withholding of electricity by generators. That report did
not identify the companies involved, but a confidential document
later obtained by The Times revealed that Enron was sixth on a list
of 10 firms accused of reaping excessive profits in the California
market.</TE>
<TE>   Others on the list included Mirant, Reliant, Dynegy and Duke
Energy Corp. All the companies denied the allegations, and critics
have said the study was based on faulty assumptions.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the new Enron documents, "we stand by our [prior]
statements that we followed the rules," said John Sousa, a spokesman
for Houston-based Dynegy. "In no way did Dynegy engage in any
collusion with Enron, or any other company for that matter, in
connection with the bidding strategies disclosed in the [Enron]
memos."</TE>
<TE>   Reliant issued a statement saying, "The alleged actions of one
company should not be used as a blanket condemnation of all
participants in the California energy markets--be they wholesale
power generators, traders, marketers, investor-owned utilities,
municipally operated utilities, or the California Independent System
Operator."</TE>
<TE>   Some observers also cautioned against a rush to judgment of the
companies based on the newly disclosed Enron documents.</TE>
<TE>   Shannon Burchett, chief executive of energy consulting firm Risk
Ltd. in Irving, Texas, and a former energy trader, said the Enron
disclosure "doesn't prove anything about the culpability of anyone
else." But, he said, "it's a smoking gun that creates an impetus to
re-look at things with the other players" in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   The market is overreacting to headlines about the Enron memos
without actually reading the memos, said Jon Kyle Cartwright, senior
energy analyst with Raymond James &amp; Associates brokerage firm in St.
Petersburg, Fla. "When you have a panicky market, these are the
results."</TE>

<HD>Wells to Buy J.P. Morgan Trust Unit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wells Fargo &amp; Co., the fifth-largest U.S. bank, agreed to buy part of
J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.'s corporate trust and custody businesses in
Rochester, N.Y., Dallas and Houston to add about 700 customers.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco-based Wells Fargo didn't disclose the terms. The
assets include the management of 401(k) retirement and profit-sharing
plans for mostly mid-sized companies, said Laurie Nordquist,
executive vice president in charge of Wells' institutional trust
unit.</LD>
<LD>   The purchase, to close by the end of June, involves $5 billion to
$6 billion in assets in Texas, she said. The assets being sold are
part of J.P. Morgan Fleming Asset Management, which had $583 billion
under management at the end of the first quarter.</LD>
<TE>   "The Texas market is a key growth area for us," Nordquist said in
an interview. Two-thirds of the customers affected by the purchase
are in Texas and the rest are in Rochester, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Wells Fargo shares rose 32 cents to $51.30. J.P. Morgan closed up
23 cents to $34.63. Both are traded on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<AU>Mal Florence</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jay Mariotti of the Chicago Sun-Times has some advice for Chicago
Bull executive Jerry Krause:</LD>
<LD>   "Krause, we now know, has flopped. His rebuilding plan isn't on a
clock as much as a respirator, trying to keep pro basketball in
Chicago from flat-lining and fading away ...</LD>
<LD>   "So let me suggest an option for the Round Mound of Secaucus that
would make the Bulls a happening and turn them into an instant
playoff team. His name is Allen Iverson, and if the smoke out of
Philadelphia isn't exhaust from a cheesesteak grill, he'll soon be
available."</LD>
<TE>   In other words, get him!</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the NBA single-game playoff record for free
throws without a miss?</TE>
<TE>   He's seen it all: Sports Illustrated columnist Rick Reilly said
he's not afraid of death, explaining that one of his first
assignments with SI was a profile on Marge Schott, the crusty former
owner of the Cincinnati Reds:</TE>
<TE>   "We were set to shoot some pictures at her house and she comes out
wearing a lime-green teddy," Reilly said. "I've seen Marge Schott in
a lime-green teddy, so I'm not afraid to die."</TE>
<TE>   College educated: In his book, "Life's a Joe: Tales of a College
Basketball Vagabond," Jack Fertig, Fresno State's director of
basketball operations, recalls going to the Great Alaska Shootout as
an assistant coach at Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   The teams went to a gift shop in Anchorage, and one of the players
asked the clerk, "Do you take American money?"</TE>
<TE>   Deadline devastation: "Who wants to be a Cardinal beat writer?"
asks Dave van Dyck of Foxsports.com. "I mean, not even spell check
will help when Jason Simontacchi starts, Gene Stechschulte relieves,
and Jason Isringhausen closes."</TE>
<TE>   Moon man: Dwight Perry in the Seattle Times: "Seems like a good
time for the Baltimore Orioles to see what little-used catcher
Fernando Lunar can do in a night game."</TE>
<TE>   He's a card: American Express unveiled Tiger Woods' image on a new
credit card in Canada this week. Its annual fee ($62) is nearly twice
as much as a regular card in Canada ($34), but it offers several
golf-related benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't promise it will knock any strokes off your game, but I'm
sure you'll enjoy the game more if you've got one," Woods said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   Is it over already? Rudy Martzke in USA Today: "Candor award:
NBC's Tom Tolbert: 'San Antonio doesn't have a chance against the
Lakers anyway. But without David Robinson, forget it.'"</TE>
<TE>   Sweet deal: NBA star Tracy McGrady's new contract with Adidas pays
him royalties from all shoes and sports clothing sold under his name
for the rest of his life.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Karl Malone of Utah, 18, against the Lakers on May
10, 1997.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Jeff Gordon in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch: "With
baseball managers getting canned at a mind-boggling rate, high-strung
Philadelphia Phillies' Manager Larry Bowa is feeling the walls
closing in ... and it seems his players have tuned him out.</TE>
<TE>   "'We got a manager and coaches not getting any sleep,' Bowa
recently moped. 'And we've got players getting 12 hours a night.'"</TE>

<TE>   Kevin Conley, an editor for the New Yorker, decided there had been
enough written about the sex lives of humans. So he chose to write
about the sex life of horses.</TE>
<TE>   Although Seattle Slew is among the sires profiled in the book, it
opens with a visit to Overbrook Farm in Lexington, Ky., the home of
Storm Cat.</TE>
<TE>   Conley writes: "If the Kentucky Derby is the most exciting two
minutes in sports, then Storm Cat is the most expensive 30 seconds."</TE>
<TE>   Storm Cat's stud fee is nearly double that of his closest rival.
It's that high because his offspring has earned more than $21 million
at the track, almost $7 million more than anyone else's.</TE>
<TE>   Usually, when a champion thoroughbred "retires to stud," those
words are the last racing enthusiasts read about the horse. "$tud"
pulls back the curtain on a different aspect of the horse racing
world, and takes a voyeuristic look at the intimate acts and the
billion-dollar business behind them.</TE>
<TE>   Only slightly less intense than the action in the breeding shed
are the showdowns at the Keeneland auctions. Sheik Mohammed bin
Rashid al-Maktoum, the crown prince of Dubai who is profiled in
another recent horse racing book, "From the Desert to the Derby," is
among the unique characters included in this book.</TE>

<LD>I'll be at the parade. I'll buy Phil's next book. I might even read
it. I'll try to convince the grocery store bagger and my daughter to
name their first child--after they get married--after Kobe.</LD>
<LD>   But I will never consider these Lakers truly great champions.</LD>
<LD>   I KNOW, I know, it's all about winning championships, and the
Lakers will win again. Phil, the coach and former player, will have
10 fingers and 11 rings, so who knows, maybe even Jeanie will get a
ring out of this, if you know what I mean.</LD>
<TE>   But watching the Lakers play with heart and soul once the playoffs
begin, reminds me how often they don't play with heart and soul.
Chicago, Memphis, Golden State and the first half against San
Antonio....</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio? When you haven't shown up ready to play against teams
you're supposed to beat in the regular season, sometimes old habits
are hard to break.</TE>
<TE>   There is no penalty, of course, for losing to Chicago, Memphis,
Golden State, San Antonio ... when you wind up hugging the
championship trophy. That's probably why the paying customers in L.A.
don't let the Lakers have it when they disappoint, buying into the
sports cliche that it really is all about championships.</TE>
<TE>   And maybe it is for the players and coaches who will be measured
later in life by such standards. But for the paying customers, and
those of us who make our living watching games, it should be about
the anticipation, expectation and excitement that at any given moment
we will see something extraordinary from a gifted athlete.</TE>
<TE>   Inherent in that should be the expressed promise that we're
getting maximum effort in return for a ticket bought and attention
shown. The Lakers don't always do that. Chicago, Memphis, Golden
State....</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers went 15-1 during the playoffs last year after a bumpy
regular season, and played this season as if they already had an
automatic berth in the playoffs. They played the first half against
San Antonio Tuesday night as if they've been given a bye to the NBA
Finals. What a shock if they're wrong.</TE>
<TE>   That's the only danger in thinking you can turn it on when you
want, everyone lining up behind War Emblem in the Kentucky Derby
expecting to turn it on the stretch, but it all getting away from
them.</TE>
<TE>   It's all about pre-race and pre-playoff strategy, Phil is so good
at what he does, he can arrange it so he's sitting in a hot tub with
Jeanie at the All-Star break instead of coaching the game.</TE>
<TE>   Phil is so good he can send Lindsey Hunter and Samaki Walker out
like some kind of rock 'n' roll warm-up act when the regular season
starts, and then bring on Brian Shaw and Robert Horry for the main
playoff show.</TE>
<TE>   Phil is so good there is no need to go to the whip down the
stretch, and secure the home-court advantage throughout the playoffs.
He's so good, I'm sure he knew Dallas would take care of that for
him.</TE>
<TE>   If it's all about championships, Phil should have been named the
coach of the year Tuesday for pacing the Lakers and positioning them
once again to win it all. He didn't get a single vote, however, and
that's the price to be paid for making it appear as if a team is on
automatic pilot until it's time to turn it on.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe if he stood up once in a while during the regular season we
would feel that everyone is trying to win every game.</TE>
<TE>   None of this, of course, will besmirch the banner that will be
hung in Staples at the start of next season, but I will poise the
same question I did on opening night this season: Why can't the
Lakers go 82-0?</TE>
<TE>   The answer, I'm sure, will be the same: Why work that hard?</TE>
<TE>   THE NEXT big sports issue facing Los Angeles will be the future of
Dodger Stadium, which sits grand as ever after 40 years, but now
lacks the gold mine inside that is stadium sports today, and that is
state-of-the-art luxury suites.</TE>
<TE>   Now wouldn't it make more sense to build a baseball stadium
downtown a few blocks from Staples Center instead of a football
stadium? Consider the impact two well-used sports venues like Staples
Center and Dodger Stadium would have on downtown development.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, which is in a fix given Dodger Stadium's popularity and
traditionalists' reluctance to mess with it, is already a partner
with the Anschutz Empire in Staples Center and could expand that
relationship.</TE>
<TE>   That would leave Chavez Ravine available for Peter O'Malley and
the NFL to develop for football.</TE>
<TE>   And with new football and baseball stadiums, only one of them
would have to be named after me.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'M HEARING now the NFL hopes to encourage Phil Anschutz to buy an
NFL franchise and bring it to L.A. rather than negotiate with owners
who might want to move here along with their team. I'm told they've
encouraged Anschutz to begin with Charger owner Alex Spanos, and if
unsuccessful, talk with the Saints and Vikings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SOME RAIDER fans e-mailed to say the team will move to L.A. after
it wins its legal battles in Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't realize prison inmates have Internet access.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CHICK HEARN bobble-head dolls will be sold at Just Sports USA
stores for $25. They'll be sold at Staples Center in Team LA for $30.
Now you know why Anschutz is a billionaire.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PENTHOUSE MAGAZINE says it's a mistake. Those nude pictures of
Anna Kournikova were nude pictures of Judith E. Soltesz-Benetton.
Based on my observation, I thought that from the very beginning,
although I did go back for a second look to make sure I hadn't jumped
to conclusions.</TE>

<LD>We can hear the hearts of the San Antonio Spurs beating loud and
clear. No stethoscope needed.</LD>
<LD>   They could have listened to what everyone said, realized that they
blew their chance to snag a game at Staples Center and simply stepped
aside so we could all concentrate on watching Sacramento vs. Dallas
and Jason Kidd vs. Baron Davis in the other playoff series.</LD>
<LD>   They could have panicked when the Lakers threw their best stretch
of ball this postseason at them and the house was rockin'.</LD>
<TE>   They could have lived down to the label attached to them ever
since they got swept out of the playoffs last year: that they lacked
the heart and tenacity to compete with the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Right now the only body part missing is, well, David Robinson's
body. But even with his bad back keeping him out of action, they
still got an 88-85 victory in Game 2, they got the one victory they
needed early to procure home-court advantage in this series.</TE>
<TE>   No one ever bothered with the matchups when they looked at Lakers
vs. Spurs. It was always "Spurs don't have the heart. Now, can
Sacramento or Dallas run-and-gun and shoot their way past the
Lakers?"</TE>
<TE>   We now know for sure that the Spurs don't need any major organ
transplants. They did what they had to do.</TE>
<TE>   "It was semi-must win," said Tim Duncan, never prone to hyperbole.</TE>
<TE>   Now, let's go into Hubie Brown mode for a minute:</TE>
<TE>   See, if I'm the Spurs, I have to get this game ... be-CAUSE the
Lakers just went through a half in which they had a 39% shooting
quarter followed by a 19-point quarter. I have both of their big guns
in foul trouble. If I still manage to lose this game, I might as well
forget the rest of the series and go home and go to sleep on the
couch.</TE>
<TE>   Ah--kag-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't seem to matter that the Spurs didn't have
Robinson--again. They got contributions from all over the roster.</TE>
<TE>   They had Antonio Daniels scoring 14 points.</TE>
<TE>   They had Danny Ferry, his sprained right wrist still heavily
bandaged, pushing in jump shots.</TE>
<TE>   They had Tony Parker zipping past Lakers, breaking down their
defense and picking up nine assists.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs had 24 assists on 34 field goals. That's getting it
done.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a total team effort," Daniels said.</TE>
<TE>   Everything worked so well that even when Coach Gregg Popovich
wanted to call a timeout, they wound up getting a three-point play
out of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Play slowed down, the Spurs coaches and reserves leaked onto the
court and everyone stopped. Except Daniels, who raced to the basket,
drew a foul on Samaki Walker and made a layup plus the free throw.</TE>
<TE>   "We did not call that," Popovich said. "That was luck."</TE>
<TE>   And of course, they had Tim Duncan doing Duncan stuff, like
banking home jumpers, pulling down rebounds and blocking shots. He
had 27 points, 17 rebounds, five assists and five blocked shots,
which was all enough to offset his 10 turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan's like a great linebacker in that he's always around the
ball. You see him reaching for many of the rebounds he doesn't get.
He makes every effort to protect the rim as the last line of defense
(even if it means getting dunked on by a growing list of Lakers that
now includes Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O'Neal and Robert Horry).</TE>
<TE>   Ever since the playoffs started, the Lakers have been offering
games up to whoever wanted to take them.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs finally took advantage of all the Laker inadequacies and
pulled away to a 21-point lead during the first half. They watched
the Lakers cut it all the way down to four points during the third
period, blinked and pushed the lead back to double-digits.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers know a little about heart as well. Can't win
back-to-back championships without it. So they were right there at
the end again, down by five points with 3:05 remaining, then down by
three with half a minute left and Bryant casting one from behind the
arc.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't go down. Neither did the Spurs.</TE>
<TE>   Even if they started tightening up, felt the pressure squeezing in
on them and missed several shots down the stretch, they still made
the hustle plays and dug out seven offensive rebounds in the fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   And on the Lakers' last gasp, after O'Neal stole the ball from
Duncan and got it ahead to Bryant with only two points separating the
teams, it was the type of recovery defense they played all night that
kept Bryant from tying the game.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant was surrounded. He had Rick Fox open for a moment below the
basket, but the defense closed out, and not even Bryant's wondrous
hang time could bail him out of this. There was no where to pass, so
he threw the ball back over his body, then ran and chased it down.</TE>
<TE>   Passing to himself. Traveling.</TE>
<TE>   And now this series--and it's definitely a series now--travels to
San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   Deep in the Texas, there's heart.</TE>

<HD>Ordonez, Thomas Put Big Hurt on Rangers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Chicago White Sox had their big-inning offense on display again
Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Magglio Ordonez hit a three-run homer and Frank Thomas had a
two-run single in an eight-run sixth inning, leading the White Sox
over the Texas Rangers, 11-6, at Arlington, Texas.</LD>
<LD>   "We really turned it on in the sixth," said Thomas, who drove in
three runs. "We're all able to hit on this team, one through nine. We
don't get too excited about it because we've been hitting like this
all year, but we definitely hit in spurts."</LD>
<TE>   The White Sox scored 10 runs or more for the seventh time this
season after reaching double-digits in 11 games last season. Chicago
has had four runs or more in an inning 21 times in 2002 and 10 hits
or more 20 times.</TE>
<TE>   Rafael Palmeiro, a three-time Gold Glove at first base, made his
second error of the game on Kenny Lofton's grounder, which drove in
Mark Johnson from third with the go-ahead run.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 9, Oakland 7--Trot Nixon had three hits, including a solo
home run, and four runs batted in at Oakland to help the Red Sox win
their seventh in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Rolando Arrojo (2-0) went 22/3 relief innings and gave up one hit.
Ugueth Urbina gave up Eric Chavez's run-scoring single and Terrence
Long's sacrifice fly in the ninth before earning his 12th save.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 4, Seattle 1--Roy Halladay scattered four hits over 72/3
innings to lead the Blue Jays at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Halladay (2-1) had a shutout until the eighth inning, when Mike
Cameron tripled to drive in Ichiro Suzuki. Halladay struck out five
and walked one.</TE>
<TE>   New York 5, Tampa Bay 2--Alfonso Soriano drove in two runs at St.
Petersburg, Fla., and the Yankees sent the Devil Rays to their 12th
consecutive loss--the longest slide in the major leagues since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay set a team record for consecutive defeats and the
Yankees ended a three-game skid behind Mike Mussina (4-2) and Mariano
Rivera, who earned the 224th save of his career to tie the team
record set by Dave Righetti.</TE>
<TE>   Mussina gave up four hits, struck out five and walked one in seven
innings.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 4, Cleveland 3--Jerry Hairston had three hits and scored
the winning run on a grounder by Jeff Conine in the bottom of the
10th.</TE>
<TE>   Conine hit a grounder to shortstop Omar Vizquel, who forced Gary
Matthews Jr. at second, but the relay by Ricky Gutierrez was too late
to get Conine.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 4, Minnesota 1--Paul Byrd pitched seven shutout
innings at Minneapolis to lead Kansas City to its first victory under
interim Manager John Mizerock.</TE>

<HD>Washburn Doesn't Have Time on His Side</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Rolling Stones will play Edison Field on Nov. 2, but cue the
honky-tonk blues for Jarrod Washburn this morning. When you throw a
no-hitter for five innings and a one-hit shutout for seven, and your
team loses, well, you can't get no satisfaction.</LD>
<LD>   Washburn's string of zeroes Tuesday counted for nothing.</LD>
<LD>   After he faced 26 batters without giving up a run, reliever Ben
Weber faced two batters and gave up two runs. Dennis Cook faced three
and gave up a third run, and so the potential no-hitter and shutout
were just faded memories in the Angels' 3-0 loss to the Detroit
Tigers.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel bad for everybody," Weber said. "I went in there to try to
keep the score the way it was, and I didn't do it. So we lost."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' bullpen collapse obscured a happy story for the
Tigers, the first major league victory in four years for starter Seth
Greisinger.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels like this great reward," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Greisinger, who pitched for the U.S. Olympic team in 1996 and
rocketed into the Detroit rotation in 1998, missed the last three
seasons after reconstructive elbow surgery. The last time he faced
the Angels, Phil Nevin drove in two runs in support of knuckleballer
Steve Sparks, the winning pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   In seven innings, he shut out the Angels on four hits and 98
pitches. He did everything right except forget to grab the game ball.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe I'll grab a ball from the bag and pretend it was the game
ball," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Without the help of catcher Brandon Inge, Greisinger would have
nothing to commemorate. Inge led off the eighth inning and greeted
Weber with an opposite-field home run, breaking a scoreless tie on
what pitcher and hitter thought was a pretty good sinker.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels botched their best chance to score. With one out in the
seventh inning, a hit-and-run single by Brad Fullmer advanced Troy
Glaus to third base. If Tim Salmon could hit the ball out of the
infield, the Angels would score.</TE>
<TE>   But, on a check swing, Salmon dribbled the ball in front of the
plate and was easily thrown out. Salmon went hitless in three
at-bats, failing to get the ball out of the infield every time, and
his average dropped to .182.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn was supportive of his offense and bullpen. The offense
had scored 26 runs in his previous three starts, and Weber and Cook
each pitched a scoreless inning in his previous start.</TE>
<TE>   From the first batter, Washburn offered a hint of a special
evening. He struck out the first two batters, in fact. He struck out
two more in the second.</TE>
<TE>   He is not a strikeout pitcher. He struck out two more in the
fourth. He had matched his season high with six strikeouts, and this
was 11 batters into the game.</TE>
<TE>   To that point, Washburn was perfect--11 up, 11 down. He walked the
12th batter, then retired the next four to keep the no-hitter intact
through five innings.</TE>
<TE>   With one out in the sixth, Inge walked. Jose Macias then grounded
sharply into right field, a clean hit but an agonizing one
nonetheless. Second baseman Adam Kennedy dived to his left, fully
extended his glove hand and missed the ball by inches.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I'll ever throw a no-hitter," Washburn said.</TE>
<TE>   So the Tigers had runners on first and second, and then Robert
Fick walked to load the bases. The no-hitter was done, and now the
shutout was 90 feet away from being done. And the Tigers had their
best hitter, Bobby Higginson, at the plate.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn reared back and struck him out, for the second out.
Randall Simon flied out, on an over-the-shoulder catch by Garret
Anderson that was so pretty Washburn paused along the third-base line
to give Anderson a high-five as the Angels returned to the dugout.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn preserved the shutout through the seventh inning, but
seven strikeouts and four walks kept his pitch count up. He threw 71
pitches through five innings and a season-high 113 through seven.</TE>
<TE>   He received no decision but plenty of congratulations. In his last
four starts, he is 3-0 with a 2.67 earned-run average.</TE>

<HD>Glaus Is Warming to Spotlight</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>Although third baseman Troy Glaus led the American League in home
runs two years ago and played in the All-Star game in each of the
last two seasons, his national profile hovers just above invisible,
in part because Glaus is shy and uneasy in the spotlight.</LD>
<LD>   But that was Glaus on an ESPN interview show Tuesday, laughing,
telling stories and enjoying himself.</LD>
<LD>   As he started his major league career, Glaus was notoriously
reticent around reporters. Now, in his fourth season with the Angels,
he has warmed up to interviews and public appearances, so much so he
says he would consider endorsing a product. No one has ever asked him
to do so, he said.</LD>
<TE>   "It'd be fun," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the event of a deal, he promises to remember he is a ballplayer
first and an endorser second.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my job," he said. "My job is not to go on TV and market
everything I can."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To no one's surprise, Darin Erstad plays the outfield exactly as
he did before sustaining a concussion 18 days ago. In Cleveland last
week, in a game the Angels led, 4-0, he made a diving catch. In
Toronto on Sunday, in a game the Angels led, 7-0, he crashed into the
center-field wall in an unsuccessful attempt to make a catch.</TE>
<TE>   Although medical studies suggest one concussion increases the risk
of another, Erstad said he isn't worried about getting hurt.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never really been too concerned about that," he said. "If
something happens, it happens. You play hard. You do everything you
can to stay as healthy as you can."</TE>
<TE>   Erstad, who missed eight days while recovering from the
concussion, said the headaches that bothered him are long gone.</TE>
<TE>   "I still get fatigued a little more than I normally would, but
that might be from not playing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   First baseman Shawn Wooten, eight weeks removed from surgery to
repair a torn ligament in his right thumb, hopes to receive medical
clearance Friday to take batting practice.</TE>
<TE>   Wooten is targeting June 1 as his return date, but the Angels
would be happy if he returns by mid-June. The Angels have considered
acquiring a right-handed bat, but the urgency evaporated as the team
won nine of 10 games, and so a spot remains available for him.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if they'll want me back, the way they've been
playing," Wooten joked.</TE>

<LD>Boston pitcher Frank Castillo was suspended Tuesday for five games
for hitting a batter Sunday, and teammate Trot Nixon was suspended
for four games for throwing his bat at a Tampa Bay pitcher.</LD>
<LD>   They were fined by Bob Watson, baseball's vice president in charge
of discipline, as was Devil Ray pitcher Ryan Rupe. Watson said Rupe
intentionally hit Nomar Garciaparra and Shea Hillenbrand with
pitches.</LD>
<LD>   The Major League Baseball Players Assn. appealed, meaning the
suspensions cannot start until after a hearing before Bob DuPuy,
baseball's chief operating officer.</LD>
<TE>   Rupe denied he intentionally threw at Garciaparra or Hillenbrand,
who had hit a pinch-hit grand slam to win the previous night's game.</TE>
<TE>   "My intentions were not to hurt anyone or hit anyone," Rupe said,
adding that he didn't believe Nixon and Castillo should have been
suspended for their actions.</TE>

<HD>Jordan Feels Right at Home in Dodger Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Gary Sheffield reminded his former team he's still a show-stopper no
matter the uniform, and Brian Jordan also brought the crowd to its
feet Tuesday night in the first regular-season showdown between the
Dodgers and Atlanta Braves after their blockbuster off-season trade.</LD>
<LD>   But it was the bit players who provided a stirring closing act for
the Dodgers, helping them outlast the Braves, 6-5, in 16 innings to
take the opener of a three-game series at Turner Field.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan and Sheffield hit dramatic two-out, ninth-inning home runs,
with Sheffield's forcing extra innings after Jordan's go-ahead blast,
but the Dodgers got better overall performances from role players in
winning the 5-hour 19-minute marathon before what remained of a crowd
of 26,914.</LD>
<TE>   Giovanni Carrara (2-0) gave up only two hits in working five
stellar shutout innings. Jesse Orosco, the Dodgers' sixth pitcher,
overcame issuing a leadoff walk in the 16th to record his first save
since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a couple of step-up performances from two quality
major league players," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said of Jordan and
Sheffield. "The performance of Brian Jordan, the at-bat that Gary
Sheffield gave them with two out in the bottom of the ninth inning.
The resiliency, once again, of our bullpen.... It was a fantastic
baseball game. That's all you can say."</TE>
<TE>   After leadoff batter Cesar Izturis fouled out to start the 16th,
Marquis Grissom singled to center for his second hit in seven
at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   With Shawn Green at the plate, Tracy sent Grissom, who easily beat
catcher Javy Lopez's throw, and advanced to third when the ball
eluded Marcus Giles and rolled into center for an error. The Braves
then decided to intentionally walk Green and pitch to Paul Lo Duca.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca, hitless in five at-bats after staking the Dodgers to a
1-0 lead in the first on a run-scoring double, grounded to third
baseman Vinny Castilla for what appeared to be the start of an
inning-ending double play.</TE>
<TE>   Castilla threw to Giles for the first out and, with Green running
hard, Giles bounced a throw that beat Lo Duca. However, first baseman
Julio Franco dropped the ball, enabling Grissom to score the go-ahead
run.</TE>
<TE>   "We get a run because Shawn Green went hard into second base to
disrupt a double play," Tracy said. Orosco immediately encountered
problems on reliving Carrara, walking Lopez, who was forced on
Franco's fielder's choice. Henry Blanco, batting for Kerry
Ligtenberg, flied out and Giles struck out swinging to end the game.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, traded from the Braves to the Dodgers with Odalis Perez in
a four-player deal for Sheffield on Jan. 15, broke a 4-4 tie in the
ninth with a two-out solo shot to left against reliever Darren
Holmes. But Sheffield also has a flair for the dramatic.</TE>
<TE>   He matched Jordan's big moment in the Braves half of the inning,
connecting on a 96-mph fastball against closer Eric Gagne, hitting a
421-foot homer to center.</TE>
<TE>   The homer was his first since April 4 against the Phillies,
spanning 81 at-bats. Sheffield circled the bases in a trot the
Dodgers had witnessed many times and pointed skyward on crossing the
plate.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't surprised because I haven't seen a fastball that man
can't hit," Tracy said of Sheffield. "He lives for moments like
that."</TE>
<TE>   Sheffield's timely blast against Gagne was unsettling for the
Dodgers, but they were even more frustrated by their failure to
execute in key situations.</TE>
<TE>   They left the bases loaded in the third and fourth and, tied at
4-4 in the sixth, they also failed to score the go ahead-run after
Jeff Reboulet, batting for starter Hideo Nomo, led off with a double.
He was stranded at third.</TE>
<TE>   "I was happy for Sheff," Jordan said. "He's trying hard just like
me--almost too hard. For him to come through for the Braves there was
big.... I hated that he sent it into extra innings, but I'm happy for
him."</TE>

<HD>Ishii Proving to Be a Bargain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>The contract General Manager Dan Evans negotiated with pitcher
Kazuhisa Ishii is even more favorable for the Dodgers than initially
believed.</LD>
<LD>   Ishii signed a four-year, $12.2-million contract with the Dodgers
after they bid $11.26 million to negotiate with him. However, because
$4.5 million of the contract is deferred without interest, the
adjusted total is about $9.8 million.</LD>
<LD>   In comparison, Kevin Brown and Darren Dreifort have higher average
annual salaries--at $15 million and $11 million, respectively--than
Ishii will be paid in the length of his contract. The left-hander is
earning his money, going 6-0 with a 2.95 earned-run average in six
starts since overcoming his anxiety about succeeding in the major
leagues after a standout 10-year career in Japan.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers made some concessions to Ishii, agreeing to provide
him with a sport utility vehicle each regular season, a $25,000
housing allowance, eight round-trip business-class tickets per season
to Japan and six tickets for each game he pitches at Dodger Stadium.
But considering the former regime gave Kevin Brown use of a plane, it
appears the Dodgers are making progress under Evans, who developed a
reputation as a shrewd negotiator with the Chicago White Sox.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Much has been made of right fielder Shawn Green's defensive
positioning late in games because three balls that could have been
caught landed in front of him recently.</TE>
<TE>   Some have suggested that Green, who won a Gold Glove award with
the Toronto Blue Jays in 1999, plays too deep and needs to change his
approach. Manager Jim Tracy has spoken with Green, who is struggling
through a season-long batting slump, and the Dodgers believe that too
much has been made of the situation.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had some miscommunication," first baseman Eric Karros said.
"Some balls have just happened to find holes where neither me or
[second baseman Mark Grudzielanek] could get to."</TE>

<LD>Highlight reel: Anybody questioning the choice of Tim Duncan for most
valuable player? With his team trailing, 21-15, and in danger of
slipping out of another game, Duncan took over. He fed Bruce Bowen
for a layup, blocked a Samaki Walker shot and scored, got a rebound
leading to a 19-foot jumper by Danny Ferry, then another rebound
leading to a three-pointer by Bowen. Nine consecutive points by the
Spurs to end the period with Duncan having a hand in each. Any more
questions?</LD>
<LD>   Not in the box score: In one of a series of skits for the video
board, Shaquille O'Neal was shown being held against his will in a
hospital bed, prevented from playing in Game 2. With the help of
Derek Fisher, O'Neal overpowers his guard, switches into his uniform
in a revolving door, a la his hero, Superman, leaps into the air,
soars over Dodger Stadium and makes it onto the floor for Game 2.</LD>
<LD>   Winning number: Eight, the number of rebounds for Duncan, all but
one of his team's total.</LD>
<TE>   Wrong number: 39.1%, the Lakers' field-goal percentage. As was the
case in Game 1, they struggled from the field.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Fisher 6, O'Neal and Rick Fox 4;
Spurs--Duncan and Bowen 7.</TE>

<LD>Forgive Carlos Ruiz if he somehow scores an own-goal tonight at the
Rose Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   The rookie Galaxy forward is, after all, only six games into his
Major League Soccer career after spending six of the previous seven
years with the Galaxy's opponent, CSD Municipal of Guatemala, in an
international "friendly" exhibition.</LD>
<LD>   "It's going to be very emotional," said Ruiz, a native of
Guatemala who is leading MLS in scoring (12 points) and goals (six).
"I still have a lot of friends on the team and a lot of good
memories. It will be fun."</LD>
<TE>   But besides sharing laughs and war stories, the Rojos will be a
stern test for the Galaxy, which is coming off a 2-1 overtime victory
at Kansas City.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Shoemaker never rode Seattle Slew, but the jockey played key
roles in three of the Triple Crown winner's races and two of his
defeats.</LD>
<LD>   Seattle Slew might not even have won the Triple Crown but for the
sportsmanship of Shoemaker in the 1977 Kentucky Derby. Undefeated in
six starts, Seattle Slew went into the Derby at top-heavy 1-2 odds.
Shoemaker was riding Get The Axe, who was on a seven-race losing
streak and went off at 27-1.</LD>
<LD>   Seattle Slew drew the No. 4 post, just inside Shoemaker's mount.
When the gate opened, Seattle Slew was leaning to the right. He
brushed the side of the stall coming out, almost dislodging jockey
Jean Cruguet.</LD>
<TE>   Get The Axe broke promptly, leaving Seattle Slew wedged between
horses and appearing to take Cruguet out of his game plan. Seattle
Slew had won all six of his races on the lead.</TE>
<TE>   Talking on the phone Tuesday, after he was told that Seattle Slew
had died earlier in the day, Shoemaker remembered his 20th Derby. He
had already won three and, at 54, would win a fourth with Ferdinand
in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   "Cruguet hollered something at me," Shoemaker said. "He wanted me
to get out of his way. So I eased my horse out a little. About [a
horse width and a half]. Just enough to give Seattle Slew some
breathing room. But if I don't do that, who knows? Maybe he doesn't
get into the race and maybe he doesn't win. We'll never know, will
we?"</TE>
<TE>   After Seattle Slew had won the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes to
wrap up the Triple Crown, he was shipped to California to run in the
Swaps Stakes at Hollywood Park. Marje Everett, who ran the track
then, had increased the purse by $100,000 to $300,000 and, in
anticipation of another victory by Seattle Slew, asked her friend,
Cary Grant, to present the trophy in the winner's circle.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Slew, coming back only three weeks after the Belmont, had
six horses to beat, one of them J.O. Tobin, who would be ridden by
Shoemaker. J.O. Tobin hadn't run in the Derby, had finished a
troubled fifth in the Preakness, then had set a course record for
11/8 miles on grass in his prep for the Swaps.</TE>
<TE>   "I was telling people that he was good enough to win," Shoemaker
said, "but I don't think anybody believed me. Even then they thought
I was old and senile. But I was confident against Seattle Slew."</TE>
<TE>   Shoemaker didn't believe that J.O. Tobin's Preakness was a true
bill.</TE>
<TE>   "We got stopped every which way that day," he said. "He didn't
break well, and then when he took off, he ran up on other horses.
Then on the far turn, he ran into trouble again, and we had trouble
getting clear going into the stretch. He still finished fifth, got
beat by less than five lengths and had 10 lengths' worth of trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Slew never reached contention in the Swaps. The tone of
track announcer Harry Henson's call dismissed him early. At 1-5, the
Triple Crown champion struggled home fourth, beaten by 16 lengths.
His handlers had asked him to do too much.</TE>
<TE>   J.O. Tobin won by eight lengths, running 11/4 miles in 1:583/5.
Down the stretch, the crowd of 68,132, which had probably been
prepared to shout, "Slew! Slew! Slew!", instead shouted, "Shoe! Shoe!
Shoe!"</TE>
<TE>   Johnny Adams, the Hall of Fame former jockey, was training J.O.
Tobin.</TE>
<TE>   "Johnny did a hell of a job with that horse," Shoemaker said. "He
worked and worked with him in the mornings, and got him to relax.
Later, the horse was turned over to Laz Barrera, and became a
speed-crazy horse. He didn't do much after that."</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Slew was given the rest of the year off. He began 1978
with two allowance wins, then was upset by Dr. Patches in the
Paterson Handicap at the Meadowlands. The fall series of races was
much anticipated, because Affirmed, who had just won the Triple
Crown, was going to be banging heads with Seattle Slew--Triple Crown
champions had never met before--and California trainer Charlie
Whittingham was bringing the highly regarded Exceller, with Shoemaker
riding, to Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   In the Marlboro Cup, Seattle Slew was a powerful three-length
winner. Affirmed finished second. Affirmed skipped the Woodward, and
Seattle Slew won again, beating Exceller by four lengths.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the Jockey Club Gold Cup, at 11/2 miles, with all three
horses running.</TE>
<TE>   Affirmed's saddle slipped, jockey Steve Cauthen was fortunate to
stay aboard and they finished fifth. Cruguet had been fired after the
Paterson and Angel Cordero was riding Seattle Slew. Their sustained
battle to the wire with Exceller was one for the ages.</TE>
<TE>   "We went by in the stretch, and I thought it was all over,"
Shoemaker said. "But Seattle Slew came back on and almost got us.
This was his best race."</TE>
<TE>   The finish was so close that the naked eye couldn't separate the
horses. The photo-finish camera showed that Exceller had won by the
shortest of noses. Shoemaker had bested the Triple Crown champion
again.</TE>

<LD>Four days after the Kentucky Derby, the focus is still on Churchill
Downs.</LD>
<LD>   Well, at least for pick six players it is. Thanks to some upsets
Saturday, capped by War Emblem's $43 stunner in the Derby, there is a
carry-over of $348,152 awaiting today.</LD>
<LD>   Churchill Downs is always dark the day after its signature event,
so this is the resumption of racing and post time has changed. For
the rest of its meet, which continues until July 7, the Louisville
track runs at 3:10 p.m. EDT on weekdays, meaning the first race is
simulcast locally at 12:10 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   The pick six begins on the third race and continues through the
eighth. Unlike California, and most other venues, it is a $1--rather
than $2--wager.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Day, the winningest rider in Churchill Downs history, is named
on horses in four of the six races in the sequence.</TE>
<TE>   He is scheduled to ride Capote Laday, a first-time starter for
trainer Dale Romans in the fourth; Super X One, an also-eligible in
the sixth, a maiden race on turf; Jo Dinah, a 3-year-old filly who
will run against six others in the seventh at seven furlongs, and
Screenplay, a 5-year-old gelding who is among 13 entrants in the
eighth, a $50,000 claimer at one mile on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of hours earlier, Belmont Park will begin its
spring-summer meet with a nine-race card topped by the $100,000
Westchester Handicap at one mile.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Total Impact, second behind Kentucky Derby
also-ran Essence Of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates Derby in Dubai
on March 23, will make his first start since then for trainer Laura
De Seroux in today's seventh at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Victor Espinoza. The jockey followed up his Kentucky
Derby win with a victory on Night Patrol, an 8-1 shot, in Sunday's
Inglewood Handicap at Hollywood Park. Espinoza not only rode each of
the nine races on Sunday's card the day after his biggest win, but
also spent time before the opener doing a question-and-answer session
with the public.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Isaias Enriquez and Matt Garcia. The two riders have
begun the Hollywood Park meet a combined 0 for 30.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A trifecta in the third using Crowned Dancer
on top with Champ's Gold, Expression and Shark Fin Soup in the two
hole and all in the third spot.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 4/25. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $18.60/$132.60. Total money bet: $174.</TE>

<LD>The New York Rangers and Dallas Stars have been granted permission
from the Kings to talk to assistant coach Dave Tippett about their
head coaching vacancies, NHL sources said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Tippett, 40, is one of the league's most highly regarded
assistants. He oversees the King power play, which led the league
this season, and was interim coach for five games in late February
and early March while Coach Andy Murray recuperated from injuries
suffered in a traffic accident.</LD>
<LD>   A forward who played 11 seasons in the NHL with the Hartford
Whalers, Washington Capitals, Pittsburgh Penguins and Philadelphia
Flyers, Tippett also is a two-time Olympian who was captain of the
Canadian team in 1984.</LD>
<TE>   As coach and general manager, Tippett guided the Houston Aeros of
the International Hockey League to the Turner Cup championship in
1999. He has been a member of Murray's staff for the last three
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jamie Storr, the Kings' backup goaltender, has been added to the
Team Canada roster for the World Ice Hockey Championships underway in
Sweden.</TE>

<HD>O'Neal Laughs Off MVP Voting</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It appears Shaquille O'Neal won't be league most valuable player
again, finishing third this season after slogging through 67 games on
a bad toe.</LD>
<LD>   He touted Kobe Bryant as his choice in training camp, which raised
the perception he'd defer parts of his game to the young and
ambitious Bryant, and then did not have enough rebounds to qualify
with the league leaders. He averaged 10.7 rebounds, which would have
ranked seventh, and 27.2 points, second to Allen Iverson's 31.4.</LD>
<LD>   By all reports, San Antonio's Tim Duncan will be MVP, followed by
New Jersey's Jason Kidd. The near-unanimous MVP two years ago, O'Neal
finished behind Iverson and Duncan last year, and by Tuesday evening
was somewhat disturbed he would be overlooked again.</LD>
<TE>   "In the state of California, there's no justice when a 211
occurs," said O'Neal, a slight smile across his face. "Once again,
I've been robbed. Robbery!"</TE>
<TE>   Then he laughed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers aren't big on individual postseason awards.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Jackson, who has coached eight of the last 10 NBA champions
and has been coach of the year one time, did not get a vote in this
year's balloting.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't get a vote last year, either.</TE>
<TE>   He was, however, CBA coach of the year in 1985, when the Albany
Patroons won 34 of 48 games.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Isiah Thomas, Don Nelson and Doug Collins all got
votes, and Maurice Cheeks, who guided one of the most expensive
rosters in the NBA to a sixth-place finish in the Western Conference,
got four.</TE>
<TE>   Told about the Collins vote, Jackson smiled and said, "Most of the
local writers will vote for their coach."</TE>
<TE>   In the annual balloting among coaches, Jackson said he'd voted for
Utah's Jerry Sloan four consecutive times.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Part of the challenge with O'Neal's stitches, strung along the top
crease on his right forefinger, was bandaging the wound in a way that
would protect it and allow him some touch on the basketball.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Gary Vitti adhered a light pad with tape, and left the tip
exposed.</TE>
<TE>   "If he was a three-point shooter," Jackson said, "I'd say [I was
worried]."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have taken a 1-0 lead in 45 previous best-of-seven
series and have won 40 of them. The Spurs have never won a
best-of-seven after losing the first game, in nine tries.... O'Neal
had 3,056 career playoff points going into Game 2, 32 fewer than
Julius Erving, who is 14th on the all-time list.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Fall Off an Edge</HD>
<DH>Game 2: Duncan comes up big and San Antonio evens series as
L.A. loses first playoff game of season when furious rally comes up
short.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The NBA playoffs began on a Tuesday night in May, late as far as the
postseason goes, but that's when the Lakers began to pay for their
ordinary side.</LD>
<LD>   Twice champions and occasionally on a recognizable course for the
third, they lost a game, their home-court advantage and an ounce of
their invincibility to a league previously very willing to believe
otherwise.</LD>
<LD>   Hoisted by Tim Duncan, expected to become league most valuable
player Thursday, the San Antonio Spurs were 88-85 winners at Staples
Center before a crowd that did not--could not--sit for the final
three dramatic and frantic minutes.</LD>
<TE>   The best-of-seven Western Conference semifinals are tied at a game
apiece, with Game 3 at San Antonio on Friday night, and Game 4 two
days later. Duncan had 27 points, 17 rebounds and five blocked shots
for the Spurs, who played again without their center, David Robinson.</TE>
<TE>   "We're right where we want to be," Duncan said.</TE>
<TE>   He kept the Spurs just ahead of the Lakers, who played at the end
to reconcile three quarters of basketball that was sometimes average
and often dismal. Kobe Bryant was called for traveling on the
critical final possession, moments after Shaquille O'Neal stole the
ball from Duncan on the wing, with 8.4 seconds remaining and the
Spurs ahead, 87-85.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant raced down the court and toward the rim. At what appeared
to be an indecisive moment, Bryant lost the ball in the lane, landed,
then batted it toward teammate Derek Fisher. The violation was called
with 1.3 seconds left, and then Duncan made a free throw with
two-tenths remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Half-an-hour later, walking through his locker room, Bryant
shouted, "The party just got started, fellas."</TE>
<TE>   The playoffs, the Laker postseason and their three-peat desires,
everything they played toward for six months, it all felt fresh and
vulnerable as they left the floor after their first home loss in 19
games, and their second playoff loss in 22.</TE>
<TE>   "The series doesn't really start until you lose one at home,"
Bryant said later. "This is when the fun begins. It's now competitive
basketball. ... And now we're going up to their home court, where
they're going to have 36,000 fans screaming and hollering. Duncan's
going to get his well-deserved MVP award. There's going to be a lot
of emotion in that game. I'm really looking forward to that. I'm sure
my teammates are too."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant shook his head. He scored 26 points, 20 in the second half.
O'Neal, pestered by a stitched and bandaged finger, missed nine of 16
shots and took only seven rebounds in 40 minutes, perhaps in part
because Coach Phil Jackson ran him into a fourth foul before
halftime.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers came from 10 points back to one point back in the late
part of the fourth quarter, however, when things went wrong for the
last time. O'Neal missed a jump hook, Bryant missed a three-pointer
and Fisher, after a strong offensive rebound, missed a free throw,
and the Spurs won despite scoring three points in the final 6:23.</TE>
<TE>   "We almost got away with it again," said Bryant, who played with a
bruise below his right knee. "Almost got away with it."</TE>
<TE>   Game 2 had all of the old issues. The early deficits, the
offensive rebounds allowed, the spotty defense. What was new was the
loss, the inability to do something remarkable at the end, the Robert
Horry three-pointer, the Bryant jumper, the O'Neal alley-oop.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything's all right, everything's cool," O'Neal said on a slow
walk to his car.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the Spurs did just enough right and held just enough of a
lead that reached 21 points late in the first half after a staggering
41-14 run. Antonio Daniels came off the bench and scored 14 points in
20 minutes. Bruce Bowen made three of four three-pointers. Malik Rose
and Duncan combined for 10 fourth-quarter rebounds, six on the
offensive side.</TE>
<TE>   So, when the Lakers outscored the Spurs, 45-32, in the second
half, it was not quite enough.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a choice now," Bryant said. "We have to improve. We
have to go up to San Antonio now and play well in Game 3. I, for one,
am looking forward to that."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers staggered to halftime down by 16 points and, more
critically, with O'Neal lugging the four personal fouls.</TE>
<TE>   He was assessed two fouls in a 10.5-second span with less than a
minute remaining in the second quarter, the second on the offensive
end, where he ducked his shoulder and rammed hard into Duncan's
chest.</TE>
<TE>   That he was in the game in such a precarious state was Jackson's
decision. Apparently, Jackson trusted that O'Neal would avoid that
obvious contact. Only Monday he had warned of O'Neal's vulnerability
there, however, saying, "Shaq usually saves his fouls for the
offensive end. That's where he's got to be careful."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Lakers started the third quarter on a 15-3 run, to come
within 59-55, and the crowd believed it, and the Spurs looked as if
they might too.</TE>

<HD>Harris Bails Out Nets</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Reserve guard scores 24 points to lift New
Jersey over Charlotte, 102-88, as Kidd struggles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>The vocal adulation for Jason Kidd was timid in comparison to the
chants for New Jersey's masked man.</LD>
<LD>   Lucious Harris shot 10 for 11 from the field and scored 24 points
Tuesday night, and the New Jersey Nets overcame a subpar performance
from Kidd to defeat the Charlotte Hornets, 102-88, for a 2-0 lead in
the best-of-seven series.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the best game I've ever had," said Harris, a nine-year
veteran appearing in only his fifth playoff game.</LD>
<TE>   Harris scored six consecutive points after the Hornets pulled
within three points with five minutes left, leading to a chant of
"Lu-cious Har-ris" that was many times louder than the defiant
"M-V-P" chants Kidd heard before player introductions.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey pulled away from there, closing with a 16-5 run.</TE>
<TE>   "For so many years they were booing around here. To have them
chanting your name is a big turnaround," said Harris, who has been
playing with a see-through mask for five weeks after fracturing a
facial bone.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets, who have said all season that no one gives them the
proper respect, were feeling even more snubbed before the game after
Kidd apparently failed to win the most-valuable-player award and
Byron Scott lost out to Rick Carlisle for coach of the year. San
Antonio's Tim Duncan is rumored to have been selected MVP, although
an official announcement won't be made until Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   They didn't get much respect from the referees who put their big
men in foul trouble early, but they probably earned it from the
Hornets by playing a scrappier game.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets had 14 offensive rebounds and 20 second-chance points in
the first half; none of either in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Van Horn had 20 points and 11 rebounds. Harris reached 20
points for the fourth time this season and for the first time in 41
games.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd, who made only five of 18 shots, missed nine in a row at one
point and finished with 11 points, six assists and three rebounds,
but his teammates picked up the slack.</TE>
<TE>   "That shows what we've become. Everybody on every given night can
be chanted," Kidd said.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte's Baron Davis had 21 points, seven assists and five
rebounds, but went scoreless for more than 15 minutes in the second
half before making a meaningless free throw with 35 seconds left. It
was the only free throw he made in six tries.</TE>
<TE>   David Wesley scored 17 points and Elden Campbell had 15 for the
Hornets, who trailed, 2-0, in the second round last year before
rallying to win their next three games against the Milwaukee Bucks.</TE>
<TE>   "The 17 layups we gave up--that concerns me more than the
atmosphere we'll have at home [Thursday]," Charlotte Coach Paul Silas
said, referring to the Hornets' first home game since an NBA
committee unanimously approved their proposed move to New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   Harris' short jumper from a corner gave New Jersey a 92-83 lead
and Charlotte never threatened again.</TE>
<TE>   "I just felt good from the first shot," Harris said. "It was a
tough shot and I made it. It's a good feeling when you come off the
bench and get that first shot."</TE>

<HD>Carlisle Is the Coach of Year</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As much as he didn't like it, Rick Carlisle couldn't avoid being in
the spotlight Tuesday, after deflecting credit and attention all
season for turning around the Detroit Pistons.</LD>
<LD>   Carlisle was selected coach of the year in the NBA after leading
Detroit to the Central Division title in his first season as a head
coach at any level.</LD>
<LD>   Carlisle, 42, said he's smart enough to know that he didn't
deserve accolades during the season, when he was once coach of the
month, and that it wasn't warranted Tuesday, despite receiving 73 of
126 votes.</LD>
<TE>   "It really isn't about me," Carlisle said. "It's about the great
effort of my team and the great effort of my staff. This award is
about our franchise having a successful season."</TE>
<TE>   Carlisle led Detroit to 50 victories--18 more than last
season--and its first division title since 1990, the second year of
the franchise's consecutive NBA titles.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Allen Iverson wants to spend the rest of his career with the
Philadelphia 76ers. Coach Larry Brown will have the final say.</TE>
<TE>   Tired of hearing rumors and unwilling to go through a summer of
uncertainty, Iverson met with Brown, hoping to end the trade
speculation.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going nowhere and Larry Brown isn't going nowhere. He
told me that," Iverson said at a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   Over the weekend, Brown made it clear Iverson could be traded if
he doesn't change.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson missed several practices this season, sometimes using what
the team considered lame excuses. More than once, he didn't show
because he said his son, Deuce, was sick.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not talking about the game, the actual game when it
matters," Iverson said. "How can I make my teammates better by
practicing? They are supposed to be used to playing with me anyway."</TE>

<KH>Ross Newhan ON BASEBALL</KH>
<HD>Sheffield Not Hard Sell for Braves</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>It is several hours before his reunion with the Dodgers, and Gary
Sheffield insists he has put those three tumultuous seasons in Los
Angeles behind him. He is sitting by his locker in the Atlanta Brave
clubhouse and ticks off the reasons why he can't stop smiling.
Principal among them are that the environment here is everything he
thought it would be and more, that his wife is expecting their first
child in September and, in the last few days alone, he has sold
houses in Tampa and Bel-Air, houses he didn't need any more.</LD>
<LD>   If the real-estate market has picked up for Sheffield, the
question that haunts the Dodgers is this: To what extent did his
departure from the middle of a lineup that has produced fewer home
runs than any National League team except the Pittsburgh Pirates
foreclose on the Los Angeles offense? If the Dodgers clearly seem to
miss the power that produced an average of 37 homers and 103 runs
batted during those three years, do they miss the pollution that
often accompanied it?</LD>
<LD>   Sheffield was traded for Brian Jordan and Odalis Perez on Jan. 15.
The impact can't be analyzed in early May, and it can't be analyzed
by numbers alone.</LD>
<TE>   How does chemistry fit into a fragile balance of power?</TE>
<TE>   Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca wrestled with that and said, "Look,
Sheff is a feared hitter whose presence in a lineup can't be
replaced, but Jordan is a good hitter himself and he brings a lot of
good intangibles. He wants to win, which is not to say Sheff didn't,
but there were things he said that he shouldn't have. When Brian
Jordan says things, it's about the team, not himself."</TE>
<TE>   The message in that is obvious, but on a night when Sheffield
claimed he has turned a corner to the extent that he even prays for
the Dodgers' success, there was little inflammatory. Of course, aside
from Perez--who faces his former team with a 3-1 record and 1.75
earned-run average tonight--neither the struggling Jordan nor
similarly struggling Sheffield seemed in position to do much sniping
before exchanging big-time shots in a 16-inning, 6-5 Dodger victory.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, admittedly unable to get comfortable in Los Angeles and
missing his Atlanta-based family, returned to Turner Field with a
.248 average, three home runs and 13 RBls. However, he emerged from a
one-for-20 home stand with four hits, including two home runs, a
statement to the Braves, who he felt had betrayed him with the trade.</TE>
<TE>   Sheffield, who might have gone on the disabled list if the Braves
hadn't lost B.J. Surhoff for the season, is still encumbered by a
sore left wrist he jammed in early April and came in hitting .230
with three homers and 10 RBIs. His first home run in 81 at-bats came
off Eric Gagne in the ninth and created extra innings.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if the Dodgers underestimated his offensive impact given
their loss of early power, Sheffield smiled and said, "[General
Manager] Dan Evans clearly knew what I'm capable of doing. It's just
a trade that had to be made. They weren't willing to fill my
[contract] needs and I wasn't willing to be there under those
circumstances. I wanted to move, and as fast as I could. It had
nothing to do with underestimating ability."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, scouts maintain that Sheffield's absence has
significantly changed the sequences that opposing pitchers use
against the middle of the Dodger lineup and significantly affected
the type pitches that Shawn Green sees. Green hit a career-high 49
homers batting ahead of the annoyed Sheffield last year and now has
three.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at my numbers," Sheffield said, "Of course I had an impact.
What kind of impact I had on other players, who knows? Greenie's got
to hit for Greenie. It ain't nothing he ain't seen before. It's just
a matter if you hit it or not. It doesn't matter who is standing on
deck, or anything like that."</TE>
<TE>   Well, of course it does, and Sheffield admitted there's a respect
factor involved and the great thing about the Braves is that there's
an acceptance and understanding "whether you're going good or bad."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he said, the players are not forced to follow
time-consuming rules such as pregame stretching as a team ("they give
you credit for knowing what to do to get ready") and that he's never
spent as much time with teammates or been more excited about his
environment since he left the Florida Marlins, which characterizes
what he thought about those three years in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, he added, the Dodgers "have to live with what
they got," which to this early juncture has been very good pitching
and defense and a sporadic offense averaging only 3.7 runs per game.
A little more, Manager Jim Tracy was saying, and his team might have
come to Atlanta with 21 or 22 wins rather than 18, but he remains
confident the middle of the lineup "will hit and hit a lot" and he
disagrees with the theory Sheffield's absence has been critical
"because I don't see any difference in the pitches being thrown and
don't see them picking on one guy and pitching around him."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe not, but Green, Jordan and Lo Duca combined for 99 home runs
last year and they now have 10. Sheffield alone hit seven last April
on his way to 36, 24 of which either tied the score or put the
Dodgers ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have enough offense here," Lo Duca said, "but we have
to step it up, feed off each other a little better. Greenie and I
have talked about it, and we can't just try to do it as individuals.
I think the three of us [including Jordan] have put too much pressure
on ourselves, which may not be surprising."</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca referred to the fact that he is trying to legitimize his
breakthrough season of last year, that Green now carries the weight
of his club record for home runs and that Jordan is trying to justify
a trade of which the early conclusion is this:</TE>
<TE>   If it's a lot quieter in the Dodger clubhouse, the lineup has been
a lot quieter as well.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Donald Audette struggled for three periods to get a shot on goal and
failed. It finally came less than three minutes into overtime and
rocked Montreal's Molson Centre.</LD>
<LD>   Audette scored a team-leading fifth goal of the playoffs 2:26 into
overtime Tuesday night, giving the Canadiens a 2-1 victory over the
Carolina Hurricanes.</LD>
<LD>   The winning goal came off a faceoff in the Carolina zone, and
Hurricane ace Rod Brind'Amour was victimized on the draw. Yanic
Perreault somehow got the puck to Audette, who beat goalie Kevin
Weekes with a quick shot from the low slot.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think he was ready for that one," Audette said of Weekes,
who finished with 18 saves. "I had a step on the defenseman and just
took one step and it was enough. The puck stayed up in the air and I
stepped into it. I think I beat him with the quickness of the shot."</TE>
<TE>   Brind'Amour, who won 16 of 22 faceoffs, was as stunned as anybody.</TE>
<TE>   "It happens," he said. "It went right up in the air behind me, and
for a second everyone froze. It landed nice for him, and he got a
good shot off. Those little things are frustrating. You do that 1,000
times and it wouldn't happen like that."</TE>
<TE>   The Canadiens got another strong performance from Jose Theodore,
who made 33 saves, and gained a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven series,
which resumes Thursday at Montreal. It was Carolina's first overtime
loss after two victories over New Jersey in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   "You gear yourself up for a seven-game series, and we expect it to
be a hard-fought battle," Carolina captain Ron Francis said. "We
still feel capable of winning. We had a lot of chances. We just have
to find a way to bury one."</TE>
<TE>   Saku Koivu, who leads Montreal in scoring with 10 points, got his
fourth goal of the playoffs at 9:03 of the second period to break a
scoreless duel between Theodore and Weekes.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 6, Detroit 1--After stuffing the St. Louis Blues for two
games, Dominik Hasek looked like an ordinary goaltender.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Tkachuk had his first playoff hat trick and the Blues put a
huge dent in Hasek's aura of invincibility, beating the Red Wings at
St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   "They were scoring goals, that was the difference," Hasek said. "A
lot of their shots went in. What can I say?"</TE>
<TE>   The Blues cut their second-round series deficit to 2-1. They got
27 saves from Brent Johnson and will try to even the series Thursday
night at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, we just were getting too many quality scoring chances to not
cash in at some point," Scott Mellanby said. "But Thursday's going to
be that much harder.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got a lot of great players and Hasek's going to bounce
back."</TE>
<TE>   Red Wing Coach Scotty Bowman could remember only one worse playoff
result in his career, an 8-0 loss against an opponent he couldn't
remember.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a poor publicity score for sure," Bowman said. "It's a bad
score. We're not happy about it."</TE>
<TE>   Tkachuk, who led the Blues with 38 goals in the regular season,
has four goals in the playoffs. He scored once in each period,
putting deflections past Hasek in the first and second periods, then
converting Pavol Demitra's setup on a 3-on-2 break in the third.</TE>
<TE>   The power play came to life for the Blues, who ended an 0-for-10
drought with two goals.</TE>

<HD>Giants' Ortiz Feels Just Fine at New York</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although other visitors often complain about the blaring music, loud
fans and low-flying jets, Russ Ortiz really likes playing at Shea
Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday night, he had even more fun.</LD>
<LD>   Ortiz pitched a shutout into the seventh inning and hit a two-run
double that sent the San Francisco Giants past the New York Mets,
5-1, in a matchup of division leaders.</LD>
<TE>   "The first time I came here, I loved it," Ortiz said. "Every time
I've come back, I've enjoyed it. It's one of the places where I can
say I feel pretty comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz earned his first major league victory at Shea in 1998, and
is 6-1 lifetime against the Mets.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants have won only five times in their last 17 games at New
York, and Ortiz has three of the victories.</TE>
<TE>   "The fans really get into it. It's not in-your-face stuff or
anything. I try to feed off that," he said. "It's one of those
electric ballparks."</TE>
<TE>   David Bell drove in two runs, and Tim Worrell provided timely
relief to help the Giants win for the seventh time in eight games.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds, who has seldom hit well at Shea, went 0 for 3 after
hitting home runs against Cincinnati in each of his previous two
games. He drew two more walks to boost his major league-leading total
to 42.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 8, St. Louis 0--Kerry Wood struck out nine in his first
complete game in a year, and Alex Gonzalez drove in four runs at
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   The Cubs have won three in a row for the first time this season.</TE>
<TE>   Wood (4-2) gave up four hits for his first shutout since May 25,
2001.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 7, Pittsburgh 6--Danny Bautista tied a career high with
four hits, breaking a 6-6 tie with a run-scoring single against Joe
Beimel (0-1) in the eighth at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Colbrunn had three hits, including a home run, for Arizona.
Pittsburgh had tied the score in the eighth when Jason Kendall hit
his first home run this season, a two-run drive against Mike Morgan,
who also gave up a run on a wild pitch.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 5, Montreal 3--Todd Hollandsworth hit a two-run homer in
the second inning and Colorado scored the go-ahead runs on center
fielder Endy Chavez's three-base error in the fifth inning at
Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   John Thomson (5-2) won his third consecutive start and the Rockies
got their first road victory since April 19, a streak of eight games.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 12, San Diego 4--Ryan Dempster (1-3), winless in 11 starts
since Sept. 2, was staked to a 10-0 lead at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Dempster gave up three runs and six hits in 61/3 innings and hit a
run-scoring single in a five-run first inning against Bobby Jones
(3-2).</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 7, Houston 4--Tomas Perez scored the go-ahead run on
a wild pitch by Hipolito Pichardo (0-1) in the bottom of the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   The Phillies, who lost a club-record 18 games in April, have won
four in a row and their much-maligned relievers haven't given up a
run in 162/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 8, Milwaukee 2--Sean Casey hit his first homer since
August and Adam Dunn extended his surge with a three-run home run at
Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Elmer Dessens (2-3) gave up two runs and five hits in seven
innings for the NL Central leaders. He had two singles and drove in
two runs.</TE>

<LD>For a few precious moments late Tuesday, the ear-ringing noise that
filled Staples Center appeared to be cheering.</LD>
<LD>   Turns out, it was the sound of collapsing.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers' aura of playoff invincibility is gone.</LD>
<TE>   After two weeks of incessant chipping, it was knocked to pieces by
a basketball team disguised as a sledge hammer.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't Sacramento or Dallas, but Tim Duncan and a bunch of guys
we couldn't spot on the street.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't in the NBA Finals, but in a Western Conference semifinal
series that was supposed to be just one more easy step.</TE>
<TE>   While the Laker magic made it close, some of that recent Laker
lack of focus made it feel like a blowout.</TE>
<TE>   It was San Antonio 88, Lakers 85, the series tied at one game
apiece, and, no, we never thought we'd have to write that sentence.</TE>
<TE>   But then, after watching the Lakers win 20 of their last 21
playoff games and 18 consecutive games at home, there was much about
Tuesday that didn't seem familiar.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers can be beaten this time of year?</TE>
<TE>   Their veteran coach can make a mistake that led to that defeat?</TE>
<TE>   Their veteran players can be fooled on a decoy play that was
embarrassing in defeat?</TE>
<TE>   And, with the game on the line, Kobe Bryant goes up for a
final-seconds shot ... that becomes a pass ... that he catches
himself?</TE>
<TE>   "We almost got away with it again, we almost got away with it,"
Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   But they didn't, because this is how it ended, the Lakers trailing
by two points and the crowd roaring and Bryant driving into four
Spurs and losing the ball and touching it again and being called for
traveling with 1.3 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost control of the ball, I tried to kick it back to [Derek]
Fisher, an obvious violation," Bryant said. "I just lost control."</TE>
<TE>   Isn't that how tough losses ended in the old days? Bryant doesn't
do that stuff anymore, does he?</TE>
<TE>   With a knee that seemed fine, Bryant was spectacular for most of
the game--this loss wasn't about him.</TE>
<TE>   It was about the Lakers being outscored, 41-14, during one stretch
of the first half. That's focus.</TE>
<TE>   It was about the Spurs getting seven offensive rebounds in the
fourth quarter while the Lakers had zero. That's hustle.</TE>
<TE>   It was about a continuation of the problems that plagued this team
during its first championship run two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a choice now," Bryant said. "We have to improve."</TE>
<TE>   As much as anything, though, it was a loss symbolized by three
plays during a second quarter in which they were outscored, 32-19.</TE>
<TE>   With 5:30 left in the quarter, when Robert Horry drove the lane,
only to have his shot blocked out of bounds by ... nobody. He simply
twirled and threw it away as if expecting the ball to get swatted.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the game, the supporting players seemed lost or out of
sync.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to stop, take a calculated look at what we're doing, and
go forward from there," said Laker Coach Phil Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   A lower point occurred with 3:10 left in the quarter, when players
and coaches from the Spurs' bench stood up, and four of the Spurs
walked toward the sidelines, and everyone on both teams assumed they
were calling timeout.</TE>
<TE>   But they weren't calling timeout. They were calling the biggest
decoy play since Dan Marino faked that spike against the New York
Jets.</TE>
<TE>   With everyone but one person just standing around, that one
person--Antonio Daniels--drove the lane and scored on a layup and was
fouled by a stunned Samaki Walker, who was also standing around.</TE>
<TE>   "The false timeout made us dispirited, made us look like a bunch
of rookies out there," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the nadir, when Jackson suffered a five-star brain cramp
with 47 seconds remaining in the half.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal was assessed his third foul, and yet was allowed to remain
in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone in the house knew that one of the Spurs would flop and
cause O'Neal's fourth foul.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven seconds later, Duncan flopped and O'Neal had a fourth foul
that affected his play for the rest of the game.</TE>
<TE>   The officials struggled on that call, and throughout the game,
amazingly awarding the Lakers only two free throws in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   But the Lakers can't blame them. They can only blame a creeping
playoff malaise that seems to have crept back into their locker room
after a year off.</TE>
<TE>   It is a problem they fixed just in time two years ago, and promise
to fix again.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a saying that the playoffs don't start until you lose the
first game at home," Bryant said. "This is where it gets fun."</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, a real blast.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dwight Dumais of Ventura Buena High has been following in his
brothers' footsteps since he was old enough to walk. But even they
never won Southern Section Division I diving titles as freshmen.</LD>
<LD>   Dumais scored 591.75 points and defeated defending champion
Michael Hilde of Laguna Hills (547.80) and Ryan Rincon of Huntington
Beach Marina (540.05) in an 11-dive final at Marguerite Recreation
Center. Justin Dumais won section titles in 1995-96, Troy won in
1997-98 and Brice in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Dana Hills junior Joey Brown won the girls' title with 520.60
points, edging Leanne Dumais of Buena, who scored 516.10.</LD>
<TE>   In baseball:</TE>
<TE>   Valencia 18, Canyon Country Canyon 5--John Porter had three hits,
including a two-run home run, and drove in five runs, and Jared Clark
added three hits and a three-run homer to help No. 18 Valencia (21-4,
11-3) clinch a share of its first Foothill League championship.</TE>
<TE>   The teams meet again Friday at Canyon (19-5, 10-4).</TE>
<TE>   Woodbridge 3, Newport Harbor 0--Mike Peck (8-1) pitched a perfect
game, striking out 15, to lead Woodbridge (12-3, 17-7) to a Sea View
League victory over visiting Newport Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   Peck struck out the first six batters and had another streak of
seven strikeouts from the end of the fourth inning through the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   In boys' tennis:</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Coast League finals--Aaron Yovan of Irvine University
defeated Irvine Northwood's Andrew Cho, 6-4, 6-2, to win his second
consecutive boys' singles final at Palisades Tennis Club in Newport
Beach. The title came in the absence of top-seeded Cameron Ball, who
did not play because of an inner-ear infection.</TE>

<DH>Swimming: Sacred Heart's Siracuse hopes her ailing father
can attend her final high school meet Saturday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN ARRITT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No matter how noisy the fans, Melissa Siracuse has always
distinguished her father's voice during swim meets. She easily found
his large hands stretching through the crowd, ready to congratulate
her after each performance.</LD>
<LD>   Until last summer, Siracuse was certain her father, Phil, would be
the first to greet her after the Southern Section Division II
swimming championships Saturday at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach,
hopefully to celebrate a victory in the 100-yard breaststroke.</LD>
<LD>   But Siracuse hasn't taken her father's presence for granted in the
last 10 months, not since cancer appeared in his right leg last
summer, was later found to have originated in his left kidney and
reappeared in his left arm last month.</LD>
<TE>   "We all had our breakdowns last [month]," said Melissa, a senior
at Flintridge Sacred Heart. "We thought [the cancer] was behind him."</TE>
<TE>   Despite feeling weak, having a limp from surgery last summer to
remove the femur bone from his right thigh and having his arm in a
sling from an operation to remove part of the major bone in his upper
left arm two weeks ago, Phil plans to watch his daughter swim her
final high school meet Saturday. Siracuse remains less optimistic
that her father will be strong enough to attend, knowing the final
decision will come from her mother, Emily.</TE>
<TE>   "She'll decide if he can go or not," Melissa said.</TE>
<TE>   The section finals this week will serve as a respite for the
Siracuse family. It's a meet Siracuse has been gearing for since
finishing second in the 100 breaststroke at the Division II finals
last season. Siracuse has a clear picture of how she hopes the race
will unfold.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be the ultimate swim," said Siracuse, who will
compete for USC next year. She is hoping to touch the wall first,
produce an All-American time for the second consecutive season and
then embrace her father, who has been deeply involved in her swimming
since she was 5.</TE>
<TE>   "He had never missed a meet in 11 years, until last summer,"
Siracuse said.</TE>
<TE>   Phil, 61, has been a major facilitator of fund-raising efforts and
other administrative duties related to his daughter's youth, club and
high school swim teams. As a commercial litigation lawyer, those
things came naturally to him.</TE>
<TE>   Siracuse, 17, was creating her own waves in the water, competing
for the Crescenta-Canada YMCA for five years before joining Swim
Pasadena two years ago. She went undefeated in the breaststroke for
four years in the Mission League, earning All-American status last
season after swimming the Division II finals in 1 minute 5.29
seconds, which remains her career best.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, cancer was discovered in Phil's leg and traced to his
kidney. While awaiting the first of several surgeries to remove his
kidney and insert a titanium rod into his leg, Phil missed part of
the Junior Olympics in Santa Maria, the first time he ever missed his
daughter compete. Siracuse said her parents kept the seriousness of
her father's condition from her until he appeared out of danger.</TE>
<TE>   While recovering, Phil attended as many meets as his health would
allow, even sitting alongside the pool in a wheelchair. His strength
returned to normal over the winter, but last month, he broke his arm
while hoisting part of the engine from his car.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt tremendous pain in my arm and I knew it wasn't a good
sign," Phil said. "It's fortunate they found [the cancer], but it's
unfortunate my arm had to break."</TE>
<TE>   The news came as a major setback for the family.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything was going pretty well," Siracuse said. "Once [the
broken arm] happened, we knew something was wrong because it
shouldn't have broke like that."</TE>
<TE>   The Siracuse family, which includes three other children between
the ages of 29 and 32, was called to the family home and the cause of
the injury was confirmed. The news was so painful an uncle had to
mouth the words.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a gut feeling something was wrong," Siracuse said.</TE>
<TE>   The day Phil was released from the hospital, Siracuse had a swim
meet against Sherman Oaks Notre Dame but hoped to leave early to
welcome her father home. As she prepared to leave before the final
relay, she noticed the score was still too close to call, so she
decided to stay and led Sacred Heart to a narrow victory.</TE>
<TE>   "She went in there and did what she had to do," Coach Bruno Tapia
said.</TE>
<TE>   Siracuse was the only Sacred Heart swimmer to qualify for the
section preliminaries Thursday at Belmont Plaza. She shouldn't have a
problem qualifying for the final.</TE>
<TE>   Siracuse is seeded third in the breaststroke, behind freshman
Maryann Boosalis of La Canada and sophomore Parisa Dana of Temple
City. Siracuse believes neither have matched her rest in preparation
for Saturday. In addition to winning the section title, Siracuse
hopes to break the All-American standard of 1:04.77.</TE>
<TE>   She also hopes to get something more on Saturday. That familiar
hand reaching out from the crowd.</TE>

<HD>Racing Loses Its Crown Jewel</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Seattle Slew, the last surviving Triple Crown
champion, dies at 28. It was 25 years to day of Kentucky Derby win.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seattle Slew, a crooked-legged colt who was rejected by one sales
company as a yearling before being sold cheaply by another, died
Tuesday at a Kentucky farm, 25 years to the day of his Kentucky Derby
victory and in the silver-anniversary year of his Triple Crown sweep.</LD>
<LD>   Seattle Slew, who was 28, was the last surviving Triple Crown
champion and leaves racing for the first time without a living Triple
Crown winner. Sweeping the Derby, the Preakness and the Belmont
Stakes in 1977, Seattle Slew was the 10th Triple Crown champion and
the first and only horse to emerge from the series with an undefeated
overall record. Affirmed, who in 1978 became the 11th and last horse
to win all three races, died last year.</LD>
<LD>   Overcome by arthritis and neurological problems, Seattle Slew had
undergone two operations since 2000, the most recent on his neck in
March. He had been removed from stud duty in February and transferred
from Three Chimneys Farm near Midway, Ky., to the quieter Hill 'n'
Dale Farm near Lexington, Ky., where he died in his sleep at 9 a.m.</LD>
<TE>   With the colt were Mickey and Karen Taylor, who bought him at
auction for a paltry $17,500, raced him in a partnership and managed
his breeding career; two grooms, one of them Tom Wade, who had moved
from farm to farm caring for the horse for the last 20 years, and
John Sikura, owner of Hill 'n' Dale. Seattle Slew will be buried at
the farm.</TE>
<TE>   "He died peacefully--he had just had enough," Sikura said. "He
tried as hard as he could, but he just could not overcome. Everybody
got to say their last goodbyes. It was about as noble and sad an
experience as you could imagine."</TE>
<TE>   Almost to the end, at an age when many stallions would have been
turned out to pasture, Seattle Slew was being mated with mares who
will produce foals who will further enhance his world-wide reputation
as a sire. Of his more than 900 foals, 102 have been stakes winners,
and his entire get has earned more than $75 million. His progeny
include A.P. Indy, the 1992 horse of the year; Swale, the 1984
Kentucky Derby winner; and the undefeated filly Landaluce. Seattle
Slew's stud fee, a record $800,000 in 1985, was $300,000 at the time
of his death.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the most complete thoroughbred the industry has ever
seen," Mickey Taylor said. "He just kept raising the bar with every
record he broke."</TE>
<TE>   On the track, Seattle Slew lost three races in the year and a half
he raced after the Triple Crown. He finished with 14 wins and two
seconds in 17 starts and earned $1.2 million. He won Eclipse Awards
all three years he raced, among them horse-of-the-year honors in
1977.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Slew suffered his first loss, after nine straight
victories, when he ran fourth in the Swaps Stakes at Hollywood Park
in July 1977. The race, won by J.O. Tobin, was run less than a month
after the colt had marched through the demanding, five-week Triple
Crown. Before the race, there was disagreement in Seattle Slew's camp
about whether too much racing was being loaded onto the broad
shoulders of the near-black colt.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Slew took off the rest of 1977, underwent a training
change from Billy Turner to Doug Peterson at the end of the year, and
while in Florida nearly died in January 1978 from a blood disease.
Recovering, he returned to the win column in May and finished the
year with three wins in his last four starts, two of them major
victories in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The adage that nothing sours relationships faster than a good
horse came true for the "Slew Crew," a diverse collection of people
brought together by a spectacular horse:</TE>
<TE>   * The Taylors were high-school sweethearts, Karen a former airline
hostess and Mickey a fourth-generation logger from Washington state
who was relatively new to the horse business.</TE>
<TE>   * Jim Hill, a New York veterinarian and an experienced horseman
whose partnership in Seattle Slew included his wife Sally, was the
son of a cattle rancher.</TE>
<TE>   * Turner, who trained Seattle Slew for his first 10 races, was a
hard-drinking, wisecracking former steeplechase jockey who spent many
of his idle hours at Esposito's, a popular bar for racetrackers
across the street from Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   * Jean Cruguet, who rode Seattle Slew to his Triple Crown
victories, was a transplanted Frenchman whose career had all but
stalled in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The photogenic Karen Taylor and Sally Hill dressed in matching
gold-and-black ensembles--the same colors that Cruguet wore atop
Seattle Slew--and became as well known as their horse. But before the
ride was over, Turner had been fired, Cruguet was replaced by Angel
Cordero as Seattle Slew's jockey, Turner sued the owners over a
breeding right and the Hills won a $4.4-million judgment against the
Taylors after charges of stable mismanagement. When Three Chimneys
Farm threw a 20th-anniversary Triple Crown party in Kentucky for a
still-robust Seattle Slew in 1997, only the Taylors of the original
Slew Crew were there.</TE>
<TE>   None of the infighting, however, could detract from Seattle Slew's
brilliance.</TE>
<TE>   Mickey Taylor and Jim Hill were new acquaintances in 1975 when
they bought the colt, a son of first-year sire Bold Reasoning and My
Charmer, a Poker mare. The bloodlines of both parents are dotted with
important horses, and they both go back to Nasrullah, an English
stallion who became one of the outstanding sires in this country.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Keeneland Select Sale, a July auction for the country's
most sought-after yearlings, would not accept Seattle Slew. The colt
was by an unproven sire, had clumsy ways and his right foot angled
out, giving that leg a turned-out look from the knee down. Slew's
owners always insisted that his name wasn't derived from the horse's
being slew-footed; he reportedly was named after the city near the
Taylors' home, and from the marshy sloughs of Florida, where Jim Hill
grew up.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Slew's breeder, Ben Castleman of Covington, Ky., finally
was able to consign the then-unnamed colt to the Fasig-Tipton sale in
Lexington. If the bidding on the horse had not reached $15,000,
Castleman was prepared to buy him back. Jim Hill, before flying to
New York for a horse surgery, had raved to the Taylors about the
colt.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a runner, or my name isn't Jim Hill," he said. "He might not
be a champion, but he'll certainly be a runner. I like everything
about him. The muscle, the angles of the shoulders, and his hips and
pastern are all perfect. He has the balance of an athlete."</TE>
<TE>   With his wife ramming her elbow into his ribs to make sure he
continued bidding, Mickey Taylor zeroed in on Hip No. 128, as the
colt was identified at the sale. The bidding started at $3,000 and
went up in small increments. Eighteen bids and 90 seconds later, the
horse belonged to the Taylors and their partners. Informed of the
purchase, Jim Hill turned to his wife and said, "I think we bought a
champion."</TE>
<TE>   David Hofmans in California might have become Seattle Slew's
trainer, but he received five other young horses from the Taylors,
and the other new purchases, including Slew, were sent to Turner in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Slew didn't start until late September of 1976, but he won
all three of his 2-year-old races, including a 93/4-length victory in
the Champagne Stakes. Early the next year, he won two races in
Florida, then scored again in the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct to take
him into the Kentucky Derby.</TE>
<TE>   On May 7, 1977, he might have been the 1-2 favorite at Churchill
Downs, but before the race Seattle Slew was a mess. He broke out in a
sweat on the long trip from the barn to the paddock, and was no
better by the time the 15-horse field reached the track.</TE>
<TE>   What is more, Seattle Slew broke slowly, almost unseating Cruguet.
Compensating, Cruguet's colt quickly bulled his way into contention,
lurked behind the leader, For The Moment, until the quarter pole,
then pulled away and won by 13/4 lengths.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, at Pimlico, Seattle Slew won a less-adventurous
Preakness by 11/2 lengths. The Belmont Stakes was three weeks away,
but already John Esposito, Billy Turner's favorite barkeep, was
saying, "Slew will leave 'em like a freight train leaving hobos."</TE>
<TE>   Not even a muddy track could prove Esposito wrong. Seattle Slew
won the Belmont by four lengths and Cruguet, starting what's become a
custom, waved his whip at the crowd just past the finish line and
almost fell off.</TE>
<TE>   Eight years before, Majestic Prince had won the Derby and
Preakness, but that colt had cost his owner $250,000. Seattle Slew
had cost less than a tenth of that, and his price was about $36,000
less than the cost of the average horse at the Keeneland sale that
had turned him down.</TE>
<TE>   "Seattle Slew was one in a million," John Sikura of Hill 'n' Dale
Farm said Tuesday. "He showed us that anything's possible in a game
of impossibilities."</TE>

<HD>Peterson Has Slew of Memories</HD>
<DH>Trainer: At 26, he was put in charge of superstar horse
late in 1977 and had the experience of a lifetime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A horse trainer for most of his life, Doug Peterson, 50, remembers
one year, nearly a quarter of a century ago, better than any other.</LD>
<LD>   The star of the Peterson stable that year, 1978, was Seattle Slew,
who died Tuesday morning at a farm near Lexington, Ky.</LD>
<LD>   Then 26, Peterson had been hired late in 1977 by owners Karen and
Mickey Taylor and veterinarian Jim Hill as the private trainer for
Tayhill Stable, replacing Billy Turner.</LD>
<TE>   Peterson recalled being put in charge of more than 30 horses, but
the only one who really mattered to the rest of the world was Seattle
Slew. The dark bay son of Bold Reasoning had won each of his three
starts as a 2-year-old, then become the second Triple Crown winner in
four years.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson said he felt no pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd come to New York from Arkansas with a small string of
horses," he remembered. "I got to know Dr. Hill and he came to
respect me and my horsemanship. When they decided to make a change,
Dr. Hill and the Taylors gave me a week to make up my mind if I
wanted to be a private trainer for them.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew right away that was what I wanted to do, but I waited the
week and I told them I would take the job. A lot of people, including
[late Hall of Fame trainers] Laz Barrera and Woody Stephens wondered
if I knew what kind of pressure cooker I was putting myself into, but
I was 26, dumb and couldn't have cared less."</TE>
<TE>   Given several months off after suffering his first defeat in
Hollywood Park's Swaps Stakes in July 1977, Seattle Slew went to
Florida that winter.</TE>
<TE>   Stabled at Hialeah, Seattle Slew and another horse stabled nearby
took ill, stricken with a severe form of colic called colitis X.</TE>
<TE>   "He almost died," said Peterson, who spent countless hours trying
to nurse the superstar back to health. "A lot of times, horses don't
make it when they get as sick as he was, and in fact, the other horse
who had it at the same time did die."</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Slew recovered and won five of seven in 1978, earning the
Eclipse Award as the champion older male.</TE>
<TE>   "I never saw a horse who wouldn't take a day off after a race,"
said Peterson, currently a trainer on the Southern California
circuit. "Usually, after a horse runs, they'll walk for a few days
afterwards, but if you tried to walk him the day after, he would kick
the barn down. Once you would put a saddle on him, he would quiet
down."</TE>
<TE>   In his final year of racing Seattle Slew won the Marlboro Cup and
Woodward Stakes at Belmont Park, but it was another race there that
Peterson recalls best.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the most dramatic races in the history of the sport,
Seattle Slew lost by a nose to Exceller over a muddy track in the
Jockey Club Gold Cup. Among those behind them that day was Affirmed,
the 1978 Triple Crown winner who finished fifth.</TE>
<TE>   "Going 11/2 miles, [Seattle Slew] ran six furlongs in 1:094/5,"
Peterson said. "Angel Cordero Jr. rode him that day and had him way
out in the middle of the track. He never saw or heard Exceller coming
down along the inside. He was surprised, but he came back on and just
missed. Angel apologized to me after the race and said he blew it.
Seattle Slew laid it all out there that day.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole experience with him is something that I can't put into
words. He was an incredible individual."</TE>

<LD>Nigeria's minister for sport--and a man closely involved in his
country's World Cup plans--was among the 149 killed when a domestic
airliner crashed in Nigeria over the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Amid national mourning for the loss of Ishaya Mark Aku and fellow
passengers, Nigeria on Tuesday canceled a Korea/Japan '02 warmup game
against China that had been scheduled for Saturday in the southern
Chinese city of Kumming. The game would have pitted the "Super
Eagles" against Bora Milutinovic, the coach who led them to the
second round of the France '98 World Cup and who now coaches China.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, Olusegun Obasanjo, Nigeria's president, scrapped a
sendoff reception planned for the team next week.</LD>

<TE>   Tens of thousands of Egyptians turned out in Cairo on Tuesday for
the funeral of one of the country's greatest players, Saleh Selim,
who died of liver cancer Monday at the age of 72.</TE>
<TE>   Nicknamed "Maestro" during a playing career that lasted from 1947
to 1967 and saw him become one of the first Egyptian players to turn
professional, Selim later appeared in three movies and served for 18
years as president of Al Ahly, one of the country's top clubs.</TE>

<TE>   South Africa's World Cup fortunes took a sharp downturn when it
learned that forward and team captain Shaun Bartlett, who has scored
24 goals in 60 games for the "Bafana Bafana," will miss the
tournament because he needs surgery to repair an Achilles' tendon
injury suffered during the African Nations Cup in Mali in February.</TE>

<TE>   Defender Igor Tudor has been lost to Croatia for the World Cup
after being told he has to undergo ankle surgery. The 23-year-old
Juventus player was a towering presence on the back line for Croatia,
which finished third in the France '98 World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "He was and is one of our key players," Coach Mirko Jozic said.
"His absence means we have lost some 20% of our value. If we had some
advantage over two of our World Cup rivals before, now I can no
longer say that."</TE>

Daniel Fonseca, 32, in a squad of 27 players that he will bring to
Washington, D.C., for Sunday's game against the U.S. at RFK Stadium
has drawn the ire of the country's media.</TE>
<TE>   Several newspapers said younger players deserved the chance ahead
of Fonseca, a former Juventus and Napoli forward who played in the
Italia '90 World Cup but has been sidelined by injury for much of the
last three years.</TE>

<TE>   San Antonio Coach Gregg Popovich is hoping it will be Friday for
Game 3 of this second-round playoff series at the Alamodome.</TE>
<TE>   "We stay hopeful he will play in this series," Popovich said.
"That's the only way to be. It doesn't do much good to think any
other way."</TE>
<TE>   Popovich says the key is for Robinson to reach the point where
doctors can say with certainty the 7-foot-1 center can play "without
doing anymore real damage to himself."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although he has proven to be yet another headache in this series
for Popovich, who really didn't need the additional aggravation, the
San Antonio coach is pleased about the success of forward Samaki
Walker in Los Angeles. Walker spent the previous two seasons in San
Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really proud of him, really happy for him," Popovich said.
"He has proven everybody wrong who said he wasn't a hard worker. This
season, he is bearing the fruits of what he has done over the last
few years in terms of gaining respect."</TE>
<TE>   Was Popovich surprised when he heard that the quiet, soft-speaking
Walker had gotten into a fight with teammate Kobe Bryant on the team
bus during the season?</TE>
<TE>   ''This is L.A.," said Popovich with a smile. "I just figured you
[media] guys made it up."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Springer</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Even before their Game 2 victory, Tim Duncan and his teammates
remained confident about their chances.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think they were invincible last year, and they proved it
to me," guard Terry Porter said. "This year, who knows how the story
is going to end?"</TE>

<LD>Tennis player Anna Kournikova filed suit against General Media
Communications Inc., the parent company of Penthouse magazine, on
Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, according to her
representatives. The complaint cites defamation, false light invasion
of privacy, misappropriation of identity and various other violations
of Kournikova's rights, and seeks damages of more than $10 million.</LD>
<LD>   Penthouse last month published a multi-page spread of photos of
the tennis player, including topless pictures purporting to be of
Kournikova. Kournikova's representatives denied that the topless
photos were of her and threatened a suit. On Monday, Judith E.
Soltesz-Benetton, the daughter-in-law of fashion designer Luciano
Benetton, sued Penthouse, saying the topless photos supposedly of
Kournikova were actually pictures taken of her seven years ago,
without her knowledge. U.S. District Judge Denny Chin ordered the
magazine to halt distribution of its June issue.</LD>
<LD>   Penthouse issued a statement Tuesday: "We deeply regret this
unintentional error and offer our heartfelt apologies to both
women.... We were wrong. In over 30 years of publishing this
magazine, we have never made an error of anything approaching this
magnitude."</LD>
<TE>   The Kournikova camp was not mollified.</TE>
<TE>   "The apology is as false as the photos," said David Schwab,
spokesman for Octagon, the management agency representing Kournikova.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Stacey Nuveman has been at UCLA for so long ...</LD>
<LD>   " ... That by the time I'm going to finish my career, I'm going to
have my PhD," she joked. Nuveman recently turned 24 and is in her
sixth year at UCLA. She was a redshirt during the 1998 season and
also received another redshirt year in 2000 to play for the U.S.
Olympic softball team.</LD>
<LD>   She hears the age jokes all the time, even from the 18-year-old
freshmen. To her, 18 seems a lifetime ago.</LD>
<TE>   "Some of the girls that just graduated, they say they're going to
bring their grandkids to watch me play," Nuveman said with a laugh.
"There are times when I feel so old that I'll need to go to bed at
10:30."</TE>
<TE>   Seeing Nuveman at the plate has grown old for a lot of opposing
coaches. College softball's most feared batter set the NCAA all-time
career home run mark on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The momentous blast came in the top of the seventh inning of the
Bruins' 10-1 victory at Oregon State. Nuveman hit the first pitch
from Kristen Hunter over the left-field fence for her 86th career
home run, surpassing Arizona's Leah Braatz and Laura Espinoza.</TE>
<TE>   She added another home run Sunday in UCLA's 8-0 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "To be able to leave your mark in the record books in that
high-profile category is a big deal," Nuveman said. "Home runs are
exciting. They're what everyone wants to see. It means a lot to etch
my name in that respect."</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot Nuveman is finishing her collegiate career in
awe-inspiring fashion. She is batting .555 (76 hits in 137 at-bats)
with 17 home runs and 58 runs batted in. She is having a better
all-around year than she did as a sophomore, when she led the nation
with 31 homers and 91 RBIs, but batted only .446.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona pitcher Jennie Finch, the reigning national player of the
year, considers Nuveman the ultimate challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "Facing Stacey, that's what you work in this game for," Finch
said. "It's why we play. Stacey is one of the best hitters in the
game. It's definitely fun every time I face her."</TE>
<TE>   Calling Nuveman a home-run hitter might elicit a raised eyebrow
from the Bruin star. Perhaps her most impressive statistic is that
she has struck out only seven times. With 54 walks this season and
225 in her career, she gets only a few choice pitches to hit during
each at-bat.</TE>
<TE>   "My challenge this year was to be aggressive but not too
aggressive," she said. "I have to have a certain discipline at the
plate. The key is recognizing when that pitch comes. The sooner you
can decide this is the one to hit, the better chance you have."</TE>
<TE>   More often than not, her decisions have been right on the ball.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nuveman was one of three Bruins named finalists for the inaugural
USA Softball college player of the year award. The 10 finalists were
selected from a group of 25 in April.</TE>
<TE>   Junior shortstop Natasha Watley and sophomore pitcher Keira Goerl
are the other Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   The list will be narrowed to three on May 31 and the winner
announced on June 7.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Fullerton's and Pacific's softball teams head into
weekend of Big West Conference play with 19-2 records atop the
conference.</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton (47-11 overall), ranked ninth in the country, has three
games at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo Friday and Saturday, while No. 17
Pacific (40-14) plays host to Cal State Northridge for three games.</TE>
<TE>   Both will get postseason berths when the NCAA announces its
64-team playoff field Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine's Brad Keenan and Beau Daniels were the only local
players named to the Assn. of Volleyball Coaches All-American first
team. UCLA's Matt Komer, Pepperdine's Sean Rooney and Northridge's
Eckhard Walter were second-team selections.... UC Riverside freshman
golfer Brandon Hillpot qualified to play in the West Regional
tournament, May 16-18 at Albuquerque.</TE>

<HD>County Chips In $670,000 for Affordable Apartments</HD>
<DH>Housing: The 30-unit, $4.8-million complex in Laguna Beach,
three blocks from ocean, will be for low-wage workers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County supervisors Tuesday approved spending more than
$670,000 to help build a 30-unit apartment building in Laguna Beach
that will provide affordable housing for the working poor.</LD>
<LD>   For years, Laguna Beach and other South County cities have been
criticized for not pushing affording housing projects other than
those for the elderly.</LD>
<LD>   According to advocates for the poor, the county is in a housing
crisis, with rents averaging $1,100 to $1,200 a month for a
two-bedroom apartment and a vacancy rate of only 2%.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a great project," said Laguna Beach City Manager Ken
Frank, explaining that high construction prices and high rents in the
city often made such developments impossible.</TE>
<TE>   With the county's portion of the funding in place, the city now
will raze the two-story building at 450 Glenneyre St. and replace it
with the $4.8-million apartment complex.</TE>
<TE>   "Our intent is to try and provide some housing for those people
who work downtown and earn salaries at the lower end of the economic
scale," Frank said. "It's for people who work in the restaurants and
in retail."</TE>
<TE>   The project was initially opposed by seniors who wanted the site
for a new senior center. Complaints subsided after they were offered
another location.</TE>
<TE>   The city bought the property about four years ago, using fees from
developers who chose not to include affordable housing in their
developments.</TE>
<TE>   Several funding sources besides the county's contribution are
being tapped for the project. The contractor, Related Cos. of
California, is applying for $2.9 million in state tax credits. The
city is chipping in $725,000, and the contractor will carry an
additional debt of $482,000.</TE>
<TE>   Construction is expected to begin in early 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 30 apartments, one is for a manager and 29 are for people
who earn 40% of the median income in the county, or about $30,350.</TE>

<HD>Culture Official's Departure Irks Ventura Artists</HD>
<DH>Community: Many believe Consuelo Underwood was forced out
because of the way she distributed grants. She isn't talking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sudden ouster of Ventura's cultural affairs manager drew dozens
of artists to this week's City Council meeting to voice support for a
woman they called the "ears and voice" of the art community.</LD>
<LD>   The council sat silently Monday as 13 artists took turns
speaking--some accusing the city of forcing Consuelo Underwood out,
others asking for answers or offering advice for finding her
replacement. Some speakers said Underwood's departure was an
indication the city doesn't support the arts.</LD>
<LD>   City officials have said the resignation is a personnel matter
that they cannot discuss publicly, and Underwood declined to explain
her reasons for leaving.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Mayor Ray DiGuilio said the arts remain a priority for
the city.</TE>
<TE>   "This in no way sends a message to that part of the art community
[who spoke at Monday's meeting]," DiGuilio said. "We have not gone
back on our commitment to work with them in a meaningful way."</TE>
<TE>   Underwood had worked in San Jose and Phoenix before being hired by
the city last July following a national search. Her last day was
April 26.</TE>
<TE>   Many artists have said they believe that Underwood was forced out
after upsetting more-established members of the art community in
Ventura by the way she handled the city's disbursement of grants.</TE>
<TE>   "She stepped on some toes," said Paul Linhard, proprietor of Art
City Sculpture Supplies in Ventura. "A lot of artists got money who
would have never gotten money before she came."</TE>
<TE>   "They brought in Consuelo to make the process more equitable,"
said Taras Tulek, a local painter. "When she distributed [the grant
money] more equally, she took it away from some groups that were used
to getting it."</TE>
<TE>   He and others say they're not buying the unofficial explanation
making the rounds of the arts community.</TE>
<TE>   "The excuse, the rationale we've been given was that she didn't
get along," said Suz Montgomery-Hart, a community activist. "This was
not a personality issue. People who didn't get money they wanted went
and complained."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Jim Monahan said that while he is unfamiliar with the
details of Underwood's departure, he believes that she was a good fit
as the city's cultural manager.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think she was dealt with fairly," Monahan said. "We lost
a valuable employee in the city. I believe she was very qualified."</TE>
<TE>   Several speakers Monday praised Underwood's handling of the public
arts program, which she helped start. She was able to bring the arts
community together for the first time, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "If anything good comes of this," said Montgomery-Hart, "it will
be that artists are going to mobilize and become more businesslike."</TE>
<TE>   Despite rumors to the contrary, DiGuilio said the city does plan
to replace Underwood.</TE>
<TE>   However, Underwood said she has concerns about the city's ability
to find a qualified replacement.</TE>
<TE>   "What's important is that they find a professional arts
administrator, someone with arts administration experience," she
said. "And it's equally important for the city to expand support for
the arts."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Walker, community services director for the city, said the
search to replace Underwood will begin in three to four weeks and
should take approximately three or four months. The city will seek
feedback from the arts community during the process, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Underwood has said she plans to remain in Ventura, focusing on her
public-art consulting business.</TE>

<LD>Dusty old sofas, classroom pets that shed, diesel fumes from ships
and port-bound trucks: These are some of the triggers of childhood
asthma that a Long Beach coalition wants to eliminate.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, the Long Beach Alliance for Children with Asthma got a
boost in efforts to ease the country's most common chronic childhood
disease.</LD>
<LD>   The alliance is among a dozen organizations around the state to
benefit from the launch of Community Action to Fight Asthma, a
three-year, $12-million program funded by the California Endowment, a
private health foundation.</LD>
<TE>   The organizations were chosen for funding after endowment
officials examined the 2001 California Health Interview Survey, the
state's first study breaking down public health data for each county.</TE>
<TE>   "The survey helps the endowment craft its interventions and begin
to intervene in solving this problem," said Robert K. Ross, president
of the Woodland Hills-based California Endowment.</TE>
<TE>   "We can focus our efforts better and better on those communities
that really need our help."</TE>
<TE>   The survey, a collaboration by the UCLA Center for Health Policy
Research, the California Department of Health Services and the Public
Health Institute, drew its findings from telephone interviews with
more than 55,000 households.</TE>
<TE>   The survey data show an estimated 3 million Californians suffer
from asthma symptoms at least once a year, with about 667,000 of
those between age 6 and 17.</TE>
<TE>   About 7.6% of Los Angeles County residents reported asthma
symptoms during the past year, lower than the state average of 8.8%,
the survey found.</TE>
<TE>   The Long Beach Alliance for Children with Asthma targets its
efforts in the city ZIP Code with the highest prevalence of asthma:
90813, the area around the port.</TE>
<TE>   Its members canvass homes, schools, churches and playgrounds
around the harbor for asthma triggers and urge their removal.</TE>
<TE>   The group will receive $1 million over three years from the
endowment, as will the other groups in the initiative, including the
Central/South-Central Los Angeles Asthma Collaborative.</TE>
<TE>   "We have all the medications in the world to give to these
children," said Elisa Nicholas, the Long Beach project director.</TE>
<TE>   "But if they live, learn and play in an area with environmental
triggers, their asthma will not be controlled."</TE>
<TE>   Parents of children with asthma attended a ceremony at a shopping
center near USC on Tuesday to announce the grants.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Rodriguez of Los Angeles brought along her son, Christopher,
celebrating his third birthday. As he colored pictures of such asthma
triggers as dust mites and grass, Rodriguez said she feels powerless
when she tries to eliminate everything that might aggravate his
condition.</TE>
<TE>   "I can only do so much with medicine to help him deal with the
disease," Rodriguez, 38, said in Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel so helpless and frightened when he can't breathe because
he became excited or was playing in the grass.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything anyone can do that helps me worry less about my son when
he is away from home would be wonderful."</TE>

<HD>Comatose Baby's Fate at Issue</HD>
<DH>Courts: Mother gives conflicting versions as hearing opens
to determine custody.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As her son lay in a coma at a hospital only a few miles away, a
mother sobbed in court Tuesday as she gave conflicting accounts to a
judge about how her baby was injured.</LD>
<LD>   At one point, Tamara Sepulveda, 23, shook a stuffed toy bear to
demonstrate to Judge Richard E. Behn how her ex-boyfriend injured
their baby, Christopher, last year in Cypress.</LD>
<LD>   The mother's testimony came during the first day of a custody
hearing at the family court in Orange. Initially, the mother said she
caused the injuries, but she later explained that she was confused by
the question and that the boy's father was responsible.</LD>
<TE>   The underlying question in the case is not who hurt 8-month-old
Christopher but what to do with him. Sepulveda wants doctors to
remove life-support machines and allow Christopher to die. The
child's father, who could face a murder charge if the boy dies, wants
life support to continue.</TE>
<TE>   Though Behn is being asked todecide who should take custody of the
child, he soon may face an even more perplexing de- cision: whether
to order the machines turned off in the child's interests.</TE>
<TE>   Moises Ibarra, 23, the infant's father, attended Tuesday's hearing
in an orange jail jumpsuit. Assistant Public Defender David
Dworakowski has said Ibarra wants to keep life-support machines on
out of hope that his child might live.</TE>
<TE>   According to a social serv- ices report, doctors have concluded
the baby suffered a devastating brain injury and will not recover.</TE>

<LD>Four Los Angeles-area people whose bodies were pulled from a Northern
California reservoir in March died of asphyxiation, and at least one
of them was strangled with a cord or rope, officials with the
Tuolumne County Sheriff's Department said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   A fifth person, whose body was found in the reservoir in October,
also suffocated, apparently because of tape used to gag him,
according to a medical examiner from Calaveras County.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities believe at least two of the victims were kidnapped.
The disappearances are all under investigation by the FBI and the Los
Angeles Police Department.</LD>
<TE>   According to death certificate information released Tuesday by the
Tuolumne County Sheriff's Department, three of the Los Angeles-area
victims--Rita Pekler, 39; Alexander Umansky, 35; and George Safiev,
37--were either suffocated or drowned when their weighted bodies were
thrown into New Melones Reservoir, a popular boating spot in the
Central Sierras.</TE>
<TE>   Filmmaker Nick Kharabadze, 29, of Woodland Hills, whose body also
was found in the lake, was strangled with a cord or rope, said Lt.
John Steely, a Tuolumne sheriff's spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The body of the fifth victim, Sherman Oaks businessman Meyer
Muscatel, 58, was found bound and gagged in the same lake in October.
Muscatel probably could not breathe because of tape used to gag him,
according to a report prepared by a medical examiner in nearby
Calaveras County.</TE>
<TE>   A medical examiner found a stab wound on Muscatel's arm, and much
of his body was crushed, possibly by a large vehicle, sometime after
he had been gagged.</TE>
<TE>   The autopsy report estimates that Muscatel was killed a day or two
after he was reported missing Oct. 12. The other victims disappeared
in December and January, but their estimated time of death has not
been released by officials.</TE>
<TE>   An FBI investigation into the disappearances began in December
when agents were alerted that Umansky was missing.</TE>
<TE>   Six men have been indicted on federal kidnapping charges and
prosecutors say they are planning to bring additional charges. Agents
are searching for a seventh suspect--a Siberian businessman named
Alexandr Aphonia, believed to have laundered ransom money paid by
Umansky's family.</TE>
<TE>   The suspects being held without bail in Los Angeles also have
roots in the former Soviet Union. Encino residents Iouri Mikhel, 37,
and Jurijus Kadamovas, 35, are charged with participating in the
abductions of Umansky and Safiev. Ainar Altmanis, 42, of Sherman Oaks
and Petro Krylov, 29, of West Hollywood have been charged with aiding
and abetting in the kidnapping of Umansky.</TE>
<TE>   The suspects face a possible death penalty if convicted. Their
trial is scheduled to begin July 2.</TE>
<TE>   Two additional defendants--Andrei Agueev, 34, and Andrei Liapine,
41--face charges of receiving Umansky's ransom money. Their federal
trial is to begin July 16.</TE>
<TE>   All the defendants have pleaded not guilty.</TE>

<HD>List Boosts Brain Cases Connected to Coasters</HD>
<DH>Safety: Congressman releases catalog that nearly triples
number of known injuries to 58. Park consultant sees no direct
correlation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Massachusetts congressman released a list Tuesday of 58 documented
brain injuries associated with roller coaster rides--nearly tripling
the number of previously published cases.</LD>
<LD>   The list--compiled by Rep. Edward J. Markey, (D-Mass.), who has
pushed for federal oversight and regulation of amusement parks--fuels
a continuing controversy over whether roller coasters pose a health
risk.</LD>
<LD>   "These cases are starting to accumulate," said David Moulton,
Markey's chief of staff. "It demonstrates that this problem is much
more common than previously thought.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not an isolated incident in Japan. It's dozens of cases all
over the United States."</TE>
<TE>   The injuries range from aneurysms and brain hemorrhages to lesser
incidents that resulted in headaches, nausea and vision problems.
Eight cases were fatal.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the International Assn. of Amusement Parks and
Attractions could not be reached for comment Tuesday evening, but
they have maintained that their rides are safe and that amusement
parks are one of the safest forms of recreation.</TE>
<TE>   Carley Ward, founder of Biodynamics Engineering Inc. in Pacific
Palisades and a frequent amusement park consultant, said she sees no
direct link between rides and injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "I've investigated a number of these cases, but in every case I've
looked at, there's ... some other complicating issue.</TE>
<TE>   "I've not seen any [injuries] at a park that are directly produced
in a healthy individual. It's always been something unique about the
person, or they're very elderly."</TE>
<TE>   Of the 58 cases tracked by Markey, 51 have occurred since 1990,
when, he said, the amusement park industry began an "arms race" to
build faster, higher and more thrilling rides. Ten cases were
reported at California parks.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-two of the cases have been published in medical literature.</TE>
<TE>   The remainder were reported to Markey, whose office contacted the
people involved, had their cases reviewed by a doctor and forwarded
the information to the Brain Injury Assn. of America, a nonprofit
organization studying the issue.</TE>
<TE>   In January, two Minnesota doctors published an article in the
Annals of Emergency Medicine finding a small but real risk of brain
injuries for people riding roller coasters.</TE>
<TE>   The doctors, Robert J. Braksiek and David J. Roberts, said studies
should be conducted to determine the effects of roller coaster forces
on the body. In New Jersey, state officials are drafting regulations
that would limit those forces on roller coasters.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Airport Commission voted 4 to 0 Tuesday to approve a three-year
contract extension for Los Angeles International Airport's major news
and gift concessionaire.</LD>
<LD>   The deal, which requires City Council approval, would extend W.H.
Smith Inc.'s contract with the airport through May 2005, with two
one-year extension options. In return, the company agreed to make $8
million in upgrades to its 40 shops at the airport and to create four
additional retail outlets.</LD>
<LD>   The Atlanta-based firm's contract was set to expire this month.
The city agency that operates the airport had discussed putting the
contract out to bid, but decided against it when concession sales
plummeted after the terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the most inopportune time to take a major contract like
this out to bid," said Rick Janisse, deputy executive director for
properties and concessions for the airport agency.</TE>

<HD>Barbara Castle, 91; British Politician</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Barbara Castle, the fiery Red Queen of Britain's Labor Party who held
several Cabinet posts under Prime Minister Harold Wilson but crippled
a brilliant career when she crossed swords with her country's
powerful trade unions, has died. She was 91.</LD>
<LD>   Castle, who had been in ill health since falling several weeks
ago, died Friday at her home in Buckinghamshire, England.</LD>
<LD>   Lady Castle served in the House of Commons from 1945 to 1979, then
spent a decade in the European Parliament, where she was head of the
British Labor Party delegation and vice chairwoman of the European
Socialist group.</LD>
<TE>   In 1990, she was made a life peer and entered the House of Lords
as Baroness Castle of Blackburn, announcing, "I am a propagandist,
speaker and writer, and want to continue to play my part in getting
rid of the Conservatives."</TE>
<TE>   After serving under Wilson as minister of overseas development in
1964, she entered the Cabinet as transport minister in 1965. After
three years at that post, in which she gained fame for introducing
the Breathalyzer to British motorists to test for drunk drivers, she
was promoted to secretary of state for employment and productivity.</TE>
<TE>   By that time, polls showed her to be the best known and most
popular member of the Cabinet after Wilson. She was being touted as a
future prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   But her two years as employment secretary ended those
possibilities after proposals she advanced split the party and the
Cabinet and nearly brought down the government.</TE>
<TE>   A seemingly endless series of wildcat strikes was crippling the
nation as radical activists in unions attacked union leadership.</TE>
<TE>   With the public turning against Labor for its failures in
industrial relations, Lady Castle introduced a program embodied in a
report she issued called "In Place of Strife."</TE>
<TE>   It called for additional rights for rank-and-file workers, laws
for cooling-off periods before strikes, and other measures to make
wildcat strikes less likely.</TE>
<TE>   Facing strong union opposition, the plan failed--though much of it
was later enacted by Tory governments--and the Labor Party lost the
1970 general election.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Lady Castle's flagging party standing, when Labor returned
to power in 1974, Wilson named her secretary of state for health and
social security, an immensely difficult job that she handled with
skill.</TE>
<TE>   By 1976, when Wilson stepped down and she was forced to leave the
Cabinet, Lady Castle had made her mark with such actions as securing
equal pay for women, having child welfare money paid to mothers
rather than fathers, and instituting pension reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Tony Blair, on learning of her death, hailed her as
one of Britain's "greatest political figures" and as a "great
heroine" of the Labor Party.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Bradford, England, Barbara Anne Betts won a scholarship to
Oxford University's St. Hugh's College, where she received a degree
in philosophy, politics and economics.</TE>
<TE>   During the Depression, her first job was selling dried fruit at a
department store in Manchester. She moved to London, joined the Labor
Party and became a columnist with the radical Tribune newspaper,
along with future Labor Party leader Michael Foot.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, she was an administrative officer with the
Ministry of Food. Then, in 1944, she became famous when her
photogenic figure was featured in a front-page story in the Daily
Mirror about a Labor Party conference. She then joined the Daily
Mirror as its housing correspondent and was elected to Parliament in
1945.</TE>
<TE>   Sir Stafford Cripps, a friend from her Tribune days, appointed her
his parliamentary private secretary at the Board of Trade, a post she
kept when Wilson replaced Cripps. She became a Wilson political ally,
nominating him when he ran unsuccessfully for party leader against
Hugh Gaitskell in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   She was the author of the two-volume "Castle Diaries," a largely
candid and immensely entertaining look at her life and times that was
published in the 1980s. In 1993, she published her autobiography,
"Fighting All the Way." Those volumes not only chronicle Labor Party
and British political history, but also include spicy segments in
which she identified Labor Party grandees who made passes at her over
the years.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, Ted Castle, whom she married in 1944, died in 1979.
She leaves no immediate survivors.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Turns to Retiree as Interim Chief</HD>
<DH>LAPD: Commission picks Martin Pomeroy, a former top deputy
to Parks. Nationwide search begins for a permanent leader.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Police Commission plucked a former LAPD deputy chief
out of retirement Tuesday and tapped him to lead the department while
the commission conducts a nationwide search for a new chief.</LD>
<LD>   Martin Pomeroy--a taciturn top-tier deputy to former Chief Bernard
C. Parks--was picked from a field of six finalists, all current or
former ranking members of the Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   The commission met with Pomeroy, who left the department in 2000
after 31 years of service, before choosing him to take over the
agency for roughly the next six months. Other candidates considered
for the temporary job included two deputy chiefs, a commander and two
retired LAPD officials.</LD>
<TE>   According to commissioners and others, Pomeroy was the favorite
because he has held a variety of supervisorial and management
positions in the department over the years--forging strong ties with
Mayor James K. Hahn and other city officials along the way.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, he worked for Parks on special projects, including
helping draft police reforms as part of a long negotiation with the
U.S. Justice Department over how best to address alleged civil rights
violations by the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Those talks resulted in the crafting of a consent decree that
gives a federal judge the authority to monitor the department's
compliance.</TE>
<TE>   "Marty Pomeroy is someone I have known for many years and who has
had a very distinguished career at the LAPD," Hahn said. "The goal is
that we lose no momentum on finishing the job that we started on
reforming the Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to lose no momentum on continuing our commitment to
community policing. We are going to lose no momentum on continuing
our effort to improve recruitment and retention in the LAPD. The job
of interim chief is not one to be taken lightly. I look forward to
working with Chief Pomeroy."</TE>
<TE>   Pomeroy's appointment is effective immediately. And with an
interim leader in place, city officials say they are ready to move
forward with a nationwide search for a full-term chief.</TE>
<TE>   Although commission staff members estimate that it could take six
months or more to replace Parks, city officials hope to have the
process completed by the end of August.</TE>
<TE>   The city will hire a head-hunting firm to identify qualified
candidates in police departments across the country. Meanwhile,
commissioners say they intend to form a citizens' committee to
establish the criteria for picking the new chief.</TE>
<TE>   The Police Commission and the city personnel department will
interview applicants and narrow the list to the top three candidates.
Hahn will then decide whom to nominate for the position. The nominee
requires City Council confirmation.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who have expressed interest in the permanent position
are LAPD deputy chiefs David Kalish and Margaret York, LAPD Cmdr. Jim
McDonnell, Oxnard Chief Art Lopez and Portland, Ore., Chief Mark
Kroeker.</TE>
<TE>   While the search moves forward, Pomeroy said he hopes to leave his
mark on the LAPD in the coming months.</TE>
<TE>   "I love this organization," Pomeroy said. "I hope that when I
leave in six months, you will say the LAPD is better because I was
here. I'm grateful for this opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   The commission sought a temporary chief who was not interested in
the full-term position. The job comes with the same benefits as those
for a chief. The annual salary range is $168,105 to $252,147.</TE>
<TE>   The department last had an interim chief when Bayan Lewis filled
the top spot for almost three months in 1997, after then-Chief Willie
Williams was denied a second term and before Parks was appointed.
Lewis retired after Parks was in place.</TE>
<TE>   Parks had sought to stay on for a second five-year term, but the
Police Commission denied his request, saying he had not done enough
to boost officer recruitment and lower the crime rate. Hahn had also
expressed concerns, questioning, among other things, Parks'
commitment to reforming the department.</TE>
<TE>   The former chief is considering running for the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Pomeroy--who moved to Montana after he retired in 2000--will take
the helm of the department at a time when the LAPD is under the eye
of federal authorities. Last year, the city entered into the consent
decree with the federal government mandating wide-ranging changes to
department policies and practices.</TE>
<TE>   Under the terms of that decree, the LAPD is required by law to
meet certain deadlines for programs: installing computerized officer
tracking, for instance, and collecting data related to the race of
those stopped by LAPD officers.</TE>
<TE>   Top LAPD officials, including then-Chief Parks, had opposed some
of those provisions, but the city's agreement to implement the decree
obligates the department to meet the deadlines or face possible
sanctions from a federal judge.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Pomeroy inherits not only the difficulties faced by
many big-city chiefs, but also the oversight of a judge and
court-approved monitor who are charged with ensuring that the
department keeps its word on the areas covered by that document.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners said Tuesday that they have confidence in the new
interim chief, in part because of his wide-ranging background and
familiarity with the consent decree's requirements.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to working on reform efforts, Pomeroy recently
supervised the department's SWAT team, the criminal intelligence unit
and a variety of other special detective functions. Pomeroy also
commanded all LAPD disaster response operations during the 1994
Northridge earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   Commission President Rick Caruso said he would like the next chief
to have qualifications that mirror Pomeroy's.</TE>
<TE>   "[Pomeroy] understands the role of civilian oversight in the
operation and the management of running this department," Caruso
said. "He has an unblemished record of integrity and of service to
this city.... We welcome him back."</TE>

<HD>Panel Backs Abuse Case Bill</HD>
<DH>Legislature: Senate committee OKs measure lengthening
statute of limitations on suits against Catholic Church or other
third parties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A bill that would lengthen the statute of limitations so adult
victims could sue the Roman Catholic Church or other organizations
for damages in long-ago child-abuse cases sailed out of a Senate
committee on a unanimous vote Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Senate President Pro Tem John L. Burton (D-San Francisco) said his
newly unveiled bill was a direct response to the widening national
scandal over sex-abuse by Catholic priests and what Burton called the
church's practice of reassigning offending priests to tasks in which
they would have contact with children.</LD>
<LD>   Supported by advocates for child abuse victims, the bill (SB 1779)
cleared the Judiciary Committee on a 5-0 vote and now moves to the
full Senate, where easy approval is expected. No witnesses or
committee members spoke against it.</LD>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis, a Catholic, was reviewing the plan but had no
position on it, his office said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the California Catholic Conference, which
represents all dioceses and archdioceses in the state, also said it
had no position on the bill, whose original contents were removed a
few days ago and replaced by the Burton plan.</TE>
<TE>   The spokesman said conference officials were studying the measure.
"The thing was just drafted, and it is moving fast," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, the statute of limitations for filing such a suit is 26
years of age. The bill would suspend that age limit for a one-year
period, during which the lawsuits could be filed by an adult of any
age who had been sexually abused as a child.</TE>
<TE>   Under Burton's plan, however, the target of the lawsuits could not
be an alleged abuser but only an employer or other responsible third
party who knew or should have known of the abuse and failed to take
reasonable steps to prevent it. Burton said such steps could include
alerting police or taking actions that would isolate the employee
from children.</TE>
<TE>   Burton said the bill was aimed at "deep-pockets" defendants such
as the Catholic Church.</TE>
<TE>   He said he based his plan in part on the complaint that sexual
predators were known to church superiors but reassigned to
unsuspecting other parishes and to ministries that involved contact
with children.</TE>
<TE>   At a minimum, these priests should be assigned to a "seniors home
as opposed to a Catholic Youth Organization Camp," where they could
prey on children again, Burton said.</TE>
<TE>   David Clohessy, director of the 4,000-member Survivors Network of
Those Abused by Priests, said he was not surprised that the bill drew
no opposition witnesses. "Over the last few years, there has been a
sea change in the public's understanding of the psychological damages
of child abuse," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He told the committee of "heartbreaking" discoveries that adult
victims make about their situations long after the trauma of sexual
abuse occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Clohessy said experienced pedophiles are extraordinarily skillful
at persuading young victims that "it is your fault." Increasingly, he
said, adults in their 30s, 40s and 50s come to an understanding of
"what happened to me. Now I finally understand it was not my fault."</TE>

<HD>State High Court Weighs Decision on Smoker Suits</HD>
<DH>Litigation: Justices consider whether tobacco firms, which
once were protected under state law, can be targeted over illnesses
diagnosed before 1998.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The California Supreme Court wrestled Tuesday with whether to bar
smokers' lawsuits against tobacco companies if their illnesses were
diagnosed prior to 1998, when the state repealed a law that protected
the cigarette industry from litigation.</LD>
<LD>   The state high court heard arguments in two cases that will
establish ground rules for tobacco litigation in California in the
future. The rulings, which will be made within 90 days, may spark
many more lawsuits or sharply reduce the number of people who can sue
for smoking-related illnesses.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of smoking-related lawsuits already are pending in
California and will be affected by the rulings.</LD>
<TE>   In determining who will be permitted to hold the tobacco industry
responsible for illness and death, the court must decide whether the
former law that once protected cigarette companies from litigation
continues to shield them in some cases.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the cases before the court, a now-deceased smoker was
diagnosed with lung cancer in 1996, two years before the state
repealed the law. The other case involves a lawsuit that was based on
actions of the tobacco industry during the years that the companies
had immunity from much litigation. Plaintiffs lost both cases in
lower courts.</TE>
<TE>   Several justices suggested at Tuesday's hearing that the industry
shield, passed in 1988 and repealed in 1998, was not an absolute bar
to recent suits based on smoking and illnesses that began many years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you have to wait for 20 years before you can sue tobacco
companies?" Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar asked skeptically.</TE>
<TE>   Law Wasn't Retroactive, Tobacco Attorney Says</TE>
<TE>   Ronald L. Olson, representing Philip Morris Cos., argued that
state law prevents smokers from suing the industry for actions that
occurred before industry protections were lifted.</TE>
<TE>   He contended that the court cannot presume the repeal was
retroactive unless the law contained a "clear, unmistakable and
unequivocal declaration of retroactivity.</TE>
<TE>   "Absent that," Olson said, "there can be no retroactivity."</TE>
<TE>   Justice Joyce L. Kennard agreed with Olson. "I think he is
absolutely right," she said at the hearing. However, Kennard also
raised the possibility that the court could still allow smokers to
sue for conduct by cigarette companies that began before the industry
protections were passed.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for smoking victims argued that the industry never enjoyed
complete immunity from lawsuits. They argued that the law only
shielded tobacco companies if they could show their products were
pure and unadulterated, and freely purchased by consumers despite
their hazards.</TE>
<TE>   Madelyn J. Chaber, representing a smoker who died, said the
Legislature repealed the protections because lawmakers realized they
had been duped by tobacco companies. The protective legislation was
passed at a time when few knew that companies were secretly trying to
make cigarettes more addictive, Chaber said.</TE>
<TE>   The subsequent repeal showed clearly what the Legislature
intended, Chaber said. "The purpose was to reject the wrongs and the
fraud that had been committed," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Justice Ronald M. George pressed tobacco lawyers to explain
why the industry should have been protected from litigation at all if
its products contained additives that made them impure and
adulterated.</TE>
<TE>   H. Joseph Escher III, who represented R.J. Reynolds, denied that
companies tried to make smoking more addictive. "The allegations
aren't true," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Escher also noted that the United States surgeon general warned of
the dangers of smoking in 1964, and consumers smoked cigarettes even
though they were aware of the hazards.</TE>
<TE>   Chaber, however, said the industry put out "a massive
disinformation campaign" to discredit the warning. Werdegar observed
that even if smokers knew their habit could be dangerous, they may
not have been aware that cigarettes were addictive.</TE>
<TE>   But Justice Marvin R. Baxter suggested that it might be unfair to
hold the industry responsible for conduct that occurred at a time

<HD>Helping His Students Find Their Voices</HD>
<DH>For more than half a century, Louis Sarracino has used
patience and humor to calm, cajole and inspire budding public
speakers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Professor Louis Sarracino's voice will finally have a chance to rest.</LD>
<LD>   His throat battered by 55 years of easing college students' stage
fright, the speech teacher has sucked almost constantly on herbal
cough drops.</LD>
<LD>   Sarracino, 80, is retiring from East Los Angeles College at the
end of this semester, after a career so long that he has taught
grandchildren of his first students.</LD>
<TE>   Although his workload has shriveled to two courses this semester
from seven at its peak, Sarracino still heads his classes with a
patience and humor that encourages public speaking, whether for
recent immigrants, shy women just out of their teens or men scared to
talk about their feelings.</TE>
<TE>   "I've enjoyed thoroughly being part of the process of making some
of my students better people," said Sarracino, who lives with his
wife in Huntington Beach. "But I've been at it long enough."</TE>
<TE>   He began one of his last classes the same way he started some of
his first: screaming and gesturing as he quoted from "Cyrano de
Bergerac" in an exercise to help reduce students' jitters.</TE>
<TE>   As Sarracino's students mimicked his actions, some halfheartedly
and others with movements as sweeping as his, their voices filled the
muggy bungalow and streamed out its windows.</TE>
<TE>   Dapper in a red gingham shirt and khakis with shoes and belt of
mahogany leather, Sarracino ambled around the classroom to prompt
some of the more self-conscious students to participate.</TE>
<TE>   A dozen students then took turns speaking in front of the class,
on topics that included singing lessons in Macedonia, making
quesadillas and condom use with a cucumber prop.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no holds barred in his class," said current student
Michael Gomez, 28, of Maywood, who gave a speech about his "homegirl"
friends. "It's as uncensored of a college experience as you'll find
anywhere. He lets people really explore things about life that other
professors wouldn't let us talk about."</TE>
<TE>   Many of Sarracino's current and former students, including Gomez,
said his teaching has inspired them to enter teaching or
communication careers.</TE>
<TE>   Yesmean Rihbany, who took classes from Sarracino in the 1970s and
taught communication herself at the high school and university level,
said the professor's unconventional teaching created a safe learning
environment.</TE>
<TE>   "He put the idea of grades off to the side and taught us to
challenge other people's ideas," said Rihbany, 48, of Long Beach, who
is now a corporate speech trainer.</TE>
<TE>   "I had terrible stage fright when I entered his class and no
thought whatsoever of going into speech communication. But Louie is
one of those people who changes the course of your life."</TE>
<TE>   College administrators have also noticed Sarracino's effect on his
students. Ernest H. Moreno, who has been president of East Los
Angeles College for nine years, called Sarracino "an institution."
The school does not keep records about longevity of service, but
Sarracino clearly is among its most veteran professors, the president
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He teaches one of those classes that people usually put off as
long as possible," Moreno said. "But you can't ignore the long lines
to enroll in his classes every semester. What he does with his
teaching is really magical."</TE>
<TE>   Moreno and other officials honored Sarracino last week with
speeches and a plaque at a ceremony following his last class.</TE>
<TE>   Sarracino almost didn't finish college himself. A poor Italian boy
who grew up in East Los Angeles and started at Los Angeles City
College thinking Aristotle was a kind of cocktail, he felt out of
step with more affluent students. He stayed in college only at the
insistence of one of his professors.</TE>
<TE>   After receiving a bachelor's degree from Cal State L.A., he spent
World War II stationed in Texas, where he helped soldiers returning
from combat deal with their psychological scars. He later received
advanced degrees in speech and communication from UC Santa Barbara
and USC before starting to teach at the college level.</TE>
<TE>   A former Fulbright scholar who taught in Iraq and the Netherlands,
Sarracino has spent nearly all of his career at the Monterey Park
campus.</TE>
<TE>   Sarracino said he never wanted to publish or scuffle for tenure at
a large university, adding that working at a community college
allowed him to employ innovative teaching methods and worry less
about being politically correct.</TE>
<TE>   He never fails students who take his class, a college graduation
requirement. Sarracino tells students to withdraw if their grades are
low and he calls those with many absences to urge them to attend.</TE>
<TE>   "All that crazy pressure they're relieved of goes into writing
their speeches and delivering them," said Sarracino, who requires
eight speeches from his students during a semester.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just here to reduce their stage fright and make them think. I
don't get any kick out of hurting people who've already overcome so
many obstacles to get to college in the first place."</TE>
<TE>   Since Sarracino has been teaching only one day a week, he has had
the rest of his days free to learn bridge, latch-hook a portrait of
Egyptian Queen Nefertiti and play dodge ball and "school" with his
three grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Fiddling with a beige baseball cap from his granddaughters that
reads "No. 1 Papa," Sarracino eagerly shows visitors pictures of them
and his three sons, who work in the entertainment industry.</TE>
<TE>   Sarracino flits from subject to subject, talking in the same
breath about the importance of living creatures--he'd drive a black
widow spider to an uninhabited area rather than kill it--and his
garden of broccoli and cabbage.</TE>
<TE>   But when he's in the classroom, Sarracino's attention is on his
students: nodding, exclaiming and murmuring praise as they speak.</TE>
<TE>   When Dimitar Zlatev, 56, launched into a tender rendition of "O
Sole Mio" after a speech on learning to sing as a young man in
Macedonia, Sarracino's expression turned dreamy as he listened.</TE>
<TE>   "Students just don't worry about being embarrassed in his class,"
said Zlatev, who moved to Whittier from Macedonia in 1989. "He helps
us feel free to experiment instead of pushing too hard for us to
memorize facts or read books."</TE>
<TE>   Bonding with his students is important for Sarracino, whose
Rolodex bulges with the names and addresses of former students from
the 1950s through last year. In lieu of a final, Sarracino takes his
students to dinner, which he will do for the last time this week.</TE>
<TE>   "Teaching is an inner connection between yourself and your
students that really nurtures both people," Sarracino said. "They pay
me to get rid of stage fright, but my true compensation is the
friends I've made in my students."</TE>

<HD>Canyon Dwellers Lose Round</HD>
<DH>Land use: Trabuco residents express disappointment as O.C.
supervisors give early OK to a strip mall on their quiet corner.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trabuco Canyon residents lost another round Tuesday in their fight
against suburbia's encroachment when the Orange County Board of
Supervisors gave preliminary approval to a strip mall and gas station
across from Cook's Corner.</LD>
<LD>   By a 3-0 vote, supervisors gave conceptual approval to Live Oak
Plaza, a 23-acre parcel. Six of those acres will be turned into a
strip mall with 42,000 square feet of retail and office space, 234
parking spaces and a gas station with eight pumps; the remaining
acres will be left as open space.</LD>
<LD>   Ray Chandos, a spokesman for the Rural Canyons Conservancy Fund,
which has fought a decades-old legal battle against the development,
was clearly disappointed.</LD>
<TE>   "We do intend to continue our fight, but right now I don't know
what our next step may be," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The conservancy had appealed a March 13 decision by the county
planning commission, which had recommended the mall's approval to the
board. Supervisors Cynthia P. Coad, Jim Silva and Todd Spitzer made
the decision to go forward with the project. Supervisors Chuck Smith
and Tom Wilson were away on business.</TE>
<TE>   The county received more than 350 letters from residents
protesting the plaza plan and heard from more than a dozen speakers
at Tuesday's meeting. Canyon residents believe that once one such
development is finalized, others already in the planning pipeline may
follow.</TE>
<TE>   Two other proposals could add nearly 500 homes to the sparsely
populated hillsides around Cook's Corner, a short distance down Live
Oak Canyon Road from Cleveland National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   The project now shifts from the planning process to the
developer's permitting process. That phase is more meticulous and
involves drainage, environmental impact, archeological sites and
water-quality issues, a planning spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Of the speakers, many echoed the sentiments of John Sefton, a
Trabuco Canyon resident who urged the board to abandon the plaza idea
on the grounds that building it would adversely affect the quality of
life in the canyon. "Surely it must be the 3,000th strip mall in
Orange County and the 11,000th gas station. Why should we give up
uniqueness for sameness?" Sefton said.</TE>
<TE>   But the decision was good news for W. Dean Brown, a spokesman for
Live Oak Plaza's agent, the Planning Consortium in Orange. He said at
least 70% of the property will be "left as is, as open space."</TE>
<TE>   Brown said the project uses only a small portion of the property,
across from Cook's Corner cafe--the county's famed roadhouse at the
intersection of El Toro, Live Oak Canyon and Santiago Canyon roads.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe this project is in keeping with the rural nature of
the area. But it's been a long battle every step of the way," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Live Oak Plaza's owners cleared a major legal hurdle
when the 4th District Court of Appeal upheld a lower-court ruling
that said the project could proceed. The lower court found that an
environmental impact report was adequate and that an earlier Board of
Supervisors' approval to rezone the property from residential to
commercial was supported by substantial evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Chandos, whose conservancy lost the court battle, said he believes
Tuesday's board action will allow Live Oak Plaza's owners to obtain a
subdivision map as a precursor to selling the property to a
developer.</TE>
<TE>   Brown acknowledged that the owners, who acquired the property
decades ago, are not commercial developers and do not have the funds
to build the mall and gas station--meaning that they will probably
sell it.</TE>
<TE>   The next phase in the project's planning may prove to be difficult
for the parcel's owners. They will encounter new oversight of project
planning by supervisors and new opponents, including water-quality
activists from Clean Water Now! who voiced concerns about polluting
nearby Aliso Creek, and Native Americans, who say that there are two
archeological sites on the land.</TE>
<TE>   Bud Sepulveda, a member of the Juaneno Band of Mission Indians,
said the county should not ignore the potential destruction of the
two sites and recommended separate environmental studies.</TE>
<TE>   During the hearing, Spitzer reiterated the board's decision more
than a year ago to restrict the county planning agency's
administrative discretion and to give supervisors a more "hands-on"
approach to dealing with sensitive planning issues.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said the change would allow anyone who challenges planning
decisions the opportunity to be heard by the board before the
planning process moves on to the next phase.</TE>

<HD>South L.A. Leads Jump in Homicides</HD>
<DH>Crime: For the first four months of year, 102 killings are
reported. Citywide, slayings up 39%.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Confirming an alarming trend, Los Angeles Police Department officials
reported Tuesday that South Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley
saw the biggest jumps in homicide rates citywide in the first four
months of 2002.</LD>
<LD>   The four divisions in the LAPD's South Bureau reported 102
slayings between Jan. 1 and May 4, a 64.5% jump over the same period
last year, acting Chief Michael Bostic told the Los Angeles Police
Commission.</LD>
<LD>   The five Valley divisions reported 46 homicides, a 58.6% increase
compared with that period last year.</LD>
<TE>   Citywide, 231 homicides were reported in the first four months of
this year, compared with 166 the year before, a 39% increase,
according to Bostic.</TE>
<TE>   Police officials attribute the jump to an increase in gang
activity and deep cuts in funding for anti-gang units.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles homicides were at a 30-year low in 1999, with 425.
Since then, they have increased, with 584 recorded last year.</TE>

<HD>LAPD Agrees to Shrink DARE Program</HD>
<DH>Compromise: Police Commission approves a plan to shift
officers to gang and narcotics units.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The LAPD's longtime drug-abuse prevention program DARE will be
reduced in size but not eliminated under a compromise struck between
police officials and the Police Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Commission President Rick Caruso had said last week he was
prepared to essentially scrap DARE to free up more officers to combat
gangs and narcotics-related crime.</LD>
<LD>   But on Tuesday, a last-ditch effort by police officials to save
the high-profile DARE program proved successful.</LD>
<TE>   The commission agreed to allow DARE to keep 44 officers--enough to
continue its elementary school programs. Junior high and high school
programs will be cut, except at a few magnet schools.</TE>
<TE>   DARE has 119 budgeted positions but has been getting by with about
70 officers because of LAPD staffing shortages that have resulted in
positions being shifted. Mayor James K. Hahn had earlier proposed a
city budget for next year that would in essence make the vacancies
permanent, capping DARE at 74 officers.</TE>
<TE>   Because the Los Angeles Police Department remains short-staffed,
commissioners earlier this year had proposed taking all but about
half a dozen officers out of DARE, which deploys officers to schools
to educate children on the perils of drug use. The program was
created by the LAPD in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts have argued that DARE's effectiveness is limited. But
LAPD officials see it as one of the department's proudest
accomplishments and one of the few focusing on crime prevention.</TE>
<TE>   Even when pressed by the Police Commission, LAPD brass were loath
to let DARE be gutted for fear that it would never be reinstated.</TE>
<TE>   Their resistance frustrated Caruso, who wanted to take positions
from DARE to bolster narcotics field enforcement units, which have
been cut especially severely.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso had argued that narcotics units have lost too many
officers, and should be restored at DARE's expense.</TE>
<TE>   But Tuesday's agreement seemed to close the issue by shifting at
least 35 positions from DARE to specialized units.</TE>
<TE>   Police officials, however, were not successful in one proposal
they had tried to sell the commission: They had suggested one means
of saving DARE would be to gut juvenile narcotics units.</TE>
<TE>   Given that the whole point of the effort was to strengthen
narcotics enforcement, the proposal "was not in the spirit of what we
asked," commission Executive Director Joe Gunn told acting Chief Mike
Bostic at Tuesday's meeting.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, juvenile narcotics was allowed to keep its
field-enforcement officers, and LAPD officials promised to preserve
the DARE officers through cuts elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   A final twist in the DARE saga came just as the commission was
finishing its deliberations.</TE>
<TE>   Community activist Ted Hayes rose to speak. Hayes frequently
comments on nearly every item on the commission's agenda--not always
on point--but he rarely draws much of a response from commissioners.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, though, Hayes asked why Los Angeles Unified School
District police were not trained as DARE officers, since they were on
school campuses anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso sat up straight with a surprised look on his face. "That's
a very good point!" he said. "That's a good idea. Mr. Hayes has a
good idea!"</TE>
<TE>   Caruso then ordered commission staff to draft a letter to district
officials suggesting that school police officers be trained in DARE.</TE>

<HD>Officials Warned on Bioterror</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A leading expert on chemical and biological warfare warned Tuesday
that local officials must do far more to prepare hospitals and fire
and police departments for terrorist attacks that could occur with
little notice.</LD>
<LD>   Amy E. Smithson of the nonprofit Henry L. Stimson Center in
Washington, D.C., delivered the keynote speech at a three-day
state-sponsored conference in the City of Industry on disaster
preparedness. About 400 police, fire and public health officials
attended.</LD>
<LD>   Smithson said New York is far ahead of most other American cities
in establishing a system to recognize the first indications of a
biological attack through quick identification of new patterns of
medicine purchases by sick people, emergency room admissions or calls
to emergency lines.</LD>
<TE>   The United States is probably not on the verge of a massive
chemical or biological attack, Smithson said.</TE>
<TE>   Attacks that have occurred, such as those last year involving
anthrax-laced mail, probably did not represent any attempt to kill
people in large numbers, she said, and the threat could take decades
to be realized.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, she said, "we know that Al Qaeda wants to kill
people," and it is necessary to be ready.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital system, she said, is not prepared at present to cope
with large numbers of people, in the hundreds or thousands,
descending on facilities to get treatment or preventive medicines in
case smallpox or even more exotic diseases strike.</TE>
<TE>   She said that fire and police departments must prepare to assist
hospitals in handling large groups of distressed people and that it
might even be a good idea to prepare to use fast-food chain
restaurants to dispense preventive medicine at drive-through windows.</TE>

<HD>Anaheim Doctor Still Held in Israel</HD>
<DH>Arrest: The Muslim American physician was asked to assess
medical need in Palestinian lands. U.S. reports no signs of
mistreatment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE and GREG KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Israeli officials confirmed Tuesday that an American Muslim physician
from Anaheim has been arrested in Tel Aviv on suspicion of
involvement with terrorist activities.</LD>
<LD>   David Douek of the Israel Consulate in Los Angeles could provide
no details on the arrest Sunday of Riad Abdelkarim, an Anaheim
physician who associates said had traveled to the Palestinian
territories for medical relief work. Also detained over the weekend
on suspicion of terrorism was Dalell Mohmed, director of KinderUSA, a
Dallas-based charity for Palestinian children.</LD>
<LD>   "Because of the sensitivity to national security and international
security, the details are very sensitive," Douek said. He said he
tried to get more information on the detentions because of the
tremendous media interest, but was told by the Israeli Foreign
Ministry that none would be forthcoming at this time.</LD>
<TE>   Family members of the two detainees expressed disbelief that their
relatives would be involved in terrorism, fear for their safety and
outrage over what they called Israeli harassment of medical relief
workers.</TE>
<TE>   "These are ridiculous allegations," said Abdelkarim's brother
Basil, a Bellflower physician. "There is no evidence to support these
claims."</TE>
<TE>   In Dallas, Mohmed's older sister, Alice El-Jundi, said Tuesday
that she was appalled by the charges. She said her sister is a
humanitarian aid worker who has delivered wheelchairs to orphans
throughout the Mideast and other relief to Bosnia and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "If she was involved in terrorism, why would she go back there on
a mission of aid? Why would she stay there? She's not an idiot,"
El-Jundi said.</TE>
<TE>   Some details of the detentions were provided Tuesday by Rushdie
Abdel Cader, a San Luis Obispo physician who traveled with Abdelkarim
to assess the medical needs in the Palestinian territories at the
invitation of the International Medical Corps, a Los Angeles-based
global humanitarian organization. Cader said that he was also
detained at Ben Gurion Airport with Abdelkarim but was released 16
hours later after an interrogation.</TE>
<TE>   Cader said Israeli security officials would not allow him to sleep
during the ordeal and constantly called him a liar when he answered
questions such as where he had traveled and whether he had brought
money into the Palestinian territories. Cader said he told officials
that he had distributed between $2,000 and $3,000 to needy
Palestinians in Jenin and elsewhere, money collected from his
American neighbors, and was told such acts were illegal.</TE>
<TE>   He also said that he was not touched by Israeli security
officials, but that he witnessed them shoving Abdelkarim when they
transferred him to another room.</TE>
<TE>   "They said: 'We don't care if you're an American, and we don't
care what Americans think,'" Cader said. "There is no due process
over there. It's really scary."</TE>
<TE>   Douek said he could not confirm the account.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. representative met with both Abdelkarim and Mohmed on
Tuesday, and a State Department official in Israel said there was no
evidence of mistreatment.</TE>
<TE>   "What a lot of people have wanted to know in this case--as in
other cases--is what are you guys doing to get them out of [prison]?"
the State official said. "We can't just go and get them out, just
like the Israeli Consulate couldn't get someone out of a U.S. prison
if they were being held," the official said.</TE>

<HD>Fund Pullback Deals Blow to the 'Expo Line'</HD>
<DH>Transit: Federal agency withdraws $156 million that the MTA
had counted on to help build light-rail link between L.A. and Santa
Monica.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has learned that federal
officials have pulled $156 million intended for construction of a
rail line that could one day link Los Angeles and Santa Monica, a
move that could delay the project and force the creation of a much
shorter railway.</LD>
<LD>   The agency envisions 20,000 riders a day boarding light-rail
trains that would roll through dense neighborhoods down a route along
Exposition Boulevard. The so-called "Expo Line" would run past the
University of Southern California campus and stop near Culver City. A
later segment would send trains all the way to Santa Monica.</LD>
<LD>   MTA officials say they've been operating for at least three years
under the assumption that $156 million once tagged for a mid-city
extension of the Red Line could be used on an alternative.</LD>
<TE>   They came up with the Expo Line after studying numerous options,
including a monorail running down Wilshire Boulevard. Last June, MTA
planners got the go-ahead from the MTA board to proceed with
engineering the Expo Line.</TE>
<TE>   But the Federal Transit Administration, gatekeeper of the nation's
transportation budget, surprised MTA officials by taking the $156
million off the table.</TE>
<TE>   The FTA has now made that money--about 40% of the Expo Line's
budget--available to new mass transit construction projects in other
regions.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the federal agency claim they never made specific
promises to fund the Expo Line. What's more, they finally released
the money for other projects because the Expo Line's planning will
not be done in time for construction to begin by the end of next
year. That's when authorization for the nation's massive four-year
transit package, approved by Congress, comes to a close.</TE>
<TE>   "The project is not what they specified originally ... and the MTA
is still working on preliminary engineering out there," said FTA
spokesman Bruce Frame. "They aren't going to be done for at least a
year, maybe more."</TE>
<TE>   The move forces MTA planners to pin their hopes on the FTA backing
the project in future budget requests, particularly when Congress
considers another nationwide reauthorization of transit construction
in 2003. That means the Expo Line may suddenly find itself competing
for congressional approval with scores of other light-rail lines and
other big-ticket items across the country.</TE>
<TE>   The FTA this year listed the Expo line as a "recommended" project,
and experts close to the federal agency say the chances are excellent
that the $156 million, and possibly even more, will once again be
tagged for the MTA.</TE>
<TE>   But some top MTA officials expressed doubt.</TE>
<TE>   "The funding is in danger and the project, I believe, is in
danger," said Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, county supervisor and an MTA
board member. "I am definitely, definitely worried."</TE>
<TE>   Though she has been a critic of the line's design, Burke said she
will press for restoration of the money during a trip to the nation's
capital this week. She said she was asked to do so by MTA Chief
Executive Roger Snoble in a meeting last week.</TE>
<TE>   Snoble, meantime, seemed to downplay the funding issue.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm relatively sure we can get the money later," he said. "We'll
see what happens in reauthorization.... We feel they owe us."</TE>
<TE>   Snoble said he would like a written promise that the FTA will back
funding for the project in the future. Though generally optimistic in
a recent interview on the matter, in an April letter to FTA
Administrator Jennifer Dorn, he was less sanguine, writing: "Now is
not the appropriate time for FTA to entertain the possibility of
abrogating the long-standing commitment to Los Angeles by releasing
these funds for other projects."</TE>
<TE>   Snoble said one solution would be to use state and local money to
build shorter legs of the route than previously planned, possibly
going only as far as USC. He worries that completion of the overall
project could be delayed by several years.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed rail line has long been controversial. Burke is
representative of a faction worried about safety if the line extends
past USC onto busy streets and near schools.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed path of the second phase of the project, extending
the line past Robertson Boulevard to Santa Monica, has been haggled
over by residents in Los Angeles' Cheviot Hills neighborhood and in
Culver City, many of whom want nothing to do with a commuter train
zipping through their streets dozens of times daily.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the most consistent push for construction has come
from a group of citizen proponents calling themselves Friends 4 Expo
Transit, who have touted the benefits of the light-rail line.</TE>
<TE>   "We're sort of on pins and needles," said Darrell Clarke, head of
the group.</TE>
<TE>   "To give up a position we have already won, when we were promised
the money, it doesn't quite seem fair."</TE>

<HD>Arthur Gauerke, 107; World War I Veteran Was a Minister for
43 Years</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Well past 100 years old, he still managed 10 push-ups every morning
and every night. He never smoked, never drank, ate properly and
firmly believed one should never worry too much.</LD>
<LD>   "Work," he often said during his 43-year career as a minister and
for many years afterward as a dedicated volunteer, "is my
recreation."</LD>
<LD>   Arthur G. Gauerke, an Army veteran who served during World War I,
died April 6 in Escondido of causes associated with aging. He was
107, and believed to be the oldest veteran of the Great War living in
Southern California.</LD>
<TE>   Gauerke was born on a Wisconsin farm in 1894, the year that saw
the invention of the drinking straw, the paper clip and the zipper.
The eighth of 10 children, he grew up milking cows and hoeing corn
before walking to his one-room school.</TE>
<TE>   After graduation, with only the six weeks of training customary in
rural America during the early 20th century, Gauerke became the
school's teacher. For four years, he taught all grade levels,
including several pupils older and larger than him.</TE>
<TE>   In March 1918, as America continued sending doughboys "over there"
to participate in "the war to end all wars," Gauerke joined the Army.
He served in an Army post office at Camp Grant, Ill., until his
discharge that December.</TE>
<TE>   There was to be no overseas duty for him, he once explained with a
bit of pride in his work, because the base postmaster "wouldn't let
me go."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his early teaching experience, Gauerke knew from an early
age that he wanted to be a minister. He graduated from Lawrence
University in Appleton, Wis., then studied at a seminary. He was a
pastor for the Evangelical United Brethren Church, serving churches
in western Canada for 27 years and in Wisconsin for 16 years.</TE>
<TE>   Gauerke served as national chaplain of the World War I Veterans
for several years and was a regular at national conventions. In 1993,
he joined others in Oak Park, Ill., in accepting a 75th anniversary
medal commemorating World War I and honoring his military service.</TE>
<TE>   He spent many of his retirement years in Wheaton, Ill.,
volunteering with American Legion Post 76, the Optimist Club and
ambulance crews, and visiting patients at local convalescent centers.
He moved to Escondido in 1997 to be near his daughter Joyce Tanner.</TE>
<TE>   A widower, Gauerke also is survived by daughter Ruth Denker of
Naperville, Ill.; nine grandchildren; and 16 great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service is planned Saturday in Wheaton. Burial will be
in Prairie du Sac, Wis.</TE>

<HD>Judge Bars Access to Van Dam Home</HD>
<DH>Court: Murder suspect's attorneys wanted to look for
evidence in girl's slaying that could aid their client's defense.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A judge Tuesday refused to order Damon and Brenda van Dam to let
attorneys and investigators for the man accused of killing the
couple's daughter into their home to look for evidence that might
help in his defense.</LD>
<LD>   David Westerfield, a neighbor of the Van Dams, is charged with
kidnapping and murdering their 7-year-old daughter, Danielle.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Dusek said the Van Dams are adamantly
opposed to a request by Westerfield's defense team for access to
their home in the Sabre Springs neighborhood of San Diego. "They do
not want that evil in their home again," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Westerfield, 50, a self-employed engineer, is accused of
kidnapping Danielle from her bedroom Feb. 1 and killing her. The
child's body was found Feb. 27 in a wooded area 25 miles from her
home.</TE>
<TE>   "I will not force the family to do something they are opposed to,"
said Superior Court Judge William Mudd. But he said he may have
jurors go to the home during the trial, set to begin May 17. Defense
attorney Steven Feldman asked that, if jurors do visit the home, no
memorials or pictures of Danielle be visible. Mudd did not rule on
that request.</TE>
<TE>   As lawyers argued over numerous pretrial motions, Dusek for the
first time said prosecutors believe that Westerfield suffocated
Danielle, knocking out several of her teeth in the process. The
county medical examiner testified at a preliminary hearing that the
body was too badly decomposed for him to determine how she was
killed.</TE>
<TE>   Mudd ruled that evidence about alleged drug and alcohol use by
Danielle's parents be limited to the days before and after the girl's
disappearance. The defense wants to explore what it characterizes as
lifestyle issues, a request opposed by prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Mudd delayed ruling on a defense request to prohibit alleged child
pornography found in Westerfield's garage from being introduced in
court. The defendant faces a misdemeanor charge of possession of
child pornography.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that he had sexual fantasies about underage
girls, but Feldman says the pornography would unfairly bias a jury
against Westerfield and is irrelevant to charges of kidnapping and
murder.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a case in which the state is trying to kill Mr.
Westerfield," Feldman said, "and all we can do is protect his
constitutional rights."</TE>
<TE>   Mudd expressed annoyance at local media coverage of the case. He
noted recent newspaper and television stories about the "swinger"
lifestyle supposedly engaged in by the Van Dams.</TE>
<TE>   "The media in this community cannot exercise restraint, in my
humble opinion," the judge said.</TE>

<HD>Ventura Council OKs Year-Round Homeless Shelter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ventura City Council has approved a proposal for what will be the
city's only permanent, year-round shelter for the homeless--but it
could still be years before the shelter becomes a reality.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously, we are very pleased and are looking forward to moving
ahead with the project," said Richard Pearson, executive director of
Project Understanding, the faith-based nonprofit organization that
proposed the shelter.</LD>
<LD>   Councilmen Neal Andrews, Sandy E. Smith, James J. Friedman, James
L. Monahan and Carl E. Morehouse and Mayor Ray DiGuilio voted in
favor of the proposal; Deputy Mayor Brian Brennan was absent.</LD>
<TE>   The city has twice rejected earlier versions of the proposal,
which has been in the works for three years. The council approval now
paves the way for the county to consider the plan. If the county
approves it as well, the proposal and grant request will be submitted
to the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development for
consideration.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been some pain getting to this point, but I think we
have a much better product," DiGuilio said. "Now we are ready to
start."</TE>
<TE>   At Monday's meeting, about 40 people stood in support of the
shelter, drawing applause from the council. Representatives from
other social service agencies, including Catholic Charities, spoke in
support of the homeless center.</TE>
<TE>   Plans for the shelter include emergency and transitional housing
and other services for the homeless, including help in finding
permanent housing. Pearson estimates there are 2,000 to 4,000
homeless men, women and children in the county.</TE>
<TE>   The only concerns raised by the council were over deadlines. The
city is requiring that a site for the shelter be acquired within a
year. Forty-five days after that, Project Understanding must submit a
funding plan for operation of the center and show that it has made
agreements with other social service providers.</TE>
<TE>   But those requirements shouldn't pose any problems, Pearson said.</TE>
<TE>   "To a large degree, those things are site-contingent," he said.
"We've been in conversations with [service providers] for years.
Before they make an agreement, they want to know where the shelter is
going to be."</TE>
<TE>   He also pointed out that many grants require that a site be
identified before a funding request is made. The HUD grant is one of
the few that don't, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Brown, Ventura's community services manager, will head the
city's site search committee, which will be formed after May 15. City
staff then will put together a team of community members to generate
criteria for the site and discuss possible locations. The city staff
will serve as facilitators, Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   "We want this to be a 100% community-driven process," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pearson and city officials said they hope the process will take
less than a year.</TE>

<HD>Donations to Maintain K-3 Class-Size Limits in Irvine</HD>
<DH>Education: Campaign to narrow district's budget gap nets
$1.3 million. Teachers will still be cut.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Private donations totaling $1.3 million to Irvine schools will ensure
small classes in kindergarten through third grade next year and save
other programs, but dozens of teachers will lose their jobs to budget
cuts, school officials said Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   "The fact that people have been able to go out and raise this kind
of money in this short period of time is miraculous," said Patricia
Clark White, superintendent of the Irvine Unified School District.</LD>
<LD>   Facing a $5.2-million budget shortfall, the district's trustees in
January announced plans to drop the state-sponsored program that
limits class size to 20 students in kindergarten through third grade.</LD>
<TE>   School districts across California are facing similar financial
crises, largely due to a $12.5-billion deficit in the state budget.
But in Irvine a three-month fund-raising campaign by parents and the
Irvine Public Schools Foundation brought in $1.3 million--enough to
save the class-size limit, said Tim Shaw, executive director of the
foundation.</TE>
<TE>   A sixth-grade science program and art classes in grades four
through six also may be saved, though the board did not vote on that
issue Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   But trustees said 15 special-education instructors, 60 athletic
coaches, four high school counselors, four district nurses and art
programs in kindergarten through third grade will be cut--measures
that will save the district at least $2 million. Officials sent
preliminary layoff notices to 130 teachers in March and had been
poised Tuesday to eliminate another 50 positions had small class
sizes been abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   More than 200 teachers rallied outside the district's headquarters
Tuesday night, waving signs that read, "Irvine teachers are worth
more than zero." Inside the boardroom, teachers spoke out against
contract negotiations that so far would not include a pay increase.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the general mood was upbeat. The board's approval of
funding to keep small classes drew cheers and loud, long applause
from teachers and parents. Trustee Margie Wakeham told the audience:
"I really didn't think there would be this much money, and I have to
give you a ton of credit for going out there and beating the bushes."</TE>
<TE>   Contributions came from scores of parents, as well as local
businesses and the city.</TE>
<TE>   "One mother called and said, 'I don't have a job, but can I send
you money in two weeks?'" said parent Lita Robinow, who organized a
fund-raiser in February that brought in $106,000. "People from the
most affluent families to the least affluent contributed."</TE>
<TE>   To save class-size reduction, the district needed $1.43 million,
of which $500,000 would come from the state. Since February, the
foundation has raised the remaining $930,000, nearly half of that
from parents.</TE>
<TE>   Contributions from the Donald Bren Foundation, Taco Bell and the
Irvine Ranch Water District saved the science program and part of the
art program--pending board approval--at least for one more school
year.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a Band-Aid," Robinow said. "It doesn't nearly address the
problems that the district has, and we need a long-term solution from
Sacramento, Washington, and we need some kind of a parcel tax. You
can't fight this problem with individual donations every year."</TE>
<TE>   Private funds have bailed out district programs before. Donations
totaling more than $2 million by the Irvine Co. and the Bren
Foundation rescued art, music and science programs in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Said Jerry Amante, president of the Irvine Public Schools
Foundation: "We keep spitting at this forest fire with one-time
donations."</TE>

<HD>Kevyn Aucoin, 40; Celebrity Makeup Artist and Author</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOOTH MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Makeup artist Kevyn Aucoin, who made up some of the most beautiful
faces in Hollywood and then put his techniques in the hands of
millions of women through best-selling books, TV appearances and a
magazine column, died Tuesday at Westchester Medical Center in New
York from complications relating to a pituitary brain tumor. He was
40.</LD>
<LD>   Gwyneth Paltrow, Nicole Kidman, Julia Roberts, Barbra Streisand
and Jennifer Lopez--to name a few--trusted Aucoin to make them look
their best. Commanding up to $6,000 a day for his services, he was
booked months in advance for awards shows.</LD>
<LD>   "Kevyn was a true artist and a loving and special friend," pop
singer Janet Jackson said Tuesday of Aucoin, who worked with her on
album covers, magazine shoots and concert tours. "Through his craft,
he wanted to open the hearts and minds of all people, regardless of
race or sexual preference."</LD>
<TE>   His work graced countless fashion magazines and designer runways,
and he wrote best-selling beauty books "The Art of Makeup" (Harper
Collins, 1994), "Making Faces" (Little, Brown, 1997) and "Face
Forward" (Little, Brown, 2000) and wrote a monthly column for Allure,
a beauty magazine.</TE>
<TE>   He viewed makeup as enhancement, not ornament, and refused to tout
one product as a "must-have," saying that the strategy was just a
ploy by the cosmetics industry to get women to spend money.</TE>
<TE>   "His importance to the beauty industry cannot be overstated,"
Vogue beauty director Amy Astley said from New York.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea of a celebrity makeup artist crystallized with him.
There were others before him like Max Factor, but he was the
ultimate. No one did it better and no one ever will. His clients were
the starriest stars and he had a rapport with them that is
unparalleled in his field. They trusted him and they loved him."</TE>
<TE>   But even as he hobnobbed with supermodels, rock stars and
celebrities, Aucoin embraced the beauty in everyday women. He
appeared on "The Today Show" and "The Oprah Winfrey Show," teaching
women how to enhance their inner beauty.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I could get on a bus and tour America because I love women
and I would love to be able to do that," he told The Times in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   In his books, he demonstrated how a celebrity could be transformed
into another familiar face--he turned Lisa Marie Presley into Marilyn
Monroe. He also performed makeovers on average women--secretaries,
friends and family. "He fulfilled in the faces of women their fondest
dreams for themselves," photographer Irving Penn said from his studio
in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his career, Aucoin tried to promote individuality and a
feminist viewpoint within a field notorious for imposing a uniform
standard of beauty. In 1984, he helped create the shades for The
Nakeds, a pioneering neutral color collection based on skin tones and
launched by Revlon's Ultima II.</TE>
<TE>   "It may not seem like it, but it was a powerful moment. Before,
there were makeup lines for white women and others for black women.
But he worked to design makeup for all skin tones. The idea was to
empower a woman by revealing her natural beauty, and not to cover her
up with layers of product," Allure editor-in-chief Linda Wells said
from New York. "His biggest influence was his celebration of
individual attractiveness and the quirks and imperfections that make
people different."</TE>
<TE>   Described by friends as "teddy bear-like," the 6-foot, 4-inch
Aucoin was outspoken about gay rights, gun control and race
relations. He told Time magazine in October 2000, "If all it says on
my gravestone is 'DID GOOD LIPSTICK,' I'd rather it say nothing at
all."</TE>
<TE>   Aucoin was as surprised as anyone about his fame and fortune, and
was fond of saying, "I'm just a kid from Louisiana." He was born on
Valentine's Day 1962 in Shreveport and adopted a month later by a
family who raised him and three other adopted siblings in Lafayette.</TE>
<TE>   He realized at an early age that he was gay, and his childhood was
traumatic as a result. He took refuge in fashion magazines, spending
hours making up his younger sister Carla to look like a model.</TE>
<TE>   At 15, he dropped out of high school after two classmates tried to
run him over with a car. In 1983, he moved to New York City and
enrolled in beauty school. Within a year, he was hired by
photographer Steven Meisel to work with Meg Tilly on a Vogue shoot.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, he was a legend in the industry, working with
models such as Cindy Crawford and Kate Moss and celebrities including
Tina Turner and Cher. During the 1990s, when peers such as Vincent
Longo and Laura Mercier were launching their own makeup lines, he
resisted, saying that he didn't want to lend his name to a major
cosmetics company that would only offer him 5% of the profits.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, he launched a Web site--kevynaucoin.com--that features
a personal profile and photos as well as makeup tips. His newest
project was a line of beauty products, the Kevyn Aucoin Collection,
which he was launching on the Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "In typical Kevyn fashion, he was doing it his own way," said
Vogue's Astley. "He was a brand and he was only going to get bigger
and bigger."</TE>
<TE>   Aucoin is survived by his partner, Jeremy Antunes; parents Thelma
S. and Isidore A. Aucoin Jr.; brother Keith; and sisters Carla and
Kim. Funeral arrangements are pending.</TE>
<TE>   Donations can be made to the Hetrick Martin Institute, a New York
center for gay youth, at www.hmi.org on the Internet.</TE>

<HD>Spelling Out a Graduation Plan</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The final bell rang at Grant High School in the San Fernando Valley
and students came like salmon through the iron gates out front, where
the sign says, "What we are to be, we are now becoming."</LD>
<LD>   The thing some students are becoming is agitated. They are worked
up about a policy that says if they don't commit to college, a trade
school or the military, they will not be allowed to attend their high
school graduation ceremony.</LD>
<LD>   Senior Nuritza Sarkisian is going to UC Riverside in the fall, but
she still has a problem with the policy, which requires students at
eight high schools in District C of L.A. Unified to fill out a form
detailing their plan.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not right," Sarkisian said. "If you finish all your
requirements, you should be allowed to go to the ceremony."</TE>
<TE>   Hilda Santacruz and Jennifer Lopez, two more seniors, said some
students have to work and save money before they can even consider
college. Hilda, who works as a sales clerk at a shopping mall to help
pay her family's bills, plans to work full-time when she graduates so
she can help out even more.</TE>
<TE>   On the District C Web site, where the policy is posted, work is
not an acceptable post-graduation plan. "Work doesn't mean that
education comes to a stop," reads the manifesto.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sad. I'm going to talk to my family about it tonight," Hilda
said of not being allowed the satisfaction of walking across the
stage, in her family's presence, to take the diploma in her hand.</TE>
<TE>   "Sad" does not begin to describe it. Draconian, kooky and
capricious come closer.</TE>
<TE>   An embarrassing percentage of students are dropouts in Los
Angeles. Why punish the ones who crack the books and earn the
credits, just because they aren't headed for UCLA or to the front
lines of the next war?</TE>
<TE>   "In many cases, these students are the first in their family's
history to earn a diploma," said parent Shelley LaFleur, a
documentary producer who was livid and has been demanding
explanations from district administrators. "We ought to say, 'Way to
go,' and let them appreciate the accomplishment."</TE>
<TE>   LaFleur's daughter is college-bound, but LaFleur said college and
the military just aren't for everybody, and shouldn't be a
prerequisite for participating in a rite of passage.</TE>
<TE>   My thoughts precisely, and so I called the school official who
initiated the policy to see what he could come up with in his own
defense.</TE>
<TE>   District C Supt. Robert Collins told me he first used the
"post-secondary commitment program" in 1987, when he was principal of
Grant High. He suggested that ill-informed people like me are missing
the point, which is to ensure that students become productive
citizens rather than flops and flameouts.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody has complained, Collins said, except well-off do-gooders
whose kids are headed for the best schools in the country but think
it's a crime he's challenging the children of low-income families to
do the same.</TE>
<TE>   Look, he said, school is all about rules. Getting to class on
time, turning in your homework, keeping quiet.</TE>
<TE>   This is just one more rule, he said, and the result is that many
more students have committed to college this year than last.</TE>
<TE>   That is promising, even if it's too soon to know whether students
have lied or produced phony documents to satisfy the requirement.</TE>
<TE>   Look, nobody with a pulse would fault Collins for encouraging
students to shoot for the moon. Of course we want more of them going
to college and making a contribution. But do we want to blackmail
them or inspire them?</TE>
<TE>   Denying a student the small pleasure of wearing the robe and
strutting across the stage is cruel and unusual, I told Collins.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you want to know what's really cruel?" he countered. "To give
a youngster a diploma, but you don't talk to him, you don't counsel
him, you don't care about him, you don't have high expectations for
him, and you turn your back when he leaves school."</TE>
<TE>   All he's requiring, Collins said, is that every student sit down
with a counselor beginning junior year to start discussing goals and
strategies.</TE>
<TE>   Well excuse me, but that ought to be standard procedure, not the
result of some special doctrine. Yeah, Collins said, but it doesn't
happen often enough.</TE>
<TE>   "If you sent your child to a private school for $15,000 a year and
got no counseling, and when your child graduated, the school just
said, 'Good luck,' you'd be outraged," Collins said. "I don't think
you should expect anything less from public schools.</TE>
<TE>   "What happens to the 40% of students who don't have any idea what
to do when they get their diploma? What responsibility does the
school have to them and to their parents? What is the impact on the
economy of Los Angeles when we produce youngsters who go into jobs
that guarantee a lifetime at poverty-level earnings?"</TE>
<TE>   So he's a tough guy, yeah, but maybe Collins isn't quite the
eight-ball we might have imagined. The no-graduation-ceremony policy,
it turns out, is little more than a prod. Collins probably isn't
going to turn away any student who's earned a walk across that stage.</TE>
<TE>   When I described senior Hilda Santacruz's family obligations,
Collins said he'd like to sit down with her. Maybe, when she
graduates, there's a way Hilda can help her family while taking
classes. He just wants to make her aware of her options, Collins
said, and then Hilda can walk across the stage and collect her
diploma.</TE>
<TE>   When I asked about a student who might want to take time off and
see the world before deciding on his or her place in it, Collins
said, "That's an acceptable plan." He'd like to at least offer the
student some guidance, and maybe a reading list. (Sounds like he must
have been every kid's nightmare when he was principal.) If the
student puts a plan in writing, Collins said, then, yes, he or she
can wear the robe and the mortarboard.</TE>
<TE>   Sounds fair to me. But either Collins puts this in writing, or I'm
going to have to suggest he not be allowed to walk across the stage
at retirement to collect his wristwatch.</TE>

<LD>A rapist linked by the state DNA database to separate attacks two
weeks apart in Mission Viejo was sentenced Tuesday to 55 years in
prison.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge John Ryan handed down the maximum term for
Daniel Metzler, 40, who was convicted March 4 of sexually assaulting
a 16-year-old girl and a 21-year-old woman in July 1992, after
Metzler got out of prison for a Riverside County rape in 1983.</LD>

whether a decades-old permit still allows motocross riding at
Santiago Reservoir.</LD>
<LD>   Saddleback Motorsports Partners LLC, which has threatened to sue
the county, says it has a right to operate the motocross park because
of a broadly written conditional use permit dating from 1941.</LD>

permits.</LD>

<HD>Ex-Compton Mayor Awarded $678,572</HD>
<DH>Court: Judge withholds payment of legal fees to Omar
Bradley, however, until a higher court reviews her decision.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAREN BRISCOE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge Tuesday awarded former Compton Mayor Omar Bradley $678,572 in
legal fees. But in the next breath, she postponed payment of the
award until it is reviewed by a higher court--the same court that
blocked her earlier decision declaring Bradley mayor.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Judith Chirlin ruled in Bradley's favor in a
contested election last June, but did not at the time order the city
to pay his legal fees.</LD>
<LD>   "I want to make sure that this order sends a clear message to the
Court of Appeal that I'm making a determination that Bradley was the
successful party," Chirlin said, explaining her ruling to a host of
attorneys. "But I don't want [the award] paid until the appeals court
has had an opportunity to review and rule on the merits of the case."</LD>
<TE>   Though the ruling clarified Chirlin's position on who should pay
Bradley's legal bills, it further clouds the ultimate outcome of an
election contest now in its eighth month.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley, a two-term incumbent, was outpolled by Eric Perrodin in
June, but contested the election. Chirlin reversed Bradley's loss in
February, citing ballot irregularities and other problems.</TE>
<TE>   Days later, the state's 2nd District Court of Appeal stayed
Chirlin's ruling and reinstated Perrodin, pending a final outcome of
the case.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours of that stay, the Compton City Council, which has
three members aligned with Bradley, voted to reimburse Bradley for
nearly $1 million in legal fees.</TE>
<TE>   The council's vote sparked a lawsuit by a Compton resident,
Margaret Mitchell, seeking to block payment of those fees.</TE>
<TE>   That suit prompted Tuesday's hearing in downtown Superior Court,
where Mitchell's attorney appeared before Chirlin, along with lawyers
for Bradley, Perrodin, Councilwoman Melanie Andrews and the city of
Compton, each seeking a ruling tailored to their client's interests.</TE>
<TE>   Frederic Woocher, Perrodin's attorney, asked Chirlin not to award
any fees before a final ruling from the appeals court on whether
Perrodin or Bradley is mayor.</TE>
<TE>   "The City Council is champing at the bit to pay the money [to
Bradley]," Woocher said. "The fix is in."</TE>
<TE>   Bradley Hertz, Omar Bradley's attorney, sought an outright award
of the fees he incurred trying to reclaim the mayor's office,
mentioning "private school bills" among other reasons. He also urged
Chirlin to exclude Mitchell's attorney from intervening in the
appellate process.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think Margaret Mitchell as a private citizen has standing
to intervene," he said. "They don't have a seat at the table." The
judge declined his request.</TE>
<TE>   The increasingly convoluted case has even election-law specialists
scratching their heads; at one point the opposing attorneys huddled
to try to interpret a section of the state's elections code.</TE>
<TE>   Woocher called the case "tremendously complicated."</TE>
<TE>   "You've got a city here that is not defending itself against
charges because new people have taken over and switched positions,
and you have a court of appeal that has told the trial court judge
she may have been wrong, and yet she's still making rulings," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Andrews, who supports paying Bradley's legal bills,
forcefully denied that the "fix was in" to pay Bradley's fees. She
said that under normal circumstances, the City Council would
approve--and the city attorney then review--such payments.</TE>
<TE>   But in this case, Andrews said, the city attorney never got that
chance because of the legal wrangling between Perrodin and Bradley.</TE>
<TE>   If the usual process had been followed, she told the judge, the
city attorney might have recommended paying Bradley's attorney less
than he stands to gain now.</TE>
<TE>   Andrews also noted that Compton had spent more than $1 million
defending Perrodin against Bradley's election challenge.</TE>
<TE>   If people found fault with spending public money to defend
Bradley, they should also object to spending public funds on
Perrodin, she argued, with a reference to George Orwell's "Animal
Farm."</TE>
<TE>   "It appears that all pigs are equal," she said. "But some are more
equal than others."</TE>
<TE>   Involved attorneys estimate the appellate court will hear the case
in three to four months.</TE>

<LD>Acluttered wallet can be such a nuisance. Take the suspected car
thief who was stopped by a sheriff's deputy in Paramount. When the
guy handed over his driver's license, the deputy noticed something
was stuck to the back of it. And it was "not the noble organ-donor
sticker," reported the city's newsletter, "but a small baggie of
cocaine."</LD>
<LD>   More oh-so-grand auto theft stories: Deputies left the car keys in
an unlocked car in Paramount hoping to lure a villain into showing
himself in a neighborhood that had experienced several car thefts.
However, the bait car operation was foiled when a resident spotted a
man getting into the car and chased him off, yelling, "Get away from
that car! That's not your car!"</LD>
<LD>   In a separate case, a man arrested on suspicion of driving a
stolen car told deputies he wasn't stealing it. He was only moving
it.</LD>
<TE>   Mother's Day note: A Long Beach store specializing in "culinary
style and function" had a not-so-tender gift suggestion (see
accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   I know some moms who might use it as a club on the noggin of the
giver.</TE>
<TE>   Not a Mother's Day note: Harry Hultine of La Canada Flintridge and
several other readers sent along a sign that acquired new meaning
with the loss of one letter (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Definitely not a Mother's Day note! Tom Beckett of Ojai saw an ad
for a job opening with a risque implication (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Sobering experience? The Saddleback Valley News police log listed
this 1:24 a.m. report from a Lake Forest resident on Avalon Street:
"Informant states that a man just jumped over the informant's fence
and fell into his pool and is now walking on Avalon soaking wet."</TE>
<TE>   California SLIM: Pamela Saffire of Sherman Oaks noticed that two
reimbursement checks received by her company were from "SLIM Workers'
Compensation Trust Account." No, it's not another Southern California

<TE>   Flushed with excitement: San Juan Capistrano-based Fluidmaster, a
maker of toilet repair kits, offers $100 each month for a "winning
toilet tale." The latest prize went to Natha Landers, who told this
story: "I have two Persian cats who are in love with the magic of
flushing. Every time they hear the toilet's flush, they dash into the
bathroom, peer into the bowl and watch as the water swirls away and
continue watching as it refills."</TE>
<TE>   Landers added: "If only they would learn to use the toilet instead
of the litter box, I would happily dash into the bathroom to flush
for them."</TE>
<TE>   I have a suggestion: Try forbidding them to use the toilet. Being
cats, they're sure to disobey.</TE>

<TE>   miscelLAny: The other day, I said that Alfred Hitchcock's writers
had never thought of a scenario as wild as the experience of a Los
Alamitos man whose windshield was cracked when a crow dropped a steak
bone on it. Well, that's obvious, Don Burke points out. After all,
the bone didn't hit the driver's "Rear Window." And it's unlikely the
crow suffered an attack of "Vertigo." On the other hand, crows in my
neighborhood are "Notorious" for their brazen behavior.</TE>

<HD>Tech Czar Pleads Ignorance on Oracle Pact</HD>
<DH>Hearing: A legislator investigating the $95-million
software deal calls the suspended official's testimony inconsistent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>In sometimes tearful testimony that lawmakers called inconsistent,
the suspended director of the state Department of Information
Technology said he was "out of the loop" on many aspects of the
state's $95-million Oracle Corp. software contract.</LD>
<LD>   In an evening round of Monday's legislative inquiry that stretched
until early Tuesday morning, Director Elias Cortez blamed other
departments for failing to check out contract details, expressed
ignorance about the contract's complicated financing and was overcome
with tears when asked to describe how he had been suspended last week
by Gov. Gray Davis.</LD>
<LD>   Although e-mails and the testimony of other state officials
portray Cortez as a promoter of the unusual volume-licensing Oracle
contract, Cortez expressed ignorance of key aspects. He told
lawmakers as he leafed through documents at the hearing, "This is the
first time I've ever seen this contract."</LD>
<TE>   Members of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee said they were
skeptical of Cortez's answers.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the reason why there's suspicion is that your answers
haven't always been consistent," Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) told
Cortez as the hearing ended at 1:30 a.m. "Some of what you've said
today doesn't match up exactly.</TE>
<TE>   "I would hope," Peace said, "that between now and Monday you get
your story straight."</TE>
<TE>   Hearings resume Monday with witnesses that include Department of
General Services officials who helped negotiate the contract and a
Department of Finance analyst who warned against it.</TE>
<TE>   Cortez was suspended Thursday, the same day that Davis sent
California Highway Patrol officers to Department of Information
Technology headquarters based on an anonymous tip about document
shredding.</TE>
<TE>   Cortez denied that he shredded or ordered any documents destroyed.
He said he got the call from Davis' chief of staff that he had been
suspended with pay--$123,000 a year--as he was getting a heart test
at his doctor's office.</TE>
<TE>   The Oracle contract, signed by the Department of General Services
last May 31, was initially hailed as an innovative way to save the
state more than $100 million on purchases of computer database
software. The deal authorizes the state to use many kinds of Oracle
software for many users at once.</TE>
<TE>   In a highly critical report issued last month, the state auditor
concluded that the contract could cost the state $6 million to $41
million more than it would spend otherwise. The audit described a
lack of scrutiny as the no-bid contract was rushed through the state
bureaucracy to meet an Oracle-imposed deadline.</TE>
<TE>   There are strong political overtones to the flap. Oracle gave the
Democratic governor a $25,000 contribution days after the contract
was signed. Davis has said he had no knowledge of the contract, but
his deputy chief of staff, Susan Kennedy, approved a summary of the
contract.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the Legislative Audit Committee questioned Davis staff
member Kari Dohn about May 23 e-mails among Department of Finance
employees regarding Dohn's need for more contract information so she
could explain it to the governor.</TE>
<TE>   Dohn told lawmakers that she never briefed the governor about the
deal, and that Arun Baheti, the governor's director of e-government,
told her he would take the lead on the Oracle agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Baheti resigned last week after acknowledging that he had accepted
the $25,000 check from an Oracle lobbyist in a downtown Sacramento
restaurant, a violation of the governor's rule that staffers avoid
political fund-raising. Department of General Services Director Barry
Keene resigned April 26, saying he made "a poor decision" in backing
the contract.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference in Santa Barbara on Tuesday, Republican
candidate for governor Bill Simon Jr. called on Davis to terminate
Cortez.</TE>
<TE>   "What is clear is that this scandal goes right into the governor's
office and directly involves the governor's most senior advisors and
appointees," Simon said. "What is equally clear is that additional
hearings are necessary and that the Legislature and other law
enforcement entities should leave no stone unturned."</TE>
<TE>   Some of Cortez's testimony was challenged Tuesday by others
familiar with his department.</TE>
<TE>   Under questioning by lawmakers, Cortez said that when he was hired
by Davis to run the department in February 1999 he reported to Vince
Hall, the governor's staff director, and to David Lema, a private
consultant hired to help the state adjust its computer systems for
the year 2000 calendar change.</TE>
<TE>   Cortez said that in late 1999, he learned that Lema and Hall were
starting a private technology business together. Cortez said he had
ethical concerns about the arrangement, so he asked Lema to move out
of the department's headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   But Cortez did not cancel Lema's contract, he said, because he
needed his Y2K expertise.</TE>
<TE>   Both Lema and Hall, a Democrat running for the Assembly in San
Diego County, disputed Cortez's testimony. They said Lema left the
department's offices because there wasn't enough room.</TE>
<TE>   Hall formed a dot-com business after he quit Davis' staff in
November 1999, he said. Lema became an unpaid advisor to the company
after his consulting contract with the state ended in January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Hall dissolved the company in late 2001, he said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bernard "Bunni" Goldstein, 89, one of the five brothers who founded
the grocery chain known as the Boys' Markets, died Thursday in Los
Angeles of causes associated with aging.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Ipswich, Mass., he grew up in the Boyle Heights area of
East Los Angeles with his siblings and their widowed mother. To
support the family, the brothers began selling oranges from a corner
stand and peddling groceries door-to-door from a pushcart.</LD>
<LD>   Goldstein was still literally a "boy" when older brothers Joseph,
Max and Edward started the first grocery store on Telegraph Road in
1924. Neighbors began referring to the shop as "the Boys' Market,"
and the name stuck. A second store was opened in 1931, and by the
time the family sold the chain in 1986, they owned 45 stores.</LD>
<TE>   Goldstein dropped out of high school at 16 to work full time in
the store. During the Depression, working up to 20 hours a day, he
often sacked out on sugar sacks in the back room.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>William Heyes Jr., 78, child actor in the silent "Penrod and Sam"
series, died Friday in Raleigh, N.C., after a long illness.</LD>
<LD>   Show business approached the New Bedford, Mass., lad when he was
7. Because he looked like the comic character Skippy, he was asked to
audition for a movie of that title. Jackie Cooper got the role, but
Heyes landed a two-year movie career anyway. After starring as
Penrod, in 1932 he played opposite Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle in
Arbuckle's first talkie, "Hey, Pop." Heyes' experience has been
incorporated into a recently published children's book.</LD>
<LD>   After serving in the Army during World War II, Heyes settled in
Los Angeles, studied engineering at USC and worked in the aerospace
industry. He was involved in community theater, and the Masquers Club
in Hollywood, performing in such plays as "Twelve Angry Men" and
"Harvey."</LD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul W. Klipsch, 98, who pioneered high-quality audio systems, died
Sunday of causes related to aging. He died in Hope, Ark., where he
founded his company, Klipsch Audio Technologies, in 1946.</LD>
<LD>   Klipsch, a native of Elkhart, Ind., was the son of a mechanical
engineer and became intrigued with audio when his mother moved the
family phonograph into a corner, unexpectedly improving the sound. He
built his first speaker at 15. He graduated from New Mexico State
University, now home to the Klipsch School of Electrical &amp; Computer
Engineering, and earned a master's degree at Stanford.</LD>
<LD>   He designed radios and maintained electric locomotives in Chile
for General Electric and worked briefly in Texas as an oil company
geophysicist. Klipsch discovered Hope, President Clinton's boyhood
home, when he was stationed in the area during World War II.</LD>
<TE>   After the war, the former lieutenant colonel remained there and
bought a building to manufacture the folded corner woofer he invented
and called the Klipschorn. Klipsch's original building in Hope is now
the Klipsch Museum of Audio History.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If anybody on God's green and just Earth deserves a great big "I told
you so," it's a 40-year-old Los Angeles medical assistant named Rita
Milla.</LD>
<LD>   Eighteen years ago, she sued Los Angeles' Roman Catholic
Archdiocese and seven of its priests. As a girl of 16, she said, she
had been seduced by the seven, impregnated and sent off by the
priests to their home country, the Philippines, to have the baby in
secret.</LD>
<LD>   There were lewd jokes aplenty then, about Snow White and the Seven
Priests, and the Philippines' top prelate, who really was named
Cardinal Sin ("Forgive me, Sin, for I have fathered").</LD>
<TE>   People wrote off Rita as an unbalanced young woman dwelling in
fantasy. A bishop said publicly that she had "a bad reputation." She
sued him for slander. A colleague and I who reported Rita's story
were scolded from the pulpit by then-Cardinal Timothy Manning. Rita's
suit was dismissed because it was filed too late, and because of the
archdiocese's claim that it wasn't responsible for its priests'
misbehavior. The priests themselves had conveniently vanished. End of
story.</TE>
<TE>   Seven years later, my phone rang. A feeble voice: "Patt? This is
Father Tamayo." He was dying and wanted the truth known, and the
truth was, Rita was right. There was more: letters on archdiocese
letterhead, sent to Tamayo in the Philippines, where the priests had
gone to ground. In a letter written by a church official and CCed to
Manning, Tamayo was advised not to reveal he was being paid by the
archdiocese unless questioned under oath. A salary check for $375 was
enclosed.</TE>
<TE>   And when Tamayo asked to return to L.A., another letter advised
him to stay put. When he came back anyway, yet another letter told
him that "there has been no change in the situation" which could
"open old wounds and further hurt anyone concerned, including the
Archdiocese."</TE>
<TE>   The day my story ran, Tamayo apologized publicly to Rita in the
conference room of Gloria Allred's law office. It was a brief, local
story and nothing more.</TE>
<TE>   Now this week, in the very same conference room, Allred and Rita
and that baby, now a 19-year-old named Jacqueline, asked Cardinal
Roger M. Mahony to help the girl find out which priest was her
father. This time, I counted a score of reporters and 14 news
cameras. Why now? Why not then?</TE>
<TE>   The difference is that now there's a critical mass--scores of
lawsuits, hundreds of victims, men and boys and their families--and a
critical press covering a nationwide scandal about dozens of sexual
abuse charges, not just one forlorn girl.</TE>
<TE>   So these things snowball. A month ago, I wrote a column about a
man who picketed the Gardena parochial school where he says he was
molested as a boy, and I mentioned Rita Milla's case. A CBS News
producer named Barbara Pierce contacted me about Rita, interviewed
her and put her story on the air. Then, the letters Tamayo showed me
were cited in a priest-sex abuse lawsuit filed 10 days ago ... all of
which brought us this week to the cream-colored conference table in
Allred's offices.</TE>
<TE>   And this time, nobody was making any jokes. No one is singling out
the Catholic Church any more than Enron or Arthur Andersen was
singled out. In every case, people's trust was betrayed. An
institution entrusted with people's souls is no more exempt than an
institution entrusted with people's money--perhaps less so.</TE>
<TE>   It's not only that priests evidently molested adolescents; it's
that their superiors sometimes knew, and moved priests around in a
shell game to protect priests and church--at the same time the church
argued, as it did in L.A., that it wasn't liable for priests'
misdeeds.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't wash. Fortune 500 companies and lesser corporate fish
with policies against, say, sexual harassment, still have found
themselves writing big checks and making amends when their employees
violate those codes, sometimes repeatedly.</TE>
<TE>   The civil version of federal racketeering charges, RICO, the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, was part of the
recent lawsuit against the archdiocese. That puts the church in the
undistinguished RICO company of junk bond kings, mobsters, even the
Orange County bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   That suit says Mahony was in the loop, practicing "a pattern of
concealment, deception," promising to get rid of a problem priest but
doing nothing for years</TE>
<TE>   In Rita's case, Mahony became archbishop the year after her
lawsuit was filed and he was sent a copy of the letter urging Tamayo
to go back to the Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   In Enron, in Arthur Andersen, it's the big guys who have to answer
the big questions, and so they should here.</TE>
<TE>   The story is that Congress named the RICO law after Edward G.
Robinson's mobster character in "Little Caesar," who, as he is gunned
down in the street, wails, "Mother of Mercy, is this the end of
Rico?"</TE>
<TE>   Mother of Mercy, we can certainly hope so.</TE>

<DH>Law: State court's chief enters debate over jurist who
lessened Anaheim child-abuse charge.</DH>

<LD>The California Supreme Court's chief justice has called for an
evaluation of an Orange County judge after he reduced charges against
an Anaheim father who burned his 5-year-old son's hand on a gas flame
for stealing gum, officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Justice Ronald M. George has called on the presiding judge
in Orange County to evaluate Judge James O. Perez in the wake of
media reports about the case, said Lynn Holton, press officer for the
state Supreme Court.</LD>
<LD>   Perez is one of hundreds of retired judges whom George taps each
year to return to work to help with the state court caseload.</LD>
<TE>   Perez, 76, reduced the charges against the father from a felony to
a misdemeanor, sentencing him to probation and a $100 fine. If the
felony charges had remained, the father could have faced up to six
years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   In his ruling, Perez cited the "customs and habits" of the father,
a Guatemalan immigrant who said his mother disciplined him in a
similar fashion when he was a child.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor in the case and child-abuse prevention advocates
criticized the judge's handling of the matter, saying Perez appeared
to protect the abuser rather than the victim.</TE>
<TE>   But the judge's supporters, including many lawyers in the public
defender's office, contend that the judge has been unfairly
criticized and that the sentence showed compassion and restraint
toward a father who had no criminal record and was trying to keep his
son on the straight and narrow.</TE>
<TE>   George periodically requests evaluations of retired judges in
deciding which assignments to give them, Holton said.</TE>
<TE>   Perez, the first Spanish-speaking judge in Orange County and a
popular figure in the Fullerton courthouse, is not scheduled to work
for the next month.</TE>
<TE>   Perez could not be reached for comment Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The case surrounds a New Year's Day shopping trip during which
Wellington Soto caught his son stealing a package of gum. The father
took the boy home, placed his hand on a gas stove and turned on the
flame.</TE>
<TE>   The father did not seek medical attention for his son but instead
treated the burns with antibacterial ointment and bandages. After his
arrest, the father attended counseling at the suggestion of social
workers, his lawyer said. He will continue counseling as part of his
probation.</TE>

<LD>The California Supreme Court's chief justice has called for an

an Anaheim father who burned his 5-year-old son's hand on a gas flame
for stealing gum, officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Justice Ronald M. George has called on the presiding judge

<TE>   Perez, 76, reduced the charges against the father from a felony to

<TE>   In his ruling, Perez cited the "customs and habits" of the father,

<TE>   The prosecutor in the case and child-abuse prevention advocates

<TE>   But the judge's supporters, including many lawyers in the public

<TE>   George periodically requests evaluations of retired judges in
deciding which assignments to give them, Holton said.</TE>
<TE>   Perez, the first Spanish-speaking judge in Orange County and a
popular figure in the Fullerton courthouse, is not scheduled to work
for the next month. As a retired judge, Perez does not need to run
for reelection. He sits in retirement solely at the discretion of the
chief justice and earns a prorated daily salary on top of his
pension.</TE>
<TE>   Perez could not be reached for comment Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The case surrounds a New Year's Day shopping trip during which
Wellington Soto caught his son stealing a package of gum. As
punishment, the father took the boy home, placed his hand on a gas
stove and turned on the flame.</TE>
<TE>   The father did not seek medical attention for his son but instead
treated the burns with antibacterial ointment and bandages. A teacher
later noticed the wound and school officials called authorities.
After his arrest, the father attended counseling at the suggestion of
social workers, his lawyer said. He will continue counseling as part
of his probation.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Karen Schatzle, who prosecuted the case,
declined to comment on the chief justice's decision. She argued
during the hearing that the father's actions warranted a felony
charge.</TE>
<TE>   But the judge replied that the conduct was mitigated in part
because the father had the good intentions of teaching a lesson.</TE>
<TE>   "I dare say that we've done two things: Hopefully, the child has
learned a lesson and, hopefully, senior has learned a lesson," the
judge said.</TE>
<TE>   Perez, a veteran of World War II, served as an Orange County judge
from 1966 until his retirement 15 years ago.</TE>

<HD>Pomeroy's Style Stayed Unchanged</HD>
<DH>LAPD: Though he revealed little, interim chief's colleagues
describe him as competent, poker-faced and cautious.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"So vanilla" is how Martin Pomeroy described himself in interviews
Tuesday, shortly after being sworn in as the Los Angeles Police
Department's 53rd chief.</LD>
<LD>   "You know, I was married in June of 1968 and then I entered the
police academy in 1969, and from those dates forward, my life was
just family and the LAPD," Pomeroy said, shrugging, when asked to
talk about his background.</LD>
<LD>   Interviews with colleagues and former underlings of Pomeroy on
Tuesday revealed a strikingly consistent portrait of a classical LAPD
commander--competent, poker-faced and cautious.</LD>
<TE>   Pomeroy's style has remained unchanged from his earliest days with
the LAPD, said longtime colleague Garrett Zimmon, a retired LAPD
commander who is now chief of the San Bernardino police. "He is very
principled, hard-working and ethical," Zimmon said. "People trust
him; they follow him willingly."</TE>
<TE>   "He is absolutely superb.... And you never know what he is
thinking," LAPD Cmdr. Dan Koenig said.</TE>
<TE>   Pomeroy is "not a glamour-seeking, publicity-type executive," said
Dan Hoffman, Pomeroy's adjutant for many years and now a retired LAPD
lieutenant who is a vice president of a security company. "You get
the best of him one-on-one."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after being named to the post, LAPD's new interim chief
revealed little, and seemed to choose his words carefully as he
settled into the high-profile job of overseeing the 8,900-officer
force Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Pomeroy was even reluctant to describe his interests, at first
admitting only to liking golf. When asked about fly-fishing, though,
he couldn't suppress a grin: But of course he fly-fishes, he owned.
"Everyone in my town in Montana fly-fishes."</TE>
<TE>   Pomeroy, a former deputy chief and 31-year LAPD veteran who
retired in December 2000, has temporarily moved back from retirement
in Montana to take charge of the department until a permanent chief
is hired.</TE>
<TE>   The process is expected to take about six months. The previous
chief, Bernard C. Parks, retired last week after failing to win
reappointment to a second five-year term.</TE>
<TE>   Pomeroy's efforts to seem mild and unassuming, however, have only
served to enhance his reputation as a strong leader within the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Pomeroy, 56, was born in Arizona but raised in Lynwood, Calif.,
then Fullerton. He has a bachelor's degree from the University of
Redlands, and a master's in public communications from Pepperdine
University.</TE>
<TE>   He rose rapidly through the ranks of the LAPD in the 1980s. From
his post as commanding officer of the Southeast detective division,
he went on to serve in the juvenile division, as head of the
narcotics group, and as head of the criminal intelligence section.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, he stepped into the deputy chief job overseeing the San
Fernando Valley bureau, and became one of the heavy hitters among
LAPD's deputy chiefs, finally overseeing LAPD's headquarters bureau.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, he was placed in charge of disaster response
operations in the Valley following the 1994 Northridge earthquake. He
also was the senior LAPD official on the scene at the 1997 North
Hollywood shootout, in which two gun-toting bank robbers rampaged
through city streets, and was involved in the early stages of
investigating Rampart corruption allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Pomeroy also commanded LAPD operations during the 2000 Democratic
National Convention. But the job he was most remembered for Tuesday
was what associates described as his most difficult: He represented
the LAPD during negotiations with federal government officials that
led to a decree reforming the LAPD. The department is carrying out
the elaborate and expensive provisions of that decree under the watch
of the federal court and a court-appointed monitor.</TE>
<TE>   It is this role that earned him high marks from a number of Los
Angeles political leaders, and that, in the eyes of the Police
Commission, sealed his credentials as a reformer.</TE>
<TE>   According to Gerald Chaleff, a former president of the Police
Commission who was involved in consent-decree negotiations at the
same time as Pomeroy, the then-deputy chief earned the respect of his
negotiating partners by thorough preparation and intelligence. "Even
when they disagreed ... they respected him," Chaleff said.</TE>
<TE>   Pomeroy's methodical style also marked his dealings with the
commission, Chaleff said. He recalled that Pomeroy wrote a lengthy
defense of the Police Department's position on the police shooting of
Margaret Mitchell, a diminutive, mentally disabled homeless woman
armed only with a screwdriver.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting was one of the most controversial in LAPD's recent
history, and caused a serious rift between LAPD brass, who found the
shooting in accord with policy, and commissioners, who disagreed.
Chaleff said that although Pomeroy did not ultimately prevail, his
careful, well-reasoned defense of the shooting was memorable, and
gave commissioners pause.</TE>
<TE>   Some Consider Him Too Close to Parks</TE>
<TE>   Some LAPD insiders said Tuesday that Pomeroy had not been without
detractors, and was considered by some commanders to be too close to
Parks, who endured the enmity of LAPD's labor organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Pomeroy was once roundly criticized by a black officers
organization for not supporting more promotions of African Americans.
But Tuesday, Ronnie Cato, president of the Oscar Joel Bryant
Foundation, said his group would support the new interim chief.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Mitzi Grasso, president of the Police Protective
League, called Pomeroy's selection "a wise choice," and said the
union looked forward to working with him.</TE>
<TE>   One of Pomeroy's four grown children is an officer in LAPD's
Newton division. He remains married to wife Pamilla. He will continue
to draw his pension while filling the job. His salary has yet to be
negotiated. Pomeroy said his first action upon starting work today
would be to meet with the police league, as well as the union
representing command officers. After that, he planned to meet with
deputy chiefs, the department's monitor and community members.</TE>
<TE>   He said he would focus on bringing stability to the department
rather than making big changes, and will be especially concerned with
repairing LAPD's tarnished image.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an image of LAPD as dispirited, of officers not working
hard enough, of being incompetent," he said. "But this is a proud
organization, a compassionate organization."</TE>

<HD>Suspect Sought in Sex Assault on Girl</HD>
<DH>Crime: He rented a room in the home of Anaheim victim, 13,
who miscarried at school.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anaheim police Tuesday were looking for a man suspected of sexually
assaulting a 13-year-old girl who later had a miscarriage in a school
lavatory.</LD>
<LD>   Nabor Estrada Bartolo, 31, rented a room in the East Anaheim home
of the girl's family with his wife and three children, said Sgt. Rick
Martinez, a spokesman for the Anaheim Police Department. Bartolo has
not been seen for nearly two weeks, Martinez said.</LD>
<LD>   "We have not been able to find him. We've contacted all the
relatives and gone to the places where he's known to hang out. Now
we're asking the public for help," he said.</LD>
<TE>   On April 26, the girl told officials at Sycamore Junior High
School, where she is a student, that she was ill and needed to use
the lavatory, Martinez said.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a health clerk there trying to assist," Martinez said,
"but the girl kept resisting her attempts to help. When the girl
miscarried the fetus, she was able to hide it under her clothing and
give some excuse as to why she was ill. Ultimately, school officials
notified the girl's mother, who came and picked her up."</TE>
<TE>   Police found the fetus two days later in a freezer at the girl's
home, Martinez said, after her mother learned of the miscarriage and
called them. In interviews with investigators, he said, the
eighth-grader indicated Bartolo was the father.</TE>
<TE>   "Apparently, he had sex with her on more than one occasion,"
Martinez said. "When she discovered she was pregnant, he obtained
pills in Mexico known to cause miscarriages and gave her those pills.
We believe that he also pushed on her stomach hoping to cause a
miscarriage, which he ultimately did."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Bartolo was charged with several counts of sexual
molestation by force, as well as assault and child endangerment --
charges that could land him in prison for more than 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe he's on the run," Martinez said. The girl is in
protective custody at Orangewood Children's Home in Orange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two lawsuits have been filed against Burlington Northern Santa Fe
Railway, which operated the freight train that smashed into a
Metrolink commuter train last month in Placentia.</LD>
<LD>   One suit was filed by the family of Lawrence Sorensen, a
48-year-old Riverside engineer who was one of two passengers killed.</LD>
<LD>   The other was filed by a survivor, passenger V'Londa Arlice
Taylor. That suit invites others to join it.</LD>
<TE>   Both suits allege negligence and willful disregard for the safety
of the 270 Metrolink passengers. The freight train engineer told
authorities he was blinded by the sun and missed warning signals.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As her son lay in a coma at a hospital, a mother Tuesday gave
conflicting accounts to a judge about how her baby was injured.</LD>
<LD>   At one point, Tamara Sepulveda of Cypress grabbed a stuffed bear
and shook it as she showed Judge Richard E. Behn how her ex-boyfriend
injured their baby. Initially, the mother said she caused the
injuries, but she later explained that she was confused and that the
boy's father was responsible.</LD>
<LD>   Behn is being asked to decide who gets custody of the child, but
he soon may face another decision: whether to order the child's life
support turned off.</LD>
<TE>   The father, Moises Ibarra, who is in custody, could then face a
murder charge.</TE>

<HD>Grant to Buy Guns Denied</HD>
<DH>Hunting: County supervisor says youth club's plan to spend
funds on air rifles is not allowed under state code.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A $2,000 state grant that would have been used by a youth hunting
club to purchase air rifles was shot down Tuesday by the Board of
Supervisors.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisor Steve Bennett, the board's leading environmental
advocate, asked that the grant from state's fish and wildlife
propagation fund not be awarded. The money should only be used for
education purposes, he said.</LD>
<LD>   A proposal by the Ventura County Junior Air Rifle Program to buy
10 air rifles, ammunition and targets as part of a wildlife education
program is not allowed under state law, Bennett said. Air rifles are
similar to BB-guns, using air to propel tiny pellets.</LD>
<TE>   Such grants are issued for education programs aimed at conserving
California's fish and wildlife populations. The Board of Supervisors
agreed to refer the grant back to the county's Fish and Game
Commission, which had recommended approval.</TE>
<TE>   Commission Chairman Jeff Alexander said the panel would take
another look at the grant application, but disagreed with Bennett's
interpretation of state codes governing the disbursement of grant
funds</TE>
<TE>   "It was reviewed for compliance with [state] fish and game rules
and it is in compliance," Alexander said. "The purchase of the air
rifles goes along with the requirement for an education program that
includes environmental awareness, species awareness and animal
identification."</TE>
<TE>   An initial grant application was turned down because county fish
and game commissioners were concerned that it lacked enough of an
educational component, Alexander said. But applicant Nick Clark
returned in March with an improved proposal, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Youths involved in the Junior Air Rifle Program have agreed to
build water basins and dove shelters in wilderness areas as part of
the program. They will also learn about conservation during a summer
camp-out in Los Padres National Forest, Alexander said.</TE>
<TE>   The county Fish and Game Commission awards up to $100,000 a year
in grants, Alexander said. About half of the money goes to the
district attorney's office to prosecute fish and game violations, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the commission recommends who will receive the grants,
the supervisors have final approval.</TE>
<TE>   After the board meeting, Bennett said he is not opposed to the
hunting club or to its use of firearms.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett said he considers hunting "a healthy recreational sport
for millions of Americans." He does not hunt but occasionally finds a
fishing hole, he said.</TE>

<HD>South Gate Treasurer Appointed to New Job</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Less than one month after authorities charged South Gate's treasurer
with making murderous threats against public officials, Albert Robles
has been appointed deputy city manager, a job that pays $111,000 a
year.</LD>
<LD>   Robles, who has no municipal management experience, now holds both
the elected treasurer's post, which pays about $7,500 annually, and
the appointed position, which comes with full benefits.</LD>
<LD>   The appointment was announced in an interoffice memorandum Tuesday
but Robles actually was appointed to the post by acting City Manager
Dennis Young last Thursday. The announcement set off another round of
fierce public criticism in this city reeling from federal and local
corruption probes.</LD>
<TE>   "Appointing him as deputy city manager is like appointing the fox
to guard the chicken coop," said Councilman Henry Gonzalez, a
longtime Robles opponent.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez and other Robles critics say his appointment allows him
to use public funds to secure his power. Over the last few months,
Robles' three council allies have approved hundreds of thousands of
dollars to pay attorneys representing Robles against a voter recall
drive and various political corruption investigations.</TE>
<TE>   But administration officials say Robles was the best-qualified
candidate from a field of seven, because he has held several elected
posts, including mayor, during his 10-year career.</TE>
<TE>   Jesus Marez, the city's other deputy manager, believes the job
will work to Robles' advantage, forcing him to rein in his volatile
temper. "He runs amok as far as his comments are concerned sometimes,
but I think this will calm him," Marez said. "He's part of the staff
now, so he has to look at different ways of coming across."</TE>
<TE>   Robles' appointment came the same day that more than 150 local and
federal investigators raided the offices of several city leaders,
including Young and Robles.</TE>
<TE>   That probe centers on the alleged misuse of public funds by a city
attorney, and investigators served search warrants against several
officials with suspected links to the attorney. Young, who Marez said
is attending an out-of-town conference, was not available for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Though a city law bars elected officials from getting city posts
for a one-year period after their term expires, no provision
prohibits simultaneous tenures, Marez said.</TE>
<TE>   Robles' critics, however, are considering filing a taxpayer
lawsuit alleging that Robles now holds incompatible offices.</TE>
<TE>   In his new post, Robles will supervise three departments: Parks
and Recreation, Building and Safety and Government Affairs. The job
may require Robles' attendance at certain council meetings, where
residents regularly shout and argue with his allies, often accusing
them of corruption. Though he is treasurer, Robles has refused to
attend meetings for several months, likening the experience to
visiting a zoo.</TE>
<TE>   Despite trying to keep a low profile, he has remained in the
spotlight. Last month, he was arrested and charged with threatening
to kill two state legislators and a police officer. Robles, who has
pleaded not guilty to the charges, was not available for comment.</TE>

<LD>West Beach has gotten a face-lift to make it more hospitable to
sailors and paddlers.</LD>
<LD>   The new quiet-water area was created through a $600,000 dredging
project that removed 250,000 cubic yards of sand and re-contoured the
beach. The nearly four-month project was completed April 26 and
reopening ceremonies will be May 18, said Dave Myerson, city

<DL></DL>
<LD>A knife-wielding girl who was shot by a Ventura police officer last
weekend at her foster home remained hospitalized Tuesday and was
talking with mental health experts, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The 14-year-old, who police declined to name because of her age,
was being treated for three gunshot wounds to her abdomen in an acute
care unit at Ventura County Medical Center, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The girl was shot by Officer Kristin Rupp about 10:30 p.m. Sunday
when she allegedly refused orders to drop the knife and moved toward
Rupp in a threatening manner, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   The girl was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon
but police have withdrawn the charge pending further review, said
Sgt. Brock Avery.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not being pursued at this point because she is a ward of the
court," Avery said.</TE>
<TE>   Police officials said a preliminary report on the shooting would
be released today, and that Rupp, 23, may opt to return to work as
early as next week. She is on paid leave, which is police policy.</TE>
<TE>   When she is released from the hospital, the teen will be placed in
a county children's psychiatric hospital for further evaluation,
mental health officials said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The girl, a native of China, moved in with her foster family about
a month ago, after living in other homes outside the county,
officials said.</TE>

<HD>Suspects in Smuggling Ukrainians Go on Trial</HD>
<DH>Court: U.S. prosecutor says wiretap evidence will expose
defendants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors will rely on wiretap evidence to prove that organizers of
a Ukrainian smuggling ring brought hundreds of people into the United
States illegally through Mexico, forcing many into prostitution,
Assistant U.S. Atty. Mark Aveis said Tuesday during opening
statements in the case against seven defendants.</LD>
<LD>   Aveis said federal agents had listened to phone calls between
North Hills residents Tetyana Komisaruk, 50; her husband, Valeriy,
40; and others that revealed plans and methods to smuggle the
immigrants into Mexico and then lead them to the United States on
boat, car or foot since 1999.</LD>
<LD>   "[The calls] were like a play-by-play commentary by defendants
regarding their own activity," Aveis told a jury in U.S. District
Court.</LD>
<TE>   During a June 30, 2000, phone call, Tetyana Komisaruk told an
operative that he could do whatever he wanted to the women he was in
the process of smuggling, including chaining them up, Aveis said. The
women, many as young as 18, were constantly referred to as "whores."</TE>
<TE>   Other calls detailed plans to bring Ukrainians by Greyhound bus
from Tijuana to Los Angeles, federal prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Two attorneys for the alleged smuggling ring leaders--Valeriy
Komisaruk and Oleksandr Latyshev--also presented opening statements
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Ellen Barry said her client, Komisaruk, helped fulfill
the dreams of Ukrainians desperate for a better life in the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   "Their dream was so strong that they did whatever they could to
get here," Barry said. "The route they found was to go to Mexico and
sneak across the border."</TE>
<TE>   Latyshev's attorney, Errol Stambler, said his client did not
intend to violate the law and didn't do it for financial gain.</TE>
<TE>   The trial is expected to last more than a month.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors said they will call women who were smuggled to
testify that they were forced to work as prostitutes and to turn over
their money to defendant Serge Mezheritsky, 36, of Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   The thousands of dollars Ukrainian immigrants paid for their
voyage were hidden in various bank accounts and real estate, Aveis
said. The defendants also made the immigrants pay for Levis jeans and
other "American" clothing they were provided so they would fit in.
The immigrants were taught how to say in English that they were
United States citizens when questioned at the border. Women were
charged $250 to bleach their hair blond, Aveis said.</TE>
<TE>   "They made them look like day visitors to Mexico going back to the
U.S.," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution will also introduce evidence from Aug. 14, 2000,
when border agents stopped a Lincoln Continental because they noticed
the back of the car was dragging. Agents found two Ukrainian
immigrants in the trunk, Aveis said. The vehicle registration was
linked to the Komisaruks.</TE>

<LD>Growing up in a big city, a child could easily get the impression
that the night sky is naturally pale purple, twinkling from the light
of the urban grid and jumbo jets. Students who participate in the
Telescopes in Education project know better.</LD>
<LD>   Using computers in their classrooms, thousands of students around
the world have access to a telescope on Mt. Wilson, high above the
obscuring smog and lights of the Los Angeles Basin.</LD>
<LD>   Students remotely control the 24-inch telescope once used to
determine whether the moon's surface would support manned landings.
They take photographs of the universe for research or to enjoy as
pretty pictures of celestial objects they could never see with a
backyard telescope.</LD>
<TE>   Viewpoint School in Calabasas is one of more than 200 schools
nationwide participating in Telescopes in Education, or TIE, which is
supported by NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Canada
Flintridge and other organizations and businesses. The private
school's astronomy club met Friday for its monthly session with the
telescope and a traditional dinner of Chinese food served with tongs
from the chemistry lab.</TE>
<TE>   Over a speakerphone, Dave Lavezzi, a volunteer at the observatory,
told the 10 students that from his perch on the mountain, the night
looked great for stargazing.</TE>
<TE>   "There must be three or four galaxies that are shootable," he
said. TIE's volunteers at Mt. Wilson--among them a science advisor to
the TV show "Star Trek: The Next Generation," several teachers and a
clown--move the observatory's dome and give students tips on
manipulating the telescope from their computers. The coordinates of
most celestial objects already are programmed into the TIE software,
so a certain nebula or variable star can be pinpointed in a few
keystrokes and mouse clicks.</TE>
<TE>   Having completed their first school year in the TIE program,
Viewpoint's teenage astronomers have snapped many sharp photos of
galaxies and other faraway objects. Next year they plan to use their
discoveries for research projects, as other TIE schools have done. A
few years ago, for example, students at Crossroads School in Santa
Monica rediscovered a variable star that had not been charted since
the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the great thing about astronomy: Amateurs can assist
[professionals] in a meaningful way," said sophomore Joe Clark,
president of Viewpoint's astronomy club. He is using a 14-inch
telescope on Mt. Wilson to study the rotations and speeds of such
objects as asteroids.</TE>
<TE>   Astronomy does not receive much attention in high schools' science
curricula, where biology, chemistry and physics tend to dominate.
Beyond familiarizing students with the stellar world, programs such
as TIE are designed to teach math and computer skills and the basics
of photography.</TE>
<TE>   Calculating the speed of a comet can seem more relevant to
students than, say, figuring the speed of two trains bound for Kansas
City, said Gil Clark, TIE's director.</TE>
<TE>   "This they can relate to, because every time they look up in the
sky, they are reminded of what they did here," said Clark, not
related to the president of Viewpoint's astronomy club. On Friday
night, he taught them how to use their laptops to clean up
overexposed photos taken by the telescope's digital camera.</TE>
<TE>   Entering its 10th year, TIE plans to make two more telescopes
available beginning in September, in Chile and Australia. Their
locations in the Southern Hemisphere will afford a broader view of
the universe and open up more time slots for students, especially
during daytime hours in the Northern Hemisphere, program director
Clark said.</TE>

<HD>2 Suits Allege Negligence by Burlington in Train Crash</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN and PHIL WILLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two lawsuits--one by the family of one of the commuters who died last
month in the Placentia train accident and the other by a surviving
commuter--have been filed against Burlington Northern Santa Fe
Railway, which operated the freight train that smashed into a
Metrolink train.</LD>
<LD>   The suits allege negligence and willful disregard for the safety
of the 270 Metrolink passengers. One of the lawsuits, filed in Santa
Ana by passenger V'Londa Arlice Taylor, states that other claims
should be joined in the same suit.</LD>
<LD>   The second suit was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by the
family of Lawrence Sorensen, a 48-year-old engineer from Riverside.
He was one of two passengers killed.</LD>
<TE>   At least one other lawsuit has been filed since the crash.
Metrolink conductor Patrick Phillips, who suffered a brain hemorrhage
in the crash, also blames BNSF in a suit filed May 1.</TE>
<TE>   Following the crash, the freight train engineer told authorities
he was blinded by the sun when he missed a yellow warning signal and
failed to slow down in time to stop at a second light, which was red.</TE>
<TE>   The suits allege that BNSF knew about such risks but refused to
install safety systems that would prevent such crashes.</TE>
<TE>   The auto-brake collision system automatically stops a train if it
passes a warning light. Only a few rail lines in this country have
installed the braking systems. The railroad industry and federal
regulators have opposed mandating installation until the technology
is refined and the $3-billion price tag is reduced.</TE>
<TE>   The National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating
the Placentia crash, said the accident could have been prevented had
the anti-braking system been in place.</TE>
<TE>   Sorensen's parents, Ken and Lillian Sorensen of Calimesa, are
suing BNSF and Metrolink for a list of damages. The Sorensens were on
a Hawaiian cruise celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary when
they were notified of their son's death.</TE>

<HD>Public Servants Make Tracks to the Coveted Tranny Awards</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joan English is pulling her formal black dress out of the closet and
preparing a speech in which she will thank all the little people who
made this possible. She is also clearing a space on her wall for the
coveted award she plans to bring home tonight.</LD>
<LD>   A Grammy? An Emmy?</LD>
<LD>   Try a Tranny.</LD>
<TE>   Maybe you've never heard of it, but among transportation
officials, it is one of the most coveted awards in California.</TE>
<TE>   English, transportation and public works director for West
Hollywood, will be among about a dozen public officials from
throughout the state taking home a Tranny at a banquet tonight in
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   West Hollywood will be honored for the $35-million renovation of
Santa Monica Boulevard, a project that transformed a plain state
route into a three-mile landscaped roadway with bicycle lanes and
pedestrian walkways.</TE>
<TE>   Among other Tranny winners are the city of Los Angeles, which
completed earthquake retrofitting of the 1925-era Olympic Boulevard
Bridge while maintaining the 1,400-foot structure's historic flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Pomona will take home a Tranny for converting an old train depot
into a regional transit center serving buses and commuter trains.</TE>
<TE>   True, the Trannys don't attract paparazzi or TV news crews who ask
what designer the winners are wearing.</TE>
<TE>   But the award, given for the last 13 years by the nonprofit
California Transportation Foundation, is as coveted by transportation
officials as an Oscar is by an actor.</TE>
<TE>   "Given who is giving these awards, they are big," English said.
"Obviously, we are thrilled."</TE>
<TE>   The winners, who take home a plaque, are chosen by a panel of
transportation experts from public agencies and private firms. The
foundation launched the awards in 1989 to promote excellence in
transportation.</TE>
<TE>   To upgrade Santa Monica Boulevard, West Hollywood removed more
than 15,000 feet of railroad tracks beneath the pavement. The city
added more than six miles of new sidewalks and planted 1,200 trees.
The roadway was repaved using 15,000 tons of rubberized asphalt.</TE>
<TE>   Pomona spent $24 million to renovate and improve a 1940s-era train
depot, adding platforms for Metrolink passengers and a pedestrian
bridge over the tracks. .</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles spent $9.5 million to retrofit the Olympic Boulevard
Bridge, one of 13 historic bridges that span the Los Angeles River.</TE>
<TE>   To preserve the bridge's historic architecture, old photographs
were studied and the 1920s-era stylized railing and street lamps were
remanufactured.</TE>
<TE>   Clark Robins, a deputy city engineer, said the bridge work was
honored in 2000 by the state Department of Transportation. But he
suspects winning a Tranny is an even bigger accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never had a Tranny before, so it must be big," Robins said.</TE>

<HD>Geffen Gift to Aid People, Programs, UCLA Says</HD>
<DH>Philanthropy: Medical school officials vow to go slowly in
spending $200-million donation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN and CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fresh from announcing a record $200-million pledge for their medical
school, UCLA officials Tuesday were understandably giddy.</LD>
<LD>   But when it comes to spending the new cash from entertainment
mogul David Geffen, the school's administrators promise to take a
sober, go-slow approach.</LD>
<LD>   The $200 million is a landmark gift, but it won't come in a lump
sum and, in the costly world of medical education and research, it
won't be enough to finance a spending spree.</LD>
<TE>   Although UCLA officials declined to give specifics, one
knowledgeable source said the payments from Geffen would stretch over
about a decade.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's plan is to spread the money over time on a variety of
purposes, such as student financial aid, scientists' training and
research.</TE>
<TE>   The money will be put in the school's endowment fund, and once it
reaches the full $200 million, it will generate around $10 million a
year in income. That's no piddling sum, but just a fraction of the
school's $693-million annual operating budget.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sizable, but it's not so huge that it dominates all of their
activities by any stretch. It's not like you get to spend the $200
million all in one year, much less every year," said Michael
Morrisey, a health-care economist at the University of Alabama at
Birmingham.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, UCLA emphasized that the Geffen money is
unrestricted, unlike the vast majority of the medical school's
endowment, which totaled $587 million as of the middle of last year.
As such, UCLA officials said, the university will have a free hand to
put the money to the best possible use.</TE>
<TE>   Though plans are in flux, "We do not want to use this money for
bricks and mortar," said Dr. Gerald S. Levey, dean of UCLA's medical
school. "This is a gift for programs, for faculty and for students."</TE>
<TE>   Whether they put their money to work quickly or over the long
term, other medical schools that have received large donations say
they were left forever changed--either physically or in their
long-term aspirations.</TE>
<TE>   Cornell University launched an aggressive hiring and renovation
program after receiving $100million from financier Sanford I. Weill
and his wife, Joan, in 1998, along with another $100 million from the
same couple this year. The school was renamed for them.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Antonio M. Gotto Jr., the school's dean, said the first
$100million helped launch a campaign to build its basic sciences
program. The school has recruited 20 new faculty members and
renovated 25% of its research space. It also has created a new gene
therapy lab and an imaging center.</TE>
<TE>   The Weills' second $100-million gift began a drive to raise $750
million for clinical programs.</TE>
<TE>   "There were some complaints initially from some of the alumni for
changing the name" of the school, Gotto said. "But when they saw what
a transforming effect a gift of this magnitude could have, most of
them quickly became supporters."</TE>
<TE>   But Gotto, who served as a resident with UCLA's Levey at
Massachusetts General Hospital decades ago, said that the money has
been coming in over several years and that it has taken time to make
changes. "It took about a year before one could really see the
effects of it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA is more likely to follow the example of USC, where changes
have come far more slowly. USC's medical school received a
$110-million gift from the W.M. Keck Foundation in 1999--the largest
to a medical school until Geffen's this week. Because the Keck money
went into the medical school's endowment, it is being put to use over
the long term rather than being used at once for new programs or
buildings.</TE>
<TE>   USC used the Keck gift as leverage to begin construction on a
$60-million neurogenetic institute that will open later this year.
The school subsequently conducted a fund-raising campaign to recoup
the cost of the building and return the Keck funds to the endowment.</TE>
<TE>   But the Keck gift has had even more significant intangible
benefits, said Dr. Stephen J. Ryan, dean of the renamed Keck School
of Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a telephone book of plans that would not have been
conceivable if it were not for the Keck gift," Ryan said. Now, "we
have timelines on all of these things taking us to 2009."</TE>
<TE>   Ryan added that the Geffen gift to UCLA "benefits academic
medicine overall because it raises the bar" for donations.</TE>
<TE>   The size of Geffen's gift inspired top medical school deans.
Harvard Medical School said such grants help universities support
researchers whose disciplines are too new to generate funding from
the National Institutes of Health.</TE>
<TE>   "Were we to be the recipient of a grant like that, it would
certainly put our dean in the position to make a leap into absolutely
new ground, to fund research that is too new to be funded through the
peer-reviewed process," said Eric Buehrens, executive dean for
administration at the school, which has an endowment of $1.9 billion.</TE>
<TE>   But would the medical school's name be changed if it got a $200-
million gift? "I can't conceive of a circumstance under which the
Harvard Medical School would be renamed," Buehrens said.</TE>

<LD>Over the protest of Clerk-Recorder Richard Dean, the county Board of
Supervisors agreed Tuesday to shift some clerical duties from the
clerk-recorder's division to the county manager's office.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisor Kathy Long said it would be more efficient for the
duties of the board's clerk to be supervised by County Executive
Officer Johnny Johnston. The clerk of the board prepares meeting

<LD>A former employee in the Ventura County assessor's office was
sentenced to three years' probation and fined $750 for trying to
lower the assessed value of her property, officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Barbara Sorem-Hughlett, who worked as an appraiser, pleaded no
contest Monday to a misdemeanor count of conflict of interest, said
Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom Temple. Sorem-Hughlett tried in October 2000
to lower the value of her home in Santa Paula by $20,000 and take off
an additional $5,000 as a nuisance for living behind a flood channel,
Temple said. If her plan had worked, she would have saved $190 a year
on property taxes.</LD>

<HD>The Good Life--It's All a Matter of Taste</HD>
<DH>Food is culture. It is community. It is the link to nature,
our ancestral home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SONOMA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>If you regard food as commerce, the bottom-line bores will tell you
that all the action is happening in the laboratories of biogenetics.
If you approach food as fuel, the cook-by-numbers folks are dreaming
up still more "foolproof" preparations so that we can get through
dinner quicker with less fuss and fewer dishes.</LD>
<LD>   But if you look at food as culture, there are contrary and more
satisfying happenings underway. Americans are being drawn back to the
time when people lived closer to nature's bounty. Simultaneously, we
are being propelled forward into dizzying realms of variety, quality
and imagination.</LD>
<LD>   I'm on a different kind of health food kick just now.</LD>
<TE>   The unsettling cross-currents of industrial foodstuffs may have
met their match here in Northern California's neighboring valleys of
Sonoma and Napa. Famed for wineries, these are also now valleys of
olive oil, cheese, garlic, honey, vinegar, apple, egg, butter, Indian
corn, sweet corn, beef, lamb, jam, cider, fig, boysenberry, to name
just some.</TE>
<TE>   For a change, we aren't hearing that we should have been around
last year, or 20 years ago. This is the best of times to satisfy our
primordial appetite. The modern-day quest to see how cheaply we can
sustain ourselves is being challenged by a different question: How
well can we eat?</TE>
<TE>   In places like this, and the others like it that thrive across the
country, food plays a larger role in community. Locals and visitors
tend to have higher expectations for quality; a greater grasp of
possibilities. They draw more of their daily pleasures from the
appreciation of mealtime. It is an advancing and, I hope, unstoppable
idea that doesn't get enough serious attention outside of the food
pages.</TE>
<TE>   To value our food is itself a fundamental value. It brings us
closer to nature and thus closer to ourselves because nature is our
ancestral home. Besides, novelty notwithstanding, basic satisfactions
are best.</TE>
<TE>   Take olive oil--now the rage.</TE>
<TE>   "We sell everything we can get our hands on and wish we had a
little more," says Ed Stolman of The Olive Press in Glen Ellen.</TE>
<TE>   Olive oil is the healthiest fat you can eat, or so the experts
say. It is also the tastiest.</TE>
<TE>   And its variety, lore and complexity beg for the same obsessive
pursuit that many give wine.</TE>
<TE>   There are green Tuscan oils with peppery bite and tawny gold oils
from the late harvests with the softness of butter. And dozens in
between.</TE>
<TE>   For too long, Americans have been stuck with Southern Europe's
bland and poorly labeled leftovers. But a decade ago, serious
oil-making began from the trees planted around California's famed
Spanish missions. Today, new trees in many varieties are going in by
the thousands, and there are presses scattered across the region.
Recognition of quality is spreading.</TE>
<TE>   Stolman, who recently won an Italian prize for his Lunigiana
Estate California oil, predicts that appreciation of olive oil will
catch on like, well, ice cream. He should know.</TE>
<TE>   Some years ago, he believed that a specialty treat from a Chicago
candy store would have larger appeal, so he arranged for national
distribution of the Dove Bar.</TE>
<TE>   Or take cheese.</TE>
<TE>   Ig Vella's family has been making medal-winning cheese in Sonoma
since 1931 with an old-country attitude: Good food is a comfort that
belongs to every working family, not a fad to be hijacked and
mystified as another extravagance for the wealthy.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't be polemic about it. Don't give me some Sermon on the
Mount," Vella growls.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing pleases him more than a youngster at the sample counter
who asks, "Mom, how come you don't get us cheese like this?"</TE>
<TE>   Back in 1975, restaurateur Alice Waters and chef Jeremiah Tower at
Chez Panisse in Berkeley created a sensation. Using the best regional
and seasonal ingredients, they pioneered the idea of "California
cuisine." Their philosophy, plus the mushrooming growth of organic
food and surely the ready mood of the nation, has lifted Americans'
culinary expectations, not by increments but by leaps.</TE>
<TE>   The results can be seen in the spread of farmers markets across
the country and in the success of grocers who offer new terms for a
bargain: If you pay half again as much with a discriminating eye, you
can eat twice as well.</TE>
<TE>   The trend reaches its apogee in the Napa Valley village of
Yountville. Here, at the French Laundry, for the price of a good seat
at an NBA game, chef Thomas Keller combines kitchen artistry with the
world's very best ingredients to create the transcendent dining
experience of our age.</TE>
<TE>   Keller explains: "Respect for food is a respect for life, for who
we are and what we do."</TE>

<HD>Insurance: You Pay, They Bait and Switch</HD>
<DH>Health-care plans are beginning to feel like scams in
California.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMIE COURT</AU>
<BD>Jamie Court is executive director of the Santa
Monica-based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. E-mail:
jamie@consumer watchdog.org.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The revelation that health insurers will be levying surcharges of as
much as $400 per day for the best hospitals shows the degree to which
insurance is fast becoming a bait-and-switch scam.</LD>
<LD>   Individuals sign up for a health plan primarily because of the
network of doctors and hospitals in it, but the new fine print
restricts that choice by adding a hefty surcharge for using the best
facilities.</LD>
<LD>   Health maintenance organizations and insurers have similarly
forced patients to pay extra for the most effective medications.
Cancer patients who switched to Medicare HMOs with the promise of
greater coverage have been charged hundreds of dollars as a
co-payment for each radiation treatment, something traditional
Medicare fully covers.</LD>
<TE>   Insurance, an agreement that for a fixed sum a company will pay
for the costs if serious illness or injury strikes, has become a
process of "disinsurance," turning the promise of protection into
little more than a coupon book.</TE>
<TE>   HMOs and managed-care insurers have been the beneficiaries.
Wellpoint, the parent company of Blue Cross, announced a 46% jump in
first-quarter profit compared with last year. Kaiser Permanente, a
not-for-profit company, saw first-quarter net income increase 90%.</TE>
<TE>   Most disconcerting is that disinsurance is the health plans' back
door to avoid California's new patients' rights laws. Since the
California Department of Managed Health Care can prevent HMOs from
restricting necessary access to physicians and hospitals, the plans
simply started charging hefty prices for it.</TE>
<TE>   The department has no jurisdiction to deal with premium increases
or cost-sharing requirements. Giving it that power should warrant the
attention of legislators in Sacramento. However, campaign
contributions appear to have blinded politicians to the
bait-and-switch tactics. For example, the state Assembly's Health
Committee has announced that it would hold all legislation for new
health coverage mandates until a new commission in 2003 "studied"
them. The committee members received a total of $400,000 from HMOs
and insurers during the 2001-2002 election cycle.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City), who received
$194,683 from insurers during the same period, backed the committee
decision and also has reneged on a commitment made last year to our
foundation to work toward giving HMO patients the right to a court
trial.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis has said that he is finished with all major
patients' rights reforms, all the while taking more than $750,000
from insurers.</TE>
<TE>   Managed care's bait-and-switch tactics are plain to see. The
insurers promised to maintain quality, even as they acknowledged
quality problems by supporting a patients' bill of rights (albeit a
toothless one). They said they would lower premiums but have stuck
the second-biggest purchaser in the nation, the California Public
Employees' Retirement System, with a 25% increase. The final thread
of its promise--choice--has unraveled too. Under disinsurance, only
the richest will have the choice of medical care they need.</TE>
<TE>   A state-sponsored study found significant savings from a
hypothetical private health care delivery system paid for by a single
public entity--the poorly named "single payer"--which would function
like Medicare for everyone. The Lewin Group, a benefits consulting
group, found that expanding health coverage to all 35.1million
California residents through such a model would reduce average health
expenditures per family by up to $813 in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Some activists are talking about placing a "Medicare for all" plan
on the 2004 state ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Disinsurance has the power to make what once seemed like radical
solutions to the health care crisis appear to be common sense.</TE>

<HD>Israel, an Indispensable Haven</HD>
<DH>This key role is underscored tragically by Europe's surge
in anti-Semitism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER REICH</AU>
<BD>Walter Reich, a professor of international affairs,
ethics and human behavior at George Washington University, is a
senior scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center. He was director of the
U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum from 1995 to 1998.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The ugly beast of anti-Semitism racing across the Jewish graveyard
known as Europe has at least one saving grace.</LD>
<LD>   It reminds us--now that Israel's legitimacy is again being
attacked--of the core reason for the Jewish state's existence.</LD>
<LD>   That Israel has the right to exist where it is--the simple,
fundamental, historical right--is as certain and as evident as it's
always been. The Jewish people came alive there.</LD>
<TE>   They grew up and matured there. They developed their civilization
there. They created a faith there that became the source of the other
Western faiths.</TE>
<TE>   Despite defeats by larger powers, that land was their
home--physical and spiritual--through more than a millennium of life
and creativity. And in the two millenniums after their massive
dispersion by the Romans, many Jews remained there, many more
struggled to return there and the rest prayed for a national return
to Zion in their daily rituals in every place of exile.</TE>
<TE>   But it's what happened to the Jews in their archipelago of
exile--throughout those two millenniums but especially during the
last century--that gives the inhabitants of the modern state of
Israel, in addition to the right to live there, the urgency and
necessity to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Very simply, they were murdered again and yet again. True, usually
they were only hounded. Often they were tolerated. In some places, at
least for a while, they were welcomed. And in a few precious places
they were allowed to truly flourish.</TE>
<TE>   The most precious and anomalous such place--the one that has
itself flourished because it is learning, after much grief and
suffering, to allow all of its people to flourish--is America.</TE>
<TE>   But, in the 1930s and 1940s, when Europe's Jews needed a haven
from the ferocious rampage of that continent's anti-Semitic beast,
even America didn't open its arms. And the ashes and bodies of
Europe's murdered Jews filled that continent's ravines, ditches,
lakes, rivers and streams.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't have to be that way. Had the Jewish state that was
created in 1948, after the Holocaust, been created only a decade
earlier, those ashes and bodies would have remained living people,
and they would have had a place to go. And the anti-Semitic beast,
which at that time spoke German, would have been delighted to let
them go.</TE>
<TE>   Now the beast--reawakened from a sullen silence induced by half a
century of Holocaust shame, and invoking justifications based on the
struggle of the Jewish state to respond to massacres aimed at
destroying it--speaks in other tongues as well and lives in a variety
of European places.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes that beast still speaks German. But now it has greater
fluency in French, both in France and in Belgium, and increasingly
it's growling across the channel in English and occasionally barks in
Italian.</TE>
<TE>   Its utterances have been heard in Russian too, as well as in
Ukrainian. And for the first time in modern Europe it's expressing
itself, sometimes very forcefully and evermore viciously, in Arabic.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, no country has yet countenanced that beast, and none
is anywhere near mobilizing its vast powers in the service of the
beast's murderous ends.</TE>
<TE>   One prays--indeed, one has the hopeful confidence--that none ever
will.</TE>
<TE>   But given the bitter lessons of recent history, against the
background of two millenniums of bitter lessons, one would be foolish
to be absolutely sure.</TE>
<TE>   And one is reminded of that foolishness by the stirrings of the
beast that currently prowls Europe, making noises in the form of
street attacks on Jews in Paris, London, Berlin and Brussels,
multiple synagogue bombings and torchings across the Continent, grave
desecrations in Greece and France and malicious slurs in the politely
powerful salons of elite society. In France alone, the beast's
current favorite lair, Jews experienced 360 attacks in the first two
weeks of April.</TE>
<TE>   Given the mortal stakes, it's clear that Jews will never have
secure homes anywhere unless they also have a national home in
Israel--a haven to which they can escape from wherever they are if
the beast of anti-Semitism is ever again given the power to put its
passions in murderous gear.</TE>

<HD>State's Auto Emissions Bill Is Just So Much Gas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BENJAMIN ZYCHER</AU>
<BD>Benjamin Zycher is a senior fellow at the Pacific
Research Institute. E-mail: bennyz@pacbell.net.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's easy to be a "leader" when others have to pay the price. The
latest manifestation of such cheap posturing is the current effort in
the California Legislature to regulate "greenhouse gas" (that is,
carbon dioxide) emissions from autos.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, the Senate amended AB 1058, which puts new restrictions
on tailpipe emissions of cars and light trucks. The bill is being
debated in the Assembly; a vote is imminent and is expected to be
close.</LD>
<LD>   Let us review what the atmospheric scientists actually know. Over
the past century, carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere
have increased from about 280 parts per million to about 360ppm.
Earth surface temperatures are about 1 degree Fahrenheit higher than
was the case 100 years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the temperature increase took place before 1940, while
most of the carbon dioxide emissions came after that, a sequence of
events that presents a problem for the global warming hypothesis.</TE>
<TE>   Carbon dioxide is a very small component of so-called greenhouse
gases, most of which are water vapor and clouds.</TE>
<TE>   No one seriously claims to know whether the past warming was
caused by human activities; whether further warming will occur and,
if it does, whether it will result from human activities, and whether
such warming in some general sense would be a bad thing.</TE>
<TE>   What we do know is the dirty little secret of the environmental
leftists: A full implementation of the Kyoto treaty would delay
global warming over the next century by at most six years.</TE>
<TE>   As former Greenpeace activist Bjorn Lomborg shows in his 2001 book
"The Skeptical Environmentalist," the annual economic cost of the
Kyoto treaty would be about $200billion, the same as the estimated
one-time cost of providing clean drinking water and sanitation for
every living person.</TE>
<TE>   Back to Sacramento: The current legislative effort, by many of the
same people who brought us the electricity mess, would require the
use of expensive technologies for automobiles, raising prices by
thousands of dollars and/or forcing sharp downsizing of cars,
yielding hundreds of additional crash deaths and injuries each year,
according to the National Research Council of the National Academy of
Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   And for what? California gasoline consumption is about 5% of world
consumption. Suppose that the legislation reduces California gasoline
consumption by an impossible 20%. World consumption would be reduced
by 1%, and any reduction in greenhouse gas emissions--let alone
actual atmospheric concentrations--would be unmeasurable,
particularly because automotive emissions are a relatively minor
source of greenhouse gases. Moreover, the increased prices of
automobiles and reduced safety for motorists would provide incentives
to keep older vehicles longer, reducing or reversing the already
infinitesimal benefits to the environment.</TE>
<TE>   In any event, proponents have not asserted any such concrete
benefits. Instead, vague claims about reduced global warming have
been combined with the argument that "California must be a leader."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever that means, it is a slogan, not a policy.</TE>
<TE>   Feel-goodism and moral preening are poor bases for legislation,
particularly when the politicians pursuing them are unlikely to be
present years from now when the adverse effects are felt by ordinary
people.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the state Air Resources Board, charged under this
proposed legislation with developing regulations, is responsible for
one of the great environmental regulatory fiascoes of recent years:
the 1990 decree that by 2003 10% of all cars sold in California were
to have been "zero emission vehicles," that is, electric cars.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve years and millions of taxpayer dollars later, that program
has been modified into insignificance.</TE>
<TE>   If the environmental leftists really cared about greenhouse gas
emissions, they would support nuclear power generation, which is
indisputably clean and has a strong safety record in the West. Will
they?</TE>
<TE>   Don't bet on it.</TE>
<TE>   A footnote:</TE>
<TE>   Did you know that legislators in Sacramento are allowed to choose
autos that the state purchases for them for their official
activities? The Associated Press reports that almost half have chosen
low-gas-mileage sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, and most of
the rest picked sedans with lower than average fuel efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   Can they spell hypocrisy?</TE>

<HD>Make Enron Pirates Answer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a scam after all.</LD>
<LD>   As California faced desperate electricity shortages in 2000 and
2001, power giant Enron was manipulating the market to drive up
prices and turn modest power shortages into critical ones. This
arrogant behemoth, since brought down by its own hubris, toyed with
the public health and safety of California to boost its own profit,
and there's finally a smoking gun to prove it.</LD>
<LD>   Internal Enron documents released by the bankrupt company's new
management describe these unethical, if not illegal, trading
practices in detail and indicate that other companies were doing the
same thing. All the while, everyone from Enron's then-chief Kenneth
Lay to Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and regulators who should
have smelled a rat were saying it was all California's fault. For
failing to build enough power plants. For adopting a power
deregulation plan that wasn't free-market enough. For environmental
laws with a Malibu mind-set.</LD>
<TE>   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission refused to accept its
legal responsibility to rein in a wildly out-of-control market.
Ultimately, commissioners said, the free market would work. For
California, that meant a year of crisis, of rolling blackouts, of one
major utility going bankrupt and another flat broke, of the state
doling out $6 billion to buy daily power and an additional $40
billion for long-term contracts at what we now know are grossly
inflated rates. FERC finally acted out of political necessity; it was
too little, too late.</TE>
<TE>   The Enron memos go on in pages of sneering, "gotcha" detail about
such things as how to get paid for not putting any energy on the
grid. In another ploy, the firm would buy power in California at a
capped price of $250 a megawatt-hour and resell it in Oregon for
$1,200--at a time when California was flirting daily with blackouts.
The schemes had cute names like Death Star and Fat Boy.</TE>
<TE>   When California complained and Gov. Gray Davis denounced the
energy manipulators, an Enron official said, "California is trying to
perpetuate the greatest political dodge of the last 100 years."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, deregulation was flawed, California was short of power plants
and a drought in the Northwest had reduced hydroelectric power. Davis
was slow to react to the crisis. But these factors alone did not
cause the state's power costs to go from $7 billion in 1999 to $27
billion the next year.</TE>
<TE>   FERC should help the state obtain substantial refunds from the
power-generating companies that charged exorbitant prices. The state
has asked for $9 billion, an amount that federal regulators had
deemed far too high but that they now should regard as just about
right.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department should investigate possible criminal
violations. The state should demand that all of its long-term
contracts, signed under the duress of the inflated market, be
nullified and renegotiated without delay. And FERC should extend its
modest market controls beyond the present Sept. 30 expiration.
Electricity is vital to public welfare. It must not be held hostage
by manipulators piously invoking the free market.</TE>
<TE>   They scoffed in Washington and Houston when Davis called the
energy manipulators pirates. Now we know he was right.</TE>

<HD>Taming Patent Drug Prices</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>People taking the drug Prilosec to treat serious heartburn should
have seen their monthly costs drop from $152 to about $80 in October,
when the manufacturer's patent on the widely prescribed drug was set
to expire. At that point, a cheaper generic drug should have hit the
market. It didn't. Loopholes in U.S. law allowed the drug company,
London-based AstraZeneca, to file a lame lawsuit against its generic
competitors and trigger a 30-month delay on approval of the generic.
Prilosec earned $3.7billion for AstraZeneca in the United States
alone last year, so the legal bills will be worth it.</LD>
<LD>   Such abuses, costing U.S. consumers billions of dollars a year,
should be at the heart of hearings that begin today in the Senate
Health Committee. Prilosec is just one of many patented drugs kept
exclusively on the market by hardball legal tactics.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps the most egregious case is Taxol, a drug for treating
breast and ovarian cancer that was developed entirely with U.S.
taxpayer dollars in the 1970s and '80s.</LD>
<TE>   In the early '90s, the U.S. government allowed Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. to patent the drug in exchange for a promise to allow
generic companies to enter the market in five years, by the end of
1997. When that date came, Bristol, by then earning more than
$1billion a year on the drug, mounted a ruthless assault on would-be
generic competitors. Four years later, women finally got access to a
generic costing half the $8,000-a-cycle price of Taxol.</TE>
<TE>   Congress can best close these loopholes by passing SB 812, a bill
by Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) that
would discourage the Federal Trade Commission from its practice of
giving automatic 30-month patent extensions to any brand-name drug
manufacturer that wants to challenge a generic in court.</TE>
<TE>   Drug companies deserve to recoup the significant costs of bringing
drugs to market and earn a fair profit. McCain and Schumer's bill
merely requires the FTC to assess each patent infringement claim
carefully.</TE>
<TE>   The McCain-Schumer bill was declared dead last year. This year is
a new story. Two powerful groups--labor and employers--have rallied
behind it as a way of dampening drug prices that have sent their
employee health premiums soaring. It will take more than this bill to
tame drug costs, but it at least takes aim at costly patented drugs
that long ago made back their development costs and turned a handsome
profit for their makers.</TE>

<LD>It's no secret that we oppose secrecy. It's no secret because of the
regular spectacle of some government agency, official body or private
institution--a church, for instance--hiding embarrassing information
behind a curtain of secrecy.</LD>
<LD>   Now comes a most amazing example, one that could top a news parody
show--except that it's true. Get a tissue before reading; one way or
another, you'll need it.</LD>
<LD>   The National Zoo refuses to release medical records for Ryma, a
beloved but departed giraffe. We had to read that twice too. It's
true. Zoo Director Lucy Spelman says releasing medical information on
the dead animal would violate the animal's privacy rights, especially
the client-patient relationship between caretakers and care receiver.
Uh-huh. Anyway, she adds, regular people wouldn't comprehend records
written by professional vets.</LD>
<TE>   Thank goodness we have real professionals to protect the privacy
of dead giraffes who spent their lives on public display, while
saving ignorant citizens from potentially confusing medical
information. Let's say someone misdiagnosed a giraffe's disease and
the animal died. Want to explain that at a zoo fund-raiser? That
scenario may or may not be true. Because it's a secret, no one can
say. That's the problem with secrecy in a democracy.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe hyenas whisper behind our backs, but it's certainly a human
trait to whisper secrets to one another. Secrecy seems to elevate
those in the know. It creates exclusive bands of "ins" who know and
"outs" who don't. That's fine for, say, missile launch codes. But
elsewhere, secrecy corrodes a free society. If doors to two
teenagers' rooms are open and a third is closed, what does any parent
want to do? And that's but one family.</TE>
<TE>   Now the National Zoo, part of the revered Smithsonian Institution,
has a closed door. Such secrecy is worse among officials, allowing
those with public duties, paid with public funds, to exclude others
whose acceptance of authority is required for the democracy to
function. Time after time in our history, a police board, county
commission, vice president or zookeeper has forgotten this.</TE>
<TE>   The National Zoo has accidentally created a wondrous exhibit of
silliness. A quick question: If zoo animals are so interested in
their landlord's professed privacy precepts, why do they perform in
public the most basic private acts of living creatures? Maybe they
dislike secrecy too.</TE>

<LD>Re "Reclaiming a Neighborhood," editorial, May 3: A couple of years
ago, when the Rampart scandal was selling newspapers, the daily topic
on the front page included a pounding of the LAPD. As a result of
your crusade, most of the gang units were disbanded. This resulted in
a rebound of gang killings after the gang members realized that there
was no longer pressure from the police. Now you are outraged at the
gang violence that you aided in your effort to sell newspapers two
years ago.</LD>
<LD>   By the way, in Boyle Heights the "aging public housing projects"
described in your editorial have been replaced by new modern
buildings built and subsidized by the taxpayers. The old buildings
left are vacant and awaiting destruction. Your paper has done much to
destroy the LAPD over the past several years, and now you mourn the
results. I hope you can all sleep at night.</LD>

<TE>   Your editorial made me think about how our state doesn't really
focus on the important things, like neighborhood shootings. So many
young, innocent children die every day because our neighborhoods are
not safe. Just because some people can't afford to live in safe and
clean neighborhoods doesn't mean their kids deserve to die.</TE>
<TE>   We as a community should stand up and do something in order to
save our children.</TE>

<TE>   Celeste Fremon, in "The Heat's Off" (Opinion, May 5), writes
nothing about the economics of the L.A. gangs. Nothing is mentioned
about the lifeblood of these and most other gangs in the 21st
century: the government-protected monopoly to sell street drugs. This
scenario is so widespread it is astonishing to me that the pattern
goes unrecognized.</TE>
<TE>   The politicians create a problem (prohibit some drugs), human
nature reacts (black market) and the politicians come to the rescue
(war on drugs). The problem gets worse (corruption), and the mantra
of more money and police results in higher taxes, less freedom and
innocent people getting trampled in an endless, futile war. After
many years, we forget how we got into this mess. Are you terrorism
warriors paying attention?</TE>

<LD>Re "The D.A.'s Press Attack," editorial, May 4: District attorney
investigators went to the Metropolitan News-Enterprise offices with a
judicially authorized warrant to obtain an invoice showing that a
local law firm paid for a legal notice of a recall election in South
Gate. All the publishers had to do was turn over relevant business
documents, which were sought as part of a broad political corruption
probe.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning last month, D.A.'s office staff members spoke with
Metropolitan News' co-publisher Jo-Ann Grace. They were assured of
complete cooperation. Grace requested legal process before providing
the business records. In this instance, the appropriate legal
document was a search warrant. When the warrant was presented by two
district attorney investigators, neither Jo-Ann Grace nor her
husband, Roger M. Grace, editor and co-publisher, was present. Prior
to and subsequently upon his arrival, Roger Grace was uncooperative
and refused to comply with the court order. Investigators closed down
the paper. A short time later, Jo-Ann Grace fully cooperated with
investigators and turned over the requested documents. The newsroom
at the Metropolitan News was not violated.</LD>
<TE>   Your suggestion that the newspaper shield law might extend to
cover business invoices for legal notices will have to be worked out
in the courts. Our efforts to obtain evidence were focused and
narrow. The district attorney's office will continue to use all
appropriate tools, including lawfully issued search warrants, in its
efforts to pursue corruption in L.A. County. The public expects no
less.</TE>

<LD>Re "Future of Jenin Lies in the Rubble," May 4: Residents of that
portion of Jenin damaged in the battle with Israel clearly want to
rebuild, and Arab Israelis reportedly have already indicated that
they will fund the rebuilding. The rebuff of this offer by the
Palestinian Authority and the willingness of the leadership to leave
thousands displaced once again demonstrate their willingness to use
the average Palestinian as a pawn in the war against Israel.</LD>
<LD>   The Palestinian leadership is obviously more concerned with
perpetuating the now-discredited myth of a massacre than with
improving the lives of the average citizens. It is this willingness
of the Palestinian Authority to fuel hatred and leave open festering
wounds that creates an environment ripe for suicide bombers.</LD>

<TE>   Re Hussein Ibish's "Devastation Only Feeds Resistance,"
Commentary, May 6: The fact is that since the Oslo accords of 1993,
97% of the Palestinians have been living under the sovereignty of the
Palestinian Authority, not under Israeli "occupation." Why did the
Palestinian Authority squander the opportunity to build up a
prospering Palestinian society that would live in peace alongside
Israel? Yasser Arafat instead chose to build breeding grounds for
fanatics and terrorist homicide bombers and import weapons in the
futile hope of destroying Israel.</TE>
<TE>   As an American, I take great offense at Ibish's suggestion that
the U.S. Congress ignores the plight of the Palestinians. For
decades, the U.S. government has contributed two-thirds or more of
the U.N. Relief and Works Agency's budget for the Palestinian
refugees. The Arab nations have consistently shown enormous
indifference to the Palestinians; how else do we explain 50-year-old
"refugee camps"?</TE>

<TE>   As the truth slowly filters out of the rubble in Jenin, Ramallah
and other West Bank towns, we should all breathe a sigh of relief
that more people weren't killed. Still, in the seemingly wanton
destruction of homes, cars and storefronts and the looting and
trashing of offices like the ministry of education, I can't help
hearing our own past crying out in the sound of breaking glass,
echoing back from a time when it was our storefronts being
demolished, our people being humiliated. The $100 million it'll take
to rebuild Jenin is nothing compared with what we Jews are losing by
continuing to ignore our past.</TE>

<TE>   Opposing a U.N. investigation of the situation in Jenin, Susan
Ehrlich (letter, May 3) asserts that the U.N.-sponsored World
Conference on Racism, held at Durban, South Africa, last summer, was
an "anti-Semitic hate fest" that equated Zionism with racism, singled
out Israel for condemnation and failed to denounce slavery in several
parts of the world.</TE>
<TE>   The relevant passages of the final resolution passed by full
consensus at Durban follow:</TE>
<TE>   "We recall that the Holocaust must never be forgotten."</TE>
<TE>   "We ... recognize with deep concern the increase in anti-Semitism
and Islamophobia."</TE>
<TE>   "We recognize the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to
self-determination and to the establishment of an independent state,
and we recognize the right to security for all states in the region,
including Israel."</TE>
<TE>   "We acknowledge that slavery and the slave trade, including the
transatlantic slave trade, were appalling tragedies in the history of
humanity ... and further acknowledge that slavery and the slave trade
are a crime against humanity and should always have been so."</TE>

<LD>Re "Dress the Part, Teachers," editorial, May 5: I would like to
invite all The Times' editors to visit our 23-plus-acre high school
campus. Please come in September, when it's nice and warm, and don't
worry about the air conditioning being too cold--there isn't any. In
the interest of equity, all of you, male and female, ought to wear
both a tie and pantyhose. We'll try not to assign you to the bungalow
across the athletic fields, so wear nice shoes too. It'll mean the
world to our students.</LD>

<TE>   As probably the worst-dressed teacher in the LAUSD with excellent
evaluations, I venture that my fellow teachers at Mount Vernon Middle
School would gladly "dress the part" if parents and students would
agree in writing to have the students show up regularly, diligently
do their homework every night, study and learn those concepts they
don't understand, study for tests and do well even on those tests
(like the Stanford 9) that have no consequences for the student--and
that otherwise the students will have to be transferred from the
school.</TE>
<TE>   Marc Pollard</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A few months ago I asked my ninth- and 11th-grade students how
they felt about the way the teachers dress at our school. Dressing
nicely in a tie or a dress, they said, doesn't automatically make one
a "good teacher," nor does dressing casually necessarily make one a
"bad teacher." The majority of them added that they felt more
comfortable with teachers who dressed more as they do, in casual but
clean and neat clothing. Some commented that the teachers who wear
ties and dresses can make them feel alienated, so they tend to tune
them out.</TE>
<TE>   I thought my students' comments were perceptive and true. Getting
all teachers to dress respectably will probably be a small step in
the right direction toward improving our schools. But unless other,
more substantive issues are addressed by all the parties affected by
our low-performing schools, Supt. Roy Romer's dress code will be
nothing more than window dressing.</TE>

<LD>Re "A Reward Approach to North Korea," Commentary, May 3: James
Goodby argues that the only way to peace with hyper- totalitarian
North Korea is to gradually induce "societal change," but other than
the usual arms control negotiation methods there's nothing really in
his commentary stating how societal change would happen. The Clinton
administration tried for eight years to do this "all carrot, no
stick" approach, and what it brought was a perpetuation of Kim Jong
Il's Big Brother regime and a lot of weapons development programs
that went into hiding when the money showed up and came back out when
the money dried up.</LD>
<LD>   Most of us refer to this kind of behavior as extortion. Using a
carrot to get North Korea to stop developing weapons or reform its
own politics (or lack thereof) will never work because there is no
incentive on Kim's part to change. The "Dear Leader" is frankly not
interested in whether his people starve or if they have relations
with the outside world. He likes North Korean society the way it is
now, and the only thing that will ever really change that society
will be to get rid of this despicable despot. Everything else is just
talk.</LD>

<LD>Can't we get along? Ten years after the L.A. riots and the changes
have been minimal. There may not be people rioting in the streets
today; however, the combat rages on between whole communities, which
pit themselves against one another over so-called "quality of life"
issues: those in Orange County who refuse to pull their fair share in
the El Toro airport matter; residents of the hills of Encino who
don't want people traversing their neighborhood; communities that
overwhelmingly voted in favor of "three strikes" and yet refuse to
see a prison constructed near where they live.</LD>
<LD>   What is going on here? When are people going to realize that we
are not warring factions but people who have the same basic values
and beliefs? The love for one's children, the safety of one's
neighborhood, the desire to get home as quickly as possible after a
long day at work and the dislike of jet aircraft flying over one's
home are not determined by a person's level of income. Why not pull
your share for the benefit of all?</LD>

<DH>Cast and crew members of shows that are 'on the bubble'
have their antennae up, as they wait to see if their series will be
renewed.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Hollywood, where self-involvement, self-doubt and
contract-to-contract employment are facts of life, springtime brings
a fresh set of anxieties.</LD>
<LD>   The rest of America may spend these warm weeks gardening,
barbecuing and going to baseball games, but the casts and crews of
certain television programs are restless. Some smoke more, some eat
more, but they all stay close to the phone.</LD>
<LD>   Their shows are "on the bubble," which means their lives are on
hold until network television executives decide whether their series
will live or die.</LD>
<TE>   As this annual ritual plays out, thousands of bubble people wait
and worry about the outcome of this month's "pilot screenings"--a
kind of mini film festival in which each network checks out the new
crop of series prototypes competing for a slot on the prime-time
schedule.</TE>
<TE>   They can only wonder: Will one of those alluring new pilots bump
them off the air?</TE>
<TE>   The bubble shows--about 30 this year--float somewhere between
established hit and ratings flop, between already forgotten and
miraculous comeback story. Take "Everybody Loves Raymond," a CBS
sitcom that premiered in 1996. By the spring of 1997, it was
teetering on the bubble but eventually was renewed. The show
gradually blossomed into a major hit, ranking near the top of the
Nielsen Media Research ratings.</TE>
<TE>   This year, shows on the bubble include the award-winning ABC
sitcom "Spin City," the long-running CBS drama "Touched by an Angel,"
UPN's "The Hughleys" and Fox's lesser-known "Greg the Bunny," a
sitcom with a cast of humans and puppets.</TE>
<TE>   If the shows survive, each member of the cast and crew (typically,
between 100 and 150 people) can depend on 10 more months of
lucrative, high-profile work. If the bubble bursts? Most likely,
months of unemployment.</TE>
<TE>   The consequences of the process are easy to see in parts of a city
in which so many people work in the industry or live with someone who
does. By night, party talk is dominated by predictions of which shows
will be picked up and which won't. By day, crowds begin to form on
the wide, wooden staircase up to the Center for Yoga in the Larchmont
Village neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "A large percentage of our students are industry people. They are
more stressed out," said center owner Lisa Haase. "The actors are
running around to more auditions because they've got to land a part.
The people behind the scenes are silently tensed up because they're
waiting to see if their shows are getting picked up. It's part of the
industry. I think they all have that bittersweet feeling. There's a
part of them that wonders, 'What in the world am I doing this for?'"</TE>
<TE>   Across town, at the Burke Williams Day Spa &amp; Massage Center on
Sunset Boulevard, business has spiked as well in the past few weeks
for therapists servicing agents, directors and actors.</TE>
<TE>   At this time of year, the industry's unforgiving Greek chorus of
agents, publicists--even the guy handing you your latte--is
speculating about which new pilots flopped in screenings and which
"killed" (a good thing, in TV-speak). The talk is often misleading,
but it has the effect of compounding the collective anxiety.</TE>
<TE>   The pilot selection process, with the bubble shows waiting in its
wake, culminates next week during presentations in New York, where
more than $7 billion in advertising time is up for grabs.</TE>
<TE>   The networks will deliver a glitzy roll-out of their fall
prime-time lineup to advertisers who know the world can do without,
say, "Titus" if the Fox sitcom isn't reaching a large enough
demographic. Most parts of the ritual change little year to year, but
this season seems to be producing a bit more anxiety at the network
level, where an advertising slump has forced layoffs and
belt-tightening and left executives even more risk-averse than usual.
That could benefit some modestly rated series with a semblance of a
following.</TE>
<TE>   In any year, the mystery surrounding programming is unusually
class-blind for Hollywood, leaving handsomely paid producers and
stars facing the same gallows as technical personnel.</TE>
<TE>   This time around, those awaiting verdicts range from Steven
Bochco, co-creator and executive producer of the ABC legal drama
"Philly," to Pashelle L. Clayton, costume supervisor on the CBS drama
"The Education of Max Bickford." Bochco is a 58-year-old
multimillionaire producer and television kingpin behind the
long-running hit "NYPD Blue," while Clayton, 32, lives in an
apartment in Harlem.</TE>
<TE>   Both "Philly," shot in L.A., and "Max Bickford," which is shot in
New York, have earned some respectable reviews. But they are hardly
the ratings successes that guarantee renewal into another season--at
least, not until their networks can evaluate possible replacements.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always a kick in the gut," said Bochco, a veteran producer
who has seen his dramas die, unrenewed, after just one season.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the years, you start to realize you can't worry about the
parts of the business you don't control."</TE>
<TE>   For Clayton, an emotional survival technique is getting her
finances in order. She budgets her $70,000 salary over the course of
12 months should "Max Bickford" be canceled, and she squirrels away
enough money to carry her through to her next job.</TE>
<TE>   "This waiting each spring has been a way of life for me for 10
years," said Clayton, adding that she even has come to enjoy the
change that has taken her from series like Fox's "New York
Undercover" to feature films, including "The Hurricane."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone has reached her level of serenity, regardless of the
financial precautions taken. The worst bubble season 54-year-old
cinematographer Rodney Charters can remember occurred two years ago,
when NBC dropped "The Pretender." The show had been on the air four
seasons, a long enough run that the cast and crew thought they could
let their guard down.</TE>
<TE>   "Banks hate people in this business because we have no visible
means of support other than a contract, and an executive can [alter]
the destiny of 300 and 400 workers overnight," Charters said.</TE>
<TE>   For actors, especially, the bubble can present complications. Some
audition for roles on new series while their existing shows remain up
in the air. It's tricky footwork that can land the actor in a
producer's office wearing the scarlet letter of "second position,"
meaning the performer's eligibility for the new role is tied to the
fate of the current show. It doesn't have to be bad for actors. Just
ask Jennifer Aniston.</TE>
<TE>   She was co-starring in a CBS series, "Muddling Through," when she
landed the role of Rachel on NBC's "Friends" in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   CBS decided not to air "Muddling Through" until the summer, mere
weeks before "Friends" was scheduled to begin production. Had
"Muddling Through" exhibited ratings promise and CBS held Aniston to
her contract, the producers of "Friends" would have been forced to
recast the part.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, "Muddling Through" ran for less than two months.
"Friends" is due to begin its ninth season, paying its six stars,
including Aniston, roughly $25 million each, annually.</TE>
<TE>   "With the amount of pilots being done, you have to double up" on
actors, said CBS Television President Leslie Moonves, who--as the
then-chief of Warner Bros.--remembers fearing that Aniston's
involvement with "Friends" would be "dead meat" if initial ratings
for "Muddling Through" had been better.</TE>
<TE>   Actors Tom Everett Scott and Rick Hoffman, both 31, know the drill
well. The two previously co-starred in the Fox series "The $treet," a
much-hyped drama about youthful stockbrokers that was canceled after
just seven episodes. Both segued to Bochco's "Philly," in which they
play lawyers, and now find themselves hoping they won't be told a
second time that a network is dumping their show.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a little weight loss," said Hoffman, "an occasional
cigarette, an occasional drink and a lot of working out."</TE>
<TE>   His enthusiastic family back in New York may be adding to those
pangs of worry. They call every Wednesday morning and talk about the
show's performance the night before. Even his grandmother calls,
quoting the overnight ratings.</TE>
<TE>   "She says, 'Eleven, Twelve. That's not bad,'" he said, referring
to the show's decent but not stellar audience shares.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Scott--whose resume includes the films "That Thing You
Do!" and "Boiler Room"--relocated his family to a three-bedroom
rental house in the canyons for his second stab at a television
career. Even if "Philly" doesn't receive a second season, he won't
consider the experience a failure.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a successful show to me," he said. "I've never been on a
TV show that's gotten this far--it's guaranteed for 13 months."</TE>
<TE>   If it were only about the ratings, reading the tea leaves would be
simpler. Other factors, however, complicate the schedule-setting
process--particularly now, with vast media companies owning the
series they broadcast.</TE>
<TE>   At Fox, for instance, executives are still deciding whether to
renew the second-year sitcom "Titus," about a dysfunctional family
based on the life of series star Christopher Titus. The good news for
those involved is that "Titus," which has completed 54 episodes, is
produced by 20th Century Fox Television. The network ostensibly has
an interest in getting the series to about twice that number of
installments, because then its reruns could be sold into syndication.</TE>
<TE>   But after opening to mostly good reviews and ratings, "Titus"
appears to have run out of gas amid a slew of other
dysfunctional-family comedies on the air. The program's renewal will
hinge on those considerations, as well as how good the new pilots
are. Meanwhile, Stephan Olson, the show's production designer,
cleaned out his office in March, the weekend after the series wrapped
production.</TE>
<TE>   "The feeling was it would be so much more fair if we left knowing
[the show's fate], so we could plan our lives," Olson said. Staffers
"were told we'd be notified when the producers know. It's not as
though they know and aren't telling us. Nobody knows."</TE>
<TE>   Although Olson has a few potential backup possibilities if "Titus"
doesn't get picked up (he's worked on two pilots this spring,
including a CBS sitcom starring Nathan Lane), he has learned to
curtail his spending this time of year. A big vacation, for example,
is out of question.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't go to Europe," he said. "You go to Seattle."</TE>
<TE>   Or, if you're Ken Fink, you catch a few breaks and sit out this
bubble season.</TE>
<TE>   After 10 years of directing dramatic television and working on
shows such as "Homicide: Life on the Street" and "Millennium," Fink
took a chance last year as one of the directors of a new show, "CSI:
Crime Scene Investigation."</TE>
<TE>   It ended up becoming one of the most-watched programs on
television, which means he can sail through the tense bubble period
this year. The CBS show will not only run next season, but it has
also inspired a spinoff to be filmed in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "We're itinerants," Fink said of the TV lifers. "We're like
carnies with good teeth."</TE>
<TE>   This fall, he will become a "CSI" producer. He intends to spend
his break quietly with his wife, Beth, and their baby girl, Sophia.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice not to think about the phone ringing or wait to hear
from your agent where you stand," he said from their home near the
beach.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're on the bubble, you end up phoning friends and trying
to get a sense of who's getting grabbed. It's like high school--the
popular girls and boys are getting their invitation to the prom, and
you're waiting for yours."</TE>

<HD>Canadians Scour Tora Bora Area; No Sign of Bin Laden</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Ending a four-day sweep, troops bring back DNA
from a burial site.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Canadian troops of the U.S.-led coalition against terrorism explored
the caves and graves of the December battlefield in Tora Bora but
returned Tuesday with little expectation of resolving the mystery of
Osama bin Laden's whereabouts.</LD>
<LD>   The Canadian forces, backed by U.S. forensic experts, brought back
DNA samples from 23 bodies found at a burial site believed to hold
victims of the ferocious U.S. bombing during the campaign in the
mountains east of Jalalabad.</LD>
<LD>   "We did not find anybody who was 6 foot 5," said Canadian Capt.
Philip Nicholson, who directed the excavations at the end of a
four-day sweep through the rugged terrain. Pentagon officials thought
that Bin Laden, who is well over 6 feet tall, was directing the
resistance of his loyalists in December from a hide-out in the
region, but a search of caves at the time produced no evidence of the
exiled Saudi or his top lieutenants.</LD>
<TE>   Evidence of Shrine</TE>
<TE>   During their conduct of Operation Torii, one of a number of
searches being carried out in volatile eastern Afghanistan, soldiers
found evidence of a shrine to Islamic martyrs at Tora Bora.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. forensic experts from the Army criminal investigation
department assisted the Canadians in collecting the DNA samples. The
coalition hopes to identify some of those buried in the Tora Bora
grave, said Maj. Bryan Hilferty, spokesman for the U.S. forces at
Bagram. But he insisted that the objective of Operation Torii was to
rid the Al Qaeda terrorist network's mountain redoubt of any usable
shelter or supplies that might aid future guerrilla operations.</TE>
<TE>   "We were not looking for Bin Laden or a rotund little one-eyed man
either," Hilferty said, referring to Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed
Omar. "That was not the point of the mission."</TE>
<TE>   The 400 Canadian troops who took part in Operation Torii returned
here early Tuesday looking grubby and beleaguered, although a
spokesman for their unit insisted that morale was high and that they
felt the mission was a success, despite their having encountered
neither Taliban nor Al Qaeda forces.</TE>
<TE>   "Our mission was to conduct sensitive site exploitation and to
destroy underground facilities in mountainous eastern Afghanistan, in
order to deny Al Qaeda access to the area," Canadian navy Lt. Luc
Charron told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   While in the area, troops discovered a warren of caves that had
survived the December barrage except for a cave-in at the entrance.
Charron said the site was blown up and sealed to prevent access.</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of recent sightings of Bin Laden, accused by U.S.
officials of masterminding the Sept. 11 attacks, some observers have
speculated that he was killed during the intense bombardment in
December. Others believe that he and his lieutenants escaped across
the border to Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   In another area of eastern Afghanistan, which coalition officers
have declined to specify for security reasons, 1,000 troops have been
combing two facing mountain ranges and the valley between in search
of ammunition, food caches and other supplies that the suspected
terrorists might have left behind for future use.</TE>
<TE>   The British-led mission, known as Operation Snipe, is being
conducted in an area next to the March battlefield at Shahi Kot. U.S.
Special Forces clashed with Al Qaeda and Taliban troops in that
fight, leaving hundreds of the suspected terrorists and eight U.S.
soldiers dead.</TE>
<TE>   As of Tuesday, no enemy forces had been encountered yet in that
mission, which British Royal Marines spokesman Lt. Col. Paul
Harradine said was moving into a new phase after participants had
spent more than a week scaling the highest territory to conduct a
top-down search for holdouts.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Forces in Pakistan</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Special Forces also have deployed to lawless tribal areas of
Pakistan, just across the border from the regions now being searched
by the British, apparently in hopes of blocking the escape routes
used by Al Qaeda and the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   A Pakistani security team flew to Washington on Monday to work
with U.S. allies on a plan to tighten the 870-mile border cutting
through ethnic communities that straddle the Afghan-Pakistani divide.</TE>
<TE>   Taliban fighters also enjoy some local support in the rebellious
southeastern areas of this country, particularly in Paktia and Khowst
provinces, where warlords struggling to maintain their control over
traditional fiefdoms have rejected the authority of the interim
Afghan government headed by Prime Minister Hamid Karzai.</TE>

<HD>Chinese Airliner Plunges Into Sea; 112 Feared Dead</HD>
<DH>Disaster: Sixty-two bodies are recovered. The pilot had
reported a fire in the cabin.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>A Chinese airliner carrying 112 people crashed into the ocean off
China's northeastern coast late Tuesday, and all aboard were feared
dead.</LD>
<LD>   By early this morning, 62 bodies had been recovered from the Bo
Hai bay, where the plane, China Northern Airlines Flight 6136,
crashed just six miles shy of its destination, the official New China
News Agency said. The plane was nearing the port city of Dalian when
it plunged into the sea after the pilot reported a fire in the cabin.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of boats trawled the waters searching for the 50 people
still missing, but no one was expected to have survived.</LD>
<TE>   It was the second deadly crash of a Chinese airliner within a
month. On April 15, an Air China flight bound for Pusan, South Korea,
slammed into a foggy hillside outside the airport there, killing at
least 122 people. Six people remain unaccounted for.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's crash deals another setback to China's aviation
industry, which has tried hard to improve its image after a string of
accidents in the 1980s and '90s.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say safety has improved as China's domestic airlines
upgraded their fleets and strengthened pilot training, but the two
recent crashes are likely to spur greater efforts to increase safety
in a country where air travel, for business and leisure, is booming.</TE>
<TE>   President Jiang Zemin has ordered a government investigation of
Tuesday's crash, which occurred at the end of a weeklong national
holiday to celebrate May Day.</TE>
<TE>   The China Northern flight, with 103 passengers and nine crew
members, took off from Beijing at 8:37 p.m. Air traffic controllers
lost contact with the plane an hour later, several minutes before it
was scheduled to land at Dalian's Zhoushuizi airport.</TE>
<TE>   A witness on the ground in Dalian told the New China News Agency
that he saw the plane, its lights off, circle several times before
plummeting into the sea.</TE>
<TE>   Among the debris found in the water was a blackened, broken food
cart, "which indicates the seriousness of the fire," the news agency
said.</TE>
<TE>   The passengers were mostly Chinese residents of the Dalian area.
At least eight were foreigners, the news agency said.</TE>
<TE>   The plane was an MD-82 airliner, a twin-engine model first
manufactured by McDonnell Douglas before the company was absorbed by
Boeing. It is capable of carrying up to 172 passengers. Boeing's Web
site says 35 MD-80 series planes were assembled and are operating in
China.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, China has gone on a shopping spree for new
aircraft, mostly made by Boeing and Airbus Industrie.</TE>
<TE>   In October, Chinese aviation officials announced a $1.6-billion
contract with Boeing for an order of 30 planes.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to updating airline fleets, which include aging
Russian- and Chinese-made planes, the government has dedicated $1.2
billion to upgrading air-traffic control systems by 2010.</TE>
<TE>   Spending to improve safety began in earnest in the '90s after a
spate of deadly accidents. In 1992, 261 people died in three crashes.
China's worst air disaster occurred in 1994, when an airliner
exploded minutes after takeoff, killing 160 people.</TE>
<TE>   No fatalities were reported last year.</TE>
<TE>   Officials took pride in the fact that the country's flagship
airline, Air China, boasted an unblemished record. But that was
shattered by last month's crash of Flight 129. Although it was
raining at the time, pilot error may have been to blame for the
crash.</TE>

<HD>Church Standoff Deal Hits Snag</HD>
<DH>Siege: Italy is balking at taking in as exiles Palestinian
gunmen holed up in Bethlehem shrine. It says it had not been
consulted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS and MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>BETHLEHEM, West Bank</DL>
<LD>A deal reached Tuesday to resolve the 36-day standoff at the Church
of the Nativity stalled when the Italian government balked at
accepting more than a dozen Palestinian militants slated for exile.</LD>
<LD>   After weeks of tortuous negotiations, Israeli and Palestinian
officials said Tuesday morning that they had agreed that 13 militants
holed up inside the 4thcentury basilica would be banished to Italy.
An additional 26 would be sent to the Gaza Strip. The rest of the 123
Palestinians inside the church would be set free.</LD>
<LD>   But the Italian government issued a statement saying it had not
been consulted about the plan to send to its shores men labeled by
Israel as "senior terrorists."</LD>
<TE>   "There are still things to clarify: For example, in what capacity
would they come to Italy?" said Italian Defense Minister Antonio
Martino.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell telephoned
Martino's boss, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, in an effort to
placate the Italian government.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has pushed to resolve the dispute that has
kept Israeli troops in downtown Bethlehem since April 2. Israel has
said it will withdraw its forces from the city once the church
standoff is resolved, ending the massive military incursion launched
March 29 into Palestinian areas of the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon had hoped that the troops
would be pulled out before his meeting Tuesday at the White House
with President Bush. The two leaders met for more than an hour to
discuss Middle East peace prospects.</TE>
<TE>   But the group of gunmen, Palestinian security officers and
civilians who have been barricaded inside the church settled in
Tuesday for another night in the cavernous shrine.</TE>
<TE>   What began with a gun battle in Manger Square the day Israel
invaded the biblical city evolved into a tense, sometimes bloody
standoff that has attracted international attention and condemnation
for both sides.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians have been criticized for bearing arms inside a
Christian sanctuary and for allegedly coercing at least some
civilians and clerics to stay with them. Israel has been criticized
for ringing the church with troops, tanks, barricades and snipers, as
well as for both starving and picking off Palestinians inside the
compound over the weeks. The army has kept the city under military
curfew most of the time, bringing normal life to a standstill.</TE>
<TE>   Each side has accused the other of damaging the church's priceless
mosaics and frescoes.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday morning, that standoff seemed about to end.
Preparations got underway for the Palestinians, about 30 clerics, 10
international activists and Los Angeles Times photographer Carolyn
Cole to leave the church. Israeli troops dismantled a crane in Manger
Square that for weeks had served as a robotic sniper's nest, with
guns trained on the church compound. They erected police barricades
and metal detectors leading from Manger Square to the short wooden
Gate of Humility that serves as the church's front door.</TE>
<TE>   Buses pulled up to whisk the evacuees from the church. Some of
them were meant to be taken straight to Ben Gurion International
Airport and exile; others were to be dropped off in the Gaza Strip.
Palestinian negotiators allowed into the church handed out $250 each
to those destined for Italy and wads of Israeli shekels to the
Gaza-bound.</TE>
<TE>   Frantic relatives of gunmen scheduled for deportation violated the
curfew to descend on the square, hoping to catch a last glimpse
before their family members were whisked into an exile of uncertain
duration. Many said they were disappointed that Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat had agreed to send away the fighters, a
punishment fraught with dire symbolism for Palestinians, many of whom
have lived in exile for generations.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if they die of hunger in there, they shouldn't agree to
this," said Jehan Samed, a 12-year-old who began to weep as she
explained that several uncles and cousins, whom she described as
activists in Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction, were to be deported.</TE>
<TE>   The group of relatives argued with soldiers who tried to shoo them
from the barricades.</TE>
<TE>   "We just want to say hello from afar!" one woman screamed at a
soldier. "Even if we can't embrace them, we just need to say hello
from afar!"</TE>
<TE>   But as the hours dragged on, the church's door remained tightly
closed. On Tuesday afternoon, the Italian Foreign Ministry issued a
statement saying it had not agreed to accept what it described as the
"Palestinian terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army confirmed that there was a hitch.</TE>
<TE>   "We have reached an agreement to resolve the crisis of the Church
of the Nativity," Lt. Col. Olivier Rafowicz told reporters in Manger
Square. "We intend to implement the agreement. The implementation has
been delayed because no country is willing to accept the terrorists.
We are waiting for progress."</TE>
<TE>   A source close to the negotiations confirmed Tuesday night that
Italy remained the most likely destination for the gunmen who are to
be exiled. The Italians, he said, were insulted that the negotiations
had taken place without their being consulted, but he added that they
most probably could be persuaded to accept the militants.</TE>
<TE>   Another sticking point had arisen, however, the source said: the
fate of rifles and other guns the Palestinians were to hand over
before leaving the church. The Palestinian Authority was demanding
the return of weapons carried legally by police and other security
officers in the church. Israel was resisting that demand.</TE>
<TE>   And there were signs that the deal--brokered by the CIA, a
representative of the European Union, the Israelis and the
Palestinian Authority--would be politically costly for Arafat, who
already is facing growing calls from both his own people and the
international community to reform his administration.</TE>
<TE>   "I prefer to die rather than accepting deportation," Abdulaziz
Rantisi, a spokesman for the militant Islamic movement Hamas, said in
an interview with Al Jazeera, an Arab satellite television network.
"I spoke with the besieged people, and I told them that I prefer to
be cut in pieces rather than accepting deportation." Rantisi
described the agreement to end the church standoff as "a big
disaster."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview published Tuesday in the Palestinian newspaper Al
Quds, Palestinian negotiator Mahmoud Abbas said Israel's invasion of
the West Bank had caused "complete political, military, security and
media chaos" for the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Abbas said the Palestinian leadership is debating the need to
radically reform its institutions and hold elections soon. He said
that Israel's invasion was a "political disaster" for the
Palestinians and that without drastic reforms, they would be unable
to "confront the political, security, media and economic battles"
that lie ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to stop and ask ourselves why all this happened and what
next?" Abbas said.</TE>
<TE>   Curtius reported from Jerusalem and Magnier from Bethlehem. Times
staff writers Tracy Wilkinson and Carolyn Cole in Bethlehem
contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Clinton Joining Trip to East Timor</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Sources say Bush has asked him to attend
ceremonies marking independence, which he supported.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Middle East it's not. But former President Clinton has been asked
to go to East Timor in what would be his first official role for the
government since leaving the White House almost 16 months ago.</LD>
<LD>   At the request of President Bush, Clinton has agreed to join an
American delegation participating in a May 20 celebration marking
East Timor's independence from Indonesia, according to sources who
spoke on condition of anonymity.</LD>
<LD>   "They asked him over a month ago," a source close to Clinton said
Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   As part of the trip, Clinton is expected to attend the
inauguration of Jose Alexandre "Xanana" Gusmao, East Timor's
president-elect.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton played an important role in East Timor's road to freedom.
After the Indonesian province voted for independence in 1999,
triggering an outbreak of violence by pro-Indonesia militia, Clinton
persuaded the United Nations to send peacekeeping troops to restore
calm.</TE>
<TE>   The invitation from the Bush White House, extended by National
Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, was reported Tuesday by USA Today.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer did not confirm or deny
the report. Asked about Clinton's participation, he said: "There will
be an event in East Timor. The United States will be sending a
bipartisan delegation to attend. And it is not at the point yet where
I can say something formal. Once it is a formal statement, I will be
happy to issue it."</TE>
<TE>   Since leaving the White House, Clinton has traveled widely around
the United States and the world, helping Democrats raise money and
making speeches, being paid as much as $300,000 per talk. He is also
working on development of his presidential library in Little Rock,
Ark., as well as writing a book for a reported $12 million.</TE>
<TE>   But Clinton has made it clear that he desires to remain active in
public affairs. And last week he was in Los Angeles discussing with
NBC television officials the possibility of a talk show of his own.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's overture is seen as something of a peace offering to
Clinton. Recently, Bush tacitly criticized his predecessor for
hosting a Middle East summit in 2000 that collapsed, suggesting that
its failure played a part in the resumption of violence.</TE>
<TE>   It is hardly unheard-of for former presidents to be sent on
diplomatic missions, although they tend to be ceremonial in nature.</TE>
<TE>   In July 1999, Clinton invited former President George Bush to fly
with him on Air Force One to Morocco to attend the funeral of King
Hassan II.</TE>

<HD>2 Pupils Die, 20 Hurt as Pickup Plows Into Ceremony at

<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>MEXICO CITY -- After months of complaining that a preschool's daily
flag ceremony blocked access to his house, a man raced his pickup
truck into a crowd of toddlers gathered in a quiet street outside
Mexico City, killing two children and injuring about 20 others.</LD>
<LD>   Jose Luis Nieto, a 56-year-old mechanic who lived near the school,
was arrested. He admitted carrying out the attack Monday in Ecatepec,
saying that he had wanted to hurt one of the teachers.</LD>
<LD>   An amateur video shows a man who appears to be Nieto trying to
talk to adults watching the flag ceremony.</LD>
<TE>   The footage shows him climbing into his pickup, backing up briefly
and ramming the truck full force into the crowd of about 100 children
and teachers, dragging several bodies down the street.</TE>
<TE>   Moments before, children wearing colorful soldiers' uniforms
marched with the Mexican flag while others watched or banged on
drums.</TE>
<TE>   The crash killed 2-year-old Ariadna Martinez and 3-year-old
Rodrigo Reyes. Several adults and about 20 other children, including
a 4-month-old baby, were injured, some severely, police said.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with local TV stations, Nieto admitted driving the
truck.</TE>

<HD>Oil Barrels Fuel Baghdad's Clout in Region</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Iraq's key commodity has enabled Hussein to offset
U.S. diplomatic power and thwart efforts to end his ironfisted rule.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>Old, rusted trucks barrel through the desert with a value far in
excess of the price their cargo will fetch. Inside is cheap oil,
produced in Iraq and bound for Jordan. The traffic is heavy at times,
and the tankers look like a pipeline when they wait bumper to bumper
at the border.</LD>
<LD>   But these trucks are really a tether that binds Jordan, a strong
U.S. ally, to its Persian Gulf neighbor. Jordan pays half-price for
the oil, an exemption allowed the financially strapped kingdom under
the international trade embargo imposed on Iraq nearly a dozen years
ago.</LD>
<LD>   Economic sanctions have failed to end the ironfisted rule of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, and now the United States is trying to
build a military alliance to topple a man who it says is a threat to
the region.</LD>
<TE>   Those coalition-building efforts have been frustrated by Iraq,
which has used oil--and the wealth it generates--as one weapon in an
arsenal to offset U.S. diplomatic power. Iraq wins support on the
streets of Arab lands by supporting the Palestinian cause, but it
earns the backing of the region's leaders through its economic and
political clout.</TE>
<TE>   "Iraqi oil wealth, of course, has been tremendous muscle for us
locally and internationally," said Saadalla Fathi, who retired last
month after many years as an advisor to Iraq's Oil Ministry. "There
is no doubt about this."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have seemed perplexed, if not openly frustrated, by
the world's refusal to go along with its desire to depose Hussein,
who over the last two decades has waged war with Iran, invaded Kuwait
and has been accused of using chemical weapons against his own people
and developing weapons of mass destruction. At the very least,
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has said, "the people of Iraq and
the people of the region would be better off with a different regime
in Baghdad."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials assert that although Iraq's neighbors publicly
reject the military option, privately they assure the Bush
administration that they would support a regime change.</TE>
<TE>   At the United Nations, meanwhile, the five permanent members of
the Security Council proposed a resolution Monday that they say will
strengthen and streamline the import controls imposed on Iraq. The
resolution should be adopted this week without substantive
modification, according to diplomats from Singapore, which currently
holds the rotating council presidency. Many people in and around the
Middle East fear that a U.S. military operation would come at their
expense; that a weak Iraq would be torn apart, damaging not only its
neighbors' economic health but possibly their internal stability as
well. There is a general attitude that it is better to stick with
Hussein than to risk something even worse.</TE>
<TE>   "Unlike Afghanistan, which was in disarray, Iraq has never been in
disarray," said Tahseen Bashir, a retired Egyptian diplomat who lives
in Cairo. "To kill Saddam Hussein is possible, but then what do you
do next?"</TE>
<TE>   By clever economic maneuvering, Iraq has nurtured the idea that
the choice is either Hussein or chaos.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to subsidizing Jordan's economy with cheap oil,
Baghdad has awarded lucrative contracts to Turkey, a member of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization; signed free-trade agreements with
more than half a dozen of Iraq's neighbors; and signed an oil
development deal with Russia.</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, Turkey's contracts under the United
Nations-administered "oil-for-food" program--which allows the sale of
Iraqi oil to raise money for purchasing food and medicine for the
Persian Gulf nation--have doubled to nearly $1billion. Those Turkish
revenues might evaporate with the fall of Hussein's regime.</TE>
<TE>   The Hussein regime also has played on the ethnic and religious
fears of its neighbors, in effect arguing that a stable Iraq,
regardless of the government in power, is better than a country that
is breaking apart. Many in the region have bought into the idea that
a strong Iraq will rein in separatist Kurds, an ethnic group that
spans several neighboring countries and populates the northern part
of Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq has also served as a Sunni Muslim bulwark against Islam's
other main branch, Shiite, which dominates the Iranian government.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's neighbors also worry about the degree of U.S. commitment to
the region. If American troops invade and crush what is left of the
Iraqi military, or get it to support a coup against Hussein, what
happens then? Does the U.S. military stick around and, if so, for how
long? What is the endgame? These are the questions the Bush
administration has been unable--or so far unwilling--to answer to the
satisfaction of many of Iraq's neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   "No one supports Saddam," said a diplomat based in Baghdad.
"Syria. Egypt. Saudi Arabia. Kuwait. But this is a complex situation
that is hard to solve by a military operation."</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest uncertainties casting a pall over a
U.S. military option involves Iraq's 24 million people. No one knows
whether they will rally to the defense of their leader.</TE>
<TE>   Ambassadors and Iraqi analysts say U.S. intelligence agencies have
so far failed to organize an opposition in Iraq. That is partly
because of the nature of the regime, which uses fear as a device to
rule. Phone lines are tapped. Neighbors are rewarded for spying on
one another.</TE>
<TE>   But it also is widely held in Iraq that most of its people have an
aversion to the U.S. government. Even a few people willing to say
privately that they would like a new Iraqi regime maintain that
international sanctions dating to 1990 have only strengthened the
current leadership.</TE>
<TE>   There is another factor that local analysts say American
policymakers should not discount: Arab pride.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an element of dignity and pride. You have to understand
that in discussing Iraq," said Wamidh Nadhmi, a political scientist
with Baghdad University. "Why should Iraq accept a puppet regime put
in by tanks? I don't consider myself an enemy of America, but I don't
see it is America's right to impose a regime on me."</TE>
<TE>   This uncertainty has fed into fears about the future integrity of
Iraq. Nations such as Saudi Arabia and Turkey are nervous that their
neighbor will come apart at the seams.</TE>
<TE>   All of this hand-wringing has many people here reading between the
lines, trying to divine what the Bush administration has in store.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir, the retired Egyptian diplomat, said he believes the U.S.
is intentionally not talking about taking out the ruling Arab Baath
Socialist Party--a sign, he said, that Washington wants to leave that
institution in place to control and unify the country if Hussein
falls. But if that is being considered, few here give such a move
much chance of succeeding. Hussein rules the party the way he has
ruled Iraq since coming to power.</TE>
<TE>   "If somebody is thinking of using the party against the leader, it
is a big mistake," said a European diplomat based here. "Those
disloyal are severely punished, and those loyal are richly rewarded.
Military guys get good plots of land near the water. Even lower
officers are rewarded with a new cars."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer William Orme at the United Nations contributed

<HD>16 Die in Suicide Attack in Israel</HD>

<DL>RISHON LE ZION, Israel</DL>
<LD>A Palestinian with a large bomb strapped to his waist blew himself up
inside a crowded pool hall here Tuesday night, police said, killing
at least 15 Israelis and ravaging U.S. efforts to push Israelis and
Palestinians into peace talks.</LD>
<LD>   More than 50 people were injured in the blast, which coincided
with a meeting in Washington between Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon and President Bush. Sharon cut short the trip and was to head
home to plan Israel's response, which likely will target Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat.</LD>
<LD>   The force of the explosion split the facade from the three-story
building in a gritty industrial neighborhood of this city just south
of Tel Aviv and collapsed the ceiling of the top floor.</LD>
<TE>   Rescue teams scoured the wreckage in search of victims believed
buried in the rubble. Wounded people staggered, moaning and crying,
from the Sheffield Snooker Club and Cafeteria. The Palestinian man
apparently detonated his nail-studded bomb at the entrance of the
club after taking an elevator to the third floor.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of ambulances converged on the site, and two construction
cranes were positioned above the wreckage to remove bodies.
Floodlights from hovering helicopters illuminated the scene as a body
could be seen being pulled from the rubble and lowered to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   More than three hours after the attack, medics placed a body into
a white vinyl bag at the still chaotic site and loaded it into an
ambulance. Dozens of rescue workers crunched on tiny shards of glass
that lay in a thick carpet in the parking lot. Cars parked there were
wrecked by the force of the blast, their frames twisted and windows
pulverized.</TE>
<TE>   "People were screaming. People were calling for their friends they
could not find. One woman would not stop screaming that her friend
had died," said David Tabakuli, 42, a salesman who was on his way
home when the bomber hit. The explosion was so powerful that he
thought his car had been rear-ended by a truck.</TE>
<TE>   He summed up the deep hopelessness that has seized many people in
Israel: "It must stop. But if there is no talk, then it's the guns
that will talk."</TE>
<TE>   Across the street, Yossi Dvir, 38, shook his head as he leaned
over a police barricade, surveying the destruction. He knew this
would be coming, Dvir said.</TE>
<TE>   "How many people did we kill" in the West Bank during the invasion
the Israeli army launched March 29, he asked. "Now they will revenge,
the Arabs, they will revenge their brothers and sisters. They are
coming here, and this is not the end."</TE>
<TE>   The radical Islamic Hamas organization claimed responsibility for
the bombing, according to a Lebanese television station. In Gaza
City, spokesmen for Hamas, which opposes any Palestinian negotiation
with Israel, did not immediately confirm the group's role but said
the bombing was a "natural reaction to Israel's war crimes."</TE>
<TE>   Israel, however, blamed Arafat and said the attack--the first
fatal suicide bombing in nearly four weeks after a relentless barrage
in March--proved that the army's massive West Bank offensive, in
which Palestinian cities were wrecked and hundreds of Palestinian men
were detained, did not go far enough.</TE>
<TE>   Future retaliation is certain to target Arafat, Israeli analysts
said. Sharon's government has been steadily building a case against
the Palestinian leader, attempting to implicate him directly in
terrorism to justify his eventual deportation. Sharon steadfastly
refuses to deal with him, and a new outbreak of violence will provide
the justification for attacking Arafat directly, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli security officials speculated that the snooker-club
bomber, though not immediately identified, probably came from the
Gaza Strip. The recent offensive, with the stated goal of rooting out
"terrorist infrastructure," focused on the West Bank and left Gaza
relatively untouched.</TE>
<TE>   After invading West Bank cities and towns, Israeli forces remain
only in Bethlehem, where a standoff at the Church of the Nativity
continued to elude resolution early today.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears we pulled out too soon," Public Security Minister Uzi
Landau said Tuesday as he rushed to the site of the bombing. "Most of
the work is still ahead of us. This is like putting out a brush fire:
If you don't finish and [you] leave embers, the fire will rekindle.
This is what is happening now."</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian Authority, in an unusually strongly worded
statement, referred to suicide bombings as "terrorist crimes" and
threatened to "take firm and strict measures against those who are
involved in this operation." Arafat's government said it "will not be
light-handed in punishing those who have caused great harm to our
cause."</TE>
<TE>   The snooker club was a popular hangout for teens but also
attracted older Israelis who played its slot machines for 1 shekel a
turn. It did not have a guard, police said, despite new laws
requiring entertainment establishments to hire security in the wake
of suicide bombings that have killed dozens of Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Patrons never imagined that a guard would be necessary. Rishon Le
Zion has remained relatively free of the attacks that have plagued
other parts of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "It [the club] was the sort of place where everyone knew everyone
else," said Alik Moshiashzili, 33, a clothing warehouse manager. "It
was small. We all knew each other, and nobody believed that something
like this could happen in a place like this."</TE>
<TE>   The government will almost certainly retaliate in great force.
Earlier Tuesday, army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz told a
parliamentary committee that the next wave of Palestinian attacks
would unleash an offensive even more punishing than the one just
concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon also will come under intense domestic pressure to crack
down. Israeli television Tuesday night gave split-screen coverage to
Sharon's meeting with Bush on one side and the scenes of the latest
carnage live from Rishon Le Zion on the other side.</TE>
<TE>   "The need for Palestinian reforms is now obvious," said Interior
Minister Eli Yishai, who was traveling with Sharon. "It is more and
more apparent, even without this, there is simply no one to talk to."</TE>
<TE>   By "reforms," Yishai and other members of the Sharon government
are believed to mean an elimination of Arafat from the Palestinian
leadership and replacement of the current regime with a more
cooperative and less corrupt one.</TE>
<TE>   In his meeting with Sharon, Bush was able to "register his disgust
at this wanton taking of innocent life," said White House National
Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice.</TE>
<TE>   Bush was effusive in his praise for and support of Sharon and
echoed the Israeli leader almost to the word in his criticism of the
Palestinian Authority and demands that it change its ways. Israeli
television journalists traveling with Sharon said Bush sounded as
though he belonged to an Israeli government public relations team.</TE>

<HD>Bus Explosion in Pakistan Kills at Least 10 Foreigners</HD>
<DH>Violence: Car bomb is blamed in the suspected terrorist
attack. Most of the victims were Germans on their way to work,
officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>A powerful bomb blast early today bent a Pakistan navy tour bus in
half and killed at least 10 foreign workers outside a major hotel in
the city center.</LD>
<LD>   The blast appeared to be caused by a car bomb. The twisted remains
of a vehicle landed a block away, along with body parts of what was
believed to be the bomber, said Randall Bennett, chief of security at
the U.S. Consulate here.</LD>
<LD>   If confirmed to be a terrorist act, it would be a
serious escalation in a city long known for sectarian violence,
kidnappings and killings, but not for bombings that target foreigners.</LD>
<TE>   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing, which
occurred in front of the high-rise Sheraton Hotel and Towers, a
popular hotel for foreign businesspeople.</TE>
<TE>   The list of possible suspects is long in this hotbed of religious
and political violence where American journalist Daniel Pearl, South
Asia bureau chief for the Wall Street Journal, was kidnapped and
killed this year while investigating terrorist links.</TE>
<TE>   The trial of his alleged killers, including British-born Islamic
militant Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, resumed Tuesday after several
delays, including a change of venue because the prosecution team said
it had been threatened.</TE>
<TE>   Rahim Khan, the area deputy superintendent of police, said he
believed that most of the victims of today's blast were Germans who
were on their way to work at the Karachi port.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett said he doubted that any Americans were on the bus.</TE>
<TE>   The bombing occurred about 7:45 a.m., leaving a crater in the
street about 2 yards across and a few feet deep, Bennett said. A hand
lay about 20 yards from the twisted remains of the bus.</TE>
<TE>   The blast was so strong that it threw the bus several feet onto
the sidewalk, blew out its roof and shattered windows in surrounding
buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Waiters from the hotel coffee shop directly in front of blast site
crawled into the wreckage to pull out survivors and the dead. Their
white aprons soaked in blood, they handed limp corpses down from
broken windows.</TE>
<TE>   One waiter carried a dead bus passenger on his back and dropped
him onto a waiting gurney that was then pushed into an ambulance.</TE>
<TE>   Tina Baker, a Briton in Karachi on business, said she left her
third-floor room in the Sheraton immediately before the bomb went off
and was standing by the elevator "when there was this enormous bang."</TE>
<TE>   "I could feel the pressure of the air move, and then all this dust
started coming down. It blew the lock out of my room door," said
Baker, 33. "I can't even get back into it. The room next door is
pretty much a mess."</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Quinn, another Briton, said his company had put workers up
in the Sheraton because it was considered well-protected.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn, who was in the hotel coffee shop having breakfast when the
bomb detonated, said several people were injured by flying glass.
None of those he saw appeared seriously wounded, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was quite surreal," said Quinn, 46, of Chester,
England, who is working in Karachi for an Italian oil company. "There
was glass and debris and smoke, and people were just falling down. It
knocked me onto the floor, but it took me several seconds to realize it
was a bomb."</TE>
<TE>   A Karachi businessman, who was jogging in the hotel's fitness club
when the blast occurred, rushed to the wreckage and helped rescue
survivors. He lifted at least two people who were alive from the bus,
which he said was carrying about 15 people. The survivors could still
speak but were severely injured, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The businessman, whose T-shirt and shorts were smeared with blood,
asked not to be identified. He feared retaliation for helping victims
of an apparent terrorist strike.</TE>
<TE>   The bus was making its regular trip from the hotel to the port, a
journey it made each morning after picking up European workers, said
Khan, the police officer.</TE>
<TE>   The bombing is another embarrassment to Pakistani President Pervez
Musharraf, an army general who calls the port city home and has
promised to eradicate terrorism in the country.</TE>
<TE>   It is also likely to be a blow to the country's economy. Karachi
is a busy commercial center, and even with its long reputation for
violence, the foreign businesspeople have kept coming because
foreigners are rarely targeted.</TE>
<TE>   Four American workers with the Union Texas Petroleum company and
their Pakistani driver were slain by two gunmen in 1997 as they drove
from the Sheraton hotel to their office in Karachi's port.</TE>
<TE>   In that attack, gunmen in a car blocked the oil company's station
wagon and fired into it. A Pakistani anti-terrorism court convicted
two men in the case and sentenced them to death. The men are
appealing their convictions.</TE>
<TE>   Baker, still stunned by today's blast, wasn't sure what to do
next.</TE>
<TE>   "We were obviously concerned about coming here to start with, but
we were guaranteed--as much as you can be guaranteed--that everything
was fine. And it didn't look like much trouble to me," said Baker,
who works in the textile industry.</TE>
<TE>   Less than half an hour after the attack, as bodies were being
pulled out of the destroyed bus, she still hadn't decided whether to
leave Karachi.</TE>
<TE>   "Your first reaction is always, 'I just want to go home,'" she
said. "But we'll have a strong coffee and think about it."</TE>

<HD>A Cell Phone Left for Dead Saved His Life</HD>
<DH>Canada: Steven Stacey, hurt and far from help, found
salvation in his glove compartment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>VANCOUVER, Canada</DL>
<LD>A man who spent last weekend at the bottom of a steep embankment
after a car crash that broke his back was saved by a deactivated cell
phone that still allowed him to call 911.</LD>
<LD>   Steven Stacey, 48, lost control of his car Friday night on a rural
road near Quesnel in central British Columbia.</LD>
<LD>   His vehicle plunged down an embankment and landed upside-down
nearly 80 feet from the road.</LD>
<TE>   Stacey found himself suspended by his seat belt.</TE>
<TE>   "It took me five hours to get the seat belt off," Stacey said from
his bed at a hospital in Quesnel, where he is being treated for
severe hypothermia, dehydration and several fractures. "I tried to
burn it with my cigarette lighter."</TE>
<TE>   Stacey spent the first night in the car, using a seat cover like a
sleeping bag.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next two nights, a snowstorm dropped about 8 inches of
wet snow on the overturned car.</TE>
<TE>   When he was conscious, he cried for help. But no one heard him. By
Saturday, he tried to crawl up the embankment. His injuries forced
him back down.</TE>
<TE>   Stacey has lived in the area for 18 years but, unemployed and with
no family living nearby, he knew that no one would miss him.</TE>
<TE>   He survived by eating ice.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a godsend to have something wet," Stacey said.</TE>
<TE>   It was Sunday when he remembered his old, deactivated cell phone,
locked in the glove compartment. He'd bought a new one Friday, but it
wasn't working yet.</TE>
<TE>   But breaking into the glove compartment proved difficult because
of his injuries.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he had the phone out and was attempting a 911 call, it
was dawn Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The emergency feature still worked. He reached an operator, who
told him to call back in five minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "But then my phone went dead," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes, he heard sirens, but they were searching too far
away.</TE>
<TE>   He tried the phone again and reached an operator who directed the
rescuers to him.</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Lindsay, the hospital's nursing unit coordinator, said
Stacey broke his lower back, ribs and breastbone.</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. Gary Clark-Marlow said Stacey was extraordinarily lucky to
survive the crash, let alone his ordeal.</TE>

<HD>Dutch to Vote Despite Assassination</HD>
<DH>Politics: The slaying of an anti-immigrant candidate will
not prevent balloting for Parliament. But parties will not campaign.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AMSTERDAM</DL>
<LD>Dutch leaders agreed Tuesday to go ahead with parliamentary elections
next week, as thousands grieved for assassinated anti-immigration
candidate Pim Fortuyn.</LD>
<LD>   Police were questioning a 32-year-old white Dutchman caught with a
pistol minutes after Fortuyn was gunned down Monday in the parking
lot of a radio station after giving an interview.</LD>
<LD>   In Rotterdam, where his upstart party stunned the nation when it
captured more than 35% of the vote in local elections less than two
months ago, thousands of people laid flowers and lighted candles
outside Fortuyn's home.</LD>
<TE>   Hundreds of supporters of the openly gay politician waited hours
to sign a condolence log at City Hall. In the evening, tens of
thousands marched silently through the center of Rotterdam to honor
Fortuyn.</TE>
<TE>   After meeting with officials from Fortuyn's party, the government
announced that general elections will be held as planned May 15, but
the parties agreed not to campaign. Pim Fortuyn's List, the party
named for its charismatic founder, said the slain candidate's name
would remain at the top of its ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Fortuyn, an academic and former columnist, was shot at least five
times after leaving the radio station in Hilversum, southeast of
Amsterdam. Police said the gunman apparently acted alone.</TE>
<TE>   The Dutch media, constrained by the custom that prevents naming
criminal suspects, identified him as Volkert van der G., married and
with one child. News reports said the attacker worked for a group
called Environment Offensive. Police said investigators found
ammunition at the suspect's home matching a shell casing at the crime
scene. The suspect is from Harderwijk, about 35 miles east of
Amsterdam. He made no statement to police and was to make a first
court appearance in Amsterdam today.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Wim Kok led a moment of silence in the upper house
of Parliament, and every party denounced the killing as a threat to
the country's democracy.</TE>
<TE>   The effect of Fortuyn's death on the election was uncertain. Some
analysts predicted a broad sympathy vote for Fortuyn's party, which
was cobbled together just three months after he was expelled from
another party for an abusive attack on Muslim immigrants in a
newspaper interview.</TE>
<TE>   Others said the party has no ideology and no leader to hold it
together with Fortuyn dead.</TE>
<TE>   Many Dutch said the killing, the first political assassination in
modern Dutch history, was a jolt to the self-image of a nation of 16
million that saw itself as more sensible, better organized and less
violent than others.</TE>

<HD>Bombing Sends Sharon Home</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: 'The battle will continue,' the Israeli premier
vows angrily in Washington after receiving news of the attack near
Tel Aviv.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG and ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon failed Tuesday to
narrow their major differences over moving the Middle East toward
peace, and the Israeli leader cut short his U.S. visit to return home
following a new suicide bombing near Tel Aviv.</LD>
<LD>   The attack occurred shortly after the prime minister entered the
Oval Office for his meeting with Bush, who is trying to edge Israelis
and Palestinians toward peace. But an angry Sharon indicated Tuesday
night that his nation may launch further military action in response
to the first suicide bombing in nearly four weeks.</LD>
<LD>   "Our work is not done," Sharon said at a hastily called news
conference here. "The battle will continue until all those who
believe that they can make gains through the use of terrorism will
cease to exist."</LD>
<TE>   "Israel will not surrender to blackmail," he said. "He who rises
up to kill us, we will preempt him and kill him first."</TE>
<TE>   The bombing underscored not just the fragility of peace efforts in
the Middle East but also how readily diplomatic momentum can be
reversed.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Bush and Sharon were unable to bridge gaps in U.S. and
Israeli policy, their meeting created a positive tenor because Bush
agreed to send CIA Director George J. Tenet back to the region to
help rebuild a Palestinian security force.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Sharon agreed on the need to make the Palestinian
Authority more democratic and less threatening. "We emphasized ...
the need for reform in the Palestinian Authority, and I think that's
very important," Sharon said as he and Bush chatted with reporters
after their meeting.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, Arab leaders have scheduled several meetings over
the next five days in an effort to build momentum toward peace in the
troubled region.</TE>
<TE>   But as night fell, any suggestion of optimism was lost in Sharon's
angry response as he prepared to fly home.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon did not mention Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat but said
the bombing offered "proof of the true intentions of the person
leading the Palestinian Authority." He also termed the Palestinian
administration a "terrorist and corrupt entity."</TE>
<TE>   And Sharon clearly moved to scuttle any new U.S. effort to
pressure him into reviving the peace process. He said there was "no
way to move forward on the political process" with the Palestinian
Authority.</TE>
<TE>   The prime minister said he had not consulted with Bush or Vice
President Dick Cheney about what course Israel would follow after the
latest attack, which left at least 15 Israelis and the bomber dead at
a pool hall in the town of Rishon Le Zion.</TE>
<TE>   The visit was Sharon's fifth with the president since Bush took
office. In December, the prime minister returned home abruptly from
Washington after suicide attacks in Jerusalem and the port city of
Haifa and a shooting in the Gaza Strip killed more than two dozen
people, many of them teenagers, and injured nearly 200. Tuesday's
bombing was timed, suggested Geoffrey Kemp, a former Reagan
administration Mideast specialist, to demonstrate to Sharon, Bush and
Arafat that the terrorist campaign "is not in any way over."</TE>
<TE>   Kemp said it reinforced Sharon's argument that security issues
must be his top priority before joining longer-range political
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   But Kemp said it also demonstrated "the need for a radical new
political approach that is going to be acceptable to the Palestinians
and Arabs as well as the Israelis."</TE>
<TE>   King Abdullah II of Jordan is in Washington to meet with Bush
today, and the attack cast a pall on the monarch's delegation. A
senior official traveling with the king said the Jordanians were
"deeply depressed" by the attack and its implications for peace
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout Tuesday, the White House had cautioned against
expecting the Bush-Sharon meeting to produce a breakthrough. Rather,
the meeting and other recent sessions Bush has had with Middle East
leaders were presented as part of a lengthy and continuing process.</TE>
<TE>   And the two leaders did not react immediately to the bombing;
their brief joint news conference in the Oval Office came after they
met for 70 minutes but before either had been given more than a
cursory report on the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to reporters with Sharon at his side, Bush renewed his
call for Arab leaders to pressure the Palestinians to seek a peaceful
solution to their differences with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The president, who spoke by telephone with Crown Prince Abdullah
of Saudi Arabia and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt before the
meeting with Sharon, said: "If people truly want there to be peace,
people have to assume their responsibilities for peace. And the
Saudis must do that, and they're willing to do that."</TE>
<TE>   He said he had made clear to the crown prince, the de facto ruler
of Saudi Arabia, "that he and the other leaders must work and must
convince the Palestinian Authority that they have got to do
everything in their power to lead toward a solution."</TE>
<TE>   "Our job is to convince the Saudis, the Jordanians, the Egyptians
that these reforms are absolutely necessary," Bush said. "And when I
say people have got responsibilities, I'm not just saying the
Israelis and the Palestinians have responsibilities. I'm saying these
leaders."</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Sharon appeared amiable. The president referred to the
prime minister as "my friend" and "Ariel," and the prime minister
smiled repeatedly. However, they did not mask the depth of the
differences between their countries.</TE>
<TE>   Bush referred to "Palestine," a word that makes Sharon bristle.
Sharon's strategy calls for a series of interim steps toward an
independent Palestinian state; Bush and many Arab leaders would like
to accelerate efforts toward that goal.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli leader pressed his case with Bush, urging small steps
that would lead to a security arrangement with the Palestinian
Authority. This, one official said, would indefinitely delay creation
of an independent state.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon pointedly referred to a "regional" conference, rather than
an international gathering envisioned by the White House. He prefers
a meeting with Arab leaders, but not Arafat, that would focus on a
limited agenda. Security would be at the top.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his own disdain for Arafat, Bush has been trying to
persuade Israel to accept the Palestinian leader as the elected
representative of the Palestinian people. The U.S., the United
Nations, the European Union and Russia, the so-called quartet now
sponsoring the peace process, accept him as such.</TE>
<TE>   Arab Talks in Cairo</TE>
<TE>   Seen as Next Step</TE>
<TE>   The next step appears to be a meeting Thursday in Cairo of foreign
ministers from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Morocco,
Yemen, Bahrain and the Palestinian Authority. They are planning to
debate how the Arab world can generate progress and to prepare for a
conference of the leaders of Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria with
Arafat in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheik this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is focused on repairing some of the damage
inflicted by the Israelis on Palestinian territory and the workings
of the Palestinian Authority. The Israelis launched their military
operation following a wave of suicide bombings by Palestinians in
March.</TE>
<TE>   If conditions for Palestinians improve, U.S. officials hope,
terrorism will wane.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said a single Palestinian security force, rather than a
collection of official agencies and militias, is necessary. He also
stressed the need for a constitution, adherence to the rule of law,
and improvements in health services and education.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people in Israel who long for security and peace,
people in the Palestinian world who long for security, peace and
economic hope," the president said.</TE>
<TE>   A senior Bush administration official said that Sharon had spoken
"quite effectively" during the meeting about the need to provide
humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether Bush thought that Arafat was a viable leader, the
official said: "We're not going to choose leadership for the
Palestinian people."</TE>
<TE>   The White House appeared to be at pains to signal publicly and
privately that it had concerns for the treatment of Palestinians. It
recently increased by $30 million its annual aid for Palestinians;
the assistance now totals $110 million.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said that Bush views
corruption within the ranks of the Palestinian leadership as a
problem it needs to confront, in part to ensure that humanitarian
assistance provided by the United States and the United Nations
reached those who needed it.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's increased involvement in Middle East diplomacy began in
early April. Responding to the escalating violence, he declared that
"enough is enough." He dispatched Secretary of State Colin L. Powell
to the region and called for Israel to withdraw from the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   The talks Tuesday and Bush's meeting with the Jordanian king today
build on a series of conversations the president has had with Middle
East power brokers in recent weeks.</TE>

<HD>EgyptAir Flight Crashes in Tunisia, Killing at Least 18</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TUNIS, Tunisia</DL>
<LD>Hindered by fog, rain and wind blowing from the Sahara, an EgyptAir
plane with 62 people on board crashed Tuesday while trying to land at
the Tunis-Carthage airport. The airline said 18 people were killed.</LD>
<LD>   The plane, a Boeing 737, nearly split in two after ramming into a
hill in Nahli Park about four miles from the airport. Black smoke
rose from the site.</LD>
<LD>   The control tower had lost contact with the plane a few seconds
before the crash, just after a distress call from the pilot,
according to the national news agency, TAP.</LD>
<TE>   EgyptAir also said 25 people had been injured.</TE>
<TE>   EgyptAir's vice president for safety, Shaker Qilada, denied
reports that the plane, which was coming from Cairo, was making an
emergency landing. "It was a normal landing approach," Qilada said.</TE>
<TE>   In Cairo, Egyptian Minister of Aviation Ahmed Shafeeq held an
emergency meeting with top aviation officials.</TE>
<TE>   The passengers included 20 Egyptians, 17 Tunisians, five
Pakistanis, three Algerians, three Jordanians, two Chinese, one
Briton, one Saudi, one Palestinian and one Libyan. The crew was
Egyptian.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt jolts in the plane, and a member of the crew reassured us
that it was only clouds. Suddenly, we saw sparks in the plane and
then it hit the ground," passenger Narjess Hadada told Associated
Press. Hadada grabbed her two children and dashed out of the plane
via a gaping hole created in the crash.</TE>
<TE>   Other witnesses said the pilot released fuel shortly before the
plane went down.</TE>
<TE>   Egyptian officials were heading for Tunisia to investigate the
crash. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said it was
dispatching a team of investigators to assist the government of
Tunisia in its investigation.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 31, 1999, an EgyptAir Boeing 767 plunged into the Atlantic
Ocean off the Massachusetts island of Nantucket, killing all 217
people aboard.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Child Soldiers Appeal for End to Recruitment</HD>
<DH>United Nations: World body seeks to enforce a ban on the
practice. Accounts of lost youth precede a meeting today on
children's rights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>They tote machine guns more than half their size, and they kill
people more than twice their age. They see themselves as soldiers,
not children.</LD>
<LD>   They often die in combat before they reach adulthood--and if they
do survive, they do not readily adapt to civilian life.</LD>
<LD>   "Our childhood has been taken away from us, and none of you can
give that back," China Keiletsi, a Ugandan who served as a rebel
soldier from age 9 to 20, told a group of U.N. officials and
children's rights activists here Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   "But I hope that everyone in this room will work to make sure that
no other child in this world should go through that," Keiletsi, now
25, said after describing a life of abduction, carnage, numbing
brutalization and unquestioning obedience. "I beg you."</TE>
<TE>   For decades, from West Africa to Central America to Southeast
Asia, adolescents and even preteens have been pressed into military
duty by government and guerrilla forces alike.</TE>
<TE>   But the United Nations--with broad new support from the major
powers here--is now seeking to enforce a worldwide ban on the use and
recruitment of child soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   "For far too long, the use of child soldiers has been seen as
merely regrettable," said Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary-general,
addressing the gathering Tuesday. "We are here to ensure it is
recognized as intolerable. Even on the battlefield, there are minimal
norms of conduct that must be upheld."</TE>
<TE>   Several international treaties prohibit sending minors into
combat, but the provisions have rarely been enforced. At least
300,000 combatants younger than 18 are fighting in armed conflicts
around the world, U.N. agencies estimate.</TE>
<TE>   The Security Council has asked Annan to submit a list in October
of any known violators of these prohibitions.</TE>
<TE>   Under the rules governing the new International Criminal Court,
anyone who sends children younger than 15 into combat faces possible
prosecution for war crimes, U.N. officials said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We are here to put parties to conflict on notice that the use of
child combatants will carry consequences," Annan said.</TE>
<TE>   With about 60 prime ministers and heads of state scheduled to
gather here today for a special General Assembly meeting on
children's issues, the U.N. is also trying to increase support--and
funding--for its rehabilitation programs for newly surrendered and
disarmed child soldiers. In pilot projects in Sri Lanka, Sierra Leone
and Congo, thousands of young ex-combatants are now in these
"demobilization camps," which offer schooling as well as
psychological therapy.</TE>
<TE>   "It becomes a normal thing--killing someone was as easy as doing
anything," said Ishmael Beah, a 20-year-old from Sierra Leone who was
forced to serve as a rebel soldier for three of his teenage years.
After eight months in a U.N. rehabilitation program, Beah, now a
charming, effortlessly eloquent young man, said, he was able to
resume classroom studies. But he still suffers from nightmares and
wrestles with a deep sense of guilt. "I was killing someone else's
parents," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Because underage soldiers are impressionable and obedient, they
have been responsible for "some of the very worst wartime atrocities"
in recent years, said Olara A. Otunnu, a senior U.N. official
specializing in the problems facing children in armed conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1999, Otunnu has traveled to war zones seeking pledges from
governments and rebel groups that they will no longer send anyone
younger than 18 into combat. He says he has now received 59 such
commitments, many in sub-Saharan Africa, where the problem is most
acute.</TE>
<TE>   In the Democratic Republic of Congo, where thousands of young boys
have fought as insurgents and as government troops in recent years,
President Joseph Kabila and leaders of the opposition Congo
Liberation Movement pledged a year ago to immediately halt the
recruitment of child soldiers. They also agreed to permit U.N.
inspections of military camps to ensure compliance and promised that
armed minors would be transferred to U.N. facilities for former child
soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   But reports persist of young boys and girls fighting on both sides
in Congo. And thousands of children abducted from northern Uganda are
now in rebel camps across the border in Sudan, Otunnu said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   In Angola, where Otunnu is headed next week, the army and the
rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola both have
young teenagers in arms, he said.</TE>
<TE>   If these practices do not cease, Otunnu said, "we will work to
ensure that the very first prosecutions in the International Criminal
Court are of those who recruit these child soldiers."</TE>

<HD>Enron Memos Prompt Calls for a Wider Investigation</HD>
<DH>Electricity: Regulators order all energy trading companies
to preserve documents on tactics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON, RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR and TIM REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Documents showing Enron Corp. sought to rig energy prices in
California escalated pressure Tuesday for a wider investigation of
energy market manipulation, sending tremors through the industry.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Tuesday ordered all
energy trading companies to preserve documents dealing with their
tactics, including internal memos. The action came a day after the
release of an internal memo detailing Enron's trading ploys, which
said other companies had adopted similar tactics.</LD>
<LD>   Despite denials of any market manipulation, energy companies saw
their stocks plunge as much as 17% in anticipation of increased
scrutiny of their operations.</LD>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, lawmakers called for a criminal investigation,
more congressional hearings and new regulation of the kind of energy
trades Enron conducted. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer expressed
confidence that federal regulators would "vigorously" investigate the
new revelations.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department said in a statement that its Enron task
force "is continuing to actively investigate a wide variety of
matters concerning the conduct of Enron Corp. and individuals and
entities associated with it."</TE>
<TE>   FERC on Monday released memos detailing strategies used by Enron
traders to artificially inflate energy prices during California's
energy crisis in 2000-2001, when Enron traders operated in a newly
deregulated market.</TE>
<TE>   FERC officials declined to comment, citing the continuing
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the trading schemes discussed in the Enron memos could
answer a long-standing mystery in the California power crisis, said
Robert McCullough, an Portland, Ore.-based energy consultant.</TE>
<TE>   In winter 2001, the California Independent System Operator--the
agency running the power grid under deregulation--called for rolling
blackouts in Northern California, citing a shortage brought on by
congested power lines serving the area.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Bonneville Power Administration, which co-owns lines
from Oregon into Northern California, insisted that there was a large
amount of unused capacity, McCullough said.</TE>
<TE>   The newly released memos detail one Enron strategy that called for
giving Cal-ISO false signals about Enron's anticipated "load," or the
amount of power its customers would require.</TE>
<TE>   The idea, roughly, was that on a day of high demand, Enron would
exaggerate the amount of power its customers would need. Cal-ISO,
worried about meeting demand, would then offer to pay a premium to
energy providers that agreed to send extra power.</TE>
<TE>   Enron would readily comply by reducing its usage--reaping the
benefit of cutting back power it never really needed in the first
place.</TE>
<TE>   "Did this happen during the blackouts?" McCullough asked. "I don't
know, but by God, we need to investigate," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron officials had roundly denied any market manipulation, or
"gaming," during the energy crisis. The Houston company, under new
leadership since its collapse last fall, released the documents to
federal investigators Monday but said it could not vouch for their
accuracy.</TE>
<TE>   The company sold its energy trading operation early this year
under its bankruptcy reorganization.</TE>
<TE>   California Gov. Gray Davis said the memos vindicate his long-held
position that electricity spikes during the energy crisis resulted
from market manipulation by Enron and other energy marketers.</TE>
<TE>   The governor sent a letter Tuesday to federal energy regulators
urging them to release all other evidence of "Enron's role in
manipulating the energy markets in California and the West." He
specifically asked FERC for memos, e-mails and other communications
between elected officials and Enron from 1996 to 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said he believes that market manipulation by energy
companies cost California consumers at least $30 billion in
electricity price hikes in 2000-2001.</TE>
<TE>   The state had previously asked FERC to order Enron and other
energy companies to repay $9 billion in alleged electricity
overcharges. Manipulation of the spot market prices, Davis said, also
had a negative effect on the negotiation of billions of dollars in
long-term electricity contracts that the state has asked FERC to void
or modify.</TE>
<TE>   "I assume the companies we have contracts with may have
manipulated the market as well," Davis said. "They have to know the
truth will out. It is to their advantage to renegotiate a fairer
price."</TE>
<TE>   Davis said he was asking state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer to step
into the Enron bankruptcy case and sue the company for fraud to
assure that California gets reimbursement for extra electricity costs
borne by consumers and the state.</TE>
<TE>   One Enron memo, dated Dec. 6, 2000, said traders for other
companies copied Enron's aggressive pricing schemes. Wall Street
reacted swiftly, with shares of Dynegy Inc. dropping 17% and Mirant
Corp.'s falling 12%.</TE>
<TE>   Energy companies were stunned by the claim of widespread
manipulation, said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western
Power Trading Forum, a group representing traders and plant owners.</TE>
<TE>   "Our members were disheartened and disappointed because they feel
they were doing the best job possible of holding the regulations both
in spirit and letter," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ackerman said he had never heard the terms used in the Enron
memos, which he described as "purely endemic to Enron." He said he
believes that Enron may have violated the spirit of the trading rules
but remained legally inside them while trying to maximize profit.</TE>
<TE>   Cal-ISO board member Mike Florio, speaking as a senior attorney
for the Utility Reform Network, a consumer group, said Enron was a
driving force behind the state's move to deregulate energy in the
1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a handful of us saying you could not have this
loosey-goosey system and cowboys rule," Florio said. "They
[deregulation advocates] said, 'Don't worry. The miracle of
competition will make people behave....' From the beginning ... this
was a market of the gamers, by the gamers and for the gamers."</TE>
<TE>   Four California Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce
Committee called on Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) to launch a
full-scale investigation of Enron's business conduct and pricing
practices in the West.</TE>
<TE>   "While Enron Corp. may have imploded, the structure that allowed
the company to gouge Western energy customers remains in place," they
said in a letter Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Current and former FERC officials, however, said it is too soon to
say what role the memos ultimately will play in the agency's sweeping
investigation of alleged manipulation of Western power markets.</TE>
<TE>   An immediate issue facing FERC investigators is how to resolve
conflicts among the Enron memos. Two identical memos dated Dec. 6 and
Dec. 8, 2000, detail various market manipulation strategies used by
Enron traders, but a later memo challenges their accuracy.</TE>
<TE>   "What kind of weight they are going to give this thing is yet to
be determined," said James Hoecker, a former FERC chairman who is now
an energy lawyer. "Is this a smoking gun, or this an indication that
there were a couple of bad actors who may not have reflected the
general practices of the company? We don't know that yet."</TE>
<TE>   "Some of it sounds like gaming, and some of it sounds like they
were really beyond the pale," said a FERC staff member who asked not
to be identified. "But you automatically have several issues of fact
to get to the bottom of. There are some conflicts between the memos,
and you have to do more fact finding."</TE>
<TE>   FERC also could order refunds, but Enron has filed for bankruptcy.
One FERC official who spoke on the condition that he not be named
said the agency's options are limited. Enron creditors would take
precedence over any refunds the agency might assess.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not much we can do to them," he said. "To a certain
extent, it's like trying to squeeze blood out of a turnip."</TE>
<TE>   The official said he believes the main effect of the disclosures
in these memos will be how FERC sets rules for wholesale electricity
markets from here on.</TE>
<TE>   "How do we structure the rules so people don't have the incentive
to do these things?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that the memos showed it would be in California's
interest to be part of a Western transmission grid, a remedy Davis
opposes. One of the abuses detailed in the memos involved shipping
electricity out of state and then selling it back to California at a
markup. That would not have been possible if there had been a
regionwide Western transmission grid.</TE>
<TE>   Another FERC official said the memos are a reflection of what
happened in the market when the federal regulatory cops walked off
the beat. Under its previous leadership, the commission embraced a
free-market ideology and remained aloof from intervening to resolve
problems.</TE>
<TE>   About the same time Enron officials were writing memos describing
how to "game" the California market, FERC released a report saying it
could find no evidence of manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   Not until last summer did the commission intervene to impose price
limits on wholesale electricity in the West. Prices dropped and
demand stabilized.</TE>
<TE>   "For most of us, this was not a surprise," the second FERC
official said. "Everybody knew that people were engaging in some of
this activity. It's just that the commission was in its laissez-faire
phase."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Eric Lichtblau in Washington, Thomas S.
Mulligan in New York and Nancy Rivera Brooks in Los Angeles
contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Novelist Spurs Passion Over Parking</HD>
<DH>Dispute: In crowded San Francisco, Danielle Steel has
permits for 26 spaces. City considers limits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Romance novelist Danielle Steel is a woman of excess. She's dashed
off dozens of bestsellers, married five times, produced nine children
and inhabits a sprawling compound that commands sweeping views of
Alcatraz Island and the Golden Gate Bridge.</LD>
<LD>   It turns out she has an appetite for parking places too.</LD>
<LD>   The 54-year-old grande dame of fiction has amassed 26 residential
permits in her tony Pacific Heights neighborhood--more than any San
Franciscan, city officials say.</LD>
<TE>   The permits exempt the holders from the posted parking
restrictions that make parking on the street virtually impossible in
many crowded neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   In a traffic-clogged city where the number of cars dwarfs the
number of parking spaces, where residents can circle for hours to
find a spot, Steel's penchant for parking permits has unleashed
passions not normally associated with her 50-odd romance novels.</TE>
<TE>   There has not only been angry sniping from neighbors but also
miffed letters to the editor and a recent local newspaper headline
that read: "Danielle's Parking Orgy."</TE>
<TE>   "No single-family home should ever be allowed to have 26 parking
permits," said Myron Zimmerman, who lives across the street from
Steel. "It's way too excessive. She already has a huge underground
garage and extra outside parking on her property. It puts people
around here in a bind. If we have any kind of social event, we've got
to hire valet parkers."</TE>
<TE>   Partially inspired by Steel's surplus, irked city officials
Thursday will consider limiting the number of parking permits to
three per household. Under present law, residents can buy an
unlimited number of permits--at $27 per year each.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco has the nation's largest per-square-mile number of
registered vehicles and one of the smallest numbers of per-capita
parking spaces. About 500,000 vehicles compete each weekday for
320,000 street parking spaces, statistics show.</TE>
<TE>   Crowded into 49 densely packed square miles, residents often wait
two years for garage rental space. People wind up parking on
sidewalks, often to find themselves later boxed in by other parking
scofflaws.</TE>
<TE>   Police issue 100,000 parking tickets annually specifically for
sidewalk parking.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, parking is a major revenue source for San
Francisco. In the next two years, officials plan to install 25,000
electronic meters--many of which will accept as payment an ATM-style
Translink card--a move that could boost the city's annual take from
the current $12.6 million to more than $18 million.</TE>
<TE>   City officials said the uproar over Steel's parking permits
signals a frustration felt by nearly every San Franciscan.</TE>
<TE>   "Parking is at an extraordinary premium in this city, and the
issue is definitely the biggest complaint we face as city officials,"
Supervisor Gavin Newsom said. "People hate to have to park on the
sidewalk, and it moves them to organize so their voice is heard at
City Hall."</TE>
<TE>   The parking issue recently prompted "one of the most acrimonious
public meetings" Newsom said he'd attended. "No one wanted to talk
about homelessness or affordable housing," he said. "What they wanted
to talk about were parking permits."</TE>
<TE>   Not Steel. The prolific author whose books--including
"Bittersweet," "The Gift" and "Fine Things"--have been translated
into 28 languages in 47 countries, declined to discuss the permit
controversy.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, the author and her then-husband, John Traina, a shipping
consultant, paid $8 million for the home many consider the most
elegant in San Francisco. Known as the "Parthenon of the West," the
mansion once housed sugar king Claus Spreckels and was the site of
Frank Sinatra's nightclub Chez Joey.</TE>
<TE>   Perched on a hill surrounded by other multimillion-dollar
mansions, the home features towering concrete walls, thick foliage
and electronic surveillance. A sign outside the garage door warns:
"No Parking." Steel's permits cover four Toyotas, three Mercedes, two
Land Rovers, a Volvo, two antique 1940 Fords and a 2000 Jaguar, not
to mention cars driven by her staff, records show.</TE>
<TE>   When approached by a reporter, a man who said his name was Tony,
Steel's parking director, refused to comment and hustled the visitor
out a side service door.</TE>
<TE>   The move to limit parking permits was inspired last summer by
Robert Kendrick, who lives in a wealthy neighborhood near Steel's
that also is plagued with parking hassles. Kendrick parked numerous
junk cars on area streets, prompting several complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Then, city officials checked their records and uncovered what they
called startling results.</TE>
<TE>   Although 98% of 44,000 permit-holders had three permits or fewer,
Kendrick and Steel then had 29 and 22, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   "We just never understood that such a loophole existed where
people could hoard these permits," said Newsom, who is sponsoring the
new city parking permit ordinance. "Since parking spaces are such a
rare commodity, we need to treat everyone fairly."</TE>
<TE>   Greg Scott, president of a nearby homeowners association, said
parking has been an issue for years around Steel's mansion.</TE>
<TE>   "At one point a few years back, when her children were younger,
there were a couple large vans--the kinds hotels use--to transport
the kids, and they were always parked on the street," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Standing outside his consulate building near Steel's home, German
Consul Klaus Scheliga shook his head when asked about the author's
parking permits.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not want to get involved with local politics," he said. "But
there is a shortage of parking here. And all of her permits certainly
do not help."</TE>
<TE>   At the famous City Lights bookstore, which doesn't carry Steel's
books, clerk Richard Berman explained the issue this way: "Rich
people get away with stuff regular people don't."</TE>
<TE>   Customer Victor Namuche agreed. "I live in super-crowded North
Beach, but I still get just one parking permit," he said. "I'd love
to get 25 more to give all my friends. But that's not the way the
world works."</TE>
<TE>   Parking officials hope that those parking discrepancies will soon
be part of the past.</TE>
<TE>   "We never intended to provide cheap on-street parking storage for
people with too many vehicles," said Diana Hammons, a spokeswoman for
the Department of Parking and Traffic. "You can't own a dozen cars
and expect to park them on city streets."</TE>

<LD>Following a nationwide manhunt, authorities arrested a Wisconsin
college student on Interstate 80 outside Reno on Tuesday and charged
him with planting a string of mailbox pipe bombs that rattled mail
carriers and customers across much of the country's midsection.</LD>
<LD>   Luke John Helder, 21, an art student and the leader of a garage
rock band called Apathy, faces 70 years in federal prison if
convicted on two felony counts.</LD>
<LD>   As federal agents and local officers began tailing his 1992 Honda
Civic in Nevada, Helder for the most part obeyed the speed limit but
refused to pull over for 46 minutes. About 50 miles outside Reno, he
finally came to a stop and surrendered peacefully, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   Helder was taken into custody just hours after the FBI issued a
nationwide alert for him, having received a tip in Wisconsin, where
he attended school, and after interviewing his family at their home
in the town of Pine Island, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI, as well as his father, had taken to the airwaves earlier
in the day to plead with Helder to turn himself in.</TE>
<TE>   "Please don't hurt anyone else," a tearful Cameron Helder said,
reading from a statement at the family home. "You have the attention
you wanted."</TE>
<TE>   The bombs, six of which detonated, injuring four mail carriers and
two residents, were all accompanied by an antigovernment manifesto.
Helder said his son was opposed to many United States government
policies and was "just trying to make a statement."</TE>
<TE>   Explosives experts were still going through Helder's car late
Tuesday night. ''It's unclear if any bombs are in there, but the
makings of a bomb--bomb parts--are inside,'' said Andrea Edwards of
the Pershing County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   Helder, who had alerted authorities to his whereabouts when he
made a cell phone call in eastern Utah on Monday night, called his
parents during the pursuit and was patched through to an FBI agent,
authorities said. He volunteered to surrender, asked not to be
tackled and turned over a gun when he gave himself up.</TE>
<TE>   The mop-haired, green-eyed Helder, a student at the University of
Wisconsin at Stout, in Menomonie, majored in art with an emphasis on
industrial design, school spokeswoman Jennifer Klement said. Klement
said Helder's roommate had told the school that Helder hadn't been to
class since last week. Finals are next week.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday began with what appeared to be more evidence of a
cross-country pipe-bombing spree, with another device found in a
mailbox in Amarillo, Texas. The device appeared similar to the other
17 found since Friday, and like some of the others was contained in a
zip-top plastic bag along with an antigovernment note. A resident
discovered the device and called police. It did not explode. Unlike
the other devices, the Texas bomb was discovered in a residential
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   The bomber's apparent path west and the timing of the bombings,
however, seem to call into question whether the Amarillo device,
which would be the 18th bomb, was indeed planted by the same person.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the 17th bomb was found in Salida, Colo. Helder is now
believed to have been in Moab, Utah, that evening, and near Reno less
than 24 hours later. Because Moab is 890 miles from Amarillo, it is
unclear how he could have been in all those places in such a short
time frame.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities in Texas could not be reached for comment late
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   In Utah, law officers spent the day investigating two reports that
appeared to have helped lead to Helder: a cell phone call and a
possible sighting of his car.</TE>
<TE>   The phone call originated about 6 p.m. Monday from an area near
the southeastern high-desert city of Moab, according to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   After Helder's name and the description of his car was made public
Tuesday, a man reported to the FBI that a car matching the
description cut him off Monday night while traveling west near the
city of Green River, 66 miles west of Moab on Interstate 80. The
incident took place just two hours after the cell call was made from
Moab, said FBI Special Agent Dale Weiss in Salt Lake.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators had difficulty determining when the bombs were
placed because some residents were out of town or for other reasons
did not check their mailboxes daily. It also has never been clear
precisely the route the bomber took, though I-80 appeared to be the
primary artery west after the first bombs were found Friday in
northwestern Illinois and eastern Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, with details of the bombs' construction and the text
of the letter made public early on, officials have been especially
wary of copycats.</TE>
<TE>   Once a tie-wearing type, Helder, whose Menomonie apartment was
guarded Tuesday by a police officer, in recent years began growing
his hair, dressing in grunge-style clothing and learning to play
guitar.</TE>
<TE>   Apathy recorded one amateur-sounding collection of songs called
"sacks of people" in 2000. On the band's Web site, in a brief
biography, Helder calls himself a huge fan of the now-defunct grunge
band Nirvana and its lead singer, Kurt Cobain, who committed suicide
in 1994. "I really am quite infatuated with this band," he writes. "I
know everything about Kurt ... try me, hahaha.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, the top things I care about are my girlfriend ... , and my
music/band," he continues, later adding: "I party, play guitar, and
talk online to everyone. That's my life."</TE>
<TE>   He makes no mention of antigovernment feelings authorities believe
he may have been espousing in the letters left with the bombs.</TE>
<TE>   The typewritten note accompanying each bomb touches on death, the
desire to "avoid negative emotion/pain" and various other topics, but
reads mostly as a vague rant against the government.</TE>
<TE>   "Conforming to the boundaries, and restrictions imposed by the
government only reduces the substance in your lives," it says. "When
1% of the nation controls 99% of the nations total wealth, is it a
wonder why there are control problems?</TE>
<TE>   "The United States strives to provide freedom for their people. Do
we really have personal freedom? I've lived here for many years, and
I see much limitation."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the student newspaper at the University of Wisconsin
at Madison, the Badger Herald, said it gave the FBI a seven-page
letter that was received over the weekend and signed with Helder's
name. The letter was postmarked in Omaha on Friday--the day the first
eight bombs were found--and a day before eight more bombs turned up
in Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   The letter's first page is identical to the antigovernment notes
found with the bombs. The letter also said, in part: ''I will
die/change in the end for this, but that's ok, hahaha paradise
awaits!''</TE>
<TE>   People acquainted with Helder said he was a clean-cut kid who once
held a job bagging groceries. They said he became absorbed in the
alternative music scene, but he had never espoused antigovernment or
violent views.</TE>
<TE>   "I've known Luke for a long time, and I can't see him pipe-bombing
people," said Andy Hielscher, whose brother Eric is Helder's band
mate. "I may be wrong. He was such an easygoing guy. He never talked
about politics or the government."</TE>
<TE>   Hielscher said his brother has known Helder and his family since
childhood. "His parents called a couple of times recently looking for
Eric's number, but I didn't think anything about it. Maybe I should
have."</TE>
<TE>   Josh Scott, a Rochester, Minn.-area musician who worked at the
studio where Apathy recorded, said Helder was better known for
playing "pretty bad music'' than holding extreme political views.</TE>
<TE>   Helder and his band were viewed in the music community mostly as
mediocre and out of date.</TE>
<TE>   "We mocked him all the time ... not to his face," Scott said. "He
totally dressed the [grunge] part, his hair and his voice. Everyone
[at the time] said, 'Nirvana, give me a break, this is 2000.'"</TE>
<TE>   Times staff researchers Lianne Hart in Houston, Belen Rodriguez in
Denver and John Beckham in Chicago contributed to this report.</TE>

<LD>   The lectern President Bush used while addressing the nation after
the Sept. 11 attacks was mistakenly sold as surplus property for $75
to a school in rural Arkansas.</LD>
<LD>   "We're such a small school to have something like that," said
Kirbi Fletcher, the Arkansas City High School valedictorian, before
giving her speech behind the lectern at the school's commencement.</LD>
<TE>   The Air Force donated the lectern to the Arkansas Federal Surplus
Property program, which sold it to the school district. The lectern
will be retrieved by the government and forwarded to the Smithsonian,
officials said.</TE>

<HD>RNC Files Suit Over Campaign Law</HD>
<DH>Politics: GOP cites constitutional issues in the statute.
California Democrats also sue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Republican National Committee, which usually operates as a
political arm of the White House, filed a lawsuit in federal court
Tuesday seeking to overturn major portions of the landmark campaign
finance legislation signed by President Bush.</LD>
<LD>   Also challenging the law in court were the California Democratic
and Republican parties, contending in a joint suit that some
provisions place unconstitutional limits on state and local parties.</LD>
<LD>   With their suits, the party groups joined dozens of plaintiffs
objecting to one part or another of the new law that will ban
unlimited donations to national political parties and restrict
political advertising by interest groups. The law takes effect after
the elections in November.</LD>
<TE>   The suits will be considered by a three-judge panel in Washington.
The panel has set a December date for oral arguments. Appeals,
certain no matter which way the panel rules, will be taken directly
to the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday was the deadline for filing suits to be heard on that
legal fast track.</TE>
<TE>   The day's developments underscored how political operatives in
both parties, inside and outside Washington, have become critics of a
law that won congressional approval with support from a majority of
Democrats and a minority bloc of Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   The RNC suit was especially striking because it appeared to put
the national party apparatus somewhat at odds with the president's
public position. Bush quietly signed the bill into law in March. At
the time, he expressed misgivings about portions of the bill but said
that overall he believed it would improve the political system.</TE>
<TE>   But national GOP Chairman Marc Racicot said Tuesday that the
committee had to act to "defend the political party system and our
constitutional rights at the local, state and national level."</TE>
<TE>   Racicot, whom Bush chose for the RNC post last year, added, "When
Republicans face unconstitutional obstructions of political activity,
the RNC is obligated to protect and defend the equal access of all
Americans to engage in protected political speech."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the RNC, Jim Dyke, said the decision to sue was
the committee's alone. A White House spokesman, Scott McClellan,
agreed.</TE>
<TE>   However, it was unclear whether White House aides weighed in on
the lawsuit. Dyke said he believed Racicot did not seek the White
House's opinion. McClellan declined to answer directly whether Bush
aides were consulted.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the chief author of the new campaign
law, said he was unfazed by the new suits--but curious about them.</TE>
<TE>   "We all know the RNC is under the orders of the White House, under
the control of the White House," McCain said. "I'd be curious who
told the RNC to do it."</TE>
<TE>   In its suit, the RNC alleges that core parts of the law violate
the Constitution by intruding on state and local elections and by
infringing on the national party's ability to speak out through
political ads.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, much of that advertising has been paid for by the
unlimited donations to the national parties known as soft money.
Banning those contributions was the new law's key objective.</TE>
<TE>   The RNC is joined in its lawsuit by, among others, the Republican
parties of Colorado, New Mexico and Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   The California suit includes the state parties and two local
committees: Yolo County Democrats and Santa Cruz County Republicans.
It alleges that fund-raising limits on state and local party groups
in the new law are unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   Lance Olson, general counsel of the California Democratic Party,
said the suit is "focused solely" on state and local concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "The fundamental problem is the federalization of the election
process," Olson said. He complained that the law creates "an
incredibly broad definition" of federal election activity, ensnaring
state and local groups in fund-raising limits that should apply only
to national parties and federal campaigns.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Backs a Right to Bear Arms</HD>
<DH>Law: The Justice Department's stance reverses six decades
of federal policy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Justice Department has declared that the Constitution gives
individuals the right to own a gun--a position that largely reverses
six decades of federal policy and raises thorny questions about the
legality of existing firearms restrictions.</LD>
<LD>   In briefs filed late Monday with the U.S. Supreme Court, the
Justice Department rejected the long-held interpretation that the 2nd
Amendment guarantees gun rights only to militias, not to individuals.</LD>
<LD>   The department's stance elevates a long-simmering battle between
the gun lobby and gun-control advocates to the high court, with Atty.
Gen. John Ashcroft and the Justice Department voicing their strongest
support yet for the gun lobby.</LD>
<TE>   The National Rifle Assn. applauded the Justice Department's
stance, but scholars and gun-control advocates said they were alarmed
because they believe the "radical" shift in position threatens to
undermine a wide range of gun laws already on the books.</TE>
<TE>   Current state and federal laws subjecting law-abiding citizens to
background checks, regulating concealed weapons and banning the
purchase of certain guns, such as assault rifles, could all be
vulnerable, experts in gun law said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1930s, the federal government and the courts have
declared almost without exception that people have no constitutional
right to own a gun and that the government can thus pass laws
restricting who can own a gun and what types of weapons they can own.</TE>
<TE>   But in a pair of pending appeals, the Bush administration asserted
for the first time before the Supreme Court that it believes that
legal reasoning is flawed.</TE>
<TE>   "The current position of the United States ... is that the 2nd
Amendment more broadly protects the rights of individuals, including
persons who are not members of any militia or engaged in active
military service or training, to possess and bear their own
firearms," Solicitor General Theodore B. Olson wrote in a footnote to
the briefs.</TE>
<TE>   That right, Olson acknowledged, is subject to certain restrictions
that allow the government to keep weapons out of the hands of "unfit
persons" and to ban certain types of weapons often used by criminals.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, in one of the cases now pending before the Supreme Court,
the department agreed that a Texas man who had a restraining order
against him for domestic violence should not be allowed to have a
gun.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department urged the court to turn down both his
appeal and that of a man convicted of violating federal law by owning
two machine guns.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft, a lifelong NRA member, set the stage for the debate last
year when he wrote the group a letter saying that he "unequivocally"
believes that the 2nd Amendment clearly protects the rights of
individuals to keep and bear arms.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft's aides said initially that the letter reflected only
Ashcroft's "personal" opinion, but it became clear in subsequent
actions, including a memo last November to federal prosecutors noting
an appellate court's ruling in the Texas gun case, that the
department was moving toward a major shift in federal interpretation
of the 2nd Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court would have to validate the Justice Department's
view of the 2nd Amendment for it to become the rule of law, at least
at the federal level. Experts said they doubted the Supreme Court
would move to overturn gun laws in either of the two pending cases.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the Justice Department's official position offers
powerful ammunition at the state and local levels to pro-gun rights
forces who may seek to challenge severe gun restrictions and handgun
bans in effect in Washington, D.C., and elsewhere, Franklin Zimring,
a preeminent scholar on gun law at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of
Law, said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   ''If there's an individual right for the average citizen, those
types of regulations may very well be at risk from this sea change,''
Zimring said.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Cox, chief lobbyist for the NRA, said in an interview that
while it is too early to tell what impact the Justice Department's
position will have on existing gun laws, "obviously we're pleased by
this. This is a very good start."</TE>
<TE>   "It should come as no surprise that this attorney general has
followed through on his correct interpretation that the 2nd Amendment
is an individual right, following through not only in word but in
deed," Cox said.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials downplayed the significance of the
Supreme Court briefs.</TE>
<TE>   "We intend to both enforce and defend existing gun laws," said a
department official who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just us following through on what we said we were going
to do a year ago. You can have an individual-rights view of the 2nd
Amendment and still think there are certain restrictions that survive
constitutional muster."</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials say that a series of "internal
deliberations" in past decades support the rights of individual gun
owners. But they have refused to publicly release documents on that
point, and scholars say that, based on the public and judicial
record, the Justice Department's current position marks a sharp
departure from past precedent.</TE>
<TE>   "There's never been any disagreement before this: The Department
of Justice has been a sworn enemy of any individual right to bear
arms over the course of the entire history of federal gun control
legislation," dating back to the 1930s, Zimring said. Mathew
Nosanchuk, legislative counsel for the Violence Policy Center, a
pro-gun control group in Washington, said he was deeply troubled by
the department's position.</TE>
<TE>   "Here you have an attorney general flouting decades of precedent
to embrace an expansive view of a heretofore unrecognized individual
right to own a gun, and that could put many gun laws at risk," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Michael D. Barnes, president of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun
Violence, also charged that the Justice Department's position could
undermine existing gun laws, making them more difficult to defend in
court and making it easier for judges to declare them
unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   "The Justice Department now will invite federal judges to make
their own judgments about whether the gun law at issue is
'reasonable,' " Barnes predicted. He noted that in the Texas case, a
federal district court judge "did not think it reasonable to bar
[defendant] Timothy Joe Emerson from possessing guns, even though
Emerson had threatened his wife and child with a pistol, owned an
arsenal of weapons and had a domestic violence restraining order
against him.</TE>
<TE>   "This action is proof positive that the worst fears about Atty.
Gen. Ashcroft have come true: His extreme ideology on guns has now
become government policy," Barnes said.</TE>

<HD>Key West Houseboat Holdouts Are Evicted</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>KEY WEST, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The final bell tolled Tuesday for residents of Key West's historic
Houseboat Row, a bohemian colony of floating homes in the
southernmost Florida city, made famous by novelist Ernest Hemingway.</LD>
<LD>   The Florida Department of Environmental Protection and Monroe
County sheriff's deputies Tuesday evicted three holdout residents
living on houseboats along the island city's southeast sea wall.</LD>
<LD>   About two dozen houseboat owners had heeded warnings to move their
vessels to a city-owned marina at Garrison Bight across town or face
fines of $100 a day.</LD>
<TE>   Dale Adams, an official with the state Department of Environmental
Protection, said the evicted residents were "polite and cooperative"
when deputies advised them they had to leave.</TE>
<TE>   But four houseboats and one abandoned, dilapidated vessel remained
at the site after the evictions. Sheriff's deputies were guarding
them until the owners could move them, but gusty winds slowed the
relocation.</TE>
<TE>   "This represents a changing of the times in that it's now viewed
that houseboats should be kept in a maintained area," Adams said.</TE>
<TE>   The boat owners had lived rent-free at the site, which had no
sewer hookups, while locked in 15 years of litigation with the
government. To some Key Westers, Houseboat Row was an eyesore and an
environmental hazard.</TE>
<TE>   To others, it represented the freewheeling lifestyle Hemingway
celebrated when the island was a fishing village and salvage port.
The Nobel Prize-winning author wrote "A Farewell to Arms" and "To
Have and Have Not" while living in Key West from 1928 to 1939.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, a state appeals court turned down houseboat owners'
requests to extend their stay. Sheriff's deputies posted notices
before the eviction deadline, urging them, "Please be 'gone' upon our
arrival."</TE>
<TE>   State officials have been lenient in imposing penalties of $100 a
day, in effect since March 22, because of rough seas.</TE>
<TE>   Key West attorney and former Houseboat Row resident Bill Sullivan
said he still planned to petition the Florida Supreme Court to review
the case, defending "an entire way of life that has existed for many
years in the state of Florida."</TE>
<TE>   Houseboat Row began in the 1950s as a quaint colony of summer
homes for high society. In the 1970s, it deteriorated into a
collection of rustic shacks and colorful live-aboard vessels.
Hurricane Georges smashed and submerged many of them in 1998,
scattering splintered debris and leaving some residents homeless.</TE>
<TE>   Also in 1998, city residents voted to save what remained of
Houseboat Row, but the state, not the city, owns the waters under the
sea wall and the state wanted it gone.</TE>

<HD>Medical Residents File Lawsuit Over Matching System</HD>
<DH>Courts: The class action claims that the program that
places medical school graduates in hospitals violates federal
antitrust law.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The junior doctors of the nation's hospitals took aim at the heart of
the American medical establishment Tuesday, alleging in a
class-action lawsuit that the system that matches medical school
graduates with residency programs violates federal antitrust law.</LD>
<LD>   Filed in federal court on behalf of 200,000 medical residents, the
lawsuit charges that seven medical associations and 35 teaching
hospitals have "illegally contracted, combined and conspired among
themselves" to rig the system that determines where medical school
graduates will train, how much they will be paid and how many hours
they will work.</LD>
<LD>   A lawyer for the residents said that if their lawsuit succeeds in
winning monetary damages and a say in how the National Resident
Matching Program works, patient care, as well as residents' working
conditions, would improve.</LD>
<TE>   Under the program, virtually all students in their final year of
medical school--23,459 this year--designate the city, the hospital
and the specialty they would like to train in for the next three to
eight years. After a series of applications and interviews, their
choices are computer-coordinated with those of 674 teaching hospitals
nationwide. Every March the students' fate is sealed with a letter
informing them of their match.</TE>
<TE>   Participating hospitals share information about their salaries and
programs, but residents cannot discuss wages and working conditions
or contest their match. This anti-competitive system keeps wages
artificially low and gives students little choice but to work in a
system where 100-hour weeks are common, said Chicago attorney Michael
J. Freed, one of the lawyers representing the residents.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for one of the defendants, the Assn. of American
Medical Colleges, said officials there would have no comment on the
lawsuit until they had read it.</TE>
<TE>   The association manages the matching program, said Retha Sherrod,
adding that before it was established in 1952, there was "utter
chaos."</TE>
<TE>   "There was no process. The medical students wanted a system to
indicate their preference," Sherrod said.</TE>
<TE>   Defenders of the system have long argued that significantly
changing the way residents are trained and paid would overburden
staff physicians and other hospital employees while increasing
overall health-care costs.</TE>
<TE>   Freed disputed the cost argument, saying that medical residents'
salaries, which range from less than $35,000 to $39,000 in the first
year, generally account for only 3% of a hospital's budget.</TE>
<TE>   But even if winning the lawsuit does result in increased costs,
Freed added, the current system "is indefensible."</TE>
<TE>   "Everything [about the program] is designed to eliminate any
choice for the resident," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Paul Jung, a lead plaintiff, said he hopes the lawsuit will
"change the system so residents will have more of a say in their
working conditions.... Residents need to be part of the
decision-making process."</TE>
<TE>   Jung, who said he was very happy with his residency at MetroHealth
Medical Center in Cleveland, is now a health policy research fellow
at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, "where residencies were
invented in 1888."</TE>
<TE>   He said the inventors "would be appalled" by the system, which
"treats residents like cheap labor."</TE>
<TE>   Other defendants include the American Medical Assn., the American
Hospital Assn. and, among the teaching hospitals, Stanford Hospital
and Clinics and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Cedars-Sinai said late Tuesday that she was not
aware of the lawsuit.</TE>

<HD>Rumsfeld Voices Confidence in Army Secretary</HD>
<DH>Military: Defense chief says White was not part of a secret
campaign to save a weapon system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said Tuesday that beleaguered
Army Secretary Thomas E. White was not to blame for the military's
secret lobbying to save a weapon program that Rumsfeld plans to kill.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking with reporters before testifying on Capitol Hill,
Rumsfeld said he believes that White was not aware of contacts last
week between some Army officials and congressional supporters of the
Crusader artillery program. Rumsfeld interpreted those contacts as
disloyal efforts to undermine his push to cancel the $11-million
weapon system.</LD>
<LD>   "No, I don't hold him responsible for that. He didn't have any
knowledge of it," Rumsfeld said of documents supporting the Crusader
that were faxed to members of Congress shortly after White was told
by Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz that the program would
be canceled.</LD>
<TE>   The Pentagon is expected to officially announce the cancellation
today, a senior Defense official said. Defense Department officials,
who contend that the money could be better spent on emerging
technologies, must still convince Congress to end funding for the
mobile long-range 155-millimeter howitzer.</TE>
<TE>   But the Crusader has strong supporters on Capitol Hill, among them
key senators and representatives whose constituent contractors will
be hard hit if the system is taken out of development.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld said Tuesday that someone on White's staff was "way in
the dickens out of line" and that he would await the findings of an
investigation by the Army's inspector general, which is due today,
before taking any action. It appeared unlikely that he would punish
White, 58, a retired general and decorated Vietnam War veteran who is
the Army's top civilian official.</TE>
<TE>   After an article appeared in USA Today on Tuesday saying that
White would be fired over the Crusader imbroglio, Rumsfeld sent White
a copy with a note attached, dismissing its content.</TE>
<TE>   Asked at a Pentagon news conference whether he remained confident
in White's ability to carry out his duties, Rumsfeld said: "Yes, I
do. I certainly have confidence in Secretary White."</TE>
<TE>   At the White House, President Bush's press secretary, Ari
Fleischer, echoed that sentiment.</TE>
<TE>   "The president has confidence in Army Secretary White. He thinks
he's doing a good job in his post," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   White has been under fire for weeks because of questions about
ties to his former employer, Enron Corp. He headed Enron Energy
Services, a subsidiary of the collapsed energy giant, before becoming
Army secretary and had dozens of contacts with senior Enron officials
during the firm's collapse last year while he sold millions of
dollars' worth of Enron stock.</TE>
<TE>   He also is under investigation by the Defense Department's
inspector general for his handling of personal business matters on
trips using Army jets.</TE>
<TE>   When it emerged last week that Army officials had gone behind
Rumsfeld's back to lobby Congress to spare the Crusader system,
White's job had seemed in peril.</TE>

<HD>Pesticide Is No Stranger to Organic Produce, Study Finds</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Think organic fruits and vegetables are free of pesticides? Think
again.</LD>
<LD>   Almost a fourth of the organic produce in grocery stores could
contain traces of pesticides, including chemicals such as DDT.</LD>
<LD>   A Consumers Union-led study of government-collected data found
pesticide residue on 23% of organic fruits and vegetables and on
nearly 75% of conventionally grown produce.</LD>
<TE>   The findings don't mean that any of the produce is unsafe. The
residues are seldom even close to government limits.</TE>
<TE>   "Consumers who seek to reduce their exposure to pesticide residues
can do so reliably by choosing organic produce," the scientists
wrote. "However, none of the choices available on the market is
completely free of pesticide residues."</TE>
<TE>   The study is being published today in the journal Food Additives
and Contaminants.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the residues were chemicals that plants can soak up from
the soil decades after the pesticides were used.</TE>

<HD>Homes, Water at Risk in N.M. Blaze</HD>
<DH>Fire: Crews try to keep flames from Santa Fe's watershed.
Hundreds of residents are evacuated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PECOS, N.M.</DL>
<LD>Firefighters worked to protect houses and a watershed Tuesday from a
northern New Mexico wildfire that had forced hundreds of people out
of their homes.</LD>
<LD>   The 650-acre fire was moving toward the northeast, and elite
"hotshot" fire crews struggled to keep the flames from moving into
Santa Fe's watershed, said Charlie Jankiewicz, fire information
officer.</LD>
<LD>   "It's very steep, heavily forested terrain. It's very difficult,"
he said.</LD>
<TE>   Santa Fe, about 15 miles west of the fire, already is short of
water and has imposed severe restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   There was no estimate of containment Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   State police asked about 300 residents of Dalton and Pecos canyons
to leave their homes Monday as a precaution, said state Police Lt.
Rob Shilling. Several small communities and campgrounds dot the
pine-covered hills.</TE>
<TE>   No one had been allowed to return Tuesday, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Dalton Canyon, where the fire started Monday, contains about 15
homes.</TE>
<TE>   "A structural fire group is protecting those homes right now and
trying to pretreat them so they do not burn--water, foaming them
down, removing fuel from around the houses," Jankiewicz said.</TE>
<TE>   No homes had been burned and no fire-related injuries were
reported, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cora Gonzales and her husband packed their suitcases and gathered
important papers and photographs of their grandchildren before
leaving Macho Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   "I could smell smoke. It was thick. It was the most smoke I've
seen," said Cora Gonzales, who has lived in the area for 17 years.
She said she could see flames from her front porch Monday.</TE>
<TE>   To the north, a Colorado fire that had chased about 2,400 people
from their homes was 40% contained Tuesday. Crews hoped to have it
controlled today, fire information officer Sara Mayben said.</TE>

<HD>Postal Service Plans to Cut 8,000 More Jobs</HD>
<DH>Mail: The cuts will bring the year's total to 20,000.
Terrorism and declining business are blamed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>More than 8,000 additional full-time jobs will be cut by the Postal
Service this year as the agency struggles to contain its losses in
the face of declining business.</LD>
<LD>   Postmaster General John Potter said Tuesday that 20,000 career
positions are being eliminated this year, all through attrition.
About 11,800 positions have been cut so far.</LD>
<LD>   Potter told the Postal Service's governing board that financial
managers are projecting a loss of $1.5 billion for the fiscal year
that ends in September.</LD>
<TE>   That may, in effect, represent good news, since previous loss
projections for this year have ranged as high as $4.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The post office is facing an unprecedented drop in business that
began last year with the recession. It posted a $1.7-billion loss
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Potter said mail volume for this year is expected to be 6 billion
items fewer than last year, when the post office delivered 207.5
billion pieces. That was down from 207.8 billion the year before.</TE>
<TE>   The postal rate increase scheduled for June 30 is expected to
boost income for the agency; first-class stamps will rise 3 cents to
37 cents.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the cuts in personnel, the agency has reduced
spending and frozen most construction projects, helping hold the
losses to the now anticipated $1.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to falling mail volume, the Sept. 11 attacks and the
anthrax-by-mail terrorism have cost the agency hundreds of millions
of dollars. And it is now engaged in a costly search for whoever is
placing bombs in rural curbside mailboxes.</TE>
<TE>   Although Congress voted to spend $500 million to assist in coping
with the anthrax attacks and initiating efforts to prevent future
contamination, the post office does not receive tax money for its
operations. It is expected to pay its own way from postage collected.</TE>
<TE>   With about 750,000 employees, the post office has the nation's
second-largest civilian work force, after Wal-Mart.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, postal chief technology officer Charles Bravo told
the board that the agency is modernizing its internal computer
systems.</TE>

<HD>Texas Execution Is Halted</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HUNTSVILLE, Texas</DL>
<LD>A white supremacist convicted of killing a man in 1991 won a reprieve
from the U.S. Supreme Court two hours before his scheduled execution
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The court halted the execution after attorneys for Brian Davis,
33, said he is mentally retarded. The court has stopped a number of
executions as it considers a Virginia case that challenges the
constitutionality of executing retarded inmates. A ruling is expected
before July.</LD>
<LD>   Davis denied killing Michael Foster, 31, who met Davis and Davis'
wife at a Houston bar. Davis said his wife was responsible for
stabbing Foster 11 times and beating and robbing him after they drove
him home.</LD>
<TE>   Davis said his wife also used a pen to inscribe on Foster's
abdomen a swastika and the letters "NSSH," which stood for National
Society of Skinheads.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' now ex-wife, Tina McDonald, 31, has denied his claims. She
is serving 40 years in prison for aggravated robbery with a deadly
weapon and auto theft in an unrelated case.</TE>
<TE>   Roe Wilson, a Harris County assistant district attorney who
handles capital case appeals, said nothing in the case suggests Davis
is mentally retarded.</TE>

<HD>Priest Pleads Not Guilty to Sex Abuse</HD>
<DH>Courts: A judge in Massachusetts orders bail for Father
Paul Shanley, accused of raping a boy over a seven-year span.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAMBRIDGE, Mass.</DL>
<LD>Father Paul Shanley, accused of shocking crimes in a sex abuse crisis
that has rocked the Roman Catholic Church, pleaded not guilty Tuesday
to three counts of child rape.</LD>
<LD>   Rejecting defense suggestions that Shanley is a harmless,
71-year-old man in "not the greatest of physical health," a judge
ordered the Roman Catholic priest held on $750,000 cash bail.</LD>
<LD>   Shanley was extradited Monday from San Diego after a 24-year-old
man told authorities that over a seven-year period, 1983 to 1990,
Shanley repeatedly raped him after Catholic doctrine classes in
nearby Newton, Mass.</LD>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Lynn Rooney said Shanley molested the young man
"on almost a weekly basis." While Shanley stared ahead placidly,
Rooney offered graphic descriptions of abuse that allegedly took
place in a church rectory, bathroom and confessional, beginning when
the alleged victim was just 6 years old.</TE>
<TE>   The white-haired priest is at the center of a scandal over
clerical sexual abuse that has reverberated around the world. Since
January, more than 200 priests in this country have been suspended or
have resigned amid an avalanche of sexual abuse allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Records Showed History of Allegations</TE>
<TE>   In the course of a civil suit involving Shanley, the Boston
Archdiocese last month was forced to hand over more than 1,600 pages
of records that documented a long trail of child abuse allegations.
Church officials here knew of the complaints about Shanley but
assigned him to a parish where he worked with children.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, the archdiocese approved Shanley's transfer to Southern
California, describing him in a letter as a priest "in good
standing."</TE>
<TE>   In court Tuesday, Shanley was a shadow of the dashing figure who
roared around Boston on a motorcycle in the 1980s and who boasted in
church correspondence about teaching children how to inject drugs. He
wore a striped T-shirt under a red sweater and jacket, and with his
hands cuffed behind him, he leaned forward to hear District Judge
Dyanne Klein confirm that three counts of "not guilty" were entered
on his behalf.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Mondano, his attorney, painted a picture of a man with deep
roots in New England. Shanley's brother and sister live in
Massachusetts, along with 11 nieces and nephews, the lawyer said. For
several years he has lived "uninterruptedly" in San Diego, but where,
his lawyer said, "he has been hounded by the press" since his name
surfaced in the church scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Mondano argued that Shanley did not pose a flight risk and that
"he is here to face the charges, your honor." The lawyer continued,
"He stands before this court as an innocent man."</TE>
<TE>   But Deputy Dist. Atty. Rooney produced "documented admissions"
from Shanley that allegedly acknowledged sexual misconduct with
minors. She noted that Shanley also wrote about establishing a post
office box in the U.S., then leaving the country.</TE>
<TE>   "You laughed when I suggested moving to Costa Rica, but it might
be worth considering," Shanley wrote in a January 1994 missive to a
Boston church official. "It might be cheaper and it might allay the
concerns of the victims."</TE>
<TE>   Rooney also quoted from correspondence that she said showed
efforts by church officials to help Shanley hide. In return, Shanley
told a priest in one letter, "If you need to stash a priest, I could
probably help."</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal to be Deposed Today</TE>
<TE>   Although still affiliated with the Boston Archdiocese, Shanley
retired from active duty as a priest in 1993. In San Diego he worked
as a volunteer for the Police Department. He was fired in April after
officials learned of the allegations against him.</TE>
<TE>   Each count against Shanley carries a possible sentence of life in
prison. He is due back in court May 30 for a pretrial conference.</TE>
<TE>   Shanley's first court appearance comes on the eve of a scheduled
deposition of Cardinal Bernard Law. Law is to be questioned in a case
involving 86 alleged victims of defrocked priest John J. Geoghan.</TE>
<TE>   Geoghan's child molestation conviction in January unleashed the
sex abuse crisis, when the Boston Globe printed documents showing
that church officials knew of Geoghan's history as a child molester
yet repeatedly moved him from parish to parish as he continued to
work with children.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the Boston area's 2.1 million Roman Catholics have
demanded that Law step down. After a secret meeting last month with
Pope John Paul II, Law vowed to remain at his post.</TE>
<TE>   At the archdiocese , spokeswoman Donna M. Morrissey had no comment
Tuesday about Shanley's arraignment or about Law's impending
testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Rooney acknowledged that most of the complaints about Shanley that
have come into her office fell outside the statute of limitations.
But she said that "very recently, a handful have come forward" that
may be actionable.</TE>

<HD>Skakel Slaying Trial Starts</HD>
<DH>Courts: Prosecutors say the nephew of the late Sen. Kennedy
admitted killing a neighbor girl in 1975. The evidence is 'zilch,'
defense counters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NORWALK, Conn.</DL>
<LD>A prosecutor told jurors in opening arguments Tuesday that Michael
Skakel confessed to a number of people--"under circumstances where he
felt no fear of being exposed"--that he beat Martha Moxley to death
with a golf club more than 26 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   "Sometimes, some people simply can't keep a secret," States Atty.
Jonathan Benedict said. "That, as you will see, is how things
eventually unraveled for Michael Skakel and how this case was solved
after so many years.</LD>
<LD>   "As it turns out, he has been talking about his night of mischief
since at least the spring of 1978," the prosecutor said.</LD>
<TE>   Skakel, 41, is a nephew of Ethel Skakel Kennedy, the widow of Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy. He is accused of bludgeoning Moxley, a high school
sophomore and neighbor, to death with a golf club that belonged to
his mother.</TE>
<TE>   Moxley and Skakel were 15 at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Her body was discovered Oct. 31, 1975, beneath a pine tree on the
lawn of her parents' 26-room estate in the exclusive Greenwich,
Conn., waterfront enclave of Belle Haven. Nearby were the shattered
and bloody pieces of the 6-iron.</TE>
<TE>   Benedict said Moxley was repeatedly beaten so furiously that the
golf club fell apart, and she was subsequently stabbed with a portion
of the broken shaft.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Michael Sherman labeled as "zilch" the physical
evidence against his client before attacking the government's case as
"a very shaky house of cards and mostly wild cards and a few jokers
as well."</TE>
<TE>   Sherman told the jury evidence would show that Skakel was not the
murderer and was miles away visiting his cousin in north Greenwich
when the tragedy occurred.</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't in the neighborhood," Sherman stressed.</TE>
<TE>   Skakel told investigators at the time that, after returning home
from visiting his cousin, he went to bed and never left the house.</TE>
<TE>   Sherman contended that some of the prosecution's witnesses were
"coming out of the woodwork" 22 to 26 years after the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "You will find people who have no logical explanation of why they
were telling a story other than they wanted to be part of the show,"
the lawyer said. "It's a heck of a show. You can't deny that.</TE>
<TE>   "You have best-selling authors, celebrities, satellite trucks,
movies, the Kennedy connection, the works, a lot of money, a lot of
fame, a lot of notoriety that has been derived from [the] state
versus Michael Skakel."</TE>
<TE>   The wood-paneled courtroom in Norwalk's red-brick Superior
Courthouse was packed; reporters from more than 70 news organizations
obtained credentials for the trial in this community on Long Island
Sound, within commuting distance of New York City.</TE>
<TE>   Central to the prosecution's case is testimony expected from
classmates of Skakel at a school for emotionally troubled youngsters,
the Elan School in Poland Spring, Maine. The classmates allegedly
told prosecutors that Skakel made incriminating statements about the
crime.</TE>
<TE>   Sherman and Benedict clashed sharply over the role of Skakel's
family.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor contended that the young men of the Skakel family
and their cousin James Terrien "were abruptly and mysteriously
spirited away for the weekend" after the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Benedict told the jurors that the state would show evidence "of a
concerted effort on the part of the Skakel family in the guise of
cooperating with the investigation to prevent the discovery of the
actual murderer of Martha Moxley."</TE>
<TE>   He said the effort began "the very night of her death and resulted
in investigators following the wrong trails for many years."</TE>
<TE>   Sherman painted a different picture. He said the Skakel sons were
not spirited away, and their father, Rushton, opened his home to the
police. Sherman said whenever detectives wanted to speak to family
members, they were available.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no conspiracy," Sherman told the jury. "And, if there
is, let them prove it to you. And make sure it is relevant."</TE>
<TE>   Dorthy Moxley, who sought for more than two decades to find her
daughter's killer, was the first witness.</TE>
<TE>   In minute and chilling detail, she told of what she thought would
be an ordinary evening, painting woodwork and later wrapping the
brushes in aluminum foil. She described how she became increasingly
uneasy when her daughter failed to return home and sent her son out
to search for his sister.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, she knocked on the back door of the Skakel
residence, suspecting her daughter could have fallen asleep in a
camper parked in the driveway.</TE>
<TE>   "Michael came to the door. I told him I was Martha Moxley's mother
and I did not know where she was," Moxley said. She testified that
Skakel looked "hung over" and said that Martha wasn't there.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after noon, Sheila McGuire, who attended Greenwich High
School with Martha, came to the door of Moxley's home.</TE>
<TE>   "She was hysterical. She said, 'I think I found Martha.' I said,
'Is she all right?' and she said, 'No, I don't think so,'" Moxley
testified.</TE>
<TE>   During cross-examination, Sherman questioned Moxley's mother about
sounds--voices and barking dogs--she heard near her house during the
evening. Moxley said she heard the commotion between 9:30 and 10
p.m., the time Skakel's lawyers contend he was at his cousin's home.</TE>
<TE>   McGuire, who also was a witness, testified her mother woke her at
2 or 3 a.m. after receiving a call from Moxley's mother.</TE>
<TE>   McGuire said she told her mother she didn't know where Martha
Moxley was but later that day started to look for her friend. Near
Moxley's home, she saw what she believed was a "mattress kind of
thing" in the distance.</TE>
<TE>   Drawing closer, she discovered it was Moxley's bloody body.</TE>
<TE>   "She was at the base of a big, huge pine tree," McGuire said.</TE>
<TE>   "I panicked and I ran and I got to the Moxley home," McGuire
testified, "and I said, 'Let me in!'"</TE>
<TE>   She returned to the body with one of Moxley's mother's friends and
the police. McGuire said her mother later came to the scene.</TE>
<TE>   The trial is expected to last five weeks.</TE>

<HD>Rain May Bring New Misery to W. Virginia</HD>
<DH>Weather: Officials in area hit by deadly floods last week
scramble to set up emergency housing.</DH>

<DL>WELCH, W.Va.</DL>
<LD>While residents shoveled mud and threw away furniture ruined by last
week's deadly floods, thunderstorms moved into southern West Virginia
on Tuesday and created the potential for more misery.</LD>
<LD>   Up to 3 inches of rain were reported in Roane, Calhoun and Gilmer
counties, causing minor flooding. More storms were expected through
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "We've been hit four times this year already," said Melissa Bise,
a staffer at Roane County's 911 center.</LD>
<TE>   Streams were still running high and fast in McDowell County on
Tuesday, five days after 5 inches of rain inundated the region. At
least six people were killed and four were missing in the county. Two
were killed in Virginia and one man was missing and presumed drowned
in Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   McDowell County officials were rushing to establish emergency
housing. Surveys showed 197 homes were destroyed and more than 2,000
structures were damaged.</TE>
<TE>   In Welch, residents continued to shovel mud and throw out
flood-damaged possessions Tuesday. A sign at one house read, "Don't
just sightsee, shovel!"</TE>
<TE>   National Guard machinery tore into piles of sodden furniture and
other belongings now heading to emergency landfills. Despite the
5-foot pile of ruined books outside the Welch Public Library, head
librarian Donna Morgan remained upbeat.</TE>
<TE>   "We've lost at least half our books, our public computers and the
children's department is in ruins, but this library will not close.
We will be reopening," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials will meet next week to determine whether area schools
can reopen this spring. If not, state lawmakers might be asked to
allow schools to open in August to make up for the lost weeks. One
elementary school in McDowell County was destroyed and 11 others were
damaged.</TE>
<TE>   In Indiana, up to 4 inches of rain forced people from their homes
and stranded a school bus carrying elementary students on a flooded
road. No injuries were reported.</TE>
<TE>   Officers used a boat to retrieve the 14 Waverly Elementary School
students and their driver, who stopped the bus as a precaution in
high water about 15 miles southwest of Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   In western Indiana, flooding along Feather Creek prompted the
evacuation of up to a dozen residential blocks of the Vermillion
County town of Clinton, which has a population of 5,000.</TE>

<HD>Nuclear Dump Will Leak, Scientists Say</HD>
<DH>Yucca Mountain: The Nevada site will hold for 10,000 years,
backers say, but foes insist there's no guarantee. A house vote may
come today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YUCCA MOUNTAIN, Nev.</DL>
<LD>As the Bush administration prepares its push to win congressional
approval for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste burial site, scientists
agree on one key conclusion: Yucca Mountain will leak. The question
is how long it will take.</LD>
<LD>   Rising one mile from the desert floor, the mountain looks as plain
and parched as much of the rest of southern Nevada's ranges.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the arid appearance there is water here, and even the
scientists who have designed the repository concede that the
mountain's vulnerability to moisture will allow radioactive material
to eventually leak into the environment.</LD>
<TE>   Time is the key. Highly radioactive nuclear waste remains
dangerous for hundreds of thousands of years. Half of the plutonium
stored in the mountain, for example, will still be radioactive 380
million years from now. Just one-millionth of an ounce of plutonium
is enough to virtually assure cancer in someone who comes in contact
with it.</TE>
<TE>   As Congress considers whether to override Nevada's opposition to
housing nuclear waste here, opponents of the waste site argue that
the Bush administration is pushing through a flawed solution that
will create radioactivity risks for thousands of years.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials say they have designed a burial site that
will be free of leaks for at least 10,000 years. Critics, armed with
a raft of scientific studies, say that can't be guaranteed. They
point to two other nuclear sites that officials once had said would
be leak-free for hundreds or thousands of years: the Idaho National
Engineering and Environmental Laboratory near Pocatello and the
Hanford Site in eastern Washington. Both are leaking already, and
radioactive material could make its way into groundwater in just 10
years, according to a report by the National Research Council, an arm
of the National Academy of Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   Even if a 10,000-year leak-free promise could be guaranteed,
critics of Yucca Mountain say society has a responsibility to
civilizations far in the future not to expose them to lethal waste
that we generate.</TE>
<TE>   But the alternative to putting nuclear waste here is to leave it
accumulating in 131 different places in 39 states, much closer to
people and potentially vulnerable to terrorist attack, the Department
of Energy warns.</TE>
<TE>   The waste piled up around the country comes from nuclear aircraft
carriers and electrical plants, bomb factories and university labs.
Over time, it will emit thousands of times more radioactivity than
was released at Chernobyl and millions of times more than the
Hiroshima bomb.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, says the government, 2 out of 3 Americans live within
75 miles of a storage site.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no more [storage] space, there are deteriorating storage
conditions, and you have the challenge that so much of it is located
near population centers and waterways," said Secretary of Energy
Spencer Abraham. "No one believes you can bring in David Copperfield,
wave a wand and it all goes away."</TE>
<TE>   "We've tried to take into account as many uncertainties of the
future as can be assessed," Abraham said. "I am convinced that the
site is scientifically suitable--in a word, safe."</TE>
<TE>   Yucca Mountain is not a done deal yet, but converting this forlorn
peak into the world's first high-level nuclear waste dump is closer
to happening than ever.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has chosen the site, but Nevada challenged that
decision. Congress is considering whether to overturn Nevada's veto,
and opponents of the dump acknowledge they probably do not have the
votes to stop it. (A House vote might occur as early as today.) If
the Yucca Mountain plan survives Congress, the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission will consider issuing a license, and the dump could open
by 2012.</TE>
<TE>   Experts long ago recognized the need for deep, geological disposal
of radioactive waste, yet it is unknown whether any system can be
devised that could keep highly radioactive waste isolated for such an
immensely long period.</TE>
<TE>   "We nuclear people have made a Faustian bargain with society,"
said Alvin Weinberg, former director of the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory in Tennessee, where plutonium was tested for one of the
nuclear bombs dropped on Japan. "We offer an inexhaustible and
nonpolluting source of energy, but we require a level of detail and
discipline that we're unaccustomed to in handling the waste.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody really knows if we can do this. Trying to project what's
going to happen in thousands of years, tens of thousands of years, is
quite ridiculous," Weinberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Yucca Mountain is an island in a desert. It is surrounded
by the Nevada Test Site, where the government once tested nuclear
bombs. The closest neighbors are a handful of alfalfa growers in the
Amargosa Valley, 11 miles from Yucca Mountain, and the working girls
at the Cherry Patch No. 2 brothel by a gas station that peddles
T-shirts with pictures of extraterrestrials.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can't put it here, then where can you put it?" asked
Michael D. Voegele, chief scientist for Bechtel-SAIC Co., the Energy
Department's contractor for building the repository at Yucca
Mountain.</TE>
<TE>   But who can say what will be here millions of years from now when
plutonium and other deadly wastes still pack a wallop? Will it still
be a desert? Glaciers advanced and receded across the planet a dozen
times in the last 2 million years. An inland sea called Lake
Bonneville covered much of Nevada and Utah 12,000 years ago, when
humans first arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "These technologies are forcing us to address the issue of how
they will affect future generations. This is not an issue we've faced
on this scale before," said Lester R. Brown, president of the Earth
Policy Institute. "We're doing things with consequences we don't
understand."</TE>
<TE>   Government engineers and scientists have been studying Yucca
Mountain for more than 20 years--twice as long as it took to plan and
complete the moon landing--at a cost of $7 billion. During that time,
government officials have changed their arguments about Yucca
Mountain's safety.</TE>
<TE>   Problems began to emerge years ago when tunnels bored deep into
the rock revealed conditions inside were wetter, and the geology more
complex, than initially thought. Those discoveries are at the center
of the controversy today.</TE>
<TE>   Originally, the volcanic ash where the waste would be entombed was
believed to be so tightly compressed that rainfall could not
penetrate. Secretary Abraham said in February that rainfall would
take 1,000 years to make the 800-foot journey through rock to the
disposal zone and longer still before radioactivity could be carried
to groundwater. He does not believe leaks are a significant concern.</TE>
<TE>   Yet inside the mountain, government studies have found that the
rock is laced with fissures, some that move water the way capillaries
carry blood, some that flow like a garden hose. About 12.3 million
gallons of water flow through the 2,500-acre disposal area per year,
government studies show.</TE>
<TE>   Traces of chlorine 36, which is produced only by nuclear bombs,
were recently discovered inside Yucca Mountain. Since the last
nuclear bombs were detonated above ground at the Nevada Test Site in
1962, the finding indicates rainfall can carry radioactive material
deep into the rock in as little as 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   Once the presence of water was established, the government changed
plans. The plans now call for double-layer disposal containers of
stainless steel and a nickel-based material called Alloy 22 to keep
the waste isolated.</TE>
<TE>   The canisters will be covered with titanium "drip shields" to keep
waste dry. Canisters could be packed close together too, so heat
would boil water and drive away steam.</TE>
<TE>   But engineers do not know know how to build a container that
outlasts radioactive waste.</TE>
<TE>   Materials like Alloy 22 haven't been around long enough for
experts to be able to assess how they will perform over centuries.</TE>
<TE>   Given all of the uncertainties, some of the nation's leading
experts say President Bush's decision to proceed with Yucca Mountain
is premature.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of issues that remain unresolved that could
affect the safety of humans and the environment," said Allison
Macfarlane, a geologist and the director of the Yucca Mountain
project at MIT. "We should not be in a rush."</TE>
<TE>   Carnegie Mellon University President Jared L. Cohon said he is
concerned about the integrity of disposal canisters and how water
moves inside the mountain. Cohon chairs the Nuclear Waste Technical
Review Board, an 11-member panel of independent experts appointed by
Congress to review the Energy Department's work at Yucca Mountain.</TE>
<TE>   That panel concluded in January that the government's technical
case for Yucca Mountain is "weak to moderate."</TE>
<TE>   Said Cohon: "What is very important is that, in assessing the
suitability of the site, decision makers and the public must
understand what the uncertainty is. The uncertainty is substantial."</TE>

<CX>   Yucca Mountain--A May 8 story in Section A incorrectly reported that
half the plutonium to be disposed at the proposed Yucca Mountain
nuclear waste site in Nevada would remain radioactive for 380 million
years. Some radioactive isotopes will last that long or longer, but
much of it will not.</CX>
