<HD>How a toy maker put young minds to constructive play</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bernadette Murphy</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A.C. Gilbert was a turn-of-the-20th-century Renaissance man: a
gold-medal-winning Olympic athlete in the pole vault, a Yale-trained
physician (though he never practiced medicine), a wow-'em magician
specializing in sleight of hand, and a successful inventor. He was
known to many as the boy who never grew up, and his greatest
achievements were born of a profound fascination with playthings,
explains Bruce Watson in "The Man Who Changed How Boys and Toys Were
Made," a profile of Gilbert and the role his famed Erector Set played
in developing the psyche of the early- to mid-20th century American
boy.</LD>
<LD>   The year was 1911, journalist Watson tells us, when Gilbert,
"twenty-seven going on seven," was riding the train to perform magic
tricks in the Manhattan storefront window of Mysto, his
do-it-yourself magic trick company. As the city's skyline came into
view, Gilbert gazed in rapture at the tall steel girders. "Wouldn't
it be great fun to build towers like these in miniature? Wouldn't
boys like him just itch to get their hands on them and start building
bridges, cranes, and derricks right in their own living rooms?"</LD>
<TE>   The following year, Gilbert produced a working prototype of his
Erector Set; by 1912 he was hosting toy buyers demonstrate his
creation, and within three years, Erector had racked up more than $1
million in sales. (This when the American toy industry was still in
its infancy and toy sales domestically were only around $10 million a
year. Gilbert is credited with creating the category of "educational"
toy.)</TE>
<TE>   In this knowledgeable, if at times dry, account, Watson probes
beyond Gilbert's life and iconic toy invention. He considers the
zeitgeist that allowed Erector to gain its prominence. The toy
addressed society's "boy problem" by giving unruly boys something
constructive to do with their pent-up energy; Gilbert's marketing
genius changed how products, particularly toys, were pitched to
children. He offered young builders extravagant prizes for the best
inventions, wrote personal-sounding letters to "his boys" and
bestowed the coveted Expert Engineer distinction upon those who
proved themselves worthy by sending in photos of finished models.</TE>
<TE>   The most fascinating story Watson tells is of the near-loss of the
1918 Christmas toy season. World War I was in full swing when the
Council of National Defense proposed a ban on all toy sales in
deference to the military effort. The Toy Manufacturers of America,
led by Gilbert, met with the council to oppose the ban. There, with
goods in hand, Gilbert winningly argued that toys were not mere
playthings but the "blueprints of future men and women who would
fight wars and preserve the peace. Deprive youngsters of toys,
especially educational toys, and 'the country will lose a generation
of doctors, engineers and scientists.' " The council members were
wooed. "Like kids making their first visit to FAO Schwarz, they
marveled and played, reached and grabbed .... The secretary of the
Navy picked up a toy submarine ... the secretary of Commerce sat
examining a toy steam engine." Perhaps, the council concluded, toys
were essential to a wartime economy.</TE>
<TE>   The book introduces readers to Erector-fueled ingenuity, and how
passion for building and inventing among boys seemed to have
blossomed for a generation or two and then faded, but not before
having an effect on countless lives and engineering feats. (Did you
know that the first artificial heart pump, designed to keep blood
moving during heart surgery, was made by a medical student with an
Erector Set, and that the process for making soft contact lenses was
perfected with the help of an old phonograph and little Erector Set
pieces?) Though Gilbert himself was often portrayed in the media as
an overgrown boy, a kind of Peter Pan, it's notable that he seldom
smiled and that executives who worked with him never saw him laugh.
His friends found him "about as childlike as your average IRS
auditor," Watson reports.</TE>
<TE>   The book, unfortunately, suffers from a similar fate. In
attempting to connect with his subject matter, Watson, who hadn't
been a huge fan of the toy as a child, obtains a classic Erector Set
and tries to interest his son in building with him, but to no avail.
He manages to construct, solo, a pre-designed "lift bridge," though
he says he "didn't have much fun doing it." Finally, he plans and
builds his own creation -- an off-kilter version of the Eiffel Tower
-- which becomes an escapade of drudgery and duty. Watson's lack of
passion for the Erector experience translates to scant enthusiasm on
the page.</TE>
<TE>   The account is missing a crucial component. Readers may sift
through the various tales, finding usable parts and absorbing stories
here and there, but they will find no sense of what makes for genuine
Erector magic: fun.</TE>

<HD>Castro video set to air on Univision</HD>
<DH>Tape, smuggled out of Cuba, will be seen in New York and
Miami. There are no plans to broadcast it locally.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Calvo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A home video smuggled out of Cuba that evidently depicts secretive
Cuban leader Fidel Castro in his "pajamas and slippers" was scheduled
to air Monday night on the New York and Miami affiliates of
Univision, the largest Spanish-language television network in the
country. There are no plans to air the program locally.</LD>
<LD>   "You see a good part of the house in which he lives. He seems a
little decrepit," said reporter Mario Vallejo, the former Havana
television reporter who arrived in Miami in 1997 and now works for
Univision's Noticias 23/WLTV there. "He knows his children are making
a video. He is simply eating a grapefruit."</LD>
<LD>   Vallejo's video, if proved to be authentic, may be the first
public look at Castro's home, its layout and security. Castro has
long been rumored to sleep in a different bed each night, but
Vallejo, in an interview in Spanish from Miami with The Times on
Monday afternoon, said the 76-year-old revolutionary now lives
permanently in the home called Punto Cero.</LD>
<TE>   According to Vallejo, the video was smuggled off the Caribbean
island by Dashiell Torralba, an ex-girlfriend of one of Castro's
grown sons, Dr. Antonio Castro Soto del Valle. Vallejo said he has
shown it to architecture professors at Florida International
University to prove its veracity, but that could not be immediately
confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   The special, titled "The Secret Life of Castro," contains about
six minutes of new footage each night, interspersed by interviews
with Torralba and Castro's sister Juanita and daughter Alina
Fernandez Revuelta. Fernandez, who has lived in Spain and the United
States over the last few years, denounced her father in a 1998
autobiography, "Castro's Daughter: An Exile's Memoir of Cuba."</TE>
<TE>   A network spokeswoman for Univision did not have any comment, but
at least one news director with the company confirmed it will be
shown over the course of 10 nights on Univision affiliates in New
York and Miami, the U.S. cities with the largest Cuban exile
populations. The 10-part series airs this week, at 6 p.m. and 11 p.m.
and will continue Tuesday through Friday and Nov. 18-22. "It can't be
a fake," Vallejo said. "There are too many people in it."</TE>

<HD>Clooney's music, spirit echo on</HD>
<DH>At a listening party, a CD of the late singer's final
concert is played. Merv Griffin announces a tribute to raise funds
for lung disease research.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ann Conway</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hearing the husky voice, the tender lyrics, Monsita Botwick pulled a
white handkerchief from her beaded handbag and dabbed her eyes.
"We'll get through it," whispered her sister, Maria Murdock. "I'm
going to pretend like I'm not even hearing this right now." The tune
was "Happiness Is a Thing Called Joe," a number their mother, the
late Rosemary Clooney, loved to sing for their father, Jose Ferrer.
And here was the pop legend's warm and loving version of it, filling
a private room at Trader Vic's at the Beverly Hilton Hotel during a
listening party for Clooney's new album, "The Last Concert." "This
night is horrible and wonderful. I never wanted this day to come,"
Botwick said. "Yet this CD is fantastic, and I am so proud of it."</LD>
<LD>   About 50 guests, including Clooney's sons, Gabriel and Rafael
Ferrer, and her close friends Michael Feinstein and Merv Griffin,
gathered in the tropical-themed haunt last week to share old memories
and hear selections from her performance with the Honolulu Symphony
Pops. "It was our incredible luck to have captured it," Concord
Records President Glen A. Barros said of last November's concert on
Oahu. "We couldn't have known that the symphony demo being recorded
that night would turn into Rosemary's last concert." Clooney died in
June of complications from lung cancer at age 74.</LD>
<TE>   Enjoying cocktails and island-inspired appetizers, partygoers
relaxed on cushy banquettes or stood in small groups as they shared
tales such as the one recounted by Gabriel Ferrer, as he introduced
his mother's only recording of Irving Berlin's "God Bless America."
"I remember every once in a while Mr. Berlin would call the house [on
North Roxbury Drive in Beverly Hills] when I was about 14 or 15, and
I would think it was some goofball and ask, 'Mr. Berlin, as in
Irving?' And my mom, from her den chair, would scream, 'Give me the
phone!' "</TE>
<TE>   Griffin recalled the first night he met the singer, who found fame
in 1951 with the novelty hit "Come On-a My House" and in recent years
had appeared at top-notch cabaret clubs and concert stages. "It was
probably the late '40s, and I met her at Virginia Beach, Va. I was
singing with the Freddy Martin band and she and her sister, Betty,
were singing with Tony Pastor's big band. I introduced myself and we
had a great time. At the end of the evening, her entire band walked
into the ocean with their clothes on. I said, 'Rosie, you've really
got yourself a band!' "</TE>
<TE>   Clooney was his "second mother," said Feinstein, a pianist and
singer known for his lush treatment of standards. "When I made my
first recording, I was nervous about it and asked if she would sing
with me. She came to the studio, gave me some coaching. Her style was
confident, witty, sexy, but mostly heartfelt. She was always
connected to her heart when she sang, and I think that's what made
her a star."</TE>
<TE>   Also on the party agenda: the announcement by Griffin of a
memorial tribute to the singer on Dec. 10 at his Beverly Hilton Hotel
to benefit the Mayo Clinic Rosemary Clooney Pulmonary Research Fund.
"She was at Mayo Clinic for four months and they were so wonderful to
her that she wanted to do something for people who are afflicted with
lung disorders," Murdock explained.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be one of the great nights, with Tony Bennett, George
Clooney, Diana Krall, Keely Smith, Linda Ronstadt, Debby Boone and
more," Griffin told the crowd. "And I know Rosie will be there
watching and loving every second of it."</TE>

<KH>JAZZ</KH>
<HD>To swing is also to serve</HD>
<DH>The Air Force's jazz band flies its own route to the wild
blue yonder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lynell George</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You suspect from the outset that this isn't going to be your typical
jazz set: a room full of gold braid and epaulets, patent-leather
dress pumps, Air Force service caps -- and nary a soul patch in the
house.</LD>
<LD>   But what really hips you to this being something very different is
that at a shade after 3 p.m. -- exactly when the program says it will
-- things actually start rolling.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not used to such efficiency!" marvels Helen Borgers, the KKJZ
(88.1) DJ and the afternoon's emcee, standing behind a microphone at
the lip of the Wadsworth Theater stage.</LD>
<TE>   On this Saturday afternoon, with Veteran's Day approaching,
Borgers and a couple hundred folks have braved the gray and damp to
support and celebrate "America's classical music" -- jazz in its many
meters and colors -- by listening to the musicians who perform it to
serve their country the best way they know how.</TE>
<TE>   The 18-piece Airmen of Note, one of eight ensembles that make up
the organization known as the United States Air Force Band, has its
marching orders: to spread the word about both the history and the
influence of jazz. The "Note" (as the outfit is commonly known), grew
from the grand tradition of Maj. Glenn Miller's Army Air Forces dance
band and has been performing, educating and -- any member is quick to
tell you -- providing regular paying gigs for musicians for more than
50 years.</TE>
<TE>   Spread across the stage on risers in big-band formation, the
members of the Note look like they're in a sepia-toned mantle
photograph, all attired in the khaki uniform of the period -- "down
to their brown shoes" -- as one long-timer points out with an
approving nod.</TE>
<TE>   While artists and arts advocates have long complained that the
government spends more on military bands than funding the National
Endowment for the Arts, this focus of service and its dedication to
one of America's oldest art forms is largely a secret.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just one of the 150 career choices in the Air Force,"
Sgt. Maj. Dudley Hinote tells the audience, in the only overt
recruiting moment of the afternoon. But, embedded within the
feel-good performance outreach, as band members spread the word about
"America's music," they definitely see this as a sure-fire way to
improvise on the tune of investing in one's country.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly in this time of uncertainty, as the country prepares
for a possible war, being a part of this ensemble has made many of
the members think deeply about their role in the nation's conflict by
connecting it to its past.</TE>
<TE>   "People see this uniform and immediately think, 'Oh, the Ugly
American.' But then the music starts and the foot gets tapping ... "
says tenor saxophone player Senior Master Sgt. Saul Miller Jr. "I
know it's a cliche, but really, we see it all of the time. Music is
the universal language."</TE>
<TE>   With a one, two, three, they swing into a brisk set of
compositions that segue into one another as in an old-time radio
broadcast. A bright, ringing brass section sinks us into into a pair
of Duke Ellington tunes, "Take the 'A' Train" and "Cottontail,"
followed by Count Basie's "April in Paris." Before the end we'll be
romanced by Vernon Duke's "Autumn in New York" and be reminded again
why life is so grand by Louis Armstrong: "Struttin' With Some
Barbecue."</TE>
<TE>   At the piano, Master Sgt. Steve Erickson tears up on "Cottontail."
Next, Tech. Sgt. Darden Safley teases her way through "Too Close for
Comfort," in a voice that is as elegant and no frills as her navy
blue evening gown. And Miller heats everything up on Glenn Miller's
arrangement of "Anvil Chorus." After a solo, each player takes a
polite, stiff-backed bow.</TE>
<TE>   An open chair in the band is hard to come by, turnover is almost
nil and that makes those 18 spots some of the most coveted in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of them put in a good 15-year career. It's a tough spot to
get," says Chief Master Sgt. David Nokes, former singer and now
director of public affairs for the Air Force Band. "For many, it is a
permanent duty assignment of 20 years or more."</TE>
<TE>   It's a full career that boasts high-profile perks -- White House
gigs, music festivals and showcases that have featured guest artists
such as Clark Terry, James Moody, Doc Severinsen and Bill Watrous.</TE>
<TE>   Some, indeed, move on to careers outside, including arranger Sammy
Nestico (who was responsible for keeping the Note's sound current, or
"Tonight Show's" Tommy Newsom, who has also, over the years, done
arranging and composing duties.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, openings are advertised in show biz trade publications,
says trombonist Master Sgt. Joe Jackson, 37, who happened to hear of
an empty chair via word-of-mouth and was invited to Washington to
audition. He's been playing in the band since 1991.</TE>
<TE>   "Before I joined the Airmen of Note, I toured full time with the
Maynard Ferguson Band.... That experience presented a tremendous
opportunity for me to play with a fantastic bunch of musicians ...
[but] the prospect of having a family while I'm away earning a living
on the road 10 months per year was, to say the least, not the way
that I would want to raise children."</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, you get paid to play. How can you beat that?" asks
saxophonist Miller, who is big brother to the Southern California
basketball royalty Cheryl and Reggie Miller. "I always tell people,
'I play saxophone the way that Reggie plays basketball.' "</TE>
<TE>   Originally from Riverside, Miller had tried to drum up gigs.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd played on the outside. But it was difficult to get paid. You
almost have to go to Europe just to get a date," says Miller, 46,
who's been a member for 18 years. "And here you're playing with the
top 1% of the musicians in the country."</TE>
<TE>   It is also a fancier gig than cover bands or lounge gigs. As jazz
has made its stylistic turns through the decades -- bop, post-bop,
Latin, fusion, soft, smooth -- the Note has become a living, touring
reference library. As fewer and fewer big bands tour, the ensemble
makes its way across the country twice a year -- spring and fall --
as part of its National Department of Defense community relations
tours. The current chief arranger, Master Sgt. Alan Baylock, balances
the Note's commitment to tradition with splashes of innovation.</TE>
<TE>   The leading focus is education. On this trip to Los Angeles, the
Note spent an afternoon at Washington Preparatory High School in
South Los Angeles, hosting workshops with students and working with
their campus jazz band. The Note also hosts a Jazz Heritage Series
and annually presents the Sammy Nestico Award, for which civilians --
American citizens under age 35 -- can send in big-band charts; the
winner is flown to Washington and awarded a commission.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great way to be able to serve your country," reflects
Jackson. "People have this image, even still, that we're stiff.
Serious. That the only way that the armed forces can solve conflicts
is through violence. But what we learn -- and spread through music --
is that we as a culture can pull together. And one of the ways we can
do it is through music.</TE>
<TE>   "We're deployed as a weapons system," explains Jackson, "we're
referred to as a weapon system ... but this way you're pulling on
heartstrings."</TE>
<TE>   As for the "stiff" thing, well they've got that taken care of too.
If there was any fear that these guys are too square to swing, when
Borgers comes out to announce a couple of numbers, they brush her
back to the wings with one more coda, as they all go flying home.</TE>
<TE>   "Wow, that was hip," Borgers signs off with a giggle. "Really hip,
guys."</TE>

<HD>Movie retreads on the skids</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In recent years, everyone in the movie business has been scrambling
to churn out sequels, remakes and retreads, justifying the unseemly
artistic results by trumpeting the killing they've made at the box
office. Well, if you've been keeping tabs over the past six weeks,
the scorecard reads: Moviegoers: 5. Risk-Averse Studios: 1.</LD>
<LD>   If you'd put your ear to the door at almost any studio in town
last week, you could've heard someone saying, "Geez, maybe getting
audiences to spend $9.50 for a half-baked update of a (fill in the
blank: TV spy show/'30s adventure movie/'60s thriller/'70s art-house
classic) isn't such a slam-dunk after all."</LD>
<TE>   The muttering was especially loud at Sony Pictures, where the
studio's supposed sure thing "I Spy" staggered into the theaters with
a feeble $12-million opening weekend. "The Four Feathers," a lavish
remake co-financed by Paramount and Miramax, did even worse, making
$18 million in its brief stay in theaters. "Swept Away," the
Madonna-starring remake of Lina Wertmuller's 1975 original,
disappeared after making a paltry $598,000 in its short run. Jonathan
Demme's "The Truth About Charlie," an update of Stanley Donen's
"Charade," has stumbled badly, barely doing $4 million in its first
two weeks. Even the $90-million "Red Dragon," a third installment in
the Hannibal Lecter series that was supposed to be Universal's big
moneymaker this year, has been such a lackluster performer that it
probably won't hit the $100-million mark, a steep drop-off from last
year's $165-million-grossing "Hannibal" sequel.</TE>
<TE>   The only retread to have a solid opening was Disney's "Santa
Clause 2," which has made about $60 million in its first two weeks.
Even it will be hard-pressed to top the original, which made $144
million in 1994 and was so well-liked that it did better in its third
weekend of release than its first.</TE>
<TE>   The common denominator with nearly every failure was a woeful
absence of originality, not to mention ambition. No matter how hard
Hollywood tries to brainwash moviegoers into embracing familiarity,
when we gather in the dark we crave something fresh and new. Maybe
that's why films such as "The Ring," "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" and
"Barbershop" have found such surprisingly large, loyal audiences.</TE>
<TE>   Making movies is never going to be a risk-free business. In recent
years studio chieftains have extolled franchise movies the way
1999-era stock analysts used to puff up dot-com IPOs. Sequels were
the showbiz equivalent of easy money, providing a soothing
predictability to a notoriously topsy-turvy business. Even the
vocabulary changed -- studio tycoons began talking about movies as if
they were part of a stock portfolio. Asked last year about Warner
Bros.' studio-wide efforts to launch dozens of different franchises,
Chairman Barry Meyer enthused, "We're looking to extend these
properties over multiple platforms" -- now there's a phrase to get
moviegoers' hearts pumping.</TE>
<TE>   But not every property has been a winner like "Austin Powers" or
"Rush Hour." Billed as this summer's big kid hit, "Stuart Little 2"
was a crushing disappointment. "The Scorpion King," a much-touted
spinoff of the "Mummy" series, did less than half the business of the
"Mummy" sequel.</TE>
<TE>   Studios are now making sequels out of films that didn't even make
$60 million at the box office. "It used to be that a film had to make
$100 million to justify a sequel," says industry box-office expert
Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "Now all a film has to do is have a big opening weekend. Sometimes
people don't even look at the end results."</TE>
<TE>   "I Spy" was viewed as a can't-miss hit, but now the industry's
Monday morning quarterbacks are searching for answers. It's deeply
ingrained in Hollywood culture that there must be an explanation for
every flop; no one likes to admit that audiences turned up their
noses because the movie -- heaven forbid -- was unwatchable.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the blame for "I Spy's" demise is being placed on the
usual suspects: the marketing campaign, which was especially insipid
even by major studio standards, and the stars, in particular Eddie
Murphy, who has now headlined three consecutive bombs, with "I Spy"
following "Pluto Nash" and "Showtime." Murphy's casting offers a
classic example of how clueless Hollywood can be. "I Spy" was aimed
at a young male audience, which looks at Murphy and sees ... Bill
Cosby. The right star for the picture would've been DMX or Ice Cube,
hip-hop icons who have credibility with young male moviegoers.
(Witness Eminem, whose film, "8 Mile," had a huge opening this week-
end.)</TE>
<TE>   Co-star Owen Wilson gets off easier, though many view him as an
actor whose quirky charm goes over in Hollywood and New York -- and
almost nowhere in between.</TE>
<TE>   "I Spy" turned out to be an old TV title, like Will Smith's "Wild
Wild West," which had no resonance with anyone under 40. Even its
premise felt dated. There have been so many seismic changes in
America's youth culture over the past few years that the whole "I
Spy" hook -- teaming a black hipster with a repressed white guy --
has a been-there-seen-that vibe with young moviegoers.</TE>
<TE>   Talk about being behind the curve: Hollywood has become
relentlessly brand-conscious at precisely the time when Madison
Avenue has discovered that young consumers have less brand loyalty
than ever before. Exploiting a brand is fine if you're promoting
family fare like "Harry Potter" or "Shrek" (parents live for the
arrival of a reassuring brand), but it carries increasingly less
weight with teens.</TE>
<TE>   Today's most effective advertising sells attitude, not brand. If
movie execs want a scary lesson in diminished brand loyalty, just
look at the music business, where fans have become totally
song-oriented, leaving artists in the lurch. Alanis Morissette's
"Jagged Little Pill" sold 14.1 million copies; her follow-up album
sold 2.5 million copies. Lauren Hill's "Miseducation" CD sold 6.2
million copies; her follow-up CD, released earlier this year, has
sold only 432,000 copies.</TE>
<TE>   This audience capriciousness has already seeped into the movies:
Just ask the makers of "Scary Movie," whose sure-thing sequel did
barely 40% the business of the original.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean sequels are inherent evils: I wouldn't miss "The
Matrix Reloaded" or "Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" or "X-Men 2,"
and I'm looking forward to seeing what David Fincher can do with the
"Mission Impossible" franchise and Alfonso Cuaron does with the third
"Harry Potter." But those films are in the hands of filmmakers who
thrive on risk and daring. My hopes aren't as high for "Scooby-Doo
2."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   The second time around</TE>
<TE>   Here's a look at a few upcoming sequels I'm betting have
especially questionable commercial prospects.</TE>
<TE>   "Tomb Raider 2"</TE>
<TE>   The original made $131 million last year, but the number that
counts is 59%, which is the amount the film dropped in its second
weekend of business, a sign of deep dissatisfaction. More worrisome,
the film's star, Angelina Jolie, is no longer the industry's It Girl.
Her fan base has moved on to other female stars, and her last two
vehicles, "Life or Something Like It" and "Original Sin," were bombs.
The sequel, due next summer, is being directed by Jan De Bont, who is
many things but not a career rejuvenator.</TE>
<TE>   "Final Destination 2"</TE>
<TE>   New Line has lots of valuable franchises, but this isn't one of
them. The original was a low-budget surprise, doing $53 million in
2000. But the sequel, due next year, has a no-name cast and a
first-time director who is best known as a second-unit director. The
sequel is being positioned as a date-night thriller, but it'll need a
great trailer and release date to make you believe this will work any
better than "Town and Country 2."</TE>
<TE>   "Jeepers Creepers 2"</TE>
<TE>   The original, a low-budget MGM horror flick, made $37.5 million,
but it opened on Labor Day, the least-competitive weekend of the
year. The sequel, due in April, will be up against stiffer
competition. "Scream" was a real franchise. Jeepers, shouldn't this
be a direct-to-video sequel?</TE>
<TE>   "Shanghai Knights"</TE>
<TE>   The original, "Shanghai Noon," which teamed Jackie Chan with Owen
Wilson, only did $57 million here (and even less overseas), despite
the presence of Chan, who supposedly has a big international fan
base. The sequel, due next year, will be a true test of whether
Wilson can connect with a mainstream audience.</TE>
<TE>   "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"</TE>
<TE>   Due out July 4, 2003, this movie cost about $150 million, which is
more than the total domestic gross of Arnold Schwarzenegger's last
three features together. Without "Terminator" creator James Cameron
or a young name-actor on board, this looks like a huge financial
risk. Warners paid $50 million for the domestic distribution rights,
but the studio still has to persuade me that seeing Arnold battle a
bunch of bad guys would be as interesting as watching him run for
governor of California.</TE>

<HD>When neighbors spoil the view</HD>
<DH>The new cathedral and posh Disney Hall have others itching
to fix up. The county's on the job, but money's a problem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry Gordon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The priests who make their home in the residence attached to the new
Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in downtown Los Angeles have a
lot to be thankful for. Brand new digs and, more important, just
outside their door are wonderful sculptures, lovely fountains and an
inspirational place to worship.</LD>
<LD>   However, part of the view leaves something to be desired. Some of
the residence's windows look directly out onto a steam-belching
energy plant just across Hill Street. Pipes, cooling towers,
industrial vents and some stained tile and metal walls stare back.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not L.A's most beautiful building," said one resident, Msgr.
Terrance Fleming, who recently resigned his administrative position
in the Roman Catholic archdiocese of Los Angeles. Then, with the tact
of a neighbor: "I hope they would do something with it."</LD>
<TE>   He may just get his wish.</TE>
<TE>   And Los Angeles may get lessons in how much the true nature of any
structure can or should be camouflaged and how cities can combine
urbanism with utilitarianism.</TE>
<TE>   In more residential areas, when something big, new and shiny goes
up, neighbors suddenly look at their own houses with more critical
eyes. Paint jobs, re-sodding, new roofs and expansions then are
launched.</TE>
<TE>   Call it shame or civic duty, the county government is no exception
to that basic fixer itch on a big scale. But instead of a
mini-mansion as the goad, the driving forces are the recent
completion of the cathedral and the continuing construction of the
Walt Disney Concert Hall. Plus, a sense of trying to aid downtown's
renewal.</TE>
<TE>   The potential fixer-uppers are that Central Heating and
Refrigeration Plant near the cathedral and an Erector Set-looking
multilevel parking structure on Bunker Hill directly in front of
Disney Hall's swooping stainless steel facade.</TE>
<TE>   The county government, which owns both the plant and garage, hired
the A.C. Martin Partners architectural firm in April to generate
beautification ideas for those non-masterpieces of functional design.
The recently completed designs from the $38,000 contract are not
likely to be constructed quickly because of county budget problems.
Still, they have stirred a lot of discussion.</TE>
<TE>   "We are exploring things we might be able to do to enhance the
appearance of these structures," said Sharon Yonashiro, the county's
real estate asset manager. "I think it's the right thing to think
about.</TE>
<TE>   "It's part of our new awareness," she added, "of the importance of
the urban landscape."</TE>
<TE>   Construction costs are estimated at about $2 million for the
energy plant and $1.5 million for the parking structure.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the cost, the biggest challenge, everyone involved
emphasizes, is that the power facility cannot be shut down and any
new design elements cannot interfere with its operations. After all,
the square-block power plant between Broadway, Hill, Temple Street
and the 101 Freeway produces steam for heating and chilled water for
air conditioning and sends those through tunnels and underground
pipes to about a dozen buildings in the Civic Center, including
courthouses and theaters. (The cathedral receives the cold water
too.) As a byproduct, the facility also generates 30 megawatts of
electricity.</TE>
<TE>   All that cannot be made to look like a cutesy boutique, no matter
how many flowering vines are planted along its walls or bright paint
splashed onto cooling towers. Environmental and worker safety must be
maintained and clearance for trucks and cranes kept open. So, the
structure can't be wrapped up, a la Christo, to resemble a giant
hookah pipe with it puffs of white smoke emitting.</TE>
<TE>   David Martin, design principal of his family's multigenerational
architecture firm, offered several concepts for the power plant.
After review by county officials, the final version is sort of an
artistic peek-a-boo.</TE>
<TE>   In the model, translucent sculptural screens of perforated or
woven metal are folded into crisp shapes and cover about two-thirds
of the plant's exterior. Along the top, a similar form creates a type
of crown. Much more landscaping by the sidewalk could soften the
industrial flavor. Everything might glow at night from lights behind
the screens.</TE>
<TE>   The original energy plant had some elegance to it, Martin said,
but later additions over the past 50 years or so created a
hodgepodge. "We are not trying to disguise the fact that it's a power
plant," explained Martin. "Our idea was to restore the original and,
in a very sculptural way, screen off the various additions to give it
a sense of drama in the city."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, he concedes, there is "some whimsy" to his folded screen,
some of which would be as large as 70 feet high. However, nothing in
the plan would impede the work inside or the steam tunnels below.</TE>
<TE>   That was important to Howard Choy, the county's energy division
manager. He said he understands "the desire to sort of make the whole
downtown area have some sort of identity or uniqueness to it. My job
is to make sure whatever they design doesn't interfere with operation
and functionality. I give them credit that they avoided that."</TE>
<TE>   Asked what he thought about the proposal aesthetically, Choy
declined to comment. "I'm an engineer. What can I say?"</TE>
<TE>   A few blocks away, the open-air parking structure with about 700
spaces is clearly hurting sightlines of Frank Gehry's design for
Disney Hall.</TE>
<TE>   The parking structure, which officials recall was constructed as a
temporary measure in the '70s, might be demolished in a few years as
development of Bunker Hill continues. But in the meantime it is
needed for jurors, courthouse visitors, county employees and others.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a temporary, altogether Tinker Toy garage that wasn't
supposed to last more than a couple of years," said architect Martin.
"In an odd kind of way, I like the steel cross members and all that.
But it doesn't fit in with anything else there. It just doesn't
connect to the neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   Martin's proposal to beautify the garage is to cover parts of the
exterior on most sides in sculptural screens of plastic that would
mainly hide the parked cars. For the Grand Avenue side by the concert
hall, something more dramatic is needed, he said. Perhaps crushed
glass could be added into the screens facing Grand and First Street
to create a refraction of headlights at night. Or perhaps a giant
silk screen or photo or mural with a performance theme could be
installed across that facade.</TE>
<TE>   Yonashiro, the county official, said both plans are under study
now and that county's current budget crisis may make the next step
difficult. "We want to try to do something within the constraints of
our budget," she explained.</TE>
<TE>   Fleming, the Roman Catholic priest who lives across from the
energy plant, will get a change of view long before the county makes
a decision on the beautification construction. He is going on a
sabbatical and then, with his resignation from his administrative
post amid the diocese's own money problems, he will be moving out of
the cathedral residence early next year.</TE>

<HD>This kid's cool onstage</HD>
<DH>For Eddie Karr, 15, the key to staying focused in 'The
Visible Horse' is a sort of game with the audience: Don't blink.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hugh Hart</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Until two months ago, Eddie Karr had never been onstage. But when
"The Visible Horse" opened at the Court Theatre on Oct. 17, one day
after his 15th birthday, the towheaded teenager skateboarded onto the
lip of the stage and delivered a 15-minute monologue without missing
a beat.</LD>
<LD>   "Opening night, I'm shaking," he says, "and the director, Lisa
James, told me, 'Go out there, speak clearly, get your point across
and don't get ahead of yourself. Just talk to the audience.' So
that's what I did and -- it worked!"</LD>
<LD>   Karr makes it sound easy, but his performance in Mary Lathrop's
two-character drama, also starring Wendy Phillips, has garnered
critical raves. On stage every minute of the 90-minute show, Karr
plays Scott, a young teenager trying to cope with his father's death.</LD>
<TE>   "The first thing you realize is, he misses his dad, that's for
sure," Karr says. "Scott hides it, but underneath it's really killing
him. And the other thing I could connect to was, Scott's a kid. Like
him, I still play with action figures every once in a while."</TE>
<TE>   Also like most boys his age, Karr is comfortable on wheels. He
saved the prop department a few bucks by bringing his skateboard and
Razor scooter from home to ride around on.</TE>
<TE>   After a recent performance, Karr, dressed in the same sweatshirt
he'd worn onstage, squirmed in a folding chair and tried to explain
the challenge of single-handedly commanding an audience's attention.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes a lot of concentration," he says. "It's like a staring
contest. You go, 'Don't blink, don't blink, don't blink,' and the
second you start to think of something else -- 'Hmmmm, I wonder if
there's a football game coming on tomorrow night?' -- the second you
start drifting off, you'll blink.</TE>
<TE>   "So every night at the beginning of the play, when I hear the
music, I look at Wendy and go, 'I'll see ya!' and my heart's racing
because once I go out there, I can't break [concentration] -- I can't
blink. I'm Scott now. I can't stop for one second because then you're
done for. You can still get the lines right, but the emotions aren't
there, and if that happens, the audience is probably snoring, and you
have to work really hard to get them back."</TE>
<TE>   Karr may be new to the stage, but he's no stranger to show
business. Growing up in Long Island, he landed his first acting role
at age 5, on the soap opera "One Life to Live." After a few months,
he was replaced.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted me to almost get hit by a car," Karr recalls, "but I
was too young for that [kind of stunt] in the state of New York," he
says. "Within one episode, my character went from being a 5-year-old,
freckle-faced redhead, to this dark hair, brown-eyed 10-year-old. He
got to dodge the car. But that's soap opera -- you never have a solid
job."</TE>
<TE>   About that time, Karr took his one and only acting lesson. "I
didn't like it," he says. "I was little. It was boring!" Untutored
but talented, Karr in 1996 won the role of troublemaking nephew
Nathaniel Greene in the television family drama "Promised Land." With
his mother, Ellen, and older sister Terese he moved to Salt Lake
City, where the series was shot. By the time CBS canceled the show in
1999, Karr's parents had divorced. With his sister, newly remarried
mother and stepdad, Karr came west, settling in Santa Clarita. After
he switched from La Mesa Junior High School to home-schooling last
winter, Karr snagged a recurring role in the sitcom "Grounded for
Life" and enjoyed a dramatic turn in "Judging Amy."</TE>
<TE>   Pickings were slim during last spring's TV pilot season, Karr
says, but his luck changed a few weeks ago. Phillips, who'd played
his aunt on "Promised Land," was offered the part of the widow Meg in
"The Visible Horse." She promptly recommended her former cast mate to
director James.</TE>
<TE>   Karr auditioned four times before James decided to entrust him
with the starring role. "This character's got more lines than Iago!"
she says. "I was scared: Could he handle it? Would he have a sure
hand onstage? But I saw just about every child ever born for this
part, and while [many] were quite good, there was something about
Eddie's emotional facility, the way he attacked the part -- he just
got under my skin."</TE>
<TE>   To bring "Visible Horse" to life, Karr realized he'd need to
deepen his craft. "Rather than just pretend all the time, I guess
I've learned how to find the little piece of me that is like Scott,
and then you make it bigger. You kind of mix reality and acting
together."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever technique he uses, Karr gets the job done, especially
during an affecting soliloquy when Scott bids farewell to his dad's
ghost for the last time. "People ask, 'How do you cry?' and somebody
answers, 'Just think of something sad,' " he says. "Well, that never
really worked for me. What works is, you just have to get really into
the scene, and it just happens. You can't sit there and go, 'I have
to cry' or 'I have to get emotional here.' I just listen to the
lines, and then think about how much I love my dad, and my stepdad.
All I have to do is [imagine] my dad's head saying those words --
that's who I see. Just by doing that, it'll get you there."</TE>

<HD>Keith Richards and Cher: Two extremes of aging ungracefully</HD>
<DH>Together they form the end points of our youth-obsessed
culture.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hillary Johnson</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Similar signs might have presaged the fall of the Roman Empire. It
was nothing but an interesting juxtaposition on the newsstand: Cher
on the cover of Good Housekeeping, looking like an ersatz Barbie
doll, and a few covers down, a shirtless Keith Richards on the cover
of Rolling Stone, looking every bit a prehistoric reptile.</LD>
<LD>   Taken together, these two cover models are much more than a study
in beauty and beastliness; they are twinned poster children for a
persona-driven culture that cannot begin to age, because it has never
learned to grow up.</LD>
<LD>   Richards, at 58, looks like he's been staked to an ant hill in the
Gobi desert for the last 40 years and is proud of his status as an
unrepentant and unreformed libertine. If there really were an island
of lost boys, this is what their leader would look like after six
decades of fun and games.</LD>
<TE>   Cher, on the other hand, is as photogenic at 56 as she was at 18
(except that it's creepy now), and speaks often and eloquently about
how much she hates growing old. Lithe as any cheerleader, with a face
as smooth as Tupperware, she's fresh from a rockin', racy concert
tour, so it's difficult to reconcile her image with the fact that the
woman is the same age as President George W. Bush. As gritty as
Richards is, Cher appears equally unscathed. Yet, somehow, they are
emblematic of the same trend.</TE>
<TE>   We have been a youth-obsessed culture for a long time, but look at
these two and suddenly, the buck stops here. Enough already. What's
next? Abe Vigoda in a wife beater?</TE>
<TE>   How long can we sustain the illusion that youth at any price is a
good thing?</TE>
<TE>   Cher, for example, doesn't seem to have aged since the day she was
invented, probably because she isn't a real person. This isn't meant
to insult Cher; she said so herself. According to her, "Cher" is a
fictional character to which she lays no claims of authorship.</TE>
<TE>   Around the same time that David Bowie was inventing Ziggy
Stardust, Sonny Bono was inventing the two-headed creature known as
Sonny and Cher. One of Bono's first creative decisions was to pass a
short Armenian teenager off as a lanky, one-named Cherokee.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike Ziggy, whose creator kept his alter ego on a short
leash and euthanized him once the joke got old, the
celebrity-known-as-Cher divorced her creator and started a solo
career. She succeeded in setting herself up as a powerful multimedia
entertainment franchise, selling movie tickets, CDs, concert tickets,
even shampoo and housewares. With Cher in charge of Cher, the
distinction between woman and character all but disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   But Cher is savvy despite the faintness of her identity, minting
millions from the marketing of her persona. The plastic surgery, the
wigs, the clothes -- each manifestation is an ad campaign selling a
product with a bar code. She has said as much herself, responding to
a plastic-surgery query on ABC news in July by saying, "I'm just
trying to keep the package viable." But Cher the woman seems an oddly
plotless creature.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to age, she is a character with no story line. She has no
childhood, no adolescence, no great love, no middle age, and there is
no dotage in store for her -- Cher is like the runaway replicants in
"Blade Runner," a tragic figure imbued with a soul but lacking the
equipment necessary to complete a normal lifespan.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Richards, while appearing to be Cher's opposite, is just as
impaired. Instead of being frozen in his body, Richards is frozen in
his own adolescence. As a founding member of the Rolling Stones,
Richards began his public life as the quintessential angst-ridden
youth. Drink, smoke, drugs, women, more drugs, more drink, more
smoke. He was ugly at 40; at nearly 60 he is loathsome. This, also,
should not be taken as an insult.</TE>
<TE>   Richards wears his elephant hide with pride, as willfully ugly
inside as he is out. Because of his strange failure to mature,
Richards' ravaged face and body are as fascinating to gaze upon as a
10-car pileup. You can't help looking, because there but for the
grace of God go you.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Cher is a doll-like image of our perfect selves, Richards
is a portrait of our worst-case scenarios, his face a clinical record
of the excesses of the '60s, '70s, '80s and '90s. Here is a man who
has taken all the hits but learned none of the lessons. He is
repulsive, to be sure, but seeing him on the cover of Rolling Stone
is strangely heartening, if only because it shows how many mistakes
the rest of us didn't make, how ordinary and successful we really
are. For most of us, there is little to be gained by achieving Cher's
level of polish, and even fewer of us have the means or the stamina
to remain in a state of protracted adolescence the way Richards has.
But their images are our signposts.</TE>
<TE>   We market our slickest selves on dates and job interviews, and
many a male's midlife crisis seems to take the form of adopting some
level of Richards-esque bad behavior. The one we accept as beauty,
the other as truth.</TE>
<TE>   They are the end points of our youth-obsessed culture. Don't
worry, it's probably just a phase, a kind of cultural adolescence
we'll all eventually grow out of -- around the same time Keith
Richards grows up and Cher grows old.</TE>

<HD>In stores now: a fantasy face-off</HD>
<DH>Fans of 'Star Wars' won't be disappointed, but the four
discs of 'Lord of the Rings' hold superb extras.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Filmmakers George Lucas and Peter Jackson both have beards,
wire-rimmed glasses and masses of thick hair. Their respective films,
"Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones" and "The Lord of the
Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," are fantasies filled with
otherworldly creatures, exploring age-old themes of good and evil.
Both directors use cutting-edge digital technology to bring their
colorful universes to life, and both tapped veteran actor Christopher
Lee to play the bad guy.</LD>
<LD>   Lucas and Jackson also are the stars and the guiding forces behind
the DVDs of their films, which arrive today in lavish collector's
sets. But that's really where the similarities end. Lucas, who relies
almost totally on digitally created effects, sets and characters to
tell his story, is quiet, reserved and has an almost analytical,
scientific approach to filmmaking. Jackson, who uses
computer-generated imagery in "Lord of the Rings" but doesn't rely on
computers, is lively, passionate and comes across as almost a
real-life hobbit.</LD>
<LD>   Their attitudes and personalities are reflected in their films.
"Star Wars" has some terrific action sequences, but the dialogue and
performances from his actors are leaden and uneasy.</LD>
<TE>   It's ironic that the most lifelike performance in the film is from
the digitally created Yoda. Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" features
wonderfully written scenes, spectacular action sequences, lovely
performances and a sense of wonderment that "Star Wars II" lacks.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the digital edition of "Star Wars: Episode II" (Fox, $30)
should more than satisfy fans of the series, as it is filled with
documentaries, deleted scenes and audio commentary.</TE>
<TE>   The two-disc set, available in wide screen or pan and scan,
features a terrific transfer from the original digitally shot film
and fact-filled commentary from Lucas, producer Rick McCallum,
picture and sound designer Ben Burtt, Industrial Light &amp; Magic
animation director Rob Coleman -- who is the most interesting of the
lot -- and visual effects supervisors Pablo Helman, John Knoll and
Ben Snow.</TE>
<TE>   The second disc features eight deleted scenes, including Padme
(Natalie Portman) addressing the senate; an extended arrival sequence
between Anakin (Hayden Christensen) and Padme on Naboo; a visit by
Padme and Anakin to her parent's house; and Anakin and Padme on
trial. Lucas and McCallum talk about why each scene was cut. Truth be
told, most of the scenes between Anakin and Padme are excruciatingly
dull.</TE>
<TE>   "From Puppets to Pixels: Digital Characters in Episode II" is a
fascinating look at the creation of digital characters for the film
and the challenges of creating Yoda digitally for the first time.
"State of the Art: The Revisualization of Episode II" explores the
role of animatics -- sort of a digital storyboard -- in creating the
film. And "Films Are Not Released: They Escape" looks at the
complicated sound design.</TE>
<TE>   Three slight featurettes examining the story line, action scenes
and love story are woefully slick. But a 12-part documentary that
originated on "starwars.com" is much more inspiring, especially the
featurette on the debate between the use of digital cameras versus
film cameras.</TE>
<TE>   There also are a plethora of production photos, posters, trailers,
TV spots, DVD-ROM goodies and a sly mockumentary, "RD-D2: Beneath the
Dome."</TE>
<TE>   But the DVD can't hold a Jedi light saber to the four-disc "The
Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" (Platinum series
extended edition ) from New Line ($40). It just happens to be one of
the best digital collections ever released. The main caveat is that
you'll need to carve out a few days of your life to get through the
collection, which features an expanded 3 1/2-hour version of the
award-winning adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved novel, four
audio commentaries and six hours of documentaries and other extras.</TE>
<TE>   In August, New Line released a two-disc set of "Lord of the
Rings," but because Jackson was deep into post-production on "The
Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" in New Zealand, he wasn't
available to do the special edition of the film until "Towers" was
completed.</TE>
<TE>   New Line and the producers probably didn't mind having a second
"Fellowship of the Ring" collection to offer in time for the holiday
season.</TE>
<TE>   The first two discs include the expanded version of the film -- 30
minutes longer than the theatrical version. But the extra half-hour
doesn't seem to pad or weigh down the film. In fact, it makes the
viewing even more enjoyable.</TE>
<TE>   There are several new scenes, including a sweet sequence directly
after the prologue in which Bilbo Baggins introduces Hobbiton and the
hobbits and another in which Aragon sings of his lost love. Several
scenes are expanded, including one in which Gandalf and Frodo talk in
the cart before Bilbo's birthday celebration.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson and his co-writers, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, supply
lovely commentary on one track, and 10 of the actors -- including
Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Sean Astin and Christopher Lee -- are
lively and fun on yet another commentary track.</TE>
<TE>   For those interested in the technical aspect, the design team and
the product/post-product team are featured on their own separate
tracks.</TE>
<TE>   The third disc, "From Book to Vision," includes documentaries on
Tolkien; the adapting and planning of the film; the designing and
building of Middle-earth; the use of pre-visualization and
rudimentary animation (called animatics); a behind-the-scenes glimpse
at Jackson's Weta Workshop, where all the weapons, armor, creatures
and miniatures were made; an interactive map of Middle-earth; an
interactive location map of New Zealand; galleries of art and slide
shows with select commentary by the artists; a tour of the expansive
wardrobe department; footage from early meetings; and even a test
reel in which Jackson plays the role Bilbo Baggins.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth disc, "From Vision to Reality," includes an amusing
look at a day in the life of a hobbit; a chronicle of how the size
difference between the hobbits and the elves was accomplished on
screen; behind-the-scenes photographs; sound design demonstration; an
editing demonstration; and footage from the various premieres of the
film.</TE>

<HD>Colon sets salsa fans' feet tapping</HD>
<DH>His Conga Room performance is punctuated by an emotional
connection to late Hector Lavoe.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>You don't dance at a Willie Colon concert. Doing so would be a
sacrilege of sorts.</LD>
<LD>   When Colon is in the house, you stand as close to the stage as
possible, tap your feet ever so lightly to the beat of the clave and
pinch yourself in disbelief: You're watching a salsa legend in
action.</LD>
<LD>   That was the reaction of the capacity crowd Friday at the Conga
Room, where the Bronx-born singer and trombonist, 52, delivered a
brisk, 2 1/2-hour set.</LD>
<TE>   From the late '60s to the early '80s, Colon, Ruben Blades and
Hector Lavoe functioned as salsa's New York-based holy trinity,
creating the genre's essential canon. If Blades was salsa's ultimate
songwriter, and Lavoe the vocal distillation of its raw, tragic
spirit, Colon was the unifier, the alchemist, the enabler.</TE>
<TE>   Working as a solo artist and also as Lavoe and Blades' producer,
he preserved the authentic grit of Afro-Caribbean dance formats while
fusing them with other styles (bossa nova, R&amp;B), embellishing his
elaborate epics with lush strings and perfecting a trombone sound
that reflected his streetwise sensibility: rough, unpolished and
recklessly exuberant.</TE>
<TE>   The golden age of salsa is a distant memory, but Colon's
performance was not an exercise in nostalgia. He performed relatively
recent hits ("Idilio," "Talento de Television") and allowed his young
octet plenty of space for improvisation.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the emotional connection with Lavoe, who died in 1993,
continues to define Colon's every musical moment.</TE>
<TE>   Fittingly, a medley of old favorites -- including the anthemic "El
Cantante," the wistful "Periodico de Ayer" and the fatalistic slice
of religious fervor "El Todopoderoso" -- was the most poignant
moment.</TE>

<HD>Wood's 'Bolero' builds on city noises and lusty pairings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Victoria Looseleaf</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just when you thought you'd had it up to here with Ravel's bouncy war
horse, "Bolero," choreographer Bruce Wood comes along and blows
preconceived notions and calloused cliches out of the water.</LD>
<LD>   By turns sadomasochistic, outrageously haughty and downright sexy,
the Fort Worth-based Bruce Wood Dance Company, in its Los Angeles
debut Friday at El Camino College's Marsee Auditorium, brought new
revelations to the French classic.</LD>
<LD>   Admittedly, Wood tweaked Ravel's score by layering on a sound
collage of city noises, macabre laughs and airport announcements,
heightening the crescendos. As for the dancing? It thrilled, with
long-legged women strutting in satin and lace (costumes by Wood),
swaggering tux-clad men, and full-force erotic partnering.</LD>
<TE>   Posing as seated voyeurs were pearl-bedecked damsels and a pair of
men, splay-legged, tied to chairs. Decidedly decadent, Wood's 2001
retelling is not your mother's "Bolero."</TE>
<TE>   The more classical "Local 126" (2001) saw Wood using Bach piano
and string concertos as 10 dancers gallivanted in robotic unison with
elongated strides.</TE>
<TE>   Characterized by stiff upper torsos, the arms, nevertheless were
constantly moving, evoking servitude a la Charlie Chaplin's "Modern
Times."</TE>
<TE>   Completing the program was the mournful "Red" (2001). Set to a
Philip Glass violin concerto, the stage was awash in Tony Tucci's
ravishing scarlet lighting, as nine crimson-garbed dancers again
gesticulated with their arms, this time struggling against
loneliness.</TE>
<TE>   Wood needn't worry -- he's welcome in this town anytime.</TE>

<LD>It takes a certain amount of moxie to quote an anti-bourgeois German
novelist to a $150-a-plate lunch crowd in the wilds of Beverly Hills.
But the speaker in question is mayor of this town and she had a point
to make -- "In the words of Hermann Hesse, 'Every miracle has a
beginning,' " she said, referring to the Beverly Hills Flower &amp;
Garden Festival.</LD>
<LD>   This particular miracle, which occurred last weekend at the
Greystone Mansion off Loma Vista Drive, had its beginning, it would
seem, in a chance request made by Mayor MeraLee Goldman's daughter.
As Goldman related the story to the crowd, the family was on its way
to Belgium after an African safari, and the girl looked at a map and
said, as children will, "Oh, Holland is so close. Can we go there?"
She was reading about Anne Frank at the time, so off they all went to
Amsterdam, which was, as luck would have it, right in the middle of
its Tulip Festival.</LD>
<LD>   "It was so wonderful," said Goldman, "that all I could think of
is: I want this. I want this at home. I want this in Beverly Hills."</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Beverly Hills was immersed in a decades-long quandary
about what to do with Greystone, the 55-room Tudor-style mansion
built in 1928 by Ned Doheny. It was, at the time of Goldman's
Amsterdam epiphany, essentially vacant save the occasional wedding or
film crew. Purchased by the city in 1965, the grounds had been made
into a public park, but the house and its lovely terraced gardens
were a perpetual source of conflict. Almost any suggestion to turn it
into a self-supporting concern -- a museum, a high-end conference
center -- met with opposition from neighbors and preservationists
concerned about, well, all those people you know and their dreadful
automobiles.</TE>
<TE>   And so Goldman decided to wed two desires -- a flower show and a
fund-raiser -- and a festival was born.</TE>
<TE>   "We're the only place in the country where you can have a flower
festival in November," she said. She was speaking Wednesday at the
"gala preview" of the event. Two hundred or so men in suits and women
in hats sat in the silvery courtyard at tables blooming with pink
roses whose stems nested in submerged cherries. They sipped champagne
and ate sandwiches plucked from beds of wheat grass on the nearby
buffet table.</TE>
<TE>   Many had already wandered through the first floor of the mansion,
which had been transformed into a swanky marketplace. Local vendors
-- including Tiffany -- had been invited to decorate half a dozen
rooms with their wares. A harpist played in the corner of one
entryway and every room was infused with the smell of wealth --
leather and fine old furniture, the sandalwood perfume of embroidered
silks, the fragrant breath of arum lilies, roses, lavender and the
heady citrus of really good aromatherapy candles.</TE>
<TE>   Every surface of every room was covered with lovely things,
precious things, gleaming, glistening, promising things, like a
Christmas bazaar for princes or a rummage sale of kings. Through all
of this a coterie of impossibly tall and slender young women
wandered, various flawless surfaces of their bodies exposed, the rest
clothed in Badgley  Mischka and La Perla. There was a silent auction
in one room, there was cake decorating in the atrium, and in the
kitchen, fruit and vegetable carvers had turned a watermelon into a
bouquet of roses, carrots into feathers, beets into chrysanthemums.</TE>
<TE>   A far cry from the creaking parochial school floors, the
hand-crocheted toilet-paper cozies and smeary red velvet cakes that
might mark a similar fund-raising event in another community. "It's
so good to see the house looking so well," one woman said to another.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm from Camarillo, and I didn't even know this place existed,"
said Jennifer Sleeper, who had brought an assortment of her antiques
and vintage textiles to sell at Greystone. "But I told my girlfriend
I was coming and she's from the Valley and she said she used to come
here all the time to neck. 'It's haunted,' she told me, but she
didn't say by what."</TE>
<TE>   By the man it was built for, many would say. Doheny only lived in
the mansion for four months; in February 1929, he and his secretary,
Hugh Plunkett, were found dead there, victims of a probable
murder-suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Doheny's widow, Lucy, remarried and stayed on for 26 years. She
sold most of the acreage in 1954 to developer Paul Trousdale, and a
year later, the house and remaining land went to Chicago
industrialist Henry Crown, who also owned the Empire State Building.
He never moved in. Ten years later, he was about to tear it down and
subdivide the property when horrified locals organized a "Save
Greystone" campaign. The city bought the property and installed a
19-million-gallon underground water reservoir there.</TE>
<TE>   From 1969 to 1982, Greystone housed the American Film Institute.
But for almost 20 years, it stood empty. There was the occasional
private or corporate function and a summer day camp, but mostly it
was haunted, if not by ghosts then by irony -- in a land of fabulous
homes, in a city known the world over for its wealth, a storybook
castle moldered, doomed by poverty and nervous neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   In this town, any self-respecting building in reduced
circumstances has only one alternative -- Hollywood. And Greystone
served as location for many films, including "Ghostbusters" (I &amp; II),
"The Loved One," "All of Me" and the Bette Davis classic "Hush ...
Hush, Sweet Charlotte." Of course there was also "Dead Ringer,"
"Phantom of Paradise," "The House of the Damned" and "Picture Mommy
Dead" -- but then it's so easy to get typecast, isn't it?</TE>
<TE>   Valley kids were not the only ones who fooled around in its
shadows. Heidi Fleiss, then 19, launched a four-year affair with
57-year-old financier Bernie Cornfeld at Greystone, where Cornfeld
was hosting a fete. From Cornfeld, Fleiss went on to director Ivan
Nagy and from there to, well, infamy.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the city approved a $4-million renovation plan, which
began in November 2001. Meanwhile the house is becoming a cultural
center of sorts. A classical concert series was launched in the
mid-'90s, a Music in the Mansion series began three years ago, and
this year there were high teas and an audience-roaming murder
mystery. All these events, however, were offered on a residents-first
basis; the Flower and Garden Festival was the first time the city's
most splendid manor house and its gardens were open to the
non-Beverly-Hills-residing public. Almost 3,000 people came, braving
Saturday's rain.</TE>
<TE>   The Friends of Greystone hope the festival will add not only to
the maintenance coffers but to public imagination. On Wednesday after
lunch, many guests toured the gardens, which had been redone for the
festival. (There were, inexplicably, no tulips.) Picking their way up
the many stone steps, they looked out over the roofs and terraces of
the house. All of Los Angeles was at their feet, but silently,
shrouded by a silvery late-afternoon haze that moved up the hill,
fluttering in places like something torn loose. Of course there are
ghosts here, because ghosts live wherever people live, wherever
conflict and transcendence live. In a haunted house, at long last
thrown open, Hermann Hesse would have been quite at home.</TE>

<HD>Fate is cruel, and a bit crude</HD>
<DH>The Wooster Group's 'To You, the Birdie!' makes weird,
heavily farcical sport of Greek tragedy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sean Mitchell</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the opening scene of the visiting Wooster Group's "To You, the
Birdie!" at UCLA's Freud Playhouse, two bare-chested guys wearing
only kilts face the audience while binding their feet for what will
be, yes, a badminton match in ancient Greece.</LD>
<LD>   The two actors, Ari Fliakos (as Hippolytos) and Scott Shepherd (as
Theramenes), sit behind a transparent, knee-high video screen that
shows us in speeded-up refraction each man below the waist. As they
continue making their athletic preparations, we can see plainly that
neither is wearing any underwear. The two chat about politics and
love, but their words are trumped by the prurient joke playing out on
the screen.</LD>
<LD>   When Shepherd compounds the joke by dropping a hand between his
legs like a baseball catcher and flashing signs for fastball, curve
and change-up, we know we are watching what might be called an
Ironmax production -- that is, maximum irony all the time.</LD>
<TE>   This latest piece by the famously experimental Wooster Group from
lower Manhattan is loosely based on the 17th century French dramatist
Jean Racine's classical tragedy "Phedre," about the tortured wife of
Theseus who falls for her stepson Hippolytos while Theseus is off on
an adventure. It is so loosely based that it raises the question: Why
choose an existing source except to bash and plunder it for
theatrical sport, which director Elizabeth LeCompte certainly has
done.</TE>
<TE>   The classical notion of tragedy stemming from cruel fate imposed
by arrogant gods is all but invisible in a show whose aims remain
inscrutable other than to demonstrate what whacked-out subversion of
a text can be achieved though scatological humor and high-tech
gimmickry.</TE>
<TE>   Kate Valk, as Phedre, bound in one of the most painful-looking
bodices you will ever see, mostly does not open her mouth but, in
typical Wooster postmodern technique, is spoken for by Shepherd, who
reads her words into a microphone, itself plugged into a reverb with
a jittery delay. (Fun!) Sound effects, in fact, dominate "To You, the
Birdie!," with errant badminton shuttlecocks (or birds) falling with
the same sounds of broken glass that accompany David Letterman's
airborne note cards on late-night TV.</TE>
<TE>   Routine actor movements are underscored with odd brushing and
scraping sounds, and when the estimable Willem Dafoe, as Theseus,
returns home to the palace at Troezen and hears that his son has
raped his wife (not true), his angry footsteps land with thunderous
crashes.</TE>
<TE>   Not to be overlooked are the watery sounds of waste elimination
that accompany Phedre's numerous painful trips to an ancient Greek
port-a-potty, assisted by a small retinue of servants evidently
well-schooled in her bowel problems. What this has to do with her
suicidal reaction to Hippolytos' rejection of her advances is not
clear, but it must be said that watching an enema tube trailing from
under Phedre's skirt as she scuttled grimly across the stage pushed
the absolute insanity of the production beyond the recklessly wild
into the truly weird.</TE>
<TE>   Such antics can provoke laughter, but it's laughter at the thought
you've ended up at such a place to spend an evening watching such a
thing. The style, built on aggressive anachronism and ersatz ballet
movements, is solemn farce that seeks, rather than a direct line of
communication with the audience, a deconstruction of a Greek legend
that replaces story with theory, human behavior with cool attitude.
The quality of the actors themselves is hard to assess. Dafoe,
looking like he just got down off the cross in "The Last Temptation
of Christ," is all rib cage and gaunt muscle as he puts his voice and
talent aside to portray Theseus as a sculptural form, more than a
man.</TE>
<TE>   The most striking accomplishment of the piece is the badminton
match near the beginning in which Fliakos and Shepherd smash the
feathered shuttlecock back and forth with the impressive agility of
circuit pros while an imperious female court judge (Fiona Leaning)
intones rulings fit for center court at Wimbledon. Too bad it doesn't
mean anything except that these guys are good at something.</TE>

<HD>Fresh noise from '80s-era Savage Republic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Natalie Nichols</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Savage Republic's '80s-vintage Southern California logo, a palm tree
with crescent moon and star, still best conveys its mashed cornucopia
of global beats, industrial noise, lilting melodies and variously
disturbing and soothing vocals. These post-punk experimenters --
reunited after 13 years for a five-city tour supporting their new
boxed-set retrospective -- pounded on 55-gallon drums, oil cans,
pipes and the like long before Blue Man Group.</LD>
<LD>   "The edges of the mainstream have moved a little bit closer to
us," says guitarist-percussionist Ethan Port, whose San
Francisco-based Mobilization Records released the four-disc
collection. Charting Savage Republic's shift from noisy art-punk to
more instrumental, epic sprawl, it includes the albums "Tragic
Figures," "Ceremonial," "Jamahiriya Democratique ... " and "Customs."
"A lot of the music is actually pretty accessible," Port says. "Punk
is now mainstream, and the audience for electronic/trance/ambient and
world music sounds is huge as well."</LD>
<LD>   Founded at UCLA in 1980 by guitarist Bruce Licher and drummer Mark
Erskine, Savage Republic has had numerous incarnations linked only by
Licher. He's best known as the owner of Independent Project Press,
whose distinctive letter-pressed packaging is seen on releases by
Camper Van Beethoven, R.E.M. and, of course, Savage Republic.</LD>
<TE>   Licher and original keyboardist Robert Loveless will be joined at
the Knitting Factory Hollywood on Wednesday by later Savages Port,
Thom Fuhrmann and Greg Grunke, along with drummer Joel Connell.</TE>
<TE>   The bill also includes class-of-the-'80s local artists Mike Watt
and the Secondmen, the Urinals, and the Human Hands, but don't expect
a nostalgia trip.</TE>
<TE>   "We aren't the same people we were 13 years ago, and we're
continuing from a fresh perspective," Port says.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Venice's legendary La Fenice opera house, which burned down in 1996,
will rise from the ashes at the end of 2003 after repeated rebuilding
delays, the city's mayor said Monday. The curtain will rise at La
Fenice -- Phoenix in English -- on Dec. 14, 2003, with a program of
concerts and a ballet, Paolo Costa said. The first opera, to be
performed in autumn 2004, will be Giuseppe Verdi's "La Traviata."</LD>
<LD>   Many critics remain skeptical about the timetable, given the
numerous snags that have slowed restoration. It was initially
scheduled to reopen in 1999. But after repeated delays, city
officials canceled the restoration plan drawn up by a German company
and handed the project to Italian firms.</LD>

<LD>Last weekend was the last airing for CNN's Saturday night
public-affairs mainstay, "Novak, Hunt &amp; Shields," an interview
program that has been on the network for 20 years, originally with
Rowland Evans and Robert Novak as hosts.</LD>
<LD>   The cancellation came as part of CNN's plan to overhaul the
weekend lineup, cutting back on replays of shows and beefing up its
general news coverage. Among other changes to come: The weeknight
"NewsNight With Aaron Brown" will add weekend editions, hosted by
Anderson Cooper. The network also is exploring a weekend version of
"American Morning."</LD>
<LD>   As for Novak, he will continue to co-host CNN's "Crossfire"; Al
Hunt and Mark Shields will continue to be seen on CNN's "Capital
Gang" and "Inside Politics." Evans died last year.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Greek culture minister was in London Monday to ask officials from
the British Museum to return the Elgin Marbles that once adorned the
Parthenon, BBC News reported.</LD>
<LD>   The ancient friezes, depicting formal religious ceremonies, were
given to the British Museum in 1816; Greece has been trying to get
them back for years. It is so intent, in fact, that construction has
begun on a new museum to house them on the Acropolis hill in time for
the 2004 Athens Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   Greek minister Evangelos Venizelos was expected to propose that
the British Museum let the sculptures go on permanent loan to the
Athens facility in exchange for the loan of other Greek antiquities.
But a spokesman for the museum told BBC News Online that the Elgin
Marbles are considered part of its core collection and the notion
that they could leave is "total nonsense."</LD>

<DH>Ruffles, pleats, embroidery: The tuxedo shirt, sans tuxedo,
is tweaking a lot of old ideas about what men should be wearing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Quintanilla</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Javier Andrade is holding an armful of shirts that are, for lack of a
better word, pretty.  There are two with ruffles, one bibbed with
baby blue pleats, another in denim with rows of fuzzy and frayed
pin-tucking and a swashbuckle creation with layers and layers of
frilly fabric.</LD>
<LD>   Shirts along the line you've seen on prom night, or at the opera
-- or on your sister. But Andrade, a 30-year-old law firm accountant,
is not shopping for her or for any tuxedo-expected event. He's buying
them to wear with jeans.</LD>
<LD>   The relaxed tuxedo shirt is tweaking a lot of old ideas about what
a guy should be caught wearing. It's a way to make the informal a bit
formal, add some frills to a men's garment that's expected to be
no-frills. The shirt is typically worn open at the neck, unstarched
(almost as if it was just pulled out of the dryer) and not tucked in.
What the shirt isn't really meant to be worn with is a tux--unless
it's low-rise, boot-cut and looks like it's been tortured to death.</LD>
<TE>   "Right now, there are more tuxedo shirts available than I've ever
seen before, and they're coming from designers and manufacturers that
aren't specialists in tuxedo shirts," says David Wolfe of Doneger
Group, a New York-based firm that analyzes fashion trends. "That's a
clue to a wider-spread trend for men that really comes from the urge
to dress up and not be sloppy but also not be formal."</TE>
<TE>   And did we say sexy?</TE>
<TE>   "It's sexy dressing, for sure, and fun because the look is very
rock 'n' roll, like L.A.," says Sara Dovan, the owner of Traffic, a
men's haberdashery at the Beverly Center that has been doing brisk
business with tux shirts by Comme des Garcons, New York Industrie,
Romeo Gigli and Fujiwara. "The best thing is that you don't need an
excuse like a black-tie invitation to wear one. Just add blue jeans
and a guitar."</TE>
<TE>   No guitars, but big-shot designers Ralph Lauren and Karl Lagerfeld
were wearing tux shirts and jeans at their recent New York and Paris
runway shows; John Varvatos sported a lavender ruffled shirt, faded
jeans and smoking jacket at a benefit this month at his Melrose
Avenue shop.</TE>
<TE>   "The business of fashion is always looking for new ways to take
something that has been around and reinvent it," says Marshal Cohen,
co- president of NPDFashionworld, a New York-based market information
company. The tuxedo shirt is being shown in spring lines for 2003 and
may have staying power well beyond that. Prices range from about $60
to more than $300.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of smooth fabric shirts (including plain white ones and the
re-imagined tux) are increasing; some manufacturers say those orders
are up as much as 60%. Falling out of favor -- don't tell Bob Villa
or your dad -- are polo shirts, plaid shirts (unless they're
Burberry) and sweaters.</TE>
<TE>   NYBased President Dennis Dassow says his company will send out
more tux-tweaked shirts next spring "because I don't see the trend
slowing, and guys need new shirt ideas. What makes this shirt even
more attractive to guys is that they don't have to dry-clean most of
them."</TE>
<TE>   While the tux redux and its frills may be a not-me-no-way for
some, for others it's the shirt to have. "For me, it's all about
extremes," says Tony Ross, 35, an L.A. nightclub owner. "I'll wear a
tank top or a tux shirt, nothing in between."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen, the market watcher, says the current crop of tux shirts is
a reaction to what's out there already.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be that guys would come home and change out of their
suits into their polo shirts," he says. But, now, with casual dress
the norm in many workplaces, guys are more apt to dress up after they
get home from work. "A shirt without a tie and you're set to go out
to dinner. With the tuxedo shirt, you can look like the
non-establishment and show your individualism, be a bit avant-garde
but not look sloppy or grungy, which is what casual Fridays had
become."</TE>
<TE>   Designer and shop owner Timoteo O'Campo says the more
deconstructed the tux shirt, the better it looks. For instance,
instead of traditional pleats, you might get vertical shredding. He's
already sold out twice -- and reordered -- a variety of tux shirts
for his West Hollywood boutique. He calls one the coffin shirt
because of its Dracula-like exaggerated Victorian collar and gathers
on the front and sides; others feature pleats sewn with pink thread;
one with frayed-edged pleats has been popular</TE>
<TE>   New York-based designers Robert Stock and Graham Flower, a design
duo known as Robert Graham, are doing their part to fuel the trend
with seven whimsical looks -- at $175 a pop -- which they put
together for Neiman Marcus. They include a wing-tipped tuxedo shirt
with stars embroidered on it, a shirt bibbed in black and white
ruffles and one with a patchwork of stripes in all directions.</TE>
<TE>   Flower says the shirts appeal to men "looking for a cool way to
dress up ... and appeal to women. Women think tuxedo shirts are very
sexy."</TE>
<TE>   And the men who buy them for the women who love them do too.
Andrade, the accountant trying on shirts at a Bloomingdale's, uses
these words to describe the one he ends up buying: laid-back,
dashing, romantic. And if his sister wants to borrow it, well OK.</TE>

<DH>The story so far: The dining room of the Big Griddle
restaurant looks just the same, but Albert's parents are gone, and in

<LD>The space aliens were humanoid, though they didn't have noses, and
their earlobes hung to the shoulders of their scarlet uniforms. The
one in the lead rushed across the room to Albert and held up his
palm. "I am Schmul, commander of the Big Griddle Forbians," the alien
said in pretty fair English. "Welcome to Forbush."</LD>
<LD>   "Where are my parents?" Albert asked, trying not to cry.</LD>
<LD>   "They are still waiting for you at the Big Griddle on Earth,"
Schmul said.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not on Earth?" Albert asked, curious despite his worry.</TE>
<TE>   "There are Big Griddles throughout the galaxy," Schmul explained,
"each one looking the same as all the others. That's why it is so
easy to use the postcards to travel from one restaurant to the
other."</TE>
<TE>   "Postcards?" Albert held up the postcard he'd taken from the rack
outside the restroom. He saw now that it wasn't just cardboard. It
had two layers of paper with a layer of metal foil in between.</TE>
<TE>   "Indeed," Schmul said. "Travel by postcard is very popular. Come
sit down, my boy."</TE>
<TE>   "You speak English," Albert said as he sat down.</TE>
<TE>   "Would you rather we spoke some other language?" Schmul asked.</TE>
<TE>   "No," Albert admitted. "You seemed to be expecting me."</TE>
<TE>   "We were," Schmul said. "The Kreekem will attack soon. You are
carrying something we hope will protect us from them."</TE>
<TE>   "It would help if I knew what you were looking for."</TE>
<TE>   "I would tell you if I could. All we know is that a courier is
coming through from Earth, and he will be carrying something we
need."</TE>
<TE>   "Who told you that?"</TE>

<HD>New blood takes on old music</HD>
<DH>Conductor Giovanni Antonini opens Baroque LA series in a
rousing fashion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Swed</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city of the future doesn't do anachronism. Or so we like to
believe. Every new shopping mall, every new movie is hailed as the
next thing. But lightly scratch the surface, and the stores turn out
to be the same chains as everywhere else, while Hollywood could be
said to be the world's most avid recycler. And now, Los Angeles hopes
to finally join London, Amsterdam, Munich, Vienna, Milan -- and
Berkeley and Boston -- as home to a world-class early music ensemble.</LD>
<LD>   Over the weekend Musica Angelica began its ambitious new Baroque
LA series at the Zipper Concert Hall and Schoenberg Hall; Giovanni
Antonini was its guest conductor for a program of Vivaldi and Bach.
And to judge by a nearly full house Sunday afternoon at Schoenberg,
early music is in.</LD>
<LD>   Ironies abound. In the UCLA music library across from the
auditorium are the archives of the now forgotten Early Music
Laboratory begun in 1948 by a former Los Angeles Philharmonic
violinist Sol Babitz.</LD>
<TE>   A remarkable, if curmudgeonly early music pioneer, he made L.A. in
the early '50s a lively place to discover the lost world of the
Baroque, which then seemed as novel as new music. Stravinsky paid
close attention. Aldous Huxley was an admirer.</TE>
<TE>   But Angelenos move on, and when early music exploration took off
more widely in the '60s and '70s, it took off elsewhere. With
Antonini conducting Musica Angelica, some of that elsewhere energy
began to return to the source Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Antonini's own Italian early music orchestra, Il Giardino
Armonico, is on the cutting edge of the latest continental Baroque
style, which merges exciting virtuosity with garishly colorful
playing. These young, stylish, nervy, infectious Milanese players can
be as electrifying as free-wheeling jazz musicians.</TE>
<TE>   Music Angelica, under its artistic director, Michael Eagan, is a
more modest ensemble, and at Sunday's concert, Antonini worked hard
at jolting the players out of their usual staid decorum.</TE>
<TE>   Antonini's style is active, impetuous; they stand stiff, upright.
He wears a fashionable suit; they stick to formal dress even on a
Sunday afternoon. He seems to ooze freedom of expression from every
pore; their attention is more closely focused on the score.</TE>
<TE>   A flashy recorder soloist, Antonini made the evening's highlights
-- two Vivaldi concertos, "La Tempesta di Mare" for alto recorder and
the Concerto in C major for sopranino recorder  -- the prime example
of what he was after.</TE>
<TE>   He loves effects, and Vivaldi gives him plenty of material to work
with. In the slow movement of the C-major concerto, for instance, his
embellishments were so elaborate, his exaggerations of dissonances so
brazen, that it began to sound like his inspiration was less musty
old documents in a Venice library than Coltrane playing
"Greensleeves."</TE>
<TE>   Musica Angelica will have a way to go before it can demonstrate
the same cheeky confidence. Elizabeth Blumenstock, the concertmaster
and a well-traveled Baroque violinist, was an impressive, purposeful
soloist in Bach's A-minor Violin Concerto. But she seemed out of her
more conventional element as Antonini juiced up the bass line in the
slow movement and drove the last movement like a Ferrari on the
autostrada.</TE>
<TE>   Oboist Gonzalo Ruiz was the soloist in Bach's Orchestral Suite No.
2 in A minor. It is the same suite as the popular one with solo flute
in B minor, but Ruiz has examined the manuscripts and believes that
Bach originally wrote it for oboe and in the lower key. He may be
right, but I think he will have a hard time wresting it away from
flutists. Despite Antonini's crisp conducting and Ruiz's enthusiastic
playing, the score begged for a brighter sound.</TE>
<TE>   At the beginning and end were works featuring two trumpets --
Jean-Joseph Mouret's Premiere Suite des Fanfares (its first movement
is the "Masterpiece Theater" theme) and Vivaldi's Concerto in C
major.</TE>
<TE>   In the Vivaldi, the players, John Thiessen and Gilbert Cline,
stood before the orchestra, deadpan as a pair of Secret Service men.
But our ears told us that their tongues were hyperactive. The solo
lines are florid, Baroque trumpets have no valves and Antonini had no
intention of slowing down. The near-flawless trills sounded like
magic.</TE>
<TE>   Now if only Musica Angelica could develop more of a personality,
could demonstrate some flare -- this is Los Angeles after all -- that
would be real magic.</TE>

<HD>O.J. Simpson saga as a history of race relations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He was a symbol of racial unity who became a flashpoint of division.</LD>
<LD>   O.J. Simpson moved with agility on and off the football field as a
star running back, broadcaster and corporate pitchman. At the peak of
his popularity, when he dashed through airports in 1970s Hertz
commercials to the cheers of white onlookers, Simpson was seen as
living proof that America could get past its race obsession.</LD>
<LD>   The all-American image was shattered, of course, with his arrest
for the 1994 slayings of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and
her friend, Ron Goldman.</LD>
<TE>   As one commentator put it, when the nation watched that slow
freeway pursuit of Simpson while he held a gun to his own head, "All
of a sudden, for mainstream white society, O.J. was a lot darker."</TE>
<TE>   Seven years after his controversial acquittal, HBO uses the
Simpson saga as a penetrating lens on race relations in America since
the turbulent late 1960s in "O.J.: A Study in Black and White,"
presented tonight at 10.</TE>
<TE>   Through interviews with athletes, educators and activists, this
program from executive producers Ross Greenburg and Rick Bernstein
offers heartfelt insights on Simpson's rise and fall, shedding light
on why the events of 1994-95 polarized the country along racial
lines.</TE>
<TE>   Though time lends perspective, feelings remain raw. Many whites
still see a horrifying injustice where many blacks still see an
overdue slap in the face to a society built on racism.</TE>
<TE>   If Simpson's career represented a harmony that might have been,
the murder trial and the divergent reactions only prove that, so far
at least, the dream is sheer fantasy.</TE>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While the rain may have kept many Angelenos away from the second
annual Sola Contemporary Dance Festival held over the weekend at
James Armstrong Theatre in Torrance, spirits were far from dampened.
As Regina Klenjoski, artistic director of Regina Klenjoski Dance
Company and producer of the event, noted, the purpose of presenting
10 emerging contemporary choreographers was to break boundaries and
shape the future of dance in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The pluck and determination factor was high; the results, however,
were not always successful.</LD>
<LD>   But there was plenty to admire, especially in two of the evening's
solo outings: A luminous Moonea Choi soared in her "Claudia Gate,"
with fluttering hands and huge leaps hallmarking this elegant,
structured improvisation. Striking an altogether different chord,
Albertossy Espinoza, dancing as a mad zaftig gypsy woman in his
premiere, "Gender," spoofed with dervish twirling, nearly impossibly
high kicks and emotive floor-crawling, finally flinging off falsies
and wig to wacky effect.</LD>
<TE>   Dorcas Roman, an exciting purveyor of contact improvisation, led
eight dancers in "Subtle Fragmentations," highlighted by body
balancing and intense partnering. Also creating heat: Underdog Dance
Project's Cat Manturuk and Heather Vaughan's playful "Melt" and
Sarandon Cassidy and Hanh Nguyen in the latter's "Gotcha" (2002).
Infused with razor-sharp martial arts moves and performed to live
percussion and ferociously reverberated guitar, the daring work
throbbed with unpredictability.</TE>
<TE>   Less winning: Lucid Dance's Jay Bartley and Tyffyne Stuart, both
beefy and wearing upper body harnesses in their 2001 work,
"Tethered." After the novelty of the elastic prop wore off, the duo
had little to say. Philein Wang's "Remember Me" (2002) proved a
hodgepodge of melodrama, with background slides a further ploy for
pathos. Don McLeod's premiere, "Redemption," proved that slow,
spastic moves do not necessarily good Butoh make, as he preened in
sequined kimono and face mask, before self-consciously contorting
himself sans accouterments.</TE>

<HD>Galbraith's lucid guitar hits home</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josef Woodard</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Guitarist Paul Galbraith hasn't been a stranger to these parts
lately. He gave a recital at USC's Newman Recital Hall in September,
and the repertory in his program on the Chamber Music in Historic
Sites series Sunday mirrored that earlier performance.</LD>
<LD>   But what a different context makes. To appreciate Galbraith's
particular charms and depths at close range, in the living room in a
historic house in Los Feliz, was a heaven-made match of musician and
the senses-opening Sites concept.</LD>
<LD>   This Mediterranean-style house was designed in 1915 by Withey &amp;
Davis for department store mogul Arthur Letts, founder of the
Broadway and Bullock's.</LD>
<TE>   It has been lavishly outfitted with an eclectic array of antiques
and exotica by longtime owner, actress and author Ronnie Claire
Edwards.</TE>
<TE>   Performing music of British composer Lennox Berkeley, Enrique
Granados, Bach and Debussy, Galbraith brought a unique clarity and
controlled passion, all the more evident in this intimate setting.
His custom eight-string guitar -- held cello-like and with an ornate
sound box to broaden its sound -- makes him a rebel with a good
cause, expanding the guitar's range and resonance.</TE>
<TE>   Bach has been a Galbraith specialty, and the French Suite had a
soaring dignity. But the guitarist is also expanding his repertory,
and his current work-in-progress focuses on newly transcribed
Impressionist music.</TE>
<TE>   As he commented Sunday, "Composers who stress suggestion fit most
comfortably on the instrument." He proved his point with his
fascinating new take on Debussy's "Children's Corner," making the
piano piece sing on guitar, as if it belonged there, all dreamily
rippling textures and lucid, tender spirit.</TE>

<HD>Adelphia in Talks to Hire Management Team</HD>
<DH>The troubled cable TV operator reportedly has offered its
CEO and COO positions to a pair of top executives at AT&amp;T Broadband.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sallie Hofmeister</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After months of searching for a cable veteran to help it emerge from
bankruptcy, troubled Adelphia Communications Corp. is in serious
negotiations to hire away the top management team from AT&amp;T
Broadband, the nation's leading cable provider.</LD>
<LD>   Adelphia, the largest cable television operator in Southern
California, has offered the job of chief executive to William
Schleyer, who currently holds that title at AT&amp;T Broadband, and has
asked his No. 2, Ron Cooper, to become chief operating officer,
according to people close to the negotiations.</LD>
<LD>   Schleyer would replace Erland Kailbourne, who has been interim CEO
of Adelphia since May, when founder John Rigas and his three sons
relinquished control of the company amid an accounting scandal.</LD>
<TE>   Rigas, two of his sons and two other executives were indicted this
summer on criminal charges of bank and securities fraud for allegedly
looting Coudersport, Pa.-based Adelphia of about $3 billion. Adelphia
was forced into bankruptcy, and under Kailbourne's leadership it has
been searching for a top cable executive to turn the company around
as well as restructure its $20 billion in debt.</TE>
<TE>   Neither AT&amp;T nor Adelphia would comment on the negotiations. But
people close to Schleyer and Cooper say they have been telling some
members of their staff in recent weeks that they could all end up
working for Adelphia after AT&amp;T Broadband is sold to rival Comcast
Corp. That transaction is expected to win regulatory approval this
week.</TE>
<TE>   Schleyer, Cooper and several other top managers are among the
1,700 employees at AT&amp;T Broadband headquarters in Denver who will
lose their jobs after the merger.</TE>
<TE>   Schleyer and Cooper were hired by AT&amp;T Broadband only a year ago
to revive the troubled cable company and provide additional leverage
to help fend off a hostile takeover by Comcast. AT&amp;T Broadband still
is losing subscribers and suffers from low operating profit margins.</TE>
<TE>   But the team did restore Wall Street confidence in the cable
company, giving AT&amp;T Broadband more leverage in negotiations with
Comcast that ultimately produced sweeter terms.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia shares many of the same operating challenges as AT&amp;T.
Adelphia risks losing customers to satellite TV rivals because it has
been slow to upgrade its networks with advanced digital technologies
that result in clearer pictures, services like video on demand and
more choices of channels.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia has had trouble recruiting top industry executives
because its home base is in a remote rural outpost several hours
south of Buffalo, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   In early discussions with Adelphia, Schleyer proposed moving the
company's headquarters to Denver, according to several people close
to AT&amp;T. But Adelphia sources say the proposal is off the table.</TE>
<TE>   Schleyer and Cooper have a long history together. Both executives
worked in top management at Boston-based Continental Cablevision and
then at Media One Group Inc. after it bought Continental. Schleyer
and Cooper both left Media One after the company was purchased by
AT&amp;T Broadband. They returned to AT&amp;T Broadband as a team.</TE>
<TE>   The two executives could sign contracts with Adelphia within a
week or two, according to sources close to the situation.</TE>

<HD>Verdict May Hinge on Agent's Game Plan</HD>
<DH>Focus at trial is on Brian Murphy's actions surrounding
rebellion at Steinberg &amp; Moorad</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ralph Frammolino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He was the most persistent job seeker the firm had ever seen. He
telephoned continually, had friends and family send unsolicited
letters of praise and underscored his determination by writing a mock
Sports Illustrated story -- his smiling face on the cover --
predicting his success.</LD>
<LD>   More than anything, Brian G. Murphy wanted to be a sports agent.
And thanks to his persistence, he landed the job of his dreams three
years ago at Steinberg &amp; Moorad Sports Management, one of the
premiere sports agencies in the country.</LD>
<LD>   Now the 32-year-old Murphy is the firm's anti-hero, a central
figure in its nasty $40-million civil court case against upstart
rival Athletes First, of which Murphy is chief operating officer. By
his own hand, Murphy not only tarnished his onetime mentor,
super-agent Leigh Steinberg, but he may have unwittingly undermined
his own company.</LD>
<TE>   An eight-person federal court jury is expected to begin
deliberations today on accusations that Athletes First and its chief
executive, David Dunn, a former Steinberg partner, used proprietary
information to steal more than 50 football player clients from
Steinberg's firm. The suit also contends that Murphy and Dunn tried
to keep Steinberg from fighting back with threats of blackmail.
(Murphy himself is not a defendant in the case, though he is in
arbitration with Steinberg's firm in a separate proceeding.) Dunn has
countersued.</TE>
<TE>   Although the six-week trial has been marked by testimony from such
football stars as Super Bowl quarterback Drew Bledsoe, the jury's
decision may hinge on Murphy's actions surrounding the February 2001
office coup that tore Steinberg's firm apart and led to the breakaway
agency.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence shows that Murphy was an architect and recording
secretary of the rebellion.</TE>
<TE>   One key memo, labeled "attorney-client privileged information,"
calls Steinberg an alcoholic, a professional fraud and a man with
lots of embarrassing secrets "that could prove to be useful in
negotiating a settlement."</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is this whole 'mutiny' could destroy his career,"
Murphy wrote. "If we wanted to, we could rip apart his marriage, his
reputation and his career." The mere prospect of such exposure,
Murphy said, would "drive Leigh insane."</TE>
<TE>   He appended an outline of necessary steps to leave the firm that
included salary information for players, copies of client files and
"incriminating evidence against Leigh" and his business. Yet another
memo, called "Game Plan," counted down the tasks that needed to be
completed in the week before the mass defections over the Presidents
Day weekend.</TE>
<TE>   What Murphy did not anticipate was that his writings would become
public. Murphy composed them on his laptop computer while working at
the Steinberg firm. After Murphy left, his old boss hired a computer
forensics expert, who recovered the memos and numerous e-mails from
the hard drive. The presiding judge ruled they were fair game because
Murphy wrote them on company property and thus had no reasonable
expectation they should be private.</TE>
<TE>   Steinberg's lawyers say the documents are the Rosetta stone of
their case and reveal Murphy's overweening ambition.</TE>
<TE>   "In a way, for Murphy to become the super-agent, he had to destroy
the super-agent," said Franklin Brockway "Brock" Gowdy, lead attorney
for Steinberg's firm, who Friday referred to the documents repeatedly
in closing arguments.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys, meanwhile, have labored to portray the
documents as the work of a justifiably disgruntled employee who was
abused by his boss and ultimately failed to execute many of the finer
points of his writings. In an interview, Murphy said he intended to
show the most controversial memo -- the one that mentioned driving
Steinberg "insane" -- only to his attorney. He added that he regrets
the disclosure has hurt Steinberg's standing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm about as loyal as you get," Murphy said. "I was loyal to
Leigh, through thick and thin. Until it got to be too much."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy was far from the most polished job applicant knocking on
the door of Steinberg's Newport Beach firm in the late 1990s. But he
was, by all accounts, the most determined.</TE>
<TE>   A frustrated jock since childhood, Murphy said he nursed the dream
of being a sports agent while moving through the University of Notre
Dame and Harvard Law School. He wouldn't let go even after taking a
job as an aspiring Boston labor litigator.</TE>
<TE>   So he jumped at the chance when a law school chum called in 1998
to report that Steinberg had posted an ad at Harvard looking for "the
next Jerry Maguire," a reference to the hit movie loosely based on
Steinberg's life. Murphy launched a months-long siege that included
paying his own way to Steinberg's 1999 Super Bowl party in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "He set the all-time record in terms of the amount of times that
he called us and wrote us," Steinberg testified during the trial. "He
sort of wore us down."</TE>
<TE>   What put him over the top was the mock Sports Illustrated. Part
spoof, part confessional, the article depicted Murphy as a future
super-agent with an office overlooking the Pacific and a heart filled
with gratitude for the firm that gave "me my first opportunity and
taught me everything along the way."</TE>
<TE>   But within months after starting in May 1999, disillusionment set
in. He testified he took an $80,000 cut in pay and moved his pregnant
wife 3,000 miles from her family, only to find a "dysfunctional"
office where bosses screamed and their over-educated underlings
fetched laundry or chauffeured athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy plowed ahead. Within a year he was coordinating the
recruitment of rookie football players and serving as Steinberg's
assistant on special projects. Between meetings and errands, the job
was a blur of golf tournaments, dinners, bar-hopping, strip clubs and
hangovers in a quest to cozy up to young athletes, or "kids,"
according to Murphy's sketchy diary, which was admitted into
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   As time passed, his hopes began to dissolve into frustration. He
said Steinberg was more interested in promoting himself than
recognizing the contributions and talents of others.</TE>
<TE>   The teacher and the student began to clash. Murphy reworked
recruitment materials, downplaying Steinberg's role, a change that
angered him. Steinberg challenged Murphy's recruiting expenses.</TE>
<TE>   The final falling-out came last January when the firm failed to
sign first-round draft pick David Terrell of the University of
Michigan. Murphy had been coordinating the ill-fated effort. Murphy
said Steinberg threw his keys at him, kicked a television and stormed
out of his office; Steinberg admitted in testimony that he was angry.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony has established that after the resignations Murphy did
call an official for Assante Corp., the Canadian-based parent of the
Steinberg firm, and discussed the prospect of damaging personal
information about Steinberg coming out. The Assante official
testified it was blackmail. Murphy said he was merely pointing out
the bad press that would befall everyone if a lawsuit were filed.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the truth, Murphy's comments seem prophetic. Murphy has
undergone 63 hours of depositions and testified in court for two
days. In his diary, he refers to associates as "idiots" and reveals
his own drinking problem.</TE>
<TE>   The proceedings themselves have further frustrated his goal for
joining Steinberg's firm in the first place: to become a sports agent
who can negotiate contracts for football players. Murphy said he was
scheduled to attend an NFL Players Assn. seminar this summer and take
the test to become a certified contract advisor.</TE>
<TE>   But the union heard about his involvement in the litigation and
raised questions. Murphy withdrew his application.</TE>
<TE>   "No one," he said, "has escaped from this process unharmed."</TE>

<HD>HP President to Quit Amid Speculation</HD>
<DH>Companies won't comment on rumors he may be headed for the
top job at WorldCom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. Huffstutter and Glenda McCarthy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. President Michael Capellas said Monday that he
will resign his post, walking away from the newly merged computer
maker with nearly $14 million in bonuses and heading into speculation
that he may land the top job at troubled telecommunications giant
WorldCom Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Capellas, the 48-year-old former chief executive of Compaq
Computer Corp. who helped engineer its merger with Palo Alto-based
HP, won't be replaced when he steps down Dec. 1, according to company
officials.</LD>
<LD>   Both Capellas and HP Chief Executive Carly Fiorina said Monday
that the split was amicable. It came as little surprise because
Capellas' compensation contract was amended earlier this year to
allow him to receive his bonuses in a lump sum if he left within a
year of the merger between the two rival PC makers.</LD>
<TE>   Capellas has reported to Fiorina since HP, the country's largest
maker of personal computers and printers, bought Compaq in May after
a lengthy and fierce battle with HP shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Fiorina said Capellas' departure comes as HP is meeting its
targets for integrating the two companies, including a vow to cut
15,000 jobs this year.</TE>
<TE>   Yet many Wall Street analysts were skeptical of such a seemingly
friendly parting of the ways. Capellas' departure could mean that he
had given up on hopes of ever leading the computer giant, said Kevin
Hunt, a research analyst with Thomas Weisel Partners in San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, people are taking a negative knee-jerk reaction because
so many people don't have confidence in Carly Fiorina and thought he
would have taken over eventually," said Hunt, who does not own stock
in Hewlett-Packard.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's news sent HP's shares plummeting 11%, down $1.83 a share
to close at $14.85 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Capellas said his departure is not a reflection of the company's
future prospects.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm comfortable making this move because of the progress of the
integration, HP's market momentum and the strength of the management
team," Capellas said. "I have tremendous respect for Carly and her
leadership."</TE>
<TE>   Industry watchers had predicted that Capellas' time at HP was
limited. After all, Capellas never bought a house in Silicon Valley.
Instead, he chose to rent a place near Palo Alto and maintained his
home near Compaq's former base in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Beulieu, an analyst with Morningstar Inc. in Chicago, said
Capellas' departure will have little long-term effect on the computer
giant.</TE>
<TE>   Beulieu, who does not own stock in the company, pointed out that
it's rare for chief executives of two large companies to both stay on
long after a merger.</TE>
<TE>   Considering that Fiorina went into the merger as head of the
dominant company in the deal, Capellas was the likely candidate to
go, despite the companies' efforts to paint the merger as a marriage
of equals.</TE>
<TE>   If Capellas had even tried to wrestle control of HP away from
Fiorina, such a power struggle would have been incredibly destructive
amid the current technology industry slump, industry observers said.</TE>
<TE>   Capellas is used to adversity. Blind in one eye since childhood,
he was told he was too scrawny to be a linebacker for his high school
football team in Warren, Ohio. He responded by training until he
became not only the team's linebacker but also its co-captain.</TE>
<TE>   Known for his technology expertise and love of a challenge,
Capellas held 22 jobs at six companies before landing at Compaq in
1998 as its chief information officer.</TE>
<TE>   Compaq promoted the fast-rising Capellas to chief executive and
president in July 1999, three months after Eckard Pfeiffer was ousted
because of the company's financial woes.</TE>
<TE>   Once the merger with HP was complete, Capellas took over the job
of overseeing the combined firm's day-to-day operations.</TE>
<TE>   One of his tasks was to reassure employees who were uncertain
about the merger and the resulting 17,000 job cuts, which will reduce
the combined work force to about 133,000.</TE>
<TE>   HP bought rival Compaq for $18.9 billion in the largest technology
merger ever to boost efficiencies in an increasingly competitive
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Since the deal closed, technology spending has worsened more than
expected, especially corporate spending for information technology.</TE>
<TE>   The struggling PC maker is trying to fight back and promised to
accelerate cost-cutting efforts this past summer when it reported
declining revenue in most product lines.</TE>
<TE>   HP officials declined to comment on the speculation of Capellas
heading to WorldCom, which was first reported by the Wall Street
Journal.</TE>
<TE>   Sources at HP, though, say Capellas probably will leave the firm
before December if he lands a new job.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom spokeswoman Julie Moore said the company would not
comment on reports that Capellas is at least on the short list to
become chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Capellas, WorldCom also has approached XO
Communications Inc. Chairman and Chief Executive Dan Akerson and
BellSouth Corp. Vice Chairman Gary Forsee about replacing its
beleaguered CEO, John W. Sidgmore.</TE>

<HD>HBO Bids for Emmy Telecast</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Emmy Awards may not be broadcast on network television for the
first time in its 54-year history because cable channel Home Box
Office has made a lucrative bid to televise the ceremony.</LD>
<LD>   Officials at the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences said Monday
that a cable network, which industry sources identified as HBO,
tentatively has agreed to pay the nonprofit group $50 million over
five years to exclusively carry the TV industry's most prestigious
awards show, beginning next year.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement left network TV executives flabbergasted. The
Emmy telecasts have rotated among ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox under an
agreement that paid the academy $3 million annually. At $10 million a
year, HBO would roughly triple the license fee over the 10% raise the
networks had discussed.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the networks were reluctant to comment, but a CBS
spokesman said that if the proposed deal is consummated, the network
"will no longer participate in the Emmys in any way, shape or form
and withdraw all support" from the academy.</TE>
<TE>   Although HBO is available only in about a third of U.S. homes, it
probably would unscramble its signal, giving all cable subscribers
and satellite dish owners access to the commercial-free Emmy
telecast.</TE>
<TE>   But the Emmys still would not be available to nearly 20% of U.S.
homes, or more than 40 million U.S. residents. Sources say there has
been talk of repeating the ceremony the following week on the WB
network -- which, like HBO, is a unit of AOL Time Warner Inc. (The WB
also is part-owned by Tribune Co., owner of the Los Angeles Times.)</TE>
<TE>   Any agreement must be approved by the academy's board of
governors, which is scheduled to meet Wednesday night. However, the
academy does not have to finalize a deal at that meeting, and sources
say the group has invited network representatives to attend, leaving
the door open for a competing offer.</TE>
<TE>   Network sources were not sure they would come up with an alternate
proposal with, as one put it, "a gun to our heads." Academy officials
said they would present all overtures to the board, whose members
represent 27 industry peer groups, from animation to title design.</TE>
<TE>   The academy has long argued that the Emmys are undervalued
relative to other awards. For example, the Grammys, which honor the
music industry, attract a comparable audience overall but earn an
estimated $25-million annual fee from CBS.</TE>
<TE>   Academy officials say the TV awards generate about $20 million in
profit each year for the host network and based their asking price on
splitting that amount. Entertainment attorney Ken Ziffren has
spearheaded the negotiations on behalf of the academy.</TE>
<TE>   The broadcast networks, meanwhile, have resisted increasing their
fee, contending that the Emmys are a chance for the industry to honor
itself and therefore are different from other award shows. Moreover,
the TV academy is vulnerable to punitive action by the networks,
which in the past has included withholding Emmy nominees, declining
to purchase tickets and attend the event, and threatening to
establish a rival TV awards show.</TE>
<TE>   The last time the academy forged an exclusive Emmy deal was in
1993, signing a four-year pact with ABC. A year later, the parties
tore up that agreement and the academy entered into a rotating
arrangement among the four major networks, succumbing to threats of a
boycott and having advertising withdrawn from its official
publication, Emmy magazine.</TE>
<TE>   An agreement also would be risky for HBO, which has made winning
awards a key component of its marketing strategy, generally running
neck-and-neck with NBC in Emmy nominations and victories the last
several years.</TE>
<TE>   Industry sources said the proposed agreement could make it appear
as if HBO is, in essence, buying awards, inasmuch as the pay service
essentially would be underwriting the TV academy. In addition, fewer
people probably would see the telecast, potentially reducing its
effectiveness as a promotional tool.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were at HBO, I would rather be on NBC, with 20 million
viewers, having people thank HBO," said one academy insider.</TE>
<TE>   An HBO spokeswoman would say only that it is "inappropriate for us
to comment on the business of the TV academy."</TE>
<TE>   In 1987, News Corp.'s then-fledging Fox network nearly tripled the
license fee to land the Emmys exclusively. Ratings for the show
plummeted, however, as the major networks more aggressively offered
counterprogramming against the telecast -- another side effect that
could result from a cable deal.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Frank, who headed the TV academy at the time, recalled
years ago that the networks "all went after it with a vengeance."</TE>
<TE>   Academy officials say the increased fee is necessary to finance
scholarship programs and other activities, without requiring it to
engage in extensive corporate fund-raising.</TE>

<HD>Calif. Reaches Settlement With Power Provider</HD>
<DH>Suits accusing Williams Cos. of gouging during the energy
crisis will be dropped in exchange for concessions the state values
at $1.8 billion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Hirsch and Dan Morain</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>California agreed Monday to drop its lawsuits against Williams Cos.,
one of the major power companies accused of price gouging during the
energy crisis, in exchange for concessions and payments that the
state says could exceed $1.8 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis and Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer announced the
settlement with Tulsa, Okla.-based Williams days after federal
prosecutors signaled they were pressing ahead with a criminal
investigation into alleged manipulation of energy prices in
California and issued subpoenas to Williams and four other companies.</LD>
<LD>   In its deal with California, Williams agreed to renegotiate $4.3
billion in long-term power contracts with the state.</LD>
<TE>   The deal provides no rate breaks for utility customers, many of
whom have seen their bills rise as much as 40% since the energy
crisis of 2000-01. But Davis called the settlement an "important
victory for consumers" in the long term, in part because Williams
agreed to cut the cost of electricity it will supply to Californians
in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "This may become a template for more agreements," Lockyer said.
"We are in very active negotiations" with other companies, including
Duke Energy Corp., Reliant Resources Inc. and Mirant Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The state has accused energy companies of overcharging California
as much as $9 billion for energy purchases made during the height of
the electricity crisis. State officials maintained that Williams
accounted for about $400 million of that.</TE>
<TE>   In settling with the state, Williams admitted no wrongdoing.
However, Williams is one of at least five major players in California
subpoenaed by the U.S. attorney's office in San Francisco to turn
over information about their involvement in the state's power
markets. Others include Duke, Reliant, Mirant and AES Corp.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the settlement, Williams agreed to cut the price of its
long-term energy contracts by as much as $1.4 billion over 10 years,
state officials said. The exact savings will depend on future energy
demand, among other factors.</TE>
<TE>   The company also will make payments and other concessions valued
at $417 million, including $180 million in discounts on energy
contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Williams will give the state six electricity-generating turbines
valued at $90 million and will make a $147-million cash payment over
eight years. The cash will be split among the states of California,
Oregon and Washington, as well as various local governments.
California will use $80 million of its cash payment to convert public
schools to solar energy.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement also ends the state's litigation accusing Williams
of illegally pricing energy and double-selling electricity.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone was impressed with the state's settlement.</TE>
<TE>   After reviewing the renegotiated contracts Monday, Mike Florio,
senior attorney with the Utility Reform Network, a San
Francisco-based consumer group, said state officials were overvaluing
the concessions.</TE>
<TE>   "From our perspective it looks like they rearranged the long-term
contracts but did not provide any real savings unless the state
chooses not to buy power from Williams after 2007," Florio said.</TE>
<TE>   Florio also said discounts on other contracts would be of little
benefit.</TE>
<TE>   "The prices of the natural gas contracts looked to be reasonable
considering current market prices are not at historic lows as the
Davis people claim," he said. "If anything, it is guaranteeing
Williams a market for its gas, rather than giving the state a
concession."</TE>
<TE>   California jumped into the energy business in 2001 after soaring
wholesale energy prices drove the state's two largest utilities --
Edison International unit Southern California Edison and PG&amp;E Corp.'s
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. -- to the brink. The utilities were unable
to purchase power from their usual suppliers because they ceased
being credit-worthy.</TE>
<TE>   Edison eventually worked out a deal with the state Public
Utilities Commission to use surplus rate collections to pay off its
energy debts and avoid Bankruptcy Court. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from its creditors.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, 29 companies including Williams signed $43 billion in
contracts to provide the state Department of Water Resources with
power for California over the next 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   This year, state regulators asked the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission to overturn dozens of the contracts. The state said they
should be nullified because they were signed when companies were
illegally manipulating the state's energy market in spring 2001. FERC
has set a hearing on the issue for Dec. 2, with a decision expected
in February.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates have criticized the Williams contracts as among
the state's worst. The Williams deal required the state to buy
electricity whether it was needed or not. It also relieved Williams
from any new taxes that might be imposed, as well as fines for
pollution coming from power plants that generate the electricity it
will be supplying.</TE>
<TE>   The renegotiated contracts that are part of the settlement
eliminate those terms and provide more flexibility for state power
purchasers.</TE>
<TE>   "We came back to the table this year ready to do the right thing
for everyone involved," Williams Chief Executive Steve Malcolm said
in a statement. "Today's settlement is the result of the productive
dialogue we've had with California officials since we reached an
agreement in principle in July."</TE>
<TE>   Like most energy merchants, Williams has been reeling from falling
prices and credit problems. Lockyer said Williams' desire to shore up
its balance sheet helped speed the talks.</TE>
<TE>   The state said it structured the agreement to get price reductions
and hard assets such as the generators because it feared that cash
payments might be endangered if Williams is pushed into bankruptcy.
Under Monday's deal, Williams will provide turbines to San Diego and
San Francisco for those cities to use as part of new power
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Malcolm said the agreement "preserves the value" of the energy
company's contracts with the state and would give Williams the
ability to sell off its California business.</TE>
<TE>   Its shares, down 90% this year, fell a penny to $2.60 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enron Corp. made its Houston headquarters a little less conspicuous
over the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   The failed energy giant's trademark "tilted-E" signs were removed
from outside the glass 50-story building, as was a wall mount of the
logo at a lobby reception desk that was visible from the street.</LD>
<LD>   "The Enron name is associated with our past, and we're trying to
move forward," spokeswoman Karen Denne said Monday.</LD>
<TE>   The two outside stainless steel signs accentuated by red, blue and
green lights were put in storage, Denne said. The signs and other
surplus equipment and memorabilia will be sold at auctions next year
to raise money for the firm's creditors.</TE>
<TE>   The featured vowel at Enron's auction Dec. 3-5 should be the
rotating black tilted "E" that once lighted up part of the lobby,
Denne said.</TE>
<TE>   A similar steel "E" without the colored lights sold for $44,000 at
an auction in September.</TE>

<HD>FERC Scolded for Lack of Oversight</HD>
<DH>Senate report says the energy agency fails to devote enough
resources to enforcement duties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The federal agency charged with policing the nation's energy markets
to prevent price gouging continues to shirk its enforcement duties, a
congressional report to be released today concludes.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has promised reforms to
prevent a repeat of the abuses that marked California's 2000-2001
electricity crisis.</LD>
<LD>   But a 10-month investigation by the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee found that FERC is far from becoming a tough cop on the
power-market beat, and that it fails to devote sufficient resources
to enforcement or respond aggressively to leads.</LD>
<TE>   "FERC has not institutionally accepted regulation and enforcement
as a primary mission," said the report, prepared for the committee's
chairman, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.). "It must recognize the
need for a total cultural reorientation of its regulatory approach."</TE>
<TE>   The 52-page report by the committee's Democratic staff is set to
be the main subject of a hearing today on FERC's oversight of
once-mighty Enron Corp., which collapsed in December in what was then
the nation's largest bankruptcy filing. The agency had indications of
possible irregularities in Enron's energy business, but did not
follow up, congressional investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   At the least, the report suggested, "more vigilant, aggressive
action by FERC" could have "unearthed some of the cracks in Enron's
foundation earlier."</TE>
<TE>   FERC plans to assign 110 staffers -- about 9% of its personnel --
to a newly formed oversight and enforcement branch. But other
regulatory agencies with comparable responsibilities assign a much
larger proportion of their staffs to the watchdog role, according to
the report, a copy of which was obtained by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   At the Securities and Exchange Commission, the comparable
proportion is 33%; at the Federal Trade Commission, it is 60%.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the array of problems FERC faces, it does not measure up
well," the report said. "FERC must devote more resources to market
oversight and enforcement."</TE>
<TE>   FERC Chairman Patrick H. Wood III said in an interview Monday that
the comparison "is not an apples-to-apples" one. Dozens of other
staff members throughout the agency also have enforcement
responsibilities, bringing the total to 250, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even assuming the 250 number is correct, the report said, only
about 20% of the agency's employees would be committed to market
oversight and enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   "I will be more than happy," countered Wood, "to go back to
Congress and ask for more people if I need to."</TE>
<TE>   With the Senate about to shift to GOP control in the wake of last
week's elections, it's unclear what repercussions, if any, will flow
from the report's findings.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans are perceived widely to have much closer ties to the
energy industry than do Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   The stalled energy bill contains provisions that would give FERC
new authority to levy fines for market manipulation, going beyond its
current power to obtain refunds. And that legislation has greater
chances of passage in a GOP-dominated Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't a partisan issue," said a Democratic committee staff
member who asked not to be identified. "We have demonstrated that
closer scrutiny of the markets is needed. We're going to turn it over
to the Republicans and say, 'We hope you follow up on it.' "</TE>
<TE>   The report found that Enron lobbied the Bush administration for
the appointments of Wood and Nora Brownell, a fellow Republican, to
the commission. But it does not allege that the company received any
benefit as a result. Soon after their appointments last year, Wood
and Brownell voted to impose price limits on wholesale electricity in
California, a policy Enron opposed.</TE>
<TE>   Wood said his main concern with his agency's enforcement branch is
how good a job it does, not how many employees it has.</TE>
<TE>   The committee report, however, took issue with FERC's performance.</TE>
<TE>   Examining a decade of dealings between the company and the agency,
the staff concluded that Enron lawyers were generally a step or two
ahead of FERC regulators. Although much of the criticism was leveled
at Wood's predecessors, the report found the agency still is slow to
react.</TE>
<TE>   One controversy cited in the report involved Enron's allegedly
improper ownership of several wind-generation firms in California.
Investigators concluded that a FERC probe launched only last month
was too little, too late.</TE>
<TE>   FERC's action came after the Justice Department and the SEC
already were on the case. "FERC failed to give adequate -- or in some
cases, any -- scrutiny," the report said.</TE>
<TE>   FERC rules allow companies that generate electricity from wind or
other renewable resources to sell their power above market rates. But
under the rules, Enron would not have been allowed to capitalize on
this advantage because it also owned a public utility.</TE>
<TE>   Enron allegedly set up a front company to which the wind farms
were sold. Named RADR, the company allegedly was created by Enron's
then-chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, and his deputy,
Michael J. Kopper.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow now is facing federal prosecution on fraud, money
laundering, conspiracy and obstruction-of-justice charges. Kopper
pleaded guilty in a plea bargain in August to federal charges of
money laundering and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. He is believed
to be cooperating with prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Committee investigators found that documents the company filed
with FERC contained clues that should have prompted questions about
whether the wind farms truly were independent.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the documents said an Enron subsidiary was to lend
RADR the money to purchase the wind farms.</TE>
<TE>   "FERC was provided with sufficient information to raise
suspicions," the report said. "The record demonstrates a shocking
lack of regulatory vigilance."</TE>

<HD>Kmart Sends Subpoenas to 5 Former Executives</HD>
<DH>The action is part of the retailer's review of management
practices leading up to its Chapter 11 filing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Dow Jones News Service</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kmart Corp. has sent subpoenas to at least five former executives as
part of its review of the management practices leading up to the
company's bankruptcy protection filing.</LD>
<LD>   Former Executive Vice President David Montoya; Senior Vice
Presidents John Owen, Hector Dominguez and William Wulfers; and Vice
President Leo Anguiano have received subpoenas, according to recent
filings with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of
Illinois, where Kmart filed for bankruptcy protection in January.</LD>
<LD>   Dominguez left the retailer in February and Montoya, Owen and
Anguiano departed in March. Wulfers left in May.</LD>
<TE>   The content of the subpoenas wasn't disclosed. Dominguez, Montoya,
Owen and Anguiano filed what's known as a certificate of service
indicating that responses to the subpoena had been turned in to
Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &amp; Flom, the Chicago law firm representing
Kmart in the bankruptcy proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   But based on documents submitted by Wulfers about a week ago, it
would appear that Kmart's attorneys are curious about several
different areas.</TE>
<TE>   Wulfers was asked how often he used the corporate jet, whether he
or his family got gifts related to his job with Kmart, how much he
was reimbursed for relocating to Michigan and whether he made outside
contacts with anyone working for Wal-Mart Stores Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Wulfers also was asked to produce copies of his 2001 and 2002
calendars and whether he had any contact with Wayne Hood, an analyst
at Prudential Securities who first raised the possibility of a Kmart
bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Remington, Wulfers' attorney, declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart's board of directors in May said that it had initiated a
review of former senior executives, including former Chief Executive
Charles Conaway, for possible wrongdoing. The review, which is
expected to wrap up by year's end, was spawned by a number of
anonymous letters the company received purportedly from former
employees.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart in August got court approval for the authority to obtain
documents and conduct a more in-depth investigation. The firm has
indicated that it could file lawsuits against former employees to
recover salaries and loans, among other benefits.</TE>
<TE>   More than 25 executives, including several of the subpoenaed
executives, received $28 million in potentially forgivable loans
during their tenure at the retailer.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart spokesman Michael Freitag declined to comment on the
subpoenas.</TE>

<HD>Onex to Purchase Landmark Theatres</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Onex Corp., a Canadian conglomerate that has been aggressively buying
up movie theater chains during the last three years, has agreed to
buy Los Angeles-based exhibitor Landmark Theatres and Silver Cinemas
for about $80 million.</LD>
<LD>   Landmark is one of the nation's largest art-house chains, and it
operates West Los Angeles' historic Nuart Theatre, South Pasadena's
Rialto Theatre and the U.C. Theatre near UC Berkeley among its 67
theaters with 290 screens across the country.</LD>
<LD>   Landmark is a wholly owned subsidiary of Oaktree Capital
Management, a Los Angeles private equity firm. Landmark is expected
to be operated as a specialty film division of Onex's Loews Cineplex
Entertainment Corp.</LD>
<TE>   Onex and Oaktree already are partners. In March the companies
acquired the New York-based Loews movie theater chain and its
Canadian subsidiary, Cineplex Odeon, as the chain emerged from
bankruptcy protection. Onex acquired a 60% stake in Loews. Oaktree
owns 40%.</TE>
<TE>   Onex's other theater properties include Star Theatres, Magic
Johnson Theatres, Yelmo Cineplex, Megabox Cineplex and Grupo Cinemex.
The company owns 296 theaters with 2,877 screens in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, South Korea and Spain.</TE>

<HD>Liquid Audio Deal With Alliance Ended</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Money-losing Internet music distributor Liquid Audio Inc. and
Alliance Entertainment Corp. canceled their planned merger Monday
because of shareholder opposition, the companies said.</LD>
<LD>   Liquid Audio spokeswoman Kim Strop declined to comment on any
other possible merger talks or the company's plans without Alliance.</LD>
<LD>   "I think that it's safe to say that in the coming days, or even
weeks, you're going to see more information about our future plans,"
she said.</LD>
<TE>   Liquid Audio shareholder MM Cos., formerly Musicmaker.com, had
sued to prevent the merger. The suit claimed Liquid Audio's directors
engineered the transaction to avoid selling the company.</TE>
<TE>   But MM Cos. didn't pursue the litigation. Instead, the company
focused on getting two of the seven seats on Liquid Audio's board.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the board is working well together now," said MM Cos.
Chief Executive James Mitarotonda, who is on Liquid Audio's board.</TE>
<TE>   Liquid Audio had agreed to pay shareholders of Coral Gables,
Fla.-based Alliance 46.2 million shares -- worth about $120 million
at the time the deal was struck -- giving them two-thirds of the
company. Liquid Audio later said it would buy back 10 million shares,
increasing Alliance's stake in the company to about 74%.</TE>
<TE>   Alliance, a distributor of video games, DVDs and compact discs,
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 1997. It is
controlled by AEC Associates, a unit of the Los Angeles investment
firm Yucaipa Cos.</TE>
<TE>   After the deal was struck in June, Redwood City, Calif.-based
Liquid Audio spurned another offer from investor Steel Partners II
over the summer. Representatives of Steel Partners could not be
reached Monday to comment on the collapse of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't received any current offers from them," Mitarotonda
said.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Liquid Audio sold its patents covering the secure
delivery of digital movies, music and other media through the
Internet to Microsoft Corp. The $7-million deal included a license
that allows Liquid Audio to continue using the technology.</TE>
<TE>   Liquid Audio Chief Executive Gerald W. Kearby said at the time
that his company would concentrate on the distribution part of the
business rather than the technology side.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Liquid Audio lost 1 cent to close at $2.74 in Nasdaq
trading Monday. They are up 17% for the year.</TE>

<HD>Dow Sinks 2.1% in Losing Streak</HD>
<DH>Investor anxiety grows over U.N. deadline for Iraq as
markets tumble for a third day. Treasury markets are closed for
Veterans Day.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dow industrials slid 178 points Monday in light holiday trading
as investors fretted about the state of the U.S. economy and whether
Iraq will comply with the U.N. resolution demanding cooperation with
weapons inspectors.</LD>
<LD>   It was the first three-day losing streak for the market since
early October, raising questions about the viability of the rally
that started after major stock indexes reached multiyear lows Oct. 9.</LD>
<LD>   "This is crunch week for the market, if you will," said John
Carey, manager of the Pioneer Fund in Boston, referring to Friday's
deadline for Iraq to respond to the United Nations. "There are
heightened expectations because of the U.N. deadline."</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average sank 178.18 points, or 2.1%, to
8,358.95; the broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index lost 18.55 points,
or 2.1%, to 876.19; and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 40.09
points, or 3%, to 1,319.19.</TE>
<TE>   Losers swamped winners by about 2 to 1 on Nasdaq and the New York
Stock Exchange, but volume was thin as many traders took Veterans Day
off. The Treasury market was closed for the holiday.</TE>
<TE>   Along with growing anxiety over the U.S.-Iraq standoff, the
sluggish U.S. economy is weighing on the investors' minds, analysts
say.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates a surprising
half percentage point last week, it's unclear how well the Fed's
string of rate cuts -- which began in January 2001 -- is working,
Carey said. He noted that many big-name companies such as Cisco
Systems continue to say the outlook for profits remains murky.</TE>
<TE>   Added Rod Smyth, investment strategist at Wachovia Securities in
Richmond, Va.: "There is not sufficient economic or corporate
earnings momentum to sustain a robust, straight-ahead advance" by the
stock market. And though Smyth does not believe deflation is likely,
he said the Fed's bold rate cut reminded investors that such a risk
is out there.</TE>
<TE>   Contributing to the blue-chip slide Monday was speculation that
billionaire Warren Buffett will make a lower-than-expected offer for
General Electric's reinsurance unit. In addition, the departure of
Hewlett-Packard's No. 2 executive raised questions about how smoothly
HP's integration of Compaq Computer will proceed.</TE>
<TE>   GE slid 89 cents to $24.21 and HP lost $1.83 to $14.85. Both are
Dow stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Still, bullish analysts said thin trading volume showed that even
sellers lacked conviction.</TE>
<TE>   "If I see volume in a down market, I'll be concerned," said Philip
Dow, director of equity strategy at brokerage RBC Dain Rauscher in
Minneapolis. "We're in a vacuum. About all the market can do is focus
on Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Other news is "already out there," Dow said, pointing to last
week's elections, in which the Republicans took control of Congress;
last Wednesday's Fed meeting; and third-quarter corporate earnings,
which show S&amp;P 500 profit up 6.9% with most companies having
reported, according to data tracker Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Short-term traders also may simply be taking profits, analysts
say. The Dow had jumped 20.4% or 1,300 points in four weeks before
the cumulative 412-point decline that started Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a nice little run, so it's easy for traders to sell a
little bit," said Fritz Reynolds, manager of the Reynolds Blue Chip
Growth fund in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Hospital stocks continued to slide amid questions about
billings. Tenet Healthcare fell 90 cents to a new 52-week low of $14.
HCA tumbled $3.06 to $36.94 and Health Management Associates lost
$1.08 to $16.79.</TE>
<TE>   * Software maker Oracle dropped 50 cents to $9.05 after Deutsche
Bank downgraded the stock to "hold" from "buy."</TE>
<TE>   * Safeway, which warned Friday that the weak economy was taking a
toll on its earnings, lost 92 cents to $19.08 after union workers at
its Dominick's chain in the Midwest authorized a strike, Reuters
reported. Albertson's dipped 12 cents to $19.70, and Kroger eased 28
cents to $13.82.</TE>
<TE>   Duke Energy dropped $1.55 to $18.41 after it and three other
energy firms were subpoenaed by the U.S. attorney's office in
California as part of a grand jury investigation into the
manipulation of power prices, Bloomberg News reported. Reliant
Resources fell 31 cents to $1.94, Mirant lost 34 cents to $1.91 and
AES slid 45 cents to $1.54.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft to Debut Portable PC Screen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. said Monday that display maker ViewSonic Corp. will
start selling a portable flat-panel screen that can be taken off the
desk and used to operate a computer via a wireless link.</LD>
<LD>   The Smart Display is Microsoft's latest bid to let people access
their computers without being tied to a desk, following the release
last week of the Tablet PC.</LD>
<LD>   Once detached, the new display will allow people to gain access to
e-mail, the Internet, music and everything else on their computers
from a separate location via a wireless connection. It can also be
used at a desk. The displays, which were developed under the code
name "Mira," come with a pen stylus that works like a mouse.</LD>
<TE>   Walnut-based ViewSonic, a closely held maker of computer screens
and flat-panel displays, will start selling 10-inch and 15-inch Smart
Displays sometime during the first three months of 2003, Microsoft
said in a statement. The displays are expected to sell for $999 and
$1,299, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Since they can do anything that can be done on the desktop, the
displays are meant to let users work on a computer without being tied
to the computer's actual location in the home. They run on Microsoft
software that communicates with a personal computer running the
Windows XP operating system.</TE>
<TE>   With sales of desktop PCs slowing, the Redmond, Wash.-based
software giant is trying to move away from the desktop and into
living rooms and people's pockets.</TE>
<TE>   Other companies, such as Philips Electronics and NEC Corp., are
also planning to make Smart Displays.</TE>
<TE>   Meant to be used in households, the Smart Display is different
from the Tablet PC, a pen-based portable computer targeted at
professional and business users.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft shares fell $1.24 Monday to close at $53.86 in Nasdaq
trading.</TE>

<HD>Nasser Joins Bank One's Venture Unit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jacques Nasser, the former Ford Motor Co. chief executive who was
ousted last year after a stormy 34-month reign as head of the world's
No. 2 automaker, was named head of Bank One Corp.'s venture capital
unit Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Nasser, 54, will work in Detroit at the bank's One Equity Partners
arm to find, evaluate and make investments worldwide. Chicago-based
Bank One, the No. 6 U.S. banking group, has about a $3.7-billion
venture capital portfolio. These units typically take early stakes in
developing companies, with the aim of profiting when they are bought
or sell shares to the public.</LD>
<LD>   A hard-charging and controversial auto executive, Nasser was
ousted as Ford CEO in October 2001, a year the company reported a
$5.45-billion loss. He has since been blamed for a whole catalog of
ailments at the automaker, which is in the midst of a multiyear
turnaround effort aimed at restoring profitability.</LD>
<TE>   Nasser told reporters Monday he still spoke with Ford Chairman
William Clay Ford Jr., and felt loyal to the company. Ford went from
a profit of $7.24 billion in 1999, the year Nasser assumed leadership
of the company, and a profit of $3.47 billion in 2000, to its loss
last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd probably do a lot of things differently, but so would any
person in any situation with the knowledge of hindsight," Nasser
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some described Bank One's linkup with Nasser as a good idea.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a good and very creative hire," said Bear Stearns
analyst David Hilder.</TE>
<TE>   "I assume it's driven largely by Dick Cashin, who's the head of
Bank One's private equity business," Hilder said. "Dick has spent a
lot of time making very successful purchases of industrial companies
and basic manufacturers. Obviously Nasser would be very effective in
helping to evaluate these kinds of companies."</TE>
<TE>   Nasser also will become nonexecutive chairman of imaging company
Polaroid Corp., the bank said. An affiliate of One Equity bought
Polaroid's business in July after the firm's bankruptcy filing last
year.</TE>

correspondents, asking for updated contact information. Once
received, the system automatically changes the user's Microsoft
Outlook contact list to reflect the new data.</LD>
<LD>   The system will become more useful as more people join because it
allows users to dispatch updates on their whereabouts to everyone
else who uses Plaxo without sending any e-mail.</LD>
<TE>   Parker, 22, said he came up with the idea out of frustration after
assembling a huge number of contacts very quickly, then having much
of the information go bad.</TE>
<TE>   "I realized my address book was such a mess, the only way to fix
it would be to raise money, recruit a team and build a company to do
it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Plaxo's board consists of ex-Yahoo Inc. Chief Executive Tim Koogle
and Michael Moritz of Sequoia Capital, which invested $2 million in
the venture.</TE>
<TE>   The firm's advisors include Napster's better-known principal
founder, Shawn Fanning, who left the music-swapping firm recently
during its bankruptcy proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Plaxo's competitors include 2-year-old GoodContacts.com Inc. of
Ottawa, which offers a pay service, and AddressSender.com from
Glenwood Springs, Colo.-based Udell Enterprises Inc., which has both
free and pay offerings. Some analysts who have been using Plaxo say
it represents an improvement over the competition.</TE>

<HD>Port Talks Covering Pensions to Begin</HD>
<DH>Some fear a showdown over the union's demand for a big
increase could undo earlier progress.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Cleeland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shipping companies and West Coast dockworkers are set to take up the
issue of pension benefits Wednesday when they return to mediated
labor negotiations after a weeklong break. By all accounts, it won't
be an easy day.</LD>
<LD>   The International Longshore and Warehouse Union is demanding a
major pension increase in exchange for accepting cargo-moving
technology that will eliminate hundreds of jobs. Yet the Pacific
Maritime Assn., which represents shipping lines and terminal
operators, says it can't go much higher than the 25% increase it put
on the table in October.</LD>
<LD>   Steve Stallone, the union spokesman, declined to say how much of a
bump the ILWU is seeking, but several sources said the demand is more
than double the PMA's offer.</LD>
<TE>   Some worry that a showdown over the issue could threaten the
fragile agreement made two weeks ago on technology, after weeks of
disruptions and a 10-day employer lockout.</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, reaching a deal on pensions would remove one of the
final obstacles to a full labor contract.</TE>
<TE>   Both parties are under a federal court order to keep the ports
open and operating at a normal pace, but the order expires in late
December. Negotiations are taking place in a San Francisco hotel
under the supervision of Peter J. Hurtgen, director of the Federal
Mediation and Conciliation Service.</TE>
<TE>   Going into the talks on worker pensions, both sides claim the
moral high ground. Shipping lines say their offer of a 25% jump over
five years is generous, particularly given their earlier commitment
to maintain fully paid family health insurance. The offer was part of
a comprehensive contract proposal rejected by the union in October.</TE>
<TE>   "The numbers are huge," said an industry financial expert who
asked not to be named, citing the sensitive status of the
discussions. "We're facing spiraling health benefit costs already....
There is a cash flow issue here."</TE>
<TE>   On top of that, the shipping lines are required to keep workers'
pension accounts 85% funded so as to guarantee the money will be
there when people retire.</TE>
<TE>   But lately, heavy stock market losses have cut into those
accounts, the industry source said, meaning that employers now must
come up with the cash to shore them up. That alone will cause PMA
pension contributions this year to soar to more than $60 million from
$23 million, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Combined with increases granted in 1993 and 1999, the latest offer
would triple the value of a longshore pension from what it was a
decade ago, bringing the maximum annual retirement benefit to about
$50,000. Shipping companies also contribute up to $2,000 a year to a
401(k) plan.</TE>
<TE>   But the union says its pension plan was inadequate in the early
1990s and is just now coming up to industry standards. Union leaders
also contend that a large pension boost is a fair trade-off for its
acceptance of computer systems, scanners and other technology that
will eliminate at least 400 highly paid marine clerk jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "We figure they're going to save at least $200 million a year,"
said Stallone, the union spokesman. "So what we want are some
increases in the pensions that will make sure people can retire in
dignity."</TE>
<TE>   A substantial pension benefit increase would buck recent national
trends, said Dallas Salisbury, president of the Employee Benefit
Research Institute, a Washington group. In recent years, employers
have been pushing to move retirement funds away from defined-benefit
plans and into plans that carry less liability.</TE>
<TE>   A defined-benefit plan guarantees a fixed monthly payment upon
retirement. Other plans, by contrast, merely set an amount
contributed by an employer during a worker's career; once the worker
retires, the company is no longer on the hook.</TE>
<TE>   However, unions have been loath to give up traditional pensions,
which are seen as an important selling point for labor to potential
members.</TE>
<TE>   "Union negotiators hang pretty tough on that," said Shaun O'Brien,
the top pension official at the AFL-CIO.</TE>
<TE>   In private industry, about 70% of union workers are covered by
defined-benefit pension plans, compared with about 16% of nonunion
workers, according to the federal 1999 National Compensation Survey.</TE>
<TE>   Sectors with heavy union density and a long history of union
representation, such as the maritime industry, tend to have strong
pensions, O'Brien said.</TE>
<TE>   Although it may be the envy of many nonunion employees, the ILWU's
pension plan -- even with the proposed 25% increase -- falls at the
low end of the normal range for union workers in similar situations,
said the manager of a major pension consulting firm who asked that he
and his firm not be named, because his comments could upset one or
both sides in the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the richest by a longshot," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A pension industry rule of thumb is that retirement funds,
combined with Social Security payments, should equal about 70% of
annual wages.</TE>
<TE>   For longshore workers at the low end of the scale, such as basic
laborers in smaller north coast ports, the $50,000-per-year payment
would more than meet that requirement. But longshore clerks and
foremen earn on average $118,000 to $158,000 a year with overtime and
shift premiums.</TE>
<TE>   "At the lower end of the wage scale, it's rich," said the manager.
"At the higher end, it's more than mediocre, but nowhere near the
greed scale."</TE>

<HD>Pacific Sunwear Profit Rises 79% on Girl Power</HD>
<DH>The Anaheim-based apparel retailer makes inroads with
female shoppers, boosting its same-store sales.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Abigail Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Teen apparel retailer Pacific Sunwear of California Inc. on Monday
reported a 79% increase in third-quarter profit, as the Anaheim-based
company continued to gain new ground with girls.</LD>
<LD>   PacSun, which sells private label and brand-name surfing,
skateboarding and snowboarding-style fashions, earned $15.9 million,
or 48 cents a share, for the three months ended Nov. 2. That's up
from $8.9 million, or 27 cents a share, a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   "It was an exceptional quarter, especially given how weak
Generation Y apparel sales have been in general," said Bob Buchanan
of A.G. Edwards in St. Louis, who has a "buy" recommendation up to
$32 a share and doesn't own any PacSun stock.</LD>
<TE>   Sales for the quarter rose 24.7% to $228.2 million, from $183
million a year ago. In stores open at least a year, sales were up
12%, with a 12% gain at PacSun stores and 13% same-store sales gain
at its d.e.m.o. stores, which focus on urban street wear.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, PacSun raised its third-quarter earnings fore- cast
from 40 cents a share to 47 cents to 48 cents a share based on strong
October sales.</TE>
<TE>   So-called same-store sales, or sales from stores open at least a
year, are a key measure of a retailer's health because the figure
excludes new and closed stores, which can skew results.</TE>
<TE>   Those sales gains drove the company's earnings increase, Chief
Executive Greg Weaver said, as PacSun was able to better leverage
expenses and improve operating margins.</TE>
<TE>   "Girls was a huge contributor," Jennifer Black of Wells Fargo
Securities said. "They set out to expand their business in girls, and
it was a smart goal, because girls shop more than guys."</TE>
<TE>   While the traditionally male-oriented stores gained 4% in its
men's business for the quarter, PacSun's women's business grew by 17%
compared with the same period a year ago. Girls accounted for 42% of
apparel sales at PacSun through the year's first nine months, up from
38% a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "A year ago, you had to be a tomboy to shop at PacSun, and now
they're doing a much better job of appealing to a broader range of
girls," Buchanan said. "The guy's bottoms business remains in the
dumpster. That's being hurt across the industry by a lack of newness.
Guys are wearing the same cargo pants they've been wearing now for a
couple of years."</TE>
<TE>   During a conference call with analysts Monday, executives said
they remained comfortable with fourth-quarter profit guidance of 50
cents a share, on same-store sales gains of 2% to 4%. For 2003,
PacSun officials said, they expect to return to double-digit
operating margins for earnings per share of $1.55 to $1.57.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole company, in both divisions, is very fashion right,"
Black said. "They don't look like all the other teen retailers and
that's a good thing."</TE>
<TE>   Shares in PacSun, which reported results after the market closed,
fell 99 cents to $24.82 on Nasdaq. PacSun shares are up 21.5% this
year, compared with the S&amp;P small cap apparel index, which is down
4.8%.</TE>
<TE>   PacSun also has benefited from slowing the company's rate of
expansion, Buchanan said.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of this year, the company will have increased its total
square footage by about 15% -- well below the rates of a few years
ago. In January 2001, the company had increased square footage by
41%; as of last January, PacSun was up 31%.</TE>
<TE>   "They made the wise choice last year to maximize the returns on
what they've got now as opposed to remaining fixated on this physical
growth mantra that is starting to do the rest of the industry in,"
Buchanan said.</TE>
<TE>   The company operates 607 PacSun stores, 71 PacSun outlet stores
and 109 d.e.m.o. stores, which sell hip-hop and rap music-inspired
clothing.</TE>

<HD>Sprint Chairman Has Lymphoma</HD>
<DH>William Esrey will continue his duties and is expected to
make a full recovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sprint Corp. said Monday that its chairman and chief executive,
William Esrey, has lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system, but he
will keep his day-to-day responsibilities at the No. 3 U.S.
long-distance telephone company and is expected to make a full
recovery.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors at Duke University Medical Center, where the illness was
diagnosed, informed Esrey that the lymphoma was considered highly
treatable and they anticipated a full recovery, the company said.</LD>
<LD>   The usual course of treatment involves several hours one day every
three to four weeks, which will allow Esrey to continue to handle his
full responsibilities.</LD>
<TE>   Esrey, 62, joined Sprint, then known as United Telecommunications
Inc., in 1980 as executive vice president of corporate planning. He
became chief executive in 1985 and added the title of chairman in
1990.</TE>
<TE>   The news was released after the close of markets. Shares of
Sprint's main FON Group, which includes its local and long-distance
telephone and data operations, fell 30 cents, or 2.3%, to $12.90 on
the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Sprint PCS, its wireless
telephone arm, closed at $3.60, down 6 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the Overland Park, Kan.-based company said
third-quarter revenue rose 3% to $6.79 billion. The company has
struggled with a drop in wireless telephone subscribers and lower
voice telephone revenue and call volume, but it has made progress in
cutting costs and reducing its debt.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Entertainment Sales Off 24%</HD>
<DH>Company blames the drop in its U.S. division on fewer movie
releases and reduced attendance at its theme parks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Verrier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal's U.S. entertainment division saw a 24% drop in
revenue in its third quarter mostly because of fewer theatrical
releases and reduced attendance at its Universal Studios theme parks.</LD>
<LD>   Vivendi Universal Entertainment posted quarterly revenue of $1.28
billion, down from $1.68 billion during the same period a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   Vivendi blamed the falloff mostly on fewer summer movie releases,
which included "The Bourne Identity," "Blue Crush" and "About a Boy."</LD>
<TE>   Last year, Universal dominated the box office with such hits as
"The Fast and the Furious" and "Bridget Jones's Diary."</TE>
<TE>   "They just don't have the same slate they did a year ago," said
Paul Kim, an analyst with Kaufman Bros.</TE>
<TE>   Universal, however, should get a big lift this quarter from the
movie "8 Mile," starring rapper Eminem, which was the top movie this
weekend with more than $50 million in North America ticket sales.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's theme parks also have been suffering from an
industrywide slump exacerbated by last year's terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Sales at Universal Music Group, the world's largest music company
with artists such as Bon Jovi and Eminem, fell 9% to $1.31 billion in
the quarter, down from $1.44 billion a year ago, as the music
industry faces a sales slowdown because of rampant piracy on the
Internet.</TE>
<TE>   For the nine months Vivendi Universal's revenue rose 9% to $44.1
billion, up from $40.6 billion for the same period a year ago. The
number includes Vivendi's water utility business, French mobile phone
business, as well as sales from the entertainment assets acquired in
May from USA Networks.</TE>
<TE>   The Paris-based entertainment conglomerate will report its
third-quarter earnings separately this month.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Jean-Rene Fourtou is trying to restore investor
confidence in Vivendi after his predecessor, Jean-Marie Messier, left
the company with $19 billion in media debt from several acquisitions,
including Universal Studios, as he transformed Vivendi from a water
utility into a global media giant.</TE>
<TE>   However, Vivendi Universal is facing criminal probes in France and
the U.S. as authorities investigate whether the company under Messier
misled investors about its near-bankruptcy filing this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Last week Vivendi Universal's lawyers held preliminary meetings
with attorneys from the Securities and Exchange Commission and U.S.
attorney's office in New York about handing over company documents,
including financial releases in the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, three French judges in a similar criminal case heard
evidence from a shareholders group accusing Vivendi of filing
multiple versions of its annual report to conceal its financial
condition from shareholders and market regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Messier has denied any wrongdoing and is promoting his tell-all
memoir, "My True Diary," due to be published in France this week.</TE>
<TE>   In the book Messier admits making too many acquisitions, but he
also blames his ouster on a group of influential French businessmen,
including board member Claude Bebear.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's shares closed at $13.52, down 44 cents, on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Superior to Increase Wheel Production</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Hart</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Superior Industries International Inc. said Monday that it plans to
expand manufacturing capacity about 25% in the next two years because
automakers are using more aluminum wheels.</LD>
<LD>   The second-largest maker of wheels for cars and light trucks will
increase production at factories in Pittsburg, Kan., and
Fayetteville, Ark., Superior said. Company officials were not
available for comment.</LD>
<LD>   Superior last month posted a 65% gain in third-quarter net income
to $17.7 million on a sales increase of 28% to $187.4 million. The
Van Nuys-based company also said it won new aluminum-wheel contracts
from General Motors Corp. for the Hummer H2 and Cadillac Escalade
sport utility vehicles and the Buick LeSabre sedan.</LD>
<TE>   The company said it added production capacity during the last few
years at plants in Rogers, Ark., and Van Nuys, as well as building a
factory in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Superior shares fell 83 cents to $40.73 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The stock has gained 1.2% this year.</TE>

<HD>Investors Returning to Telecom-Sector Bonds</HD>
<DH>Prices are being bid up as buyers see brighter prospects
amid cost and debt reductions. Rating firms remain cautious.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters and Times Staff</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some bond investors who wrote off the telecommunications sector over
the summer have swarmed back in recently, betting that cost cutting
and debt reduction will allow more of the industry's troubled
companies to survive.</LD>
<LD>   Yet analysts warn that true bond bargains in the sector are harder
to find as yields decline.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last month, the yield premium that telecom company bonds
pay over U.S. Treasuries has narrowed sharply as investors have bid
up the prices of the bonds.</LD>
<TE>   For example, on Oct. 8, the price of Sprint Capital Corp. bonds
maturing in 2028 and paying an annual interest coupon of 6.88% was
quoted at $53.96 per $100 face value. The effective annualized yield
on the bonds was 13.16%, or 8.46 percentage points above the yield on
30-year Treasury bonds.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday the Sprint Capital bonds were quoted at $68.46 per $100
face value, with a yield of 10.41%, or 5.62 percentage points above
the 30-year T-bond.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the price of AT&amp;T Wireless bonds maturing in 2011 and
paying a 7.88% annual interest coupon has zoomed from $73.59 per $100
face value on Oct. 8 to $91.57 as of Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the AT&amp;T Wireless bonds has fallen from 13.16% to
9.35% in that period.</TE>
<TE>   The turnaround in the telecom sector has been stoked in part by
the stock market's rebound since early October. As many telecom
stocks have resurged, investors have become more confident about the
companies' bonds.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T Wireless shares have jumped from $3.65 on Oct. 8 to $6.16 on
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked like people wanted to buy some of this stuff [telecom
bonds] and were waiting for some neutral sign rather than bad news,"
said Tom Parker, high-yield bond portfolio manager at Barclays Global
Investors.</TE>
<TE>   He said solid third-quarter earnings reports from Sprint FON
Group, AT&amp;T Wireless and other telecom firms helped revive interest
in the bonds.</TE>
<TE>   But credit-rating agencies are still cautious on the telecom
sector, which has been racked by bankruptcies over the last two years
because of extreme industry overcapacity.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the surviving companies are trying to reduce expenses and
lower their overall debt levels, but some analysts worry that
companies are running out of opportunities to cut costs without
hurting their businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we'll continue to see capital expenditures revised
downward, but there comes a point where if you revise it too much, it
could affect the quality of the network," said Bill Densmore, a Fitch
Ratings analyst.</TE>
<TE>   Standard &amp; Poor's, in a report on the sector last month, said
business risks have increased for many companies as a sluggish
economy adds to competitive pressures.</TE>
<TE>   But bond research firm CreditSights Inc. said there is still room
for gains in telecom bonds. "What is gaining traction with investors
is the industry's consistent efforts to reduce once-ambitious capital
spending intentions and to scale back expansion plans," CreditSights
said.</TE>

<HD>Accounting Board to Keep 1st Meeting Private</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press and Times Staff</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The new board to oversee the accounting industry, steeped in
controversy over the selection of former FBI and CIA Director William
Webster as its chairman, plans to hold its first meeting behind
closed doors Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The controversy over Webster already has brought the resignations
of Harvey L. Pitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, and Robert Herdman, the SEC's chief accountant.</LD>
<LD>   The five-member accounting oversight board plans to privately
discuss in Washington administrative matters, such as office space
and staff, several people close to the matter said Monday. They spoke
on condition of anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   The closed-meeting decision prompted an objection from Barbara
Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of
America.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole point of creating this board was to restore investor
confidence," she said. "They will further the impression that the
public interest isn't being served."</TE>
<TE>   But one member of the board, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the first meeting was likely to be "as exciting as watching
paint dry" because of the mundane nature of the board's first chores.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the SEC and other government regulatory agencies, the new
oversight board -- created by Congress in summer -- isn't subject to
so-called "sunshine" laws requiring that meetings be open to the
public.</TE>
<TE>   Webster was chosen to head the board over the objections of the
SEC's two Democratic commissioners. After the 3-2 vote approving
Webster on Oct. 25, it was revealed that Webster had served as a
director of a company that had fired its accounting firm in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Webster told Pitt about his service on the board of U.S.
Technologies, but Pitt apparently did not tell the other four SEC
commissioners before the vote.</TE>
<TE>   That sparked a firestorm in Washington, driving Pitt to resign
last week. Herdman, whom Pitt had asked to look into Webster's
record, also quit last week.</TE>
<TE>   Webster said last week he will step aside if he decides he can't
be effective heading the board because of the controversy.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush, in comments last week, would not indicate whether
he wanted Webster to remain, saying he wanted to see the results of
an internal SEC investigation into the selection process for the new
board.</TE>
<TE>   Webster did not return a telephone call seeking comment Monday.</TE>

<HD>Beef Up the Biotreaty</HD>
<DH>U.S. opposition to strengthening the Biological Weapons
Convention defies logic in a time of increasing threats.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You'd think the U.S. would be eager to embrace the goal of a summit
on biological weapons that convened Monday in Geneva: to strengthen
the Biological Weapons Convention, a treaty drafted in 1972 and since
ratified by 146 nations, including this one, to ban the development,
production and stockpiling of biological weapons. Improvement
certainly is needed; after all, as Undersecretary of State for Arms
Control John Bolton has pointed out, the treaty, though
well-intentioned, is toothless, lacking any mechanism to verify
compliance.</LD>
<LD>   The impotence of the treaty is alarming because the threat posed
by biological weapons, widely recognized since the anthrax attacks,
has been growing. For instance, new biotechnologies have made it easy
for scientists in hostile nations like North Korea and Iraq to turn
harmless microbes into deadly biological agents that are impossible
to counter with existing drugs.</LD>
<LD>   Far from cheering on the summit, however, Bolton seems bent on
subverting it. Last week, he urged summit leaders to stick to
enforcing the existing treaty. He cautioned that Washington would
oppose adding any stringent enforcement measures, such as an
international system of independent lab inspectors who could travel
at a moment's notice to suspect nations like Iraq, Iran, North Korea,
Libya, Sudan and Syria, as well as to the United States, Britain and
other treaty signatories.</LD>
<TE>   The Bush administration objects to such measures because it fears
they could compromise national security. It worries that the
international lab inspectors might, on a visit to a private drug
company or military lab in the United States, pick up commercial or
military secrets.</TE>
<TE>   But merely rubber-stamping the current weak treaty would be a big
mistake. Here is a key reason: One of its many provisions supposedly
bans the development of toxins like smallpox but permits research for
"peaceful purposes," thus allowing dictators like Saddam Hussein to
use defense "research" as a smokescreen for developing biological
weapons to launch a biological attack.</TE>
<TE>   The leader of the summit, Hungary's Tibor Toth, should address the
Bush administration's legitimate concerns about national security.
Specifically, he should propose that inspectors meet with
private-sector and military officials to work out compromises on a
case-by-case basis. But Toth should not accede to the
administration's request that fundamental improvements to the treaty
be delayed until 2006, the treaty's original "review" time.</TE>
<TE>   Inspections, and the Biological Weapons Convention, are far from
perfect. But however flawed, they remain our best hope of countering
the growing bioweapons threat.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Israelis and Palestinians endured another weekend of killings and
terror that made peace appear even further away and kept Israel's
national election campaign focused on security, while other issues --
peace included -- languished.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, Israeli troops searching for militants shot two
Palestinians to death in separate incidents in the West Bank. On
Saturday, Israeli troops killed a senior leader of Islamic Jihad,
saying the group masterminded a bus bombing last month that killed 14
Israelis. On Sunday, Israeli officials reported preventing three
attempted suicide bombings. Later in the day, at least one gunman
slipped into an Israeli kibbutz whose residents are known for their
pro-peace views and shot five people to death, including two
children. On Monday, witnesses said, Israeli soldiers fatally shot a
2-year-old and wounded two other children at the Rafah refugee camp
in the Gaza Strip. Israel, which reported that the soldiers had come
under fire, said it could not confirm that any casualties had
occurred in the camp.</LD>
<LD>   The kibbutz attack was the ugliest assault on Israelis since Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon's coalition government collapsed late last
month and he brought in hard-liners to handle the defense and foreign
ministries.</LD>
<TE>   The new foreign minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, a former prime
minister, is challenging Sharon for leadership of the Likud Party. He
keeps urging the expulsion from Ramallah of Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat. But kicking Arafat out of the occupied territories would
inflame Arab passions even more -- and at a time when the United
States is trying to maintain Arab support for weapons inspections in
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Washington is sending an envoy to Jordan this week to discuss
reform of Arafat's Palestinian Authority with Europeans and United
Nations officials. Good. The campaign leading to Israel's Jan. 28
elections will no doubt freeze meaningful peace talks, but the U.S.
should not let it halt all movement.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State William Burns said last week
that an end to "violence and terror" and an easing of the suffering
of Palestinians were necessary before any international peace
conference could take place. Palestinian suicide bombings and Israeli
retaliation, he said, have caused, in both Israel and the occupied
territories, a "collapse of faith in a better future."</TE>
<TE>   The endless mayhem is not the only reason people feel helpless,
though. About 20% of Israelis are living in poverty, according to
government figures. Palestinians are even worse off, with
malnutrition increasing and many workers prevented by Israeli
checkpoints from getting to jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Aides to Netanyahu say the economy is a key issue in his campaign
to again become prime minister. Maybe. But suicide bombings make it
less likely that such important issues will get attention. And
violence is more likely to produce a hard-line government suspicious
of Palestinian intentions and unwilling to discuss an eventual
Palestinian state. These developments mean that the U.S. envoy
planning to discuss Palestinian reform as part of the peace process
this week will find the going tougher than before -- but even more
necessary.</TE>

<DH>Attacks on Antonio Villaraigosa foul the process in
Eastside race for City Council.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Negative campaign" is way too positive a label for the sleazy
attacks Los Angeles City Councilman Nick Pacheco's pal Ricardo Torres
has launched against former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa,
who is challenging Pacheco for the 14th District council seat in the
March election.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, March. Voters in this Eastside district don't get the
slightest break from the nasty gubernatorial campaign before being
hit by one that makes the earlier state race look like a game of
patty-cake.</LD>
<LD>   Torres, an attorney who went to law school with Pacheco, says he
plans to raise $500,000 to pay for two attack ads a week in a bid to
get Villaraigosa to drop out of the race.</LD>
<TE>   Just to give a sense of Torres' civility level: The first mailer
was a bigoted diatribe in which he ranted that the former Assembly
speaker and mayoral candidate ignored Latinos while kowtowing to
"white advisors" and "gringos." Villaraigosa filed city and county
complaints Monday charging that the first two fliers violated state
election law.</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco denies having anything to do with the mailers. Either he's
lying or he has pathetically little sway over his friends and
supporters. Whatever. It's now his burden to convince voters not to
hold these creepy outbursts against him.</TE>
<TE>   Attack-style campaigning is not just bad form, it's bad politics.
A Times exit poll found that the negative campaign waged by Gov. Gray
Davis against challenger Bill Simon Jr. contributed to a record low
turnout in last week's general election, especially among blacks and
Latinos. Davis did win, but with less than 50% of the vote and by an
embarrassingly small margin for a race against a gaffe-prone
neophyte.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-Villaraigosa mailers don't even pretend to be about
policy differences. No wonder voters are so turned off.</TE>

<LD>Re "State Republicans See Light in 2006," by Shawn Steel, Commentary,
Nov. 8: It is clear that Steel's Republican fantasy is out of step
with the pulse of California politics. The election proved what many
have already been saying: California is a liberal state. If anything,
the results of a Democratic sweep prove that Democrats want and need
an opposition party -- a party with clear distinctions and leaders
who have convictions.</LD>
<LD>   Danny Jauregui</LD>
<LD>   La Jolla</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'm euphoric about the general election but profoundly ashamed of
California. It's as if San Francisco sprang a leak and poisoned the
rest of the state. Friends of mine from elsewhere suggest that even
living and paying taxes in California is counterproductive, but there
must be hope for a state that gave us the likes of Ronald Reagan. So
I guess it's better to hang around and try to change things. Besides,
I like the climate.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Hansl</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a lifelong Republican, I did not know whether to laugh or cry
after reading Steel's commentary. Talk about denial.</TE>
<TE>   In an election with record low turnout (which always favors
Republicans) and a Republican juggernaut in the rest of the United
States, California Republicans lost badly in every statewide race and
reduced their representation in our congressional delegation. Many
competent Republican challengers once again went down to defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Somehow the California Republican Party leadership cannot seem to
understand that winning elections -- not conservative ideological
purity -- is the key to political power. Unless the party reaches out
more effectively to women and minorities and broadens its statewide
base of support, it is doomed to irrelevant status in this state. The
only way California Republicans will fare better in 2004 or 2006 is
with an immediate change in leadership.</TE>

<TE>   I had to chuckle when Louis Packer (letters, Nov. 7), a
self-proclaimed "lifelong Democrat," lamented that, "As usual, the
California Republican Party decided it would rather be 'right' than
victorious." It's called principle. This lifelong Republican wouldn't
have it any other way.</TE>

<LD>Eric Slater's "A Matter of Life and Death" (Nov. 8) should be
required reading for every civil servant in America. His description
of Illinois Republican Gov. George Ryan's painful soul-searching
about the efficacy and fairness of the death penalty took me back
more than 40 years to my own awakening in this regard.</LD>
<LD>   In one of our staff bull sessions, a conservative colleague at the
Stanford University Graduate School of Business stopped all
discussion of the matter by saying that he would be delighted to see
100 innocent persons put to death rather than have a single guilty
one go free. My only question then and now is whether he would like
to have one of his own kids be such a martyr to law and order. He may
not have meant his remark to have had such an effect, but it
certainly made permanent doubters out of me and everyone else within
earshot.</LD>

<TE>   How can anyone be foolish enough to believe that it is "tough on
crime" to execute an innocent person? Prosecutors and victims should
remember that whenever an innocent person is executed, the guilty
person remains free and undetected. The death penalty should be
administered only when the defendant is guilty beyond all doubt, not
just beyond a reasonable doubt.</TE>

<HD>Slow-Growth Pair Win Seats on City Council</HD>
<DH>Final election tally puts Claudia Bill-de la Pena and Bob
Wilson Sr. on the Thousand Oaks panel. In Ojai, Carol B. Smith's lead
widens.</DH>

<LD>Slow-growth advocates retained their apparent election-night victory
on the Thousand Oaks City Council on Monday after thousands of
outstanding absentee ballots were tallied, according to the county
registrar of voters.</LD>
<LD>   The latest results in the city's cliffhanger council races mean
that Claudia Bill-de la Pena and Bob Wilson Sr. will join Mayor Ed
Masry on the council to create a slow-growth majority.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a historic election, because for the first time we have a
true slow-growth majority," Bill-de la Pena said Monday. "All the
candidates maintained they were for slow growth. But we felt we
really meant what we said.</LD>
<TE>   "With this election, voters of Thousand Oaks have spoken very
clearly and really do want slow growth, not what's been delivered in
the past."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Pro Tem Andy Fox was the top vote-getter in the Nov. 5
election for three council seats. He received 17,114 and was followed
by Councilman Dennis Gillette, who received 13,005. The two were
portrayed as more open to development than candidates on the
so-called "certified slow-growth" slate -- which included Wilson and
Bill-de la Pena.</TE>
<TE>   Bill-de la Pena solidified her third-place position over Michael
Farris with 12,883 votes.</TE>
<TE>   In a special council race to replace newly elected county
Supervisor Linda Parks, Wilson collected 12,510 votes and will finish
out the former councilwoman's term. Masry was not up for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it will make much of a difference," Gillette said
of the council make-up. "I've been a proponent for slow growth and
open space acquisition for 15 years. I think what we have are people
who feel even more passionately about it than I do, who are now
coming on the council."</TE>
<TE>   Gillette said that 95% of the City Council's decisions have been
made on a 5-0 vote, and he doesn't expect that to change.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it'll be a lot of the same," he said. "If you look at the
evolution of the city since 1964, a third of our city is in publicly
held open space and that will continue. Most of the big development
is pretty much resolved. Now that the election is over, I hope the
rhetoric will tone down and we can focus on doing the city's
business."</TE>
<TE>   As in Thousand Oaks, the counting of about 31,000 absentee ballots
countywide did not change the outcome of other races, elections chief
Bruce Bradley said.</TE>
<TE>   "The rich just got richer," Bradley said.</TE>
<TE>   One who got richer was Ojai's Carol B. Smith, whose 10-vote edge
over opponent Bruce Roland for a seat on the Ojai City Council grew
to 32 votes Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Although 2,800 provisional ballots -- those that are damaged and
set aside for hand tally later -- remain uncounted countywide,
Bradley does not think they will make a difference.</TE>
<TE>   "How many can the whole town of Ojai have?" Smith said. "I don't
think Bruce will pull ahead of me."</TE>

<HD>Man, 25, Is Shot to Death on a Canoga Park Street</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A man walking in his Canoga Park neighborhood Monday was shot and
killed by an unknown gunman.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses told police they saw the man walking north on Loma Verde
Avenue at 5:25 p.m., when a dark-colored vehicle, possibly a sport
utility vehicle, pulled into the intersection at Valerio Street and
stopped.</LD>
<LD>   The driver got out, ran up to the man and opened fire, shooting
him several times in the torso. The name of the 25-year-old man was
not released.</LD>
<TE>   Police don't know if the victim and the gunman knew each other.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, we just don't know what the motive is, but it
looked like [the gunman] was definitely targeting this guy," Los
Angeles Police Det. Rick Swanston said.</TE>
<TE>   A resident who asked not to be identified said she was in her
backyard a few houses away and heard the gunshots. "I thought it was
much farther away," she said. "For a shooting to be so close is
scary."</TE>

<HD>Johnny Griffith, 66; Played Keyboard for Motown Greats</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Johnny Griffith, a keyboard player with the Funk Brothers, the highly
skilled group of Detroit studio musicians who helped create and
define the legendary Motown sound, has died. He was 66.</LD>
<LD>   Griffith died of a heart attack Sunday in a hospital in Detroit,
just hours before the local premiere of "Standing in the Shadows of
Motown," a documentary film that gives belated recognition to the
anonymous studio band that furnished much of the instrumental sound
for the fabled Motown hit machine.</LD>
<LD>   A racially integrated collective of about a dozen top jazz and R&amp;B
musicians in Detroit who worked at Motown from 1959 to 1972, the Funk
Brothers provided the background music for Motown greats such as
Marvin Gaye, Diana Ross and the Supremes, Smokey Robinson, the
Temptations, the Four Tops and Stevie Wonder.</LD>
<TE>   Griffith most notably played electric piano on Gaye's "I Heard It
Through the Grapevine" and the Temptations' "Ain't Too Proud to Beg,"
the swirling organ on the Supremes' "Stop in the Name of Love," and
the organ and shotgun effects on Junior Walker and the All-Stars'
"Shotgun."</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, the six surviving members of the Funk Brothers went
ahead with their scheduled performance at a Detroit club after the
local premiere of "Standing in the Shadows of Motown."</TE>
<TE>   "Very few musicians will stop or shut down because of the death of
one of the members," Jack Ashford, the group's percussion and
vibraphone player, told The Times on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "We celebrate his living by playing."</TE>
<TE>   During their Motown days, Ashford said, Griffith "played No. 2
piano to complement Earl Van Dyke," who was known for his
heavier-handed jazz-funk style of playing.</TE>
<TE>   "Johnny had a very beautiful touch, very melodic.... Especially
when he did a ballad, this guy was just incredible," said Ashford.</TE>
<TE>   The Detroit-born Griffith was one of the few classically trained
musicians who worked at Motown. At 16, he was playing with blues
superstar John Lee Hooker. And before joining the Motown studio band
in 1961, he toured with Dinah Washington, Aretha Franklin and Sarah
Vaughan.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to record jazz when he began working at Motown, Griffith
ultimately recorded two albums for Motown's "Workshop Jazz" label.
Although most of Motown's studio musicians worked under exclusive
recording contracts, Griffith continued to moonlight for other R&amp;B
records labels in Detroit and Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Among the non-Motown records Griffith played on as a keyboardist
are Jackie Wilson's "Lonely Teardrops" and "(Your Love Keeps Lifting
Me) Higher and Higher," the Chi-lites' "Have You Seen Her?" and The
Capitols' "Cool Jerk."</TE>
<TE>   Griffith, who recently moved to Las Vegas after living in Detroit
most of his life, returned to his hometown Saturday to promote the
documentary film, which features eight Funk Brothers in their 60s and
70s. One of the eight, drummer Richard "Pistol" Allen, died last
June.</TE>
<TE>   "Standing in the Shadows of Motown," directed by Paul Justman, is
loosely based on Allan Slutsky's acclaimed 1989 book "Standing in the
Shadows of Motown: The Life and Music of Legendary Bassist James
Jamerson."</TE>
<TE>   The Funk Brothers played together in the Detroit club scene from
around 1964 until the early '70s. They got together again to film the
documentary, which was shot primarily in Detroit last year.</TE>
<TE>   After promoting the documentary, the remaining Funk Brothers plan
to go on a national tour.</TE>
<TE>   But it will be difficult doing it without Griffith, Ashford said.
"His dream was to go across the finish line with us."</TE>
<TE>   Griffith is survived by his wife, Delma; three children, Jonathan
Jr., Beth and Rhonda; two stepsons, Roman and Charlie Reid III; and
two grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Family, Friends Recall a Man Who Loved to Fly</HD>
<DH>Mourners gather near the site where Dennis Beitel's plane
crashed in bad weather last week. The accident is being investigated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mai Tran</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dennis Beitel's passion for flying ran so deep that he told family
and friends that when his time finally came, he hoped he was in the
sky, piloting his airplane.</LD>
<LD>   After learning that Beitel's single-engine Cessna had crashed
early Friday morning, family members knew almost immediately where
they must gather to mourn his death.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, about 100 friends and family members met near the
Anaheim hillside where his plane had crashed and celebrated Beitel's
love for food, laughter and flying.</LD>
<TE>   "His time here was good. He made us all happy," said his daughter
Stacy Beitel, 28, of Irvine. "He didn't like funerals or anything
depressing. He'd want us celebrating."</TE>
<TE>   Beitel, a commodities broker in Irvine who typically commuted from
his Temecula residence by air, had been a pilot for about 40 years
and enjoyed flying so much that he taught his parents and his
daughter to fly.</TE>
<TE>   Beitel, 58, was killed when his airplane clipped power lines along
the Riverside Freeway and then nosed into a hill just south of the
freeway near Gypsum Canyon Road. Because of darkness and rough
weather, it took authorities several hours to find the plane and his
body.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the crash has not been determined, but family members
speculated that the stormy weather was probably a factor. National
Transportation Safety Board officials said they would inspect the
wreckage this week at a facility near Palmdale in an effort to
pinpoint the cause.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an experienced pilot, and he flies this path every day," his
daughter said. "He was never afraid to fly. He was cautious, and he
was a great pilot."</TE>
<TE>   Family members said the weather was clear in Temecula when Beitel
left for work Friday. But by the time he crossed the county line, the
weather had changed. "Mother Nature was nasty that morning," said his
son, Nick Beitel, 33, of Lake Havasu City, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   Though Beitel enjoyed winging off to San Diego or Palm Springs for
a weekend getaway, his plane was essentially a commuter vehicle. He'd
drive to French Valley Aviation in Temecula, fly his Cessna 150E to
Fullerton Municipal Airport and then drive to Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Though there were tears at Monday's memorial, laughter was in
greater abundance as friends and family recalled the "big kid" who
was suppose to have been on a diet but recently was caught eating
junk food.</TE>
<TE>   "Tacos and Krispy Kreme doughnuts was Dad's style," Stacy Beitel
said, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   Beitel was remembered as an outgoing sort with a tender side. At
the memorial, there were photographs of him tipping a belly dancer at
an upscale restaurant, cradling his granddaughter in his arms, riding
a horse and vacationing in Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   As mourners took turns riding from Green River Golf Club in Corona
to the crash site on golf carts, colleagues recalled Beitel's
generosity.</TE>
<TE>   "When I started in the business, I thought they'd be sharks," said
Doug Stewart, a co-worker. "But Dennis offered me an account, and we
worked together and both made money. He was very generous, and he was
there for me when I really, really needed it."</TE>
<TE>   Co-workers recalled teasing Beitel about his pastel wardrobe, but
he never seemed to mind. He would tell them that Brenda Benbow, the
woman he lived with, usually picked out his wardrobe the night
before.</TE>
<TE>   "He died the way he wanted to die," Benbow said. "He was the love
of my life. He was a good man."</TE>

<LD>Making good on campaign pledges to protect ridgelines, the Thousand
Oaks City Council is set to vote tonight on spending more than
$210,000 for two vacant parcels to add to the community's permanent
open space.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this year, the council contacted 19 property owners to
determine their willingness to donate or sell their land. Five were
interested.</LD>
<LD>   After appraisals, the city made offers on two sites: a 1.96-acre
parcel south of the Ventura Freeway, adjacent to the Conejo Ridge

<HD>Handout of Radiation Pill Delayed</HD>
<DH>Tablets, for use by those near nuclear reactors in case the
plants are breached, won't be given out until officials decide on the
method.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although California received about 400,000 anti-radiation pills from
the federal government last summer, they won't be distributed until
January at the earliest because health officials are still debating
how best to get the drugs to the public.</LD>
<LD>   The dispute centers on whether the pills should be given directly
to residents who live next to California's two nuclear power plants
or whether they should be placed in hospitals and emergency centers
farther away from the plants.</LD>
<LD>   Until the disagreement is resolved, the potassium iodide pills
will remain locked away in a Southern California storage facility
about an hour away from the San Onofre Nuclear Generation Station and
several hours away from the Diablo Canyon power plant in San Luis
Obispo County.</LD>
<TE>   Community leaders and antinuclear activists expressed frustration
at the delays, saying the pills need to be distributed immediately.
At a minimum, they said, state officials ought to move the pills
closer to the San Onofre and Diablo Canyon plants while they figure
out what to do.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm frustrated by the fact that the process has been so slow,"
said Susan Ritschel, a city councilwoman in San Clemente, just north
of San Onofre. "It doesn't seem like it would be that difficult to
determine how to get these [pills] distributed to folks."</TE>
<TE>   The state last summer requested the pills from the federal
government, which was offering them after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks. The state said it would provide them to people who live
within a 10-mile radius of San Onofre and Diablo Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute comes down to how best to protect the public,
officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Giving the tablets directly to residents would allow people to
take a dose right away if an accident occurs, offering the greatest
protection against thyroid cancer.</TE>
<TE>   However, officials worry that this could delay evacuations and
create a false sense of security. The pills protect against only one
type of radioactive isotope -- radioactive iodine.</TE>
<TE>   Also, it would be impossible to distribute the pills in advance to
every person who would be working, vacationing or passing through the
10-mile evacuation zones.</TE>
<TE>   These concerns are among the reasons some health officials favor
stockpiling the medication at hospitals and other central locations,
allowing everyone who is evacuating to pick up a dose once they are
safely away from the plant.</TE>
<TE>   "We are continuing to work as fast as we can ... to get a plan
finalized and in place so we can move forward," said Eric Lamoureux,
a spokesman for the governor's Office of Emergency Services.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Mark Horton, Orange County's public health officer and a
member of the committee deciding on distribution, said: "If we
distribute, we certainly want to make that clear that this is not a
universal antidote for exposure to any kind of radiation."</TE>
<TE>   In December, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission offered
potassium iodide pills for roughly 4 1/2 million people who live
within 10 miles of a nuclear power plant.</TE>
<TE>   As of late October, 17 states had requested the tablets, according
to the NRC.</TE>
<TE>   The pills have already been given out in New York, New Jersey,
North Carolina, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and
Maryland. Officials in those states used a number of distribution
methods, from mailing them to eligible residents, to having people
pick them up from at drugstores throughout in the evacuation zone, to
giving them away from central distribution points.</TE>
<TE>   However, some states have refused the pills entirely, and others,
such as Florida, have decided to distribute them only if an emergency
occurs.</TE>
<TE>   Potassium iodide is a form of salt. If an accident or attack
caused a radiation release at San Onofre or Diablo Canyon, people who
took a dose would be protected from radioactive iodine being absorbed
by their thyroids, which would decrease their risk of thyroid cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Children are particularly susceptible to radiation-induced thyroid
cancers, which was the most common ailment suffered after the 1986
Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine.</TE>
<TE>   The pill does not block the many other forms of radiation released
if a reactor were breached, and evacuation would remain paramount.</TE>
<TE>   Lamoureux said he believes a decision will be made well before
next summer, which is the federal deadline. Even though the pills are
now in storage, he said that they could be quickly moved in case of
an emergency.</TE>
<TE>   Antinuclear groups were alarmed by the state's lack of action.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tragic. Something could happen tomorrow and those pills
would not be available to people that need them," said Daniel Hirsch,
director of the Los Angeles-based Committee to Bridge the Gap and
former director of the Adlai Stevenson program on nuclear policy at
UC Santa Cruz.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand why the kids are being held hostage to
bureaucratic inertia."</TE>

<HD>Selden Rodman, 93; Poet, Cultural Critic, Collector of Folk
Art</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Selden Rodman, a poet, critic, author, collector and promoter of
Haitian and Central and South American folk art, has died at the age
of 93.</LD>
<LD>   Rodman, who played tennis two days before his death, died Nov. 2
in a Ridgewood, N.J., hospital of unspecified causes. He lived in
Oakland, N.J.</LD>
<LD>   Born to a wealthy Manhattan family and equipped with a trust fund,
Rodman pursued an intellectual life of learning, writing, traveling,
and collecting and encouraging art. He had given large sections of
his vast art collection to his alma mater, Yale University, and to
Ramapo College of New Jersey. The remainder of the collection, housed
in a gallery at his home, was displayed frequently at art museums
across the country.</LD>
<TE>   Rodman wrote or edited more than 40 books of poetry, biography,
travel and commentary on culture -- most of the volumes involving the
celebrity writers and artists he had a knack for cultivating.</TE>
<TE>   A typical book was his 1994 "Geniuses and Other Eccentrics," a
collection of his own snapshots, thumbnail biographies and notes on
how he met each person.</TE>
<TE>   Included in that name-dropping volume were Ezra Pound, Ernest
Hemingway, Norman Mailer, Allen Ginsberg, W.H. Auden, Robert Frost,
Robert Lowell, Octavio Paz, Antoine de Saint-Exupery, Jackson
Pollock, Leon Trotsky, Grandma Moses, David Alfaro Siqueiros,
Bertrand Russell and Frank Lloyd Wright.</TE>
<TE>   Rodman's 1970 travelogue, "South America of the Poets," toured 12
countries that were illustrated by interviews with their most famous
poets, such as Chile's Pablo Neruda. Praising Rodman's knowledge of
Latin American culture and history, as well as his encounters with
the great writers, a Times book reviewer noted:</TE>
<TE>   "He conveys the ambience of great cities and small, of the jungle
areas and mountain regions and the plains by means of his encounters
with the artists who have sought to identify and explain the
condition of the men who inhabit them. Poets, Rodman assures us, are
among the best attractions a nation may offer."</TE>
<TE>   When Rodman published "The Insider" in 1960, his critical study of
abstract expressionism and nonrepresentational painting, former Times
book critic Robert R. Kirsch said it "very well may be the most
important book I have read so far this year ... a book which needed
to be written. And Selden Rodman has done a superb job of writing
it."</TE>
<TE>   Rodman began the literary part of his eclectic career in his
1930-31 senior year at Yale, when he co-founded the off-campus satire
magazine "The Harkness Hoot." Later he teamed with Alfred Bingham to
co-found and edit the liberal magazine Common Sense.</TE>
<TE>   He first visited Haiti in 1934, bought his first piece of
figurative folk art in 1938 for $25, and returned after World War II
-- in which he served as a sergeant in the Office of Strategic
Services -- to work as co-director of the Centre d'Art of
Port-au-Prince.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1930s, Rodman wrote "The Revolutionists," a play based on
the successful 1803 revolt of colonial slaves against France, which
made Haiti an independent country.</TE>
<TE>   He was given special leave to go to Haiti for the play's premiere
in 1944, granted by Nelson Rockefeller, who, as head of the State
Department Bureau of Inter-American Affairs, thought the production
would foster good feelings toward the U.S. The play prompted the
then-king of Haiti to make Rodman a commander of the Haitian Legion
of Honor and Merit.</TE>
<TE>   Although Rodman became known for collecting folk art from the
Southern part of the Western Hemisphere, he also enjoyed assessing
culture -- or lack of it -- in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   On a speaking trip to Los Angeles in 1952, he told The Times that
the level of culture was declining precipitously in this country and
added as illustration:</TE>
<TE>   "Great art is being created right here in Hollywood, but no one
knows about it.... For instance, there's Igor Stravinsky, Arnold
Schoenberg, Thomas Mann and painter Rico Lebrun. Not one of them has
been used by the motion picture industry."</TE>
<TE>   Thrice divorced, Rodman is survived by his wife of 40 years, the
former Carole Cleaver; three children; and three grandchildren.</TE>

<LD>A citizens group is hosting community meetings today and Thursday to
discuss the ramifications of the MTA's plans for building an
east-west busway across the San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   "It's about educating the public," said Diana Lipari, chair of
Citizens Organized for Smart Transit, which opposes the busway. The
group has invited Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials,
and politicians who support the busway.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this year, the group filed a lawsuit against the MTA,
challenging the busway's environmental impact review. Today's meeting
will take place from 5 to 8 p.m. at the Grant High School auditorium,
13000 Oxnard St. in Van Nuys. Thursday's forum will be at the Taft
High School auditorium, 5461 Winnetka Ave. in Woodland Hills, also
from 5 to 8 p.m.</LD>

<HD>Infection-Risk Alert Follows Student Death</HD>
<DH>Anyone who had recent close contact with the USC freshman
from Dana Point should be treated immediately: It could be
meningitis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Silverstein and Phil Willon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After the death Saturday of a USC freshman from what may be bacterial
meningitis, university officials are urging anyone who has had close
physical contact with the Orange County student over the last 10 days
to immediately seek treatment with antibiotics.</LD>
<LD>   There is "presumptive" evidence that Jered John Connon, 18, of
Dana Point was infected with bacterial meningitis when he died at
Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center, according to public health
officials in Orange County and at USC. Tests to confirm the diagnosis
are pending, said Penny Weismuller, manager of the county's disease
control and epidemiology division.</LD>
<LD>   As a precaution, USC officials on Monday urged students who had
close contact with Connon to go to the campus health center for
treatment.</LD>
<TE>   Connon's family, health-care professionals at the Mission Viejo
hospital and others who had close contact with the young man have
been given antibiotics as a precaution. No one else at the hospital
is considered at risk, Weismuller said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not a public health concern," Weismuller said. "We don't
want to overreact here. All the appropriate measures have been taken.
This is a tragedy ... and we don't want to compound it for the
family."</TE>
<TE>   While contagious, meningitis is rarely transmitted by casual
contact. The bacteria can be spread though the exchange of
respiratory or throat secretions -- including the sharing of eating
utensils, according to county and federal health officials.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. William Leavitt, an internist at the USC Student Health
Service, said the vast majority of people exposed to meningococcal
disease become carriers only and do not suffer the flulike symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   Symptoms may include a fever exceeding 101 degrees, severe
headache, neck and back stiffness, nausea, lethargy, vomiting and a
rash resembling bruises in areas such as the armpits, groin and
ankles. The disease has an incubation period of up to 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, an average of 42 cases of bacterial meningitis
cases were reported each year from 1996 to 2000.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, 45 cases were reported -- about five cases for every
100,000 people in the county -- and four people died, health records
show.</TE>

<HD>More Health Agency Cuts Expected</HD>
<DH>Services for the poor are in jeopardy as county faces an
$8-million shortfall in its budget. Some officials suggest using
tobacco funds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Catherine Saillant</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Health services for Ventura County's poorest residents could be
slashed again as officials look for ways to trim $8 million more from
county government's budget.</LD>
<LD>   The Board of Supervisors in June cut $17 million from the county's
$1.2-billion budget, with health and social service programs taking
the biggest hits.</LD>
<LD>   But more cuts are looming because of the state's continuing
financial problems and limited local revenue, officials warn. Ventura
County's tax base expanded for several years but that has begun to
slow, said Bert Bigler, a senior budget analyst in the chief
executive's office.</LD>
<TE>   "This is going to be a continuing process as we finish out this
fiscal year," Bigler said.</TE>
<TE>   County executive Johnny Johnston will outline the projected
funding shortfall at today's Board of Supervisors meeting. The budget
session will begin at 10:30 a.m. in the supervisors' boardroom at the
Hall of Administration in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors in June slashed 140 vacant positions from the county's
7,900-employee work force. Health-care cuts were also ordered to
eliminate a $17-million funding gap for fiscal 2002-03, which began
July 1.</TE>
<TE>   The county's Health Care Agency is facing the biggest loss at
close to $10 million. But supervisors last month agreed to divert
$6.2 million in tobacco settlement funds to offset some of those
losses.</TE>
<TE>   The latest cutbacks are the result of continuing shortfalls in
funding for mental health services and increased demand for foster
care and counseling programs, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Johnson, chairman of the county's Mental Health Advisory
Board, said supervisors should consider dipping into a tobacco
settlement reserve account before cutting any services. That fund has
$16.1 million in it, but executives have advocated leaving it alone
for now.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said he understands the bind the county is in. But
reducing programs for the mentally ill may not be a wise financial
decision, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They are dependent on the services, because they are ill. For
many of them, that means they are unemployed," Johnson said. "The
danger is that it will be harder for them to get services, especially
if the county closes clinics. Then they are left to their own
devices, and it just gets worse."</TE>
<TE>   There are those who question whether the county's financial
position is as tough as budget officials portray. If the county is in
such dire straits, supervisors should not have recently approved the
purchase of a $12.7-million payroll system, said Barry Hammitt, head
of Service Employees International Union Local 998, the county's
largest labor group.</TE>
<TE>   He also noted that the administrative headquarters for the
county's social services agency is undergoing a major renovation.
"When people see stuff like that, they don't get the impression that
there's a crisis afoot," Hammitt said.</TE>

<HD>Galanter Declares War on Junk</HD>
<DH>City councilwoman's cleanup of her north Valley district
has yielded 140 tons of trash. 'Sadly, this is just the tip of the
iceberg,' she says.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Councilwoman Ruth Galanter is tired of being dumped on.</LD>
<LD>   Appalled by the amount of illegal trash left in her northeast San
Fernando Valley district, Galanter's office has teamed up with the
city's Bureau of Sanitation on a crusade to clean up the mess.</LD>
<LD>   "Dumping is a citywide problem, but nothing like what happens out
here," she said of her district, which includes Panorama City, Arleta
and parts of Sun Valley, Pacoima, Van Nuys and North Hollywood.</LD>
<TE>   In recent weeks, sanitation crews have collected more than 140
tons of trash from sidewalks and alleyways in the area, including
everything from broken furniture to rusty refrigerators. More pickups
are planned through the month.</TE>
<TE>   "Sadly, this is just the tip of the iceberg," Galanter said. "Our
work has just begun."</TE>
<TE>   Although dumping is a crime punishable by fines of $20 to $1,000
for a first offense, officials said it's difficult to prosecute
someone unless they are caught in the act or a witness comes forward.
So, Galanter is pushing for surveillance cameras to be installed at
chronic dumping locations.</TE>
<TE>   "Picking up after the criminals who dump this stuff is not
enough," she said. "We need to track them down and prosecute them for
this crime against the community."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Bobek, a lifelong Sun Valley resident, said he was pleased by
Galanter's efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "We are tired of seeing freezers and couches on the parkways
here," said Bobek, 52, a resident of Cantlay Street. "The last three,
four years, it's been getting worse."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after her 6th District was reconfigured in July, Galanter
took a driving tour of her new neighborhoods and saw firsthand the
rampant dumping on streets and sidewalks. "There were couches
everywhere," she said.</TE>
<TE>   To combat the problem, Galanter joined forces with the city's
Bureau of Sanitation to start weekend trash collections in October.
She encourages her constituents to call the agency for assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "Cleaning up has a positive impact on daily life," Galanter said.
"Sometimes it's the people who are hired to clean out a property who
do the dumping. One time a constituent looked in her backyard and
there were 200 old tires there."</TE>
<TE>   The Bureau of Sanitation will pick up large items such as
refrigerators and sofas at homes and apartment buildings with four
units or less. Its line for bulky-item pickups is (800) 773-2489.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy City Atty. Martha Gutierrez, who works closely with
officers in the Los Angeles Police Department's North Hollywood
Division, also encourages the public to call the bureau when they
need help. She said illegal dumping has long been a problem in the
community.</TE>
<TE>   "It is something I hear about all the time and I try constantly to
educate the community about it," she said. "You don't have to put it
on your yard or someone else's. The city will get it for you."</TE>
<TE>   But problems persist, despite Galanter's efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, property along Kagel Canyon Street in Pacoima was
littered with a bed frame, large cabinet and old television.</TE>
<TE>   "That TV has been here for two weeks," said Wendy Becerra, 18, as
she looked at a 25-inch set in a shabby wooden console resting in
front of her parents' house. "It bothers me. It makes the
neighborhood look bad."</TE>

someone left a television in front of her parents' home on Kagel
Canyon Street in Pacoima. Dumped nearby were a bed frame and cabinet.</CP>

<HD>Tree Falls in Forest of Legal Logic</HD>
<DH>Blocking Santa Ana man's front door, it can be removed,
right? Not exactly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Reyes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lewis P. Janowsky is an attorney skilled in words and torts. He
didn't know he would run afoul of Santa Ana ordinance 18-314e.</LD>
<LD>   In other words, no noisy workmen on your property on a federal
holiday. And Monday was a federal holiday.</LD>
<LD>   After coming home Friday and seeing that a Chinese elm had fallen
against his Floral Park house, blocking the front door, Janowsky
thought the solution was simple: He would call a tree trimmer the
next day.</LD>
<TE>   Wrong. The first big storm of the season had created a boomlet for
tree trimmers. He couldn't get anyone to come to his house until
Monday, which was Veterans Day.</TE>
<TE>   That's when he ran into ordinance 18-314e, which allows "noise
sources associated with construction repair, remodeling or grading of
any real property provided said activities do not take place between
the hours of 8 p.m. and 7 a.m. weekends, including Saturday or any
time on Sunday or a federal holiday."</TE>
<TE>   "True, it's not a well-known ordinance, but it's there," said
Santa Ana Police Lt. Bob Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   Officers showed up in the neighborhood because of a complaint
about the hammering and sawing going on at two other homes down the
street from Janowsky's.</TE>
<TE>   After police halted work at those first two houses, they couldn't
ignore the work at Janowsky's. The ordinance doesn't give police
leeway, especially after a complaint, Chavez said.</TE>
<TE>   Police did not issue a citation and allowed the work to continue
long enough to clear a path to Janowsky's front door.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him it was a win-win situation," said Sgt. Bill Barrett.</TE>
<TE>   Janowsky said he would write a letter to City Hall asking that
someone look at the ordinance more closely.</TE>
<TE>   That might not be necessary. City Manager David N. Ream said he
would look into the matter first thing today.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure, in enacting this ordinance, that the intent wasn't to
prevent the removal of trees that fell on houses due to a storm,"
Janowsky said.</TE>

<HD>Tributes Tinged With Anxiety</HD>
<DH>The subject of war with Iraq is not far from the minds of
those who attend Veterans Day programs in Ventura County.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a generation of young Americans await orders to fight abroad,
Ventura County honored veterans of the nation's previous wars on
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   In Simi Valley, more than 4,000 people packed a city park to
listen to an Air Force band and dedicate a $1.5-million plaza
honoring those who have served in the U.S. military.</LD>
<LD>   Other Veterans Day programs took place at the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library near Simi Valley and Oxnard's Plaza Park.</LD>
<TE>   In Ventura, at a cemetery trimmed with American flags, the
commander of the U.S. Navy's local base assured more than 300
veterans and their families that the nation's military is the world's
best fighting force, even as it adjusts to threats from terrorists
who wear no uniforms, answer to no nation and do not hesitate to kill
civilians.</TE>
<TE>   "We are still vulnerable despite our superiority and power," Capt.
Paul Grossgold said at Ivy Lawn Memorial Park. "This enemy is very
difficult to find."</TE>
<TE>   Although speakers did not mention the possibility of a war in
Iraq, it was on the minds of many veterans and others who have lost
relatives and friends in combat.</TE>
<TE>   Like many Americans, Carol Ellinger supports a war but only if it
can be won without many American casualties.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish if we had a war, it could just be all machines ... where
no men or women would die," Ellinger said. She and her husband,
Frank, were both in the Marine Corps during the Vietnam War. He was
killed in Vietnam in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   While Ellinger attended the service Monday in Ventura, her son and
grandson visited the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "The pain never goes away," Ellinger said. For anyone who has lost
a loved one in war, "it will always be in their hearts."</TE>
<TE>   On the Iraq question, retired Lt. Col. Kenneth Todd, a 93-year-old
Army vet from Santa Barbara, said he defers to the
commander-in-chief, President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to do what we've got to do. And if it's to go to war
against Iraq, why, we've got to do it," Todd said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Sept. 11 attacks, Americans must defend themselves
within their own borders, Todd said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to be vigilant -- in fact, that's the price of
liberty," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Veterans Day was first called Armistice Day, commemorating the end
of World War I on Nov. 11, 1918.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 65,000 to 70,000 veterans live in Ventura County. The
new Simi Valley memorial in Rancho Tapo Community Park honors
veterans with granite plaques inscribed with the names of nearly 800
deceased, retired and active servicemen and women.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a really beautiful tribute," said former Simi Valley
resident Denise Reimonenq, who came from Pasadena for the dedication.
The name of her late husband, an Army private, is in granite.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really proud to be part of it," Reimonenq said.</TE>
<TE>   Funded largely by the family of a Vietnam-era nurse, Army Col.
Patricia T. Murphy, Veterans Plaza also features a reflecting pool, a
bronze statue of an eagle and a pavilion displaying flags from the
five branches of the military -- Army, Marines, Navy, Air Force and
Coast Guard.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy's family gave $1 million to Simi Valley and the Rancho Simi
Recreation and Park District from a trust established in her honor.</TE>

<HD>Threat of War Lends Gravity to Veterans Day Observances</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Haldane</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As war prospects loom, Orange County residents gathered Monday to
honor those who have served their country and those yet to do so.</LD>
<LD>   "Those of us who went to war found our lives altered
dramatically," Korean War veteran William Woollett told about 300
people at Santa Fe Depot Park in Orange during his Veterans Day
address. "We learned to use our fear as a positive thing. We got in
touch with our potential -- our hearts and minds were stretched to
the limits."</LD>
<LD>   Woollett, 73, city manager of Aliso Viejo, who lost an eye during
the war, said he favors a war with Iraq if that's what U.S. leaders
decide.</LD>
<TE>   "We must continue our commitment," he said. "We must be vigilant
in sustaining the price we paid then. In order to continue as a
nation, we must be strong in fighting against injustice wherever we
can. We must always keep our word, as we did those many years ago in
Korea."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Fe Depot Park, next to the train station just west of Old
Towne Plaza, has special significance for veterans, which is why it's
the site of the city's annual observance. For years, local men
departed for war at the station.</TE>
<TE>   Other Orange County observances Monday were held in Yorba Linda,
where the Camp Pendleton commander, Col. John F. Kelly, spoke at the
Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace, and in Fullerton, which hosted
its 15th annual Veterans Day parade.</TE>
<TE>   While the ceremonies honored veterans of all U.S. wars, many
emphasized the one in Korea. John Whiteriver, commander of American
Legion Post 132, which sponsored the Orange event, said the federal
government has declared the year ending July 2003 as a Korean War
anniversary observance. The armistice was signed in July 1953.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been called the forgotten war," said Orange City
Councilwoman Joanne Coontz in beginning the city's tribute. "Orange
County had 55 Korean War casualties, half of them from our city."</TE>
<TE>   Orange Assistant City Manager John Sibley, a Vietnam War veteran
with two sons in the military, also attended. "Today is especially
significant because we have men and women in harm's way," he said.
"These people know what it's like to give their all."</TE>
<TE>   Whiteriver, 70, said he finds special significance in the park's
war memorial fountain, with its inscription "Dedicated to Past,
Present and Future Veterans."</TE>
<TE>   When the monument was completed two years ago, he said, some
questioned the inclusion of the word "future." But in light of recent
events, Whiteriver said, it should be understood that "we're the
spokespeople for those who have died, and this is our remembrance of
them. There will always be future veterans -- 9/11 proved that. It's
important for us to understand that freedom is not free."</TE>

<HD>Liberal Leader for a Liberal Party</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross K. Baker</AU>
<BD>Ross K. Baker is a political science professor at
Rutgers University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is an anxiety, almost amounting to panic, that is agitating
centrist Democrats in the wake of the announcement last week by one
of their own, Texas Rep. Martin Frost, that he was conceding the race
for House minority leader to Rep. Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   The fear among these "New Democrats" is that the elevation of
Pelosi signals a dangerous lurch to the left, an embrace of
ultraliberalism that will alienate swing voters and condemn the party
for all eternity to the margins of American politics.</LD>
<LD>   The almost certain selection of Pelosi on Thursday when the caucus
convenes should occasion no shudders of dread in the heart of any
Democrat. Pelosi's ascension to the chairmanship merely confirms a
well-recognized fact: Liberals dominate the Democratic Party in the
House and have for some time.</LD>
<TE>   What is more, if Pelosi were not a liberal when she first aspired
to the job, she would quickly have had to become one.</TE>
<TE>   As in the case of their GOP counterparts in the House, the
Democrats' center of ideological gravity has moved decisively away
from the center. Centrist Democrats, like moderate Republicans, are
something of a curiosity in a chamber in which sharply edged
doctrinal lines have supplanted the broader demilitarized zone of
past years, when there was an abundance of members ready to cut a
deal or strike a compromise.</TE>
<TE>   We can trace the rise in ideological polarization in the various
individuals who have held leadership positions in Congress in recent
years. The rise of Newt Gingrich to the speakership on the GOP side
is the most prominent example, but the Democrats who have gained
leadership positions, though milder in manner than the fiery
Gingrich, are no less partisan and only slightly less ideological.</TE>
<TE>   In his years in the House, the outgoing Democratic leader, Rep.
Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, evolved from voting scores of 35% by
the liberal Americans for Democratic Action in 1978 to 75% in 1988 to
100% in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   His evolution might be seen as the reverse of the usual
philosophical life cycle in which youthful liberalism gives way to
midlife conservatism. Viewed less charitably, it represents the
gradual adaptation of an ambitious moderate Democrat with designs on
leadership of a party growing markedly more liberal.</TE>
<TE>   Pelosi does not have to make this protracted political pilgrimage.
She racked up a 100% ADA score as a freshman in 1988, and that's
where she stands today.</TE>
<TE>   Honest Democrats can disagree about whether the party should steer
a centrist course in the hope of being more attractive to
middle-of-the-road voters or devote itself to the party's core of
very liberal voters -- African Americans and union members, for
example -- but what no one can deny is that the left is dominant in
the House. This group advocates "energizing the party's base" by
stressing such issues as national health, raising the minimum wage
and tempering welfare reform.</TE>
<TE>   The New Democrat faction that was in ascendancy during the Clinton
years has been deeply troubled since the defeat of Al Gore in the
2000 election. They have seized on any evidence of a leftward turn to
sound the alarm that the Democrats are marching into a political
cul-de-sac. Even Gore, the designated heir to Clinton, was faulted by
these party centrists for conducting his presidential campaign with
the verbal weapons of "class warfare," an inflammatory term designed
to conjure up images of Leon Trotsky or Che Guevara haranguing sullen
proletarians. So while Gephardt evolved into a recognizable liberal
in the manner of his predecessors Jim Wright and Thomas P. "Tip"
O'Neill, so Pelosi will come to office already garlanded with laurels
from every liberal group from the League of Conservation Voters to
the public employees unions.</TE>
<TE>   But what makes her role as party leader especially ominous to the
New Democrats is her constituency, San Francisco, with its louche
politics and unconventional lifestyles. They fear the kind of scorn
visited on the party by Ambassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick at the GOP
convention in 1984 when she sneeringly referred to "the San Francisco
Democrats."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the House Democrats are not all there is to the
Democratic Party, but even in the Senate a sizable number of
Democrats could answer to "liberal" or its more politically correct
synonym, "progressive."</TE>
<TE>   And despite the lamentations of Democratic centrists that Pelosi
represents something ominous, the party's likely new leader in the
House is as authentic a representative as anyone of where the
Democratic Party stands.</TE>

<HD>A Lower Profile Would Make the United States a Smaller
Target</HD>
<DH>Other nations can cope with some regional flare-ups.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Layne and Benjamin Schwarz</AU>
<BD>Christopher Layne is a visiting fellow in foreign
policy studies at the Cato Institute. Benjamin Schwarz is the
literary editor of the Atlantic Monthly.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration's recently enunciated National Security
Strategy revolves around maintaining or augmenting America's
overwhelming military, economic and political preponderance. But the
United States needs to come to grips with an ironic possibility: The
very preponderance of power may now make us not more secure but less
so, and a diminished global presence might actually achieve more of
our ultimate foreign policy goals.</LD>
<LD>   Hegemony is a seductive goal. In the abstract, it makes sense that
the U.S. should seek to amass as much power as possible to enjoy
something close to absolute security. But as history shows, hegemonic
empires almost automatically elicit universal resistance, which is
why all such aspirants have eventually exhausted themselves.</LD>
<LD>   So instead of the Bush doctrine -- which is a prescription for
hegemony -- how about an alternative: offshore balancing? Whereas the
Bush doctrine opposes the rise of new power centers in international
politics, an offshore balancing strategy is predicated on the
inevitability of their emergence and turns this to U.S. advantage.</LD>
<TE>   Offshore balancing would rely on a balance among many states to
maintain U.S. security. All the potential great powers -- Germany or
the European Union, China, Russia, India, Japan -- are in
neighborhoods populated by other would-be powers or dangerous
regional foes. In contrast to a world dominated by the United States,
in which the U.S. is a magnet for others' resentments, a multipolar
world would deflect others' attention toward threats nearer to home.
Self-imposed U.S. restraint would further negate others' incentives
to balance against American power.</TE>
<TE>   Offshore balancing is based on burden shifting, not burden
sharing. It would transform the U.S. from a regional stabilizer into
a balancer of last resort by passing to others the primary
responsibility for maintaining regional power balances and
stabilizing Europe, East Asia and the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   An offshore balancer can afford to be a bystander in the opening
stages of conflicts. Because others' security is more immediately at
risk, it makes more sense to let them take the first crack at dealing
with trouble-making states. Usually they will do so promptly and
successfully. If they do not, an offshore balancer can always step in
to defeat an aggressor.</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing the legitimacy of other great powers' spheres of
influence offers potential strategic advantages to the U.S. For
example, the difficulties that Washington has encountered in trying
to stabilize Afghanistan are just a foretaste of what the U.S. will
face if it has to occupy a defeated Iraq. Yet all the potential great
powers have their own strategic concerns with oil and Islam in the
Persian Gulf and Central Asia.</TE>
<TE>   If the U.S. passed the buck, these powers would have no choice but
to take on the burdens of pacifying those regions because their
security and economic interests were greater. And better them than
us.</TE>
<TE>   By abandoning the Bush doctrine's extravagant geopolitical
objectives, the U.S. can minimize the risk of open confrontation with
the new great powers. And only by forsaking hegemony's temptations
can the U.S. hope to enjoy respectful and cooperative relations with
them.</TE>

<HD>From a Power Crisis to a Crisis of Power</HD>
<DH>PUC decisions by Davis appointees are costing the state's
taxpayers billions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Harvey Rosenfield</AU>
<BD>Harvey Rosenfield is president of the Santa
Monica-based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. Web
address: www.consumerwatchdog.org.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Public Utilities Commission stole $7.5 billion from California
consumers last week.</LD>
<LD>   The money will be used to bail out both utility companies and big
businesses from their losses during the energy debacle. The
deregulation rip-off already has cost Californians $70 billion; we
cannot allow the public officials responsible for this latest
thievery to get away with it.</LD>
<LD>   The 1996 deregulation law, sponsored by Southern California
Edison, forbids the $5-billion-a-year utility bailout that the PUC
approved last Thursday. Utilities reaped $20 billion in profits
during the first two years of deregulation. But when Enron and other
energy wholesalers created phony shortages to jack up the price of
electricity in 2000, a rate freeze in the law prevented the state's
utility companies from passing the higher charges on to customers.</LD>
<TE>   Pacific Gas &amp; Electric declared bankruptcy, but Edison recruited
Gov. Gray Davis to back bailout legislation. Unwilling to cross
incensed voters, legislators refused to pass it. So the PUC,
controlled by Davis appointees, authorized the bailout itself. The
agency announced in October 2001 that it had secretly negotiated a
$3-billion bailout with Edison. PG&amp;E's creditors were offered the
same terms.</TE>
<TE>   Six weeks ago, however, a federal court of appeals ruled that the
Edison deal violated the deregulation law, the state Constitution and
open-government laws. It sent the case to the California Supreme
Court -- which had previously refused to hear a challenge to the
PUC's conduct -- suggesting that the California court might want to
review the matter after all. Last week's PUC decision brazenly
ignored the federal court ruling.</TE>
<TE>   The same contempt for state law and consumers is behind the PUC's
separate order forcing residential ratepayers to subsidize the greed
of the largest users of electricity. These corporations backed
deregulation so they could negotiate cheaper energy prices from
wholesale suppliers. But when wholesale prices soared, the companies
ran back to the utilities, whose frozen rates were lower.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Davis capitulated to blackout blackmail and signed $43
billion in long-term contracts, locking the state into exorbitant
rates for up to two decades. The "shortages" instantly disappeared,
and wholesale prices fell. The big users scurried back to the
wholesalers. The Legislature ordered the PUC to ensure the big users
paid for the $3 billion in energy that Davis had purchased on their
behalf.</TE>
<TE>   But on Thursday, the PUC let them off for $500 million. Small
ratepayers will pay the balance. Commissioner Jeff Brown, a Davis
appointee, said making the companies pay more would send "a terrible
signal to the business community."</TE>
<TE>   What about the signal the voters sent last Tuesday when Davis
barely got reelected because of his handling of the energy crisis and
when pro-deregulation candidates, mostly Republicans, consistently
lost?</TE>
<TE>   If our democracy was in working order, the PUC's conduct would
never be tolerated. Davis would withdraw his appointment of former
Edison President Michael Peevey and choose true consumer advocates
rather than cronies to fill that and a coming vacancy on the PUC.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Davis' effort to distance himself from the agency, it is
his agenda that the PUC is loyally carrying out. It's no accident
that the PUC waited until after the election to strike.</TE>
<TE>   Davis could also cancel the long-term energy contracts on grounds
of fraud and seize control of the wholesale power plants that
perpetrated the energy rip-off, saving billions and blocking future
machinations. But such bold leadership would offend big business.</TE>
<TE>   State legislators ought to be convening hearings on whether the
five commissioners should be impeached for deliberately violating
state laws. They should order commercial and industrial energy users
to pay their fair share. But like Davis, lawmakers are happy to have
the PUC making decisions that benefit their benefactors without
having to cast a vote themselves that might anger the public.</TE>
<TE>   In the short run, Californians will have to rely on the state
Supreme Court to enforce state laws and invalidate the Edison deal.
Since Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer initially filed a court document
opining that the bailout was legal, consumer advocates may end up
with the responsibility for protecting the public in court. Victory
there would result in billions of dollars in refunds, triggering
another bailout battle in the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   If our public officials do not protect us, we'll have to take
matters into our own hands with a ballot initiative to reverse the
bailouts, order refunds and create an elected utilities commission
whose members would have personal liability for failure to obey the
law. Deregulation has proved to be a license to steal. One way or the
other, we are going to get our money back.</TE>

<LD>It's show time! Time for the Republican Party to deliver on decades
of big promises to the true believers: Ban abortions! Renew family
values! Win the drug war! Slash taxes! Just remember, guys, no more
excuses about Democrats obstructing the GOP platform. Your bluff has
been called.</LD>
<LD>   It is tempting for the Republicans to keep coasting on the wave of
wartime popularity even though they now control both halls of
Congress, but that tactic is risky, as the failure of the first Bush
presidency attests. Foreign policy is an unpredictable business --
don't look now, but Muslim fundamentalists have won in Pakistan,
Afghanistan is ungovernable and the U.S. march to war against Iraq to
distract from the failure to smash Al Qaeda is mired in U.N.
diplomacy.</LD>
<LD>   Not even another stunning victory over Saddam Hussein will be
sufficient to ensure reelection for Bush if the economy is in the
doldrums, if the national debt accelerates and if the Christian right
is again frustrated in its relentless quest to ban abortions.</LD>
<TE>   The president and his party are now wholly responsible for
stewardship of the American economy. Their fate two years from now
will hang mostly on hard numbers: how many of us are unemployed and
what remains of our 401Ks.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Bush's key palliative for the stagnant economy, the tax cut,
has failed miserably as a stimulus and instead has contributed to a
sharply rising national debt.</TE>
<TE>   Combine that with the spiraling cost of throwing money at any
program with the vaguest connection to national security and it seems
clear that red ink will flow heavily from here to the next election.</TE>
<TE>   And don't expect Joe and Jane Middle Class to rescue Wall Street.
The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department --
trying to please a White House run by old corporate con artists --
are stumbling over themselves to avoid responsibility for policing
publicly held companies.</TE>
<TE>   It might take a decade or two before regular folks forget how they
learned painfully anew that gambling, whether on stocks or craps,
always brings out the sharks.</TE>
<TE>   Big business bet heavily on the Republicans in this election in
order to block any attempts to bring more CEOs to justice. Better to
distract the public from the ugly side of deregulation by beating the
patriotic war drums and indulging the rhetoric of the Christian right
by pretending to restore family values.</TE>
<TE>   On the latter front, the GOP's moment of truth may have finally
arrived -- the mere pretense of commitment to an extremist social
agenda may no longer be enough for anti-abortion voters. Controlling
all branches of the federal government, Bush &amp; Co. is going to be
under the gun to actually ban abortions, something the GOP has boldly
pledged for decades.</TE>
<TE>   The social conservatives in the party provided the foot soldiers
in the midterm election, and they will now demand concrete victories,
beginning with a right-wing makeover of the judiciary. Bush already
has announced that he will resubmit the list of conservative federal
judicial appointees stalled in the last Senate. And with the
relatively moderate Sandra Day O'Connor the most likely to step down,
Bush has promised to appoint an anti-choice Antonin Scalia clone to
solidify right-wing dominance of the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Under such leadership, the highest court in the land would be
likely to strike down Roe vs. Wade. But the mere thought of this
long-sought "victory" makes the GOP's political pros squirm: To go
back to the days when abortion was illegal and women routinely died
as a result of self-inflicted coat-hanger wounds is hardly a
prescription for future Republican victories.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP has long blamed Democratic control of one or both houses
of Congress for its failure to act on a radical agenda that is not
supported by most Americans. This, in fact, is the disaster that
befell the "Gingrich Revolution."</TE>
<TE>   There is another choice for Bush, however. He could lead his party
back to its roots. That Republican Party was suspicious of foreign
entanglements, vigorously in favor of population control and civil
rights and -- while certainly pro-big business -- was committed to
stewardship of the nation's resources and the integrity of economic
instruments such as the stock market.</TE>
<TE>   Such a turn toward core American values would make Bush a serious
leader. Unfortunately, he seems to have mastered the tongue of the
demagogue and too much enjoys the victories that slick words and
tough talk afford to consider charting the more moderate path
Americans seek.</TE>

<LD>Winona Ryder will not be sentenced to jail, according to the
prosecutor of her theft case, Deputy Dist. Atty. Ann Rundle ("Ryder
Found Guilty in Shoplifting Case," Nov. 7). I work as a chaplain in a
jail and know the difficulties women face in this environment. I am
happy that Ryder does not have to endure the humiliation. How is it,
though, that a celebrity who is found guilty of stealing $5,500
serves no jail sentence, while the economically poor women I meet
each day, who have often stolen much less to feed or clothe their
children, must serve unduly long sentences? They may serve as long as
six months, or even go to prison, leaving behind their children to
the system if there is no one to care for them.</LD>
<LD>   It amazes me that we put so much emphasis on helping poor women
and children in other countries while poor or homeless women in our
own city must resort to desperate measures for survival and then be
punished for doing so. I hope that Ryder will be assigned to some of
our women's shelters to see for herself the abused, abandoned,
hungry, poor women and children. Perhaps her celebrity status will
aid in advancing liberty and justice for all.</LD>

<TE>   The Ryder case is arguably the most over-prosecuted case in
history. If she had not been a celebrity, the prosecution would have
plea-bargained it to a misdemeanor because she had no prior criminal
history. And it has been reported that Rundle gave up a murder case
to pursue this one (Oct. 23). It seems obvious to me that the only
reason this case went to trial, as a felony, is because Rundle wanted
her 15 minutes of fame.</TE>

<TE>   There was a notable actress who lived in a town (that we moved
from) who was a darling ... and a kleptomaniac. She made several
popular movies and everyone liked her. When her little problem
started, her people, her family, someone went to the local stores to
explain and assured them that the stolen items would be returned or
paid for. Just give a call and it would be rectified right away.
There was no shouting "shame" or media feast, no waste of money for a
public prosecutor, a judge or a jury for something that we all know
is an illness. Must we continually slide backward?</TE>

<LD>Re "Iraq Studies 'Bad and Unjust' U.N. Resolution," Nov. 10: Why was
Saddam Hussein given seven days to decide if he intends to comply
with the U.N. resolution? As I have come to understand such matters,
varmints are given 24-hour ultimatums. Sometimes, come to think of
it, they only have until sundown to do the right thing. Seven days?
In case it has slipped everyone's mind, the man is a ruthless tyrant.
So, who's he going to discuss things with for an entire week? His

<TE>   Re "A Landslide Loss for Hussein," Commentary, Nov. 7: Contrary to
James Pinkerton's belief that the election guarantees an attack on
Iraq, I suspect the reverse is true. I'm betting the whole issue will
fade away during the next few months because it has served its
purpose. Hussein won't be taken off the shelf again until the
election of 2004, if, as I suspect, the abysmal Bush failures
continue to mount.</TE>

if only on A20. I can understand that the prisoners would need to be
restrained, but I fail to understand why they were not seated in
proper chairs, or at least leaning against the side of the plane, and
were instead barely supported by ropes around their chests and backs.
I also fail to understand why their heads were covered, inside an
empty cargo plane, for a flight halfway around the world. This was
cruel, uncivilized and unbecoming the richest and most powerful
country in the world.</LD>

<LD>Re "No Olive Branches in the Grove," Nov. 7: As a Southern
Californian peace activist accompanying Palestinian families during
their olive harvest, I have witnessed the fear that farmers
experience while attempting to reach their land and the Israeli
army's and police's failure to intervene on behalf of Palestinians
confronted by settler violence. Police spokesman Gil Kleinman claims
that no distinctions are made between Palestinian and Israeli
lawbreakers and that Israeli settlers are arrested if they break the
law. However, we must remember that settlements are in violation of
the Fourth Geneva Convention, and thus all settlers in the West Bank
are essentially breaking the law.</LD>
<LD>   The violent acts of Israeli settlers upon Palestinians peacefully
attempting to harvest their land are yet another layer of criminal
activity largely ignored by both Israelis and the international
community.</LD>

absurd when Arabs regularly blow up bars, cafes, discos, buses and
malls filled with innocent civilians. That is "in your face."</TE>

<LD>   If these appointments are confirmed, we will not have a Supreme
Court but a pope and a council of bishops. The right of a woman to

<HD>Judge Delays Hearing on Extradition of SLA Fugitive</HD>
<DH>James W. Kilgore appears in a South Africa courtroom filled
with supporters as his attorney negotiates on plea.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gorrel Espelund and Eric Bailey</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL>CAPE TOWN, South Africa</DL>
<LD>After a quarter-century spent dodging a dark past, James W. Kilgore
appeared in a courtroom Monday as U.S. authorities sought his return
to face charges from his days with the radical Symbionese Liberation
Army.</LD>
<LD>   Kilgore, 55 and balding, smiled and gave a thumbs-up to weepy and
applauding supporters, who knew him as C.W. "John" Pape during his
stint as a senior researcher at the University of Cape Town.</LD>
<LD>   "He is well, he is healthy and he is strong and bearing up,"
Michael Evans, Kilgore's lawyer, said after the hearing.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. officials are seeking Kilgore's extradition on pipe-bomb
charges and accusations of participating in a 1975 Sacramento bank
robbery and slaying with the SLA, the violent anti-government group
best known for kidnapping newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst.</TE>
<TE>   A judge put off the extradition hearing until Friday so Kilgore's
New York attorney could continue plea bargain negotiations with
federal officials on the explosives case. County prosecutors in
Sacramento appear to be set to offer Kilgore a six-year sentence in a
deal similar to the ones two other SLA members got last week. They
pleaded guilty in the murder.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Kilgore's lawyers in South Africa are waiting to
review the formal extradition request from the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "By Friday, things will be much clearer," Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   He refused to discuss whether Kilgore's family was aware of his
past with the SLA.</TE>
<TE>   Terri Barnes, Kilgore's wife, tearfully hugged her husband as he
emerged from the holding cells beneath the courtroom. One spectator
called out: "Viva John!"</TE>
<TE>   After the brief appearance, Kilgore left the courtroom as he had
entered it -- to applause from dozens of supporters. Kilgore will
remain in custody at Bellville police station.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys who represented the other SLA members said
Kilgore was ready to turn himself in last Friday when South African
police made the arrest, one day after the other SLA defendants
pleaded guilty in the killing of Myrna Opsahl.</TE>
<TE>   "My understanding is, he was ready, willing and able to surrender
on his own, and was in the process of purchasing plane tickets," said
Charles Bourdon, a San Francisco defense attorney. "The irony is, if
they had left it alone, he probably would have been in federal
custody in San Francisco today."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, U.S. officials will have to pursue the more cumbersome
route of filing a formal extradition request. One defense attorney
said the process -- an arcane, formal effort that must meander
through multiple agencies in both countries -- could take three to
eight weeks.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. Embassy spokesman, Brian Penn, said an extradition
application for Kilgore was being prepared in the United States and
would be sent to South Africa after being checked by the Justice and
State Departments.</TE>
<TE>   One initial obstacle was concern in South Africa that Kilgore
might face the death penalty, which is banned under Pretoria's
constitution. But U.S. officials have assured their South African
counterparts that Kilgore is not charged with a capital offense.</TE>
<TE>   A police spokeswoman, Mary Martins-Engelbrecht, said Kilgore had
been arrested by South Africa's Interpol unit after more than a week
of surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   "The Americans sent us pictures and a fingerprint, which we
matched before approaching him," she said. "We had to have proof of
who he was before we alerted him or he could have left the country
with us unable to stop him."</TE>
<TE>   Martins-Engelbrecht said police had acquired Kilgore's
fingerprints to match against the sample sent from the United States.
She declined to say how.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials, likewise, wouldn't go into detail about how they
had found Kilgore, who had been out of sight for decades. They
chalked it up to hard gumshoe efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors, colleagues and friends expressed shock over the arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing I can say is that John Pape was a good man," said
Uta Lehmann, who questioned why someone could still be held
responsible for crimes committed 27 years ago. "Times have changed,
but it's not for me to decide. I am very worried about his wife and
children."</TE>
<TE>   Kilgore lived in Claremont, a middle-class suburb. The family's
home, on a narrow street that ends in a cul-de-sac, is well kept, a
cream-colored single-story house behind a wooden fence. Kilgore had
lived there five years with his wife and two boys, ages 12 and 10.</TE>
<TE>   Friends said he used to go bicycling a lot and played soccer and
cricket with his boys.</TE>
<TE>   Kilgore's wife, also an American, is a history instructor at the
University of Western Cape. Kilgore was employed, under his South
African pseudonym, on a yearly contract basis as a senior researcher
at the International Labour Resource and Information Group at the
University of Cape Town.</TE>
<TE>   Shireen Sedres, a university spokeswoman, said colleagues had been
shocked when they learned of Kilgore's past.</TE>
<TE>   "People were stunned and saddened," Sedres said. "His reputation
was that of an outstanding researcher and a warm individual."</TE>
<TE>   An instructor at the university since 1998, he had a doctorate in
labor relations and arrived with high references from Khanya College
in Johannesburg.</TE>
<TE>   Before that, police said, he spent several years in Zimbabwe. The
local Cape Argus newspaper reported that Kilgore had said in a
research paper that he lived in Zimbabwe "through most of the '80s."</TE>
<TE>   Marcus Solomon, a former colleague, described the fugitive as a
caring and thoughtful person, widely read and deeply committed to the
community, the poor and his family.</TE>
<TE>   "He was always very concerned about his boys. He was active in the
school and he was a wonderful father," Solomon said. "A very
together, disciplined person with a good sense of humor."</TE>
<TE>   In Cape Town, Kilgore was also involved with the Congress of South
Africa Trade Unions and had recently written a manual for the
organization on globalization.</TE>
<TE>   "He was someone who contributed to South African society," said
Tony Ehrenreich, a union leader in Cape Town. "Social justice was
uppermost in his mind."</TE>
<TE>   His arrest came a few months after Kilgore and a Canadian coauthor
published a book outlining the inequities for the poor of the
government's budget proposals.</TE>

<HD>Actors Give War Games a Touch of Realism</HD>
<DH>A cast of 40 local people is hired to portray the angry
citizens of an Arab town protesting the arrival of a force of U.S.
soldiers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>VICTORVILLE</DL>
<LD>Forty actors drafted to portray protesters shouted "Go home USA!" in
a mock confrontation with 350 soldiers descending on a fictitious
Arab town, a scene troops could face in a war with Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   The Army's 1-14th Cavalry Squadron, based at Ft. Lewis, Wash., was
training Friday for urban warfare at the Southern California
Logistics Airport.</LD>
<LD>   The mission was to keep peace and purge a terrorist cell.</LD>
<TE>   About 40 civilian actors gathered by a local casting company were
paid to play citizens whose mood about the Americans ranged from
eagerness to please to hostility.</TE>
<TE>   The scene was played out in the abandoned housing area of the
former George Air Force Base.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers were on the lookout for snipers.</TE>
<TE>   "One man with a rifle can have a devastating effect on our
troops," Lt. Col. Jim Cashwell said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all the technology, the training centered on soldiers'
interaction with people.</TE>
<TE>   During the protest, an actress ran into the street and fell
between the soldiers and the mock protesters.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the conflict of the future," Cashwell said.</TE>
<TE>   Before the mock protest, an unpiloted military aircraft planned
for use during the urban warfare exercise crashed into an unoccupied
airport building.</TE>
<TE>   The 9-foot-long Shadow 200 drone, worth $350,000, crashed as it
was taking off about 8:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "This was just an unfortunate accident," said Maj. Joseph Shannon,
who is based at Ft. Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   Shannon said four other Shadow 200s were available for their urban
warfare training. The training program is to end this week.</TE>
<TE>   Shannon said the cause of the crash was under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   In battle situations, the Shadow 200 flies ahead of soldiers to
detect enemy troops, tanks or other hostile forces or units, Shannon
said.</TE>
<TE>   It relays that information via live video or radio back to field
commanders.</TE>

<HD>3 Killed, 2 Hurt in Crashes on Freeway Near Banning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three people were killed early Monday in crashes on opposite sides of
Interstate 10 near Banning that backed up traffic for hours,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The first crash, on eastbound I-10 about 12:40 a.m., involved a
minivan that apparently missed the exit to Casino Morongo, about 85
miles east of L.A.</LD>
<LD>   The van, trying to back up to the off-ramp, was rear-ended by a
tractor-trailer rig, the California Highway Patrol said. Two people
in the van were killed and two injured, the CHP said. The truck
driver was not hurt.</LD>
<TE>   The identities of those killed were not immediately released.</TE>
<TE>   A passenger, Jung Gi Soon, 58, of Los Angeles, suffered broken
legs, a broken pelvis and a broken left arm, while another, Won Yong
Jung, 43, of Los Angeles, suffered cuts to the head.</TE>
<TE>   As paramedic helicopters landed on both sides of the highway to
transport the injured, traffic came to a halt. That triggered an
accident on the westbound side, the CHP said, when a tractor-trailer
rear-ended a truck, knocking it into another big rig.</TE>
<TE>   The driver of the first big rig was killed when his vehicle burst
into flames.</TE>
<TE>   People in the other vehicles weren't hurt.</TE>

<LD>Monterey County officials are hoping to provide affordable housing
and homes for foster children with a new program initiated this
month.</LD>
<LD>   Under the program, the county has decided to help find homes for
families that are willing to take in foster children on short notice.</LD>
<LD>   The county's initial plan, approved last week, calls for advocates
to raise $550,000 to buy two $225,000 homes. The homes would be
leased to foster parents willing to take in children who need
immediate placement.</LD>
<TE>   In return, a portion of the rent would go into an escrow account
to be used on a down payment three years later. The program is backed
by the county and the private Charitable Council.</TE>
<TE>   "Many counties are looking at better incentive programs, but this
is one of the best ideas to come along," said Will Lightbourne,
executive vice president of the County Welfare Directors Assn. of
California.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Researchers are trying to determine whether there's a link between
runoff waters and the deaths of sea otters along the Central Coast.</LD>
<LD>   The state Water Resources Control Board recently approved nearly
$500,000 to find out whether polluted runoff is killing sea otters
from Half Moon Bay to Santa Barbara.</LD>
<LD>   There are now about 2,300 otters. Their numbers have thinned
because of a high death rate from disease.</LD>
<TE>   "It's just a really interesting puzzle -- what is going on with
otters -- because they are a sentinel species," said Karen Worcester,
who is administering the grant through the Central Coast Regional
Water Quality Control Board in San Luis Obispo. "They are at the top
of the food chain, and they are voracious eaters."</TE>

<LD>Water from San Francisco Bay, minus the salt, could be pouring from
taps in Marin County, where the early steps for a desalination plant
are being taken.</LD>
<LD>   The Marin Municipal Water District voted 3-2 last week to pay
$69,000 to URS Corp. for initial planning and environmental services
linked to a desalination plant.</LD>
<LD>   Two board members, John Jaeger and Dick Hill, voted against the
plan, but Jared Huffman, Alex Forman and Jack Gibson approved it.</LD>
<TE>   Huffman said a plant could be running in the next two to five
years.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a boundless resource," Huffman said last week, as he spoke
to members of the Marin Environmental Forum.</TE>
<TE>   Jaeger, who also spoke to the group, criticized the move.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you want a mom-and-pop operation like [Marin Municipal Water
District] trying to perfect this?" he asked. "Let others do it."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Residents who want to light up their old fireplaces will have to
check with regional air quality officials first under new rules that
go into effect next year.</LD>
<LD>   The voluntary "Don't Light Tonight" no-burn nights on bad air days
will become mandatory next year to cut down on dust and soot, air
quality officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The San Joaquin Valley is one of the dirtiest air basins in the
country.</LD>
<TE>   And air district spokeswoman, Josette Merced Bello, said old
wood-burning fireplaces and stoves with no emissions controls could
be shut down for as many as 20 days during the season. Homes that

officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Also next year, residents who want to sell a home with an old
masonry fireplace will need to convert it to natural gas, buy a
government-certified insert that cuts airborne soot or brick it up,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 500,000 homes in the valley have old wood-burning
stoves and fireplaces.</TE>

<HD>Baseball's New Issue: Child Endangerment</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TUCSON</DL>
<LD>So, what happens when major league general managers pause from the
trade and free-agent talks that always tend to dominate their annual
meeting?</LD>
<LD>   What does the official business agenda look like?</LD>
<LD>   Well, among the complex and critical industry issues to be
reviewed today is the subject of ... batboys -- and can it get any
more complex and critical?</LD>
<TE>   After all, it was almost a matter of life and death in Game 5 of
the World Series when J.T. Snow of the San Francisco Giants lifted
Manager Dusty Baker's 3-year-old son, Darren, out of harm's way as
teammate David Bell bore down on the plate and the unaware youngster
blithely retrieved Kenny Lofton's bat.</TE>
<TE>   Snow's save was captured nationally in words and pictures, put
focus on the day-care center that operated out of the Giant dugout
and prompted baseball officials to recognize the risk involved
without a minimum age requirement for batboys.</TE>
<TE>   "This may sound naive, but I was shocked to find out Darren was
only 3 1/2 years old," Sandy Alderson said Monday. "I just thought he
was short for his age."</TE>
<TE>   As baseball's executive vice president of operations, Alderson
said he will seek feedback from the general managers today, part of a
process in which baseball is investigating state and federal laws,
evaluating the insurance aspect and reviewing the past practices of
each team.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to do something arbitrarily, but we clearly need a
rule that addresses the problem," he said, adding that Commissioner
Bud Selig will review the findings and issue an age directive before
spring training begins.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball has a rule that limits clubs to two batboys in the
dugout, but it is not uniformly enforced, and the issue of age is
left to the discretion of each club.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids and baseball have a deep relationship," Alderson said. "On
the other hand, we have to balance that with the need for safety,
compliance with state and federal laws and a standard of
reasonableness. There needs to be limits. There needs to be a minimum
age."</TE>
<TE>   Alderson conceded that as general manager of the Oakland A's in
the 1980s and '90s, players' sons were allowed on the field at times.</TE>
<TE>   "But were they three years of age?" he said. "No. Were they
required to leave the field at a particular time? Yes. Were they
allowed in the dugout during the game? No. There are certainly ways
the father-son relationship can be accommodated, which at the same
time preserves a safe environment."</TE>
<TE>   Whether Dusty and Darren Baker represent a potential tandem hire
for the Chicago Cubs in their contract negotiations is uncertain.
Alderson insisted that the age issue would have been addressed even
if it hadn't been for the Game 5 incident, but "when you have
literally a Baker's dozen batboys in the dugout, it stands to reason
that somebody is going to notice."</TE>

<LD>Randy Galloway in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, commenting on the
Dallas Cowboys: "Jerry Jones is the owner of a football team that has
lost 28 games, and counting, in 2 1/2 seasons.</LD>
<LD>   "There are those of us who think Jerry has a management problem.
Actually, allow me to rephrase that. There are those of us who think
Jerry is the management problem.</LD>
<LD>   " 'I do take the blame,' answered Mr. Jones last week at Valley
Ranch. This was a manly response. Except ... Jerry, if you blame
yourself, why don't you do something about yourself? ...</LD>
<TE>   " 'I like our direction,' Jerry answered.</TE>
<TE>   "God help us all."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds UCLA's single-season record for touchdowns?</TE>
<TE>   Bang, bang it hurts: Mike Kuykendall, Oregon State tackle, to the
Corvallis Gazette after the Beavers -- favored to win in Seattle
against Washington for the first time in more than three decades --
lost to the Huskies because of numerous penalties and interceptions:</TE>
<TE>   "We ran out of feet to shoot. We shot ourselves in the toes."</TE>
<TE>   Returning the favor: Ron Cey was among a number of former Dodgers
at the grand opening of a Big League Dreams sports complex in Chino
Hills last week. So was Bill Sharman, who played for the Brooklyn
Dodgers in the 1950s while also playing for the Boston Celtics.</TE>
<TE>   Cey told Sharman he was 8 years old when Sharman and some members
of the NBA champion Celtics came through Tacoma, Wash., for an
exhibition game.</TE>
<TE>   "You're the first person I ever asked for an autograph," Cey said.
Said Sharman: "Now it's my turn. How about giving me your autograph?"</TE>
<TE>   Bearing-up: Rick Morrissey in the Chicago Tribune: "The Bears'
season has gone from depressing to confusing. So yeah, we're talking
progress here.</TE>
<TE>   "After Sunday's loss [to the New England Patriots], the defensive
coordinator said he didn't need me second-guessing him. The Bears
blew a three-touchdown lead for their seventh straight loss, and
someone got a bad case of Brain-lache during crunch time, not that
I'm naming names."</TE>
<TE>   No, of course not. The defensive coordinator is Greg Blache.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1932, USC defeated Oregon at the
Coliseum, 33-0. The Trojans went on to win the national championship,
beating Pittsburgh in the Rose Bowl game, 35-0.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Skip Hicks, 26, in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Adrian Wojnarowski in the New Jersey Record: "Army
lost, 49-30, to Air Force on Saturday, the Black Knights dropping to
0-9 on the season, No. 117 out of 117 Division I-A teams, solidifying
their standing as the worst of the worst....</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, this is West Point. These were the classrooms and training
grounds for Douglas MacArthur and George Patton and Dwight
Eisenhower. This is the football program that inspired General George
Marshall to declare during World War II: 'I want an officer for a
secret and dangerous mission. I want a West Point football player.'</TE>
<TE>   "He would want one of these kids today too for his mission, as
long as it doesn't include beating Holy Cross, because Army couldn't
even do that this year."</TE>

<HD>Raiders Aren't Done Yet</HD>
<DH>Oakland's 34-10 victory at Denver ends losing streak and
gives playoff chances a boost.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Score one for the old guys.</LD>
<LD>   OK, the Silver and Black has gone gray. So what?</LD>
<LD>   Three of the oldest guys on Oakland's roster proved to be the
difference Monday night, as the Raiders stunned the Broncos, 34-10,
winning at Denver for the first time since 1994 and taking a step
toward salvaging their playoff hopes.</LD>
<TE>   How fitting that this Veterans Day game was decided by three of
the NFL's most seasoned veterans -- receiver Jerry Rice, safety Rod
Woodson and quarterback Rich Gannon -- who have been in the league
for a combined 48 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with that, "Monday Night Football" is a just-launched
pilot. While ABC was celebrating its 500th broadcast, the Raiders
were toasting another number, their one-game winning streak. They won
their first four games, lost their next four, and were in serious
jeopardy of sliding into irrelevance. By beating Denver for the first
time in eight tries, they not only stayed alive in the AFC West but
got a mile-high morale boost.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed this," Raider defensive end Trace Armstrong said. "We
needed this for the season, we needed this for this organization.
We've had a long run of not playing our best here, so this is big for
us in so many ways. We really just bought ourselves one more week."</TE>
<TE>   Rice, 40, and Woodson, 37, are the team's oldest players, and both
came up with huge plays. The first came on Denver's opening drive,
when the Broncos marched to the Raider four, only to have Woodson
intercept a Brian Griese pass and return it 98 yards for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Woodson's breath puffed into the sub-freezing air like locomotive
steam as he dashed down the Denver sideline and was tackled from
behind by receiver Rod Smith just as he reached the goal line. The
two tumbled into the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just glad it wasn't 101 yards because I was out of gas,"
confessed Woodson, who has 12 interception returns for touchdowns,
more than anyone else in league history.</TE>
<TE>   The guy who knows a bit about league history is Rice, who has
collected more records than he can count. Here's one: Playing in his
40th Monday night game, No. 80 surpassed the 200-touchdown mark and
extended his consecutive-games-with-a-reception streak to 250.</TE>
<TE>   Gannon, 36, the team's fourth-oldest player, looked pretty spry
himself. He also carved out a spot in league history by completing 21
consecutive passes, a single-game record. San Francisco's Joe Montana
completed 22 in a row during the 1987 season, but that was over a
two-game stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Informed he set a record, Gannon was typically low-key.</TE>
<TE>   "Is that right?" he said. "That'll do."</TE>
<TE>   Gannon's white jersey was pristine for most of the game as his
offensive line sealed off Denver's pass rush throughout. The Broncos
sacked him once in the fourth quarter, but otherwise barely touched
him.</TE>
<TE>   It might have been Veteran's Day, but, as far as the Broncos were
concerned, it wasn't D-Day.</TE>
<TE>   "He played extremely well and took exactly what the defense gave
him," Denver Coach Mike Shanahan said of Gannon, who completed 34 of
38 passes for 352 yards with three touchdowns and an astronomical
quarterback rating of 131.6. "He's a top-notch player. I give him a
lot of credit. When we had them covered, he did a great job of
scrambling for first downs, getting out of the pocket and making some
big plays downfield."</TE>
<TE>   Two of those touchdown passes went to Rice, who finished with a
game-high nine catches for 103 yards. So masterful was Rice's
performance that fellow receiver Jerry Porter decided to wear the
legend's jersey for a TV interview. Porter, who also had a touchdown
reception in the game, later walked back out to the empty field to
soak things in one last time.</TE>
<TE>   He then patted the No. 80 on the sweat-stained jersey.</TE>
<TE>   "With 200 and 201 touchdowns, I just feel privileged to put this
on," Porter said.</TE>
<TE>   For years, the Raiders would have given the shirts off their back
for this feeling. Denver owned them at Mile High Stadium for most of
the 1990s, and Oakland's last three losses here were especially
painful.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Kenoy Kennedy intercepted a Gannon pass in the end
zone with seven seconds to play to preserve a 23-17 win.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, in the final Monday night game at Mile High
Stadium, Jason Elam kicked a 41-yard field goal on the game's final
play. The Broncos won, 27-24.</TE>
<TE>   And, in 1999, the Broncos tied the score in regulation with a
53-yard field goal by Elam, then won when Gannon fumbled in overtime
and Olandis Gary tore off a 24-yard touchdown run on the next play.</TE>
<TE>   "Tonight was big," said receiver Tim Brown, one of two current
Raiders around when the team last won in Denver. "This was a long
time coming."</TE>

<LD>   What: "Tiger vs. Jack"</LD>
<TE>   Where: The Golf Channel, tonight, 6 and 9.</TE>
<TE>   Americans enjoy debating, particularly when it comes to arguing
about who is the best at a particular sport.</TE>
<TE>   In golf, the debate is: Who ultimately will be considered the
greatest of all time, Jack Nicklaus or Tiger Woods?</TE>
<TE>   The Golf Channel, in collaboration with Golf Digest, asks that
question in this one-hour special. The question also is addressed in
an in-depth feature article by Jaime Diaz in the December issue of
Golf Digest.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz serves as co-host of the television special with Brian
Hammonds.</TE>
<TE>   Of course there is no definitive answer to the debate, but both
the television special and the magazine article are well researched
and touch all the bases. The differences between Nicklaus and Woods,
as well as their similarities, are explored.</TE>
<TE>   For the Golf Channel show, which includes plenty of highlight
footage of both golfers, more than 60 tour players, journalists and
instructors were interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   On the subject of driving length, Lee Trevino says: "Jack Nicklaus
was hitting the ball almost as far as Tiger is hitting it today.... I
wouldn't doubt if Jack could out-drive Tiger using the same
equipment."</TE>
<TE>   Says Ben Crenshaw: "[Nicklaus] was stupendously long. But it is
safe to say we have never seen the game played like Tiger."</TE>
<TE>   Of putting, Miller Barber says: "If you had a 10-foot putt and you
were going to bet your life on it, who would you ask to make it for
you? I'd ask Jack Nicklaus."</TE>

<DL>AUGUSTA, Ga.</DL>
<LD>Hootie Johnson isn't backing down.</LD>
<LD>   Augusta National Golf Club, said its 71-year-old chairman, has no
plans to admit a female member, no timetable for doing so and isn't
budging.</LD>
<LD>   The issue, he said, is resolved: "We are not altering our
position."</LD>
<TE>   Johnson pointed to the desk in his wood-paneled office, to the
five black folders stuffed with letters.</TE>
<TE>   "See that over there?" Johnson said. "Those are from people who
support our position. There are probably about 500 or so of them."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson got up from his chair, wearing the trademark green jacket
that signifies membership in golf's most exclusive club. A portrait
of Bobby Jones hung behind him on the wall of his wood-paneled
office.</TE>
<TE>   "People are sending us money, too, almost $1,000 so far, checks
from $10 to $100. We're sending it all back, of course."</TE>
<TE>   For the last five months, Johnson has been locked in a contentious
battle with the National Council of Women's Organizations over the
private club's all-male membership.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning with a letter dated June 12, when Martha Burk of the
NCWO first squared off against Johnson, Augusta National has been
under heavy pressure from women's groups and some members of the
media to admit its first female member before the 2003 Masters
tournament is played in April.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Johnson met individually with representatives of the
Los Angeles Times, Sports Illustrated, the New York Times, Augusta
Chronicle and Associated Press. The news organizations agreed not to
release their interviews until 9 p.m. PST Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who previously had refused to comment publicly, said he
felt it was important to get the word out about the club's position.</TE>
<TE>   Will there be a female member at Augusta National by the 2003
Masters? Johnson was blunt.</TE>
<TE>   "No chance," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no exclusionary policies for women as far as membership,
and I want to say right now that we are not altering our position.
There is no timetable, nothing under consideration. We have not and
will not change the way we conduct our business.</TE>
<TE>   "We have something to say and we want to be very clear. Some
people might have wanted us to pledge we would have a female member,
but we aren't saying that. There is no timetable. The club will
decide if there is a right time."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said he isn't sure if there will be demonstrators outside
the gates of the club along Washington Road during the tournament, as
Burk suggested, but he believes that this controversy might have a
limited shelf life.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's going to blow over," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It depends on the American public. I think they'll get tired of
it. I also predict that we'll have sponsors back at some point, maybe
in 2004."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said that Burk inaccurately portrayed him and the Augusta
National membership.</TE>
<TE>   "She accuses us of being insensitive bigots and discriminatory. I
don't think that's legitimate," he said. "We have a Constitutional
right to run our club and we're not taking cover behind that. We
believe it to be not only the correct way, but a most appropriate
idea.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that some people say the club should not enjoy its rights
as a private club because of the Masters tournament, its public
accommodation. I don't agree with that at all. We present one of the
great sporting events, we do a lot of good, for charities, for the
game of golf. We do a lot of good for America. People tell me it's
something to look forward to in the spring, kind of an institution.
It is an institution America can be proud of."</TE>
<TE>   There have been unconfirmed reports that Johnson was among the
doves in the club who were working to find a way to admit a female
member. Johnson quickly shot down that rumor.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not a dove," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nor, he said, is he an "insensitive bigot" or a "redneck" as
Johnson says he has been characterized.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson -- his given name is William but a playmate called him
Hootie when he was 5 and he's been Hootie ever since -- was relaxed
as he spoke, usually in short sentences, but long on message.</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not the battle is over, it has been a long and
controversial one. Burk's letter to Johnson in June urged the club to
admit a female member. She wrote, "We know that Augusta National and
the sponsors of the Masters do not want to be viewed as entities that
tolerate discrimination against any group, including women. We urge
you to open your membership to women now, so that this is not an
issue when the tournament is staged next year."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's three-sentence response on July 9 was delivered in a
letter to Burk's desk by courier at the same time Augusta National
released a strongly worded three-page statement to the media.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson wrote to Burk that he found "your letter's several
references to discrimination, allusions to sponsors and your setting
of deadlines to be both offensive and coercive."</TE>
<TE>   In his prepared statement to the media, Johnson termed Burk's
letter from the NCWO "coercive" and said Augusta National would not
be "bullied, threatened or intimidated" and that the club did not
intend to become "a trophy in their display case." Johnson also wrote
that when it came to admitting women to membership, "that timetable
will be ours and not at the point of a bayonet."</TE>
<TE>   Burk then called on CBS-TV to halt its telecasts of the Masters
(CBS President Sean McManus said no to the suggestion), asked network
sponsors to stop advertising on the air, studied the club's
membership lists looking for conflicts of interest, asked the players
to stand up for the issue, suggested the players' sponsors would be
called upon and urged PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem to withdraw
sanctioning of the Masters (Finchem rejected the suggestion).</TE>
<TE>   In another development, USA Today and the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution listed Augusta National's membership.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's only move was a controversial one. He relieved
television sponsors IBM, Coca-Cola and Citigroup of involvement in
the 2003 Masters telecast, so that, he said, they would not be caught
in the middle of the debate. That could cost Augusta National as much
as $18 million.</TE>
<TE>   It is clear that Johnson and the club membership believe they are
dealing from strength, even if Burk is correct in saying that
protesters will show up at the Masters in April.</TE>
<TE>   To measure public opinion, the club commissioned The Polling
Company and Women Trend of Washington to conduct a nationwide poll on
the issue. Results will be made public, possibly as soon as
Wednesday. One portion of the poll asked respondents if they agreed
or disagreed with this statement: "The Augusta National Golf Club was
correct in its decision not to cave in to Martha Burk's demand. They
should review and change their policies on their own time, and in
their own way."</TE>
<TE>   The findings showed that 73% of women polled and 72% of men in the
survey agreed.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the letters and the contributions keep coming in to
Augusta National and landing on Johnson's desk, filling up more
folders.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said he will make no further comments on the subject and
will not entertain any questions on membership at his annual news
conference the week of the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said if a vote were taken today among Augusta National
members, the result would be "99%" in support of the club's
membership arrangement. He also said he has been disappointed at
times by media coverage of the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "What's been disappointing to me ... I mean, this woman accuses us
of being rednecks, of being bigots and the press that really doesn't
know us jumped on that and that's all that's been written about.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say those people that know us have been fair. But nobody
has really talked about the other side of this thing, about the
private club issue, about the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, the Junior
League, Smith College, that we are a private institution and we have
a Constitutional right.</TE>
<TE>   "But not only do we have a right, but it must be the right thing
to do because all these other people are doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson forcefully rejected the notion that PGA Tour pros and
other professionals in the field should have a say in the membership
issue.</TE>
<TE>   "The players should be glad that we put on a Masters tournament,"
he said. "We think it is a great sporting event, one that is watched
by 150 million people around the world. We hope [the players] come,
we hope they enjoy it, but what we do with our membership should be
of no concern to them. They can choose to come or not to come. That
is their say."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his assertion that the issue is now resolved, the reality
is that it's probably far from it. However, Johnson said, "We know
how to handle our business."</TE>
<TE>   The club is ready for whatever is next, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pretty tough. We have our convictions, and they last long
term."</TE>

<HD>It's Unanimous, Bonds Deserves a High-Five</HD>
<DH>He receives every first-place vote and wins an
unprecedented fifth National League MVP award. Green is fifth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even though his season is over, even though he is half a world away,
Barry Bonds continues to make baseball history.</LD>
<LD>   In Japan for a barnstorming tour, the San Francisco Giant left
fielder was voted the National League's most valuable player Monday
for a record fifth time, extending his own mark.</LD>
<LD>   In winning for the second consecutive year, Bonds was a unanimous
choice for the first time, listed on top of all 32 ballots submitted
by the Baseball Writers' Assn. of America for a total of 448 points.
It was also the third consecutive year a Giant had been named MVP,
second baseman Jeff Kent getting the award in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Shawn Green of the Dodgers was fifth with 146 points, preceded by
the St. Louis Cardinals' Albert Pujols (276), the Houston Astros'
Lance Berkman (181) and the Montreal Expos' Vladimir Guerrero (168).</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather win the World Series," said Bonds by phone from Japan,
"but I'm very happy about it, very excited. It's very gratifying."</TE>
<TE>   After hitting a record 73 home runs in 2001, the 38-year-old Bonds
came back to win the batting title in 2002 with a .370 mark, becoming
the oldest player to win a batting crown for the first time. He also
broke Ted Williams' 61-year-old record for on-base percentage with a
.582 average. Contributing to that were Bonds' 198 walks, which
extended his single-season record. Bonds had the majors' highest
slugging percentage at .799, hit 46 home runs and drove in 110.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to figure out why a 38-year-old player is still
playing like this," Bonds said. "Forget the historical part. I'm
overjoyed coming off a 73-home run year and staying consistent. It's
pretty much the same numbers as the year before."</TE>
<TE>   Pujols' numbers -- .314 average, 34 home runs, 127 RBIs and a key
role in leading the Cardinals to the NL Central Division title --
were enough to make him the only other player named on every ballot.</TE>
<TE>   It always seems to be sweet and sour with Bonds, and Monday was no
exception.</TE>
<TE>   Even in his moment of elation, he couldn't avoid flashing some
bitterness over what he perceives as a lack of acceptance of a career
which began in 1986 and included seven years with the Pittsburgh
Pirates and the last decade with the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how it felt to be in an elite circle with Wayne Gretzky,
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and others who have won MVP trophies a record
number of times, Bonds said, "I wish I was liked as much as them.
That would be nice. People admire their accomplishments. I wish mine
were embraced and respected as much, but they never have been."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about his relationship with the media, which appears to have
led to that perception, Bonds balked.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really unfair," he said, "at a joyful moment like this, to
ask me about my relations with the press."</TE>
<TE>   But Bonds had no problem answering questions about his
relationship with his departing manager. Dusty Baker has left because
of differences with Giant management, specifically with managing
general partner Peter Magowan. Bonds, who has never been a master of
diplomacy, nonetheless showed surprising tact when asked about
Baker's controversial move.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a lot of respect for Dusty going back to my childhood,"
Bonds said, "both of us coming from Riverside. I want to thank Dusty
for the years we spent together. They were very special. I wish him
good luck. We are all going to miss him. Wherever he goes, his
players will play very hard for him.</TE>
<TE>   "But I'm a San Francisco Giant and I have to stand behind my
organization because that's where I work. Regardless of how we feel,
it is up to us to do our job. I don't own the San Francisco Giants,
nor am I the general manager. I am sure Peter Magowan and [General
Manager] Brian Sabean will pick the right manager to fit with the
players we have. They will do the best they can to keep us
competitive. Peter had a taste of the World Series. Knowing me and
knowing Peter, we are going to want to get there again real soon."</TE>
<TE>   Although his Giants lost to the Angels in a seven-game World
Series, Bonds said the postseason, the first in which he was on a
team that won a playoff series, was a positive experience.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a fun time," he said. "I really enjoyed being in the
World Series. I didn't know what to expect, didn't know how I'd feel.
But once we got past the tomahawk chop [beating the Atlanta Braves in
a division series], it was the biggest weight off my chest that I
have ever felt. It allowed me to relax and play.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to have done more. I was disappointed we didn't win. One
team has to win and I just applaud [the Angels].</TE>
<TE>   "But if it happens again that we get back to the World Series, we
will win. We just have a little more work to do."</TE>

<HD>Serena Can Make Loss Work for Her and Tennis</HD>

<LD>Serena Williams lost to Kim Clijsters, 7-5, 6-3, Monday night in the
finals of the Home Depot WTA Championships, and it was the best thing
that could have happened to women's tennis.</LD>
<LD>   It is most important to keep Serena interested.</LD>
<LD>   "I like that I didn't win today," Serena said, "because I'm so
motivated right now to win the Australian Open. It's like last year
when I didn't play the Australian, I got super-motivated. I told
myself I was going to win the French, Wimbledon and U.S. Open."</LD>
<TE>   Done, done and emphatically done. That's just the kind of person
Serena is. A go-getter.</TE>
<TE>   So let's expect that Williams will find herself a little more
stamina. She admitted she was winded against Clijsters after being
pushed hard by Jennifer Capriati on Sunday in the semifinals. But
Serena has learned to figure things out. About her game, about
herself. She'll do it again.</TE>
<TE>   Before the match, important men wearing suits came forward to talk
about how committed everybody is to bring these championships back to
Staples Center. It hasn't been a secret that attendance was dismal at
times and, at best, barely satisfactory. Some of the players had been
openly lethargic, which resulted in some non-competitive matches.</TE>
<TE>   But everybody is happy, the suits said. The tournament, which had
left Munich after barely touching down last year, will be here again
next year, the suits said. They kept talking about "a long-term
commitment," which is vaguely optimistic. And there was lots of talk
about "strong brands" and "brand association" and "strong brand
situations."</TE>
<TE>   Right now, the most important brand women's tennis has is Serena
Williams. Therefore it is important to keep Serena healthy, happy and
challenged.</TE>
<TE>   Serena is a personality. She is engaging and attractive. She is
physically imposing with an iron athletic will. She pushes herself on
the tennis court -- her game is not only about power now, but about
angles and touch and changing the pace -- and her life off the court
is filled with acting gigs and fashion shows.</TE>
<TE>   Serena is fun, she is pretty in pink, a tigress in black and she
has managed to make all the other women, even her older sister Venus,
invisible. She has rarely been pushed on the tennis court this year.
Until Monday night, Serena had lost only four matches this year, and
one of those was a mid-match retirement because of an ankle injury
that kept her out of the Australian Open.</TE>
<TE>   That ankle injury might have kept Serena from a Grand Slam sweep
this year because the 21-year-old won the other three biggies -- the
French Open, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   Luckily, Serena has a goal for next year. Winning them all.</TE>
<TE>   Because women's tennis is in a terrible place if Serena gets bored
with the sport and more fascinated with her other interests, you
know, the acting and the fashion.</TE>
<TE>   A week before the championships, Serena had a guest appearance on
the Damon Wayans sitcom, "My Wife and Kids." Reviews were positive.
Serena was a natural. She's now enthusiastic about some off-season
auditions.</TE>
<TE>   "A couple of different movie roles," Serena, woman of mystery,
said. "I'm really, really, really excited. I'm going to try to slim
up."</TE>
<TE>   This has been a year of revelation about Serena. She has grown up,
as an athlete and a personality. With a new composure, she discovered
her belief in her ability and her desire to beat everybody, even her
role model, her best friend, her confessor, her practice partner --
Venus.</TE>
<TE>   Serena also has grown comfortable with everything that comes with
being the No. 1 player. She loved the attention her controversial,
physique-baring outfits brought to the U.S. Open. She can deconstruct
her game and herself -- "Sometimes, for me," she said, "I need to
take a step back and say to myself, 'Keep going ahead.' "</TE>
<TE>   That's a worthwhile discovery from a young woman about herself.
Serena accepted this slap-in-the-face loss from Clijsters as a good
thing, as a way to move into the brief tennis off-season with an
emphatic reason to train hard and refresh for January.</TE>
<TE>   What women's tennis has in Serena Williams is something it has not
had before. Women's tennis has a cross-over personality.</TE>
<TE>   Serena is a winner, as an athlete. As an actress. As a young woman
who knows what she wants and who she is.</TE>
<TE>   Serena can bring to tennis Hollywood glitz, Madison Avenue pizazz,
streetwise kids. They were all at Staples Center Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Wulff, CEO of the WTA, did notice something about the Los
Angeles crowds. These were some of the most "ethnically diverse"
crowds Wulff said he had seen anywhere. They were at Staples Monday
mostly to see Serena.</TE>
<TE>   They love her long, blond hair. They love it when she wears the
skin-tight black bodysuit and when she wears the little black skirt
and Lycra pink sleeveless blouse with a strategic cut-out so that
Serena's bellybutton ring shines brightly.</TE>
<TE>   As outrageously nontraditional as her clothing is, Williams also
speaks with emotion about winning a very traditional tournament,
Wimbledon, for the first time as her season's high point. Because,
she said, "I always wanted to win Wimbledon, hold up that trophy with
all the history behind it."</TE>
<TE>   When the new tennis season begins in Australia, all eyes will be
on Serena. Can she win a fourth straight Grand Slam? What will she
wear? What movie did she audition for? What fun did she have? For
now, it's all about Serena.</TE>

<HD>Relatively Big Victory for Clijsters</HD>
<DH>Belgian completes rare sweep of Williams sisters, upsetting
top-ranked Serena, 7-5, 6-3, to win title in WTA Championships at
Staples Center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Dillman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Too old. Too slow. Too scared.</LD>
<LD>   Kim Clijsters was none of those things, of course, but it takes an
extra something special to challenge, let alone beat the Williams
sisters in a tournament. Maybe the final push had something to do
with a little bit of acting against the aspiring actress, Serena
Williams.</LD>
<LD>   When Clijsters fell behind by a service break against Williams in
the first set on Monday night, her face remained impassive, and just
as importantly, there was no slumping of her shoulders.</LD>
<TE>   "I said, 'Don't worry if she hits a few aces,' " Clijsters said.
"You just don't show any emotions. That's where they can read how
you're feeling and that's how they can push a little bit extra.
That's what I did and it worked."</TE>
<TE>   This resulted in the biggest victory of the 19-year-old Clijsters'
career. The fifth-seeded Belgian won her first major title, defeating
the No. 1-ranked and defending champion Serena Williams, 7-5, 6-3, in
the final of the $3-million Home Depot WTA Championships at Staples
Center before an announced 10,232.</TE>
<TE>   Total announced attendance was 56,862 for the event, which
struggled in its first year at this venue. Organizers are
contemplating changes, perhaps a round-robin format, and the
elimination of some day sessions.</TE>
<TE>   The defeat, in 1 hour 25 minutes, stopped Williams' 18-match
winning streak, as well as her effort to become the first female
tennis player to earn $4 million in one season. The reigning French
Open, Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion has lost five times in 2002,
and once since the European clay-court season in May.</TE>
<TE>   When Clijsters hit her final forehand winner to take the title,
and $765,000 in prize money, she dropped her racket and covered her
face. Then she uncorked an impressive throw, tossing a tennis ball
into one of the upper decks. Clijsters also made sure to acknowledge
a small group of Belgian supporters, speaking to them in Flemish.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd applauded and she showed some humor, saying: "You don't
have to clap. I know you don't understand."</TE>
<TE>   It was the first time Clijsters has defeated Williams in six
matches, though three of them have gone three sets. She beat Venus
Williams in the semifinals here, advancing when Venus retired from
the match because of a strained left calf after the first five games.</TE>
<TE>   Clijsters practically had two walkovers, though not in the true
sense, in back-to-back matches, because her countrywoman Justine
Henin hardly put forth an effort in their quarterfinal match. She
didn't lose a set in four matches and dropped only 14 games, which
tied the record for fewest games lost on the way to the title.</TE>
<TE>   Clijsters is the fourth player to defeat the sisters in the same
event, joining Arantxa Sanchez Vicario (Sydney, 1998), Steffi Graf
(Sydney, 1999) and Martina Hingis (Australian Open, 2001). She had a
little help from Jennifer Capriati, who pushed Serena to the limit in
their three-set semifinal on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Though Williams started well, taking a 5-3 first-set lead, she
slowly but surely wound down. The batteries were running low, and
Williams flickered in and out, as her technique and footwork started
to break down. Clijsters broke her serve five times in what was an
often erratic final.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think I was going to lose tonight, but I guess I did,"
said Serena, who had 44 unforced errors in her first loss since
falling in the quarterfinals at Manhattan Beach to Chanda Rubin in
August.</TE>
<TE>   "I did kind of feel my time winding down in my legs and my arm and
my back. I felt time running out, but other than that, I never give
up until I shake hands and I realize it's over.... To be honest,
right now I feel like I'm 98 years old. Everything right now is just
broke and I'm ready to go home. I'm an old lady in a young woman's
body."</TE>
<TE>   Williams is all of 21. But Clijsters won the final four games of
the first set and, sensing Williams was tiring quickly, kept the
pressure on, chasing down shots, and even doing her trademark
acrobatic splits to try to keep the points alive.</TE>
<TE>   "She wasn't moving as well as in the beginning of the [second]
set," Clijsters said. "I was getting a bit tired as well, so it was
good she was getting a little bit tired."</TE>
<TE>   Clijsters is charmingly honest. Someone asked her what she would
have thought if someone told her she would win in straight sets.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't have believed it," Clijsters said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps that's because she has come so close before against
Serena. As a giddy 16-year-old, she had a 5-3 lead against Williams
in the third set at the 1999 U.S. Open, running to her chair on
changeovers, before losing, 7-5.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the controversial 2001 Indian Wells final, in which
the crowd booed Williams during the entire match. Clijsters lost
after winning the first set and leading in the second but handled the
matter with class, earning the respect of the sisters.</TE>
<TE>   Clijsters, who won three of her last four tournaments this year,
was just as classy in victory. She hugged Williams and reveled in her
breakthrough moment, showing she will be a serious threat to win a
Grand Slam title next year. Her boyfriend, men's No. 1 Lleyton
Hewitt, told her to enjoy the moment when they spoke on the phone
before the final.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't believe she missed match point," Clijsters said. "I
couldn't believe I won.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe at that time I had goose bumps all over my body. It was
amazing. I hope a lot of players can have that when they win a big
event. It's really something amazing."</TE>

<LD>Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates pledged $100 million to fight AIDS in
India.</LD>
<LD>   The contribution will focus on women and prevention methods that
don't require the cooperation of a male partner. Gates' foundation

to kill HIV, the AIDS virus.</LD>
<LD>   A recent U.S. government report predicted that the number of

<HD>Japanese Court Ruling Favors Foreigners</HD>
<DH>Bathhouse must pay three men who were denied entry.
Decision is called 'significant' in a nation that tolerates
discrimination.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Magnier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>TOKYO -- A district court Monday ordered a private bathhouse on
Japan's northern island of Hokkaido to pay a total of $25,000 to
three foreign-born men who were refused entry on the basis of race.</LD>
<LD>   The decision by the Sapporo District Court received widespread
notice in a homogeneous nation where less than 1.5% of the population
is non-Japanese.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a significant ruling for Japanese society," said Akira
Fujimoto, associate professor of law at Kwassui Women's College.
"That said, it didn't go far enough."</LD>
<TE>   The court found against the owner of the Yunohana Onsen in Otaru,
a small port town, but rejected the contention that the government
shared responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   "The company's behavior amounts to racism," the court said.
"Refusing entry to the baths goes beyond socially acceptable limits."</TE>
<TE>   The court was not convinced by the plaintiffs' argument that the
government, as a regulator of businesses, had an obligation to work
against discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   "We were very happy they said this is racial discrimination and
that it's punishable," said university lecturer David Aldwinckle, 37,
the lead plaintiff. "But they left a big legal loophole."</TE>
<TE>   The Yunohana Onsen manager, who gave only his last name,
Kobayashi, said the decision against his bathhouse was regrettable.
He labeled the case a publicity stunt.</TE>
<TE>   "They knew our policy but nevertheless came with their children
and newspaper reporters, showed they couldn't bathe and suggested
they were 'humiliated,' " he said. "I don't think that's very
sensible."</TE>
<TE>   Discrimination against outsiders is more openly tolerated in Japan
than in many other parts of the developed world. "No Foreigners
Allowed" signs at restaurants and bars can occasionally be seen, and
foreigners tend to face more stringent requirements than Japanese
when, for example, renting real estate or signing up for mobile phone
service.</TE>
<TE>   But Japanese also face restrictions in seemingly arbitrary ways.
Some restaurants bar any new customers who haven't been invited by
longtime clients. And Japanese from another prefecture sometimes are
required to obtain additional guarantors and promise other safeguards
when renting apartments.</TE>
<TE>   The bathhouse case dates to the late 1990s, when Russian sailors
started patronizing Yunohana Onsen.</TE>
<TE>   Local variations on the story abound, but the gist is that several
groups of drunken sailors reportedly brought glass bottles of vodka
inside the bathhouse, made a lot of noise, wore shoes indoors and
washed themselves in the communal pool rather than before entering
the water, all major faux pas.</TE>
<TE>   "I hear Russian saunas are all a big party, but we don't do that
here," Kobayashi said. "We tried to teach some Russians public bath
manners, but it never improved."</TE>
<TE>   The behavior reportedly shocked the regular customers, who
demanded refunds and threatened to go elsewhere. The bathhouse
responded by barring foreigners with a "Japanese Only" sign in
English on the door.</TE>
<TE>   U.S.-born Aldwinckle, a naturalized citizen of Japan who has taken
the name Debito Arudo, filed suit in February 2001, along with
co-plaintiffs Olaf Karthaus, 39, of Mainz, Germany, and Ken
Sutherland, 38, of Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   The three based their suit on Japan's 1995 accession to the
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial
Discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   The case has touched a nerve across Japan. Globalization and an
aging population have increased the number of foreigners living and
working in the world's second-largest economy to about 1.6 million
out of a population of 126 million.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, many Japanese feel threatened by rapid social
change, the protracted economic downturn and rising crime. This has
spurred a backlash in some quarters against outsiders and the loss of
traditional values.</TE>
<TE>   "They took this measure against all foreigners because the chances
of foreigners making trouble is higher than for Japanese," said
Daisuke Arikado, a member of World Strategy Institute, a right-wing
group in favor of banning all foreigners from Japan.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs said they accept that discrimination exists and
that foreigners in Japan have a responsibility to learn local
customs. That said, Japan is the only member of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development without laws against
discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese cities and prefectures spend enormous sums touting their
internationalization, said Hideko Ito, the Sapporo-based attorney who
represented the plaintiffs.</TE>
<TE>   "If they really want to be international," she said, "they should
improve their understanding toward foreigners living in Japan."</TE>

<HD>Bush Presses Iraq Campaign While Honoring Veterans</HD>
<DH>'This great nation will not live at the mercy of any
foreign plot or power,' president says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maura Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Shadowed by rain clouds and the threat of war, President Bush paid
homage to American veterans Monday as he pressed his campaign against
Iraq and its leader, Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   "We will not permit a dictator who has used weapons of mass
destruction to threaten America with chemical, biological or nuclear
weapons," the president said during Veterans Day ceremonies at
Arlington National Cemetery. "This great nation will not live at the
mercy of any foreign plot or power."</LD>
<LD>   Bush's anti-Iraq campaign got two big boosts last week -- one from
the American electorate, which in several key states voted with a
strong preference for his party's candidates, and one from the U.N.
Security Council, which unanimously passed a resolution calling on
Iraq to disarm or face the use of force.</LD>
<TE>   Neither victory seemed to lower the octane in the president's
rhetoric.</TE>
<TE>   At another ceremony honoring veterans -- this one a reception in
the White House's East Room -- Bush linked the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks with his current focus on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "We will not forget the harm that was done to us. We will not be
distracted from the task before us," Bush said. "No enemy that
threatens our security or endangers our people will escape the
patient justice and the overwhelming power of the United States of
America."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say it is important for the president to keep up the
sharp language, both to keep the American people and the United
Nations behind him and to keep the pressure on the Iraqi president.</TE>
<TE>   "The audience that matters is Iraq, and softening the rhetoric is
not a way to force Iraq to comply" with the Security Council
resolution, said Anthony Cordesman, a security policy expert with the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think
tank.</TE>
<TE>   Cordesman and other analysts say they expect the White House to
keep the volume on Iraq high in the coming weeks as Hussein decides
whether and how fully to cooperate with a new round of weapons
inspections.</TE>
<TE>   "This nation loves peace. We work and sacrifice for peace," Bush
said at the national cemetery. "Yet America must always be prepared
to confront and defeat the enemies of human freedom. And when war is
forced upon us, we will see it through to victory."</TE>
<TE>   Some Security Council members had expressed dismay about Bush's
tough talk on Iraq, which they considered "belligerent, not to say
bullying toward the U.N.," said David Malone, a former Canadian
ambassador to the world body and now president of the International
Peace Academy in New York.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he said, the U.S. negotiated with members of the
Security Council in good faith over the new resolution and made
important compromises. The lesson the other members learned is that
the tone of Bush's rhetoric does not always match the tenor of his
policy.</TE>
<TE>   "Rightly or wrongly, there's going to be a tendency around the
world to take the president's rhetoric with a grain of salt," Malone
said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Malone added, heated language from the White House may
promote the U.N. approach to the Iraq crisis, which puts weapons
inspections ahead of military confrontation.</TE>
<TE>   Before his other appearances Monday, Bush made a surprise visit to
the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Attracting astonished stares from
small clusters of early morning visitors, the president placed a
small American flag at the base of the black marble wall etched with
the names of more than 58,000 U.S. military personnel killed or
missing in the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank you for your service," he told one startled veteran. "God
bless you," Bush called out to the crowd, shaking hands and scanning
the mounds of wreaths placed at the memorial.</TE>

<HD>Shake-Up Could Be Shanghaied</HD>
<DH>Expected leadership changes in China's ruling party may pit
Jiang's hometown proteges against likely heir's rural supporters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ching-Ching Ni</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SHANGHAI</DL>
<LD>Beijing may be the seat of power for the Chinese Communist Party, but
some of the capital's most formidable power brokers hail from
Shanghai, China's financial center.</LD>
<LD>   President Jiang Zemin has stacked the upper echelons of government
with so many former comrades from his days as party boss of this
coastal metropolis that they are collectively known in Beijing as the
"Shanghai gang."</LD>
<LD>   Many observers believe Jiang wants to maintain his influence after
he steps down as party chief at the end of the 16th Communist Party
congress, which is ongoing. Whether he will be able to do so depends
largely on how many of his Shanghai associates he can shove through
his powerful patronage mill.</LD>
<TE>   Jiang's interests could collide with those of his heir apparent.
Vice President Hu Jintao's power base derives from the
poverty-stricken Chinese interior, where he spent most of his
political career. Many of Hu's potential supporters come from
provinces resentful of the perceived favoritism lavished on wealthy
Shanghai.</TE>
<TE>   A coastal-inland division could be a source of tension within the
new administration, as well as a cause for optimism.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is concerned about factional networks, but everyone
tries to deny it," said Cheng Li, a China expert at Hamilton College
in New York state. "The next step is to legitimize factional
politics.... People can find representatives to voice their concerns.
This is the biggest step toward more accountable government."</TE>
<TE>   Genuine political reform is probably still years away. So far, the
entire selection process for the leaders of the world's most populous
nation has been shrouded in secrecy and defined by speculation.</TE>
<TE>   In all likelihood, Jiang will pass the baton to Hu but also try to
keep some power through his Shanghai proteges. But no one will know
for sure until a new lineup is paraded before the cameras after the
congress.</TE>
<TE>   At the very top of the anticipated new lineup, perhaps second only
to Hu, could be Jiang's right-hand man, Zeng Qinghong. He was Jiang's
chief of staff in Shanghai, followed him to Beijing in 1989 and
headed the party's powerful organization department, where he
promoted Shanghai loyalists and pushed aside rivals.</TE>
<TE>   Politburo members Wu Bangguo and Huang Ju, both Jiang proteges
from Shanghai, are leading candidates to move up to the most
powerful, seven-member Politburo standing committee. Chen Liangyu,
who just replaced Huang as Shanghai party boss, is likely to be
promoted to the Politburo.</TE>
<TE>   Before Jiang became president in the wake of the Tiananmen Square
massacre 13 years ago, Mao Tse-tung and Deng Xiaoping ruled China
with absolute power, aided by the sheer force of their personalities.
But the days of strongman politics are gone and the criteria for
leadership have changed to administrative and regional expertise.</TE>
<TE>   Jiang, who was trained as an engineer, turned to Shanghai to
fortify his power base.</TE>
<TE>   Shanghai, once a decadent colonial outpost, was also the founding
place 81 years ago of the Chinese Communist Party. During the 1966-76
Cultural Revolution, the fanatical Gang of Four, led by Mao's wife
Jiang Qing, used the city as a headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Shanghai was cast aside and left to wilt in the early
days of Deng's economic reforms. Jiang served quietly as the city's
leader until the tumult following the Tiananmen Square anti-democracy
crackdown in Beijing inadvertently gave Shanghai a new lease on life.</TE>
<TE>   The Shanghai political express also launched the national
political career of Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji. Zhu is expected to
step down this week from the Politburo standing committee, and in
March from the post of prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest beneficiary of the pipeline has been the city of
Shanghai itself. Until the era of the Shanghai gang, the fabled city
once known as the Paris of the East had deteriorated into an
industrial backwater.</TE>
<TE>   After Jiang consolidated his power in Beijing in the 1990s, he
showered his hometown with investment and favorable policies, and
Shanghai blossomed again.</TE>
<TE>   Jiang is rumored to want to retire in Shanghai. Back in Beijing,
his supporters would make sure he retains influence.</TE>
<TE>   It is still too early to know exactly who Hu's proteges are. His
political viability so far seems to have depended on his ability to
reveal as little of himself as possible. But he has cultivated some
natural allies by working his way up the ranks through some of the
country's most impoverished inland provinces, including Tibet and
Guizhou.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say Hu knows better than to ignore the welfare of
Shanghai, China's economic growth engine and showcase.</TE>
<TE>   "A smart leader will use Shanghai to work for him rather than
against him," said Hu Wei, a political scientist at Shanghai's
Jiaotong University, Jiang's alma mater. Hu Wei is no relation to Hu
Jintao.</TE>
<TE>   These competing regional interests have the potential to balance
each other as the two factions learn to tackle the country's mounting
social problems. That would have been impossible under an
all-powerful single leader such as Mao, who simply crushed any and
all possible dissent.</TE>
<TE>   "Hu and Zeng will learn to share their power," said Hu Wei. "It's
a sign of progress."</TE>

<HD>Iraqi Parliament Holds Emergency Meeting</HD>
<DH>Debate on U.N. arms resolution is seen as prelude to a
likely acceptance by Hussein.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Lamb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>Iraqi lawmakers convened in emergency session Monday night to
consider a response to a U.N. resolution that the speaker of
parliament called a "preamble to war" but other Arab governments view
as the only hope of avoiding war.</LD>
<LD>   The resolution, passed unanimously by the Security Council on
Friday and endorsed by the Arab League on Sunday, demands that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein allow the return of U.N. arms inspectors and
that he account for any chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. If
he doesn't accept the resolution by Friday, he risks "serious
consequences," which is understood to mean an attack by the United
States and Britain.</LD>
<LD>   Despite denunciations of the resolution during the nationally
televised parliamentary debate and in the Baghdad media, Arab League
sources said they believed Hussein would accept its terms, although
the process could drag on for several days. The resolution, based on
a British-U.S. draft, is so tough in its "zero tolerance" language
that no one in Iraq could be happy with it and Hussein would lose
face if he didn't put up some kind of resistance, the sources said.</LD>
<TE>   His decision to go to parliament surprised many Arab governments.
But Hussein, who opposed drafts of the resolution, may want to use
parliament as a cover to reverse his position: If the assembly votes
for compliance, he could say he is accepting U.N. demands because he
is responding to the will of the "elected" legislators, political
analysts said. Debate on the resolution is expected to resume today.</TE>
<TE>   The 250-member parliament is considered a rubber stamp for
Hussein. If the resolution is accepted, the decision then would go to
Iraq's most powerful group, the Revolutionary Command Council, for
final approval. Hussein is head of the council.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice,
rejected the legitimacy of the parliament debate.</TE>
<TE>   "One has to be a bit skeptical of the independence of the Iraqi
parliament from Saddam Hussein," she said. " ... I sincerely hope
that he gets about the business of deciding that it is finally time
for Iraq to comply with its obligations."</TE>
<TE>   Al Jumhuriyah, a state-run Baghdad daily, urged Arabs on Monday to
"stand firm against U.S. aggression" and to "use oil as a weapon" to
defeat the aggressors. Similar suggestions in recent years have been
dismissed by oil ministers as impractical and are not likely to gain
any support in the current crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Arab governments, which generally are as disdainful of Hussein as
are Washington and London, have exerted intense pressure on the Iraqi
president to accept the U.N. demands. They have told him that,
although they are against a U.S. attack, they will offer him no
support if he rejects the resolution. Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak told his senior military officers last month that if there is
a war in Iraq, Hussein bears responsibility for it.</TE>
<TE>   With the Security Council's 15-0 vote on the resolution and the
endorsement of the 22-member Arab League, Hussein stands alone. That,
however, does not mean he is not prepared to risk war. In the 1991
Persian Gulf War, even Arab armies joined the coalition against him,
but he was still unwilling to leave Kuwait until driven out.</TE>
<TE>   As in 1991, Hussein has had no current success rallying Arab
support. He has said an American attack on Iraq would represent a
threat to the entire Arab world, that Washington wants to control the
region's oil fields, that the U.S. is trigger-happy. Many Arab
governments agree with some elements of what he says, but because of
their dislike of Hussein and their unwillingness to threaten
strategic and economic relationships with the United States, none are
willing to distance themselves from the U.N. resolution. In the Gulf
War, Jordan, a longtime U.S. ally, and the Palestine Liberation
Organization sided with Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Arab diplomats who have recently met with Hussein said he believes
the United States plans to find an excuse to attack regardless of
whether he cooperates with U.N. weapons inspectors. Washington's talk
of a "regime change" -- which has been toned down in recent weeks --
leaves him in a lose-lose situation, he has told Arab envoys. The
question, political analysts said, is whether Hussein values survival
over power.</TE>
<TE>   "Saddam Hussein is homicidal, but he's not suicidal," said Judith
Kipper, a Middle East expert with the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Prepared to Endorse Sale of Ivory Under Stringent
Rules</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SANTIAGO, Chile</DL>
<LD>The United States said Monday that it would endorse a one-time sale
of African ivory if strict international enforcement regulations were
set in place.</LD>
<LD>   An American delegation here at the U.N. Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species offered a proposal to allow
Botswana's government to sell nearly 45 tons of elephant ivory worth
millions of dollars.</LD>
<LD>   International trade in ivory has been illegal since 1989.</LD>
<TE>   Botswana and four other southern African nations have sought
permission to sell a total of 188 tons of ivory in a one-time sale.
They also seek a yearly sale of ivory from stockpiles collected from
elephants culled in management plans.</TE>
<TE>   Elephants in most of Africa continue to recover from poaching that
reduced their population from 1.3 million to 600,000 during the
1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Some nations, like Botswana, say their management plans have been
so successful that they have more elephants than their parks can
accommodate.</TE>
<TE>   Although many nations argue that any ivory sale could lead to new
poaching, Craig Manson of the U.S. delegation disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. proposal calls for strict monitoring of elephant
populations across Africa and in Asia, along with tighter customs
controls. If approved, ivory sales would begin in four years.</TE>
<TE>   The convention is to vote on the U.S. proposal today.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SRINAGAR, India</DL>
<LD>The new government in India's Jammu and Kashmir state freed a
prominent separatist leader from prison Monday as Islamic militants
who also seek independence for the Kashmir region killed 13
parliamentary police in a bomb attack.</LD>
<LD>   Yasin Malik, an icon to thousands of Kashmiri youths, was released
eight months after his arrest for allegedly laundering money to
finance terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   His release was an attempt by the new government to ease tensions
in the region, claimed by both India and Pakistan, and stem a tide of
violence.</LD>
<TE>   The bomb exploded along the state's main highway as police
traveled in a truck near the town of Ramsoo, about 80 miles south of
Srinagar, said Neeraj Kumar of the Border Security Force. In addition
to the 13 dead, five police officers were injured.</TE>
<TE>   The Pakistan-based Hezb-ul-Moujahedeen, the largest guerrilla
group in Kashmir, claimed responsibility for the attack.</TE>

<HD>Arab Neighbors Grieve With Kibbutzniks for Slain</HD>
<DH>Members of communal farm where gunman killed five have long
espoused tolerance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KIBBUTZ METZER, Israel</DL>
<LD>For years they drank from the same well, and on Monday they shared
the bitter drink of mourning.</LD>
<LD>   An Israeli communal farm regarded as an emblem of Jewish-Arab
coexistence grieved for five people, including a mother and her two
small boys, shot dead in a rampage Sunday night by a suspected
Palestinian gunman who then escaped into the surrounding shrubby
hills.</LD>
<LD>   From across orchards and olive groves, Arab neighbors came to
Kibbutz Metzer to express their sorrow -- and their fears that a
friendship of generations' standing, a rarity in these violent days,
could be jeopardized by the bloody events of the night before.</LD>
<TE>   "We are as close as brothers," said Adha Taher, 49, who led a
delegation of elders from the adjoining Israeli Arab village of
Mesar, many of them clad in traditional robes and white headdresses,
to offer condolences to red-eyed kibbutzniks. "How could this have
happened?"</TE>
<TE>   Kibbutz Metzer, founded in Israel's early years of statehood by
mainly Argentine immigrants, has long been a bastion of leftist
politics and activism in the country's peace movement.</TE>
<TE>   From the hardscrabble years when the kibbutz was little more than
a scattering of tents on a bare hillside, its members shared a water
source and agricultural know-how with Arab neighbors, a tradition
that continues to this day.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who visited the kibbutz in the
attack's aftermath, promised that those who orchestrated and carried
out the infiltration would pay a heavy price.</TE>
<TE>   "What we saw here today is yet another example of the people we
are confronting," he said -- a view many kibbutz residents deplored
as a smear against all Arabs.</TE>
<TE>   Home to 450 Israelis who farm the land, raise dairy cows and run a
small fitted-pipe factory, Kibbutz Metzer lies less than half a mile
from the border with the northern West Bank, the attacker's suspected
entry point.</TE>
<TE>   Early today, the army reported it had arrested two wanted
Palestinian men near the West Bank city of Tulkarm and destroyed the
home of a militant leader blamed for the attack. Palestinians in the
Tulkarm refugee camp said Israeli tanks moved in before dawn. The
military was also expected to tighten its grip on Nablus.</TE>
<TE>   The move into the camp came just hours after Israeli soldiers
killed a 2-year-old boy and wounded two other children at the Rafah
refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, witnesses and hospital officials
said. The army said that troops had responded to shots fired at them
and that it was unaware of casualties.</TE>
<TE>   After the kibbutz slayings, Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
who took up his post in Sharon's government less than a week ago,
called for the removal of what he labeled the "terror regime" of
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   However, he told Israel's Army Radio that the timing of such a
step would depend on "international developments," an apparent
reference to momentum building toward an American strike against
Iraq's Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has made it clear to Israel that any
unwarranted escalation of the conflict with the Palestinians at this
delicate time would be extremely unwelcome.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat condemned the Kibbutz Metzer attack, but the Al Aqsa
Martyrs Brigade, a Palestinian militant group linked to his Fatah
faction, claimed responsibility for the shootings.</TE>
<TE>   In both Israel and the Palestinian territories, more than 25
months of bloodletting has diminished the shock effect of even the
most violent deaths.</TE>
<TE>   But the killings at the kibbutz struck a chord across Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Television viewers witnessed a wrenching display of grief by Avi
Ohayon, father of Noam and Matan, boys of 4 and 5 who were shot dead
as they tried to hide under their covers.</TE>
<TE>   Their 34-year-old mother, Revital, Ohayon's ex-wife, died while
trying to block the gunman in the bedroom doorway.</TE>
<TE>   "My soul, my soul!" Ohayon sobbed as he collapsed on the
children's mattress hours after the killing, surrounded by his sons'
toys. His weeping grew desperate when he spotted a pacifier that he
had sometimes teased Matan for still using.</TE>
<TE>   Revital Ohayon had called her former husband shortly before
midnight to say that she heard gunfire outside. While she was on the
line, the gunman burst into the one-story stucco house.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard the shot and my children screaming -- can you begin to
comprehend what that meant to me?" Avi Ohayon said in a raw-voiced
interview with Israel's Channel Two.</TE>
<TE>   Revital Ohayon, a schoolteacher, had moved to the kibbutz three
months earlier because she felt it would be a good home for the boys.</TE>
<TE>   On the covered porch of the house, the children's pets were still
in their cage, and laundry -- almost all small shirts and socks --
was drying on a rack.</TE>
<TE>   Also killed in the attack were the kibbutz's general secretary,
44-year-old Yitzhak Dori, and 42-year-old Tirtza Damari, who was
visiting her boyfriend, a member of the kibbutz. Thousands of people,
many of them from kibbutzim all over Israel, converged on the small
community for Dori's funeral Monday afternoon. Although the kibbutz
movement in recent years has been struggling financially and
suffering from declining membership, many Israelis regard the
collective agricultural settlements as a national emblem and consider
the movement's ideals as having been a crucial force in shaping the
character of their state.</TE>
<TE>   Kibbutz Metzer lies in Israel's narrowest point -- a "waist" of
only about 10 miles between the West Bank and the Mediterranean. The
corridor has been the scene of a series of attacks by militant
groups, including a bus bombing only a few miles from the kibbutz
Oct. 21 that killed 14 people.</TE>
<TE>   In an even closer brush, a car carrying two Palestinians blew up
Sunday at midday almost at the gates of the kibbutz, killing the two
men inside, after police spotted the vehicle and shouted at the
driver to stop.</TE>
<TE>   The kibbutz is surrounded by an ordinary wire fence. Residents of
the lightly guarded community said they had always felt a measure of
safety -- in large part, they said, because of the warm relations
cultivated over decades with their Arab neighbors, in Mesar on the
Israeli side and in Palestinian villages across the border in the
West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   This month, kibbutz residents filed a legal complaint against
plans for a security fence between Israel and the West Bank,
objecting to the fact that the barrier would have cut through olive
groves belonging to Palestinian villages in the West Bank. They
wanted the fence line redrawn to leave the groves intact on the other
side.</TE>
<TE>   "These were our founding principles -- tolerance and
egalitarianism, a view of our neighbors as people and equals," said
Dov Avital, who has lived in Kibbutz Metzer for 14 years. "And we
cannot abandon those ideals now, only because of this terrible
thing."</TE>

<HD>Iraqi Kurds Say U.S. Is Back</HD>
<DH>Hussein's foes in the north cite renewed cooperation with
Washington. Such collaboration could help in war, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robin Wright</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>IRBIL, Iraq</DL>
<LD>IRBIL, Iraq -- The United States has quietly renewed its covert
cooperation with Kurds in northern Iraq, potentially crucial players
in any U.S.-led military operation against Baghdad, according to
senior Kurdish officials.</LD>
<LD>   Kurdish sources say U.S. intelligence officials are in Kurdish
territory on multiple missions, which include doing advance work for
a possible attack on Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, establishing a
listening post to monitor what is happening in the rest of Iraq and
probing the strength and operations of an Islamic extremist group
with ties to Al Qaeda.</LD>
<LD>   Washington has promised to protect the Kurds if Hussein should
order his troops into their region, the officials say.</LD>
<TE>   "If Saddam Hussein invades the north, the United States will act
immediately," said Jalal Talabani, head of the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan, one of two main Kurdish movements in the north. "Now there
is all kinds of cooperation with the United States. Militarily, there
is all kinds of cooperation."</TE>
<TE>   The involvement would mark a comeback for the United States, which
was forced to withdraw its CIA station from northern Iraq after
Hussein invaded in 1996. That offensive also led to the collapse of
the north as the headquarters for the U.S.-backed Iraqi opposition
coalition. Since then, the CIA and the coalition have operated from
outside Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Some here fear that Hussein might launch a preemptive thrust into
the north to divert attention from the renewed effort to make him
give up any weapons of mass destruction, leaving the outside world
scrambling to respond before it is ready to take him on.</TE>
<TE>   "Every person in Kurdistan has prepared food and medicine and is
ready to go to the mountains or the border for fear that Saddam
Hussein will move on the north. He can't attack other countries, but
he can hit his own people. And he's slaughtered us here more than
once before," said Nasreen Mustafa Sadiq, the Harvard-educated
minister of reconstruction and development in the Kurds' government.</TE>
<TE>   The renewed U.S.-Kurdish bond illustrates the depth of the Bush
administration's intentions to get involved in Iraq and to be
prepared militarily. The administration was unable to prepare
adequately before the campaign to oust the ruling Taliban in nearby
Afghanistan last year.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, CIA and Pentagon officials said Monday that they
could not confirm the reports of increased cooperation with the Kurds
or of any new commitments to protect them.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Kurdish leaders have been appealing for guarantees
beyond a general statement that Washington would retaliate at a time
and a place of its choosing for any strike against the Kurds.</TE>
<TE>   A senior leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, the other main
party, said a "new relationship" with the United States has evolved
in the last two months.</TE>
<TE>   "I sincerely believe that U.S. cooperation with the Kurds will be
beneficial to both sides," said Kurdish Deputy Prime Minister Sami
Abdurrahman.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the north has been protected from Iraqi airstrikes by U.S.
and British warplanes enforcing a "no-fly" zone. But the unofficial
internal border on the ground is now also considered a "red line"
that Hussein may not cross, Kurdish officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "If Saddam violates that red line again, the response will not be
mere punishment," said another senior Kurdish leader who spoke on
condition of anonymity. "The response would be to annihilate him
altogether."</TE>
<TE>   Kurdish leaders expect to hold talks with U.S. officials about
deepening their cooperation after a conference of joint Iraqi
opposition forces scheduled for Brussels this month. One Kurdish
leader said he wants the United States to ensure that it will prevent
any outside interference by neighboring nations either during or
after any war to oust Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "We now await guarantees from the United States," said Massoud
Barzani, head of the Kurdistan Democratic Party.</TE>
<TE>   Kurds are particularly concerned about Turkey and Iran, and the
danger that any move to influence or intervene by either country
would lead the other to follow suit.</TE>
<TE>   Northern Kurdistan is important to the United States as a possible
entry point for U.S. troops in the event of an invasion of Iraq. In
the meantime, it is also the only area where U.S. intelligence can
operate freely.</TE>
<TE>   Three airfields -- Harir, east of Irbil; Bakrajo, near
Sulaymaniyah; and Bamarni, near Dahuk -- also could be prime
facilities for the U.S. military. The three, along with a smaller
helicopter and light aircraft facility at Sirsenk, were used by the
Iraqi military until 1991. The senior Kurdish leader described the
facilities as "ideal" logistically for a military operation against
Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   All four facilities need some degree of upgrading or repairs for a
major operation, Kurdish sources say. In the last decade, some of
them have been put to use for other purposes, such as driver
education courses and outdoor wedding parties.</TE>
<TE>   Two turning points are said to have led to the apparent U.S.
involvement. One was the August meeting in Washington of six Iraqi
opposition groups, part of a U.S. attempt to forge a united Iraqi
opposition. The second happened last month, when the two former
rivals -- the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan -- formally put aside years of fighting and tension and
jointly reopened the regional parliament for the first time since
1996.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the new cooperation, Kurds say, they are nervous about
whether the Americans will follow through, in part because
Washington's pledge is not part of a formal agreement or even a
written commitment.</TE>
<TE>   "The commitment is still in the early stage, and there's a lot of
room for wiggling out. I'm petrified that my people will be abandoned
-- again," said Barham Salih of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan in
Sulaymaniyah.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has a long record of not fulfilling promises to
Iraq's Kurds, a non-Arabic people who are one of Iraq's three major
population groups. After Iraq was forced out of Kuwait in 1991, the
first Bush administration called on the Kurds to rise up to topple
Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   The Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south
launched the largest domestic challenge to Hussein since he assumed
power in 1979. But the U.S. military, which was still stationed in
the region, allowed Baghdad to use its helicopter gunships to crush
the revolt, killing thousands and forcing nearly 2 million Kurds to
flee to the Iranian and Turkish borders.</TE>
<TE>   The United States, along with the former shah of Iran, also
encouraged a Kurdish revolt against Baghdad when Hussein was vice
president in early 1975. But U.S. backing abruptly collapsed a short
time later when then-Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger mediated a
deal to end a territorial dispute between Iraq and Iran.</TE>
<TE>   The terms included an end to political and material support of the
Kurds, which freed Hussein -- who was already the major political
power in Iraq -- to put down the uprising. Yet Kurdish leaders are
buoyed by the apparent change in U.S. cooperation. "The United States
has been good to us, and we look at the United States as a partner to
bring about a better Iraq," said Salih. "I'd be surprised if the
United States allows this opportunity to go down the tubes."</TE>

<DL>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia</DL>
<LD>Yugoslavia's pro-Western deputy prime minister, a key contender in
Serbian presidential elections, said Monday that he would not run in
the Dec. 8 repeat ballot.</LD>
<LD>   Miroljub Labus finished second behind Yugoslav President Vojislav
Kostunica in the October runoff for president. The vote was declared
invalid because of low voter turnout.</LD>
<LD>   "Voters in Serbia evidently do not believe these elections can
change anything," Labus said. "Therefore I have no wish to run
again."</LD>
<TE>   Labus said people in Serbia, the larger of Yugoslavia's two
republics, were "tired of disputes and divisions."</TE>
<TE>   Kostunica has said he will soon decide whether to run in the
repeat vote. So far, only ultranationalist Vojislav Seselj has
confirmed that he will be a candidate.</TE>

<HD>Caves Full of Explosive Surprises</HD>
<DH>U.S. demolition team members are nearly blown up themselves
as they destroy rockets found in rugged Afghan mountains.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Zucchino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MANDEIKOL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>The demolition specialists took the customary precautions.</LD>
<LD>   They moved the residents of this settlement in eastern Afghanistan
well away from the cave where 90 Russian rockets had been found
Saturday. They had U.S. soldiers take cover about half a mile away,
behind two massive rock formations.</LD>
<LD>   Only then did Staff Sgt. Jeffrey Wade, the team leader, detonate
45 blocks of C-4 explosive intended to destroy the rockets and keep
them out of enemy hands.</LD>
<TE>   The size of the explosion stunned even Wade. It painted the
evening sky red and sent tremendous shock waves across the mountains.
It turned ordinary rocks into lethal projectiles, hurling them like
meteorites for more than 1,000 yards.</TE>
<TE>   One stone slammed into the helmet of Pfc. John Blyer, knocking him
unconscious. Another stone smashed into the left ankle of Pfc.
Gabriel Watt, leaving him howling in pain.</TE>
<TE>   "Medic! Medic!" soldiers screamed in the dark as a towering plume
of flame and black smoke rose over the mountains.</TE>
<TE>   For the 82nd Airborne Division soldiers on this mission into the
wilderness, the mishap added yet another danger to an already
perilous job.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, with the two injured soldiers evacuated and
hospitalized in stable condition, Wade was at a loss to explain what
had happened.</TE>
<TE>   "This was very atypical," said Wade, a slender, meticulous
demolition expert from Louisiana. "The only thing I can figure is
that maybe there was more ordnance underneath the rockets that we
didn't see."</TE>
<TE>   Even before the injuries, officers and soldiers of the 1st
Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment had been on an unusual
mission. It was the first time they had been directed to significant
weapons caches rather than discovering caches during regular combat
sweeps.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Mullah Abdel Razeq, a militia commander who controls the Kohe
Safi mountains northeast of Kabul, the Afghan capital, had told U.S.
commanders at nearby Bagram air base about several caves containing
rockets and other weapons. Rockets are fired at American troops in
Afghanistan almost daily, so those in the caves are considered a
"direct and immediate threat" to Bagram.</TE>
<TE>   The Kohe Safi range is so rugged and forbidding that troops had to
be flown in by helicopters that made harrowing landings in narrow
gorges. One Chinook pilot hovered over a rocky outcrop, with only the
rear wheels touching ground, until soldiers leapt out.</TE>
<TE>   Besides helicopter crashes, other potential dangers included
snipers, a startled villager opening fire, land mines, radio
failures, booby traps and even dog bites and twisted ankles.</TE>
<TE>   The troops also worried about oversights. One Chinook was delayed
when a sergeant found a grenade pin and ordered everyone aboard to
check their grenades. The same sergeant warned his men that because
the helicopters would be landing on inclines, anyone who didn't
crouch low when exiting risked decapitation.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the men had phoned loved ones the night before. They
tucked photos into their helmet liners and a few kissed them for good
luck.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a dangerous job in a dangerous place," Capt. Stephen
Snyder said. "Anything can happen."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The men of Alpha Company found Razeq and his militiamen waiting at
the landing zone Saturday morning. Earlier, officers had flown Razeq
over the area to have him point out the caches. He spotted some and
promised to locate others on a map. But when he produced a map later,
it was a large-scale tourist map, without the coordinates needed to
pinpoint the sites.</TE>
<TE>   That meant the troops would have to hike for hours through gorges
to the caches, following the translated directions of the militia
commander. It helped that a small team of coalition special forces
soldiers had hiked with militiamen to the caches the day before with
global positioning systems that provided map coordinates.</TE>
<TE>   Although the general was a professed anti-Taliban commander, the
loyalties of his militiamen were anyone's guess. Many men in the area
had fought with or supported the Taliban. The Americans assumed that
some of Razeq's men were willing to give or sell information to the
enemy.</TE>
<TE>   The general's motives were less opaque.</TE>
<TE>   "He wants to get rid of this stuff because he doesn't want to be
held responsible for any rocket attack from his region against U.S.
forces," said Maj. Craig Osborne, the battalion's operations officer.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. commanders brought civil affairs specialists to interview
villagers, explain the mission and gather useful intelligence; combat
medics and the battalion surgeon; ordnance and demolition specialists
and engineers equipped with a tiny wheeled robot; and military
intelligence specialists.</TE>
<TE>   Also on hand were psychological operations specialists to "spread
the word, let people know what we're doing, give them the big
picture, the World Trade Center, the whole nine yards," as Staff Sgt.
Samuel Escobar put it.</TE>
<TE>   It was a two-hour hike to the first two caches. Both were inside
caves carved from the rock face above a stream bed. One had 90
Russian 122-millimeter rockets and the other held two dozen more.</TE>
<TE>   Wade said the rockets probably dated from the Soviet occupation of
the 1980s. They were still functional.</TE>
<TE>   As Wade's team inspected the caves for booby traps, civil affairs
officers herded the villagers of a nearby mud-hut compound to safety
in another compound half a mile away. Herders moved their goats.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans began hiking to a spot behind the two towering rock
formations.</TE>
<TE>   Wade calculated the fragmentation range for exploding shrapnel and
rock at just over 300 yards. The blast range, he calculated, was
1,145 yards. He and his men set the charges for each cache.</TE>
<TE>   When Wade hiked to where the soldiers were taking cover, he saw
several standing on open ground, hoping to get a look at the
explosion. He ordered them to move farther back, behind the rock
formations. They were 1,050 yards from the blast site.</TE>
<TE>   The smaller cache blew first, and the blast wave pounded the
mountains and crashed over the soldiers. There were shouts and loud
hoots from the men.</TE>
<TE>   The second explosion was much bigger. Soldiers who were standing
and watching the massive eruption of flame and smoke suddenly dived
for cover as they realized that huge rocks were hurtling their way.</TE>
<TE>   A rock knocked off Blyer's helmet and leveled him. Another crushed
Watt's ankle.</TE>
<TE>   A rock the size of a watermelon crashed with a thud three feet
from where Pfc. Ananias Whitfield, 19, had taken cover. He looked up,
pale and wide-eyed, and said quietly, "I almost died right now."</TE>
<TE>   The medics were there in seconds, cutting off Watt's bloody boot
and cradling Blyer's ashen face as he passed in and out of
consciousness. Blyer was moaning softly. Watt was bellowing and
cursing in pain.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, Maj. Eric Fisher, the battalion surgeon, rushed
over and ordered the medics not to let Blyer move his head.</TE>
<TE>   They secured Blyer's neck with a cervical collar as Fisher asked
Blyer his name and social security number. Groggily, Blyer responded.
They tied him to a stretcher, still conscious.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher examined Watt and determined that he probably had a
fracture. His ankle was bound in a splint. Watt begged for water and
screamed for someone to squeeze his hand.</TE>
<TE>   "It hurts!" he shouted.</TE>
<TE>   "I know, I know," the surgeon said.</TE>
<TE>   Soon a helicopter arrived from Bagram, its rotors beating and its
silhouette a dark stain on the mountains. It roared off minutes
later, ferrying the two soldiers to the military hospital at Bagram.</TE>
<TE>   Silently, the rest of the company hiked back to the landing zone
in the dark.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, some of the men were still talking about the
size of the rocks that had just missed them the night before. They
asked about Blyer and Watt.</TE>
<TE>   No one blamed the demolition team for the close call. But Wade,
asked whether he would move soldiers much farther back for future
detonations than guidelines recommend, replied, "Of course,
absolutely."</TE>
<TE>   At the landing zone, Gen. Razeq arrived to provide directions to
more rocket caches and to offer condolences for the two injured
soldiers to Lt. Col. Ronald J. Rose Jr., the battalion commander.</TE>
<TE>   The American and the Afghan conferred on a rocky plateau. The
general, who had received complaints from villagers that he had not
passed on American warnings of the impending detonations, asked for a
better warning system.</TE>
<TE>   Rose took a whistle from one of his captains and said: "You saw
yesterday how large these explosions are. So before we blow them
today, we'll whistle to warn people."</TE>
<TE>   The colonel blew loudly on the whistle, and the general grinned
and nodded his head.</TE>
<TE>   The two commanders discussed how they would find and detonate more
rocket caches that afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "These caches are very dangerous," Rose said when they had
finished.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, yes," Razeq replied. "That's why we don't try to move them."</TE>
<TE>   As the session was ending, Sgt. 1st Class Ruben Garcia walked to
the edge of the landing zone. He noticed a small cave and peered
inside. There, just yards from where the men of Alpha Company had
slept the night before, lay more than 50 neatly stacked and fully
armed rockets, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades.</TE>

<HD>A Soviet Legend Dies Hard</HD>
<DH>Generations were reared on the story of a boy hero murdered
for informing on his father. But nearly everything they learned was
wrong.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>GERASIMOVKA, Russia</DL>
<LD>The story was a fairy tale of sorts, told to generations of Soviet
schoolchildren. Once upon a time, it began, a boy went into the woods
to pick berries.</LD>
<LD>   He was a good boy. He understood right and wrong. When his father
did something wrong, the boy told the authorities. The boy's name was
Pavlik Morozov.</LD>
<LD>   There were bad people in Pavlik's village, including members of
his own family. They did not understand right and wrong. When the boy
went into the woods, the bad people were waiting. And the boy was
never seen alive again.</LD>
<TE>   Pavlik's story wasn't really a fairy tale, though. A real
13-year-old boy named Pavel Morozov was killed along with his little
brother on the outskirts of this Siberian village on Sept. 3, 1932.
Four members of his family -- his grandfather, grandmother, cousin
and godfather -- were convicted of the murders in a show trial two
months later and shot.</TE>
<TE>   Within weeks of his death, Pavlik became a powerful icon in the
new pantheon of Communist saints, a child-martyr worshiped for his
feat of heroism: informing on his father.</TE>
<TE>   Just as American schoolchildren learn the parable of George
Washington and the cherry tree, Soviet students for decades were
taught the morality tale of Pavlik Morozov. For them, the story drove
home the lesson that loyalty to the state should supersede loyalty to
one's family.</TE>
<TE>   The cult of Pavlik Morozov fed a culture of informants, the
lifeblood of a police state. Pavlik became a favorite of the Soviet
propaganda machine, which described him as chairman of the village's
troop of Communist Young Pioneers and officially dubbed him
"Pioneer-Hero #1." Poems, books and even an opera were written about
him.</TE>
<TE>   To this day, Pavlik Morozov is a household name.</TE>
<TE>   "Be like Pavlik, children were told from the moment they took the
oath as pioneers," the Tribuna newspaper wrote this year on the
anniversary of his death. "Study hard, love your motherland, expose
the enemies of Soviet power, and be merciless with traitors."</TE>
<TE>   For most of Soviet history, few questioned the accuracy of the
legend of Pavlik. After all, in the Soviet Union, propaganda was
truth.</TE>
<TE>   Privately, those who permitted themselves to doubt assumed the
story was exaggerated. But for most of Soviet history, it didn't
matter if it was true or not.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, though, a few people -- a writer and an engineer among
them -- started asking questions.</TE>
<TE>   Their search for answers would uncover unpleasant truths not just
about Russia's past but about its unsettled present. It would reveal
how the machinery of terror once operated and how its culture of fear
lingers still.</TE>
<TE>   This is the story of the tale of Pavlik Morozov, who was a real
boy after all. And whose death still haunts a country not yet at
peace with its past.</TE>
<TE>   The Writer</TE>
<TE>   Once upon a time, there lived a Soviet writer named Yuri
Druzhnikov. In 1974, he attended a conference of playwrights in the
southern Russian city of Rostov. One session discussed the importance
of "positive heroes of Soviet culture." One of those heroes was
Pavlik Morozov.</TE>
<TE>   "How can we create a strong morality of people in our country on
the basis of someone who betrayed his father?" Druzhnikov, now 69,
recalled asking. "No one answered."</TE>
<TE>   When he was back home in Moscow days later, his telephone rang. A
voice "invited" him to KGB headquarters. When he arrived, two KGB
officers were waiting.</TE>
<TE>   "They said to me: 'Why did you ask about this official hero? He is
still a hero, and it's none of your business,' " Druzhnikov said. "
'You may write your books,' they said, 'But do not touch this
subject.' "</TE>
<TE>   The KGB warning only whetted Druzhnikov's curiosity. He started at
libraries and archives but turned up next to nothing -- no artifacts
from Pavlik's life, no school records, no legal documents connected
to the case -- just newspaper stories that, more often than not,
contradicted one another.</TE>
<TE>   Druzhnikov found something else puzzling. All the photos of Pavlik
looked different.</TE>
<TE>   "I quickly concluded that all the material was falsified," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Posing as a journalist, Druzhnikov began to track down and
interview Pavlik's now-elderly schoolmates and neighbors, his
teachers and local officials. He traveled to 13 cities around the
Soviet Union. He visited Gerasimovka, the village where Pavlik lived
and died.</TE>
<TE>   At first, villagers recited the official version of the story.</TE>
<TE>   Pavlik was a model student and head of the Young Pioneers. His
father was head of the village's governing council, or soviet. Pavlik
caught his father falsifying safe conduct passes for dispossessed
peasants. He told authorities, and his father was taken away.</TE>
<TE>   Some months later, Pavlik went into the forest to pick cranberries
with his 8-year-old brother, Fedya. They didn't come home. On the
third day, villagers found their bodies.</TE>
<TE>   Pavlik had been stabbed near his heart, his berries spilled on the
forest floor. Fedya was lying a short distance away. He also had
knife wounds, and his skull was shattered.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, an investigator from the OGPU, the forerunner of
the KGB, arrived in the village. He arrested Pavlik's grandparents,
19-year-old cousin and godfather, who was married to Pavlik's aunt.
He accused them of being kulaks, or "rich peasants," and of opposing
plans to form a collective farm in the village. He said he found a
bloodied knife in the grandparents' cottage.</TE>
<TE>   The four were brought to the regional capital, Tavda, and
sentenced to death after a trial that consisted mostly of workers and
party activists calling for their executions. Their crime was among
the most serious on the Soviet books: Article 58.8, terrorism against
the state.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, as the villagers continued to talk to Druzhnikov, the
story began to change.</TE>
<TE>   Pavlik was actually called "Pashka" by his family and friends,
they said, a different diminutive of the name Pavel. He wasn't really
a model student. He was a mischief-maker who could barely read.</TE>
<TE>   His father had abandoned his mother and their four boys for
another woman in the village. The fatherless family was poor and
often without food, and Pashka and Fedya, the two oldest, were
picking berries because they were hungry. The mother was slovenly and
consumed by bitterness. It was she who urged Pashka to denounce his
father, perhaps in revenge, perhaps in a last-ditch effort to shame
the older man into returning to the family.</TE>
<TE>   The villagers told Druzhnikov that Pashka was never a Young
Pioneer. In fact, there was no Pioneer troop in Gerasimovka before
the murders.</TE>
<TE>   "No, Pavlik Morozov had never been a Pioneer," schoolteacher
Yelena Pozdnina told Druzhnikov. "But you must understand one thing:
It was necessary to believe that he was."</TE>
<TE>   The Engineer</TE>
<TE>   Once upon a time, there lived an engineer named Innokenty
Khlebnikov. He worked in an electric power station in Kurgan, a
down-at-the-heels industrial city in western Siberia.</TE>
<TE>   His great-grandfather had been a Cossack who fought his way across
Siberia in the 19th century, helping claim and hold that vast
territory for Russia. Khlebnikov, 68, was born in one of the empire's
farther-flung outposts, the former gold-mining region of Chita. His
parents were simple collective-farm workers.</TE>
<TE>   Khlebnikov studied at a military institute and, when Soviet
dictator Josef Stalin died in 1953, served in an honor guard beside a
bust draped in mourning. Standing vigil, he began to recall the
stories his mother had told him about their many relatives who had
died in Stalin's crackdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "As I stood there, an inner protest began," he recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Years later, as the Soviet Union was collapsing in 1991, a new law
gave Russians the right to seek justice for those who had disappeared
or been repressed during the brutal years of Stalinism. Family
members could apply for them to be officially "rehabilitated" --
posthumously acquitted of the false charges for which they'd been
punished. Khlebnikov spent several years getting his forebears
rehabilitated.</TE>
<TE>   His success emboldened him.</TE>
<TE>   The central street in Kurgan is named for a slain Young Pioneer
named Kolya Myagotin. According to Soviet legend, Kolya told
authorities where kulaks were hiding grain. He became "Pioneer-Hero
#2" -- the first of dozens of successors to Pavlik Morozov.</TE>
<TE>   Kolya was killed, allegedly by the kulaks, on Oct. 25, 1932 --
seven weeks after the death of Pavlik. Twelve people were punished
under the same statute as Pavlik's alleged murderers: terrorism
against the state. Three were executed, and the others were sent into
the gulag.</TE>
<TE>   When Khlebnikov inquired years later, local villagers acknowledged
that the story of Kolya Myagotin was untrue. The boy had been
stealing sunflower seeds in a field when a soldier shot at something
moving in the dark, they told a colleague of Khlebnikov's.</TE>
<TE>   When the body was found in the morning, the myth-making began. It
was easy, because Pavlik Morozov was all the rage. The pattern had
been set.</TE>
<TE>   In various legal petitions, Khlebnikov applied to local
authorities for the rehabilitation of Kolya Myagotin's alleged
murderers. In 1996, the Russian Supreme Court ruled that the murder
had not been an act of state terrorism after all.</TE>
<TE>   The case, the court said, had been fabricated. Kolya Myagotin had
never been a Pioneer. There was no evidence that he had informed on
anybody. The court posthumously rehabilitated all but two of those
convicted, and their convictions were downgraded.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling convinced Khlebnikov to look at the story of Pavlik
Morozov. If Kolya Myagotin's story was untrue, why not Pavlik's?</TE>
<TE>   In February 1997, Khlebnikov took a half-sheet of paper and wrote
out a petition to the regional court with jurisdiction over
Gerasimovka. He asked it to rehabilitate Pavlik's family.</TE>
<TE>   Two years and two months later, he got an answer, not from the
regional court but the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.</TE>
<TE>   "We consider [the defendants] properly convicted in this case and
undeserving of rehabilitation," the court wrote in its decision.</TE>
<TE>   Khlebnikov was flabbergasted.</TE>
<TE>   "The way the case was structured in 1932, that's exactly the way
the court upheld it," Khlebnikov said. "They can't reconsider the
case. They can't destroy the 'truth.' "</TE>
<TE>   The Old Woman</TE>
<TE>   Once upon a time, there lived an old woman named Matryona
Shatrakova. She had a secret.</TE>
<TE>   "If I tell the truth, they'll take me away," she used to tell her
children.</TE>
<TE>   Matryona grew up in Gerasimovka. Her father was among the
wealthier peasants in the village. Her younger cousin was a scamp
named Pashka Morozov. He was always hanging around looking for
mischief, or a bite to eat.</TE>
<TE>   "We would feed those boys, clothe them," she recalled decades
later. "We felt sorry for them."</TE>
<TE>   In 1932, Matryona was 19. Dmitri Shatrakov, a boy in the village,
was in love with her.</TE>
<TE>   One morning, Dmitri stopped by while Matryona was making pancake
batter. He decided to do some hunting while breakfast was cooking and
headed into the woods. Suddenly, his dog started barking wildly. He
followed the sound and saw the bodies of Pashka and his brother.</TE>
<TE>   Dmitri ran back to the village and told the boys' grandmother. A
group of villagers carried the bodies from the woods. The next day,
Matryona's father, who was Pashka's godfather, presided over their
funerals.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, authorities arrested Dmitri and his brother on
suspicion of murder. They were locked in a stock house for two weeks
before suddenly being freed.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities then took away Pashka's grandparents and cousin and
Matryona's father. The Shatrakovs were too poor to be kulaks, their
neighbors said. But the others weren't.</TE>
<TE>   Fear engulfed the village. Matryona remembers that her mother
wouldn't even leave the house. But worse was still to come.</TE>
<TE>   Several weeks later, villagers learned that the four had been
executed. Then authorities took away Matryona's mother. They seized
the house and the livestock, saying they were now property of the
collective farm. Matryona and her younger brother had nowhere to go.</TE>
<TE>   "They threw us into the street like cats," she said.</TE>
<TE>   People began calling her cousin Pavlik, not Pashka. And everyone
was saying strange things, untrue things. They were saying Pavlik had
been a Pioneer. They were saying that Pavlik's family had resented
his work for the Communists, that Matryona's father and his
grandfather had threatened to kill him unless he stopped. They were
saying that her father had paid 30 rubles for the murder -- a sum
oddly reminiscent of Judas Iscariot's 30 pieces of silver.</TE>
<TE>   "No one in the village had any gold. What gold could there be?"
Matryona said. "We all wore lapti" -- shoes made of woven reeds.</TE>
<TE>   To save herself, she married Dmitri, son of a poor peasant, who
was politically correct under Bolshevik ideology. Still, because
Matryona's father had been labeled a kulak, the village's new
collective farm excluded the young couple.</TE>
<TE>   In 1935, Matryona and Dmitri walked away from Gerasimovka carrying
their new baby. They walked 30 miles to the next town, where they
found work in a lumber mill.</TE>
<TE>   They remained there for the rest of their lives. And they kept
quiet about Pavlik.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, a Pioneer troop would invite Dmitri to talk about
how he found the murdered body of "Pioneer-Hero No. 1." He would go
-- refusal was unwise -- but would say as little as possible. Until
he died in 1977, Dmitri could never forget how close he had come to
being blamed for the crime.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, when Matryona was 86, a group of strangers knocked on her
door. She lived alone; her children had families of their own. She
opened the door.</TE>
<TE>   One of her visitors was an archivist from Tavda. About six months
earlier, Matryona had asked for her help in learning where her father
was buried. Another was Innokenty Khlebnikov, who had heard of
Matryona from the archivist.</TE>
<TE>   "When I submitted my petition, I didn't know about you,"
Khlebnikov said, shaking his head. "I would have included you as a
witness. But I thought everyone was already dead."</TE>
<TE>   Matryona was frightened. Her tiny house was suddenly full of
people, including a reporter. Her heart began to palpitate. But she
took some medicine, listened for a while and then began to speak.</TE>
<TE>   "What do I care now?" she said. "I'll die all the same."</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, she told her story to strangers.</TE>
<TE>   "Pavlik wasn't a Pioneer," she said. "He was no Pioneer. I can
tell you that precisely. They trapped [my father]. It was this Ivan,
some sort of relative. He was the one who trapped him."</TE>
<TE>   Then the name came floating back into her memory. "Potupchik," she
said. "He's the one who trapped my father."</TE>
<TE>   Khlebnikov took out a sheet of paper and began to write. He would
use the information to send a new petition to the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   "I hereby declare that in our family there was no gold, that my
father was a simple peasant, and he did not organize the murder of
Pavel Morozov," he wrote on her behalf. "I beseech you to carefully
reconsider the case of the murder of Pavel Morozov."</TE>
<TE>   He handed the pen to Matryona.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still illiterate," she said. "But I can sign my name."</TE>
<TE>   With the tentativeness of a child and the unsteadiness of an old
woman, she scratched out one barely legible word: "Shatrakova."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly two years later, in February 2001, Matryona Shatrakova's
heart gave out and she died.</TE>
<TE>   The following May, nearly three years after Matryona had signed
her appeal, a postman arrived with a certified letter from the
Supreme Court of the Russian Federation. Her daughter told the
postman her mother was dead. He refused to deliver the letter.</TE>
<TE>   The Secret Agent</TE>
<TE>   Once upon a time, there lived an OGPU agent named Spiridon
Kartashov, who was called in by the secret police to take charge of
the Pavlik Morozov case. In 1982, Druzhnikov, the curious writer,
found him living in a squalid apartment 120 miles from Gerasimovka.</TE>
<TE>   The onetime agent told Druzhnikov that after the Bolshevik
Revolution, he had served in a "special action" squad that executed
Red Army deserters during the civil war. By 1932, the revolution
begun by the Bolsheviks in the cities had finally engulfed the
countryside, and Kartashov had a new assignment.</TE>
<TE>   Stalin had ordered a massive drive to force peasants onto
collective farms. Those who resisted were labeled kulaks and stripped
of their livestock and other property. Millions of them were shipped
to Siberia in cattle cars.</TE>
<TE>   "We have switched to a policy of eliminating the kulaks as a
class," Stalin decreed.</TE>
<TE>   Collectivization was a holocaust for the Russian peasantry. At
least 6 million died during the drive to form collective farms, and
at least 5 million more perished in the famine that followed.</TE>
<TE>   Some kulaks forced out of European Russia wound up near
Gerasimovka -- an inhospitable village surrounded by equal parts
forest and swamp. Some villagers helped the new arrivals, perhaps out
of sympathy, perhaps to keep them out. One of those who helped was
Pavlik's father, who as chairman of the village council provided them
with transit papers that allowed them to settle elsewhere or seek
jobs in forestry or construction. Presumably, he collected a "fee"
for the service.</TE>
<TE>   The villagers, meanwhile, were balking at efforts to form a
collective farm. Pavlik's grandfather was among the village elders
who vociferously resisted joining the collective. In fact, there was
only one Communist sympathizer in Gerasimovka, Pavlik's 20-year-old
cousin, Ivan Potupchik.</TE>
<TE>   Potupchik, who was also an informant for the OGPU, led the group
of villagers who recovered the bodies of the boys in the woods, and
he hosted Kartashov when he arrived to handle the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Kartashov told Druzhnikov that he had been given a quota for how
many peasants to "de-kulakize" in the region. Gerasimovka, he said,
was of special interest because resistance there was so fierce. In
the months before the murders, with Potupchik's help, he had already
prepared a list of villagers who were anti-Soviet.</TE>
<TE>   Kartashov said no real investigation of the murders was warranted.</TE>
<TE>   "Persons of an anti-Soviet persuasion already on the lists ... it
was they who killed the children," he said. "I never went to the
murder site because everything was already clear."</TE>
<TE>   The cousin, Potupchik, was honored for his work on the Morozov
case but eventually ran into trouble. He was convicted of raping a
teenage girl in 1961, was imprisoned for a time and eventually
settled in the Siberian city of Magnitogorsk, where Druzhnikov met
with him in the early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Potupchik, too, said there was no real investigation -- no formal
examination of the murder scene, no autopsies. Potupchik simply told
the OGPU whom to arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "A group of investigators ... came and immediately announced that
'a terrorist act took place here,' " Potupchik told Druzhnikov. "They
took those I pointed out. No sort of experts were needed. It was that
clear."</TE>
<TE>   Druzhnikov was now convinced that Kartashov, with Potupchik's
help, had organized the boys' murders to try to frighten the village
into joining the collective farm. He believes they had the blessing
of Stalin's personal secret police.</TE>
<TE>   "In the Urals, collectivization was going particularly badly,"
Druzhnikov said. "So [OGPU agents] went to the village and wanted to
do something. The idea was to frighten people."</TE>
<TE>   If that was their plan, it worked.</TE>
<TE>   Both Kartashov and Potupchik are dead now. But near the end of his
life, apparently as part of an appeal to raise his pension, Kartashov
penned a description of his role in the case. The document, now in
the archives of the historical museum in Tavda, suggests the
collective farm was formed just after the murders. Kartashov says he
called the fearful villagers together the same day Pavlik's family
was sent away for trial.</TE>
<TE>   "I recounted for them the murder of the Pioneer Pavlik Morozov by
the kulaks of the village of Gerasimovka -- who killed him, where,
how and why," Kartashov wrote. "I said that in honor of the murdered
Pioneer Pavlik Morozov, a collective farm should be organized and
named in Pavlik Morozov's honor. Those who were there signed up."</TE>
<TE>   The Prosecutor</TE>
<TE>   Once upon a time, there lived a prosecutor named Nikolai Vlasenko.
He is deputy director of the Rehabilitations Department of the
Russian general prosecutor's office in Moscow. His department has
considered more than 500,000 requests for rehabilitation since 1991,
and the vast majority of them have been granted.</TE>
<TE>   It was his job to review the Pavlik Morozov case.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the most savage and extreme crime possible," Vlasenko said
late this summer. "To take your own grandchildren and slice them
open? That's what we know, and that's all we need to know."</TE>
<TE>   Vlasenko said that, unlike many other cases from the period, the
Pavlik Morozov file is crammed with documents -- interrogation
reports and other court papers, letters and telegrams of outrage from
workers, Pioneers and ordinary citizens across the Soviet Union
calling for the death of Pavlik's murderers.</TE>
<TE>   In Vlasenko's view, all the documents support the conclusion that
the boy was murdered by his relatives in a terrorist act against the
state.</TE>
<TE>   "There are interrogations, residents, witnesses, participants.
Direct evidence," he said. "Don't drag politics into this. It was a
terrorist act."</TE>
<TE>   Vlasenko acknowledged that he and his colleagues accepted the
documents at face value. In their deliberations, they didn't ask if
OGPU investigators might have falsified anything. They didn't
consider new information, including the evidence compiled by
Druzhnikov. Although they have done so in other cases, they didn't
take into consideration the political atmosphere of the early 1930s,
the pressure on local officials and the OGPU to succeed at
collectivization.</TE>
<TE>   No, he said. His only job was to consider the documents in the
file.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot conclude that the investigators at that time were not
honest and upright," Vlasenko insisted. "I'll go further. The
majority were very decent people carrying out their duties."</TE>
<TE>   Vlasenko conceded that Pavlik was probably never a Pioneer but
said it matters little. Indeed, Vlasenko insisted it is still correct
to consider Pavlik a "representative of state authority" and his
murder a "terrorist act against the state."</TE>
<TE>   "He was a social activist, even though he was just a teenager,"
Vlasenko said. "He was the only one of his family worthy of
imitation, the only upright person."</TE>
<TE>   Vlasenko dismissed the suggestion that new evidence could justify
reopening the case.</TE>
<TE>   "The court has made its judgment," he said. "This is my position.
There's no wiggle room."</TE>
<TE>   The Unhappy Ending</TE>
<TE>   Fairy tales are supposed to end "happily ever after." But
Gerasimovka is not a happy place.</TE>
<TE>   For a while, it was. After the death of Pavlik Morozov,
authorities turned Gerasimovka into a model collective farm. They
paved a road to the village -- a rarity in the region -- and tour
buses of Pioneer pilgrims came to pay homage at the small Pavlik
Morozov Museum and at what is supposed to be his grave site.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember we used to stand on the side of the road and salute
like this," Marina Fokina, a 30-year-old villager said, snapping her
hand to her forehead in the traditional palm-forward pioneer salute.
"Of course, we're sad it's over."</TE>
<TE>   Fokina said she once had a job. But the Pavlik Morozov Collective
Farm has fallen on hard times, slowly selling off most of its cows
and laying off most workers. The town has no other businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Fokina, like many of Gerasimovka's unemployed, spends her day
looking for something to drink. Her face and legs are dirty, her nose
permanently bent from an untreated break.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, no one used to drink at all. Now, I've been on a bender
for a week," she said. "What else am I supposed to do?"</TE>
<TE>   The Pavlik Morozov Museum is closed. Animal droppings litter the
lawn. But inside, the classroom where Pavlik is said to have studied
still has portraits of Lenin and Stalin on the walls and a bust of
Pavlik in the corner.</TE>
<TE>   The museum's caretaker, Tatiana Kuznetsova, is thinking of turning
the building into a museum of collectivization. She is the keeper of
Pavlik Morozov's flame, but even she no longer knows why it burns.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many versions that my head has turned to mush," she
said. "But the version that his grandfather and grandmother killed
him -- that's just not possible."</TE>
<TE>   Still, few here hold out much hope that the truth will ever be
discovered.</TE>
<TE>   "No one will find the truth," said 57-year-old resident Nadezhda
Kortuzova. "Where would you look for it?"</TE>
<TE>   Although many documents in the case have leaked out over the
years, the entire KGB case file has never been made available to
anyone outside the special services or the judiciary. The KGB's
successor agency, the FSB, denying a request for access, described
the 70-year-old case as "still open."</TE>
<TE>   Those who would like to see the case reconsidered, like
Druzhnikov, blame the security services for the official resistance.
Russia experienced a few dizzy years of openness after the Soviet
collapse, they note, but by the mid-1990s, the FSB was resurgent.</TE>
<TE>   The FSB's power has only grown under President Vladimir V. Putin,
himself a former agency director who has openly praised the legacy of
the secret police and appointed KGB veterans to top civilian posts
outside the agency. Putin was head of the FSB when the Supreme Court
decided to uphold the convictions in the Morozov case.</TE>
<TE>   "Our current leader, he loves these myths," said Arseny Roginsky,
a historian and chairman of the human rights group Memorial. "He is a
Soviet person."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Roginsky said, there may be a larger problem than FSB
control.</TE>
<TE>   Most Russians, he said, are preoccupied with the hardships of the
current day and find questions of historical justice irrelevant. And
most, he said, are still affected by a national "mania for secrecy."</TE>
<TE>   "In this country, you must understand that people lived through
many decades in which everything was secret," he said. "It will be
many years before that changes."</TE>
<TE>   For now, Russians are left to draw their own conclusions about
Pavlik Morozov.</TE>
<TE>   Druzhnikov, now a professor of Russian and German at UC Davis, is
convinced that the secret police murdered the brothers and
constructed the myth of Pavlik Morozov to glorify informers.</TE>
<TE>   Khlebnikov blames the KGB as well but believes the government hid
the truth out of contempt for the peasantry and other poor folk.</TE>
<TE>   And there are Russians like historian Lev Sonin, who believes it's
possible that Pavlik's family killed him after all. To Sonin, the
identity of the murderers is less important than the immoral way the
Soviet system exploited the case.</TE>
<TE>   "The entire point of the case of Pavlik Morozov was to drive a
wedge into the family, to separate parents from their children,"
Sonin said. "It's inhuman to use the blood of children for this
purpose."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Roginsky believes truth will triumph in the end. He
notes that it took postwar Germany at least 20 years to begin to
wrestle with the Nazi legacy, and says Russia needs a period of
stability at least that long before it will be ready to come to terms
with Stalinism.</TE>
<TE>   "Sooner or later, society will have to address this," Roginsky
said. "Slowly, slowly, Soviet history will return."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Pavlik Morozov and his family are trapped in a
kind of historical limbo -- neither heroes nor villains, both demons
and saints.</TE>

<HD>Politician Works to Lead Turkey</HD>
<DH>Banned head of party with Islamic roots appears set on
clearing hurdles to premiership.</DH>

<DL>ANKARA, Turkey</DL>
<LD>Setting the stage for a confrontation with this nation's pro-secular
president, the leader of an Islamic-rooted party that won recent
elections suggested Monday that he would seek to surmount legal
obstacles and become the next prime minister.</LD>
<LD>   Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the leader of the Justice and Development
Party, or AKP, was banned from running in the Nov. 3 election because
of a 1998 conviction on sedition charges. However, he pointed out to
reporters here that parliament could amend the constitution, allowing
him to assume the premiership of this officially secular but
predominantly Muslim nation of 66 million.</LD>
<LD>   "Certain anti-democratic situations will be remedied," Erdogan
said. "It is the duty of the political establishment to overcome a
problem that contradicts the national will."</LD>
<TE>   Erdogan's remarks came a day after President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, a
former judge, made clear his opposition to any moves to tamper with
the constitution. "Rather than politicizing the law, politics should
be conducted in conformity with the law," Sezer said at an official
function here that also was attended by Erdogan.</TE>
<TE>   Modern Turkey was founded in 1923 by Kemal Ataturk, who imposed a
secular and European-oriented vision on the Muslim nation. The
Turkish military has guarded that policy ever since.</TE>
<TE>   The AKP, which during the campaign carefully avoided mention of
Islam and focused instead on pocketbook issues, is poised to form
Turkey's first single-party government since 1987 after winning
control of the 550-seat parliament. With 363 seats, it is four short
of a two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution without
having to resort to a referendum. But the party is counting on
support from nine independents.</TE>
<TE>   Erdogan was convicted in 1998 of religious sedition after publicly
reciting a poem the government regards as radical. Several scenarios
are being debated by AKP leaders to clear the way for him to become
prime minister. One plan would involve amending a law under which
only elected members of parliament qualify for the post.</TE>
<TE>   Another idea would be to wait until his ban on holding public
office expires in March and then call by-elections, in which Erdogan
would win a seat in parliament. But that in turn would require
amending another article of the constitution, which specifies that a
person convicted of carrying out or promoting "ideological" or
"anarchic" offenses be barred from the legislative body.</TE>
<TE>   In either case, the AKP needs to agree on a candidate within its
ranks to fill the premiership for at least the short term. The most
widely touted choice is the party's deputy chairman, Abdullah Gul,
who is popular with the rank and file.</TE>
<TE>   The AKP is expected to submit a name soon after parliament
convenes Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Erdogan began his political career in the overtly pro-Islamic
Welfare Party, which was forced from power by the military in 1997.
He has since disavowed his Islamist past. Today he insists that he is
a "conservative democrat" who does not believe in mixing religion
with politics.</TE>
<TE>   Since the AKP's victory, Erdogan has been behaving like the prime
minister and is being treated with respect by Western leaders, who
have been buoyed by his pledges to accelerate reforms that could
secure Turkey's membership in the European Union. He is set to begin
a tour of Europe Wednesday to lobby leaders on EU accession.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Erdogan's personal popularity that steered the AKP to
power," said Bulent Aliriza, a prominent Turkey specialist at the
Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. "His
popular mandate cannot be contested. I believe a compromise [on the
prime minister post] will be struck in the coming days, because that
is what the Turkish people expect and demand."</TE>

<HD>Long Beach Man Arrested in 'Belmont Shore Rapist' Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Wride and Jose Cardenas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Long Beach man whose job history includes Christmas tree
deliveryman and supermarket bag boy has been arrested as the
suspected sexual predator responsible for attacking 31 women in
Southern California and Seattle, police announced Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Police had pleaded with the public for extra vigilance after the
latest attack last week, but Long Beach Police Chief Anthony W. Batts
on Monday credited old-fashioned police work for the arrest of Mark
Wayne Rathbun, 32.</LD>
<LD>   "To the city of Long Beach, I say, 'Sleep well tonight, sleep
well,' " Batts said at a news conference where the arrest and
investigation were detailed. "We believe we have the Belmont Shore
serial rapist."</LD>
<TE>   It was not Rathbun's first arrest by Long Beach police. Batts said
Rathbun was arrested as a 17-year-old on suspicion of being a peeping
Tom, and Deputy Dist. Atty. Rich Goul said Rathbun was convicted in
1998 of felony residential burglary.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years the serial assaults indirectly changed the daily
routines of women living in Belmont Shore and Belmont Heights,
neighborhoods of east Long Beach in which a pattern emerged before
others elsewhere were linked to the same man -- and where he earned
the nickname of the Belmont Shore rapist. Pepper spray was often sold
out at Billings Hardware in the heart of Belmont Shore.</TE>
<TE>   Rathbun lived with his mother on Elm Avenue, about three miles
from Belmont Shore, in an eight-unit apartment house with peeling
paint. "He was a quiet guy, minding his own business," said Juan
Flores, a neighbor who has lived at the complex for a year.</TE>
<TE>   Flores and other neighbors described Rathbun as an idler with no
signs of steady work or of a girlfriend. He could often be seen
playing handball on the side of the building or riding his skateboard
or his bicycle. He also was often seen going off with buddies who
appeared to be surfers.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors came to associate him with his bike -- which Rathbun was
riding when he attracted the attention of police near the crime scene
of the predator's last attack early Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Officers had sealed off the neighborhood and approached three
separate men, including Rathbun, who was arrested on suspicion of
possessing a crack cocaine pipe, Batts said.</TE>
<TE>   Rathbun and his bike stood out: Police had long suspected that a
bicycle was the predator's means of escape because victims rarely, if
ever, saw or heard a vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   While in custody, police said, Rathbun "cooperated" and submitted
a DNA sample but was ultimately released late Friday night after
posting $250 bail.</TE>
<TE>   But police had DNA with which to match considerable DNA evidence
gathered from crime scenes over the years in Long Beach, Los
Alamitos, Huntington Beach and Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   A rush job by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Crime Lab matched
Rathbun's DNA with that collected from Thursday's attempted assault
of a 30-year-old woman near the Long Beach traffic circle. Both DNA
samples have a rare marker, said Dean Gialamas, the assistant crime
lab director.</TE>
<TE>   As lab results were awaited, Long Beach police detectives followed
Rathbun, who made at least two trips from Long Beach to Oxnard and
back, helping a friend move. It would normally take eight to 10
business days to get the DNA results; police had them back in four.</TE>
<TE>   Rathbun was arrested on suspicion of residential burglary with
intent to commit rape, rape and other related charges at 7:45 p.m.
Sunday near Fisherman's Wharf in Oxnard. Rathbun was being held late
Monday without bail and is expected to be arraigned Wednesday in Long
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Police might have been able to connect Rathbun to his earlier
crimes sooner, but collecting DNA samples from suspected felons was
not mandated until a year after Rathbun's last arrest, Goul said.</TE>
<TE>   Rathbun did not have an attorney of record, and his mother was not
available for comment. His mother was described by neighbors as a
sweet woman who looked forward to going to church on Sundays.</TE>
<TE>   Rathbun, whose string of low-paying jobs including working as a
valet parking attendant, did not raise suspicions among neighbors. He
was described as well-spoken, and one neighbor, who declined to give
her name, said he offered helpful advice when she decided to buy a
mountain bike.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very nice," she said. "He brought me a catalog. 'You
should buy this.' "</TE>
<TE>   The only hint of violence that she or other neighbors could
remember occurred when he argued with his mother. "One time he really
yelled at his mom, which made me lose respect for him," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The known attacks attributed to the same man began in Seattle in
May 1996. Similar attacks followed: The man would enter through
unlocked windows and doors, often nude when he finally approached the
victim.</TE>
<TE>   In time, attacks in other cities matched the behavior of the
intruder or the physical evidence in the Long Beach assaults, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   Many women fought off the attacker, scratching or biting him, and
police noticed Rathbun had an injured finger when he was arrested.</TE>
<TE>   A consistent physical description was one thing that detectives
lacked. Victims described the man as having a swimmer's trim build or
being pudgy, of being bald or of having dreadlocks. The predator
always covered his face or that of his victim, and usually covered
his hands, leaving few matchable fingerprints, police said.</TE>
<TE>   But Seattle police had a composite sketch of a suspect based on
the description of a victim in that city, and Batts said Monday that
Rathbun bears a strong resemblance to it.</TE>
<TE>   In his booking photo, Rathbun's hair is wiry and dark brown, with
nappy dreadlocks at the base of his skull. He has a mustache and
beard and is 5-feet-10 and 220 pounds, Sgt. Paul LeBaron said.</TE>
<TE>   Police have said that DNA evidence linked 13 of 31 attacks, and
although that evidence did not necessarily help locate a suspect, it
may be key to convicting one.</TE>
<TE>   It was DNA that led to the release four years ago of Jeffrey Allen
Grant, a city of Long Beach employee wrongly accused of the assaults.
Grant spent three months in jail until DNA testing -- on the eve of
trial -- exonerated him. Two witnesses had insisted that they had
seen him at a crime scene.</TE>
<TE>   Grant, who still works for the city running its parks and
recreation softball program, was engaged at the time, and his fiance
and family steadfastly insisted that he was innocent.</TE>
<TE>   A federal jury in 2000 awarded Grant $1.7 million in damages.</TE>
<TE>   There was great relief as news of a suspect's arrest spread
Monday, but police cautioned that people should maintain their
safeguards. "Women should still be careful, still lock windows and
doors," said Long Beach police spokeswoman Nancy Pratt.</TE>

<HD>Bishops Change Tone on Abuse</HD>
<DH>Apologetic stance is replaced by call to defend against
agendas of 'extremists.' Reformer calls new tack a 'slap in the
face.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry B. Stammer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Outside critics and "extremists" within the Catholic church have
exploited the sexual abuse scandal to "advance their own agendas,"
the head of the nation's Roman Catholic bishops charged Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking at the opening of the meeting of the U.S. Conference of
Catholic Bishops, which later this week is scheduled to vote on a
compromise plan for handling abusive priests, Bishop Wilton D.
Gregory of Belleville, Ill., said his fellow clerics should have "no
illusions" about the motives behind some of the attacks on the
church.</LD>
<LD>   "There are those outside the church who are hostile to the very
principles and teaching the church espouses, and have chosen this
moment to advance the acceptance of practices and ways of life that
the church cannot and will never condone," Gregory said.</LD>
<TE>   "Sadly, even among the baptized, there are those at extremes
within the church who have chosen to exploit the vulnerability of the
bishops in this moment to advance their own agendas," he said. "One
cannot fail to hear in the distance -- and sometimes very nearby --
the call of the false prophet, 'Let us strike the shepherd and
scatter the flock.' We bishops need to recognize this call and to
name it clearly for what it is."</TE>
<TE>   Gregory's remarks appeared to mark a new assertiveness among the
bishops after a year of scandal in which roughly 325 of the nation's
46,000 priests have either resigned, retired or been removed from
ministry. The speech brought applause from his fellow bishops,
several of whom echoed his themes in comments of their own.</TE>
<TE>   Archbishop Harry J. Flynn of St. Paul-Minneapolis, chairman of the
bishops' committee that sets policy on sexual abuse, told reporters,
for example, that after a year of focusing on sexual abuse by
priests, the time has come for other segments of society to address
the issue as well.</TE>
<TE>   And Bishop John J. Leibrecht of Springfield-Cape Girardeau, Mo.,
said in an interview that the church needs now to reemphasize
protecting the rights of those priests who are innocent. "We need not
make our [innocent] priests other victims of what's going on," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   In all, the tone of the meeting contrasted sharply with the notes
of contrition Gregory and his colleagues sounded five months ago
when, at the height of the sex-abuse scandal, the bishops met in
Dallas to adopt new policies to protect children from predatory
priests. Then, the speeches focused on apologies. On Monday, the
bishops' remarks suggested that they believe the confessional mood
had gone far enough.</TE>
<TE>   Gregory did not name the groups he had in mind, but several
unofficial Catholic reform organizations have said that the sexual
abuse scandal points to a need for major changes in the church,
including an end to the requirement of celibacy for priests, the
ordination of women and married men, and an expanded role for lay
Catholics in setting church policies.</TE>
<TE>   The head of one such group strongly criticized Gregory's words.
The speech was "a real slap in the face to Catholic lay people," said
David Clohessy, national director of the Survivors Network of Those
Abused by Priests.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very disturbing. He seemed to lash out at unnamed enemies
of the church. It seemed that the conciliatory, remorseful tone of
Dallas was replaced with a more hard-line, almost aggressive tone,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately what many of us see as healthy discussion within
the church on a crucial issue, he apparently views as dangerous
discord. I think the message clearly is, 'We've listened to the lay
people and the survivors, we've drawn up a document and now we're
moving on. End of story.' "</TE>
<TE>   Church officials for weeks have emphasized that they remain
committed to removing abusive priests from the ministry. Gregory and
others repeated that pledge here. But many bishops, as well as
Vatican officials, strongly oppose the idea that the scandal requires
more basic changes in church doctrine or structure.</TE>
<TE>   In his speech, Gregory emphasized an issue that has been of great
importance to the Vatican -- protecting innocent priests from
unfounded allegations and seeing that the accused receive due
process.</TE>
<TE>   "Priests today too often are being unfairly judged by the misdeeds
of other priests, men often long-departed from the ministry or even
deceased," he said. "We need to pay more than lip service to the
truth that the overwhelming majority of priests are faithful servants
of the Lord."</TE>
<TE>   Such a change in tone would not have been possible as little as
six months ago, Bishop Joseph A. Galante of Dallas said afterward.
"He probably could have, but I don't think anybody would have heard
him," Galante said.</TE>
<TE>   The most carefully watched item of business at the bishops'
meeting will be the expected approval of the revised policy on
sexually abusive priests that was worked out last month by four
representatives of the U.S. bishops and Vatican officials.</TE>
<TE>   Some victims' advocacy groups have criticized the revised policy,
saying it is weaker than the original policy approved by the bishops
in June and subsequently rejected by the Vatican.</TE>
<TE>   But the policy won support Monday from Oklahoma Gov. Frank
Keating, chairman of the National Review Committee that the bishops
established in June. Keating told reporters that his initial fears
that the revised policy would allow bishops not to immediately report
sexual abuse to civil authorities had proven groundless.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an unambiguous mandate to report," he said. Overall,
Keating said, "we're satisfied that what was done in Rome is
satisfactory for the preservation of young people ... ."</TE>
<TE>   As they move toward the vote, the bishops conference continues to
debate a related issue -- how to police the behavior of its own
members.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles said he would seek ways to
make bishops more accountable for implementing the zero tolerance
policy on abusive priests. "Obviously they've got to commit
themselves to implement it totally, and if they're unwilling to do
that, I don't see how they can stay."</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Robert H. Brom of San Diego plans to put to a vote a
proposal to establish ways for bishops informally to hold each other
accountable through "fraternal love," Brom said. "This collegiality
will include fraternal support, fraternal charity and fraternal
correction," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony, who has come under criticism from some of his own priests
who have complained about his public statements about zero tolerance,
added that the rights of accused priests must be protected.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to make sure that in dealing with priests that we're very
careful, especially with the degree of the allegation made, to be
very careful that a frivolous allegation doesn't damage the
reputation of the priest," he said.</TE>

<HD>Would-Be Doctor, Faith Healers Who Face Charges Were Touted
by Radio Host</HD>
<DH>Renan Almendarez Coello publicized services on his show.
D.A.'s office says it is not investigating him or the station.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jose Cardenas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Pomona Superior Court, a man who called himself a doctor stands
accused of sexually assaulting numerous women and teenage girls who
went to his El Monte office for treatment.</LD>
<LD>   In Van Nuys Superior Court, two faith healers are accused of
giving a man seeking treatment for a rash an injection that killed
him.</LD>
<LD>   At least some of the alleged victims heard of the would-be doctor
and faith healers through radio host Renan Almendarez Coello, Los
Angeles' top-rated morning host, who recommended their services on
his program.</LD>
<TE>   Known to his audience as El Cucuy de la Manana,  the Boogeyman,
Coello's nationally syndicated Spanish-language show on KSCA-FM
(101.9) is wildly popular in cities in the county with large
Spanish-speaking communities. In the Southern California market, he
outshines talk-show host Howard Stern.</TE>
<TE>   The defendants, Fernando Lozano, 32, and faith healer Reina Isabel
Chavarria, 48, and her assistant, Margarita Montes, 28, were
regularly publicized by Coello. The show, featuring music and raunchy
interactions between Coello and callers, included segments in which
Coello publicized the services of a series of what he called
collaborators.</TE>
<TE>   Coello touted their folk medicine approach to treating ailments.
Lozano was known to callers as Doctor Misterio -- Dr. Mystery.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Lozano faces 19 felony counts and four misdemeanor charges,
including lewd acts upon children and practicing medicine without
certification. He has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled for trial
Dec. 9</TE>
<TE>   The faith healers, Chavarria and Montes, face two felony counts:
involuntary manslaughter and unauthorized practice of medicine out of
Chavarria's Van Nuys home.</TE>
<TE>   Because evidence is still being gathered, and police are seeking
anyone whose health worsened after seeing the faith healers, the Los
Angeles district attorney's office would not comment on the case,
said spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney is not investigating Coello or the radio
station in connection with the charges, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The community affairs director for the Glendale-based station,
Manuel Villasenor, said neither Coello nor anyone there would comment
until the investigation is completed.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever we say might interfere with the proper authorities,"
Villasenor said.</TE>
<TE>   But Coello's show, he said, much like the Howard Stern program, is
entertainment. The show did not mean to offer serious medical advice,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Coello, 48, has a rags-to-riches story. Because he is an immigrant
from Honduras, he likes to help people, said his manager, Fernando
Schiantarelli, who cites Coello's charitable activities that include
raising money for victims of natural disasters in Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   On his show, Coello told listeners that he had tried out the work
of Chavarria and Lozano.</TE>
<TE>   "Dona Reina took away from me a pain," he said in one show this
year. In another segment, he said: "Doctor Misterio is going to give
me a colon cleaning."</TE>
<TE>   "I have faith because I personally try the product on myself," he
said in another segment. "Why? Because I'm not going to recommend to
the community just anybody to help them."</TE>
<TE>   Coello did not think that Lozano and Chavarria were licensed to
practice medicine, Schiantarelli said. The host recommended them for
their alternative-medicine practice, including massages and herbs.</TE>
<TE>   Schiantarelli said Coello never gave out Lozano or Chavarria's
phone numbers or addresses over the air. Instead, he recommended them
to individual callers.</TE>
<TE>   "His intent was to help," said Schiantarelli. "There was no
malice."</TE>
<TE>   According to authorities, neither Chavarria nor Montes had the
credentials required to give Roberto Caceres, 54, of Santa Ana the
injection that allegedly killed him.</TE>
<TE>   In Lozano's case, authorities said, he sexually abused people in
his office, including minors. One alleged victim was a 15-year-old
girl who sought treatment for stomach pains.</TE>
<TE>   Schiantarelli said Coello feels bad about the allegations, but "he
cannot be held responsible for what people do beyond what he knows."</TE>

<HD>Owner Says House Is Awash in Problems Since Water Main
Break</HD>
<DH>Mar Vista resident says DWP has failed to fix damage caused
by a broken pipe two years ago. Los Angeles is disputing the claims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Pool</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The flood waters receded 23 months ago. Anger is what is brimming
over at Penny Amic's house these days.</LD>
<LD>   The Mar Vista resident said Los Angeles utility officials have
abandoned her after a water main in front of her house burst and
inundated her property with thousands of gallons of water.</LD>
<LD>   The gusher flooded her backyard and the crawl space beneath her
home, then trapped water burst through a concrete-block retaining
wall and cascaded down a hill behind her house, carrying the wall,
20-year-old trees, landscaping and part of the yard with it.</LD>
<TE>   We're sorry; we'll take care of it, Amic said Department of Water
and Power leaders promised her after city crews repaired the broken
pipe beneath Biona Drive on Dec. 12, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But as a third winter rainy season arrives, Amic complains that
the city has failed to repair her house or restore the yard that all
but washed away. A series of bad El Nino storms could polish her off,
she contends.</TE>
<TE>   Besides washing away a chunk of her backyard, the flood weakened
her three-bedroom home's foundation, meaning her house could be in
jeopardy of sliding down the hill if there are unusually heavy
storms, Amic said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Department of Water and Power took my $650,000 house and
destroyed it," said the former preschool teacher. "The owner down
below me has come up and pounded on my door and said I've got to fix
the damage before more of my property falls on his place."</TE>
<TE>   Amic's claim is one of several stemming from the water main
rupture. Her next-door neighbors have complained that their home has
developed mold because of the flood. They've moved out.</TE>
<TE>   City lawyers deny that they are stalling on paying for repairs. In
fact, "the claims are on what's called the fast track," said Eskel H.
Solomon, a deputy city attorney who works with the DWP.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe Ms. Amic is asking too much for the damage we caused.
I'm not going to make a gift of public funds; it ain't going to
happen," he said. "There are no $650,000 homes in her neighborhood.
Her house isn't $650,000."</TE>
<TE>   Though house sale prices for Amic's neighborhood are not
available, the median selling price for her ZIP Code in September was
$435,000, according to the California Assn. of Realtors.</TE>
<TE>   Solomon said the city disputes that Amic's house suffered
structural damage from the flood. And the neighbors' mold complaint
may be all wet too, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an indication of previous mold. Only in the last six to
nine months I'm seeing mold allegations. I don't know if it's the
cause celebre of the year or something."</TE>
<TE>   As for Amic's partly eroded backyard, she'd better get busy
repairing it herself if she is worried that it will collapse in a
rainstorm, Solomon said.</TE>
<TE>   "If she is concerned about damages, she should take steps to
mitigate against further damage," he said. Pending the outcome of
this claim, "she's got a duty to mitigate against further problems."</TE>
<TE>   Amic said she can't afford to hire geologists to restore the
backyard slope because she is a single, stay-at-home mother to two
sons, ages 11 and 19.</TE>
<TE>   Amic said the city's slow response in paying for the neighborhood
damage is especially irksome in light of officials' response after
the flood. According to Amic, a city lawyer who inspected the damage
commented: "Good God! We destroyed her house!"</TE>
<TE>   The city attorney's office denies that. "I spoke to the attorney
involved. That is a total misstatement," Solomon said.</TE>
<TE>   Amic said that several hours before the water main rupture, the
Fire Department had been called to investigate a water leak in the
street.</TE>
<TE>   "They reported it to the DWP and were told, 'We have only a
skeleton crew, and we're not coming out to fix it tonight,' " she
said.</TE>
<TE>   The city's lawyers said they are irritated at Amic for writing
letters about the situation to Gov. Gray Davis, Mayor James K. Hahn,
DWP General Manager David Wiggs, City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo, and
members of the City Council and county Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   It's a breach of protocol to try to get politicians involved
before all administrative remedies are exhausted, they said.</TE>
<TE>   But don't plan on a quick settlement, the officials suggested. A
mediation session on claims by Biona Drive residents, which had been
planned for Wednesday, has been postponed until Dec. 9.</TE>
<TE>   And, looking ahead, the city has penciled in a March 18 Superior
Court trial date.</TE>

<HD>Troubled Kids Find Haven, Heartfelt Help at Canteen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mitchell Landsberg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Life on the street isn't so bad, mused Jessica, a 19-year-old who has
been homeless for the last year. "You kind of learn to deal with it."
There are friends, and good times and an independence that's hard for
a teenager to find anywhere else. On the streets of Hollywood, "every
night's a different story."</LD>
<LD>   That was what she said at first.</LD>
<LD>   Only later, after relating her harrowing life story to a stranger,
did Jessica (not her real name) admit that her life as a homeless
teen is sometimes unbearable. Had she ever tried to kill herself?
Yes, she said. When was the last time?</LD>
<TE>   "Yesterday," she said. Carefully rolling up the sleeve of her
black sweatshirt, she revealed an ugly, fresh razor gash on her
wrist.</TE>
<TE>   If there is a positive force in Jessica's life, it is the Teen
Canteen, a drop-in center run by the Travelers Aid Society of Los
Angeles. Here, just off Hollywood Boulevard, she finds safety,
home-cooked food, a shower and a washing machine, used clothing, an
Internet-ready computer, medical referrals and, perhaps most
important, counseling toward a better life.</TE>
<TE>   "Teen Canteen's cool," she said. "They don't treat you like you're
lesser than them. They treat you like you're anybody else."</TE>
<TE>   Most people know the Travelers Aid Society for its booth at Los
Angeles International Airport, where volunteers help nearly a million
passengers a year find transportation, lodging and other services.
But the organization does much more. Founded locally in 1922, the
Travelers Aid Society also provides extensive services to the
homeless, both adults and teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   The society received a $15,000 grant this year from the Los
Angeles Times Holiday Campaign, which raises money for nonprofits in
Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties.</TE>
<TE>   The money is badly needed, according to Donald Sanders, director
of youth services for Travelers Aid. Donations declined after the
Sept. 11 attacks, as they did for many local charities. Meanwhile,
demand for services at the Teen Canteen has sharply increased. The
influx of new clients more than doubled between September 2001 and
this September.</TE>
<TE>   The canteen's clients, who range in age from 12 to 24, are victims
of a checklist of social problems: sexual abuse, drug abuse,
abandonment, homelessness, mental illness. They are, Sanders said,
America's "throwaway children."</TE>
<TE>   Many resist help, but canteen staff members are patient.
Eventually, he said, most of the kids "reach a breaking point and
say, 'Help me. I'm tired of this.' "</TE>

<HD>3 Area Residents Die in Mexico Crash</HD>
<DH>Five more are injured when a bus hits the vacationing
victims' van near Puerto Vallarta.</DH>

<AU>John L. Mitchell and Daniel Hernandez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three people were killed and five others injured, all from the
Pasadena area, when a bus hit their van and landed on top of it near
the resort city of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, authorities said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Pasadena residents David C. Haber, Judith McNiff, 45, and James
Chisholm died in the crash Saturday afternoon, said an officer with
the Federal Highway Police in Puerto Vallarta.</LD>
<LD>   Family members and friends said Haber, an attorney who was
celebrating his 61st birthday, was vacationing with his wife,
Margaret, and six friends at his home in the resort city of Puerto
Vallarta when the group left in Haber's van for a seaside village in
neighboring Nayarit state.</LD>
<TE>   "We are all grieving, it hasn't sunk in yet," said Sage Knauft,
Haber's son-in-law.</TE>
<TE>   Haber was driving on a two-lane highway outside the town of San
Francisco when he tried to turn left onto a dirt road leading to San
Pancho, a smaller village, police said.</TE>
<TE>   A bus sped behind Haber and tried to pass his van on the left,
police said. The bus driver lost control and plowed into and over the
van, crushing it and dragging it nearly 100 feet, said police and a
paramedic who was at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   "The van was left under the bus with its wheels to the sky,
completely crushed," said Adan Castellano, a Red Cross paramedic.
"The bus wasn't raised very high off the ground."</TE>
<TE>   The bus driver and four passengers were unharmed. The driver ran
away, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Residents rushing to the scene used a local farmer's tractor to
push the bus off and upright the van. The closest paramedics took 40
minutes to get to the scene and had to use machinery to free the
victims.</TE>
<TE>   "The impact was so strong that we had several critical injuries,"
Castellano said.</TE>
<TE>   Bahia de Banderas authorities said Monday night that they were
still searching for the driver of the bus, which was owned by the
Transportes del Pacifico company.</TE>
<TE>   The five survivors were taken to a hospital in Puerto Vallarta.
All were expected to be airlifted to hospitals in Pasadena or Arizona
by today.</TE>
<TE>   They are Kathleen Chisholm, 57, Michael Burns (age unknown),
Patricia Burns, 54, Francis McNiff, 65, and Margaret Haber, 65.
Family members and friends said one of the reasons for the trip was
to celebrate David Haber's and Francis McNiff's birthdays. Haber's
birthday was Monday, and McNiff's was Friday, said Haber's
24-year-old daughter, Kathleen.</TE>
<TE>   "They had had a party at my parents' house," she said.</TE>
<TE>   David Haber, an attorney with Knapp, Petersen &amp; Clarke, was an
experienced trial litigator, having tried more than 100 cases,
including some involving aviation, product liability and legal
malpractice, according to the firm's Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Since the accident, friends and relatives have dropped by his
house in Pasadena to offer the family support.</TE>
<TE>   "Friends were the most important thing to him," his daughter said.
"That's the most important message he impressed upon us, the
importance of friendships."</TE>

<HD>Transit Nerds Making Themselves Heard</HD>
<DH>Advocacy group, armed with stacks of data, lobbies
officials on benefits of light rail.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kurt Streeter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mad about gridlock, these everyday Angelenos are fighting like mad to
do something about it.</LD>
<LD>   They spend countless hours working for free, hosting packed
community meetings, cornering politicians, lobbying for light rail.</LD>
<LD>   They attack the matter with gusto, armed with volumes of
statistics, flow charts, demographic data and a Web site where they
plot, plan and rage.</LD>
<TE>   They are so single-minded, and pay such detailed attention to
arcane transit data, that they sometimes self-deprecatingly call
themselves "the transit nerds."</TE>
<TE>   "All we need is the shirt pocket protector for the pens," said
Darrell Clarke, a co-founder of the all-volunteer group Friends4Expo
Transit.</TE>
<TE>   The group came together to push for construction of the proposed
14-mile light railway connecting Los Angeles to Santa Monica, running
mostly down the middle of Exposition Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   With engineering studies on that project underway, Friends4Expo's
goals have grown. It is lobbying elected officials to build more mass
transit infrastructure all over the region -- mostly light rail -- to
ease the traffic nightmare.</TE>
<TE>   The officials -- partly bothered by the bold tenacity of
Friends4Expo, partly awed by members' transit knowledge -- are
listening.</TE>
<TE>   Case in point: When the Metropolitan Transportation Authority
voted in September to reengage in an against-the-odds fight to extend
the Red Line subway to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art,
Friends4Expo members complained loudly that the subway plan would
take money and attention from their project, which is cheaper and
much closer to taking shape. MTA officials quickly agreed: The Expo
Line will have first crack at federal funds.</TE>
<TE>   "Those people, they're a vital force," said Rep. Diane Watson
(D-Los Angeles), whose district includes the proposed Expo Line.
Watson noted that, although full funding is not in place, engineering
for the Expo Line is getting underway. That's quite a feat because,
until a crucial MTA vote last year, the Exposition right of way was
being touted by some for use as a bus line.</TE>
<TE>   Clarke's group met with almost every top transit official in the
region before the vote, showing off scores of signatures supporting
its rail plan. Watson said the lobbying was crucial: "If it wasn't
for their willingness to show there was a community that wanted rail,
the Expo Line would not have gotten this far."</TE>
<TE>   Operating largely under the radar, Friends4Expo is part of a
burgeoning movement that could have a major effect on the way the
metropolis deals with congestion.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, transit planners could build major projects --
freeways or rail lines -- with little regard for community groups.
Today, ordinary people are demanding more say in the matter, even
proposing rail routes and busways. Without the full support of the
community, said John Catoe, deputy chief executive of the MTA,
"there's little chance new projects will get off the ground."</TE>
<TE>   Aware of this, and with commuters grinding nearly to a halt and
pollution clogging the skies, scores of new grass-roots transit
advocacy groups are sprouting.</TE>
<TE>   From Los Angeles -- home of the nation's worst traffic -- to
cities such as Seattle, St. Louis, San Francisco and Phoenix,
well-organized transit advocacy groups have formed, some operating
with no funding.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle voters last week may have approved financing plans for a
14-mile elevated monorail, the culmination of efforts by a quirky
taxi driver who has been pushing for monorail in the city since the
mid-1990s. Absentee ballots were still being counted at week's end.</TE>
<TE>   Across the nation and in Los Angeles, such groups are avidly
pushing officials and policymakers to back the construction of
big-money infrastructure: rail lines, dedicated busways, subway
systems and monorails. Some also push exclusively for more and better
bus service.</TE>
<TE>   Almost all of the transit advocacy groups have slick Web sites
that beckon recruits, break down policy issues and urge people who
fight traffic every day to get involved.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the Web site www.Friends4Expo.org features thorough
explanations of the efficacy of light rail, and chat rooms where
frustrated commuters post rants against politicians who are seen as
obstructing progress.</TE>
<TE>   The groups vary in size, stature and nature. Some promote a
particular rail line, some a particular philosophy. They don't always
get along; at times they express outright hatred for one another.
Emotions are driven sometimes by outsized egos, and often by the many
earnest debates swirling around transit. Does it make sense, for
example, to work for more buses, more trains, or both?</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the advocacy groups include vigorous outsiders
such as the Bus Riders Union, a left-leaning, anti-rail powerhouse.
It first sued the MTA, claiming civil rights violations, and then, in
1996, forced the agency into a 10-year court agreement requiring the
MTA to increase bus service. Because of its legal victory, most
observers say the group is the most powerful advocacy organization in
the region.</TE>
<TE>   More modestly successful, and more mainstream, is the Southern
California Transit Advocates, considered the oldest of the Los
Angeles advocacy groups, around since the late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is Madres del Este Los Angeles Santa Isabel, a vocal
body of poor Latino mothers working for better civic amenities,
including busways. (After a turf and power battle, two groups called
Madres del Este Los Angeles have emerged: The pro-bus body, and a
vocal group supporting a planned light railway. Each claims to be the
legitimate voice of Boyle Heights and East Los Angeles.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Forming Alliances</TE>
<TE>   It's not uncommon for a member of one advocacy group to be a
member of two or three others. Friends4Expo members, for example, are
forming alliances with other advocates, fighting for a variety of
other transit projects, including extensions of the Green Line
railway to Los Angeles International Airport, a light-rail plan in
Venice and the almost-finished Pasadena Gold Line railway. For people
like Clarke, the analytical Friends4Expo co-founder, praise from
officials such as Watson is an affirmation of the years of hard work
done in obscurity, when few seemed to be listening.</TE>
<TE>   A 48-year-old Santa Monica resident, Clarke got hooked on transit
as a student at UC Berkeley in the early 1970s, when he watched
construction of the Bay Area Rapid Transit system come to an end. He
was such a fan that in 1974 he was on the first BART train to be open
to the public traveling from Oakland to San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1980s he joined a vocal group of Culver City and South
Los Angeles residents who were trying to get the city to buy and
transform the dormant Exposition Boulevard railway for transit.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, a schedule he maintains a dozen years later emerged out
of necessity. Clarke would arrive home from his job as an information
technology manager at IBM, take a short break, then spend as much as
five hours working at the battle for the light-rail line: organizing
and running community meetings, knocking on neighborhood doors in a
search for supporters or holing up in front of his computer.</TE>
<TE>   He hoarded armfuls of data that he and the others still use:
census and economic figures, traffic and cost estimates and
demographic breakdowns. The statistics were a handy way to support
the argument for light rail.</TE>
<TE>   For all of the exuberance Clarke and others showed, by the
mid-1990s, as the MTA turned almost all of its attention to building
costly subways, the effort to put trains on Exposition had withered.
It was reborn only in 1998, when a financially crippled MTA turned
away from subway construction and began looking for ways to build
more for less money.</TE>
<TE>   Clarke and a crew of about 20 others in the group's inner circle
were at it again, officially forming Friends4Expo, making the rounds
of transportation meetings, prodding officials to fight for the Expo
Line.</TE>
<TE>   Always at the ready were the statistics and projections: 837,000
people live within two miles of the Expo Line! Clarke would say.
That's 13,300 per square mile! That would be the 12th-largest city in
the U.S.! That's much more dense than San Diego and Portland, Ore.,
where light rail has been a huge success!</TE>
<TE>   The advocates counted about 200 members then. Today there are
nearly 1,500, most of them engaged with the group through the
Internet or by attending community meetings hosted by Friends4Expo,
often at local high schools. "There were times that I would be up
there and I would just be feeling like a gnat, capital G-N-A-T,
gnat," said Clarke, who lightheartedly uses the nickname "transit
nerds" for himself and others in his group for their tendency to go
on about the length of rail cars, rail costs per mile, overload
capacity and the like.</TE>
<TE>   They're an eclectic bunch. Among the inner circle are urban
planners, lawyers and inventors from the Crenshaw district,
middle-class mothers from Santa Monica, businesswomen from Cheviot
Hills, train buffs, bus riders, filmmakers, teachers and political
aides.</TE>
<TE>   The group also has its share of iconoclasts.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most charismatic is Dr. Ken Alpern, a Westside
dermatologist who calls himself Friends4Expo's "token Republican."</TE>
<TE>   "I have my family and my work and my hobby," says Alpern. "It
ain't golf. It's transit."</TE>
<TE>   Alpern is known for punching out late-night pro-rail screeds over
the Internet and for aggressive lobbying of politicians.</TE>
<TE>   A forceful, energetic man who lives on just a few hours of sleep
each night, Alpern often rises at 4:30, the better to prepare for the
5 a.m. teleconferences he schedules with Washington officials and
congressional aides, conversations in which he pumps them for
information and pleads for them to bring home federal dollars to Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Another is Bart Reed. An eccentric, intelligent sort, Reed is a
man seemingly everywhere at once. In addition to his involvement in
Friends4Expo, Reed runs his own group, the Transit Coalition, from
his cramped little home in Sylmar. Living hand to mouth, he has no
job and no car, preferring to get about on trains and buses.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ubiquitous Advocate</TE>
<TE>   And get around he does. Attend almost any public transportation
meeting of any note in Los Angeles -- and there are usually between
10 and 15 each month -- and there's a good chance that Reed will be
there, dressed in his fraying gray, 16-year-old suit, greeting almost
everyone with a knowing glance through his Coke-bottle glasses and
his signature 10-word opening line: "Hi, I'm Bart Reed. Can I have
your business card?"</TE>
<TE>   He's uncommonly effective, simply because he gets top officials to
listen. They usually grimace when speaking of Reed, then admit that
his squeaky-wheel brand of advocacy has their attention.</TE>
<TE>   By his estimate, over the last two years, Reed has set up more
than 200 face-to-face meetings with top politicians and transit
officials, opportunities that he and the others used to press their
case for changes.</TE>
<TE>   "You turn around, the guy is right there, drilling you," said
Catoe, the MTA official, recalling the time Reed made his way to a
state-sponsored conference in Sacramento. "But you soon realize: He
really knows his stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Clarke, who because of the attention he has received was recently
hired by the Orange County Transportation Authority to work on
community outreach, notes that the Friends4Expo group still has
significant hurdles to overcome.</TE>
<TE>   In a time of tight budgets, federal and state funding for
construction of the first nine-mile phase of the Expo Line -- from
downtown to near Culver City -- is in question. The way things are
going, the Expo Line might never be built.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, county Supervisor and MTA board member Yvonne
Brathwaite Burke, no fan of the Expo Line beyond a spur from downtown
to USC, is floating plans to put cheaper electric buses on Exposition
Boulevard instead of trains.</TE>
<TE>   Aware of the grass-roots clout held by Friends4Expo, Burke
recently dispatched her top transit aide to a private meeting with
the advocates.</TE>
<TE>   The transit nerds are listening. But so far, says Clarke, they
aren't budging.</TE>

<HD>Call Them Even: He Stole the Cell Phone, but Gave the Store

<LD>Maybe it seemed like the perfect time to shoplift the cell phone.
After all, the clerk in the electronics store had gone into the back
to run a credit check and the would-be buyer was alone with the
gadget. So he skedaddled with it.</LD>
<LD>   Just one problem, reported the Paramount newsletter, City Talk.
The thief had already put down his correct address on the credit
application, which made the investigative work of the L.A. County
Sheriff's Department that much easier.</LD>
<LD>   Incidentally, the shoplifter was not an actor.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The jury is still out on this one, though: Jean McTernan of L.A.
noticed on her jury summons that dead people who can't prove they're
dead get only a one-year reprieve from duty (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Food for thought: "I've been invited to a number of weddings where
the reception caterers have offered interesting and varied menu
selections," said Lee Ruttenberg of West L.A., "but this one seemed a
bit odd" (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   I would add that many people don't know what to do with children
during weddings, but this strikes me as a really extreme concept.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lawsuits, wetsuits, etc.: California Lawyer magazine was ripped by
a reader over an article about the L.A.-area Surfing Lawyers Assn.
(there really is such a group).</TE>
<TE>   The magazine remarked that surfers are "type L, as in laid back."</TE>
<TE>   But a San Diego reader argued that that this was a shallow
analysis, declaring that "traditional short-board surfing is one of
the most aggressive, hard-charging sports there is and always
attracts type-A personalities."</TE>
<TE>   The reader sneered that the wave-riding lawyers are "apparently
into longboard surfing, which is what guys who can't surf do, like
driving an RV around an Indy track." And, before he ran out of
breath, he added "that a surfing lawyer organization already exists:
Surfrider Foundation."</TE>
<TE>   I just hope these two groups can settle their differences without
paddling into court.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Slip-and-fall possibilities here: Last week this column discussed
banana museums in Germany and banana artists in Canada. In my
never-ending coverage of this important fruit, I bring you a snapshot
that Wendy Mollett of Studio City brought back from North Carolina
(see photo).</TE>
<TE>   As she observed, "it puts a new twist on BYOB."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: The writers of the movie "Santa Clause 2" worked a
Hollywood joke into one scene where Santa is told that someone he
knows is on the "naughty list." "It's Charlie," an elf explains.</TE>
<TE>   "Sheen?" replies Santa. "I thought he'd straightened out." It
turns out that this Charlie is not the bad-boy actor but the bad-boy
son of Santa.</TE>

<HD>Black Panthers Say Their Name Has Been Stolen</HD>
<DH>Aging radicals take on an anti-Semitic group that calls
itself the 'New Black Panther Party.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rone Tempest</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>Much has changed in the 36 years since the Black Panther Party for
Self Defense was founded here and rose to national prominence.</LD>
<LD>   The Oakland traffic cop who came to the front door on a recent
afternoon just wanted to shake the hand of Panther co-founder Bobby
Seale, who recently moved back to his hometown. Forget about the
parking ticket he held in one hand. This was all "Yes, sir!" and
"Glad to meet you, Mr. Seale."</LD>
<LD>   "We're senior citizens now," shrugged Seale, a little embarrassed
by his new, respected, elder persona.</LD>
<TE>   But just because the Panthers are graying, said the 65-year-old
Seale, who is recovering from heart bypass surgery, doesn't mean they
should watch helplessly as their reputation is threatened by "racist"
usurpers calling themselves the "New Black Panther Party."</TE>
<TE>   Seale and other founders of the original, Oakland-born Black
Panther Party are seeking to protect their legacy in courts and the
U.S. patent office. At stake is a small-scale, politically tinged
business operation that includes a Black Panther clothing line,
"legacy tours" of Oakland police battlegrounds, college speaking
engagements and a rap group created by the offspring of former
militants.</TE>
<TE>   "By using the Panther logo, which is our brand name," complained
former Panther chief-of-staff David Hilliard, "this other group is
getting instant validation for its racial hatred and anti-Semitism."</TE>
<TE>   Founded in Dallas in 1989, the New Black Panther Party gained
notoriety through the anti-Semitic rhetoric of its former national
chairman, Khalid Abdul Muhammad, a spokesman for the Nation of Islam
who joined the New Black Panther group in 1994. Muhammad died last
year.</TE>
<TE>   The upstart group made headlines again after Sept. 11, 2001, when
its new chairman, Washington, D.C., attorney Malik Zulu Shabazz,
described the attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center as
payback for America's "past sins and current sins against the people
of the Earth."</TE>
<TE>   Shabazz, 35, accused by the Anti-Defamation League of "virulent
anti-Semitism," became a regular on Fox News and other TV outlets
after the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   This notoriety rankles the original Panthers, who say Shabazz is
polluting and distorting the historic Panther cause.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a generation of young people," said Hilliard, who
conducts $20 guided bus tours of Panther landmarks in Oakland,
including the site of the first Panther-pioneered free breakfast
program, "who confuse us with these guys on television who promote
racial hatred and anti-Semitism and vigilantism."</TE>
<TE>   The original Panthers, Hilliard said, practiced coalition
politics, forming political alliances with the Peace &amp; Freedom Party,
the gay liberation movement, Brown Berets and the United Farm
Workers, to name a few.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Criticized Mandela</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, New Panther leader Shabazz opposes interracial
political coalitions and was fiercely critical of Nelson Mandela for
working with white politicians in South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   "This dishonors and denigrates our history," said Hilliard, who
heads the Huey P. Newton Foundation, named for the Panther co-founder
who was slain in 1989. "It also impacts our support base as a
business, because our politics are green, not black. The cat was
black, not our politics."</TE>
<TE>   Seale, who still sports a beret but now wears a wool sport coat
instead of his trademark leather jacket, said the post-Sept. 11
posturing by Shabazz and others has cut into his public speaking
business.</TE>
<TE>   "This year I've only got two engagements," said Seale, who
commands $5,000 an appearance on the college lecture tour. In recent
years, the former Panther leader and Chicago 7 defendant said, he had
averaged 10 to 12 lectures a year.</TE>
<TE>   "When this group started to show up on Fox News and calling into
C-SPAN supporting Al Qaeda, supporting the Taliban, supporting Islam,
supporting the Palestinian suicide bombings," said Seale, "it slowed
my business down. I've lost $20,000 to $25,000 in basic income that I
would normally get in the fall."</TE>
<TE>   To fight back, Seale and Hilliard, along with former Panther
leader Elaine Brown and Fredrika Newton, Huey's widow, hired Oakland
attorney Andrew M. Gold to represent them in a copyright, trademark
and brand-name infringement action against the New Black Panther
Party.</TE>
<TE>   Public comments by New Black Panther Party leaders have vacillated
between attempts to mend fences with the original Panthers and
dismissals of Seale and others as tired has-beens who are apologists
for Israel.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Changes Ahead</TE>
<TE>   There is some indication that the pressure from Seale and other
original Panthers is having results.</TE>
<TE>   New Black Panther leader Shabazz said in a telephone interview
last week that the party plans a national meeting in February when it
expects "to seriously consider changing the organization or its
name." The party Web site, which previously featured photographs of
Huey P. Newton, has been taken off the Internet for "repairs."</TE>
<TE>   Shabazz said he is on an "indefinite leave of absence from the
party to handle pressing legal matters with my law firm." He said he
was not sure he would participate in the February meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Shabazz declined to answer additional questions about the party
except to say that it "is not a racist or anti-Semitic hate group and
never has been." Despite his protestations, both the Anti-Defamation
League and the Southern Poverty Law Center describe the New Black
Panther Party as anti-Semitic.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland attorney Gold reacted with cautious optimism to the
Shabazz statement.</TE>
<TE>   "If it is true that they are going to potentially change their
name, then it's great," Gold said. "We are not trying to silence
them. Our only concern is their attempt to affiliate themselves with
the Black Panther name."</TE>
<TE>   Gold said a lawsuit still may be necessary. The New Black Panther
group has so far ignored a 1997 injunction by a Texas judge banning
its use of the Panther name.</TE>
<TE>   "The game plan is to try to raise some money to litigate," Gold
said. But fund-raising for the Panthers, long famous for their
"radical chic" support in the celebrity community, has dried up since
the post-Sept. 11 appearances by Shabazz.</TE>
<TE>   "When I called our former supporters in academia and Hollywood,"
Hilliard said, "the first response I got from some of these people on
our Rolodex was, 'What are you going to do about these guys going
around spouting anti-Semitism?' "</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Gold wrote Shabazz in August, demanding that he cease
using the Panther name and logo. Seale and the other Panthers were
particularly incensed that the New Black Panthers featured pictures
of Newton on their Web site alongside Nation of Islam spokesman
Muhammad.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Not About Money</TE>
<TE>   Although the Panthers and the Huey P. Newton Foundation receive
some income from college lectures, tours and a designer clothing
contract with the Fresh Jive line, Gold said it is not about the
money.</TE>
<TE>   "The real concern is that 100 years from now, when the history of
the 1960s is written, that the Black Panther Party be seen as a
significant chapter in the civil rights struggle," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Taking the Panther name and attaching it to alien ideas, argued
the attorney, is the equivalent of starting a new software company
and calling it "New Microsoft."</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," laughed Seale, sitting in Hilliard's Oakland townhouse.
"Call yourself 'New Microsoft' and see how long it takes to find
[yourself] in court."</TE>
<TE>   In some respects, the copyright conflict has served to revitalize
the original Panthers, who formally disbanded as a political party in
the 1970s. Since then, some key Panther leaders, notably Newton and
Eldridge Cleaver, have died, the latter after years of exile and a
conversion to Reagan Republicanism.</TE>
<TE>   Hilliard, like Newton, battled problems with drugs. Seale worked
as a radio host in Denver, a political organizer in Washington, D.C.,
and community liaison for Temple University in Philadelphia. Although
he came back once to run unsuccessfully for mayor of Oakland, Seale
said he returned to his hometown permanently this fall, in part to be
near his youngest daughter, who is a junior at San Francisco State.</TE>
<TE>   But now the old Panthers, a little slow of step though still quick
with a political phrase, are reunited in the fight to save their
name.</TE>
<TE>   One step toward that goal is their sponsorship of a rap group
called the Black Panther F.U.G.I.T.I.V.E.S. The three performers
record under the Black Panther Records label led by Dorion Hilliard,
David's son.</TE>
<TE>   One of the singers is James Calhoun, son of former musician Bill
Calhoun, who performed at political events with the Lumpens singing
group founded by the Panthers. Among their best-known songs was the
political anthem "Power to the People, Right On!"</TE>
<TE>   To the dismay of the old Panthers, the same song is now used by
the Northern California utility Pacific Gas &amp; Electric as part of its
energy-saving advertising.</TE>
<TE>   James Calhoun, who also uses the stage name Jamiel Hassan, grew up
and worked with rap star Tupac Shakur, the since-murdered son of
another prominent former Panther, Afeni Shakur.</TE>
<TE>   Although the format and music are hip-hop, the message of the
Black Panther musical trio, in keeping with its heritage, is
decidedly political and anti-gangster. The group name, Calhoun said
in an interview before a recent performance in San Francisco, is an
acronym for "Future Under the Guidance of Intelligent True
Individuals who Visualize Every Struggle."</TE>
<TE>   "My father was with the Lumpens in the 1960s," said Calhoun,
leaning on the bar of the Justice League club while Seale and
Hilliard beamed proudly nearby and other supporters sold posters and
T-shirts. "Here we are in 2002, doing the same thing with a new
twist."</TE>
<TE>   One line from the group's album, titled "All of Us," goes: "This
is not a gangster party. This is the Black Panther Party."</TE>

<LD>"Doc?"</LD>
<LD>   The therapist looks up at the voice and sees the familiar face.
The therapist is a PhD, not a doctor, but if it makes his clients
feel better calling him "Doc," who is he to argue? The therapist
invites him in and steers him to a seat by the Kleenex box; he can
tell when a patient will be needing a tissue and he gets tired of
standing up and walking it over.</LD>
<LD>   "I know you haven't seen me for a while, but I'm glad you could
fit me in," the man says lamely. What seems to be the problem?</LD>
<TE>   Big sigh. "I dunno, Doc. It's like I've just lost my bearings. I
used to be so sure of who I was and where I was going. And now?" He
fiddles with the little English enamel box made to look like a
psychiatrist's couch. The therapist knows the signs; he'll be bawling
in 10 minutes, you can make book on it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like one day, I'm one kind of political party, and then the
next day -- something completely different." And when did this start?</TE>
<TE>   "Well, you heard what happened to me a week ago?" The therapist
makes that professional, noncommittal, encouraging "mmm'' sound it
took him two years to master.</TE>
<TE>   "I was ... just ... wiped ... out. Blown out of the voting booth
by the other party. The one that begins with a big-D, and I don't
mean Dallas. It was like getting fired and having your girlfriend
dump you and finding out your house is built on a toxic waste site,
all at once. The Chargers won more than we did.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like, what did I DO? Where did I go wrong? You know me, Doc.
I was a winner! Look, I can show you pictures -- here's me with
Nixon, me with Reagan, me with George Deukmejian -- OK, so not
everybody had star power, but we were a TEAM. Howard Jarvis and I
were just like THAT. I had the money, I had the voting base, I had
Tom Selleck. And now I'm the Rodney Dangerfield of the G-O-P. Trent
Lott wouldn't pee on me if Osama bin Laden set me on fire.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't feel like the party I used to be. I second-guess
everything. I feel like two different parties, like my left and my
right don't know what they're doing. I look in the mirror and I
think, who am I? Would I rather be right than president? Heck, would
I rather be right than insurance commissioner? It's pathetic." The
blubbering begins. The therapist looks furtively at his watch --
right on schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not just being paranoid. I can tell everybody's pointing at
me and saying stuff like, 'Hey, I guess elephants really ARE extinct
in California,' and 'Look, there goes the new California third
party.'</TE>
<TE>   "I can't even get girls -- women, I mean. I don't understand --
I'm rich. I have a nice house in the Anaheim Hills. I could afford to
take care of them, so they could stay home and have a lot of kids --
I believe in family values. And do you think they give me the time of
day? N-O. They run off to that other party, which if I may say so
isn't exactly great-looking OR loyal, and you wouldn't want to know
how it gets its money."</TE>
<TE>   Have you had any suicidal thoughts?</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, why bother with suicide when you're getting murdered?
Suicide, homicide -- I've thought of everything. Some people say I
commit suicide every primary election. I know I keep nominating guys
who can't even beat Barbara Boxer -- but what about the principle of
the thing?"</TE>
<TE>   Has your family been supportive?</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, yeah right. Bad enough the voters hate me. Then my own family
-- backstabbing begins at home. You should hear the name-calling when
we get together -- hypocrite, half-baked, throwback, carpetbagger. It
hurts, y'know? It just hurts." He blows his nose in that manly way of
crying without appearing to cry. He drops the tissue at the
wastebasket at his feet. He misses.</TE>
<TE>   "The worst part is my relatives out of state. Here I am, the big
brother of the family, and THEY'RE the ones doing great, and they
don't let me forget it. I got a snotty e-mail from my cousin in
Alabama yesterday addressed to 'Dear Mister Republi-cant.' And now my
brother-in-law in D.C., Mr. Velcroed-to-the-White-House, thinks he
should be calling the shots -- like he really knows how to drive my
car from 3,000 miles away. Just watch, with my luck, Arnold
Schwarzenegger'll move back to Austria.''</TE>
<TE>   The therapist is about to say that the time is up when, from the
anteroom, there's the sound of "Ruffles and Flourishes," and then the
triumphant brass clash of "Hail to the Chief." The patient looked
startled.</TE>
<TE>   "Is that who I think it is?"</TE>
<TE>   The therapist sighs deeply. He goes to the door, opens it
slightly. "Please take a seat, Gov. Davis. I'll be right with you."</TE>

<HD>Debate Delays Distribution of Anti-Radiation Pills by State</HD>
<DH>The tablets, for use by those near reactors in case of
nuclear incidents, won't be given out until officials decide on how
to do it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Seema Mehta</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although California received about 400,000 anti-radiation pills from
the federal government last summer, they won't be distributed until
January at the earliest because health officials are still debating
how best to get the drugs to the public.</LD>
<LD>   The dispute centers on whether the pills should be given directly
to residents who live next to California's two nuclear power plants
or whether they should be placed in hospitals and emergency centers
farther away from the plants.</LD>
<LD>   Until the disagreement is resolved, the potassium iodide pills
will remain locked away in a Southern California storage facility
about an hour away from the San Onofre Nuclear Generation Station and
several hours away from the Diablo Canyon power plant in San Luis
Obispo County.</LD>
<TE>   Community leaders and antinuclear activists expressed frustration
at the delays, saying the pills need to be distributed immediately.
At a minimum, they said, state officials ought to move the pills
closer to the San Onofre and Diablo Canyon plants while they figure
out what to do.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm frustrated by the fact that the process has been so slow,"
said Susan Ritschel, a city councilwoman in San Clemente, just north
of San Onofre. "It doesn't seem like it would be that difficult to
determine how to get these [pills] distributed to folks." The state
last summer requested the pills from the federal government, which
was offering them after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The state
said it would provide them to people who live within a 10-mile radius
of San Onofre and Diablo Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute comes down to how best to protect the public,
officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Giving the tablets directly to residents would allow people to
take a dose right away if an accident occurs, offering the greatest
protection against thyroid cancer.</TE>
<TE>   However, officials worry that this could delay evacuations and
create a false sense of security. The pills protect against only one
type of radioactive isotope -- radioactive iodine.</TE>
<TE>   Also, it would be impossible to distribute the pills in advance to
every person who would be working, vacationing or passing through the
10-mile evacuation zones.</TE>
<TE>   These concerns are among the reasons some health officials favor
stockpiling the medication at hospitals and other central locations,
allowing everyone who is evacuating to pick up a dose once they are
safely away from the plant.</TE>
<TE>   "We are continuing to work as fast as we can ... to get a plan
finalized and in place so we can move forward," said Eric Lamoureux,
a spokesman for the governor's Office of Emergency Services.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Mark Horton, Orange County's public health officer and a
member of the committee deciding on distribution, said: "If we
distribute, we certainly want to make that clear that this is not a
universal antidote for exposure to any kind of radiation."</TE>
<TE>   In December, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission offered
potassium iodide pills for roughly 4 1/2 million people who live
within 10 miles of a nuclear power plant. As of late October, 17
states had requested the tablets, according to the NRC.</TE>
<TE>   Potassium iodide is a form of salt. If an accident or attack
caused a radiation release at San Onofre or Diablo Canyon, people who
took a dose would be protected from radioactive iodine being absorbed
by their thyroids, which would decrease their risk of thyroid cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Children are particularly susceptible to radiation-induced thyroid
cancers, which was the most common ailment suffered after the 1986
Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine.</TE>
<TE>   The pill does not block the many other forms of radiation released
if a reactor were breached, and evacuation would remain paramount.</TE>
<TE>   Lamoureux said he believes a decision will be made well before
next summer, which is the federal deadline. Even though the pills are
now in storage, he said that they could be quickly moved in case of
an emergency.</TE>
<TE>   Antinuclear groups were alarmed by the state's lack of action.
"It's tragic. Something could happen tomorrow and those pills would
not be available to people that need them," said Daniel Hirsch,
director of the Los Angeles-based Committee to Bridge the Gap and
former director of the Adlai Stevenson program on nuclear policy at
UC Santa Cruz. "I don't understand why the kids are being held
hostage to bureaucratic inertia."</TE>

<HD>Girl Held, 2 Men Sought in Actor's Killing</HD>
<DH>Police refuse to provide any details about a teen taken
into custody in the shooting of 26-year-old Merlin Santana.</DH>

<AU>Richard Winton and Andrew Blankstein .</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police arrested a teenage girl Monday and were seeking two men in
connection with the fatal shooting two days earlier of actor Merlin
Santana.</LD>
<LD>   Santana, 26, best known for his role as Romeo Santana on "The
Steve Harvey Show," was shot as he sat in a parked car in the 3800
block of Victoria Avenue, a quiet residential street in South Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Sources said that Santana and a friend had been at a nearby home
in the early hours of Saturday morning with the girl, whom he had met
recently. She left the home and later returned outside the residence
about 2:45 a.m. accompanied by two men in a car, sources said.</LD>
<TE>   Santana and his friend had gotten in another vehicle to leave when
one of men shot him in the head as he sat in the passenger seat,
sources said.</TE>
<TE>   His friend drove to Crenshaw and Exposition boulevards and flagged
down a police car. Santana died at the scene, according to Los
Angeles Lt. Clay Farrell.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD officials declined to identify the girl.</TE>
<TE>   "We aren't releasing further details because it could jeopardize
the ongoing investigation," Los Angeles Police Officer Jason Lee
said. The department has assigned eight detectives to the case</TE>
<TE>   The New York-born Santana, whose parents emigrated from the
Dominican Republic, earned nominations for the NAACP Image Awards and
ALMA Awards, which honor Latino performers, for his role on "The
Steve Harvey Show" on the WB Network.</TE>
<TE>   Santana also appeared on other television shows, including "The
Cosby Show," "Major Dad," "Moesha" and "Sister, Sister." He was in
the regular casts of "Getting By" and "Under One Roof."</TE>
<TE>   Police ask that anyone with information related to Santana's
slaying contact LAPD's Robbery Homicide Division at (213) 485-2129.</TE>

<HD>Trustees Tie Riordan to Gift Offer</HD>
<DH>Occidental president Mitchell allegedly told them the
former mayor would fund a college post if Mitchell ran for L.A.
school board.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Occidental College President Theodore R. Mitchell told campus
trustees that former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan would donate
money for a top-level executive position at the college if Mitchell
ran for the Los Angeles Board of Education, according to participants
in that trustees' meeting.</LD>
<LD>   Riordan has denied being part of an effort by billionaire Eli
Broad to recruit Mitchell to run in the March 4 primary election
against board member David Tokofsky. The Times reported earlier this
month that Mitchell had told trustees that Broad offered to donate
$10 million to Occidental if Mitchell ran for the school board. Broad
has denied that.</LD>
<LD>   Riordan did not return several telephone calls to his office
requesting comment on his reported offer to Occidental.</LD>
<TE>   According to participants in the Oct. 30 telephone conference
between Mitchell, who was in New York, and the Occidental trustees'
executive committee, Mitchell told them that Riordan would pay for a
position at the college similar to a provost. The proposed
administrator would take on some of Mitchell's duties to give him
time to campaign for a school board post and hold office while
remaining in his Occidental position, said participants who asked not
to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Occidental's spokesman said Mitchell declined to be interviewed
for this story. Mitchell previously said he decided not to run for
the school board on the same day he talked with Occidental trustees,
partly because of Tokofsky's political strength.</TE>
<TE>   Broad, when asked about the reported offer by Riordan, said, "I'm
not aware of that."</TE>
<TE>   Broad said he was considering his own $10-million gift to the
college while encouraging Mitchell to run, but insisted that such a
gift was not contingent on Mitchell's agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell told The Times last month that he considered his
candidacy for the spring election and the donation as a "package." He
had said earlier that they were unrelated.</TE>
<TE>   During his conference call to Occidental trustees, Mitchell said
that Broad and Riordan had asked him to run for the school board and
that Riordan's support for Mitchell's candidacy would include funding
a top-level administrator's position, participants said. The cost of
that position reportedly was not discussed.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, a former Occidental trustee, has sought for several years
to shape education policy by financially supporting Los Angeles
school board candidates. Broad has funded a national foundation to
advocate school reforms and to train administrators on more
business-style leadership.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, with financial help from Broad, then-Mayor Riordan backed
four successful candidates -- including Tokofsky -- in the school
board elections and helped create a new majority on the seven-member
panel. Riordan's efforts faltered last year when two of the three
candidates he backed lost in the primary.</TE>
<TE>   In an earlier interview with The Times, Riordan denied having
recruited Mitchell to run against Tokofsky. "I wasn't the one that
went to him or was involved in any decision," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Broad said last week that he had not given Mitchell the idea of
running for the school board, but added, "When I heard he would
consider it, I urged him to do so."</TE>
<TE>   In a Nov. 2 e-mail to the Occidental faculty, Mitchell wrote that
he first discussed running for the school board with Riordan and
Broad when he was a UCLA administrator. (Mitchell was at UCLA from
1992 to 1998.) "I've said no on at least three occasions," Mitchell
wrote in the e-mail, which was provided to The Times by a faculty
member.</TE>
<TE>   According to participants in the Oct. 30 Occidental meeting,
trustees Chairman John Power also said he had met earlier with
Riordan, Broad and J. Paul Getty Trust President Barry Munitz to
discuss Broad's possible gift and Mitchell's school board candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   Power, a retired lawyer in the O'Melveny &amp; Myers law firm,
declined to comment about those reported discussions. Broad, Munitz
and Riordan did not return phone calls asking for interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell, Broad and Amy Wakeland had met in early October with
political strategist Bill Carrick to discuss Mitchell's possible run,
Carrick said. Wakeland works for the Coalition for Kids, a group
Riordan founded with Broad's support to fund school board candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Carrick, who has led campaigns for Riordan's mayoral runs as well
as for Riordan-backed school board candidates, said the meeting was
at Broad's Brentwood house, and covered "mundane" details such as the
amount of time Mitchell would have to spend campaigning. But Carrick
said he had not participated in any discussion of donations from
Riordan or Broad to Occidental.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell has been Riordan's advisor on education issues. Before
assuming the Occidental presidency in 1999, he had been a UCLA vice
chancellor and a Getty Trust executive.</TE>
<TE>   A school board member since 1995, Tokofsky is a former Marshall
High School social studies teacher who coached the school's Academic
Decathlon team to a national championship. His majority-Latino
district stretches from northeast Los Angeles to such cities as South
Gate and Cudahy, which are in the nation's second-largest school
district.</TE>
<TE>   Broad and Riordan reportedly have sought challengers to Tokofsky
because he does not always support their vision of reform.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm surprised that they're being so blatant," Tokofsky said.
"They supported me four years ago, though reluctantly. I have always
been a lead reformer on the board -- the public knows that, and the
classroom teachers know that.... It's a shame that they're treating
this school district like a banana republic."</TE>
<TE>   In the primary, Tokofsky will now face Jose Sigala, an aide to
Assemblyman Marco Firebaugh (D-Los Angeles); Nellie Rios-Parra, a
Lennox schoolteacher, Democratic activist and wife of Alvin Parra,
who recently dropped out of the City Council race to make room for
Antonio Villaraigosa; and Maria Lou Calanche, an educator and
unsuccessful Los Angeles Community College District candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Rios-Parra said she has met with Broad and Riordan, from whom she
had sought information about the Broad Foundation's educational
reform work around the country. Sigala said he has met with Riordan
and Wakeland..</TE>
<TE>   Members of the college trustees' executive committee who
participated in the Oct. 30 meeting either declined to comment on the
record or were unreachable. They are: lawyer Power; lawyer Molly
Munger; retired IBM executive Catherine Selleck; lawyer Jay Grodin;
lawyer Marilyn Garcia; Liberty Vegetable Oil Co. CEO Irwin Field;
real estate developer Eileen Brown; investor Joe Girard; former
Irvine Foundation president Dennis Collins; venture capitalist David
Berkus; civic volunteer Virginia Cushman; retired builder Jack
Samuelson; executive recruiting firm partner Kris Morris; and retired
Citicorp executive David Roberts.</TE>

<HD>Long Beach Hospital Nurses Plan 2nd Strike</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Julie Tamaki</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 1,000 nurses from Long Beach Memorial Medical Center are
planning their second daylong strike Thursday for better wages and
pensions as their union allies threaten to boycott the hospital.</LD>
<LD>   The recently unionized nurses want a new pension program, better
staffing and pay hikes for veteran nurses. If the strike occurs, it
will be the second time in three weeks that the nurses have formed a
picket line to try to jump-start talks with hospital administrators.</LD>
<LD>   Organizers predicted that this week's event will be larger than
the one-day strike held on Oct. 23 because the nurses are expected to
be joined by members from as many as five unions.</LD>
<TE>   The unions, which include the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters, sent letters last week to Long Beach Memorial
administrators threatening to boycott the hospital until the nursing
dispute is resolved.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it sends a very powerful message to the hospital that
they cannot continue to stonewall the registered nurses' very serious
concerns about the future of patient care at Long Beach Memorial,"
said Charles Idelson, a spokesman for the California Nurses Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Gainer Pillsbury, chief medical officer at Long Beach
Memorial, said his establishment, with its children's hospital,
offers services that are not available elsewhere in the Long Beach
community and would continue to draw patients.</TE>
<TE>   "We would hope they would continue to go to the best place for
patient care, and that's what we're trying to provide," Pillsbury
said.</TE>
<TE>   Pillsbury said administrators are evaluating the pension plan
sought by the nurses, and several other plans. The nurses want the
hospital to fund a pension plan that would guarantee monthly payments
after retirement, instead of the current system that operates more
like a 401(k) retirement plan.</TE>
<TE>   As for the unions' decision to jump into the fray, Pillsbury said:
"We don't like this whole thing. We're used to helping people, not
arguing with them."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Santangelo, president of Teamsters Joint Council 42, warned
the hospital's chief executive in a Nov. 6 letter of his group's
displeasure with the medical center and its decision to boycott the
facility.</TE>
<TE>   "We urge you to settle this dispute with the nurses so that we may
promote Long Beach Memorial Medical Center as a first-class hospital
that respects the rights of its skilled and dedicated RNs,"
Santangelo wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The group represents 150,000 members.</TE>
<TE>   Last month's one-day strike, the largest job action at a
California hospital in more than four years, led to a four-day
lockout of the hospital's 1,300 nurses.</TE>
<TE>   A similar situation is expected this week because, Pillsbury said,
the hospital is once again arranging to hire about 450 replacement
nurses.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the other unions, which include the International
Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union and the General Truck
Drivers, Chauffeurs and Helpers Union Local No. 692, are expected to
join the nurses on the picket line. The line is scheduled to begin
forming at 7 a.m. and will be followed by an evening candlelight
vigil.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Craft, a current member and past president of the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local No. 11, said he
plans to join his wife, who is a nurse at Long Beach Memorial, on the
picket line.</TE>
<TE>   "Long Beach Memorial has basically refused to negotiate with the
nurses, and they have brought in replacements," Craft said.</TE>

<HD>Closing the Book on Library Thefts</HD>
<DH>Authorities say an 85-year-old Simi Valley man stole 3,500
items. Sentencing is today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Holly J. Wolcott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every week for more than a decade, 85-year-old Ernest Heyneman drove
to one of his favorite libraries and spent hours reading or culling
the stacks for information on health and fitness, music and classic
television shows.</LD>
<LD>   The longtime Simi Valley resident, a retired movie studio
employee, always had a pleasant smile and a kind word for librarians
and took great care to return his borrowed items on time.</LD>
<LD>   Then, authorities say, he would return to the library and steal
them.</LD>
<TE>   When police showed up at his historic hilltop ranch house on
Heyneman Lane, they were startled by what they found: a well-stocked
reading room containing more than 3,500 items from the Thousand Oaks
and Simi Valley libraries.</TE>
<TE>   "We found 124 boxes of library materials, but the house was tidy,"
said Ventura County Sheriff's Det. Kevin Vaden. "There were books,
audiotapes, videotapes and compact discs." Most were in cardboard
boxes stacked high in two closets and in Heyneman's office in the
back of his sprawling home.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the items deputies found at his home during the search
included the book "All I Need To Know I Learned From Watching Star
Trek," the video "Milton Berle's Low Impact Fitness for People Over
50" and the compact disc "Puerto Rican Music in Hawaii."</TE>
<TE>   "He had very eclectic tastes,'' Vaden said.</TE>
<TE>   "He really liked the health-related stuff and some fiction," said
Dale Redfield, supervisor at the Simi Valley Library.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he even accrued three copies of 'The English Patient'
audiotape, which who knows why, because it wasn't that good of a book
to begin with."</TE>
<TE>   "The surprise was the amount of items that were there," Vaden
said. "I don't think anyone anticipated that."</TE>
<TE>   If police were startled by the amount he had stolen, so, too, was
Heyneman, Vaden said. "He seemed unsure that he had done all this. He
kept asking if he had done it. But since we were asking him about it,
he said he may have done it."</TE>
<TE>   The raid was last December. The next month, Heyneman turned
himself in, and in September, he pleaded no contest to one count of
burglary. Today, prosecutors are expected to ask a Ventura County
Superior Court judge to ban him from all county libraries for up to
five years.</TE>
<TE>   The thefts might have gone undetected had a library worker not
realized what some 150 items missing from the Thousand Oaks library
had in common -- all had last been checked out by the 85-year-old man
with the gentle mien and hazel eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all dismayed because he was such a pleasant person, and
it's such a huge theft," said Nancy Sevier, who runs the Thousand
Oaks library. "I mean this was big, very large scale. I never heard
of anything like it."</TE>
<TE>   "It's so unusual for someone in that age group to be committing a
felony offense," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Audrey Rohn. "This is not
the kind of thing we see on a regular basis."</TE>
<TE>   Although Heyneman and his attorney both declined to comment,
librarians and others say Heyneman is a true book lover who lost
control. Rohn said that Heyneman told authorities he "really likes
books."</TE>
<TE>   Over several years, Heyneman would check out books, videos and
audiotapes from the libraries, take them home and remove their
security strips before returning them.</TE>
<TE>   After he returned the items, and they were put back on the
shelves, Heyneman would go back and smuggle out the desensitized
materials without setting off any alarms.</TE>
<TE>   In all, authorities believe that Heyneman walked out of the
libraries with $26,000 worth of materials. About 3,000 items were
from the Thousand Oaks branch and some 500 came from Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Pending sentencing, Heyneman has spent much of his time at the
home that he and his wife, Emma, have shared for 30 years. The
estate--with its curvy half-mile driveway and indoor pool--was once a
summer retreat for early area settler Charles F. Blackstock, a county
judge who lived in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   "They were very gracious people," Simi Valley resident Gloria
Dubois said of the Heynemans.</TE>
<TE>   Dubois, a city engineer who grew up in the area and went to school
down the street, said she was invited into the couple's home for tea
a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It's funny. I don't remember seeing many books," she said.</TE>

<HD>Tree Falls in Forest of Legal Logic</HD>
<DH>Why would Santa Ana police stop a crew clearing a toppled
elm from a yard? The answer is an obscure law.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Reyes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lewis P. Janowsky is an attorney skilled in words and torts. He
didn't know he would run afoul of Santa Ana ordinance 18-314e.</LD>
<LD>   In other words, no noisy workmen on your property on a federal
holiday. And Monday was a federal holiday.</LD>
<LD>   After coming home Friday and seeing that a Chinese elm had fallen
against his Floral Park house, blocking the front door, Janowsky
thought the solution was simple: He would call a tree trimmer the
next day.</LD>
<TE>   Wrong. The first big storm of the season had created a boomlet for
tree trimmers. He couldn't get anyone to come to his house until
Monday, which was Veterans Day.</TE>
<TE>   That's when he ran into ordinance 18-314e, which allows "noise
sources associated with construction repair, remodeling or grading of
any real property provided said activities do not take place between
the hours of 8 p.m. and 7 a.m. weekends, including Saturday or any
time on Sunday or a federal holiday."</TE>
<TE>   "True, it's not a well-known ordinance, but it's there," said
Santa Ana Police Lt. Bob Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   Officers showed up in the neighborhood because of a complaint
about the hammering and sawing going on at two other homes down the
street from Janowsky's.</TE>
<TE>   After police halted work at those first two houses, they couldn't
ignore the work at Janowsky's. The ordinance doesn't give police
leeway, especially after a complaint, Chavez said.</TE>
<TE>   Police did not issue a citation and allowed the work to continue
long enough to clear a path to Janowsky's front door.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him it was a win-win situation," said Sgt. Bill Barrett.</TE>
<TE>   Janowsky said he would write a letter to City Hall requesting that
somebody look at the ordinance more closely.</TE>
<TE>   That might not be necessary. City Manager David N. Ream said he
would look into the matter first thing today.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure, in enacting this ordinance, that the intent wasn't to
prevent the removal of trees that fell on houses due to a storm,"
Janowsky said.</TE>

<HD>Past, Future Both Weigh Heavily on Veterans Day</HD>
<DH>Many ceremonies honor military men and women. In Simi
Valley, 4,000 people attend the dedication of a plaza.</DH>

<LD>Veterans Day this year was not only an observance of the past, the
keynote speaker at ceremonies in the Hollywood Hills said Monday, but
a day to recognize that war again may lie ahead.</LD>
<LD>   Paying tribute to the 48 million men and women who he said have
served in uniform since the founding of the nation -- and the more
than 1 million who died -- retired Marine Lt. Gen. John E. Rhodes
expressed confidence "that in the current war we will root out evil,
and we will prevail."</LD>
<LD>   Rhodes, a Vietnam veteran and twice winner of the Silver Star for
valor in combat, told a crowd of about 1,000 at Forest Lawn
Memorial-Park that the U.S. "has the best fighting forces in the
world."</LD>
<TE>   The ceremony was one of many in the Southland. In Simi Valley,
more than 4,000 people packed a city park to listen to an Air Force
band and to dedicate a $1.5-million plaza honoring American military
service.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, several hundred people gathered at Santa Fe
Depot in Orange near a memorial honoring the generations of veterans
who left by train for two world wars and the Korean War.</TE>
<TE>   "Those of us who went found our lives altered dramatically," said
William Woolett, 73, now city manager of Aliso Viejo, who lost an eye
in Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "The war provided young men and women an opportunity to mature, to
refocus their beliefs on the things that were important," Woolett
said.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis, speaking at Forest Lawn, said current and former
members of the U.S. armed forces are responsible for the fact that
more people are "living on this planet today in freedom than ever
before."</TE>
<TE>   Davis, a Vietnam veteran, said the state has spent $20 million
trying to help 6,000 Vietnam veterans in California who have been
homeless.</TE>
<TE>   "We all understand the profound debt we owe to our veterans,"
Davis said. "Many have come home to heroes' parades, but the veterans
of Korea and Vietnam were not so fortunate."</TE>
<TE>   As times passes, Davis said, appreciation for them grows. A bronze
tablet honoring those veterans was unveiled at the ceremony.</TE>

<HD>Candidate Complains of Attacks in Mailers</HD>
<DH>Villaraigosa says that the fliers violate election laws and
accuses Pacheco of involvement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tina Daunt and Mitchell Landsberg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Antonio Villaraigosa filed complaints with city and county officials
Monday, charging that the author of two scathing campaign mailers
attacking his character had violated state election law.</LD>
<LD>   Villaraigosa, the former mayoral candidate running for Los Angeles
City Council against incumbent Nick Pacheco, urged Dist. Atty. Steve
Cooley and LeeAnn Pelham, executive director of the city's Ethics
Commission, to investigate whether the mailers had been sent
illegally.</LD>
<LD>   The fliers were mailed to voters in the district by a supporter of
Pacheco, who is up for reelection in March.</LD>
<TE>   Pacheco disavowed knowledge of the mailers, which were described
by veteran campaign consultants as containing some of the strongest
personal attacks they had ever seen. Some political insiders warned
that the tactic could backfire.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never seen anything this blatant," said Bill Carrick, a
Democratic campaign consultant in Los Angeles whose clients have
included former President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   However, one researcher who has studied the effect of negative
campaigning said the mailers could be "a stroke of genius."</TE>
<TE>   Ruth Ann Lariscy, a professor of public relations at the
University of Georgia, said some of the most effective negative
campaigns are those that hit very hard, very early, and then rely on
voters' selective memory to hang on to only the essence of the
charges, not the circumstances in which they heard them.</TE>
<TE>   "By the time March rolls around, nobody's going to remember where
they heard all this stuff ... but they're very likely to remember the
information itself," Lariscy said.</TE>
<TE>   In their complaints, Villaraigosa and his campaign manager, Steve
Barkan, said that they believe the mailer's author, Ricardo Torres,
was working in concert with Pacheco to produce the disparaging
fliers, which were sent out anonymously, starting last Wednesday.
They said they based their complaint, in part, on the fact that
Pacheco's campaign manager informed a reporter Friday evening that
Torres was responsible for the mailers and ready to talk.</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco has denied having a role in the mailers. Under campaign
reporting laws, he would have to report the money spent on them
unless they were sent by a third party without his participation.</TE>
<TE>   "There is evidence that the Pacheco campaign and Torres
coordinated activities, thereby removing any 'independence' for a
qualified 'independent expenditure,' " Barkan wrote in a letter to
Cooley and Pelham.</TE>
<TE>   Barkan also complained that the mailers violated state election
law by failing to include any reference to who was sending them.</TE>
<TE>   Torres did not return calls from The Times on Monday, but defended
the mailers in a interview with KCBS-TV Channel 2. He said he would
continue to send anti-Villaraigosa fliers. Pacheco said he had no
idea that Torres was producing them until after the fact. He said he
had asked Torres to stop any future ads.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Antonio should pursue every legal avenue before him to
stop these, because I want them stopped too," Pacheco said. But he
added: "Unfortunately, when you send out facts, it's tough to mount a
legal challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Villaraigosa said he would not comment on the substance of the
fliers, one of which accused him of being a "womanizer." In the past,
Villaraigosa has openly acknowledged having had two children out of
wedlock as a young man, and having had an extramarital affair --
behavior he has said he regrets.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles), a Pacheco ally, said he
believes the councilman is not behind the mailers "and I would hope
they would stop." Becerra's own campaign for mayor collapsed last
year after it put out calls to voters saying that Villaraigosa was
soft on criminals. Becerra said he did not know anything about the
calls until after the fact.</TE>
<TE>   Political consultants roundly denounced the pro-Pacheco mailers,
although there was disagreement about whether they would hurt
Villaraigosa.</TE>
<TE>   A Republican consultant, Alan Hoffenblum, said he thinks voters
are growing tired of character attacks. He said campaigns that rely
on them often fail, unless the target is seen as hypocritical.</TE>
<TE>   As an example, he pointed to a March state Senate primary between
Republicans Dennis Hollingsworth and Charlene Zettel. Zettel attacked
her opponent on the basis of an old admission of infidelity, but
Hollingsworth won the primary and went on to win the Nov. 5 general
election.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of people who got elected last March and this
fall who were the subjects of character attacks, but I don't know any
ones who lost because of that," Hoffenblum said. He also said that
the timing of the attack on Villaraigosa was wrong, coming on the
heels of the Nov. 5 state election.</TE>
<TE>   "There is such a thing as election fatigue that voters go through,
and they've just been bombarded with weeks upon weeks of negative
advertising," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "And then, months before another election, they're bombarded with
another example of negative advertising. I just think it has a chance
of backfiring."</TE>
<TE>   However, Lanny Davis, a Washington lawyer who helped the Clinton
White House with damage control during the Monica Lewinsky scandal,
said he thought Villaraigosa could be hurt, in part because the
mailers found their way into mainstream media, such as The Times.</TE>
<TE>   "Once something like this is out there and is legitimized in an
important newspaper, it's very difficult to erase it," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   "Something like this is so outrageous, it is so shameful, that
whoever is behind it can't take enough showers," he said. "Whoever
put this out should be ostracized and condemned."</TE>

<HD>Going to DMV? Bring a Book</HD>
<DH>Fewer employees and more customers add up to longer lines
for California drivers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hugo Martin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you fail the Department of Motor Vehicles' driving test, you will
pay a new $5 fee to take the test again. If you are a few days late
in registering your vehicle, you will pay a $17 penalty instead of
the usual $10.</LD>
<LD>   But if you think these higher fees -- which take effect Jan. 1 --
will go toward improving the woeful service at the DMV, think again.</LD>
<LD>   Combined, these and other new DMV charges will generate an
additional $58 million a year for the state. But the extra cash won't
be spent on more workers to serve the suffering masses in those long
DMV lines. In fact, Gov. Gray Davis recently signed a budget that
cuts -- not adds -- positions at the department.</LD>
<TE>   More than half of the 93 positions cut from the DMV are "field
representatives," the folks who work at the counters trying to keep
those lines moving.</TE>
<TE>   The DMV already has about 800 vacant positions and has maintained
a hiring freeze for months.</TE>
<TE>   With the state's population continuing to skyrocket, you don't
have to be a member of Mensa to calculate the results.</TE>
<TE>   "A slight increase in wait times," predicted DMV spokesman Armando
Botello.</TE>
<TE>   How slight? No one can say. As it is, Californians already wait an
average of 25 minutes to register a vehicle and 23 minutes to get a
driver's license. Here in Southern California, home of the 10 busiest
DMV offices, the wait is 35 minutes to register a car and 33 minutes
to get a license.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's cuts were needed to close a $23.6-billion shortfall
in this year's budget. The DMV was not the only agency to feel the
edge of the budget knife. Overall, Davis cut 7,000 positions
statewide, on top of the 6,600 positions that had been left vacant.</TE>
<TE>   None of that mollifies the angry motorists stuck in lines at local
DMV offices.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh man -- I don't like this wait now, let alone a longer one,"
said Christina Martinez as she waited at the downtown Los Angeles DMV
office to replace stolen license tags. She had already waited 30
minutes, and saw from the huge crowd around her that she was probably
going to wait another 30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles office is one of the many DMV branches where the
state has launched a new "take-a-number" queuing system that DMV
chief Steve Gourley has touted as the "biggest thing since sliced
bread."</TE>
<TE>   But according to the latest DMV estimates of wait times, the
system has yet to produce the dramatic results promised by Gourley.</TE>
<TE>   He and other DMV officials say motorists can bypass the long lines
by making appointments or using the DMV Web site (www.dmv.ca.gov/) to
complete certain transactions.</TE>
<TE>   Gloria Secrest of Los Angeles took that advice and scheduled an
appointment for 12:50 p.m. on a recent afternoon. At 1:45 she was
still sitting on a hard plastic seat at the Los Angeles DMV office,
staring at a TV monitor, waiting for her number to be called.</TE>
<TE>   "Longer waits?" she said, her voice trailing off as she shook her
head in disgust.</TE>
<TE>   But DMV customers aren't the only ones lamenting the budget cuts.</TE>
<TE>   DMV employees complain that they are often the targets of anger
and frustration over the long lines.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, a 25-year-old Stockton man who failed a
driving test allegedly attacked his DMV tester in Manteca, punching
the employee and kicking him after he tripped and fell. Police are
investigating.</TE>
<TE>   "The public is angrier and surlier," said Lois Kugelmass, a
spokeswoman for the California State Employees Assn., which
represents about 8,000 DMV workers.</TE>
<TE>   She said DMV offices are understaffed and their staffs are
overworked and unfairly blamed for the long waits.</TE>
<TE>   "It's terrible that our people get this bad rap," Kugelmass said.
"It's not their fault."</TE>
<TE>   Esther Diaz, a DMV worker in the West Covina office, has been
serving motorists for nearly 10 years and she is fed up.</TE>
<TE>   She complains that DMV management won't fill vacant positions,
forcing an already overburdened staff to carry the increasing load.
Making matters worse, she said, the computers at her office are slow
and antiquated.</TE>
<TE>   "We have stress from the public and stress from management," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   To pare the state's budget, Davis recently offered some state
employees a voluntary early retirement package, known as a "golden
handshake." Because the DMV is so understaffed, its employees were
not allowed to participate.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, employees like Diaz are not allowed to comment to the
media about conditions within the agency without approval from DMV
headquarters in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   So, why is Diaz willing to speak out and incur the wrath of her
bosses?</TE>
<TE>   She is quitting next month.</TE>
<TE>   It seems that even the workers can't stand to spend much time in a
DMV office.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody likes to go to a state office anymore," Diaz said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

year. Also included are the average waiting times for registering a
car and getting a driver's license.</TE>

<LD>A teenage student pilot who committed suicide by crashing into a
Tampa skyscraper had nearly hit the control tower at an Air Force
base that houses a nerve center for the Afghan war, a government
report says.</LD>
<LD>   Charles Bishop, 15, flew his stolen Cessna "just a few feet" over
the control tower at MacDill Air Force Base during the Jan. 5 flight,
the National Transportation Safety Board report says.</LD>
<LD>   The NTSB did not speculate on whether Bishop, who left a suicide
note expressing admiration for Osama bin Laden, had intended the base
as his target.</LD>

<HD>Senator Will Remain Independent</HD>
<DH>Dean Barkley, the interim lawmaker from Minnesota, will not
side with either major party, which leaves Democrats in control a bit
longer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Hook and Faye Fiore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Dean Barkley, the third-party activist appointed interim senator from
Minnesota, announced Monday that he will not side with either major
party during his short stay in office, allowing Democrats to keep
control of the Senate during the lame-duck session -- at least for
now.</LD>
<LD>   That means Democrat Tom Daschle of South Dakota will remain Senate
majority leader for another week or so -- giving his party a last
gasp of power and visibility after its losses in the Nov. 5
elections.</LD>
<LD>   Barkley's decision ends a bizarre interlude in which the
leadership of the Senate could have been changed single-handedly by a
man who, until his Nov. 4 appointment by Minnesota Gov. Jesse
Ventura, was a little-known former carwash operator.</LD>
<TE>   His choice may have little practical effect on the course of the
postelection session, which begins today. But it adds to the sense of
uncertainty and transition that has engulfed the Capitol since the
elections, in which Republicans expanded their House majority and
seized control of the Senate in next year's Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans stood to take over the Senate immediately if Barkley
had agreed to side with them on leadership questions in the lame-duck
session.</TE>
<TE>   Such a move would have installed Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) as
majority leader. But Barkley declined to join forces with either the
Democrats or the Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   "I am an independent, the governor who appointed me is an
independent, and I believe the best way to serve the people of
Minnesota is to remain independent," Barkley said in a statement
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "Rather than adding to the partisanship that so often
characterizes Congress, I would like to focus on bridging differences
and helping to move important legislation forward."</TE>
<TE>   Barkley, 52, is an improbable kingmaker, thrust into the limelight
when, on an hour's notice, Ventura tapped him for the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   The news came so unexpectedly that Barkley, dressed in jeans and a
sweatshirt, had to run home and put on a suit so he'd look
presentable for the announcement ceremony. Later, he went out to a
discount clothing store and bought two more suits.</TE>
<TE>   He calls himself a regular "meat and potatoes" sort of guy. He
likes to chew rather than smoke his $2.50 cigars because chewing is
"cheaper."</TE>
<TE>   He is still unvarnished enough to admit that the HBO cable series
"Sex and the City" is one of his favorite television shows, and that
the newfound fame has sent his wife, Susan, into a tailspin.</TE>
<TE>   Before announcing his decision to remain independent, Barkley
spent part of Monday reading the Senate rule book; he said he was
surprised to learn how much power the members of this club of 100 can
wield.</TE>
<TE>   "If you object, you bring the whole place to a halt," he said.
"I've been flexing my muscles thinking about whether I wanted to be a
mischief-maker."</TE>
<TE>   His decision giving Democrats continued control of the Senate
could delay GOP hopes of speeding up confirmation of President Bush's
judicial nominations. But Ranit Schmelzer, a spokeswoman for Daschle,
discounted the significance of Barkley's decision.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't change anything," Schmelzer said. "Both Sen. Daschle
and Sen. Lott have the same list of priorities for the lame-duck
session."</TE>
<TE>   That agenda focuses on a handful of items: passing appropriation
bills to finance the government in the fiscal year already underway,
reaching agreement on creation of a Department of Homeland Security
and approving a measure to provide federal backup for insurance
companies against acts of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of both parties agree that regardless of who controls the
narrowly split Senate, each side must work with the other to achieve
agreement on these issues.</TE>
<TE>   Even without Barkley, Republicans are expected to become the
majority in the Senate before the lame-duck session ends.</TE>
<TE>   That will occur as soon as Republican Jim Talent is certified by
Missouri officials as the new senator from that state, replacing
Democratic Sen. Jean Carnahan.</TE>
<TE>   Talent defeated Carnahan in last week's vote, results of which
should be certified in less than two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Talent will be sworn in earlier than others who won last week,
because Carnahan had been appointed to a Senate term that expired on
election day.</TE>
<TE>   Barkley may have more effect on efforts to break the deadlock over
Bush's proposal to create the Homeland Security Department.</TE>
<TE>   The bill stalled in the Senate over Bush's effort to waive civil
service protections for employees of the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Republican aides say they believe Barkley will side with
the GOP on that crucial issue.</TE>
<TE>   With that new leverage behind them, sources said that Republican
and White House negotiators are nearing an agreement on a compromise
that they believe could clear the House and Senate in short order.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional leaders hope the entire lame-duck session will be
brief.</TE>
<TE>   They warn, however, that it could last for weeks, in part because
of disputes that could arise over the appropriation bills.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the lame-duck session meets this week, newly elected
members of Congress will be on Capitol Hill for orientation meetings
to prepare them for taking office in early January.</TE>
<TE>   Also this week, House Republicans and Democrats will meet
separately to elect their leaders for the new Congress. Democrats are
expected to elevate Rep. Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco to become
House minority leader, replacing Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, who
announced last week that he was stepping down from the leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans, meanwhile, are expected to select Tom DeLay of Texas
to be House majority leader, replacing Dick Armey of Texas, who is
retiring from Congress. DeLay currently is the House majority whip.</TE>
<TE>   Barkley had the temporary power to decide who leads the lame-duck
Senate because, after the death in late October of Sen. Paul
Wellstone (D-Minn.), the Senate has 49 Democrats, 49 Republicans and
independent James M. Jeffords of Vermont, who sides with the
Democrats on leadership matters.</TE>
<TE>   Barkley replaces Wellstone until the winner of last week's Senate
election in Minnesota, Republican Norm Coleman, is seated.</TE>
<TE>   If Barkley had decided to side with the GOP, that would have given
Republicans 50 seats -- and thus the majority, because Vice President
Dick Cheney has the power to break the tie.</TE>

<HD>8 Cuban Refugees Fly to Key West</HD>
<DH>National Guard fighter pilots order the small plane to
land. INS is interviewing the group.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anna Virtue and John J. Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>A pilot seeking asylum crowded a group of his relatives into a small,
government-owned cargo plane and flew Monday from Cuba to Florida,
landing safely at Key West International Airport.</LD>
<LD>   Two Florida National Guard F-16 fighters scrambled to intercept
the yellow Soviet-made Antonov-2 Colt biplane once it appeared on
U.S. radar screens after taking off from Pinar del Rio in western
Cuba.</LD>
<LD>   The fighter pilots ordered the aircraft to land as local police
and federal agents waited alongside the runway.</LD>
<TE>   Four men, three women and a 2-year-old girl were crammed aboard
the small plane.</TE>
<TE>   "We are interviewing the individuals who arrived aboard the plane
and we will have more information to share with you in due course,"
said Karen Kraushaar, a spokeswoman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Cubans who reached the United States seeking asylum
generally have been assured the right to stay and eventually apply
for permanent residency.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Sellers, vice president of Island City Flying Service, which
is based at the airport, said the plane suddenly appeared in a
cloudless blue sky, and landed as the jet fighters flew overhead.</TE>
<TE>   "It is pretty busy on Veterans Day, and they actually shut down
the airport for about 20 minutes because of all the activity,"
Sellers said.</TE>
<TE>   He said that federal officials took the Cubans into a room for
questioning, and after a while the pilot emerged and moved the plane
to a different location at the airfield.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, a State Department official said that although it
was not the lead agency handling the incident, "we may have some sort
of advisory role down the line."</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration said
that once the fighters were mobilized, the agency was notified that
the plane was coming to Florida.</TE>
<TE>   After the landing, bomb-sniffing dogs searched the plane, but
found no evidence of explosives or contraband.</TE>
<TE>   But the flight was clearly uncomfortable. The aircraft was rigged
to carry cargo and contained only three seats for passengers outside
the cockpit, a local airline employee said.</TE>
<TE>   "They seemed pretty glad to be here," Rick Ellson, an employee of
Cape Air, an airline serving Key West, told WPLG-TV in Florida. "They
had smiles on their faces, and were walking relaxed."</TE>
<TE>   The Cuban government had no immediate comment about the incident.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, asylum seekers have used a variety of aircraft to
leave the island, only a short flight from Florida.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, a defecting pilot landed a twin-engine transport operated
by Cuba's Aero Caribbean, carrying 52 other people, in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Later, the co-pilot and four of those on board returned to Cuba
with the aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   A stolen crop duster carrying 10 people from Cuba crashed in the
Gulf of Mexico in September 2000 when the pilot decided to ditch the
plane, which was short on fuel.</TE>
<TE>   Rescuers found nine people clinging to wreckage about 60 miles
from Cuba, but one of the refugees drowned.</TE>

<HD>Government Considers Trying Moussaoui in a Military Court</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. officials, concerned that a public trial of accused Sept. 11
conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui might prove embarrassing or hamper
anti-terrorism efforts, are weighing the option of dismissing charges
and instead trying the Frenchman before a military tribunal.</LD>
<LD>   A senior Defense Department official and sources familiar with the
case said Monday that Pentagon and Justice Department officials have
been discussing the option of having Moussaoui face a military
tribunal instead of standing trial as planned before a jury in
federal court in Virginia.</LD>
<LD>   No decision has been made, but talks have been taking place amid
concerns over requests made by Moussaoui and his team of stand-by
lawyers who are seeking access to evidence and witnesses viewed by
the government as sensitive.</LD>
<TE>   One source familiar with the case said the idea of dropping
civilian charges had been debated ever since the defense asked for
access to some senior Al Qaeda members in U.S. custody.</TE>
<TE>   They include Abu Zubeida and Ramzi Binalshibh. Zubeida and
Binalshibh are believed to be the two most senior Al Qaeda members
captured since the United States launched a war on the terrorist
network it blames for the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Binalshibh is named as a co-conspirator in the indictment that
charges Moussaoui with six counts of conspiracy -- four of which
carry the death penalty -- in the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Zubeida, one of Osama bin Laden's top deputies, and Binalshibh are
being interrogated outside the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui, who was arrested in August 2001 on immigration charges,
denied involvement in the airline hijackings but admitted to being a
member of Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui's trial has been delayed twice and is now due to begin
in June.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui, who is not an attorney but is acting as his own lawyer,
and the court-appointed counsel named to assist him have filed sealed
requests to the federal court to get access to Binalshibh and
Zubeida.</TE>
<TE>   The government, particularly the Defense Department, does not want
to permit access and has cited national security concerns in arguing
its point.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui's team has argued that he would be denied his
constitutional rights if he is not permitted access to witnesses who
may be able to prove his innocence.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers familiar with the case say U.S. District Judge Leonie
Brinkema has the option of requiring the government to produce the
evidence or the witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   The government could refuse, and possibly drop the charges and
bring Moussaoui before a military tribunal, the lawyers said.
Alternatively, if the government refuses, Brinkema could dismiss the
case and the government could then find a way to make Moussaoui face
charges in a military tribunal, the lawyers added.</TE>

<DL>MOSSY GROVE, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>On the morning after, Tammy Pennington was looking for her kitchen.</LD>
<LD>   The rest of her trailer home she had found, more or less. Scraps
of the frame were dangling from a tree. Other shards were strewn
about a muddy field. She had even tracked down her sofa, her
treadmill, her linoleum floor -- or rather, their shredded remains.
The kitchen, though, was gone.</LD>
<LD>   Then a neighbor came by and said it had been spotted an eighth of
a mile down the road, plunked in a pasture, surrounded by grazing
cows and drifting tufts of yellow insulation. One question answered.</LD>
<TE>   Too many more achingly unresolved.</TE>
<TE>   Dazed residents of Tennessee, Alabama and Ohio spent Monday
picking through vast piles of rubble, looking for friends, for
belongings, for anything familiar after about 70 tornadoes, a few of
them extraordinarily powerful, cut a broad swath of wreckage across
several states over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   At least 36 people died in the storms and hundreds were injured.
Scores of houses were obliterated, several manufacturing plants were
destroyed, uncounted cars and trucks and trailers were lifted,
twisted, hurled into the raging funnel clouds that pulverized whole
communities.</TE>
<TE>   The band of tornadoes and accompanying thunderstorms stretched
from Pennsylvania to Louisiana. They swept across the region in
waves, from late Saturday to early Monday, catching victims as they
drove home from church, as they huddled in their basements, as they
tracked radar images of the violent weather on TV.</TE>
<TE>   The death toll consisted of 17 victims in Tennessee, 12 in
Alabama, five in Ohio and one each in Pennsylvania and Mississippi.
Scores of people were still unaccounted for late Monday -- though no
one could say whether they were buried under homes or simply unable
to communicate because of downed phone lines.</TE>
<TE>   "We need the prayers of everyone in the country," Tennessee Gov.
Don Sundquist said.</TE>
<TE>   Touring this devastated mountain community by helicopter on a
tauntingly sunny afternoon, Sundquist said the twister that nailed
Mossy Grove late Sunday may well have been an F5 -- the most severe
classification on the Fujita scale. Such storms can pack winds
topping 300 mph, though they account for just 1% of the roughly 1,000
tornadoes that hit the United States each year.</TE>
<TE>   At least seven people were killed here in eastern Tennessee,
including 73-year-old Marjie Williams and her son Michael, 47, who
lived a few doors apart in homes that the wind ripped to splinters in
the roaring confusion of the night.</TE>
<TE>   An exhausted James Williams -- Marjie's son, Michael's brother --
searched the wreckage on Monday afternoon, drawing on a Marlboro
Light. He set aside papers that looked important. He scavenged the
block for his brother's prized gun collection. "Hard to believe," he
mumbled. "Unreal." He found an old-fashioned wooden telephone booth
his brother had restored. It was about the only intact item in what
was left of the house.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish he could have gotten inside this," James Williams said,
staring at the booth. "He might have made it."</TE>
<TE>   A few hundred miles north, in Van Wert, Ohio, authorities said the
funnel clouds that raked the farm country near the Indiana line may
have rated F4, with winds up to 260 mph. The storm killed two,
demolished at least 26 homes and destroyed several industrial plants,
leaving up to 500 workers jobless, said Hugh Saunier of the county
Emergency Management Agency.</TE>
<TE>   It could have been a lot worse.</TE>
<TE>   Just moments before the tornado touched down, a quick-thinking
manager herded dozens of parents and children out of the movie
theater where they were watching "The Santa Clause 2." The twister
ripped the roof off the theater and tossed two cars inside, on the
blue-cushioned seats. But the moviegoers, hunkered down in the
cinderblock lobby of the theater, survived unscathed.</TE>
<TE>   Similar stories of close calls echoed in the makeshift shelters
set up in churches, civic centers and schools in several states.</TE>
<TE>   Many people managed to escape serious injury thanks in part to
early-warning sirens. In some places, most notably Van Wert, alarms
began sounding up to half an hour before the worst winds hit.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing much better at forecasting and warning," said Chuck
Doswell, a tornado expert with the National Severe Storms Laboratory
in Norman, Okla. He recalled a similar band of storms stretching from
Canada to the Gulf of Mexico in April 1974 -- a system that killed 10
times as many people. In May 1999, another swarm of 70-plus tornadoes
-- including some rated F5 -- killed 50 people in Oklahoma and
Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   "We have reduced the death toll from tornadoes considerably,"
Doswell said.</TE>
<TE>   This weekend's fierce weather can be blamed, Doswell said, on the
"cliche of clashing air masses." The weather was unseasonably warm in
much of the Midwest and South -- up to 80 degrees and humid. But cold
air rushing down from Canada in the upper atmosphere created
instability. The inevitable clash set up powerful, whirling storms
that dropped golf ball-sized hail on some towns and funnel clouds on
others.</TE>
<TE>   Though the traditional tornado season is spring, meteorologists
said autumn twisters are fairly common across the South and Midwest.</TE>
<TE>   Still, at least here in eastern Tennessee, no one seemed prepared
for the scene they awoke to.</TE>
<TE>   Teddy bears and front doors were tossed helter-skelter across
fields. A lawn mower hung from a tree. Several houses were peeled
open, as if a giant can opener had popped off their front facades.
The closet was open in one exposed bedroom, revealing a neat row of
hanging clothes, none of it so much as wrinkled. Fluffy bits of pink
and yellow insulation were snagged on bushes all over town -- an
oddly cheery sight in the bleak landscape.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday night had been a roaring, vibrating chaos of clunks and
rips and screams. "Find my babies!" one woman had wailed as the winds
died down, her voice echoing through the shattered streets.</TE>
<TE>   Monday morning, the sounds were more orderly, more predictable --
but still heartbreaking.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Freels, a 31-year-old machinist, picked his way over the
punched-in walls of his house, pointing out his computer room, his
living room, his carport -- none of them recognizable to anyone but
him. His face was cut, his knee was bruised and his house was
destroyed, but he pronounced himself grateful.</TE>
<TE>   Freels had pushed his mother, wife and 9-year-old daughter into
the bathtub as the storm screeched toward them -- a trick he
remembered hearing on the Discovery Channel. There was no room for
him, so he crouched beside the tub. Then the lights went out. Rain
drenched his clothes. His ears filled up with mud. He came to, with a
start, and realized at once that his home had collapsed all around
him. But a few yards away, he heard his wife and daughter and mother
shouting from the bathtub -- amazingly, exultantly, alive.</TE>
<TE>   "We should not have made it, but we did," Freels said, his voice
still shaky. His daughter, Lindsay, picked one of her old beauty
pageant trophies out of the rubble.</TE>
<TE>   "This would make a believer out of you," Freels said.</TE>

<HD>Gene Therapy Undergoes a Reevaluation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rosie Mestel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gene therapy has become a science of irony and unintended
consequences.</LD>
<LD>   Through its decades of development, the once-glamorous child of
the genetic revolution has faced bad press, lackluster results and a
tragic death. Now, fast on the heels of its first-ever success -- and
one of its biggest disappointments -- the field is having to
reevaluate its use of a principal method of inserting therapeutic
genes into cells.</LD>
<LD>   The upheaval has placed new emphasis on a range of experimental
strategies that hold great promise but are technically difficult and
will take even more time to become useable in the clinic.</LD>
<TE>   Those strategies include ways to control the placement of
therapeutic genes so they don't damage the genome, implement precise
DNA repair methods so no new, potentially dangerous genetic
information is added to a patient, and create "suicide" genes that
are programmed to wipe out genetically altered cells if anything
should go wrong.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the upheaval is one small child. Not long ago,
researchers were reveling in the apparent cure of nine French
children afflicted with the rare immune system disorder, X-SCID,
commonly known as "bubble boy" disease. Then, a few weeks ago, the
researchers announced that one of the children has leukemia --
caused, they suspect, by the therapy itself.</TE>
<TE>   Risks that were once only theoretical have become real. Promising
strategies that seemed to overcome enormous hurdles may have to be
scrapped. Concerns by some scientists and bioethicists that the
endeavor has moved too quickly to the clinic have found a more
emphatic voice.</TE>
<TE>   "This is definitely an attention-getter, a wake-up call for
everybody, and we need more information," said Dr. Kenneth Weinberg,
professor of pediatrics at USC and a physician at Childrens Hospital
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Many scientists still see ultimate promise for the gene therapy.
But they cannot predict its fate for the foreseeable future: whether
it will be only a niche science for the treatment of the most extreme
diseases for which sizable risks are worth taking or, as scientists
have long envisioned, a broader strategy for tackling a range of
ills, from blindness to baldness.</TE>
<TE>   "At the very best, it looks like this will add years and years to
the clinical development of gene therapy," said Dr. Alan Schechter,
chief of the laboratory of chemical biology at the National Institute
of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Gene therapy is a prospect that has long touched deep nerves among
the public and magnified both hope and revulsion, causing unrealistic
expectations and extreme reactions when things go wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists too were seduced by its clean logic, often rushing too
quickly to make promises of cures and then facing a backlash when
trials failed.</TE>
<TE>   "There was the impression among some people that it was going to
be rather easy. You have the disease, you put in the gene and
correction would be pretty straightforward," said Dr. Theodore
Friedmann, director of the gene therapy program at UC San Diego.
"There was too much hype, too much downplaying of the problems."</TE>
<TE>   Scientists had known for decades that many inherited diseases were
because of errors in individual genes. As the genetic revolution
gathered momentum -- and scientists learned how to manipulate DNA --
the notion of mending errors no longer seemed fantastic.</TE>
<TE>   Ideally, doctors could correct the genetic error in cells where
the gene was required (lung cells, say, in people with cystic
fibrosis), leaving the rest of the genome untouched. Such tidy fixes
are technically very difficult.</TE>
<TE>   A messier, but easier, strategy is to add a good gene to a cell
without getting rid of the faulty one. That's what scientists do in
today's gene therapy trials, and what was used in the French case.</TE>
<TE>   Getting a gene to its target isn't easy, so scientists have turned
to viruses, which are tailor-made to steal through the body and enter
cells. The disease-causing parts of the virus DNA are removed, the
therapeutic gene spliced in, and the whole thing wrapped up in the
virus coat. Then the hybrid creation is added to the body.</TE>
<TE>   Today, there is a medley of "viral vectors" capable of entering a
variety of tissues. Gene therapists pick the ones to suit the disease
they're trying to cure, which today includes everything from
inherited diseases to HIV infections and cancers.</TE>
<TE>   For some therapies (such as for cancer), a gene doesn't have to
stay permanently or be passed on to new cells if the original cell
divides. In those cases, a virus that efficiently enters cells but
eventually dies away fits the bill.</TE>
<TE>   In other cases, such as inherited diseases like cystic fibrosis, a
repair has to be permanent. Here, the use of special viruses that
insert their genetic material into cells' genomes ensures that the
fix is replicated when cells divide.</TE>
<TE>   Using such methods, researchers have cured mice by the thousands
-- of hemophilia and sickle cell disease, of diabetes and cystic
fibrosis.</TE>
<TE>   But they have learned, to their pain, that mice are not people.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, it was with great excitement that the field received news of
its first human cure of 9 out of 10 young children treated for
X-SCID. The trial was led by Dr. Alain Fischer of Necker Hospital in
Paris.</TE>
<TE>   For once, the news was not only good but spectacularly so. And so
it remained through the summer.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Labor Day weekend, and gene therapists working on
similar SCID trials received an upsetting e-mail from Fischer
reporting that one of the successfully treated boys had a sickness
resembling leukemia.</TE>
<TE>   In response, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration halted four
gene therapy trials, although an advisory panel has since recommended
that the studies resume.</TE>
<TE>   In a sign of the field's uncertainty, Britain has opted to
continue with its trial for the same disease, while Germany has put a
temporary stop to all trials using viruses that insert therapeutic
genes into the genome.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the most successful study in the history of gene
therapy, so to have one's worst fears realized in the context of this
trial was really upsetting," said Dr. Donald Kohn, director of the
gene, immune and stem cell therapy program at Childrens Hospital Los
Angeles and a professor at USC. Kohn is leading one of the gene
therapy trials halted by the FDA.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists are still trying to figure out what happened to the
child. He may have been at special risk for cancer: Several members
of his family had developed a rare brain tumor.</TE>
<TE>   This much is clear: When the viral vector jumped into the genome
of one of the boy's bone marrow stem cells, it apparently disrupted a
gene (known as LMO2) that, when altered, can push a cell toward
cancer. After several years, cells with that insertion started
dividing out of control.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists have long known that something like this could happen
because viruses insert themselves into the genome at random sites.
There was always the chance that their landing could damage a gene,
but only a very small chance because the genome is vast and large
swaths of it don't consist of genes.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in at least one young child, the very unlikely has apparently
happened.</TE>
<TE>   Now, scientists must evaluate the chance of it happening again.
Researchers suspect that the risks for SCID may turn out to be higher
than for other therapies because the viruses insert more frequently
into the cells treated in SCID than they do into other kinds of
tissues. This might increase the likelihood of a rare, dangerous
event.</TE>
<TE>   Gene therapy trials that don't insert genes into the genome are
not directly affected by the French case. But the trials that use
such strategies -- about half of the 181 underway in the U.S. -- now
face the possibility that random insertion may be too risky.</TE>
<TE>   Dark clouds have blown over the field in the past.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, a UCLA physician conducted the first gene therapy trial
-- overseas, because his university had denied him permission. The
trial, to correct an inherited blood disorder, beta-thalassemia, was
a scandalous ethics breach that sullied the field from the start.</TE>
<TE>   A chilly cold front moved in during 1995, when the director of the
National Institutes of Health roasted the field for skimping on
groundwork and hyping the therapy after a string of unsuccessful
experiments.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, a teenage boy died from a violent immune reaction during
a gene therapy trial. Afterward, hundreds of other unreported side
effects came to light, and noted scientists decried gene therapy's
premature rush to the clinic.</TE>
<TE>   Some say the field never recovered from the succession of errors
and ethics breaches.</TE>
<TE>   "Gene therapy is a wheezing, very sick organism," said Arthur
Caplan, chairman of the department of medical ethics at the
University of Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   Several scientists said that the gene therapy field has learned
hard lessons, and that in the French case, Fischer and the government
agencies responded quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Gene therapy supporters believe the field also can overcome the
technical hurdles.</TE>
<TE>   "These are all tough problems," said Inder Verma, professor of
molecular biology at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La
Jolla. "But necessity, you know, is the mother of invention."</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Stanford University scientists say they've figured
out a way to shuttle a gene into a cell and have it leap into the
genome at only a few, precise places.</TE>
<TE>   The feat is achieved using an enzyme (derived from a
bacteria-eating virus) that recognizes particular parts of the genome
and guides the DNA to insert at those points. By removing the
randomness from insertion, the scientists hope they can render it
safe.</TE>
<TE>   They already have shown that their strategy can deliver genes into
precise locations in the genome of mice, creating animals that
produce a key clotting factor that is missing in many patients with
hemophilia.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists also are trying to use viruses that never or rarely
jump into genomes, yet hang around in the cell for the long haul.
Scientists at Stanford, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and
Avigen Inc., an Alameda-based biotech company, have treated
hemophiliac dogs with a blood-clotting gene spliced into what may be
such a viral vector.</TE>
<TE>   Even if genes are inserted into the genome, there are other ways
to cut down on risk.</TE>
<TE>   In some trials -- such as the French case -- a patient's cells are
genetically altered in a test tube, and then added back to the body.
Theoretically, scientists could screen these cells before returning
them, in order to weed out ones with insertions in dangerous places.</TE>
<TE>   Alternatively, a so-called suicide gene could be put in the virus
along with the therapeutic gene. If the cell turns rogue -- becomes
cancerous, for instance -- scientists can give the patient a drug
that will activate the suicide gene, and the rogue cells will then be
killed. Such a strategy has proved successful in one gene therapy
trial.</TE>
<TE>   But the ideal solution is to perfectly fix a genetic error without
introducing any extra DNA, like the deft replacement of a spent
battery in a car.</TE>
<TE>   One strategy coaxes the cell to repair the error using tiny pieces
of genetic material as guides. Another cuts out the bad part of a
gene and stitches in a good piece to replace it.</TE>
<TE>   Both strategies are technically feasible but are years away from
the clinic.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, researchers say, all the animal experiments in the
world won't prevent unexpected results in people.</TE>
<TE>   Unpredictability is the nature of medical research. Bone marrow
transplantation, chemotherapy, vaccine development -- all have hurt
and killed people before being assigned to their appropriate medical
niche.</TE>
<TE>   "These are early days in the field, but I think it would be
foolhardy to concentrate only on the dangers now," Friedmann said.
"We know that patients can be helped."</TE>

<HD>In City of the Gods, War Was a Way of Life</HD>
<DH>New discoveries reveal that Mexico's Teotihuacan was not
the peaceful, pastoral culture experts long thought it was.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas H. Maugh II</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A series of discoveries by a Japanese archeologist is shattering the
long-held belief that the inhabitants of Mexico's mysterious
Teotihuacan -- the City of the Gods -- were a peaceful people who
managed to build a metropolis without having a warlike despot
typically associated with vast empires.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, excavations of several structures have shown that the
people of Teotihuacan (pronounced TAY-oh-TEE-wa-CON), whose origin
and ultimate fate are unknown, were as warlike as their Mayan
contemporaries, and the Aztec and Inca who came after them.</LD>
<LD>   Digging inside the massive edifices of the city, archeologist
Saburo Sugiyama has unearthed the bodies of hundreds of bound
captives, indicating that the city's rulers were well-versed in
mayhem.</LD>
<TE>   Last month inside the Pyramid of the Moon, Sugiyama found the
first burial site for high-level officials ever discovered in the
city. It was not the grave of a king, but certainly that of priests
or other administrators. "Nobody has ever found anything like this"
at Teotihuacan, he said, adding that the discoveries may change
forever how the city is viewed.</TE>
<TE>   Through the centuries, Teotihuacan has remained one of the most
impenetrable mysteries of Mesoamerica.</TE>
<TE>   At its peak, the city -- about 30 miles north of Mexico City --
covered at least 8 square miles, making it larger than Imperial Rome.
Its estimated population of 150,000 exceeded that of Washington,
D.C., during Abraham Lincoln's presidency, about 1,300 years later.
It was the largest city in the New World during its ascendancy and
one of the largest in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Yet remarkably little is known about it.</TE>
<TE>   Archeologists cannot read the Teotihuacanos' writings -- and are
not even sure whether the inscriptions they have seen are, in fact,
writings. They don't know who built the city, what they called
themselves, how they spread their control over much of Mesoamerica,
or why they abruptly disappeared in the 7th century, 800 years after
the city's birth. The abandoned city and its monuments were given
their current names by the Aztecs, who discovered the remnants when
they moved into the region in the late 1400s and were convinced the
city had a supernatural origin.</TE>
<TE>   Sugiyama's recent discoveries have begun to unveil a tiny piece of
the city's culture. In addition to the bodies of three officials, the
tomb contained jade objects -- from as far away as the Motagua Valley
of Guatemala -- carved in Mayan style, including a spectacular jade
statuette of a person with relatively realistic features and big
eyes. Such objects were typically used as a symbol of rulers or royal
family members in Mayan society.</TE>
<TE>   "The offerings strongly suggest a direct relation between the
Teotihuacan ruling group and the Mayan royal families," Sugiyama
said. "For the first time, we have data indicating a Mayan royal
class connection at Teotihuacan, from the heart of one of the city's
major monuments."</TE>
<TE>   Scientists previously found evidence of Teotihuacan influence in
Mayan and other cultures, but this discovery marks the first evidence
that cultural influence moved in the opposite direction.</TE>
<TE>   "The archeological evidence appears to point toward Teotihuacanos
intervening in Mayan politics," said archeologist George Cowgill of
Arizona State University, one of the foremost experts on the city.</TE>
<TE>   "But many people still dispute that there was really any
significant influence because they were two distinctly different
cultures. Dr. Sugiyama's discovery makes it all more complicated by
adding some big new pieces to the puzzle. It certainly makes it
harder to see the Maya as not much influenced by Teotihuacan."</TE>
<TE>   What has long puzzled archeologists are the widespread pictures of
plants, animals, commoners and gods on monuments in the city. The
images have led many researchers to speculate that it was a peaceful,
pastoral culture, ruled not by mighty kings but by the collective
will of the people -- a kind of Athens of Mesoamerica. The lack of
inscriptions on the monuments, it has been suggested, reflects the
absence of strong leaders driven by a need to glorify their reigns.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a mystery," says archeologist Ruben Cabrera of Mexico's
National Institute of Anthropology and History. "Why didn't they
depict rulers?"</TE>
<TE>   Historian Esther Pasztory of Columbia University in New York
suggests Teotihuacan was an egalitarian republic markedly different
from contemporaneous civilizations. Her 1997 book, "Teotihuacan: An
Experiment in Living," argues that the people of Teotihuacan
refrained from glorifying rulers because they wished to create the
image of an integrated community.</TE>
<TE>   Pasztory says researchers such as Sugiyama and Cowgill are trying
to force the city into a single-ruler model that is more comfortable
for them. "The model is something like ancient Egypt, but Teotihuacan
is not Egypt. It is a very special place," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Sugiyama and others argue that the absence of textual
inscriptions is a reflection of the cosmopolitan nature of the city.
In recent years, archeologists have shown that the city's residents
included Pacific Coast Zapotecs, Mayans and other nationalities, as
well as the indigenous population.</TE>
<TE>   "In a cosmopolitan city, one language isn't going to be understood
by everyone, so symbolic images are easier to understand," Sugiyama
said.</TE>
<TE>   Sugiyama's Japanese ancestry might seem to make him an unlikely
candidate to decipher a Mexican city's past. When he first came to
Mexico in 1979, he didn't speak any Spanish and his only knowledge of
the country came from books. But those books had triggered an intense
interest in Mexican history and culture -- especially that of
Teotihuacan -- and he has been working there ever since, either as an
associate with Mexico's National Institute, as a professor at Arizona
State or in his current position at Aichi Prefectural University in
Japan.</TE>
<TE>   He made his first major discovery in 1983, while digging around
the Temple of the Feathered Serpent, a smaller structure a little
more than a mile south of the Pyramid of the Moon. He unearthed a
massive burial site containing 18 sacrificed men, the first evidence
of such ruthless behavior. The men were dressed as soldiers and
buried with obsidian-tipped spears and other weapons.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to discover why the men were sacrificed -- perhaps as
an offering to a god, or maybe to commemorate the death of a ruler --
Sugiyama, Cowgill and Cabrera in 1988 began tunneling into the
temple. They immediately found the remains of about 200 more
warriors, most buried with their hands behind their backs as though
they were bound.</TE>
<TE>   Continuing their excavation toward the center of the temple, the
team was shocked to intersect a jagged tunnel. Following it to the
center, they found the remains of 20 more sacrificed soldiers.
Disappointingly, they also found three large pits that had apparently
been emptied by looters.</TE>
<TE>   "There might have been one or two tombs of rulers," Cowgill said.
"We don't know. I suspect that's what it was, but we don't have the
hard evidence."</TE>
<TE>   Ten years later, convinced that the pyramids must have been burial
sites for royalty, Sugiyama and Cabrera turned to the Pyramid of the
Moon, a massive structure 450 feet by 420 feet wide at the base and
more than 120 feet tall.</TE>
<TE>   Because the pyramid was built in as many as seven successive
stages, its interior is filled with a mixture of boulders, rocks and
loose soil. The possibility of collapse makes the tunneling slow
going: The team is lucky if it can dig and reinforce a yard of tunnel
in a day. But the same conditions may very well have kept out
looters.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the pair discovered a burial chamber with a wealth of
artifacts, including greenstone statuettes, figurines fashioned from
obsidian, obsidian knives, mirrors, two jaguars in a wooden cage and
seven large birds.</TE>
<TE>   The chamber held only one body, and the team initially thought it
had finally found a ruler. But when the skeleton was fully excavated,
it was found to have been buried with its hands behind its back, as
though bound. The body was also unadorned.</TE>
<TE>   The team had more luck this year. Digging in a level dating from
about AD 350, corresponding to the construction of the sixth stage of
the pyramid, Sugiyama and Cabrera found another burial chamber, this
one with three bodies.</TE>
<TE>   "Unlike the earlier burials we've discovered in the Pyramid of the
Moon, these three bodies didn't have their hands tied," Sugiyama
said. "In addition, they were found in a cross-legged seated
position, which is very rarely, if ever, found in burials here.</TE>
<TE>   "The position can, however, be seen in images in murals,
sculptures or figurines of priests, gods and warriors in Teotihuacan
and other related sites."</TE>
<TE>   Similar body positioning has been found in burials of Mayan elite.</TE>
<TE>   The three bodies are all male and are estimated to have been about
50 at the time of burial. All three bodies were lavishly adorned.
"They have the richest ornaments ever found in a burial at
Teotihuacan after more than a century of research," Sugiyama said.</TE>
<TE>   The bodies were also surrounded by offerings of very high quality.
"If we had found only one of these bodies, we would suspect that he
had been a ruler or at least a royal family member, but we discovered
three," Sugiyama said. "That leaves us with critical questions of
identification that still need to be resolved."</TE>
<TE>   Sugiyama thinks the presence of the bodies suggests there is a
royal tomb nearby. But that discovery, if it is there, will have to
wait until next year. In mid-October, he had to close the site and
return to his teaching job for the fall semester.</TE>

<LD>Major league teams can begin making offers to players other than
their own today, but the Dodgers won't be breaking from that gate, or
as General Manager Dan Evans put it, "right now, I don't want to be a
pretender in the market. We're here on a fact-finding mission, seeing
what other clubs need, sorting out the value of our own players."</LD>
<LD>   Evans would like to discover Christmas in November.</LD>
<LD>   He would like to learn that Eric Karros and Mark Grudzielanek have
unexpected value, opening a creative door to moving their roster and
payroll inhibiting contracts, letting the Dodgers improve the
offense.</LD>
<TE>   Without that flexibility, from a financial and position
standpoint, Evans said, he is virtually handcuffed.</TE>
<TE>   No big money offer to a free-agent hitter.</TE>
<TE>   No big money offer at this early juncture to a left-handed
reliever of free-agent Mike Remlinger's stature.</TE>
<TE>   Remlinger has rejected a three-year, $6-million offer to re-sign
with the Atlanta Braves, and the market on left-handed relievers of
any age is such that all 30 clubs are probably in it.</TE>
<TE>   Consider that a senior named Jesse Orosco has already heard from
the Angels (who may be forced to trade Scott Schoeneweis if he
insists on starting) and San Diego Padres, complicating even that
possible avenue for the Dodgers, who have already guaranteed $95
million to 12 players and insist they won't surpass the luxury tax
threshold of $117.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   For now, burdened with Karros and Grudzielanek, Evans has to be
satisfied with small rewards.</TE>
<TE>   Monday, for instance, was the deadline for players who were traded
with multi-year contracts to exercise their right to demand a trade,
but relief pitchers Paul Shuey and Paul Quantrill chose not to follow
Brian Jordan, who had previously exercised that right. With Shuey and
Quantrill locked in for 2003, Evans said it further stabilizes the
bullpen and illustrates how far the Dodgers have progressed in less
than a year.</TE>
<TE>   "When you think back to last spring we had no idea even who our
closer would be or that we'd find him right in the barracks in Vero
Beach," he said, referring to Eric Gagne.</TE>
<TE>   For the now limited Dodgers, similar surprises may be harder to
find.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The new and restrictive bargaining agreement, combined with the
industry wide budget tightening, is expected to create a cold winter
for free agents and arbitration-eligible players who may not be
tendered contracts in December, but it won't slow the Phillies, the
one club expected to come storming out of the gate today.</TE>
<TE>   Pegged to a core of promising young players and increased revenue
when they move into a new ballpark in 2004, the Phillies are expected
to make a five-year, $75-million offer to first baseman Jim Thome
today, plus three-year offers to Tom Glavine and David Bell.</TE>
<TE>   "We're willing to advance the payroll ($58 million this year) as a
bridge into the new facility," General Manager Ed Wade said. "We feel
we have a club that's both built for the long term and close to
winning."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oakland General Manager Billy Beane is believed to have turned
down a five-year, $12.5-million offer from the Boston Red Sox, along
with the use of a private jet and an apartment in Newport Beach to
facilitate visits with his 12-year-old daughter, Casey, who lives
with his first wife.</TE>
<TE>   Beane, who was scheduled to arrive at the general managers
meetings Monday night, acknowledged in a conference call from Oakland
that he found the prospect of becoming Boston's general
manager--"arguably one of the most prestigious jobs in all of
sports," he said--to be intoxicating, and at one point agreed to the
offer only to be swept by remorse.</TE>
<TE>   Beane said he felt that he would be "steamrolling the personal
side of my life," and that from a personal and professional
standpoint "I felt I'd be cheating everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Where that leaves the Red Sox, who did manage to re-sign pitcher
Tim Wakefield to a three-year, $13-million contract Monday, is
unclear. However, there was rampant speculation late Monday that
Boston would entrust the general manager position to 27-year-old Theo
Epstein, a Harvard graduate who apprenticed in San Diego under
General Manager Kevin Towers and former Padre president Larry
Lucchino, who hired Epstein in Boston when Lucchino became the Red
Sox president.</TE>
<TE>   The impression is that the Red Sox would surround Epstein with a
veteran group of baseball people.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seattle is expected to name Lou Piniella's successor as manager on
Wednesday, and Dodger bench coach Jim Riggleman remains at the
forefront of the four finalists.</TE>
<TE>   "He definitely had the best references," a Mariner official said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have hired lawyer Mark Rosenthal to handle contract
negotiations and arbitration hearings. Rosenthal formally worked for
the Angels, signing many of their current players.</TE>

<HD>Ohio State No. 1 in BCS</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One day after Miami was hailed with unanimous consent as the nation's
top team in the writers' and the coaches' polls, the Hurricanes got
news Monday that Ohio State was the new No. 1 in the bowl
championship series standings.</LD>
<LD>   The BCS ... go figure.</LD>
<LD>   So, does Ohio State owe its position to that whopping 10-6 victory
at Purdue?</LD>
<TE>   Actually, it was former BCS No. 1 Oklahoma's loss at Texas A&amp;M
that pushed the Buckeyes, for now, to the top.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State and Miami, Nos .2 and 3 in last week's BCS standings,
each moved up one position this week and seized at least temporary
control of the national title race.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State is first with 3.41 points. Miami is second at 4.10.</TE>
<TE>   Although well off the pace, Washington State jumped two spots to
No. 3 this week with 8.77 points, followed by No. 4 Oklahoma with
10.05 and No. 5 Texas at 11.50.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State's lead hangs on its advantage over Miami in the
quality-win component. Ohio State trails Miami by .11 in the
composite total, but gets a .8 deduction for having defeated No. 3
Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   A school is rewarded for wins against top-10 opponents, but that
point deduction is based on where the defeated team finishes in the
final BCS standings.</TE>
<TE>   Miami has yet to earn quality win points, but would get a
deduction if No. 11 Florida State cracks the BCS top 10.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State was a big weekend winner, although it remains to
be seen whether the Cougars, who have two byes over the next three
weekends, can hang onto that spot.</TE>
<TE>   The schools with the two lowest totals in the final BCS standings
-- a point system based on poll average, a computer component,
losses, strength of schedule and quality wins -- will play for the
BCS national title in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State and Miami figure to be a lock for the title game, so
long as they finish the season as the only undefeated teams in
Division I-A football.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't matter to Miami and Ohio State whether they finish
first or second in the BCS, although it could be very important to
the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   If Ohio State is No. 1, the Rose Bowl will get the first pick
among remaining at-large selections. If Miami is No. 1, the Orange
Bowl will get the pick. This could be critical in a possible battle
over Notre Dame if it is BCS eligible.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl also faces the prickly possibility of having to snub
11-1 Iowa, even though the Hawkeyes would be the Rose Bowl's
preferred choice to replace Ohio State.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears there is a set of circumstances that could be
problematic," Rose Bowl CEO Mitch Dorger said.</TE>
<TE>   Under BCS rules, Texas is guaranteed an at-large berth if the
Longhorns finish No. 3 in the final BCS standings (Texas gets in at
No. 4 under certain circumstances) and Notre Dame, No. 7 this week,
is guaranteed a berth if it finishes sixth or better.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl could end up with Notre Dame, not a bad fallback
position, at the expense of Iowa, a member of a conference, the Big
Ten, that shares a long partnership with the Rose Bowl.</TE>

<HD>Burk: Pressure on Johnson Coming From Within Club</HD>

<LD>Martha Burk, chair of the National Council of Women's Organizations,
said she was surprised only by the timing of Augusta National Golf
Club chairman Hootie Johnson's message that the club would not alter
its membership policy to admit a female member.</LD>
<LD>   "Somebody, not Martha Burk, has apparently been applying some
heavy pressure on him, for him to speak out when he hasn't for the
last nine months," said Burk, who has been spearheading the campaign
to persuade the exclusive club to admit a woman as a member.</LD>
<LD>   "Is there some internal conflict at the club? My guess is there
is. It's quite a slap in the face of Lloyd Ward and Kenneth Chenault,
who said the policy needed to be changed."</LD>
<TE>   Ward, chief executive officer of the United States Olympic
Committee, and Chenault, chairman and chief executive of American
Express, are members at Augusta National. Both released letters to
the media in support of Burk and the NCWO.</TE>
<TE>   "[Johnson] must be trying to quell a rebellion within his own
ranks," Burk said. "Otherwise, what's new here? Why [speak out] now?</TE>
<TE>   "If he's saying, 'We will prevail,' I think he's got the wrong
'we' there.</TE>
<TE>   "I find it very sad that anybody of his alleged stature ... could
take a stand that says sex discrimination does not rise to the level
of race discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very sad that Mr. Johnson is willing to subject the club to
more months of conflict and turmoil."</TE>

<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>As time passes, the Clippers look less and less like a bunch of guys
meeting for a friendly pickup game on their lunch hour. Much of it
has to do with the man who would rather pass than shoot the
basketball.</LD>
<LD>   Injuries played a significant role in the team's disjointed play
in some recent games. After all, Elton Brand, Michael Olowokandi and
Quentin Richardson sat out almost all of training camp because of
injuries.</LD>
<LD>   Richardson is still smarting from a bruised right knee and will
not play tonight against the Miami Heat.</LD>
<TE>   Point guard Andre Miller has been the glue that has kept the team
together during the early games. He has shown why General Manager
Elgin Baylor and Coach Alvin Gentry were so eager to acquire him
during the off-season from the Cleveland Cavaliers.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, the NBA's leader in assists with an average of 10.9 last
season, leads the Clippers in scoring (18.2 points) and assists
(9.3).</TE>
<TE>   Even better games will be ahead for Miller, Gentry predicted after
Miller scored a season-best 29 points and added seven assists and
five rebounds in 41 minutes in the Clippers' victory Sunday over the
Orlando Magic.</TE>
<TE>   "He's still figuring out our players," Gentry said of Miller, who
played during training camp with free agents who were filling in for
injured starters and are no longer on the roster. "He's still
learning where Michael wants the ball in the low post and where Elton
wants the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Said Miller: "We've got some great young talent here. We have a
chance to be very good. My job is to get guys in a position where
they can succeed. It's really pretty simple. But it's not all on me."</TE>
<TE>   No, but it certainly hasn't hurt the Clippers to have a player
with Miller's talents running the show.</TE>

because of a sprained right ankle.</TE>

<KH>DUCK REPORT</KH>
<HD>Friesen Happy to Be Out of Anaheim</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Comparing one of the biggest trades in Mighty Duck history will be
easy tonight, as the key players will be on display when the Ducks
play New Jersey at the Continental Airlines Arena.</LD>
<LD>   Last summer, the six-player deal brought right wing Petr Sykora to
the Ducks for left wing Jeff Friesen and defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky.
Both were unhappy in Anaheim and the Ducks seem better off without
them.</LD>
<LD>   Still, playing his former team is plenty of incentive for Friesen.</LD>
<TE>   "It was just totally different from San Jose," said Friesen, who
was acquired by the Ducks from San Jose in March 2001. "I think that
was just a big shock, the whole atmosphere there. In San Jose, if you
lost, it was just death. [In Anaheim], if you lost, you just put your
helmet in your stall and if you got mad, people would look at you and
say, 'Why are you mad?' "</TE>
<TE>   Friesen was a disappointment last season, as the Ducks were
expecting more offense from him. He had 17 goals, but scored 43
points, a career low for a full season. Tverdovsky, a skilled
offensive defenseman, had a career-low six goals and 32 points, and
was often at odds with then-coach Bryan Murray.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew that we were giving up two pretty good players that were
not totally happy here," said Murray, now the team's general manager.
"My first priority was to try and change the chemistry and attitude
of the hockey team, so we had to do some things. Petr seems to be
pretty happy here and he's a real positive guy."</TE>
<TE>   Sykora views this more as a homecoming. He played seven seasons
with the Devils and helped them win the Stanley Cup in 1999-2000.</TE>
<TE>   "It is really going to be a strange feeling," Sykora said. "I
don't know [if I'll get booed]. I know a lot fans and a lot people
there. It is going to be nice to come back and see them. I did some
good things when I was there, so I may not get booed. I hope I'm not
going to get booed."</TE>

<TE>   Update -- Duck right wing Mike Leclerc underwent minor surgery
Monday to repair a torn bursa sac in his right elbow. He will miss
tonight's game. Center Jason Krog was recalled from minor league
Cincinnati.</TE>

<LD>Mississippi starting tailback Robert Williams and backup receiver
Trey Fryfogle have been kicked off the team for violating unspecified
team rules, Coach David Cutcliffe said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Williams, a senior, was the Rebels' leading rusher with 307 yards
and four touchdowns despite sitting out five games because of
injuries.</LD>
<LD>   Fryfogle, a sophomore, had 13 receptions for 141 yards and one
touchdown.</LD>

<TE>   Freshman quarterback Reggie McNeal, who threw four touchdown
passes to rally Texas A&amp;M past then-No. 1 Oklahoma, 30-26, on
Saturday, has become the Aggies' starter, replacing Dustin Long.</TE>
<TE>   Coach R.C. Slocum said McNeal will start Saturday against
Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on his performance last week, I think he's earned it,"
Slocum said.</TE>
<TE>   McNeal is Slocum's third starting quarterback this season. Slocum
started with senior Mark Farris, shifted to Long after the third game
of the season and now will go with McNeal.</TE>

<LD>Three former fraternity brothers suspected of rigging a Breeders' Cup
bet worth more than $3 million plan to surrender to federal
authorities today and, according to one of their attorneys, expect to
be arraigned for wire fraud conspiracy.</LD>
<LD>   Chris Harn and Derrick Davis have been at the center of an
investigation into whether they conspired to place a pick six bet for
the Oct. 26 races at Arlington Park, then improperly entered a
computer tote system to insert winning horses after as many as four
of the six races were run.</LD>
<LD>   The third man, Glen DaSilva, placed similar bets earlier in the
month that investigators have characterized as potential dry runs.</LD>
<TE>   The case drew the attention of state police and the FBI. No one
had been charged as of Monday afternoon but James Comey, the U.S.
Attorney for the Southern District of New York, scheduled a news
conference for later today, an action that usually presages criminal
charges.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Conti, who represents Harn, said his client and the others
will turn themselves in at Comey's office in White Plains, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   "My client is very confident he'll be cleared of any wrongdoing,"
Conti said. Davis' attorney also has denied what he called "wild
accusations" leveled at his client.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and DaSilva placed their disputed bets through off-track
accounts in New York. Harn worked for the Delaware company whose
computers handled the wagers and has since been fired. The men, all
29, were members of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity at Drexel in the
1990s.</TE>

<TE>   A power outage led to cancellation of the eighth and final race on
a special Monday program at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   The race, six furlongs for 2-year-old maiden fillies entered for a
$32,000 claiming price, was scheduled to go at 4:07 p.m., but was
canceled after about a 35-minute delay. The outage originated
elsewhere in Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   The pick six thus became a pick five and paid $20,746, including
only what was bet Monday. The pick four became a pick three and paid
$386.40. The final pick three became a pick two and paid $60. The
late daily double paid to the winners of the seventh at $16.60 for
each $2 ticket. The place pick-nine went to those who picked seven of
eight races and paid $225.20.</TE>
<TE>   All wagers on the eighth race were refunded.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the pick-six pool ($110,620) that carried over from
Sunday will be carried over into Thursday, when racing resumes at
Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Before the outage, Fleetstreet Dancer won the $49,000 feature and
paid $17.40, $9.60 and $4.40.</TE>

<LD>Sean Phaler of Villa Park High became the second forward from the
Southland to commit to UCLA, joining Trevor Ariza of Westchester, who
committed three weeks ago.</LD>
<LD>   Phaler, 6 feet 9 and 170 pounds, averaged 19.8 points and 8.5
rebounds last season. He shot 42% from three-point range, making 107.</LD>
<LD>   Phaler also considered Washington and Indiana.</LD>
<TE>   -- Steve Henson</TE>
<TE>   Redondo swingman Wendell White has committed to Pepperdine, though
he must fulfill certain academic requirements before he would be
eligible to enroll, a source close to the situation said.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-5 senior averaged 14 points last season and made a
last-second three-point shot to lift Redondo over Riverside King in
the Southern Section Division II-A championship game.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine assistant Jim Nielsen coached White before leaving
Redondo after the 2000-01 school year.</TE>
<TE>   -- Ben Bolch</TE>
<TE>   Tennis standouts Elizabeth Exon of Irvine Woodbridge and Robyn
Baker of Palm Desert have committed to Michigan and Loyola Marymount,
respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Exon, a semifinalist in the Southern Section singles tournament
the last two seasons, chose Michigan over Cal, Virginia and Texas
A&amp;M. Baker, a singles quarterfinalist the last two years, opted for
Loyola, where her sister, Jennifer, plays, over San Diego State and
Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   -- Lauren Peterson</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Wilson wasn't at its best Monday in the Southern
Section Central Division girls' golf championships, but the Bruins
were good enough to shoot 420 and win the title by 10 strokes over
Cerritos at Seven Hills Golf Club in Hemet.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana, Kim Lorenzana and Kimberly
Punyasavatsut each shot five-over-par 77 for Wilson, which averaged
205 in nine-hole matches this season.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Angela Park had two birdies and shot a tournament-low 72
to pace Torrance, which finished third with 436. Murrieta Valley
finished fourth with a 447 and Palm Desert was fifth with 458. The
top five teams advance to the section finals Nov. 18 at Las Posas
Country Club in Camarillo.</TE>

<DH>Large influx brings big-time athletics to Murrieta Valley</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wally Clark remembers the dusty days 13 years ago when he arrived in
southeast Riverside County to become the first football coach at
Murrieta Valley High. "We hardly had any stop signs, the streets were
small and it was like being out in the country," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Not any longer.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday nights, the glow of the lights at the school's football
stadium acts like a beacon that summons thousands of residents --
city officials, parents, seniors and students -- from their
wellappointed homes in the foothills down to the flatlands, where
they pack the aluminum bleachers.</LD>
<TE>   Affordable housing and improved transportation have helped to
convert the barren stretch along Interstate 15, from Lake Elsinore to
the wine country of Temecula, into one of the fastest growing regions
in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   From an enclave of cattle ranches and rest stops, the area has
exploded to a population of about 100,000 in little more than a
decade. And with it, high schools such as Murrieta Valley have
quickly become sports powers.</TE>
<TE>   The Nighthawk football team is 8-0-1 and ranked No. 2 in the
Southern Section Division V poll. Four of the school's five other
fall sports are also ranked among the best teams in their
classifications.</TE>
<TE>   The reason is twofold: plenty of students to choose from and
plenty of support.</TE>
<TE>   At 4,000 students -- nearly twice the size it was built to support
-- Murrieta Valley is by far the largest school in the corridor. And
when football boosters circulated a letter seeking donations from
local businesses, they raised $12,000 without otherwise lifting
another finger. Another $5,000 was raised from a one-day golf
tournament that drew nearly 100 participants.</TE>
<TE>   But the rapid expansion has also come at a high price. Good
athletes who might be in the starting lineup for many schools don't
make the roster at all, and facilities are strained to the limit.</TE>
<TE>   "We hold tryouts and we cut 100 kids per team," said Dave Zirkle,
the school's athletic director. "We have all-stars who come to us
from youth leagues who can't make our teams."</TE>
<TE>   Competition is so fierce that the parents of Murrieta Valley
athletes are required to sign a letter acknowledging the long odds of
their children making one of the school's sports teams.</TE>
<TE>   "It warns them," Zirkle said, "that, unfortunately, because of the
number of players we have trying out, your all-star son or daughter
will probably not make our team. I have to be blunt with them."</TE>
<TE>   Help is on the way in the form of a second high school, Vista
Murrieta, which is nearing completion among a new tract of homes on
the east side of the valley. It is scheduled to open in August, but
it will be two years before it offers varsity competition.</TE>
<TE>   And, as earthmovers and dump trucks are beginning to dot the
grassy hillside to the west above Murrieta Valley High, experts say
at least two more high schools may be needed.</TE>
<TE>   The same holds true to the north in Lake Elsinore, where new homes
race up the hillside above rustic Wildomar. Temescal Canyon and
Elsinore highs already have a combined enrollment of more than 5,000.</TE>
<TE>   To the south, in Temecula, two high schools are on the drawing
board to help relieve crowding at Temecula Valley and Chaparral
highs, which combined have more than 6,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   John E. Husing, a former college professor and author of an annual
report that deals with growth, development and quality of life issues
in the Inland Empire, says that the genre of people moving into the
area have not been previously associated with past migrations in
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "They are technicians, programmers, young professionals and
executives -- all well educated," he said. "They can get a lot of
house for the buck. That has pushed an enormous amount of growth into
the region."</TE>
<TE>   School districts are the largest employers in the valley, but many
new arrivals have come from San Diego County, where they have family
ties or jobs, Husing said.</TE>
<TE>   Improved roads have made it easier to commute. It takes about 50
minutes to reach downtown San Diego on Interstate 15. Improved
east-west connectors just below the Riverside county line make it a
40-minute drive to Oceanside for a day at the beach. And there is
talk of building an expressway through the Cleveland National Forest
from southern Orange County that would connect with Interstate 15,
known in these parts as the Temecula Valley Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   The region has a lot of fans, including many young families. The
town of Murrieta, founded in 1873 by a Basque sheep rancher and
incorporated in 1991, still has a sleepy feel. Once an outpost on the
Butterfield Stage route, Temecula became a city in 1989 and is a bit
more upscale with its wineries and refurbished Old Town shopping
area.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a slower lifestyle here, more family oriented with good
education and safety," said Murrieta Valley athletic secretary Julie
Middleton, whose son, Tyler, is a water polo player for the
Nighthawks. "It's a nice place to raise a family."</TE>
<TE>   The challenge for school sports officials is that young
professional parents expect success in every facet of school life.</TE>
<TE>   Chaparral and Murrieta Valley rank among the top schools in
Riverside County in statewide testing, and the athletic teams are
supposed to rate just as high.</TE>
<TE>   "The parents here demand that the school is more than just a
baby-sitting service," said Errol Garnett, a dean at Murrieta Valley
and a former high school and college athlete who taught at Glendale
High before moving to the valley last year. "That isn't often the
case in the city."</TE>
<TE>   Those demands can be rough. Club sports programs are popular, and
growing as fast as the region.</TE>
<TE>   "We encourage kids to give it a shot, try out for our teams," said
Stan Ford, athletic director at Temecula Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's obviously very disappointing when you've played club
soccer for six or seven years and you finally get into high school
and you can't even make the [junior varsity] team."</TE>
<TE>   But the ones who do make it seem to enjoy it.</TE>
<TE>   Chad Hansen, a Murrieta Valley football player who recently moved
from San Jose, said that he has found a new life in the valley.</TE>
<TE>   "It's awesome here," he said. "There's lots of competition. Up
there, you just played for the fun of it. Here, you play to win and
to make something of yourself."</TE>

largest-enrollment schools. Three of the top five teams in the top 10
-- Long Beach Wilson, Los Alamitos and Anaheim Esperanza -- are in
Division I-AA. The second-largest division, I-A, also will be

<TE>   Anaheim Servite once again proved it's the next-best team in the
Southland by knocking off North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake, 17-9, on
Tuesday. The Friars then wrapped up their regular season Saturday
with an impressive 16-14 overtime victory over San Diego Section
powerhourse La Jolla The Bishop's. Newport Harbor spoiled Santa Ana
Foothill's season debut in the Sea View League, defeating the
Knights, 8-7, on Wednesday to capture its second consecutive league
title. Foothill held a 7-5 lead until Newport Harbor senior driver
Ross Sinclair scored on a four-meter shot with 4:12 left in the game
to ignite the Sailors' fourth-quarter rally. Chino Hills Ayala makes
its debut in the top 10 a week late. The Bulldogs upset previously
eighth-ranked Riverside Poly, 12-10, in a Sierra League game on Oct.

<LD>Humble, mellow, unselfish. Those are the everyday character traits of
Joe Cowan, a two-way starter for the surging Bellflower St. John
Bosco High football team.</LD>
<LD>   He's 6 feet 4 and 193 pounds, runs 40 yards in 4.4 seconds, has a
32-inch vertical leap, possesses excellent hands as a receiver and
makes hard hits as a free safety.</LD>
<LD>   "He's a great player," Coach Kiki Mendoza said.</LD>
<TE>   Everyone but Cowan knows how good he is. Well, maybe he knows but
doesn't want to flaunt it.</TE>
<TE>   He has three cousins ages 5, 7 and 8. They greet him after St.
John Bosco games as if he were a celebrity.</TE>
<TE>   But ask Cowan if he has given them an autograph and he responds,
"There's no point. I'm not famous."</TE>
<TE>   Yet.</TE>
<TE>   Before the high school season is completed, Cowan is going to be
well known among college recruiters, starting Thursday with his
team's Serra League title showdown against Santa Ana Mater Dei at
Santa Ana Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   St. John Bosco (7-2, 4-0), which owns a six-game winning streak,
has become a Division I challenger to Long Beach Poly (8-1) and Los
Alamitos (8-0-1). The Braves' offensive line is outstanding. They
have one of the state's top running backs in Derrick Williams. Their
defense has speed and size.</TE>
<TE>   Most of all, St. John Bosco has Cowan, who opponents sometimes
underestimate because they don't think someone his size can run so
fast.</TE>
<TE>   He was the fourth-place finisher in the state 300-meter
intermediate hurdles final in the spring. He has a 91-yard
interception return for a touchdown. He has caught 29 passes for 489
yards and six touchdowns. He has four interceptions and two fumble
recoveries.</TE>
<TE>   He thrives on pressure situations and is comfortable being asked
to make big plays.</TE>
<TE>   It's only afterward that he has one request: Let him be. "I don't
care for all the attention," he said. "I'm better with just a few
people than a lot."</TE>
<TE>   When a UCLA assistant offered him a scholarship two weeks ago,
Cowan barely reacted.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, thanks, coach," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That's the way Cowan is. He doesn't jump up and down to express
himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pretty mellow," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His younger brother, Patrick, a 6-5 backup quarterback at St. John
Bosco, is the more emotional Cowan. Their father, Tim, was a starting
quarterback at Washington in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   The boys live with their mother, Anita, and grandparents in Pico
Rivera. Their parents divorced when the boys were starting elementary
school. Anita was the one who served as their quarterback, throwing
them passes in the backyard.</TE>
<TE>   Joe was the hyper Cowan, never able to sit still. From sixth grade
until high school, he'd go off by himself and run around his
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't really training," he said. "It was just fun."</TE>
<TE>   He's so competitive that when the Braves have a conditioning drill
on Wednesdays, the players who end up on his team know what's coming.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to win this drill," he tells them.</TE>
<TE>   At home, with two teenagers, the phone rings often. But lots of
times, it's the young cousins calling to speak with Joe.</TE>
<TE>   "Aunt Anita, can Joe come over and play?" they ask.</TE>
<TE>   They already recognize what others are beginning to see: Joe Cowan
is a special person and a terrific player.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mark down the name of Jimmy Miller from Westlake Village Westlake.
He might be the best junior defensive end in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, 6-5 and 250 pounds, has 14 sacks, 12 pass breakups and
eight tackles for losses.</TE>
<TE>   The Warriors' other junior defensive end, 6-4, 215-pound Michael
Stuart, has 10 sacks.</TE>
<TE>   Westlake (7-2, 5-0) plays Moorpark (9-0, 5-0) for the Marmonte
League championship Friday at Moorpark.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There's no easy way to deal with the death of a parent. Chris
Badorek, a 6-4, 290-pound senior offensive tackle at Newport Harbor,
lost his father, Jack, last Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Jack had been battling lung cancer. He developed a blood clot in
his throat in the morning; an ambulance was called and later he died.</TE>
<TE>   Chris didn't go to school. He drove around "trying to run away
from it." His football coach, Jeff Brinkley, tried to console him.
Most of all, Chris turned to his friends, particularly A.J. Slater,
another offensive lineman. Chris helped A.J. get through the recent
death of his grandfather. Now A.J. was there for Chris.</TE>
<TE>   "He just encourages me and tells me he's there for me any time,
any hour of the night," Chris said.</TE>
<TE>   Chris decided to play for Newport Harbor on Thursday night against
Irvine Woodbridge.</TE>
<TE>   "I did it for my Dad, kind of dedicated the season to him," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   It was a difficult night.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he had a few more years," Chris said. "I kind of broke
down emotionally before the game."</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, he cried again. But with the help of family and
friends, he's making it through.</TE>

<HD>Laperriere's Style Leaving Its Mark</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>Ian Laperriere, a mouthy irritant to King opponents, was neither
disturbed nor surprised to find himself among the Sun newspapers'
so-called "Dirty Dozen," defined in Sunday's Toronto Sun as "chippy
and sometimes-underhanded ... players who will stoop to anything to
help their team win."</LD>
<LD>   "I wasn't looking forward to making the top-10 list," said
Laperriere, who came in at No. 5 in an informal poll of players,
coaches and broadcasters. "But if they say everybody hates me around
the league, it means I'm doing something right. If they all like me,
I don't do my job right. It's as simple as that."</LD>
<LD>   Among the Kings' most personable and likable players, Laperriere
said several teammates have told him they used to hate playing
against him. Last season, he led the Kings with 213 hits, 56 more
than runner-up Mattias Norstrom.</LD>
<TE>   "I think I'm a pretty decent person off the ice but I can't be
like that on the ice," he said. "I'm not going to cheat, but I'm
going to play physical and be an agitator out there. And if I have to
drop the gloves, I will."</TE>
<TE>   The last comment was a reference to the biting commentary about
him that accompanied the Dirty Dozen list:</TE>
<TE>   "Doesn't get a lot in the way of respect from his opponents
because nobody considers him to be brave. Is accused of being loose
with his stick and unwilling to drop the gloves when push comes to
shove.</TE>
<TE>   " 'He would never let himself get in a fight. He stays away from
the fighters and he will never, ever go toe to toe with a guy,' said
a broadcaster.' "</TE>
<TE>   That upset Laperriere, but he declined further comment.</TE>
<TE>   Topping the list was Bryan Marchment of the San Jose Sharks, whose
knee-on-knee collision last week with Mikko Eloranta of the Kings
only stoked his bad reputation. Eloranta could be sidelined six
weeks.</TE>

<HD>Shaq's Return Still Uncertain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It won't be tonight.</LD>
<LD>   It probably won't be Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe, it won't be Sunday, either.</LD>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal, nine weeks removed from surgery on the big right
toe that stilled a franchise, said Monday he could be as long as two
weeks away from returning to the Lakers, already off to their worst
start in 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   After the two practice days Laker officials had hoped would
convince O'Neal he was able to begin his season, O'Neal stood in a
downstairs hallway at the team's El Segundo practice facility and
made two convincing points:</TE>
<TE>   * The toe's not ready.</TE>
<TE>   * When it is, he'll arrive angry.</TE>
<TE>   "Once the black Patton returns, it'll be all over," he said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal continues to have pain on the underside of his toe, despite
new sneakers and orthotics. He is scheduled to meet today with Dr.
Robert Mohr, who performed the surgery Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he were having problems with pain, conditioning,
flexibility or mobility, he said, "A little bit of all of it."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed, but this is something I don't want to rush," he
added. "When I get in, I want to stay in.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, I'll be back in a couple weeks. When I do come back,
it will be vengeance. A lot of people are taking shots. I read that.
So, when I come back, I'll be motivated to play."</TE>
<TE>   By the sound of things, O'Neal practiced better last week than he
did through the Veterans Day weekend. By Monday, Coach Phil Jackson,
who had expected -- or hoped for -- a sound O'Neal by tonight's game
against Atlanta, was resigned to at least a few more games without
him.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if push came to shove and we were in the middle of a
playoff situation, then he could probably go out and play," Jackson
said while standing before a larger than usual media gathering. "But,
this isn't the time to do that, at this time of year. He could get
hurt. He could not be able to respond the right way on the floor. And
I don't think he could play longer than three minutes in any one
stretch at this point."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have practices scheduled for Thursday and Friday, but
Jackson noted, "I'm not optimistic."</TE>
<TE>   If O'Neal is back in two weeks, he'll have missed 14 games. It
appears he will sit out Sunday's game against the Houston Rockets,
delaying his first look at Yao Ming.</TE>
<TE>   "Who?" O'Neal asked, deadpan.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in three years, Derek Fisher did not start a
season wondering about his foot, about what kind of pain the next cut
would bring, about whether the repair of it would hold up through one
more quarter, or one more game, or forever.</TE>
<TE>   So, Fisher gets it.</TE>
<TE>   "There's some fear," he said. "It's never completely gone. That's
part of the fear. You may not experience pain anymore, but it takes a
while before you're connected to yourself again, and you may never be
100% yourself. He may not admit it, but he's a little afraid to go
back out there and let it go."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant (calf, ankle), Robert Horry (hand, foot, heel) and
Devean George (ankles) practiced to varying degrees. Horry ran
sprints at the end of practice while holding an ice bag to his right
-- shooting -- hand. Already sore, the hand was smacked again in
practice, and his right pinkie swelled again.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After playing in the shadows of superstar teammates and
personalities for three years, George apparently is finding the glare
of a huge contract and a starting job, even a temporary one, harsh.</TE>
<TE>   Unhappy either with the portrayal of his role in Friday's
last-second loss to the Washington Wizards or how his explanation was
conveyed to Bryant in the aftermath of it, George said Monday
afternoon he would no longer speak to the media.</TE>
<TE>   * TONIGHT</TE>

<TE>   Update -- After a 3-1 start, the Hawks have lost three consecutive
games, all on a West Coast trip through Phoenix, Utah and Sacramento.
Glenn Robinson, acquired from the Milwaukee Bucks for Toni Kukoc,
Leon Smith and a draft pick, has flattened out some after starting
his Hawk career with three 30-plus-point games.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trailing at halftime for the first time this season, the Dallas
Mavericks regrouped quickly.</LD>
<LD>   Fired up by pep talks from Avery Johnson and Michael Finley, the
Mavericks rallied to beat the Portland Trail Blazers, 82-73, Monday
night at Dallas to remain the league's only unbeaten team.</LD>
<LD>   Dirk Nowitzki had 26 points, a season-high 17 rebounds and six
steals, and Dallas improved to 7-0, extending the best start in
franchise history. The Mavericks turned a 13-point, second-quarter
deficit into a 12-point lead by the end of the third.</LD>
<TE>   "We showed a lot," said Finley, who had 21 points and eight
rebounds. "We don't have to score in the 100s to win. We can play
this style and win. We definitely took a huge step forward."</TE>
<TE>   Portland missed 13 consecutive shots over the second and third
quarters.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to be a blowout every night," Nowitzki said.
"These are the types of games when we have to stick together as a
team."</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 91, Minnesota 75 -- Tim Duncan scored 20 points and
Steve Kerr made five three-point baskets to lead the Spurs at San
Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs never trailed, sprinting to a 23-point lead in the
second quarter. The Timberwolves made a few charges in the second
half, but the Spurs kept their advantage in double digits.</TE>
<TE>   Kerr finished with 17 points in 23 minutes, and David Robinson had
13 points and 19 rebounds for his fifth double-double in seven games.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 112, Utah 95 -- Paul Pierce scored 35 points and the
Celtics used the three-point shot to overcome a halftime deficit at
Boston.</TE>
<TE>   The Jazz gave Boston plenty of help, committing 29 turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   It was the fifth consecutive victory for the Celtics after
starting the season with two losses. Utah lost for the fifth time in
six games and dropped its fourth in a row on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Boston made only one of 12 shots from three-point range and
trailed at halftime, 45-41. But the Celtics made five three-pointers
in the third quarter and four in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Pierce scored 27 points in the second half. Antoine Walker
finished with 27 points.</TE>
<TE>   Karl Malone scored 20 points for the Jazz, and Matt Harpring and
Scott Padgett each had 15.</TE>
<TE>   Golden State 108, Memphis 101 -- Antawn Jamison had 37 points and
11 rebounds to spark the Warriors at Memphis, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   Erick Dampier had 18 points and 16 rebounds for the Warriors, and
Troy Murphy had 18 points.</TE>
<TE>   Pau Gasol had 24 points for the Grizzlies (0-8).</TE>
<TE>   After struggling most of the game, particularly on defense,
Memphis began to put on some pressure late in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 100-84, with 3:08 to play, Lorenzen Wright made a short
jumper to begin a 10-point run. The Grizzlies cut it to 104-101 on
Jason Williams' layup with 21 seconds left.</TE>

<LD>Dallas Maverick reserve guard Nick Van Exel had arthroscopic knee
surgery Monday and is expected to be out three to six weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Van Exel had torn cartilage in his right knee. The knee had been
bothering him since training camp and he decided to have surgery now
rather than let it linger.</LD>
<LD>   Van Exel was averaging 9.5 points, 3.3 assists, 1.8 rebounds and
20.2 minutes through six games, all Dallas victories.</LD>
<TE>   Dallas replaced Van Exel by activating undrafted free-agent guard
Adam Harrington of Auburn. Harrington was on the injured list because
of tendinitis in his left knee.</TE>

<HD>Norman Will Rejoin PGA Tour Next Year</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Greg Norman will rejoin the PGA Tour next year, allowing him to play
in as many tournaments as he wants.</LD>
<LD>   Norman gave up his PGA Tour membership last year because he played
in only 11 events, one short of the minimum.</LD>
<LD>   The two-time British Open champion was allowed only five sponsors'
exemptions in 2002, along with whatever majors or World Golf
Championships for which he was eligible. He played 13 times and made
the cut in the four majors.</LD>
<TE>   Norman will not claim "home-circuit" status for the 2003 season.
Foreign-born players can use that to play their home tours without
having to get a release from the tour.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the tour will allow Norman to play a liberal amount of
overseas events without making him play at least 12 tour events to
retain his membership. Norman gives up his voting privileges under
the compromise.</TE>
<TE>   Norman, 47, has not said how often he plans to play next year. He
divides his time among tournaments and a number of businesses, such
as golf course design, real estate, apparel and wines.</TE>
<TE>   Norman is eligible to play the tour through a lifetime exemption,
which he earned by playing for at least 15 years and winning at least
20 times.</TE>

<TE>   With five returning starters, Arizona was No. 1 in the Associated
Press men's preseason poll for the third time in six years.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas -- all of the Big 12 Conference -- held
the next three spots in the poll, the third time one conference has
had that many teams in the preseason top five.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA, at No. 14, and Oregon, at No. 11, were the only other
Pacific 10 Conference teams in the top 25.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona received 50 first-places votes and 1,773 points from the
national media panel. The Wildcats were the preseason No. 1 for the
1997-98 and 2000-01 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas had 14 first-place and 1,715 points, and Oklahoma had six
first-place votes.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh, which received one first-place vote, was No. 5 in the
poll, with Duke, Florida, Alabama, Michigan State and Xavier
completing the top 10.</TE>
<TE>   No. 12 Mississippi State -- the only other team to receive a
first-place vote -- was followed by Maryland. No. 15 Connecticut was
followed by Georgia, Kentucky, Marquette, Missouri, Western Kentucky,
Indiana, Gonzaga, Cincinnati, Minnesota and Tulsa.</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen of last year's preseason top 25 weren't in the final poll
of the season, including No. 5 UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland men's Coach Gary Williams received a raise and contract
extension by one year to 2009. Financial terms were not disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Williams received a base salary of about $190,000 last season and
earned additional money from endorsements and appearances. He
received $100,000 for winning the NCAA championship.</TE>

first-round match Friday at Marquette. Pepperdine could not play host
to any regional matches because its home facility is not large enough
to meet NCAA standards.</TE>
<TE>   Pac-10 runner-up UCLA was seeded No. 7 and will play host to a
four-team regional Friday and Sunday. The Bruins (16-3-0) will play
Loyola Marymount (10-6-3) in the first round and USC (10-7-3) will

<HD>Faulk May Miss Game for Rams</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Running back Marshall Faulk probably will sit out St. Louis' next
game because of a right foot injury.</LD>
<LD>   Faulk left in the fourth quarter of the Rams' 28-24 victory over
San Diego Sunday after spraining his left ankle and straining a
tendon in the bottom of his right foot.</LD>
<LD>   After the game, Faulk was optimistic about playing in the Rams'
Monday night game against the Chicago Bears, but Coach Mike Martz
said that Faulk will be listed as questionable.</LD>
<TE>   "Will he be ready? Probably not," Martz said Monday. "We'll be
very pessimistic."</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers limited Faulk to 72 yards -- 36 rushing and 36
receiving. He ran for at least 150 yards in each of the three
previous games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Marc Bulger will get another start for the Rams, more
because of concerns for Kurt Warner's broken pinkie than the backup's
outstanding play. Martz said he'll stick with Bulger, but Warner will
be the backup for the Bears' game and will return as the starter the
next week.</TE>
<TE>   Martz said the decision was based on doctors' opinions that Warner
could possibly re-injure the finger.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miami receiver Cris Carter is improving, but he is in the hospital
and doctors are trying to determine what caused his kidneys to
malfunction.</TE>
<TE>   "He has made improvement," Coach Dave Wannstedt said. "He will be
fine. It's just a matter of how long."</TE>
<TE>   Carter, who turns 37 on Nov. 25, came out of retirement three
weeks ago and played one game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker Jeff Ulbrich signed a four-year, $5.1-million extension
with San Francisco.... Indianapolis receiver Qadry Ismail has a
sprained knee ligament and could sit out Sunday's game against
Dallas.... Chicago defensive back Reggie Austin has a torn knee
ligament and is out for the season.... Seattle linebacker Isaiah
Kacyvenski will be out four to six weeks because of an ankle
sprain.... Cincinnati defensive lineman Oliver Gibson is expected to
be out for the season after having surgery on a torn Achilles'
tendon.... Minnesota receiver Cedric James is out two to four weeks
because of a sprained ankle.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Diego running back LaDainian Tomlinson says it was a poor
choice of words.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Heart' maybe was a little bit of too strong of a statement,"
Tomlinson said Monday. "I would prefer to say 'Pride.' "</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, after the Chargers fell to the Rams, 28-24, Tomlinson
questioned his teammates' heart.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we don't have the kind of heart a lot of people think
we have," said Tomlinson, the league's leading rusher with 965 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Charger safety Rodney Harrison said it wasn't a serious issue for
the club, but he wasn't amused by the comment.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a team. We win and lose as a team and you can't have
that," Harrison said.</TE>
<TE>   Tomlinson said he regretted using the word "heart," but he would
not mince words.</TE>

<HD>Ducks Finally Realizing Potential</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Matt Cullen paused in mid-sentence for a quick calculation.</LD>
<LD>   "I've been here ... this is my sixth year, and this is the fifth
head coach we've had," the Mighty Duck center said. "Obviously,
there's a transition. It's a matter of getting used to the coach and
getting used to the guys you're playing with. But I think we're
starting to turn the switch on and understand what we can do.</LD>
<LD>   "I think we're starting to expect to win and we don't accept the
fact of losing. It comes with being a better team."</LD>
<TE>   The Ducks hit .500 (6-6-3-0) Sunday with a 1-0 victory over
West-leading Minnesota, extending their winning streak to three and
surge to 4-1-1. It's modest, but it includes victories at Boston and
Colorado and at home against the Wild. Besides, the last time the
Ducks were at .500 last season was at 1-1, and the season went
steadily downhill from there.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, they've changed coaches, from Bryan Murray to Mike
Babcock, and general managers, from Pierre Gauthier to Murray. Their
roster has been overhauled, as Murray jettisoned a dozen players who
were mostly dead weight. For stability "and to show the guys here we
care about the present" he acquired veterans Adam Oates, Petr Sykora
and Fredrik Olausson. Looking ahead, he accelerated the progress of
youngsters Stanislav Chistov and Kurt Sauer, who have exceeded his
hopes.</TE>
<TE>   "We're quicker and we've got three lines with the potential to
score goals," Murray said. "Last year, we were very, very limited to
Paul [Kariya] and maybe a supporting cast of Mike Leclerc and Matt
Cullen, and that was it. The team is structured now to be more
competitive on the road, but still, every game sits in the balance
until the last minute. That's the kind of club we are right now.
We've improved our speed and skill but, like a lot of teams in this
league, we don't score very easily."</TE>
<TE>   Earning a playoff berth will be tough, but the Ducks are giving
themselves chances to win with tenacity, speed, and solid
goaltending. They're within easy reach of the top eight as they start
a five-game trip today at New Jersey. And remember, it was around
this time last year that the Ducks, then 6-9-3, left for a six-game
trip and came home a dispirited 1-5, collapsing after Keith Carney
and Steve Rucchin got hurt and falling out of playoff contention by
Thanksgiving.</TE>
<TE>   That won't happen again, Kariya said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a much better team this year," he said. "If you look at the
talent level, it's night and day. We're playing better hockey and
doing all the little things right.... It took us a little while to
get going, but we've got it going pretty good. We just have to keep
working."</TE>
<TE>   Said goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere, "Now we realize we're a good
team, and we can compete against any team in this league."</TE>
<TE>   After this trip, the Ducks will have played 13 of their first 20
games on the road, and must then build a home-ice mystique.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time you go on the road, you think it would be nice to come
home .500," he said. "That's the dream. For me, right now, just play
hard, play well, be prepared, and pay a price. And if we do that,
we'll win some of the games on the road."</TE>
<TE>   No Blues for the Blues</TE>
<TE>   Injuries that should have decimated the St. Louis Blues instead
seem to have made them stronger.</TE>
<TE>   Despite losing top goalie Brent Johnson to a sprained ankle before
training camp, backup Reinhard Divis to a groin strain, defenseman
Chris Pronger to a second round of wrist surgery and forward Keith
Tkachuk to a fractured foot Oct. 30, the Blues lost only two of their
first 13 games. At one point, they won four in a row with different
goalies -- Divis, minor league recalls Curtis Sanford and Cory
Rudkowski and veteran Fred Brathwaite -- and won nine in a row
overall.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a credit to our system and the attitude in this room," said
center Doug Weight, who has a 10-game point-scoring streak. "Two of
the best players in the world [Pronger and Tkachuk] are out of the
lineup but we're resilient and we believe in ourselves and our
system. We're working harder each game, and that's a great sign."</TE>
<TE>   They've gotten a lift from forwards Eric Boguniecki (eight goals
and 14 points in 12 games) and Petr Cajanek (two goals, 11 points in
13 games), who add much-needed speed. Signing free-agent winger
Martin Rucinsky Oct. 30 was a shrewd move too, because he brings
skills and smarts.</TE>
<TE>   Another key is the development of 21-year-old defenseman Barret
Jackman. He's rarely out of position and reads plays well, meaning he
can play crucial minutes and ease the burden on Al MacInnis and
Pronger.</TE>
<TE>   "The kid is poised, real solid," Coach Joel Quenneville said. "He
looks like he's been around a lot longer than [15] games."</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Larry Pleau deserves credit for doing more than
filling holes.</TE>
<TE>   "During training camp, our young kids had a chance to play a lot
of games, and as it turned out, that's helped us out," said Pleau,
who last week signed veteran goalie Tom Barrasso as insurance. "Guys
have really pulled together. The goalie thing was the first thing
that helped pull us together. The thing I like is, we've played well
as a team, and that's something we didn't do last year."</TE>
<TE>   Said Boguniecki, "It doesn't get any better than this. When you're
winning, it's fun. We know what it feels like, and we don't want to
feel anything else."</TE>
<TE>   The First 1,000 Are the Toughest</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia Flyer center Jeremy Roenick is nearing two
milestones: He's scheduled Saturday to play in his 1,000th NHL game,
and he's seven assists from 600.</TE>
<TE>   But to the 32-year-old center, that's trivia.</TE>
<TE>   "The milestone that I need is the Stanley Cup," said Roenick, who
came close in 1990-91, when he and the Chicago Blackhawks lost the
finals to the Pittsburgh Penguins. "The goals and the games and the
assists, they're all wonderful and all, but I think everybody is
going to judge me now on that championship, rather than how many
goals and how many assists I have."</TE>
<TE>   Roenick might get a shot with the Flyers. Roenick said Coach Ken
Hitchcock, who gained a reputation in Dallas for favoring defense,
has installed a 1-2-2 forecheck and insists on a high tempo, which
promotes scoring.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think his system is much different than a lot of other
systems, but Hitch just takes things to the bitter, bitter ultimate
detail of everything and everywhere," Roenick said. "He'll even tell
you which way your skates should be pointed in neutral ice when
checking somebody. It's a lot to have to absorb, so you have to
always be mentally aware of what's going on around you."</TE>
<TE>   Here and There</TE>
<TE>   The Colorado Avalanche remains a puzzle. All that talent should
produce more than an 0-4-3-1 home record, a league-worst 9.8%
power-play success at home and a near-worst 11.4% power play overall.
General Manager Pierre Lacroix hasn't hesitated to shake things up
via trades, but it's tough to deal from weakness. Think he regrets
trading Chris Drury now?</TE>
<TE>   After starting strong and then losing three straight, the Tampa
Bay Lightning earned respect by refusing to fade away. "We feel like
we kind of gave those games away a little bit, not so much by what
the other team did, but what we did in the last three minutes,"
winger Martin St. Louis said. "There's no panic here. Everybody in
the locker room feels very strong that we have what we need to get
back on track."</TE>
<TE>   Carolina goalie Arturs Irbe is unhappy about sitting while Kevin
Weekes gets most of the playing time. But the Hurricanes won't deal
Irbe until they're sure Weekes can be consistent.... The Florida
Panthers reportedly are willing to move Viktor Kozlov and Dmitry
Yuskevitch. They like New York Islander forward Brad Isbister, but so
do a lot of other teams.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta Coach Curt Fraser has dodged the ax for a few weeks, but
he might lose his job before the end of the six-game home stand the
Thrashers began Monday. Fraser's main fault is, he can't get Ilya
Kovalchuk to improve defensively. Talent like Kovalchuk's is rare;
coaches aren't. Former Duck and Washington coach Ron Wilson is
rumored to be among the potential replacements.</TE>
<TE>   Maple Leaf Coach-General Manager Pat Quinn told Toronto reporters
last weekend he's ready to shake things up with a trade. "The trigger
hasn't been set, but believe me, if I could do something that would
make sense, I would do it," he said.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dave Andreychuk reached another milestone.</LD>
<LD>   Andreychuk scored the 249th power-play goal of his career to tie
Phil Esposito's NHL record, and the Tampa Bay Lightning defeated the
Phoenix Coyotes, 4-2, Monday night at Tampa, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   "Just to be mentioned with [Esposito] is special for me,"
Andreychuk said.</LD>
<TE>   Andreychuk redirected a pass from Brad Richards 17 seconds into
the second period to give the Lightning a 4-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, I couldn't do it by myself," Andreychuk said. "It was
a great pass. It was one of those plays where it was simple for me.
I've had a few of those over my career on the power play."</TE>
<TE>   The Tampa Bay captain needs two goals to become the 14th player to
reach 600.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to do it at home in front of the fans," Andreychuk said.</TE>
<TE>   Esposito, the former Lightning general manager, is a radio
announcer for the team.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think it's great for David," Esposito said. "I think it's
terrific. Things like that don't bother me. When I retired, I was
third in the league in scoring all-time. If I can live long enough, I
might be 100th. I hope so."</TE>
<TE>   Boston 6, Edmonton 1 -- Brian Rolston scored two goals at Boston,
and the Bruins won for the fourth time in five games.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton lost for the third time in four games and has given up 18
goals in its last four games.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins are 9-1-2-1 in their last 13 games.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 2, Florida 2 -- Jay Bouwmeester scored his first NHL goal
midway through the third period to give Florida a tie at Sunrise,
Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Jan Hurme made 32 saves for the Panthers, who ended a six-game
losing streak against Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Jocelyn Thibault stopped 30 shots for the Blackhawks, including
two in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 2, Calgary 1 -- Pasi Nurminen stopped 31 shots at Atlanta
and the Thrashers extended the Flames' franchise-record scoring
drought.</TE>
<TE>   Nurminen's bid for his first career shutout ended when Chris Clark
scored with 4:48 left.</TE>
<TE>   The Flames had gone 192 minutes 42 seconds without a goal over
four games, which topped their 171:01 span last season.</TE>
<TE>   New York Rangers 5, San Jose 4 -- Rem Murray had two goals and an
assist at San Jose, and the Rangers won for the third time in four
games.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Blackburn made 33 saves in his third consecutive start for the
Rangers, who were outshot, 17-5, in the third period but managed to
hang on.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ranger forward Krzysztof Oliwa was suspended for five games and
Coach Bryan Trottier for two by the league for their roles in a fight
at the end of a game against Columbus.</TE>
<TE>   The league also fined Ranger forward Sandy McCarthy $1,000, and

<HD>Conner's Hopes Are Raised</HD>
<DH>He feels confident going into America's Cup challenger
semifinals now that his faster boat, which sank 31/2 months ago, is
back in action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rich Roberts</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dennis Conner, who has won and lost the America's Cup more than
anybody else, will make another kind of history in the sport's
premier event today.</LD>
<LD>   When the quarterfinals of the Louis Vuitton Cup challenger trials
start at Auckland, New Zealand, his crew will be sailing the only
boat in the 151-year history of the event to sink and sail again.</LD>
<LD>   Skipper-helmsman Ken Read said Monday that they were parking Stars
&amp; Stripes USA 66, which won only six of 16 races in the early going.
Instead, they will meet Britain's GBR with USA 77, which sank in 55
feet of water off Long Beach on July 23 when the rudder came off and
the sea gushed in through the fractured housing.</LD>
<TE>   With a flair for drama, Read announced, "Team Dennis Conner will
be sailing back-from-the-depths USA-77."</TE>
<TE>   Conner lives in San Diego but is representing the New York Yacht
Club.</TE>
<TE>   The quarterfinals had been scheduled to start Monday -- Tuesday in
New Zealand -- but the fleet remained in port with forecasts of winds
well over the 19-knot limit for starting races. Forecasts for today
were an ideal breeze of 15 knots.</TE>
<TE>   A salvage team was able to recover USA 77 within seven hours,
through fortuitous timing. Just before sinking, the boat had sailed
in close to shore from the much deeper San Pedro Channel to take on
Conner and a group of sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   "Well," Conner told them later, "it's not every day you get to see
an America's Cup boat sink."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, it has happened only one other time: at San Diego in 1995
when the hull of John Bertrand's oneAustralia, with Rod Davis as
helmsman, cracked open. . That boat sank in two minutes flat and
remains on the bottom off Point Loma.</TE>
<TE>   America's Cup competitors are allowed to build two boats. In a
way, Team Dennis Conner, as well as rival Prada, have built three.
Working near the limit of the rules, both replaced entire bow
sections forward of the mast -- Team DC by necessity, the Italians by
choice -- and the new bows are updated designs.</TE>
<TE>   Team DC spokesman Keith Taylor said, "The new bow was a
modification of the original, to reflect the improvements they had
decided on after testing in Long Beach prior to the accident."</TE>
<TE>   The eight remaining challengers -- only Italy's Mascalzone Latino
has been eliminated -- had the option of switching boats before the
quarterfinals but only two did. Seattle's OneWorld, which slipped
from 8-0 in the first round to 5-3 in the second, will race USA 65
instead of USA 67.</TE>
<TE>   USA 77 was shipped to Auckland a few days after it sank. Because
the damage to the bow was extensive, the team chose to replace the
whole section. It was finished by the original builder, New England
Boatworks in Portsmouth, R.I., and shipped to New Zealand to be mated
with the rest of the hull. The crew has sailed it on 20 days since it
was launched in early October.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless ... how do they feel about sailing the boat that sank
from under them 3 1/2 months ago?</TE>
<TE>   "The boat builders have done a spectacular job," Read said. "You
take the engineering data and you take the information the boat
builders present to you. They say it's fine, but then you have to go
out and sail the boat and prove it to yourself.</TE>
<TE>   "We really wanted to use USA 77 in the second round-robin but we
hadn't quite proved to ourselves that the boat was as solid as we
needed it to be, in order to push it as hard as possible. Since then
we've done some more testing and it has been blowing plenty hard.
We've had it out in some good breezes with no creaks or groans.</TE>
<TE>   "In fact, it's a quieter boat at this point than USA 66, so we
have no worries from a strength standpoint."</TE>
<TE>   But the largest factor in the decision to switch was obvious: The
team thinks USA 77 is faster than USA 66, which seemed off the pace
with most of its competitors last month.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what we have always considered to be our race boat," Read
said. "Our mishap in California set our program back a bit, but we've
worked really hard. We're very comfortable with it now, and
comfortable that it does have a performance edge over USA 66.</TE>
<TE>   "Therefore it became an easy decision."</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC)</TE>
<TE>   America's Cup</TE>
<TE>   The challengers are now matched up in four best-of-seven series,
separated into upper and lower brackets, according to their won-lost
records in the round robins:</TE>
<TE>   UPPER BRACKET</TE>
<TE>   * Alinghi (13-3) vs. Prada (11-5).</TE>
<TE>   * Oracle (12-4) vs. OneWorld (13-3*).</TE>
<TE>   *One point deducted as penalty.</TE>
<TE>   LOWER BRACKET</TE>
<TE>   * Victory (7-9) vs. Le Defi (2-14).</TE>
<TE>   * GBR (7-9) vs. Team Dennis Conner (6-10).</TE>
<TE>   Upper bracket winners advance directly into the semifinals. The
losers will face off against the lower bracket winners to select the
other two semifinalists. Lower bracket losers are eliminated.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Some people think I live in a fantasy world because I write about
Salma Hayek and Mimi Rogers, but then I've been hugged and kissed by
both.</LD>
<LD>   I saw myself having a nice chat with the President of the United
States one day, some people scoffed, and a week later I was shaking
hands with Martin Sheen.</LD>
<LD>   Let me tell you, I even pictured myself sitting in the Shav Glick
Media Center at some point in my life, which had family and friends
laughing, knowing there's no way I'd ever find good reason to visit
the Pomona Raceway.</LD>
<TE>   It never dawned on them, however, how far I'd drive to avoid
covering another day of tennis in Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   They also didn't take into consideration the rain and the fact the
dragsters would remain shut down Saturday, making it the perfect
peaceful day at Pomona Raceway to sit and reminisce with Glick about
his days serving on General Ulysses S. Grant's staff before becoming
The Times' longtime auto racing writer.</TE>
<TE>   "MacArthur," Glick said. "I served on Gen. MacArthur's staff."</TE>
<TE>   That's right, I forgot, he was just a youngster when the Civil War
broke out.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I DON'T know how many icons you've met in your lifetime, but Glick
is one of them in the auto racing industry, the nicest man in the
sportswriting business, and sitting in a press box named after
himself.</TE>
<TE>   Now, when I arrived at the track to visit the Glick Media Center,
officials wouldn't let me in. This happens to me a lot, of course,
but I figured if I dropped Glick's name on them, everything would be
all right.</TE>
<TE>   Well, you'd have thought I dropped Sports Editor Bill Dwyre's name
on them with the dumb looks they gave me. If they name a press box
after Dwyre, it's gonna be in some tennis stadium, so I'll never be
in it.</TE>
<TE>   "They wouldn't let me in here a day earlier," said Glick, who has
won just about every auto racing writing award ever presented. "I
told them, 'That door over there has my name on it,' but it didn't
make any difference."</TE>
<TE>   I can understand not letting the hacker play on a nice golf
course, but if you're not going to let Mr. Auto Racing set up his
computer, you might as well let the air out of the tires.</TE>
<TE>   We're talking living legend here, a guy who sat next to
sportswriting great Grantland Rice and who covered every basketball,
football, baseball and track event Jackie Robinson competed in at
Pasadena Junior College before taking Robinson on as golf partner
years later. (I can only imagine how grueling that must have been for
a great athlete like Robinson to watch Glick swing a golf club.)</TE>
<TE>   Glick has been a constant in this area since beginning work at the
Mirror in 1954 -- making him currently the longest-running editorial
employee at The Times. He has lived in the same Pasadena home for
more than 50 years, was married for 41 years before his wife,
Florence, died in 1991, and can't wait to write the next story.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no plans on retiring," said Glick, who takes no vitamins,
never has, and who will be 83 on his next birthday. "My mother lived
to be 101 and my father began building a house after he turned 80."</TE>
<TE>   Glick, who covered golf for The Times and also wrote under the
byline "Shavenau Glick" until the early '70s, said, "I'm just happy
to be alive and being able to work. And now I'm looking forward to
the 2005 Indy 500."</TE>
<TE>   He has covered every Indy 500 since 1969 if you overlook the one
he missed after being stabbed in the stomach in an Indianapolis bar
in 1983 while trying to help a friend. "I haven't been back to that
bar," said Glick with that familiar smirk.</TE>
<TE>   And so it went on a wonderful rainy day, the racing shut down
because of the conditions, no tennis to muck things up, and a great
chance to listen to Shav Glick talk about the good old Model-T days
in the Shav Glick Media Center.</TE>
<TE>   A dream come true, which means I won't have to go back there
again.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I HATE big crowds, so I went back to the tennis tournament Monday
expecting to find Venus Williams playing hopscotch under the stands.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know much about tennis, as the e-mailers like to point
out, but when one of the Williams sisters announces she's hurt (sore
calf muscle) after falling behind, 5-0, history inspires healthy
skepticism. The WTA Tour provided an injury report that said Venus
was really hurt. The WTA Tour's CEO also said "the level of intensity
here was great."</TE>
<TE>   The Williams sisters are so dominant they can beat everyone else
hopping on one leg, and yet they both fell to someone named Kim
Clijsters, Serena losing the final match -- obviously distracted and
worried about her sister's sore calf.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE DRAG racing at Pomona Raceway Sunday drew more than 45,000
fans. Six days of tennis in Staples barely drew that many.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   RADIO PERSONALITY Jim Rome</TE>
<TE>   was on his game Monday morning: "Barry Bonds should have won seven
MVPs; [of course] that's more friends than he has."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DEVEAN GEORGE has played 226 minutes for the Lakers this season
and has eight assists. I hear now he's not talking to the media, and
while that's a loss that ranks right up there with Chad Kreuter
taking a vow of silence, I presume it's because they didn't credit
him with a ninth assist in allowing Jerry Stackhouse to score the
other night and give Washington a buzzer win.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Eric Perlmutter:</TE>
<TE>   "Everything that comes from your computer is absolute junk."</TE>
<TE>   I don't get any credit for consistency?</TE>

<HD>El Salvador Reveals Roster for U.S. Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>El Salvador named an 18-player roster Monday for Sunday's game
against the United States at RFK Stadium in Washington.</LD>
<LD>   The Salvadoran team, which did not qualify for the 2002 World Cup,
has not played since the 2002 Gold Cup in January, at which time it
was beaten, 4-0, by the U.S. in a game in which Brian McBride scored
a hat trick.</LD>
<LD>   The full roster:</LD>
<TE>   Goalkeepers: Juan Gomez and Fidel Mondragon.</TE>
<TE>   Defenders: Ramiro Carballo, Julio Castro, Marvin Gonzalez, Carlos
Menjivar, Jr., Alfredo Pacheco, Mauricio Quintanilla, William Torres
and Victor Manuel Velasquez.</TE>
<TE>   Midfielders: Selvin Gonzalez, Gilberto Murgas and Roberto Vasquez.</TE>
<TE>   Forwards: Rudis Corrales, Francisco Fuentes, Jose Galdamez, Diego
Mejia and Jose Mejia.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. holds an 8-1-4 all-time record against El Salvador.
Sunday's match will be the Americans' final game of the year, during
which they have won the Gold Cup, reached the quarterfinals of the
World Cup, risen to an all-time high of No. 8 in the FIFA world
rankings and compiled an 11-6-2 record.</TE>
<TE>   Sampson Signs</TE>
<TE>   Former U.S. World Cup coach Steve Sampson, who last month agreed
to become Costa Rica's coach and technical director of all its
national teams, signed a four-year, $1.4-million contract in San
Jose, Costa Rica.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very proud to be here and I understand the great
responsibility that I will have in Costa Rica," said Sampson, who
will take charge on Dec. 1 after moving to San Jose from Agoura. "We
will start working immediately."</TE>
<TE>   Sampson replaced Bora Milutinovic as the U.S. coach in 1995 and
resigned after the 1998 World Cup, where the Americans went 0-3 and
finished last. His record with the U.S. was 26-22-14.</TE>
<TE>   Guatemala Surprise</TE>
<TE>   Joaquin Alvarez, a 6-foot central defender from Jersey City, N.J.,
who plays for the New York/New Jersey MetroStars' reserve team,
MetroStars Black, in the New Jersey Champions League, was called up
by the Guatemala under-21 national team for the Central American and
Caribbean Games in San Salvador, El Salvador. Alvarez was born in
Guatemala City.</TE>
<TE>   Heading Verdict</TE>
<TE>   A coroner in England ruled that Jeff Astle, former West Bromwich
Albion and England national team forward, died earlier this year of a
brain disorder aggravated by repeatedly heading a heavy leather
soccer ball during his playing career in the 1960s, before the
introduction of lighter balls made of water-repellent synthetic
material.</TE>
<TE>   Heading played "a significant role" in Astle's death at 59 in
January, coroner Andrew Haigh told Reuters.</TE>
<TE>   "The head trauma which Mr. Astle suffered during his professional
career made at least a significant contribution to the degenerative
brain condition which ultimately caused his death," Haigh said.</TE>
<TE>   "What actually caused his death was a build up of protein in the
vessels in the brain, so the heading of a football would certainly
have played a significant role."</TE>
<TE>   Astle scored 137 goals in 292 matches for West Brom and also
played five times for England, including the memorable 1-0 loss to
Brazil in the 1970 World Cup in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq Gets a Coach</TE>
<TE>   Choosing what might be viewed as a peculiar time for such a career
move, German-born coach Bernd Stange ended five weeks of negotiations
and signed a four-year deal in Baghdad to be Iraq's Olympic and
national team coach, with the intention of qualifying for the Athens
2004 Games and the 2006 World Cup in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Stange, 54, who was criticized in his own country for even
considering the post, consulted with FIFA and with the German foreign
ministry before accepting the job. The contract gives him the option
of leaving in the event of war.</TE>
<TE>   Armenian Double</TE>
<TE>   Pyunik Yerevan, which earlier this year won the Armenian Cup,
clinched the Armenian league title with a lopsided victory in its
next-to-last game of the season to give Argentine Coach Oscar Lopez
the double in his first season in charge.</TE>

<HD>Toledo, Players Take It Easy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Assistant coaches made recruiting calls the last two days, but little
else about the Bruin routine has been normal since the victory over
Arizona on Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   Cornerback Ricky Manning treated his teammates to paint ball
Sunday, using money he earned last summer playing baseball in the
Minnesota Twin minor league system.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Coach Bob Toledo slept in before busting open some
popcorn and watching a little USC game film.</LD>
<TE>   Monday was another day off for the players, and coaches studied
film of high school players they are recruiting. Oh, and studied more
USC film. The Bruins don't play the Trojans until Nov. 23, but it's
never too early to begin preparing.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo did take time out to participate in a conference call with
reporters and expressed admiration for his quarterbacks, USC's talent
and the Bruin schedule:</TE>
<TE>   * Toledo acknowledged what is obvious to anyone who watched UCLA
victories the last three weeks -- freshman quarterbacks Drew Olson
and Matt Moore are even.</TE>
<TE>   "They are both getting playing time and are both playing well," he
said. "There's not a big difference between the two, in our opinion."</TE>
<TE>   Olson will make his third consecutive start at quarterback against
USC and Moore is expected to play. Toledo might split their playing
time quarter by quarter as he did against Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   * The Trojans will get no bulletin-board material from Toledo, who
stopped just short of comparing them to the 1972 Miami Dolphins. And
the UCLA coach will not put any references to USC on the bulletin
board in the Bruin locker room until next week.</TE>
<TE>   "They are the best USC team I've seen since I've been here, and
might be the best team we've played since I've been a coach here," he
said. "I can see why they're ranked as high as they are."</TE>
<TE>   * UCLA has two byes in the next three weeks, this one before
playing No. 8 USC and another Nov. 30 before playing No. 3 Washington
State. Both games are at the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what's fun and exciting about this thing. We get a week
off and then we can give it our best shot," Toledo said. "Then we get
another week off and get another big shot. The schedule couldn't have
worked out any better. It was a tough haul playing 10 games in a row,
but we'll play two teams in the top 10 with a week off before each
game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UP NEXT</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 23 vs. USC</TE>

<LD>Wide receiver Mike Williams wore a boot and offensive lineman Lenny
Vandermade wore a look of uncertainty Monday as eighth-ranked USC
began preparations for their Pacific 10 Conference game against
Arizona State.</LD>
<LD>   Williams' left ankle was encased in protective plastic because of
pain that caused him to limp off the field after the Trojans' 49-17
victory over Stanford. The win helped USC move up two spots in the
Associated Press poll on Sunday, but the Trojans remained ninth in
the bowl championship series standings.</LD>
<LD>   Williams, who became the Pac-10 record-holder for receptions in a
season by a freshman, said he aggravated an ankle sprain suffered
earlier in the season but would definitely play against Arizona
State.</LD>
<TE>   Confident the injury was not serious, Williams said he skipped an
appointment for X-rays Monday morning to register for classes.</TE>
<TE>   He will be examined by a team doctor today.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably the same exact injury," said Williams, who has 58
receptions for 913 yards and 10 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Vandermade, the starting left guard, also will be examined for a
right biceps injury. He said he was hurt on a running play against
Stanford when he, "caught a helmet," in his arm.</TE>
<TE>   Vandermade finished the second-half series but was replaced by
junior Eric Torres, who would start if Vandermade can't play
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tailback Sultan McCullough said he was not discouraged after
getting seven carries as Justin Fargas' back-up.</TE>
<TE>   After all, that was five more than he received Oct. 26 against
Oregon, two weeks after rushing for 176 yards in 39 carries against
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   McCullough gained 14 yards and scored the Trojans' final touchdown
on a six-yard run against the Cardinal.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal is still to try and get 1,000 yards," said McCullough,
who leads the team with 596 yards. "But if we win, that's all that
matters."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wide receiver Kareem Kelly could wind up with the NCAA record for
consecutive games with a reception but still be tied with Oregon's
Keenan Howry for the Pac-10 record. That's because the NCAA does not
count bowl games played before this season but the Pac-10 does.</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA record of 46 consecutive games with a catch was set by
Carl Winston of New Mexico in 1990-93.</TE>
<TE>   Howry has receptions in a Pac-10 record 45 consecutive games,
including three bowl games. But in the NCAA's eyes he is at 42 with
two regular-season games and a bowl game left.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly has catches in 44 consecutive games including one bowl game.
The NCAA credits him at 43 with three regular-season games and a bowl
game left.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cornerback William Buchanon did not practice because of a neck
strain.... USC officials said there are fewer than 3,000 tickets left
for the Trojans' Nov. 23 against UCLA at the Rose Bowl. The game will
begin at 12:30 p.m. and will be televised regionally by ABC.... Only
a few end-zone seats are available for the Trojans' Nov. 30 game
against Notre Dame at the Coliseum. The game is expected to sell out
by today.</TE>
