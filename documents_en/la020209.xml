<HD>Turn Away From Selfish Behavior: Use Your Signal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. ALLSWANG</AU>
<BD>John M. Allswang is an emeritus professor of history at
Cal State Los Angeles. E-mail: jallswa @calstatela.edu.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is a turn signal syndrome in California that raises questions
about our culture: By a conservative estimates, 20% to 25% of
California drivers have stopped using their turn signals. This
behavior is dangerous. At stop lights when the car ahead does not
signal a turn, one assumes it is going straight and therefore will
move when the light changes. But the nonsignaling driver does not
move, waiting to turn, and a rear-end accident is not unlikely.</LD>
<LD>   Beyond the direct physical danger, there is the related
frustration and anger. One stays in the left lane on a busy street,
expecting to proceed when the light changes, but then finds that the
car ahead does not budge because its nonsignaling driver plans to
turn. The driver behind gets frustrated, maybe angry.</LD>
<LD>   More significant than the danger or frustration this behavior
promotes is the attitude behind it. Why have so many drivers stopped
using this painless, easy procedure, which requires only one second
and one finger, and cancels itself automatically after the turn?</LD>
<TE>   The answer resides in a declining sense of community and mutuality
among a large number of Americans. People have stopped using turn
signals because they really don't care about other people; they don't
find others worthy of even so simple an act as signaling a turn. And
it is this attitude that changes a somewhat dangerous and selfish
driving behavior into a much more significant phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   This is reified by related driving behaviors that have also become
more common in recent years. Time and again, drivers who find
themselves in the wrong lane deal with the problem by refusing to
take any responsibility--or consequences--for their actions. They
simply sit there, holding up sometimes long lines of traffic, until
they can go in the direction they originally intended. The idea of
following the signals and going a block or two out of one's way
doesn't occur; taking responsibility for one's actions seems
pointless just to avoid discommoding other people.</TE>
<TE>   These behaviors are by no means confined to driving. But we see
them there because we are all on the road so much, because driving in
California can be difficult and frustrating, and because the impact
on others can be so broad and direct.</TE>
<TE>   But the failure to signal turns, such a simple little thing, is
symptomatic of one of the more unpleasant, selfish and antisocial
trends in California life. It ought to be taken seriously.</TE>

<HD>Campus Liberals Get Taste of Their Own Medicine</HD>

espouse.</DH>

<LD>At a local university banquet last year, a Democratic elected
official pledged to a rapt and enthusiastic audience that he would do
everything in his power to return affirmative action to California
colleges. Race preferences are banned under the voter-approved
Proposition 209, but there was no hint that the overwhelmingly passed
proposition had any support in such circles. Such is the narrow,
nondiversified view on college campuses.</LD>
<LD>   Would any college administrator dare oppose affirmative action?
Ask Harvard President Lawrence Summers, who recently came under
attack on this issue.</LD>
<LD>   In the wake of Sept. 11, universities are worried about freedom of
speech. Seriously. They think the 1st Amendment is swirling down a
funnel, lost to the twin dragons of conservatism and patriotism.</LD>
<TE>   A concerned university administrator at Cal State Northridge
recently distributed an article from Nation magazine about the plight
of a professor who disparaged U.S. military action in Afghanistan and
then faced criticism and vilification by his college for doing so.
University administrators are shocked by such reactions because they
now suffer under the sort of political activism they always
encouraged by the left. The left now faces censorship in the mirror.</TE>
<TE>   Campus speech codes and moral platitudes against hate speech are
dissolving while swallowing those who championed them. An environment
in which bashing the U.S. and attacking its ideals were sacred rites
of academia was transformed into a new concern about self-censoring
academicians afraid to criticize U.S. foreign policy. Campus
activists' views on political and social issues, once considered
normal on campus, are exposed as outside the mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   Living and working in political segregation from the world at
large, campus administrators and activists adapted the distorted view
that no other meaningful view exists except a religious fervor to
stamp out disapproval of liberal social and political ideas. They've
adapted as moral absolutes the belief that to think outside their
narrow box is tantamount to a kind of insanity.</TE>
<TE>   After all, this is the environment where, as at the University of
Washington, a proclamation condemning terrorism was voted down as
offensive to Arabs. Campuses are accustomed to protesting students
demanding special privileges for designated victims' groups and
shouting anti-Western epithets as administrators hide and debate how
to placate them.</TE>
<TE>   The post-Sept. 11 intimidation doesn't differ from the kind that
arises from the left, except in its less violent approach. But since
Sept. 11, campus speech codes and responses to victims groups'
hypersensitivity have knocked out more speech from the right than the
left.</TE>
<TE>   An Arab political science student at San Diego State University
was threatened with disciplinary action for arguing on behalf of U.S.
military action. American flag displays, moments of silence and
prayer, and campus e-mail and Web sites have been attacked and
censored. Orange Coast Community College suspended professor Kenneth
Hearlson over his anti-terrorist statements. He was reinstated only
after an outcry from free speech organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Conservative speakers and programs forced off campus, repression
of Christian groups and massive theft of campus newspapers with
conservative advertisements or editorial content surround the usual
idiocy of banning Christmas carols, marching down the halls, yelling
to have demands met and evicting ROTCs (but not military defense of
their lives and campus property). This all occurs under the approving
eyes of administrators and has been routine up to now.</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 11 attacks revealed the repression and chaos at
universities, which espouse free speech but are the most anti-free
speech places in the country. It's unfortunate it took liberal
activists' own victimization for anyone to notice.</TE>

<HD>Integrating Disabled Students</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The integration of disabled students into regular classrooms is not
really new in the LAUSD (Jan. 31). Richland Avenue School became one
of a handful of "adapted" schools in the early 1980s. Barriers were
removed, ramps were installed, bathrooms were adapted to meet the
needs of the physically disabled, and we began to enroll disabled
students. Our experience has been that the integration of disabled
and nondisabled students benefits everyone. The atmosphere of the
school is tolerant and compassionate. The self-esteem and academic
performance of physically disabled students in the general education
setting rise dramatically. Their nondisabled peers develop a level of
caring and understanding that is remarkable.</LD>
<LD>   It is complex to make such a program successful. A full-time nurse
and dozens of special education assistants had to be hired to
facilitate the inclusion of our disabled students. But the value has
been incalculable. Students once segregated into special schools,
centers and classrooms are now full participants in the daily life
and activities of the school. Some are student government officers.
Others excel in academics and have been identified as gifted. All
participate in promotion activities upon completion of fifth grade,
ready to move on to adapted secondary schools.</LD>
<TE>   I have been privileged to be both a teacher and special education
administrator. I can state unequivocally that it can work, and it
does work (every day).</TE>

<TE>   I am in my first full year of teaching kindergarten at a "full
inclusion" school in the Pasadena Unified School District. Last year
I taught a second-grade class in Monrovia. Last year was difficult
and challenging, but I fell in love with teaching and, after 20 years
as a network broadcast engineer, enrolled to get my credential. I
chose to enter teaching because, having grown up with a dyslexic
brother, I realized what a tremendous difference literacy makes in
the quality of a person's life.</TE>
<TE>   This year, I just want to get down on my knees and beg the
forgiveness of my regular education parents. There is no way that the
system can throw four special education kids with severe behavioral
and emotional difficulties into a classroom and, with minimal
support, expect that the regular ed kids will get even half the
education they are entitled to.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of my day is not spent thinking about creative lesson
plans or how to get my low achievers up to speed. It is spent
worrying about my special ed kids injuring their classmates and being
concerned when I observe my younger students acquiring the behavior
patterns of the autistic child sitting next to them. I am severely
limited in the amount of time that I can devote to my regular ed
kids.</TE>

<TE>   As a secondary school elective teacher for the past 12 years I
don't understand what all the ruckus is about. During this time I've
worked for the Burbank, Glendale and now William S. Hart school
districts. It has been my experience in each district, as it is now
at Saugus High, that all of my classes are totally integrated with
students who have different abilities.</TE>
<TE>   I've had the privilege of working with deaf students at the middle
school level, limited English speakers everywhere, all the at-risk
students (where else do "poor learners" go but shop class), resource
students, gifted students and, not to be left out, the average Joes
and Josephines who, like the rest, need the practical art requirement
to graduate. Only twice did I ever have an aide. Mostly the students
pitch in and help each other--their friends (and me)--by translating,
signing or just working with their fellow students. Currently it is
my pleasure and joy to work with a couple of high-school-age,
developmentally challenged young men, one of whom might just turn out
to be a fine printer/pressman.</TE>

<LD>Re " 'We Behaved as Badly as Anybody,' " Feb. 2: It was interesting
to read that during the so-called witch hunts in Hollywood of the
'50s, many believed communists posed a real threat to the movie
industry. Testimony from the era released last year by the National
Archives indicates that communists had indeed infiltrated trade
unions, inserted pro-communist messages into scripts and taught
actors and directors how to portray pro-communist attitudes in their
scenes. The evidence seems to be well established.</LD>
<LD>   "Uncle Joe" Stalin stated, "Give me Hollywood and I will have the
world!" Another left-wing icon, V.I. Lenin, said, "Film is the most
sophisticated of all the arts. It must and shall become the foremost
tool of the proletarian revolution." What's to argue?</LD>

<TE>   If the Communist Party wished to infiltrate an industry and
targeted Hollywood, it could not have made a greater miscalculation,
since its influence would have been open to public scrutiny before
virtually the entire population of this country. This sorry chapter
in our country's history represents the triumph of emotion over
reason, and represents a threat as current as today's headlines.</TE>

<TE>   Your engaging account of the Hollywood blacklist had one large
omission. The "rest of the story" is how the blacklist was
irretrievably broken by an actor-producer named Kirk Douglas. In
1958, Douglas finished shooting his now-classic story, "Spartacus."
But he was faced with a dilemma: Whose name to put on the screen as
the writer? The actual writer was Dalton Trumbo. But Trumbo was on
the blacklist. And whosoever dared put a blacklisted name on a film
would face the fiery wrath of the movie establishment.</TE>
<TE>   But finally Douglas said: "Dalton Trumbo wrote this film and his
name goes on the screen." This unanticipated act of audacity was
greeted unwholesomely by many moguls. But by this action, Douglas
broke the blacklist, forever. Some years ago, the Directors Guild of
America honored him in a moving ceremony celebrating his courage.</TE>
<TE>   After the film premiered, Douglas received a note from Trumbo, the
paper still stained by his tears. The letter said: "Dear Kirk, thank
you for giving me back my name."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>We shouldn't be surprised at the abysmal education figures ("L.A.
Workers Held Back by Low Education Rate," Feb. 5) because the
government's immigration policies have created an underclass by
design. "Family reunification" immigration sounds admirable; however,
the real meaning is that no standards of employability are applied to
legal immigrants using that provision, even basic literacy. About
one-third of current legal immigrants have not graduated from high
school--300,000 per year. That number doesn't count those among
illegal aliens, who total more than 8.7 million nationwide.</LD>
<LD>   California's economic success relies on high-tech jobs requiring a
well-educated work force. However, the state already has too many
unskilled workers, as shown by elevated unemployment in low-skilled
jobs. It's doubtful that California's economy can survive the costs
of supporting such a massive welfare state of imported poverty. For
example, the UC regents just voted to provide in-state tuition to
illegal alien students--a taxpayer subsidy of $11,000 per student per
year, even though the state must borrow billions of dollars to pay
its bills.</LD>
<LD>   Skilled, successful people vote with their feet, as they leave the
state looking for a place where their tax dollars are spent more
wisely.</LD>

<TE>   I am a teacher at an LAUSD "immigrant magnet school" and work with
the children of recent immigrants. This article only solidified my
belief that we are creating a continuing cycle of potential high
school dropouts with our educational policies. I see eighth-graders
who have trouble alphabetizing eight words in English. What can I say
to the students other than "this is real important for you to learn"?</TE>
<TE>   Are these students going to graduate from high school? Probably
not. Will they end up like their parents in a low-skilled job?
Probably so. Why don't we put more emphasis on the basic skills or,
heaven forbid, trade schools to teach these students a trade that
they can make a living with? It works in Europe; why not here?</TE>

<TE>   "Crowded Living in California's Open Spaces" (Feb. 4) is yet
another article about poverty and crowded living conditions for farm
workers--as their advocates demand more governmental assistance. And
once again, in what has become the politically correct euphemism,
these people are described as "first-generation immigrants." I ask
you, how many of these people are here legally? When did it become
politically incorrect to refer to an illegal alien as just
that--illegal?</TE>
<TE>   You state that "census figures show that crowding in rural areas
continued to rise in the last decade, even as the government
increased border surveillance." Is anyone confused as to the reasons
for this? Well-meaning citizens actually provide aid to illegal
aliens as they sneak across the border on their way to health and
dental benefits, jobs and subsidized education. Is there any wonder
why parts of California are being described as having Third World
conditions?</TE>
<TE>   What's next? Tax-subsidized housing in gated communities? When
will we stop encouraging people who scoff at our laws? When will
voters look beyond the convenience of having a cheap farm labor
source and imagine a future when all Californians live in Third World
conditions and our environment resembles the tragedy which is
Mexico's?</TE>

<TE>   The emergence of shantytowns throughout California, populated by
impoverished immigrants living in Third World conditions, surely
calls for reexamination of America's immigration policies.
Corporations push for mass immigration of unskilled and impoverished
workers because paying low wages to them leads to increased corporate
profits.</TE>
<TE>   Other results of such immigration policies, such as rising poverty
rates and overcrowding, merit consideration as well in the
immigration debate.</TE>

<TE>   Your article describes the wretched living conditions of Latino
immigrants in rural California. Several families are described as
living together in one small shack because none can afford to pay the
rent alone.</TE>
<TE>   One sentence stands out: ''She remembers the time when even a farm
worker's salary was enough to pay the rent.''</TE>
<TE>   The federal government doesn't seem to understand the most basic
rule of all. Wages are governed by the law of supply and demand. High
immigration and frequent amnesties create a surplus of workers, so
wages drop. This may be good for agribusiness, but it creates a huge,
starving underclass. Why don't legislators connect the dots?</TE>

<LD>"Dark Night of the Soul"</LD>
<LD>   St. John of the Cross</LD>
<LD>   Translated from the Spanish</LD>
<TE>   by Mirabai Starr</TE>
<TE>   Riverhead Books, 184 pg., $22.95</TE>
<TE>   As the last rites were read to him on his deathbed at the age of
49, John of the Cross, the 16th century poet, mystic, priest and
monk, interrupted. Please, he begged, read me "The Song of Solomon."</TE>
<TE>   That such a sensual, luscious poem to love would be the last words
John wished to hear is a bittersweet commentary on his life. He was a
member of Teresa of Avila's Discalced Carmelite Order--the Barefoot
Carmelites--and Teresa's beloved, passionate friend. His finest and
most famous poem, "Songs of the Soul," combines the best of each of
his vocations. He and Teresa were committed to the reform of the
Carmelites, and both of them were caught in the chaos of the
Inquisition in Spain.</TE>
<TE>   At 25, John was captured and imprisoned in a closet in a monastery
by a community of monks who upheld a Vatican faction's dim view of
Teresa's reforms. He was starved and flogged. After nine months of
captivity, he escaped by lowering himself out of his cell with a rope
made of strips of cloth. He got himself to a Discalced convent and
wept as he heard the nuns reciting the Angelus. He wrote "Songs of
the Soul" in a state of gratitude and ecstasy.</TE>
<TE>   The poem is a mere eight verses long. It describes a night in
which a soul escapes from her house to join her lover, her creator,
in a night of risk, ecstasy and passion. As with the Song of Songs
and many mystics' writings, it is not only beautiful, it is
remarkably sensual. Consider the seventh verse:</TE>
<TE>   Wind blew down from the tower</TE>
<TE>   Parting the locks of his hair</TE>
<TE>   With his gentle hand</TE>
<TE>   He wounded my neck</TE>
<TE>   And all my senses were suspended.</TE>
<TE>   John's Discalced brethren prevailed on him to write a "commentary"
on his poem, and this resulted in what we now know as the "Dark Night
of the Soul." The commentary is 25 chapters long, divided into two
parts, "Night of Sense" and "Night of the Spirit," an exegesis of the
first three verses of the poem (nothing remains, if it ever existed,
of the commentary on the last five).</TE>
<TE>   In these pages, John describes how and why the soul must risk
entering darkness, become empty and abandoned, to be ready for union,
real union, with God. It's partly a step-by-step guide to
contemplation and has served as solace for those who suffer from a
dry or despairing season in meditation or prayer. It's wise and often
witty about spiritual seekers: our love of trinkets and icons, how
attached we get to juicy spiritual experiences, how competitive we
are about our lives of prayer.</TE>
<TE>   For the last 400 years, "Dark Night of the Soul" has been taken
very seriously by contemplatives. Writes Thomas Moore in his
introduction, "As I see it, St. John of the Cross is speaking of
mysterious developments in the soul, which includes the
psychological.... His goal is not health, but union with the divine."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, however, the commentary flattens and devitalizes
the poem. While the poem celebrates sensuality, the commentary argues
against it. It attacks the urgency, the moment of the poem. The poem
and the commentary are like a war between the imaginary and the
literal, the mystical and the dogmatic.</TE>
<TE>   Poems are mysterious. So is mystical experience. We don't know
where their inspiration comes from. To write a serious poem or to
enter into prayer is to enter into darkness. Because they come from a
place "outside the writer," poems, even those written 400 years ago,
have the capacity to speak to us, in the now. And mystics, including
Julian of Norwich and the 13th century Sufi poet Rumi are presently
speaking to large numbers of us.</TE>
<TE>   Most mystics, from Mechthildof Magdeburg to John of the Cross,
experience God as a creative, sensual, intimate lover. This version
of God makes people, especially those in authority, very nervous:
Many mystics, most of them women, who insisted on this God, so
different from the remote Father in Heaven, were banned, imprisoned
and even killed.</TE>
<TE>   St. Hildegard of Bingen, another early Christian mystic, said in
one of her revelations that our sin is not that we are sensuous but
that we are not sensuous enough: We do not allow the beauty of the
world and the flesh to fully enchant us. It is the poem, not the
commentary, that brings us close to John's actual experience of God.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the poem and the commentary are linked forever. As a friend, a
former Ursulan nun who studied John of the Cross at Notre Dame, said,
"the commentary is like a provenance" to the poem, a place of origin,
the place where a thing is made.</TE>
<TE>   John's commentary anchors the metaphysics of his poem in the
struggle that led to its creation. It shows us the place where the
poem was made, and this, finally, is what gives this work its
greatness.</TE>
<TE>   This new translation by Mirabai Starr, a fiction writer and
adjunct professor of philosophy, religious studies and Spanish at the
University of New Mexico at Taos, is the first translation of John
from someone "outside the church," as the publisher puts it, meaning
the first translation by someone who is not Roman Catholic.</TE>
<TE>   Her translation is somewhat like Coleman Barks' reading of Rumi:
more plain speaking, less ornate and designed to appeal to a secular,
or at least nonreligious, audience.</TE>
<TE>   Starr's own spiritual "seeking'' has led her from Hinduism to
Buddhism to Native American sweat lodges. "But eventually the juices
drained out of my spiritual practices and the fireworks faded. By the
time I reached my thirties, nothing remained but a quiet connection
to emptiness." "Dark Night of the Soul" is Starr's silent companion.</TE>

the translation of St. John of the Cross' 25-chapter rumination on
his own hauntingly sensual "Songs of the Soul,'' subsequently hailed
as a "union with the divine."</CP>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In a bid to thwart a lawsuit that "threatens to shut down an entire
religion," the Hare Krishna movement said this week that it will file
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection later this month.</LD>
<LD>   The International Society for Krishna Consciousness announcement
comes in response to the recent filing of a $400-million child abuse
lawsuit in a Texas state court.</LD>
<LD>   Plaintiffs aim to hold a range of Krishna institutions liable for
sexual, emotional and physical abuse allegedly suffered in Krishna
boarding schools during the 1970s and 1980s.</LD>
<TE>   A federal court dismissed a similar suit in September on the
grounds that the invoked Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act did not apply.</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiff attorney Wendell Turley recently filed the new suit
seeking equal compensation, but this time under state law.</TE>

<LD>At the St. Camillus Catholic Center for Pastoral Care near County-USC
Medical Center, nine chaplains minister to patients and families.</LD>
<LD>   At St. Malachy's Church in South-Central Los Angeles, five nuns
offer religious education and help lead groups of parents and
couples. At the parish school, tuition is kept well below its actual
$2,000 cost.</LD>
<LD>   These services are the result of a 9-year-old program in the
Catholic Church's Los Angeles Archdiocese, in which funds from richer
parishes help keep poorer ones afloat.</LD>
<TE>   Together in Mission, which collects money from all the
archdiocese's 290 parishes, plans to distribute nearly $13 million in
subsidies this year to 33 parishes and 44 Catholic elementary
schools. The money will pay for construction and maintenance
projects, teacher salaries and tuition subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   "People have really realized they're responsible for other
parishes," said Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, who started the program as
archbishop of Los Angeles in 1993. "People can identify with the
parishes. All you have to do is help connect people with broader
needs."</TE>
<TE>   Without the program's assistance in poor parishes, "it would be
impossible to run any kind of school with teachers that are
qualified," said Sister Joan Faraone, assistant superintendent of
administration for the archdiocese's schools.</TE>
<TE>   Many dioceses across the country have similar programs, said Tod
Tamberg, archdiocese spokesman. In Orange County, for example,
Catholics in 59 parishes and chapels last year donated more than $8.8
million to aid specific churches, more than doubling their diocese's
goal of $3.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles donation program asks each parish to make
contributions equal to a tenth of the money its members contributed
in offerings during the previous year. This means 2002 goals range
anywhere from $894 (the small Immaculate Conception in New Cuyama in
Santa Barbara County) to almost $178,000 (St. Monica's in Santa
Monica). Almost all the parishes--278 of 290 in 2001--meet or exceed
their goals, church officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "Our people, although they are poor, they are very generous," said
Father Antonio Ruiz, pastor of St. Vincent's Church in South-Central
Los Angeles, where members pledged nearly $32,000 last year, about
44% more than the parish goal of $22,197. "Outside of their poverty
they have a little to share."</TE>
<TE>   Since St. Vincent's parish school is funded through the program,
"the people feel they can give.... It is to their advantage, because
the money comes back to us," Ruiz said. "When you tell them it's
helping their own school, it hits the target. They open their pockets
with greater generosity."</TE>
<TE>   Debra Duncan, 47, is not a member of Ruiz's church but happened to
be attending on the Sunday the donation drive began in late January.
"It seems more real that you can help people here in your community,"
she said. "They need it."</TE>
<TE>   Diana Barnes, 41, of Glendale, sends her sons, Adam and Travis, to
St. Bede the Venerable Elementary School in La Canada Flintridge.
Tuition is higher there--$3,000 a year--and the affluence of the
parish means subsidies are not needed. "It's expected to share with
the community," Barnes said.</TE>
<TE>   Churches are rewarded for their generosity. After a parish meets
its pledge goal, half of any other donations are returned to the
parish. More than $905,000 was returned to parishes last year.</TE>
<TE>   Between 85% and 99% of the students in the 44 subsidized schools
are poor enough to be eligible for free or reduced-price federal
lunch programs, which cover private and church schools as well as
public ones.</TE>
<TE>   At San Miguel School in Watts, a $20,000 subsidy pays for
utilities and teacher salaries, said Principal Jesus Vazquez. Still,
some essentials, such as Internet access, are impossible. The school
has no library and no air conditioning.</TE>
<TE>   St. Malachy's School uses its $140,000 subsidy for operating costs
and teacher salaries. With the subsidy, the school can keep tuition
at $1,350 a year for a family's first child and $500 for each
additional one.</TE>
<TE>   St. Malachy's Church receives another $30,000 from Together in
Mission that it uses to pay some of the $1,000-a-month salaries of
five sisters from the Missionaries of Jesus Crucified in Guadalajara,
said Father William Bonner, pastor. The sisters help with pastoral
work by leading religious groups and training leaders, as well as
organizing the choir.</TE>
<TE>   St. Odilia's Church in South-Central also uses its subsidy for
adult education and catechism classes.</TE>
<TE>   "Our collection just isn't enough to cover our expenses," said
Father Dan Sylvain, associate pastor. "Our population is continually
growing. It's always a challenge to keep growing and tend to the
needs of our parish."</TE>
<TE>   Together in Mission also provides 90% of the funding for the St.
Camillus Center for Pastoral Care, including the chapel, offices and
stipends of the nine chaplains at County-USC Medical Center and two
other USC-run hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a conscious decision by the cardinal to put professional
chaplains in the hospitals which serve the poor," said Father Chris
Ponnet, pastor at St. Camillus.</TE>
<TE>   Each chaplain sees 40 or 50 patients a day, and they are usually
more seriously ill and stay longer than patients in other hospitals,
he said.</TE>

<HD>Wrapping Christian Messages in Films With Popular Appeal</HD>
<DH>Evangelism: 'The Climb' embodies 50-year-old group's newest
tactics for reaching many people.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TED PARKS</AU>
<BD>RELIGION NEWS SERVICE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Story is king in this business," the producer proclaimed, speaking
in a quiet spot away from the noisy guests who passed by the bar at
the packed premiere and then quickly moved on.</LD>
<LD>   But some things about this movie gala were different. Like juice
and soda at the bar, and not a drop of anything harder. Or the eyes
closed in prayer after the credits finished rolling.</LD>
<LD>   A combination of Hollywood convention and evangelical Christian
piety, the recent event at the Academy of Television Arts and
Sciences in North Hollywood marked the West Coast debut of "The
Climb," the latest film by World Wide Pictures, movie arm of the
Minneapolis-based Billy Graham Evangelistic Assn.</LD>
<TE>   The new film caps 50 years of filmmaking by WWP, fruit of Graham's
visionary longing in the early 1950s to use every medium possible to
carry the Christian message to the nation's audiences.</TE>
<TE>   According to WWP managing director Barry Werner, Graham's
organization saw early on that large segments of the American public
were unreachable by conventional evangelistic methods.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way they're going to get everybody to walk into a
crusade venue," Werner said. So the idea was born to film the
crusades so that people everywhere could hear Graham's powerful
preaching.</TE>
<TE>   Since its 1952 inception, WWP has produced more than 125 films.
Strategies for distributing its movies have changed as the film
industry has evolved.</TE>
<TE>   At first showing its movies primarily in churches, WWP ventured
into theaters with its 1965 film "The Restless Ones." While "The
Hiding Place" gained wide recognition in the mid-'70s, the industry's
increasing reliance on multiple-screen movie houses in the '80s made
it harder for WWP films to compete. So the studio concentrated on
churches, television syndication and home video until the late '90s.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, WWP began a journey back to the big screen, coupling
theatrical releases in targeted cities with expanded showings of its
films on television.</TE>
<TE>   Scheduled for theaters in four cities before airing in national TV
markets in June, "The Climb" embodies WWP's most recent marketing and
movie-making trends.</TE>
<TE>   Shot for $2.5 million on a whirlwind 18-day schedule in the
Wasatch Mountains of Utah in April 2001, "The Climb" tells the story
of two men thrust together in a once-in-a-lifetime adventure to scale
a killer peak in the Chilean Andes.</TE>
<TE>   In the movie, the two climbers are brought together initially by a
harrowing mountain rescue in which they save the son of big-time
Denver developer Mack Leonard, played by Dabney Coleman, the star
power in the film.</TE>
<TE>   Grateful for the rescue, businessman Leonard offers to bankroll
the men's fantasy climb.</TE>
<TE>   People who know Hollywood point to the challenge WWP faces in its
attempt to package a distinctive Christian message in a film with
popular appeal. "To me that seems a tough formula for success
commercially or spiritually," said film and television producer Ralph
Winter. "Maybe God is using what they do for a specific purpose, and
I won't criticize that."</TE>
<TE>   But the Rev. Scott Young, director of a yearly Los Angeles film
festival that brings together critics, industry professionals and
theologians to discuss issues of faith in classic cinema, believes
WWP has carved a niche. He says the blend of evangelism and
entertainment has its place: "There is a role for intentional
religious filmmaking, in this case, Christian."</TE>

<HD>Doggedly Promoting Dialogue With Animals</HD>
<DH>Penelope Smith tells her eager students that communicating
with other species is 'a primal way of being.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>POINT REYES STATION, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The first mistake came when the student tried to share her lunch with
a fly. It prompted a classroom scolding that made every student
squirm.</LD>
<LD>   It's perfectly fine to communicate with a fly. Or a spider, or a
dog or cow or any other living creature. That was the assigned
homework, after all.</LD>
<LD>   But don't feed the fly!</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not saying you did something wrong," said Penelope Smith,
softening her tone. "It's just that people want to do something with
animals. If you get quiet with animals, as opposed to putting out
energies, that's when you begin communicating with them."</TE>
<TE>   Smith should know. She's been communing with animals all her life,
or so her books, Web site and newsletters all say. And since 1971,
this child of the '60s with a graying mullet haircut, who lives here
in Marin County with cats and dogs and chickens and llamas, has made
a living as an interspecies communication specialist.</TE>
<TE>   So close your eyes. Put your feet on the floor. Sit up straight
and open your heart-center to receive the pulsing frequencies of life
bounding around the room in Smith's Interspecies Communication
Training program.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a primal way of being," she tells the class. "It's beyond
thinking; it's feeling. Just open yourself, and the animals will
teach you, and it will blow your minds."</TE>
<TE>   Do this right and you'll be able to beam messages back and forth
with the dog sitting beside you, or, for that matter, the cow in the
meadow outside the window or the whale swimming out beyond the
headlands.</TE>
<TE>   Telepathic conversations with animals aren't an entirely new
concept to most of the 40 women and four men in the class.</TE>
<TE>   Some come with prior experience--not watching the silly "Dr.
Doolittle" movies or kitschy TV pet psychics, mind you--but flashes
of insight into the minds of animal companions.</TE>
<TE>   Each student is devoting a weekend and $125 to this basic class on
how to communicate with animals. One woman flew in from Switzerland.
Others came from the East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   For those students who want more than the basics, Smith sells
books and tapes, offers advanced classes and leads excursions titled
"Swim With Wild Dolphins" and "Float With Humpback Whales."</TE>
<TE>   To this class, many students have brought along an "animal
friend." Don't call them "pets." That's demeaning.</TE>
<TE>   Bringing all of them together in an old church on this rainy
weekend has filled the air with the unmistakable smell of wet dog.</TE>
<TE>   "How many people have an animal friend who stares at them?" Smith
asks.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly every hand is raised.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Smith promises, you will learn what the animal is thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated by years of one-way communication, the students lap it
up.</TE>
<TE>   To tune up their telepathic antennae, human students begin by
practicing on each other. The class pairs off, knee to knee, and
prepares to transmit images to one other.</TE>
<TE>   Let's start simple, Smith says. Eyes closed. One person thinks of
a color. The other receives.</TE>
<TE>   "Our socialization has told us we cannot do this," Smith says. "I
ask you to suspend your disbelief in yourself. We are blessed with
this great mind that is the source of our creativity. It is also a
source of confusion. This is a process of letting your mind get out
of the way."</TE>
<TE>   An afternoon of such exercises is followed by homework.
Communicate with an animal and report back to class the next morning.
If no animal is available, a picture will do, presumably to help with
a long-distance connection.</TE>
<TE>   In that spirit, one woman recounts what happened during her
homework assignment.</TE>
<TE>   "My whole body felt so warm," she says. "I was looking at my
animal's pictures, and his eyes were open and then closed."</TE>
<TE>   Another student tells of a conversation with her cat about their
plane ride to California. The student quizzed the cat about how to
ease the feline's fear of flying on the trip home.</TE>
<TE>   Did she want another kitty knockout pill? A half dose? Or simply
the calming presence of flower essence in her water dish?</TE>
<TE>   "I just want the flower essence and nothing else," she reported
her cat as communicating.</TE>
<TE>   Smith closes her eyes and holds up her palms, as if to still the
class. During the silence, she demonstrates her ability to
telecommunicate long-distance with the cat.</TE>
<TE>   "Your cat confirms all that," Smith says, opening her eyes.</TE>
<TE>   The class bursts into applause.</TE>
<TE>   Not every student has an interspecies breakthrough.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked Lily why she pees on me in bed," says one woman, cuddling
her curly-haired terrier, who is nestled in her arms and wearing a
sweater. An answer never came.</TE>
<TE>   "It helps to start with easier questions," Smith says. "How are
you doing? What's going on?"</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just tired of getting peed on," the woman says.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand," Smith says. "You are going to have to do more work
on it. You'll get it."</TE>
<TE>   Smith explains that such communication often comes in a burst of
images--not words--that unfurl like a fast-paced video clip.</TE>
<TE>   "Just download it," she says. "Interpretation comes later."</TE>
<TE>   The class is now ready for a live, group interview.</TE>
<TE>   KC, the keeshond, is the first canine Smith invites on stage,
along with his companion, Cathy Malkin.</TE>
<TE>   After much eye closing and mind opening, students describe the
fluffy dog's daily routine.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting that he's jumping up and down," one woman submits
tentatively. "I see a red ball, green grass, and he has a stainless
steel bowl."</TE>
<TE>   Malkin nods enthusiastically. "He loves to jump. We have a green
grass lawn. Yes, he does have a stainless steel bowl, and he gets
terribly excited when I fix his food."</TE>
<TE>   The class applauds.</TE>
<TE>   Smith waves the class to silence. "Let me check with him," she
says. After a dramatic pause with her eyes shut, she says, "He
confirms all that."</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, KC is talking a blue streak, but it's hard to tell.
He's slumped on the stage, muzzle resting on his paw, staring into
space. Every so often, he unleashes a loud sigh. He looks, well,
rather bored.</TE>
<TE>   The woman with the bed-wetting terrier fears she is not "getting
it." How can she tell she is receiving telepathic images? Could she
be projecting what she hopes the dog is thinking? Could it be her
imagination?</TE>
<TE>   "When people say, 'It's only imagination,' yes it is," Smith says.
"If you open your imagination, you are open to this. But there is a
difference between fabrication, projecting and being open to
receiving communication."</TE>
<TE>   How can she know for sure? The woman presses.</TE>
<TE>   Smith does not suffer skeptics well. "All of this invalidation is
a bunch of you know what," she says, sticking out her chin.</TE>
<TE>   "We are born with the ability to telecommunicate with animals,"
she says. "I haven't met anybody who cannot do it. But you have to
say 'yes' to it."</TE>

<HD>Rosemary W. Leary, 66; Ex-Wife of 1960s Psychedelic Guru</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rosemary Woodruff Leary, psychedelic guru Timothy Leary's third wife,
who became a fugitive and lived underground for 23 years after her
husband escaped from prison in 1970, has died. She was 66.</LD>
<LD>   Leary, who was arrested along with her husband for drug possession
several times in the '60s, died Thursday of congestive heart failure
at her home in Aptos, near Santa Cruz, according to her friend Denis
Berry.</LD>
<LD>   Born Rosemary Sarah Woodruff in St. Louis, Leary had worked as an
airline stewardess and was modeling when she met her future husband
at an art exhibition opening in New York City in 1965.</LD>
<TE>   She accepted an invitation to visit him at the Millbrook Estate in
Dutchess County, New York, which the former Harvard psychologist was
using as a center for his psychedelic research.</TE>
<TE>   Their relationship was marked by a series of arrests, the first in
Laredo, Texas, in 1965 for possession of marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   In 1966, Dutchess County Assistant Dist Atty. G. Gordon Liddy, the
future Watergate figure, was on hand for a drug raid at the Millbrook
Estate.</TE>
<TE>   The Learys were married in 1967, followed by another arrest for
marijuana possession in Laguna Beach in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   Rosemary Leary, according to her friends, was released on bail and
began raising money for her husband's legal defense fund.</TE>
<TE>   Timothy Leary, facing up to 20 years for two drug possession
convictions, was sent to the Men's Colony, a state prison in San Luis
Obispo County, in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't there long.</TE>
<TE>   With the aid of his wife, the Weather Underground and others,
Leary escaped by shimmying across a telephone line to the other side
of the prison fence and a waiting car.</TE>
<TE>   With forged passports, the couple fled the country.</TE>
<TE>   They found refuge with the Black Panthers in Algeria until the
Panthers "detained" Leary and his wife. They managed to escape and
fled to Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   Their marriage strained by their life in exile, the couple
separated in 1971.</TE>
<TE>   In 1973, Leary was detained while trying to enter Afghanistan and
was returned to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   After serving time in California's Folsom State Prison, he was
released on parole in 1976. The Learys divorced the same year.</TE>
<TE>   But Rosemary Leary remained underground for 23 years, living in
Afghanistan, Sicily and Central and South America through the '70s.</TE>
<TE>   After secretly returning to the United States in 1980, she lived
under the name Sarah Woodruff and held a variety of jobs on Cape Cod,
in San Francisco and in Half Moon Bay, Calif., where she managed an
inn.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1993, she resurfaced and had her legal record cleared of
the bail-jumping and fugitive charges with the help of a lawyer
obtained by her ex-husband.</TE>
<TE>   The pair had reestablished contact a couple of years earlier,
according to Berry, and had resumed a close friendship.</TE>
<TE>   By 1995, the onetime leader of the hippie drug culture was dying
of inoperable prostate cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is an added sweetness to Tim now," Rosemary Leary
told The Times. "In the past you would say he was brilliant, bigger
than life, all those things, but not so much a sweet person. Now
there is a gentleness about him."</TE>
<TE>   Leary died May 31, 1996.</TE>
<TE>   In the last years of her life, his ex-wife wrote freelance
articles and managed the trust that administered Leary's copyrights
and archives, according to her friends.</TE>
<TE>   A natural raconteur, she lectured to college students about the
psychedelic revolution.</TE>
<TE>   And at the time of her death, she was working on the final draft
of her memoirs.</TE>
<TE>   Berry described her friend as "bright, funny and warm."</TE>
<TE>   "She was just kind of establishing a group of friends [in recent
years]," Berry said, "after all those years she was on the run and
couldn't tell people who she was. This was the first time she had to

<HD>Bob Wooler, 76; Beatles Advisor Planned Band's First Major
British Gig</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Wooler, the former disc jockey credited with helping to launch
the Beatles, has died. He was 76.</LD>
<LD>   Wooler died Friday at the Royal Liverpool Hospital after a long
illness, his friend Allan Williams said. Wooler suffered from a heart
condition and diabetes.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Liverpool, England, the former dock railway clerk met John
Lennon in the late 1950s, when the two men played in rival skiffle
groups. Skiffle music was a mixture of acoustic, black, folk, jug
band and country styles rooted in 1920s American music.</LD>
<TE>   Wooler organized the Beatles' first major British gig after their
return from a string of appearances in Hamburg, Germany, in 1960. He
also introduced the band on stage hundreds of times at Liverpool's
legendary Cavern club.</TE>
<TE>   Liverpool deejay Billy Butler said Wooler "was there at the birth
of it all [the Beatles], with the skiffle groups."</TE>
<TE>   "He was a legend at the Cavern, and not just for the Beatles but
the whole Mersey Beat scene," said Butler, referring to other
Liverpool groups such as Gerry and the Pacemakers.</TE>
<TE>   Lennon, who sometimes introduced Wooler as his father, asked him
to accompany the band to its first meeting with future manager Brian
Epstein in late 1961.</TE>
<TE>   When Epstein and the group moved to London, they invited Wooler to
join them. He chose to stay in his native Liverpool, even though it
was obvious to him what phenomenal success awaited the group.</TE>
<TE>   Calling them "rhythmic revolutionaries" and a "personality cult,"
he wrote in mid-1961, when they were still mainly a Liverpool
sensation, "I think the Beatles are No. 1 because they resurrected
original style rock 'n' roll music.... I don't think anything like
them will happen again."</TE>
<TE>   Beatles expert Phil Coppell said Wooler was a friend and advisor
to the Beatles, and they trusted him to provide an assessment of
Epstein.</TE>
<TE>   "If Bob had turned around and said to them, 'Don't trust him,'
then things might have turned out differently. He was a witty man and
a good friend whom the Beatles trusted," Coppell said.</TE>
<TE>   Wooler's relationship with Lennon did not always run smoothly; the
pair came to blows at Paul McCartney's 21st birthday party,
apparently after Wooler made a joke about Lennon's sexuality. Wooler
made light of the incident later and remained friends with Lennon.</TE>
<TE>   He was the Cavern's emcee for seven years, leaving when the club
closed in 1967. He later helped mount Beatle conventions and
organized tours of the Beatles' former Liverpool haunts for visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Wooler was divorced from his wife, Beryl Adams.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral details were not immediately available.</TE>

<LD>Don't expect Rep. Dick Armey to get all warm and fuzzy about what
President Bush described as "the gathering momentum of millions of
acts of service and decency and kindness." In last month's State of
the Union address, Bush proposed to dramatically expand the budget
for AmeriCorps--which he would place under the new umbrella group USA
Freedom Corps and use, in part, for homeland security purposes. He
also suggested that all Americans contribute at least 4,000 hours
over their lifetimes.</LD>
<LD>   But Armey will have none of that. Asked by reporters how he would
fulfill that obligation, the House majority leader, a Texas
Republican who will retire at the end of this session of Congress,
joked that he intends to play a lot of poker instead.</LD>
<LD>   "I think the conceptual framework of AmeriCorps is obnoxious,"
Armey scoffed last week when asked about Bush's proposal. He and
other congressional Republicans have tried for years to kill
AmeriCorps, which has engaged some 50,000 Americans, mostly young
people, to teach, build housing, clean up rivers and streams and help
victims of natural disasters. Now, with the Republican president
embracing the national service program created by President Clinton,
it's clear that more than just party politics is involved.</LD>
<TE>   What is it about AmeriCorps--and its cousin, the Senior
Corps--that sticks in the craw? Armey and some other Republicans
object to what they see as government-supervised charity. In the case
of AmeriCorps particularly, they see red over taxpayer stipends to
so-called "volunteers" who work wherever a government bureaucrat
sends them--to poor communities, usually. AmeriCorps members
typically earn $9,300 for a 10-month stint, plus a $4,700 scholarship
if they complete the term.</TE>
<TE>   How many Americans could afford to commit that much time without
any compensation?</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, most Americans, whose hearts are bigger than Dick
Armey's, think this money is well spent. The president wants to fund
an additional 25,000 AmeriCorps members and to expand the Senior
Corps by 100,000 volunteers, up from the current 500,000. Senior
Corps volunteers serve as foster grandparents or companions for frail
adults, or they put their old job skills to work. AmeriCorps and the
Senior Corps, as well as the Peace Corps, appeal to Americans across
the political spectrum and have made a real difference to individuals
and communities nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   These national service agencies are not the only way Americans can
help improve their schools and neighborhoods. Religious institutions,
youth groups and thousands of private service organizations all
welcome any volunteer, even one with only a few hours to spare. But
that's no excuse for Congress not to approve Bush's proposals to
expand worthy programs.</TE>

<HD>Solar Finally Gets Practical</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Starting last month, Los Angeles residents began finding a small ray
of sunshine in their utility bills. The Department of Water and
Power, hoping to make rooftop solar panels as ubiquitous as low-flow
toilets, has launched a yearlong program of rebates and tax credits
to encourage homeowners to tap into the sun. An insert in every DWP
bill describes the program that puts some serious money behind this
plan.</LD>
<LD>   Solar power still generates only 1% of California's electricity,
but solar's cheerleaders, long considered granola-eating idealists,
have kept the faith. Southern California's many days of sunshine and
moderate climate, they believe, make this region ideal for
residential solar power systems. But to get the free energy from the
sun you have to install a mighty expensive photovoltaic grid. A
two-kilowatt system, enough to generate 60% to 80% of the electricity
for an average home, still costs $16,000.</LD>
<LD>   With electricity costs skyrocketing over the last year and
terrorism raising new concerns about the security of foreign energy
supplies, solar looks a little less unrealistic. Advances in panel
manufacturing have lowered costs and greatly improved reliability.</LD>
<TE>   Many earlier solar systems were stand-alone units, unconnected to
the energy grid. Current home and business systems are
grid-connected. That means solar energy is used to meet a home's
demand first, then any excess power is fed to the grid. If more solar
power is generated than used, consumers receive a credit--and can see
their electric meter actually spin backward. At night and when there
isn't strong sunshine, homeowners draw electricity from the grid.</TE>
<TE>   As S. David Freeman, the plain-speaking former DWP chief, says,
it's "just kind of dumb to get the rays free of charge but not figure
out how to use them in large quantities." Utility officials think
residents and businesses just need a push to do that.</TE>
<TE>   So now through December the DWP is sweetening its Solar Incentive
Program by offering cash incentives covering up to half the cost of
the photovoltaic equipment: A $16,000 system will cost the homeowner
$8,000, and a more basic system, retailing at $9,000, will go for
$4,500. In addition, the DWP will help connect customers with makers
of solar systems and qualified installers.</TE>
<TE>   The DWP says 1,300 households have gone solar just since last
July; the goal is to encourage installation of 100,000 solar power
systems by 2010, generating 100 megawatts. That's not just an
enviro-hobby anymore.</TE>

<HD>Leadership Door Revolves</HD>

<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>One Southern California Democrat succeeded another this week as
speaker of the 80-member state Assembly, but the comparison pretty
much ends there. Herb Wesson, a native of Cleveland who once sold
pots and pans door to door, will direct the sometimes-unruly house
with a far different style from that of predecessor Bob Hertzberg of
Sherman Oaks.</LD>
<LD>   Wesson, 50, of Los Angeles, is offering members a more
collaborative manner of leadership than Hertzberg, known as a
micromanager who sometimes did not listen well enough. Part of the
job is to mediate disputes within the Assembly and the Democratic
caucus and to bring competing parties toward compromise. It's not a
duty for the impatient.</LD>
<LD>   Wesson's collaborative style helped win him election to the
speakership by acclamation, only the second time that has happened.
Of course, this initial popularity does not tell how effective a
speaker Wesson will be, as a leader and chief legislator in a painful
time of shrinking resources. He spent much of his career in
government as a subordinate, first as an aide to Los Angeles City
Councilman Nate Holden and later to county Supervisor Yvonne
Brathwaite Burke.</LD>
<TE>   Wesson was elected to the Assembly in 1998 and was chairman of the
Governmental Organization Committee, a position that allowed him to
raise lots of money to help fellow Democrats because the panel
receives legislation that affects well-heeled special interests. Such
fund-raising has unfortunately been a key for anyone aspiring to be
speaker.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson's honeymoon will be short. With term limits allowing
Assembly members just six years in office, a speaker serves two years
at most. Wesson must deal immediately with the state budget crisis.
He will have to negotiate with Gov. Gray Davis and Senate President
Pro Tem John Burton, both of whom far surpass him in elected
political experience.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson sometimes exudes the air of a wheeler-dealer, a sort of
''Guys and Dolls'' character. But colleagues so far like his outgoing
leadership style. ''He has an iron fist in a velvet glove,'' the
ability to be congenial even in addressing tough decisions, said one.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly speakers aren't the ruling powers they were before term
limits: Think Willie Brown. Think Jess Unruh. But the effectiveness
of a legislative session still greatly depends on the speaker. Wesson
will need lots of both iron and velvet to succeed.</TE>

<HD>Federal Subsidies Are Home on the Range</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Tom Gorman's Feb. 5 article, "Battle for Room on the Range," he
briefly touched on what the true problem is regarding grazing, wild
horses and federal lands. This one sentence is the key to what really
worries a few ranchers: "Today, ranchers pay the government about
$1.35 a month for each cow that feeds on public land." Conversely,
private lands charge an average of $11.20 per month. This number also
does not include drought, fire and predator protection moneys and no
requirement to pay property taxes, because the cattle are on federal
lands.</LD>
<LD>   Listening to ranchers talk, one would think that all beef in
America, nay, the world, is supplied by cattle raised in the West on
federal lands. However, the truth is that about 22,000 of the
1.6-million cattle are raised on federal land. In fact, more cattle
are raised in Pennsylvania and Louisiana than in Wyoming and Nevada.</LD>
<LD>   So if all cattle were removed from federal lands tomorrow the
market probably wouldn't flinch. This while the federal government
loses millions each year subsidizing a few people; some of them are
billionaire businessmen and major corporations.</LD>
<TE>   The ranchers using federal lands have a real sweet deal going on
with our taxpayer dollars. They sit back, complain about federal
intervention and Eastern misunderstanding of a way of life, all while
they head to the bank to deposit federal taxpayer dollars collected
from all over America.</TE>
<TE>   Horses are not the problem; they are a part of American history,
as is farming. Misuse of public lands and grazing rights is not.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Heyde</TE>
<TE>   Policy Analyst, Society for Animal Protective Legislation</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is true that mustangs are part of the history and romance of
the Old West, but sadly the Old West no longer exists. Erosion
throughout the Southwest is a legacy of overgrazing. The result is
destruction of habitat for many species of plants and animals. As
romantic as the wild horses are, there are far too many of them. The
Bureau of Land Management's stewardship of Western lands, while not
perfect, is far better than uncontrolled grazing of horses, cattle
and, pardon the expression, sheep.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Tim Salt's removal as manager of the California Desert District
office of the Bureau of Land Management will not, I am sure, result
in actions more favorable to mining, livestock grazing and
recreational interests (Feb. 1). There is little wiggle room for BLM
when decisions involve plants and animals listed under the Endangered
Species Act. To top this, the BLM Desert District office is under
court order to restrict activities that might have an impact on the
desert tortoise and a number of other listed species.</LD>
<LD>   Politics are definitely at play in Salt's ouster. His decisions,
based on the best available data, properly strive to balance
protection of sensitive resources against uses of the public lands
within the constraints posed by the lawsuit. Perhaps the
organizations that oppose these decisions will now be satisfied with
his removal, and those up the BLM chain of command can now relax.</LD>

<LD>I'd like to fill in some blanks for the historians about the Bridge
to Nowhere (''A Span Without a Reason, Frozen in Time,'' Jan. 31).</LD>
<LD>   My father's construction company, E.S. and N.S. Johnson, built the
bridge. Family photographs refer to it as the San Gabriel Canyon
Bridge. It was completed in 1936 at a cost of $19,719. During
construction, my parents and grandfather lived in two small cabins
downriver from the bridge. My father, Norman Johnson, and his company
went on to build many other bridges in California. Most of them still
go somewhere.</LD>

<HD>Budget Blues: Are Critics Crying Wolf or Foul?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Scheer's "An Orgy of Defense Spending" (Commentary, Feb. 5)
claims that an increase in the Defense Department budget from $331
billion this year to $451 billion in 2007 will result in "an
economically hobbled United States, unable to solve its major
domestic problems . . . its enormous wealth sacrificed at the altar
of military hardware." It's amazing to see all of this angst and
panic for an increase over five years of only $120 billion, which is
less than 6% of the 2003 federal budget of $2.13 trillion.</LD>
<LD>   Scheer derides the capabilities of intelligence agencies that
"lost the trail of terrorists who easily found cover with lap dancers
in strip joints." His solution: "The bottom line is that we need
sharper agents, not more expensive equipment." If the CIA, et al.,
are already getting the sharpest people who can be found (or as sharp
as will join them), then the only way to improve our intelligence
gathering is to get better equipment.</LD>
<LD>   I am disappointed that Scheer finds it necessary to resort to
fantasizing about a war on three fronts. That may be what Scheer
thinks is meant by the president's "axis of evil," but no
administration spokesperson nor any serious analysts on either side
of the aisle has said that. There are a lot of good reasons to
criticize the major planned defense buildup, but hysteria serves only
to get the critic ignored as just another liberal lunatic.</LD>

<TE>   Who says Republicans don't favor welfare? Look no further than
President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   His economic stimulus program is welfare for large corporations.
His tax cut proposals are welfare for the rich. His proposed defense
spending is welfare for the defense industry. A "Star Wars" missile
defense, which we don't need and which wouldn't work if we had it, is
welfare for the aerospace industry.</TE>
<TE>   But in the interests of the economy, keeping people like Tom
DeLay, Dick Armey, Phil Gramm and Trent Lott in office keeps them off
welfare.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Buck</TE>
<TE>   Sherman Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your poll question pitting tax cuts against Social Security (Feb.
5) assumes that a pool of money exists somewhere earmarked for Social
Security and that these funds would be "spent" on a tax cut. Bunk.
The Social Security trust fund is a scam. Its "assets" are IOUs the
government issues to itself. Money comes into Social Security, which
then lends it to the general fund by buying bonds, where it promptly
gets spent.</TE>
<TE>   When we boomers retire, the government will have no extra funds in
reserve. Our children will get stuck with the bill in the form of
giant tax increases. Were Social Security a corporate pension fund,
politicians would be holding hearings and spouting sound bites
denouncing such a Ponzi scheme.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Bass</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'm confused. What am I missing? If the payroll taxes that fund
Social Security and Medicare are generating excess revenue and we are
told that we need a tax cut to stimulate the economy, why not just
reduce those taxes? What is being proposed are tax cuts weighted more
toward higher-income people, leaving the payroll taxes intact. The
policy of shifting the tax burden of running this country more toward
middle- and lower-income people should be discussed more.</TE>

<LD>Is D.J. Waldie joking ("New Flood Control Rules Muddy the Local
Waters," Commentary, Feb. 4)? He thinks that it is too expensive for
the cities to stop trash from washing into the ocean? I walk several
blocks every evening to my gym and carry a bag to pick up trash. It's
pathetic that our citizens throw their trash in the streets. This
problem does not require a high-tech, expensive solution. It's a
matter of educating the public.</LD>
<LD>   I suggest we start by educating our children in the schools. Tell
them what happens to the litter they throw in the streets. Then we
start a statewide public relations campaign. We place commercials on
television and in other media. We ask people not to litter and show
the results from littering. Then the cities could provide trash cans
on the streets for all of us to use. And we fine people heavily for
littering, to make it clear it is not acceptable behavior. How about
a $1,000 fine for littering?</LD>
<LD>   I fail to see why Waldie thinks this is such an onerous burden on
the community. It seems to me it will cost little, and the economic
and aesthetic benefits will surely exceed the cost.</LD>

<HD>A Move to Bring 'Fetus' to Full Terminology</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Under the guise of expanding prenatal care, President Bush has
proposed to define fetuses as unborn children in order to make
fetuses eligible for health care under the Children's Health
Insurance Program (Feb. 1).</LD>
<LD>   But if his goal were really expanding access to prenatal care he
would say, "We're going to cover more pregnant women." That is
clearly not his goal, and we are concerned that giving a fetus this
status could put at risk a woman's right to make her own childbearing
decisions.</LD>
<LD>   Planned Parenthood Los Angeles enthusiastically supports the
expansion of publicly funded health care, including prenatal care for
pregnant women. We, along with others, have worked tirelessly to
increase health coverage for pregnant women. Bush has made an
inflammatory and unnecessary proposal. It was a bad idea when the
administration floated it last year--and it's still a bad idea. While
he has united the country on the war on terrorism, his domestic
agenda appears to be divisive and off-target. We urge President Bush
to join our efforts to support pregnant women through more
appropriate, existing health programs.</LD>
<TE>   Nancy L. Sasaki</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I applaud the Bush administration's declaration that a developing
fetus should be eligible for government-funded health insurance for
low-income children. Extending health care to more women during
pregnancy is sure to reduce stress in low-income mothers, and that
can only be good for the mother and the heretofore unborn child.</TE>
<TE>   I would like to act as a voice of reason among fake liberals who
denounce this landmark decision. They see it as a vast right-wing
conspiracy--an insidious ploy designed to establish a legal
foundation for outlawing abortion. I call them fake liberals because,
in order to be consistent with a liberal platform, one must stand up
for all weaker members of society who, due to built-in differential
opportunity structures, are discriminated against.</TE>

<LD>Once again, as I view the proposed new City Council districts, I see
gerrymandering is alive and well in the city of Los Angeles
("Proposal Calls for Giving a 5th Council District to Valley," Feb.
3). So many ''fingers'' and misshapen districts, simply to achieve
the desired number of citizens of the right race, nationality or
political party. In my neighborhood we live in the 10th District, our
nearest school is in the 5th District and our local police station is
in the 11th District. Stop the insanity!</LD>
<LD>   The things my neighbors and I care about when we contact our
councilperson's office are the quality and funding of local schools,
safe streets and availability of police, local parks and child care,
graffiti removal, street cleaning, streets without potholes or
gridlock, public transportation, good air quality, safe and
affordable housing, sane and enforced zoning laws, lack of billboards
or cellular towers within sight of our homes, adequate neighborhood
parking, more tree plantings, efficient trash and bulk item removal
and local business and job development. All of this is location,
location, location. So why do I feel the color of my skin is all
anyone cares about in setting the districts? My multiethnic neighbors
and I would like to know.</LD>

<HD>C. Baskerville, 66; Senior Editor of Hot Rod Magazine</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charles Gray Baskerville, whose colorful reportage in Hot Rod
magazine brought the world of custom cars and high-speed racing alive
for thousands of readers every month for 28 years, died Feb. 1 of
complications from prostate cancer. He was 66.</LD>
<LD>   A fixture at hot rod shows, drag races and speed trials across the
continent, Baskerville was easily recognizable to his legions of fans
in his trademark rubber flip-flop sandals and baggy shorts.</LD>
<LD>   Only days before his death, he had a group of friends carry him
from the bedroom of his Pasadena home so he could take a last ride in
the beloved 1932 Ford roadster that he had driven daily for almost 30
years.</LD>
<TE>   "His brother drove and they went to see his mother," said
Baskerville's widow, Susan. "That was beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   Gray Baskerville--he never used his first name--held the title of
senior editor at Hot Rod, but refused to sit behind a desk and read
other writers' copy.</TE>
<TE>   Baskerville covered most of the famous hot rods and hot rod
builders of the last quarter century, and by his own reckoning put
about 250,000 miles on his roadster visiting the car shops and car
enthusiasts he wrote about.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a guy who never sat still, who was always visiting
someone's shop, looking at the cars or writing away," said Jeff
Smith, editor of Chevy High Performance magazine and a former Hot Rod
editor and writer.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd work on pieces two, three months before they were going to
run in the magazine, turn them in way before deadline and be off on
another adventure and we just let him roll. He set his own agenda,
and that was fine with us."</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1948, Hot Rod is one of the oldest and most influential
journals covering the car culture, and Baskerville wanted to be out
there with the drivers and builders.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there was a better individual on this earth in the
writing business," said car builder and former racing driver Art
Chrisman. "He'd go from shop to shop talking to guys who build cars
and writing about us and our cars, and 99.9% of the time he was 100%
right. Not many writers can do that, but he could." Co-workers at Hot
Rod remember Baskerville as the soul of the magazine: a writer whose
distinctive voice was rarely tuned by editors.</TE>
<TE>   "He had his own style, and he'd make up words if that's what he
needed to get an idea across," said former Hot Rod Editor Ro
McGonegal, now a writer for the magazine. Fans of the wood-sided
station wagons that surfers popularized as "woodies" in the 1960s are
"fir heads" in a Baskerville piece.</TE>
<TE>   A sample from a Baskerville tale when he was the passenger on an
early morning run in a souped-up 1970s-era Mustang II that hit a top
speed of 140 mph in 10 seconds on a deserted Detroit highway:</TE>
<TE>   "But there at throttle's touch is instant launch, guaranteed to
snap tum-tums around spinal columns while causing a very real
brain-draining case of the vertigos." Baskerville, who referred to
himself in print as "yer old dad," had been a noted drag racer in the
late 1950s and early '60s with a modified pickup-bodied roadster.</TE>
<TE>   He was an outspoken proponent of the sport of auto racing,
maintaining that "real hot rods were race cars first, everything else
is silliness." He often complained in print that the National Hot Rod
Assn.'s acronym, NHRA, stood for "No Hot Rods Anymore," a reference
to the group's thick rule book that prohibits many of the street rods
he loved from competing on the track.</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't an enemy of the NHRA, but he remembered that it had
been formed to provide kids with fast cars a way to get off the
streets to race, and he thought that by professionalizing drag racing
it didn't provide that anymore," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Baskerville was born in Los Angeles and spent much of his youth in
Hermosa Beach. He was drawn into the car culture at an early age in
part because Southern California in the 1940s and early '50s was the
birthplace of the hot rod and custom car movements.</TE>
<TE>   "You became a man when you had your car," Baskerville recalled in
a 1998 interview on CNN. "It was like long pants in the generations
before us ... hot rods were the essence of manhood in the '50s ...
when you were going 100 miles an hour down a street--yeah, that was a
rush, tremendous rush, especially if you were ahead."</TE>
<TE>   Baskerville got his start as a writer working for the family
publishing business after graduating from UC Santa Barbara in 1958
with a degree in history.</TE>
<TE>   One of the titles the company published was Motorcyclist magazine,
which had been owned by his grandfather since 1919, and Gray started
doing bike reviews when he wasn't down at the local drag strip racing
his own car.</TE>
<TE>   Although he never considered himself a photographer,
Baskerville--like all Hot Rod writers--took his own pictures and was
noted for the effort he put into them.</TE>
<TE>   "When you do this for a while, you quickly find a couple of good
angles that always work and you can get your shots in 15 or 20
minutes," Smith said. "But Dad would get up before dawn on a Saturday
to go take a picture of a car he was writing about just to get the
best light. He'd say, 'Hey, this guy spent five or six years building
this car and getting it just right, the least I can do is spend some
time making it look good.'''</TE>
<TE>   At home, Baskerville was an avid gardener, reader and fan of early
American jazz.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his widow, Baskerville is survived by a daughter,
Elizabeth, and his mother, Lenore, both of Pasadena, and a brother,
David of Hermosa Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Baskerville's remains were cremated Thursday and, at his request,

<HD>William Dillard, 87; Founded Chain of Department Stores</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William T. Dillard, who built one of the nation's largest retail
chains out of a modest store he started during the Depression, died
Friday at his home in Little Rock, Ark. He was 87.</LD>
<LD>   Dillard was chairman of Dillard's Inc., formerly known as Dillard
Department Stores. The chain he started in 1938 with a
2,500-square-foot store in southwestern Arkansas now has nearly 350
stores in 30 states, including two California stores, in Palmdale and
Stockton.</LD>
<LD>   In 1989, Fortune magazine called the chain "a quiet superstar ...
family run, highly computerized, extremely competitive and great for
investors."</LD>
<TE>   Born in Mineral Springs, a small town 110 miles southwest of
Little Rock, Dillard graduated from the University of Arkansas with a
degree in business administration. He earned a master's degree in
business administration from Columbia University in 1937. The next
year he borrowed $8,000 from his father, who ran a well-known country
store, and opened T.J. Dillard's in Nashville, Ark.</TE>
<TE>   During the first year, the store did $42,000 in business and he
made a $3,000 profit. Last year, Dillard's had sales of $8.7 billion
and was the nation's third-largest upscale department store chain,
behind Federated and May.</TE>
<TE>   Hit hard by the economic decline, Dillard's has seen its stock
fall from above $50 in 1992-93 into the $10-$20 range recently. But
the company is still run by the family, whose members hold five of
the 12 seats on the board. Dillard, who worked full days well into
his 80s, had turned over the day-to-day management to sons William
II, Mike and Alex.</TE>
<TE>   Dillard served in the Navy during World War II. By 1948, he had
made enough money to open a department store in Texarkana. He sold
the Nashville store and opened two more in Magnolia and Tyler, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   By 1960, Dillard once recalled, he was 45 and making more than
$500,000 a year. "But I wasn't satisfied. I wanted to be a leading
department store owner," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1963, he and some associates bought Pfeifer's of Arkansas, then
one of the state's leading stores. Six months later, he bought Blass
Co., another leading Arkansas store, in downtown Little Rock. Dillard
moved to Little Rock, where he established his company headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   When he realized that downtown stores were losing appeal, he began
buying up locations in suburban malls and untapped small-town
markets.</TE>
<TE>   In building one of the country's fastest-growing department store
chains, he stuck to tried-and-true brands, such as Liz Claiborne in
women's clothing and Hickey-Freeman in men's. He used a computer
network to track what was selling and to keep his racks full when an
item became a hot seller.</TE>
<TE>   Before computers, Dillard had store managers call him every night
with a total of the day's receipts. When one manager said he had a
slow day because of bad weather, Dillard said, "If I had wanted a
weather report, I would have called the weather bureau."</TE>
<TE>   Dillard is survived by his wife, Alexa, and five children.
Services are scheduled for Monday in Little Rock.</TE>

<HD>Max Perutz, 87; Pioneer in Field of Molecular Biology</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Max Perutz, the British chemist whose efforts to solve the riddle of
life by unraveling protein structures led to the creation of the
field of molecular biology, died Wednesday of cancer at his home in
Cambridge. He was 87.</LD>
<LD>   Perutz and his colleague John C. Kendrew were the first to
determine the three-dimensional structure of proteins, the molecular
machines that run cells. Their feat garnered them the 1962 Nobel
Prize for chemistry. More important, it gave scientists their first
insight into how chemical reactions within the cell are carried out.</LD>
<LD>   Enzymes, in particular, are the movers and shakers of the cellular
world, said molecular biologist Richard Dickerson of UCLA, "but we
had no idea how they worked until we could get molecular structures."</LD>
<TE>   Perutz devised the technique known as "isomorphic replacement"
that for the first time allowed scientists to convert the massive
amounts of data obtained from shining X-rays on a protein into a
precise picture of the arrangement of individual atoms. His discovery
unleashed a flood on new data.</TE>
<TE>   Perutz published the structure of hemoglobin--the complex protein
that carries oxygen and carbon dioxide through the bloodstream--in
1959. By the end of the next decade, researchers were using his
technique to publish an average of one new structure a day.</TE>
<TE>   A check at an online protein structure database Friday showed that
it contained 17,248 individual structures.</TE>
<TE>   Perutz's achievement was "absolutely monumental," said molecular
biologist Thomas Poulos of UC Irvine. "He put the 'molecular' in
molecular biology."</TE>
<TE>   Perutz was also the founder and first director of the renowned
Laboratory of Molecular Biology at Cambridge, which has produced nine
Nobel laureates since the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   There are two major problems in doing X-ray crystallography of
proteins: growing the proteins themselves and analyzing the data.
Perutz chose hemoglobin as the subject of his research not only for
its biological importance, but also because hemoglobin crystals could
be grown readily. Nonetheless, he often was said to have a "glass
thumb" because of his facility at producing protein crystals.</TE>
<TE>   Analyzing Data Proved Tough Task</TE>
<TE>   The more important problem was data analysis. When X-rays are
passed through a crystal, their paths are bent by interactions with
the individual atoms, producing a characteristic pattern of spots on
photographic film. The accumulated data from the spots has two unique
characteristics, called amplitude and phase.</TE>
<TE>   When Perutz began his work at Cambridge's Cavendish laboratory in
the late 1930s, physicists William Bragg and Lawrence Bragg had
learned how to calculate amplitudes, which made it possible to deduce
the structures of simple molecules, such as inorganic salts. But
phases had proved intractable.</TE>
<TE>   Perutz's inspiration was to add a single atom of a heavy metal,
such as mercury, to each molecule of hemoglobin before exposing it to
X-rays. Such metals diffract X-rays much more strongly, leaving a
unique signature. Adding the mercury atoms at different locations on
the molecule--isomorphous replacement--and comparing the resultant
X-ray patterns caused by the change gave Perutz a baseline from which
he was able to calculate the position of all the other 11,000 atoms
in the hemoglobin molecule.</TE>
<TE>   Kendrew, a postdoctoral fellow in Perutz's laboratory and later
the first staff member at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology,
actually beat Perutz into print by two years, publishing the
structure of myoglobin--a protein that stores oxygen in muscle--in
1957. But he used Perutz's technique to do it.</TE>
<TE>   Perutz found that hemoglobin was much more complicated, consisting
of four subunits, each of which looked very similar to myoglobin. By
1970, he was able to show that when oxygen binds to one of the
subunits, it changes the shape of the entire molecule, exposing sites
on the other three subunits where oxygen would quickly bind.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, when a fully oxygenated hemoglobin molecule loses one
oxygen molecule, its shape changes in such a manner that the other
three oxygen molecules are quickly released as well. This feat marked
the first time that biologists had completely understood how a
protein functioned.</TE>
<TE>   That was a major feat for a boy whose parents had wanted him to
become a lawyer and take over their textile business.</TE>
<TE>   Max Ferdinand Perutz was born in Vienna on May 19, 1914. He
enrolled at the University of Vienna fully intending to honor his
parents' wishes, but was seduced by the mysteries of chemistry and
biology and became a chemist instead. His university's chemistry
department still was mired in 19th century ideas, however, and,
supported financially by his parents, he escaped to the more
progressive confines of Cambridge in 1936.</TE>
<TE>   His parents were forced to abandon their textile business and
follow him a few years later when Adolf Hitler took over Austria.</TE>
<TE>   Now classified as a refugee and with his parents homeless, Perutz
had few financial resources. To finance a vacation in Switzerland in
1938, he snared a grant to apply his knowledge of crystallography to
glaciers. He was the first to demonstrate how glaciers move, showing
that ice on the surface flowed faster than ice near the glacier's
bed.</TE>
<TE>   In 1940, the German invasion of Holland and Belgium prompted
England to arrest all "enemy aliens," including Perutz. "It was a
very nice, very sunny day--a nasty day to be arrested," he recalled
in Horace Freeland Judson's "The Eighth Day of Creation: Makers of
the Revolution in Biology."</TE>
<TE>   Perutz spent nearly a year in various internment facilities,
ending up at a camp in Quebec, where many other intellectuals and
scientists were held. Perutz created a camp university, where the
various residents lectured about their specialties. He taught a
course of crystallography.</TE>
<TE>   Helped Develop Ice 'Aircraft Carriers'</TE>
<TE>   By 1941, the British government had recognized its mistake and
Perutz and his colleagues were returned to England, where most
enlisted in the war effort. Because of his experience with glaciers,
he was assigned the task of developing "aircraft carriers" made of
ice that could be anchored in the Atlantic Ocean to provide refueling
stations for planes being flown from the United States to Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Perutz successfully devised a chemical process to harden ice so
that it was resistant to bullets, but it became apparent that the
cost of the way stations would be lower if they were made of steel.
The advent of long-distance capabilities for planes rendered the
entire enterprise superfluous.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, he was able to turn his efforts toward deciphering
proteins and eventually toward running the Laboratory of Molecular
Biology. The great success of the lab has been attributed to his
ability to recruit visionary scientists and then to leave them alone.</TE>
<TE>   "Well-run laboratories can foster [creativity]," he wrote in an
essay, "but hierarchical organization, inflexible, bureaucratic rules
and mountains of futile paperwork can kill it."</TE>
<TE>   He handed off leadership of the institution to Sidney Brenner in
1979, but worked in his own laboratory until just before Christmas.
Most recently, he had been studying the brain plaques and tangles
that characterize diseases such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's.
Publication is pending for several of his papers.</TE>
<TE>   In his later years, Perutz wrote popular essays for the New York
Review of Books. They were collected in two books, "I Wish I Had Made
You Angry Earlier: Essays on Science, Scientists and Humanity" and
"Is Science Necessary? Essays on Science and Scientists."</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Gisela, whom he married in 1942, and
children Robin and Vivien.</TE>

<LD>Long Beach police sought the public's help Friday in finding a
teenager who sexually molested an 11-year-old Long Beach boy after
dragging him to a wooden shed.</LD>
<LD>   The Jan. 29 attack occurred near Hill Street and Martin Luther
King Jr. Avenue in west Long Beach, said Nancy Tabing of the Long
Beach Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   The suspect is described as a 15- to 18-year-old black male. He is
short and stocky, weighing about 200 pounds and standing 5 feet 5,
with brown eyes, short black hair and a "high-pitched voice," police
said. He had a diamond earring in his left ear and acne scars on his
cheeks.</LD>
<TE>   The 11-year-old victim was walking home and was at the entrance of
an alley when he was knocked unconscious by a blow to the back of the
neck, police said.</TE>
<TE>   When the victim regained consciousness, he was being dragged into
a shed behind a house in the 2100 block of King Avenue, Tabing said.</TE>
<TE>   The suspect then started to sexually assault the boy but stopped
when he heard a noise outside, she said. The victim escaped at that
point.</TE>
<TE>   The suspect was last seen riding a chrome scooter west on 21st
Street from Myrtle Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information is asked to call Det. John McBride at
(562) 570-7259.</TE>

<HD>Killer Gets 2 Consecutive Life Terms</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A San Fernando Valley man was sentenced Friday to two consecutive
life terms without the possibility of parole for the execution-style
slayings of a Hells Angels member and his girlfriend.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel Ray Waring, 44, was convicted in October of first-degree
murder in the 1998 shootings of Laurence "Large Larry" Lajeunesse,
45, and Tammie Ann Brannigan, 35, in the Chatsworth garage that the
couple shared.</LD>
<LD>   During the trial, which lasted more than four months, Deputy Dist.
Atty. Jeff Jonas described Waring as a Hells Angel wannabe who was
never allowed into the notorious biker gang and repeatedly tried to
inform on the bikers to get even.</LD>
<TE>   "I view Mr. Waring as a social psychopath ... lying, cheating,
manipulating," Jonas said in court Friday. "He is a criminal
psychopath leaving a trail of broken hearts, empty wallets and
shattered lives."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Waring killed Lajeunesse after they had a falling
out over methamphetamine dealing. They said he shot the 6-foot-2,
450-pound biker five times in the back of the head, and killed
Brannigan to eliminate her as a witness.</TE>
<TE>   Waring denies the killings and said it was John Kopp--later found
dead with a rope around his neck--who shot the couple. Prosecutors
contended that Kopp was a witness to the slayings. His death was
ruled a suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Before the sentencing, Waring read a prepared statement in which
he addressed the court and the families of the victims.</TE>
<TE>   "I could not and I did not kill Tammie Brannigan. I did not kill
Large Larry," Waring said. "I was wrongly found guilty of this case.
I was not the Hells Angel wannabe; John Kopp was. I was not the one
in the picture that [Jonas] painted; John Kopp was. Why else would he
take his own life by hanging?"</TE>
<TE>   San Fernando Superior Court Judge Shari Silver denied requests by
defense attorneys Mark Brandt and Dan Factor to allow Waring to serve
his prison sentences concurrently, calling Waring a "danger to
society" whose crimes had become more violent.</TE>
<TE>   Brandt, who said Waring was denied a fair trial because of errors
and misconduct by prosecutors, police and the court, filed a notice
of appeal in the case Friday.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Las Virgenes Unified School District on Friday agreed to pay
$3.25 million for land in Calabasas, where it is building a
much-needed middle school.</LD>
<LD>   The action, taken in closed session by the Board of Education,
settles a yearlong dispute between the district and the owners of the
31-acre parcel over the value of the land.</LD>
<LD>   The owners placed it at $5.75 million; a district-ordered
appraisal set it at $1.25 million.</LD>
<TE>   The new school will be the third junior high in the 12,100-student
district and the second in Calabasas.</TE>
<TE>   Grading of the site at Mulholland Highway and Paul Revere Drive
began after the district took the property last spring through
eminent domain.</TE>

<LD>If the San Fernando Valley succeeds in breaking away from L.A., Ed
Brand suggests that the new city be named: DOOWYLLOH.</LD>
<LD>   Sort of a mouthful, I admit. But Brand asks, "Why waste a
landmark?"</LD>
<LD>   DOOWYLLOH is the way the HOLLYWOOD sign would read from the Valley
side.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Unclear on the concept: Tony LaHood of Irvine found an advertiser
in the Verizon Yellow Pages who had done a curious takeoff on the
"Got milk?" ads (see accompanying). The obvious question is how the
deceased party would contact the funeral service, though I guess some
of these new-fangled cell phones can do almost anything.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dead (cont.): I dialed the number several times over a period of
days, but received only busy signals.</TE>
<TE>   So I called a Verizon rep who checked and found the ad was placed
by a legitimate advertiser but couldn't offer any additional
information.</TE>
<TE>   The rep said that while the language of the ad "may not be in the
best taste, it does not violate" any Verizon policies.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More from our Halloween-in-February issue: Sal Lombardo snapped a
shot of a different kind of one-stop-shopping opportunity (see
photo).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And this creepy item: LaHood, discoverer of the "Dead" listing,
admittedly has an eye for the macabre. In a Manila newspaper, he came
upon a laundry hamper with an interesting feature (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coming clean with the listeners: I was surprised when I heard
Arnie Spanier of KXTA-AM (1150) announce that he had been named worst
sports show host by the L.A. Times and the L.A. Daily News.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, in the world of talk radio, I'm not sure whether it's
preferable to be ranked best or worst.</TE>
<TE>   Spanier, though good-natured, is a motor-mouth who seems to be
gargling as he speaks. (I swear I felt spray coming through my radio
the other day.)</TE>
<TE>   But should anyone doubt whether the show has public value, author
Alan Eisenstock points out in his entertaining book "Sports Talk"
that Spanier once vowed that if the Lakers won the NBA championship,
he'd wash the cars of all the team's fans.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers did, and Spanier put in three hours of work at a Studio
City car wash.</TE>
<TE>   No word on whether he'll make a similar promise this year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stupid pedaling tricks: I found myself creeping in my car behind a
bicyclist who was in the middle of a narrow street and barely moving.
He took no notice of me for several seconds.</TE>
<TE>   The road hog's problem? You guessed it: He was on a cell phone.
Got brains?</TE>

<HD>Engineers Give Quake Warning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Efforts to prepare for the next devastating earthquake in California
are lagging, the founding head of the National Earthquake Hazards
Reduction Program warned at a conference of quake engineers.</LD>
<LD>   Charles C. Thiel Jr., now a principal at Telesis Engineers in
Berkeley, told the engineers, meeting in Long Beach, that it was
"astounding" that in the last 20 years, despite billions of dollars
in damage caused by the Northridge and Loma Prieta earthquakes,
government research funding has decreased.</LD>
<LD>   Thiel called for more research into ways to improve the quake
performance of existing buildings. Officials and researchers are
preoccupied with efforts to study and map fault lines and areas of
heavy shaking rather than find ways to strengthen buildings to reduce
hazards, he said.</LD>
<TE>   "Ninety-nine percent of the buildings that will collapse in the
next big earthquake exist today," he said, "and yet the attention
that is going into engineering often is only devoted to future
buildings."</TE>
<TE>   The three-day meeting of the Earthquake Engineering Research
Institute, which ends today, brought together many of California's
leading structural engineers. Much of the first day, Thursday, was
devoted to reviewing the consequences of the Long Beach earthquake of
March 10, 1933.</TE>
<TE>   State officials moved quickly to pass new laws changing building
codes, speakers at the conference said. By contrast, since the 1994
Northridge quake, they said, there have been comparatively few steps
taken, despite new lessons learned from that quake's damage.</TE>
<TE>   The Long Beach quake, measuring magnitude 6.4, caused 120 deaths,
the second-biggest toll of any temblor in state history. Severe
damage to 70 schools led the Legislature, after a single day of
debate, to pass the landmark Field Act to assure safer school
construction.</TE>
<TE>   The 1933 quake took place at 5:54 p.m. Had it happened during the
school day, 2,000 to 10,000 schoolchildren would have died, Allan R.
Porush, an engineer with URS Corp., told the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Porush and Roy G. Johnston, another engineer, paid tribute to the
leaders of 1933 for acting decisively both to improve the schools and
to adopt codes recognizing the risks posed by unreinforced masonry
buildings.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, after Northridge, Los Angeles City Council members
backed off requiring retrofitting of types of buildings shown to have
fared badly, said Terry Dooley of Morley Construction. Dooley, who
has worked on building the new Roman Catholic cathedral in Los
Angeles, helped organize this week's meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Caltech seismologist Egill Hauksson, however, said the state has
made a substantial bridge retrofitting effort since Northridge and
that problems with steel-frame buildings have been the subject of
major corrective studies funded by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting also featured a discussion of scenarios for a possible
7.1-magnitude quake on the Palos Verdes fault in the South Bay area.</TE>
<TE>   Although speakers cautioned that outcomes could vary widely,
depending on the location of a quake's epicenter, Doug Huls of the
California Office of Emergency Services said a temblor of that size
could cause 700 deaths, 7,000 injuries, render 100,000 people
homeless and leave 44 million tons of debris to be removed.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, he noted, the destruction of the World Trade Center
in New York by terrorists left 900,000 tons of debris.</TE>

<HD>L.A. City Council Urges Review of Secession Studies</HD>
<DH>Government: Controller may be asked to examine findings
that Valley and harbor entities could be financially viable.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a new challenge to secession proposals, the Los Angeles City
Council agreed Friday to ask the state controller to review another
agency's financial studies that concluded the San Fernando Valley and
harbor areas could be fiscally viable as separate cities.</LD>
<LD>   The action came on the same day that a new poll by KABC-TV Channel
7 and SurveyUSA found that 59% of adult residents in the Valley
support secession, while 43% of residents citywide supported creation
of a Valley city.</LD>
<LD>   By comparison, the last poll done by the Los Angeles Times in
March 2001 found that 51% of Valley residents support secession, down
from 60% in a Times poll in March 1999.</LD>
<TE>   "This poll is more favorable toward a Valley city than even I
imagined," said Richard Close, chairman of the secession group Valley
VOTE. "Despite a constant barrage by the mayor and his deputies
against Valley cityhood, this poll validates that the public wants to
set up a separate Valley city."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn discounted the poll's significance, saying it
comes before a planned campaign pointing out the drawbacks of
secession.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, I think it is a bad idea for the city, but up until now
the debate has been pretty one-sided," Hahn said. "I'm going out now
and telling people why we should keep the city together."</TE>
<TE>   The campaign for public opinion is occurring on a parallel track
to city challenges against secession.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski said that asking the state
controller to examine financial studies by the Local Agency Formation
Commission made sense to determine if they are accurate in concluding
that breakaway areas would be fiscally viable cities.</TE>
<TE>   "All we are doing is saying, 'Have a third-party review,' " said
Miscikowski, who heads a council committee overseeing the secession
process. "It's really questioning the fiscal viability: Is it valid?
Is it sound? Were there errors in the [study] findings?"</TE>
<TE>   The council voted to approve a request for review under protest,
asserting that LAFCO's financial study for Valley cityhood is, in the
words of one city attorney, a "dead document" because Valley
secessionists have subsequently proposed a dramatically different
plan for a new city.</TE>
<TE>   Close accused city officials of trying to derail cityhood
proposals by waiting until the end of a 30-day period to request a
review and then submitting an 18-page document challenging the
studies.</TE>
<TE>   "This is another last-minute attempt by the city to prevent Valley
cityhood from going on the November ballot," Close said. "The city
and the mayor have no credibility on this issue with the public,
which sees this as a charade and mischief."</TE>
<TE>   The council voted unanimously to authorize Hahn, or another city
official if the mayor declines, to request that the controller review
comprehensive fiscal analyses done by LAFCO to help determine if the
cityhood proposals should be placed on the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn supports the concept of a state review, but wants to spend
the weekend examining the request drafted by the city attorney to
make sure it is on point and will not cause delays that would prevent
the issue from going on the ballot this year, said Tim McOsker, the
mayor's chief of staff.</TE>
<TE>   "What we heard the city attorney say today is that it is necessary
in this process for the city to seek a review," McOsker said, adding
that Hahn "wants to makes sure, if the city makes this request, that
we can continue to stay on schedule to get this before the voters in
November."</TE>
<TE>   If the secession proposals are judged viable by LAFCO but do not
make the November ballot, state law requires that they to be put
before voters in 2005, when Hahn will be up for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   A decision on the review will be made by Hahn by the deadline
Monday, McOsker said.</TE>
<TE>   State law gives Controller Kathleen Connell 45 days to complete
the review, which she said is possible if the issues are not too
numerous or complicated.</TE>
<TE>   Because a 45-day review by the controller is built into the
schedule for making the Nov. 5 ballot deadline, LAFCO Executive
Director Larry Calemine said he does not expect the request to pose a
problem.</TE>
<TE>   Miscikowski said the controller's review could cause delays,
however, if the state recommends substantial changes in the LAFCO
financial studies.</TE>
<TE>   The city proposes to ask the controller to look at 19 suspected
errors or omissions in the LAFCO studies, including assertions that:</TE>
<TE>   * Projected reserve levels are too low, according to city
officials, and are likely to result in a decrease of services or an
increase in taxes.</TE>
<TE>   * The financial studies do not adequately analyze the effects on
the remainder of Los Angeles once the Valley stops contracting for
services in three years.</TE>
<TE>   * The studies fail to provide sufficient detail to prove that
service levels will be maintained in the new city.</TE>
<TE>   * Proposed alimony payments from the Valley to Los Angeles are
underestimated because there are centralized costs Los Angeles would
still have to pay after losing Valley revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council agreed to pay $50,000 in deposits to the
controller toward the cost of the Valley and harbor reviews, but the
examinations may end up costing the city $300,000 or more, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   The survey released Friday by KABC-TV found that 69% of Valley
residents felt they were getting less than their fair share of city
services and revenues, while 36% of residents citywide felt the
Valley was getting less than its fair share of services. Citywide,
51% felt public safety has improved in Los Angeles.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Three men were killed and a 70-year-old man injured in a head-on
collision early Friday on the Colorado Street Bridge in Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   According to Pasadena police, Robert Ellingson of Eagle Rock was
returning home from a night shift at the Postal Service's Processing
and Distribution Center in Pasadena when a Volkswagen traveling east
on the bridge crossed the center line on a curve and struck
Ellingson's Chevrolet Nova.</LD>
<LD>   The three occupants of the Volkswagen--driver Benjamin Jauregui,
26, Christopher Gardner, 25, and Albert Sanchez, 23--were killed. All
three were from Alhambra, police said.</LD>
<TE>   Ellingson was taken to Huntington Memorial Hospital, where he was
listed in fair condition after undergoing surgery on his mouth,
hospital officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital officials said Ellingson was being kept for observation
and is expected to be released in a few days.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the Volkswagen was traveling nearly 50 mph in a 35-mph
zone.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Rod Uyeda of the city's traffic division said drugs and
alcohol did not appear to be factors in the accident, but that police
were awaiting autopsy and toxicology reports.</TE>
<TE>   The two-lane, 150-foot-high bridge has long been a scene of death.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to traffic fatalities, more than 100 people have
jumped to their deaths from the bridge since it was built in 1913.</TE>

<HD>Holding of Afghan Fighters Challenged</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A coalition of Los Angeles clergy, lawyers and academics argued
Friday that U.S. federal courts have authority over the 188 Afghan
fighters held captive at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba.</LD>
<LD>   In a legal brief filed in Los Angeles federal court, the coalition
also disputed government claims that the group has no standing to
bring a lawsuit on behalf of the detainees.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge A. Howard Matz will hear arguments Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   The ad hoc coalition, organized by civil rights lawyer Stephen
Yagman, filed suit Jan. 20, demanding that the detainees be brought
before a civilian court in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The coalition contends that the men are being held in violation of
the Geneva Convention and the U.S. Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the White House announced that Taliban fighters being
held at Guantanamo will be protected under the Geneva Convention but
will not be classified as prisoners of war. Al Qaeda captives will
neither be protected by the convention nor considered POWs.</TE>
<TE>   Legal sources said Friday that the administration's announcement
is not likely to have any immediate impact on the case before Matz.</TE>
<TE>   At present, the only issues before him are the coalition's right
to sue and the court's jurisdiction. At a hearing last month, the Los
Angeles jurist expressed doubts about his authority to intervene.
Nevertheless, he directed both sides to file briefs on the issues.</TE>
<TE>   In a brief last week, government attorneys cited a 1950 U.S.
Supreme Court decision involving German nationals seized at the end
of World War II and taken to an American-run prison in occupied
Germany.</TE>
<TE>   The court held that the prisoners could not file habeas corpus
petitions in U.S. courts because they were captured and at all times
held outside U.S. sovereign territory.</TE>
<TE>   In the current case, the government argued that Cuba retained
sovereignty to Guantanamo when it leased the base to the United
States in perpetuity in 1903.</TE>
<TE>   The coalition disagreed in its response Friday. "As a matter of
internationally known fact," Yagman wrote, "it is the United States
of America, with its finger stuck in the eye of President Fidel
Castro of Cuba, who exercises complete control, both de facto and de
jure, over the Cuban geography."</TE>
<TE>   The group also took issue with the government's argument that the
coalition had no right to file suit on behalf of the detainees
because it has no personal connections with any of them. The group
said the habeas corpus statute allows for third-party intervention in
cases like this one.</TE>
<TE>   Laced with quotes from Shakespeare and Mick Jagger, the brief
attacked what it described as America's "war mongering, macho and
swaggering government."</TE>

<HD>Girl, 4, Dies in Hit-Run</HD>
<DH>Accident: L.A. man is arrested after victim is dragged to
her death. Four others are hurt.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Police are holding a Los Angeles man on suspicion of manslaughter
after a speeding car struck a 4-year-old girl, dragging her several
feet to her death.</LD>
<LD>   The child, identified as Hannah Stallings by relatives, was
standing in an alley behind her home in the 1100 block of West 57th
Street in South-Central Los Angeles about 6:30 p.m. Thursday when a
Ford Escort drove through at 35 mph to 50 mph, police and witnesses
said.</LD>
<LD>   Hannah, her mother and some family friends were waiting for her
stepfather to back the family car out of the garage when the Escort
hit Hannah, her 31-year-old mother, Annie Hamilton, and three
teenagers.</LD>
<TE>   None of the adults or older children were badly injured
or required hospitalization. But Hannah died a short time later at
Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   One of the teenagers, Fernando Tenorio, 16, tried to get Hannah
out of the way. "I tried to reach for her, but by that time, the car
had already hit me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The driver continued down the alley and drove to a home at the end
of the block, police and witnesses said. Hannah's body ended up near
an alley wall.</TE>
<TE>   Several witness described the heart-wrenching events that
followed.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors and family members ran to the house where the driver had
entered and started banging on his door. He wouldn't come out, but a
short time later, police arrested 32-year-old Houstis Maddox on
suspicion of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated.</TE>
<TE>   Police first suspected he was drunk, but later found him to be
under the influence of central nervous system depressants, drugs
usually prescribed to calm people's nerves, said Det. Scott Sherman.</TE>
<TE>   Maddox had been accompanied by two young cousins, Jahlena Perkins,
9, and Keith Gordon, 5. Their mother let them stay home from school
Friday because they were so disturbed by what they had seen.</TE>
<TE>   Jahlena said she had nightmares about her playmate's death.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't sleep because [she] was one of my friends," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Jo Hamilton, Hannah's grandmother, described her as an
outgoing, friendly child who would smile at just about anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Hannah's mother decided to donate her daughter's organs and eyes,
Hamilton said.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe Hannah can live, to a degree," she said, "through some
other kids."</TE>

<HD>Gang Expert Hanging Up His Spurs</HD>
<DH>Crime: Wes McBride learned to treat offenders as human
beings, saying root causes like poverty are hard to eradicate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wes McBride spent the last 28 years learning everything there is to
know about gangs and then sharing it with other law enforcement
officers.</LD>
<LD>   He picked up details about the lives of thugs and killers. He kept
track of youths struggling to save themselves from the street life.
He pioneered a system used statewide to monitor gang activity. He
even co-wrote a book on gangs often used by investigators and
educators.</LD>
<LD>   McBride, who retired as a sergeant last week after more than 35
years with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, left with an
international reputation for gang expertise.</LD>
<TE>   "There are thousands of gang members, and only hundreds of them
are killers. That may sound facetious, but I'm saying: Not all gang
members are evil creatures," McBride said in an interview. "You have
to understand them if you're going to work with them."</TE>
<TE>   McBride, 60, joined the Sheriff's Department in the 1960s after
serving in Vietnam with the Marines. He worked various assignments
during his early years with the department.</TE>
<TE>   In 1973, he became one of four deputies in the county assigned to
focus on gangs.</TE>
<TE>   "I walked into a world of violence and murder," McBride said. "I
had to learn gangs."</TE>
<TE>   His views evolved from seeing members as "thugs who should all be
arrested" to believing that they are part of a community and should
be approached as human beings, above all else.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of them are there by circumstances," he said, referring to
the challenges of poverty and other issues.</TE>
<TE>   But McBride also recognized the need to gather gang intelligence
and began a gang log used by sheriff's stations, said Sgt. Steve
Newman.</TE>
<TE>   The log evolved into a tracking system called the Integrated Gang
Information System. He later helped design and implement the Gang
Reporting Evaluation and Tracking system, used across California. In
turn, that system was the model for the state's current gang-tracking
system, Cal-Gangs, Newman said.</TE>
<TE>   McBride also helped form the California Gang Investigators Assn.,
which he serves as president, and the National Alliance of Gang
Investigators, to encourage sharing of information regarding gang
migration.</TE>
<TE>   "He is the godfather of everything we're doing, the guru, the
impetus," said Wes Daily, a detective in New York's Suffolk County
Police Department, who is president of the East Coast Gang
Investigators Assn. and the National Alliance of Gang Investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Nalian, a gang detective in the West Covina Police Department,
said McBride earned such respect and praise through his hard work.</TE>
<TE>   "He was tireless, always tracking [gangs]," Nalian said. "He's
known nationwide because of his efforts."</TE>
<TE>   McBride worked diligently to understand gang members' lives, to
"walk in their shoes," said Sheriff's Capt. Willie Miller. His
approach caught gang members off guard, and often made them more open
to giving up information, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "His people skills, I think, helped him tremendously," Miller
said.</TE>
<TE>   Even with a jovial and laid-back personality, McBride nonetheless
arrested hundreds of gang members during his career. His easygoing
nature let him learn of dangerous activities occurring within gangs.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time anyone had any question about gangs, he was the man to
go to," said Lt. Mike Ford, who works in the Safe Streets program,
the department's anti-gang operation. "He could recite how they
operated, their financial status, their M.O., everything. Even on
specific gang members. It was always very impressive to me."</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, the U.S. State Department sent McBride to South Africa to
provide recommendations on how that country could deal with violent
street gangs. He traveled to Japan in 1998 to instruct law
enforcement personnel in gang awareness.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a pleasant voice that would tell people the truth," said
Sheriff's Lt. Bob Rifkin. "He was never afraid to voice his opinion
if he felt it would make people aware."</TE>
<TE>   Miller said the department has more than 200 officers dedicated to
addressing gang problems. There are an estimated 95,765 members of
about 1,300 gangs in Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Department officials acknowledge that crimes committed by gang
members remain a serious problem. There were 520 gang-related deaths
in the county in 2000, according to Sheriff's Department statistics.
Figures for last year are not final, but the number of deaths is
expected to increase because of a recent wave of gang-related crimes,
Newman said.</TE>
<TE>   After all his efforts, McBride acknowledged that law enforcement
"may never catch up to the killings."</TE>
<TE>   "We don't solve the social conditions as a nation that tend to
create gangs," he said. "We don't solve illiteracy or poverty. How do
you make up for parents not caring for their kids? All we can do is
be there for the aftermath. There were gangs before me, and there
will be gangs after me. One person is not going to solve the
problem."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the time came for McBride to move on, if not
completely. In retirement, he plans to write another book about gangs
and continue to serve as a consultant on gang issues.</TE>
<TE>   McBride, who lives in Orange County, also said he wants to relax
and spend more time with his wife, Aileen.</TE>
<TE>   "We started a lot of programs. We saved a lot of kids. We put a
lot of bad guys in jail, and I'm proud of that," McBride said.</TE>
<TE>   "I just did what I could. Some programs worked, some didn't, but
you have to try."</TE>

<HD>Valley District Remap Being Rethought</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Redistricting Commission is considering changes to
the City Council district boundaries it has proposed for the San
Fernando Valley, to reduce fracturing of communities and avoid
tainting an election, officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   At the direction of commission Chairman John Emerson, the panel's
staff has begun developing optional plans, including putting 2nd
Council District candidates Wendy Greuel and Tony Cardenas, who face
off in a March 5 election, in the same new district.</LD>
<LD>   A draft map released last week would split the 2nd District in
two, with Greuel living in a district extending from Sunland-Tujunga
to Encino, and Cardenas living in a district extending from his home
in Panorama City to Sun Valley.</LD>
<TE>   Consequently, Greuel has campaigned in Sunland-Tujunga, telling
voters that Cardenas would not be their council member even if they
voted for him, but she would be if she won.</TE>
<TE>   Under last week's proposal, if Greuel won the election, she could
represent the new Valley district that includes Sunland-Tujunga, but
if Cardenas won, either Cindy Miscikowski or Ruth Galanter might
represent it.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed split has angered many voters in the district.</TE>
<TE>   "It's absolutely outrageous," said Nina Royal of the
Sunland-Tujunga Neighborhood Council. "It totally confuses the
voters." Emerson said Friday that he would propose a new district
that included both candidates' homes, as well as Sunland-Tujunga.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal will be formally presented at a hearing Monday
evening in Woodland Hills.</TE>

<HD>BofA Settles Suits by Shareholders</HD>
<DH>Courts: Bank was accused of playing down losses before
merger with NationsBank. It will pay $490 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a huge settlement influenced by Enron Corp.'s meltdown, Bank of
America Corp. said Friday that it would pay $490 million to put to
rest claims that it misled shareholders before its 1998 merger with
NationsBank Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The Charlotte, N.C., company, the nation's third-largest bank,
said it had set aside reserves for the settlement so future results
would not be affected. It admitted no wrongdoing.</LD>
<LD>   Within weeks of the takeover of San Francisco's BankAmerica Corp.
by Charlotte's NationsBank, the new institution announced losses of
$372 million on what it described as a $1.4-billion unsecured loan
made in 1997 to D.E. Shaw &amp; Co., a New York hedge fund.</LD>
<TE>   The suits, filed on behalf of shareholders whose stock holdings
plunged after the disclosure, contended executives played down the
banks' exposure to losses from the volatile fund in order to keep the
merger on track. They also claimed that NationsBank failed to
investigate the deal sufficiently and that BankAmerica failed to
disclose the deal was an acquisition, not a merger of equals.</TE>
<TE>   The losses from Shaw contributed to the departure of David
Coulter, chairman of the old BankAmerica, who some had considered to
be a possible successor to Hugh McColl, then-chairman of the old
NationsBank.</TE>
<TE>   "While we believed our actions in 1998 were totally appropriate,
we also felt it was best to get this litigation behind us," Bank of
America's chief executive, Ken Lewis, said in a statement Friday. He
cited the "inordinate amount of management's time" spent dealing with
class-action lawsuits filed by shareholders of both banks.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Stickler, a Bank of America spokesman, also cited another
"driving factor" in the decision to settle: the fallout from Enron.</TE>
<TE>   As the bank looked toward the April date for trial, Stickler said,
"the atmosphere ... was not conducive to corporations."</TE>
<TE>   The $490 million to be paid by Bank of America ranks in the top 10
of amounts to settle such shareholder class-action suits, said John
C. Coffee, a Columbia University professor of securities law.</TE>
<TE>   Coffee said the fiasco involving Enron, which hid large debts and
losses in partnerships while executives earned millions of dollars on
stock options, had "at least marginally changed the balance of
advantage in securities litigation."</TE>
<TE>   Because of Enron, juries are more inclined to favor plaintiffs in
such cases, "particularly in a case involving financial or accounting
irregularities," Coffee said.</TE>
<TE>   Bank of America last year settled Securities and Exchange
Commission charges that it improperly accounted for its relationship
with the hedge fund and failed to adequately inform investors about
the risks of the deal. The SEC said the bank had made an equity
investment in the fund that it treated as a loan.</TE>
<TE>   The bank, without admitting or denying guilt, consented to an SEC
cease and desist order but was not fined.</TE>
<TE>   Under the terms of the settlement, $333.2 million will go to
former NationsBank shareholders and $156.8 million to former
BankAmerica shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   The bank's shares rose $1.65 to close at $60.60 on Friday on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Creditors Group Seeks Right to Probe Enron Partnerships</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A group of Enron Corp. creditors is seeking the right to conduct an
official probe of the murky partnerships that helped plunge the
company into its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.</LD>
<LD>   The creditors committee asked a federal judge late Thursday for
permission to issue subpoenas to some of the former Enron employees
and outside consulting firms that helped to set up and run the
partnerships.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez granted a similar
request Tuesday when he gave the creditors permission to subpoena
records from the Andersen accounting firm, Enron's former auditor,
and to interview Andersen executives.</LD>
<TE>   The 15-member Enron creditor committee, which primarily comprises
large banks and other institutions, is paving the way for potential
lawsuits against third parties that did business with Enron, experts
said.</TE>
<TE>   Given that they expect to recover from Enron only a portion of
what is owed them, the creditors may fare better in targeting
deep-pocketed law firms, consultants and others that advised the
company on its deals.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to try to unravel these transactions and find out
who knew what," said Richard Tilton, a New York bankruptcy attorney
who is not involved in the case. "The ultimate goal is to find
somebody who is responsible for damages because they didn't advise
Enron properly."</TE>
<TE>   The ability to conduct its own investigation also would help the
committee determine whether the partnerships still are causing a
financial drain on the company, experts said. Some of the
partnerships paid out millions of dollars to Enron officers in recent
years.</TE>
<TE>   The committee, led by such lenders as Citigroup Inc. and J.P.
Morgan Chase &amp; Co., is seeking records of about 50 Enron
partnerships, including the controversial LJM, Raptor and Chewco
entities.</TE>
<TE>   The partnerships, which engaged in various transactions with
Enron, were used by the energy trader to inflate profits and hide
much of the mountain of debt the company was taking on, a report
issued last weekend by a panel of Enron directors concluded.</TE>
<TE>   "The committee unquestionably needs discovery regarding the
business purpose, organization and financial structure, legal
obligations, valuations and other critical data regarding those
entities," the committee said in its court filing.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the committee did not return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   The creditors seek information from three law firms--Vinson &amp;
Elkins; Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson; and Kirkland &amp;
Ellis--management consultant McKinsey &amp; Co. and accounting firm
PricewaterhouseCoopers.</TE>
<TE>   Creditors also want to question seven former Enron executives.
They include Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former chief executive; Andrew
S. Fastow, the onetime chief financial officer who was deeply
involved in the partnerships; and Michael Kopper, a managing director
who reported to Fastow.</TE>
<TE>   But the paper records involved in the transactions may be more
important, some experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "You absolutely want the documents because you'll probably learn
more from the documents than from the people themselves," said
Tilton, the bankruptcy lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   The committee request follows the release a week ago of the
internal Enron report detailing extensive problems with several
partnerships and outlining the questionable roles of several company
executives in structuring and operating them. Fastow earned at least
$30 million from the partnerships, and Kopper pocketed more than $10
million, the report said.</TE>

<HD>Senator Says He Expects Lay to Testify Before Committee</HD>
<DH>Probe: A House inquiry is expanded to include the role of
two Wall Street banks in the energy firm's collapse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS and RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The chairman of a Senate committee investigating Enron's collapse
said Friday that he expects Kenneth L. Lay to testify next week,
although a Lay spokeswoman said the ousted Enron Corp. chairman was
still weighing a decision.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, lawmakers said they are expanding their inquiry to
include the role played by at least two Wall Street banks in Enron's
collapse. The banks invested in some of Enron's off-the-books
partnerships, apparently in the hope Enron would return the favor by
sending other business their way.</LD>
<LD>   Lay was scheduled to speak voluntarily to the Senate Commerce
Committee this week, but canceled his appearance because of what his
lawyers called the "prosecutorial" comments of lawmakers on the eve
of his appearance.</LD>
<TE>   Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.), chair of the Senate Commerce
subcommittee on consumer affairs, said he expects Lay to testify
because his attorneys have not notified the committee of any plan to
assert Lay's 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination. The full
Commerce Committee subpoenaed Lay to appear Tuesday after he canceled
his voluntary appearance.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally they would have done that by now," Dorgan said. "We told
Lay's attorney Friday that we are preparing for a hearing in which
Lay will answer questions and they said, 'We can't disagree.'</TE>
<TE>   "This will be an opportunity for Mr. Lay to tell his side of the
story," Dorgan said. "The committee wants to hear from him and the
country wants to hear from him."</TE>
<TE>   But spokeswoman Kelly Kimberly said Lay had not made up his mind.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an important decision," Kimberly said. "He's weighing it
very carefully."</TE>
<TE>   If he testifies, Lay faces a political and legal quagmire, experts
say. Many criminal attorneys agree that it's in Lay's best interest
to refuse to testify until it is known whether he is a target of the
criminal probe.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, refusing to testify could bring a flurry of
criticism--particularly after his right-hand man, former Chief
Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling, appeared before committee members
Thursday and denied any responsibility for the company's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   That could put pressure on Lay to testify to salvage his
reputation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very difficult to control high-profile clients like this,"
said Joseph diGenova, a former prosecutor and a partner at diGenova &amp;
Toensing in Washington. "They think they can talk their way out of
everything. They overestimate their powers of persuasion and
underestimate their Darth Vader qualities."</TE>
<TE>   He and other Washington attorneys said it was likely that Lay's
attorney, Earl Silbert, was recommending that his client take the
Fifth.</TE>
<TE>   "There are almost no pros for Ken Lay's giving testimony," said
Stephen Ryan, a lawyer with the Washington office of Manatt, Phelps &amp;
Phillips and a former general counsel for the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "Ken Lay should no longer be worried about the court of public
opinion; he has to be worried about the court of criminal law," Ryan
said. When Lay faces the committee--and the cameras--Tuesday, it's
unlikely that he'll have the option of answering some questions and
rejecting others.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you start testifying, it's hard to stop," said Dan Rinzel, a
former congressional investigator and now an attorney at Redmon,
Peyton &amp; Braswell. "If you open up the door and start answering
questions, you way waive your rights and it's too late."</TE>
<TE>   Also on the schedule to testify Tuesday is William C. Powers, who
led a special internal investigating team that accused Lay of failing
to fulfill his oversight duties.</TE>
<TE>   Motives of Investors in Question</TE>
<TE>   Another congressional committee said Friday that it plans to
expand its probe to include Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Wachovia Bank and
other financial institutions that invested in some of the
controversial Enron partnerships despite being warned about potential
conflicts. Officials at Merrill and Wachovia invested in LJM2, one of
the partnerships controlled by fired Enron Chief Financial Officer
Andrew S. Fastow.</TE>
<TE>   Both firms said they were told that they would receive a bigger
piece of Enron's bond business if they invested in the partnerships,
congressional investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to know if they were aware that they were engaging in
transactions that were off the books, and therefore deceitful," said
Rep. James Greenwood (R-Pa.), chair of the House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee on oversight and investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch spokesman Joe Cohen defended the company's
involvement in the LJM2 partnership.</TE>
<TE>   "Our dealings with Enron were proper," Cohen said. "Like every
major Wall Street firm, we did Enron-related business, including one
investment in a single partnership."</TE>
<TE>   Merrill helped raise about $350 million for the partnership from
institutions and wealthy individuals, including $16 million from
Merrill executives and $5 million from the firm itself. Officials at
Wachovia did not return a phone call Friday seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Dorgan, who has been attempting to obtain a list of all investors
in the various partnerships, said he discussed the issue Friday with
the company's interim CEO, Steve Copper, and was assured that Copper
would attempt to turn over the partnership documents.</TE>
<TE>   "He indicated that he was looking for the same information,"
Dorgan said.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, Enron attorneys had refused to turn over the records
or said they did not have them.</TE>
<TE>   Dorgan's committee also plans to hear soon from Sherron S.
Watkins, the Enron vice president who warned Lay about the company's
accounting problems in a memo in August.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony from other mid-level Enron employees is likely,
investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, said one of the first things investigators need to do is
"retrace our steps and corroborate some of the testimony that was
given before the committee."</TE>
<TE>   For instance, he said the committee would search for other Enron
employees who might know about attempts by Enron attorney Jordan
Mintz to obtain Skilling's signature on an approval sheet for one of
the off-the-books partnerships. Mintz testified that he tried three
times to meet with Skilling, but Skilling said he did not recall such
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Schiliro, chief of staff to Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los
Angeles), a senior member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee,
said, "There's a long way to go before we understand this."</TE>
<TE>   Seeking Ouster of Retirement-Plan Trustee</TE>
<TE>   Given that a number of key players have invoked their 5th
Amendment right against self-incrimination, he said it is more
important for investigators to talk to other insiders in the company
"so we can put all the pieces together."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), top Democrat on the
House Education and Workforce Committee, called on Labor Secretary
Elaine Chao to remove Cindy Olson as a trustee of Enron's 401(k)
plan, contending that she failed to act to protect the retirement
funds after being warned about the company's financial peril.
Employee retirement funds were invested in Enron stock, which
plummeted months after the warnings were first raised.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, I was shocked by Ms. Olson's testimony and was
immediately concerned for the thousands of employees at Enron who
still have investments in the Enron pension plan," Miller said. "I am
urging Secretary Chao to act immediately to remove Ms. Olson and
others who failed to meet their legal obligations to protect the
retirement investments of Enron employees."</TE>
<TE>   Olson could not immediately be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Eli Gottesdiener, whose firm sued Enron in November over
the 401(k) losses, said Friday that Olson failed in her duty to
protect plan participants. Gottesdiener said he and other lawyers for
employees would ask Federal District Judge Melinda Harmon to remove
all Enron executives as trustees from the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, questioned about
published reports that the Pentagon was among other federal agencies
asked last week to preserve Enron-related documents, said that
complying with such a request would "be a perfectly proper,
responsible thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   However, Rumsfeld said he had not seen such a request and did not
know of any specific defense records relating to Enron that would be
helpful to the investigation.</TE>

<HD>Not All Sports Cash In on the Olympics</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Ice rinks brace for Games- inspired onslaught,
but ski gear makers don't expect any sales spike.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Winter Olympics will spark new business for ice rink operators,
but NBC's broadcast of the Salt Lake City Games is unlikely to do
much for ski equipment makers and ski resorts, whose season already
is half over.</LD>
<LD>   The ice-skating industry is ready for rink rapture, the phenomenon
that occurs every four years as Olympic hopefuls file into rinks to
chase dreams of becoming graceful figure skaters and hard-charging
hockey players.</LD>
<LD>   But more than 300 hours of telecasts on the NBC, MSNBC and CNBC
networks during coming days won't generate a corresponding flurry of
business for winter resorts and manufacturers of skis and snowboards.</LD>
<TE>   NBC's broadcasts will be welcomed, but "we don't hang lot of hope
on the Olympics yet," said Dave Schmidt, vice president of global
sales at Burton Snowboard Co. in Burlington, Vt. "They're clearly not
a primary marketing tool for us."</TE>
<TE>   Coverage of the Olympics is a boon for ice rinks because skating
has evolved into an indoor sport with a season that never ends. Rinks
typically are nearby and the year-round parade of made-for-television
figure skating specials helps to keep Olympic-sized dreams alive.</TE>
<TE>   Gracielle Tan's love affair with figure skating was sparked by
coverage of the 1994 Winter Games in Lillehammer, Norway. Her affair
was solidified four years later when Tara Lipinski won the gold medal
in Nagano, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Monday through Saturday, the school girl who just turned 13
travels from Chino Hills to Disney Ice in Anaheim for early-morning
lessons. Gracielle's mother initially steered her daughter into a
nearby gymnastics program. Then she arranged for dance classes.
Gracielle, though, held firm.</TE>
<TE>   "She really was persistent, so I found a rink in Irvine where she
could take group lessons," said Grace Tan. "Now she wakes up at 4:30
a.m. every day but Sunday, when she wakes up a little later and goes
to a 10 a.m. lesson."</TE>
<TE>   The Dallas-based Ice Skating Institute trade group recently sent
out a quadrennial advisory that urges rink operators to prepare for
the "enthusiastic rebirth of interest in ice sports that only occurs
once every four years."</TE>
<TE>   The key elements of rink operators' battle plans are decidedly
simple: sharpen blades, replace broken laces and keep restrooms
clean.</TE>
<TE>   The prime directive, though, is to ensure that there's plenty of
open skating sessions and pick-up hockey games available so newcomers
don't lose their Olympic glow.</TE>
<TE>   The influx of new skaters means "some inconvenience, to be sure,
for existing skaters," said Patti Feeney, director of member programs
and services for the Ice Skating Institute. "But this is our chance
to get new customers, and if we treat them right, they'll be
customers for life."</TE>
<TE>   The ski industry would love to see ski lifts jammed with people as
dedicated as Gracielle Tan.</TE>
<TE>   A decade ago, 30% of Americans who headed into the mountains
during the winter were classified as hard-core skiers. "Now that
figure's probably down to 15% to 18% who will ski come hell or high
water," said market researcher Jim Spring of Denver. "The rest are
fair-weather skiers."</TE>
<TE>   The cooling market for winter sporting goods and apparel has been
reignited in recent years by the dramatic surge in the popularity of
snowboarding.</TE>
<TE>   Between August and the end of November, the first half of the
sales season, sales of equipment, accessories and apparel used by
skiers and snowboarders fell by 1.4% from the same period in 2000, to
$632 million, according to SnowSports Industries America, a McLean,
Va.-based trade group. That's not bad during a recession.</TE>
<TE>   But break apart the overall sales and a clearer picture emerges.</TE>
<TE>   Snowboard sales rose by 14.8% during the first half of this winter
season.</TE>
<TE>   Cross-country ski sales jumped by 24.5%, an increase that industry
observers tie to people who are seeking peace and quiet in the wake
of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, sales of Alpine, or downhill, ski equipment continued
a years-long slide, with a 4.8% dip during the first half of the
season. Sales of Alpine skis hit $241 million last season, up from
$208 million five years earlier. But although dollar volume increased
on the strength of increasingly expensive equipment, unit sales were
disappointing.</TE>
<TE>   Ski manufacturers are trying to spark interest with double-tipped
skis that let skiers perform edgy tricks. They're also introducing
short skis and fat skis that will give skiers better control.</TE>
<TE>   But new products alone are insufficient. The ski industry also
needs new skiers. The mean age of skiers drifted up from 33 years to
just under 37 during the past decade, according to Spring, president
of Leisure Trends Group, which tracks participation in outdoor
sports.</TE>
<TE>   Young people who head for the hills in the winter are increasingly
likely to be carrying snowboards. During the 2000-01 ski season,
Spring said, half of people under 16 were using snowboards, not skis.</TE>
<TE>   The ski industry has struggled to convert fan interest generated
by Olympic broadcasts. A solid percentage of viewers who watched the
1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan, were willing to give the sport a
try, "but they didn't have the slightest idea of what to do next,"
Spring said. "These can be very intimidating sports for newcomers."</TE>
<TE>   Prior to the Nagano Games, SnowSports Industries America offered
retailers a marketing program designed to lure beginners and veterans
into stores to chat with knowledgeable professionals while watching
the ski and snowboard contests on television.</TE>
<TE>   ''I can count on two hands the number of takers we had,'' said
Mary Jo Tarallo, the group's director of communications.</TE>
<TE>   The Winter Games don't easily lend themselves to advertising
campaigns because the broadcasts come well into the ski season, while
ski equipment and apparel sales occur largely between August and
December. So by the time the Winter Games are held, sporting goods
stores are in the midst of staging winter clearance sales to make
room for spring and summer gear.</TE>
<TE>   Equipment manufacturers continue their decades-long practice of
outfitting top athletes with equipment and apparel in a bid to build
brand loyalty.</TE>
<TE>   The tactic works with adoring fans who are willing to spend top
dollar for the best equipment. But Spring doubts that a gold medal
performance will persuade most newcomers to invest in expensive ski
gear.</TE>
<TE>   And, though aging downhill racers willingly follow in the tracks
of Olympic heroes, snowboarders generally look elsewhere for their
cues. The X Games broadcasts on ESPN, as well as photos in extreme
sports magazines and action incorporated into videos, carry more
weight than Olympic gold.</TE>
<TE>   The snowboard industry does welcome the added attention the sport
will gain. But even if younger viewers flock to the broadcasts, "from
a sales point of view, the Olympics aren't very well timed,"
snowboard seller Schmidt said. "I don't expect any immediate upturn
at retail but you probably will see an upturn in participation next
season."</TE>

<HD>Judge Clears Way for Dam to Go Up, Trees to Come Down</HD>
<DH>Thousand Oaks: The decision on the Lang Ranch structure
angers preservationists, who vow to fight on.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The trees will come down and the dam will be built.</LD>
<LD>   That was a Ventura County judge's decision Friday in a bitter feud
between Thousand Oaks homeowners and the county over a controversial
dam that will be built in their upscale neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Thomas J. Hutchins' decision effectively
clears the way for the county's Flood Control District to cut down 40
aging trees and start construction of the dam in the Lang Ranch
subdivision.</LD>
<TE>   After reading separate scientific studies of the area conducted by
geologists hired by homeowners and the Ventura County Flood Control
District, Hutchins rejected a request for a preliminary injunction,
nullifying his earlier temporary restraining order.</TE>
<TE>   "These trees will be removed in any event, so why delay the
inevitable?" Hutchins asked while explaining his ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Hutchins said he was not swayed by arguments that constructing a
dam in a neighborhood of million-dollar homes would pose a
significant safety risk to residents from mudslides.</TE>
<TE>   The judge also rejected an assertion by the homeowners' group,
Save Lang Oaks Fund, that the project's 1995 environmental assessment
was incomplete, saying there was no evidence that the original study
did not "fully consider the environmental impact of removing the
trees."</TE>
<TE>   Though frustrated by the ruling, dam opponents said they will
continue to fight the project.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed, but this isn't over yet," said clinical
psychologist Gerry Langer, director of the homeowners group. "It's
going to be a hideous project that will be a blight on the
neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   The next move is uncertain said the group's attorney, Alyse Lazar.
She would not rule out filing an appeal as early as Monday, and also
said the group will continue to pursue a separate lawsuit designed to
scuttle the $5-million dam project.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Murphy, assistant county counsel, said removal of the
trees' limbs would begin soon to prevent the nesting of birds this
spring.</TE>
<TE>   It's expected to take six months to build the dam--a 66
1/2-foot-high embankment with a detention basin the size of four
football fields. Officials with the Ventura County Flood Control
District have said the dam is needed to protect the Conejo Valley
from devastating flooding in the event of a 100-year storm.</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks City Councilwoman Linda Parks, a vocal opponent of
the project, said the ruling signifies "a very sad day for our city."</TE>
<TE>   "We are losing a prize oak grove and habitat and there is less of
it all the time," said Parks.</TE>

<HD>Irvine to Ask Landowners to OK Higher Tax</HD>
<DH>Economy: City says it can't keep up with maintenance.
Strain is felt in municipalities throughout the state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Worried the state will dip into local tax dollars to balance its
budget, Irvine officials will ask residents to nearly double a parcel
tax to keep the city's parks pretty, sidewalks smooth and streets
well-lighted.</LD>
<LD>   The question will be posed this month, when the city mails ballots
to about 60,000 landowners, who will have until April 9 to decide
whether to increase the property assessments. Irvine is among a
growing number of cities that fund some costs through assessment
districts and now--with the economy battered and the state
considering a raid on local taxes--are poised to ask residents for a
helping hand.</LD>
<LD>   City officials say the tax increase is necessary if Irvine hopes
to keep its well-manicured look. But some residents say the
assessment, which shows up on property tax bills, is a form of double
taxation because they pay property taxes for such maintenance.
Further, almost two-thirds of Irvine residents pay fees to homeowners
associations to cover similar expenses within their neighborhoods.</LD>
<TE>   Eunice Cluck and fellow tax fighters--mostly members of a group
formed in 1999 that successfully fought a school tax--have launched a
campaign to defeat the proposed increase.</TE>
<TE>   City officials say landscaping, park maintenance and street
lighting costs have shot up over the last five years because of the
city's growth and higher energy prices. Next year, they estimate, the
bill could approach $7 million--more than double what it was in 1997
when the parcel tax was approved.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a couple of years when we were in a boom phase--the
economy was strong and we were able to complete a lot of work on
parks and other projects," said Kathleen Rafferty, manager of fiscal
services for Irvine. "But in an economic downturn, there is no
guarantee that we'll have the money to continue subsidizing these
costs from the general fund."</TE>
<TE>   Cities throughout the state are in the same pinch, uncertain
whether to cut costs and delay projects or turn to voters for more
revenue, said Megan Taylor, a spokeswoman for the League of
California Cities. "Cities all over the state are looking at what
they need to do to balance their budgets," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Seal Beach, for instance, is considering a special assessment
district to cover the cost of fighting storm-water pollution, said
City Manager John B. Bahorski</TE>
<TE>   But in recent years, Orange County voters have been reluctant to
pass special taxes. In November, Seal Beach property owners voted
down a proposal to raise the per-parcel levy for street sweeping and
tree trimming from 50 cents to $1.46. Irvine property owners twice
rejected a special tax to preserve school programs.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine City Council will discuss the proposed fees Tuesday. A
public hearing is set April 9, and ballots must be returned by the
close of the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Marilyn Vassos, a 35-year resident, said she sees no choice but to
support the tax hike.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you have to pay for what you get," said Vassos, who
lives in University Park and pays homeowners association dues.
"People are always saying Irvine is so pretty. Well, people are going
to have to decide whether they want it to continue to look so
pretty."</TE>

officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The officials are advising residents to be aware of the risks of
infection. People can inhale the virus when droppings or nests in
dust and dirt are disturbed. The virus causes flu-like symptoms. A
wood rat and deer mouse found Oct. 24 in Redlands and a deer mouse
caught in Rialto tested positive.</LD>

<LD>The number of passengers and flights at John Wayne Airport inched
ever closer to normal in the fifth month since the terrorist attacks,
but remained about 3% lower than last year, according to a report
released Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Airport officials said they are encouraged by the small but steady
strides that have been made since the Sept. 11 hijackings left many
passengers nationwide afraid to fly. The number of passengers passing
through the airport plunged by about one-third in September.</LD>
<LD>   Like other small, regional airports, John Wayne is faring better
than larger counterparts such as Los Angeles International, where
increased security measures are more cumbersome and less appealing to
passengers.</LD>

<HD>Skilling Given Low Marks for Leadership</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling's testimony that he
was unaware of the company's financial distress defies belief and
flies in the face of bedrock tenets of corporate leadership, many
executives and management experts said.</LD>
<LD>   Skilling swore to a congressional committee Thursday that he "was
not aware of any financing arrangements designed to conceal
liabilities or inflate profitability" when he resigned from Enron on
Aug.14, shortly before the company started to unravel.</LD>
<LD>   It will be up to others to decide whether Skilling broke any laws,
but taking that story to Capitol Hill convicted him in the court of
common sense, management experts said Friday.</LD>
<TE>   "He was a completely incompetent CEO if he didn't know," said
Larraine Segil, a Century City-based management consultant and
author. "What you're talking about here is either a blatant untruth,
or it is evidence of something very smelly at the top of that
organization."</TE>
<TE>   In an era when the highest form of flattery a CEO can hear is a
favorable comparison to Jack Welch, who recently retired as the very
hands-on head of General Electric Co., the ignorance Skilling
expressed about Enron's impending financial disaster struck experts
as all the more remarkable.</TE>
<TE>   "We look at Jack Welch and say, 'This is what we expect from a
corporate executive, not a micro-manager but hands-on,'" said Lois P.
Frankel, president of Pasadena-based Corporate Coaching
International. "Jack Welch had a broad vision for what he wanted GE
to become. He empowered people to go out and make it happen--and he
held them accountable.''</TE>
<TE>   If all Skilling failed to do was to hold his lieutenants
accountable, he still violated a cardinal corporate rule, Frankel
said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a saying in management: 'What you were responsible for
before you delegated it, you are responsible for after you delegated
it,'" she said. "You can't say you don't know anything about it.
That's a fundamental breach of your management responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   Corporate coach Stephen Xavier said he was flabbergasted by
Skilling's testimony.</TE>
<TE>   "If he truly didn't know, shame on him as a CEO because it's his
job to know," said Xavier, managing partner of Thousand Oaks-based
Cornerstone Executive Development Group.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling, 48, has been portrayed as a pivotal figure in Enron's
transformation from a natural gas pipeline operator to a pioneering
energy trader. In doing so, he espoused what has been described as a
fast-paced, freewheeling entrepreneurism.</TE>
<TE>   But having a corporate vision is not enough, executives said.
Former President Reagan, Apple Computer Inc.'s Steve Jobs and
Microsoft Corp.'s Bill Gates are noted for their visions, but each
surrounded himself with top-notch deputies, kept a close eye on the
bottom line or did both.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a visionary-type person myself, but I make darn sure there is
a CFO sitting right next to me who, if there is any problem, I trust
to march into my office and say, 'There is a problem,'" said David
Friend, CEO of Boston-based Sonexis Inc. "I know I'm ultimately
responsible to my stockholders. 'I'm off giving speeches somewhere
and didn't know what was going on' is not going to cut it."</TE>
<TE>   Skilling told Fortune magazine in April that he couldn't wait for
Enron to move into an as-yet- unfinished tower across the street from
its downtown Houston headquarters so that he could have an office
near the trading floor.</TE>
<TE>   The former CEO lamented being in the executive suites on the top
floor of a 50-story high-rise, where he said he felt out of touch
with the rank and file.</TE>
<TE>   But it doesn't take an MBA to figure out how to talk to employees.
One method known as "walk-around management" is just that: Executives
stroll and chat with employees throughout the company, from the shop
floor to the boardroom.</TE>
<TE>   Some CEOs invite employees to communicate directly with them by
unscreened e-mail or voicemail--simple mechanisms to discover
problems that their immediate subordinates might be reluctant to pass
on.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it's very hard for someone at mid-management level to
get the word up that it's not going to work," Frankel said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most infamous examples of bad news not getting through
the invisible barrier between people in the know and decision makers
was the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   "Why did the people at the top [of NASA] not know the O-rings had
a problem?" said USC management professor Ian Mitroff. "There were
memos. But they were blocked from reaching the top. The point is, a
colluding culture will block the messages from getting through.</TE>
<TE>   "That may have been what happened [at Enron], although instead of
blowing up a rocket, they blew up people's retirement funds," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Mitroff said it is possible Skilling was kept in the
dark, he said that assertion "strains the imagination."</TE>

<HD>U.S., China at Impasse Over Genetically Modified Crops</HD>
<DH>Trade: New Chinese rules requiring safety certification
could mean loss of billions of dollars to American farmers.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first major trade spat since China joined the World Trade
Organization heated up this week after U.S. officials failed to
resolve a dispute over new Chinese regulations on imports of
genetically modified crops that could trigger the loss of billions of
dollars in U.S. sales.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. farmers fear China is building a new wall of protectionist
hurdles to foreign goods now that it is being forced to lower tariffs
and open its market as a member of the Geneva-based WTO. China's farm
industry, which supports two-thirds of the population, is wary of
foreign competition.</LD>
<LD>   The two countries are feuding over Chinese rules that take effect
March 20 requiring imported crops and food ingredients to be
certified safe by the Chinese government. U.S. officials said the
Chinese have not yet spelled out what is "safe" and the U.S. wants
assurance that the rules will not halt the import of genetically
modified crops or food products.</LD>
<TE>   "China has not presented any science to support these
regulations," U.S. Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick and U.S.
Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman said in a joint statement. "The
result could be a halt in exports of farm products. That is an
unacceptable situation."</TE>
<TE>   Soybean producers, which exported $1 billion worth of their crop
to China last year, are particularly vulnerable to the Chinese
regulations because more than 70% of U.S. soybeans are genetically
modified. They worry that Chinese buyers concerned about the
uncertainty over the new regulations will choose domestic suppliers
or turn to Brazil, a major soybean producer that has a ban on
genetically modified seeds. U.S. corn and cotton exporters also could
be hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Callanan, a spokesman for the St. Louis-based American Soybean
Assn., believes the Chinese are uncomfortable with their increasing
dependence on foreign-grown soybeans and want to slow imports so
their farmers can become more competitive.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just a way to create a temporary trade barrier," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is particularly unhappy because the Chinese
assured President Bush last fall that they would accept U.S.
government safety certifications for agricultural products, Callanan
said. But in a meeting this week in Beijing, the Chinese stuck to
their requirement that products receive Chinese approval, a process
that could take months.</TE>
<TE>   Disappointed U.S. officials had hoped to resolve the issue before
Bush visits Beijing on Feb. 21.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. soybean farmers, anxious about keeping their largest foreign
customer happy, hope the matter can be resolved through negotiations
and that the U.S. will not be forced to file a WTO complaint.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't feel that [a complaint] would be in the best interest of
our growing relationship with the Chinese," Callanan said. "We would
rather convince them this is the right thing to do before it gets to
that point."</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas Lardy, author of the newly published book "Integrating
China Into the Global Economy," said China's action is not surprising
but may not be a violation of WTO rules. He pointed out that Europe
imposed a moratorium last year on imports of new varieties of
genetically modified organisms, prompting a threat of a WTO complaint
from the U.S. The handling of these GMOs is a hot topic in the newly
launched global trade talks that began last fall in Qatar.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Chinese protectionists may be taking a leaf out of the
European playbook," said Lardy, a Brookings Institution scholar. "But
what they're doing isn't even as egregious as what the Europeans are
doing."</TE>
<TE>   William Abnett, a Seattle-based China consultant, predicts the
issue will be a difficult one to resolve given the history of
disputes over a variety of health-related measures, including China's
ban on U.S. wood packaging, fresh potatoes, avocados and peaches.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope that [U.S] negotiators can work this out, but agriculture
issues are among the most controversial of all trade policies to
compromise on," he said.</TE>

<HD>Oil Slick Is Traced to Sunken Ship</HD>
<DH>Pollution: The substance that has killed birds in the Bay
Area for years leaks from fuel tanks of vessel that sank in 1953.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A mysterious, recurrent oil slick that has killed thousands of
seabirds has been traced to a freighter that sank off the Northern
California coast almost 50 years ago, the Coast Guard said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The culprit is the Jacob Luckenbach, a 468-foot ship that collided
with another vessel in 1953 and sank about 17 miles southwest of the
Golden Gate Bridge.</LD>
<LD>   The oil that has been leaking off and on ever since apparently has
come from the Luckenbach's fuel tanks and not from its cargo of
automobiles and heavy machinery, said Lt. Tim Callister, a spokesman
for the Coast Guard in the Bay Area city of Alameda.</LD>
<TE>   Identifying the source of the slick, which has killed almost 1,000
birds since its latest appearance in November, was the result of a
painstaking and expensive bit of high-tech detective work by a task
force of federal and state agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Experts analyzed the oil that has been oozing up, soon concluding
that it wasn't from a natural oil seep, and probably was crude oil or
the sort of heavy fuel oil used to power many ships.</TE>
<TE>   Lab tests revealed a specific "fingerprint" for the oil, and the
task force was able to rule out spills from tankers passing near the
Farallon Islands, the area from which the oil seemed to be emanating.</TE>
<TE>   Samples from equally mysterious oil slicks in the winters of
1992-93, 1997-98, 1999 and 2001 had the same fingerprint. The leak in
1997-98 killed more than 2,000 birds.</TE>
<TE>   Searching through maritime records, investigators soon homed in on
about a dozen ships known to have sunk near the Farallons. They
included the tanker Puerto Rican, which exploded and sank in 1984;
the aircraft carrier Independence, which was intentionally sunk in
the 1950s; two Navy tankers that went down during storms in the
1950s; and a couple of freighters, including the Luckenbach.</TE>
<TE>   The records showed that a sister ship, the Hawaiian Pilot, slammed
into the Luckenbach in heavy fog on July 14, 1953. The Luckenbach,
mortally wounded, went down in less than 30 minutes. All 36 on board
were transferred to the other ship, which was able to continue to San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, using a remote-controlled submarine that costs $24,000
a day to operate, the task force studied the ocean-floor wreckage of
the Luckenbach with a television camera.</TE>
<TE>   "The camera did not show any direct evidence of oil coming from
the ship, but [it] did observe minor amounts of oil moving about in
one of the vessel's cargo holds," the Coast Guard said. In addition,
small amounts were found on the surface above the ship.</TE>
<TE>   Samples of oil from the surface were taken to a state Fish and
Game lab near Sacramento and a Coast Guard lab in Connecticut. The
samples were compared with the oil fingerprinted earlier. The oils
matched.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very exciting," said Bill Castle, supervising chemist at
the state Fish and Game laboratory. "There's a real sense of relief,
because these spills create a big problem for us and our wildlife."</TE>
<TE>   The Navy has been asked to offer suggestions on how the ship might
be recovered.</TE>

<HD>State's Redrawn Congressional Districts Protect Incumbents</HD>
<DH>Politics: Remapping has eliminated a handful of 'swing'
areas and diminished competition. Lack of close races has serious
effects, pundits say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN MERL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the California Legislature redrew the boundaries for
congressional districts last year, insiders promptly labeled the
result the Incumbent Protection Plan.</LD>
<LD>   In a rare burst of bipartisan cooperation, legislators did their
best to make all districts either safely Democratic or safely
Republican; thus they sharply curtailed the likelihood of competition
this year.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, most of the action will come in the March 5 primary
battles, when candidates compete for their party's nomination.</LD>
<TE>   "The redistricting makes the November elections all but
meaningless," said Allan Hoffenblum, publisher of the California
Target Book, which tracks the state's congressional and legislative
contests.</TE>
<TE>   That is not to say there is nothing on the election horizon to
interest voters. Central Valley Democratic Rep. Gary Condit's
relationship with missing Washington intern Chandra Levy has set up a
tough primary fight in the 18th District, and some Democrats fear
that they might lose the supposedly safe seat in November if Condit
wins the primary.</TE>
<TE>   A few other hot primary races are shaping up, especially in the
two districts with open seats, including the 39th in southeast Los
Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the overall lack of competition is bound to affect the
political process in both positive and negative ways. On the plus
side, it can foster experience, give representatives the clout of
seniority and allow them to focus on issues and less on getting
reelected.</TE>
<TE>   But it can also discourage worthy challengers and dampen voter
interest, experts say. Many believe that the disadvantages of safe
districts outweigh the benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The once-a-decade reapportionment process eliminated the handful
of moderate, "swing" districts that, in the 2000 elections, helped
make California a key battleground in the two major parties'
continuing fight for control of the House of Representatives.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats prevailed in all five of the state's fiercest contests,
fending off a strong Republican challenge in the Central Valley,
capturing an open formerly GOP seat in the Silicon Valley and
knocking off three Republican incumbents in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, who control the Legislature, decided against trying to
pick up more seats. They opted to protect all 32 of their incumbents
while preserving the GOP's roster of 20 seats; Republicans went along
with the plan. Maps for state Senate and Assembly districts followed
similar incumbent-protection patterns.</TE>
<TE>   (Population gains reflected in the 2000 census gave California a
53rd seat, and the maps were drawn to ensure that it goes to a
Democrat this fall.)</TE>
<TE>   None of this surprised political veterans, including former Rep.
Leon E. Panetta, a Democrat who represented Monterey and Santa Cruz
before joining the Clinton administration in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   'First Order ... Is to Protect Your Rear End'</TE>
<TE>   "With redistricting, the first order of business is to protect
your rear end," said Panetta, now director of the Panetta Institute
at Cal State Monterey Bay.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody kind of winks at each other. They all know it is
basically about protecting seats, but I think there is a price to be
paid for that" in voter apathy, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The more competitive the districts are, the more people get
involved in our system of government, and the representative also has
to be more involved and more sensitive" to district needs and
sentiments, Panetta said.</TE>
<TE>   The changes in Los Angeles County's coastal 36th District
illustrate how the remapping worked to the benefit of incumbents from
both parties.</TE>
<TE>   With registration nearly evenly split between the two parties, it
wasn't a safe seat for either. Democrat Jane Harman won in 1992 with
a high-spending campaign and a politically moderate platform. When
she gave it up in 1998 to make an unsuccessful run for governor,
middle-of-the-roader Steven T. Kuykendall took it into the Republican
column.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, in a nearly $4-million contest that attracted
money and attention from across the country, Harman defeated
Kuykendall, winning by less than 2 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   Now map makers have lopped the heavily Republican Palos Verdes
Peninsula from the district and added Democratic neighborhoods on the
north and east. That increased the Democrats' 41%-39% registration
edge to 46% to 33%. The peninsula went to the new 46th District of
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, maintaining a strong GOP base for the Orange
County Republican.</TE>
<TE>   Similar scenarios occurred in other once-competitive districts. In
the suburbs northeast of Los Angeles, then-state Sen. Adam Schiff
(D-Burbank) defeated Rep. James E. Rogan (R-Glendale) in an
$11.5-million contest that broke the spending record for a House
race.</TE>
<TE>   Map makers widened the Democrats' advantage, 46% to 33%, in
Schiff's new district and gave the largely Republican city of La
Canada Flintridge to Rep. David Dreier (R-San Dimas), which helped
give the GOP an 11-point registration edge in his new district.</TE>
<TE>   For Harman, this year's race should be easier. Her Republican
opponent will not be an incumbent congressman but one of two relative
unknowns: businesswoman Gloria Elyse Davis of Marina del Rey or
attorney Stuart Johnson of Manhattan Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Harman has not yet assembled a campaign team, but she did raise
funds through most of last year, taking in about $622,000 by Dec. 31.
She has spent $340,000 of that, records filed with the Federal
Election Commission show.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't take any of this for granted," she said. "I don't know
what an easy election is, and I don't assume I have one this time."</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Sinclair, a political science professor at UCLA, said
there are some advantages to districts that don't generate regular
competitions.</TE>
<TE>   They tend to be more homogeneous and thus easier to represent, and
they allow officeholders to build experience and the clout that comes
with seniority--which can be very beneficial to constituents.
Republican Dreier, for example, who has been in office since 1981, is
chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Also, not having to worry about a tough reelection fight every two
years can allow lawmakers to focus less on campaigning and raising
money and more on issues, especially controversial ones.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a downside [to lack of competition], of course, but it
is not as one way as it is presented.... Having a district always on
the knife's edge is not such an unequivocally good thing," Sinclair
said.</TE>
<TE>   David J. Olson, a political science professor at the University of
Washington, sees few real benefits to a system that creates so many
safe seats. Contested elections tend to increase voter turnout
because they offer real choices and interest-generating campaigns, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Competitive districts also "force the parties to nominate
candidates who are not extremists of the left or right. "They are
competing for the centrist voters," Olson said.</TE>
<TE>   Washington state's redistricting system puts the map making in the
hands of a bipartisan commission, which tends to produce a far bigger
proportion of competitive seats than does California's method of
having legislators draw the lines.</TE>
<TE>   Six of Washington's nine congressional seats are competitive,
Olson said. Majority status in the state's congressional delegation
flipped back and forth between Republicans and Democrats as the seats
turned over during the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   In California, 17 of the 52 incumbents face primary opponents, but
only a few races seem likely to generate much interest. Four
Democrats filed to run against Condit, including former Assemblyman
Dennis Cardoza, who is believed to have the best shot at unseating
his one-time boss.</TE>
<TE>   Few Incumbents Face Tough Challengers</TE>
<TE>   In Northern California, Auburn physician Bill Kirby is challenging
Rep. John T. Doolittle (R-Rocklin), who Kirby says is too
conservative for the rural district. On the Democratic side, Rep.
Lynn C. Woolsey of Petaluma faces opposition from Santa Rosa Mayor
Mike Martini, who says she is too liberal.</TE>
<TE>   Fierce primary contests are underway in the two districts with
open seats, with the March victors expected to handily win election
in November. The new 39th District, which includes several cities in
southeast Los Angeles County, was drawn to favor a Latino Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   Among the six Democrats, the top contenders are thought to be
South Gate Councilman Hector de la Torre, Assemblywoman Sally Havice
of Cerritos and labor official Linda Sanchez, sister of Rep. Loretta
Sanchez (D-Garden Grove).</TE>

<HD>Riordan Takes Off Gloves in Latest Ad</HD>
<DH>Campaign: Davis' rival responds to attack, pounding
governor on Enron, state budget.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN and MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two weeks after Gov. Gray Davis launched a blistering series of ads
against him, GOP gubernatorial candidate Richard Riordan struck back
Friday with his own spot criticizing the governor's record on energy
and the budget.</LD>
<LD>   Riordan's ad responds to just one of Davis' charges--that Riordan
is not a true supporter of abortion rights. The ad says the
Democratic incumbent has attacked Riordan's record on abortion to
divert attention from Davis' own failures as governor.</LD>
<LD>   It also accuses Davis of taking "more money from Enron than any
[other] politician in America." In fact, Republican President Bush
has accepted far more in Enron donations over his career than Davis.</LD>
<TE>   "Gray Davis--he hasn't done his job," the Riordan spot concludes.
"But he will say and do anything to keep it."</TE>
<TE>   The tit for tat between Riordan and Davis is escalating even
though they are not running against each other at this point. Riordan
is facing a Republican primary March 5 against California Secretary
of State Bill Jones and businessman Bill Simon Jr. Davis faces no
serious opposition in the Democratic primary.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Riordan and Davis have exchanged barbs for weeks,
many of them over abortion and Riordan's stand on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   In Riordan's newest ad, the former mayor of Los Angeles looks
directly into the camera and explains his position.</TE>
<TE>   "I strongly dislike abortion," he says. "But just as strongly, I
respect and support the right of a woman to make her own choice."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan has made his support of abortion rights a centerpiece of
his campaign. But the Davis ads point out that he donated to
anti-abortion groups in 1987 and 1991. One of them shows Riordan
saying in 1991 that he thought abortion was "murder."</TE>
<TE>   The new Riordan spot reflects his campaign's concern over the
potential damage the Davis ads could inflict upon him just as he
tries to introduce himself to voters outside Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis campaign has pulled its two abortion attack ads but is
continuing to run others that go after Riordan on crime, the death
penalty and the state energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Before Friday, Riordan's campaign had responded to the Davis
onslaught with just one ad saying that the governor had "chosen to
attack me personally" and that "Californians deserve better." It did
not address any specific charges.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the Riordan campaign declined to discuss the shift
in tone. Privately, however, strategists have been fuming at Davis'
perceived meddling in the GOP primary. Some worried that a failure to
respond to his attacks could undercut Riordan by allowing the
governor's charges to stick.</TE>
<TE>   The former mayor is leading his GOP foes in fund-raising and early
polls. But Simon, a multimillionaire who is largely bankrolling his
own campaign, has tripled his television ad spending this week. He is
airing a series of spots in which he is identified as "conservative
Republican Bill Simon."</TE>

<HD>Judge Rejects PG&amp;E Plan for Reorganization</HD>
<DH>Bankruptcy Court: The utility's broad attempt to preempt
California laws draws fire. State officials, the PUC laud decision.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal bankruptcy judge in San Francisco on Friday rejected
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.'s "across-the-board, take-no-prisoners"
strategy for bypassing state laws and regulations as a reorganized
company.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Dennis Montali rebuffed PG&amp;E's argument that federal
bankruptcy law automatically supercedes state law and would allow the
preemption of numerous state statutes.</LD>
<LD>   But Montali left the door open for PG&amp;E to modify its
controversial reorganization plan, which, among other things, calls
for shifting its generation and transmission facilities outside the
regulatory reach of the state Public Utilities Commission.</LD>
<TE>   The judge said that the utility's plan could be confirmed if the
company establishes that specific laws need to be preempted for the
plan to succeed.</TE>
<TE>   The utility issued a terse statement, saying, "PG&amp;E intends to
move forward with its plan," taking into account Montali's decision.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April,
said its plan will fully repay creditors and will not cause a rate
increase. Government agencies and consumer groups allege that the
plan amounts to a "jailbreak" from state regulation that would result
in higher-cost, less-reliable utility service.</TE>
<TE>   State officials, including Gov. Gray Davis, hailed Montali's
decision.</TE>
<TE>   PUC General Counsel Gary Cohen told a news conference that "PG&amp;E's
plan is dead in the water." To preempt state law, Cohen said, PG&amp;E
would have to show that the laws it seeks to avoid are not important
to health and safety. "The burden ... is so high as to be
insurmountable," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney General Bill Lockyer, whose office opposed the preemption
of dozens of state laws, said the laws "are almost entirely health
and safety. We need to keep the energy flowing to keep people and
businesses healthy. We want the environment healthy."</TE>
<TE>   Davis said it's in California's interest to keep PG&amp;E's vast
system of hydroelectric facilities and watershed under state laws.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E's plan calls for transferring such assets to new subsidiaries
of its parent company. The utility seeks to preempt the PUC's review
of the transfer, which includes a state environmental assessment. But
PG&amp;E said it would comply with all applicable laws after the
transfer.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to arguments by the state, Montali said that "using
bankruptcy reorganization to move from state regulation to federal
regulation is not necessarily improper," nor is disaggregating a
company's assets as PG&amp;E proposes.</TE>
<TE>   But the judge raised questions in court and in his decision about
PG&amp;E's request for a broad preemption of state laws. He asked, for
example, whether a plan could provide for a debtor to sell liquor to
minors, which state law prohibits. "There were no satisfactory
answers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Trustee Linda Ekstrom Stanley said she was pleased that
Montali's decision acknowledged that the case's impact is more than
purely economic and affects more people than creditors. "He's saying
you have to be very careful before you preempt laws of the state that
are designed to protect Californians," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "PG&amp;E is arrogant enough to think they are above the law," said
Nettie Hoge, head of the Utility Reform Network. "This decision sets
them back on their heels and reminds them there must be a reason
other than increasing corporate profits to set aside state law."</TE>
<TE>   The PUC won permission to submit the outlines of an alternative
reorganization plan by Wednesday so the judge can determine whether
it appears viable. PG&amp;E must submit its response to the PUC's plan on
Feb. 21, along with a statement of its intentions for its own plan.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, PG&amp;E's parent company--PG&amp;E Corp.--filed a motion
transferring to Bankruptcy Court a lawsuit by the attorney general
alleging that it improperly siphoned up to $4 billion from the
utility.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general's office said it would challenge the change
of venue from San Francisco Superior Court.</TE>

<HD>Cigna Profit Drops 31%; Costs Cited</HD>
<DH>Insurance: Firm says slow growth and expense of medical
care and job reductions hurt results for the fourth quarter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cigna Corp., the third-largest U.S. health insurer, said
fourth-quarter profit fell 31% because of rising medical costs, slow
growth in employer health plans and expenses for reducing its work
force.</LD>
<LD>   Net income fell to $191 million, or $1.32 a share, from $277
million, or $1.76, a year earlier, the company said. Revenue fell
3.2% to $4.94 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Enrollment in the insurer's health plans rose less than 1% as U.S.
employers cut jobs.</LD>
<TE>   The company also lost some customers to rivals such as
UnitedHealth Group Inc. that compete with Cigna to manage health-care
benefits for large employers. That business typically is more
profitable than health-maintenance organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Cigna said profit would have been $277 million, or $1.92 a share,
without expenses for the job cuts and gains on the sale of a
reinsurance business and the company's Japanese life-insurance unit.
That was higher than the $1.81 average estimate from analysts
surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the Philadelphia-based company rose $1.27 to $90.25 on
the New York Stock Exchange. Cigna didn't raise premiums enough to
cover higher medical costs last year and is trying to catch up. It's
also investing to move customers to a new claims-processing system
that may improve service and cut expenses. Cigna last month said
about 2,000 jobs will be lost as part of that restructuring.</TE>
<TE>   Cigna forecast membership to grow about 1% to 2% this year.</TE>
<TE>   The insurer had 14.3 million customers at the end of the year, up
about 1% from the previous year though down 2.8% in Cigna's
health-maintenance organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Cigna said it expects operating income of $7.85 to $8.15 a share
this year. The company was expected to earn $7.98 a share in the
period, according to First Call. First-quarter profit is forecast at
$1.75 to $1.95 a share, the company said.</TE>

<HD>Corning Shares Rise 17% on Sales Forecast</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Company predicts a boost in revenue after a
decline in the first quarter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>CORNING, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Corning Inc. shares surged 17% on Friday after the biggest maker of
fiber used in telecommunications networks said sales may increase
this year after a first-quarter decline.</LD>
<LD>   "We are increasingly confident that the first quarter will
represent a bottom," Chief Executive John Loose said at a meeting
with investors in New York.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of the unprofitable company rose $1.08 to $7.52 on Nasdaq.
They fell 83% last year as telephone carriers cut spending on fiber
and parts that move traffic through networks.</LD>
<TE>   Sales might rise this year as economies improve and customer
spending picks up, Loose said. Corning predicted first-quarter sales
of $925 million to $950 million, down from $1.92 billion in the
year-earlier period and $974 million in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "We're expecting this to be a trough quarter, and we're expecting
the second quarter to be very much like that too," said Needham &amp; Co.
analyst Mark Langley. He rates Corning a "buy" and doesn't own the
stock.</TE>
<TE>   The Corning, N.Y.-based company said shipments of optical fiber
will rise at least 15% in the first quarter from the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts expect Corning to lose 17 cents a share on sales of
$944.3 million, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>

<HD>Prandium's Hamburger Hamlet Deal Collapses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Restaurant owner Prandium Inc., edging closer to bankruptcy, said
Friday that its deal to sell 14 Hamburger Hamlet restaurants has
fallen through.</LD>
<LD>   The Irvine company, which has piled up huge debts and defaulted on
several interest payments, warned that it may be forced into
bankruptcy proceedings from which it might not emerge if it can't
find a buyer. Prandium has said it would use proceeds from a sale to
pay some bondholders.</LD>
<LD>   Prandium, which also owns the Koo Koo Roo and Chi-Chi's chains,
said its deal to sell Hamburger Hamlet to Beverly Hills-based Othello
Holding Corp. for $16.1million in cash was terminated after the
purchaser failed to meet certain terms. Prandium spokesman Robert L.
Carl would not elaborate. Othello officials could not be reached.</LD>
<TE>   Prandium remains confident it will sell Hamburger Hamlet, which
has been on the block since May, Carl said. Othello remains one of
the prospective buyers, Prandium said in its release.</TE>
<TE>   The company has defaulted on 12 interest payments and owed
bondholders nearly $235 million as of Sept. 30, Carl said.</TE>
<TE>   If it can sell Hamburger Hamlet and work out more financing,
Prandium would file voluntary bankruptcy that would allow it to
reorganize.</TE>
<TE>   Prandium shares, which trade over-the-counter, closed Friday at
about 1 cent, virtually unchanged.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steve Wynn, the flamboyant Las Vegas casino mogul whose works include
the Bellagio and Mirage, said he plans to build a $500-million to
$800-million casino with an Asian flavor using his newly won gambling
license in Macau.</LD>
<LD>   Wynn was one of three parties to receive new casino licenses from
the former Portuguese colony, ending a decades-old monopoly held by
the equally flamboyant Stanley Ho.</LD>
<LD>   "It represents a terrific challenge and an exciting one at this
point in my life," Wynn, 59, said Friday. "The challenge is to
develop a hotel for the Asian market, based on our experience here"
in Las Vegas.</LD>
<TE>   Casinos are the economic backbone of Macau, a Chinese-administered
enclave near Hong Kong. In 2000, they raked in $2.2 billion, which
made up about 35% of the gross domestic product.</TE>
<TE>   Wynn said he will begin discussions on a final contract after the
upcoming Chinese New Year. He will set up a temporary casino in the
next few months, with an opening planned for the spring.</TE>

<HD>Judge Sets Hearing on Microsoft Settlement</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>D. IAN HOPPER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The federal judge in the Microsoft Corp. antitrust case tentatively
set a hearing for the second week of March to determine whether the
settlement reached by the firm and the federal government is in the
public interest.</LD>
<LD>   Her final ruling, however, may wait until after she hears from
nine states that chose not to settle and to fight for stricter
penalties for breaking antitrust law.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly may have a one-day
hearing, as requested by the parties, but said she could want them to
present evidence as well, which would extend the process.</LD>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly did not indicate whether she would allow third
parties to testify in the settlement hearing. The request to shut
them out, made by Microsoft and the government, was assailed by
Microsoft critics, who say they want to make sure their view is heard
by the court.</TE>
<TE>   The judge tried to address the complications brought by a
settlement hearing and a simultaneous effort to bring stronger
penalties against Microsoft by the nine states, including California,
that refused the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the judge, the government and settling states said
they would stay out of the remedies hearing for the nonsettling
states. Microsoft showed its resolve against those states and said
the suing states shouldn't be allowed to criticize the settlement
during their own proceeding.</TE>
<TE>   The judge gave a preliminary approval to the Justice Department's
request to put the approximately 30,000 public comments online and on
CD-ROM rather than publishing them all in the Federal Register. The
department said putting them on paper would cost $4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, Microsoft asked the court to force Oracle Corp., one
of the company's fiercest rivals, to comply with subpoenas in the
case.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft wants copies of Oracle documents related to the case, as
well as an interview with Oracle Vice President Ken Glueck.</TE>
<TE>   Glueck did not return messages seeking comment.</TE>

<LD>Qualcomm Inc. on Friday defended its accounting practices after a
research firm's report raising concerns about them sent the company's
shares down to a 21/2-year low.</LD>
<LD>   "Qualcomm has the highest standards of corporate governance and
accounting," said Anthony Thornley, chief financial officer of
Qualcomm.</LD>
<LD>   "What obviously has happened here is that [the research firm] has
extracted data [that has been] taken out of context and not presented
in context," Thornley said.</LD>
<TE>   Questions about corporate accounting methods have dogged the stock
market in the wake of energy trader Enron Corp.'s collapse.</TE>
<TE>   A summary of the Center for Financial Research and Analysis report
obtained Friday by Reuters said, "We found that the company has
recorded revenue in exchange for noncash consideration and that the
company has accepted noncash consideration for receivables removed
from Qualcomm's balance sheet."</TE>
<TE>   The Rockville, Md.-based center analyzes public companies'
financial data for money managers and other clients. Efforts to reach
the report's author were unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   After dissemination of the report, Qualcomm's stock hit a low of
$34.59 before recovering some of its losses and closing at $37.46,
off $1.65, or 4.2%, on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   "In this environment, any time someone raises accounting concerns
of a company, the stock is going to suffer," said Matthew Hoffman,
wireless analyst with SoundView Technology.</TE>
<TE>   Qualcomm issued a statement addressing the report after the stock
market closed.</TE>
<TE>   CFRA said Qualcomm allowed early-stage companies to pay part of
their license fees in equity instead of cash. CFRA said Qualcomm
recorded $11 million in revenue during fiscal 2001 based on the
equity and accepted $9 million more in equity as receivables. Total
revenue in 2001 was $2.7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Thornley acknowledged the CFRA figures, but said the accounting
was in accordance with accepted principles.</TE>
<TE>   The report also cited what it called potential conflicts of
interest between the board and the company's auditor, familial
relationships among Qualcomm's executive officers and "seemingly
generous option grants during a year of poor corporate results."
Thornley disputed those points.</TE>

<HD>FBI, SEC Probe Global Crossing</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The FBI and securities regulators are investigating ailing Global
Crossing Ltd., focusing primarily on an ex-employee's allegations
that the company used a variety of misleading accounting methods to
pump up revenue and other key financial measures.</LD>
<LD>   A spokeswoman for Global Crossing confirmed the investigation by
the Securities and Exchange Commission, but would not comment on the
FBI probe, which is in its initial stages, according to a source
close to the situation.</LD>
<LD>   The Bermuda-based telecommunications company, which has executive
offices in Beverly Hills, filed for bankruptcy court protection Jan.
28, becoming the largest telecommunications firm to do so.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Times first reported the SEC's interest in the
company's accounting Feb. 1. The SEC advised Global Crossing of its
formal investigation by letter Feb. 6 and served the company with a
subpoena seeking documents, including "press releases and
correspondents and contracts," according to Global Crossing
spokeswoman Becky Yeamans.</TE>
<TE>   Both probes are focused primarily on allegations made by Roy
Olofson, a former vice president of finance at Global Crossing who
plans to sue the company over his firing in November.</TE>
<TE>   In an Aug. 6 letter, Olofson warned the company's top attorney
that Global Crossing's accounting practices were suspect and
misleading. The company has denied the allegations.</TE>

<HD>Toyota to Pay Repair Costs for Some Sludge-Fouled Engines</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Toyota Motor Corp. said Friday that it was sending letters to 3.3
million Toyota owners in the U.S. in hopes of resolving a potential
engine problem.</LD>
<LD>   Faced with a small but steady stream of complaints from customers
who say their Toyota and Lexus engines are gumming up with sludgy,
oxidized oil, Torrance-based Toyota Motors Sales U.S.A. is promising
to pay repair costs for sludge damage when car owners can provide
proof that they changed the oil in their vehicle at least once a
year.</LD>
<LD>   The policy adjustment covers Toyota and Lexus models from 1997 to
the present equipped with the company's 3.0-liter V-6 engine or its
2.2-liter four-cylinder engine.</LD>
<TE>   Those engines are used in most of the maker's high-volume models
such as the Toyota Camry, Solara and Avalon cars, Sienna minivan,
Highlander sport-utility vehicle and the Lexus RX300 SUV and ES300
sedan.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota spokesman Mike Michels said the firm has had 3,100
complaints about oil sludge problems.</TE>
<TE>   An article published Friday by the Automotive News on its Internet
site quoted owners of several Toyota vehicles as saying they faced
thousands of dollars in repair bills when Toyota dealers refused to
fix their sludge-fouled engines under warranty.</TE>
<TE>   Michels said Toyota believed almost all problems were caused by
owners who did not follow Toyota's recommended schedule of oil
changes every 7,500 miles or six months, whichever comes first, under
normal driving conditions and at 5,000 miles or every four months
under severe driving conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "We are talking about 0.01% of the owners," he said. "If this were
a pervasive problem, we would have known about it long ago. Quality
surveys from J.D. Power and others would have reflected it."</TE>
<TE>   Michels declined to speculate on the potential cost to
Toyota--first-class postage for the letters alone ran $1.1
million--but said many of the engine problems could be repaired by
simply changing the oil several times to flush the sludge.</TE>
<TE>   "A valve job might be the most expensive thing. An engine
replacement would be very rare," he said.</TE>

<HD>Pasadenans Debate Plan to End Busing</HD>
<DH>Education: The intent is to lure families back to public
schools, but some fear a new segregation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A plan by the Pasadena school district's new superintendent to end
busing and emphasize neighborhood schools has been praised by some in
the community, but has angered others. More of that debate is
expected today during public hearings.</LD>
<LD>   Supt. Percy Clark Jr.'s busing proposal is part of a larger
improvement plan that he hopes will attract back to public schools
some of the 8,000 Pasadena youngsters who now attend the more than 30
private schools in the area.</LD>
<LD>   But that's what worries some opponents. Fearing a return to
segregation, they say the district should concentrate on helping the
students who have remained in public schools. Supporters of the plan
say that busing no longer makes sense since 85% of Pasadena's public
school students are black, Latino or Asian and re-segregation is
improbable because so many of Pasadena's neighborhoods have become
residentially integrated.</LD>
<TE>   One fault line appears to be a generational one, even within
minority communities.</TE>
<TE>   Maurice Morse, a black educator with the district for 39 years,
remembers when she and others fought to get busing to desegregate
schools in the '60s and '70s. If others fail to understand her
passion on the issue, perhaps it is because "they just haven't lived
long enough."</TE>
<TE>   "They" are a younger generation of Pasadena residents. People like
City Councilman Chris Holden, who was a middle school student in
1970, the year that the district began busing students under a court
order. Holden, who is black, says the time for busing has passed.</TE>
<TE>   Morse, although otherwise supportive of Clark, has a measured
skepticism about what the end of busing will mean for the
23,500-student district, which includes Altadena and Sierra Madre.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you how we'll achieve integration without busing,"
Morse said.</TE>
<TE>   Morse and the other desegregation "warriors," as Clark calls them,
acknowledge that busing has not created the integrated Pasadena
Unified School District they envisioned. After busing began in 1970,
school attendance plummeted as many white families either left the
district or enrolled their children in private schools.</TE>
<TE>   About 2,300 students ride bus routes designed to create racial
parity. But in many instances, minority students now are bused to
schools where the student bodies are overwhelmingly black and Latino.</TE>
<TE>   The '70s was a far different time, when Morse taught one of
Pasadena's first integrated classes--15 white and 11 black
first-graders. One of the first black teachers to work in the
district, Morse grew up in south Georgia and was educated in
segregated schools until graduate school.</TE>
<TE>   "Before busing, it was like we had two separate school districts,"
she said of Pasadena. "We don't want to go back to the way it was."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Hopkins, a Pasadena attorney and publisher of the black
newspaper the Pasadena Journal, says he does not want to see the
district spend money to woo white students back to the public schools
rather than concentrating on the students who already are in the
ailing district.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to take that $8 million they'll save from busing and
hire tutors and mentors and home workers to teach them and read to
them on a one-on-one basis," he said. "Don't take that money away
from busing and improve the plight of the white kids."</TE>
<TE>   School board member Peter Soelter said the tension is this: "Who
do we want to serve, students who are currently in the schools, or do
we make schools more attractive to bring students back who are not in
the district?"</TE>
<TE>   Clark, who is black, insists that his plan will not resegregate
the district and has many aspects geared to academic improvement. It
calls for redrawing school attendance zones to create neighborhood
schools, reopening closed campuses, changing grade configurations at
some schools and creating more magnet programs.</TE>
<TE>   Busing for purely transportation purposes and to relieve
overcrowding will remain, even if the superintendent's plan is
adopted.</TE>
<TE>   Holden has firsthand knowledge of busing's pluses and minuses. He
was a child of busing, and his four children ride buses for almost 40
minutes each way to and from school.</TE>
<TE>   Although busing introduced him to a wider world, it "was
disheartening, at the end of the day, getting on the bus with your
black friends, leaving all your white friends, and passing all these
other schools on the way to our homes," Holden said.</TE>
<TE>   "Neighborhoods [in Pasadena] are very much ethnically mixed," he
said. "Neighborhoods are diverse enough that neighborhood schools
would be diverse. If kids can walk to school, they should be able
to."</TE>
<TE>   Today, the community will have the opportunity to review the plan
at Eliot Middle School, 2184 N. Lake Ave., Altadena, at 10:30 a.m.</TE>

<HD>Building Honors State's Pioneer Female Lawyer</HD>
<DH>Dedication: Justice O'Connor helps rename downtown criminal
courts structure for Clara Shortridge Foltz.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first woman to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court officially renamed
the Los Angeles Criminal Courts Building on Friday in honor of the
first female lawyer in California: Clara Shortridge Foltz.</LD>
<LD>   At an afternoon ceremony attended by about 200 lawyers and judges,
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor praised Foltz for overcoming prejudice
and hardship throughout her career and paving the way for others.</LD>
<LD>   "She was really the pioneer for women lawyers," O'Connor said
during rededication of the 19-floor concrete and glass Temple Street
building, perhaps best known as the trial site for the O.J. Simpson
murder case. "When she saw a wrong, she worked to correct it."</LD>
<TE>   Foltz, born in 1849, was the first woman admitted to the state's
first law school, the first woman to serve as a deputy district
attorney in Los Angeles County, the first female notary public in the
state and a founder of the public defender system in the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   She also drafted the legislation and lobbied the California
Legislature to change the law restricting women and minorities from
practicing law. When her bill came up for a vote, she rode to
Sacramento in the caboose of a cattle train, with biscuits and boiled
eggs in her pockets.</TE>
<TE>   "She was truly a woman of courage, dedication and foresight who
viewed the profession that she expended so much effort to become a
part of as a means of serving the public," California's Chief Justice
Ronald M. George said.</TE>
<TE>   Foltz's struggles were not only professional; she was a single
mother who raised five children. Before her death in 1934, she wrote,
"I have lost for myself more than I have gained for all women. All
the pleasure of my young motherhood I sacrificed for woman's cause."</TE>
<TE>   Her great-grandson, Truman Toland, said renaming the building for
Foltz was an incredible, if not overdue, honor.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think even we realized what Clara had done," said Toland,
who painted a portrait of Foltz that will hang in the building. "It's
just unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   Foltz's professional credo succinctly summed up her
accomplishments and attitude: "I am a woman and I am a lawyer--and
what of it?"</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors decided to rename the
courthouse last spring on a proposal by Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite
Burke, a lawyer and the first woman on the board. The building was
opened in 1972 on the site of the old county courthouse, built in
1891, where Foltz practiced law. Fotz had a picture of the old
courthouse on one of her scrapbooks.</TE>
<TE>   During Friday's ceremony, Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley said, "Welcome
back, Clara. Thank you for inspiring us all."</TE>

<HD>West High's Academics Triumph</HD>
<DH>Torrance: School team wins decathlon for L.A. County. A
junior receives the highest individual scores. Burbank places second.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Torrance's West High School walked away with top honors Friday in the
Academic Decathlon for Los Angeles County, the brain-exercising
scholarly competition for public schools not in the Los Angeles
Unified School District. Adding to West's big day, a junior from that
campus snagged the medal for the highest individual scores.</LD>
<LD>   West, along with second placer, Burbank High School, will advance
to the state competition in March, when a winner will be selected to
advance to the national finals. Beverly Hills High School came in
third place countywide. (The L.A. district and private schools have
their own contests.)</LD>
<LD>   Raylene Yung, a junior from West High, was the competition's
highest scoring student. Out of a possible 10,000 points, she earned
8,632. Last year, she was the second-highest scoring student in the
county contest.</LD>
<TE>   After her school took the big trophy at a ceremony at a Montebello
golf club's banquet hall, 16-year-old Yung said, "It's just amazing.
Everyone's absolutely thrilled. I don't think anyone expected it."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, West High came in in second place, bested by Palos
Verdes Peninsula High School, which went on to third place statewide.
Palos Verdes ranked eighth in the county on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Decathlete "training" can begin as early as the previous May for
some teams. Zohreen Adanjee, a senior from West High, said her team
studied together before and after school, at lunch and a couple of
nights a week.</TE>
<TE>   But as they sift through physics, fine arts and music lessons,
team members gain more than mere knowledge: They make close
friendships.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't just read or study, we bonded ... ," she said. "Our
team was really motivated. We wanted to do really well."</TE>
<TE>   The coordinator of the county's decathlon said too many high
school students don't get enough praise for the effort they put into
their academics. The county Academic Decathlon offers about 500
students recognition that athletes usually receive, Chris Chialtas
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pushing gray matter in this particular olympics of ours,"
he said of the competition. It includes 10 events, including speech,
interview, language arts, mathematics and the public Super Quiz, sort
of a group game of Jeopardy.</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. district winner this year will be announced at an awards
banquet Feb. 20. Last year's champion, El Camino High School of
Woodland Hills, won the national competition.</TE>
<TE>   Each Academic Decathlon team is made up of three A, B and C
students--so even students who don't do particularly well in school
but are smart and hard-working are given the chance to shine, coaches
say.</TE>
<TE>   "Students who don't get Bs or A's still have the opportunity to
compete and show their potential as well," said Maisha Lake, 29, the
decathlon coach for Inglewood High School.</TE>
<TE>   "Aca Dec has been like a second family for me," said Ian Adams, a
three-year team member from Alhambra High School. "We've gotten to
know each other through the more than 500 hours we've put in."</TE>
<TE>   Teammates can provide much needed support and motivation, said
Micah Rice, a senior at Torrance High School who scored a perfect

<HD>L.A. to Charge Billboard Firms Inspection Fees</HD>
<DH>Aesthetics: Payments will fund a crackdown on illegal
signs. The law is called anti-business by some, but one activist sees
it as 'a start.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The City Council set the stage Friday for a crackdown on illegal
billboards in Los Angeles by adopting a new law that charges an
annual fee for each sign to finance an inventory and inspection
program.</LD>
<LD>   Councilman Jack Weiss said the law he wrote will make the
billboard industry pay for expanded city efforts to enforce building
codes against the 40% of billboards believed to be out of compliance.</LD>
<LD>   "We have a chance today, with this ordinance, to ... take
significant action against illegal billboards in this city," Weiss
told his colleagues, before the unanimous vote to adopt the
ordinance.</LD>
<TE>   The council launched the program even as some civic activists
called for banning all new billboards, while industry officials said
they worry that the fee will drive away business.</TE>
<TE>   Mort Allen, a Studio City real estate agent who works with
billboard companies, told the council that the fee may hurt an
industry that already pays business taxes to the city.</TE>
<TE>   "You are driving business away, including the [film] studios, by
saying they can't advertise their product," Allen said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, anti-billboard activist Gerald Silver of Encino
said he hopes the council goes further and adopts a ban on all new
billboards.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a start," he said about the ordinance adopted Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Council members were shocked last year when, during a debate on
allowing new freeway billboards, city Building and Safety Department
officials said they did not have an inventory of all existing
billboards and could not say with certainty how many are illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem was that the city did not dedicate the
resources needed to inventory billboards and inspect each one to see
if it had a city permit and was the size that the permit allowed.</TE>
<TE>   The fee approved Friday will pay for inspectors to inventory
billboards and take enforcement actions. The ordinance also requires
billboard companies to provide documentation and a proof of permit
when they pay the annual fee.</TE>
<TE>   Once a fee is paid, a certificate will be provided that must be
affixed to the billboard, indicating the sign is in compliance.
Billboards that do not display the certificates can be targeted by
inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   "This will immediately improve our ability to enforce the law and
crack down on illegal billboards," Weiss said.</TE>
<TE>   The fee, which will take effect July 1, will be set after a study
determines the cost of the program. An early proposal suggested a fee
of about $200 per billboard for a bare-bones program employing 11
inspectors.</TE>

<LD>Apple Computer Inc. plans to halt sales of its products through
retail shops run by Circuit City Stores.</LD>
<LD>   "Apple and Circuit City have mutually decided to go their separate
ways and will be phasing out their relationship over the coming
year," a statement from the two companies said.</LD>
<LD>   Both firms declined to comment on reasons for the change.</LD>
<TE>   Remaining inventory will be sold for the rest of the year, Circuit
City said.</TE>

<HD>Antitrust Probe Ended, Pitney Bowes Says</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pitney Bowes Inc., the leading manufacturer of postage meters, said
the Justice Department has closed an investigation into whether the
company illegally tried to fend off competition from online stamp
sellers.</LD>
<LD>   The inquiry was closed without any action being taken, Pitney
Bowes said. The government started the review in 1999 after Pitney
Bowes sued former rival E-Stamp Corp. over patents for Internet
postage.</LD>
<LD>   The company agreed to pay Pitney Bowes an unspecified amount of
damages in June.</LD>
<TE>   E-Stamp abandoned the online postage business and was later
acquired by Learn2.com Inc., a maker of educational software. Its
intellectual property rights for Internet postage were sold to
Stamps.com Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Stamford, Conn.-based Pitney Bowes fell 15 cents to
$40.73 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Travelers Gives Details of IPO</HD>
<DH>Securities: Citigroup insurance unit would be spun off by
end of the year. Offering could raise as much as $5 billion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citigroup Inc.'s Travelers Property Casualty unit on Friday filed for
an initial public stock offering, likely to be the largest for a U.S.
insurance company.</LD>
<LD>   The IPO, which had been previously announced, could raise as much
as $5 billion, investors said.</LD>
<LD>   Citigroup's Travelers unit, in documents filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, didn't give details on how it hopes to price
the IPO, but did provide some new financial information.</LD>
<TE>   Citigroup expects to sell a 20% stake in Hartford, Conn.-based
Travelers via the IPO, which is slated to be completed before March
31. The rest of the car, home and business insurance company would be
spun off to Citigroup shareholders by year's end.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers would pay a $1-billion dividend to Citigroup before the
IPO. Travelers also would provide itself with some extra protection
from the rising costs of asbestos insurance payouts: Under terms of
the spinoff, if Travelers records more than $150 million in
unexpected, additional asbestos-related charges in any one fiscal
year, Citigroup would cover the amount, up to a limit of $800
million, after tax.</TE>
<TE>   Insurance stocks generally have fared well in the aftermath of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks because the losses suffered by many
insurers have triggered sharp rate increases likely to boost earnings
in 2002 and 2003. That expectation could mean strong demand for the
Travelers offering.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Citigroup Chairman Sandy Weill wants to jettison
Travelers because insurance is a slower-growing business than other
financial entities under Citigroup's roof, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The Travelers offering is likely to be the fourth-biggest U.S.
IPO, behind AT&amp;T Wireless Services Inc., Kraft Foods Inc. and United
Parcel Service Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Travelers had net income of $1.07 billion, down from
$1.3 billion in 2000. Revenue rose to $12.2 billion from $11 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The company will seek to have its shares trade on the New York
Stock Exchange under the symbol TAP/A. Salomon Smith Barney, another
Citigroup division, will underwrite the sale.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup shares rose $1.35 to $45.49 on the NYSE Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Russian Company's</TE>
<TE>   IPO a Success</TE>
<TE>   A Russian dairy and fruit juice company made its debut on the New
York Stock Exchange on Friday and got a solid reception from
investors.</TE>
<TE>   But a biotechnology firm abruptly canceled its IPO scheduled for
Thursday evening, amid waning demand for biotech shares.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's Wimm-Bill-Dann Foods saw its new shares surge $3.10, or
16%, to $22.60 in their first day of trading on the NYSE. The company
sold 10.6 million American depositary receipts at $19.50 each late
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Wimm-Bill-Dann, founded a decade ago, is Russia's biggest juice
and dairy food company. It sold shares to raise money for debt
reduction and to buy more factory space.</TE>
<TE>   The company is set to benefit as Russians drink more milk and eat
more yogurt, boosting consumption that is among the lowest in Europe.
Investors didn't seem rattled by reports that some of the company's
principals are linked to Russian organized crime.</TE>
<TE>   Wimm-Bill-Dann is the fifth Russian firm to have a full U.S. stock
listing. The shares trade under the ticker symbol WBD.</TE>
<TE>   Another company expected to sell stock Thursday--NeoGenesis
Pharmaceuticals Inc., a protein research firm--canceled its deal.</TE>
<TE>   NeoGenesis, which this week cut the asking price for its shares by
almost a third to lure investors, formally withdrew its filing with
the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of some biotech firms' recent failures to bring to
market once-promising drugs, "There's a real reluctance among people
to step forward," said Stephen Flaks, a private investor who recently
closed his Flaks Partners hedge fund that invested in biotech stocks.
"It's one of worst periods I've seen for some time."</TE>

<HD>Stocks Bounce Back on Bargain Hunting</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Rally follows five consecutive days of losses
amid concern about corporate accounting measures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A late-day rally pushed stocks higher Friday as investors picked
through the rubble of a five-day losing streak caused by jitters
about corporate America's accounting practices.</LD>
<LD>   "After a week of emotional selling, people are seeing values,"
said Eric Teal, a fund manager for Evergreen Asset Management. "Those
gut-wringing moments, when investors give in, is where you can make
significant gains in your portfolio. And with the economy recovering,
stocks are offering a good opportunity here."</LD>
<LD>   Stocks that had been battered by accounting questions, such as
conglomerate Tyco International and Irish drug maker Elan, jumped,
and shares of telecommunications and financial companies climbed
after being slammed in previous sessions. In addition, news that AOL
Time Warner Chairman Steve Case bought 1million shares of AOL this
week helped boost stocks in the last 90 minutes of trading.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 118.80 points, or 1.2%,
to 9,744.24. The broad Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose 16.05 points,
or 1.5%, to 1,096.22. The Nasdaq composite index rose 36.77 points,
or 2.1%, to 1,818.88.</TE>
<TE>   The day's gains ended the five-session skid--the longest for
Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 since the first week of trading after the
Sept.11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Winners led losers by 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange and
Nasdaq. Trading was moderate.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Friday's advance, the Dow was down 1.6% for the week,
Nasdaq fell 4.8%, and the S&amp;P 500 declined 2.3%. The S&amp;P 500 has
fallen four of the last five weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks have dropped recently amid a slew of bad news, including a
tepid forecast from Cisco Systems, which fell 30 cents Friday to
$16.76.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the recent sell-off stemmed from accounting irregularities
at Enron, which led to the firm's collapse. Investors had homed in on
companies with complex financial structures, such as Tyco. At least
for now, analysts are saying jitters are receding.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco, the most active stock on the New York Stock Exchange for the
10th straight session, added $1.83 to $29.88. J.P. Morgan Chase,
Tyco's leading lender, climbed $1.05 to $31.12.</TE>
<TE>   Elan rose $1.31 to $14.80 after losing half its market value in
the last five sessions, even though the company said regulators are
probing its accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   AOL, whose shares recently had been falling partly because
investors find it tough to assess its financial books after a slew of
acquisitions, rose $1.91 to $27.36.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like the accounting concerns, with regard to the
biggest-cap companies like [General Electric] and Tyco, are
subsiding, and as such the bears are going to be hard-pressed to keep
this issue rolling," said Robert Robbins, chief investment strategist
at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.</TE>
<TE>   Not all worries have passed, though. Wireless technology firm
Qualcomm fell $1.65 to $37.46 after a research firm raised concerns
about accounting issues in the company's fourth-quarter and full-year
financial reports.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news:</TE>
<TE>   * Gold mining shares surged as gold continued its climb, closing
up $3.80 at $303.50 an ounce--its highest close in two years. The
Amex index of gold mining stocks rose 2.5% and is up 35% year to
date. Newmont Mining led the index higher, gaining 87 cents to $25.</TE>
<TE>   * Corning climbed $1.08 to $7.52. The world's No. 1 maker of
fiber-optic cable said it sees first-quarter results largely in line
with Wall Street's expectations and said the quarter would mark the
bottom for its businesses.</TE>
<TE>   * Shares of companies with asbestos exposure were sold off after a
New York state court jury ruled against a unit of diversified
manufacturer Honeywell International to award $53.5 million to the
family of a man who died of asbestos exposure, the plaintiff's
attorney said. The verdict was against Bendix, a former unit of
AlliedSignal, which has merged with Honeywell. Honeywell tumbled
$1.21 to $32.71.</TE>
<TE>   * The dollar surged against the yen after the Bank of Japan met
without announcing new measures to combat deflation and spur growth.
Japan's currency fell to a three-year low of 134.76 to the dollar
from 133.50 Thursday.</TE>

<HD>Goodyear to Cut Jobs, May Trim Auto Maker Sales</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., North America's largest tire maker, plans
to cut 3,500 jobs and may reduce sales to auto makers after a
fourth-quarter loss of $174 million gave the company its first annual
loss in nine years.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the loss came from costs in the latest period to cut jobs
and replace about 200,000 truck tires. Goodyear, which had 96,000
employees, is eliminating jobs in Europe, Asia and Australia this
year.</LD>
<LD>   Goodyear also said sales to auto makers such as General Motors
Corp. and Ford Motor Co. may be reduced by about 25% over three years
because of declining profit margins.</LD>
<TE>   Goodyear sells about 30% of its tires to manufacturers, often at a
loss because auto makers demand lower prices from suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the tire maker rose $2.06, or 9.6%, to $23.46 on the New
York Stock Exchange on expectations the company will benefit from the
cost cutting. The stock had dropped 17% in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Goodyear's loss for the year was $203.6 million, or $1.27 a share,
compared with net income of $40.3 million, or 25 cents a share, in
2000, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth-quarter loss widened to $174 million, or $1.07 a share,
from $102 million, or 65 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales for the
period dropped 1.5% to $3.47 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Akron, Ohio-based Goodyear didn't benefit as much as expected from
Bridgestone Corp.'s Firestone tire-safety recalls.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Auto Makers Lose Asbestos Claims Bid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. auto makers fighting asbestos liability claims lost a battle
when a federal judge rejected their bid to transfer thousands of
lawsuits from state courts nationwide into a single court.</LD>
<LD>   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and the Chrysler arm of
DaimlerChrysler had asked for 15,000 to 20,000 brake-related asbestos
claims to be consolidated into the bankruptcy proceedings of auto
parts maker Federal Mogul Corp. Auto makers were poised to argue the
claims should be dismissed as a group, on grounds the claims lack
scientific evidence.</LD>
<LD>   But U.S. District Judge Alfred Wolin ruled that he did not have
jurisdiction to make such a move, that it would hurt Federal Mogul's
bankruptcy case and that it would disrupt many asbestos claims in
state courts that are nearing trial.</LD>
<TE>   In another asbestos case, Honeywell International Inc. was one of
three dozen companies ordered by a jury to pay the wife of a deceased
brake mechanic $53.5million for failing to warn him about asbestos
risks.</TE>
<TE>   The award by a state jury in New York City was the largest
compensatory damages for a single asbestos victim, plaintiffs' lawyer
Michael Roberts said.</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiff Patricia Brown said her husband was exposed to asbestos
while installing brakes covered with the fireproofing material during
the 1960s and '70s. Stephen Brown died of asbestos-related cancer in
December 2000.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>P&amp;O Princess Cruises rejected an increased, $6.8-billion takeover bid
from Carnival Corp., saying the No. 1 cruise line's proposal was
unlikely to clear antitrust hurdles, though the price is realistic.</LD>
<LD>   Carnival is the largest operator in the U.S. and Europe, and Royal
Caribbean Cruises Ltd., with which P&amp;O Princess is trying to combine,
is No. 2 in the U.S. and has a "relatively small European presence,"
London-based P&amp;O Princess said.</LD>
<LD>   "They are not even acknowledging that the regulatory approvals are
difficult," said P&amp;O Princess Chief Executive Peter Ratcliffe. "They
are leaving all the risks of this situation with our shareholders and
taking none themselves."</LD>
<TE>   On the NYSE, Carnival rose 95 cents to $26.62, and Royal Caribbean
fell 5 cents to $17.25.</TE>

<HD>BSkyB Looks to Sell Stake Back to Kirch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Debt-laden German media giant Kirch Group faced more pressure after
Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB said it wanted to sell its stake in the
company's money-losing pay-TV operation back to Kirch.</LD>
<LD>   British satellite broadcaster BSkyB said it didn't know whether
Kirch had the money to pay.</LD>
<LD>   BSkyB announced a big fiscal first-half loss after writing off the
value of its investment in the Kirch unit. Munich-based Kirch has run
up debts of about $4.3 billion, weighed down by mounting losses at
its Premiere pay-TV unit and a slump in advertising revenue after the
Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Without an injection of new funds, analysts say Kirch could face
bankruptcy if BSkyB exercises an option to sell back the 22% stake in
October for $1.5 billion. "That could be the final piece of the
puzzle that brings Kirch to the end," said Oliver Rupprecht, a media
analyst at M.M. Warburg.</TE>

<HD>Hijackers' Saga: Dad Slain, Son Arrested</HD>
<DH>Crime: The Lithuanian pair had escaped the Soviet Union 32
years ago by commandeering a jetliner and eventually settled in Santa
Monica.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 46-year-old Santa Monica man was charged Friday with murdering his
father, 32 years after the two of them seized a Soviet jetliner in a
hijacking that mushroomed into an international imbroglio.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors say Albert Victor White, formerly known as Algirdas
Brazinskas, bludgeoned his 77-year-old father, Pranas Brazinskas, to
death in their two-bedroom apartment in the 900 block of 21st Street
on Jan. 5.</LD>
<LD>   No details were given about a possible motive for the crime.</LD>
<TE>   White was being held in lieu of $1-million bail Friday. His
arraignment is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Monday in Santa Monica
Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say the father and then-13-year-old son, both
Lithuanians, hijacked an Aeroflot jetliner over the Soviet Union in
1970.</TE>
<TE>   Pranas Brazinskas said in an interview a decade later that he and
his son seized the plane using "rusty old guns" that they had
smuggled aboard. He said they hijacked the jet because he faced death
as a member of a Lithuanian resistance movement.</TE>
<TE>   The father said two armed Soviet guards aboard the plane opened
fire during the hijacking. In the ensuing battle, he said, a female
flight attendant was killed and both the pilot and co-pilot were
wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their wounds, the cockpit crew was able to follow the
hijackers' orders and land the plane in Turkey. There, the father and
son were arrested, convicted of murder and sentenced to prison--the
father for eight years and the son for two.</TE>
<TE>   In 1974, the two were released under a general amnesty but placed
under house arrest. Two years later, the pair escaped from house
arrest, but they surrendered to Turkish police after contacting the
U.S. Embassy in Ankara and seeking political asylum, which was
denied.</TE>
<TE>   In a series of angry exchanges, the Soviet Union asked that the
pair be extradited, but the Turkish government denied the request.</TE>
<TE>   Released two weeks later, the father and son made their way to
Venezuela. There they flew to Canada. They vanished after getting off
the plane during a stopover in New York, but were arrested a few
weeks later by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</TE>
<TE>   Immigration Judge Robert T. Griffin ruled that the father and son
should be allowed to reapply for asylum under the liberalized 1980
Refugee Act. The INS appealed the ruling, arguing that the two should
be deported.</TE>
<TE>   The INS appeal angered this country's Lithuanian community,
including Simas Kudirka, who was caught in an international
tug-of-war after he jumped from a Soviet trawler to a U.S. Coast
Guard boat in 1970. U.S. officials handed Kudirka back to the Soviets
and he spent four years in prison before it was discovered that he
was a U.S. citizen and allowed to return to this country.</TE>
<TE>   Although political asylum was never granted to them, Pranas
Brazinskas and his son were allowed to remain in the U.S. They moved
to Santa Monica, where both worked as house painters.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors at the Santa Monica apartment complex said Brazinskas
had become frail and cranky in recent years. Still, they said White
was protective of his father, defending him against harsh stares from
neighborhood children.</TE>
<TE>   One neighbor, Laurie Cotten, who is also of Lithuanian descent,
said he heard White tell the kids: "My dad is an old man. Please
don't make him nervous."</TE>
<TE>   Brazinskas, who was known as "Frank" to neighbors, managed the
apartment building for several years and rode a bicycle along the
alley behind the buildings for exercise. But a few years ago,
Brazinskas grew frail, giving up the bicycle for a walking cane.</TE>
<TE>   Brazinskas' violent history made some in the neighborhood nervous.</TE>
<TE>   "There were times that I was a little afraid of him only because
of what I knew about his history," Cotten said.</TE>
<TE>   Regina Oslapas, the head of the Santa Monica chapter of the
Lithuanian American Community, a local civic group, said the father
and son tried to raise funds for themselves on the basis of their
resistance movement and hijacking. But Oslapas said the group did not
consider Brazinskas a patriot because of the violence in his past.</TE>
<TE>   Lithuanian national Ema Datis, president of the Los Angeles Drama
Group, said the two men were well known and she heard about the
father's slaying Thursday at her group's meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "For a while, it was a big deal," Datis said. "They were really
well known for a while among the Lithuanians. They would come and
speak at our events. Then after a few years, they sort of
disappeared."</TE>
<TE>   Datis said Lithuanians differed on whether the men were heroes.</TE>
<TE>   "Many people hold them up high," she said. "But to some their
escape was regarded differently. Sure they wanted to be free, but
their escape cost a girl's life."</TE>

<HD>Appeals Court Reverses Death Penalty in 1978 Murder Case</HD>
<DH>Crime: Federal panel orders a new sentencing hearing,
saying man's Miranda rights were violated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court on Friday reversed the death sentence of a
man convicted of a 1978 San Jose murder, ruling that a violation of
the defendant's Miranda rights impermissibly affected the outcome.</LD>
<LD>   In a 3-0 ruling, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San
Francisco ordered that David Luther Ghent Jr. be given a new
sentencing hearing. The court upheld his murder conviction.</LD>
<LD>   Ghent has been on San Quentin's death row since Oct. 30, 1979,
placing him eighth in seniority among the 607 inmates on death row in
California.</LD>
<TE>   The decision has particular resonance in the history of death
penalty jurisprudence in California.</TE>
<TE>   When the California Supreme Court upheld capital punishment for
Ghent in 1987, it was the first time a death sentence had been
confirmed by the newly aligned court, just months after Chief Justice
Rose Elizabeth Bird and two associate justices had been voted off in
the stormiest judicial election in state history.</TE>
<TE>   The death penalty had been the key issue in that election as the
court under Bird had reversed 64 of the 68 death sentences it
reviewed during her nine years as chief justice.</TE>
<TE>   Ghent was convicted of the murder and attempted rape of Patricia
Bert, who was found dead in her home with 21 stab wounds in the chest
and neck. Ghent had type B blood, the type found in sperm in the
victim's body. Bert and her husband had type A blood.</TE>
<TE>   Ghent did not deny the killing, but claimed he acted without
deliberation or premeditation. He said he recalled going to Bert's
home, and after she told him her husband was not home, Ghent asked
for his work telephone number.</TE>
<TE>   As she wrote the number on a pad, he said, "her robe fell open,
revealing her naked body," according to the 9th Circuit decision.
"Ghent testified that his next memory was that he was standing over
Mrs. Bert's dead, nude body with a bloody knife in his hand. Mrs.
Bert's hands were tied behind her back," Judge Stephen Reinhardt
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   In his first trial in August 1979, Ghent was convicted of
first-degree murder and attempted rape, as well as the attempted rape
of another woman the same day.</TE>
<TE>   Ghent was tried under California's 1977 death penalty law, which
provided for a separate hearing to determine if there had been
"special circumstances" that would warrant a jury to consider a death
sentence. A special circumstances verdict required the jury to find
that Ghent committed a willful, deliberate and premeditated murder
and that this murder occurred during the commission of a felony such
as rape or attempted rape.</TE>
<TE>   The jury in Ghent's case deadlocked on the special circumstances
issue.</TE>
<TE>   A month later, another jury was impaneled to consider the special
circumstances issue. This jury concluded that the murder did occur
during an attempted rape, and returned a death verdict.</TE>
<TE>   On appeal, Ghent's lawyers contended that the trial judge
improperly admitted testimony on Ghent's mental state from a
psychiatrist who questioned him for the prosecution for 45 minutes.
The defense lawyers contended that the interrogation occurred despite
Ghent's request for a lawyer, in violation of the U.S. Supreme
Court's 1966 Miranda decision, which obligates police to inform a
suspect of his right to confer with a lawyer before being required to
answer any questions.</TE>
<TE>   Premeditation Angle Considered Crucial</TE>
<TE>   At the special circumstance retrial, the state had to prove beyond
a reasonable doubt that the murder had been willful, deliberate and
premeditated, Reinhardt wrote. He emphasized that the trial
prosecutor repeatedly characterized that as "the major issue in this
case."</TE>
<TE>   The psychiatrist testified that Ghent "had the mental capacities
at that time which were well within the range of normal reasonable
thinking." The doctor also said that Ghent had "the mental capacities
to premeditate whatever he did."</TE>
<TE>   Reinhardt emphasized that this testimony was "the only direct
evidence offered by the prosecution as to Ghent's state of mind."</TE>
<TE>   Ghent's trial attorney utilized two mental health experts, both of
whom disagreed with the prosecution psychiatrist. Both testified that
Ghent did not deliberately murder Mrs. Bert, and one said the murder
was not premeditated.</TE>
<TE>   In its ruling 15 years ago, the California Supreme Court said the
prosecution testimony should not have been admitted because of the
Miranda violation but concluded that it was a "harmless error" that
could not have affected the outcome in light of other testimony about
Ghent's mental state.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit panel sharply disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "The prosecutor not only used [the doctor's] testimony to
discredit the testimony and theories of the two defense expert
witnesses, but also to attack Ghent's credibility and truthfulness,"
Reinhardt wrote in an opinion joined by Judges Michael D. Hawkins and
Johnnie B. Rawlinson.</TE>
<TE>   "Ghent's credibility was a critical issue; Ghent himself testified
regarding his memory loss surrounding the crimes," Reinhardt wrote.
The prosecutor introduced the doctor's testimony by stating that the
psychiatrist would tell the jury that Ghent is "a liar, he's
dishonest," Reinhardt added.</TE>
<TE>   "We find it highly significant that the prosecutor argued [to the
jury] that one reason that [the psychiatrist's] testimony was highly
credible was that he had interviewed Ghent before Ghent was able to
contact his lawyers."</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutors "made use of--and sought to benefit from--this
unconstitutional attribute" of the psychiatrist's actions, the
veteran jurist wrote. "By doing so, it only emphasized and
exacerbated the violation." Consequently, the doctor's testimony had
a "substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the
jury's verdict," Reinhardt concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Review of Decision  May Be Requested</TE>
<TE>   Ghent's appellate lawyer, Douglas R. Young of San Francisco, said,
"I am very pleased. The decision is right on the money."</TE>
<TE>   Hallye Jordan, a spokeswoman for the California attorney general's
office, said attorneys in the office were studying the decision. It
is considered highly likely that the office will seek to have the
ruling reviewed by either a larger panel of 9th Circuit judges or the
U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>

<KH>THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR</KH>
<HD>GOP Gubernatorial Rivals Represent 3 Wings of Party</HD>
<DH>Convention: Jones, Riordan and Simon come at Republican
loyalists from different political ideologies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As they gather in San Jose this weekend to debate the future of their
party, California Republicans will get a look at three gubernatorial
candidates who embody distinct strands of the GOP's past--and its
possible future.</LD>
<LD>   To date, the primary contest has been dominated by questions of
political ideology, namely whether California's Republicans will
break with recent history and choose a candidate who charts a less
conservative course than the party has followed in recent years.</LD>
<LD>   Beneath that is a test of worldviews, one that pits a small-town
populist against a big-time deal-maker and a conservative idea man.</LD>
<TE>   Richard Riordan, the multimillionaire lawyer, venture capitalist
and former mayor of Los Angeles, represents the wing that has long
bankrolled the party. Secretary of State Bill Jones, whose family
still owns a farm in Fresno, is a rural-based career politician of
the sort that now dominates the small group of elected Republicans in
Sacramento. And Pacific Palisades businessman Bill Simon Jr., a
political novice, covers the intellectual turf by dropping the names
of the right-wing think tanks and taxpayer groups that provided the
brainpower for the Reagan revolution.</TE>
<TE>   "The three guys are almost wholly different," said veteran GOP
strategist Ken Khachigian, who is sitting out the primary. "It is the
beauty of our system--you get to pick from column A, column B and
column C."</TE>
<TE>   The semiannual party convention in San Jose, expected to draw
about 1,200 people, will be a chance for the GOP candidates to stoke
support among the party's most faithful followers. An hourlong debate
is set for today, and delegates will have an opportunity to show
their preference in a straw poll to be conducted over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The candidates draw their base of support from the three wings.
Riordan has raised the most money and is backed by the party's
financial establishment, including President Bush's top California
lieutenant, attorney Gerald Parsky. Simon has drawn endorsements from
most of the conservative ideological groups and snapped up several of
Bush's grass-roots operatives. And Jones has the backing of former
Gov. George Deukmejian and Central Valley farmers.</TE>
<TE>   For each candidate, there are contrasts between the wing of the
party he represents and his own record or performance on the trail.
Riordan portrays himself as a pragmatist but has been criticized by
some for doing a poor job of running Los Angeles. Though Simon bills
himself as the candidate of ideas, he is long on broad proposals and
short on specifics. Jones' career--from farmer to Assembly leader to
campaign finance reform advocate--is filled with contradictions.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the candidates' origins in the party have helped shape
their messages. They also may be a guide to how they would challenge
Gov. Gray Davis in November and, if victorious, how they would
govern.</TE>
<TE>   Stakes Are High for California Republicans</TE>
<TE>   The stakes for the Republican Party are profound. After holding
the governor's office through most of the 1990s, the GOP was routed
four years ago. The only Republican to hold statewide office, Jones,
is termed out this year. Many analysts say the party has moved too
far to the right on social issues in the last few years to mesh with
the state's moderate electorate, and has been too slow to react to
the state's demographic changes.</TE>
<TE>   But this year also holds encouraging signs for Republicans, too.
Bush is popular in California, where he lost roundly in 2000. Gov.
Gray Davis, on the other hand, is considered vulnerable for his
handling of the energy crisis and the state's economic difficulties.
That gives party leaders hope that they can reverse their fortunes
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, each candidate says he is the man for the job,
but none has been as vocal about the GOP's electoral dilemma as
Riordan. His solution: Jettison ideology to get the job done.</TE>
<TE>   At last month's debate in San Jose, Riordan proposed dropping the
plank of the party platform that calls for abortion to be outlawed.
"We need a platform that is going to respect differences of opinion
if we're going to get Republicans elected," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It was classic Riordan, a man who touts himself as a "nonpartisan
problem-solver" similar to the pitch he made when he first won
elective office in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's approach to government was shaped by his years as an
attorney and leveraged buyout specialist--and only later, as a
political power in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan moved into elective politics in 1993 by running for the
Los Angeles mayor's office as a can-do businessman, becoming the
first in a series of big-city 1990s mayors who were largely
non-ideological. If Riordan becomes the next governor of California,
he will break similarly new ground.</TE>
<TE>   "You get less of a tendency to get candidates from that [business]
wing. That tends to be the wing that provides the money," said Jack
Pitney, who once worked for the Republican National Committee and now
teaches politics at Claremont McKenna College. "That's probably
because we have a much stronger ideological tradition in this state
than elsewhere, probably a much more active ... conservative wing."</TE>
<TE>   That is the wing represented by Bill Simon.</TE>
<TE>   On the surface, Riordan and Simon, who are friends, seem similar.
Both are millionaires who pledge to bring their business acumen to
elected office.</TE>
<TE>   But Simon's appeals in the primary have been threaded with a far
more conservative ideology, in both the intellectual and partisan
sense of the word. Not only does he call himself "a proud,
conservative Republican," Simon also likes to refer to himself "the
candidate of ideas."</TE>
<TE>   Simon's initial experience with government, too, was different
than Riordan's. His father was a financier who was appointed U.S.
secretary of the treasury by President Nixon. He views politics
through economic policy and the law--and that is reflected in his
emphases in the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Courting the Party's Intellectual Wing</TE>
<TE>   Since he announced his run for governor last year, Simon, who has
lived in California since 1990, has courted the GOP's intellectual
wing. A former board member of the conservative Heritage Foundation
in Washington, D.C., he cites support from members of conservative
California think tanks, including the Hoover Institution at Stanford
and the Reason Foundation in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, he announced the endorsement of former U.S. Rep. Jack
Kemp, a darling of the party's intellectuals.</TE>
<TE>   Although he agrees with much of the state's conservative base on
emotional issues such as abortion, gun control and crime, Simon has
chosen to focus on the drier topics of infrastructure, water and
budgets in his campaign stops. He pushes key planks of Republican
orthodoxy, such as a capital gains tax cut, and was the first to vow
to never raise taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Occupying the space between the business and ideological wings is
Jones, the small-town farmer turned career politician.</TE>
<TE>   Jones grew up surrounded by a different aspect of politics than
his two multimillionaire challengers. His initiation was into the
practical, workaday world of local and state elective politics.</TE>
<TE>   Jones--as the candidate proudly tells GOP audiences--was the
Fresno County chairman of Young Republicans for Nixon. Over time,
Jones worked his way up from freshman assemblyman to majority leader
to secretary of state. It is the sort of resume that has dominated
the Republicans in Sacramento in the past, including the party's last
two gubernatorial candidates--Dan Lungren and Pete Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his career in the corridors of power, however, Jones
retains a populist edge. He reminds people that he still spends time
on his family farm, and punctuates his campaign speeches with the
words, "Now, folks...." He jumps on Sacramento scandals, especially
those that he alleges show the influence of special interest money on
the Davis administration. He prides himself as being plain-spoken:
"When you are straight with the people, they'll give you the benefit
of the doubt," he told a group of community college administrators
this week, in a standard line.</TE>
<TE>   And Jones is one of the state's most vocal elected champions of
campaign finance reform, a factor in the meager fund-raising in his
gubernatorial bid. In that manner, Pitney says, Jones continues the
populist GOP tradition in California embodied by past governors such
as Earl Warren.</TE>
<TE>   But Jones has been fairly quiet about his campaign reform stance.
That leaves him running on his long career of service to the party
and knowledge of how to get things done in Sacramento. The danger is
that those qualifications--the foundations of Republican candidacies
for the last decade--may not be enough to win the nomination this
time around.</TE>

<LD>A pointed critique of the government's handling of the Klamath water
crisis has become Exhibit A in a tug of war over the federal
Endangered Species Act.</LD>
<LD>   The National Academy of Sciences document questioned the
scientific basis for federal regulators' dramatic decision last
summer to slash water to farmers in the broad, flat Klamath Basin in
an effort to protect endangered fish.</LD>
<LD>   From agriculture fields to the halls of Congress, opponents of the
Endangered Species Act--a cornerstone of the nation's environmental
laws--figured they had found their smoking gun. The report, they
concluded, showed that federal wildlife agencies used junk science to
unfairly favor endangered salmon and suckerfish over farmers. In it,
they found proof of the need for broad reform.</LD>
<TE>   Environmentalists counter that the findings have been twisted by
spin artists in the Bush administration, which is eager to help
beleaguered farmers and other rural industries hemmed in by
environmental restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the scientists on the 12-member National Academy panel
expressed dismay that their report is being used to wage war on
biologists at the National Marine Fisheries Service and U.S. Fish and
Wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   But damage has been done. Stewards of the Endangered Species Act
are running scared, fearful for their jobs and reputations.</TE>
<TE>   For them, the fracas offers new and disturbing evidence that the
Bush administration has little regard for its own government
scientists.</TE>
<TE>   The Klamath report "is certainly going to embolden challengers to
take on the evidence, to question the science," said Dan Tarlock, a
law professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law.</TE>
<TE>   Already, fallout is spreading.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Sen. Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) and Rep. Richard W.
Pombo (R-Tracy) have introduced bills proposing tighter scrutiny of
the biology behind endangered species rulings. Rep. Wally Herger
(R-Marysville) has proposed dragging federal wildlife officials
before congressional committees.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Rep. Calvin M. Dooley (D-Visalia) asked Interior
Secretary Gale Norton to push for a National Academy of Sciences
review of hamstrung irrigation deliveries to the Central Valley,
where the endangered Delta smelt has bedeviled farmers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's reprehensible when junk science is used to put farmers out
of business," Rep. John E. Peterson (R-Pa.) said. Federal land-use
decisions should be based "on sound science and not political
agendas."</TE>
<TE>   What remains to be seen is whether Congress and the administration
will work in earnest to draft a solution to the Klamath crisis. Few
inside the Washington beltway are offering predictions.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers, meanwhile, have already launched a billion-dollar lawsuit
against the federal government charging that it unfairly seized their
water. Insiders say the National Academy report could provide them
with valuable ammunition.</TE>
<TE>   The fight in the Klamath Basin, a fertile mix of farms and
wildlife refuges straddling the border of Oregon and California,
erupted in earnest during last year's drought.</TE>
<TE>   In April, federal regulators announced steep irrigation cuts,
diverting water to help two rare suckerfish species in Upper Klamath
Lake and the threatened coho salmon downstream.</TE>
<TE>   In a tense, summer-long showdown, anti-government protesters and
western land-rights advocates rushed into Klamath to support farmers
in the basin, which suffered a $130-million economic loss.</TE>
<TE>   Protesters Restored Flow of Water</TE>
<TE>   On several occasions, protesters stormed the main irrigation
canal, prying open its steel gate in an act of civil disobedience.
When local law officers wouldn't step in, federal agents began
patrolling the gates around the clock, adding to the tension.</TE>
<TE>   A solid winter snowfall and the prospect of more abundant water
seemed to cool tempers. But the report from the National Research
Council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, has fanned the
debate anew heading into the spring planting season.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the Endangered Species Act have focused on a key
finding: Wildlife biologists had "no substantial scientific
foundation" for irrigation cutbacks to maintain higher lake levels
and river flows for the fish.</TE>
<TE>   The report "exposed flawed decisions," said Rep. Greg Walden, an
Oregon Republican who represents the Klamath region. "Simply put, the
government got it wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the key wildlife agencies were mostly mute in their
own defense. "We're not commenting on the report," said Megan Durham,
chief of public affairs for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   But environmentalists have rushed to their aid, contending that
the National Academy report failed to consider the work of wildlife
agencies in the proper context.</TE>
<TE>   Under the law, wildlife biologists make recommendations based on
the best available science, said law professor Tarlock. "A lot of
times, the actual science behind these decisions is very subtle and
it's open to legitimate dispute."</TE>
<TE>   Jamie Rappaport Clark, director of the Fish and Wildlife Service
during the last years of the Clinton administration, worried that any
effort to paint her former peers as "a bunch of combat biologists
trying to undermine a healthy economy" could hurt endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no such thing as complete science," she said. "You do the
best you can based on all the science out there."</TE>
<TE>   Several scientists on the National Academy panel also came to the
defense of the wildlife agencies. William Lewis, chairman of the
National Research Council committee, said the report should not be
seen as an indictment. Further study may prove that biologists were
right in calling for more water to protect the fish, and hence less
for farmers, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're taking a beating and that's not fair," said Lewis, a
University of Colorado professor of environmental science. In fact,
though the report faulted the science used to justify more water for
fish and less for farmers, it said all other aspects of the
biologists' work had "good scientific or technical support."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis said the scientific panel "found their work was generally
impressive."</TE>
<TE>   The National Academy panelists noted that several recommended
measures to help fish haven't been carried out.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the Bureau of Reclamation that oversees water
distribution still hasn't installed a screen to keep fish from being
sucked into the main canal that delivers irrigation water to Klamath
farmers. The screen was required by federal wildlife regulators in
1992.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten years to design a fish screen is a little ridiculous," said
Steve Pedery, a spokesman for WaterWatch of Oregon. "NASA can design
satellites in less time than that."</TE>
<TE>   Plans Chronically Late, Activists Say</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists also say the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation has been
chronically late in delivering assessments of its annual operational
plans, shrinking the 135-day window for study by federal biologists.
Over the last two years, environmental groups have launched or
threatened lawsuits to accelerate delivery of the plans.</TE>
<TE>   A final draft of this year's assessment isn't expected until late
this week. That would give biologists less than 45 days before the
April 1 start of irrigation season to complete their review--roughly
one third of the time specified in federal guidelines. Such tight
deadlines can put further strain on federal biologists in two federal
agencies already hampered by funding and staffing shortages.</TE>
<TE>   Though they have criticized the bureau in the past over the
delays, officials at the National Marine Fisheries Service and Fish
and Wildlife declined to comment last week.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff McCracken, a Bureau of Reclamation spokesman, said his agency
has worked cooperatively for years with wildlife biologists. Last
year, planning was complicated by the drought, he said. This year
bureau officials in Washington toiled over a more ambitious 10-year
plan, which has been ripped by environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   Fish Screen Poses a 'Design Challenge'</TE>
<TE>   As for the fish screens, McCracken said the bureau has budgeted $3
million. The key barrier will be in place next year.</TE>
<TE>   He said delays were caused as engineers attempted to devise a
screen that wouldn't kill fish.</TE>
<TE>   "There was," he said, "a design challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Even when in place, such fixes fall short of the comprehensive
approach others suggest is needed to cure Klamath's ills. Timber
operations and farming upstream and downstream from the Klamath
irrigation project cause problems but haven't been dragged into the
debate.</TE>
<TE>   Peter B. Moyle, a UC Davis fisheries biologist who served on the
National Academy panel, suggested the sort of approach that has
played out in recent years in the Central Valley, where the state and
federal governments joined in a process dubbed CalFed.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone declares a truce and tries to work together to find
answers and solutions," he said, "instead of resorting to
name-calling and lawsuits."</TE>

<HD>Parks Defends Record on Crime, Consent Decree</HD>
<DH>Police: Chief says it is difficult to recruit officers
because there's a tight labor market and at least half fail polygraph
test.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY and MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his monthly meeting with reporters Friday, Los Angeles Police
Chief Bernard C. Parks took after what he called misinformation on
various aspects of his record, particularly crime trends, a federal
consent decree mandating reforms, and recruitment of officers.</LD>
<LD>   Parks faces an uncertain future as the city's Police Commission
weighs whether to reappoint him for a second term. The question
became highly charged this week when Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn
came out publicly in opposition to Parks' request for a second
five-year term.</LD>
<LD>   Parks' regularly scheduled press appearance fell the day after
Hahn met with numerous supporters in the San Fernando Valley who are
angry with the chief over community policing.</LD>
<TE>   Parks argued, as he has in the past, that although the crime rate
has gone up slightly over the last year or so, the more meaningful
way to interpret such statistics is by looking at long-term trends.
By this measure, he said, "we are better off than we were in the
1970s."</TE>
<TE>   Rather than fueling criticism, long-term crime trends should make
people "pleased and proud and singing the praises of all those
involved," he said, adding that media focus on high-profile crimes
and short-term trends makes "officers believe they are failures....
They are not failures."</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Parks said it was important to get "proper information
out" on the federal consent decree. Inadequate progress on carrying
out consent-decree reforms is among the charges Hahn has leveled
against Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Parks told reporters that the Police Department had moved to carry
out the federally mandated reforms even before the consent decree was
signed, and said the department has been praised by other city
officials for its quick work. "I don't know how anyone could
criticize this department, particularly myself, for the consent
decree," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On recruiting, Parks argued that factors outside his control have
made it more difficult for the LAPD to expand its ranks. These
include the city's slow adoption of his recommended changes to the
pension system, a tight labor market for police officers nationwide,
and higher standards for recruits, he said. A new polygraph test, for
example, eliminates half of all applicants, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is not an unlimited reservoir of people who not only want
to be police officers, but who are qualified to be police officers,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Responding later in the day, Hahn spokesman Matt Middlebrook
reiterated the mayor's contention that the facts on crime and
recruitment favor the mayor's view. "Let me tell you: Violent crime
is up 17.3% over the last two years," Middlebrook said. "That is a
fact. The department has lost more than 1,000 officers over the last
two years. It appears that the city attorney and the police chief
will accept a C-minus grade with regard to implementation of the
consent decree. The mayor is unwilling to accept anything [but]
straight A's."</TE>
<TE>   The consent decree has scores of requirements. The city has not
met every one, but the city's representatives in the legal proceeding
have maintained that overall progress has been reasonable, and the
court has issued no sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   But Middlebrook said the mayor holds that nothing less than
absolute compliance is acceptable.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as I'm concerned, the consent decree is the floor in terms
of reform," Hahn said. "I want us to be the model for police reform
in the nation. We have to do at least that much."</TE>

<HD>'Green' Power Providers Feel Left Out in the Cold</HD>
<DH>Electricity: State officials encouraged renewable energy,
then largely shunned it during the crisis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For an energy-starved state, the plan amounted to spinning gold from
straw.</LD>
<LD>   At an Orange County-owned landfill, methane gas from decomposing
garbage could produce enough electricity to keep the lights blazing
and air conditioners humming in thousands of homes.</LD>
<LD>   But when Ridgewood Power embraced the state's call this past year
for more energy, there was an unexpected hitch at the end of the
road.</LD>
<TE>   "Believe it or not," a company executive recently wrote the
governor, "we have a fully operational renewable-energy power plant
and nowhere to sell the electricity."</TE>
<TE>   What's more, if Ridgewood does not make electricity out of the
methane brewing underground, the county may have to spend as much as
$1 million to flare it off and keep the gas from polluting the air.</TE>
<TE>   Ridgewood is far from alone among companies that turn the sun,
wind, orchard prunings and other renewable resources into electricity
for a price. These green power providers were virtually shut out of
the state's emergency response to the energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Despite policies and statements espousing renewable energy,
officials instead opted to buy from big companies because they could
quickly supply high volumes of natural gas-fired electricity and help
keep the lights on.</TE>
<TE>   And now that the state has created a power authority to help build
billions of dollars in renewable-energy supplies, the agency finds
itself hamstrung by California's fiscal problems and powerless to
sign new contracts.</TE>
<TE>   The companies left hanging say they feel betrayed.</TE>
<TE>   "All California government officials have terrific sound bites:
'We need renewable power. It does not pollute. It provides diversity
[of fuel sources]' and 'It's good for the state,'" said Jonathan
Weisgall, vice president of Cal Energy, a geothermal electricity
generator in Imperial County. "But their actions are contradicting
their words.... California is on the verge of a renewable-energy
blackout."</TE>
<TE>   For years, the state's utilities have been required to purchase
some green energy on behalf of consumers. But green power is
generally more expensive than electricity from gas-fired plants,
especially in the early years when capital costs are highest.</TE>
<TE>   As major utilities saw hard financial times during the energy
crisis, many of the renewable-power companies went unpaid for months,
and some sought to be freed of their contracts so they could sell
power on the open market, where prices had become higher.</TE>
<TE>   For a time it had seemed the crisis would open the door for new
green power plants. State officials touted renewable energy as a way
to help insulate California from the volatile natural gas markets.
New plants would create jobs and help the environment. And officials
said improved technology and subsidies are making green energy prices
more competitive, especially over the long haul, because the fuel is
free or very inexpensive.</TE>
<TE>   State's Actions Did Not Match Its Words</TE>
<TE>   But policies and endorsements never translated into much progress:</TE>
<TE>   * When the Department of Water Resources became the power buyer
for the state's two largest utilities a year ago, the agency had a
legislative mandate to acquire as much green energy as possible. But
state auditors recently found that only about 2% of its $43 billion
in power contracts went to green producers.</TE>
<TE>   * One mission of the new Consumer Power and Conservation Financing
Authority is boosting the portion of renewable energy in the state's
power inventory from 12% to 17% by 2006. But the authority still has
no way to finance or buy renewable-energy plants.</TE>
<TE>   * Although the California Energy Commission has awarded $240
million in subsidies since 1998 to help promote green power
development, the vast majority has not been paid out because
developers don't have their facilities up and running. And that
probably won't happen unless someone first wants to buy the
electricity.</TE>
<TE>   These twists were startling in a state that claims to be a
national leader in developing a green power industry over the last
two decades. They came as the governor and others sang the praises of
alternatives to gas-fired power plants.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps no one sang louder than S. David Freeman, the state energy
czar who once headed the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power
and other major utilities.</TE>
<TE>   Building renewable-energy supplies is a matter of homeland
security, he said, because California needs domestic energy supplies
that are relatively protected from the winds of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "Most oil reserves are in countries that harbor terrorism," he
said in a recent interview. "And what are we going to do when we come
to that stage of the war on terrorism?"</TE>
<TE>   Freeman, a longtime alternative-energy advocate, was the advisor
to Gov. Gray Davis who negotiated some of the long-term power
contracts last year.</TE>
<TE>   But a report by the state auditor in December found that
green-energy contracts accounted for only 230 of the 12,000 megawatts
the state water department committed to buy in the peak year of 2004.
The auditor also found that the average price of green energy was
slightly less than what the department paid for nonrenewable
electricity.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite the legislative mandate to secure as much renewable power
as possible, the department ... missed a significant opportunity to
add environmentally friendly power," the report concluded.</TE>
<TE>   So what happened? Producers of green energy lost out, Freeman
said, because they were a "cottage industry" that didn't have enough
strong proposals assembled.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't because we stiff-armed them or ignored them," he said.
"But I had a job to do--put a fire out--and I had to use what water I
had. I think we did a hell of a job, but it left the renewables out."</TE>
<TE>   Since the mid-1980s, Ridgewood Power of New Jersey has operated a
5-megawatt generating plant at the Olinda Alpha Landfill in Brea,
near nurseries, an oil field and a new housing tract. As the energy
crisis unfolded, the company built a 2.5-megawatt plant, and it plans
to boost its capacity by 7.5 megawatts--enough for about 10,000
homes.</TE>
<TE>   Ridgewood obtained expedited permits and approvals for the
2.5-megawatt facility.</TE>
<TE>   But the company still struck out: It got no state price subsidy
and no state or utility contract. It has only a nonbinding letter of
intent for purchase of electricity by the power authority with a
purchase option.</TE>
<TE>   "The California Energy Commission, the power authority and you
'pumped us up' and encouraged us to forge ahead with the construction
of a renewable-energy power plant," Executive Vice President Martin
V. Quinn wrote Davis on Dec. 11. "Now that the plant is fully
constructed and ready for operation, the state has 'pulled the plug'
and is not giving us the support they promised. This is not good
public policy!"</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Could Pay Up to $1 Million</TE>
<TE>   The lack of power outlets complicates matters for Orange County,
which owns the landfill and receives 18% royalties from the
electricity sales.</TE>
<TE>   Landfill manager Dave Lowry said the county will have to find a
way to cleanly dispose of excess methane gas if another power plant
is not built within two or three years. Building a system to flare
off the gas could cost as much as $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials said the state responded to the letter and is
trying to help them find a buyer, but President Bob Swanson said he's
not banking on it.</TE>
<TE>   "For this energy to receive this type of treatment ... will have
an extreme chilling effect on other renewable projects in the state,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman voiced frustration that as chief of the state power
authority formed last summer, he has not yet been able to start
bankrolling renewable-energy operations.</TE>
<TE>   By mid-October, the authority had signed letters of intent with
dozens of companies, including Ridgewood, and was poised to sign
contracts for as much as 3,000 megawatts. But Freeman broke the bad
news at an Oct. 19 board meeting:</TE>
<TE>   The power authority could not sell $5 billion in bonds to finance
its work until the state sold more than $12 billion in bonds to pay
for electricity purchases.</TE>
<TE>   Both offerings have been in limbo because the state water
department and Public Utilities Commission could not agree on how the
financing should be structured. But officials agreed on the financing
last week,which could clear the way for the bond sales later this
year.</TE>
<TE>   PUC President Loretta M. Lynch said the real problem is that
California already has bought too much power.</TE>
<TE>   She said one option is for water department contracts to be
renegotiated so the state will acquire less fossil-fueled
electricity, freeing up dollars for renewable energy.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want all this excess power and to buy additional power,"
she said. "It's not fair to consumers."</TE>
<TE>   The PUC has asked utilities and others to come up with plans for
including renewable energy in future electricity procurement.</TE>
<TE>   For the sake of the environment, Freeman hopes the roadblocks are
cleared soon.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's crucial that it begin in the next few months," he
said. "The air quality in most communities is not healthy, and we
don't have room in the air for more pollution."</TE>
<TE>   Each year, dozens of biomass plants turn 6 million tons of orchard
waste into electricity, reducing the amount burned in California's
fields.</TE>
<TE>   Sierra Forest Products of Delano, for example, produced enough
power for thousands of homes during the energy crisis. But, without a
long-term contract, the company could not afford to operate and was
about to lay off its staff. The plant got a temporary reprieve
recently when it and nine other biomass facilities received
three-month contracts from the state water department.</TE>
<TE>   "We came up because we thought there was a need for power," said
General Manager Ken Duysen. "But if we can't pay our bills, we are
prepared to shut it down."</TE>
<TE>   Oak Creek Energy Systems, a wind farm in the Tehachapi Mountains,
plans to add capacity to produce 115 megawatts, but it can't get
financing without a power contract.</TE>
<TE>   "Lots of wind projects in the offing are held up," said company
President Harold Romanowitz.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 60 of the 73 renewable-power projects that have won
subsidies from the Energy Commission have yet to begin operation.</TE>
<TE>   But Marwan Masri, manager of the commission's program, said the
poor market for renewable energy "is a short-term crisis."</TE>
<TE>   He said he expects the market to improve as utilities become
credit-worthy again, the power authority is able to sell bonds and
the recession eases.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, he said, "We're very concerned."</TE>

<LD>California's school buses are among the nation's most polluting, says
a study by the Union of Concerned Scientists.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly half of the state's 24,190 buses don't have to meet
air-quality standards because they are more than 10 years old,
according to the Cambridge, Mass.-based environmental advocacy group.</LD>
<LD>   California's average school bus discharges the same amount of
particulates in a year as 170 cars, the report says.</LD>
<TE>   California Air Resources Board spokesman Jerry Martin disagreed
with the conclusions, saying the state has allocated $66 million to
improve or replace buses over the past two years.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pharmacia Corp. said a key experimental cancer drug obtained in its
$650-million purchase of biotech firm Sugen had proved ineffective, a
setback for medicines meant to starve tumors by shutting off their
blood supply.</LD>
<LD>   The Peapack, N.J.-based firm said an analysis of a late-stage
trial showed the drug, called SU5416, was not effective among
patients with colorectal cancer that had spread to other parts of the
body.</LD>
<LD>   Pharmacia said it also was ending studies of the drug in a wide
range of other tumors, including lung, breast and AIDS-related
Kaposi's sarcoma.</LD>
<TE>   The intravenously given medicine was the crown jewel of Sugen, the
California biotech firm Pharmacia bought in 1999 that developed the
synthetic compound. It is designed to block receptors for one of the
hottest targets in oncology, a protein called vascular endothelial
growth factor.</TE>

<LD>U.S. wholesale inventories fell in December to the lowest level in
two years, a sign that factories may have to increase production to
meet future demand.</LD>
<LD>   The 0.6% decrease in stockpiles to $288.2 billion followed a
November decline of 1.3% that was larger than estimated, the Commerce
Department said. Inventories have been falling since June, and the
December level was the lowest since January 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Wholesaler sales fell 0.4% in December after being unchanged in
November. The inventory-to-sales ratio, a measure of the time goods
sit unsold in wholesaler warehouses and lots, nonetheless fell in
December to 1.29 months, the lowest since February 2001, from 1.3
months in November.</LD>
<TE>   Compared with a year earlier, December inventories were down 5.3%,
the largest decline in nine years of record keeping. Sales dropped 1%
in all of 2001, also the biggest decline.</TE>

viewing at a local funeral home. Money to send them home came from a
state program that provides victims of crime with funeral benefits.</LD>
<LD>   "In life, they were always together. The family wanted them in
death to be together," said Omar Gallarzo, director of Funeraria
Latina Familiar in Santa Ana, which organized Friday's wake and
rosary. About 200 people, mostly restaurant co-workers, attended the
service in Santa Ana, just miles from where the men were shot Feb. 1.</LD>
<TE>   They died the next day.</TE>
<TE>   Javier, 36, a dishwasher, and Salvador, 32, a cook, had just left
their jobs at Hometown Buffet and were in their car about 11 p.m.
when they were shot in the restaurant parking lot at 17th Street and
East Lincoln Avenue, witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   Their Ford Mustang coasted through the lot and hit a tree.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the men's deaths were not related to gangs or drugs.
Co-workers said robbery does not appear to have been a motive either;
neither man's wallet was taken.</TE>
<TE>   "In cases like this anything is possible. Obviously robbery was
not an issue, and there was no gang affiliation," said Santa Ana
Police Officer Mario Corona.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are still interviewing those who had contact with
the brothers.</TE>
<TE>   They have some leads, but Corona would not be more specific.</TE>
<TE>   "They were not victims of opportunity," Corona said. "Someone set
out to kill them. It is unusual to be killed the way they were
without someone knowing what went on."</TE>
<TE>   The Parra brothers, who came to Orange County seven years ago,
spoke little English and lived frugally so they could provide for
their families, whom they visited in Mexico every two years, said
brother Omar Parra, 25.</TE>
<TE>   Both sent $200 home to Mexico every two weeks from their $500
paychecks.</TE>
<TE>   Their younger brother said he will quit his restaurant job in
Santa Ana and return to the family's farm in the settlement of Piedra
Iman.</TE>
<TE>   There, he said, he will grow corn, beans and tomatoes. He will not
make as much money, he said, but will feel better when he is near his
six other siblings.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel comfortable here anymore," he said.</TE>

<LD>Half a dozen police in riot gear were called to the Fullerton College
campus this week when a 20-year-old student tried to burn an American
flag on campus.</LD>
<LD>   After Parham Khoshbakht set the flag on fire shortly after 10 a.m.
Thursday, a crowd gathered and several students tried to take the
flag away from him, said Fullerton Police Sgt. Steve Johnson.</LD>
<LD>   He had written on his bare chest, "Liberty or death."</LD>
<TE>   Officers took Khoshbakht to the police station briefly for his own
protection and to keep the situation from turning violent, Johnson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Khoshbakht later met with Richard Ramirez, dean of student
affairs.</TE>
<TE>   No charges were pressed against Khoshbakht, since he was
exercising his right to freedom of speech. Ramirez said he told
Khoshbakht that he should have applied for permission to hold a
demonstration in the free-speech section of the quad.</TE>

<LD>John Ward, who authorities say operated Orange County's largest
methamphetamine ring--an enterprise that sometimes grossed more than
$1 million a week--was sentenced this week to life without parole in
federal prison.</LD>
<LD>   Ward, 31, of Orange, was convicted in October on multiple counts
of narcotics violations and money laundering, and he was stripped of
more than $1 million in cash, jewelry and cars.</LD>
<LD>   During his trial before Judge Gary L. Taylor at U.S. District
Court in Santa Ana, Ward and his defense lawyer said investigators
never found nor seized methamphetamine or cocaine from him and said
he made his income from gambling.</LD>
<TE>   But federal authorities said Ward operated a drug trafficking ring
that earned as much as $10 million between 1996 and 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Kazarian, 37, of Aliso Viejo, a former Orange County deputy
district attorney, pleaded guilty to a drug conspiracy charge and is
scheduled to be sentenced March 18.</TE>

<LD>The Festival of Arts this week paid the city $637,716, or 13.75% of
gross sales, from last year's Festival of Arts and Pageant of the
Masters.</LD>
<LD>   The check, presented to Mayor Wayne Baglin at Tuesday's City
Council meeting, signals agreement between the festival and city over
how much rent the nonprofit organization should pay.</LD>
<LD>   A dispute over the amount resulted in the October 2000 recall of a
majority of the festival's board, which had proposed moving the
popular annual event to San Clemente.</LD>
<TE>   The festival and the city are now negotiating a new lease.</TE>

<HD>Schools' Shortfall Inspires Parents</HD>
<DH>Education: Activists in Irvine, Saddleback raise funds as
the districts make millions in cuts. Some officials hope to stem
absenteeism that reduces state money.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Parents in two large Orange County school districts that are facing
drastic budget cuts are being asked to erase some of the shortfall by
either reaching into their wallets or by making sure their kids show
up in class.</LD>
<LD>   In Irvine, a massive e-mail campaign started by a group of parents
in January is asking for $100 for each of the district's 24,000
students to help make up for some of the more than $5 million in
recent cuts.</LD>
<LD>   A similar fund-raising effort in the Saddleback Valley Unified
schools is seeking $50 from each district family in the wake of
$8million in cuts that eliminated 186 nonteaching jobs and popular
music and science programs.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, Saddleback administrators have mailed letters to
parents, making them aware that student absences--even excused
ones--cost the district millions in state funding.</TE>
<TE>   The separate pleas illustrate the scramble for dollars that's
going on in school districts across California, as tight budgets lead
to program cuts and layoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in the education business 36 years. When I started
teaching, it never would have crossed my mind that I would be sending
out such a letter," said Jack Clement, principal of Saddleback's El
Toro High School.</TE>
<TE>   "But we live in a different era."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, absenteeism cost the Saddleback district $6.1 million
in state money.</TE>
<TE>   Each time a student is absent from El Toro, for instance, it costs
the school $36.40.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, El Toro had a robust 96% attendance rate, yet lost
$191,771 from the state.</TE>
<TE>   "That last 4% is very crucial nowadays," Clement said.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine Unified School District last month closed an elementary
school, cut science, art and music programs and increased some class
sizes to balance its budget.</TE>
<TE>   Teacher layoffs may come next.</TE>
<TE>   Those cuts--particularly the elimination of smaller classes in
kindergarten and second and third grades--spurred a group of parents
to begin yet another Irvine schools fund-raising drive.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a groundswell by some folks, a groundswell of support
by people who wanted to do something," said Tim Shaw, executive
director of the Irvine Public Schools Foundation, who will accept the
funds and distribute them in a grant.</TE>
<TE>   "These are just parents and concerned people in the community who
don't want to see the level of education in Irvine damaged.</TE>
<TE>   "They've mobilized, and they have a lot of energy."</TE>
<TE>   So far, Shaw said the foundation has taken in more than
$12,000--including $7,000 from one PTA at a district Montessori
school.</TE>
<TE>   An additional $10,000 has been collected through the fund-raiser's
initial wave of e-mails, said Lita Robinow, an organizer of the
fund-raiser. Next week, a postal mailing of 6,000 letters should
bring in more contributions, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think $2.4 million is a long way away," Robinow said.</TE>
<TE>   "But if the public sees that there's a lot of support, then it
will draw more support....</TE>
<TE>   "People are horrified with what has happened because of these
cuts. We've been working every second on this. It's only just begun."</TE>

<HD>John Wayne Traffic Returning to Normal</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Airport nears pre-Sept. 11 passenger level, with
count for January down only 2.8% from 2001.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The number of passengers and flights at John Wayne Airport inched
ever closer to normal in the fifth month since the terrorist attacks
but remained slightly lower than last year, according to a monthly
report released Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The latest statistics show 552,496 passengers traveled through the
airport in January, 2.8% fewer than the same period a year ago. The
6,959 commercial flights were a 3.5% drop from January 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Airport officials said they are encouraged by the small but steady
strides that have been made since the Sept. 11 hijackings that left
passengers nationwide afraid to fly. The number of passengers passing
through the airport plunged by about one-third in September.</LD>
<TE>   "Every month our numbers are getting better and better," airport
spokeswoman Ann McCarley said. "People are starting to fly more and
more. We're not doing that bad."</TE>
<TE>   Like other regional airports, John Wayne is faring better than
larger counterparts such as Los Angeles International, where
cumbersome new security measures deter passengers.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen less impact," McCarley said.</TE>
<TE>   Commuter travel took the biggest hit, with the number of flights
dropping last month to 517, a 44% decrease from the same month last
year.</TE>
<TE>   McCarley and commuter carriers downplayed the sharp decline,
noting that United Express cut its service to Los Angeles nearly in
half, from 15 round-trip flights to eight, in October.</TE>
<TE>   David Clark, a spokesman for Sky West, which represents shuttle
carriers at John Wayne, said demand has been steady since United
slashed its flights.</TE>
<TE>   "The cuts that took place were in direct response to what happened
in September," he said. "We've found that since we've made the
change, there doesn't seem to be a need for an increase [in flights].
But there doesn't seem to be a need for a cut either."</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, county supervisors have required the airport to
file monthly reports, including passenger volume, flight operations
and security costs.</TE>
<TE>   In December, officials estimated the airport's loss as a result of
the attacks at $10.4 million for 2001-02. To help recover, they
proposed increasing parking rates and rents for hangars and aircraft
storage.</TE>

<HD>Giving Black History Month a Voice</HD>
<DH>Culture: Song and dance are part of the offerings at
Afro-Centric Marketplace in Simi Valley, just one of many events
countywide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZIE ST. JOHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As vice president of the Simi Valley-based Afro-Centric Committee,
Ida Magitt anxiously awaits each February when Black History Month is
observed.</LD>
<LD>   Magitt helps organize Ventura County's annual Afro-Centric
Marketplace at Mountain Gate Plaza in Simi Valley. Now in its eighth
year, the event features African-inspired clothing, jewelry, cultural
dancing, gospel singing and educational literature.</LD>
<LD>   The marketplace is held from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. the first Saturday
in March to wrap up the area's cultural activities.</LD>
<TE>   "It's just sad to me that it has to be designated as Black History
Month," Magitt said. "A lot of people don't realize all of the
contributions that African Americans have made. It should be
integrated into our regular history of the United States."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the March 2 marketplace, schools, churches and
organizations in the county are celebrating Black History Month by
presenting artists and academics, television personalities and gospel
rappers along with speech contests and concerts.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, a New York-based husband-and-wife singing duo, Kim and
Reggie Harris, will wrap up a West Coast tour at Ventura's Church of
Religious Science.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week the couple entertained hundreds of
schoolchildren at the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza with
back-to-back performances of "Music and the Underground Railroad."
Through songs, stories and slides, the youngsters learned about the
history of black slaves and their journey to freedom.</TE>
<TE>   "It's amazing because the audience claps and sings and the kids
really get in to it," said Kim Harris, who with her husband also
conducted a workshop this week called "Dream Alive--A Celebration of
Black History for Teachers" that provided educators with ideas and
tools for using theater to teach African American history.</TE>
<TE>   At Oxnard College, the cultural calendar includes a lunchtime talk
by television's Judge Joe Brown on Monday and a Feb. 20 lecture by
academic counselor Ron Jackson, who will examine how standardized
psychological tests are used to justify placing young African
American males in special education classes and the social and
psychological damage that results.</TE>
<TE>   "A significant number of African American males are being
diagnosed as learning-disabled after taking these tests," said
Jackson, a sociology instructor at Oxnard College.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of trying to mainstream these kids and looking at their
environment to see if anything can be modified, they are placed in
special ed. Once you have that negative stereotype, it becomes a
self-fulfilling prophecy."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said America needs to address this problem by asking
penetrating questions and demanding solutions.</TE>
<TE>   "My premise is that every day is about African American history,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Elementary schools use February to focus on black authors and hold
assemblies featuring African American music or guest speakers.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard schools have a districtwide competition for fifth- and
sixth-graders to write a four-minute speech on a significant person
or event in the black community.</TE>
<TE>   The winner will be selected Feb. 23.</TE>
<TE>   "The winner presents their speech at next year's Martin Luther
King [Day} celebration," said Michele Dean, the district's manager
for professional development.</TE>
<TE>   "For a lot of kids, it's their first introduction to public
speaking."</TE>

<HD>Crime in Thousand Oaks Falls Again During 2001</HD>
<DH>Report: The city sees a significant drop in the number of
rapes and residential burglaries from a year earlier, but identity
thefts increase.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thousand Oaks' campaign against crime took another step forward last
year, as reported offenses dropped to the point where thieves broke
into just one-third as many homes as they did a decade before and
felony violence plummeted to a fraction of what it had been.</LD>
<LD>   Year-to-year, 2001 was also a success, with major crimes falling
2.8%, or 55 incidents, as rapes declined 55% and residential
burglaries dropped 23%, according to a new Sheriff's Department
report.</LD>
<LD>   This trend, in a community already ranked second safest among the
nation's large cities, hits residents where they live, officials
said.</LD>
<TE>   "These numbers show an impact on the quality of life," said
Sheriff's Cmdr. Keith Parks, who acts as the Thousand Oaks police
chief.</TE>
<TE>   "If people feel safe," he said, "it affects how they react to
people around them. They know it's OK to go to the park in the
evening, for their kids to ride their bikes down the street to a
friend's house or to walk to school in the morning."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Thousand Oaks' 4% reduction in violent crime and 2.4%
drop in burglaries and thefts last year reflected countywide trends.
In the five cities patrolled by the Sheriff's Department--Camarillo,
Moorpark, Fillmore, Ojai and Thousand Oaks--violent and property
crimes dropped slightly.</TE>
<TE>   In 119,000-resident Thousand Oaks, police reported 1,904 serious
crimes in 2001, down from a peak of 3,430 in 1991. The city's crime
rate fell to 15.9 offenses per 1,000 residents last year, off from
32.2 a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   That crime rate will probably leave the white-collar city second
to east county rival Simi Valley, which had a rate of 15.1 last year.
Either Simi Valley or Thousand Oaks has ranked as safest among U.S.
cities with at least 100,000 residents for nearly a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks' low rate translated last year to 170 people robbed,
raped or beaten, down from 390 when violent offenses peaked in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, felony violence dropped again last year compared with the
year before: murders from three to one, rapes from 22 to 10 and
robberies from 37 to 33. Only felony assaults increased, from 115 to
126.</TE>
<TE>   There were far fewer rapes, Parks said, not because of any
particular crime-fighting strategy, but because the number reported
two years ago was double the norm.</TE>
<TE>   "2000 was an aberration," Parks said. "We're back down to a
typical rate."</TE>
<TE>   Young women may also have gotten the message, because of the spate
of date or acquaintance rapes two years ago, that they should not
drink heavily "unless they take with them a designated person to be
sober," Parks said.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the most impressive improvement in 2001 was for home
burglaries, where a 23% decline from 169 incidents to 130 followed a
20% drop the year before.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's just cyclical," Parks said. "A couple of years ago
we may have had a situation where young teens were committing the
crimes, and they just grew out of it, or they were arrested and put
away. With numbers this low, one person can have a major impact."</TE>
<TE>   Improvement may have also come because the Thousand Oaks City
Council added a third officer to the crime prevention unit last year,
Parks said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're spending quite a bit of time working with homeowners and
local businesses," he said. "We've started a home security survey,
and we're training volunteers to go into people's homes to tell them
what they can do to harden the target."</TE>
<TE>   The Thousand Oaks department, with 100 officers, also has 60
community volunteers who work at least two shifts a month at the
resource center, in patrol cars or in the new burglary prevention
unit.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies are also warning businesses to be alert for a trend that
escalated last year--so-called "identity theft," in which a criminal
uses a stolen credit card to commit theft.</TE>
<TE>   Such fraud nearly doubled from 128 offenses to 226 last year,
Parks said.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a situation here at some of the fitness clubs, where
somebody would break into the valuables locker and take credit cards,
and slip in somebody else's," Parks said. "The victims wouldn't
notice until they tried to use the cards."</TE>
<TE>   A thief from Los Angeles, who had been forwarding card numbers to
accomplices in the East, was finally identified in December, Parks
said.</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks' slight drop is good news, but it only reflects the
safety level of eastern Ventura County, Parks said.</TE>
<TE>   "The region as a whole continues to be safer," he said. "That's
driven by people who live here. They're not afraid to call the
police."</TE>

<LD>Luz Elena Bueno Zirion on Friday ended her service as the Mexican
consul in Ventura County and begins a new posting next week in
Orlando, Fla., where she will oversee the consul's office.</LD>
<LD>   Zirion will be replaced by Fernando Gamboa Rosas, who most

the interim, the local consulate will continue to issue visas, ID
cards and other documents.</LD>
<LD>   Zirion, 54, has represented the Mexican government in Ventura,
Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties since 1996. It is common
for diplomats to be transferred after serving several years in one

<HD>Bamieh and Totten in District Attorney Race</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I have just finished reading the letter to the editor by Don Glynn.
Unfortunately, the notions of truthfulness and objectivity are not
prerequisites for the right of free speech.</LD>
<LD>   As with most editorials, there is an underlying motive in Mr.
Glynn's attempt on "setting the record straight." Mr. Glynn correctly
portrayed himself as a retired deputy district attorney for Ventura
County. He failed to mention that he benefits from the current
practice the D.A' s office has of hiring retired attorneys. This
means in addition to Mr. Glynn receiving his retirement benefits, he
is paid a staggering $98 an hour by the district attorney's office as
extra help. At a recent debate of both candidates hosted by the
Prosecutors Assn., Ron Bamieh informed Mr. Glynn that the "gravy
train" would come to an end when Mr. Bamieh was elected to the
office. Mr. Glynn's motivation is clear. He is not concerned about
Mr. Bamieh's record. He is concerned about his pocketbook.</LD>
<TE>   I was present when Mr. Bamieh was notified by his superiors that
the Los Angeles Times had made a request for Mr. Bamieh's trial
record. Knowing the district attorney's office's system of tracking
cases has limitations and because he questioned the motives of the
person assigned to compile the public records act request, Mr. Bamieh
responded directly to the reporter who made the request. Mr. Bamieh
provided a comprehensive record of his felony cases and summaries of
each trial he was responsible for prosecuting. Mr. Bamieh provided
The Times with a list of more than 90 felony cases that required
significant courtroom activity on his part. The list included dates
and summaries of all his notable cases. An objective look at Mr.
Bamieh's cases shows he has never lost a felony trial.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Glynn claims to have relied on a document prepared by the
district attorney's office to substantiate his attack on Mr. Bamieh's
credibility. Mr. Glynn did not mention that the district attorney's
office tracks cases by number and by defendant's name, not by the
assigned attorney. He also failed to mention that he did not check
the more accurate records of the Superior and Municipal courts. I
would hope that an educated man would exhaust all resources before
attempting to "set the record straight" for us all.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Bamieh is known throughout this county as a great trial
attorney, and his record of never losing a felony trial only tells
part of the story. Mr. Bamieh led an investigation that solved an
8-year-old homicide that resulted in a death penalty verdict against
Justin Merriman. Mr. Bamieh obtained that verdict even though the
victim's body was never recovered and there was no physical evidence.
Mr. Bamieh was able to solve the case and obtain the conviction after
two other prosecutors in the district attorney's office failed.</TE>
<TE>   During Mr. Bamieh's investigation and prosecution of Mr. Merriman,
he was able to convict five other gang members, and even Mr.
Merriman's mother, for gang-related crimes. The fact that Mr. Bamieh
also assisted the Sheriff's Department in the successful
investigation and indictments of six other people in another
gang-related slaying, all while the Merriman investigation and trial
were ongoing, represents an incredible and unprecedented effort by a
deputy district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Bamieh's skill has led to some of the most innovative
courtroom techniques and prosecutions in the county. Mr. Bamieh
prosecuted Jose Garcia for the killing of Marsha Lane. He secured
that conviction even though there were no witnesses and the only
physical evidence was the strangled body of the victim. Mr. Bamieh
worked closely with investigators from the Ventura Police Department,
and presented evidence of six other women whom Mr. Garcia had
strangled over a 30-year period. Mr. Bamieh prosecuted this case when
most prosecutors would not take this challenge.</TE>
<TE>   In this highly contested election, accusations will be made in an
attempt to discredit the candidates. Both candidates deserve to be
measured and evaluated by reality, not fiction distorted for personal
gain. Ron Bamieh is an exceptional attorney and a man of integrity. I
cannot remain silent when a friend and co-worker is attacked without
merit.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Volpei</TE>
<TE>   Ventura</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The contest between Greg Totten and Ron Bamieh for the Ventura
County district attorney slot is unlike any I recall in my 37 years
in Ventura. Mr. Totten's campaign is grass-roots and, as I understand
it, the coffers are of Ventura County origin. Mr. Bamieh's war chest
is proudly acknowledged to come from his wealthy father, Sam Bamieh
of San Mateo. Curiously, it appears that the Bamieh camp is concerned
about "insiders" trying to gain influence in the D.A.'s office.</TE>
<TE>   As was reported in the Jan. 25 Los Angeles Times, Ron Bamieh
stated that "People contribute because they want to have some say.
They want access, and I always worry about insiders trying to gain
influence inside the district attorney's office." Cynicism at its
highest! Is it beyond Mr. Bamieh's understanding that the residents
of Ventura County might make donations to a candidate because they
feel he or she is the most capable and trustworthy to do the job?
Those of us supporting Mr. Totten do want a say in the county's
future well-being as a terrific and safe place to live. That is
certainly a motive, but it is not to gain access or to have
influence.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Bamieh seems to have shot himself in the foot! According to
The Times of Jan. 25, Mr. Bamieh rationalizes, saying he won't take
any contributions over $500 from anyone inside Ventura County because
he believes the district attorney should never appear to be beholden
to local political supporters. I guess he forgot that when he was
addressing a gathering of Camarillo Republican Women Federated on
Jan. 28, saying, "We are going to win this election on March 5. Not
only will the county benefit, but our party (Republican) will
benefit." Mr. Totten, also a Republican, avoided any discussion of
partisan politics and was justifiably outraged, emphasizing that the
district attorney is a nonpartisan office where partisan politics
have no place.</TE>
<TE>   It appears that Mr. Bamieh is looking down on us "locals" because
we choose to exercise our civic duty to support the most qualified
candidate, not the one bankrolled by "outsiders." That being the
case, I will certainly let him know in the voting booth that there is

<LD>With more than 90% of California's flyway habitat wetlands destroyed,
the Ormond Beach wetlands rise in significance as a natural homeland
for wildfowl and an example of how nature fashions an ecosystem that
is sustainable.</LD>
<LD>   The genius or inclination of man has never been sufficient to
manufacture a reproduction of a workable ecosystem. Once it has been
destroyed, any chance for future generations to study the ways of
nature is lost forever. Any development that would hinder the
viability of the Ormond Beach wetlands would be a tragedy for Oxnard
and California.</LD>

<LD>Linda Parks gives to our community in both big and small ways. I
first met Linda when she fought to save the Conejo Creek soccer
fields and wrote the parks initiative that protects parkland from
being developed. Her votes on the Thousand Oaks City Council reflect
her strong pro-resident views. Everyone in the Conejo Valley knows
she led the fight to stop urban sprawl with the successful
growth-control measure Save Open Space and Agricultural Resources.</LD>
<LD>   Linda also volunteered at our school's Halloween carnival. She
arranged for us moms to donate pumpkins to the RAIN transitional
living center that serves homeless families in Ventura County, so
that the children could celebrate the holiday. Whether it's being on
our school's site council or hiking with Scouts in Wildwood, Linda is
there.</LD>
<LD>   It's the little things that count, it's been said, and even though
it's nice that equipment from her opponent's company was used in
Operation Desert Storm 10 years ago, I still thank Linda for soccer
games on Saturdays.</LD>
<TE>   I'm voting for Linda Parks for Ventura County supervisor for both
those big and small reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Jackie Ruchman</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Linda Parks asked for my financial support in the race for the
Ventura County supervisor's seat. I gave consideration to that
request but decided instead to support businessman Randy Hoffman.</TE>
<TE>   I support Randy Hoffman because I believe in his integrity, his
business acumen and ability to add opportunities that will enhance
the quality of life in Ventura County. Randy Hoffman is a businessman
and an entrepreneur who supports new enterprise and jobs for the
residents of Ventura County. It is my belief that to create
additional opportunities within the county, we need to add a business
leader to our Board of Supervisors, a successful leader who is in
favor of a more dynamic atmosphere and who can manage the needs of a
growing population.</TE>
<TE>   Being an advocate of low taxes and a believer in
middle-of-the-road conservatism rather than pure liberalism, I, like
all residents, encourage good schools, safe neighborhoods and
integrity within the government.</TE>
<TE>   It is my belief that Randy Hoffman is the right individual to help
move Ventura County forward in an effective way that will be
beneficial to the people of this community. He is someone who is
dedicated to handling the issues that affect our area, which will
result in a safer and better Ventura County for all its citizens.</TE>

<HD>Money for Trains or for Fixing Streets?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Would you prefer more trains or having the potholes in the road
filled? As reported in the newspaper, even with ridership on the
Ventura County Line down last year, the politicians and bureaucrats
plan to spend $13.7 million more on county train stations. Less than
half of the present trains' $8-million yearly operating expenses is
covered by fares. This means each time a passenger boards a train,
the taxpayers are subsidizing the ticket.</LD>
<LD>   There is no question the trains are a great convenience for those
few who work a short distance from a train station. I believe the
millions of dollars spent on trains could be put to better use in
repairing the county highways and roads that are deplorable and in
desperate need of repair. No matter how the politicians and
bureaucrats manipulate the numbers, their claim that trains relieve
the freeways is nonsense.</LD>
<LD>   Now they are going to spend $200,000 more of the taxpayers' money
to do a random poll of about 26,800 households as to why they don't
use, or stopped using, the trains. That is a no-brainer--it is
because the trains do not go when and where the people want/need to
go. Just send me my $7.46 for participation in the poll.</LD>
<TE>   Please note that the numbers mentioned apply only to the Ventura
County Line. However, many millions/billions of taxpayer dollars more
are spent on Metrolink and other California trains with the same
results.</TE>

<HD>School District Agrees on Price for Calabasas Land</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Las Virgenes Unified School District on Friday agreed to pay
$3.25 million for land in Calabasas where the district is building a
much-needed middle school.</LD>
<LD>   The action taken in closed session by the LVUSD Board of Education
settles a yearlong dispute between the district and the owners of the
31-acre parcel over the value of the land.</LD>
<LD>   The owners placed the parcel's value at $5.75 million; a
district-ordered appraisal set the value at $1.25 million.</LD>
<TE>   "We're pleased we have reached a settlement and are looking
forward to moving full steam ahead to provide this school for our
students," district Supt. John Fitzpatrick said.</TE>
<TE>   The new school, which has not been named, will be the third junior
high in the 12,100-student district and the second in Calabasas.
Grading of the site at Mulholland Highway and Paul Revere Drive began
after the district took the property last spring through eminent
domain.</TE>
<TE>   The campus, which is expected to be completed by September 2003,
will have 35 classrooms, a library and a gymnasium. Enrollment at
opening is expected to be 800 students, but the campus' capacity is
1,000.</TE>
<TE>   The school is sorely needed, officials said, to ease crowding at
A.E. Wright Middle School, where 1,700 students attend classes on a
campus built for 1,200.</TE>

<HD>Felix's DJ Duty Merits the Buzz</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since his first hit, "Thee Dawn," 10 years ago, Felix Da Housecat has
run an influential label, Radikal Fear Records, and remixed the likes
of Diana Ross. But until recently, nine out of 10 U.S. music fans
probably had no clue who Felix is.</LD>
<LD>   In the last month, though, Felix, who came out of the legendary
Chicago house music scene, was named one of Rolling Stone magazine's
10 artists to watch in 2002, and his "Kittenz and Thee Glitz" was
named the best album of 2001 by Muzik magazine.</LD>
<LD>   Felix, whose real name is Felix Stallings Jr., rode that wave of
attention into town for a rare appearance Thursday at the Bossa Nova
club in Santa Monica. If he was feeling the pressure of his new buzz,
he certainly didn't let on during his two-hour-plus DJ set.</LD>
<TE>   Displaying a distinctive style that found him almost teasing the
audience with his long buildups, false rises and extended scratch
solos, Felix wove a pastiche of dance music beats from R&amp;B, techno,
house and world music.</TE>
<TE>   Felix, whose own music draws heavily on the '80s, proudly
displayed his influences, playing recognizable hits from that era
such as Prince's "Controversy," the Clash staple "Rock the Casbah"
and a techno remix of Depeche Mode's "Enjoy the Silence." Blended
into his mix, though, the songs bore the distinct Felix imprint.
That's the highest compliment you can pay any DJ.</TE>

<DH>As production on Terry Gilliam's $32-million Don Quixote
film fell apart, a documentary crew was there to capture it all.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID GRITTEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>There was a certain inevitable logic that Terry Gilliam would attempt
to make a film based on Cervantes' 17th century novel "Don Quixote."
He is, after all, one of the most quixotic of directors. Visionary,
impulsive and unpredictable, Gilliam, 61, is a man who chooses to
dream the impossible dream.</LD>
<LD>   He had nursed the idea of a Don Quixote film for more than a
decade but only started shooting it in Spain 16 months ago, when he
believed the script (which he co-wrote with Tony Grisoni) was right
and the budget high enough to accommodate his extravagant visual
ambitions. At $32 million, "The Man Who Killed Don Quixote" was to be
one of the most expensive films ever made solely with European money.
Johnny Depp was to star, along with his girlfriend, the French singer
and actress Vanessa Paradis. The 70-year-old French actor Jean
Rochefort was cast as Quixote.</LD>
<LD>   But six days after shooting began, Gilliam's impossible dream was
in ashes; the production had been visited by a series of disasters
almost biblical in scope.</LD>
<TE>   Rochefort arrived on the set feeling ill. He was suffering from a
prostate infection and was in pain. On the second day of shooting,
Depp and Gilliam were preparing scenes when a flash flood hit the
set, covering props and costumes in mud and even washing some
equipment away. The crew took a day to regroup, but when the rural
landscape in northern Spain dried out, it had turned a different
color; the scenes already shot would not match. Rochefort's health
declined; on the fifth day, he was flown home to Paris and underwent
a double hernia operation. On the sixth day, some of the film's
insurers withdrew their backing.</TE>
<TE>   When films crash and burn in such a fashion, it usually happens
away from the public gaze. But Gilliam had invited Keith Fulton and
Louis Pepe, Los Angeles-based documentary makers, to film the
production and its preliminaries. Their cameras started rolling eight
weeks before Gilliam started principal photography; their aim was to
show how a film like "The Man Who Killed Don Quixote" gets off the
ground. As it was, they were able to chronicle the disintegration of
an expensive movie. The result, a 90-minute documentary called "Lost
in La Mancha," receives its world premiere at Berlinale, Germany's
international film festival, on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew Terry had wanted to make a Quixote film for so long,"
said Fulton, partner with Pepe in the Silver Lake company Low Key
Pictures. "And we felt there was a strong parallel between that and
the story of Don Quixote himself. Terry has been tilting at windmills
for years. Louis and I had been on his sets before, so we knew it
would be a fun ride."</TE>
<TE>   Gilliam became famous as the inspired animator in the Monty Python
troupe, before moving into directing films. When formulating a visual
notion of a film in his head and then trying to capture it on screen,
he often resists budget or time limits.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, he's clashed with studios, producers and
financiers. In 1985, he fought publicly with Universal chief Sid
Sheinberg, who wanted to cut his film "Brazil" by 11 minutes. At one
point, the studio declined to release the movie in its longer form,
so Gilliam organized a special screening for the Los Angeles Film
Critics Assn., which responded by voting it the best film of that
year.</TE>
<TE>   On his flamboyantly visual "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"
(1989), the budget spiraled out of control. And as Fulton and Pepe
showed in their documentary "The Hamster Factor," about the making of
Gilliam's film "Twelve Monkeys" (1995), that set too was often
fraught with dissent and disputes. Still, the debacle of "The Man Who
Killed Don Quixote" was an experience that had nothing to do with
artistic squabbles or clashing temperaments. The events were largely
beyond Gilliam's control.</TE>
<TE>   Shooting "Lost in La Mancha" was a new experience for Fulton and
Pepe. They have shot on film sets before; Low Key Pictures also makes
promotional material about movies, as well as EPKs (electronic press
kits.) "But nothing much happens on most movies," said Fulton. "It's
pretty straightforward stuff." On "The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,"
however, they found themselves documenting an unfolding dramatic
story.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course," said Pepe, "we had no idea going into this that
Terry's film would fall apart."</TE>
<TE>   But fall apart it did, and consequently "Lost in La Mancha" is
compelling. Gilliam, his producers, backers, cast and crew start out
in a spirit of nervous optimism, but are finally dispirited. Some
scenes are vivid: the unfortunate Rochefort, visibly wincing in pain
as he tentatively mounts his horse; the doomed attempts to keep
shooting, foiled by thunder, the noise of F-16s flying from a nearby
military base; and the deluge that flooded the set. It's comparable
to witnessing a traffic accident; one feels for those involved, but
it's almost impossible to look away.</TE>
<TE>   Though Gilliam allowed Fulton and Pepe access to the cast, crew
and stormy production meetings, their film does not flatter him; it
records his colleagues' ambivalent opinions. "With Terry, nothing is
ever simple and plain," sighs Nicola Percorini, the film's Italian
cinematographer. "Making a film with Terry is like riding a pony
bareback," says the first assistant director. And when the producers
call a meeting without Gilliam to announce the film has been
abandoned, an angry crewman snarls at the camera: "Where's the
director?"</TE>
<TE>   "It will interest anyone who wants to know about the creative
process of filmmaking and the fragility of it," said "Lost in La
Mancha's" British producer, Lucy Darwin. "We knew that potentially we
had a great project on our hands, whatever the outcome of Terry's
movie. 'Lost in La Mancha' lasts 90 minutes, but because of the way
things worked out, we shot 100 hours of film." Encouraged by its
acceptance into the Berlin festival, Darwin is hoping for a limited
theatrical release in the U.S., Britain and some European
territories.</TE>
<TE>   Compared to "The Man Who Killed Don Quixote," "Lost in La Mancha"
(narrated by Jeff Bridges, star of Gilliam's "The Fisher King"
[1991]), is modestly budgeted; it cost less than $500,000 and was
independently financed, with Darwin, Fulton and Pepe investing along
with relatives and others. Still, Gilliam likes it enough to go to
Berlin and help publicize it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be reliving the pain and the torture," said Gilliam, who
lives in London. "But I think the film is interesting and revelatory.
It was a diary, with no intention that it should become a Greek
tragedy. But you're watching people die, basically. It's the curse of
Quixote."</TE>
<TE>   He says this because the Cervantes novel has proved hard to film
in the past. Orson Welles made an ill-fated attempt in 1957 but never
managed to complete his film.</TE>
<TE>   Why did Gilliam agree to let Fulton and Pepe record his film
falling apart? "If you do these things, you have to be honest and
open," he said. "And also there's a degree of narcissism involved."
Meaning he's something of a ham when a camera is pointed in his
direction? Gilliam emitted his trademark high-pitched giggle. "That's
an understatement."</TE>
<TE>   An achievement of "Lost in La Mancha" is that it leaves viewers
curious about how "The Man Who Killed Don Quixote" would have turned
out. The good news is that Gilliam still plans to make it: "I've just
been talking to the lawyers for the insurance company. I'm trying to
buy back the rights to it. It would mean a different cast, and new
people involved, but yes, I'd like to do it." He never gives up, does
he? Gilliam sighed. "No. I never learn. I never get any wiser."</TE>

<HD>Maal's Subdued Set Turns Lively</HD>
<DH>The Senegalese performer's remarkable voice and ensemble
raise the energy to create a communal experience.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baaba Maal was hoping to create an intimate, acoustic setting for his
concert at UCLA's Royce Hall on Thursday. Touring in support of his
latest album, "Missing You," which was recorded in outdoor settings
in his native Senegal, he arrived with a small ensemble of guitars,
percussion, hoddu (a small, four-stringed instrument), acoustic bass
and guitar (courtesy of his longtime musical companion, Mansour
Seck).</LD>
<LD>   The evening began in quiet fashion--a marked contrast with the
high-decibel music that had been gushing out of the hall's speaker
system prior to Maal's appearance on stage. Once he arrived, however,
he immediately took command. A highly dramatic presence, wrapped in
aristocratic white garb, he played a few songs accompanied only by
his guitar and the lyre-like kora of Kauding Cissoko.</LD>
<LD>   Other musicians joined them one by one--first Seck, whose presence
always seems to bring a galvanizing energy to Maal's programs, then
percussionist Bahkane Seck, bassist El Hadji Niang and hoddu player
Barou Sall.</LD>
<TE>   It soon became apparent, however, that the concert hall setting
simply wasn't going to approximate the ambience of an African
village. Nor did it help that Maal was relatively motionless for the
first part of the program.</TE>
<TE>   In his Hollywood Bowl appearance last summer (which is undoubtedly
what attracted many of the Royce attendees) he was a whirlwind of
dance and movement, his leaps and twirls accompanied by a large,
rhythmically dynamic ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the magic of his remarkable voice, moving ecstatically
through the repetitions of traditional-style story songs, the
performance was running in low gear. Perhaps recognizing this, Maal
became more active, adding dance steps and generating more
physicality in the presentation. He was joined by Mansour Seck, who,
despite his blindness, was almost as active as Maal, urging the
audience to applaud, dancing in place and singing harmony and lead
lines.</TE>
<TE>   The result was an immediate upswing in creative energy, producing
more vibrant interaction among the musicians and the establishment of
an interaction with the crowd. It wasn't the laid-back intimacy Maal
described at the start of the performance, but--even given the fact
that few in the hall could understand the Fulani language of the
songs--it finally became the communal experience he was seeking.</TE>
<TE>   Halfway through the performance, composer Hans Zimmer and a few
other players joined the ensemble to re-create some of the Maal music
from "Black Hawk Down." Presumably useful as a promotional tool for
the film, it was an unnecessary distraction from the Maal
program--somewhat like sitting in a movie theater and being forced to
watch commercials until the picture begins.</TE>

<HD>Where the Big Breaks Are Born</HD>
<DH>The country music isn't always good at the Bluebird, but
sometimes all the pieces fit. Just ask Garth Brooks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First in an occasional series about venues where aspiring artists go
to be discovered.</LD>
<LD>   NASHVILLE--A steady rain on a chilly night might hurt the turnout
at some music clubs, but Bluebird Cafe regulars are true believers,
and they flock to the room like parishioners to a church. Some of the
seats in the back of the intimate room are even old pews.</LD>
<LD>   Like the row of stools at the bar and the chairs at nearly two
dozen tables, the pews fill up quickly once the doors open for the
6:30 p.m. show, and the room is hushed as four songwriters sit in
chairs facing one another in the center of the room.</LD>
<TE>   Over the next two hours, the writers take turns singing their
tunes, united in the faith that their music is special and that
someone, on this night or another one, will recognize that fact and
get it recorded.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the most respected record company executives in this
country music capital are big fans of the Bluebird. Tony Brown,
co-founder of the new Universal South label, calls it a "local
treasure that contributes to the creative spirit and health" of the
music community here.</TE>
<TE>   I've stopped by the Bluebird, located in a converted video game
arcade in a mini-mall on the outskirts of town, half a dozen times
over the years without ever hearing a memorable song. Some are
frustratingly close but lack one or more essential elements. You'd be
surprised how many times in a bad song you can guess the rhyme.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there's something about the place that keeps pulling you
back, and here I am again, looking for the chance, however remote, to
sit in on a moment of discovery like the night in 1987 when a young
man from Stillwater, Okla., got on stage during the "open mike" night
and won a standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   It was Garth Brooks, and Bluebird owner Amy Kurland remembers the
reaction vividly. "Garth was not someone who was invented by the
marketing machine at Capitol Records," she says, watching the rain
against the window. "He looked like just another kid with a striped
shirt and a hat, but he was fabulous, and the crowd went wild."</TE>
<TE>   It was also at the club that Brooks found "The Dance," an
inspiring song about pursuing your dreams that became his signature
hit. It was written by Tony Arata, who came to Nashville from
Savannah, Ga. and was working at UPS while trying to peddle his
tunes.</TE>
<TE>   Kurland, whose father, Sheldon, is a Juilliard-trained violinist
who played on such '70s and '80s country hits as George Jones' "He
Stopped Loving Her Today," has operated the Bluebird for almost 20
years.</TE>
<TE>   During that time, she has seen thousands of songwriters come and
go and, in the cases of the persistent ones, come again. The faces of
the successful ones are saluted in the 8-by-10 glossy photos on the
walls. The faces of the others are recalled only in Kurland's memory,
if at all.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of them were terrible ... just trite, ridiculous stuff,"
says Kurland, 46. "But we encourage all of them because many of them
get better. Some of them get a lot better."</TE>
<TE>   Even before Brooks' breakthrough, the story of the Bluebird had
spread, luring young songwriters from as far as Canada and Europe in
hopes of launching careers. A few have ended up working at the club.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Irwin had peddled his songs around New York City, but there
wasn't much interest in country music up there, so he headed to
Nashville in 1986 with a $1,200 nest egg and some dreams. He worked
as a bartender at the Bluebird for nearly two years before he and
Alan Jackson co-wrote "Here in the Real World." Jackson's 1990
recording of the heartache ballad was one of the biggest country hits
in years.</TE>
<TE>   Irwin's name is now in the honor roll on the Bluebird's Web site,
along with the more established writers who played the club--from
Vince Gill and Steve Earle to Lucinda Williams and Trisha Yearwood.
Most of the big names appear at the late show, simply enjoying the
opportunity to play in a warm, supportive atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   The writers on the early shows are mostly unknown, and the
audience consists largely of family and friends.</TE>
<TE>   For such a major recording center, Nashville has a relatively
small club scene. There are other rooms that have played key roles in
the development of talent, including the Nashville Palace, where
Randy Travis worked as a catfish cook and dishwasher between sets in
the '80s. Tour groups frequently stop by the Palace for that reason.
There's also the Exit/In, which was Willie Nelson's and Waylon
Jennings' stamping ground before the mega-stardom of the "Outlaw"
days in the '70s. It now offers a variety of pop, rock and country
acts, most of whom have record contracts.</TE>
<TE>   None, however, approaches the Bluebird as a consistent showcase
for aspiring writers. Kurland, who had worked at various jobs in the
restaurant industry, didn't plan on focusing on songwriters when she
rented the room in 1982 and spent her $30,000 savings to remodel it.</TE>
<TE>   She tried jazz nights, rock nights and Christian music nights for
the first few months, then adopted the acoustic songwriter emphasis
after hosting several writers at a benefit and noticing how well the
music was suited to the room.</TE>
<TE>   Neither rowdy nor funky in the honky-tonk tradition, the intimate
105-seat Bluebird, which Kurland has since bought, has the polite
feel of a modest mom-and-pop restaurant, and the waitresses have
mastered the art of moving through the room--carrying everything from
margaritas to prime-rib sandwiches and chicken fingers--without
distracting you from the music. The room's success has led to a
regional cable TV show and a record label, showcasing some of the
artists who have performed there. A book, containing reminisces by
artists, is in the works, Kurland says.</TE>
<TE>   In this night's early show, most of the songs would warrant some
consideration by a talent scout. The melodies are frequently strong
and the wordplay can be clever. But as usual, there is invariably
something missing.</TE>
<TE>   After 90 minutes, I'm ready to slip out the door when Barbara
Cloyd, who hosts the club's Monday night "open mike" shows, sings a
song that locks in--fast and hard.</TE>
<TE>   The bittersweet lyrics are about a woman whose marriage has lost
its spark. She tells her husband about seeing a couple in a cafe and
marveling at how much in love they looked. It reminded her of the
time when their own love was strong. The twist, of course, is that
the man at lunch was actually her husband.</TE>
<TE>   The song, "I Guess You Had to Be There," has the kind of soaring
melody that often accompanies heartbreak tunes, and Cloyd sang it
with a marvelous sensitivity.</TE>
<TE>   It was precisely the type of discovery that keeps pulling you back
to the Bluebird. I was so enthused I even found myself telling the
stranger next to me at the bar, "Great song."</TE>
<TE>   That's when I learned that it was a country hit 11 years ago for
Lorrie Morgan.</TE>
<TE>   Cloyd, who moved here from St. Louis in the '80s to pursue
songwriting, later told me she has played "I Guess You Had to Be
There" (co-written with Jon Robbin) several times at the Bluebird and
it always got good response.</TE>
<TE>   Because she wrote one song that good, it's easy to assume she's
written a few more. But Cloyd has had only two other songs recorded,
and neither was a hit.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a hard, grueling, frustrating business," she said. "Even
really good writers don't hit a home run every time, but you're
always hoping for one every time you write a song or hear someone
else start one. That's what keeps us coming back to the Bluebird.
It's like a family here. We've all gone through similar experiences
and we support each other."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the early show, you see that support. There is a lot
of handshaking and congratulating among the songwriters and the
friends who have come to encourage them.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, it's still raining, but another long line has formed for
the late show, when the anticipation will again build every time a
writer introduces another song.</TE>

<HD>Mass in B Minor Leaves Patrons Puzzled</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As a longtime subscriber to the Los Angeles Opera and a retiree
living on a fixed income, I must take issue with Mark Swed in his
review of the L.A. Opera's latest presentation, Bach's Mass in B
minor ("Radical Ritual," Feb. 4). From where we sat in the loge, a
number of people walked out, there were many boos but no bravos, and
we very much regretted the $172 we paid for the seats.</LD>
<LD>   The orchestra and chorus were very good, albeit rather faint in
the loge, and the soloists reasonable, but the travesty that took
place on the stage was abysmal. It lacked any relevance to the sacred
liturgy of the Mass. At best it was profane, but really verged on the
blasphemous, and was extremely distracting and ridiculous.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I was present at the opening of the Mass in B minor and was also
mesmerized, like Mark Swed, by the visual performance of the ensemble
on stage. It was interesting, new and captivating--but also
distracting. My husband closed his eyes to concentrate on the music.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, my verdict was that it was a success, but on thinking
more about it, now, four days later, my main memory is of the stage,
the cube, the lighting and the dancers--not the music. For me, this
is not what Bach is about.</TE>
<TE>   ALISON DAVIS</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Like Mark Swed, I also saw the Mass in B "Mimer" last Saturday
afternoon. Unlike Swed, I sat further up in the house and thought the
voices clear and the music wonderful. But what the heck was that on
the stage? What a great idea and wasted opportunity! The mimes were
slow, repetitious, distracting and ultimately boring.</TE>
<TE>   Swed's adulation of this rubbish doesn't surprise me at all. In
fact, as I walked out, my lament was that the critics would love it
and no one would give me a clear take on Emperor Achim Freyer's new
clothes.</TE>
<TE>   ROGER WALTON</TE>
<TE>   North Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bach's Mass in B Minor can stand on its own. It is supposed to
bring us closer to God and the mystery of man's redemption through
the incarnation, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. If somebody
is going to stage this Mass, the staging should inspire the audience
to experience this mystery. Instead, I spent two hours pondering
these two deep philosophical questions:</TE>
<TE>   1. What the heck are those people on stage doing?</TE>
<TE>   2. Why are they doing it?</TE>

<LD>Thank you for Howard Rosenberg's insightful column on the demise of
CNN ("Big Names, Little News--This Is CNN?," Feb. 1).</LD>
<LD>   I am a native of South Carolina, and when Ted Turner's vision
began to take shape in the late '70s, we Southern rednecks began to
revel that CNN was going to rise from the caldron of shallow,
mediocre American journalism like Atlanta rose from the ashes of
Sherman's march.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, CNN's techno-journalism style which emerged during
their coverage of the Gulf War and later their sell-out to AOL has
put them in the Bush league (er ... bush league), along with ABC,
NBC, CBS, Fox and the National Enquirer. The last stalwart of
journalistic ethics left CNN when Bernard Shaw departed several
months ago. I dare say he saw it coming and wanted no part.</LD>

<LD>Calendar reports that exclusive footage from Sept. 11 will be
broadcast by CBS on March 10 ("CBS Buys Rights to Unseen Sept. 11
Video," by Elizabeth Jensen, Feb. 6).</LD>
<LD>   March 10 is believed by many to be Osama bin Laden's date of
birth. I fear that Bin Laden and his followers might view this
broadcast as a gift that exalts their attack on the U.S. I would
suggest that CBS schedule another time slot.</LD>
<LD>   JEAN OVRUM</LD>
<TE>   Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The article about CBS' purchase of the video reports that "CBS
officials were also pitched a comedy series with a Sept. 11 plot line
(a couple united after their spouses died in the attacks), but that
project has since fizzled." Clearly this suggests that CBS executives
seriously considered--at least for a time--bringing this "comedy" to
the small screen.</TE>
<TE>   After reading this, I'm more confused than ever regarding those
who lead the entertainment industry. Keeping in mind that, even
today, they're still pulling bloodied bits of bodies out of the World
Trade Center site, I'm wondering if entertainment executives are born
without souls or if they're simply required to sell them to the Devil
to achieve such lofty positions in their industry--a price of
admission, of sorts.</TE>

<LD>Congrats to the self-selected KPFK Local Advisory Board for its
successful campaign to win back control of the station ("Pacifica
Network Knows No Peace," by Steve Carney, Feb. 1). Now they can
return it to the flight path toward irrelevance and insolvency it was
on prior to Mark Schubb's appointment as general manager.</LD>
<LD>   In just a few years, Schubb managed to double contributions and
triple listenership at the station without accepting a dime of
corporate money or altering its basic progressive political stance.
He simply allowed a wider range of debate and reflection than his
ideologically pure critics could abide.</LD>

<TE>   That changes were/are needed to Pacifica Foundation's National
Board and its governing structure is not disputed, but it really
needs to be done after a governing national board has been elected by
all of Pacifica's subscriber base, not by a small set of people who
represent themselves as the spokespeople for the subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   M.G. PEARCY</TE>
<TE>   West Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I found most of the article to contain a recognizable relationship
to the happenings in the attempted corporate raid of Pacifica radio
stations by the board of directors that has been removed by order of
the court. However, the characterization of the legal battle as a
"family brawl" is totally misleading.</TE>
<TE>   The majority members of the removed board was constitutionally
opposed to Pacifica's progressive, populist mission and charter. The
ruling majority of that board was a distinctly anti-union, right-wing
corporate group with an agenda to silence the only progressive and
truly publicly sponsored radio stations in the country and convert
their assets into mainstream, revenue-driven, commercial programming.
There is no "family" relationship between such diametrically opposed
forces.</TE>

<TE>   Juan Gonzalez, pacifica campaign.org, Amy Goodman,
democracynow.org and countless, selfless others who are modern-day
Edward R. Murrows who value journalistic honesty over salary will be
historic figures. If it wasn't for their incredible efforts, this
$200-million-plus network would simply have become one more "asset"
for some investors and internal charlatans. Its preservation is no
"jihad"; it's democracy.</TE>

<LD>Regarding Patrick Goldstein's article on the Oscar campaign ("An
Oscar Mantra: Press to Excess," Feb. 5): I realize the list at the
end was a spoof, but the comments about Russell Crowe were mean,
spiteful and dishonest.</LD>
<LD>   When did Crowe ever belch during an acceptance speech? His award
acceptance speeches have been articulate, intelligent and charming.
Perhaps Goldstein is a bit jealous that Crowe has an ability to
effortlessly find the right words on the spur of the moment in front
of thousands of people, while he slaves over his articles and columns
trying to be witty.</LD>

<TE>   I enjoyed Patrick Goldstein's piece about the Oscars and talking
points for "In the Bedroom." Having seen the movie several months
ago, I was stunned to see the hype-ads on TV telling me I had seen a
story of "redemption." Before any ad campaign had corrected my
thinking, I came away thinking I'd seen a movie about two murders. My
thoughts (before being adjusted by the proper ad campaigns) were to
wonder how those people would get through the rest of their lives
with the weight of murder on their shoulders.</TE>

<LD>Congratulations to Ira Yellin, Bernard Zimmerman and their
compatriots for the completion of the new Museum of Architecture and
Design in downtown Los Angeles ("From the Ground Up," by Hugh Hart,
Jan. 28).</LD>
<LD>   It is appropriate on many levels for this welcome addition to be
located in the 109-year old Bradbury Building. For many years the
Bradbury was the home of the Southern California Chapter (later the
Los Angeles Chapter) of the American Institute of Architects. The
chapter's commitment to the support of historic structures and the
revitalization of downtown was undermined somewhat when the office
was moved west to the Pacific Design Center. Now, the Bradbury is
once again a focal point for our city's new and historic structures.</LD>

<LD>Thank you for your encouragement for the would-be art patron ("A
Passion for Art," by Hillary Johnson, Jan. 31). There are a few more
welcoming places which were not mentioned that might be of interest,
namely the rental galleries at the Armand Hammer and Los Angeles
County Museums, and the Musemembership at LACMA.</LD>
<LD>   The rental galleries offer a wide range of work at reasonable fees
which may be applied toward purchase.</LD>
<LD>   The Muse membership is designed for youngish art patrons, who, for
a small additional cost over the regular membership, can participate
in additional educational/social activities that will enhance their
appreciation of and comfort with art. In the words of A. Miripolsky:
"Fear no art."</LD>

conservators who treat each work with loving hands, fellow collectors
who provide advice and are not afraid to share information and
framers who coddled me through difficult decisions.</TE>

<LD>   Bloomberg Takes a Stand on Censorship</LD>
<LD>   New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has put the kibosh on a
controversial Decency Commission that his predecessor, Rudolph V.
Giuliani, set up to police art exhibited by museums funded by the
city.</LD>
<TE>   "I am opposed to censorship of any kind," said Bloomberg, who sits
on the boards of a number of museums, including the Metropolitan
Museum of Art. "I don't think government should be in the business of
telling museums what is art or what they should exhibit."</TE>
<TE>   The best rule to follow in dealing with an exhibit one considers
sacrilegious or pornographic, he added, is to stay home.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't like a museum exhibit, don't go see it," he said.
"And that's going to be my strategy."</TE>

<TE>   R&amp;B Singer Fends Off Sexual Allegations</TE>
<TE>   R. Kelly, the R&amp;B superstar known best for the soaring anthem "I
Believe I Can Fly," is again dealing with allegations of engaging in
sex with minors.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago Sun-Times reported Friday that it had anonymously
received an explicit 26-minute videotape that purportedly shows the
singer in intimate contact with an underage girl. The story appeared
the same day the Grammy-winning, Chicago-born singer was scheduled to
perform at the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake
City.</TE>
<TE>   In the story, an attorney for Kelly dismisses the tape as a
suspiciously timed fake. But the newspaper also quotes a videography
expert who reviewed the footage and said the chances are "slim to
none" that the images were doctored. According to the paper, local
police launched an investigation three years ago into an alleged
relationship between Kelly and the girl apparently depicted in the
footage.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly has also been sued by two other young Chicago women who
claimed that, while they were minors, they had ongoing relationships
with the singer that led to personal injuries and emotional harm. The
suits describe an alleged pattern in which Kelly, now 35, used wealth
and influence to meet teenage girls and have sex with them.</TE>
<TE>   Court documents also show that the singer secretly married the
late R&amp;B singer Aaliyah, then 15, in 1995--a year after he produced
her first album, "Age Ain't Nothing but a Number."</TE>
<TE>   Keys Tops Soul Train Award Nominations</TE>
<TE>   Alicia Keys had a leading four nominations for the 16th annual
Soul Train Music Awards, while fellow soul songstresses India .Arie
and Aaliyah had three each.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran R&amp;B singers the Isley Brothers, making a comeback more
than 42 years after their first hit single, "Shout," also gathered
three nominations Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Jaheim, Musiq Soulchild, Usher and Michael Jackson will be
competing in the category of male R&amp;B/soul album.</TE>
<TE>   Winners of the Soul Train awards, honoring rhythm &amp; blues, soul,
hip-hop, rap and gospel performances, will be announced March 20 at
the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, and taped for syndicated
television broadcast.</TE>

<TE>   A revival of "Gypsy" is headed for Broadway--instead of London, as
had been expected. The New York Times reports that the musical, based
on the life of stripper Gypsy Rose Lee and her mother, Rose, will be
directed by Sam Mendes (Broadway's "Cabaret") and is due to arrive
next year.</TE>
<TE>   And who will play the brassy, belting Mama Rose, immortalized by
Ethel Merman? None other than Bernadette Peters, who, Mendes says,
was cast in the role because she's closer to Rose as she really
existed.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a tiny woman," Mendes told the New York Times. "And she
was a charmer. And so is Bernadette. I think the tradition of
battle-axes in that role has been explored."</TE>

<TE>   Cosby Cancels in Face of Cincinnati Boycott</TE>
<TE>   Bill Cosby has canceled a performance in Cincinnati next month,
honoring a boycott called by black groups unhappy with the city's
response to last year's riots.</TE>
<TE>   "I still stand by the fact that I feel very uncomfortable playing
the concerts at this time in this climate," said the 64-year-old
comedian, who was scheduled to perform twice at the Aronoff Center.
More than 3,000 tickets had been sold. The money will be refunded.</TE>
<TE>   The Coalition for a Just Cincinnati--one of 14 groups that have
called for economic sanctions--mailed letters to Cosby and other
performers booked to appear in the city. The coalition asked them to
boycott Cincinnati until city leaders pay more attention to police,
racial and economic issues.</TE>
<TE>   The push for a boycott came after three days of rioting over the
fatal shooting of an unarmed black man by a white police officer last
April. The officer was acquitted of charges of negligent homicide and
obstruction of official business.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the Cincinnati Arts Assn., a nonprofit group that
manages the center, met with coalition members last month and also
talked with Cosby. Steve Loftin, the association's president and
executive director, said he was "deeply disappointed" by the
cancellation.</TE>

<TE>   'Felicity' Canceled by the WB, Salvaged by WE</TE>
<TE>   "Felicity," one of the shows that put the WB on the map, will end
its four-year run in the spring, Variety reports. The college drama
series, in which Keri Russell stars, has been averaging 3.3 million
viewers--down about 15% from last season.</TE>
<TE>   The show is off the air now but will return on March 20, with a
two-hour finale May 22.</TE>
<TE>   "Glory Days," the freshman drama that the network had been trying
out in "Felicity's" Wednesday time slot, will move to Mondays at 9
p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Die-hard "Felicity" fans can take comfort in the fact that the
show will have an afterlife. Cable's WE: Women's Entertainment--an
offshoot of American Movie Classics--plans to air all 84 episodes on
a daily basis, starting in September.</TE>

<HD>The Art of Disorientation</HD>
<DH>L.A. artist Yunhee Min's powerful and towering 'Events in
Dense Fog' exhibit at Luckman Gallery promotes physical awareness,
dissonant color.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEAH OLLMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fog, as amorphous as it is, exerts tremendous power. In diffusing
borders, it sharpens our attention. It heightens our consciousness
and compels us to keep alert. In heavy fog, we may need to navigate
by feel, by body awareness more than by eye.</LD>
<LD>   That state of amplified physical awareness is alluded to--and
moderately well achieved--in Yunhee Min's installation in the Luckman
Gallery at Cal State L.A. The air inside the gallery is as clear as
air in L.A. gets, and the contours of Min's two gargantuan paintings
are visibly crisp, yet "Events in Dense Fog" generates exactly that,
a sense of occurrence under compromised conditions.</LD>
<LD>   Min, a young L.A. artist who's shown extensively since the
mid-'90s, makes gallery-scaled canvases and architecturally-sited
installations. Both hinge on deviation, tension born of irregularity.
Her paintings, no matter the scale, consist of vertical bands of
color whose edges veer off from right angles, yielding quirky
quadrilaterals.</LD>
<TE>   Her "in-between" colors, individually rich in character and lined
up in an orderly manner, refuse to harmonize, and instead bristle
against their neighbors like members of one big dysfunctional family.
Even when staged on a smaller, more domestic scale, these dissonances
make for intriguing disorientation. On the massive scale of the
installation at the Luckman, the stakes are even higher, but the
degree of destabilization remains subtle.</TE>
<TE>   Min's two paintings face off from opposite corners of the large
rectangular room. Each spans from floor to ceiling, but angles out
from the wall, as if propped or wedged into its corner. One,
measuring roughly 15 feet by 32 feet, is nestled into a setback at
the far end of the gallery, a niche with a slightly lowered ceiling.
The other, at nearly 19 feet by 31 feet, leans more steeply against
the wall near the gallery's entrance, so that one of its edges and
the wedge of darkness between it and the wall are exposed.</TE>
<TE>   Painted in matte house paint on drywall, the paintings double as
walls and discrete objects. One bears wide stripes the color of dried
blood, damp earth, emerald and acid yellow-green; the other a less
severe array of steely blue, crimson, khaki and mauve.</TE>
<TE>   Parallel to the paintings, a white wall constructed to bisect the
gallery space, makes it difficult, but not impossible, to experience
both paintings at once. The gracelessness of the wall itself, with
its exposed metal supports, makes it more an encumbrance than a
catalyst, however.</TE>
<TE>   Without it, one would navigate the gallery's vast central space
using only bare, perimeter walls and the off-kilter paintings to get
one's bearings. The slight pressure exerted on that interior space by
the paintings, angling inward and creating a charged diagonal axis to
the room, would be more palpable without the wall, more destabilizing
and more acutely felt. As it is, the forward slope of the paintings
does generate a quiver of tension, a friendlier, far more benign
version of the intimidation wielded by Richard Serra's stark, tilted
walls. Min has calculated the angles and dimensions here to tease and
gently confound, but not to threaten.</TE>
<TE>   As you move about the space, the angles seem to shift, and what
reads as parallel from one position now appears torqued. The
relationship between wall and painting oscillates so that even these
massive panels become ambiguous. Moving around and between these sly
hybrids of hard-edged painting and sculpture-in-the-round, our
perceptions waver. The event that Min has staged is our own encounter
with immersive color and physical uncertainty, with Minimalism's dour
verities turned inside out.</TE>

<HD>Ripples of Change in ABT's 'Swan Lake'</HD>
<DH>Make-overs include more dancing for the sorcerer Rothbart
in the version planned for Costa Mesa.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a new introduction and new choreography for Acts 1 and 4,
audiences will be seeing a very different "Swan Lake" on Tuesday when
American Ballet Theatre dances at the Orange County Performing Arts
Center in Costa Mesa.</LD>
<LD>   Artistic director Kevin McKenzie says the biggest make-over will
be given to the role of the evil sorcerer Rothbart. A largely
non-dancing part in other productions, the character will actually
have solos. During the overture he'll be seen seducing Odette and
turning her into a swan and he will be a dominant force in the
ballroom scene. The part will be double-cast with one performer as an
acting Rothbart and another as a dancing Rothbart.</LD>
<LD>   "He's a huge controlling force in the story," McKenzie said
recently from company studios in New York. "I wanted to establish
right off, yes, he was the bad guy, but also he was a supernatural
being. He had control over mere mortals.</LD>
<TE>   "To establish those powers at the very beginning, he is
transformed in front of the audience from a beast to a very handsome
man and back again. They see the monster, then the handsome guy
they're going to see in the third act, and back again."</TE>
<TE>   In the expanded role, McKenzie chose three dancers for their
ability to combine passion and lyricism. "What all three have in
common is a fire, but it's under a cloak of elegance, and that's
exactly what I'm looking for in this particular role," said McKenzie.</TE>
<TE>   All three dancers are Latino, all three had similar challenges to
face as men in dance, and all three are thoroughly enjoying the role
which McKenzie created with Marcelo Gomes, who performed at the
premiere in Washington, D.C., in March 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Rothbart is a fun role," said Gomes. "You get to show off your
technical side as well as your artistic expression, which I love to
do. When we were first creating it, I couldn't wait for the next
step. But it's hard. In the beginning, you're dealing with all the
princesses and there's a lot of partnering. Then halfway through the
variation, it's not about partnering anymore. It's about you dancing.
That's want makes it exciting. He manipulates everybody in the
palace. Seduces almost everyone."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a beautiful role," said Ricardo Torres. "You are evil. But
you're a prince. You have to be a prince to convince [Odette] to hang
out with you in the first part. He totally hypnotizes her and turns
her into a swan. Then he seduces her."</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Molina finds the role of Rothbart especially virtuosic. "We
have a variation that requires a lot of technique and you need a lot
of stamina for it. You have to stay in character while you're doing
all this. That's what makes it difficult."</TE>
<TE>   The three dancers have more in common than the role. Like most
young males interested in ballet, they had to overcome prejudice and
hostility to pursue their art.</TE>
<TE>   Gomes, who was born in Brazil, was told to get professional
psychological help.</TE>
<TE>   "Any other kind of dance--samba, pagode, forro--social dances, a
man can do that," Gomes, 22, said in a separate interview from New
York. "Why does ballet have to be different? But it was different.
When I wanted to get time off from gym class to go study dance, my
parents got called in to the school to talk to the director. He said
there was something wrong with me. I did not want to do soccer. He
told my parents to seek a doctor. They thought that was ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   Some of his friends were supportive but others were not. "It was
hard, but only when I was not in the studio. When I was in the
studio, most of the time, I forgot about that stuff. I knew I wanted
to be a professional dancer. If I had to hang onto those problems, I
wouldn't have made it so far so quickly."</TE>
<TE>   He left Brazil when he was 13 to study for three years at the
Harid Conservatory in Boca Raton, Fla. After three years there, he
won the Hope Prize in 1996 at the international competition in
Lausanne, then went to study at the Paris Opera Ballet for a year. He
joined ABT in 1997 as a member of the corps and was promoted to
soloist in August 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Torres, 21, was born in Puerto Rico. He began dancing "because I
couldn't get into any sports," he said from New York. "I wasn't good
at them." His mother enrolled him in a local school that taught
theater and creative movement, including ballet.</TE>
<TE>   "They started putting on shows on Saturdays. I really liked it.
But it was awful for me. In school, they would make fun of me. There
were so few boys, I got into the [Ballet Concierto de Puerto Rico]
when I was 13. We had to go on tour, so everybody knew I was dancing.
I was really lonely, but my mom and I were close. All through high
school, I needed friends. But I liked [ballet] so much, it was worth
it. I learned to block [the loneliness]. I filled my time with other
stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Torres went to San Francisco Ballet School for a year on
scholarship, then returned to Puerto Rico for a year. He joined ABT's
Studio Company in 1999 and the main company a year later, as a
soloist. He won a 2001 Princess Grace Dance Fellowship and also the
Chris Hellman Dance Award, given at the competition to only one
dancer each year.</TE>
<TE>   Molina, 27, was born in Cali, Colombia, and discovered dance, he
said, "by accident."</TE>
<TE>   "I was in a regular school when I was little, but I liked to run
around and play, so they suspended me for one year," Molina said from
New York. "I was 9. I didn't know what to do. My mother knew about
this ballet school, a special school to form dancers. I went to it. I
liked it and decided to keep going."</TE>
<TE>   He quickly faced the prejudice that "ballet is only for girls."
"But since I spent most of my time at the school--it was a program of
eight years and had academics and artistic programs all
together--people didn't have much opportunity to make fun of it."</TE>
<TE>   Molina moved to the U.S. when he was 18 to start a summer program
on scholarship at the Houston Ballet. That led to another scholarship
for a year's study at the company. He went on to join the Hartford
Ballet, where he stayed for four years before joining ABT as a corps
member in 1998. He was promoted to soloist in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The combined talents of Molina, Torres and Gomes will bring more
attention to the role, McKenzie said. But he also added that the
reinvention of one character shouldn't mislead anyone.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very traditional 'Swan Lake,' for all the changes that
I've made," he said. "At first I thought, 'I'm being so radical
here.' No, I wasn't. The ending is very Shakespearean. Pretty much
everyone is dead by the time it ends."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   American Ballet Theatre will dance Kevin McKenzie's staging of
"Swan Lake" on Tuesday through Saturday at 8 p.m. and Saturday and
Sunday at 2 p.m. at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600
Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. $20 to $75. (714) 556-2787.</TE>

<HD>Contender? More Like a Champion</HD>
<DH>After 50 years on screen, Marlon Brando still has the power
to intrigue, move and perplex us like no other American actor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SRAGOW</AU>
<BD>BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beyond anything else, Marlon Brando is the towering original who came
out of the Midwest 58 years ago and electrified Broadway and then
Hollywood with the visceral excitement and veracity of his acting. He
exploded propriety and expressed intimate yearnings with
unprecedented nakedness and power, only to have studio executives try
to cut him down to conventional stardom.</LD>
<LD>   Even now, he seesaws between living legend and butt of late-night
jokes. Whenever another maverick is profiled or interviewed, Brando
is apt to be invoked as a model or a friend. But Brando is just as
sure to be parodied by comedians who mock the way he once fed Larry
King a health-food cookie and kissed him on the lips.</LD>
<LD>   Brando's ability to embarrass as well as to inspire is part of
what I admire about him. When he turns interview sessions with King
or Connie Chung into showcases for his own eccentricities, he's being
true to his roots. He was at the hub of that generation of artists
who viewed the celebrity-fueled media not as allies in the American
Success Game but as distorters of their work and invaders of their
lives.</LD>
<TE>   Again and again in books on Brando, biographers seize on the
real-life scene of Brando testifying in tears on behalf of his son
Christian, who shot and killed his half-sister's lover. They use the
broken-lion image as counterpoint to Brando's masculine potency in
movies of the '50s. It's as if they think Brando had embodied some
stoic man's man code that made it unseemly for him to break even
under such tragic circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   So I was almost dizzy with delight when I reread this proclamation
by the late film critic Pauline Kael: As "the major protagonist of
contemporary American themes in the fifties," she wrote, Brando "had
no code, only his instincts. He was a development from the gangster
leader and the outlaw. He was antisocial because he knew society was
crap; he was a hero to youth because he was strong enough not to take
the crap."</TE>
<TE>   In the course of devouring the recent flood of DVDs that
immortalize Brando's movie roles in pristine digital, I kept looking
for coherence in the arc of his career.</TE>
<TE>   For help, I pored through all the available biographies and found
occasional insights wrapped up in confusion or abashment or
wool-gathering. But the repeated quoting of Kael in several books
sent me back to her 1966 essay, "Marlon Brando: An American Hero." It
was a revelation.</TE>
<TE>   Kael's essay does more to summarize Brando's blistering appeal and
the perilous nature of his acting life than anything written before
or since.</TE>
<TE>   In a passage that goes beyond conventional criticism to a personal
declaration of values and philosophy, Kael writes: "He was our angry
young man--the delinquent, the tough, the rebel--who stood at the
center of our common experience. When, as Terry Malloy in 'On the
Waterfront,' he said to his brother, 'Oh Charlie, oh Charlie you
don't understand. I could have had class. I could have been a
contender. I could have been somebody, instead of a bum--which is
what I am,' he spoke for all our failed hopes. It was the great
American lament, of Broadway, of Hollywood, as well as of the docks."</TE>
<TE>   Still, her realization that Brando represented the first male
American protagonist who didn't have a code, who found new audacity
and power from his very lack of mooring, accounts for Brando's
continued power to intrigue us. He moves us like no other actor when
his intuition and intelligence connect with our own contradictory
feelings.</TE>
<TE>   Brando had a rare potency in movies right from the start--that's
what makes him so ferociously affecting as a World War II paraplegic
who doubts his ability to please his wife in Fred Zinnemann's "The
Men" (1950). In Elia Kazan's film version of his stage triumph,
Tennessee Williams' "A Streetcar Named Desire" (1951), Brando as
Stanley Kowalski brought off a lowdown burlesque poetry, spitting out
unintentionally hilarious non sequiturs while parading around in his
tight T-shirt and jeans. What's more, he made it mesh with the
heartbreakingly delicate lyricism of Vivien Leigh's Blanche DuBois.</TE>
<TE>   Brando burned with revolutionary fire in Kazan's visually exciting
"Viva Zapata" (1952)--it's his most uncomplicatedly stirring, and
macho, performance--and he showed his range with his Mark Antony in
Joseph L. Mankiewicz's production of Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar"
(1953).</TE>
<TE>   It was Brando's next two films, "The Wild One" (1953) and "On the
Waterfront" (1954), that made him a movie idol. Aside from Brando's
performance, "The Wild One" hasn't aged well. Although its leather
and chrome iconography and Brando's hipsterism inspired biker and
rebel cults for decades to come, it fits all too snugly into the
musty category of "cautionary tale." Its story ultimately reduces
Brando's biker to the quintessential crazy mixed-up kid.</TE>
<TE>   "On the Waterfront," also with Kazan, holds up as one of the best
examples of the creative synergy of gifted star and landmark role.
For all its muckraking, the drama is based on the growth of a single
character, and it makes his transformation as galvanizing as that of
Henry V.</TE>
<TE>   The fulcrum of "On the Waterfront" is Terry's relationship with
his brother, Charlie the Gent. It's a variation on the Cain and Abel
theme, with the brainy brother being more destructive than the brawny
one. Rod Steiger is brilliant as Charlie, embodying a glib maturity
that even Terry sees through at the end. But Brando is the one who
makes us see and hear what we never have before. He mixes an odd
languor with physical menace, shadowy gestures with sudden decisive
actions, and an unconventional stop-and-go phrasing that makes each
line his own. He expresses the inexpressible and gets at the core of
Terry's angst--his throttled howl against a world that would label
and box him without the love with which he pigeonholes his pigeons.</TE>
<TE>   Post-'Waterfront' Not an Unblemished Record</TE>
<TE>   For the dozen years after "On the Waterfront," Brando ping-ponged
between wildly various projects, sometimes testing himself and
sometimes merely toying with expectations. The roster of these films
will defeat the efforts of most Brando-philes to strike through to
instances of undiminished brilliance. "Desiree" (1954), "Guys and
Dolls" (1955), "The Teahouse of the August Moon" (1956), "Sayonara"
(1957)--all are white elephants in widescreen and color.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to play a decent man who became a Nazi officer in the
fitfully compelling "The Young Lions" (1958), he tackles ethical
conundrums but skews the meaning of the material. "Mutiny on the
Bounty" (1962) is probably the most enjoyable of Brando's mid-career
debacles, though neither the two halves of the story nor the two
halves of his interpretation of mutineer Fletcher Christian--as dandy
and underdog hero--jibe effectively.</TE>
<TE>   And in John Huston's 1967 "Reflections in a Golden Eye," Brando
once again forges a fully rounded performance in a first-rate movie.</TE>
<TE>   After "Reflections in a Golden Eye" bombed, Brando went slumming
again, in his pal Christian Marquand's ragged film version of the
porno classic "Candy" (1968). But as the elusive agent of colonialism
in Gillo Pontecorvo's surging if self-destructive "Burn!" (1970), he
wryly articulated imperial capitalism to the delight of campus
radicals. He exploded with sexual sadism in Michael Winner's nasty
melodrama "The Nightcomers" (1971). And later in 1971 and '72, nearly
two decades after Terry Malloy, Francis Ford Coppola gave him the
opportunity once again to play a Zeitgeist-defining figure--this
time, a massive patriarchal force who ensures both his family's
survival and its moral downfall.</TE>
<TE>   To this day, it's jolting to see Brando as Don Corleone--the
receded hairline, the gray pencil mustache, jowls hanging off a
twisted mouth and a voice cracked from years of command. Brando makes
the character extraordinarily complex largely through his physical
expressiveness. He walks as if his shoulder blades were pinned behind
him. But the sensibility beneath the authority is surprisingly agile:
the Don can suddenly break into mimicry, or turn his daughter in a
waltz with a slight protective bent that catches sentiment in
movement.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to overestimate the influence Brando's uncanny acting
had on this masterpiece. His sway over the rest of the cast vitalizes
the film on every viewing.</TE>
<TE>   Brando had even more influence on his next film, Bernardo
Bertolucci's "Last Tango in Paris." Brando poured all his knowledge
of life and acting into the role of an American expatriate devastated
by his wife's suicide and determined to have a sex-only liaison with
Maria Schneider. And he was working with a director who resolved to
take Brando's and Kazan's improvisatory, psychodramatic techniques to
new peaks in a heightened operatic style.</TE>
<TE>   Brando began to let his burgeoning flab fan out and permit his
bent for goofiness to run amok in the sour satiric western "The
Missouri Breaks" (1975). How remarkable to see a movie in which Jack
Nicholson is the underactor. And Brando's put-on gravitas in
"Superman" (1978) set the pattern for decades of highly paid cameo
appearances.</TE>
<TE>   At least working with Coppola again on "Apocalypse Now" promised a
return to substance. But it came off as a parody of their
collaboration on "The Godfather." Kurtz, the madman who's carved out
his own kingdom in the Cambodian jungle during the Vietnam War, is
seen in half-light and heard in half-whispers. Trying to arrive at a
concept of Kurtz that would fit Brando's newly bloated heroic
presence, Coppola and his star make him Christ and satyr, martyr and
Manson.</TE>
<TE>   If Brando has gone in and out of focus ever since "Apocalypse
Now," it's not entirely his fault. Moviemakers often don't know what
to do with him even after they cast him. Most recently, Frank Oz, the
director of the hollow 2001 heist film "The Score," lamented that he
tried to challenge Brando instead of listening to him--and the result
is listless.</TE>
<TE>   The next time we see Brando, it may be in an instructional acting
video he is producing called "Lying for a Living." Brando has already
taped Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, and Jon Voight improvising with
non-actors for this video.</TE>
<TE>   The intersection of raw reality and superb training reflects
Brando's own expansive aesthetic. He calls what he does lying for a
living. But he's actually turned movie acting into the art of telling
the truth.</TE>

<LD>Last year, Jamie Sale and David Pelletier of Canada won the world
championship in pairs. Today, they begin their bid to win a gold
medal and become the first team from outside Russia or the former
Soviet Union to win the Olympic title in 38 years. Their top
challengers are two-time world champions Elena Berezhnaya and Anton
Sikharulidze of--where else?--Russia. The American teams are Kyoko

<LD>The men's 5,000 meters is the most grueling of the long-track events,
and the king of the rink is likely to be from the Netherlands. The
talent pool is so deep that Gianni Romme, the defending Olympic gold
medalist and world-record holder, failed to qualify for the Dutch
team at the Games. Bob de Jong and Carl Verheijen are now the
favorites in the event. Derek Parra, who grew up in San Bernardino,
is the highest ranking American in the World Cup standings at 15th
place. Parra was supposed to be an alternate in 1998 but was bumped
because of an error on his entry form.</LD>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>American fans won't prove anything by chanting "U-S-A" at hockey
games or showering applause on Michelle Kwan. This country's
patriotic spirit isn't in question. Not these days. The fans can show
that they embrace everything this country stands for by cheering just
as loudly when Bagher Kalhor works his way through the slalom course
or Mostafa Mirhashemi hits the finish line at a cross-country event.</LD>
<LD>   They are the two athletes competing for the Islamic Republic of
Iran at these Olympic Games. They are willing to come to our turf, on
our terms, for these Games. They're giving us a chance. We should do
the same for them.</LD>
<LD>   "[We're] showing the Iranian flag to everybody in all countries,
all nations," Kalhor said through an interpreter in anticipation of
Friday night's opening ceremony. "We are coming for peace and showing
to everybody we are not terrorists, we are not criminal people. We
are looking for peace, friendship together."</LD>
<TE>   They are branded as different, when all they want to do is be like
the rest of the athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Other Olympic participants get to talk about double axels. The
Iranian contingent has to answer questions about an evil axis.</TE>
<TE>   The roles aren't as easily defined as they were 22 years ago, the
last time the Winter Olympics were held in America. There's no Cold
War, no good-vs.-evil delineation. It all changes too quickly. A
couple of months ago, we were bombing Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
regime. Now we're trying to aid that country's fledgling new
government.</TE>
<TE>   Of the three nations President Bush mentioned in his charge of an
"axis of evil," countries supporting terrorism--Iran, Iraq and North
Korea--Iran is the only one participating in these Olympics. That's a
dubious distinction among the 77 nations represented in Salt Lake.</TE>
<TE>   "We are coming only for friendship," said Farshid Alizadeh, vice
president of the Iranian Ski Federation. "We are not coming for
politic. The politics is different story."</TE>
<TE>   Religion has been an unavoidable subplot of these Olympics set in
the heartland of the Mormon church. But Iran is the only country with
Islam as a part of its official name.</TE>
<TE>   The misguided among us wanted to blame Islam for the attacks of
Sept. 11, as if all Muslims shared blame. These athletes aren't here
to say which belief is right.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is allowed his own religion," Mirhashemi, the
cross-country skier, said through an interpreter. "We are not coming
for teaching everybody Islam."</TE>
<TE>   So let's just treat this like a first date, where talk about
religion and politics is off limits.</TE>
<TE>   Don't hold lingering grudges from the Iranian hostage crisis
against these athletes. Mirhashemi was only 5 years old and
Afsharzadeh was only a few months old when Iranian students took over
the American embassy in Tehran on Nov. 4, 1979.</TE>
<TE>   So far, these Iranians have been well received, from the moment
their international flight arrived in Chicago. They were not
fingerprinted, which is a normal Justice Department requirement for
visiting foreigners, but a practice the Iranians find highly
offensive.</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks for the minister of justice and the minister of
administration," Alizadeh said. "Very good reception to us. Thanks
very much. Before we are coming here, we were thinking when we were
arriving [there would be] so many difficulty. But, really, thanks for
everybody."</TE>
<TE>   The good vibes continued with them to Salt Lake City. Kalhor, the
Alpine skier, even complimented the smooth landing. They had a
reception with Iranian-Americans on Thursday night, then attended
their official welcome to the Olympic village on Friday morning. A
couple of dozen Olympic staffers applauded as the Iranian team was
presented with gifts--a quilt and peace pipe. Then they listened to
the Iranian national anthem as the flag was raised.</TE>
<TE>   American enemies are less visible now, scattered around the world
and perhaps hidden among us. But the American ideals worth defending
are clear. Freedom. And tolerance. Those concepts should be in
abundance at the Olympic Games.</TE>
<TE>   Another thing we know for sure: The enemy isn't a couple of guys
on skis. In fact, they're underdogs. That's another trait that has
always appealed to Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "Winter sports is not our big sport," said Majid Seghatoleslami,
the Iranian attache. "But we're going to compete."</TE>
<TE>   Iran first participated in the Winter Olympics in 1956, then
competed in 1964, '68, '72 and '76. The Iranians were absent for the
next five Winter Games before returning in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The other day, USOC President Sandy Baldwin told a story about the
Lillehammer Games in 1994: American downhill skier Tommy Moe finished
.04 of a second faster than Norwegian homeboy Kjetl Andre Aamodt to
snatch the gold medal and stun 30,000 fans who had been cheering
wildly just a couple of minutes before. On the long trek back from
the venue, Norwegians saw Baldwin's USA jacket, patted her on the
back and congratulated her on Moe's victory.</TE>
<TE>   If the fans in Salt Lake can be like the Norwegians, and cheer the
Iranians, they'll come off as better Americans.</TE>

<HD>It's Quite a Balancing Act</HD>
<DH>Ceremony: Sept. 11 changed things, but organizers went for,
and got, a mixture of history, tradition and emotion.</DH>

<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Sting relaxed in his hotel room just before heading out Friday to
shuttle through security and brave the frigid winter night, before a
crowd of more than 55,000 people, to sing--accompanied by cellist
Yo-Yo Ma--a song chosen as a reflection of the times: "Fragile."</LD>
<LD>   Unprompted, Sting said he was proud to be honored with this duty,
"celebrating athleticism and human achievement and grace."</LD>
<LD>   This was precisely the chord organizers of Friday night's opening
ceremony hoped to strike during the more than two years of planning.
"What we are so excited about is to bring heart and meaning to the
ceremonies," Scott Givens, the Salt Lake Organizing Committee's
creative director, said before the show.</LD>
<TE>   Organizers had to strike a delicate balance in producing the
ceremony, which mixed history and culture, featured ice skaters and
horses, dove-like kites and fireworks--and a character called the
"child of light," to deliver the theme of these Games that anyone can
be an inspiration.</TE>
<TE>   Also at issue were a slew of sensitive artistic, cultural and
historical elements: How best, for instance, to depict Utah for the
nation, the American West to the world?</TE>
<TE>   There also were parochial but powerful American interests and
sentiments to consider, particularly in the aftermath of the Sept. 11
terror attacks, which led to the unprecedented security surrounding
the ceremony and the Games. Friday night the torn and tattered U.S.
flag recovered from the rubble of the World Trade Center site was
carried into Rice-Eccles Stadium as the "Star-Spangled Banner" rang
out.</TE>
<TE>   But there was always the reminder that this was an event designed
to go beyond the nation, to the world.</TE>
<TE>   All these factors needed to meld together in the climax of the
program, the lighting of the caldron--done as a team by the 1980 U.S.
men's hockey team. Unlike lightings at previous Games, traditionally
performed by a solo athlete, Friday night's was the work of a team of
Americans--showing the world, in the minds of organizers, the best of
America.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The opening ceremony of an Olympics, Winter or Summer, typically
serves as one of the defining events of a Games. It is watched
worldwide by a TV audience in the billions.</TE>
<TE>   Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC Sports, the U.S. broadcaster of the
Olympics from 2000 through 2008, observed in an interview last month
that the ceremony is by far the "most important event" of the Games
for most of the 2,500 athletes in Salt Lake City--because they have
virtually no chance of winning a medal.</TE>
<TE>   "For 90% of them, that is their moment," he said. "You see it,
their exuberance."</TE>
<TE>   But the appeal goes well beyond that, Ebersol explained: "It gives
you the impression, even for a brief moment, that we can all get
along."</TE>
<TE>   John MacAloon, a University of Chicago anthropology professor who
is an Olympic historian and expert on Olympic protocol, said that's
in large part because the ceremony goes beyond bringing together of
athletes from around the world.</TE>
<TE>   In attendance Friday night was the most powerful man in the world,
President George W. Bush--sharing the moment with ordinary folks from
Utah and elsewhere, a representation of "the common cause of both
well-to-do people and famous people and ordinary people in making
this festival happen," according to MacAloon.</TE>
<TE>   The ceremony also offers powerful symbolism in which people around
the world invest their hopes and dreams, he said. The five
interlocking Olympic rings are one of the world's most recognizable
symbols.</TE>
<TE>   And, MacAloon said, the ceremony also provides "a kind of secular
taking-stock of how things are in the world today."</TE>
<TE>   Salt Lake Organizing Committee President Mitt Romney said it was
important to have "ceremonies to touch people's hearts and inspire
people, and I did not want another Hollywood minute."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 60 production companies vied for the business. In September
1999, Romney chose Don Mischer, who had produced the widely acclaimed
ceremonies at the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta--where Muhammad Ali
lit the caldron. Mischer's extensive honors include more than a dozen
Emmy awards.</TE>
<TE>   Mischer, the executive producer, estimated he could do the
ceremony for about $25 million to $30 million, comparatively
reasonable. He would bring in an experienced crew, among them
artistic director Kenny Ortega, choreographer for some of music's
biggest names (Madonna, Michael Jackson, Elton John) and musical
director Mark Watters; both had worked with Mischer in 1996, as had
producer David Goldberg, Mischer's chief lieutenant.</TE>
<TE>   Romney had another goal, to tell a story about Utah and the
West--and avoid stereotypical references while doing it.</TE>
<TE>   Mischer, according to anthropology professor MacAloon, signed up
for "by far the hardest job in any Olympic Games."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In deciding how to portray Utah and the West, Mischer drew on the
experience he had gained six years ago in Atlanta, when he was asked
to depict the American South.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing," he said, "focuses a city's or a state's or a country's
insecurity about itself more than hosting the Olympic Games."</TE>
<TE>   There's no point in undertaking a sweeping historical examination,
he said. Nor is there time.</TE>
<TE>   The ceremony runs about three hours--a big chunk of which is
devoted to the parade of nations, about an hour Friday night--and so,
"It's not like you can teach history or tell a complicated story. It
really is about music and dancing and spectacle and hopefully you
have an emotional moment every now and then."</TE>
<TE>   Two key creative decisions were reached fairly early on. One, it
was decided to make extensive use of ice as a platform for the
show--far more than in prior Winter Games ceremonies. Two, as Romney
said, "And then it became that we had segments that were connected by
a child of light, by the pervasive theme of a light within,
[representing] people who had inspired."</TE>
<TE>   These decisions drove a good deal of what would come over the next
few months.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the main rink was built big, 200 feet by 130 feet,
and a "starfield"--points of lights that could evoke an image of a
wide-open nighttime western sky--was buried into it as it was
constructed last November underneath a two-inch layer of ice.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Sarah Kawahara, one of the world's best figure skating
choreographers--Michelle Kwan had asked her last summer to design the
long program Kwan will perform here--came aboard. Kristi Yamaguchi,
the gold-medal winner in the 1992 Albertville Games, was recruited to
star in one of the skating numbers.</TE>
<TE>   More than just a starfield would be needed, though, to weave a
story about Utah and the West.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Before there were people, there was the land and there were
animals.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the first people, the native Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the white settlers.</TE>
<TE>   There, in substance, was the history lesson.</TE>
<TE>   To help tell the story of the land, Michael Curry, who designed
the imaginative costumes in the hit play "The Lion King," was hired.
He did the distinctive deer, rattlesnake and horse props, as well as
an oversize buffalo that projected images of a herd on the move--onto
the side of the animal. The technology was simple: a battery-operated
light and buffalo-shaped cutouts.</TE>
<TE>   Five tribes call Utah home: Ute, Goshute, Shoshone, Paiute and
Navajo-Dine. Last summer, Mischer and key aides spent several days
driving around the state, visiting each of the tribal councils.</TE>
<TE>   "The concept was, we would preserve their individual tribal
identity when they came into the stadium. We said, you can come in as
Goshute. You can come in as Shoshone. You can come in as Paiute. But
by the time we finish we want you all to be together.</TE>
<TE>   "</TE>
<TE>   Friday night, ceremonial tribal leaders of each of the five
nations delivered a blessing upon the athletes of the world; about
2,500 are here for the Games. Speaking in his native language, Tommy
Pacheco of the Shoshone nation said, "We are here today as brothers,
sisters and friends. Our creator will watch over us. This is good."</TE>
<TE>   The native American segment also offered musical director Watters
the chance to do something he'd first thought of six years ago in
Atlanta but didn't do then--let the audience play music, believed to
be a first in the Olympic ceremonies. Plastic flutes were passed out
to each member of the audience Friday night, in five different
colors, one for each native American tribe, and the different colored
flutes played while each of the tribes entered.</TE>
<TE>   When all five flutes were sounded together, they produced a
harmonic chord that filled the stadium--just as, on a much smaller
scale, the sound had enveloped organizers' work tent when they first
tried the flutes in late November. A "warm and engulfing thing,"
Mischer said.</TE>
<TE>   The segment about the settlers followed: "In waves they came by
the thousands. Spanish missionaries, English and Canadian trappers,
Mexicans, Chinese, German and Irish miners and Mormon pioneers."</TE>
<TE>   Within the show's organizers, the settler segment occasioned much
debate and uncertainty.</TE>
<TE>   Ortega, the artistic director, said he initially was strongly
against such a segment. He thought it would be trite. But he said he
was convinced--or, more precisely, willingly "surrendered."</TE>
<TE>   Mischer said beforehand, "I don't know how people are going to
respond to the Western thing. It's very hard to satisfy everyone....
"The history of the state--the native Americans and the pioneers did
not get along.</TE>
<TE>   "There were battles and massacres and all that. Again, you're not
teaching history. You're reflecting elements of the culture that
exist today."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   By Sept. 11, the blueprint for the show was well in place.</TE>
<TE>   After the attacks, Mischer said, "We asked, to what extent do we
change the content?</TE>
<TE>   "By and large, we felt like the artistic segments we had planned
were still the right thing to do.... To become super-patriotic was
probably the wrong thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   That said, "It was agonizing for us."</TE>
<TE>   Mischer said he was mindful of his experience at the 1984 Los
Angeles Summer Games, where he watched the opening ceremony as a fan
and was enthralled. Later, after becoming involved with the Olympics,
he met an IOC member who believed that show was "second only to
Hitler's in 1936 in terms of nationalism."</TE>
<TE>   But at a dress rehearsal Wednesday night, after listening to the
Robert Shaw version of the national anthem that starts alone and
builds to a sweeping crescendo, Mischer stopped to reflect.</TE>
<TE>   "Other nations understate their national anthem," Mischer said.
"Americans do not understate their national anthem. It's part of our
culture to do it big, with bravado."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's also part of our culture to bring out big stars for oversized
events. The show Friday featured Robbie Robertson, the Dixie Chicks
and LeAnn Rimes.</TE>
<TE>   "Fragile," the song Sting wrote in the 1980s, has since Sept. 11
achieved a renewed popularity.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a song about violence and the fragility of life in the face
of terrorism, guns and bullets," Sting said. "We are fragile beings."</TE>
<TE>   Givens, the creative director of SLOC, said the title said it all:
"That's where we think we are with peace in the world right now."</TE>
<TE>   The spot with Sting and Yo-Yo Ma also illustrated dramatically the
challenge facing organizers whose main goal, above all, was to give
no offense.</TE>
<TE>   Olympic protocol calls for the release of doves. But animal-rights
activists would be sure to protest bitterly if real doves were used
at night, because the birds most likely wouldn't be able to find
their way back to accustomed shelter, Givens said.</TE>
<TE>   The spot also underscored the challenges of producing live music
outside, in winter, at night.</TE>
<TE>   Ma, for instance, was hardly about to take his $5-million cello
outside.</TE>
<TE>   So organizers made extensive use of recorded tracks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Early Friday morning, the wind howled and broke four camera
cranes. One "snapped like a toothpick," Mischer said.</TE>
<TE>   Crews worked all day to rebuild the other three.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, the wind also ripped apart three balloons that had been
set to rise at the close of the ceremony. "It felt like a tornado,"
Mischer said. The wind also threatened a stunt at the end of the
program, in which organizers set the ice on fire--a trick they had
rehearsed perhaps 30 times.</TE>
<TE>   But if some things inevitably went wrong as the ceremony got
underway, much went right. The ice trick worked just fine.</TE>
<TE>   An eagle flew on command around the stadium, much to the delight
of President Bush. A horse that had balked at walking on ice carried
out the Paiute leader, and when the World Trade Center flag was held
aloft, the moment was marked by absolute silence.</TE>
<TE>   As the parade of nations began, the mood shift was palpable. Even
the Mormon Tabernacle Choir joined in when the stadium audience broke
into the wave.</TE>
<TE>   For a couple hours, it was even possible to forget one was living
in a 21st-century equivalent of an armed camp.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the program, television producer-director George
Schlatter walked in to the control booth and bellowed his approval:
"Go top that, somebody!"</TE>
<TE>   As far as Goldberg is concerned, somebody did. As he was
accompanying President Bush out of the stadium, he said the president
turned to him and said: "A great day, really well done."</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Up the back stairs of Rice-Eccles Stadium they crept, a special force
unlike any other in U.S. history, clad in black jackets so they
wouldn't be seen in the dark.</LD>
<LD>   As they reached their appointed destination at the top, one group
went right, another went left. And one man broke off and for a moment
stood alone, silhouetted against the night sky, waiting in the wings,
his jacket now off.</LD>
<LD>   At the climax of Friday night's opening ceremony of the XIXth
Winter Olympic Games, the spotlight swung toward him. There, in the
glare, stood Mike Eruzione, who 22 years ago had scored the winning
goal in the most memorable Olympic upset of all time, when a bunch of
young American men prevailed over a seemingly unbeatable Soviet
hockey machine.</LD>
<TE>   In a repetition of what he had done on the medals stand after the
1980 U.S. men's hockey team had done the unthinkable and won the gold
medal, Eruzione waved his hand. From the shadows, the rest of the
U.S. team joined him in a moment intended to capture the essence of
the American spirit in the wake of the terrorist attacks, and they
lit the caldron.</TE>
<TE>   The ceremony culminated months of secrecy by Olympic organizers
and marked a significant departure from the traditional approach to
lighting the Olympic caldron. Usually, one athlete is chosen for the
honor, such as Muhammad Ali, a 1960 Olympian, who memorably lit the
torch at the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   But this was meant to remind the nation and the world, organizers
hoped, what is possible with teamwork and passion and will.</TE>
<TE>   It was Jan. 10 when Salt Lake Organizing Committee President Mitt
Romney, ceremony executive producer Don Mischer, NBC Sports Chairman
Dick Ebersol, NBC Olympics executive vice president David Neal and
SLOC creative director Scott Givens made the final decision that the
hockey team would light the caldron.</TE>
<TE>   Who better, they reasoned, to inspire a nation that could use
inspiration? Who better to represent American values to the world?</TE>
<TE>   Until Friday night, the choice remained a secret, known only to a
few.</TE>
<TE>   Most often, a winter-sports athlete from the host nation lights
the caldron at the Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>   At the very outset, though, Romney wanted Nelson Mandela, the
former South African prisoner of conscience, now a statesman, to do
it.</TE>
<TE>   "Our theme would be well expressed, and perhaps best expressed, by
Nelson Mandela, who has really inspired the world," Romney said.</TE>
<TE>   Inquiries were made discreetly. Mandela was unavailable.</TE>
<TE>   Romney then proposed the hockey team. Givens said, "Sounds good."
Mischer was, according to Romney, "somewhat comfortable, [not]
pulling one direction or the other."</TE>
<TE>   But NBC's Ebersol wasn't convinced.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath, Romney's attention was focused for weeks on
security concerns at the Games. When he had time to think again about
the ceremony, he wondered if maybe one of "heroes or victims" of the
attacks would be best, perhaps a firefighter or police officer, but
ultimately that was rejected.</TE>
<TE>   "Our feeling is the Olympics is an international event. While 9/11
is an international tragedy and people all over the world were
affected, it was perhaps too U.S.-centric," Romney said.</TE>
<TE>   Ebersol, meantime, immersed himself in videotape of the 1980
hockey tournament--and to think about the symbolism of the U.S.
team's victory.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. team's win over the Soviets in the semifinals, and then
the gold-medal victory over Finland, lifted a nation that was then in
the midst of a hostage crisis with Iran.</TE>
<TE>   It had reminded the nation of a cherished national value, American
can-do spirit, something that rang especially true in the wake of
Sept. 11. It was soon settled.</TE>
<TE>   The 1980 U.S. hockey team would light the caldron.</TE>
<TE>   The discussion turned to the supporting cast, important players in
their own right:</TE>
<TE>   Who ought to carry the Olympic flag? Who ought to carry the flame
into and around the stadium?</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, the eight flag-bearers are divided into five and
three, representing the five interlocking Olympic rings and the three
"pillars" of the Olympic movement--sport, culture and environment.</TE>
<TE>   Choosing wasn't all that easy. Eric Heiden, for example, the
five-time gold-medal winning speedskater, said he refused an
invitation unless he could light the caldron.</TE>
<TE>   But by mid-January, the group reconvened in Romney's office and
settled on an all-star lineup:</TE>
<TE>   Astronaut and former U.S. Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) was chosen to
represent the Americas. Lech Walesa of Poland, the former labor union
leader who became the country's president, was picked for Europe.
Bishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, instrumental in the abolition of
apartheid, for Africa. Double gold-medal winning ski jumper Kazuyoshi
Funaki of Japan for Asia. And runner Cathy Freeman, who lit the
caldron at the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney and then went on to win
the women's 400 meters, for Oceania.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the three "pillars": French skiing star and IOC member
Jean-Claude Killy for sport, movie director Steven Spielberg for
culture and Jean-Michel Cousteau for the environment.</TE>
<TE>   The flame would be carried around the stadium in pairs, continuing
the theme of connectedness.</TE>
<TE>   Gold-medal figure skaters Scott Hamilton and Peggy Fleming were
picked to bring the flame into the stadium.</TE>
<TE>   They would hand off to skiers Phil Mahre and Bill Johnson, gold
medalists at the 1984 Sarajevo Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>   Then back to speedskaters Bonnie Blair and Dan Jansen, both
gold-medal winners.</TE>
<TE>   Then to the Shea family, the country's only three-generational
Olympic family. Plans were for Jack, Jim and Jimmy Shea to appear
together. But Jack died last month at age 91 when his car was stuck
by a drunk driver.Gold-medalist Picabo Street, a skier, and hockey
gold medalist Cammi Granato would run the flame to the top of the
stadium, where Eruzione would accept it.</TE>
<TE>   Then he would call for his teammates.</TE>
<TE>   During rehearsal early Friday, all but two of the members of the
1980 team were on hand. "It wasn't until last night at 1 o'clock in
the morning that we figured out we were going to be the guys,"
Eruzione said, "It was like, 'wow.'"'</TE>
<TE>   All the flag-bearers and torch-runners and skaters were worthy,
Mischer said. But of the hockey team, he said, "Certainly, they're
deserving."</TE>

<DH>Controversy: Jones, DeMont and '72 U.S. basketball team
lost gold medals, and IOC denied appeals.</DH>
<SE>INSIDE THE IOC :This is the last in a four-part series that
has examined internal minutes of executive board meetings of the
International Olympic Committee.</SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>These are moments frozen in time, controversies from the past that
linger today, raising questions of fairness and the nature of the
Olympic spirit.</LD>
<LD>   Three times, the International Olympic Committee's executive board
has been asked to rewrite the past for the benefit--some say
justice--of American athletes. Three times it has declined.</LD>
<LD>   Roy Jones, perhaps the best boxer of his generation, is stuck with
silver awarded him in Seoul in 1988.</LD>
<TE>   Swimmer Rick DeMont, a 16-year-old stripped of a gold medal at the
Munich Games in 1972 in for taking a medicine he needed to breathe,
is still empty-handed.</TE>
<TE>   And the 1972 U.S. basketball team is still considered runner-up to
the Soviet Union. Winners at first, then losers.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes," IOC Director General Francois Carrard said in a
recent interview, a piece of the Games turns out to be "tragic or
dramatic. But it's a part of history too."</TE>
<TE>   A review of the IOC executive board's confidential minutes
obtained by The Times offers insight into the intricacies of Olympic
politics in each case--even as they highlight the human capacity for
error and arrogance as well as humility and heartbreak.</TE>
<TE>   Even today, years later, the cases raise questions about
institutional integrity, the sanctity of principle and the
responsibility of Olympic officials to make things right.</TE>
<TE>   The Olympics survive because, as acclaimed U.S. film director Jon
Turtletaub said Sunday during the opening of the IOC's 113th general
assembly, the Games represent "the world as we wish it could be."</TE>
<TE>   "Clocks don't lie," Turtletaub said. "Tape measures don't
cheat.... During the Olympics your value is based purely on your
ability. And, usually, the best prevails."</TE>
<TE>   What happens, though, when reality clashes with the Olympic ideal?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ROY JONES</TE>
<TE>   Seoul 1988</TE>
<TE>   Three days before he fought South Korea's Park Si Hun in the
light-middleweight championship, Jones had this to say: "I know how
tough it is to get a decision [here] against a South Korean, but it
doesn't matter. If they cheat me, that's OK. I'll know I really won
it."</TE>
<TE>   In the ring, Jones dominated Park. A company charting the fight
for NBC had Jones landing 86 punches to Park's 32. Park was awarded a
3-2 decision.</TE>
<TE>   "Veteran ring observers of all nationalities, reporters, referees
and fans agreed that it was the worst decision they had ever seen,"
Olympic historian David Wallechinsky writes in the most recent
version of his authoritative book on the Summer Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Park reportedly apologized to Jones, telling him through an
interpreter, according to Wallechinsky, "I am sorry. I lost the
fight. I feel very bad."</TE>
<TE>   There were allegations of bribes. Allegations of payback for
pro-U.S. decisions at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles. Several
journalists quoted judge Hiouad Larbi of Morocco saying, "The
American won easily. So easily, in fact, that I was positive my four
fellow judges would score the fight for the American by a wide
margin. So I voted for the Korean to make the score only 4-1 for the
American and not embarrass the host country."</TE>
<TE>   Wallechinsky writes that judges from Uruguay and Uganda did the
same thing.</TE>
<TE>   The matter rested until the spring of 1996, when files surfaced
from the Stasi, the former East German secret police, purporting
murky payments--origin unknown--to boxing officials at the Seoul
Games.</TE>
<TE>   Later that year, the U.S. Olympic Committee asked the IOC to award
Jones an additional gold medal--it did not ask the IOC to take
Park's. Anita DeFrantz, the senior American in the IOC and a member
of the executive board, also requested an investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Then-IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch agreed, according to the
minutes, adding, "What had happened in Seoul was very clear."
Samaranch went on to say the IOC "had had problems with boxing in the
past," and that after the Seoul Olympics, he had spoken with
officials from the International Boxing Federation, and told them the
sport was "in danger of being dropped from the Olympic program"
unless steps were taken "to avoid a repeat of such [judging]
scandals."</TE>
<TE>   The IOC set up a task force that reported back in November 1996,
and longtime IOC member Keba Mbaye of Senegal, who once served as a
judge on the World Court in The Hague, announced the initial results:
"Everyone agreed that the final decision of the bout had been unfair
to Roy Jones, as it was obvious that he ought to have won."</TE>
<TE>   The judges had been given money by their Korean hosts, Mbaye said.
"There was also no doubt that money had been distributed to the tune
of $300 per person for 16 days, to compensate, it was claimed, for
the fact that the judges got out late after the competitions and were
therefore unable to go to restaurants easily," he said.</TE>
<TE>   To understand what a rich per diem that was, NBA players today--14
years later--get $93 a day when on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Samaranch asked for a further investigation and asked Carrard to
find Larbi, the judge who allegedly told reporters he had voted for
Park to appease the host nation.</TE>
<TE>   Carrard reported back that while the judge spoke openly about the
per diem given African boxing officials, he denied telling reporters
that he believed Jones won and said the comments falsely attributed
to him had been a "humiliating blow to his career."</TE>
<TE>   Jones, according to Larbi, had struck two "irregular" blows with
the flat of his hand, and this "had been a factor in Mr. Larbi's
decision to award the fight to the Korean," Carrard said.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with the conflicting information, DeFrantz offered this
compromise: Because Jones "had been a good ambassador for sport,"
perhaps the IOC would "consider giving him something in appreciation
of the fact that he had complied with the investigators and never
complained about the situation."</TE>
<TE>   Samaranch recommended him for the Olympic Order, the IOC's highest
honor. Only four other Americans have been so honored--track and
field great Jesse Owens, four-time discus gold medalist Al Oerter,
DeFrantz and tennis legend Arthur Ashe.</TE>
<TE>   In September 1997, DeFrantz presented Jones with the order.</TE>
<TE>   "I appreciate the efforts of everyone to fight and fight and fight
for this, because they thought I deserved some kind of justice,"
Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   However, he added that he would "die with a little hope in me"
that the gold medal would some day, somehow be his.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   RICK DeMONT</TE>
<TE>   Munich 1972</TE>
<TE>   DeMont had taken allergy medicines since he was a young boy. When
he qualified that summer for the U.S. team, he filled out a standard
medical form listing the medications he was taking.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, the U.S. team physicians never bothered before the
Games to look at the form.</TE>
<TE>   The night before his 400-meter freestyle race, DeMont woke up
wheezing and took a tablet of a drug called Marax, unaware it
contained the stimulant ephedrine, which is banned by the IOC. He
took another tablet the morning of the race.</TE>
<TE>   That night, the 16-year-old from the Bay Area raced and won by a
hundredth of a second over Australia's Bradford Cooper.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, DeMont, the world-record holder in the 1,500
meters, easily swam a qualifying heat in that race. The next day, he
was told he had flunked doping control and would not be able to swim
in the 1,500 final.</TE>
<TE>   "A distraught DeMont watched from the stands," Wallechinsky
writes.</TE>
<TE>   The IOC medical commission had reported to the executive board
that DeMont "needed this drug, not for his sporting performance but
to keep alive."</TE>
<TE>   The commission had asked U.S. officials why they had not declared
DeMont was being given the drug because "they knew it was on the
prohibited list." The minutes say, "They were unable to give a
satisfactory reply."</TE>
<TE>   The commission "had to be consistent in its work and declare the
swimmer excluded," meaning from the 1,500-meter final, the minutes
show. The "complicated" question was what to do about the 400-meter
race.</TE>
<TE>   The medical commission "recommended that [DeMont] keep the gold
medal but be excluded from further participation," which seemed
"reasonable on humanitarian grounds."</TE>
<TE>   But the executive board reversed course: "Some level of
consistency had to be kept."</TE>
<TE>   Cooper was given the gold. The silver was awarded to U.S. swimmer
Steven Genter, who finished third. There would be no bronze.</TE>
<TE>   After the decision was announced, press and public opposition was
fierce. The U.S. delegation appealed. But Avery Brundage, an American
who was in his final days as IOC president, agreed that "while the
board sympathized, there were several similar cases, and the IOC was
bound by its rules," according to the minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Testifying during a congressional inquiry three years later,
Douglas Roby, a U.S. IOC member, said he believed DeMont would have
had his gold if the team doctor had simply "assumed responsibility
for the oversight."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, DeMont has mounted several bids for redress.</TE>
<TE>   In March 1996, he argued that his case was like that of an
Australian swimmer, Samantha Riley, who had tested positive for a
painkiller a couple months before but had not been banned. The
executive board turned him down.</TE>
<TE>   That same year, DeMont sued the USOC. As part of a settlement
reached in the case, the USOC acknowledged last year that DeMont had
disclosed his medical condition and use of Marax to its doctors, but
the information had not been relayed "to the proper authorities."</TE>
<TE>   DeMont, now an assistant swim coach at the University of Arizona,
had pressed the suit against the USOC because his name continued to
be linked to athletes found to have used performance-enhancing drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Last February, the IOC considered DeMont's case again, albeit
briefly. An internal legal advisory panel reviewed the matter but
declined to take action.</TE>
<TE>   Last April, the USOC honored DeMont, presenting him at a meeting
in San Jose with a black leather jacket given to all U.S. Olympians.
Inside, the jacket was inscribed with DeMont's name, his events and
the words, "Munich 1972." "It means a lot to get the support of the
USOC," DeMont said. "I'm hoping this might be a steppingstone toward
getting something similar from the IOC--if I can stay alive long
enough."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   U.S. BASKETBALL</TE>
<TE>   Munich 1972</TE>
<TE>   The United States had never lost a basketball game in Olympic play
until the gold-medal game of the 1972 Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   The records show that the Soviet Union prevailed, 51-50. But there
are countless numbers of people who believe the United States did not
lose that game.</TE>
<TE>   It remains one of the great controversies in international sports.</TE>
<TE>   With three seconds to play, Doug Collins of Illinois State was
fouled by the USSR's Sako Sakandelidze.</TE>
<TE>   Collins--now coach of the Washington Wizards--made two free throws
to give the U.S. its first lead, 50-49.</TE>
<TE>   The Soviets inbounded the ball. Two seconds later, the referee, a
Brazilian, noted a disturbance at the scorer's table and called a
timeout.</TE>
<TE>   The Soviet coach, Vladimir Kondrashkin, claimed he had called for
a timeout after Collins' first shot.</TE>
<TE>   With one second to go, the Soviets were awarded a timeout. When
play resumed, they inbounded. Time ran out. The Americans began
celebrating.</TE>
<TE>   But the secretary-general of the International Amateur Basketball
Assn., Britain's R. William Jones, then intervened--even though he
technically had no right to make any decisions.</TE>
<TE>   He ordered the clock set back to three seconds.</TE>
<TE>   The Soviets inbounded again. Ivan Edeshko threw a long pass to
Sasha Belov, who caught it, pushed past two Americans and scored. Now
the Soviets celebrated wildly.</TE>
<TE>   The protest was heard by a five-man international basketball
federation jury of appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The intermediate step--going first to the international
federation, instead of the IOC--was critical: Though the Olympic
Games are the IOC's, the sports at the Games are run by the
federations, and the IOC has long been reluctant to interfere with
what it typically views as any sort of "internal" federation decision
on what is called "technical" grounds--in essence, the rules of the
game.</TE>
<TE>   The five-man jury ruled against the U.S., 3-2. Delegates from
Italy and Puerto Rico voted to disallow the Soviet basket, which
would have given the U.S. the 50-49 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Critics saw something sinister in the outcome: This was during the
Cold War, and the three votes against the U.S. were cast by
representatives from Hungary, Poland and Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   The executive board, meeting hours after the jury of appeal issued
its decision, declined the U.S. appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. basketball team boycotted the medal ceremony. To this
day, the team refuses to accept the silver medals.</TE>
<TE>   In March 1996, the executive board was asked to take a fresh look.
It opted to "study" the issue--board-speak for tabling the matter.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is for the institution," Carrard said in a recent
interview. "Do we rewrite history?</TE>
<TE>   "I think there are two things. The actual record of what happened
is part of history. Someone won or someone lost.... This being said,
if it is recognized ... that something wrong took place, one must
look for a form of recognition of the situation."</TE>

<HD>Kwan to Spend Some Time in Athletes' Village</HD>

<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Michelle Kwan, intent on savoring the Olympic experiences she missed
when she chose not to stay in the athletes' village at Nagano in
1998, said Friday she will remain in Salt Lake City for the rest of
the Games instead of returning to her Lake Arrowhead training base.</LD>
<LD>   Kwan said she will alternate staying in the village and staying
with her parents at a hotel but will practice at the official Olympic
arenas, the Salt Lake Ice Center and the secondary Steiner Arena.</LD>
<LD>   Kwan, who narrowly missed winning a gold medal in 1998, is favored
to win this year. She had planned to fly back to California today
after marching in Friday's opening ceremony. She changed her mind
about returning late Thursday after testing the facility and finding
it to her liking.</LD>
<TE>   The women's competition doesn't begin until Feb. 19.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'I could stay here instead of wasting two days through
flying,'" the six-time U.S. champion and four-time world champion
said. "Travel being the way it is, with security checkpoints,
everyone can relate to that."</TE>
<TE>   Sasha Cohen of Laguna Niguel, runner-up to Kwan at last month's
U.S. competition, planned to return to Lake Arrowhead after the
opening ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of the altitude, and also just to have a place that I can
really train and not be in a competition mode," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Hughes, the third member of the U.S. women's delegation,
will leave for Colorado Springs, Colo., where she practiced before
arriving in Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   "Just to get away," she said. "We're not competing for two weeks.
It'll be nice. When I come back, I'll be fully mentally ready."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen said she has scrapped plans to try a quadruple salchow and
become the first woman to land a quadruple jump in competition.</TE>
<TE>   She missed three attempts this season and wasn't landing it often
enough in practice to satisfy her coach, John Nicks.</TE>
<TE>   "We were training it after nationals," she said, "but more
recently, Mr. Nicks and I decided we want to do a safer program. My
triple-triple [combinations] have gone really well and we're
excited."</TE>
<TE>   Said Nicks: "Surprisingly enough, Sasha and I have been more or
less on the same page the last two or three weeks.... We decided to
play the percentages and go for two clean programs."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Facing a battery of reporters during a news conference Friday,
Kwan said she found it difficult to believe four years have passed
since Nagano.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels like yesterday I was at a press conference in Nagano,
talking about another opportunity to go to the Olympics," the
21-year-old Torrance native said. "Wow, here I am now in Salt Lake.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad I stayed amateur."</TE>
<TE>   Kwan offered another of her frequent hints that she might stay
Olympic eligible until the 2006 Turin Games and pointed to the
presence of 29-year-old Maria Butyrskaya of Russia as a precedent.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't guarantee you anything," she said. "Skating is such a
wonderful sport and I'm having so much fun doing it. Competition is
stressful, but who knows?"</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>One of the great untruths about Salt Lake City is the myth that you
can't buy alcohol because of the deep-seated Mormon influence. The
first night here, I walked into a brew-pub called Squatters, sat down
at the bar and ordered a beer. Pretty simple.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, being the investigative journalist that I am, I felt
the need to confirm this fact with multiple sources, such as Zephyr,
Metropolitan and Axis.All three establishments offered hassle-free
alcohol. Getting a drink in Utah isn't necessarily the hard part.
Serving the drink, and getting drunk, can be difficult.</LD>
<LD>   The numerous regulations set by the Utah Department of Alcoholic
Beverage Control establish a series of hair-splitting rules and also
limit the alcohol content of the beverages.</LD>
<TE>   For instance, you can't have more than one drink in front of you
at a time in a restaurant. And a place operating with only a
restaurant license can't serve liquor from behind a bar.</TE>
<TE>   That's why the P.F. Chang's here, unlike most restaurants in the
chain, doesn't have a bar. But it does have waitresses who can offer
drinks to people while they are waiting for a table.</TE>
<TE>   That's legal. On the following condition: "The law states you've
got to express an interest in dining," said Ken Wynn, the director of
the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control.</TE>
<TE>   It is, however, one of the regulations that is not strictly
enforced.</TE>
<TE>   "We wouldn't expect a waitress to tackle somebody if they walked
in, had a couple of drinks and walked out," Wynn said.</TE>
<TE>   Another loophole involves sponsorship into what are known here as
"private clubs" (you and I call them bars). These are places where
hard liquor, wine and beer are sold, with or without food, at a bar
or table.</TE>
<TE>   They're for members only, but tourists can buy a temporary visitor
card. Usually they cost $5 for a two-week pass. And members of the
club may have up to five guests. What happens is that the bouncers
will pair up members with visitors, even if they've just met. As in,
"This is Steve. He'll be your sponsor tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Once inside, it doesn't mean you're well on your way to
inebriation. Beer in Utah has an alcohol content of only 3.2%,
(unlike most beer which is usually about 4%). State laws limit the
amount of primary liquor in a mixed drink to one ounce. A special
dispenser on top of the bottles regulates the amount poured.</TE>
<TE>   However, there's no limit on the amount of secondary liquors
allowed in a drink, which makes Long Island iced tea especially
popular around here.</TE>
<TE>   And, you can order another shot, served in a separate glass and
called a sidecar.</TE>
<TE>   These next two weeks are all about hard work, determination and
dedication. They will result in Olympic gold medals or a good buzz,
depending on the pursuit.</TE>

<HD>By George, U.S. to Show Its Medal Now</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY HARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Even before the collapse of the U.S. team at the 1988 Winter Olympics
in Calgary, Canada, was complete, desperate U.S. Olympic Committee
officials called on George Steinbrenner.</LD>
<LD>   Asking him to turn his attention from beating the American League
East to beating the world, they appointed him to chair an Olympic
overview commission. The mission was to ensure that U.S. winter
athletes would never again be as unprepared as they were in Calgary,
where they would win a mere six medals.</LD>
<LD>   One year later, Steinbrenner's commission released a report
calling for a streamlined USOC, more accountability from the
governing bodies for the winter sports and increased funding for
athletes.</LD>
<TE>   The report, much of it paid for by Steinbrenner, concluded that
"winning medals must always be the primary goal."</TE>
<TE>   "By Lillehammer in 1994 and Nagano in 1998 and wherever the Games
are in 2002, I think you'll see some real differences," Harvey
Schiller, then USOC executive director, said later.</TE>
<TE>   The year is 2002, the Winter Olympics are in Salt Lake City, and
USOC officials indeed are eagerly anticipating some real differences.
They predict U.S. athletes will win 20 medals, seven more than ever
before in the Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>   They are so committed to that number that Lloyd Ward, who became
the USOC's executive director last year, said bonuses for the
Colorado Springs-based staff are tied to its realization.</TE>
<TE>   But, according to estimates from various media outlets, the USOC's
number could be conservative. Predictions for U.S. medals range from
Sports Illustrated's 22 to the Associated Press' 33.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, the outlook is optimistic enough for Sandra Baldwin,
USOC president, to declare this "the best U.S. Winter Olympic team
ever. We are psyched."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back to that day in Calgary when Steinbrenner, a
public-sector member of the USOC who later would become a vice
president, was summoned, USOC spokesman Mike Moran said this week:
"The Olympic overview commission was, in retrospect, the most
important initiative we have ever undertaken. It established a path
for our future that we are still following today."</TE>
<TE>   It has taken 13 years since the Steinbrenner report was adopted
for the results to materialize.</TE>
<TE>   The United States made strides in the medal count in the three
Winter Olympics between Calgary and Salt Lake City, winning 11 medals
in 1992 at Albertville, France; 13 in 1994 at Lillehammer, Norway,
and 13 in 1998 at Nagano, Japan, but factors beyond the USOC's
influence were largely responsible.</TE>
<TE>   One was the new world order established after the collapse of the
Eastern Bloc.</TE>
<TE>   East Germany was one of two Winter Olympic superpowers and, as
expected, unified Germany is even more dominant, although there are
signs that could change in the future. The Germans won 29 medals in
1998 and are expected to again lead the medal standings here with as
many as 34.</TE>
<TE>   But athletes from republics of the former Soviet Union are more
challenged as the sports structure that had been controlled and
heavily funded by the government deteriorates.</TE>
<TE>   First participating in the Winter Olympics in 1956, the Soviet
Union finished first in the medal count in seven of nine Games in
which all of its republics competed under the hammer and sickle. The
Soviets won a high of 29 medals in Calgary, 23 more than the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   Competing as the Unified Team in 1992, the republics combined for
23 medals. Under their own flags, they won 31 in 1994, led by
Russia's 23. That number decreased in 1998 to 24, including 18 by
Russia. Projections are that the number will drop further this year.</TE>
<TE>   A larger factor in the United States' improved medal totals,
however, was the increase in medals available as sports such as
snowboard, freestyle skiing, short-track speedskating, curling and
skeleton have been added to the program. In Calgary, 138 medals were
awarded. In Salt Lake City, the number is 234.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. athletes won five more medals in Albertville in 1992 than
they had won four years earlier in Calgary, but four of them came in
sports that weren't on the program in 1988. So it's not necessarily
accurate to say that the United States improved much immediately
after the Calgary Games.</TE>
<TE>   Percentage-wise, the United States had its best Winter Games in
1980 in Lake Placid, where it won 8% of the medals available. The
percentage dropped to an all-time low of 4.3% in Calgary, rose to
6.4% in Albertville, rose again to 7.2% in Lillehammer, then dropped
again to 6.3% in Nagano.</TE>
<TE>   But if the United States wins 20 medals this year as predicted by
the USOC, the leap to 8.5% will be significant.</TE>
<TE>   Moran said that the United States is finally beginning to reap the
benefits from the funding program called for in Steinbrenner's report
that enables athletes to earn substantially more money than they did
before 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Until 1989, the most that any athlete had received in one year
from the USOC was $2,500. In the last four years, through an
$18-million USOC program called Podium 2002, eight athletes on this
year's Olympic team earned more than $100,000--with a high of
$140,000--and 20 others earned between $60,000 and $90,000. Members
of the U.S. women's ice hockey team, trying to defend the gold medal
they won in Nagano, have earned an average of $106,000.</TE>
<TE>   The USOC also has a job-opportunities program through its sponsors
that enables athletes to earn extra income.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. medalists here will receive $25,000 for gold, $15,000 for
silver and $10,000 for bronze, up from $10,000, $7,500 and $5,000
when the USOC began the incentive program in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   That is on top of money provided by the USOC and its various
sports governing bodies for coaches, trainers, psychologists and, in
the case of figure skaters, choreographers and costume designers.
Also provided are funds for travel, housing and health insurance.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the money available, Ward said that U.S. athletes
are able to remain in their sports longer, creating more experienced
Olympic teams. This is the oldest U.S. Olympic winter team ever, with
an average age of 26.</TE>
<TE>   "We're only doing the minimum," Ward said. "Some of our elite
athletes are receiving a substantial amount of money, but I'd like to
see us spread it out more so that we can take care of more athletes.
That might enable us to be more competitive across the board."</TE>
<TE>   The United States is traditionally strong in figure skating,
Alpine skiing and speedskating. This year, it could win medals in
men's bobsled for the first time since 1956 and Nordic combined for
the first time. It also has hopes in ski jumping, in which it hasn't
won a medal since 1924. But it still has no contenders in biathlon or
cross-country skiing.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to have some advantages here from the home field,
like we did in 1980, Norway did in 1994 and Japan did in 1998,"
Baldwin said.</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge is to keep that going after Salt Lake City."</TE>
<TE>   Steinbrenner thought of that too. In order for Salt Lake City in
1991 to earn designation as the U.S. candidate in bidding for the
1998 Winter Olympics, it had to promise the USOC that it would build
world-class winter sports venues--win or lose. It lost that time to
Nagano but honored its commitment by beginning construction. It won
the international bid four years later for 2002 and had most of the
facilities completed by 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "The Olympic overview commission was very smart to ask, 'How can
you be a winter sports power if you don't have the facilities?'"
Baldwin said. "Now we have a major training center in the West for
our athletes in a major city, easily accessible by air, with jobs and
more than one university. Salt Lake City fills all of our needs.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying we're a winter sports power yet, but we're here to
let the world know we're getting better."</TE>

<HD>Canadian Pair Is Romancing the Gold</HD>
<DH>Figure skating: Chemistry of Sale and Pelletier helped make
them world champions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She was a hostess at a restaurant called Joey Tomato. He was a former
hockey player whose father financed his figure skating lessons only
to enhance his NHL prospects.</LD>
<LD>   World pair champions Jamie Sale and David Pelletier of Canada
weren't a match made in heaven, and they didn't click at their first
meeting. But since rejoining forces in 1998, they've scripted a
remarkable success story that could have a golden ending after
tonight's short program and Monday's free skate at the Salt Lake Ice
Center.</LD>
<LD>   Sale, 24, and Pelletier, 27, have a strong chance to end Russia's
38-year Olympic stranglehold on the pairs gold medal. Athletic and
emotive, they have an undeniable chemistry that reflects their
romantic relationship. It's appropriate, then, that they will perform
their long program to "Love Story," the routine that launched their
international career.</LD>
<TE>   "We had the elements right away, but as far as training, knowing
each other, that developed over time," said Sale (pronounced
Sal-LAY). "It comes with any relationship. It's like a couple, when
they first meet. You're two different people and then you get to know
each other and become kind of like one."</TE>
<TE>   They were never more in unison than at last year's world
competition, where they won before an adoring crowd. However, they
made the potentially disruptive decision last summer to switch
coaches and training bases, from Richard Gauthier in Montreal--near
Pelletier's hometown of Sayabec--to Jan Ullmark in Edmonton, Sale's
hometown.</TE>
<TE>   The prime benefit was psychological rather than strategic.</TE>
<TE>   "He's my old singles coach, and working with him has been really
good for me," Sale said. "And he knows David well now too. He's very
calm and so experienced. He's been in this business for so long he
knows exactly how to handle everything."</TE>
<TE>   Sale and Pelletier were first matched in 1996 but didn't find any
magic. The second meeting was different.</TE>
<TE>   "I look back and I think we were both ready. We're both happy we
waited those extra two years," Sale said. "We're both more mature. I
was ready to leave home and he was ready for a change. Timing is
everything in life."</TE>
<TE>   Their partnership has a depth that transforms even large arenas
into intimate settings. Their natural affinity has been enhanced by
the choreography of Lori Nichol, who formerly designed programs for
U.S. and world champion Michelle Kwan and 2001 U.S. men's champion
Tim Goebel.</TE>
<TE>   "She doesn't teach us how to skate. We know how to skate,"
Pelletier said. "She just makes it look amazing. She's a genius."</TE>
<TE>   Sale praised Nichol's ability to tailor routines to each skater's
strengths.</TE>
<TE>   "She finds a way to bring out the best quality in all of us," Sale
said. "I think she sees me in her a lot. She told me that's another
reason she really bonded with us. She's real. That's not to say other
choreographers aren't. She's very real, and we appreciate her. We
really trust her."</TE>
<TE>   Sale and Pelletier's main competition will come from Elena
Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze of Russia, the 1998 and 1999 world
champions and 1998 Olympic silver medalists. The Chinese duo of Xue
Shen and Hongbo Zhao, whose intricate lifts and daring throws have
helped them finish second at the world meet twice and third last
year, also are contenders. Possibles are Tatiana Totmianina and Maxim
Marinin of Russia, who train in Chicago, and Maria Petrova and Alexei
Tikhonov of Russia.</TE>
<TE>   But there's no prohibitive favorite.</TE>
<TE>   "After watching the past World Series and Super Bowl, you can
never predict anything," said John Zimmerman, who shares the U.S.
pairs title with Kyoko Ina. "Especially with the Canadians, Russians,
Chinese and us. I know Jamie and David continuously had a strong
year, but I think a couple of us in the top four or five had strong
years."</TE>
<TE>   Pelletier enjoys the unpredictability.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's fun to be part of pair skating right now," he said.
"If you look at the ladies you say, 'It's either going to be this one
or this one. The men, this one or this one.' The pairs, it's this one
or this one or this one or this one."</TE>
<TE>   Zimmerman, hampered at last month's U.S. championships by a broken
finger he suffered while playing football, said the finger has healed
and won't impede his ability to lift his partner.</TE>
<TE>   Ina, who competed in two previous Olympics with Jason Dungjen,
said Friday she feels like an Olympic rookie because the Games are in
the U.S. "I'm overwhelmed," she said. "I'm so honored. I can't wait
until it starts."</TE>
<TE>   Ina and Zimmerman are longshot medal contenders, but the
second-ranked U.S. pair of Tiffany Scott and Philip Dulebohn has a
more modest goal. "Our hopes this Olympics are to move up from our
finish at worlds, which was 11th," Scott said. "We're hoping for a
top-seven finish."</TE>

<KH>THE DAY IN SALT LAKE</KH>
<HD>Only the Dutch Get Cold Feet</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Roaring gusts of wind reaching 50 mph wiped out the first scheduled
competition of the Salt Lake City Games, 90-meter ski jump
qualifying, which turned the rest of the day over to the most
grueling endurance sport on the Winter Olympic agenda.</LD>
<LD>   The opening ceremony.</LD>
<LD>   Shivering and shaking for more than two hours in an ice box known
around here as Rice-Eccles (rhymes with icicles ) Stadium, with
temperatures in the teens and the wind-chill factor deepening even
further, were some 2,500 athletes, 55,000 spectators and the first
larger-than-life hero of the 2002 Olympics:</LD>
<TE>   That guy from Bermuda who completed his lap in the "Parade of
Champions" wearing short pants.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, his name is Patrick Singleton and he competes in
the one-man luge, primarily because Bermuda doesn't have two lugers.
Singleton comprised the entire Bermuda athletic delegation, going it
alone and underdressed, much tougher than any of those weak-kneed
Dutch, who still didn't have a volunteer to carry the flag as of
Thursday because it was going to be "too cold.''</TE>
<TE>   What can you expect from a nation of indoor speedskaters and
soccer players?</TE>
<TE>   (Funny, members of the Dutch soccer team use the very same excuse
every time someone asks, "How come you're not going to the World
Cup?'')</TE>
<TE>   Too cold? Yes, that might be a problem here, this being the Winter
Olympics. International Olympic President Committee President Jacques
Rogge was deeply disappointed in the Dutch, publicly scolding them
during a Thursday news conference, and by sundown Friday, the
Netherlands finally had its act together, handing the flag to a
female snowboarder, Nicolien Sauerbreij.</TE>
<TE>   Good thing they keep adding these new Olympic sports.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteerism, once an honorable tradition of the Olympic Games, is
taking a hit in Salt Lake. At least among the athletes and the
ex-athletes. You probably noticed the honor roll of American
champions who took part in the final leg of the torch relay--Dorothy
Hamill and Dick Button to Scott Hamilton and Peggy Fleming to Phil
Mahre and Bill Johnson to Dan Jansen and Bonnie Blair to Jim Shea and
his son Jimmy to Picabo Street and Cammi Granato to members of the
1980 "Miracle on Ice" hockey team, who were smart enough to arrive
with extra padding and insulation, all of it naturally acquired
during the past 22 years.</TE>
<TE>   You did not notice Eric Heiden, five-time gold medalist in 1980,
because he decided the opening ceremony of the first U.S. Winter
Olympics since Lake Placid was a good time to start behaving like an
NBA player. Salt Lake officials approached Heiden about participating
as "one of the last guys" to carry the torch.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them I wanted to be the last guy," Heiden told Sporting
News Radio. "They said they couldn't do that, and I said, 'Well, then
I have other things to do.' So I kind of turned them down."</TE>
<TE>   That's the Olympic spirit.</TE>
<TE>   Light the fire within.</TE>
<TE>   This was the Salt Lake opening ceremony in a nutshell: Eric Heiden
was a no-show, but Steve Young carried the flag for Great Britain.
That's right, that Steve Young, who used to carry the flag for the
San Francisco 49ers and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</TE>
<TE>   How does this happen? Why does this happen? More than $310 million
is spent on security, the federal government flies in hundreds of
special agents and a former NFL quarterback slips through to
commandeer the British flag?</TE>
<TE>   Well, he always was elusive scrambling out of the pocket.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, if you think about it awhile, and think about it some
more, it starts to make some sense. Young speaks English. He's a
distant descendant of Brigham Young. And the Brits, let's face, will
adopt anyone if they're agreeable to helping out Her Majesty's
Sporting Service a bit. Really now, who's more British at the
core--Steve Young or Greg Rusedski?</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to the greatest fears among the international media,
Friday's ceremony was not the anticipated orgy of American
hyper-patriotism. Oh, there were a few moments that straddled the
line.</TE>
<TE>   In the heartland of the country that gave the world baseball, in
the middle of the city that gives the Angels their triple-A prospects
and then gladly accepts them back, a guy named Mitt hung out with
Rogge and gave an inspirational speech.</TE>
<TE>   And the fans in the stands broke out "Tthe Wave," a very gauche
breach of Olympic etiquette. Although, in fairness, it must be noted:
French athletes allegedly started "The Wave"--the French, you know
how they are--and, well, it was c-c-c-o-l-d out there. Had to do
something to try to stay warm.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the proceedings were pleasantly restrained. When Rogge
got his turn to give his speech, he referred to U.S. and Salt Lake
organizers as "our wonderful American hosts" and not "spittle of
toad," which was quite unexpected but generous of him.</TE>
<TE>   And a lengthy and intricate salute to Utah pioneers skirted the
more controversial aspects of the Donner Party story. Evidently, it's
very difficult to choreograph cannibalism in 19-degree weather on
ice.</TE>
<TE>   Final security breach of the night: Figure skater Sasha Cohen, the
pride of Laguna Niguel, smuggling a mobile phone into the stadium,
placing a call to her parents and shoving the handset in the face of
the man standing next to her: President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "Hi. I'm the president," Bush told the Cohens.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to Utah, folks. These Games, you have to suspect, they're
going to be different.</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Smart enough to skate around scandal, tough enough to stare down
terrorism, the 2002 Winter Olympics opened Friday with enough magic
to re-create a miracle.</LD>
<LD>   Remembering America's worst nightmare, the opening ceremony began
with the somber tatters of a World Trade Center flag.</LD>
<LD>   Realizing America's brightest hopes, it ended with the wondrous
triumph of the 1980 "Miracle on Ice" hockey team.</LD>
<TE>   It was biting in its chill.</TE>
<TE>   It was embracing in its warmth.</TE>
<TE>   It was precisely the roaring spectacle required by an uncertain
country venturing to play host to the world's biggest sporting event
while waging a war.</TE>
<TE>   While snipers stood watch, human icicles skated.</TE>
<TE>   While helicopters buzzed overhead, 52,000 spectators dressed in
paper ponchos that turned them into human snowflakes. Beneath the
shadows of the rolling, snow-covered Wasatch Mountains, the sky
danced with occasional flurries and relentless optimism.</TE>
<TE>   The theme of these Games, as printed directly on the Olympic
torch, is "Light the Fire Within."</TE>
<TE>   And so the opening ceremony did, sometimes loudly, other times
somberly, but always appropriately for a nation that now, more than
ever, needs to think big.</TE>
<TE>   How perfect that the final flame was lighted by the craziest
dreamers of all.</TE>
<TE>   After two hours of ceremony involving everyone from settlers to
Native Americans to skating coyotes, current Olympic stars Picabo
Street and Cammi Granato carried the torch up the steps toward the
caldron atop Rice-Eccles Olympic Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Once there, they were met by Mike Eruzione, the star of the most
famous underdog champions in U.S. sports history.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing his hockey sweater, he stood alone with the flame for
several seconds before turning to the caldron with a devilish grin
and summoning, from the darkened wings, his teammates from that 1980
U.S. gold-medal winning hockey team.</TE>
<TE>   Together, all in uniform, all huddled and touching the torch, they
leaned over and lighted the 117-foot caldron and millions of
imaginations.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-two years ago, their shocking semifinal victory over the
Soviet Union in Lake Placid, N.Y., caused Americans everywhere to
steer their cars to the side of the road and honk their horns.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, it caused them to gasp.</TE>
<TE>   Then, as now, a miracle on ice.</TE>
<TE>   "The final journey,'' Eruzione said.</TE>
<TE>   It is now the obligation of the Games to live up to the standard
set by his team that, as a bunch of college kids in 1980, began the
Olympics with seemingly no chance of a medal.</TE>
<TE>   The favorites were the professional Soviets. They had earlier
defeated the NHL All-Stars and then, in a pre-Olympic exhibition,
dominated the American kids in a 10-3 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, led by the emotional Eruzione and goalie Jim Craig, the
Americans scored two third-period goals for a 4-3 victory over the
Soviets in the semifinals, then defeated Finland with another
third-period comeback in the championship game.</TE>
<TE>   "It was much more than a hockey game," Craig said. "It was all
that Americans believe in."</TE>
<TE>   The torch earlier had entered the stadium in the hands of other
tiny, simpler miracles.</TE>
<TE>   Just down the road, it had been carried by Andrea Mead Lawrence,
69, a Mammoth Lakes resident and former slalom gold-medal winner who
last carried the torch in Squaw Valley in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, she skied the torch into the stadium while pregnant
with daughter Quentin.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, she handed the torch to Quentin, 42.</TE>
<TE>   "This is about the spark that keeps the human spirit alive,'' she
said tearfully.</TE>
<TE>   Such was the story that Friday splendidly conveyed, from the
opening entrance of the tattered World Trade Center flag to the
closing fire on ice.</TE>
<TE>   There was only thing hotter than watching five flaming Olympic
rings on a skating rink.</TE>
<TE>   It was witnessing our wartime president marching unescorted into a
spotlight, then climbing into the stands to hang with the athletes.</TE>
<TE>   We may never remember the exact words of any of President Bush's
speeches, but who will forget how he casually took a cell phone
offered from skater Sasha Cohen and spoke to the person on the other
end.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah. President Bush. Right. Gimme back to Sasha, will ya? You're
wasting minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The President arrived at the start of the ceremony, just before
the controversial carrying of the tattered flag into the stadium by
New York City police and firefighters and several athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Olympic officials initially balked at the idea, emphasizing that
they operate a world event with no national bias, noting they have
never before agreed to honor the tragedies of a single nation.</TE>
<TE>   Yet after some negotiation, they agreed that the Sept. 11 tragedy
was not about a single nation, but the world.</TE>
<TE>   So the part of the world that gathered here Friday fell silent as
the tattered flag billowed in the hands of the rescue workers.</TE>
<TE>   The silence then became reverence at the singing of the national
anthem by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, a rendition so rousing they
repeated the refrain twice.</TE>
<TE>   The reverence then became wild cheering as a bright new American
flag was raised and spotlighted at the same time that darkness
covered the tattered version.</TE>
<TE>   That cheering reached its peak toward the end of the evening when
International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge, as part of
his welcoming address, said, "We stand united with you ... "</TE>
<TE>   The rest of that sentence was lost in the roar.</TE>
<TE>   It was enough to make a young boy holding a lantern giggle.</TE>
<TE>   Symbolic of the Games' theme--light the fire within--the red-clad
child had earlier led the parade of 77 nations and 2,531 athletes
into a stadium where, not surprisingly, none were ridiculed and all
were welcomed.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody booed skier Bagher Kalhor, the flag-bearer from Iran, one
of the countries cited in President Bush's "axis of evil.''</TE>
<TE>   Nobody jeered Patrick Singleton, the luge slider and flag-bearer
for Bermuda braving 10-degree temperatures in red Bermuda shorts.</TE>
<TE>   When the Americans entered last, the cheers were loud enough to
drown out weeks of criticism for what is expected to be our
overbearing patriotism.</TE>
<TE>   While we cheered, the athletes cheered and waved back under their
blue berets, even the stoic Michelle Kwan, openly delighted to
participate in this parade after skipping the ceremonies in 1998 at
Nagano, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   And while the athletes cheered, a television camera showed troops
in Afghanistan pointing to the flags on their uniforms and chanting,
"USA, USA."</TE>
<TE>   If they can do it, so can we.</TE>
<TE>   If a bunch of college kids can skate through the thickest of
flames to carry one, so can we.</TE>
<TE>   Such was the message on a night when America walked bravely into
17 days of what it is convinced-- what it must be convinced--will be
a winter wonderland.</TE>

<LD>Remember all those warnings from Salt Lake City organizers about
bringing your warmest clothes?</LD>
<LD>   Apparently, the word didn't get to the Dutch Olympic team, whose
best athletes refused to carry their flag during Friday's opening
ceremony for reasons you won't believe.</LD>
<LD>   It's too cold.</LD>
<TE>   Only eight of the 30 members of the team even agreed to march in
what were expected to be 20-degree temperatures.</TE>
<TE>   By process of elimination, the flag bearer was rookie snowboarder
Nicolien Saurbreij, who has never finished higher than 15th in any
major event.</TE>
<TE>   It was either her, or an embarrassed Dutch Olympic official,
because nobody else on the team wanted to do it.</TE>
<TE>   Two-time gold medalist Gianni Romme would have been the obvious
choice to carry the flag, especially because he does not compete
until the 10,000-meter speedskating event Feb. 22.</TE>
<TE>   Yet he told reporters he didn't want to get cold.</TE>
<TE>   At a Winter Olympics?</TE>
<TE>   "That is sad,'' said Jacques Rogge, IOC president.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Plaschke</TE>

<TE>   What's in a Name?</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest questions leading into Monday's scheduled
Olympic women's downhill is what Picabo Street will name her skis.</TE>
<TE>   OK, maybe not.</TE>
<TE>   It is true, though, that the two-time Olympic medalist does have
pet names for her skis.</TE>
<TE>   "My 'Arnold's' are a definite contender," Street said this week.</TE>
<TE>   Also under consideration are her "Jomos," "Chachos," "Ernsts" and
"Uncle Leos."</TE>
<TE>   Street said her "Jomos" are named for her brother's dog, who was
run over by a car just before Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hoping that he's fast because I'd love to have him take me
down the mountain," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Street won't make a final ski decision until after this weekend's
training runs on the Olympic course named "Wildflower."</TE>
<TE>   Street and her ski technician will choose a pair of skis that best
suits snow conditions.</TE>
<TE>   You think this selection process is superstitious hogwash?</TE>
<TE>   In fact, picking the right skis can be the difference in winning
or losing a gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   At the 1998 Nagano Games, Street won the gold medal in super-giant
slalom, not her best event, by making a tactical and somewhat
sentimental decision to ski the race on her "Olys," the longer
downhill boards on which she won the silver medal at Lillehammer.</TE>
<TE>   Street gauged correctly the course was designed more like a
downhill than a super-G and won the gold by one-hundredth of a
second.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Nervous Groom</TE>
<TE>   Jonna Mendes earned the "Honest Olympic Moment" award this week
when she faced reporters at a U.S. Alpine team news conference.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm nervous," she said. "My heart is racing like you wouldn't
believe. A lot of people say we should treat it like any other race.
It's a lot easier said than done."</TE>
<TE>   Mendes, 22, isn't expected to contend for a medal, but she found
out how much the Olympics mean when she recently returned home to
Heavenly Valley, Calif., and was stunned that workers at her local
ski resort had groomed a run for her so that she could train.</TE>
<TE>   "They spent the whole night grooming the entire thing for me,"
Mendes said, "and I got to just take fast runs down it all morning.
They closed the whole thing off for me. The Olympics aren't just
another race."</TE>

<TE>   That's Not My Bag</TE>
<TE>   The Italian contingent that arrived in Salt Lake City this week
had seven pieces of luggage lost, including pair skater Ruben De
Pra's suitcase that contained his skates and a practice costume.</TE>
<TE>   De Pra had replacement skates sent to Utah, but he had to miss two
days of practice before they arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the luggage mix-up, Italian National Organizing
Committee Secretary General Raffelle Pagnozzi said this is the best
organized of the five Olympics he has attended.</TE>
<TE>   His only other complaint: not enough variety of food.</TE>
<TE>   J.A. Adande</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Camping or Cheating?</TE>
<TE>   U.S. cross-country skier Justin Wadsworth, an outspoken foe of
doping, wasn't sure if sleeping in a tent that simulates high
altitude constituted cheating. "I had to do some soul searching," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But in the end, he decided it wasn't unethical and became one of a
couple of skiers who use the device.</TE>
<TE>   "I sleep at 13,000 feet and then I ski at Mount Bachelor and it
feels like I'm at sea level," he said. "It's incredible.... There's
definitely a physiological change."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's the Coolest</TE>
<TE>   U.S. moguls skier Shannon Bahrke resisted friends' suggestions
last summer that she look at the Olympic course at Deer Valley
resort, which seats more than 13,000 spectators.</TE>
<TE>   "I was like, 'No, I don't want to. It'll make me nervous,'" she
said. "When we first came up for the Gold Cup [competition] I almost
crashed my car. It was like, 'Oh my gosh. That's the bottom of my
course.'</TE>
<TE>   "But I think it's awesome. It's amazing. To have this kind of
venue at the bottom of your mogul course is something you dream
about, so it's pretty cool."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   That's Not Normal</TE>
<TE>   Short-track speedskater Rusty Smith of Sunset Beach, on the U.S.
team's new skin-tight slick racing uniforms:</TE>
<TE>   "They're supposed to be really fast and we're all really excited
to race in them for the first time. They aren't real comfortable,
either. They were probably designed for normal people and normal
people don't look like us."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Kupper</TE>

<TE>   Gun Control</TE>
<TE>   The guns and ammunition that will be used by biathlon competitors
will be stored at the Soldier Hollow venue during the Games. However,
rifles can be taken outside the venue, in contrast to the rules in
effect at Nagano in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Teams were asked to bring ammunition in one load to Soldier Hollow
by today; the anticipated total is 210 rifles and several hundred
thousand rounds of ammunition.</TE>
<TE>   All vehicles entering the venue are thoroughly screened. Equipment
used by biathletes was stored in separate containers so in case
someone hijacked a van of athletes, rifles and ammunition wouldn't be
together.</TE>
<TE>   "We trust the athletes. We just don't want it to fall into the
wrong hands," said Scott Blackburn, public safety venue commander.</TE>

<TE>   Navel Exercises</TE>
<TE>   A little reminder of Los Angeles will accompany Polish snowboarder
Jagna Marczulajtis on her way down the mountain. Marczulajtis, who
competes in the parallel giant slalom event, had her belly button
pierced at Venice Beach when she visited Los Angeles.</TE>

<TE>   Pins Aren't Dropping</TE>
<TE>   The unofficial currency of the Winter Games is pins: food pins,
sponsor pins, sports pins. Even the FBI has pins.</TE>
<TE>   Want something copied for free? Give the clerk a pin. Need a cab
driver to wait while you dash to the ATM? That'll cost you two pins.
Don't have a pin to trade? Welcome to the loser's club.</TE>
<TE>   An urban legend has it that 17 million pins were traded at the
1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles, and that's before bartering really
got hot.</TE>
<TE>   Pin traders are everywhere around Salt Lake City. Some specialize.
Others aren't picky.</TE>
<TE>   For Harvey Davids, it all started in 1988 in his Calgary
collectibles shop. Someone covering the Winter Games gave him an ABC
network pin.</TE>
<TE>   "I somehow got hooked," he says. "It's every parent's nightmare.
The circus comes to town and the kid runs away. The Olympics came to
town and I haven't missed one since."</TE>
<TE>   The Salt Lake Organizing Committee has authorized about 600 retail
pins, but there are hundreds of nonprofit organizations that have
permission to produce pins for fund-raisers.</TE>
<TE>   On top of those are the hundreds of unofficial Olympic pins that
poke gentle fun at Utah and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints.</TE>

<TE>   No, It's the Other One</TE>
<TE>   When you first hear John Paul Jones' name mentioned at the Winter
Games, you wonder what one of America's greatest naval heroes is
doing at 11,000 feet.</TE>
<TE>   But this Jones was Army, and he too is a hero worthy of note.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of skiers each year ride a high-speed lift to a ridge to
get to a trail that all bear his name at the Snowbasin resort, site
of the downhill and Super-G races.</TE>
<TE>   When World War II broke out, his expert skiing drew the attention
of the Army, and he was recruited to serve in the elite 10th Mountain
Division, the first ski troopers.</TE>
<TE>   The Ogden, Utah, native trained as a medic and shipped out.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 20, 1944, Jones was killed during the battle for Mount
Belvedere in Italy.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, his friends returned home and named the prominent
mountain edge "John Paul Ridge" and it stuck.</TE>

<TE>   Hail to the Phone</TE>
<TE>   Sasha Cohen, the figure skater from Laguna Niguel, gave her mother
a surprise during the opening ceremony Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   Talking on her cell phone to her mother while standing amid the
U.S. athletes' delegation near the end of the ceremony, Cohen
suddenly handed the phone over to the man mingling in the crowd and
asked him to speak.</TE>
<TE>   "Hi," the man said, obligingly. "I'm the president."</TE>
<TE>   There was no record Friday night of how Cohen's mother, Galina,
responded to George W. Bush.</TE>

<LD>Bob Costas may be accused of gushing at times, but if there was ever
a time for gushing, this was it.</LD>
<LD>   The Winter Olympics' opening ceremony Friday night was spectacular
and so was NBC's coverage.</LD>
<LD>   It started off with Jim McKay's voice and ended not long after
members of the 1980 Olympic hockey team ignited the caldron. In
between, came the emotion, the color, the fashions and the spirit of
the Olympics. And NBC captured it all.</LD>
<TE>   Costas set the tone about an hour-and-a-half after NBC went on the
air and moments before the official start of the opening ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "You couldn't stage a scene more perfect than this ... light snow
and fireworks overhead," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It was a night of near perfection, and NBC was at its technical
and artistic best, even if there were a few audio problems right at
the end.</TE>
<TE>   Costas and Katie Couric, NBC's co-hosts for the opening ceremony,
were almost flawless in their presentation.</TE>
<TE>   About the only thing Costas said that might have been irritating,
at least to West Coast viewers, came early in the parade of nations,
when Australia entered Salt Lake City's Rice-Eccles Olympic Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been waiting a year-and-a-half to say this, it's Australian
and we're live," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He was referring to the fact that the Summer Olympics at Sydney,
Australia, in the fall of 2000, were shown by NBC on tape.</TE>
<TE>   Much of NBC's prime-time coverage from Utah over the next 16 days
will be live, but not here in the Pacific time zone.</TE>
<TE>   So when Costas and any of the other NBC announcers talk about live
TV, they're ignoring all of us that live west of the Rocky Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   It's an insult you'd better get used to. On most nights, as was
the case Friday night, NBC's coverage will be 2 1/2 hours old by the
time it reaches your living room, and NBC will barely be
acknowledging that.</TE>
<TE>   It was fitting that the first voice we heard when NBC went on the
air was that of McKay, the voice many Americans associate with the
Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   McKay, at the end of his part in the opening, said: "Sixteen
months after the Olympic flame was extinguished an ocean away and a
long time ago, it is about to be rekindled in a country thrust
without warning to the center of history."</TE>
<TE>   McKay, 80, came on live after the opening, and he appeared
uncomfortable. The words don't come as easily now. "You got me
stuttering," he told Couric at one point.</TE>
<TE>   This was the first Olympics McKay has worked since the 1988 Winter
Games at Calgary. So, sure, he was rusty. But by the end of the
telecast, he'd nearly found his old groove.</TE>
<TE>   As severely injured skier Bill Johnson helped skier Phil Mahre
carry the Olympic torch, McKay said, "This man walking in the stadium
is a miracle."</TE>
<TE>   This was the 12th Olympics McKay has worked as an announcer, and
it was comforting having him there, bringing back memories.</TE>
<TE>   It was a great night all the way around. Even the commercials
didn't seem intrusive.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the telecast, Couric apologized for the number of
"pauses," explaining most of the commercial breaks were coming at
this point so there would be fewer later on. A highlight of the early
part of NBC's coverage was Costas' interview with President Bush, who
once again showed a strong knowledge of sports.</TE>
<TE>   When Costas asked Bush to name his fondest Olympic memory or
athlete, Bush singled out Bobby Morrow, a fellow west Texan.</TE>
<TE>   Most viewers probably wondered who he was talking about. Costas
noted that Morrow was a sprinter, but left out that Morrow, from
Abilene Christian, won the 100 and 200 meters at the 1956 Summer
Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is also a dedicated runner. He said he runs an hour a day and
can cover three miles in 21 minutes. A seven-minute mile pace is very
good for a 55-year-old man.</TE>
<TE>   Bush became the first U.S. president to open an Olympic Games.
Usually, it has been a vice president.</TE>
<TE>   It was fitting that Bush opened the Games while standing among
U.S. athletes. Figure skater Sasha Cohen handed him a cell phone to
talk with her mother.</TE>
<TE>   "How great is that," Costas said.</TE>
<TE>   On this night, the word "great" was not gushing.</TE>
<TE>   From Brigham Young alum and Olympic volunteer Steve Young carrying
Great Britain's name placard to athletes from other nations waving
tiny American flags to U.S. troops in Kandahar, Afghanistan, it was a
great night.</TE>
<TE>   NBC brought us all the red, white and blue, and if that's
jingoism, or whatever you call it, so be it.</TE>

<HD>Ski Jump Event Postponed</HD>
<DH>Weather: Winds delay 90-meter jump until Sunday; downhill
ski training runs canceled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEW FREEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TRIBUNE OLYMPIC BUREAU</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>The highly anticipated first event of the Winter Olympics was reduced
to an anticlimax when officials shut down the 90-meter ski jump
competition before it began because of too much winter.</LD>
<LD>   They didn't want a jumper sailing into the crowd in 50-mph winds.</LD>
<LD>   Although the description sounds more like a parody of the event,
fear of just such an occurrence kept the 60 jumpers grounded Friday
morning at Utah Olympic Park. The scheduled qualification for the
90-meter event was bumped to Sunday and will be held before the
final.</LD>
<TE>   Could someone truly be blown so far off course?</TE>
<TE>   "If he was jumping," Alan Johnson, the ski jump manager, said
without a hint of a smile.</TE>
<TE>   The event was expected to garner extra attention because it was
the first competition of the Salt Lake City Games and the only
competition scheduled on the day of the opening ceremony. Men's and
women's downhill ski training at Snowbasin Ski Area also was called
off because of heavy winds and snow.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said three weather stations on the Olympic Park course
measured wind velocity at 50-plus mph. An acceptable breeze for ski
jumping--if it's steady--is perhaps 15 mph, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Blizzardlike, whiteout conditions greeted athletes, race officials
and the 13,582 ticket-holders (who will be offered full refunds from
the Salt Lake Olympic Committee) hours before the scheduled 9 a.m.
MST start, resulting in two postponements before the cancellation.</TE>
<TE>   "We were a determined lot today," said Colin Hilton, Utah Olympic
Park general manager. "We were really hoping to get this off."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who has supervised the site since it opened in 1993, said
this is only the second time in nine years that the winds reached
such a high velocity. By the time the competition was put off, the
sun broke through, but Johnson said neither the snow itself, nor
visibility, were really factors--only wind.</TE>
<TE>   "We can jump at anything up to an inch-and-a-half an hour,"
Johnson said of snowfall rate.</TE>
<TE>   The qualification round was designed to trim 10 competitors from
the final and compete a mandatory round of jumping before the final.
That is why the jumping had to be added to Sunday's program. Athletes
were disappointed, but said holding an event in such poor conditions
would have resulted in an unfair competition.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little bummed out about it," U.S. jumper Brendan Doran of
Steamboat Springs, Colo., said. "But it happens that way, and we
certainly can't control the weather."</TE>
<TE>   Alan Alborn of Anchorage, the top U.S. jumper, called "weather
like this near impossible to jump in."</TE>
<TE>   At Snowbasin, the men's downhill is scheduled to be run Sunday
while the women are set to race Monday, weather permitting.</TE>
<TE>   The good news at Snowbasin was that clouds cleared by late
afternoon and better weather has been forecast for the next few days.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean there won't be Alpine postponements. Snowbasin
averages 55 inches of snowfall in February, and history has shown the
weather tends to get worse as the month goes on.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a weekend of World Cup racing on the Olympic downhill
course was wiped out by weather.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the weather, the world's best male downhill racers have
made only three training runs on the Olympic course--two last year
and one on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the top women had a chance to test the course in
competition last year in a Nor-Am race that was won by Picabo Street.</TE>
<TE>   The men and women have training runs scheduled today. It would be
the second for the men and the first for the women.</TE>

<HD>Bogataj Fell Into Fame</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It is the enduring image of ABC's "Wide World of Sports."</LD>
<LD>   Vinko Bogataj, a 22-year-old from Yugoslavia, hurtles off the ski
jump at the 1970 International Ski Flying Championships in
Obertsdorf, West Germany, over the bales of hay that were supposed to
provide a soft landing, tumbles head over skis and lands with a thud.
It was part of the opening montage of the popular television show,
and it was always accompanied by an announcer's deep voice saying,
"and the agony of defeat."</LD>
<LD>   Jim McKay, who is working for NBC at the 2002 Winter Olympics, has
always said that the most-asked question of him is: What ever
happened to the hapless skier?</LD>
<TE>   Bogataj is alive and well and living in Lesce, Slovenia. He is the
father of two daughters, Monica and Sandra, and the husband of
Lilijana. After working in a foundry for much of his life, Bogataj,
who turns 54 next month, owns a truck and drives around Slovenia,
Croatia, Germany and Austria delivering manufacturing equipment.</TE>
<TE>   He also paints oil and water-color landscapes that are good enough
to be sold around town.</TE>
<TE>   This information comes courtesy of his oldest daughter, Monica,
28, who is a veterinarian technician and who answered the phone at
the Bogataj home.</TE>
<TE>   Her father, she said, was driving his truck. But since he doesn't
speak English so well, Monica was happy to tell of her father's life
and fame.</TE>
<TE>   "He is not so famous in Slovenia," Monica said, "but in America it
is a completely different story. He was, three times, in America. The
first time came when ABC brought our family to New York and for the
first time my father found out that he was famous. He did not believe
it, I don't think."</TE>
<TE>   Monica traveled around the U.S. for six weeks in 1998 and found
that wherever she was, whoever she was with, if someone found out she
was the daughter of the "Agony of Defeat" guy, "they all wanted to
talk to me. They want to know if my dad was hurt and if he still
skis."</TE>
<TE>   Her dad was hurt, bumps and bruises mostly and a pain in his
ankle, Monica says. And he still does some ski jumping, "mostly for
fun," Monica said.</TE>
<TE>   Vinko began ski jumping as a small boy. "My dad built his own ski
jump behind the house, all by himself. Then he started going to the
local ski jumping club.</TE>
<TE>   "When I look at the video of his fall, it is kind of amazing and
when we came to the U.S. for the first time, none of us could believe
how everybody wanted to meet my dad. All from that one fall. Here at
home, hardly anybody knows about it. Here my dad is just a truck
driver."</TE>

<HD>Nigeria Missing in News Action</HD>
<DH>Disaster in Lagos barely is given a mention on TV.
Networks' coverage of foreign events is becoming more meager, and
money is not the excuse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VERNE GAY</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometime on Jan. 27, a huge explosion ripped through the Ikeja
Military Cantonment in Lagos, Nigeria, sending flames and debris over
a vast area, killing between 600 people (the official count) and
2,000 (the unofficial one). Many of the dead were children.</LD>
<LD>   This was the worst human disaster since Sept. 11. But viewers who
rely solely on the evening news broadcasts of ABC, CBS and NBC may be
learning about it right now for the first time.</LD>
<LD>   The catastrophe barely rated a mention on the "CBS Evening News"
and ABC's "World News Tonight." NBC's "Nightly News" gave the story
exactly ... nothing. (The story did receive a total of 11 mentions
across all the daily broadcasts of the three networks, according to a
LexisNexis search.)</LD>
<TE>   Compare this to the BBC, whose TV and radio newscasts together
produced 75 stories on the tragedy since Jan. 27, as well as the
resulting political turmoil and tribal warfare in Africa's most
populous nation and one of the world's leading oil suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   So, why did the networks screw up? Too busy covering Enron and the
war on terrorism to squeeze this story in? Hard to believe--stories
on weather got prominent play in late January.</TE>
<TE>   What about that old charge that the networks don't care about
Africa (a charge leveled most recently on "Nightline," just before
airing a weeklong series on genocide in the Congo)? How then to
explain the "Nightline" series and Mark Phillips 12-part series on
Africa that CBS aired last summer?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the networks have run out of money covering Afghanistan, a
multimillion-dollar budget-buster. That's impossible to believe. Lack
of will--not lack of money--has long hindered the networks' coverage
of foreign news.</TE>
<TE>   So what gives? Maybe the hard truth is the most obvious. After a
decade of cutbacks, layoffs and bureau closings, the three major
networks are so ill-prepared to cover the globe they can't possibly
cover two major stories outside of the Mideast at once.</TE>
<TE>   Back in the glory days, that used to be like walking and chewing
gum at the same time. Now, it's more like brain surgery, and the
success rate is 50%, if that.</TE>
<TE>   The failure to cover the Nigerian tragedy "is a fair question and
I'd have to go back and look at that day's" budget, said Bill
Wheatley, NBC News vice president. "But it's a story that doubtlessly
required more than we all had. We don't have a bureau in Nigeria, but
we never have."</TE>
<TE>   He adds, "I don't ascribe any shortfall in that area to financial
issues."</TE>
<TE>   Nigeria isn't the only foreign oversight at the networks these
days. The wrenching recession in Japan barely gets a mention. China
is as much as forgotten. Local elections in Cambodia (the first since
the Vietnam War) don't merit even a nod.</TE>
<TE>   There are significant terrorist cells (and activities) in
Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and India. Again, nada (although the
Philippines is getting some attention). The networks also are pulling
reporters and producers out of Afghanistan to plug holes in Somalia,
Iran and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, figures from the Tyndall Report, which tabulates
nightly news coverage, show that foreign coverage on the three
flagship broadcasts fell nearly 50 minutes from December to January.
Much of that decline can be attributed to Enron coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be that even if [a] story might never appear on U.S.
TV, crews had to gather footage just in case someone might suddenly
want it," says John Simpson, world affairs editor for BBC News and an
Afghanistan specialist who has traveled to that country dozens of
times over the years. "Now, it's a rarity and a curiosity to find an
American TV crew anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   There's also some evidence that cable's appetite for foreign news
has cooled, too, particularly at CNN, where current
flavors-of-the-month are "personalities." MSNBC and FNC aired
syndicated footage of the Nigerian disaster, while CNN aired four
short reports by correspondent Jeff Koinange.</TE>
<TE>   But what's key here is that only about 21/2 million viewers (on
average) watch the prime-time telecasts of the three major cable
networks. About 30 million viewers watch the Big Three evening
newscasts, which continue to be the country's dominant news venue.</TE>
<TE>   Over the past decade, much of network TV's interest in foreign
news seemed predicated almost entirely on its relevance to you and
me.</TE>
<TE>   But Sept. 11 exposed this as fallacy. Reason: The TV networks,
which gorged themselves on domestic stories such as Monica and O.J.
over the past decade, apparently forgot to ask which foreign hot
spots were in fact relevant. Afghanistan and Pakistan? As remote as
... Nigeria.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't agree with the premise that we weren't covering news"
about terrorists pre-Sept. 11, says Marcy McGinnis, senior vice
president of news coverage for CBS News. But "how do you explain the
mind-set of people who hate us [when] you have 22 minutes?" She adds,
CBS News is holding "conversations" about covering turmoil in
Nigeria.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Slavin, executive producer of ABC's "World News Tonight,"
says, "While we knew a lot of people had died [in Lagos], we had no
sense of the scope of it for several days." By then, "it was almost
as if the story had gotten beyond us [and] we had all these other
stories, foreign and domestic, going on."</TE>
<TE>   But after a decade of corporate malfeasance, in which network news
divisions were sliced and diced, are they now capable of adequately
covering the world in all its growing complexity? Says Slavin, "I'll
give you an answer that I wouldn't allow any of my reporters to take,
which is, only time will tell."</TE>

<HD>Life as a Muslim American Teenager</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Simplistic but effective, a special episode of the Noggin channel's
empathy-building children's series, "A Walk in Your Shoes," gives
viewers a glimpse into the post-Sept. 11 life of a Muslim American
teenager through the eyes of a Protestant teen.</LD>
<LD>   In the 30-minute show, which will be simulcast on Noggin and
Nickelodeon at 8:30 p.m. Sunday, the cameras are running as Nancy, a
15-year-old Protestant from a Boston suburb, spends two days with
13-year-old Mariam, a Muslim teenager in New Jersey, during the
,Islamic holy month, Ramadan.</LD>
<LD>   Nancy is apprehensive before the adventure begins, referring to
media images and rhetoric that seem to equate all Muslims with
terrorism and hate. Mariam wants Nancy to know that she's not so
different from any other teenager, and that she and her family are
proud to be Americans.</LD>
<TE>   Nancy attends Mariam's school for a day, where the curriculum and
gossip are familiar, even if the clothing isn't. She's a bit nervous
wearing the traditional hijab to cover her hair, but is surprised to
find that she's not uncomfortable praying at a mosque and at home
with Mariam's family.</TE>
<TE>   She and Mariam are also soon giggling together and ice-skating,
Web-surfing and exchanging fashion opinions at the mall.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy is interested in the tenets of modesty that govern Muslim
women's dress, and surprised that Islam preaches peace and kindness
to others and that Allah is another name for God.</TE>
<TE>   Developed with the help of members of the organization Muslims
Against Terrorism, the program doesn't dig deep, but it does get its
anti-stereotyping, anti-demonizing message across with clarity and
integrity.</TE>

<LD>Seeing Red: "According to a leading romance expert, a woman should
avoid wearing red panties and underwear because it could make her
partner think of her as tense and may make him lose interest in
having sex with her. He said that when men see red, they think tense
and lose interest.... Have [guys] ever gotten a woman down to her
underwear and go, 'Look at those colors! I'm sorry, I'm outta here'?"
(Jay Leno)</LD>
<LD>   An Aggressive Streak: "They have these online personality tests.
One of them measures aggression. If you score 10, you are passive; 20
and you are mildly aggressive; 30 is aggressive. If you scored 40 or
higher, then you are somewhere between Mike Tyson and a hockey dad."
(Alex Kaseberg)</LD>
<LD>   Drawing the Line: "Prince Charles' son Prince Harry has admitted
to smoking marijuana. But he says he never sold any marijuana. Of
course not. That would mean that a member of the royal family
actually had a job. Never sold any--too much work." (Leno)</LD>

<HD>Politics Wields a Powerful Palette</HD>
<DH>Art* Charles II's 'Painted Ladies' convey a lust for power
that is centuries old. The portraits show us what spin looked like
during the Restoration.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE SCARPONI</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW HAVEN, Conn.</DL>
<LD>They were the pinup girls of centuries past: curly-haired courtesans,
dripping with pearls and swathed in silk, gazing at the world with
bedroom eyes.</LD>
<LD>   The women who helped give the Restoration period in English
history its reputation for debauchery and political intrigue are
depicted in portraits for a new exhibit at the Yale Center for
British Art.</LD>
<LD>   "Painted Ladies: Women at the Court of Charles II" features dozens
of portraits of the king's lovers and confidantes, his out-of-wedlock
children and his unfashionable Portuguese wife.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the portraits have never before been seen in the United
States and many could be viewed before the exhibit only in the
private homes of British aristocracy, including the family of
Princess Diana, said Julia Marciari Alexander, an acting curator of
the museum.</TE>
<TE>   The show, which previously was shown at the National Portrait
Gallery in London, opened Jan. 25 and runs after March 17.</TE>
<TE>   Charles II took the throne in 1660, following a brief period in
English history in which there was no monarch. Charles I had been
executed in 1649 after the English civil wars, and Oliver Cromwell
headed a commonwealth government that lasted until the restoration of
the throne.</TE>
<TE>   The new, fun-loving king immediately set about creating a court,
reestablishing the high society of his father's day, said Catherine
MacLeod, curator of 16th and 17th century collections at the National
Portrait Gallery in London.</TE>
<TE>   "The king appointed a principal painter to produce visual
propaganda that in a lot of ways summed up what his court was like
and how they wanted to be seen," MacLeod said.</TE>
<TE>   During this period, when royal marriages were made more for
political or economic reasons than for love, it was normal for the
king to have many mistresses and for the women to hold powerful
positions in the court. Supporters of the king sometimes displayed
portraits of his mistresses in their homes as a sign of loyalty,
MacLeod said.</TE>
<TE>   As the women sat for these portraits, they had much in common with
today's publicity seekers: Some of the women tried to control their
public images and send messages about themselves--not just to the
king and denizens of the court but to the public at large--through
the poses selected for their paintings.</TE>
<TE>   The queen of self-promotion in the exhibit is Barbara Villiers,
Duchess of Cleveland, who was Charles II's chief mistress for a
decade.</TE>
<TE>   The duchess, with her long nose, cascading dark hair and
heavy-lidded eyes, is depicted in various portraits as a shepherdess
festooned with garlands of sapphires, as St. Catherine leaning on a
sword and even with her infant son by the king in a pose usually
reserved for religious paintings of the Madonna and child.</TE>
<TE>   The image leads to the conclusion that Charles II himself must be
God, Alexander said.</TE>
<TE>   "She is not always naughty and not always nice. She is interested
in creating intriguing images of herself," Alexander said.</TE>
<TE>   The king's other principal mistress, Louise de Keroualle, Duchess
of Portsmouth, was less interested in self-promotion and more
interested in the art and fashion of her native France. The duchess,
who came to Charles II's court as a French spy, rejected the painting
style of Villiers' favorite, Peter Lely, in favor of French painter
Henri Gascor.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit also features a portrait of Nell Gwyn, who gained fame
as a comic stage actress and entered the lives of the aristocracy as
another of the king's mistresses.</TE>
<TE>   Among the shining silks, gleaming jewels and peaches-and-cream
bosoms of the king's lovers, portraits of one woman stands out:
Catherine of Braganza, the unlucky wife of the king.</TE>
<TE>   Catherine is depicted in the dark and unfashionable Portuguese
court dress, with her awkward hairstyle and mousy look.</TE>
<TE>   "She plays a low-key role in the court of Charles II,
unfortunately for her," MacLeod said.</TE>

<LD>With Valentine's Day just around the corner, CBS delivers an
engrossing two-part passion play beginning Sunday at 9 p.m. in which
love conquers all.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, with a title like "Guilty Hearts," you might suspect
that there's a seamier side to the story, and you'd be right--in
spades. The miniseries is scarcely an hour old before infidelity,
dark threats and then murder grab center stage, and it's a wild ride
to the finish (Part 2 airs Wednesday at 9 p.m.).</LD>
<LD>   The wickedly watchable miniseries is based on the true story of a
woman (Academy Award-winner Marcia Gay Harden as Jenny Moran) whose
growing dissatisfaction with her marriage leaves her vulnerable to
the charms of the town icon (Treat Williams as Dr. Stephen Carrow).</LD>
<TE>   The strong cast, which includes another Oscar-winner in Olympia
Dukakis, helps elevate the movie above its soap-opera sensibilities,
and the brisk pace directed by Marcus Cole negotiates jaw-dropping
twists and turns with aplomb, particularly in Part 1.</TE>
<TE>   A scene early on in which Moran and Carrow meet at a coffee shop,
ostensibly just to chat about their common interests, is particularly
well done. Using fade-cuts to denote the passage of time, the
innocent meeting ends up galvanizing the characters into a belief
that they are only cheating their spouses by remaining with them.</TE>
<TE>   With Moran's boorish husband (Gary Basaraba) and Carrow's chilly
wife (Jennifer Dale) representing the other halves of the equation,
it's even a move viewers might be pulling for. But then a bigger
picture starts to emerge.</TE>
<TE>   And when Carrow's wife, confronted with his plans for divorce,
replies, "I'm going to take you for everything you've built up all
these years," you know things are going to get messy.</TE>
<TE>   Happy Valentine's Day.</TE>

<LD>Washington Redskin owner Dan Snyder is introducing retro uniforms for
next season that bring "Florida State" to mind--the colors, the spear
and the feather on the helmet.</LD>
<LD>   And Snyder's new coach, former Florida Coach Steve Spurrier,
loathed the Seminoles while running the Gator program.</LD>
<LD>   The new old-Redskin look had Spurrier scrambling for an
explanation: "We're burgundy," he said. "That other school is not
burgundy."</LD>
<TE>   Whatever you say, Coach.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which Pacific 10 schools have won the women's NCAA
basketball championship?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Winter wonderland: Bob Kravitz in the Indianapolis Star: "Now, the
truth is, American journalists covering the Winter Olympics don't
know much of anything about the sports they'll be covering.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, the same thing can be said of our knowledge of
football, basketball, etc., but when it comes to luge, bobsled and
curling, we really don't know what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Transformation: Bill Lyon of the Philadelphia Inquirer writing on
the positive personality change of 76er star Allen Iverson: "In
barely a year he had gone from
almost-traded-to-the-Black-Hole-of-Calcutta Clippers to a captain and
the acknowledged leader of a scrappy little team that kept surviving
seventh [playoff] games."</TE>
<TE>   Black Hole? Staples Center is a luxurious "hole."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So you say: Two men who had bought the rights to the Web site
www.memphisgrizzlies.com for $35 have agreed to surrender the address
to the NBA team.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the deal, each will receive six bobblehead dolls of
Grizzlies' players. Club executive Mike Golub told the Memphis
Commercial Appeal: "They are worth whatever people are willing to pay
for them. They're priceless."</TE>
<TE>   Make up your mind.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   High finance: Washington Husky football Coach Rick Neuheisel is
critical of some Pacific 10 schools, which he didn't identify, for
going after players who made commitments to Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Neuheisel said the Huskies lost a player to a school that promised
him $40,000 in flight training as part of his education because he
wanted to become a pilot.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lonely: Pitchers and catchers report to spring training in eight
days. Comedy writer Alan Ray told the San Francisco Chronicle: "The
Montreal Expos have announced practices will be closed to the public.
They want to simulate a real game atmosphere."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1979, Moses Malone of the Houston
Rockets set an NBA record with 19 offensive rebounds against New
Orleans. He would improve on this record to 21 three years later.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: USC (1983, '84) and Stanford ('90 and '92). The
first NCAA Women's Final Four was in 1982. UCLA won the AIAW national
title (Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women) in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Miami Herald columnist Dave Barry, who is "somewhere
in Utah": "The intense security has already caused an unfortunate
incident involving the Olympic torch, which after being painstakingly
carried more than 10,000 miles from Athens, Greece, was extinguished
by suspicious security personnel who noticed that it was--and this is
a direct quote--'on fire.'"</TE>

<KH>DALE EARNHARDT / ONE YEAR LATER</KH>
<HD>No. 3 in Their Hearts</HD>
<DH>Reminders of Driver Are Everywhere at Daytona 500
Qualifying</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The ghost of Dale Earnhardt hangs over Daytona International Raceway
like a black shroud. With a big No. 3 on it.</LD>
<LD>   It has been nine days short of a year since the Intimidator
crashed and was killed in the last turn of the last lap of the
Daytona 500, but his image, his memory and his aura can be felt
everywhere inside the 2 1/2-mile track he loved, and everywhere else
in this Florida beach town that is home to NASCAR.</LD>
<LD>   The race for the 2002 Daytona 500 starts today with qualifying
time trials. The two fastest cars will start on the front row Feb.
17. All others will be qualifying for the Gatorade Twin 125s next
Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   However, in the vast infield, where the hard-core fans set up
housekeeping for SpeedWeeks, there is a sea of No. 3s seen on caps,
shirts, race jackets, flags, bumper stickers and even dirty
windshields with "3" scrawled across them.</TE>
<TE>   There is no No. 3 in the race.</TE>
<TE>   That was Earnhardt's number, and it is owned by Richard Childress,
who provided Earnhardt with race cars since 1981. He won six of his
seven championships in Chevrolets with that number.</TE>
<TE>   (He drove a No. 2 when he won his first championship for Rod
Osterlund in 1980.)</TE>
<TE>   Childress has said that as long as he owns No. 3 it will not
appear in a Winston Cup race. He selected No. 29 for the car's
replacement with Kevin Harvick the driver.</TE>
<TE>   However, an Earnhardt driving No. 3 will be there next week. Dale
Jr. will have that number in the Busch Grand National on Feb. 16. But
the car won't be black, the old Earnhardt color.</TE>
<TE>   Besides all the items with the big "3," a remarkable number of
fans also wear T-shirts, golf shirts and expensive race jackets with
Earnhardt's name.</TE>
<TE>   "You would think that after a year, the demand for Earnhardt stuff
would slacken off, but it still rates with our best sellers," said
Jerry Randolph, an infield vendor. "It and the No. 8 [Earnhardt Jr.]
and the 24 [four-time champion Jeff Gordon] are the ones the public
keeps buying."</TE>
<TE>   In a dramatic dedication Thursday in the rain, a nine-foot-high
statue of Earnhardt was unveiled in front of Daytona USA. His racing
gloves, made of cast silicone bronze, sit on a wall behind the
statue. Alongside the gloves is a penny, which represents the penny
given Earnhardt by a young fan for "luck" the day he won his only
Daytona 500 in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   A new foot bridge, crossing International Speedway Boulevard in
front of the speedway, was also named the Earnhardt Bridge.</TE>
<TE>   "I wonder when it will all end," Childress has said of the way the
Earnhardt adulation has continued. "Maybe I shouldn't wonder, though.
There are times when I'm in the garage and I look up and swear I see
that mustache and that grin of his coming around the corner. It's
almost eerie."</TE>
<TE>   The one who has been hit hardest by the impact is Dale Jr., the
27-year-old son whose charm comes from the fact that he has some of
his dad's rough edges, coupled with a modern, hip attitude toward
life. It has been wearing on him, though, being asked time and again,
"What would your father have said after you won the July race here?"
or "Do you think you would have won if your father had been in the
race?" or "What did your mother [stepmother Teresa] say to you after
you won the Pepsi 400?"</TE>
<TE>   In racing's first trip back to Daytona after Earnhardt's death,
the Pepsi 400 was won by Junior, with Daytona 500 winner Michael
Waltrip second.</TE>
<TE>   Questions like that, repeated over and over, can get awfully
wearing. So it was not much of a surprise when Dale Jr., asked what
he most looked forward to this month in Daytona, replied, "Going
home."</TE>
<TE>   It was obvious he was enjoying the shock impact his answer had. A
few seconds later, he displayed his modern-style Earnhardt grin and
continued:</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, I can't wait. A lot of people keep asking me about my
coming back here and the anniversary of my father's crash, but I feel
like I dealt with a lot of those emotions when I came back here last
July. I'm here to race, so let's throw the green flag.</TE>
<TE>   "I love this track and I love racing here. It has always meant a
lot to me and it means even more since last February. I know you've
heard me complain about how long the season is and how short the
off-season is, but I've had enough of laying around. I want to go out
and race."</TE>
<TE>   Young Earnhardt will get his chance Sunday when he will be one of
22 drivers in the Budweiser Shootout, a race for last year's pole
winners or previous winners of the Budweiser Shootout, once known as
the Busch Clash.</TE>
<TE>   "This is such a fun race, and I think it's cool that I'm in it for
the second time. The Bud guys tease me because once or twice I called
it the Busch Clash, but that was because I watched it so many times
that was its name when my dad won."</TE>
<TE>   Earnhardt won it six times. No one else has won more than twice.</TE>
<TE>   If you think you're seeing things when Dale Jr. appears on the
screen during the Winter Olympics at the wheel of a Zamboni, don't
check your glasses. It's him.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't Salt Lake City, it's the Greensboro Coliseum, which was
transformed into an Olympic hockey venue last month. Earnhardt Jr.
was scheduled to shoot an on-air promotional spot with himself as an
Olympic Zamboni driver.</TE>
<TE>   "They had a stunt double for me to do the driving, but as long as
I was there I told them I might as well drive," Junior said.</TE>
<TE>   In the skit, between hockey games, one rink manager says to
another, "I don't know how we're going to get this thing turned
around for this one." The other manager answers, "Don't worry about
it, I made a phone call."</TE>
<TE>   Whereupon, Earnhardt Jr. appears driving the Zamboni. As he pits
the machine, he tells the Salt Lake Olympic pit crew, "It's a little
bit loose in the corners."</TE>
<TE>   Today, it's back to business. Qualifying consists of two laps,
with the best time of the two setting the time.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmie Johnson, the rookie from El Cajon who drives a Chevrolet
owned by Jeff Gordon, continued to lead the speed charts after
practice Friday. An off-road racing product who has driven in only
three Winston Cup races, he had a lap of 185.033 mph.</TE>
<TE>   "Our game plan was to take every practice session as hard as we
could and see what happened," Johnson said. "Everybody is going to
show their hands a little more tomorrow, I think. Some of the guys
were stepping it up this afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "The way the team is set up, I'll be able to work side-by-side
with Jeff [Gordon] all year at every track. Any questions that I have
about the car or about the track, I'll get honest answers from Jeff
and [teammates] Terry Labonte and Jerry Nadeau. The resources speak
for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what the No. 24 has been able to do with all their
equipment and hopefully that's where the No. 48 team will end up
also. I've been pinching myself ever since I signed on [with Gordon
and Hendricks Motorsports] in September of 2000. So I've got welts
all over."</TE>
<TE>   Gordon, who is making his debut as a Cup car owner while
continuing to drive for Rick Hendrick Motorsports, was third fastest
at 184.505.</TE>
<TE>   Ricky Rudd, in a Ford, slipped between the two Chevrolets at
184.740.</TE>

<HD>Ishii Makes First Pitch</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: Japanese left-hander throws out some English
during his introductory news conference.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's one thing to practice English in the privacy of your bathroom,
as the Dodgers' newest pitcher, Japanese left-hander Kazuhisa Ishii,
sheepishly acknowledged doing the past few months.</LD>
<LD>   It's another to do it on a global stage, amid the glare of klieg
lights and the scrutiny of a multinational media throng during your
introductory news conference at Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   "Thank you for waiting," Ishii began Friday after donning a Dodger
cap and jersey No. 17. "My name is Kazuhisa Ishii. Please call me
Kazu. I finally made it here. I'm happy to come to the Dodgers ... um
... one moment ... my English speech is finished. Please, questions
in Japanese."</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers don't expect Ishii to fade like that on the mound.
That's why they paid the Yakult Swallows, Ishii's Japanese team,
$11.26 million for his negotiating rights and spent another $12.2
million to sign Ishii to a four-year deal that includes two option
years that could push the total package to $18.35 million.</TE>
<TE>   "What impressed me the most about him was the fact he's been part
of a very good club that has played in six [Japanese] World Series,"
Dodger General Manager Dan Evans said. "He's been in high-pressure
situations throughout his career, and he's excelled. We're trying to
win here, not rebuild.... We've heard he's a great competitor. There
is no questioning his ability in big-game situations."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii's fastball is average by major league standards--between
90-93 mph--but he has an excellent slider and curve and mixes in an
occasional split-fingered fastball. Though he doesn't change speeds
much, Ishii deceives batters with a variety of arm angles. Ishii had
a 78-46 career record and 3.38 earned-run average in 10 seasons for
Yakult, striking out 1,277 and walking 603 in 1,1841/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   But the performances that really sold the Dodgers on Ishii were an
eight-inning, one-hit, 12-strikeout shutout of the Osaka Kintetsu
Buffaloes in Game 1 of the Japan Series championship last season, and
a complete-game, three-hit shutout with 12 strikeouts in Game 1 of
the 1997 Japan Series against the Seibu Lions.</TE>
<TE>   "He could win 20 games here," said Dodger pitching coach Jim
Colborn, who, as a former Orix Blue Wave pitching coach and director
of Pacific Rim Scouting for the Seattle Mariners saw plenty of Ishii
in Japan. "We want him to find his own level without a lot of
pressure, but I'm sure he'll be a very solid pitcher who wins a lot
of important games."</TE>
<TE>   Evans and Manager Jim Tracy stressed the importance of tempering
expectations for Ishii, and the Dodgers hope fellow Japanese pitcher
Hideo Nomo, who signed a two-year contract with the Dodgers this
winter, will deflect some attention from the Japanese media, which
attaches rock-star status to Japanese players in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "He's coming to a new environment, a new team, a new city and a
new clubhouse," Evans said. "We can't put expectations on him in
terms of numbers. But if he's healthy, he will be a solid contributor
because he has four quality pitches. That translates well in any
stadium, in any country."</TE>
<TE>   Said Tracy: "Not only does he know how to pitch in a big game, he
knows how to win it."</TE>
<TE>   He talks a good game, too. In one news conference Friday, Ishii
probably showed more personality than Nomo has shown in seven years
in the U.S., proving that left-handers in Japan can seem as flaky as
those in America.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why he wanted to play for the Dodgers, Ishii said, "There is
good weather and good golf courses here ... because I am a
Californian."</TE>
<TE>   His favorite American food? "Double-cheeseburger."</TE>
<TE>   Were there any hitters in Japan comparable to San Francisco
slugger Barry Bonds? "Nobody compares to Barry Bonds in Japan," Ishii
said. "That's why I came to America."</TE>
<TE>   No elaboration was necessary. Ishii had accomplished all he could
in Japan, and it was time to test his skills against the best hitters
in the world. It is a challenge both he and the Dodgers look forward
to.</TE>
<TE>   An injury-ravaged 2001 Dodger rotation consisted entirely of
right-handers, but with Ishii, the Dodgers have seven starting
pitchers: Kevin Brown, Andy Ashby, Ishii, Nomo, Omar Daal, Eric Gagne
and Odalis Perez. Ishii, Daal and Perez are left-handed, and another
left-hander, Terry Mulholland, can start or relieve.</TE>
<TE>   That should help the Dodgers combat the National League West's top
left-handed hitters, such as Bonds, Arizona's Luis Gonzalez and
Colorado's Larry Walker and Todd Helton. Rotation depth also gives
Evans the option of trading a pitcher, most likely Daal or Gagne, for
a proven closer or a center fielder, and it provides insurance if
Brown or Ashby struggle to return from elbow surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "Our rotation is deeper now than it was at any time last year,"
Tracy said. "If we started the season tomorrow, I'd have seven guys
to choose from and three left-handers in a division where you'll find
the home addresses of some of the better hitters in baseball."</TE>
<TE>   Had Ishii and the Dodgers not come to terms by Friday night, the
Dodgers would have lost their rights to him. A major sticking point
was the no-trade provision. Ishii wanted a blanket no-trade clause
but only got that for 2002. After this season, he can select 10 teams
each year that he can't be traded to without his consent.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii received a $1.5-million signing bonus and salaries of
$500,000 this year, $2.2 million in 2003, $2.6 million in 2004 and
$3.2 million in 2005. Team options of $3.3 million in 2006 and $4
million in 2007 include $1.1-million buyouts. About $4.4 million of
the deal will be deferred. In addition, Ishii will receive a $25,000
housing allowance each year and 10 round-trip tickets a year between
Japan and the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers and Ishii were far apart in negotiations for several
weeks, but talks heated up after Ishii flew from Tokyo to Los Angeles
and agent Joe Urbon flew from New York to Los Angeles on Tuesday.
While Urbon hammered out details with Dodger assistant general
manager Kim Ng, Ishii played catch in a vacant field near Los Angeles
International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   "It probably wasn't the safest area," Urbon said, "but he got his
work in."</TE>
<TE>   Friday, Ishii played catch in Dodger Stadium before his news
conference, and the whole experience left him with goose bumps.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so excited my hands are shaking," Ishii said. "That's how
much I want to do well for this team."</TE>

<HD>Kings at a Loss After Blowing a 4-0 Lead</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Phoenix comes roaring back to tie the score, then
wins it on Savage's goal in overtime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>If the Kings fail to make the playoffs this spring, they might rue
their slow start to the season or perhaps a costly loss yet to come.</LD>
<LD>   But they'll almost certainly curse their February trip to the
desert.</LD>
<LD>   They flew out of Arizona late Friday night after squandering a 4-0
lead, wasting a hat trick by Ziggy Palffy and losing in overtime to
the Phoenix Coyotes, 6-5, in front of a sellout crowd of 16,210 at
the America West Arena.</LD>
<TE>   Brian Savage, who had started the Coyotes' improbable comeback
with a seemingly harmless goal late in the second period, scored the
winner 4 minutes 26 seconds into the five-minute overtime after the
Kings' Mathieu Schneider was sent to the penalty box for
cross-checking Daymond Langkow.</TE>
<TE>   The one point the Kings earned for taking the game into overtime
could come in handy in the tightly contested playoff race, but it
gave them little comfort after they had given up more than five goals
for the first time this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought they were dead in the water," King Coach Andy Murray
said of the Coyotes, "and we just gave it to them. They were
determined and started to play a little bit reckless and we didn't
play smart to take advantage of it. Their goals were goals that we
gave them. I thought we laid it on a platter for them....</TE>
<TE>   "This is one more point to add to our total, but certainly when
you're leading, 4-0, there's no consolation in only getting one
point."</TE>
<TE>   After Jason Allison had given the Kings a four-goal advantage with
8:25 to play in the second period, the Coyotes scored three goals in
less than 21/2 minutes to make the score 4-3, then scored two more in
the first 71/2 minutes of the third period.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't really get comfortable," the Kings' Kelly Buchberger
said, "but we didn't go and try to ... go right back at them. They
came out hard and generated a really aggressive effort and it just
steamrolled."</TE>
<TE>   Palffy tied the score with his third power-play goal of the
game--and the Kings' fourth--with 10:02 remaining in the third
period, giving the Slovak winger his first hat trick since Nov. 28,
2000, against the New York Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   But the Coyotes continued to pressure King goaltender Felix
Potvin, who was playing on consecutive nights for the first time this
season.</TE>
<TE>   Late in the overtime, with the Coyotes again on the attack,
Schneider leveled Langkow from behind in front of the net.</TE>
<TE>   Nine seconds later, Savage scored on a rebound.</TE>
<TE>   Schneider disputed the call but acknowledged the King collapse.</TE>
<TE>   "We know where we went wrong out there; it's not rocket science,"
he said. "As soon as we scored the fourth goal we kind of backed off
into a shell.</TE>
<TE>   "But you've got to give them a lot of credit, the way they came
back. They didn't hang their heads. They came out hard and got a
couple of quick ones and we were on our heels all of a sudden."</TE>
<TE>   The Coyotes, who had lost two consecutive games after winning five
of six, are one of several teams bunched with the Kings in the
Western Conference playoff race, but Murray said that didn't make the
game any more important.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think so," he said before the first of two games matching
the teams in the last six days before the Olympic break. "It's just a
matter of trying to get two points every night you play and getting
closer to the number that will get us in.</TE>
<TE>   "I take the mind-set that, I don't care how many points other
teams get. It's what we get ultimately [that matters most].</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing that matters is, we've got to get points. We're
not going to be in the playoffs where we are now."</TE>
<TE>   In a mild surprise, Murray went with Potvin after saying earlier
in the week that backup Jamie Storr would start Friday if Potvin
played Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "He gets paid to be our No. 1 guy," Murray said of Potvin, who has
started in all but one of the Kings' last 13 games.</TE>
<TE>   "We have all the confidence in the world in Jamie, but we feel
it's the right thing to do [playing Potvin]."</TE>

<LD>The Dodgers ended the past season with a need for a center fielder
who bats leadoff, correct? Today (Feb. 2) I read that the Chicago
White Sox signed free agent Kenny Lofton to a one-year deal for $1.25
million. Lofton is a six-time All-Star with a .302 lifetime average
who, as I recall, plays center, bats leadoff and steals bases. What's
wrong with this picture?</LD>
<LD>   I can only hope that the Dodger brass know something that I don't.
Is Kenny Lofton damaged goods or, I hope, is McKay Christensen going
to be so good that we didn't really need a leadoff center fielder
after all?</LD>

<LD>"Silver-Tipped" Stu Nahan [Viewpoint, Feb. 2] believes that hockey is
not regarded as a major league sport because the NHL uses minor
league referees. Wrong! Hockey and soccer as well are minor league
sports because they still use 19th-century rules in the 21st century,
specifically, the antiquated offside rule whereby a player cannot go
downfield ahead of the puck/ball. If the offside rule was eliminated,
there would be high-scoring, fast-paced games.</LD>
<LD>   Isn't it about time Larry Stewart wrote another column pumping up
Stu Nahan for a job? Gee, Stu must miss those free buffets for
reporters. Oink, oink.</LD>

<LD>I thought, when I saw the first Olympic hype on TV, that the Games
were going to turn into a huge orgy of American self-congratulation,
full of "God Bless America, we're the greatest," etc.</LD>
<LD>   When I read Wednesday's articles regarding our requests for
special treatment about using the oversized flag, I was embarrassed.
We seem to think that we are the only country that has ever had a
national tragedy. USOC President Sandra Baldwin asks that they
overlook "our innocence" when she should have said arrogance and
stupidity.</LD>
<LD>   I hope these Games can center more on all of the participating

<TE>   The 1980 U.S. hockey team deserves renewed praise for winning the
gold medal at Lake Placid, but you should not forget the equally
stunning upset gold medal performance of Team USA in the 1960
Olympics at Squaw Valley.</TE>
<TE>   While the 1980 team faced Finland in the title game, the 1960 team
had to defeat the vaunted Soviet team to win the gold medal. The
score of that game--USA 2, USSR 1--was left on the Blyth Arena
scoreboard for many years after the 1960 Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>   Let's give credit to the 1980 team, but the first "Miracle on Ice"
took place in 1960.</TE>

<LD>Perhaps it is appropriate that it was the Veterans Committee that
certified George Allen onto the final selection list of 15 names for
election to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Perhaps only those with
long exposure to the game in the NFL can appreciate what George Allen
meant to the league.</LD>
<LD>   Bill Walsh is praised for the assistants whom he assembled, and
rightly so, but George Allen was years ahead of Walsh, with Marv Levy
and Mike McCormack and Ted Marchibroda on his Redskin staff, as well
as his own predecessor in Washington, Bill Austin.</LD>
<LD>   Most of all, George Allen never grew up. He was Dennis the Menace
until the end, a little boy cutting corners when he traded the same
draft choice more than once, but exuding endless enthusiasm to
inspire those susceptible of being inspired, getting the last, best
effort out of fading stars, he and they alike determined to prove
that he had not paid too much to get them onto his roster. The Hall
of Fame is enhanced by George Allen.</LD>

minutes against USC? Can you really call a system where everybody
runs around in circles 25 feet from the basket and then puts up
desperation shots an offense? If not for Matt Barnes' and Billy
Knight's buzzer beaters, they would have lost. Or as Lavin said in a

<TE>   He has always pulled out the miracles in the most adverse
situations. Now, however, he may have truly lost this team. I would

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers' search for a new coach took another bizarre
turn Friday when the team abandoned plans to hire Baltimore Raven
defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis.</LD>
<LD>   Three weeks after being rejected by Bill Parcells, the sons of
Buccaneer owner Malcolm Glazer decided against hiring Lewis--a
stunning reversal that again leaves the team scrambling for a backup
plan.</LD>
<LD>   Lewis was told early Thursday that he was the choice to succeed
Tony Dungy, who was fired on Jan. 14.</LD>
<TE>   But the Glazers never approved General Manager Rich McKay's
recommendation and quashed the plan after meeting with Lewis for five
hours in Washington on Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no doubt that this is a setback for me and my family,"
Lewis said. "I'm disappointed. Emotionally, it's difficult. But I
will rebound in a hurry."</TE>

bogey on No. 17 and a quadruple bogey on the 18th.</TE>
<TE>   Watson birdied Nos. 10, 11 and 14 to reach five under, then aced
the 163-yard, par-three 16th with a six-iron and followed with a
25-foot birdie putt on No. 17.</TE>

Commissioner Tom Hansen said. Neuheisel said "a couple" of Pac-10
schools, which he didn't identify, recruited players who had made
commitments to Washington. He made references to recruiting ploys by
Oregon and UCLA.</TE>

posting 10% of his $1.2 million bail.</TE>
<TE>   Russell's lawyer, Anthony W. Gibbs, said there was no evidence of
any drugging and that the sex was consensual.</TE>

<HD>Pasadena Set for NFL Vote</HD>

<LD>The Pasadena City Council will vote Monday on a plan that could pave
the way for an NFL team to relocate to the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   The three-year plan, submitted by the Rose Bowl Operating
Committee, was approved this week by the city's Economic Development
and Technology Committee. It is expected to glide through the City
Council vote.</LD>
<LD>   "We believe there's a tremendous opportunity here," said Darryl
Dunn, general manager of the Rose Bowl. "We're trying to make plans
for the future and determine how the Rose Bowl is going to succeed in
the long term. The big void in the marketplace right now is the lack
of an NFL team."</LD>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl, which has played host to five Super Bowls, would
require extensive renovation to lure an NFL team. There are many
environmental, neighborhood and historical complications to making
such renovations.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Mayor James Hahn told The Times last weekend he
believes L.A. will have an NFL franchise within five years. Although
Hahn has supported the Coliseum as a prospective site for a team, he
now says he would be open to supporting other potential sites in L.A.</TE>

<HD>Woods Cuts It Close With 77</HD>
<DH>Golf: He needs a birdie on the 18th to make his 81st cut in
a row. Lewis and Jones are co-leaders at Torrey Pines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAMON HACK</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL>LA JOLLA</DL>
<LD>After rolling in a six-foot birdie putt on the 18th green that kept
him around for the weekend, Tiger Woods shot a glance to his caddie,
Steve Williams, and broke into a quick smile. Williams grabbed Woods'
putter, pretended to break it over his leg, and tossed it to the
ground in mock disgust.</LD>
<LD>   Somehow, they cheated the fates. Somehow, Woods survived his 81st
official cut in a row despite a round that had the gallery scattering
like pigeons as he fought to keep his ball on a straight line.</LD>
<LD>   Woods' five-over-par 77 Friday on the South Course at Torrey
Pines--his worst score in three years--opened the door for a gaggle
of old-timers and journeymen to find center stage at the Buick
Invitational.</LD>
<TE>   J.L. Lewis, 41, a bear of a man who lives in Horseshoe Bay, Texas,
and little-known Kent Jones, 35, of Albuquerque shot five-under 67s
on the South Course for totals of nine-under 135 and a one-shot lead
over Mark O'Meara (69), Jay Haas (68) and Rory Sabbatini (66).</TE>
<TE>   A week after making the cut at the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National
Pro-Am by only one shot, Woods needed another late push to post a
two-day, one-under 143 total, which is where the cut line fell.</TE>
<TE>   Woods dropped to even par for the tournament when he made a double
bogey on 17, leaving his chip shot in the rough, then failing to get
up and down. But he patched together a birdie on the 551-yard,
par-five finishing hole, laying up from the right rough and nestling
a sand wedge tight for a closing birdie.</TE>
<TE>   After signing his scorecard, Woods didn't speak to reporters, but
his playing partner and friend, John Cook, talked about Woods barely
keeping alive his streak of made cuts, which trails only Byron Nelson
(113), Jack Nicklaus (105) and Hale Irwin (86).</TE>
<TE>   "It just shows that the greatest can struggle at times, the
greatest that maybe we've ever seen," said Cook, who shot a one-under
71 to stand six shots off the lead. "That's what makes him. He has
bad weeks and he's still in contention and he's still trying to play
well. Even the greatest can have a run of bad luck sometimes."</TE>
<TE>   While Woods was posting his largest number since a six-over 78 at
the 1999 AT&amp;T, the tour's grayer set was making a case for itself.
O'Meara, 45, sometimes seen as an avuncular sidekick to Woods, is
trying to turn back the clock and find victory for the first time
since 1998, when he tore through two majors with a steady game and a
putting stroke that was the envy of the tour.</TE>
<TE>   Friday, he was at it again, swinging his sticks crisply, spinning
the clubs in his hands when he was through.</TE>
<TE>   "The only advantage I have is that I don't have a lot to lose,"
O'Meara said. "There's not a lot of pressure on me. If anything, my
career is tapering off and going the other direction. The game is
very humbling. It challenges a player's mind. It challenges a
player's physical well-being. I know I have to go out and play really
well on the weekend and hopefully, I can do that."</TE>
<TE>   O'Meara had a chance to share the lead going into today's third
round, but he missed a three-foot birdie putt on the ninth hole of
the North Course--his final hole of the day--when his attempt slid by
the right side.</TE>
<TE>   The miss bugged O'Meara, but he calmly tapped in for his par,
walked to the scorer's tent and started to prepare himself for a
weekend of navigating the beastly South Course, which continues to
body slam the field (it played four strokes harder than the North on
Friday).</TE>
<TE>   "Let's face it," O'Meara said. "There aren't a lot of 47-, 48- and
49-year-old guys that dominate the PGA Tour."</TE>

<LD>   Utah State (17-4, 9-3) at UC Irvine (17-6, 10-2), 7, Channel 56,
KUCI-FM (88.9)--There are still three weeks left in the regular
season but this game, at least for the Anteaters, could be a decisive
one in the conference title race. It is a rematch of Irvine's 67-66
buzzer-beating victory at Logan on Jan. 10. On Thursday, Irvine held
Idaho to the lowest point total of an opponent in the history of the
Bren Center. Sophomore center Adam Parada continued his strong Big
West play with a career-high 24 points. Utah State has remained among
the league's top teams behind the inside-outside combo of forward
Desmond Penigar and guard Tony Brown. The game is expected to be a
sellout.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Cal State Northridge (8-12, 7-4) at UC Santa Barbara (13-8, 7-5),
7, KCSN-FM (88.5)--As fast as the Matadors rose to first place in the
Big West, they have dropped to third with two road losses.
Northridge, which had been shooting better in recent weeks, shot only
37% from the field Thursday in a 77-65 loss to Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo. Santa Barbara broke out of its offensive slump Thursday as
junior forward Mark Hull had 19 points and a career-high 14 rebounds
in a 70-57 victory over Pacific. In the first meeting this season,
the Gauchos won at Northridge, 57-54.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UC Riverside (6-13, 3-8) at Cal State Fullerton (4-16, 1-10), 7,
KPRO (1570), KWRM (1370)--Fullerton has a four-game losing streak and
Riverside a six-game skid. Fullerton lost to UC Irvine, 72-46, last
Saturday. Riverside has not won since defeating Fullerton, 68-60, on
Jan. 12. Riverside sophomore center Vili Morton leads the Big West
with an 8.9 rebounding average.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Idaho (7-14,4-8) at Long Beach State (8-15, 4-8), 7:30--Long Beach
is coming off a 60-53 loss to Utah State, a game in which the 49ers
shot only 35%. Long Beach will be without senior center Rudy Williams
for the second consecutive game because of a wrist injury. Williams
might miss the rest of the season. Idaho, with no player taller than
6-6, lost to Irvine, 52-38, Thursday.</TE>

<HD>Barrera Postpones Title Fight</HD>
<DH>Boxing: Rib injury forces featherweight bout to be moved
back at least a month. Rival Morales is critical of move.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For 10 days, Marco Antonio Barrera tried to fight through the pain of
bruised ribs.</LD>
<LD>   In the end, he lost that fight.</LD>
<LD>   Injured in a sparring session with Robbie Peden at his training
headquarters in Big Bear, Barrera has been forced to postpone a
featherweight title fight against Erik Morales, scheduled for March 2
at Las Vegas' MGM Grand Garden Arena.</LD>
<TE>   The fight will be rescheduled for April or May.</TE>
<TE>   It's been a bitter promotion from the start. Barrera, still fuming
over the split decision he lost to Morales in their first fight in
February 2000, has been openly disdainful of Morales, and Morales has
responded in kind.</TE>
<TE>   The two exchanged punches at a news conference in Texas, and
nobody who was there thought there was anything fake about it.</TE>
<TE>   And now, even the postponement has turned bitter.</TE>
<TE>   "These types of injuries are part of the job," said Morales upon
learning he'd have to wait a little longer before finally getting
back into the ring with Barrera. "Anyone who does this for a living
knows that you hurt every day and that's just part of training hard.</TE>
<TE>   "My elbow is hurting very bad and I have a mouse under my right
eye from the training, but I just take some medicine and get back in
the ring and train.</TE>
<TE>   "When I fought Guty Espadas, I was not 100% and it showed in the
ring. I felt very sick, but I did the best I could and I won. I have
been criticized for that performance, but when I sign a contract and
give my word, I keep it.</TE>
<TE>   "He went to so many doctors and exams until he found one who told
him he was hurt and he couldn't fight. I understand that, when you
are really injured, you can't fight. But you do not cancel an
important fight because you don't feel well. I think it's time that
he admits that he's afraid of fighting me."</TE>
<TE>   Said Barrera, "The doctors have advised me that I should not
attempt to fight. My trainers also agree. I am very saddened over
this, but I want my fans to know that I have done everything possible
since the accident."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shelly Finkel, Mike Tyson's manager, says he is getting "mixed
signals" from California about the possibility of staging a
Tyson-Lennox Lewis heavyweight title fight at Staples Center. There
has been heated debate over licensing Tyson after the Nevada State
Athletic Commission denied the former two-time heavyweight champ's
bid for a license late last month.</TE>
<TE>   Although it appears the climate may be more favorable in Texas,
where Finkel has applied for a license for his fighter, he also has
obtained a license application from the California Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The fight was originally scheduled for April 6. The earliest
possible date now is April 13.</TE>

<HD>Council Discusses Transfer Proposal</HD>
<DH>CIF: Official concedes that pre-enrollment contact form
wouldn't prevent unscrupulous behavior.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Interscholastic Federation's proposed statewide
pre-enrollment contact form that aims to curb violations of undue
influence rules would not necessarily prevent school officials from
lying to enroll athletic transfers, a section commissioner conceded
Friday after the state's federated council discussed the issue during
its regular meeting at the Los Angeles Airport Marriott.</LD>
<LD>   But the form would serve as a deterrent and could document
dishonesty if a transfer was later found to have been recruited by
school officials or intermediaries, Southern Section Commissioner Jim
Staunton said.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think there's any way to prevent dishonesty," Staunton
said. "However, if you signed a form and put your name to it, this
society thinks that's pretty significant. So if a principal found
that a coach had physically put his name on a document and lied, that
could have some serious consequences at the school site and as far as
CIF is concerned."</LD>
<TE>   The proposed form would require principals, athletic directors and
coaches to certify that no one connected with booster clubs or
athletic department had contact with prospective transfers. The form
would have to be signed by officials at the former school and the new
school, as well as by the transferring student and his parents.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposal, prospective transfers would have to submit the
pre-enrollment contact form in addition to a form requesting transfer
eligibility if they were utilizing an open-enrollment transfer. Those
transferring through a change of address would not have to submit the
contact form unless questions arose concerning possible recruitment.</TE>
<TE>   Penalties for failing to disclose pre-enrollment contact would
include: forfeiture of games in which the student was a member of the
team, disqualification of the student's team from the playoffs and
forfeiture of championships won while the student was a member of the
team.</TE>
<TE>   Staunton would rule on penalties for the Southern Section, while a
discipline panel would rule in the Los Angeles City Section. The
proposal could face a vote in May.</TE>

quarter-mile drag strip at Pomona Raceway to claim the top qualifying
position at the 42nd K&amp;N Filters Winternationals on Friday, Andrew
Cowin knocked him into second with a blistering 4.49-second run, a
track record.</LD>
<LD>   Cowin is a 22-year-old Australian who lives in Huntington Beach
and drives for team owner Darrell Gwynn. Cowin became only the sixth
driver in NHRA history to go under 4.5 seconds. He went 324.98 mph at
the top end, and his 277.89 mph at the one-eighth mile mark was
unofficially the fastest in NHRA history. By comparison, a 275-mph
run at a quarter-mile will earn a driver his top fuel license.</LD>
<LD>   "I was hanging on like a fool," said Cowin, the driver of the New
York Yankee car. "I pinched myself about six times. It's starting to
hurt. I know it's real."</LD>
<TE>   Gwynn replaced Mike Dunn with Cowin in the cockpit, and Ken Veney
with Todd Smith as crew chief.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a real good baseline now," said Cowin, who dropped two
cylinders late in the run. "That was my first full run in Darrell
Gwynn's dragster. Todd knows what he's doing. I think we'll do 330
[today]."</TE>
<TE>   The final two rounds of qualifying begin at 11 a.m. for the first
event of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Cowin replaced Dunn--who finished fourth in the series--not only
for his driving skills, but also "his youth and personality on the
track," Gwynn said. "He reminded me of myself, only more mature. I'm
reliving some of my memories through Andrew.... This is the youth and
enthusiasm tour."</TE>
<TE>   Bernstein, 57, the series champion on his Forever Red farewell
tour, went 4.583 seconds at 326.16 mph, and Doug Kalitta's 4.593 run
Thursday held up for third. Clay Millican is fourth at 4.651.</TE>
<TE>   Cowin was lined up alongside Cory McClenathan, who sat out last
season and is driving for the new Henkelman &amp; Baca team in the car he
drove for Joe Gibbs. McClenathan, the worst qualifier Thursday,
posted a solid 4.662 at 315.25 mph and is seventh.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to do well, but we want to be realistic," said
McClenathan, whose effort came together in the last two weeks. "We
just want to qualify."</TE>
<TE>   Funny car driver John Force of Yorba Linda lowered his top
qualifying time to 4.749 seconds at 322.27 mph, despite almost
putting his 2001 Mustang into the wall. He left driver-side tire
marks about a foot from the concrete barrier at the halfway point.</TE>
<TE>   Force's teammate, Tony Pedregon of Chino Hills, moved past Whit
Bazemore into second place in qualifying, clocking 4.809 at 322.65
mph. Bazemore's 4.815 from Thursday was third, followed by Friday
efforts from Del Worsham at 4.817 (318.09 mph) and Ron Capps at 4.852
(313.88 mph).</TE>
<TE>   The track record fell for the second day in a row in the pro stock
ranks as Ron Krisher of Warren, Ohio, drove his Chevy Cavalier to the
finish line in 6.815 seconds, 202.94 mph. He broke standards set
Thursday by Jim Yates (6.825 seconds) and Kurt Johnson (202.88 mph).</TE>

<HD>Ducks' Streak Comes to End</HD>
<DH>Hockey: After winning franchise-record six in a row,
Anaheim falls to Carolina, 4-1, despite taking early lead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At least it was fun while it lasted.</LD>
<LD>   With a chance to tie a franchise record for consecutive victories,
the Mighty Ducks fell short from notching their seventh in a row and
lost to the Carolina Hurricanes, 4-1, Friday night in front of 10,589
at the Arrowhead Pond.</LD>
<LD>   Anaheim goaltender Jean-Sebastien Giguere did not have one of his
better games and Carolina captain Ron Francis scored two goals to end
the Ducks' winning streak at six.</LD>
<TE>   The Ducks, who hadn't lost since Jan. 21, started out playing like
a team owning the longest winning streak in the league. One shift
after another, the Ducks maintained pressure on Carolina, which lost
a tough one-goal game against the Kings at Staples Center on Thursday
night.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't take long for Anaheim's attack to pay off. Winger Mike
Leclerc, who has been playing well skating on the Ducks' top line
with Paul Kariya and Andy McDonald, scored his 17th goal of the
season when he jumped on a loose puck in the slot and beat Carolina
goaltender Tom Barrasso 3:41 into the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We have guys who are going hard to the net now," said Leclerc,
who has five goals and four assists in his last eight games.</TE>
<TE>   "We started the play off by doing a good job getting the puck in
deep."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout their six-game winning streak, the Ducks did an
excellent job of riding momentum. That didn't happen on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim had a defensive breakdown near the end of the first period
and Carolina capitalized when defenseman David Tanabe dropped a
perfect pass to Rod Brind'Amour, who beat Giguere for his 15th goal
of the season with 1:01 remaining in the period.</TE>
<TE>   In the second, the Hurricanes came close to falling behind again
when the Ducks attacked Barrasso from all angles early in the period.
But despite a couple of great chances, the Ducks couldn't find the
net and the score remained 1-1.</TE>
<TE>   With 7:30 left in the period, the Hurricanes found themselves with
an gopportunity to take their first lead of the game thanks to a
four-minute power play after a high-sticking penalty on Anaheim's
Samuel Pahlsson, who accidentally opened a cut to the left eye of
Brind'Amour, who didn't return to the game.</TE>
<TE>   The Hurricanes, however, weren't able to capitalize with their
lengthy man advantage because the Ducks' penalty-killers--led by
scrappy forward Dan Bylsma--answered the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   But shortly after Carolina's power play ended, the Ducks again got
sloppy on the defensive end and this time Francis made them pay with
his first goal of the game. With Anaheim defenseman Vitaly Vishnevski
losing his stick on the play, Francis gave the Hurricanes a 2-1 lead
12 seconds after Pahlsson skated out of the penalty box when he beat
Giguere low to his glove side at 16:42.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a pleasure to watch him play," Carolina left wing Bates
Battaglia said about playing with Francis, who will turn 39 on March
1. "Every night he comes to play."</TE>
<TE>   At the start of the third period, the Ducks received a small boost
from their fans, which gave the team a nice cheer. But that good
feeling came to a quick end when Jeff Friesen was called for a
slashing penalty 1:19 into the period.</TE>
<TE>   After killing off Friesen's penalty, the Ducks never seemed to
regain control of the game's flow and Carolina added a key insurance
goal. Winger Jeff O'Neill, who is one of the most underrated
offensive players in the league, scored his 22nd of the season on a
goal set up by a sweet pass from center Josef Vasicek.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing by two goals, the Ducks tried to force the action and
that worked against them. Because Anaheim had to take more chances
defensively, the game opened up and Carolina was able to take a 4-1
lead on Francis' second goal of the night.</TE>
<TE>   Winger Sami Kapanen fired a shot from just inside the blue-line
that was initially stopped by Giguere, who couldn't hold on and left
the puck outside the net. That's when Francis skate untouched from
behind and scored one of the easiest goals of his career with 6:38
left in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Giguere finished with 24 saves.</TE>

<LD>Since being made a healthy scratch by Coach Bryan Murray on Jan. 21,
right wing Marty McInnis has provided plenty of grit for the Mighty
Ducks, playing on a line with center Matt Cullen and left wing German
Titov.</LD>
<LD>   Although McInnis hasn't scored a goal since returning to the
lineup, Murray has been pleased with his effort.</LD>
<LD>   "That line has been a decent line for us," Murray said. "Marty has
played well since he's come back. We've put him back running the
point on the power play and he is a real good veteran for us."</LD>
<TE>   McInnis may not be scoring but he's been able to cut his
plus-minus rating by four, going from minus-17 to minus-13 heading
into Friday night's game with Carolina at the Arrowhead Pond.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to score more goals of course, but it's a lot easier
to live with when you're winning," McInnis said. "Not scoring is
tough to deal with when you're losing every night by a goal like we
were before.</TE>
<TE>   "But I know I can play better and so can our line."</TE>
<TE>   With the Ducks starting to get consistent traffic in front of
opposing goaltenders every night, McInnis realizes that it's only a
matter of time before he starts recording more points as a power-play
quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not the best skater going backwards," McInnis said. "But
playing on the power play is good because I get to have the puck a
lot and I get a chance to make plays."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Goaltender Ilja Bryzgalov has been added to the Russian Olympic
team to fill a spot left open for San Jose's Evgeni Nabokov, who was
ruled ineligible for the Salt Lake City Games on Jan. 31.</TE>

<LD>Santa Ana Foothill is looking forward to another successful run in
the Southern Section playoffs, albeit from a different perspective.</LD>
<LD>   The Knights have been atop the Division I rankings for nearly two
seasons, but a loss to Santa Margarita last weekend in the semifinals
of the Southern California Invitational will almost certainly drop
them behind the Eagles and into the second-seeded slot when the
playoff pairings are announced Monday.</LD>
<LD>   That won't come as a surprise to Foothill coaches and players, who
will be seeking a third consecutive Division I title when the
tournament begins Thurs- day.</LD>
<TE>   "It's good to play from the back seat," Co-Coach Dan Klatt said.
"That way, we can't take anything for granted."</TE>
<TE>   The Knights plan to be more humble than they were a year ago, when
they edged Santa Margarita, 7-6, in overtime to win the section
championship.</TE>
<TE>   That victory came only three weeks after Foothill blasted Santa
Margarita, 11-1, in the semifinals of the Southern California
Invitational.</TE>
<TE>   Foothill junior Gabbie Domanic said the loss to Santa Margarita
served as a wake-up call; something the Knights could use heading
into the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Domanic said the Knights didn't take advantage of their strengths
against a bigger Santa Margarita team. They were slow on the
counterattack, hesitant to drive to the goal and didn't communicate
well.</TE>
<TE>   "The shortest player on Santa Margarita is like 5-9, so we have to
play smart," Domanic said. "As long as we play as a team, we can step
up any day."</TE>
<TE>   Dave Mikesell, Foothill's other co-coach, said the loss to Santa
Margarita has already provided his team a lift.</TE>
<TE>   "[Monday's] was one of the best practices we've had all season,''
Mikesell said. On Tuesday, the Knights defeated Anaheim Canyon, 14-1,
to win their third consecutive Century League title.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Here today, gone tomorrow: Chris Carlson abruptly resigned as
girls' and boys' water polo coach at Etiwanda earlier this week,
citing "a complete difference of philosophy with the administration
and with the way things are going to be done."</TE>
<TE>   Carlson wouldn't go into specifics, referring the matter to Vice
Principal Todd Haag, who would only confirm Carlson's resignation.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a difficult decision for him and a personal decision for
him," Haag said. "Our athletes who are involved are concerned and
emotional."</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles were leading the Mt. Baldy League at the time of
Carlson's resignation and ranked No. 7 in Division V.</TE>
<TE>   "The focus should be on the kids and how hard they work," said
Carlson, who has coached water polo and taught at Etiwanda for six
years.</TE>
<TE>   The boys' team has won four consecutive league titles under
Carlson.</TE>
<TE>   The girls' team (20-6, 10-0) won its fourth title in five years
with a 5-3 victory over Rancho Cucamonga on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Strong play: Goalkeeper Meridith McColl of Mission Viejo
Capistrano Valley had an impressive week.</TE>
<TE>   She stopped 17 shots Monday in a 5-4 loss to No. 4 El Toro, then
turned away 20 shots in an 8-6 victory Tuesday over No. 9 Long Beach
Wilson.</TE>

<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>While their King teammates flew home after Friday night's game, Ziggy
Palffy and Lubomir Visnovsky stayed behind in Arizona.</LD>
<LD>   They'll fly this morning to Salt Lake City, where they'll play for
Slovakia in an Olympic preliminary-round game against Latvia Sunday
night before rejoining the Kings for Monday night's game against the
Dallas Stars at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   "Everybody's excited," Palffy said before Friday night's game.
"It's going to be great. Going to the Olympics is always great."</LD>
<TE>   Slovakia is one of eight teams required to qualify for two spots
in the main competition, which starts Friday after NHL play is
suspended for 12 days.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the way it's supposed to be, I guess," Palffy said of the
scheduling conflict between the preliminary round and NHL games. "For
us, we've got the biggest chance to win this qualifying. I don't
think it's going to be that big a deal. But we have to be ready
because it's not going to be easy."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings only last month reversed their previous position,
allowing Palffy and Visnovsky to leave the team this weekend.
Management had said for months that it would not release them to play
in the preliminary round.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Andy Murray again applauded the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think it's great," he said. "The Olympics are special, and
I think everybody should have the chance to go."</TE>
<TE>   Visnovsky sat out Friday night's game after suffering what Murray
called a "slight charley horse" late in Thursday night's 2-1 victory
over the Carolina Hurricanes, but the coach said Visnovsky should be
OK to play Sunday night for Slovakia.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Murray praised the play of defenseman Mathieu Schneider in his
return to the lineup Thursday night. "Some of the rust he showed the
first time off the injury list ... didn't show," Murray said.
Schneider scored a first-period goal after sitting out two games
because of a shoulder strain.... With Visnovsky sidelined, defenseman
Jere Karalahti returned to the King lineup Friday night for the first
time in 19 games.... Defenseman Jaroslav Modry was back in the lineup
after sitting out Thursday's game because of a strained hip flexor.</TE>

<HD>Marbury Is Charged With 'Extreme DUI'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Phoenix Sun point guard Stephon Marbury was arrested Friday on a
charge of driving under the influence after an officer saw his car
weaving on the road in Scottsdale, Ariz.</LD>
<LD>   An officer started following Marbury because he appeared to be
speeding, then watched as the car began moving in and out of its
lane, Scottsdale police spokesman Officer Scott Reed said.</LD>
<LD>   Marbury was clocked at 75 mph in a 50 mph zone and pulled over,
Reed said. Marbury's speech was slurred and his breath smelled like
alcohol, police said.</LD>
<TE>   A portable breath test indicated Marbury had a blood alcohol level
of .153, the police said. The legal limit for driving in Arizona is
0.08. A blood test also will be conducted.</TE>
<TE>   Marbury was booked into the city jail on charges of extreme DUI,
DUI and speeding, Reed said. Extreme DUI, a charge that can be used
when a person has a blood alcohol level of at least 0.15, carries
harsher penalties.</TE>
<TE>   Reed said Marbury was held for about two hours before being
released. The case was referred to the city prosecutor's office.</TE>
<TE>   "I must accept responsibility for my actions and I apologize to my
teammates, the organization and the community for whatever
embarrassment I have caused," Marbury said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Sun president Bryan Colangelo, who was in Philadelphia for the
All-Star game, said the team would act after the details of the
arrest and the legal outcome were known.</TE>
<TE>   "We are extremely disappointed to learn of this incident involving
Stephon Marbury," Colangelo said.</TE>

<TE>   Charlotte Hornet guard Baron Davis was picked to replace the
injured Vince Carter for Sunday's All-Star game.</TE>
<TE>   Carter, the leading vote-getter for the third consecutive season,
strained his left quadriceps Thursday in Toronto's game against San
Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, in his third season from UCLA, will participate in his
first All-Star game. He is averaging 19.1 points and 8.7 assists.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' bags were packed for a trip to Los Angeles before he
learned at midnight Thursday that he would take Carter's place on the
East roster.</TE>
<TE>   "I was excited--how would you take it?" Davis said. "Man, that was
a like a dream come true. This is like a whole other level."</TE>
<TE>   East Coach Byron Scott said Jason Kidd will start in Carter's
spot.</TE>

<TE>   The clock trick known as "home cooking" won't be a factor in this
year's NBA playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The league's Rules and Competition Committee adopted a change in
timekeeping practices, mandating that the person running the clock in
postseason games must be from a neutral city.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a few occasions in regular-season games where there
been some issues with timekeepers," NBA vice president Stu Jackson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Timekeepers, from time to time, have been known to start the clock
a split-second late if the home team is inbounding with very little
time left on the shot clock or the game clock. The practice has
become common enough that players routinely notice when a timekeeper
doesn't provide "home cooking."</TE>
<TE>   "This will ensure that the game is timed correctly and there's no
concern by anyone as to whether or not there's anything going on with
the home team," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   The committee decided against tinkering with flagrant foul rules,
but it did decide to move toward changing the name of the injured
list to the inactive list, thereby ending the practice of teams
stashing healthy players with phony injuries because there is no room
on the 12-man active roster.</TE>
<TE>   Such a change must still be approved by the players' union.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gerald Wallace didn't see Julius Erving take off from the foul
line, missed Spud Webb's electrifying performance and the classic
battles between Michael Jordan and Dominique Wilkins.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace never was a fan of the NBA slam dunk contest. Today, the
19-year-old rookie forward will try to win it anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was in high school, I could dunk anytime I wanted, so
dunking never was very exciting to me and I didn't pay attention to
the slam dunk contest," Wallace said. "I just want to go out and have
fun."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace, averaging 2.7 points for the Sacramento Kings, will be
going against Golden State's Jason Richardson, Houston's Steve
Francis and Seattle's Desmond Mason, the defending champion.</TE>
<TE>   It's the fewest contestants since the event was first held in
1984.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a few tricks up my sleeve," Richardson said. "I saw what
Desmond did last year and I'm sure there's some things he can do
better."</TE>
<TE>   Today's schedule also includes a rookie-sophomore game, the
three-point shootout and a mini four-on-four Hoop-It-Up tournament
with teams made up of an NBA player, a WNBA player, a former NBA
player and a celebrity.</TE>

<LD>At first, Marc Denis wouldn't gloat about a victory in Detroit, then
the Columbus goalie admitted it was special.</LD>
<LD>   David Vyborny's goal 19 seconds into the third period helped the
Columbus Blue Jackets hand the Detroit Red Wings only their fifth
loss at home, 3-2, on Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   "It didn't matter what we did or who we did it against," said
Denis, who made 33 saves. "We just needed a total team effort to get
a win. The fact that it came against Detroit in Detroit made it that
much sweeter."</LD>
<TE>   Vyborny, who also had an assist, broke a 2-2 tie when he tipped in
a pass from Ray Whitney.</TE>
<TE>   "I just passed the puck behind the net, beat the guy from the
boards [to the net] and got the pass," said Vyborny. "I just chipped
it."</TE>
<TE>   It gave the Blue Jackets' their first win ever at Joe Louis Arena
and ended a five-game losing streak and 10-game road winless streak.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit's 13-game home unbeaten streak was ended.</TE>

<LD>History was with the Crenshaw boys' basketball team in its Coliseum
League finale Friday against Fremont, and the Cougars made it pay
off.Money Brown had 21 points and fellow guard Marcus Williams added
17 for Crenshaw and the Cougars, ranked No. 25 by The Times, clinched
second place in the Coliseum League with an 85-74 victory over No. 9
Fremont.</LD>
<LD>   Crenshaw (19-7, 8-2 in league) has not lost two home games in a
season since Willie West became coach in 1970. A home loss to Dorsey
earlier this season was motivation enough for the Cougars Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "We weren't about to lose on our home court, in front of our home
crowd," said Onyekachi Ibekwe, Crenshaw's 6-foot-7 senior captain,
who had nine points and nine rebounds.</LD>
<TE>   Fremont (20-5, 7-3) has not won at Crenshaw in Sam Sullivan's 25
years as Fremont coach.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, they have our number. Plain and simple." Sullivan
said. "They are the big bullies on the block and they know how to
steal our lunch money."</TE>
<TE>   Crenshaw led, 56-55, going into the fourth quarter but opened a
70-58 lead with five minutes left on a four-point play by Brown and a
three-point play by Ibekwe.</TE>
<TE>   Jumal Walls, a 6-8 senior center who was academically ineligible
when Crenshaw defeated Fremont, 86-82, in the first round of league
play, had 16 points, 12 rebounds and three blocks.</TE>
<TE>   This is only the second time in West's 32 seasons that Crenshaw
has not won at least a share of a league title.</TE>

<TE>   L.A. Dorsey 90, L.A. Locke 71--Donald Wilson had 21 points as No.

<TE>   Kevin Lewis scored 33 points for host Locke.</TE>

<TE>   La Verne Damien 57, Chino Hills Ayala 54--John Hickey made two

streak.</TE>

<TE>   Palmdale 41, Lancaster Antelope Valley 33--Teiosha George matched
her career high with 28 points and also had 10 rebounds for Palmdale

host Antelope Valley (24-3, 9-1).</TE>
<TE>   George, a 6-3 junior center, made 12 of 18 shots and scored her
team's first 13 points.</TE>
<TE>   Shaquina Mosley had 11 points and Laurie Hodges added eight for

<LD>Paul Westphal said he was worried before the game. "Scared to death,"

<LD>   The Pepperdine coach had reason to fret against San Francisco,
which badly needed a win at Firestone Fieldhouse to stay in striking
distance of the Waves and Gonzaga in the West Coast Conference.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Pepperdine kept the Dons at bay, 79-72, Friday before
2,946, for its 11th victory in a row.</LD>
<TE>   While the Waves, 16-6 in conference and 9-0 in the WCC, didn't put

<HD>Sampras, Roddick Get U.S. Off to Good Start</HD>
<DH>Tennis: They struggle in their singles matches but both win
to give Americans 2-0 Davis Cup lead against Slovakia.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OKLAHOMA CITY</DL>
<LD>Hyper followed mellow. Teen angst was teamed with 30-something doubt.
It would be like snowboarders coexisting on the same slope with
skiers wearing leather boots.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, 19-year-old Andy Roddick and 30-year-old Pete Sampras
were looking for common ground as Davis Cup teammates. They found
it--at least temporarily--both struggling much more than expected
against their lightly regarded Slovakian opponents at the Convention
Center.</LD>
<LD>   Sampras went first and was two points away from needing to play a
fifth set against No. 268-ranked Karol Beck. He has been there before
lately. Anyone remember his woes against the likes of Cedric Kaufmann
or Barry Cowan last year?</LD>
<TE>   He barely managed to beat those two journeymen and scuffled
through against Beck, winning, 6-3, 6-7 (3), 6-1, 7-5, in 2 hours 25
minutes. Beck had 21 aces to 17 for Sampras.</TE>
<TE>   Roddick's match was two minutes shorter and it shared the same
roller-coaster nature as the first one. He squandered a 5-1 lead in
the third-set tiebreaker and needed another tiebreaker to prevent a
fifth set, defeating No. 269 Jan Kroslak, 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (5), 7-6 (1).
The victories gave the United States a 2-0 lead against Slovakia in
this best-of-five first-round match.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has lost only three times in 154 matches when leading 2-0
in Davis Cup, most recently in 1994 in the semifinals against Sweden.
The third point could come today in the doubles-- featuring rookie
Mardy Fish and James Blake against Kroslak and Beck. But the U.S. has
not won the doubles since defeating Australia in the quarterfinals in
1999, an 0-5 stretch.</TE>
<TE>   They've tried many combinations, mostly veterans. Now the kids
could complete the delivery into the next round against Spain or
Morocco, which are tied, 1-1.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras, who returned to Davis Cup action for the first time in
nearly two years, had to smile about Team Cross-Generation.</TE>
<TE>   "It is more of these guys coming out, bouncing off the walls,"
Sampras said. "They have got a lot of energy, and, you know, they are
watching 'The Simpsons' at night. And I am with Todd Martin watching
'On Golden Pond.' So they can't sit still for half an hour. They have
dinner. They are up in the room, playing games, and playing pingpong
in their underwear. That's what these guys are doing."</TE>
<TE>   The ever-hyper Roddick was amused, saying: "I haven't stripped
down in my underwear this week. But it's not over yet. Maybe I have
something to look forward to. I think it's normal. They are a little,
you know, a lot more mature than we are."</TE>
<TE>   Said U.S. captain Patrick McEnroe: "These are wild young boys,
they are young bucks. They have a lot of energy and that's good for
Pete. I think it's worked well."</TE>
<TE>   Roddick's energy spilled over in the tiebreaker and essentially
cost him the set. He led, 5-1, and Kroslak won the final six points.
A set later, Roddick, who is wearing braces to support his
often-injured ankles, did not make the same mistake by celebrating
prematurely.</TE>
<TE>   "You get a taste of how quickly he learns," McEnroe said. "He knew
he got a little overexcited in that third set and everybody was
jumping up and down and going crazy, including myself and the guys on
the bench. He just kept his composure in that fourth set when he got
the lead."</TE>
<TE>   Inexperience ended up playing a larger role in the first match.
Beck, 19, realized by the start of the third set he could play with
Sampras, repeatedly finishing points with his smooth two-handed
backhand. He served for the fourth set, at 5-4, and reached 30-30 but
lost it with two unforced errors, a forehand in the net and a
forehand long.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't feel like I was in trouble in the set," Sampras said. "I
was in trouble in the match. I felt he was having to close it out
there and maybe a little inexperience would come into play and it
did. He missed a few shots here and there and I managed to capitalize
on a couple of his errors. But I was in a little bit of trouble
there, but I still felt pretty good for a fifth."</TE>

favored Americans was a minor victory for Slovakia, which was missing

<HD>Bruins Made Impression on Wright</HD>

<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Villanova Coach Jay Wright vividly remembers UCLA beating his team
last season, but it wasn't the Bruins' 93-65 nonconference victory
over the Wildcats at Pauley Pavilion.</LD>
<LD>   Wright was the coach at Hofstra, which lost in the first round of
the NCAA tournament to UCLA, 61-48.</LD>
<LD>   "One of the great lessons I learned from that game is that UCLA is
a bunch of tough kids," he said. "We had some tough New York City
kids and I thought we played very physical in that game. I was very
impressed with UCLA's toughness defensively and their will. We led
much of the way and that group stuck together and put us away."</LD>
<TE>   Hofstra, which came in with an 18-game winning streak, did not
make a field goal in the last nine minutes and was outscored in the
second half by 17 points.</TE>
<TE>   Wright, of course, has watched video of Villanova's one-sided loss
last season to the Bruins in which the Wildcats had 26 turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA forward Jason Kapono scored a career-high 28 points and Matt
Barnes had a brilliant all-around game with 15 points, seven
rebounds, five assists and six steals. Center Dan Gadzuric played
only nine minutes because of back spasms and T.J. Cummings came off
the bench to score 13 points.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to think we are taking care of the basketball a little
better," Wright said. "Our team is playing consistently, just not
good enough to beat these top-20 teams. I'm not disappointed in our
progression."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY</TE>
<TE>   at Villanova, 10 a.m. PST, Channel 2</TE>
<TE>   Site--The Pavilion, Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KXTA (1150).</TE>
<TE>   Records--No. 15 UCLA 16-6, Villanova 12-8.</TE>
<TE>   Update--UCLA could be ripe for a letdown. The Bruins are coming
off an emotional victory over USC and could look past the Wildcats,
whom they beat by 28 points last season. Furthermore, UCLA defeated
the only other Big East Conference team on this season's schedule,
Georgetown, rather easily. Wright considers versatile senior Brooks
Sales "our most valuable player." The 6-foot-10 Sales, who can play
in the post or on the perimeter, averages 10.2 points and 8.9
rebounds. Guard Gary Buchanan averages 19.2 points and forward Ricky
Wright averages 14.5. Villanova lost its last two games.</TE>

<HD>USC's Hollans Seeking Focus</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Terry</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aisha Hollans is a great example of what has been excellent and
maddening about USC women's basketball this season.</LD>
<LD>   The 5-foot-9 sophomore from Berkeley, who with her USC teammates
is preparing to face UCLA today at the Sports Arena, has overcome the
back problems of her freshman season to lead the Trojans in scoring
at 17.2 points a game, including a career-high 29 against then-No. 12
Florida.</LD>
<LD>   She is USC's second-leading rebounder behind Ebony Hoffman, and
her 6.4 rebound average is tops among Pacific 10 Conference guards.</LD>
<TE>   But like other Trojans, Hollans--who admits to having problems
"maintaining focus" off the court--can have moments of immaturity
that drive the coaches crazy.</TE>
<TE>   Her biggest mistake was missing a morning practice the week of the
Jan. 17 Arizona game. USC was already shorthanded--Hoffman was
suspended one game for fighting and Tiffany Elmore was injured.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Coach Chris Gobrecht sat Hollans for the game, which USC
lost.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought at one point she might let me play, but she stuck to
her guns," Hollans said of Gobrecht. "I respected her for that. I was
irresponsible; it was my fault I didn't play in that game. I should
have had more than one alarm clock set, or someone call me."</TE>
<TE>   Hollans also said she fell behind in a class in the fall and
worried about her eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   "I would tell myself I'd make up what I missed, but I
procrastinated a lot last year," Hollans said. "This semester I have
prioritized things a lot more."</TE>
<TE>   Said Gobrecht: "Aisha is one of the most gifted players I've had
the privilege of coaching. But when you are a great player, you have
a responsibility to impact every single moment on the court to the
best of your ability. She can be great at anything she chooses to
value--rebounding, passing, defense. Helping her to develop that
value base is what we're working on."</TE>
<TE>   Hollans said that she welcomes Gobrecht's attention.</TE>
<TE>   "If I didn't [care] she wouldn't push me the way she does,"
Hollans said. "But she knows I can become a great player, so she's
going to push me to my edge--and probably over it."</TE>

at Norfolk on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Old Dominion (16-5, 12-0) led 36-12 at halftime despite being
outrebounded, 24-18. George Mason (11-12, 5-7 made only five of 29

Kellogg's Tony the Tiger and the Marlboro Man. In fact, according to a
spokeswoman for the Leo Burnett USA ad agency in Chicago, Tennant played
a role in creating both icons but was not solely responsible for either.</LD>

<LD>In a decision that roiled Compton's topsy-turvy politics and
surprised legal experts, a judge ousted the city's sitting mayor Friday
and replaced him with the defeated incumbent, Omar Bradley.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Judith C. Chirlin reversed the results of June's
city election in a 33-page ruling that quoted liberally from Charles
Dickens. She removed Eric Perrodin, mayor for the last seven months, and
ousted newly elected Councilwoman Leslie Irving.</LD>
<LD>   Melanie Andrews, an educator who lost the election to Irving, was
ordered installed on the City Council in Irving's place. Chirlin, citing
fraud by Irving and three members of her family, permanently barred
Irving from holding office in California.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling expressed the judge's disappointment at the conduct of all
sides in the case and urged more responsible behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "To those of you involved in this case, whether on the prevailing or
the other side, whether this decision ushers in the 'best of times' or
'the worst of times,' 'the spring of hope' or 'the winter of despair,' is
up to you," she wrote, quoting from "A Tale of Two Cities."</TE>
<TE>   Legal scholars said the fraud ruling in Irving's case is likely to
withstand an appeal, but Chirlin's decision on the mayoralty may not.</TE>
<TE>   The judge ruled that because Perrodin's name illegally appeared first
on all ballots, he got an improper statistical advantage worth at least
306 votes, enough to determine the outcome. The ruling was based on
research by an Ohio State political scientist who testified about the
impact of the city clerk's failure to randomly list the names of
candidates on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling "is quite extraordinary," said Columbia University election
law specialist Samuel Issacharoff.</TE>
<TE>   The decision ended a 10-week trial with another stunning chapter in
the generations-long history of vicious politics in the city of 93,000.
It returned full control over city government to Bradley, who as mayor
from 1993 to 2001 married brash statements with a record of
infrastructure improvements to become one of Southern California's
best-known politicians.</TE>
<TE>   And it created confusion and a host of new legal conflicts. Perrodin
said late Friday that he will appeal next week. In addition, Bradley
remains a subject of a criminal investigation by the Los Angeles County
district attorney's office--which is the employer of Perrodin, an
assistant district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   The timing of the transfer of power also remains uncertain. Although
the judge ordered that certificates of election be "immediately" issued
to Bradley and Andrews, City Hall--which is open only four days a
week--was closed as scheduled Friday.</TE>
<TE>   After reports that a brother and an aide of Perrodin removed papers
from city offices Friday afternoon, county Sheriff's Capt. Cecil Rhambo,
who commands the Compton station, posted a 24-hour security detail around
the building for the rest of the weekend. He later filed a report to the
district attorney's office on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm optimistic for a smooth transition," Rhambo said.</TE>
<TE>   Even Bradley and his lawyers seemed surprised by the judge's ruling.
Many of Bradley's supporters had hoped merely for a new election.</TE>
<TE>   After hearing the decision Friday morning, Bradley clutched a Bible,
invoked the names of Martin Luther King Jr. and Medgar Evers, and thanked
God, his family and attorney Bradley Hertz. He said the legal
fight--which cost $150,000 --had so drained him financially that he
couldn't give his daughter lunch money Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "Being mayor is not the victory. It's not about Omar," Bradley said.
"The victory is that the process has been followed, the process that some
people bled and died for."</TE>
<TE>   "Thank you to Brad Hertz, a little Jewish boy from the Valley,"
Bradley added. "In the past I've made statements I've found wholly untrue
about people of that man's faith, and I've learned to only judge each
individual on their character. This man is my brother."</TE>
<TE>   In last June's election, Bradley's opponents accused him of having
used his office to enrich relatives and friends and retaliate against
opponents. He has had particularly bitter enemies among the city's public
employee unions.</TE>
<TE>   Some saw his decision in 2000 to disband the Compton Police Department
and turn patrol duties over to the county sheriff as a personal attack on
Compton police officers, including Perrodin's brother, who had challenged
his ethics. Bradley said he made the move to improve public safety.</TE>
<TE>   A subdued Perrodin, who learned of the decision while prosecuting an
accused thief, first told reporters that he was unsure about an appeal.
But later Friday, he said he had made up his mind to go forward. With
Bradley back in charge, Perrodin will almost certainly have to pay for
the appeal himself. The city had spent more than $500,000 defending the
election results.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to appeal, probably the first thing Monday morning," he
said. "Not so much for me but for the people. I've been weighing it all
day, and it wouldn't be right for me not to appeal."</TE>
<TE>   Perrodin stressed that the judge found no evidence he violated the
law, though Chirlin did criticize him for making threatening and obscene
gestures and comments to firefighters on election day.</TE>
<TE>   The judge found that 144 illegal votes were cast, and she ruled that
City Clerk Charles Davis conducted the elections in a "careless" and
"slipshod" manner. She said she was particularly disturbed by
discrepancies between the number of ballots recorded by precinct
officials and subsequent ballot counts in court.</TE>
<TE>   But those findings, Chirlin said, were not enough to overturn the
result.</TE>
<TE>   The judge's decision to award the election to Bradley hinged on the
arcana of mathematics and ballot order--and the research of political
science professor Jon Krosnick.</TE>
<TE>   Chirlin found that the city clerk violated the law when he failed to
list the candidates in the June 5 election in random order. Instead, both
Perrodin and Irving were listed first.</TE>
<TE>   In testimony that was given heavy weight by the judge, Krosnick argued
that the advantage gained from being first on the ballot is between 2.87%
and 3.32%. That figure, he testified, was based on research he did in
Franklin County, Ohio--and on ballot position data from 2000 presidential
and U.S. Senate races in California and North Dakota.</TE>
<TE>   Applying those percentages to the more than 10,000 votes cast in
Compton, Chirlin calculated that Perrodin got at least 306 votes that
should have been Bradley's. Perrodin, a prosecutor who had never run for
office before, led the two-term incumbent by 281 votes in June in what
political observers viewed then as a monumental upset.</TE>
<TE>   Reversing an election on that line of reasoning is unusual, legal
scholars said. UCLA law professor Daniel Lowenstein, an elections expert,
said he would welcome a challenge. "This seems like the kind of case
you'd feel an appellate court might look at differently," he said. "It's
novel enough that, if [Perrodin] has the resources, I'd expect him to
appeal."</TE>
<TE>   Fred Woocher, a Santa Monica attorney and election law expert, said
the ruling was "probably worthy" of appellate review. He tried to get
into the courtroom Friday morning but found himself stuck behind 50 other
would-be court watchers.</TE>
<TE>   "When I saw she actually ordered Bradley back in place, that's a
pretty strong result," said Woocher, who would have expected a new
election. "I haven't seen any of the evidence. But testimony that ballot
order might have had an effect strikes me as somewhat short of the
quantum of proof necessary to literally change the outcome and put one
person in office as opposed to another. This is a new one on me."</TE>
<TE>   Irving also benefited from being placed first on the ballot, the judge
found. But that benefit alone did not overturn her 531-vote victory.</TE>
<TE>   Chirlin said the combination of that advantage and fraud by Irving and
her family overturned the result. The judge said she was con-vinced that
the Irvings knowingly registered noncitizens to vote, solicited votes
from absentee voters and then lied about it in court.</TE>
<TE>   "The testimony regarding the activities of Leslie Irving; her sister,
Kellie Irving; her mother, Janice Irving; and her father, Welton Irving,
is perhaps the most disturbing this court has heard in years," Chirlin
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Leslie Irving," the judge said, citing the California Elections Code
regarding public officials who knowingly allow fraud, "is forever
disqualified from holding office in this state."</TE>
<TE>   In other parts of the ruling, Chirlin turned aside a challenge to the
reelection in June of Councilwoman Yvonne Arceneaux. Frank Wheaton, a
Bradley ally, had alleged that Arceneaux was ineligible to hold office
because of an incomplete voter registration document from 1978.</TE>
<TE>   The judge also accused a key witness in the case, Basil Kimbrew, of
perjury. Kimbrew reportedly told Bradley's attorney that he had
participated in fraud on behalf of Perrodin and his slate of candidates.
But on the stand Kimbrew said he had seen nothing and been offered a
bribe. Chirlin said she was asking the district attorney to probe
Kimbrew's conduct. Kimbrew stuck by his testimony Friday and said he had
"no concern" about prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   Perrodin and members of a coalition of unions and churches that backed
his candidacy said they were worried about retribution. Father Stan
Bosch, one of a group of ministers who had challenged the tactics of the
Bradley administration, said Friday by phone from Chicago: "My concern is
that we'll return to a fear-based politics and an exclusive one."</TE>
<TE>   Bosch, who had reported threats by Bradley operatives to the FBI,
added: "If Mr. Bradley comes back with a more open disposition to the
public, we'd like to work collegially with him."</TE>
<TE>   For their part, Bradley supporters said Perrodin and his allies should
have nothing to worry about. Ernie Bland, a Bradley backer who has lived
in Compton 37 years, predicted that the once and future mayor would
reunite the city in "joyous celebration."</TE>
<TE>   "This young man has a lot of ideas," said Bland, 68, a retired postal
employee. "He can pull people together. He was already bringing people
together before he was 'defeated,' quote-unquote."</TE>
<TE>   By midafternoon Friday, more than 100 people had stopped by to
celebrate at Bradley's home. "I'm sure there's an appeal process, but
wrong is wrong. He's still the people's mayor," said Keith Cummings, a
friend of Bradley.</TE>

<HD>Skaters: Dress for Success</HD>
<DH>It's a sport in which winning a medal may have as much to do with
appearance as with skill.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOOTH MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Sarah Hughes placed third at the U.S. Figure Skating
Championships at Staples Center last month, it wasn't the seven triples
in her long program that people were buzzing about. It was that
dress--the underwhelming number in flesh-tone chiffon.</LD>
<LD>   "Poor Sarah. Team Hughes should hire me as a consultant!" wrote a New
York City woman on http://www.fsworld.com, a message board for figure
skating devotees. "The long program dress was too frumpy and pale for
her."</LD>
<LD>   It didn't end there. Another writer complained about the navy-blue
costume Hughes wore for her short program, judging it "too busy and too
old lady!"</LD>
<TE>   Although the 16-year-old skater had earned a place on the U.S. Olympic
team, that wasn't enough. The consensus among fans and experts was that
she needed a make-over and needed it fast. In a matter of days, Hughes
hired Jef Billings, an Emmy-winning skating costume designer, to give her
a fresh look.</TE>
<TE>   "A costume is important," said Robin Wagner, Hughes' coach. "If the
skating is close, it could mean a hundredth of a point."</TE>
<TE>   At the Winter Games in Salt Lake City, figure skaters will be
competing in a sport in which winning a medal may have as much to do with
their appearance on the ice as with their athleticism. "It's an opinion
sport," said Peggy Fleming, the 1968 gold medal winner turned figure
skating commentator for ABC.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. gold medal hopeful Michelle Kwan, 21, is expected to wear an
outfit by Vera Wang; Sasha Cohen, 17, who hopes to study fashion herself
one day, is designing her own.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes' coach said the decision to go with a new designer so close to
the Games was not motivated by anything more than a desire for something
new. How far the skater will go with her new look is anybody's guess.</TE>
<TE>   "She's very gray, she's kind of pale and her hair is neither here nor
there, color-wise. It looks like a short haircut that's growing out,"
said the Los Angeles-based Billings, who also designs costumes for
competitor Todd Eldredge and for the traveling "Target Stars on Ice"
show. "I suggested she get a shorter, cuter haircut and go red."</TE>
<TE>   In any case, he added, she definitely should avoid
"mother-of-the-bride-looking" dresses. "I'm thinking of her as a gamin:
kind of Grace Kelly, Audrey Hepburn-ish."</TE>
<TE>   Like everything else, it seems, figure skating has gone Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "It is entertainment as well as a sport, and costumes are vital to the
whole performance," said Yuki Saegusa, a vice president at the sports
marketing firm IMG who represents several figure skaters. "It's analogous
to the Academy Awards. People love to see what stars are wearing and
people love to see what skaters are wearing."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, figure skating draws more TV viewers than any other Olympic
sport--winter or summer. And the days when a skater's mother sewed her
Olympic costumes are long gone.</TE>
<TE>   Today the design process is a team effort involving designer, skater,
coach, choreographer and sometimes parent. During the last 15 years,
several designers, including Christian Lacroix, Donna Karan and Wang,
have begun outfitting skaters. Their creations can cost anywhere from
$1,000 to $13,000--reportedly what silver medalist Nancy Kerrigan paid
for her memorable 1994 champagne-colored, rhinestone-encrusted dress by
Wang.</TE>
<TE>   A typical woman's skating costume is a lightweight Lycra leotard with
sleeves, shoulder straps or a halter top. Straps usually are elastic so
they stay on the shoulders, and rhinestones may be sewn directly onto the
elastic. Beads and stones must be tightly anchored so they don't fall off
and endanger the skater. Sometimes skaters even sew their hair into buns
with yarn because the last thing one wants on the ice is an errant
hairpin.</TE>
<TE>   Ideally, costumes should feel like a second skin. They are built to
fit snugly around the bust without boning or under-wires, which could be
uncomfortable. See-through "illusion" fabric gives the look of a bare
neckline or back while still providing a good fit. Multiple fittings and
trial runs on the ice ensure that nothing rides up or pops off.</TE>
<TE>   Men's outfits usually are one piece, with pant legs that loop around
the skates. But they can be as flamboyant as women's costumes. At the
1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada, Czech skater Petr Barna raised
eyebrows in a sequined purple unitard that exposed his chest hair.</TE>
<TE>   The International Skating Union (ISU) does have rules about the
outfits--they must be "modest, dignified and appropriate," not "garish or
theatrical." But who can say what is in the eyes of the beholder? A
judge's assessment of a skater's costume is about as objective as a
fashion critic's review of a runway show. Unlike a fashion show, however,
skaters who break the rules are subject to more than harsh words: They
can be hit with deductions in their scores for presentation.</TE>
<TE>   Nine judges from different countries evaluate each Olympic figure
skating discipline, which consist of multiple competitions. For singles
and pairs, there are two--the short technical program and the free skate.
For each competition, a judge issues marks from 0 to 6 each for technical
merit and presentation, which count equally in determining a skater's
ranking.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the ISU insist that judges are not swayed by
appearance. But costumes, like everyday clothing, can send a subtle
message. In 1995, when Kwan was a 15-year-old wanting to make the
transition from junior to adult competitor, she simply changed her
appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Portraying Salome in her dance at Skate America, an annual
international competition sponsored by the U.S. Figure Skating Assn.,
Kwan gave up her ponytails and put her hair in a bun. She wore makeup for
the first time, despite initial objections from her father, and her
costume was a surprisingly sexy purple dress with a bare midriff. Playing
the biblical temptress, she won the competition.</TE>
<TE>   "The costume is one of the finishing touches, but you don't want it to
be distracting," said Kristi Yamaguchi, who wore a black dress with a
plunging neckline and gold embroidery for her 1992 Olympic gold
medal-winning program to Ernesto Lecuona's "Malaguena."</TE>
<TE>   "You want it to complement your music and the character you are trying
to play, but at the same time, you always want to be elegant."</TE>
<TE>   Costumes should express a skater's personality without being over the
top, said 1984 U.S. gold medalist Scott Hamilton. "Especially with the
widespread use of nude fabric, you often find yourself wondering, 'Am I
seeing what I think I'm seeing?' What you wear on the ice shouldn't be so
noticeable that it can be discussed and ridiculed."</TE>
<TE>   Skaters also have to consider the backgrounds of the judges. Europeans
tend to be fans of flamboyant costumes because of their theatrical
tradition, Hamilton said, but Americans prefer understated looks.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, costumes helped define the notorious Nancy Kerrigan-Tonya
Harding rivalry. Wang's swan-like dresses cast Kerrigan, a self-described
tomboy, as America's sweetheart. Meanwhile, Harding's glitzy showgirl
outfits, teased hair and heavy makeup only served to demonize her: She
was tacky.</TE>
<TE>   Memorable costumes such as Kerrigan's can position a figure skater for
endorsement deals and professional skating opportunities. "Someone who's
perceived as ladylike might have different kinds of endorsements than
someone who is seen as rough and tumble," said Abigail Feder-Kane, a
contributor to "Women on Ice," a 1995 book of feminist essays about the
pre-Olympic attack on Kerrigan orchestrated by a man who turned out to be
Harding's ex-husband.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Kerrigan continues to profit from her skating, touring with
"Champions on Ice." The most recent appearance of the eighth-place
Harding was on a newsmaker-themed episode of NBC's "The Weakest Link,"
along with 15-minute celebrities Darva Conger, Kato Kaelin and Gennifer
Flowers.</TE>
<TE>   When figure skating competition began in the late 1800s, women wore
demure ankle-length skirts with several petticoats for added warmth, and
men wore coats and wool tights.</TE>
<TE>   The first fashion trendsetter was Sonja Henie, the three-time
Norwegian Olympic champion--she won in 1928, 1932 and 1936. Her major
contribution was lifting skirt hems to the knee.</TE>
<TE>   By the 1940s, women wore every color and fabric imaginable, from
cherry satin and red velvet to white fur and pink chiffon, according to
"The Official Book of U.S. Figure Skating."</TE>
<TE>   Bright colors continued to be popular for women in the 1950s. For men,
the standard was a black tuxedo with an Eisenhower jacket, made famous by
two-time Olympic gold medalist Dick Button. In the 1960s, one-piece
stretch "monkey suits," with a crease at the waist to simulate the
conventional two-piece suit, replaced tuxedos.</TE>
<TE>   In 1968, Fleming departed from the ethereal chiffon looks then in
vogue, winning the gold in Grenoble, France, in a chartreuse matte jersey
dress that, like all her costumes, was sewn by her mother. "I think it
probably cost about $20," Fleming said. Her mother chose chartreuse
because the color shares its name with a French liqueur made by
Carthusian monks. "She thought it would endear me to the French people,"
Fleming said.</TE>
<TE>   Lycra and spandex and new plastic sequins and beads allowed skaters to
jump higher and sparkle more in the 1970s. But for all the headlines
Dorothy Hamill's wedge hairdo attracted at the 1976 Winter Games, her
pink outfit, sewn by a friend's mother, was fairly staid.</TE>
<TE>   By the 1980s, skating fashion reached "Dynasty" proportions. Costumes
were at their most outrageous at the 1988 Olympics, when American Debi
Thomas wore a beaded body stocking and East German Katarina Witt made
tongues wag in azure ostrich feather-trimmed bikini briefs and a
see-through skirt. (Her sexy style eventually landed her in Playboy.)</TE>
<TE>   The next year, the ISU issued the rule known in skating circles as the
"Katarina Rule," about costumes being modest and dignified. Women are
required to wear skirts that cover their hips and buttocks. Men are
prohibited from wearing tights or sleeveless clothing or exposing chest
hair. They must wear trousers. Beads, sequins and feathers cannot be
excessive.</TE>
<TE>   At least some believe that the rules are misguided, even silly. "The
sport already has an image problem because it's considered froufrou,"
said Jirina Ribbens, a figure skating expert.</TE>
<TE>   "And we add to that by making costumes an issue? Who's to say what's
decent? I'd like to see a rule that skaters have to wear plain sports
costumes."</TE>
<TE>   Feminist author Naomi Wolf believes the sport's emphasis on appearance
undercuts the meritocracy of athletic competition. "Either figure skaters
should wear a uniform or sumo wrestlers and football players should
perform in diverse, attention-grabbing high-fashion styles."</TE>
<TE>   For his 1984 gold medal performance, Hamilton opted out of sequins in
favor of a red, white and blue converted speedskating suit.</TE>
<TE>   "All the guys before me were being portrayed in the media as artists,
but they were doing these unbelievably athletic things on the ice," said
Hamilton, who is a commentator for NBC at the Salt Lake City Games.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to be considered more of a mainstream athlete, and the best
way for me to do that was to eliminate the costume issue altogether." On
the other hand, the spectacle of beauty is part of why figure skating
draws such high TV ratings. "If we make the sport boring, it might end up
doing skaters more harm," Feder-Kane said. Opportunities for commercial
endorsements and tours on the professional circuit could dry up.</TE>
<TE>   "People are fascinated by what skaters wear," said Billings, the
designer. "At the Academy Awards, Joan and Melissa [Rivers] do their
red-carpet thing. Maybe we should have someone do that for skating."</TE>

<HD>Drug Arrests Soar at Border</HD>
<DH>Security: Mexican smugglers are testing the beefed-up, post-Sept.
11 U.S. law enforcement presence. Customs officials report seizures have
since jumped.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Seizures of illegal drugs along the nation's southwest border have
skyrocketed in recent months, as Mexican smugglers run up against the
concentrated effort of U.S. law enforcement officials to police the
region after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Drug seizures from South Texas to Southern California have climbed
beyond pre-Sept. 11 levels, rebounding from the sharp decline seen in the
weeks immediately after the assault on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   That development comes as arrests of undocumented workers have fallen
dramatically and continue to decline--in some areas well over 50%.
Officials said it may portend a dramatic clash between increasingly
emboldened smugglers and shored-up police and military forces.</LD>
<TE>   "The smugglers probably believed the high security would be
short-lived," said Roger Maier, a U.S. Customs Service official in El
Paso. "And when that didn't happen, they still had to move their product.
And for us, the more we looked, the more we were going to find. And we're
looking harder than we ever have. Now we have started catching them."</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, the amount of cocaine seized by Customs
Service agents has doubled since Sept. 11, compared with the same period
a year earlier, while the amount of heroin seized has increased
twentyfold.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, customs officials report that heroin seizures since Sept.
11 have jumped more than 135% compared with a year earlier. Cocaine is up
nearly 60% and marijuana nearly 19%. The amount of illegal pills such as
Ecstasy and steroids that has been seized is up more than 955%.</TE>
<TE>   Along the border, where the most aggressive effort has been underway
to turn back illegal drug smuggling and other activities since Sept. 11,
the effort has had some surprising results.</TE>
<TE>   The decline in arrests of undocumented workers, for instance, is a
phenomenon that officials attribute to Mexican migrants becoming
increasingly wary of entering the United States after the terrorist
attacks and the roundup of illegal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, smuggling of illegal drugs, which fell initially, is now
back in full swing, even as the Bush administration plans to further
strengthen the police presence along the 2,000-mile-long border with
National Guard and U.S. military troops.</TE>
<TE>   The main thrust of the heightened police presence has been to make
sure no terrorists get through, with the side benefit of interdicting
other criminals, such as drug dealers.</TE>
<TE>   Dean Boyd, a spokesman at Customs Service headquarters in Washington,
said Friday that law enforcement officials are amazed that drug dealers
keep trying to push their way into the United States in the face of such
a daunting police barricade.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still at the highest level of alert, and we will continue to be
so for the foreseeable future," he said. "Our people are working
increasingly long hours and a lot of overtime."</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials say they have received numerous reports of drug
smugglers who stockpiled their inventories on the Mexico side of the
border, then became increasingly anxious when the beefed-up police
patrols did not leave the border towns in the weeks after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   By October, the smugglers were slowly beginning to once again move
their drugs across the line. The pace continues to accelerate.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, they saw our enhanced security and decided to wait and see
if things settled down, or they chose some alternate routes," Boyd said.</TE>
<TE>   Marijuana smuggling is a prime example.</TE>
<TE>   The increase in seizures occurred "during the middle of the marijuana
harvest season in Mexico last fall," he said. "Huge quantities normally
come up from central to northern Mexico and, after a while, if that
marijuana piles up just south of the border, it becomes a hazard for a
trafficker.</TE>
<TE>   "If I have tons and tons waiting at the border, I'm at a huge risk. My
dope might get stolen by rival factions. The Mexican police might find
me. The marijuana might rot," Boyd said. "And I have a payroll to meet.
I've got to get my product to market."</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, waiting periods to enter the U.S. have stretched to as
long as three hours, because "every vehicle, car, truck and motorcycle
gets inspected," said Maier, the El Paso customs official. "Drivers are
getting out of their cars to open the trunk, to open the hood."</TE>
<TE>   Life on the border has been transformed, and the smugglers from Mexico
could not help but notice.</TE>
<TE>   "We operate kind of in a fishbowl down here. A lot of what we do is
very visible to the traveling public and the smugglers," Maier said.
"They watch what we do and try to circumvent what we do. That's their
job, to move drugs, and they study us as closely as they can."</TE>
<TE>   Jayson Ahern, customs' director of field operations in San Diego, said
the "level one alert status" is on indefinitely. "Anti-terrorism remains
our top priority, but this increased scrutiny will continue to hamper
smugglers."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Lindenmuth, a federal public defender in McAllen, Texas, said he
is seeing a rash of cases involving smaller amounts of drugs. "We are
getting more marijuana. Not big amounts, generally under 50 kilos. It's
back to coming in like crazy. And now we're [arresting] a lot of women
for smuggling drugs."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela in Brownsville, Texas, said that in
South Texas the situation is the same as before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "They just caught a guy a few blocks away from where I am with many
hundreds of pounds of cocaine," he said, noting that the terrorist
attacks apparently have not dampened America's hunger for drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still the champion consumer of the world," he said.</TE>

<HD>In a Pageant of Pomp, Pride and Security, Salt Lake Games Open</HD>
<DH>Olympics: Fighter jets fly above the stadium and checkpoints are
time-consuming. But complaints are few.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>In a nation at war, the 2002 Olympic Winter Games opened Friday as
a celebration of peace, one marked by extraordinarily tight security, a
heartfelt display of patriotism and the pageantry of a ceremony that
depicted the history and splendor of Utah and the American West.</LD>
<LD>   With F-16 fighter jets on alert in the skies above, 18 members of the
1980 men's U.S. hockey team lighted the Olympic caldron at the south end
of Rice-Eccles Stadium, providing a vivid reminder of perhaps the
greatest moment in the country's Winter Olympic history.</LD>
<LD>   "On behalf of a proud, determined and grateful nation, I declare open
the Games of Salt Lake City, celebrating the Winter Olympic Games,"
President Bush said, departing from the traditional Olympic declaration
to include a patriotic preface. Bush delivered the one-sentence address
surrounded by the U.S. team.</LD>
<TE>   Outside the stadium, security was predictably tight. But there were
few, if any, complaints, and many people said they were surprised by how
quickly they moved through the checkpoints.</TE>
<TE>   "It was amazing," said Debbie Saindon of Roseville, Calif. "I'd say it
took 10 minutes in total."</TE>
<TE>   The security ringing the stadium was merely the most visible feature
of the $310 million in funds directed to help secure these Games. An
estimated 10,000 police officers and soldiers stood guard at Olympic
venues in and around Salt Lake City, a force charged with guarding the
first mass gathering of nations since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on
the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "Your nation is overcoming a horrific tragedy," International Olympic
Committee Chairman Jacques Rogge told the audience. "A tragedy that has
affected the whole world. We stand united with you in the promotion of
our common ideals and hope for world peace."</TE>
<TE>   The weather, always a concern at the Winter Olympics, forced a
postponement of the first competition--ski jump qualifying in Park City
earlier Friday. But a low cloud cover that had glowered over the Olympic
stadium began to break up just before the opening ceremony, revealing a
colorful sunset and a spectacular view of the Wasatch Range immediately
to the east. The five Olympic rings could be seen burning white on the
side of the range. A short time later, a light snow began to fall, as if
on cue. The temperature was 19 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Just as noticeable as the security was the overwhelming, and largely
unscripted, outpouring of U.S. patriotism. Bush was greeted by a
deafening roar as he arrived in the stadium. U.S. athletes waved small
American flags as they marched in the parade of nations. The French team
waved double-sided flags--the French tricolor on one side, the Stars and
Stripes on the other. Plenty of spectators waved back.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time to come out and show your spirit," said Alex White, of
Daytona Beach, Fla., who attended the ceremony with a friend. Both showed
that spirit and then some, with red-white-and-blue stovepipe hats, white
curly wigs and flag-design bandannas and pins.</TE>
<TE>   The Olympics, of course, are intended to reflect more than mere
nationalism, a fact that always seems more poignant in a time of world
strife. And so the stadium erupted in cheers--and no audible boos--for
Iran, the only participant among the three nations identified by Bush as
among an "evil axis" supporting terrorism. Iraq and North Korea--the
other nations warned by Bush in his State of the Union address--did not
send teams, nor did Afghanistan, which was banned by the IOC for
refusing, under its former Taliban regime, to allow women to compete.</TE>
<TE>   A joyous mood permeated the ceremony, especially during the stirring
parade of athletes into the stadium. Midway through the procession, the
French began doing the wave, and it quickly spread, nation by nation.
Even the Mormon Tabernacle Choir joined in.</TE>
<TE>   Once the athletes took their seats beneath the still-unlighted
caldron, the colors of their uniforms--the white and red of the German
team, the icy blue of Finland, the white and brown coats of the
Russians--formed a peaceful patchwork quilt on the south end of the
stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to overstate what the Olympics can do," said Mitt
Romney, who took over as president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee
three years ago at the height of the worst corruption scandal in Olympic
history, "but at a time like this, maybe more than any time in our
history, this gathering at this time has powerful symbolism that is not
lost on America or the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Following Sept. 11," he said, "there were some people who wondered if
these Games could be pulled off. Now they seem more important than ever.
They can be a source of healing, not only for our nation but for the
world."</TE>
<TE>   An emotional high point of Friday night's ceremony was the appearance
of a tattered flag recovered from the wreckage of the World Trade Center.
A hush fell over the stadium as the flag was gingerly carried in by an
honor guard of U.S. athletes and New York police and firefighters. It was
bathed in light as the Utah Symphony and Mormon Tabernacle Choir
performed a majestic rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner"; then, as
the last strains of the anthem sounded, a spotlight flashed on another
U.S. flag, which was hoisted up a flagpole to the cheers of the more than
55,000 people in attendance.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 3 billion more people around the world watched the
ceremony on television.</TE>
<TE>   "It was emotional, it was very, very emotional," said Lt. John
Dougherty, a veteran of 38 years with the New York Fire Department, who
watched the broadcast with fellow firefighters between alarms at Engine
Co. 44 in Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the ceremony was a colorful pageant of Western
history, with musical homage to Native Americans, Western wildlife,
Utah's settlers and the completion of the transcontinental railroad at
Promontory Point, Utah. One hundred drummers representing Utah's five
major Indian tribes laid down a beat for ceremonial Native American
dances, and the Dixie Chicks played for a pioneer hoedown on skates.
Their rendition of "She'll Be Comin' 'Round the Mountain" had the Dutch
and U.S. athletes dancing in their seats.</TE>
<TE>   After that raucous interlude, the ceremony turned more solemn with the
entrance of the Olympic flag, carried by a color guard featuring two
Nobel Peace Prize winners: Bishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa and former
Polish labor leader and President Lech Walesa.</TE>
<TE>   The others included former astronaut and U.S. Sen. John Glenn, ski
jumper Kazuyoshi Funaki of Japan, runner Cathy Freeman of Australia,
French skiing legend Jean-Claude Killy, U.S. film director Steven
Spielberg and oceanologist Jean-Michel Cousteau.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the torch lighting, the final peak in an emotional evening
that had seen the audience erupt at the sight of U.S. athletes with
chants of "USA! USA!" That was the chant first heard around the world in
1980, when the U.S. hockey team beat a heavily favored Soviet squad at
the Lake Placid, N.Y., Olympics, the last Winter Games held in the U.S.
And it was heard again as the "Miracle on Ice" squad returned to light
the torch and stoke the patriotic fervor already burning in Salt Lake
City.</TE>
<TE>   More than 2,500 athletes from 77 countries are scheduled to compete in
the Games, which run through Feb. 24. There will be 78 events in seven
sports; 34 of the 78 are women's events.</TE>
<TE>   The 211-member U.S. team stands poised to record its best showing at a
Winter Olympics, with the possibility of winning at least 20 medals. Its
current best is 13 medals, won at the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan,
and at the 1994 Games in Lillehammer, Norway.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans were led into the stadium by flag-bearer Amy Peterson, a
short-track speedskater.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Olympic Committee has poured millions of dollars in recent
years into developing its winter sports programs, and, Romney said, after
meeting Friday afternoon with the U.S. team, "they are pumped."</TE>
<TE>   He then went on to distill the magic and heartbreak that always seem
to mark the athletic competition at the Games: "They've been preparing
for this moment for four years and in some cases it will last less than a
minute."</TE>
<TE>   These Games arrive after a recent history marked by controversy and
fear--in particular, the Salt Lake City bid scandal and then, in the
aftermath of Sept. 11, security worries.</TE>
<TE>   At stake may be nothing less than the future direction of the Olympic
movement, particularly in this country. These will be the last Olympics
in the United States for at least 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Rogge acknowledged that the stakes are high. In an interview last
week, he said the Games "are important for Olympism in this country."</TE>
<TE>   USOC officials have made it plain that the success of future U.S. bids
for the Games may hinge on the success of the Salt Lake City Olympics.
Four U.S. cities are vying for the 2012 Summer Games: New York,
Washington, San Francisco and Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Salt Lake City has been preparing for this moment since June 1995,
when it won the right to the these Games.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, the Olympic movement worldwide was still reveling in the
success in the United States of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, and
anticipation was building toward the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   The 1996 Games are now remembered, however, for a carnival-like
atmosphere that sparked IOC complaints of commercial excess, for
transportation and technology woes and, perhaps most of all, for a bomb
that exploded in a downtown Atlanta park, killing one person and injuring
more than 100.</TE>
<TE>   The 1998 Nagano Winter Games were plagued by bad weather. Also,
because of the time zone differences, much of the U.S. knew what had
happened at the Games before the action was shown on prime-time
television.</TE>
<TE>   In Sydney, Australia, 17 months ago, the time-zone problem again was
evident. Plus, NBC, which holds the exclusive rights to broadcast the
Games in the United States from 2000 through 2008, chose to show
virtually the entire Summer Olympics on tape delay.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, in late 1998, in the months between the Nagano and Sydney
Olympics, the bid scandal erupted here in Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal centered on revelations that bidders had wooed IOC members
or their relatives with more than $1 million in cash, gifts and other
inducements.</TE>
<TE>   Ten IOC members were expelled or resigned. The IOC in late 1999 passed
a 50-point reform plan that included a ban on visits to cities bidding
for the Games.</TE>
<TE>   The two leaders of the bid, Tom Welch and Dave Johnson, were indicted
in July 2000 on federal fraud and other charges. A U.S. district judge
dismissed the case in November, but only days ago prosecutors filed an
appeal--thereby assuring that the scandal would stay in the spotlight for
the duration of these Games and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   As for security, a thorough review was undertaken after Sept. 11. The
$310 million devoted to security is far and away a record for a U.S.
Games.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, the federal government's share of security funding for
the Winter Games at Lake Placid, N.Y., in 1980 was $23 million, according
to the General Accounting Office. Salt Lake City's share is more than 10
times that.</TE>
<TE>   Bill and Pam Skinner, attending the opening ceremony from nearby Park
City, said they weren't worried.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of people that live here that are staying away
because they are afraid," Bill Skinner said. "We don't want to do that.
That means [the terrorists] win."</TE>

<HD>Two Herbal Supplements Recalled Amid Rising Regulatory Concerns</HD>
<DH>Health: One is a popular treatment for prostate cancer that has
shown promise in testing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RAY HERNDON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The manufacturer of a promising and widely used herbal treatment
for prostate cancer told consumers Friday to stop taking the product
after California authorities determined it was contaminated with
potentially harmful prescription drugs.</LD>
<LD>   State health officials asked BotanicLab Inc. of Brea to recall PC
SPES, the prostate cancer treatment, and another supplement, SPES, after
finding they contained elements of the anxiety drug Xanax and the
blood-thinning drug Coumadin. Both drugs are supposed to be taken under
the supervision of a physician.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, the company posted a letter on its Web site asking
consumers and distributors to return all unused PC SPES pills in their
original containers for a refund. The letter did not mention SPES.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced it was
launching an investigation based on California authorities' findings.</TE>
<TE>   PC SPES, taken by at least 10,000 American men, is one of the few
herbal supplements to demonstrate substantial therapeutic effects.
Studies on its positive effects have been published in respected medical
journals and demand for the compound, whose effectiveness is still being
studied, has grown dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   The contamination underscores ongoing concern about the lack of
regulation for supplements--particularly of manufacturing standards.</TE>
<TE>   PC SPES appears to reduce the growth of prostate tumors. SPES is
marketed as a supplement that can help boost the immune system. But
little is known about the compounds they contain and how they work. The
PC SPES ingredients are reishi, Baikal skullcap, rabdosia, dyer's woad,
mum, saw palmetto, San-Qui ginseng and Chinese licorice.</TE>
<TE>   The state Department of Health Services announced Friday that its
investigators, in tests of product samples at a Sacramento laboratory,
had found warfarin in PC SPES, and alprazolam in SPES. Warfarin is
marketed under the trade name Coumadin and alprazolam under the trade
name Xanax.</TE>
<TE>   Independently, researchers at UC San Francisco's medical school
confirmed to The Times that they had tested four different lots of PC
SPES and found that all contained yet a third contaminant,
diethylstilbestrol, or DES, a hormone that was once used to prevent
miscarriages but later was banned when it was shown to cause birth
defects in children and blood clots and other side effects among men.</TE>
<TE>1994 Law Limited FDA's Authority</TE>
<TE>   PC SPES, which had shown success in treating men whose prostate cancer
did not respond to conventional therapies, had been undergoing clinical
trial at UC San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   But Ray Wilson, a scientist with the state health department, said the
trial was abruptly halted recently by Dr. Eric J. Small, who was heading
the study, because of concerns about DES contamination.</TE>
<TE>   The recall comes as concern is mounting among medical experts
nationally over the lack of regulation of herbal supplements. Herbal
remedies are classified as food supplements and, unlike prescription
drugs, are not subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA once had authority to regulate dietary supplements and in 1989
did act swiftly to recall one such substance--L-tryptophan--which was
ultimately linked to 37 deaths. But under a 1994 law, the supplement
manufacturers were made responsible for ensuring the safety of a product
and the accuracy of the labeling.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials can still intervene in the case of fraudulent
marketing claims. And the FDA is required under the 1994 law to issue
"good manufacturing practices" guidelines for the makers of supplements,
although it has yet to do so.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, FDA officials warned consumers that the supplements PC SPES
and SPES may pose serious health risks and are under investigation by the
agency.</TE>
<TE>   "In this case, the agency's warning is due to the finding of the
California state government that the ingredients in [the supplements]
posed serious health risks," FDA spokesman Jason Brodsky said. "We
certainly are supportive of the company's decision to recall the
products."</TE>
<TE>   Brodsky declined to comment on the nature or scope of the FDA
investigation, citing agency policy.</TE>
<TE>   FDA officials said they are unaware of any consumer complaints of
adverse reactions to the supplements. However, Brodsky cited a recent
report in the New England Journal of Medicine about a serious reaction to
PC SPES.</TE>
<TE>D.A. Fielded Complaints of PC SPES Side Effects</TE>
<TE>   BotanicLab has not been shy about marketing PC SPEC, but the company
has avoided media scrutiny and typically has refused requests by the
media to speak to its scientists.</TE>
<TE>   Although the state health department and FDA Web sites said both PC
SPES and SPES were being recalled, the recall notice posted on
BotanicLab's Web site made no mention of the SPES recall.</TE>
<TE>   No one at BotanicLab, a privately held company founded by
patent-holder Sophie Chen, could be reached for comment Friday evening.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to customers, president John Chen said the company
believes "further testing [of PC SPES] is necessary to confirm the
material at issue is warfarin." The letter said that the company was
nonetheless recalling the product to be prudent.</TE>
<TE>   "As we implement a new quality control process, further shipments of
PC SPES may not be immediately available," the letter said.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, the state health department scientist, said state
investigators visited BotanicLabs' Brea facility after receiving a report
from a Southern California district attorney who had been fielding
complaints of adverse effects from constituents who had taken PC SPES.</TE>
<TE>   He said the reactions reported were consistent with those experienced
by men who have been exposed to an estrogen product--swollen breasts,
tender nipples, erectile dysfunction and a lowered sex drive.</TE>
<TE>   Lea Brooks, a spokeswoman for the state health department, said
officials there keep tabs on Web sites and chat rooms where dietary
supplements are discussed. Officials became aware of persistent reports
of DES contamination through consumers who had ordered laboratory tests
and reported the results on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "We went looking for DES in PC SPES, and we didn't find it," he said,
explaining that the state's tests may not have been sufficiently
sensitive to detect the small quantities--3% or less--that UCSF detected.</TE>
<TE>Study Discovered Taint--and Benefit</TE>
<TE>   The discovery of Xanax in SPES came by accident. Wilson said the
department did not originally intended to test SPES but took samples
along with PC SPES to the lab. Xanax was detected when the product was
given a conventional test for prescription drugs.</TE>
<TE>   The state also detected warfarin, or Coumadin, in PC SPES. Although
BotanicLab officials suggested that the warfarin may have been naturally
present in some of the herbs it uses, Wilson said state scientists were
confident that it was a synthetic version of the drug.</TE>
<TE>   The state health department and the manufacturer recommended that
users of the supplements immediately halt their use. However, medical
experts said this could lead to complications for the users of SPES,
since drugs like Xanax are somewhat addictive and abruptly ending their
use could result in withdrawal symptoms if usage had been heavy and
prolonged. Because dietary supplements are generally not taken under the
supervision of a doctor, doses and duration of use are often not
carefully controlled.</TE>
<TE>   A research assistant for UCSF researcher Small confirmed Friday that
letters had recently been sent to study participants advising them that
small amounts of DES had been discovered in the pills they were being
given.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of ongoing concerns about the contents of PC SPES, we
recently decided to test each of the lots provided to us for the study by
BotanicLab. We tested samples from all four lots used in the study. The
laboratory tests revealed that each of the lots tested had small amounts
of DES present," the letter states.</TE>
<TE>   The letter did have some good news for the cancer patients enrolled in
the study: Preliminary data suggest that 45% of patients treated
initially with PC SPES have had a 50% or greater reduction in their
prostate-specific antigen levels, considered a marker for prostate
cancer.</TE>

<TE>About PC SPES</TE>
<TE>   * PC SPES is a centuries-old herbal remedy, a blend of eight herbs,
that has shown striking results in treating patients with advanced
prostate cancer.</TE>
<TE>   * It is made by Brea-based BotanicLab and sold over the counter in
capsule form.</TE>
<TE>   * As of last year, it was used by an estimated 10,000 men and appears
to reduce the signs of tumor growth in patients who have exhausted
conventional treatments, including hormone therapy.</TE>
<TE>   * It carries the risk of serious side effects, including breast
tenderness and enlargement because of herbs that act like estrogen.</TE>
<TE>   * As an over-the-counter supplement, it is not regulated by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration, although manufacturers are barred from
claiming it cures disease.</TE>
<TE>   * Federal and state health officials and the manufacturer urged
patients to stop taking the drug Friday after it was found to contain the
prescription drug warfarin, a blood-clotting agent marketed as Coumadin.</TE>

<CX>   Supplement recall--A story on recalls of the dietary supplements PC
SPES and SPES in Saturday's Section A incorrectly stated that dietary
supplements are not subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration. In fact, they are regulated, though more loosely than
prescription drugs. An accompanying graphic mischaracterized the effects
of Coumadin, also known as warfarin. It is a blood-thinning, not
blood-clotting, agent.</CX>

<HD>U.N. Abandons Khmer Rouge Tribunal Talks</HD>
<DH>Asia: World body says Cambodian court would not be impartial. U.S.
opposes the move.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>The United Nations unexpectedly announced Friday that it is ending
its long quest to try former leaders of Cambodia's notorious Khmer Rouge
regime on charges of genocide, blaming the decision on Cambodia's refusal
to permit prosecutions under international rather than its own laws.</LD>
<LD>   The move was immediately criticized by the United States, which
strongly backed the 4 1/2-year effort to set up a special tribunal. It
urged the U.N. to resume talks with Cambodian officials.</LD>
<LD>   "The tribunal is important to help resolve many of the issues that
remain in Cambodia," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said. "We
would hope that they would continue discussions."</LD>
<TE>   France also called for continued consultations, with a diplomat here
saying that "the path of dialogue between the United Nations and Cambodia
should remain open."</TE>
<TE>   The Khmer Rouge is widely held responsible for the slayings of a
million or more Cambodians from 1975 to 1979, and the U.N. agreed in 1997
to help Cambodia prosecute former leaders of the regime for genocide and
crimes against humanity. But in August 2001, Cambodia passed a law
decreeing that all such trials would be held under national rather than
international law.</TE>
<TE>   Hans Corell, the U.N.'s chief legal advisor, told the Cambodian
government in a letter Friday that the world body was "ending
negotiations" over the establishment of the special tribunal. The U.N.
contended in a statement that "the court as planned would not be fair"
and said that Cambodia had rejected its proposals for financial and legal
assistance for the prosecutions.</TE>
<TE>   "As currently envisaged," the U.N. said, "the Cambodian court would
not guarantee independence, impartiality and objectivity, which was a
prerequisite for the U.N.'s cooperation with such a court."</TE>
<TE>   Corell told reporters Friday that the U.N. "cannot be bound by a
national law" and had concluded "with regret" that further negotiations
with Cambodia would be fruitless.</TE>
<TE>   Some human rights advocates agreed, saying Cambodia has deliberately
obstructed U.N. attempts to have some international oversight at the
proposed trials and that its own judiciary is too compromised and
inexperienced to secure impartial prosecutions of Khmer Rouge captives.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.N. had no choice," said Mike Jendrzejczyk, an Asia expert at
Human Rights Watch. "We feel it is important for the U.N. to insist that
international standards be fully met if the U.N. is to be part of any
tribunal for the Khmer Rouge."</TE>
<TE>   U.N. Security Council members said they were informed of the decision
shortly before it was publicly announced. The decision was ordered by
Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary-general, who was in Utah on Friday
attending the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics, Corell said.</TE>
<TE>   "We were very surprised and would urge Mr. Corell to continue
discussions with the government of Cambodia," said a U.S. official in New
York who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Cambodian mission to the U.N. said Cambodian
diplomats were not available to comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Pol Pot, the notorious leader of the Khmer Rouge, died in the
Cambodian jungle in 1998. Cambodia granted amnesty to some senior Khmer
Rouge officials, including Pol Pot's former foreign minister, Ieng Sary.
But many other former Khmer Rouge officials remain at large.</TE>
<TE>   Frustration over the slow-moving negotiations with Cambodia had become
increasingly evident in recent months as U.N. officials publicly rebutted
Cambodian claims that the world body had failed to provide requested
legal assistance in the drafting of legislation for the proposed
tribunal. Corell had repeatedly postponed a long-planned trip to Cambodia
because of what U.N. officials described as Cambodian obstructionism.</TE>
<TE>   According to the U.N., Corell received a copy of Cambodia's
legislation after it became law at the end of August and returned it with
a detailed critique in mid-October. The U.N. said it never received a
promised Cambodian response to Corell's submission, despite a continuing
exchange of correspondence on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Corell said Friday that a Cambodian Cabinet minister, Sok An, recently
told him that Cambodia would not modify its laws as the U.N. had
suggested.</TE>
<TE>   "The ultimate issue is that unless the whole concept of these
extraordinary chambers is governed by an agreement between the United
Nations and the government, the United Nations cannot enter into this
because it will leave the field open to the government in Cambodia to
make whatever changes they see fit in the future," Corell said.</TE>

<HD>Venezuelans Are Divided Over Chavez</HD>
<DH>Politics: The nation remains tense as pressure mounts on the
populist leader to quit. The elite are hampering his efforts to help the
poor, he says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela
</DL>
<LD>President Hugo Chavez on Friday faced his most serious challenge
since coming to power, after a week of tumultuous protests that spurred
calls for his removal from civic leaders, military officials and ordinary
folks.</LD>
<LD>   Coup rumors have surged, and blood-red graffiti calling for Chavez's
death have popped up on the sides of major highways. The mayor of Caracas
even asked the Roman Catholic Church to conduct an exorcism of the former
coup leader.</LD>
<LD>   "He has demons in his body and is making a hell of everything," said
Alfredo Pena, the Caracas leader who has emerged as Chavez's most
strident, and colorful, critic. He added: "The street is going to take
Chavez out. He is an autocrat."</LD>
<TE>   A populist who has seen his popularity plummet in recent months,
Chavez has responded to the unrest by launching sharp rhetorical attacks
against his opponents that have deeply divided the country.</TE>
<TE>   As his support dropped from a high of 92% after he took office in 1999
to about 35% in December, the former military paratrooper blamed his
declining appeal on "the squalid ones"--Venezuela's wealthy elite.</TE>
<TE>'The True Poll Is in the Streets'</TE>
<TE>   In fiery, four-hour speeches, he has told impoverished supporters
bused in from hamlets and cities around the country that the rich, the
church, business and the media have become obstacles to his attempts to
make life better for the poor.</TE>
<TE>   "Some sectors are trying to create the idea that Chavez is done, that
the revolution of Chavez is in the ground, that there's a great
collective frustration and now people are ready to take out Chavez," he
said at a news conference this week. "The true poll is in the streets."</TE>
<TE>   The great clash of social and political forces that began last year
has rent Venezuelan society, creating two camps: those for Chavez and
those against him.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez, who has five years remaining in his term, still clearly
retains the support of many of Venezuela's poorest people, who see him as
a paladin fighting corruption that stems from 40 years of power-sharing
between Venezuela's two major political parties.</TE>
<TE>   But the opposition, while fueled by the wealthy and middle class, also
contains a significant number of the poor, who find themselves without
work, opportunity or hope three years after Chavez took power.</TE>
<TE>   The vehemence and frequency of the protests have raised worries about
the stability of Venezuela, the third-largest supplier of oil to the
United States.</TE>
<TE>'A Case Study in Political Suicide'</TE>
<TE>   CIA Director George J. Tenet expressed worry over the country's future
in testimony to Congress this week. And Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell reiterated long-held criticism about Chavez's penchant for
visiting controversial foreign leaders such as Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "He is becoming more and more isolated, both domestically and
internationally," said Anibal Romero, a political analyst who has urged
civil groups to peacefully force Chavez's resignation. "He is secluded in
his bunker, surrounded by sycophants.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are seeing is a case study in political suicide," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez's popularity began to slip in July, mirroring a decline in oil
prices. The weakness in oil, long the backbone of Venezuela's economy,
spooked both the rich and the poor, who count on petroleum tax revenue to
fund government programs.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an oil country. If the price of oil becomes unstable, so does
the political system," said Luis Vicente Leon, director of Datanalisis,
one of the country's leading polling firms.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition sharply increased last fall after Chavez took the first
steps to realize his left-leaning "revolution." Chavez, a fan of Cuban
President Fidel Castro, China's Mao Tse-tung and leftist revolutionary
Che Guevara, is seeking to create a still ill-defined political system
somewhere between socialism and free-market capitalism.</TE>
<TE>   He enacted two controversial laws with special powers granted to him
by the unicameral National Assembly, which is controlled by his political
party, the Fifth Republic Movement.</TE>
<TE>   One law provided for greater state control of oil contracts. The
second, a land reform law, allowed the government to use powers of
eminent domain to seize unproductive land for redistribution to the poor.</TE>
<TE>   In December, union and business leaders joined forces in a one-day
strike that paralyzed much of the country. In January, opposition forces
gathered for a massive march. That protest was answered with a
counterdemonstration by Chavez supporters the same day, filling Caracas'
streets.</TE>
<TE>A Parade to Mark a Failed Coup</TE>
<TE>   The discontent seemed to come to a head this week as popular disgust
grew over Chavez's four-day tour through Venezuela to celebrate the
failed coup he led 10 years ago as a lieutenant colonel in the Venezuelan
army. Seventeen people died during the insurrection, including several
civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Donning a red military beret, Chavez triumphantly arrived in Caracas,
the capital, on Monday to commemorate the anniversary as a national
holiday.</TE>
<TE>   "The people have regained their happiness--it shines in all parts, in
their smiles, everywhere. They have optimism. That didn't exist 10 years
ago, before Feb. 4," Chavez said, explaining that the coup was the
beginning of his "Bolivarian" revolution, named for legendary South
American liberator Simon Bolivar, a Chavez favorite.</TE>
<TE>   But the celebration turned out to be another divisive stroke.
Politicians were puzzled by a parade for a violent overthrow, no matter
how corrupt the government. Military officials accompanying Chavez as he
toured the country seemed slightly uncomfortable as the president paid
homage to fallen fellow rebels.</TE>
<TE>   In upscale eastern Caracas, a few thousand protesters gathered Monday
in a tony park square surrounded by art galleries, gourmet restaurants
and a Four Seasons hotel with $300-a-night rooms.</TE>
<TE>   There, men and women in designer clothes and gold jewelry wore all
black as a sign of mourning for those who had died in the coup and in a
second, bloodier coup a few months later that Chavez allegedly helped
support from his jail cell.</TE>
<TE>   They beat pots and pans. Sport-utility vehicles and Mercedes-Benzes
passed, horns honking, in a show of solidarity. Opposition members
switched off the lights of their homes, casting darkness over parts of
the city.</TE>
<TE>   "He has done a lot of damage to this country. It's worse than before,"
said Teresa Briceno, 45, who works in an art museum. One of her friends
wore a headband that proclaimed, "I'm a squalid one!"</TE>
<TE>   A few miles away, in Caracas' filthy center, a far larger
demonstration took place as Chavez backers flooded narrow streets in
front of Miraflores, the presidential palace, to show their support for
their beleaguered leader.</TE>
<TE>   Most had come by bus, many from small towns and villages hours away,
brought by leaders of the Fifth Republic Movement. Racks of meat roasted
on street corners, prostitutes gathered outside motels to watch, and
fireworks flared above.</TE>
<TE>   Crammed shoulder to shoulder, the crowd, dressed mostly in red, paid
rapt attention to Chavez during a two-hour address, than joined him in
singing the national anthem.</TE>
<TE>   "We are here to defend the revolution," said Luis Fernando Rosales, a
29-year-old phone company worker. 'There's a conspiracy against us."</TE>
<TE>   In the days that followed, airwaves and newspapers were filled with
plans for a massive, weeklong general strike at the end of the month.
Chavez supporters blamed the country's wealthy elite for fomenting
discord, saying they were threatened by Chavez's reforms.</TE>
<TE>   "We are implementing changes to this country. That is going to cause
clashes with the ruling elite," said Tarek William Saab, president of the
National Assembly's international relations committee.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation about military discontent peaked Thursday, when Col. Pedro
Vicente Soto, an air force officer, rose during a media forum to call for
Chavez's resignation, claiming that his views were shared by 75% of the
military.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving the forum, military police attempted to stop Soto as he
drove along Caracas' major freeway. But motorists stopped and surrounded
the police, preventing them from taking Soto.</TE>
<TE>   Soto then led an impromptu protest rally, again calling on Chavez to
step down. He led a march to Chavez's home, where he was joined by a
second officer from the president's personal bodyguard.</TE>
<TE>   "The president must go! What we are facing is a tyrant!" Soto
screamed.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez convened a Cabinet meeting Friday to discuss Soto's actions,
even as top aides maintained the military was under control. They called
Soto a lone wolf and traitor, motivated by his being passed over for
promotion to general.</TE>
<TE>   Soto called for other military officers to join his protest, but there
were no signs Friday that his call was heeded. Indeed, there were signs
of normality as legions of vacationers took off for celebrations this
weekend to mark the beginning of Lent.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the country remained tense. With neither Chavez opponents nor
supporters offering to back down, there seemed no easy way out of the
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "The exit is not clear," said Miguel Otero, director of El Nacional,
one of the country's leading newspapers and a Chavez opponent. "There's
no road that everyone agrees to as the way to go."</TE>

<DH>Arsenal: Talks helped persuade the U.S. to free up more cash--as
much as $620 million--to help Moscow destroy its chemical weapons.</DH>

<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>A Russian official Friday praised a compromise with the Bush
administration that he said will mean as much as $620 million more from
the United States to help Russia dismantle its deadly chemical weapons
arsenal.</LD>
<LD>   Sergei V. Kiriyenko, President Vladimir V. Putin's special envoy for
chemical disarmament, said the agreement is crucial for both countries at
a time when the world has become more alert to the possibility of
chemical weapons' finding their way into the hands of terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   Kiriyenko answered written questions submitted by The Times one day
after returning from the United States and Canada, where he sought
renewed international help for the Russian program to destroy an
estimated 40,000 tons of chemical weapons.</LD>
<TE>   In 1997, Russia ratified the international Chemical Weapons Convention
and promised to destroy its arsenal by 2007. In response, the United
States pledged about $880 million to help the Russians, but it halted
funding last year after having delivered only about $260 million.</TE>
<TE>   The halt was ordered by Congress, which questioned Russia's
destruction efforts up to that point. Fears were also raised that Russia
might not have declared all of its chemical weapons stockpiles.</TE>
<TE>   Kiriyenko visited the United States to discuss those concerns, and
after the meetings last week, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said
Russia had done enough to warrant the release of the next $50 million in
aid for the disarmament effort.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important thing is that we have reached a political solution
of the problem, the absence of which had been the main stumbling block,"
said Kiriyenko, a former Russian prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   Kiriyenko acknowledged that Washington needed to be convinced that
Russia was doing its share in the chemical disarmament field. He said
that in his talks with Powell and National Security Advisor Condoleezza
Rice, he was able to show that Russia is serious and moving forward.</TE>
<TE>   "Russia got down to it and energetically got everything done," he said
of U.S. demands. "In 2001, the budget financing of the [disarmament]
program was increased sixfold, and in 2002, it is being doubled again. In
addition, the chemical weapons destruction process has been moved from
the Defense Ministry to a civilian agency, the Russian Agency for
Munitions."</TE>
<TE>   Kiriyenko said that as of November, Russia had destroyed Category 3
chemical weapons--the least dangerous--ahead of schedule and that by
March, it will have destroyed Category 2 weapons, also ahead of a
previously agreed upon timetable.</TE>
<TE>   The government hopes to complete its first plant for destroying
Category 1 weapons, the most lethal, this year at Gorny in south-central
Russia, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kiriyenko said that Russia will receive a delegation of U.S. experts
Feb. 26 and that the visit will launch a process of consultations meant
to clear up any lingering U.S. doubts. During these consultations, he
said, the Bush administration will ask Congress to unfreeze the $50
million.</TE>
<TE>   Russia has admitted that, overall, its weapons destruction program is
far behind schedule and that it has no chance of meeting the 2007 target
for elimination of its entire chemical arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   More U.S. money, however, would allow it to proceed with the building
of the biggest destruction facility planned, at Shchuchye in western
Siberia. The site houses 14% of Russia's stockpile, including about 2
million chemical artillery shells and several thousand nerve gas rockets.</TE>
<TE>   "Russia and the United States have a common view on the struggle
against international terrorism, and unless all chemical weapons are
destroyed, these weapons might theoretically get into the hands of
terrorists," Kiriyenko said. "That is why the destruction of all
stockpiles is a priority for both countries."</TE>
<TE>   Lev Fyodorov, an ecology activist and president of the Union for
Chemical Security, a Russian environmental group, said that the
U.S.-Russian accords do not cover t120,000 tons of more primitive World
War II-era mustard gases and other substances that are no longer usable
as weapons but are presumably hidden or buried somewhere in Russia.</TE>
<TE>   "Wherever they are, they still pose a huge ecological danger for
Russia," Fyodorov said.</TE>

<HD>Reports of Priests' Abuse Enrage Boston Catholics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>Among Catholics here, the floodgates of rage and disappointment
poured open this week.</LD>
<LD>   On radio talk shows, in chatter at convenience stores and in emergency
"listening sessions" convened hastily by the Archdiocese of Boston, the
faithful vented anger and frustration over daily disclosures that scores
of pedophile priests worked in the region with the full knowledge of
church officials.</LD>
<LD>   As the number of implicated clergy members soared to 80, the crisis
grew so deep that nearly half the Roman Catholics polled said Cardinal
Bernard Law should resign.</LD>
<TE>   The turmoil over what church officials knew, when they knew it and
what they did or did not do to protect themselves and their parishioners
has rocked a region that is more than 50% Catholic.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our Sept. 11," Boston College professor Thomas H. Groome said
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   By week's end, the archdiocese had given law enforcement authorities
the names of at least 80 priests accused of sexual misconduct with minors
over the last 20 or more years.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese also announced Thursday that six more priests had been
suspended. Earlier in the week, the archdiocese relieved two other
priests of duties, also following accusations that they had sexual
relations with children.</TE>
<TE>   Both actions came days after Law publicly insisted that all priests in
his jurisdiction who were suspected of sexually abusing children had been
removed from their duties.</TE>
<TE>   In the poll of 800 adults taken by the Boston Globe and WBZ-TV, 51% of
those surveyed were critical of the cardinal and how he has handled the
growing scandal. The displeasure was aimed specifically at Law, the
70-year-old archbishop of Boston. In the same poll, only 16% of
respondents had an unfavorable view of Pope John Paul II, and just 4% had
adverse opinions of their own parish priests.</TE>
<TE>   The survey found that 64% said church leaders care more about
protecting the accused priests than helping the victims.</TE>
<TE>   "I think for a long time people have known that the church has been
aware of these problems and has not acted expeditiously," said Lisa
Cahill, a professor of moral theology at Boston College, a Jesuit
institution.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of what's appalling," she continued, "is the extensiveness of
the problem, based just on the number of these priests that keep
surfacing in New England. Every day, you hear about six more cases."</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the archdiocese said it had settled so many child sexual
abuse claims against it that a multimillion-dollar insurance fund was
running dry.</TE>
<TE>   Scandals involving pedophile priests have hit parishes across
America--and indeed, around the world--in recent decades. Thousands of
adults have come forward to say they were abused as children and many
priests have been sent to jail.</TE>
<TE>   At first, accusations against Father James Geoghan seemed no
different. The 66-year-old defrocked priest was charged in three separate
criminal sexual abuse cases dating from the 1980s and 1990s. More than
130 people have claimed they were fondled or molested by Geoghan, who
also is a defendant in 84 civil lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   But in the course of the Geoghan investigation, Law was forced to tell
prosecutors that the priest's pattern of pedophilia was no secret in the
local Catholic hierarchy.</TE>
<TE>   Law abruptly promised to supply law enforcement agencies with names of
priests suspected of such behavior. He organized a panel including
medical experts to look into sexual abuse within the church. The cardinal
also appealed for public understanding, urging Catholics to pray for him
as he faced this difficult situation.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 25, he vowed, "There is no priest, or former priest, working
in this archdiocese in any assignment whom we know to have been
responsible for sexual abuse."</TE>
<TE>   Days later, he removed two more priests for alleged child molestation.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese did not respond to requests Friday for an interview
with the cardinal. However, after returning from the Vatican, Law told
local reporters at Logan International Airport: "Our intent is to do
everything we possibly can to ensure the protection of children."</TE>
<TE>   Around the archdiocese, the scope of the scandal--and its growing
momentum--continued to shock Catholics, who expressed grief, outrage and,
most of all, a sense of betrayal.</TE>
<TE>   "You have an organization that is based on faith, and part of that
faith derives from your confidence in the institution that houses that
faith," said Paul Nace, a real estate developer in Newton who was raised
Catholic.</TE>
<TE>   "When events happen that call into question that institution, at a
very basic and moral level it also calls into question your faith," Nace
said.</TE>
<TE>   As horrific as the spiraling number of clergy sexual abuse cases might
be, "the most disturbing part is that it appears that decisions were made
to protect the institution at the expense of the victims," Nace said.
"You've got a head-on, loggerhead collision with everything that
institution is supposed to stand for."</TE>
<TE>   Groome, a former priest and author of a new book called "What Makes Us
Catholic," said that to Catholics, the church represents a vastly more
important institution than in some other denominations.</TE>
<TE>   "We have obviously exaggerated the importance of the institution," he
said. "Everybody has a priesthood, and everybody invests in their
priesthood, but nobody in the Western world has invested in their
priesthood the way Catholics have. This is why all of this is so
desperately shattering."</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell Garabedian, an attorney representing 84 plaintiffs in civil
suits against Geoghan, said his clients have had their faith ravaged by
their experiences.</TE>
<TE>   "They cannot seek spiritual relief anywhere because of what has
happened to them," Garabedian said. "The very entity they want to turn to
has in a sense helped them to be molested. It is mind-boggling."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the claims he has looked into involving the Boston archdiocese
date back more than 40 years, Garabedian said. Far from surprised that so
many names of alleged predator priests have been put forward by the
church, "I'd be surprised if more names were not revealed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a serious problem within the Archdiocese of Boston,"
Garabedian went on. "For decades they have been imprisoned by pedophiles
and shackled by their own denial."</TE>
<TE>   The troubles at the archdiocese took a new turn late in the week when
a family in which both a father and son were abused by priests filed a
suit against Cardinal Law. The latest legal action--the first directed at
the cardinal himself--claims Law "intentionally" and "recklessly"
inflicted emotional damage on Thomas and Christopher Fulchino by
knowingly assigning a pedophile priest to their parish.</TE>
<TE>   Law, archbishop of Boston since 1984, is the senior Roman Catholic
prelate in America. Twice this year he has declared that he will not step
down.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not believe that submitting my resignation to the Holy Father is
the answer to the terrible scourge of sexual abuse of children by
priests," he wrote in a Jan. 26 letter to area Catholics.</TE>
<TE>   The poll found that church attendance has not declined significantly
because of the scandal. But 1 in 5 Catholics said they were contributing
less money to the church as a result of the controversy.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese-wide survey was taken Monday through Wednesday and has
a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   Groome said "one of the reasons I like this church is it is full of
sinners and I feel at home. But you make a distinction between sin and
crime. The criminals you can't have in your chancery."</TE>
<TE>   As to whether the cardinal should resign, Groome said, "A month ago I
said no, he should ride it out, clean up the mess. I did think a month
ago he was capable of putting the thing back together. This morning, I am
not so sure."</TE>

<HD>Leader Vows to Improve the Lives of South Africans</HD>
<DH>Government: Mbeki's pledge on issues ranging from AIDS to upcoming
Zimbabwean vote lacks specifics, critics say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAPE TOWN, South Africa
</DL>
<LD>South African President Thabo Mbeki vowed Friday to intensify his
government's fight against the country's AIDS epidemic, restore land to
thousands of families evicted under apartheid, and work to ensure a fair
presidential election in neighboring Zimbabwe.</LD>
<LD>   In an hourlong "state of the nation" address to mark the reopening of
Parliament following its holiday recess, Mbeki promised concrete programs
that would help improve the lives of South Africans.</LD>
<LD>   "This year the government will work further to reduce the level of
poverty in our society, . . . to develop our greatest resource, our
people," said the president, a British-educated economist who won office
in 1999 in the country's second democratic election.</LD>
<TE>   But critics said Mbeki's speech missed a prime opportunity to give
specifics on how to come to grips with AIDS and unemployment and how to
temper a political crisis in Zimbabwe that could ultimately have dire
repercussions in South Africa.</TE>
<TE>A 'Missed Opportunity'</TE>
<TE>   "There was a business-as-usual approach to the major crises that need
to be addressed. I thought it was a massive missed opportunity," said
Tony Leon, leader of the opposition Democratic Alliance.</TE>
<TE>   Mbeki said his government would step up its campaign against HIV,
which infects about 10% of South Africa's 45 million people, by focusing
on prevention through lifestyle changes. He noted that work would
continue at 18 pilot sites to monitor the effectiveness of antiretroviral
drugs that medical experts say can help prevent the transmission of the
human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, from a mother to her
newborn.</TE>
<TE>   The president said the government had initiated discussions with some
pharmaceutical companies to "examine new ways of making drugs more
affordable and to strengthen our health infrastructure."</TE>
<TE>   However, the government has so far balked at the wide-scale
distribution of anti-AIDS drugs, citing safety and cost concerns. A
coalition of health lobby groups won a court order in December requiring
the government to offer antiretroviral medication to all who have HIV.
But the government is appealing the decision.</TE>
<TE>   Some observers expressed disappointment over the lack of a new
initiative on AIDS in Mbeki's speech and the refusal to acknowledge the
urgent need to deal with the epidemic.</TE>
<TE>   "AIDS is the biggest challenge, the major disaster facing this
country, and we would have wished for something more specific and
far-reaching," said Mangosuthu Buthelezi, a minister in Mbeki's coalition
Cabinet and leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party.</TE>
<TE>   "If he doesn't provide the kids [with anti-AIDS drugs] today, it means
that the classrooms he plans to build will not be occupied," said Bantu
Holomisa, president of the United Democratic Movement, an opposition
party. "If he doesn't provide these drugs today, the homes he says he is
going to build, nobody is going to occupy those homes."</TE>
<TE>   Trumpeting the strides South Africa has made since apartheid ended
with all-race elections in 1994, Mbeki said the government had built 1.2
million homes, redistributed more than 2.5 million acres of land to the
poor, and provided running water for 7 million people and electricity for
3.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   "During the past year, our country has, in real terms and within its
means, moved further forward toward a society free of poverty and
underdevelopment," Mbeki said.</TE>
<TE>   He promised that a program to restore land to thousands of black
families, dispossessed under apartheid, would be completed within three
years. The Commission on Restitution of Land Rights, established in 1996,
has about 69,000 land claims to deal with and has been widely criticized
for moving too slowly. Strapped for cash, it settled just 49 claims in
its first three years, although the pace has rapidly increased.</TE>
<TE>   Mbeki also promised tax cuts and increases in social welfare grants to
improve the lot of the country's underprivileged. But he did not mention
that at least 1 million jobs have been lost in the last five years,
critics pointed out.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't come out in the open as to how he is going to combat the
very high rate of unemployment," said Holomisa, the opposition
politician. "I would have expected him to announce some more programs for
the state to intervene in the economy."</TE>
<TE>   Mbeki also said South Africa would dispatch observers within a week to
monitor the presidential election in Zimbabwe.</TE>
<TE>   "In pursuit of stability in our region, we will work tirelessly to
support the people of Zimbabwe in their quest to hold free and fair
elections," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But critics spoke out against Mbeki's failure to take a tougher stance
on what they say is state-sponsored violence perpetuated by Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe--in office since the nation's independence from
Britain in 1980--against anyone who opposes him.</TE>
<TE>Too Soft on Zimbabwe?</TE>
<TE>   Zimbabwe-watchers say the scale of intimidation and preelection fraud
surrounding voter registration makes it impossible for the March 9-10
poll to be fair.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you get a legitimate election, or a legitimate government
elected, where the press is muzzled, where it is against the law to
criticize the president against whom there is much to criticize, and in a
situation where millions of Zimbabweans have been disenfranchised?" asked
Leon, the Democratic Alliance leader. "I don't think that spells out free
and fair elections. But [Mbeki] didn't actually say that the real crisis
there is a crisis of the denial of democracy by the very government which
is meant to uphold it."</TE>
<TE>   As the political and economic situation in Zimbabwe deteriorates,
observers warned of a ripple effect in South Africa if impoverished
Zimbabweans flood the neighboring country in search of food, jobs and
safety. Being too soft on Mugabe's government might also destroy Western
donor support for Mbeki's regional development initiatives, analysts
said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Mbeki said, to rapturous applause in Parliament, South Africa
would continue to challenge "the undeclared doctrine of collective
punishment against all Africans that seems to come into effect when one
or some among our leaders stumble."</TE>

<HD>3 Killed in and Near West Bank</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Two died in a botched attack, police say. Three soldiers
reportedly convicted of assault.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>An explosion killed at least two Palestinians in their car Friday
in what police said was a bomb attack gone awry in northern Israel, and
an Israeli woman was fatally stabbed by Palestinian teenagers in a
Jerusalem forest.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, sources said a military court had convicted three Israeli
soldiers of assaulting Palestinians, in the first such prosecution since
the uprising against Israeli occupation began in September 2000.</LD>
<LD>   One soldier received a 14-day jail term; another, 45 days. Both were
demoted and ordered to perform up to three months of menial labor.</LD>
<TE>   The military prosecutor has appealed the sentences, saying the
punishment was too lenient, the sources said. The third soldier is to be
sentenced next week.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers were accused of kicking and slapping Palestinians and
poking them with their rifle butts at a military checkpoint in the West
Bank, part of a crippling blockade Israel has imposed on Palestinian
areas.</TE>
<TE>   In Friday's blast, Israeli police said, two or possibly three
Palestinians were killed in a car on a road close to the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently the car's occupants planned to detonate the bomb in an
Israeli city, but it went off prematurely, police spokesman Yoram Zamir
said.</TE>
<TE>   The victim in the Jerusalem attack was stabbed several times as she
was strolling in the Peace Forest, which lies between Jewish and Arab
neighborhoods of the city.</TE>

decade lashed eastern Congo, three weeks after a volcanic eruption razed
much of the city of Goma, aid workers said.</LD>

under the rocks," said Constantin Magala-Baha, president of the Congolese
Red Cross branch in the town of Uvira.</LD>

<HD>Diary Delves Into Kidnapper's Odyssey Into 'Holy War'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI
</DL>
<LD>The chief suspect in the kidnapping of U.S. journalist Daniel Pearl
had a flair for writing himself and penned a long, revealing confession
after he was jailed for kidnapping an American tourist seven years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Police in Karachi, Pakistan, charged three men Friday in connection
with Pearl's disappearance. They are to appear in court Monday. But
Pakistani authorities suspect that it was Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh who
lured Pearl into a trap in Karachi on Jan. 23, and it was Sheikh who
confessed in writing to the 1994 abduction in India of California tourist
Bela Josef Nuss of Walnut Creek and three British backpackers.</LD>
<LD>   While a prisoner in New Delhi's Tihar jail, where Indian investigators
say he forged terrorist links with the Indian mafia, Sheikh wrote a
56-page diary in longhand.</LD>
<TE>   A copy of that journal was obtained Friday from Sheikh's court file,
along with statements from Nuss and Sheikh's other victims, who described
him as threatening at times but friendly at others. Sheikh once offered
to bring Nuss books and a journal to record his experiences in captivity,
"so that after my release, I would have something to think about," the
ex-hostage told Indian police.</TE>
<TE>   "He said I was their guest and they did not like what they were
doing," Nuss said in a six-page statement on Nov. 8, 1994. "He further
told me that they are not terrorists and that they were doing this
because the Indian army was doing terrible things in Kashmir."</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh's New Delhi lawyer, Vikas Bahwa, said his client's prison
journal was not a legal confession, but he confirmed that Sheikh wrote
the document, in which he describes his military training in Afghanistan,
and his kidnapping mission in India, in great detail.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a diary, probably, which he was keeping," the lawyer said.
Bahwa added that Sheikh "left in haste" and must have forgotten to take
the diary when he was released in December 1999 in return for the release
of passengers on a hijacked Indian Airlines flight.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh's prison diary is a window into the mind of an intelligent man
who grew up amid the privilege of Wanstead, east London, only to drop out
of the prestigious London School of Economics to join a Muslim "holy
war."</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh also provides brief biographies of what he calls his
"associates," including assessments of their personality flaws, aliases
and other identifying details, as if he had decided to turn informant. Or
perhaps he was sketching out a book.</TE>
<TE>   He identified the kidnapping operation's commander as Shah Saab and
named his three aliases, along with three militant groups to which he
belonged. Then Sheikh recalled his terrorist boss as "quite moody at
times. Very good at controlling people. Very particular about small
details."</TE>
<TE>   Another accomplice, identified as Siddique, was a veteran of the
Afghan war against Soviet occupiers in the 1980s. Sheikh described him as
a muscular man "with black piercing eyes" who wanted to work in a
pharmacy but ended up fighting Indian rule in Kashmir instead.</TE>
<TE>   He called Amin "an extra used for errands," whom Sheikh didn't like
"because he scolded me."</TE>
<TE>   Nuss, in a statement to police after he was freed in a shootout, said
Sheikh had tricked him into getting into a van, where he was abducted at
gunpoint on Oct. 20, 1994. Sheikh told Nuss that if he didn't cooperate
"they would not hesitate in blowing my head off."</TE>
<TE>   Then Sheikh said: "We want to get back at them. They are all the
enemy," according to Nuss' statement. Nuss said he told Sheikh that he
didn't "know the United States is involved."</TE>
<TE>   "The United States is involved in everything," Sheikh replied, and
"asked me to be quiet," Nuss told Indian police.</TE>
<TE>   Nuss' abductors tied his hands together with nylon string and covered
him with a black burka, the long, veiled shroud worn by some Muslim
women, especially in Pakistan and Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Nuss said that Sheikh, a Muslim, had introduced himself as Rohit
Sharma, a Hindu name, when he struck up a conversation as Nuss was eating
lunch in a New Delhi guest house on Oct. 18, 1994.</TE>
<TE>   When they met again two days later, about 6 p.m., Sheikh led Nuss to a
light blue minivan where two men were waiting. After a 15-minute drive,
the van stopped to pick up two men waiting at the roadside. One of them
grabbed Nuss tightly by both wrists while the other pointed a gun at him.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh told Nuss that he would be held for only two days, but the
captors chained his right ankle to a steel spike hammered into the
concrete floor of their hide-out and brought in a pan and bottle when he
had to relieve himself.</TE>
<TE>   Nuss wasn't freed until Oct. 31, 1994, after 11 days in captivity,
when Indian police stormed the hide-out. One of the kidnappers and a
police officer were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh was a top student in an English private school before he
studied mathematics and statistics at the London School of Economics in
October 1992. The following year, he left for Bosnia-Herzegovina, hoping
to join the "Convoy of Mercy" relief effort to aid Bosnian Muslims
besieged by Serbian and Croatian forces.</TE>
<TE>   In a two-page resume appended to his prison diary, Sheikh said he got
as far as the Croatian city of Split but was too sick to go into Bosnia
and chatted with moujahedeen fighters instead.</TE>
<TE>   They "recommend training in Afghanistan first," Sheikh wrote. He
returned to London to study for his exams in May, but he said he couldn't
"settle down," and the following month he left for Pakistan, the
birthplace of his parents.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh wasn't on a sentimental journey. He went straight to the Lahore
office of the Harkat Moujahedeen and joined the group headed by Fazlur
Rehman Khalil, who co-signed Osama bin Laden's February 1998 fatwa, or
religious edict, calling on Muslims to attack Americans.</TE>
<TE>   In August 1993, Sheikh traveled to Afghanistan, then fell ill after
two weeks there. He left to stay with relatives in Lahore but was back in
Afghanistan in September, eager to start his military training.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh signed up for "Junduba," which he called "a four-month course
given only to those dedicating their lives to jihad"--holy war--and was
"introduced to small arms and heavy arms."</TE>
<TE>   He was in a group of about 20 recruits. Their regular training was
interrupted from October to December 1993 when about 40 permanent members
of the Harkat Moujahedeen arrived "to introduce new things, such as
formations, raid and ambush tactics, rappelling, blasting, intelligence
tactics, field-work, survival, etc.," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   When Sheikh finished his training at the end of 1993, he asked to go
to Bosnia, but one of the militant group's leaders, Maulana Abdullah,
asked if he would go to India instead.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh said his passport was about to expire, so Abdullah suggested
that he stay on at the training camp as an instructor, according to
Sheikh's account. Instead, Sheikh returned to London to help recruit
jihad fighters.</TE>
<TE>   By May 1994, Sheikh was back in Afghanistan, and after a quick
refresher, became an instructor in the 40-day course on how to handle
light and heavy weapons. He called it a "very rewarding experience."</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah then asked him to go to India to kidnap foreigners in an
effort to win the release of jailed terrorists, such as Maulana Masood
Azhar, who was then a leader of Khalil's Harkat Ansar group. Indian
police had captured Azhar earlier in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh was arrested in India, and his hostages freed, before he could
spring Azhar or anyone else. But the two men finally went free in
December 1999 in the deal to save passengers on an Indian Airlines flight
that had been hijacked to Kandahar, Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   By Sheikh's account, he wasn't a very skilled kidnapper. At times, his
diary makes him sound like an innocent abroad, more naive tourist than
international terrorist.</TE>
<TE>   When he arrived in New Delhi on July 26, 1994, on a Pakistan
International Airways flight from Lahore, Sheikh asked passersby for a
"good hotel" to stay in and settled on the Holiday Inn, which floored him
with a bill that "was an astounding $210 a night," Sheikh wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh said his orders were to find an American to kidnap, and he was
having trouble befriending any American travelers at the regular tourist
stops.</TE>
<TE>   So he decided that an American teacher might be a good person to
kidnap and went looking for one at the Woodstock School, a boarding
school in Mussoorie, in the lush green Himalayan foothills of India's
Uttar Pradesh state.</TE>
<TE>   As always, Sheikh had another motive. He needed to soothe an ego
apparently bruised when he left the London School of Economics after his
first year in 1993 to make the trip to Bosnia.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh wrote in his diary that he applied for a job as a teacher at
Woodstock "partly because I wanted to see whether cutting short my
academic career had greatly affected my competitiveness on the job
market. I was interviewed by the vice-principal and I didn't get offered
the job!"</TE>

<HD>American Recalls His 1994 Abduction</HD>
<DH>Crime: Bela Nuss was befriended and betrayed by a man now a suspect
in a U.S. reporter's seizure in Pakistan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bela Nuss knows what kidnapped journalist Daniel Pearl is going
through. He remembers the bite of the chains, the cold metal of a gun at
his head, the lifeless eyes of people who would "kill you in a New York
minute."</LD>
<LD>   The 51-year-old legal assistant in San Francisco especially remembers
the man who befriended him in a New Delhi restaurant seven years ago,
only to betray him. That man is Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, the leading
suspect in the abduction of Pearl, the 38-year-old Wall Street Journal
reporter who has been missing since Jan. 23.</LD>
<LD>   To Nuss, Sheikh was a friendly stranger who offered to take him to a
wedding, then abducted him in an aborted plot to trade Western kidnapping
victims for the captors' jailed allies. Nuss spent 11 days in chains,
eating rice and vegetables, his only contact with the outside world a
radio tuned to the Voice of America.</LD>
<TE>   "These people are not screwing around," said Nuss, a low-key man whose
love of adventure and the outdoors led him to Pakistan in 1994. "They're
killers."</TE>
<TE>   Even all these years later, Nuss doesn't talk about the events easily.
He declined to have his picture taken Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "These [terrorists] are not just over there," he said. "They're over
here now."</TE>
<TE>   He says he feels for Pearl's wife, who he imagines is going through
the same torment his family suffered during his kidnapping. Pearl was
abducted while exploring possible links between Pakistani militants and
Richard C. Reid, who was arrested on a Paris-to-Miami flight in December
while allegedly trying to light explosives in his shoes.</TE>
<TE>   "I would love to be of any assistance I could, if she wants to talk,"
Nuss said.</TE>
<TE>   Nuss went to India from Japan, where he had been teaching. A
self-described wanderer, he decided to travel around the Asian
subcontinent before returning to the United States. He wanted to see the
Himalayas and wanted even more to understand the daily routines of life
outside the United States.</TE>
<TE>   He'd been traveling around India for five months when a man he now
says was Sheikh sat down beside him in a restaurant and struck up a
conversation. The man was friendly. Nuss was eager to learn.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh invited his new friend to a wedding dinner. They met outside
Nuss' hotel. But instead of going to nuptial festivities, Nuss was
bundled into a car and driven to a grimy industrial area outside New
Delhi called Ghaziabad.</TE>
<TE>   Seizing Nuss was only one part of the abductors' plan. In the weeks
before his kidnapping, three British backpackers were also taken hostage.
They were kept apart from Nuss in a house 100 miles north of New Delhi.</TE>
<TE>   Nuss said he rarely saw Sheikh during his 11-day ordeal. He was
guarded by four others. Some of the guards treated him well, seeing to
his needs, but "their intention was to off us," Nuss said. "I could see
it in their faces."</TE>
<TE>   Midway through his capture, he snapped, yanking at his chains and
screaming, "I don't want to be here!"</TE>
<TE>   After that, his minders stopped telling him that he'd be released soon
and said they'd keep him as long as they wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Nuss stopped eating. And then, several days later, his rescue was
accomplished--"by pure luck," he says now. Indian police investigating
crime in the area broke into the house and found Nuss on a mattress, in
chains. One of the kidnappers directed police to the whereabouts of the
Britons, who also were freed without injury.</TE>
<TE>   After his ordeal, Nuss entered therapy.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel like it's left any nasty residues," he said of the
kidnapping. It wasn't the first time he had faced death. He nearly
drowned once on a river rafting trip.</TE>
<TE>   But the experience did temper him.</TE>
<TE>   "I've taken a more philosophical, inward path," he said. "I'm very
Earth-oriented. I try to live a conscious life."</TE>

<HD>Karzai Pledges to Back Release of 'Good' Pakistani Prisoners</HD>
<DH>Asia: Afghan leader, on a symbolic visit to Islamabad, asks
Musharraf for continued support of refugees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>In his first visit here since he assumed power, Afghanistan's
interim prime minister, Hamid Karzai, pledged to work for the release of
"good" Pakistanis captured alongside Taliban troops and asked Pakistan to
continue supporting Afghan refugees until his nation is ready for their
return.</LD>
<LD>   The neighboring countries also vowed to rejuvenate "strong brotherly
relations" based on mutual respect and trust.</LD>
<LD>   "We wish to conduct our relations with Afghanistan built on principles
of sovereign equality, noninterference and mutual interest," Pakistani
President Pervez Musharraf said after a short private talk with Karzai on
Friday. "We have also agreed not to allow each other's country to be used
against the interest of either country."</LD>
<TE>   The pledge was a significant shift from past relations, when Pakistan
actively supported the Taliban regime, which Karzai opposed. Both men
glossed over that recent chapter and focused instead on earlier days when
Pakistan helped Karzai and others defeat a Soviet occupation and proxy
government.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not only bound by geography and population, but we are also
bound, Mr. President, by the years of cooperation in the former Afghan
jihad, and the Afghan people remember that and are grateful for that,"
Karzai said in Islamabad, the capital. "We do look forward to a
tremendously good future ahead of us, and, yes, that future can be made
certain by respecting each other's territorial integrity."</TE>
<TE>   The mostly symbolic meeting came as the region's traditional power
brokers jockeyed for position. India and Russia on Friday announced a
weapons deal that would provide New Delhi with an aircraft carrier and
long-range aircraft--an acquisition that threatens to escalate an arms
race between India and Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf said he would push for renewed U.S. arms sales to Pakistan
during his visit to Washington next week. Those sales were suspended when
the United States imposed sanctions on Pakistan after Musharraf took
power in a bloodless coup in 1999. The sanctions were lifted after
Pakistan pledged support for the U.S. war on terrorism in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Russia, India, Iran and the United States have interests in Central
Asia's lucrative oil market, and each has proposed pipeline routes. On
Friday, Karzai said pipeline projects through Afghanistan were again
under consideration.</TE>
<TE>   "In a way, I think Karzai was trying to reassure Musharraf that
whatever India and Russia will be doing in Afghanistan will not be
against the interest of Pakistan," said Rifaat Hussain, director of the
department of strategic studies at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad.</TE>
<TE>   On the fate of more than 2 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan, Karzai
asked for patience.</TE>
<TE>   "Our refugees are given tremendous welcome here, but they have a home
to go to, and that is Afghanistan," Karzai said. "We would be grateful if
our brothers in Pakistan allowed us time to prepare for that."</TE>
<TE>   In turn, Karzai promised that hundreds of Pakistanis would eventually
return home from detention camps in Afghanistan. Reports have surfaced
that Afghan warlords have been extorting money from the prisoners in
exchange for their release.</TE>
<TE>   "We are looking at freeing all the prisoners there, but they will have
to be screened out," Karzai said. "The good ones will definitely come
home, and the bad ones are a matter for all of us to deal with in a
manner that we find suitable. I'm sure this will have an answer very,
very soon."</TE>

<HD>Taliban Minister Gives Up</HD>
<DH>War: Foreign affairs chief surrenders, official says. U.S. troops
comb site where several Al Qaeda suspects were killed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Taliban foreign minister turned himself in to officials in the
southern Afghan city of Kandahar on Friday, becoming the highest-ranking
such official to do so, a U.S. defense official said.</LD>
<LD>   Wakil Ahmed Mutawakel was transferred to the U.S. military base at the
city's airport, where he was being held Friday night, Lt. Col. Martin
Compton said.</LD>
<LD>   Omar Samad, a spokesman for the Afghan Foreign Ministry, said the
interim government had "been expecting some important Taliban leaders who
are on the run to either turn themselves in or to be caught and to be
brought to justice," according to Associated Press.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, more than 50 U.S. soldiers began clearing a site in
southeastern Afghanistan where a U.S. airstrike killed several suspected
Al Qaeda holdouts--although no evidence has suggested that Osama bin
Laden was among them, Pentagon officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. troops' mission took them to Zhawar Kili, which has been the
focus of intense and repeated bombing. The most recent air attack
occurred Monday, when a missile fired by an unmanned Predator plane
struck a group of men traveling in a convoy within hours of several
intelligence reports that Al Qaeda fighters were in the convoy, Gen.
Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a
Pentagon briefing.</TE>
<TE>   Despite reports that a tall Arab--perhaps Bin Laden--was among the
dead, Myers said, defense strategists "simply have no idea" if he was
there. Intelligence officials said they had no reason to believe that the
Al Qaeda leader was slain. However, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld
cautioned, "We haven't ruled anything in or out."</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers waited until daylight to begin their sweep for any
documents, equipment or other items that might help intelligence
officials, Myers said. It remained unclear how many individuals were
killed and who they were, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what they're in there gathering the intelligence on," Myers
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Predator, a windowless 27-foot drone, was originally built as a
surveillance craft for the Air Force. But early in the war, the CIA
debuted its version of the plane, armed with Hellfire missiles, in
strikes over Afghanistan. Myers declined to say whether the Predator that
launched Monday's strike belonged to the Pentagon or the CIA.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials have portrayed their actions as aggressive but
carefully orchestrated to avoid unplanned casualties, following the
release this week of 27 detainees who were held after Army Rangers seized
them in a raid in which an estimated 15 people were killed. Defense
Department officials have insisted that the raid was not a mistake,
because U.S. and Afghan soldiers were fired on as they entered.</TE>
<TE>   The focus on mistakes in the war intensified this week as Gen. John
Jumper, the Air Force chief of staff, issued an order calling for a "down
day" on which the Air Force will take a close look at safety procedures
and review guidelines on "risk management." The order, issued Wednesday
but made public Friday, affects units in the war in Afghanistan and
throughout the world.</TE>
<TE>   Each active-duty unit was ordered to declare a down day before next
Friday. The Air Force reserve command will have until March 8. The
campaign, the first in several years, will not ground warplanes over
Afghanistan, but officials there will be required to review safety
procedures during off hours.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to a string of incidents in Afghanistan, there have been
crashes and other aircraft problems elsewhere. They include the Feb. 2
crash of a C-21 transport plane that killed both crew members outside
Ellsworth Air Force Base, S.D. Although the order did not mention recent
accidents, it urged Air Force managers to increase their attention to
safety.</TE>
<TE>   "We're at a point where it's appropriate to step back, assess our
processes from a safety perspective and then carry on with the work our
nation is counting on us to complete," Jumper said in a message posted on
the Air Force Web site.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force has had 13 major aircraft accidents during the last four
months, compared with six in the comparable period a year ago, Col. Greg
Alston, deputy chief of Air Force safety, told Associated Press. He said
10 of the 13 accidents were attributable to human error.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a crisis. It's a spike" in the statistical pattern, Alston
said.</TE>

<HD>Bush Rails Against Regulating Farmland</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER
</DL>
<LD>President Bush issued a stern complaint Friday about governmental
regulation of private property, declaring that the best environmental
policy comes from those who own the land.</LD>
<LD>   He delivered his remarks to the Cattle Industry Convention and Trade
Show, offering support for a farm bill pending in Congress that would
spend $73.5 billion over 10 years.</LD>
<LD>   Bush said the measure should include incentives to encourage ranchers
to adhere to sound conservation practices. Among the environmental issues
that have the greatest effect on ranches are overgrazing of land,
creating risk of erosion and, near feed lots, the fouling of streams with
animal waste.</LD>
<TE>   Bush's remarks on the environment won him his longest round of
applause from an audience filled with ranchers and other cattle industry
figures, many dressed in jeans, boots and tall white hats at the Colorado
Convention Center.</TE>
<TE>   He raised the environmental concerns in an account of a tour he gave
of his ranch near Crawford, Texas, in November for Russian President
Vladimir V. Putin and his wife, Lyudmila.</TE>
<TE>   The Putins expressed surprise that government policy did not regulate
what trees he could cut, Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   The decision of an individual property owner, Bush said, "makes better
environmental policy, better land-use policy, than if it was dictated
from a central source of people, many of whom have probably never been on
the land."</TE>
<TE>   The Senate is expected to vote on a final farm measure next week,
while the House has already passed farm legislation. A committee from the
two bodies will work to reconcile differences in the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's comments were his most extensive on the farm bill.</TE>
<TE>   In expressing support for the cost of the measure, Bush said he wanted
the money to be spent "relatively evenly over the decade," rather than
offering greater sums in the early years to win political support and
then watching the farm economy suffer from a lack of support in later
years.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to spend the money without, I guess you could call it,
political gimmickry," Bush said. "To put it bluntly, what we don't want
to do is over-promise to farmers and under-perform."</TE>
<TE>   Agriculture Secretary Anne M. Veneman said Bush's remarks were
directed at the Senate bill, which she said spends the money unevenly.</TE>
<TE>   Bush sought the industry's support for another measure: giving the
administration enhanced authority to negotiate trade agreements.</TE>
<TE>   "We want people in China eating U.S. beef," Bush said. At the same
time, "it's in our national security interests that we be able to feed
ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank goodness we don't have to rely on somebody else's meat to make
sure our people are healthy and well fed."</TE>
<TE>   After the speech, Bush flew to Salt Lake City for the opening ceremony
of the Winter Olympics. He will spend the rest of the weekend in Jackson
Hole, Wyo.</TE>

<HD>Arrest Tarnishes Gymnast Korbut's Golden Past</HD>
<DH>Charges: A shoplifting accusation stuns fans of the Olympic
champion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<AU>EDITH STANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA
</DL>
<LD>Fans of former champion gymnast Olga Korbut still bubble in awe
over her daring back flips and her megawatt charisma. But then they
pivot, voices lowered, to topics that make them cringe: Korbut's recent
arrest on a shoplifting charge--and her possible link to $30,000 in
counterfeit bills found in her former home.</LD>
<LD>   As the Winter Olympics open in Salt Lake City, Korbut, a four-time
gold medalist, finds herself under investigation here in the suburbs of
Atlanta.</LD>
<LD>   She was arrested last week in Gwinnett County on charges that she
shoplifted $19 worth of merchandise from a grocery store. A security
officer at the market accused her of shoving chocolate syrup, cheese,
figs and tea into her purse. Korbut called it a misunderstanding and said
through a lawyer that she was confident the charges would be dismissed.</LD>
<TE>   But in the meantime, the Secret Service announced it is investigating
a stash of counterfeit bills found in the suburban home where Korbut
lived until recently. Sheriff's deputies who entered the house Dec. 5 to
serve an eviction notice found the fake $100 bills, which apparently had
been dummied up on a computer. Some of the bills were still on uncut
sheets of printer paper.</TE>
<TE>   Korbut's manager has said that she moved out of the house--which has
the Olympic rings marked in brick on the driveway--after divorcing her
husband in 2000. Her son, Richard, had been living there most recently,
although the house was dilapidated and by all appearances abandoned by
the time deputies arrived to foreclose.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are studying a computer found in the house for clues as
to who might have printed the bogus currency. Korbut has denied any
involvement and has said, according to her manager, that she wants to
take a polygraph test. But authorities said they might not even need to
question her.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, she's the past owner of the house . . . , but to be fair
to Olga Korbut, no one's naming her" as a suspect, said Bill Creel, the
assistant special agent in charge of the Secret Service's Atlanta office.</TE>
<TE>   Creel noted too that the counterfeiting case is nothing spectacular:
It is one of scores of fake-money investigations the Atlanta office
undertakes every year. "This really is a routine investigation, other
than the fact that her name has come up."</TE>
<TE>   The name, however, makes it anything but routine.</TE>
<TE>   It's been 30 years since Korbut dazzled the world with acrobatics at
the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany. But her reputation remains
formidable among gymnastics fans. They remember the teenage Korbut, a
pixie in pigtails, sticking a backward flip on the balance beam and
another during her uneven bars routine. No one had ever seen any feat
like it. Korbut won three gold medals in that competition for her native
Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   Korbut returned to win another gold in the 1976 Olympics. And in 1988,
she was the first athlete to be inducted into the International
Gymnastics Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   For the last 11 years, she has lived in the Atlanta area, teaching
kids gymnastics for $25 to $50 a lesson. She has earned the fierce
loyalty of many parents, who describe her as loving, upstanding, modest
and exacting--and still capable, at age 46, of remarkable gymnastics
moves.</TE>
<TE>   Her arrest on the shoplifting charge stunned many who know her. So has
the buzz about her onetime residence; the deputies who found the fake
$100 bills described the home as heavily vandalized, with kitchen
cabinets and toilets dislodged and some of Korbut's gymnastics
memorabilia strewn about.</TE>
<TE>   "It is just so sad that all this is going on," said one mother whose
children study gymnastics with Korbut. "I have to tell you, she is the
kindest person you would ever meet. The kids adore her. They respect her.
She's a very ethical person, with a lot of character. . . . I just wish
everyone would leave her alone."</TE>
<TE>   A woman who used to work with Korbut at Vinings Athletic Club echoed
the praise: "We all knew her as a wonderful person, and she was wonderful
with the kids. I can't imagine she would be involved with this. I don't
believe any of it."</TE>

<HD>Rudder Shifts Can Spell Doom, Pilots Warned</HD>
<DH>Safety: Aviation experts say NTSB advisory is unnecessary, as such
maneuvers are aberrant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Federal officials said Friday they have uncovered a new aviation
safety problem that under rare circumstances could cause any jetliner's
tail to break off.</LD>
<LD>   The National Transportation Safety Board urged immediate changes in
training procedures to warn pilots against making sharp, back-and-forth
rudder movements that could put an excessive strain on a plane's vertical
tail fin.</LD>
<LD>   "We have calculated that certain rudder-movement inputs by pilots
could cause a catastrophic failure of an airliner's vertical tail fin,"
said NTSB Chairwoman Marion C. Blakey. "This concern is not limited to
the A300, or even to Airbus models. Our concern is industry-wide."</LD>
<TE>   The Federal Aviation Administration, which sets safety standards for
the industry, said it would quickly comply with the NTSB advisory. "We
agree with the safety intent and the substance of the recommendation,"
said spokesman Les Dorr.</TE>
<TE>   The warning arises out of the safety board's investigation of the
crash of American Airlines Flight 587 in November, shortly after takeoff
from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. The tail fin of
the A300 jet tore off, making the plane unflyable. The crash killed all
260 people aboard and five on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of that accident--and indeed, whether pilot actions played
any role--has yet to be determined. The NTSB is also investigating
possible flaws in the composite material used to build the 27-foot-long
tail fin.</TE>
<TE>   Blakey said the board's analysis and simulations went beyond the crash
of Flight 587, revealing a potential safety problem that could affect
about 15,000 jetliners flying around the globe.</TE>
<TE>   Pilots questioned the NTSB's recommendation. They say they usually
avoid making sharp rudder movements the way the driver of a sport-utility
vehicle would avoid spinning the steering wheel back and forth on the
freeway.</TE>
<TE>   "To apply full rudder in opposite directions in rapid succession is
something that a pilot would not do," said Barry Schiff, a retired
airline captain and safety consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Industry officials said the condition described by the agency is so
rare that it is hard to draw any immediate conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   In more than 300 million flights by modern jetliners, there has been
no case of a tail snapping off because of rudder movements initiated by
pilots.</TE>
<TE>   "The NTSB has identified an important issue here in terms of pilot
awareness of how their airplanes behave," said Rich Breuhaus, chief
aviation safety investigator for Boeing Co. "But it would be unfortunate
if the recommendation was misconstrued that there was somehow a serious
problem with the world's airplanes. The service history of these
airplanes stands up pretty darn well."</TE>
<TE>   Airbus spokeswoman Mary Anne Greczyn said the company will immediately
revise its training manuals to reflect the NTSB recommendation.
"Temporary revisions to all our flight manuals will be in place Monday,"
Greczyn said.</TE>
<TE>   Blakey said the NTSB is not trying to alarm travelers and has reached
no conclusions about the cause of the Flight 587 crash.</TE>
<TE>   "Our purpose is not to create unnecessary concern but to notify pilots
that we have learned something that requires their immediate awareness
and to ultimately prevent such an event from happening in the first
place," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very important that we all clearly understand that this
recommendation is about pilot training and education, and is not a
question of pilot error," she added.</TE>
<TE>   The NTSB is studying whether the federal safety standards that govern
design of major aircraft components like the tail fin need to be revised
in light of its findings. The current standards do not address the issue
of back-and-forth rudder movements because pilots don't normally engage
in such maneuvers.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if the standards should be revised, Blakey said: "We're not
there yet." Such a revision could entail expensive retrofitting of
thousands of aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   The rudder is a movable panel on the rear edge of a plane's tail fin
that helps keep it flying straight. Unlike a ship's rudder, it does not
play a major role in turning the aircraft, which is accomplished by
moving panels on the wings called ailerons.</TE>
<TE>   In aviation, the rudder is chiefly used to keep an aircraft on course
when landing or taking off in a crosswind, or if an engine fails. The
safety board said it did not find any problem with continuing to use the
rudder in these conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Pilots employ pedals to operate the rudder. And to prevent
over-stressing the tail fin, jetliners are fitted with a device that
limits rudder movement during high-speed flight.</TE>
<TE>   The NTSB said Friday that Flight 587 experienced five sharp rudder
movements in opposing directions in the last seven seconds of its flight.
In each case the rudder moved close to its full allowed limit of about 9
degrees. It is not clear whether those motions resulted from pilot
commands, a rudder malfunction, a weakened tail fin starting to come off
or some combination of factors.</TE>
<TE>   A safety board investigator said the agency has studied more than 20
"rudder oscillation" incidents on jetliners but "none of them directly
relate to our problem."</TE>
<TE>   The NTSB said pilots should be aware that at higher speeds, relatively
light pressure on the control pedals can result in sharp rudder movements
on some planes. They cited the A300 and the Boeing 737 as examples.</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Blakey said the
safety board is also concerned that pilots may misuse the rudder in
taking emergency action to thwart a hijacking. But Dorr, the FAA
spokesman, said the agency has not authorized pilots to undertake
acrobatic maneuvers.</TE>
<TE>   "The only situation in which we would approve of aggressive maneuvers
would be in cases where the procedures are included in the flight manual
and are part of the pilot training program," Dorr said.</TE>

<LD>Scientists studying the remains of the crew of a Civil War-era
submarine said they were getting a better picture of the men who died
when the world's first successful attack sub sank--and one surprise was
how tall they were.</LD>
<LD>   The Confederate sub H.L. Hunley disappeared Feb. 17, 1864, shortly
after sinking the Union ship Housatonic in Charleston Harbor. In 1995, a
dive team found it four miles off Sullivan's Island.</LD>
<LD>   The sub was raised in 2000; scientists have been studying the remains
of the eight crew members since last year.</LD>
<TE>   The captain of the 43-foot craft, Lt. George Dixon, was 6 feet tall,
and the other crew also were much taller than scientists expected.</TE>

<LD>U.S. Rep. James A. Traficant Jr. objected repeatedly to the
dismissal of prospective jurors in his Cleveland bribery trial and
suggested the judge was trying to get an all-white jury.</LD>
<LD>   Traficant raised the race issue after the judge excused a black woman
with health problems. Judge Lesley Wells dismissed the veteran Democrat's
complaint and said she wasn't aware of the racial makeup of the jury
pool.</LD>
<LD>   Traficant, 60, who is white, is accused of accepting gifts and favors
in exchange for using his political influence, tax falsification and
racketeering.</LD>

<HD>'You Represent Peace,' Bush Tells Olympic Team</HD>
<DH>Tradition: Leader of host country opens Games. President's visit
added a challenge for the 10,000 security people on duty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>Riding a wave of sentiments in red, white and blue, President Bush
welcomed the Olympic Winter Games to the United States on Friday as an
opportunity, in the midst of the world's turmoil "to celebrate
international peace and cooperation."</LD>
<LD>   At every turn during his visit here, including his meeting with the
U.S. Olympic team, Bush brought up the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the
World Trade Center and the Pentagon and pleaded for peace and unity.</LD>
<LD>   "You represent a spirit much bigger than evil and terror. You
represent peace," Bush told the team members hours before they marched
into Rice-Eccles Stadium for the opening ceremony. Three members of the
New York-New Jersey Port Authority Police Department were at the meeting,
along with the tattered U.S. flag found in the ruins of the World Trade
Center.</LD>
<TE>   The decision to carry the torn flag in the opening parade has been
controversial, with critics saying the U.S. was placing too great an
emphasis on American patriotism at an international sporting event.</TE>
<TE>   Of the flap over the flag, Bush said: "The events are going to strike
a proper balance between the patriotism that we all feel here and the
international flavor of the Games.</TE>
<TE>   "These Games come at a perfect time for us," the president said,
driving home his message that the Olympics will allow the U.S. to display
for the world its unity and the value it places on freedom.</TE>
<TE>   The time with the team seemed to come naturally to Bush. As a
part-owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team before he was elected
governor of Texas in 1994, he mingles easily with athletes and calls
himself a sportsman.</TE>
<TE>   The team members, in their dark blue jackets over sky-blue sweaters
with red-and-white trim, clustered in front of the president--who donned
one of their jackets--and his wife, Laura. Behind them stood, among
others, skier Picabo Street and skater Michelle Kwan.</TE>
<TE>   The head of state of the host country traditionally opens the Games.
With security at the Olympics heightened since the Sept. 11 attacks,
Bush's visit added yet one more challenge for the 10,000 law enforcement
and military personnel on duty.</TE>
<TE>   When President Reagan opened the Summer Games in 1984 in Los Angeles,
he, like Bush, was atop a patriotic tide. He sent the athletes out to do
their best with a stirring proclamation of "a new patriotism spreading
across our country."</TE>
<TE>   "Do it," he instructed them, "for the Gipper."</TE>
<TE>   That call reached back to one of his early movies, in which he played
Notre Dame running back George Gipp in the movie "Knute Rockne--All
American."</TE>
<TE>   At a time when his White House worked assiduously to promote
patriotism in the post-Vietnam War era, Reagan used the Olympic Games as
a stage to tell the athletes, and the country, that the spirit of Old
Glory "is evident all across this land."</TE>
<TE>   Before the ceremony began, Bush attended a reception of Utah officials
and others who helped bring the Games here. Echoing Reagan's patriotic
message but broadening it, Bush presented the Games as a lesson for the
world in the post-Sept. 11 period.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that these ideals--liberty and freedom--make it possible
for people to live together in peace. And the Olympics give the world a
chance in the middle of a difficult struggle to celebrate international
peace and cooperation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We love, we cherish and we will defend freedom at any cost.</TE>
<TE>   "For centuries, the Olympics have reinforced an important lesson,"
Bush said. "It's an important lesson for today: No matter how wide our
political or cultural differences may be, some things are valued and
enjoyed the world over. All people appreciate the discipline that
produces excellence, the courage that overcomes difficult odds, the
character that creates champions."</TE>
<TE>   Bush arrived in Salt Lake City on Friday afternoon. At midday, he had
spoken to the Cattle Industry Convention and Trade Show in Denver.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the day, he planned to fly to Jackson, Wyo., for a
weekend visit at the vacation home of Roland Betts, a fraternity brother
from his days at Yale University.</TE>

<HD>Agency Blamed in Fatal Fire</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Forest Service ignored rules in July blaze, OSHA finds.
Four firefighters died.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>YAKIMA, Wash.
</DL>
<LD>The Forest Service willfully disregarded employee safety at a
wildfire last summer in which four firefighters were killed, the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   OSHA said the Forest Service did not provide a place of employment
that was "free of recognized hazards that could cause serious harm or
death."</LD>
<LD>   It noted, as the Forest Service had in its own investigation, that
fire managers violated 10 basic firefighting safety rules and ignored or
disregarded 10 of the 18 warning signs for danger.</LD>
<TE>   OSHA also found that the Forest Service failed to follow its own
guidelines for work and rest, that there were questions about who was in
charge at different times during the fire and that there were inadequate
plans for deploying emergency fire shelters when the firefighters
couldn't escape the flames.</TE>
<TE>   The 30-Mile Fire, started by an abandoned campfire, blew up July 10,
going from 25 acres to 2,500 acres in less than three hours. Fourteen
Forest Service firefighters and two campers were trapped by the inferno
in the narrow Chewuch River canyon in Washington state's Okanogan
National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Craven, 30, of Ellensburg, and Devin Weaver, 21, Jessica Johnson,
19, and Karen FitzPatrick, 18, all of Yakima, died after breathing
superheated air in their emergency fire shelters on a rock slope.</TE>
<TE>   A fifth firefighter, Jason Emhoff, also of Yakima, was seriously
burned after he ran to a van.</TE>
<TE>   OSHA, which has no penalty or enforcement authority over federal
agencies, also said there were insufficient job performance standards and
evaluations for Forest Service supervisors and managers.</TE>
<TE>   "I was delighted to see OSHA did a more candid job of reporting the
level of negligence," said Ken Weaver, Devin's father. "The Forest
Service report tended to soft-sell the negligence of the decisions of the
supervisors."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Terrill, OSHA's regional administrator in Seattle, said his
agency was working with the Forest Service to correct any problems before
the next fire season.</TE>
<TE>   "Wildland firefighting will always have its dangers," Terrill said,
"but Forest Service officials have expressed their willingness to
implement improvements that can reduce the risks."</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, the Forest Service said the deaths could have been
prevented had the safety rules been followed. For instance, more effort
should have been made to identify escape routes or safety zones, and to
assess weather forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service report also said fire safety equipment was
improperly used, contributing to injuries, and recommended procedural
changes to make firefighting safer.</TE>
<TE>   "I've directed my employees to focus on preventing a tragedy like this
from happening again," Forest Service Chief Dale Bosworth said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the Forest Service has completed 11 of 31 proposed changes
based on its investigation. Some of those changes include finding ways to
increase firefighters' awareness of fire behavior, improve leadership and
better manage fatigue.</TE>
<TE>   Bosworth said the agency is also investigating the job performances of
the people who were responsible for managing the fire and its crews.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who need to be held accountable will be," Bosworth said.</TE>
<TE>   Weaver said he believes accountability is the only way the Forest
Service will ever effect real change in firefighting safety.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless there is accountability for the decisions being made on the
fire line, for the people telling these kids, 'Go down this road,' 'Go
fight this fire,' unless there is accountability, we're going to get bad
decisions," he said.</TE>

<HD>Korean War Veteran Charged With Defrauding Government</HD>

<DL>NASHVILLE, Tenn.
</DL>
<LD>An Army veteran who figured in the exposure of the refugee killings
at No Gun Ri, South Korea, in 1950 was charged Friday with scheming to
defraud the federal government.</LD>
<LD>   Edward Lee Daily falsely claimed he was a Korean POW and that he had
been wounded by shrapnel, U.S. Atty. Richard F. Clippard said.</LD>
<LD>   Daily was one of a dozen U.S. Army veterans cited by Associated Press
in 1999 as witnesses corroborating the accounts of South Korean survivors
that the 7th Cavalry Regiment killed a large number of refugees at No Gun
Ri.</LD>
<TE>   Daily later acknowledged he could not have been there at the time and
had learned about the killings secondhand.</TE>
<TE>   From February 1986 to October 2001, Daily received compensation from
the Department of Veterans Affairs and its predecessor, the Veterans
Administration, based on an application he filed listing the injury and
claiming POW status, Clippard said.</TE>
<TE>   Benefits included $324,911 in payments that were wired to his bank and
$87,928 in medical care for his claimed service-related disabilities,
Clippard said.</TE>
<TE>   Daily was indicted on a charge of wire fraud. If convicted, he faces
up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.</TE>
<TE>   Clippard said Daily had not been arrested and that an arraignment date
had not been set.</TE>

<HD>Show-Stopper Chopper Debuts</HD>
<DH>Military: The Knighthawk packs the latest gadgetry and can do a
variety of tasks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CORONADO
</DL>
<LD>Calling it the first of many changes that will transform the Navy,
Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Vern Clark unveiled the "helicopter of the
future" Friday at North Island Naval Air Station here.</LD>
<LD>   The MH-60S Knighthawk is not your father's helicopter.</LD>
<LD>   At $15 million a copy, the Knighthawk, a cousin of the Army's Black
Hawk helicopter, has the latest in electronics, ergonomics and cockpit
information display systems.</LD>
<TE>   It also can be reconfigured with different equipment and gear to
perform a variety of missions, from cargo-hauling, search-and-rescue and
submarine hunting to special warfare support and disaster relief.</TE>
<TE>   There are systems designed to make flying and landing easier than with
older helicopters, primarily the Navy workhorse, the Vietnam-era CH-46
Sea Knights. Other features, such as a more shock-absorbent seat, are
aimed at increasing chances that crew members can survive a crash.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like going from your father's old Cadillac, which was great in
its day, to a brand-new Porsche," said Lt. Angela Schedel, a Sea Knight
pilot who now teaches others to fly the Knighthawk.</TE>
<TE>   The Knighthawk, built by Sikorsky with a cockpit design by Lockheed
Martin, is key to the Navy's long-range plan to reduce from seven to two
the kinds of helicopters in its fleet. The Navy has decided it can no
longer afford seven kinds of helicopters, each with its own specialized
missions, maintenance needs and flying idiosyncrasies.</TE>
<TE>   In a ceremony complete with a symbolic flyover of Knighthawks, Clark
handed a flight book to Cmdr. Sherman Lupton, commanding officer of
Helicopter Combat Support Squadron 3. Pilots and enlisted crew members
have been training on the Knighthawk for months in preparation for
deployment to the Persian Gulf this spring.</TE>
<TE>   "Helo-air [helicopter aviation] as of this moment is at the forefront
of the Navy's transformation," Clark said.</TE>
<TE>   If the ceremony marked the debut of the Knighthawk, it was also a
farewell for the Sea Knight, which the Navy hopes to phase out by 2004.</TE>
<TE>   If the Sea Knight were a sailor, it would have a long row of hash
marks on its sleeve for years of service and a chest of battle
ribbons--as well as a couple of less-than-admirable things in its
personnel record.</TE>
<TE>   After joining the fleet in 1962, the Sea Knights saw service in
Vietnam, Grenada, Lebanon and Operation Desert Storm. Sea Knights rescued
Americans trapped in the U.S. Embassy in Mogadishu, Somalia, and are
hauling supplies and personnel throughout Afghanistan in the U.S. war on
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   But many of the Sea Knights are older than the Navy personnel and
Marines that fly them, and maintenance and procurement of parts are
headaches. During Desert Storm, too many Sea Knights were considered
unworthy to fly.</TE>
<TE>   "The [CH]-46 was a very nimble plane," said retired Navy Capt. Steve
Millikin, former commanding officer of a Sea Knight squadron. "But all
good things have to end, and it's time for it to go. But in its day . . .
."</TE>
<TE>   Car comparisons were everywhere at Friday's ceremony. Lt. Wes Cooper,
a pilot of the Navy's jumbo-sized CH-53E Super Stallion, said flying the
lighter Knighthawk is like going from a sport-utility vehicle to a race
car.</TE>
<TE>   And, yes, there is a new-car smell to the Knighthawk.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the neatest, newest thing out there," said Schedel.</TE>

<HD>Virginia Senate OKs Ban on Executing Retarded</HD>
<DH>Law: The bill advances at a key time. Next week the U.S. Supreme
Court will hear a case involving a state inmate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>RICHMOND, Va.
</DL>
<LD>The Virginia Senate unanimously approved a bill Friday that would
bar the execution of mentally retarded people convicted of capital
crimes.</LD>
<LD>   Senate Bill 497, altering the state's law on the death penalty,
passed, 40 to 0, without discussion. It must still be approved by the
House of Delegates and signed by Gov. Mark Warner, a Democrat, before it
can become law.</LD>
<LD>   The legislation's progress comes at a crucial time in the debate over
executing the mentally retarded, defined in the Virginia bill as people
with an IQ of less than 70 who are limited in key life skills. On
Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear a Virginia
inmate's argument that such executions violate the constitutional ban on
cruel and unusual punishment.</LD>
<TE>   The high court previously ruled in 1989 that community standards did
not ban capital punishment for the retarded because only two states
prohibited such executions.</TE>
<TE>   But Virginia may now join a rapidly growing group of states that have
changed their mind in the last decade. If the bill is signed into law,
Virginia would become the 19th capital punishment state to bar such
executions. Currently 19 other states allow execution of the retarded and
12 states do not have capital punishment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's absolutely remarkable," said Wayne Smith, director of the
Justice Project, which lobbies for changes in capital punishment laws.
"It's reflective of the changing attitudes about the death penalty."</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts said it is not clear what the Supreme Court will do with
the Virginia case of Daryl Atkins if the bill becomes law. Last summer,
the high court dropped a North Carolina case that it was going to use to
decide the issue because that state banned executing the retarded. But
this bill would not go into effect until 2003, well after the high court
is slated to finish with the Atkins case.</TE>
<TE>   In the House, a provision that would allow Virginia to prosecute
someone for raping a spouse passed, 93 to 3, a day after a long and
emotional debate on the issue.</TE>

<HD>Ten Commandment Bill Gains in Va.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RICHMOND, Va.
</DL>
<LD>Virginia's House of Delegates approved a bill Friday that would
allow public schools to post the Ten Commandments.</LD>
<LD>   The measure, which now goes to the Senate, would require the state
Board of Education to write guidelines for displaying the Ten
Commandments in classrooms, along with the text from three secular
documents: the 1st Amendment, the Declaration of Independence and the
Virginia Constitution.</LD>
<LD>   It would be up to local school officials whether to display the texts.</LD>
<TE>   The House vote was 52 to 46. Gov. Mark Warner has not taken a position
on the bill.</TE>
<TE>   The bill's Republican sponsor, Delegate L. Scott Lingamfelter, said he
went to great lengths to ensure the measure passes constitutional muster.</TE>
<TE>   The bill originally applied only to the Ten Commandments, but was
amended to include the nonreligious documents. The state attorney
general's office has said the measure does not appear to violate the
constitutionally required separation of church and state.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people have spoken about the intent of this bill, but as the
author of this bill, let me say to you from the bottom of my heart it is
not about religion," Lingamfelter said. "It is about values. It's about
the values that were at the root of the founding of this nation."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents said the bill is about religion and argued it would be
inappropriate to post the Ten Commandments next to the other documents.</TE>
<TE>   "The basic idea is that we as a government will not promote any
particular religion," said Delegate William K. Barlow, a Democrat. "This
bill promotes a specific belief."</TE>
<TE>   Kent Willis, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union
in Virginia, said after the House vote that the inclusion of the
nonreligious texts does not change the bill's religious purpose.</TE>
<TE>   "This may be an attempt to sort of dilute the religious message by
putting secular messages alongside it, but it won't work in this
instance," he said.</TE>

<HD>Overlooked Code Talker to Get Medal</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Marine Corps has concluded that David Tsosie served as a Navajo
Code Talker during World War II and is entitled to a Congressional Silver
Medal that had been denied to him.</LD>
<LD>   Tsosie, 79, had expected to get his medal during a ceremony last year
honoring hundreds of other Navajo Code Talkers. But the Marine Corps said
it lacked proof that Tsosie had actually been one of the group, which
shipped messages coded in their native language in the war's Pacific
theater.</LD>
<LD>   But after further investigation, the Marine Corps found that Tsosie
graduated from Navajo Communications School on Sept. 7, 1943, and that he
was entitled to an award, Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) and Rep. Thomas
Udall (D-N.M.) said Friday.</LD>
<TE>   The two lawmakers who sponsored the legislation to honor the Code
Talkers with congressional medals of honor, had urged the Pentagon to
investigate Tsosie's status.</TE>
<TE>   "Because Code Talkers were sworn to secrecy, they were not properly
honored until a few short months ago, some 50 years after the end of
World War II. But for Mr. Tsosie, the wait has been even longer,"
Bingaman said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   He applauded the Pentagon and the Marine Corps for conducting the
investigation, "But most of all, I thank Mr. Tsosie for his invaluable
service to our country."</TE>
<TE>   In a ceremony in the Capitol rotunda last July, President Bush awarded
Congressional Gold Medals to the four surviving members of the 29 Marines
who developed an unbreakable code based on the Navajo language.</TE>
<TE>   Several hundred others who used the code in battles on the Pacific
Front were awarded the Congressional Silver Medal last November.</TE>

<LD>An airline passenger who was subdued with an ax after he kicked in
the bottom of a cockpit door and tried to wriggle through said later that
he had "wanted to destroy everything," according to the FBI.</LD>
<LD>   Pablo Moreira Mosca, a 29-year-old bank employee from Uruguay, was
arrested after Thursday's incident aboard a United Airlines flight from
Miami to Buenos Aires with 157 people on board.</LD>
<LD>   Argentine authorities said they were investigating whether he was
under the influence of drugs or is mentally unstable. U.S. officials said
that he did not appear to be drunk and was not armed and that it did not
appear to be a terrorist act.</LD>
<TE>   "His brother said he often becomes upset when there is turbulence, and
passengers told us he had been drinking a lot on the plane. But when I
asked him about it, he told me he had one whiskey prior to getting on the
plane," Argentine air force spokesman Jorge Reta said.</TE>
<TE>   Moreira was sent back to the U.S. and appeared in federal court
Friday. He was held without bail on a charge of interfering with a flight
crew, which carries a maximum term of 20 years in prison.</TE>

<DL>CLEVELAND
</DL>
<LD>A small jet bound for New York was diverted to Cleveland on Friday
to get rid of a passenger authorities say angrily refused to put out his
cigarette and muttered words including the World Trade Center.</LD>
<LD>   The flight, a Delta connection operated by Atlantic Coast Airlines,
was carrying 18 passengers and three crew members from Indianapolis to La
Guardia airport.</LD>
<LD>   Rick DeLisi, spokesman for Atlantic Coast Airlines, said the passenger
lit a cigarette in the cabin and wouldn't put it out.</LD>
<TE>   "The man became verbally abusive and lit up yet another cigarette and
continued to be verbally abusive," DeLisi said. "The crew decided at that
point because they were over Cleveland to divert to Cleveland."</TE>
<TE>   The passenger, whose name was not released, was a 35-year-old
Frenchman with a history of mental problems, said Natalia Martinovic,
spokeswoman for Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   She said the man made passengers nervous with erratic behavior that
included changing seats several times.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Moves to Quickly Secure Russia's Vast Nuclear Stockpile</HD>
<DH>Weapons: Energy secretary calls the 'harrowing' situation his
highest priority.</DH>

<LD>The Bush administration is speeding efforts to safeguard Cold
War-era nuclear stockpiles before terrorists can get hold of them, Energy
Secretary Spencer Abraham said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Addressing the Los Angeles World Affairs Council in Beverly Hills,
Abraham outlined a series of measures aimed primarily at securing the
former Soviet Union's vast stockpiles of weapon-grade radioactive
materials.</LD>
<LD>   "We are facing a situation we think is, frankly, more harrowing than
it was a decade ago. . . . I don't believe I have any higher priority,"
Abraham said.</LD>
<TE>   He acknowledged that some efforts to contain the proliferation of
nuclear weapons were undertaken during the Clinton administration but
said that the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept.
11 demonstrated the need to expand and accelerate those efforts,
especially in Russia.</TE>
<TE>   The collapse of the Soviet Union led to breakdowns in the protections
of 40,000 nuclear weapons, plus assorted nuclear materials, some of which
are coveted by terrorist groups and other countries.</TE>
<TE>   Abraham said many of the scientists and technicians who oversee those
materials have gone with little or no pay for months at a time, raising
concerns they might exchange nuclear products for bribes. Authorities
have documented about 200 illicit attempts to acquire nuclear materials
in recent years, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Abraham said heightened security measures will include better
housekeeping and accounting practices, new technologies and incentives.
While they are focused on Russia, they also deal with nuclear materials
in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Ukraine, as well as in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Under an agreement worked out with counterparts in Russia, U.S.
officials will help accelerate a program to enhance security for trucks
and trains hauling weapon-grade material and to store it in fewer
locations to make it less vulnerable to sabotage or terrorist attack. The
program will be completed by 2008, two years ahead of schedule, Abraham
said.</TE>
<TE>   Other measures he cited include installation of radiation detectors at
transit and border crossings to prevent smuggling. President Bush's
budget proposal seeks $1.2 billion for nonproliferation programs,
two-thirds of which is earmarked for programs in Russia. A quarter of a
billion dollars more is earmarked for research and development of new
technologies to help counter nuclear proliferation and terrorism, Abraham
said. Russia and the United States have reached agreement on a
controversial plan to convert 68 tons of plutonium in both countries into
fuel for atomic reactors. Critics challenged the costs to the United
States, but Abraham said the administration lopped $2 billion off the
program and can complete it within three years.</TE>
<TE>   "If one good thing can come out of the tragedy of Sept. 11, it's that
our nation is now working more closely with Moscow on issues of national
security--ours as well as theirs--than we have done at any time in the
post-Soviet era," Abraham said.</TE>
<TE>   A yearlong review of controls led administration officials to conclude
that the threat of nuclear materials getting into the wrong hands is
greater today than ever, Abraham said.</TE>
<TE>   In the war in Afghanistan, documents left by Al Qaeda and Taliban
forces reveal diagrams and information for the construction of crude
nuclear devices. Authorities believe terrorists are capable of assembling
a "dirty bomb" by using conventional explosives to disperse plutonium or
other radioactive materials in an urban area.</TE>
<TE>   In an address before Congress last week, Bush blasted an "axis of
evil" consisting of North Korea, Iraq and Iran for promoting terrorism
and pursuing weapons of mass destruction.</TE>

<LD>Veteran independent Southland concert promoter Steve Zepeda has
quit his new job booking weekend shows at Kozmos in Huntington Beach
after the first two events because of a disagreement with the club's
owner.</LD>
<LD>   "I booked it in the best fashion I know how to book," says Zepeda, who
previously brought local and touring acts into the Foothill club in
Signal Hill and, before that, at Bogart's in Long Beach, "When I
presented the lineup to [owner Pam Morgan], she wasn't happy with it. I
totally understand how she felt, and if she didn't like any of the bands
I booked, that's her preference."</LD>
<LD>   Morgan, the rock-alternative-funk and dance club's owner, says, "We
have basically agreed to disagree. There are no hard feelings, we just
have different wants," adding that she felt Zepeda's bookings leaned too
heavily on rockabilly acts. "It's not that I don't want rockabilly, I
just don't want to book it as frequently as he does, which would more or
less be putting the club into the category of rockabilly club."</LD>
<TE>   In his first round of shows at Kozmos (formerly the Lotus Lounge) last
weekend, Zepeda brought singer-songwriter Mike Martt, Gypsy Trash and
Kern Richards on Friday, and Fullerton-based nouveau bluegrass group
Linsy Wolsye on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Zepeda had lined up shows through early March, including Boobie Trap
and Wax Apples tonight, solo shows by Paladins guitarist Dave Gonzalez on
Thursday and Feb, 28, Big Sandy &amp; His FlyRite Boys on Friday, The Dibs
and Wonderlove (Feb. 16), Trucker Up (Feb. 21), Busstop Hurricanes (Feb.
22), Lords of Altamont and the Fabulous Tuscaderos (Feb. 23), Pleasure
Club and El Mysterioso (March 1), and Three Bad Jacks and Aces &amp; Eights
(March 2).</TE>
<TE>   Morgan said Boobie Trap and Wax Apples will play tonight as scheduled
and that Delta Nove and Jerome have been booked on Friday in place of Big
Sandy. She said she's still waiting to hear from other acts about whether
they'll keep their dates.</TE>
<TE>   Zepeda continues to handle Monday night shows at the Blue Cafe in Long
Beach.</TE>
<TE>Jazz Series Aids Autism</TE>
<TE>   A jazz series that's also a fundraiser for a new autism organization
starts tonight in Huntington Beach. Danish-born saxophonist Michael
Lington plays the inaugural concert at the Huntington Beach Cultural
Center.</TE>
<TE>   The concerts benefit the Pyramid Autism Center in Huntington Beach, a
facility that includes a school for autistic children and support
services for their families, The jazz series was started by Betty
Bennish, who also works on the annual Newport Beach Jazz Festival and
whose niece is autistic.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets "are $20 to $50, and performances are at 7 and 9 p.m. in the
cultural center's 319-seat theater at 7111 Talbert Ave. Information:
(7141) 377-7574 or www.bbjazzcentral.com</TE>
<TE>Hootenanny Travels</TE>
<TE>   The annual Hootenanny Festival will take place July 6 and for the
first time the Orange County-bred roots rock-meets-punk event will hit
the road as well. In addition to the Orange County stop, festival
organizers have booked dates July 5 in San Diego and July 7 in San
Francisco. If those shows are a success, Hootenanny could go national.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to build from the ground up," says Hootenanny promoter Bill
Hardie. "I'd hate to see us book 20 cities and then have to cancel 10. So
we'll try three this year, maybe six next year and then 12 the next. That
makes much more sense. But San Diego and San Francisco are naturals."</TE>
<TE>   Last year's, Hootenanny drew about 10, 000 fans to Hidden Valley Ranch
in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>Crystal Lewis on BET</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach-based contemporary Christian singer Crystal Lewis is
among the performers featured in "Celebration of Gospel," airing Feb. 19
at 9 p.m. on the BET-cable channel. The show is BET's second gospel
concert special offered as part of its Black History Month programming.
In addition to Lewis--who sings "My Tribute" with Andrae Crouch and "The
Blood Song" with Kirk Franklin--Destiny's Child, Shirley Caesar, Yolanda
Adams and Jaci Velasquez also performed at the concert, which took place
Jan. 26 at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>TSOL on National Tour</TE>
<TE>   Orange County-Long Beach punk group TSOL is headlining a national tour
of hard core punk acts that started this week in Minneapolis. The Unity
Fest tour also includes Agnostic Front, The Casualties and Rise Against,
and will reach Southern California later this month. Local stops include
shows Feb. 21 at Chain Reaction in Anaheim, Feb. 22 at the Glass House in
Pomona and Feb. 23 at the Palace in Hollywood. TSOL's record company, the
Offspring-owned Nitro Records in Huntington Beach, is conducting a ticket
giveaway for those three dates over its Web site, www.nitrorecords.com.</TE>
