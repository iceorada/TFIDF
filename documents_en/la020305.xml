<HD>'Gene Kelly' Retraces Steps of an Illustrious Career</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It'll take more than complaints about Gene Kelly's perfectionism and
deep competitive streak to make audiences dislike one of the most
devastatingly appealing men ever to dance across movie and television
screens.</LD>
<LD>   Boasting interviews with an impressive array of writers,
colleagues and family members, Robert Trachtenberg's "Gene Kelly:
Anatomy of a Dancer," tonight on the PBS "American Masters" series,
proves that Kelly wasn't always easy to live or work with. But the
90-minute documentary also represents a vivid if arguably excessive
tribute to his achievements as dancer, choreographer and director.</LD>
<LD>   Kelly's dance partners Cyd Charisse and Leslie Caron offer the
sharpest takes on his working methods and dancing style, while
ex-wife Betsy Blair and composer Andre Previn provide the deepest
insights on his life off the dance floor. Home movies show Kelly's
dancing before his film debut--including rare glimpses of the 1940
Broadway musical "Pal Joey."</LD>
<TE>   The documentary hits its stride when covering Kelly's work at MGM,
with abundant clips reminding us of the impact he made and how he
used his popularity to update and upgrade film-dance. However, his
many projects after leaving MGM are largely kissed off, and some of
the film's historical factoids just aren't true.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to what we're told, Martha Graham's "Appalachian Spring"
belongs not to the late 1930s but 1944, and George Balanchine's
original choreography for "Slaughter on Tenth Avenue" was never
considered censorable: Indeed, it was filmed by Warner Bros. in 1939,
nine years before Kelly's version.</TE>
<TE>   Trachtenberg goes most off base when trying to exalt Kelly at the
expense of Fred Astaire, who, it should be noted, danced in the rain,
on skates, in a sailor suit, in a dream ballet and with an alter ego
before Kelly re-imagined those effects. Certainly Kelly was "the most
athletic, the most exciting, the most masculine, the most commercial
dancer of his time," in the words of choreographer Kenny Ortega--and
maybe the most ambitious creatively. That ought to be tribute enough.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Gene Kelly: Anatomy of a Dancer" is scheduled tonight at 8 p.m.
and on Sunday at 4 and 9:30 p.m. on KCET-TV.</TE>

<HD>Diva in the Desert</HD>
<DH>Celine Dion will play Caesars Palace in Vegas  five nights
a week for three years for a reported  $100 million. Will other pop
stars follow suit?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"It changed my life and my entire way of thinking about performances
on stage." Celine Dion, whisking along last week in a limousine en
route to the Grammy Awards, was not talking about the recent birth of
her first child or the career rocket of the "Titanic" soundtrack in
1999. Instead, the epiphany arrived two years ago as she sat in a Las
Vegas casino.</LD>
<LD>   And, it turns out, the moment may also reshape the life of the
evolving entertainment scene in the high-rolling desert city.</LD>
<LD>   Dion, who stepped away from the public concert stage on New Year's
Eve 1999 to begin the role of new mother, has agreed to an
unprecedented pact that will see her perform five nights a week for
40 weeks a year over three years at Caesars Palace. The deal is worth
a reported $100 million and will also see the casino resort build a
$95-million, 4,000-seat theater to house the production. The shows,
scheduled to begin next March, will mix the singer's music and an
elaborate theatrical production on a vast, 22,000-square-foot stage.</LD>
<TE>   Dion becomes the only contemporary superstar at the heights of pop
to make such a lengthy commitment to any venue. For Las Vegas, it may
lead to an era of pop stars in residence, the way country singers
have become house acts in Branson, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   The path to this unlikely commitment and destination began when
Dion and Rene Angelil, her husband and manager, sat captivated in the
audience of "O" at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino. "O"  is the
production that channels 1.5 million gallons of water and six dozen
performers into the trademark surrealism and acrobatics of Cirque du
Soleil, the French Canadian theater company. Fellow Canadian Dion saw
in the show a way to create a backdrop to match her own often epic
music.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I wanted to perform and have a visual show like this and
have, like, 60 performers on stage with me and make every song look
like a visual experience," she said during a cell phone interview
from the car. "It's kind of impossible to travel with a show like
this; the effects and the decor and the whole thing makes it
technically impossible. We would have to have a base. And we found
that in Las Vegas."</TE>
<TE>   For Dion, there is some gamble in the Las Vegas enterprise: She
will not be able to tour or do extensive promotion on the road to
help drive album sales and all-important radio airplay. Artistically,
there may be some risk that even her large voice might be lost in the
massive, vibrant swirl of a Cirque du Soleil-style show.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, though, chuckles at those notions. With soft-spoken
confidence he says that Las Vegas is becoming an epicenter of live
entertainment. "Why go to the fans if they will come to you and be
able to see something truly special?"</TE>
<TE>   The eye-opening deal and show plans are another signpost for Las
Vegas and its unique journey as a show-business oasis.</TE>
<TE>   After building a reputation in the '50s and '60s as the glittery
clubhouse of Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack, the casinos' showrooms
featured an expanded superstar roster in the '70s with fixtures such
as Elvis Presley and Tom Jones. But it also became viewed by younger,
edgier artists as a place where an extended stay meant you were a
sellout or in semiretirement.</TE>
<TE>   In more recent years, the bookings of music superstars gave way
somewhat to the special effects and huge cast productions that resort
leaders saw as more defining centerpieces to draw tourists. In the
late '90s, as more money, massive development and the local
population surged, the Strip became a bankable spot for more big-name
pop and rock music, and once unlikely names such as the Rolling
Stones and Bob Dylan  began to appear on casino marquees. These stars
didn't park in one casino for weeks at a time the way Sinatra did,
but they didn't dodge the town anymore either, says Gary Bongiovanni,
editor in chief of Pollstar, a concert business trade publication.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of contemporary music acts, it used to be you lost all
your credibility if you were over there playing lounges or
showrooms," Bongiovanni says. "That's not the case anymore. The very
hippest acts can play there now with no stigma at all."</TE>
<TE>   Bongiovanni says Dion's plan to set up shop in one spot for a
multiyear run may inspire other artists. He points to the success of
the country music scene in Branson as a template: Acts of all levels
of commercial viability can escape the overhead and rigors of
traveling and enjoy a steady stream of fans.</TE>
<TE>   "It can be the best of all worlds for the artist," he said. "In a
way, Celine Dion may be pioneering that in the pop world. And what
better place than Vegas?"</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, the Dion deal raises the stakes of the Vegas music scene,
says Tom Gallagher, president and CEO of Park Place Entertainment,
the gaming industry titan that runs Caesars, Bally's, the Flamingo
and more than two dozen other casino operations in five countries.</TE>
<TE>   "This one," Gallagher says, "really breaks the mold for everything
that has gone on in this town in the past. And that is what we're
trying to do in entertainment over here.... Artists are looking to
get off the road and do something that's more interesting for the
audience and themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Gladys Knight has also just agreed to perform 50 weeks at the
Flamingo (although in a more traditional concert format), suggesting
Gallagher and his company will be looking for more long-term deals
with pop world names.</TE>
<TE>   The Nevada destination may need the help. Business has suffered
from the weak economy, and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 set in
motion a powerful undertow in the city's convention industry. "They
have been getting clobbered," as Bongiovanni puts it.</TE>
<TE>   The deal's announcement also marks the amping up of Dion's return
to the music scene. She taped a performance Sunday night at the Kodak
Theatre in Hollywood for a CBS television special to air next month,
and her first studio album since 1997, "A New Day Has Come," will be
released March 26.</TE>
<TE>   Her son, Rene-Charles Angelil, celebrated his first birthday in
January, and the upcoming commitment to Caesars Palace will allow the
singer to perform for hundreds of thousands of fans without shuttling
her toddler between airports and hotel rooms. The family is building
a new home in the Las Vegas area. Dion, perhaps feeling confined by
the media portrayals of her during her hiatus, says a positive family
situation is a pleasant side effect but not the driving force of the
endeavor.</TE>
<TE>   "When we decided to go to Vegas I was not even pregnant, so don't
get me wrong here," she says. "The first idea of going to Vegas is to
give my fans a No. 1 show.... Of course, if you want to talk about
the family issue, yes it's an incredible thing. It's just wonderful
that mommy can stay home and spend the whole day with the baby and
then go to Caesars for a spectacular show."</TE>
<TE>   The show will be created by Franco Dragone, the guiding hand
behind the dreamy, vibrant Cirque du Soleil productions that have
been successful as touring shows and as two standing attractions in
Las Vegas, "O" and "Mystere" at Treasure Island. After Dion visited
the cast of "O" backstage to express her delight, Dragone followed up
with an admiring note. In short order, Dragone visited the singer's
home in Jupiter, Fla., and the seed was planted for the Caesars
production.</TE>
<TE>   Dion's show will be 90 minutes long, but the specifics of its
content are, like Dragone's acrobats, very much up in the air.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not even there yet," Dion says of a story line. "We're
trying to build every song, and the thread is not completely all
together yet. We're still working on the effects and the beautiful
magic things."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Chamber Music in Historic Sites series served as an escape hatch,
or a cocoon, from everyday madness Sunday afternoon with a
particularly apt combination of sight and sound. This time, the Da
Camera Society of Mount St. Mary's College placed La Musique's
program of French Baroque chamber music in a stately, classically
formal Pasadena replica of Le Petit Trianon, the Versailles garden
pavilion built during Louis XV's reign.</LD>
<LD>   In all honesty, the music could not have swept the listener away
all by itself.</LD>
<LD>   Under the direction of Edward Murray, La Musique gathers together
some experienced early-music players--Ingrid Matthews (Baroque
violin), Courtney Westcott (flute) and William Skeen (viola da
gamba)--who are now based on the West Coast. Despite the atmospheric
allure of the setting, enhanced by a stunningly painted modern
reproduction of an 18th century French harpsichord--the lineup of
five short chamber works by Couperin, Boismortier, Rameau, Marais and
Corrette was mostly of slight interest.</LD>
<TE>   The Quatrieme Concert from Rameau's Pieces de Clavecin en Concerts
was the most brilliant and substantial piece, played with bracingly
fast tempos. Marais' lament for viola da gamba and harpsichord
"Tombeau de Monsieur de St. Colombe," served as a change of pace, and
there was an unlisted, heavily ornamented piece for solo harpsichord,
"Allemande la Labarde," by Forqueray. Violist Jane Levy joined the
quartet in a sometimes scrappy rendition of Corrette's Concerto
Comique No. 25 at the close.</TE>

<HD>Ad Banned, but Smoking on Screen Isn't</HD>

<AU>PATRICK GOLDSTEIN</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If there's anywhere anyone can advertise about anything, it's Variety
and the Hollywood Reporter. In the past few weeks I've spotted ads
for a Greek Cruising Palace yacht rental, cage-free dog kennels, crew
jacket catalogs and--talk about throwing away your money--"for your
consideration" Oscar ads for "Planet of the Apes"</LD>
<LD>   But there's one ad neither of the Hollywood trades will run--the
latest broadside from Smoke Free Movies, a health advocacy group
that's been at the forefront of a no-holds-barred campaign against
the proliferation of cigarette smoking in movies. Led by UC San
Francisco School of Medicine professor Stanton Glantz, a pit
bull-like anti-smoking activist, Smoke Free Movies has run a series
of ads in publications including the New York Times detailing what it
calls Hollywood's "sordid history of trading cash, goods and
publicity" for glamorizing smoking in movies. Citing its studies,
which have found smoking on screen today more frequent than it has
been since the early 1960s, the organization advocates giving an R
rating to any movie that features tobacco use.</LD>
<TE>   Variety ran the organization's earlier ads, including one that
pictured studio chiefs whom Glantz blames for creating a movie
environment that promotes smoking to global audiences. But Variety
rejected the latest Smoke Free Movies ad, which attacked Miramax's
"In the Bedroom" for "gratuitously promoting Marlboro brand
cigarettes," noting that the film's co-star, Sissy Spacek, is seen
specifically asking a grocer in one scene for Marlboro Lights.</TE>
<TE>   Glantz says Variety never voiced a complaint about the ad until an
ABC News reporter who'd interviewed Glantz called Miramax for a
comment on the upcoming ads. "The next day Variety called and said
they wouldn't run the ad," says Glantz. "It's so obvious--I have no
doubt Miramax demanded that they pull the ads. People say that when
we criticize smoking in movies that we're interfering with free
speech, but then Miramax turns around and uses its economic muscle to
basically shut me up."</TE>
<TE>   Glantz says that after ABC News contacted Miramax he received a
phone call from a Miramax publicity executive who told him the "In
the Bedroom" ad could damage the film's Oscar chances. According to
Glantz, the publicist said, "Why don't you pick on 'A Beautiful
Mind'? They smoke in that movie too."</TE>
<TE>   The trades have a history of running advocacy ads pertaining to
specific movies. The day before New Line released "John Q," in which
a desperate dad holds an emergency room hostage when his son is
denied a heart transplant, a health insurance lobbying group bought
full-page ads in both trades blaming Washington for failing to
address the problems of the uninsured.</TE>
<TE>   Variety publisher Charles Koones says Glantz's "In the Bedroom" ad
was a different case. "The ad singled out a particular picture, which
I thought was potentially libelous," he explained. "If it gave five
examples of smoking in the movies, I would've run it."</TE>
<TE>   Koones said he never spoke with Miramax about the ad, an account
supported by the studio. "They had nothing to do with this. It was
totally my call."</TE>
<TE>   After Variety rejected the ad, Glantz went to the Hollywood
Reporter, which also turned it down. The Reporter's associate
publisher Lynn Segall said, "We felt the content and the tone weren't
appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   As to the ad's attack on the film itself and the larger issue of
smoking in the movie, "In the Bedroom" director Todd Field insists
there is nothing gratuitous about the smoking in the film. "When
people grieve, they fall back on old habits, especially in an oral
way," he says. "My dad was a terrible smoker before I convinced him
to quit. But if he lost one of his kids, he'd go back in a heartbeat.
There's nothing glamorous about this behavior. It's a 52-year-old
mother, it's not like the smoking in 'Pulp Fiction.' The ad makes all
sorts of ludicrous accusations--it feels like cultural McCarthyism to
me."</TE>
<TE>   I agree with Field. I wish Glantz had gone after "Charlie's
Angels," a film that features smoking and appeals to kids, not
adults. But the ad controversy highlights an even more troublesome
issue. In an era in which tobacco use is on the decline in virtually
every demographic category in the U.S., why is cigarette smoking
still on the rise in Hollywood films?</TE>
<TE>   Since the landmark 1964 surgeon general's report that linked
smoking to an increased likelihood of disease and early death,
smoking has lost much of its allure. Advertising tobacco brands on TV
has been illegal since 1970. It took Hollywood longer to stop
accepting money in return for cigarette plugs in films. In the
mid-1980s Sylvester Stallone was paid $500,000 to use Brown &amp;
Williamson products in five feature films, according to documents
posted on the Smoke Free Movies Web site. Finally, in 1989, tobacco
firms pledged to stop paying for product placement in films. Most
studios won't even take tobacco products for free today. But
cigarette plugs didn't stop, only the exchange of cash. As recently
as 1991, R.J. Reynolds was paying the heavyweight Hollywood PR firm
Rogers and Cowan $12,500 a month to provide free cigarettes to a slew
of film productions as well as an elite list of stars and industry
leaders, also according to documents on the Smoke Free Movies site.
Judging from films today, the tobacco companies' continuing efforts
to promote smoking have paid off.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when smoking is banned in most public places, tobacco
use is everywhere in movies. You can find stars smoking in three of
the five films nominated for best picture: Spacek, Russell Crowe in
"A Beautiful Mind" and too many actors to count in "Gosford Park."
Gene Hackman and Gwyneth Paltrow smoke up a storm in "The Royal
Tenenbaums"; ditto for Billy Bob Thornton in "The Man Who Wasn't
There," Halle Berry and much of the cast of "Monster's Ball," Ewan
McGregor and others in "Black Hawk Down," John Travolta in
"Swordfish," Cameron Diaz in "Vanilla Sky" and nearly everyone in
"Sexy Beast."</TE>
<TE>   Filmmakers say there are good reasons for characters to puff away.
Crowe starts smoking in "Beautiful Mind" as a visual tip-off to his
descent into schizophrenia. In Adrian Lyne's upcoming film
"Unfaithful," Diane Lane takes up smoking after she has begun an
extramarital affair.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are many examples of celluloid smoking that appear to
have more to do with style than dramatic justification. One producer
speculates that smoking is rampant in films because if there's one
demographic group that smokes more than Virginia tobacco growers,
it's Hollywood actors. Throughout the HBO documentary series "Project
Greenlight," two people are always seen smoking--Matt Damon and Ben
Affleck. One reason Crowe didn't show up in the press room
immediately after winning his Oscar last year is because he had
stepped outside the Shrine Auditorium for a cigarette.</TE>
<TE>   Most studios have no formal smoking guidelines. Warners says it
strongly encourages directors not to portray film heroes as smokers,
but final decisions are left to the filmmakers. Universal has a
"consciousness-raising discussion" with filmmakers about smoking
before a film goes into production. "We don't have any edicts but we
ask our filmmakers to avoid having good or bad characters smoke in a
film," says studio Chairwoman Stacey Snider.</TE>
<TE>   She admits the urgings aren't always effective, since both Julia
Roberts and Crowe, the stars of the studio's two most prestigious
recent films, "Erin Brockovich" and "A Beautiful Mind," are both seen
smoking. "I'm never going to censor ["Erin Brockovich" director]
Steven Soderbergh," says Snider. "But it's important to at least
challenge filmmakers to think about their decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood's leading consciousness raiser has been Lindsay Doran,
producer of "Sense and Sensibility" and a former United Artists
production chief who has recently made anti-smoking presentations at
numerous studios and major production companies. As a young
production exec, she persuaded John Hughes to make his title
character in "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" a nonsmoker.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have a PG-13 film, you know your marketing department is
going to do everything it can to get teenagers to see the movie," she
says. "We know smoking is the all-time leading cause of early death.
So you have to ask yourself, if you're deciding between free speech
and social consciousness, what's more important?"</TE>
<TE>   Doran has been treated with respect by industry execs; she's one
of them. Reaction to Glantz hasn't been so warm. People in Hollywood
resent pushy moral crusaders who criticize their business practices.
When Glantz ran a photo of Warner Bros. chief Barry Meyer in one of
his ads, citing him as a tool of Big Tobacco, a top Warners corporate
publicist called the UCSF School of Medicine to question whether the
publicly supported university knew its funds were being used to
support Glantz's campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Glantz's ads are often obnoxious, but they make a valid point.
It's time for a serious debate about a serious issue. Studies show
that kids who see stars smoking in films are more likely to start
smoking. If my young son were a teenager tomorrow, and you asked me
what movie behavior I'd want him to emulate the least--cursing,
experimenting with sex or smoking cigarettes--puffing on a Marlboro
would win hands down. Yet profanity and sex trigger an R rating from
the Motion Picture Assn. of America, but smoking doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   I'm personally against all ratings and self-censorship, but if the
presence of profanity prevented kids from seeing uplifting films like
"Ali" and "Billy Elliot," then why shouldn't cigarette smoking prompt
the same ratings restrictions? If the MPAA made every movie with
smoking R-rated, shrinking the studios' access to young moviegoers,
the hue and cry about free speech would disappear overnight--99% of
the smoking in movies would evaporate.</TE>
<TE>   Glantz has an even more modest idea worth adopting: putting
anti-tobacco ads on the front of movies that feature smoking. Studies
have shown that when it's been tried it has a considerable immunizing
effect on young moviegoers. The film industry has been a generous
supporter of all sorts of good causes, from promoting
designated-driver campaigns and education reform to fighting global
warming. But tobacco use isn't a problem on some faraway Alaskan oil
field. It's right here at home, on every studio back lot. Maybe now
is the time to do something about it.</TE>

<HD>A Director's Spin on Hip-Hop Deejays</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GINA PICCALO AND LOUISE ROUG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Documentary director Doug Pray stood in the middle of Amoeba Music in
Hollywood and surveyed the warehouse-like vastness of albums and
music paraphernalia around him. "I don't even know where to begin,"
he said.</LD>
<LD>   It was Thursday night and Pray wore baggy nylon pants, athletic
shoes and a zippered jacket, an outfit that belies his age (41) but
not his profession. He is the director of "Scratch," a new
documentary that explores the origins and culture of hip-hop
deejaying. It's an art form, Pray said, that is often overshadowed by
the rap artist.</LD>
<LD>   Pray headed for the hip-hop section of the store, an aisle
populated by several young men in baggy clothes and baseball caps.
His fingers worked over the CDs, landing on DJ Swamp. This guy, Pray
said, has been known to smash a record onto his turntable and then
use it to cut himself until he bleeds. "He reminds me of old-school
punk rock," Pray said.</LD>
<TE>   He found other favorites: the Beat Junkies, DJ Qbert, Rob Swift
and the X-Ecutioners. DJ Babu is "a little godlike," he said. Mix
Master Mike is "this quiet genius who started it all." Gangstarr are
"the kings of underground hip-hop" who always feature their deejay on
their album covers.</TE>
<TE>   Then Pray found a CD by a deejay who didn't make it into the
documentary: DJ Prince Paul. "If I could've interviewed him, I would
have died and gone to heaven," he said. A young man standing nearby
nodded his approval. "Prince Paul is dope," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pray knew very little about the genre when he started filming
"Scratch" three years ago. He was a rock music fan from Madison,
Wis., who got his start directing music videos and earned fame in
1995 for directing "Hype!," an irreverent history of grunge. In 1999,
he was noticed for his editing on "American Pimp," a documentary
about the men who drive prostitution.</TE>
<TE>   Producers Brad Blondheim and Ernest Meza talked Pray into
directing "Scratch." Soon after, Pray was knee-deep in hip-hop
records. These days, he speaks with reverence when he refers to the
masters of craft. "I think people have a real limited idea of what
hip-hop deejaying is," Pray said. "It's an incredible skill. It's
like being a librarian and knowing every passage in every book."</TE>
<TE>   Then he wandered off to do some more digging.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Leonardo Portraits</TE>
<TE>   On a recent night at the UCLA Hammer Museum in Westwood, patrons
picked at breadsticks artfully displayed on tables alongside grass
and concrete building blocks. Deejay Nmandi Moweta was spinning
Afrobeat tunes as guests bobbed their heads knowingly to the music.</TE>
<TE>   Upstairs, in the Vault Gallery, visitors studied a familiar face:
Leonardo DiCaprio.</TE>
<TE>   Artist Amy Adler, 35, drew six pastel portraits of the actor from
photos shot when he visited her London apartment last year, an unreal
experience, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The enormity of his fame," she said, "made him the perfect
character for the project."</TE>
<TE>   Adler often makes portraits of actors and musicians, usually
working from magazine photos and publicity stills to comment on
celebrity, identity and mass communication. Her session with DiCaprio
was her first use of a "live" celebrity--a moment of "manufactured"
intimacy, as well as a dream come true. It's difficult to imagine a
celebrity like DiCaprio would drop by for a chat, said Adler. "It's a
great analysand fantasy."</TE>
<TE>   Claudine Ise, an assistant curator at the Hammer, explained that
Adler's work revolves around the notion of absence versus presence.
As part of the project, Adler said, she destroyed all her original
sketches and photos from the session with DiCaprio, thereby further
removing the viewer from the encounter and making the "mega
celebrity" even more remote.</TE>
<TE>   Appropriately, DiCaprio was absent from the reception. His
likeness, though, was omnipresent.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Writing Awards</TE>
<TE>   Even among his peers at the Writers Guild of America's annual
awards dinner Saturday, Aaron Sorkin wasn't spared from several
rounds of ribbing.</TE>
<TE>   Comic Jeffrey Ross, emceeing the show, quipped during his opening
remarks that in the wake of Sept. 11, "Security is at an all-time
high--and so is Aaron Sorkin, nominated for 'best score'"--a
reference to "The West Wing" auteur's much-publicized drug problems,
which included his arrest at Burbank Airport last year.</TE>
<TE>   Later, veteran comic Hal Kantor noted that because Sorkin writes
virtually every episode of his NBC show, "some freelancers regard him
as a brilliant, greedy pig." Kantor did go on to laud Sorkin,
however, for a recently published interview in which he said the
media has in essence given a free pass to President  Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Sorkin, who attended the event, was a nominee in the dramatic
series category but lost to an episode of HBO's "The Sopranos."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Casey, a co-creator of "Frasier," accepted an award at the
Beverly Hilton Hotel ceremony on behalf of his former partner, the
late David Angell, who was on one of the two planes that crashed into
the World Trade Center. "The only thing that would make us happier"
than receiving the honor for Angell, Casey said, "is if he were here
to accept it himself."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Clinton in Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   Never one to shun the spotlight, President  Clinton will once
again return to Hollywood. This time, he is set to be the keynote
speaker at the Natural Resources Defense Council's fund-raiser May 10
at the Wadsworth Theatre in Brentwood. Tom Hanks is scheduled to
emcee and Steve Martin is set to deliver a rare stand-up performance.
The NRDC hopes to raise more than $1 million with the event.</TE>

<LD>   28 of the Best Children's Books and How to Use Them to Help Your
Child Learn--From Preschool to 3rd Grade</LD>
<LD>   By Peggy Kaye</LD>
<TE>   Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux</TE>
<TE>   256 pages; $16</TE>
<TE>   Of the myriad factors that affect a child's potential to excel in
school, two of the most influential are whether the child is read to
on a regular basis and whether  the child  has access to good books.
Children who develop an early passion for reading, almost as a rule,
go on to meet or exceed educational expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Talk to adults who are avid readers and most will fondly remember
being read to as a child. What can compare to facing one's greatest
fears while cuddled in the lap of an adult? Together, with an older,
comforting presence, children explore the monster within by reading
Maurice Sendak's "Where the Wild Things Are," they encounter and
overcome the wretched teacher Mrs. Trunchbull in Roald Dahl's
terrifyingly delightful "Matilda," face their fears of being lost in
a dark forest with A.A. Milne's "Winnie-the-Pooh" and consider the
problems of being tiny in a big person's world in E.B. White's
"Stuart Little."</TE>
<TE>   "Games With Books" is a how-to volume for getting the most
educational bang for your reading-time buck when it comes to
children. The text joins the ranks of the seminal "Read-Aloud
Handbook" by Jim Trelease  and provides food for thought regarding
what children learn from time spent with books. Written and
illustrated by Peggy Kaye ("Games for Writing," "Games for Learning")
the book is divided into two sections: "How to Play With Picture
Books," designed for those working with preschool through first-grade
children, and "How to Play With Chapter Books," for use with older
children, up to third grade.</TE>
<TE>   Kaye has selected 28 of the most-loved children's books as the
basis for her games, relying heavily on classics such as Dr. Seuss'
"The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins," E.B. White's "Charlotte's Web"
and Crockett Johnson's "Harold and the Purple Crayon." There are a
few recent titles--Susan Meddaugh's 1996 "Martha Blah Blah," for
example--but most  are long-standing favorites.</TE>
<TE>   Though the author stresses the importance of reading to children,
her focus is primarily on how to extend the reading experience to
help them develop basic skills in math, writing, creative thinking
and problem-solving.</TE>
<TE>   For example, using Michael Bond's "A Bear Called Paddington," she
demonstrates  ways to springboard off the story. Paddington the bear
shows a knack for getting himself into sticky situations and in one
key scene uses shaving cream to write on the bathroom mirror. Kaye,
who works as a private tutor with young children struggling in
school, invents a game to help Billy, a boy who refuses to write.</TE>
<TE>   After reading "Paddington" to him, she sprays shaving cream onto a
large baking tray and encourages Billy to form letters and words in
the cream. This child, who hates writing when it involves pencil and
paper, is more than willing to try the shaving cream method.</TE>
<TE>   Kaye re-creates her experience with Billy, showing us how to do
similar things with our children. After Billy forms a number of
words, though, his interest begins to wane. Not to worry. Kaye sparks
his continued fascination by adding food coloring to the cream. Soon
he's writing words in red, then adding yellow and learning about
making new colors.</TE>
<TE>   Once he develops confidence in his ability to make words in the
cream, he's more willing to try the same thing on paper. In similar
ways, Kaye encourages parents and teachers to make applesauce, speak
a version of pig Latin and play charades.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the authorial tone Kaye employs is overly simple
and, at times, a bit worrisome. She reminds readers regularly, for
instance, that children need help to be imaginative and that parents
often require assistance to know how to play with them.</TE>
<TE>   If these statements are accurate, and they  well may be, they
raise huge concerns about our society and parenting. Plus, her
emphasis in this book on reading as a tool leading to other forms of
learning, though pragmatic, downplays the sheer joy to be found in
reading for pleasure.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Kaye's background working with problem learners skews her
approach so that each reading experience is seen as a tool to solve
other issues--getting a child to count, to recognize letters of the
alphabet--rather than as a delightful exploration into a child's
natural curiosity.</TE>
<TE>   The games Kaye presents are creative and will aid parents and
teachers who wish to use reading time as a tool to other forms of
learning. The hazard, though, is that we might mistake the means for
the ends.</TE>
<TE>   Engendering a love of books--reading as pleasure--is something to
be celebrated in its own right. With games or without, simply reading
with children is still one of the most effective educational tools
available.</TE>

<LD>When the Pentagon is at war, it comes up with some nifty ideas. The
latest one was the Office of Strategic Influence. Its role was to
coordinate public press releases and to plant false information with
friends and foes alike.</LD>
<LD>   The brass thought it was a neat idea until the American public
found out about it. (Again, blame the media.) The uproar was so loud
that Don Rumsfeld, the most trusted man in government, had to deny
that the Pentagon Office of Influence would tell lies and spread
misleading misinformation, whichever came first.</LD>
<LD>   Ordinarily that would be enough for me, as Rumsfeld has such an
honest face. But then I started to think--suppose the Secretary of
Defense was putting out the denial at the request of the Office of
Strategic Influence?</LD>
<TE>   Was Rumsfeld sending up a trial balloon to find out if North
Korea, Iran and Iraq, the notorious "axis of evil," would buy it?</TE>
<TE>   The reaction was so negative that the secretary of Defense, at the
urging of the president, decided, after a week, to shut down the
office. This does not mean that the Pentagon will stop putting out
fibs. It will simply manipulate its misinformation under other names.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first time the United States has trafficked in
misinformation. It has always been the CIA's job, and it is very
upset that someone is moving in on its territory.</TE>
<TE>   I know this for a fact, because when I lived in Europe, some of
the top CIA agents were planting misinformation behind and in front
of the Iron Curtain.</TE>
<TE>   This is how it worked: Langley Headquarters would fabricate a
story that the Hungarians were selling rotten potatoes to Poland. The
furious Poles would be so mad they'd start selling rotten tomatoes to
the Hungarians. Both countries would begin calling up their reserves.</TE>
<TE>   When it was shaped up, the story was cabled to a CIA agent in
Paris who planted it with a reporter from l'Humaniti, the French
Communist paper.</TE>
<TE>   It was then read by the Washington Post correspondent in
Yugoslavia and cabled back to the United States and printed as a
factual dispatch.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, a high-ranking official at the State Department
in Washington woke up and read that the Hungarians and Poles might go
to war over rotten potatoes and rotten tomatoes. He called a meeting
of the Hungarian-Polish Ad Hoc Committee and they discussed the role
the United States should play. As a precaution, they advocated
calling up the NATO airborne Special Forces team to guard the
Hungarian-Polish border.</TE>
<TE>   Unbeknownst to State, it was Langley that had put the game into
play, and through their misinformation plot, had almost started World
War III.</TE>
<TE>   This was always the danger of the Pentagon having its people in
the propaganda business. Everyone is aware that no one in the
Pentagon knows what the other people are doing, but by lying, it
would have the ability to launch planes, tanks and ships before
learning what the true situation was. Patriotic Americans would stop
believing in what their leaders were telling them.</TE>
<TE>   So far, we're telling the truth about Osama bin Laden's
whereabouts. We are saying we don't know, and everyone is buying it.</TE>
<TE>   But if the Pentagon says, at a military briefing, that it knows
where he is, everyone will ask, "Then why don't we kill the SOB?"</TE>
<TE>   Trying to influence people in war can get everyone working in
government into a lot of trouble. But again, Donald Rumsfeld has
saved the day by telling the truth.</TE>

<LD>Memo to Mattel: Thin is not in.</LD>
<LD>   The hottest doll at last month's International Toy Festival in New
York doesn't have a super-spunky kid sister, a townhouse or a shiny
pink sports car. But she does come equipped with something Barbie
doesn't have: hips.</LD>
<LD>   Emme, the plus-size model who made it more than OK for cover girls
to be a size 12, is bringing an industry not known for positive body
images up to size. Tonner Doll Co. last week introduced a toy created
in the image of Emme.</LD>
<TE>   The doll's designer, Robert Tonner, would rather talk about the
beauty and timeless style of Emme (the person) than the messy issues
surrounding feminism, Barbie and eating disorders. Tonner, a former
Bill Blass designer and doll collector, said he created the Emme
look-alike after being swept away by the model's appearance on a talk
show. If he's out to make any statement, it's more "Emme is
beautiful" than "Big is beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   Intentional or not, the Barbie versus Emme comparison is hard to
ignore. For 50 years, an impossibly proportioned figure has reigned
in the fashion-doll aisle. So when a size 12 joins her on the shelf,
it's got to make some waves. While her plastic counterpart might not
make any political statements, the life-sized Emme is anything but
silent on the subject: "Barbie needs some new friends ... and they
need to be in all different shapes and sizes and colors."</TE>
<TE>   Emme was the first model to speak to these issues before a
congressional subcommittee. She's chair ambassador of the National
Eating Disorders Assn., which will receive a portion of proceeds from
sales of the Emme doll.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, it is just a doll, but it's a chance to open the doll
industry to the idea of inclusiveness," Emme says. "Don't you think
that girls who play with dolls would include all types if there were
any available? They're not the ones who think all dolls should be
blond, blue-eyed and thin. That's introduced to them."</TE>
<TE>   The collectible Emme doll is 16 inches tall, costs between $79 and
$100, depending on her accessories, and will be available in the
fall. Tonner also plans to add smaller (not thinner) Emme dolls in
lower price ranges.</TE>
<TE>   While Emme is the first plus-size doll, she's not the first doll
to challenge Barbie. Another line, Get Real Girl dolls ($19.99 at
toysrus.com and kbtoys.com), is prepared for adventure. Each of the
six, nearly 12-inch tall "reality" dolls comes with action gear,
including snowboards, surfboards and scuba equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The plus-size Emme doll was introduced last week and will be
available later this year.</TE>

<LD>It only confirmed what the average Joe has known all along--that for
every $2 fee extracted at the ATM, somewhere a group of bank
executives is whooping it up on Chateaubriand, big fat Cubans and
champagne cocktails. All on the company's dime.</LD>
<LD>   Only in this case it wasn't just champagne cocktails, it was also
five bottles of wine, the cheapest of which ran $2,000, the most
expensive, a breathtaking $17,500. Days after the $62,700 bar bill
was paid at London's high-end Petrus (the restaurant was so impressed
it didn't even charge for the six dinners that accompanied the wine),
it was the talk of the financial district.</LD>
<LD>   Several months later, five of the six freewheeling Barclay's Bank
investment bankers, who had initially claimed they were paying their
own epicurean way, were caught trying to sneak the bill onto their
company expense accounts. They got the heave-ho from Barclay's, and
their exploits were soon the talk of the States. Because who doesn't
love a good expense-account story?</LD>
<TE>   In the corporate world, such tales are as common, and as epic, as
the fish story. Who hasn't heard the one about the man who expensed
his 3-year-old's $20,000 birthday party or the woman who submitted
her Vera Wang wedding dress because she had invited a few clients to
the nuptials? Some of the stories end in disgrace--the leader of
Scotland's Parliament recently resigned when it was discovered he had
been claiming expenses to cover the costs of an office he was then
subletting--but most of them do not.</TE>
<TE>   And that, along with the almost farcical amount of the bankers'
bill--forget the $13,000 dessert wine, they paid seven bucks for a
pack of cigarettes--is what makes the Barclay's story so compelling.</TE>
<TE>   Padding expense reports is as time-honored as cheating on taxes.
George Washington famously refused to take a salary as general of the
Continental Army, but he racked up some $449,000 in expenses during
eight years of service, which works out to more than $4 million
today. The mostly un-itemized expenses submitted to the Continental
Congress included $3,776 for "sundry Exp.'s paid ... on the Retreat
of the Army thro' the Jerseys into Pennsylvania."</TE>
<TE>   While few modern-day toilers admit to doing it themselves, almost
everyone knows of "this one guy" who was absolutely fearless when it
came to toting up those Travel and Entertainment columns. (Although
no one was willing to have their name used when recounting these
tales for fear of career reprisals.) A former financial officer at a
Fortune 500 company said he saw reimbursement requests for "customer
entertainment" that included $500 for an outing to a strip club and
$2,500 for Super Bowl tickets. A mid-level investment firm executive
remembered weekend fishing getaways with clients that ran $10,000. A
salesman for an East Coast tech company knew a supervisor who
organized a spur-of-the-moment gambling trip to Bermuda that set the
company back $25,000.</TE>
<TE>   A former oil company executive told of colleagues who expensed
their daily work commutes and of one regional manager who submitted
such high mileage requests that, upon review, it was discovered that
there simply were not enough hours in the day for him to have driven
as far as he had claimed.</TE>
<TE>   In journalism, the examples are even more colorful: the East Coast
magazine editors rumored to expense their Armani and Prada. The food
writer who believed a $400 bottle of Merlot was necessary in his
quest to find the perfect hamburger. The freelancer who, while doing
a story on a sporting event in Thailand, tried to expense a trip to a
local brothel.</TE>
<TE>   Though such expenses are far from routine, people submit them
because they usually get away with it. When challenged about costs,
the supervisor who led the Bermuda excursion righteously defended his
decision. "I just brought in $5 million in business," he said,
according to an eyewitness. "Shut up."</TE>
<TE>   "It really comes down to discretion," said the former Fortune 500
financial officer. "You take it on a case-by-case basis. What kind of
customer are we talking about? How outrageous is the expense? How
much business do we do with them? The fact is there really aren't any
hard and fast rules with expense accounts."</TE>
<TE>   But most companies do have an auditing system. For almost three
years, Jeanette Ourada was the international audit manager for Arco
before it was acquired by British Petroleum. And the first thing she
always did upon arrival at one of the company's far-flung offices was
ask to see the personal expense accounts.</TE>
<TE>   "The dollar amount is small," she said, "but if there's abuse
there, there's probably going to be abuse everywhere. Expense
accounts are the canary in the coal mine."</TE>
<TE>   (Her analysis is certainly borne out at Enron, the new model of
corporate fraud and dysfunction. When President Jeffrey K. Skilling
took over last year, one of his first decisions was to approve all
expense accounts without review.)</TE>
<TE>   The fraud Ourada discovered over the years ran from the sublime to
the ridiculous. At one point during the sale of Arco to British
Petroleum, she said, there was something like $17 million in employee
moving advances unaccounted for. "We tried to track everyone down,"
she said, "but there were two sets of books at that point, and it was
very confusing. I remember one very high-level executive saying to
me, "Try to prove that I got that money. Just try.' I was really
shocked at that."</TE>
<TE>   And, at that point, it took a lot to shock her. She had already
seen a daughter's piano lessons expensed, and a spouse's tennis pro;
she had seen receipts for mountain bikes and birthday presents. One
supervisor had expensed the cleaning of his pool.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the perpetrators got off with a warning and Ourada
acknowledged how easy it is to cheat. Prevention works better than
detection, she said; now a financial executive at Universal Studios,
she routinely calls her employees to ask about an item or two, "just
so they know that I am actually looking at them."</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, there's a good reason for lavish expense
accounts--clients like to be wooed, stellar employees like to be
rewarded, and wooing and rewarding doesn't come cheap. But according
to fraud investigators, most padding is not about a desire to
achieve. It's about greed.</TE>
<TE>   "People love to spend other people's money," said Craig L. Greene,
a fraud investigator and partner with Chicago-based Rome Associates.</TE>
<TE>   Employees at all levels also see expense reports as an opportunity
to even the scales, he said. Someone didn't get the raise she wanted
so she takes it out in mileage or in really nice dinners.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd be surprised how many executives, I mean top executives,
think they are special and that they are only taking back what is
owed them," said Greene, who has written extensively for accounting
journals about falsified expense reports.</TE>
<TE>   According to Ourada, employees also just get used to a certain
level of perks. An executive who flies first class internationally
finds it impossible to fly business domestically, a negotiator who is
put up at a posh hotel while closing a big deal then expects
five-star treatment all the time. "It is amazing how quickly people
get used to being treated well," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The most ubiquitous form of fraud Ourada saw, she said, involved a
supervisor asking an underling to submit the supervisor's expenses,
which the supervisor then approved. But fudging comes in all
varieties. According to Greene, trading in a first-class ticket for
coach and pocketing the difference is easy and popular, as is
counterfeiting receipts, or simply buying blank receipts at an office
supply store and filling them in. Greene said one vice president at a
Fortune 500 company fabricated receipts in this manner to the tune of
$40,000.</TE>
<TE>   Modern technology, which now includes electronic expense filing,
has made it easier for companies to track employee reports and has no
doubt discouraged the filing of some bogus expense reports, Greene
said. But a machine is no replacement for human supervision, he
added.</TE>
<TE>   "Employees have to know someone is watching the store," he said.
"And they have to know there will be consequences."</TE>
<TE>   Consequences for low-level employees who commit expense report
fraud usually means termination. In the past, companies have shied
away from prosecuting executives, even those who may have taken
hundreds of thousands of dollars, fearing bad publicity and legal
costs that could exceed the amount stolen. Typically, wayward
executives are persuaded to make some form of restitution and then
are quietly dismissed, Greene said.</TE>
<TE>   But after the Enron scandal, that may be changing, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If the worst thing you are going to do is fire people, they are
going to keep stealing from you," Greene said. "You want to send a
message? Throw a couple of executives in jail."</TE>
<TE>   The Barclay bankers, meanwhile, are updating their resumes and
living down the inevitable "and can you bring the wine?" jokes. They
initially threatened to sue Petrus for invading their privacy, but
that prospect seems to have faded--it's a restaurant, after all, not
a doctor's office or a confessional. Still, the owner claims he
wasn't the one who alerted the media, although he did save the now
famous receipt as a memento. And a few phone calls to various local
upscale eateries, including the Ivy, Campanile and Matsuhisa,
revealed that there is not now, nor has there ever been, similarly
outrageous expense-account spending in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   And you can take that to the bank.</TE>

<LD>Have you ever wondered how far polar bears can swim, how big they
grow or how they keep warm? Well, keep reading and you'll soon be an
expert on them.</LD>
<LD>   Fun Facts About Polar Bears</LD>
<LD>   * Polar bears are the biggest meat-eating land animals in the
world.</LD>
<TE>   * A male polar bear can grow to weigh 2,000 pounds and stretch
111/2 feet from nose to tail.</TE>
<TE>   * Their small heads, long necks and long front legs make them
built for swimming, and their giant feet work as paddles and are even
webbed like a duck's feet.</TE>
<TE>   * Polar bears can swim up to 60 miles without stopping, and they
can hold their breath underwater for two minutes.</TE>
<TE>   * Polar bears have black skin underneath their white fur. Black
absorbs more heat from the sun and helps them keep warm.</TE>
<TE>   * Polar bears also have hollow, air-filled hairs that hold warm
air close to their bodies.</TE>
<TE>   * When it gets really cold and windy, polar bears dig out a
shelter in the snow and curl up into a ball to stay warm.</TE>
<TE>   If you want to learn more cool stuff about polar bears, visit the
Detroit Zoo's Web site at www.detroitzoo.org. Or if you're visiting
Michigan, make sure to stop by and see the polar bears at the new
Arctic Ring of Life exhibit.</TE>

<LD>* We have freedoms, and people are treated equally. I also like how
white people can't buy black people. I like how blacks can no longer
go to jail just because they sit in the front of a bus.</LD>
<LD>   Also, I like how we can have any job we want. I love how blacks
can go to any restaurant, bathroom or drinking fountain. I also love
how all children can go to school no matter if they are boys or
girls.</LD>
<LD>   --Tabatha, 9, Bassett Street</LD>

<TE>   * America gives you privileges that no other country has. It
allows you to have freedom of speech and clothing. In Afghanistan,
women were forced to wear black dresses that covered their whole body
and face. It was illegal to speak badly about the Taliban. Our other
privilege in America is being protected by Earth's greatest army.
That's important to me because protection is needed for survival. If
you add it all up, you are lucky to be an American.</TE>
<TE>   --Erik, 9, New River</TE>

<TE>   --Brian, 10, Oakmont</TE>
<TE>   Elementary, Claremont</TE>
<TE>   * I love our freedom. We can be who we want to be. We have a
strong country. As President Bush has said, "Terrorist attacks can
shake the foundations of our biggest buildings, but they cannot touch
the foundation of America."</TE>
<TE>   --Angela, 12, Warner-Walker</TE>
<TE>   Elementary, San Diego</TE>
<TE>   * I love America because of our freedoms. Everyone is accepted in
this nation of mixed religions and mixed cultures. This makes America
special. I am proud to be an American, to be free and well educated.
America is a young nation that has already succeeded in being a role
model to other countries.</TE>

<HD>Return of the Sexy Beast</HD>
<DH>Dominating the runways: a strong and alluring woman with a
hard edge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOOTH MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MILAN--The last time the fashion flock gathered here, in early
October, the Sept. 11 attacks were still on the mind, and escapist
fare came in the form of soft, frothy looks. This time around,
conscious or not, designers showing during the first days of the
Italian fall collections are projecting the image of a woman who is
strong, hardened and doesn't believe in fairy tales. She's no
romantic, but she is sexy.</LD>
<LD>   "Fashion swings," Gucci's Tom Ford said before his show on
Saturday. "You hear enough soft music and you want something hard."
The brash babe is back.</LD>
<LD>   To the tune of Stevie Nicks' ode to the Celtic goddess Rhiannon,
Ford's models bounded down a white fur-covered runway, wearing
stilettos so fierce that they sent one poor girl tumbling to the
ground three times in a scene reminiscent of Carrie's ill-fated
catwalk turn in "Sex and the City."</LD>
<TE>   But if there's anything we've learned in the past few months, it's
that the show must go on. And it did, with Ford's oversized wool wrap
coats, boxy jackets and bulky sweaters texturized with pieces of
leather and fur casting a wide "don't mess with me" swath. Paired
with skin-tight pants that bunched down over the shoes, or
pencil-thin skirts, the high-profile tops made for a powerful
V-shaped silhouette.</TE>
<TE>   Ford stuck to a dark palette of chocolate brown, olive, burgundy
and black, with a minimum of tailoring, and continued to build on his
Asian theme from last season, wrapping smart, silk jacquard print obi
belts around the waists of everything from fur jackets to sleeveless
silk dresses. For the red carpet set, he draped the body in silk,
twisting strips of fabric down the back, around the hips, up over the
breasts and across the shoulders to create a group of sexy gowns that
were the stuff of Greek sculpture.</TE>
<TE>   Ebony onyx crosses were worn on cords around the neck, and the new
bag was large, rectangular and crocodile, with hand-polished wooden
handles lending an exotic feel.</TE>
<TE>   In one of her most provocative collections to date, Miuccia Prada
said she explored man's obsession with sex. Models' slicked-back
ponytails, killer high heels and leather envelope clutches screamed
sex in the office, as did a sheer lavender bow-neck blouse, which
could have been business-appropriate had it been worn with something
underneath.</TE>
<TE>   Brown and black silk, fur or tweed baseball jackets and oversized
wool cardigans belted over straight skirts were a nod to how alluring
a woman can be when she wears men's clothing. On the softer side,
beige or black knife-pleat silk skirts and sleeveless dresses with
leather cords cinched around the waist under the bust and at the hips
again suggested Greek sculpture, or at least Madame Gres.</TE>
<TE>   An attempt to use illusion fabric on backless dresses and blouses
with plunging necklines missed the mark, looking awkward on the body.
And a group of lingerie looks with chain-link overlays proposed as
evening wear went a bit too far. She didn't need it; there were
already plenty of turn-ons, including, in the most likely to be
imitated and make it to the mall category, peek-a-boo clear plastic
trench coats shown over immensely wearable black sequined skirts.
Prada's use of color, from mustard yellow and blush pink to lavender
and rich navy blue, was also marvelous.</TE>
<TE>   Dolce &amp; Gabbana continued to dabble in last season's folkloric
look, presenting a collection they dubbed rustic glam. "It's all
about a return to family values and craftsmanship," Stefano Gabbana
said before the show. (That is, if your family values involve
chinchilla-lined hunting vests and eel-skin clogs.)</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, excitement at the show was palpable at the sight of
Giselle Bundchen on the runway for the first time this season, along
with catwalk vet Naomi Campbell. Under the sheltering limbs of a tree
that had been shipped from southern Italy, the designers offered
their vision of roughing it: winter white corduroy pants worn with
brown waistcoats and silk cameo-print georgette blouses,
menswear-tailored velvet pantsuits and a cream-colored sweater dress
that unraveled on Bundchen's backside. Scarves with a hand-knit look,
so long they skimmed the ankles, appeared here, as elsewhere, hinting
at what could be again the accessory of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Shearling coats and tall leather boots were embellished with
hammered nails and other details such as exquisite butterfly and
flower-shaped appliques. A sumptuous sweater of knitted mink, a
fringed wool poncho and skirt and a cashmere tube top worn over a
sexy lace camisole completed the picture of a woman ready for the
wilderness, or at least the ski lodges of St. Moritz.</TE>
<TE>   Max Mara worked a similar palette of cream, brown and black,
presenting a collection headlined by wearable coats in every shape
and size. Wool wraparounds, chevron-print fur blouson jackets with
hoods and Nanook of the North shearling vests worn with tailored wool
pants or leggings tucked into high boots may not be anything new, but
they could easily make their way into almost any woman's closet.</TE>
<TE>   It was when Max Mara veered from the classics that there was
trouble. Wool culottes, ending at the top of a boot, which turned up
in other shows as well, may or may not find their way off the runway
(they may be just too silly). A suede coat and dress in a patchwork
of geometric shapes looked tired, as did sheer, gold metallic tunics
belted over leggings and short skirts, and a group of evening
separates covered in peacock feathers brought to mind fishing tackle.</TE>
<TE>   The Fendi show had so much fur shaped into tank dresses,
midriff-baring tops, vests, stoles and coats that it could only be
described as a slaughter. Even for someone without strong feelings
about fur, the over-the-top opulence of a runway-length cape as big
as the beast it came from didn't feel quite right for the times.
There were some handsome shearling coats and a dress or two in
leather so supple that it could just as well have been silk, but
that's where the kudos end.</TE>
<TE>   As for secondary lines, so far, they've ranged from refreshing to
ridiculous. Donatella Versace's Versus line was a welcome splash of
color in a week dominated by dark neutrals, with leather and
sheepskin jackets in delicate pastels, and pencil skirts emblazoned
with an acid-bright alphabet print, worn over corduroys, ruched
velvet pants or jeans.</TE>
<TE>   Moschino's Cheap and Chic couldn't decide what it wanted to be.
Equestrian jackets, breeches and a one-shouldered Liberty print dress
looked very Sloane Street, but patchwork pants and an
off-the-shoulder crocheted sweater was more Holly Hobby.
Unfortunately, neither look was particularly compelling.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was D&amp;G in the "what were they thinking" camp. On a
dirt floor with two plastic Holsteins for runway centerpieces, Dolce
&amp; Gabbana offered the milkmaid look--embroidered dirndl skirts,
peasant blouses and corset tops that were totally Tyrolean.</TE>
<TE>   You have to give it to them-- it takes a lot of guts to present a
collection to an audience of blood-thirsty fashion types with the
smell of dung hanging in the air. Then again, maybe the joke was on
us.</TE>

<HD>Talking About 'Monologues' Is Harder in Real Life Than on
Stage</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Mom is going to be in a play," I said. "'The Vagina Monologues.'"</LD>
<LD>   I had spent days deciding how to tell my sons, ages 9 and 12.</LD>
<LD>   First, I thought, I would be subtle and talk of women's rights and
build up to how proud I was to be able to stand on a stage and speak
empowering words.</LD>
<TE>   I had thought it would be best to sit them down at a coffee
shop--a public place where the rules of budding adolescence would
preclude any public displays. But when the moment of truth came,
pushed by the need to rearrange some plans so I could make a
rehearsal, I just blurted it out.</TE>
<TE>   "What?! I can't believe you just said that," said Bryan, laughing
and backing away. "Mom! Jeez."</TE>
<TE>   Zachary, the younger, laughed. "I'm too young to hear this."</TE>
<TE>   Feeling defensive, I said, "You're never too young to learn about
women. But seriously, that's the name of the play and it's about ..."</TE>
<TE>   At that point, they were long gone.</TE>
<TE>   Still, I was very excited to be one of about 40 women invited to
take part in the benefit production of "The Vagina Monologues" at the
Harold Washington Library in Chicago last month, one of 150 held as
part of the V-Day Worldwide Campaign. The goal was not only to raise
money but to remind us at Valentine's that flowers won't cut it until
women and girls are safe from violence and sexual slavery.</TE>
<TE>   The movement began in 1998, founded by Eve Ensler, who wrote "The
Vagina Monologues." The money collected from the Chicago show went to
the Chicago Foundation for Women and the Lesbian Community Cancer
Project.</TE>
<TE>   I had reservations about performing. Not because I would have to
stand in front of 400 people and say "vagina." My problem was telling
people, particularly the ones I want to know more than anyone--the
women I visit each week in the Back of the Yards neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   They are associated with the Second Chance Alternative Public High
School. Most were in a gang, many had children as teens, many have
done drugs, all dropped out of school. But by choosing to go back to
school, they have committed themselves to a different life. For the
past two years, I've joined them for their reflection group, where we
talk about life, write, read and try to have fun.</TE>
<TE>   They are beautiful and brave. I could tell them that in the U.S.,
a woman is battered every 15 seconds. But they have lived the
statistics. Their stories would match the tragic ones in Ensler's
play.</TE>
<TE>   But they are not there yet. Not ready to discuss their bodies and
their lives with other people. Or maybe I am not there yet.</TE>
<TE>   At this moment, it would seem a cruel discussion because sexuality
is difficult to discuss when it has been robbed from you.</TE>
<TE>   The V-Day movement aims to change its name some day to Victory
Over Violence Day. But I have a much simpler goal: I would settle for
being able to laugh, as I do with my boys, during a discussion of
vaginas and sex with 15 great young women in the Back of the Yards.</TE>

<HD>Group Weaves a Social Conscience Into Rug Making</HD>
<DH>Foundation tries to protect child workers in places such as
Nepal and Pakistan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA HALES</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Interior design makes an unlikely companion for social activism. But
the era of globalization has linked the two with tiny hand-tied
knots. A rug cannot be beautiful if you know it was made with a
child's forced labor.</LD>
<LD>   Unless, of course, you don't mind leaving your footprints in an
innocent's sweat and blood.</LD>
<LD>   As First World prosperity collides with Third World poverty,
fashion brands such as Nike and the Gap have been blistered by
controversies over foreign sweatshops. Now, it's the turn of the
age-old rug-making business.</LD>
<TE>   Demand for beauty on our floors provides desperately needed
employment in rural villages in India, Pakistan and Nepal. No one
doubts that Afghanistan's revival will prove challenging.</TE>
<TE>   But who is tending the looms, under what conditions, and how will
you know? And if you know, how much will you care?</TE>
<TE>   At the Phillips Collection, art patrons can peer guilt-free at the
paintings. That's because the pale green or gold or apricot rugs
underfoot have been certified by their maker to be slave-labor-free.</TE>
<TE>   The Phillips, like the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, chose
its carpets from the company founded by Stephanie Odegard. The former
Peace Corps worker and World Bank consultant has devoted the past 15
years to socially conscious rug making. Luxurious Himalayan and New
Zealand wool and silk are colored with vegetable dyes in a range of
900 hues, then knotted by skilled artisans whom Odegard encountered
as a consultant in Nepal.</TE>
<TE>   The finished works are subtle, stunningly beautiful and
politically correct. A percentage of sales is directed back to Nepal
to rehabilitate children rescued from illegal situations.</TE>
<TE>   Odegard is a member of the nonprofit Rugmark Foundation, created
eight years ago by Indian activist Kailash Satyarthi to exert
consumer pressure on the rug industry in India, Pakistan and Nepal.</TE>
<TE>   The extent of the problem is hard to quantify, whether trying to
document children in bondage or under legal working age.</TE>
<TE>   But suffice to say that some companies have agreed to independent
inspection of looms in return for a label that identifies their goods
to customers.</TE>
<TE>   I met Satyarthi and Odegard a few days apart. He blitzed through
between human rights meetings in Brazil and appearances in New York,
but posed a provocative question relevant to interior design: "Why
can't you think about designing the future of a child?"</TE>
<TE>   Odegard spoke at the Washington Design Center, where her company
has a showroom. She would be the first to agree that in much of the
world, life is not as soft as lamb's wool. And yet, she makes no
apology for the price of rugs that may cost $14,000 apiece.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're very privileged to live in a time when we can make
some impact by what we buy," she says.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, put your money where your heart is. Rugmark's
poster shows a Nepalese schoolgirl named Laxmi Shresta, who was found
rolling wool for her mother at age 6. She was rescued and now attends
a Rugmark-funded school.</TE>
<TE>   Against this emotional backdrop, rational counterarguments pale.
Conscientious American importers such as Chris Walter of Yayla Tribal
Rugs in Cambridge, Mass., take pains to explain that child labor is a
fact of life. Walter has founded his own project, Cultural Survival,
to help Tibetan refugees. He says he has never encountered children
in bondage but has heard such conditions exist. More often, families
work together at the loom. If children weren't working on rugs, they
could fall into worse pursuits.</TE>
<TE>   Carol Bier, a research associate at the Textile Museum, argues
persuasively that carpet weaving, which relies on numerical
combinations to achieve patterns, has untapped potential to teach
geometry and algebra--in other words, propel Third World children
into the digital age.</TE>
<TE>   She points out that loom technology led "directly and
incontrovertibly" to the development of computers. "The issue, the
way it's being treated by Rugmark people," she says, "is completely
not cognizant of this other end of the spectrum."</TE>
<TE>   Rugmark deserves credit for generating concern in the first place.
In Nepal, 70% of the carpet making industry is said to be enrolled in
Rugmark. In India and Pakistan the percentage is far lower, but
competing programs and labels have materialized. Mass-market
importers such as Ikea and Pottery Barn take the issue seriously.
Williams-Sonoma, parent company of Pottery Barn, insists that vendors
and suppliers abide by "a prohibition against, among other things,
hiring underage workers directly or through middlemen or agents,
prison or forced labor, manufacturing conditions that expose workers
to immediate risk of injury, or payment of below-minimum wage."</TE>
<TE>   Underlying any labeling system is the belief that if consumers
only knew, they would act. Marsha Dickson, an associate professor of
apparel, textiles and interior design at Kansas State University,
isn't so sure. After a Senate debate over clothing sweatshops raised
the question, she conducted a survey to find out how much impact a
"No Sweat" label would have on the purchase of a shirt. A paltry 16%
of respondents said that knowledge of working conditions would
outweigh issues of color, fabric or price.</TE>
<TE>   "When you had to decide between something really dear to you,
working conditions was not up there," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Dickson points out, "Children work for a reason. Certainly we have
a right to ask, but if we ask, we have a responsibility to understand
that whole picture. The root problem is poverty. What do you do about
poverty?"</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the worst thing a caring consumer could do would be to
deprive families of income by not buying a handmade rug.</TE>
<TE>   In an imperfect world, there are no easy answers.</TE>

<HD>So Where Were the Children's Fathers?</HD>

<LD>How do you untangle the web of responsibility when a mother's illness
leads to the death of her kids?</LD>
<LD>   That's the question we've been grappling with these past few
weeks, as it plays out for a national audience in court, in the
murder trial of Andrea Yates in Houston, and locally in the tragic
Simi Valley case of Marlene Heath.</LD>
<LD>   The circumstances differ significantly. Yates has confessed to
drowning her five children but is pleading innocent by reason of
insanity. A conviction could bring her the death penalty. Heath was
sentenced last month to one year in jail after she admitted leaving
her two toddlers alone in a hot van in her driveway while she took a
three-hour nap after a drinking binge. Her sons died of heat
exhaustion.</LD>
<TE>   But there is one theme that joins the two: the notion of
culpability. Both mothers claim to have been incapacitated when their
children died--Yates by recurring mental illness and Heath by her
long-standing addiction to alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   And a question has emerged in both cases: Where were the
husbands--the children's fathers--when all of this was going on?</TE>
<TE>   Last week, I wrote that Heath deserved stiffer punishment for the
deaths of her two sons. Nearly every reader who wrote or e-mailed in
response agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Marlene Heath should sit in a car with the windows rolled
up for at least three hours when it's 90 degrees outside and see how
it felt to her little kids," e-mailed one woman, in a typical
response.</TE>
<TE>   Several readers drew connections between the Heath case and the
murder trial of Yates.</TE>
<TE>   "I ache for those poor kids--all seven of them," wrote Julie
Riddle, a mother of three. And both fathers "bear some responsibility
and should be held accountable, in some way," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Yates had been previously hospitalized with mental problems, had
tried to commit suicide twice and, by the time she killed her
children, was frequently psychotic, paced the floor in circles,
pulled out chunks of her hair and refused to bathe or eat.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband had brought in his mother to help with the children,
but Andrea's best friend testified that he ignored her pleas that he
get her the treatment she needed.</TE>
<TE>   That makes Russell Yates "equally guilty for killing those kids,"
wrote one reader, a grandfather with two grown children. "I think he
ought to be on trial as well."</TE>
<TE>   Heath's husband's inaction drew harsh comments as well.</TE>
<TE>   "What if Mr. Heath had threatened to move out and take the
children with him? Might that have been the 'rock bottom' event that
would have snapped her out of her denial?" asked Jackie McCoy of
South Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   The husbands of both women failed in "their duty to protect their
children," e-mailed another reader, who described herself as "a
mother of three who fights addiction every day of my life.</TE>
<TE>   "The hardest part of being a parent is choosing your child's
health and safety above ALL ELSE," she wrote. "If they are to argue
that their wives were too ill to care for their children, then they
must bear the responsibility for having knowingly left their children
with an incompetent person."</TE>
<TE>   I'm sure Phillip Heath and Russell Yates would say their wives
were great and loving mothers ... when they weren't either drunk or
catatonic.</TE>
<TE>   Therapists consider our mutual reliance on denial folie a deux, a
sort of conspiracy of silence that enables a couple to pretend that
everything in their fractured lives is OK.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like saying 'We're both nuts, but we agree together not to
notice and not to say anything to anyone else,''' explains
psychiatrist Martin Karasch, medical director of a chemical
dependency program in Laguna Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, it's hard to disrupt a family, to deprive your children
of a parent who, at his or her worst, might be dangerous, but at best
is kind and loving.</TE>
<TE>   "You think of how much it'll shake your life, so you keep telling
yourself it can't be that bad," said one reader, who admitted she
"shopped from doctor to doctor because I didn't want to hear what
they were saying."</TE>
<TE>   She recently committed her husband to a residential program for
treatment of schizophrenia and abuse of alcohol. She shudders now
when she thinks of all the times she put her children at risk by
leaving them alone with their dad while she traveled for her job.</TE>
<TE>   "Somehow, denial felt more comfortable than the very scary reality
that something was wrong," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But the reality is less frightening that the alternative,
testified some readers.</TE>
<TE>   "It took just once," said a San Diego nurse who left her alcoholic
husband six years ago, after she learned that, while she was out of
town for her father's funeral, her husband left their children--one 9
and the other 4--home alone at night while he went out drinking.</TE>
<TE>   "I changed the locks, threw his stuff out on the front lawn and
never let him back in when I found out what he'd done," she wrote.
"It's up to the parents who are not in the 'disease' to make sure the
kids are not endangered."</TE>
<TE>   Because our children can't afford the luxury of delusions about a
parent's fitness, or storybook versions of happy families that blind
us to destructive demons.</TE>

<LD>Madam C.J. Walker was born as Sarah Breedlove on a Louisiana cotton
plantation in 1867, just two years after the end of the Civil War.
She went on to start the most successful company in America owned by
an African American woman. As a child, she worked as a sharecropper
in the cotton fields alongside her parents, who were former slaves.
They lived in a shack with no windows and slept on a dirt floor. When
she was 7, both her parents died. At age 14 she married. At 18, she
gave birth to a daughter and by age 20 she was a widow.</LD>
<LD>   For the next 18 years she supported herself and her daughter
working as a cook and washerwoman. Like many African American women
of the day, she straightened her hair. When it began falling out,
though, she invented a conditioning formula containing both shampoo
and pomade, which she applied with a hot comb. She also brushed her
hair vigorously. The treatment worked. Her hair became shiny and
smooth.</LD>
<TE>   In 1905, after moving to Denver and marrying Charles Joseph
Walker, a newspaperman, she started a business selling Madam C.J.
Walker's Wonderful Hair Grower and 16 other products. She went
door-to-door in the African American community giving beauty
treatments as part of her sales pitch. She started training others,
called Walker Agents, to sell her product as she did. They wore white
blouses and black skirts and carried her products in briefcases. By
1919 she had more than 20,000 agents. They worked on commission so
everyone shared in the success. She also had a chain of beauty salons
and a beauty school, Leila College, named after her daughter who
helped her run her various businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Madam Walker contributed generously to the National Assn. for the
Advancement of Colored People, especially to the anti-lynching
movement and the YMCA, and gave prizes to agents who did the most
charity work.</TE>
<TE>   In 1914, she moved to New York and lived on her estate, Villa
Lewaro. She was the first female African American millionaire. She
died in 1919.</TE>

<LD>Mel Gibson did something neither Bruce Willis in "Hart's War," Arnold
Schwarzenegger in "Collateral Damage" or Kevin Costner in "Dragonfly"
have been able to do this year--headline a hit movie.</LD>
<LD>   To be sure, Gibson's Vietnam War-era film, "We Were Soldiers,"
which debuted with $20.2 million to claim the No. 1 spot over the
weekend, lagged behind the openings of his two previous movies, "What
Women Want" ($33.6 million) and "The Patriot" ($22.4 million), but it
still proved that the veteran actor remains a healthy draw.</LD>
<LD>   Despite poor reviews, the abstinence-themed romantic comedy "40
Days and 40 Nights," starring Josh Hartnett, opened in second place
with $12.2 million.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Pasadena Symphony's 75th-anniversary season will include eight
concerts plus a special benefit event featuring an appearance of the
fictional character P.D.Q. Bach. The inventor of P.D.Q. Bach, U.S.
composer Peter Schickele, will be in residence with the orchestra for
the season, and three of his serious works, including the world
premiere of his Viola Concerto, will be played during the season,
Oct. 12 through May 10, 2003.</LD>
<LD>   Music Director Jorge Mester, leading the orchestra for the 18th
consecutive year, will conduct all nine concerts. Among the soloists
will be violinists Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg (May 10, 2003) and Philip
Quint (Jan. 18), and two pianists, the British musician Howard
Shelley (Dec. 14) and the young Finn, Paavali Jumppanen (March 8,
2003).</LD>
<LD>   Mester will conduct a new production of "Le Bourgeois
Gentilhomme," based on Moliere's comedy, with incidental music by
Richard Strauss, Nov. 9. John de Lancie will oversee the semi-staged
production. The benefit concert "P.D.Q. Bach vs. Pasadena" concert is
scheduled March 29, 2003.</LD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The American Jazz Philharmonic was one of the Southland's great but
sadly under-recognized musical blessings. Commissioning dozens of new
works, it explored the rich creative linkage between jazz and
orchestral music.</LD>
<LD>   When conductor Jack Elliott became a founder of the Henry Mancini
Institute, there was hope that his efforts would continue via the HMI
Orchestra, and, to a considerable extent, that hope was realized in
the years before Elliott passed away in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday at UCLA's Royce Hall, the debut concert of a new
entity--the Symphonic Jazz Orchestra--revived the possibility that
this compelling musical exploration would move into even more
adventurous areas. Founded by Mitch Glickman, a former Elliott
associate, and veteran saxophonist-composer Tom Scott, the SJO is a
full-sized orchestra, supplemented with enough saxophones, trumpets
and trombones to possess big-band jazz potential within its
instrumentation.</LD>
<TE>   The opening half of the program lived up to the promise, with some
reservations. All three of the works--"Rivers of Destiny," by Lesa
Terry (featuring the composer on violin); "Bossa, Ballad &amp; Kinda
Blues," by Scott; and "Bela &amp; Bird in B flat," by Don
Sebesky--effectively employed the orchestra's full forces. Soloists
Pete Christlieb and Jeff Clayton on saxophones, trumpeter Frank
Szabo, fluegelhornist Warren Luening, pianist Frank Cox, bassist Dave
Carpenter and drummer Peter Erskine added impressive improvisational
supplementation.</TE>
<TE>   But the works of Terry (orchestrated by Dan Weinstein) and Scott,
appealing as they were, too often fell prey to a problem that has
plagued jazz and symphony combinations since the Third Stream efforts
of the '50s and '60s: the potentially intrusive sound of jazz
drumming. Too few composers in this genre acknowledge that the
standard jazz drum kit evolved as the propulsive center of the big
jazz band format, an instrumentation for which it was well suited.
Using it in the same fashion within a symphony orchestra tends to
blow away most of the ensemble's potential for musical subtlety.</TE>
<TE>   Sebesky's well-conceived work was the exception. Employing
Erskine's drums in a style that maximized their tonal range, he
juxtaposed sweeping string sections against jazz passages. At one
point, justifying his title, he balanced rapid-fire bebop lines from
the jazz horns with fleet, Bartokian string lines.</TE>
<TE>   The program's second half featured the Yellowjackets and singer
Phil Perry,  whose astonishing vocal flexibility is a marvel to hear.</TE>
<TE>   Actor-comedian Tommy Davidson, serving as host, added some
wickedly funny musical impressions. But one hopes that the next SJO
program will manage to devote more time to its core mission.</TE>

<HD>Alan Smithee Makes a Name in Hollywood</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Alan Smithee is the secret shame of Hollywood," says film historian
Stephen Hock. "He's the man Hollywood would prefer we not know about,
not talk about and not ask any questions about."</LD>
<LD>   A secret for much of his 30 years in Hollywood, Smithee was
spectacularly exposed during flaps over the final edits of 1997's "An
Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn" and 1998's "American History
X." He has quietly disappeared since then, but his legend lives on.
Many of his secrets are revealed tonight in the American Movie
Classics documentary "Who Is Alan Smithee?"</LD>
<LD>   Smithee is the name taken by directors so unhappy with the final
version of a film--usually after a studio or producer stepped in to
make changes--that they ask to have their name removed.</LD>
<TE>   It's a wrenching decision, explains Martha Coolidge, who
considered taking her name off of 1984's "Joy of Sex" after the
studio reworked her version, but it's made when the director finds
himself or herself answering yes to these questions: Will the film
"embarrass me, humiliate me, disgust me for the rest of my life?"</TE>
<TE>   As directed by Lesli Klainberg, the documentary makes for a fairly
diverting hour in front of the tube.</TE>
<TE>   However, it won't win any prizes for innovation.</TE>
<TE>   It's a low-rent amalgamation of stock footage (directors at work,
red-carpet arrivals and the like) and talking-head interviews with
film historians, journalists (including The Times' Patrick Goldstein)
and those involved in disputes, including directors John Singleton (a
flap over the 2000 "Shaft" remake) and Arthur Hiller (who invoked his
own Alan Smithee on "Burn Hollywood Burn," which, as fate would have
it, was about a powerless director).</TE>
<TE>   The documentary traces Smithee back to 1968 and his introduction
in the movie "Death of a Gunfighter," when a dispute prompted the
directors' union, the Directors Guild of America, to come up with a
solution that would save both studio and directors from
embarrassment.</TE>
<TE>   After that, the DGA allowed the Smithee name to be used on 47
films, including 1989's "Backtrack," disowned by Dennis Hopper until
it was restored to his edit, and several heavily edited airline or
television versions of films, including the TV cut of David Lynch's
1984 "Dune."</TE>
<TE>   The Smithee credit was effective only as long as the general
public didn't know about it, the documentary explains. So, after the
very public "Burn Hollywood Burn" and "American History X"
disputes--the latter of which is discussed in detail by director Tony
Kaye and others involved in the film--that identifiable pseudonym was
dropped and new ones allowed.</TE>
<TE>   So, Alan Smithee, you might say, has gone back undercover, under
an assumed name.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Who Is Alan Smithee?" can be seen at 7 and 10:30 tonight on
American Movie Classics.</TE>

<LD>   New Cast Members for 'Harry Potter' Sequel</LD>
<LD>   Jason Isaacs, the villain of "The Patriot," will play Lucius
Malfoy, the sinister father of Harry's nemesis Draco Malfoy, in
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Warner Bros. said Monday.</LD>
<TE>   In the movie, set for a Nov. 15 release, Harry finds a diary that
helps him uncover a mysterious force that's haunting his school.</TE>
<TE>   Other new members of the "Chamber" cast include "Cats &amp; Dogs"
co-star Miriam Margolyes as magical gardener Professor Sprout and
Mark Williams from "The Borrowers" as Mr. Weasley, the father of
Harry's school chum, Ron. "Bridget Jones's Diary" co-star Shirley
Henderson will play the self-doubting ghost Moaning Myrtle, while
newcomer Sally Mortemore will appear as librarian Madam Pince.</TE>
<TE>   Child actors Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are
reprising their roles as Harry, Ron and Hermione, respectively.
Kenneth Branagh previously agreed to play vain Gilderoy Lockhart,
professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts.</TE>
<TE>   Crowe Eats Crow, Apologizing to Producer</TE>
<TE>   Yet another turn in the "Russell Crowe vs. the BBC" saga: The
actor has apologized to the producer whom he verbally and physically
attacked for cutting his speech at last week's British Academy Film
Awards--despite earlier denials that he'd do so.</TE>
<TE>   According to Sun Online, a Web site of the London newspaper, the
star of "A Beautiful Mind" telephoned Malcolm Gerrie on Saturday.
During a 20-minute conversation, he called his behavior
"inappropriate"--a result of feeling so "passionate" at the time.</TE>
<TE>   By Gerrie's account, Crowe also offered to do anything he could to
help the producer's family, who'd been "doorstepped" by the
Australian media in the wake of the incident. Down the road, the
actor suggested, they should hook up for a "few quiet pints" of
Guinness.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't believe it," Gerrie said. "It was a total contrast to
how he reacted the week before."</TE>
<TE>   TELEVISION</TE>
<TE>   'Nightline' Fans Voice Cyber-Complaints</TE>
<TE>   Though the folks at ABC's "Nightline" were still mum Monday
regarding the news that their Disney bosses are trying to oust them
from their late-night home of the last two decades, the viewers were
not.</TE>
<TE>   In his daily e-mail to viewers, executive producer Leroy Sievers
said the show has been "flooded with thousands and thousands" of
e-mails of support (about 3,275 as of Monday morning), which he
called "very gratifying." To maximize the impact, however, he
suggested that fans send their comments to ABC Audience Relations,
whose address he was happy to supply.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, some viewers might get to tell anchor Ted Koppel in
person just how they feel. The show plans a 90-minute "town meeting"
in New York City on homeland security, and the tensions between
increasing domestic security and preserving civil liberties.</TE>
<TE>   Among the more than 300 people who will be in the audience: World
Trade Center survivors, families of victims, police and fire
department members and detainees questioned in the attacks.</TE>

<TE>   Cellist's Soviet Trip Unlocks His Past</TE>
<TE>   Cellist Mstislav Rostropovich has learned a family secret in a
visit to Soviet-era archives: His father spent a year in a Soviet
labor camp.</TE>
<TE>   The musician, who lives in Paris, found the report while visiting
archives in Voronezh, 300 miles south of Moscow, where he also
visited a music school named in honor of his family.</TE>
<TE>   According to reports on Russian television, he discovered that his
father, conductor Leopold Rostropovich, was arrested in 1919 and sent
to a labor camp for a year. The arrest came after a Voronezh
newspaper published an invitation to a concert conducted by the elder
Rostropovich in honor of a general of the anti-Bolshevik White Army,
according to state television RTR.</TE>
<TE>   "I never knew about this fact. I don't think even my mother was
aware of the fact that my father had been arrested," said the
cellist, who left the Soviet Union in 1974.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   "Amelie" won four Cesar awards, the French equivalent of the
Oscars, on Saturday, including best picture and best director for
Jean-Pierre Jeunet. But the star, Audrey Tautou, was bypassed in the
best actress category.... Shirley Jones ("The Partridge Family") has
filed for divorce from comedian Marty Ingels, to whom she's been
married for 25 years.... Steven Van Zandt, longtime member of Bruce
Springsteen's E Street Band and an actor in "The Sopranos," will host
a nationally syndicated radio show titled "Hard Rock Cafe Presents
Little Steven's Underground Garage." The two-hour weekly program,
focusing on garage bands, will air locally on KLSX-FM (97.1)
Saturdays at 10 p.m., starting in April.... Daniel Ash's show
scheduled for tonight at the Roxy has been postponed after a car
accident involving the musician and his band on Friday. The date is
expected to be rescheduled in April.... Roger Moore, best known for
playing James Bond, will switch gears in his next project, playing a
flamboyant gay man in the summer release "Boat Trip," opposite Cuba
Gooding Jr.... Anne Heche gave birth to a baby boy, Homer Heche
Laffoon, on Saturday in Los Angeles--the first child for the actress
and husband Coleman Laffoon.... "Late Nite Catechism," the show about
a straight-talking nun that's playing at L.A.'s Coronet Theater and
at the Hermosa Beach Playhouse, will expand to a third Southland
venue on April 4. The show's co-creator and original star, Maripat
Donovan, will take her act to the Balcony Theatre in the Pasadena
Playhouse complex.</TE>

<HD>UPN Debuts 'As If,' 'Random Years'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT SANDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"As If" and "The Random Years" premiere back to back starting at 9
tonight on UPN. Each half-hour series might more appropriately use
the other's title, for the first show is dismayingly random and the
second pretends as if it were "Seinfeld."</LD>
<LD>   "As If" follows six young adults as they make their way through a
world of manipulation, bonding and really large muffins, which appear
in close-up several times as a leitmotif tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Though it would seem these folks are college students, studying is
the last thing on their minds. Most of the premiere takes place in a
bar and disco, with various flashbacks and time warps that come
across as more of a distracting jumble than an innovative approach.</LD>
<TE>   The show has a great techno/house music soundtrack but lacks
characters that are easy to care about. The alternatively named,
coiffed and pierced Sooz (Emily Corrie), a transfer from the British
series on which "As If" is based, comes closest.</TE>
<TE>   UPN calls this show a "dramedy," a mixture of drama and comedy.
Maybe that makes sense, because I didn't know whether to cry or
laugh.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, "The Random Years" is more firmly rooted in
tradition: the sitcom format. It centers on three guys and a girl, in
a New York City apartment building, trying just to get through life
or at least some really bad dates.</TE>
<TE>   As if this setup weren't familiar enough, one of the guys is
Wiseman (Joshua Ackerman), a wild-haired dental technician who
appears to be possessed by the spirit of Kramer.</TE>
<TE>   As sitcoms go, "The Random Years" is, by itself, fairly enjoyable.
Its characters, all in their early 20s, are sympathetic enough. The
story is funny, if somewhat predictable. But its "Seinfeld"-ian
elements invite comparison with the original. And by that measure, it
is lacking a great deal of something to match a show about "nothing."</TE>

<HD>A Shakespeare Mystery's Colorful Turn</HD>
<DH>Theater* A Baltimore production company added a unique
touch to 'The Winter's Tale.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY SELBY</AU>
<BD>THE BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>The question, as it always is, is this: What about the bear? At
Baltimore's Center Stage, it galumphs into view, roaring and huffing,
a great, blue manifestation of what must be Shakespeare's most
bizarre stage direction.</LD>
<LD>   Blue?</LD>
<LD>   Yes, blue.</LD>
<TE>   "Exit, pursued by a bear," instructed Shakespeare in Act 3, Scene
3 of "The Winter's Tale." What was the Bard thinking? Did he intend
for a real bear--or perhaps an actor in a costume--to appear on
stage? Should it be scary or amusing? Was the playwright toying with
the directors of his day, or toying with us?</TE>
<TE>   "The bear is just one of the strangenesses of 'The Winter's
Tale,'" says Barbara Mowat, director of academic programs at the
Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   The play, being performed at Center Stage through March 31, is
definitely peculiar. Written in about 1610, it is both tragic and
funny. Its story begins in Sicily, leaps 16 years and ends in
Bohemia. There's an irrationally jealous king, a beautiful, pregnant
queen, a foundling, a prince in disguise, a hilariously dull-witted
shepherd, a personification of time, a satyr who dances and a statue
that comes to life.</TE>
<TE>   "The bear makes as much sense as anything else," Mowat says.</TE>
<TE>   True, but get the bear right, and things begin to fall into place.</TE>
<TE>   "The bear is indicative of the show's entire aesthetic," says
Charlotte Stoudt, dramaturge at Center Stage. "It's a narrative pivot
point, the turn from tragedy to comedy in the play. It's crazy. It's
campy. It's fun. It's scary. You have all these contradictory
feelings, which add up to one of the best moments of the play."</TE>
<TE>   Debates have swirled around the bear for centuries. Initially, the
arguments centered on whether Shakespeare intended for an actual bear
to be let loose onstage--or for a man in a costume to act like a
bear. "By now almost all the critics would agree that it would have
had to be a man in a costume," Mowat says.</TE>
<TE>   In Elizabethan England, bears were familiar creatures. Men wagered
on bear-baiting contests. Bears symbolized anger and tyranny; some
likened them to the king. Bears also were seen as nurturing and
courageous animals.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, the bear in "The Winter's Tale" has been portrayed as a
puppet. A rug. A shadow. A man with a mask. Sometimes the creature
horrifies the audience. Sometimes it evokes laughter. Sometimes it
doesn't appear at all.</TE>
<TE>   For clues as to how Irene Lewis, artistic director at Center
Stage, views the bear, consider this: The original script calls for
the bear to appear only once--in Act 3 when he devours a man. In this
production, the bear appears on stage four times.</TE>
<TE>   Played by Warren "Wawa" Snipe, the blue bear, when on his hind
feet, stands about 7 feet tall. Costumer Jennifer Sterns carved his
head from foam and blue fur. She also purchased from a taxidermist
two sets of eyes, one yellow to be used when the bear is angry, and
one brown for his mellow moods.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed a bear that was almost mythical," says New York-based
costume designer Candice Donnelly. "A bear that could lead the
audience from the tragic parts of the play to the other, more
whimsical, almost free-associated parts of the play."</TE>
<TE>   It was Donnelly's idea to make the bear blue. Not long before she
began to design the costumes for "The Winter's Tale," she saw a
striking picture of blue feet in an Italian Vogue magazine. "We need
a bear that is enormous," said artistic director Lewis. "One that is
scary, but not horrifying. A bear that is believable, but not
completely realistic, that is "</TE>
<TE>   "Blue," said Donnelly.</TE>

<HD>The Osbournes Move In on MTV</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID BAUDER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The boxes are stacked outside the Beverly Hills home, ready to be
carried in. Each is neatly labeled: "pots and pans," "linens," "devil
heads," "dead things."</LD>
<LD>   Plainly, Ozzie and Harriet aren't moving in.</LD>
<LD>   This Ozzy is Ozzy Osbourne, the heavy-metal rock star, and his
family. Their arrival in the neighborhood heralds a hilarious new MTV
series, "The Osbournes," that premieres at 10:30 tonight.</LD>
<TE>   MTV describes it as television's first "reality sitcom," a format
that suggested itself naturally because nothing they could invent
around the Osbournes would be as funny as their actual lives. Just
the idea of the Black Sabbath founder, who will forever be known for
biting the head off a bat during a 1982 concert, as a family man
seems strange. Yet leather and black mascara can be deceiving.</TE>
<TE>   Osbourne, 53, is slightly addled but sweetly funny--and under
everything a lot like the put-upon dads you've been seeing in
television sitcoms for generations.</TE>
<TE>   Watch a bewildered Ozzy fruitlessly try to navigate a satellite TV
remote control, begging for help from his 16-year-old son. "I'm stuck
on the Weather Channel," he says. "Arrrggghhh!!"</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Sharon, is a formidable talent manager in her own right
who organizes the popular Ozzfest summer concert tours. Expletives
appear to be the Osbournes' favorite form of communication. During
the first 30-minute episode, dialogue is bleeped out 59 times. The
"South Park" kids would be proud.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the couple's three children--Jack and 17-year-old
Kelly--are featured in the series. A third, older child opted out.
Jack's something of an oddball having trouble fitting in at school.
The high-strung Kelly is, like any teenager, appropriately
embarrassed by her parents.</TE>
<TE>   There's trouble with the neighbors, too. The family next door
plays music too loud, and it's driving the Osbournes crazy.</TE>

<HD>New Roads for Hubbard Street Dancers</HD>
<DH>Choreography * Jim Vincent plans new things for his troupe,
appearing this weekend in Irvine.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jim Vincent stepped into some big shoes when he took over the Hubbard
Street Dance Chicago for Lou Conte in August 2000. Conte had created
the contemporary dance troupe in 1977 and led it right up to
Vincent's arrival.</LD>
<LD>   "The most unusual thing about this change of guard is that it was
due to a retirement," Vincent said from Portland, Ore., where Hubbard
Street was dancing before its dates Friday and Saturday at the Irvine
Barclay Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   "Usually, it's the result of internal turmoil or trauma that puts
a lot of stress on everyone. This didn't. The company is in great
shape, actually."</LD>
<TE>   Hubbard Street began with four women tap-dancing in cafeterias for
senior citizens, but it soon expanded in size and repertory to
include theatrical jazz, modern dance and classical ballet.</TE>
<TE>   Conte and Claire Bataille, one of the dancers, created most of the
choreography in the early years. Wanting to go beyond his background
that was mainly in Broadway musicals, Conte began inviting guest
modern dance choreographers such as Margo Sapp- ington, David
Parsons, Danny Ezralow and others to create works.</TE>
<TE>   Conte scored a coup in 1990 by acquiring the exclusive
rights--which expired after three years--to choreography by Twyla
Tharp after she disbanded her company.</TE>
<TE>   In his final year, he reached out to Jiri Kylian of Nederlands
Dans Theater, Nacho Duato of Compania Nacional de Danza in Madrid and
Ohad Naharin of Batsheva Dance Company in Tel Aviv.</TE>
<TE>   "I was familiar with those works," said Vincent. "Some were even
created on me. It made a lot of sense. The connection was there."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, in the beginning, Vincent said he wasn't interested in
the job. "I first said no. We lived 40 minutes east of Paris. We had
just bought a house. My wife is French. We have three children. It
was a wonderful opportunity, but this was not the right time. They
didn't accept my refusal. They said, 'Come spend a couple of days
with us.'"</TE>
<TE>   He did and liked what he saw: "Very strong individual talents and
personalities who are able to work together and create a collective
ego for the company. I appreciate that discipline and responsibility.
Interdependency, almost.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt the repertory, the facility, the board and the good
quality dancers--how many times would this come up? There were too
many arrows pointing in the same direction."</TE>
<TE>   There are 21 dancers in the main company and six in a second
company. The dancers have 52-week contracts, paid vacations, medical
benefits and a retirement package.</TE>
<TE>   The yearly budget is $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Vincent, who turned 44 on Sunday, was born in Lawrenceville, N.J.,
and studied at the Washington School of Ballet in Washington, D.C.;
Harkness House of Ballet in New York City; and the North Carolina
School of the Arts at the University of North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   He was plucked out of his sophomore year by a call from Kylian,
who invited him to audition for Nederlands Dans Theater, where he
spent 12 years as a dancer, choreographer and rehearsal director.</TE>
<TE>   "I had tried to leave NDT when I was 25. I had thought, this will
be my whole career if I don't leave now. I had gone to Europe
originally only for a year or two. But there was an endless wealth of
new work and collaborations.</TE>
<TE>   "Four months into a year or two of a leave of absence, Kylian
called me back, saying, 'I need you.' How many times in my life would
somebody like that call and demand that I come back?"</TE>
<TE>   So he returned to The Hague.</TE>
<TE>   After Nederlands Dans Theater, he worked four years as assistant
artistic director of Duato's company in Spain, and three years as
ballet master of the Opera National de Lyon. In 1997, he became part
of the creative team of Disneyland Paris, as a concept designer and
show director.</TE>
<TE>   "I stopped dancing really early," Vincent said. "I was 32. I
hadn't done it all, but I felt I had accomplished what I wanted to. I
really enjoyed artistic administration as well."</TE>
<TE>   Working in Europe for 22 years gave him security and six weeks of
vacation. "But I was afraid a civil servant mentality had slipped in.
A little pressure would be helpful."</TE>
<TE>   Coming back to the U.S. after 22 years has been "quite an
adjustment, more for my family than for me. I'm not used to being
sold a burger every 22 seconds. It's crazy."</TE>
<TE>   Vincent sees new directions ahead for Hubbard Street.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been so many elements. I want to send one clear
message. The company used to be referred to as a mix of classical,
modern and jazz: 'Where entertainment and art meet, with the focus on
the accessible.' If 'accessible' is a result of the way a piece
engages a public, fine. But that's not the objective. The objective
is to draw in people from both sides of the proscenium."</TE>
<TE>   Although he wants new work in the repertory, he doesn't see the
company as a vehicle for himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I actually just did my first work for the company," he said. It's
a work called "Counter/part," based on sections from the
"Brandenburg" Concertos and other works by Bach.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, he started a choreographic workshop in which the
dancers could create works.</TE>
<TE>   "That will help produce the next generation of America
choreographers. It will also give us exclusive repertory."</TE>
<TE>   His choreography is said to reflect the work of his mentor.
Vincent doesn't reject his influence.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would I want to? I prefer to be inspired by Kylian--as Kylian
was from [John] Cranko--than from someone who is just out there doing
it," he said. "I'm watching so much mediocre video these days.
There's so much [work that's] just, 'Oh, yeah, fine. OK, it's
musical. OK, it moves well.' I need more."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hubbard Street Dance Chicago will perform a program of mixed
repertory Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. at the Irvine Barclay
Theatre, 4242 Campus Drive, Irvine. $30 to $35. (949) 854-4646.</TE>

<HD>The Still Bad New Old Nixon</HD>
<DH>A blast from the past is a warning for the president.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SCHEER</AU>
<BD>Robert Scheer writes a syndicated column.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been three decades since President Richard M. Nixon was taped in
the White House delivering anti-Semetic rants on how Jews are the
scourge of our nation, why we should nuke Vietnam and how that
infamous photo of a naked, 9-year-old girl fleeing a napalm attack
was actually a fake. Because of the time lag, these latest
revelations of Nixon's depravity have elicited a big media yawn, with
the story landing back by the classifieds in most of the newspapers
that even carried it.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, this editorial apathy is a reflection of a
misguided American perception that the past is largely irrelevant to
the future.</LD>
<LD>   In tapes released last week, Nixon warns the Rev. Billy Graham
that the Jews control the media and endorses Graham's statement that
"this stranglehold has got to be broken or the country's going down
the drain"--a sentiment assuredly echoed in the surviving cells of Al
Qaeda.</LD>
<TE>   In another conversation, with former Texas Gov. John B. Connolly,
Nixon is heard saying of Jews, "They're untrustworthy.... Look at the
Justice Department. It's full of Jews."</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere on the tapes, Nixon chats with Henry Kissinger about the
escalating bombing of Vietnam and interjects that "I'd rather use the
nuclear bomb."</TE>
<TE>   He even chides Kissinger for being overly worried about
noncombatant victims: "You're so goddamned concerned about the
civilians, and I don't give a damn. I don't care."</TE>
<TE>   As if to prove this grim claim, Nixon callously dismisses the
Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph of the girl fleeing napalm bomb
attacks as "fixed"--a sentiment worthy of Slobodan Milosevic.</TE>
<TE>   At another point, news arrives of the shooting of George Wallace,
the former Alabama governor, who was expected to run in the 1972
election. Nixon, without missing a beat, says to blame the
assassination attempt on the Democrats: "Just say he [the shooter]
was a supporter of [George] McGovern and [Ted] Kennedy. Just put that
out.... Say you have it on unmistakable evidence."</TE>
<TE>   These tapes are more than just fodder for a biographer's
footnotes. They give us a bracing insight into the beastly side of
our own nature that can manifest itself in our leaders, even though
we are a fundamentally decent people.</TE>
<TE>   If we listen to the words of this two-term wartime president, we
will find an indelible record of a leader's capacity for deep evil.</TE>
<TE>   Nixon may not have been the worst of our presidents but, through
the accident of his penchant for secret recordings, he is certainly
the most revealed. The Nixon Library should transform itself into an
institute for the study of official mendacity so that we may be
reminded why the Constitution was written: to protect the citizenry
from the corruptions of power.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Nixon is dead, and Graham, now 83, has just apologized;
it would be easy enough to ignore these horrific conversations as the
ramblings of an already discredited president.</TE>
<TE>   But when we are busy condemning national chauvinism, religious
hatred and war crimes abroad, it is no time to whitewash our own
past. To utter such thoughts invites the riposte that one seeks to
weaken our nation rather than strengthen it.</TE>
<TE>   Thankfully, this country has a clear history of questioning
sanctimonious expressions of authority, and the release of these
tapes, however late, is a clear example of that.</TE>
<TE>   It is hard to imagine many other nations making such information
public without being forced by revolution.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, for every Richard Nixon in U.S. history, there has been a
George McGovern who dared to speak truth to power. A highly decorated
combat pilot in World War II, McGovern took on Nixon before
Watergate, with a bold stand against the Vietnam War that allowed
demagogues to spit on a true hero's patriotism.</TE>
<TE>   Although well ahead in the polls, Nixon was so intent on
destroying his opponent in the 1972 presidential race--in the tapes,
he refers to McGovern as a "damn socialist with a blind spot for
communists"--that he set in motion the Watergate break-in of the
Democratic Party headquarters to look for smear material.</TE>
<TE>   Playing the devil, Nixon was finally burned by the hot breath of
history that was unleashed by his own greed for power.</TE>

<HD>Mideast Ache Goes On and On</HD>
<DH>Despair could be overcome with a dose of reality.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL WOLF</AU>
<BD>Daniel Wolf is a lawyer in New York who served in the
Israeli army in 1991 and 1992.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A recent visit to the dentist to prepare a crown for one of my front
teeth brought back a flood of memories inextricably linked to the
tortured and winding path of Middle East peace.</LD>
<LD>   The tooth was damaged by a rock thrown by a teenage Palestinian on
a brisk, sunny morning in Gaza City 11 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   I had just finished endless months of intensive training for
service in an elite unit of the Israeli army. I was excited about my
unit's first "combat" posting.</LD>
<TE>   The first intifada was on its last legs by the time we arrived in
the squalid Gaza City. We passed our days patrolling the streets,
somehow believing that quelling protests by bored teenagers and
unemployed young men in this city of more than a quarter-million
Palestinians was essential to Israel's security.</TE>
<TE>   I quickly learned that the moral, economic and emotional toll of
the occupation was undermining the future physical and spiritual
health of both Israelis and Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   I despaired looking at the hate in the eyes of Palestinian
children passing us on the way to kindergarten. And I was mortified
when teenage girls hid behind their parents when we searched
Palestinian homes for fugitives. It was a rude and tragic awakening
to realize that the educated Palestinian populace actually believed
the groundless rumors of raping and pillaging by Israeli soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   There also was something sad about heavily armed Israeli troops
facing off against stone-throwing youth, periodically crouching into
firing position to frighten the protesters. What the protesters
probably did not realize was that we also were scared, heavily
outnumbered and secretly hoping that the scare tactic would keep the
approaching mob at bay.</TE>
<TE>   I came to the realization that the Israeli occupation had to
end--not for political, religious, historical or moral reasons but
for simple reality.</TE>
<TE>   The Gaza Strip and much of the West Bank, already densely
populated by Palestinians, leave no room for Israel as an occupying
force or a settling population. What did 400 Jewish settlers hope to
do in the city of Hebron, home to more than 100,000 Palestinians?
Equally, the Palestinians should realize that Tel Aviv's 400,000
Israelis leave little room for resettlement of Palestinian refugees
in that area and many others of Israel proper.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, it seems that only the extreme left and extreme right
of Israeli politics shared my conclusion, disagreeing with each other
only as to who should be moved to solve the problem. Sadly, the
mainstream Labor and Likud parties somehow believed that the status
quo in the occupied territories could be fixed with some tinkering.
They disagreed only about who should be inconvenienced at the fringes
of that process.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, a military occupation has continued, allowing
more youths on each side to be brought up in an environment of hate,
distrust, fear and despair.</TE>
<TE>   That rock to my mouth came not long before the historic Madrid
peace conference, the precursor to the Oslo process a few years
later. At the time, an army dentist repaired my tooth with a
synthetic filling, explaining that it was a temporary fix that would
last for about a year. Sadly, it has proved more lasting than the
Madrid and Oslo stations on the way to a permanent settlement based
on the "land for peace" formula.</TE>
<TE>   It is time for the parties to the peace process to abandon interim
solutions. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat must seize the opportunity of the
recent Saudi initiative to seek a permanent settlement of their
differences. They must put aside ideology, history, religious
extremism and personal animosity.</TE>
<TE>   A permanent peace centered on the creation of a viable and
democratic state of Palestine on virtually all of the West Bank and
Gaza, in exchange for full recognition of Israel's right to exist as
a Jewish state within its pre-1967 borders, will represent a triumph
of the one factor that matters most: simple reality.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Times endorses selectively, on a case-by-case basis. Here are
recommendations in state and local races in today's elections.</LD>
<LD>   STATE</LD>
<LD>   Proposition 40. YES. The state has gained ground in preserving its
natural treasures, thanks to previous bond issues. This $2.6-billion
bond measure would continue the improvement.</LD>
<TE>   Proposition 41. YES. This $200-million bond issue would help
counties buy new voting machines and retire Florida-style punch-card
models.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 42. NO. This would designate state gasoline sales tax
money for transportation projects, permanently. This is poor policy
and lazy lawmaking. The Legislature can renew the current earmarking
law, which expires in 2008, if economic conditions dictate.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 43. YES. Writes into the state Constitution a
guarantee that a vote cast is a vote counted. The high-toned rhetoric
would underpin laws extending recount periods.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 44. NO. Since 1922, voters have had to approve changes
in state oversight of the chiropractic profession. Enough. Voters
should demand that the Legislature craft another proposition removing
this from voters' responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 45. YES. The current strict term limits in the
Legislature shuttle members in and out, and leadership has suffered
badly. This measure would allow legislators to run again by
collecting signatures equal to 20% of votes cast in the last
election. It could help restore stability and a little expertise to
lawmaking in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   State Superintendent of Public Instruction. State Sen. Jack
O'Connell. A former high school teacher with nearly two decades as an
assemblyman and senator, O'Connell has the right portfolio.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LOS ANGELES CITY</TE>
<TE>   Proposition Q. YES. This $600-million bond measure would finance
new police stations, repair existing police and fire stations and
build facilities for better support of 911 emergency calls. The
city's history on such projects is not great. But new oversight
mechanisms bring accountability to this measure.</TE>
<TE>   Charter Amendment R. YES. Changes the dates of odd-year city
elections to avoid holidays and put more time between the primaries
and general elections, and between general elections and the taking
of office July 1. Would allow more thorough recounts.</TE>
<TE>   City Council District 2. Wendy Greuel. She has good local
political experience working for former Mayor Tom Bradley and
expertise on civic issues. Her opponent, state Assemblyman Tony
Cardenas, is damaged by his deep involvement with some of the
nastiest attack ads of the last mayoral race.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LOS ANGELES COUNTY</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff. Lee Baca. Incumbent Baca has made gains in addressing the
department's problems, including its handling of mentally ill
inmates. He has weak areas, particularly in managing his budget, but
has earned reelection.</TE>
<TE>   SUPERVISORS AND ASSESSOR</TE>
<TE>   District 1. Gloria Molina. Incumbent Molina isn't much of a
compromiser, but she is a solid and imaginative community-builder.</TE>
<TE>   District 3. Zev Yaroslavsky. Running unopposed for his third term,
Yaroslavsky is a budget expert and an adept pragmatist.</TE>
<TE>   Assessor. Rick Auerbach. Elected in 2000 to fill an unfinished
term, he has modernized his office and made it friendlier to
constituents.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BALLOT MEASURES</TE>
<TE>   Charter Amendment A. NO. This measure, limiting county officials
to 12 years in office, is more generous than the damaging state
limits, but officials would still be lame ducks after eight years,
and limits remove voter choice.</TE>
<TE>   Charter Amendment B. NO. Similar to Amendment A, except that it
would apply term limits only to the five county supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Charter Amendment C. YES. This charter amendment would help the
sheriff strengthen the management structure of the department.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SUPERIOR COURT JUDGES</TE>
<TE>   Office No. 2. Hank Goldberg.</TE>
<TE>   Office No. 39. Richard Naranjo.</TE>
<TE>   Office No. 40. Superior Court Judge Floyd Baxter.</TE>
<TE>   Office No. 53. Lauren Weis.</TE>
<TE>   Office No. 67. Paul Bacigalupo.</TE>
<TE>   Office No. 90. Superior Court Judge Robert Simpson.</TE>
<TE>   Office No. 100. Richard Walmark.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ORANGE COUNTY</TE>
<TE>   Measure V, County Charter: NO.</TE>
<TE>   Measure W, Park Zoning (El Toro): NO.</TE>
<TE>   District Attorney: Wally Wade.</TE>

<LD>Americans are dying in the snow-capped mountains of Afghanistan, a
reminder that the war there is far from over--and a reminder that
even in wartime, information and debate are forces that make
democracy strong.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, the initial phase was easier than most observers expected and
caused fewer American casualties than feared. But when some Afghan
allies proved lackluster at searching Tora Bora's caves and at
stopping Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters from slipping off to Pakistan,
it became clear that rooting out the enemy would mean exposing more
U.S. ground troops to gunfire and missiles.</LD>
<LD>   Now hundreds if not thousands of fighters are thought to be holed
up in labyrinthine caves in Paktia province, and hundreds of regular
Army soldiers have joined U.S. Special Operations troops, Afghans and
allied nations' fighters in attacking them. This time U.S. and allied
soldiers are closing off potential escape routes. Presumably they
will lead the post-battle search of the hide-outs. The security of
the United States is tied to the success of such operations. And the
security of the U.S. system of government is tied to the public
receiving accurate, unvarnished information about such actions,
successful or not.</LD>
<TE>   On Jan. 24, U.S. soldiers conducted a predawn raid during which
more than a dozen Afghans were killed and 27 captured. The Pentagon
at first said those captured were Al Qaeda or Taliban soldiers or
sympathizers but then admitted that was wrong. Defense Secretary
Donald H. Rumsfeld called the deaths "unfortunate" but said the raid
was "no mistake" because Americans fired in self-defense. Rumsfeld
should have just called it what it was--a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, such fudging, even in wartime, proves
counterproductive. Even more troubling are the White House's penchant
for secrecy--which the war on terrorism has only exacerbated--and
Republican sympathizers' efforts to silence debate. On Sunday, Senate
Majority Leader Tom Daschle criticized the administration for not
telling Congress it had created a shadow government of 100 senior
civilian government managers (only executive branch members  need
apply). Daschle also challenged the administration for limiting
information about its plans for the continued prosecution of the war.</TE>
<TE>   In both cases, he was right. Neither Congress nor the American
people can be left out of the loop as President Bush vastly expands
U.S. military commitments. And Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott was
way off base in demagoguing the issue by asking "how dare" Daschle
even raise such concerns.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Daschle has a duty to do just that. And while no one
expects the Pentagon to broadcast its plans during wartime, Americans
have a right to be kept abreast of a war in which their sons  are
dying.</TE>

objective of Israel was and remains the expulsion of the Arab people
from Palestine," why are there so many Arab communities in Israel?
How many Israeli communities exist in Saudi Arabia? Why are there
Arabs in Israel's parliament? How many Israelis are in Saudi Arabia's
government? How long would it take for Israel to wipe out the entire
Palestinian population? How many times did Saudi Arabia try to wipe
out the entire Israeli population?</LD>
<LD>   Shubukshi's slanderous lies belie the sincerity behind Saudi
Arabia's recent extortion proposal for peace.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Unlikely Olive Branch Takes Root," Feb. 28: You report that
"throughout the escalating bloodshed, the U.S. government has
abdicated its mediator role and remains largely on the sidelines."
Are you serious?</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government is anything but "on the sidelines"; ask
politically literate people from Europe, the Middle East or Asia. Ask
any of the Israeli lobby (whose very existence entails U.S.
involvement); ask Palestinians whose homes have been struck by U.S.
missiles fired from U.S. helicopters that are flown by Israelis who
are subsidized by U.S. taxpayer money in the billions.</TE>
<TE>   Any examination of Security Council resolutions censuring Israel's
oppressive policies reveals this assertion of U.S. neutrality to be
delusion as well--they are all vetoed by the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   This dissimulating picture of Middle East political reality and
U.S. foreign policy is indicative of the chasm of perception that
divides the U.S. public from the remainder of the world's politically
literate population.</TE>

<TE>   Kudos to Frank J. Gaffney Jr. ("Land for Peace Is a Losing Trade,"
Commentary, Feb. 27). In a compromise, each party gives up something
tangible to enable a positive resolution. In the "land for peace"
compromise, Israel gives up land it acquired as a result of Arabs
waging wars to annihilate Israel, and current Arab leaders are
supposed to give up trying to destroy Israel. This sounds like a
mobster protection racket, not international diplomacy.</TE>

<LD>There is a quick and effective solution to damage done to schools at
night and over weekends ("City Posts Reward in Vandalism of Valley
School," Feb. 27). Provide an apartment or other quarters to a head
custodian who would live on the school grounds rent-free. The very
presence of a live person and possibly a dog on campus would
discourage vandals. This practice works very well in some schools I
observed in France.</LD>

driving more miles, and the increase in the gas-guzzling SUVs over
the last few years. What would our dependence be if there were no

<LD>Re "Daschle Questions Future Success of U.S. War Effort," March 1:
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle is dead right about calling the
so-called "war on terrorism" into question. This war has no clear
purpose other than keeping the focus off of the administration's
mismanagement of everything it touches--including the war. Its
blunders on the economy, the environment, civil liberties, Middle
East policy and relations with our allies are nothing short of
embarrassing.</LD>
<LD>   The administration's only hope for maintaining public support is
to expand a needless and ineffective war that will cost the lives of
fine young Americans and explode the national debt beyond all reason.
Its lack of success in accomplishing its often repeated "dead or
alive" objectives in Afghanistan demonstrates the folly of this
policy.</LD>
<LD>   I want answers to the same questions, and Sens. Robert Byrd
(D-W.Va.) and Daschle are responsible and courageous public servants
for asking them.</LD>
<TE>   Thomas Haskin</TE>
<TE>   La Mesa</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Democrats in Congress are finding the courage to question
President Bush's overreaching and opportunistic defense policies.
Daschle and others have raised tough questions about ever-widening
military actions around the globe when we haven't even finished our
mission in Afghanistan. Naturally, the Republicans are trying to
distract us from these questions by calling Daschle's patriotism into
doubt.</TE>
<TE>   "How dare Sen. Daschle criticize President Bush while we are
fighting our war on terrorism," Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott
fumes. It's sad but true: Patriotism really is the last refuge of
scoundrels.</TE>

<LD>Re "Fish Are the Earth's Canaries," Commentary, Feb. 28: Richard
Anderson and Gregory Helms would like us to believe that all we have
to do is draw an invisible fence around some islands and poof, we
have abundant fish stocks. But where is the evidence? It doesn't
exist for California waters.</LD>
<LD>   At Morro Bay and Pismo Beach we have two Pismo clam reserves and
an invertebrate preserve. Sounds good. However, the cute little sea
otter has eliminated most legal-size clams. There are still clams,
but they rarely reach legal size for human use. The same has occurred
between Morro Bay and Monterey, where red abalone were once abundant.
It is well documented that sea otters, not humans, reduced abalone
and clams by 90%. The Channel Islands have sea otters and huge
populations of seals and sea lions.</LD>
<LD>   California sea lions and harbor seals are eating a lot more fish
these days and won't be paying attention to invisible fences.</LD>

<LD>To those who say the L.A. Marathon's costs are not worth the end
product (March 2) or to those who complain of the inconvenience of
having several miles of blocked streets, I say run in the race, be a
volunteer or go watch these intrepid athletes as they challenge
themselves to the finish line. Once you see how much support and
community spirit are generated as family, friends and neighbors cheer
each athlete on and wonder at their achievements, you will understand
that putting a price tag on this event misses the point.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles needs the marathon and any other event like it that
manages to bring citizens out of their cars and onto the sidewalks.
If a 26.2-mile run on a beautiful Sunday in March isn't your cup of
tea, walk or ride a bike to a part of the city where the race passes
by. You just might find yourself yelling "You can do it!" to people
you don't even know.</LD>

<TE>   I awoke Sunday morning to a police state of barriers and
blockades. I was unable to exit my neighborhood for the duration of
the marathon. As I was trying to get to a family breakfast, I was
given incorrect alternative route information by numerous marathon
volunteers. Finally, I asked to speak to their supervisor, at which
time I was met by four LAPD officers who could offer no help.
Additionally, the Sunday Times offered no marathon route information.
No notice of the event was provided to our neighborhood (and perhaps
others) by the city.</TE>
<TE>   As a former resident of Boston for over 20 years, I have seen many
a marathon conducted with little impact to the surrounding areas.
Perhaps next year L.A. will consider hiring Boston's coordinators.
They could certainly do no worse than what I experienced this year:
involuntary house arrest due to marathon.</TE>

<TE>   I had a great run on Sunday, with an excellent finishing time.</TE>
<TE>   However, what distresses me most about the "revamped" L.A.
Marathon is the spin that the new course showed off "the diversity of
our city's multicultural" neighborhoods. As a local, I was shocked by
the rundown condition of the districts that comprised most of the
route. I'm sure visitors were even more surprised, anticipating
pristine mountain views and landscaped estates. It was a real
eye-opener, and I kept wishing the speechifying Mayor James Hahn,
Councilman Nate Holden and City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo, who opened
the ceremonies, could have seen the enthusiastic support being
offered by the residents of those areas.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, many of the runners may not have noticed either,
because they were so maddeningly preoccupied with chatting on their
cell phones. Only in L.A.</TE>

<TE>   I will never vote for any of those politicians who had to be
introduced and felt obliged to speak, thus delaying the start of the
marathon on what turned out to be a very hot day. This is no place
for a political platform. It is very tiring just standing there for
30 minutes before an exhausting run. The organizers of the marathon
should have considered this.</TE>

<LD>Your recent articles on Colombia (Opinion, March 3) say little about
the systemic causes of the conflict in that country: the enforced
poverty of the exploited majority, its domination by a tiny, wealthy
elite and the strenuous efforts of the U.S. government to reinforce
this unjust situation for its own selfish purposes. The reading
public needs a deeper analysis of global capitalism if we are to halt
the continuing erosion of our democratic ideals and reduce the level
of irrational violence in this world.</LD>

<HD>Laser Radar Guns Zero In on Individual Speeders</HD>
<DH>Known as 'lidar,' the device can focus on one vehicle;
older methods cast a microwave signal over a broader area.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beneath a stand of pine trees along Sherman Way in Van Nuys, Los
Angeles Police Traffic Officer Troy Williams waits with a hunter's
disposition as his prey heads straight into his gun sight.</LD>
<LD>   A GMC Safari has surged from a pack of cars and is closing fast
from a distance of several hundred feet. Williams pulls the trigger,
which emits a high-pitched wail before a flash on his digital display
reads 61 mph--in a 35 mph zone.</LD>
<LD>   If you are among those who like to push the pedal to the metal but
dread the feeling that comes with a speeding ticket, traffic school
fees, higher insurance premiums and associated court costs, meet your
new enemy: laser radar or "lidar."</LD>
<TE>   Unlike radar, which casts a microwave signal over a broad area of
the street, lidar guns allow officers to take direct aim at a car in
individual lanes, from hundreds, even thousands of feet away.</TE>
<TE>   Most police agencies currently rely on "K-band" microwave radar,
which allows traffic officers to nab the fastest car on the road
whether they are on the move or concealed by the side of the road.</TE>
<TE>   Although radar is still the technology of choice, its big
shortcoming is its inability to pinpoint individual cars from far
away, police say. For each 100 feet an officer is removed from his or
her target, the width of the microwave beam grows by 21 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Not with lidar. Even from 1,000 feet away, a traffic cop can lock
on a target in which the beam is no wider than 3-by-3
feet--equivalent to picking a spot on a car's trunk or front grille
area.</TE>
<TE>   "The officer can take the laser beam and put it on a vehicle
whether it's coming or going and give you a reading," said Sgt. Dale
Turner of the Los Angeles Police Department's Valley Traffic
Division. "In short, it makes them better enforcers."</TE>
<TE>   Lidar's precision also gives police the ability to take speed
readings on several vehicles as they approach. On a recent winter
day, Williams was able to get readings on five vehicles within 800
feet.</TE>
<TE>   The longer lead times allow officers to flag cars down without
having to chase after them, although Williams' pursuit of the GMC
Safari traveling 61 mph took him across traffic lanes and down
Sherman Way for more than a quarter-mile.</TE>
<TE>   The technology can help law enforcement in other ways, according
to police and sheriff's deputies. Although judges uphold about 97% of
all speeding tickets, pinpointing specific vehicles effectively
counters traffic court defenses, such as "the officer got the wrong
car" or "the driver next to me was speeding," police say.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Valley Traffic Division Capt. Greg Meyer said it also makes
racial arguments moot. "From a thousand feet, it's hard to judge the
make of a car, much less the race of its driver."</TE>
<TE>   Besides nabbing speeders, traffic officers say, the devices have
proved valuable at accident scenes, providing precise measurements of
skid marks, showing a vehicle's position on the street and marking
debris fields and areas of impact.</TE>
<TE>   Lidar has its limits, however. It does not work mounted on a
moving squad car or motorcycle, which is one of the reasons the
California Highway Patrol has only a handful of the devices,
according to CHP officials.</TE>
<TE>   Nor can it provide accurate readings in foul weather or, in some
cases, when aimed at a dark-colored car with a sloped front.</TE>
<TE>   Lidar also requires a clean field of vision between gun and
target, which means that in many urban areas, officers must get
closer to the open street to use it.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Sheriff's Det. Glenn Callaway, who trains officers in
the use of lidar, says it gives drivers the benefit of the doubt
because the angle of the beam can produce readings at or below a
vehicle's actual speed.</TE>
<TE>   From a 10-degree angle off the road, the officer's reading is one
mile an hour lower than the motorist's at speeds of about 55 mph. If
the beam is fired at a 20-degree angle, the total would drop by 4
mph.</TE>
<TE>   With any speed detection technology, Callaway said, officers must
first come up with a visual speed estimation. If the speed detection
device backs up the officer's observation, he issues a ticket.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD and the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department have been slowly
accumulating the devices. At $3,500 per unit, lidar remains
prohibitively expensive for departments to deploy many of the
devices.</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff's stock of lidar guns has grown to 75 since the first
purchase in 1991, Callaway said. The agency will probably continue to
gradually get more of them.</TE>
<TE>   "Like anything else, they were big, cumbersome and very expensive
at first," Callaway said. "It took time to catch on with officers,
like myself, who were accustomed to using regular radar."</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD has 22 lidar devices spread among the city's three
traffic divisions. Valley Traffic has seven of them, which are
rotated among 30 officers trained to use them.</TE>
<TE>   Use of lidar in Valley Traffic over the last two years has
resulted in safer working conditions and increased productivity,
Meyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Valley Traffic cops snag about 14 violators a day; officers
equipped with lidar better those totals by as many as six speeding
tickets, in less time, Turner said.</TE>
<TE>   With those kinds of results on a limited basis, lidar has caught
the attention of the top brass at the LAPD. At the behest of Chief
Bernard C. Parks, Meyer said, the LAPD is trying to secure 80 more.</TE>
<TE>   In the Valley, which has had an epidemic of fatal crashes and
pedestrian fatalities, Meyer said, the goal is to equip every officer
with lidar.</TE>
<TE>   More broadly, he said, it is not just the speeder who is caught
who gets an education. As the officer prepares a ticket, he or she is
presumably providing an important lesson to those among the hundreds
of drivers going by who might consider speeding.</TE>

<HD>Harlan Howard, 74; Prolific Songwriter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Harlan Howard, the dean of Nashville songwriters who once described
country music as "three chords and the truth" and saw his own
six-decade version of the truth told through the recordings of Patsy
Cline, Ray Charles, Johnny Cash and scores more, has died. He was 74.</LD>
<LD>   Howard's name and face would go unrecognized by casual country
music fans, but not the hit recordings of songs he wrote or co-wrote,
including: "I Fall to Pieces" by Cline, "Busted" by Charles,
"Heartaches by the Number" by Ray Price and "Why Not Me?" by the
Judds.</LD>
<LD>   In all, he wrote more than 4,000 songs and had more than 100 of
his compositions crack the country top 10.</LD>
<TE>   "The world has lost its best songwriter--ever," was the simple
statement Monday from Buck Owens, a friend and collaborator who met
Howard in 1954.</TE>
<TE>   Howard died Sunday in Nashville of an apparent heart attack after
weathering a number of health problems and operations in recent
years.</TE>
<TE>   Ongoing circulation problems in his legs limited his mobility in
recent years but not his spirits, friends say.</TE>
<TE>   A beloved figure in the music industry and a noted raconteur, he
died at his home while watching the women's basketball team of
Vanderbilt, a school whose teams he followed passionately.</TE>
<TE>   "I found him with a smile on his face," his wife, Melanie
Smith-Howard, said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Harlan Perry Howard was born Sept. 8, 1927, in Detroit--a
publicist later persuaded him to cite a more industry-appropriate
birthplace of Kentucky, but he abandoned the myth in recent years,
his wife said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   His parents were indeed from Kentucky, and like many of the
transplants seeking work with the automobile industry, they brought
their love of country and blues music to Michigan. The Depression and
troubles at home splintered the family, though, and Howard spent many
of his youthful nights in foster homes.</TE>
<TE>   He dropped out of school in the ninth grade to work as a laborer
but he already had another occupation on his mind.</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by Ernest Tubb, he had fancied himself a songwriter since
the age of 12 and his unfolding life saga informed his lyrics with a
lonesome tinge.</TE>
<TE>   He joined the Army in 1947 and a stint as a paratrooper gave him
time to learn the guitar and took him close enough to Nashville to
spend weekends there, but he found it difficult to crack the city's
songwriting club.</TE>
<TE>   It was on to Tucson in 1954, and a year later to Los Angeles,
where he found steady paychecks.</TE>
<TE>   "Nashville had no factory jobs so there was no way to support
myself while I tried to write the songs," Howard told The Times in
1992.</TE>
<TE>   "L.A., on the other hand, had jobs, and there was a growing
country music scene out there.</TE>
<TE>   "Driving that fork truck was real dull, but it gave you lots of
time to goof off. I'd go home every day with six songs in my pocket."</TE>
<TE>   Moving west also led to a new friendship, with a Bakersfield
singer named Buck Owens. The two would have a series of hits, but
began their collaboration with the song "Mommy for a Day," which
Kitty Wells would record.</TE>
<TE>   Howard had by then written his first country hit, "Pick Me Up on
your Way Down," which Charlie Walker took to No. 2 on the country
charts in 1958.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, "Heartaches by the Number" was a Howard-written hit
not only for Price on the country charts, but also for Guy Mitchell,
who reached No. 1 on the pop charts.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the songwriter was working in a book bindery in Huntington
Park for $200 a week when, in 1960, he opened the mail one day and
found "Heartaches" had delivered him a royalty check for $48,000.
Within days another one, for $52,000, arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "I went out and did the typical hillbilly thing: I bought a
brand-new white-on-white Coupe de Ville," he told Robert Hilburn of
The Times in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   "Paid $5,200 cash for it.... The next thing I did was move to
Nashville and hit the ground running, writing day and night for 10 to
12 years."</TE>
<TE>   He ran hard. In 1961, he had 15 songs on the country chart at one
time.</TE>
<TE>   He also struck up cocktail friendships with other writers such as
Hank Cochran, Willie Nelson and Roger Miller at Tootsies Orchid
Lounge in Nashville, across from the Grand Ole Opry.</TE>
<TE>   Howard launched a recording career of his own, but unlike Nelson,
he could never change his sheet-music success into a performer's
spotlight--nor was Howard willing to forgo his passion for fishing to
hit the tour road.</TE>
<TE>   The zenith of his career with a microphone was "Sunday Morning
Christian," which peaked on the country chart at No. 38 in 1971.</TE>
<TE>   Others had far better luck with his compositions and they came
from all corners of the pop landscape: Cash, Burl Ives, k.d. lang,
Brenda Lee, Dean Martin, Reba McEntire, Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt,
Hank Snow, Conway Twitty and Bobby Vinton, among a list that goes on
and on.</TE>
<TE>   His songs were marked by self-effacing humor, raw heartache and a
bittersweet world view that became a touchstone quality in country
music.</TE>
<TE>   The reach of his hits earned him the nickname "the Irving Berlin
of country music" and, more simply, "Mr. Songwriter." Noted for his
doting attention to younger generations of artists, he was famous in
music circles as a mentor as well.</TE>
<TE>   "He was so good to young people," singer-songwriter Kris
Kristofferson said Monday. "He was always in our corner.... The gift
of a great Harlan song was they were direct, simple and from the
heart. He's up there with Hank Williams. He was one of the heroes."</TE>
<TE>   Rodney Crowell, from another generation of Nashville disciples
dedicated to Howard, said the songwriter brought an edge to country
and created much of its lexicon.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him he was a pre-Dylan," Crowell said Monday. "He threw
acid into the mix. He was coming behind Hank Williams and all those
sentiments were still fresh--'I've got heartaches by the numbers and
troubles by the score.' It was poetry. Harlan was right there writing
all that down."</TE>
<TE>   Howard is survived by three children by different marriages:
Jennifer Carnella, Harlan Howard Jr. and Clementyne Rucker Howard. He
also adopted a son, Carter "Corkey" Howard.</TE>
<TE>   Services are scheduled at the Roesche Patton Funeral Home in
Nashville today and Wednesday. The Ryman Auditorium at the Grand Ole
Opry will host a celebration of his life and music on March 19.</TE>

<HD>Arnold Furst, 83; Magician, Hypnotist Touted Hypnotherapy</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff  and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arnold Furst, 83, a magician and hypnotist who entertained and
instructed others in using his techniques as therapy, died Feb. 22 in
Los Angeles of natural causes after several years of failing health.</LD>
<LD>   Furst began his professional act in 1939 and toured the globe with
the USO during World War II, always traveling noticeably with his
white rabbit, Oscar. After the war, he worked in vaudeville and had a
nightclub act combining magic and hypnotism.</LD>
<LD>   Always popular in schools, Furst also entertained children
confined to hospitals. He could pull Oscar out of his hat, chop his
turban in two and put it back together, and pull money out of thin
air. But he was unable to fulfill the typical request from young
patients: "Make my cast disappear."</LD>
<TE>   In 1957, Furst collaborated with Dr. Lester Kashiwa to write the
pioneering "Case Histories in Hypnotherapy." His later books included
"How to Prepare and Administer Hypnotic Prescriptions," "Famous
Magicians of the World," "Great Magic Shows" and "Post-Hypnotic
Suggestions: How to Give Post-Hypnotic Suggestions for Therapeutic
Purposes."</TE>

<HD>Increasingly, Voters Decide Fate of Big Stores</HD>
<DH>Development: Ballots in several cities include measures
affecting big-box retailers. More campaigns are expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ALEXANDER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Development measures backed or opposed by Home Depot, Ikea and
Wal-Mart will be on the ballot today in five California cities
struggling to decide if such "big-box" stores will make life better
by creating jobs or worse by adding to suburban crowding.</LD>
<LD>   The most expensive political battle is being waged here in
Mountain View, where both sides have employed professional political
consultants and raised nearly $700,000 combined in campaign funds.
Last week, the side that favors letting Home Depot build on the site
of an abandoned department store mailed six-minute promotional video
tapes to about 14,000 voter households. The videos include
testimonials in support of the store from a City Council member, law
enforcement officials and the head of the local National Assn. for
the Advancement of Colored People.</LD>
<LD>   Increasingly in California, where interest groups and corporations
have wide power to bring local matters to a public vote, planning and
zoning decisions traditionally decided by elected officials have
become a matter of hard-fought political campaigns--with price tags
to match.</LD>
<TE>   This is especially true when it comes to the so-called big-box
retail stores, whose moves into new neighborhoods are often
controversial. On one hand, they can offer communities the prospect
of hundreds of jobs and increased sales tax revenue. But they are
sometimes reviled by local residents who believe such mega-stores
cause increased traffic and have the potential to overwhelm local
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Just to the north in the Bay Area city of East Palo Alto, voters
will decide the fate of a controversial plan to build a
300,000-square-foot Ikea furniture store. In addition to the Bay Area
towns, Southern California voters in Agoura Hills will decide a
measure that would block any store greater than 60,000 square feet,
an initiative aimed at quashing a proposed Home Depot. And residents
of Calexico, in Imperial County, will vote on a measure backed by
Wal-Mart to overturn limits on the floor space that large retailers
are allowed to dedicate to grocery sales.</TE>
<TE>   In the Central Valley city of Reedley, voters will also find a
measure on today's ballot aimed at stopping another proposed Wal-Mart
even though the Bentonville, Ark., corporation has withdrawn plans to
build there. The ballots were printed before the withdrawal occurred.</TE>
<TE>   In communities around the country, these measures are making their
way to voters for two reasons, according to Al Norman, the founder of
an organization called Sprawl Busters, which is dedicated to fighting
big-box retail stores. "Sometimes developers see it as an opportunity
to buy their way past a recalcitrant city council," he said. "On the
other hand, these kinds of initiatives are proving attractive to
citizens groups who feel that their elected officials are
unresponsive."</TE>
<TE>   In Mountain View's case, Home Depot began collecting signatures to
put its proposal on the ballot when it seemed the City Council would
balk at plans for the new store. Eager to head off the expense of
holding a special election, the council then voted to put the measure
on today's ballot rather than wait for Home Depot to round up
support.</TE>
<TE>   Norman's Web site chronicles nearly two dozen big-box electoral
battles over the last four years, from Topsham, Maine, to Huntington
Beach, where a 150,000-square-foot Wal-Mart was approved two years
ago with 54% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   There are no conclusive studies on the percentage of stores that
win approval from voters.</TE>
<TE>   The high-stakes electoral battle over individual stores "is going
to be an increasing phenomenon," said public relations executive Jon
Rubin, who managed a successful campaign to build a Costco in the
city of South San Francisco in 1999. "City governments want the money
that such stores bring in, but they don't want to be accused of not
being responsible planners."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, though, some policy experts say a community's hands-on
approach can at times make responsible planning more difficult by
tackling the issue in piecemeal fashion, store by store, instead of
looking at the larger picture.</TE>
<TE>   "I waiver between two opposite ends," said public policy professor
Al Sokolow, a specialist in land-use politics at UC Davis. "It's
great that we have this opportunity for citizen participation, but on
the other hand it undercuts the representative process in which local
government is supposed to operate."</TE>
<TE>   Robert S. Lawrence, a former planning director for Mountain View
agrees. He opposes the proposed Home Depot, but said, "Whether or not
we have the store is not the issue. We have this elaborate planning
process now, which is a pretty sophisticated way for the city to make
its own decisions about what the community is going to look like.
This proposal really just overrides that."</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence, who led the city's Planning Department in the 1960s and
1970s, said there have been plenty of times in Mountain View's
history when the planning process has managed to stop unwanted
development.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, however, city councils "are not able to withstand the
pressures and the influence and the money that the big-box stores are
able to throw at a moment's notice," said Albert Abrams, who works
with a group opposing the Agoura Hills Home Depot. "I think it's
terrific that people in towns like Agoura Hills have the right to
choose their own destiny."</TE>
<TE>   For the stores, the ability to expand into new markets is crucial
in driving revenues. Home Depot opened 204 stores last year, and
reported record net earnings of $3 billion. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the
world's largest retailer, announced in October that it plans to open
about 185 super centers, and 50 smaller stores domestically this
year. The company also plans to open as many as 55 Sam's Club stores
in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we would prefer to be able to go through the process
of doing this the typical way, by going through the city council,"
said Peter Kanelos, Wal-Mart's community affairs manager for
California. "It is more expensive to go through an election, but when
it happens we respect the citizens' ability to make decisions based
on the democratic process. It's just a cost of doing business."</TE>

<HD>Community Colleges Fear Loss of Funds for Support Program</HD>
<DH>Education: Students trying to get off welfare are given
assistance from CalWORKs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When caring for her two young sons and her 90-year-old
grandmother make Laketha Moore feel as if her body will give out,
when finals roll around and she feels overwhelmed, there's an office at
her college that helps her manage it all.</LD>
<LD>   The counselors who staff the bungalow office at Los Angeles
Southwest College are there to make sure students such as Moore have
the support they need to stay in school, find a stable job and
ultimately end their dependence on welfare.</LD>
<LD>   The program, called Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids
(or CalWORKs), was created in 1997 to ensure that welfare did not
become a permanent crutch.</LD>
<TE>   However, budget cuts proposed by Gov. Gray Davis that would reduce
funding for the program from $65 million to $7 million make community
colleges statewide wonder if they will be able to maintain it.
"CalWORKs is supposed to be my steppingstone," Moore, 24, said. "My
steppingstone is going to be pulled out from under my feet, and I'm
going to fall hard."</TE>
<TE>   Under CalWORKs rules, applicants can remain on aid for up to five
years, but must meanwhile take a job anywhere they can get one or
enroll in vocational training.</TE>
<TE>   Many students, like Moore, opt to attend a training program at one
of the state's 108 community colleges.</TE>
<TE>   Hilary McLean, a spokeswoman for the governor, said the cut was
made because the services community colleges provide can be funded
through other sources--for example, by individual colleges. Some
college officials say that would be next to impossible.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a struggling college--the college couldn't pick up those
services," said Audre Levy, president of Southwest, where about 40%
of students participate in CalWORKs.</TE>
<TE>   Moore knows that if the office didn't exist, she'd likely drop out
of school and be forced to take a minimum-wage job to support her
children, Anthony, 8, and Antwoine, 4.</TE>
<TE>   Students such as Moore would still be able to take classes, as
tuition at community colleges is about $11 per unit. And child care,
which weighs heavily on parents' ability to attend school, would
remain in the governor's budget at $15 million.</TE>
<TE>   But students and CalWORKs providers are afraid that without the
services of a central office with familiar and reliable staff to
offer support, many students would quit school.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the office offers personal and academic
counseling, links students to work-study jobs and helps them navigate
the bureaucratic world of welfare.</TE>
<TE>   Students visit the offices several times a day with basic needs:
money for lunch or books, transportation, parenting advice or even a
pep talk.</TE>
<TE>   The CalWORKs staff at Santa Monica College helped Tanya Powell, a
single mother of four young boys, find an affordable used minivan.
Now, she doesn't have to wake up at 4 a.m. to take her children to
school and get to her own classes.</TE>
<TE>   "They take our problems home with them and figure out how to help
us," Powell said of the CalWORKs staff.</TE>
<TE>   McLean said one way to keep the CalWORKs services would be to have
counties pay for them to be maintained on college campuses. But
Patrick Lenz, executive vice chancellor for the California Community
Colleges, and others are worried that some counties would focus
solely on job placement.</TE>
<TE>   "That may preclude current CalWORKs students from continuing their
education, leaving them to take whatever job is available," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tracey Ellis, project manager of the CalWORKs program at Santa
Monica College, is skeptical that Los Angeles County would be able to
cover the costs and provide the personal attention CalWORKs students
need.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just not a supportive environment where you can go in to get
help," Ellis said.</TE>
<TE>   Otto Solorzano, chief financial officer for the Los Angeles County
Department of Public Social Services, said cutting state funding for
CalWORKs would require curtailing other county programs.</TE>
<TE>   "The county doesn't have the funding to cover the need," Solorzano
said. "It just doesn't seem possible to me."</TE>
<TE>   Moore, too, hopes the governor will reconsider when he does his
final budget review in May. She came to college with a "bad
attitude," wanting only to get her vocational certificate and leave.
But CalWORKs staff members told her she had potential, something she
never heard growing up.</TE>
<TE>   "If this office didn't exist, the first semester I would have been
gone," she said. "I just need this door to stay open--just for a
little while."</TE>

<HD>Resistance Leads to Fewer Options for Treating STD</HD>
<DH>Health: Officials fear that California doctors may be
forced to stop prescribing Cipro and other common antibiotics in
gonorrhea cases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A rise in a drug-resistant form of gonorrhea in California is forcing
health officials to turn away from a widely used, inexpensive
antibiotic treatment, further narrowing their options to fight the
sexually transmitted disease.</LD>
<LD>   Officials say they are finding an increased number of gonorrhea
infections that are resistant to the fluoroquinolone class of
antibiotics, which includes Cipro. Gonorrhea, considered a "smart"
bacteria, long ago developed mechanisms to resist other antibiotics,
including penicillin.</LD>
<LD>   Antibiotic resistance is a growing concern across the nation
because doctors have fewer options when germs or bacteria develop
ways to evade drugs.</LD>
<TE>   Health officials in San Francisco and San Diego have already
advised doctors to avoid Cipro and similar antibiotics in treating
gonorrhea.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they have recommended cephalosporins, the last known
class of antibiotics proven to treat the disease without resistance.
Those drugs typically cost more per pill and sometimes must be
injected.</TE>
<TE>   The increased level of resistance, which has taken hold in the
last year, is most common in gay and bisexual men, as well as people
who have had sexual partners from Asia, where this resistance is now
widespread.</TE>
<TE>   Health officials from across California are meeting this week at
the National STD Prevention Conference in San Diego, where they will
discuss whether to rewrite treatment recommendations for all doctors
in the state.</TE>
<TE>   "We're losing our ability to treat this infection if we're left
with one type of antibiotic that can be used," said Dr. Gail Bolan,
chief of the Sexually Transmitted Disease Control Branch at the
California Department of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   Federal health officials are also worried because about 650,000
new cases of gonorrhea occur each year in the United States. The most
common symptoms include discharge from the sexual organs and painful
or difficult urination.</TE>
<TE>   Four percent of gonorrhea cases--16 of 369--studied in Southern
California in the last six months of 2001 were resistant to Cipro and
other fluoroquinolones, officials say. While this number may seem
small, it is significant because gonorrhea readily acquires
resistance, and doctors can't easily tell which patients have a
resistant form.</TE>
<TE>   "Once it's above a couple percent, you would want to change your
prescribing pattern," said Dr. Stuart Berman, who monitors STD cases
for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County officials say they are monitoring the situation
but have not abandoned Cipro.</TE>
<TE>   "It concerns me every time we lose antibiotics in our cornucopia.
It's not necessarily surprising--[gonorrhea is] the one organism that
doctors know will quickly become resistant to antibiotics," said Dr.
Jeffrey Klausner, director of sexually transmitted disease control in
San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Berman said officials are not certain how many cases of
drug-resistant gonorrhea exist in the country because few clinics
test for such resistance. "We're blind in a lot of areas of the
country, just when it appears we'll need that information to make
appropriate clinical decisions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   While officials are primarily concerned about gonorrhea
resistance, they also are becoming worried about signs of resistant
forms of trichomoniasis, a parasite, and chlamydia, a bacterium, both
of which are transmitted sexually.</TE>

<HD>Bicyclists Without ID Can Be Searched, State High Court
Says</HD>
<DH>Law: Police can make arrests for such offenses as riding on
the wrong side of street. Dissenting judge says ruling could lead to
discrimination.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Police may arrest and search bicyclists for riding on the wrong side of
the street if the cyclist has no identification, the California Supreme
Court ruled Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The state high court based its decision on a U.S. Supreme Court
ruling last year that upheld the arrest and jailing of a Texas mother
who was taken into custody because she and her two children were not
wearing their seat belts.</LD>
<LD>   In the California case, a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy
stopped Conrad Richard McKay in 1999 for riding his bicycle in the
wrong direction on a residential street in Lawndale. McKay, who was
32 at the time, did not have any identification but told the deputy
his name and address.</LD>
<TE>   The deputy then arrested and searched McKay and found a bag of a
white substance in his sock. The substance turned out to be
methamphetamine. McKay pleaded guilty and served 32 months in state
prison.</TE>
<TE>   In an appeal, he argued that his arrest for such a minor traffic
offense violated the 4th Amendment prohibition on unreasonable
seizures.</TE>
<TE>   McKay was arrested for violating a state law that requires a
bicycle to be operated "in the same direction as vehicles are
required to be driven upon the roadway." The law is punishable by a
fine not to exceed $100. Under another state law, an officer who
cites an offender for a minor offense must release him unless he
fails to present identification or refuses to promise to appear in
court.</TE>
<TE>   But the state high court ruled 6 to 1 in People vs. McKay,
S091421, that the arrest complied with state law and the U.S. Supreme
Court decision in the Texas case. Under the high court decision,
"there is nothing inherently unconstitutional about effecting a
custodial arrest for a fine-only offense," Justice Marvin Baxter
wrote for the court.</TE>
<TE>   "An offender may avoid a custodial arrest by presenting a driver's
license to the officer for examination," Baxter wrote. If the license
is valid, the cyclist may be cited and released, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The court stressed that it is up to the officer to determine
whether a person without identification should be brought to a
magistrate.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Janice Rogers Brown dissented. She argued the decision
could lead to discriminatory enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not know Mr. McKay's ethnic background," she wrote. "One
thing I would bet on: He was not riding his bike a few doors down
from his home in Bel-Air, or Brentwood, or Rancho Palos
Verdes--places where no resident would be arrested for riding the
'wrong way' on a bicycle whether he had his driver's license or not."</TE>
<TE>   "Well," she continued, "it would not get anyone arrested unless he
looked like he did not belong in the neighborhood. That is the
problem. And it matters."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Atty. Gen. Thomas C. Hsieh said the case was not about
racial profiling. McKay, Hsieh said, is white.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. Supreme Court has already dealt with this issue," Hsieh
said. "Basically, there is just not a lot of evidence that this sort
of thing is happening a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Tokaji, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties
Union of Southern California, said the ruling "comes perilously close
to imposing a requirement that to walk a street or ride a bicycle on
the street, you need to carry an ID."</TE>
<TE>   "Providing such unfettered discretion to police officers is the
equivalent to a license to discriminate," Tokaji said. "The decision
runs the risk of aggravating racial profiling and people being
searched and arrested for driving while black."</TE>

<CX>   Bicycle rider's race--An article in Tuesday's California section
misidentified the race of Conrad Richard McKay because of erroneous
information provided to The Times by a deputy attorney general. The
prosecutor said in the article that McKay is white, basing the statement
on information in a county probation report. According to the state
Department of Corrections, McKay, whose 1999 arrest was upheld by the
state Supreme Court on Monday, is African American. McKay was taken into
custody and searched for riding his bicycle in the wrong direction on a
residential street and not carrying identification.</CX>

<HD>Dogs Pounced on Victim's Throat, Official Testifies</HD>
<DH>Trial: They went for Diane Whipple's neck, severing her
jugular vein, puncturing her larynx, says chief medical examiner.
Defense will begin its rebuttal today.</DH>

<LD>Dog-mauling victim Diane Whipple was killed in the same way a lion
pounces on its prey, suffering bruises and cuts everywhere except for
the soles of her feet and the top of her head, a chief medical
examiner testified Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The most severe wounds were to Whipple's neck, where her jugular
vein was severed and her larynx was punctured, Dr. Boyd Stephens told
jurors in Los Angeles County Superior Court.</LD>
<LD>   "It is not uncommon for a carnivore to go for the neck," said
Stephens, chief medical examiner in San Francisco. "Many carnivores
kill by asphyxiating the animal ... by crushing the larynx and
cutting off the air supply."</LD>
<TE>   Whipple, a 33-year-old lacrosse coach, died Jan. 26, 2001, after
being attacked by two Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her San
Francisco apartment complex.</TE>
<TE>   The dogs' owners, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel, are on trial
for involuntary manslaughter in connection with their neighbor's
death. Knoller, who was in the hallway at the time of the attack,
also faces a second-degree murder charge.</TE>
<TE>   The case was moved to Los Angeles because of publicity in the Bay
Area.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors, who finished presenting their witnesses Monday,
maintain that the defendants knew their dogs were dangerous and did
nothing to prevent Whipple's death. Defense attorneys, who will begin
to present their case today, counter that Knoller tried to protect
Whipple by shielding her with her body, and that Noel isn't to blame
because he wasn't present during the attack.</TE>
<TE>   During his testimony, Stephens showed jurors where the dogs had
bitten or clawed Whipple by pointing to more than 30 detailed autopsy
photographs, which were enlarged on a screen. "These injuries cover
just about every part of her body," Stephens said.</TE>
<TE>   Whipple's mother, Penny Whipple-Kelly, left the courtroom when
prosecutors started displaying the graphic photographs.</TE>
<TE>   Stephens testified that Whipple was injured in 77 areas of her
body. He identified several dog bite marks, and said they matched the
teeth of one of the two dogs that mauled Whipple.</TE>
<TE>   Whipple, who was in excellent health before the attack, died from
asphyxiation and blood loss, he said.</TE>
<TE>   During cross examination, defense attorney Nedra Ruiz asked
Stephens if earlier medical response could have saved Whipple.
Stephens said that it could have made a difference, but that she
still probably would have died because she lost one-third of her
blood.</TE>
<TE>   In response to Ruiz's questioning, Stephens also said it was
possible that Knoller could have been covering one part of Whipple's
body while the dogs were biting another.</TE>
<TE>   But he also stated: "At the time that the specific injuries
occurred, there couldn't be anything between Ms. Whipple and the
dog."</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Dist. Atty. Kimberly Guilfoyle Newsom said outside the
courtroom that the evidence does not support Knoller's story that she
tried to save Whipple. "Why does [Knoller] have just two small
insignificant injuries and Diane Whipple has 77?" she said.</TE>

<HD>Miramar Neighbors Fear Promised Work May Be Stalled by
Vegas Deal</HD>
<DH>Montecito: Hotelier's vow to complete resort is followed by
news of possible casino project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM OVEREND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just days after he tried to mollify Montecito residents angered by
his stalled Miramar Hotel renovation, international hotelier Ian
Schrager has infuriated them all over again.</LD>
<LD>   Blaming a poor economy for the project's long delays, Schrager
pledged before community critics last week to make the Miramar's
completion his top corporate priority.</LD>
<LD>   That vow was followed almost immediately by news he is interested
in a $200-million renovation of a bankrupt Las Vegas casino.</LD>
<TE>   "It's mind-boggling," said Jeffrey Hayden, one of Schrager's chief
Miramar critics. "First he tells us he has no money; then he says he
is planning to spend a fortune in Vegas.... This guy belongs in Las
Vegas. They are gonna love him there."</TE>
<TE>   By Monday, community reaction to the buzz that Schrager might
shift his interest to Las Vegas had the top aide to Santa Barbara
County Supervisor Naomi Schwartz on the phone to New York. He said he
warned Schrager about Montecito's renewed concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked at length about the community's feelings," said the
aide, Salud Carbajal. "Like the community, we felt there seemed to be
confusing messages, which obviously trigger concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't go into the Las Vegas situation much," Carbajal added.
"He said the set of facts surrounding his involvement in Las Vegas is
different from the set of facts surrounding his involvement with the
Miramar."</TE>
<TE>   Carbajal told Schrager he needs to address the community's new
concerns about possible plans to renovate the Maxim hotel in Las
Vegas, as reported in the Wall Street Journal. He suggested Schrager
write a letter, and was told that the hotelier would give that
proposal "serious consideration."</TE>
<TE>   The newest twist in the Miramar controversy follows more than a
year of increasing community hostility toward Schrager, who told a
Montecito crowd last week that he stopped renovation on the Miramar
15 months ago because of a softening economy.</TE>
<TE>   In halting the work, he walked away from uprooted palm trees,
half-wrecked cottages, a ripped-out swimming pool and other
demolition at the 13-acre site that local residents dubbed "the
mudhole."</TE>
<TE>   "But I am encouraged now," Schrager said in the meeting with
community leaders. "The economy is improving. I have come here to ask
you to be a little more patient with us.... I see light at the end of
the tunnel."</TE>
<TE>   J'Amy Brown, a board member of the Montecito Assn., was among the
more skeptical that night. One of the crowd's complaints was that
Schrager had been virtually impossible to reach, and he had told them
to get business cards from an aide after the meeting. When Brown
asked for one, she was told they didn't have any.</TE>
<TE>   "That was just a few minutes after the meeting, and I was already
starting to feel done in," Brown said. "The next morning I almost
fell out of bed. There was a story in the paper saying he had put $1
million down on the Maxim, with an option to buy for $38 million and
plans for a $200-million renovation.</TE>
<TE>   "I was shocked and hurt," Brown said. "He hadn't said a word about
this to us. He betrayed everybody in that room all over again."</TE>
<TE>   The Maxim hotel, just off the Las Vegas Strip, has been in and out
of bankruptcy court over the years. Currently in bankruptcy again, it
has been closed since August 2001 and is now owned by a Houston
company, Revanche LLC.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Stevens, attorney for Revanche, said Monday that he could
not comment on Schrager's interest in the Maxim, because any
arrangement like the one reported would be covered by a
confidentiality agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "We wouldn't break a confidentiality agreement," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Schrager, the former owner of New York's Studio 54 who served 13
months in federal prison for income tax evasion linked to the
nightclub, declined to comment Monday about the Maxim, the Miramar,
his critics or his plans.</TE>
<TE>   A onetime potential competitor for the Maxim spoke up for
Schrager. "Local people in Santa Barbara are saying if he can buy the
Maxim, why can't he fix up the Miramar.... I can understand that,"
said Lew Wolff, co-owner of the Los Angeles hotel firm Maritz &amp;
Wolff. He was once interested in the Maxim himself, Wolff said.</TE>
<TE>   "Ian is, in today's world, a very honorable person," Wolff
volunteered.</TE>
<TE>   The Montecito Assn.'s Brown had more news Monday about the Miramar
site--good news. Schrager is carrying out one of the promises his
staff made to the Montecitans, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was driving by the Miramar today," Brown said, "and there were
two people out there tossing grass seed around. They said it should
be coming up in a couple weeks."</TE>

<HD>San Diego's Bid to Change Water Formula Is Rejected</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge has rejected a bid by the San Diego County water board to
invalidate a regulation that could give the city of Los Angeles the
right to take half of San Diego's water during a drought.</LD>
<LD>   Without comment, San Francisco Superior Court Judge James J.
McBride agreed with the Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California that the drought formula that spells out "preferential
rights" for MWD members is clearly defined in the 1931 law that
created the regional water wholesaler.</LD>
<LD>   Under the formula, Los Angeles has the right to buy 23% of MWD's
water while San Diego County has the right to only 14%.</LD>
<TE>   The disparity reflects a historical advantage Los Angeles enjoys
as a founding member of MWD in the 1920s. San Diego County, by
contrast, only joined when forced to do so by President Franklin
Roosevelt during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, Los Angeles buys only 8% of MWD water but San Diego
County buys 26%. With little native ground water, San Diego is
dependent on MWD for virtually all of its water.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego officials have long feared that during a drought or
other water emergency Los Angeles would invoke its right to increase
its water purchases, thus depriving San Diego of needed water and
devastating its economy.</TE>
<TE>   Those fears increased during the electricity deregulation crisis,
when prices skyrocketed in San Diego County while remaining stable in
Los Angeles. The then-mayor of Los Angeles, Richard Riordan, condoned
the city Department of Water and Power's policy of demanding top
dollar for excess electricity.</TE>
<TE>   In its lawsuit over water, the San Diego County Water Authority
claims that the 1931 formula allocating rights according to how much
each of MWD's 26 member agencies has paid to build the system's
massive infrastructure is tilted toward Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   As MWD's biggest and unhappiest customer, San Diego asserts that
the formula should be altered to give San Diego more credit for the
money spent to purchase water. As San Diego sees it, the county is
paying to maintain an MWD water system that will benefit Los Angeles
during a drought.</TE>
<TE>   Though unwilling to change the formula to appease San Diego, the
MWD board insists that the formula has never been invoked.</TE>
<TE>   "In the end, this was an expensive lawsuit over a theoretical
water allocation statute that has never been applied, even in the
face of two severe droughts, and that we have no plans to exercise,"
said MWD board Chairman Phillip J. Pace.</TE>
<TE>   A San Francisco judge was selected to hear the case because
neither San Diego nor MWD trusted a judge in the other's region. San
Diego has vowed to appeal the decision, handed down late last week.</TE>

<LD>* Hot Topic Inc., a clothing and accessories retailer aimed at teens,
said fiscal fourth-quarter profit jumped 20% to $12.5 million, or 38
cents a share, beating analysts' expectations by a penny. The City of
Industry-based company said sales grew 23% in the quarter ended Feb.
2 to $109.1 million. Hot Topic also said it expects earnings of $1.03
a share for 2002, much better than the 85 cents analysts forecast.
Shares of Hot Topic closed down $2.17 at $21.88 on Nasdaq, before the
results were released.</LD>
<LD>   * Strouds Inc., a seller of bed and bath linens, won a Bankruptcy
Court judge's approval of its liquidation plan to wind down the
business and distribute money to its creditors. The judge in
Wilmington, Del., approved the plan at a hearing after 95% of the
City of Industry-based company's unsecured creditors voted to accept
it. The plan calls for secured creditors to be paid in full.
Unsecured creditors will receive a portion of their claims from money
remaining after priority claims are paid, the company said.
Shareholders will receive nothing.</LD>

<CX>   Strouds--A Business section brief March 5 about a judge's approval
of Strouds Inc.'s liquidation plan incorrectly reported that Strouds Inc.
was a seller of bed and bath linens. In fact, it is a former seller of
bed and bath linens. The Strouds stores, owned by a different company,
are unaffected. Strouds Inc., which was based in City of Industry, last
April completed its sale of its 50 stores, corporate headquarters and
other assets for $39.5 million to Strouds Acquisition Corp., a group made
up of some company executives and officials of investment firm Cruttenden
Partners.</CX>

<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. shareholders sued to stop the computer maker's
proposed $21.9-billion purchase of Compaq Computer Corp., saying
executives withheld information about the risks of merging.</LD>
<LD>   The shareholders claim the company and its officers and directors
omitted material information in proxy papers about the proposed
acquisition, according to a news release distributed by law firm
Weiss &amp; Yourman.</LD>
<LD>   The complaint, filed Feb. 11 in federal court in San Francisco,
seeks to stop the March 19 merger vote until a corrected proxy
statement is issued and shareholders are compensated for the mistake.</LD>

<LD>The San Francisco Examiner plans to become a tabloid in an effort to
make readers "perk up and take notice" of the newspaper, which has
been marked by management upheaval since an ownership change in late
2000.</LD>
<LD>   The switch from the industry's more common broadsheet format
should occur by mid-May, according to a staff memo from Examiner
Executive Editor Zoran Basich.</LD>
<LD>   The new format "will emphasize our editorial strengths and cause
[San Francisco] to perk up and take notice," Basich wrote. Basich
described the new look as "a great opportunity to take our newspaper
to the next level."</LD>

<LD>IM Internationalmedia's stock plunged more than 50% after the company
announced that it would be restating its earnings and that merger
talks with Spyglass Entertainment had been unsuccessful. On the
Frankfurt Neuer Market the company's shares closed at $6.22 Monday,
down from its Friday close of $16.26.</LD>
<LD>   The film production and finance company with offices in Munich,
London and Los Angeles said that, instead of merging with Spyglass,
its Los Angeles-based subsidiary, Intermedia, would reorganize its
operations to focus on producing big-budget event movies. The company
said it is restating its finances as part of a change in its
accounting systems, which will have a significant negative effect on
the 2001 year-end figures to be presented March 14.</LD>

<HD>Kodak Launches Digital Cinema Promotion Unit</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eastman Kodak Co., the largest photography company, has created a
unit that will try to make its expensive digital film projectors more
appealing to movie theaters by spreading some of the costs to movie
studios.</LD>
<LD>   With a target price of about $150,000 a screen, Kodak expects to
begin installing digital-cinema systems in the first quarter of 2003,
said Robert Mayson, general manager of Cinema Operations. The unit is
based in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   Theater owners have been slow to replace analog projectors because
of the high cost of digital systems and say the technology benefits
movie studios more because it reduces their distribution costs.</LD>
<TE>   "We are not in a real rush to put this in our theaters," said
Loews Cineplex Entertainment Corp. spokeswoman Mindy Tucker. "We are
looking to the studios to take the lead in financing any roll-out of
digital cinema."</TE>
<TE>   Kodak demonstrated a prototype of its digital system to
motion-picture industry suppliers and distributors at a conference in
Las Vegas on Monday. The technology offers a scratch-free,
higher-resolution picture that doesn't deteriorate with age as does
traditional film. Texas Instruments Inc. and Barco also have
developed digital projectors.</TE>

<LD>U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson confessed in court that he
downloaded several unauthorized copies of songs from an online
file-sharing service--in the interests of justice, naturally.</LD>
<LD>   Wilson is presiding over two copyright infringement lawsuits in
Los Angeles that the entertainment industry brought against
StreamCast Networks' Morpheus, Sharman Networks' Kazaa and Grokster,
three of the most popular file-sharing systems.</LD>
<LD>   At a pretrial conference, Wilson told lawyers that he'd never used
a file-sharing service before, and as a music lover he wanted to see
what the experience was like.</LD>
<TE>   "So I tried it. It works. Got some nice music," Wilson said,
sending laughter through the courtroom. "I hope this doesn't
disqualify me."</TE>
<TE>   Known for moving cases along quickly, Wilson set a trial date of
Oct. 1 and ordered that the cases, which are expected to be
consolidated, be heard by a jury.</TE>

<HD>Longtime Catholic High School Principal Resigns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Merritt Hemenway, principal of Santa Margarita Catholic High School,
surprised faculty and parents by announcing his resignation after
eight years on the job.</LD>
<LD>   Praised by staff members as a visionary, Hemenway was a strong
proponent of computers in the classrooms.</LD>
<LD>   Hemenway, 55, notified parents in a letter in mid-February of his
plans to depart at the end of the school year.</LD>
<TE>   "The suddenness of it surprises me," assistant athletic director
Doug Williams said. "I didn't see it coming. He had done a lot of
positive things here. He's a good man."</TE>
<TE>   Hemenway was not available for comment Monday. But in his two-page
letter to parents, he said he planned to seek employment in "Catholic
ministry" and that "additional courses" will prepare him for a
greater role in ministry. He will leave the south Orange County
school June 30, ending a 22-year career as a high school principal.</TE>
<TE>   Hemenway was Santa Margarita's second principal. He replaced Msgr.
Michael Harris, the charismatic founding principal who left shortly
before the Diocese of Orange revealed he had been accused of sexual
improprieties.</TE>
<TE>   Before taking the top job at Santa Margarita, Hemenway was
principal at Bishop Amat High in La Puente and Cantwell-Sacred Heart
of Mary High in Montebello.</TE>
<TE>   At Santa Margarita, Hemenway was named California principal of the
year by the National Assn. of Secondary School Principals in 1998. It
was the same year the high school was cited as a National Blue Ribbon
School by the U.S. Department of Education and began offering the
prestigious International Baccalaureate Program.</TE>
<TE>   "We were probably out in front of a lot of schools in most of the
high-tech stuff," said Greg Giuliano, Santa Margarita's dean of
students. "That's really been a passion of his. We were probably one
of first schools to have a TV, VCR and computer in every classroom.
We've got parents keeping track of grades and attendance via the
Internet."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita's athletic programs also thrived under Hemenway.
The school won many Southern Section titles in boys' and girls'
sports. Hemenway strongly opposed the idea of Santa Margarita leaving
a public school athletic league for an all-Catholic league because he
believed athletes would miss too much class time traveling to schools
out of the area. Santa Margarita eventually was placed in a Catholic
league in 1999.</TE>

<HD>Priest's Ouster Marks Change in O.C. Church</HD>
<DH>Religion: Bishop Brown draws praise, criticism for his
openness in handling the dismissal of a teenage boy's molester.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In dismissing a priest Monday for molesting a teenage boy 19 years
ago, Bishop of Orange Tod D. Brown took a number of steps rare for
the traditionally secretive Roman Catholic Church.</LD>
<LD>   He brought aboard a crisis public relations specialist. He allowed
the priest, Michael Pecharich, to say goodbye to many of his 16,000
parishioners at services this past weekend. He set up discussion
sessions after Mass for shocked congregants. He even sent press
releases to the media and allowed news photographers to take pictures
as Pecharich gave his farewell.</LD>
<LD>   The public display stands in marked contrast to the approach taken
by the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, which quietly let go as many as a
dozen priests in the past two weeks under the same zero-tolerance
policy the Orange diocese follows. That policy was part of a
settlement agreement reached in August by the two dioceses over
separate accusations of molestations by priests.</LD>
<TE>   "This is their track record," said Mary Grant, a victim of sexual
abuse by an Orange County priest and founder of the Southern
California chapter of the Survivors Network of those Abused by
Priests. "There's something always concealed. It's not acceptable to
hide the perpetrators."</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, Grant and other observers of the church said
they were generally pleased with the new move toward openness. "They
should be open and honest like this," said David Belz, a longtime
church member and Pecharich supporter. "There's going to be pain no
matter what. To handle it up front is what's appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   The new approach is not without critics. At San Francisco Solano,
some parishioners thought the matter should have been handled
privately and resented the presence of the press at an emotional time
for their congregation. Nervous priests wondered why the bishop made
the announcement while the church officials were still checking the
backgrounds of other diocese employees.</TE>
<TE>   Diocesan officials admit to struggling with the details of
openness: How can they balance the rights of the victims, the clergy
and the public?</TE>
<TE>   "It's a learning process about what's the best way to do this,"
said Father Michael McKiernan, director of clergy personnel. "Is it
better for someone to just disappear? Or should he say goodbye?"</TE>
<TE>   And other congregants, stung by the decision to remove Pecharich,
have asked why the bishop, who advocates openness, didn't visit the
parish Sunday to face angry parishioners. The news was announced at
services in Rancho Santa Margarita on Saturday evening and Sunday
morning, and the dismissal became effective Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "He is the shepherd of his flock, and his flock was in the most
dire emergency it could be in," parishioner Bob Beauchamp said. "Even
if Father Michael said, 'I don't want [the bishop] there,' he should
have been there. It was cowardly."</TE>
<TE>   Beauchamp also said the diocesan officials' explanations changed
with each meeting, including the reason for the bishop's absence.
"Their story got better as the meetings went on," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Parishioner Maureen McCarthy said she didn't know if news of
Pecharich's departure could ever remain within the congregation,
though she wished it could have. "I never would have liked it to go
this public," she said. "I don't see why his dirty laundry had to be
aired."</TE>
<TE>   Priests, though not willing to openly criticize their boss, have
asked why the public announcement wasn't held off until a task force
was able to complete its investigation into whether diocesan priests
have substantiated molestation charges in their backgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   But Brown, who was installed as bishop of Orange in 1998, said
it's his duty to report to the public the cases as they are found,
adding that the process should be finished shortly.</TE>
<TE>   "We just think it's important to deal with it as it becomes known
and as we ourselves become aware of it," Brown said. He said the
diocese reported the matter to county Child Protective Services in
1996, when it found out about the molestation.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the more public approach, Pecharich wrote a letter to
his parishioners that was handed out Sunday as they left Mass.</TE>
<TE>   One San Francisco Solano parishioner who liked the new approach is
Meg Waters, who handles crisis public relations for such groups as
the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, a coalition of cities fighting
an airport at El Toro. She heard about her pastor's removal when the
diocese called Feb. 26 to enlist her services when making the public
announcement. She said she spent the next few days talking with
church officials and developing a plan.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to at least praise Bishop Brown for doing the right thing,
not keeping it secret," said Katherine K. Freberg, an Irvine attorney
who settled a molestation case against the Diocese of Orange for a
record $5.2 million in August.</TE>
<TE>   But she added that she didn't think Pecharich should have been
allowed to take the pulpit a final time.</TE>
<TE>   "I can understand why they allow it, but the church is coddling
these priests. Until they treat them for what they
are--criminals--there's not going to be real change."</TE>

<HD>Center Gives Ailing Birds of Prey Another Chance to Take
Wing</HD>
<DH>Ojai: Kim Stroud's mountaintop center provides sanctuary
and rehabilitation for injured raptors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Sasquatch needs to feel like a bird again, Kim Stroud takes him
to a mountaintop in Ojai where he looks over the valley floor and
feels the breeze beneath his useless wings.</LD>
<LD>   The red-tailed hawk, crippled by a bone disease, will fluff his
feathers and lean into the wind.</LD>
<LD>   "He feels like he's flying," said Stroud, director of the Ojai
Raptor Center in Oak View. "We try and offer the birds a good quality
of life here."</LD>
<TE>   Stroud rehabilitates injured birds of prey. They include hawks,
eagles, owls and falcons, along with an occasional heron or duck.</TE>
<TE>   For those beyond repair, she offers the raptor equivalent of a
convalescent home.</TE>
<TE>   Stroud, 45, who started the center two years ago, says it's the
only place between Los Angeles and Santa Maria specializing in
raptors.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always been drawn to raptors," she said, looking into the
deep yellow eyes of a Harris hawk on her arm. "They are majestic and
beautiful. It satisfies a longing in my soul, and it's an honor to
take care of them."</TE>
<TE>   But raptors, she cautions, aren't pets. In fact, they don't like
people. Joker, a half-blind black-crowned night heron, will jab his
dagger-like beak at the eyes of anyone who gets too close.</TE>
<TE>   And the bald and golden eagles can crush human bones with their
sharp yellow talons.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people want warm and fuzzy pets," Stroud said. "These
aren't like that. They are wild animals whose motivation is simply to
eat, fly and procreate."</TE>
<TE>   The 20 birds at the center suffer a variety of ailments and
injuries. A golden eagle had a wing shot off. A peregrine falcon,
which can dive at more than 100 mph, lost a wing when it hit a power
line. A Harris hawk slammed into a building while chasing prey.</TE>
<TE>   And then there are birds like the great horned owl named Luna, who
was fed as a baby by humans and can no longer find food on her own or
relate to other birds. Once released, Luna was later caught trying to
pry open the sliding glass door of a home looking for lunch.</TE>
<TE>   Birds that can be rehabilitated are first taken to a veterinarian.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Matt Bailey of the Matilija Veterinary Hospital in Ojai treats
many of the animals. If a bird breaks a wing, he performs surgery for
a reduced fee and applies a wing wrap to immobilize it for a few
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "Kim takes it from there," Bailey said. "She gives them the
antibiotics, changes the wing wraps and gives them restricted
exercise. If you are the bird found in the backyard with a broken
wing and your choices are either getting thrown in the garbage or
having Kim fix your wing and give you a second chance at life, then
you will think Kim is providing a huge service."</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura County Humane Society often refers people with injured
raptors to Stroud.</TE>
<TE>   "People like Kim are invaluable because we don't have the
resources or skill to deal with wild animals like that," said Tim
Dewar, spokesman for the society.</TE>
<TE>   Being the local raptor expert has its drawbacks. Stroud, who is
helped by a handful of volunteers, is barraged with all sorts of
animal calls.</TE>
<TE>   "People ask me how to get raccoons from their yard," she said.
"One guy called and said seagulls kept attacking his car. A lady
called asking if she should adopt a dingo puppy."</TE>
<TE>   During windy spells, Stroud's phone is constantly ringing. Herons
and owls get blown from their nests and end up in people's yards.
Last year she took in 70 baby barn owls, 35 baby great-horned owls,
25 red-tailed hawk chicks and 17 red-shouldered hawk chicks.</TE>
<TE>   Stroud first got involved with birds as a volunteer at a wildlife
rehabilitation center in Simi Valley. Later, she helped start
Wildlife Care of Ventura County before founding the raptor center.</TE>
<TE>   Stroud was raised in Santa Barbara, where her stepfather would
take in birds hit by cars.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to be a vet for years, but I got married and had kids,"
said Stroud, who works at the Patagonia store in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   As Stroud made her rounds around the center recently, Chloe, a
slim, snail-eating Indian runner duck, joined her. Chloe, whose wing
was chewed off by a dog, waddled behind Stroud like a web-footed
personal assistant.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike the chummy duck, the raptors are aloof. Those who have
been here a while, like Sasquatch and Luna, tolerate Stroud. Others,
like a glaring bald eagle, are skittish.</TE>
<TE>   The birds are fed once a day. The bald eagle gets trout or salmon,
and the others receive rats, quails and day-old chicks called
cockerels.</TE>
<TE>   "I buy 5,000 cockerels at a time," Stroud said.</TE>
<TE>   Stroud depends on private donations to run her half-acre center
and hopes someone will donate 20 acres so the raptors will have more
space. She also wants to raise $6,000 for two aviaries at the county
humane society to house a bald eagle and golden eagle.</TE>
<TE>   She often does paid presentations at local schools.</TE>
<TE>   During a recent appearance at Thelma Bedell Elementary School in
Santa Paula, Stroud showed owls, falcons, herons and Chloe.</TE>
<TE>   The students were entranced by the owls and enchanted by the duck.
As she wrapped up, Stroud looked at the young faces and furrowed her
brow.</TE>
<TE>   "And remember if you want a pet, get a cockatiel or a parakeet,"
she said. "Not a wild animal."</TE>

<HD>Golf Firms' Woes Not Hurting Courses</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The financial troubles of golf course magnate David G. Price has
triggered some concern but no noticeable effect on the numerous
public and private courses his companies own and operate across
Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Privately owned American Golf Corp. and publicly traded National
Golf Properties Inc., which are both headed and controlled by Price,
own and operate more than 60 public and private courses across the
region.</LD>
<LD>   More than 40 of those are public courses, including the Arcadia
Golf Course and the Vista Valencia Golf Course, which are operated by
Santa Monica-based American Golf under long-term contracts with a
variety of government agencies.</LD>
<TE>   Faced with intense competition and an industrywide decline in
business, American Golf has been unable to meet its rent payments on
courses leased from National Golf. Because of that inability, both
companies have proposed a controversial merger opposed by some of
National Golf's stockholders.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly has golf organizations alarmed because they manage
so many golf courses," said Craig Kessler, executive director of the
Public Links Golf Assn. of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Many government agencies have come to rely on American Golf not
only to operate their courses, but to generate revenue for the public
coffers. The city of Long Beach, for example, receives nearly $4
million a year from the six courses operated by American Golf.</TE>
<TE>   In Pasadena, the city's Brookside Golf Course went from a drain on
the municipal treasury to generating about $1.8 million in annual
revenue after American Golf became the operator, said Porfirio
Frausto, who heads the operating company responsible for the course.</TE>
<TE>   "They do an extremely good job," Frausto said.</TE>
<TE>   American Golf officials have been calling on local officials to
discuss their financial condition and deal with any concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "They came down with some of their administrative staff and talked
to us and reassured us that they were going to live up to their
agreements and contracts, and they have done so," said Phil Hester,
director of parks, recreation and marine services for Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Hester and other government officials say American Golf has not
suggested that it would seek to renegotiate the contracts or seek
some form of financial relief related to the public courses it
operates.</TE>
<TE>   "It would take a lot of cities by surprise if they came back for
that kind of relief, and I don't know what kind of support they could
get for it," said Steve Duron, administrator of golf operations for
Los Angeles County, which contracts with American Golf to operate
eight of the county's 19 courses.</TE>
<TE>   "They've kept us advised of their financial woes ... but they have
never come to us to seek rent relief or change the structure of the
lease," Duron said.</TE>

second-largest airline, prepares to cancel a $3-billion order.</LD>
<LD>   EVA is "finalizing a plan to cancel the Boeing 777 orders" and
focus on regional routes, Chairman Yu Chong-ho said. "EVA's more
profitable routes are Hong Kong and Japan, so we wouldn't really have
good use for Boeing 777s."</LD>
<LD>   Boeing still is talking with EVA about the order, and the carrier
may actually increase the size of the purchase, said a spokeswoman
for the U.S. plane maker.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Boeing, based in Chicago, rose $1.29 to $49.13 on the
NYSE.</TE>

billion was sold in six-month bills at 1.89%, up from 1.85%.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. airlines plan to create a company to insure themselves against
terrorism and acts of war at premiums about half the rate private
insurers have been charging since the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   AMR Corp.'s American Airlines Inc., UAL Corp.'s United Airlines
and other members of the Air Transport Assn., a trade group, are
forming the company.</LD>
<LD>   The new insurer, Equitime, will offer airlines liability coverage
of as much as $1.5 billion an occurrence. Coverage will cost about 50
cents to 70 cents per passenger, compared with the $1.33 they now
pay. Insurance available in the private market requires airlines to
pay premiums equal to the potential loss they could absorb.</LD>
<TE>   "Pre 9/11, U.S. airlines were paying a combined $15 million to $20
million for war risk coverage, and today we're paying a combined $930
million," said Chris Duncan, risk manager at Delta Air Lines Inc. and
chairman of the ATA's insurance group. "That's not insurance."</TE>

<LD>Honeywell International Inc. said it would give new Chief Executive
David Cote $8.3 million in salary and bonus and to compensate him for
pay he lost after resigning as CEO of TRW Inc. last month.</LD>
<LD>   Cote will receive a base salary of $1.5 million and a guaranteed
bonus of $1.88 million for 2002, Honeywell said in a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing.</LD>
<LD>   Honeywell's contract with Cote comes on the heels of TRW's
decision not to grant him a bonus for 2001 and to terminate his stock
options because of the potential effect his resignation will have on
the No. 2 maker of air bags.</LD>
<TE>   Morris Township, N.J.-based Honeywell also will pay Cote $2.7
million by the end of this month to replace the performance bonus
Cote gave up at TRW. He will receive an additional $2.25 million for
2003 to offset lost compensation.</TE>

<LD>Waste Management Inc. said it will eliminate 2,000 jobs, including

million, or 5 cents a share, for the first quarter but doesn't plan
to change its outlook for all of 2002.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The four biggest accounting firms will lobby the government without
Andersen, which is trying to settle lawsuits related to the collapse
of client Enron Corp.</LD>
<LD>   An industry coalition, including PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte
&amp; Touche, KPMG and Ernst &amp; Young, decided last week to break with
Chicago-based Andersen, said Geoffrey Pickard, vice president of
communications at the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants.</LD>
<LD>   "Andersen is in a different position than the rest of the firms,"
Pickard said. "They are focused on litigation settlement. We will
pursue long-term policy changes that affect the function of financial
markets."</LD>
<TE>   An Andersen spokesman wasn't available to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Andersen settled a lawsuit brought by Department 56
Inc., a maker of collectibles that accused the accounting firm of
botching a project to overhaul its computer systems.</TE>
<TE>   Department 56 received $11million in the settlement, according to
a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with Andersen and the Eden Prairie, Minn., company could
not be reached for comment.</TE>

<LD>Organizers of a protest against Los Angeles Police Commission
President Rick Caruso said Monday that they are reconsidering their
plans.</LD>
<LD>   The Rev. Frederick Murph of Brookins Community AME Church had
organized the March 9 protest with Rep. Maxine Waters in support of a
second term for Police Chief Bernard C. Parks. Parks is seeking the
commission's approval for another term.</LD>
<LD>   Murph said talks with Caruso have been "productive."</LD>
<TE>   "If they continue to be," he said, "we don't see a need to have a
rally."</TE>

<LD>A cost-effective alternative to the "Star Wars" system? The police
log of the Dana Point News reported: "Three kids near Sea Canyon Park
were using some sort of tube device to launch oranges."</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   At least no one has called him a lemon: I've told you how L.A.'s
current mayor was identified as "Mike Haan" in a graphic on one
network TV newscast and as "James K. Hahn, Major" on an L.A. city
Public Works Department sign. Now David Stone of Encino passes along
a photo caption from the Buenos Aires Herald that disputes Hahn's
claim to the office--I mean mayor, not major (see accompanying).</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of the election: Unbelievable as it sounds, I can't
remember hearing any commercials pro or con for one proposition in
the sample ballot (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kooky calendar: You didn't want February to end so soon (so maybe
you could hear more TV and radio election spots)? Well, William Lee
and Michael Dulson found a wine-tasting event for you (see
accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I guess they'll bottle anything these days: Harry Hornett of San
Juan Capistrano found what must be a post-L.A.-Marathon sale (see
photo).</TE>
<TE>   The show that's never aired on the Food Channel: I recounted the
"Alfred Hitchcock" TV episode in which a murderous wife conks her
ever-loving hubby on the head with a frozen leg of lamb, then cooks
the meat.</TE>
<TE>   But readers Lois McKinney and Barbara Rowland took me to task for
leaving out the last plot twist. "She invites the detective to
dinner," McKinney said, "and as he's putting a forkful of lamb into
his mouth, he says he really wishes he could find the murder weapon."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How about some alphabet soup on the side? Mention was made here of
the billboard from the state Avocado Commission (my favorite
commission) that says: "Your BLT Could Use a Vowel."</TE>
<TE>   Several readers told me they have found BLATs on menus, including
Robert Riedel of Torrance.</TE>
<TE>   And Mike Owen of Manhattan Beach swears that he ate--he can't
remember where--a bacon, lettuce, tomato, avocado and Swiss cheese
sandwich: a BLAST.</TE>
<TE>   Better than a leg-of-lamb sock to the head, I guess.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Semi-memorable West Valley movie lines: I alleged the other day
that Reseda is no doubt jealous of the many references to neighbor
Tarzana in the movies--most recently in "Queen of the Damned," where
a groupie tells a vampire rock star, "I came all the way from
Tarzana."</TE>
<TE>   But Reseda has had its moments too. Sort of.</TE>
<TE>   In "A Kid in King Arthur's Court," a Little League player who
time-travels back to visit the Knights of the Round Table explains he
is from Reseda, "the bowling capital of the world."</TE>
<TE>   And in the film "The Adventures of Ford Fairlane," detective
Fairlane (Andrew Dice Clay) describes a famous heavy metal band in
his typical sensitive fashion:</TE>
<TE>   "I thought they were just some lucky [censored] from Reseda."</TE>

<HD>Schools to Receive Cardiac Devices</HD>
<DH>Health: In response to recent deaths on its campuses, L.A.
Unified will be one of the first districts to provide heart
defibrillators.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After nearly two dozen cardiac deaths on its campuses last year, Los
Angeles Unified School District this week will begin distributing 60
heart defibrillators to middle and high schools, officials said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The district will train nearly 1,000 staffers to use the devices
by summer, said Pete Anderson, director of the district's office of
emergency services.</LD>
<LD>   The defibrillators were purchased after heavy lobbying by the
American Heart Assn., which counted last year's deaths using news
clippings and other reports. The association did not say whether
those deaths were students or staff members.</LD>
<TE>   The school district does not keep records of deaths related to
cardiac arrests and could not confirm the number, district
spokeswoman Cricket Bauer said.</TE>
<TE>   According to the heart association, LAUSD is one of the first
districts to buy defibrillators. Some school officials in other
metropolitan areas said they do not need them because their schools
are generally concentrated in smaller areas and closer to paramedics.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what LAUSD is doing is right on time," said Kathy
McInerney, an official with CARE Foundation, which educates the
public about cardiac death. "The defibrillators can and will save
lives."</TE>
<TE>   The defibrillators, which cost about $2,800 each, were purchased
about six months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Every high school in the district will receive one, and several
adult schools and the largest middle schools will get the rest,
Anderson said. Eventually, every middle school will have one,
although no timetable for the distribution has been set, he said.</TE>
<TE>   School nurses have been trained to use the defibrillators. Over
the next few months, they will instruct athletic directors and
coaches, administrators and various other school staffers, Anderson
said.</TE>

<LD>A 19-month-old girl died Monday at Valley Presbyterian Hospital in
Van Nuys, a day after being pulled from a fish pond in the backyard
of a North Hills day-care center.</LD>
<LD>   A day-care worker at Martinez Family Child Care Home had gone
inside to use the bathroom Sunday afternoon and returned to find
Silaedy Richardson in the foot-deep pond, said Brian Humphrey, a Los
Angeles Fire Department spokesman.</LD>
<LD>   Silaedy reportedly was fascinated by the fish in the pond.</LD>
<TE>   A neighbor, who is a nurse, began cardiopulmonary resuscitation
before paramedics arrived at the day-care center in the 8700 block of
Maya Place.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles police and the state Department of Social Services,
which regulates day-care and residential homes, are investigating how
the toddler got past the wrought-iron fence that surrounds the pond,
and whether the gate had been open.</TE>
<TE>   "The fence was at least 4 feet tall," homicide Det. Mike Oppelt
said.</TE>
<TE>   Social Services requires ponds or pools to be surrounded by fences
that don't obstruct the view of the water, spokesman John Gordon
said.</TE>

<HD>Young Champs Played Through the Pain</HD>
<DH>Sports: San Fernando honors football team that won title
after assistant coach's death.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saluted Monday for a best-in-the-West season, the San Fernando Braves
said winning the Pee Wee football championship required them to
conquer the pain in their hearts before confronting their opponents
on the field.</LD>
<LD>   The scrappy 13- and 14-year-olds, who were honored Monday night by
the San Fernando City Council, won the Western Division title the day
after assistant coach Larry Barrios died in a car crash.</LD>
<LD>   Barrios, 21, was on his way to Las Vegas for the Nov. 21 semifinal
game when the car overturned north of Baker. He was a passenger. The
wife of assistant coach David Felix also died.</LD>
<TE>   The team got the news in an early-morning phone call.</TE>
<TE>   The players said they were devastated, couldn't sleep and wanted
to forfeit the semifinal contest.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't really want to play," said quarterback Diego Urzua, 14.
"We thought it'd be disrespectful to Larry."</TE>
<TE>   Barrios "was the kind of guy we used to hang out with all day,
whether we were playing football or not," Diego said.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until shortly before the game that the Braves decided to
take the field.</TE>
<TE>   "We realized that Larry lived for football," Diego said. "We
played for him."</TE>
<TE>   They won that game and went on to capture the National Youth
Football Western Championship on Thanksgiving Day, defeating a team
from Aurora, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   "They played with a lot of heart," Coach Arthur Ceniceros said.</TE>
<TE>   Barrios, who worked as a technician for an entertainment company,
was the youngest of the Braves' eight coaches and played for the
team, which has been in existence for 30 years, when he was a kid,
Ceniceros said.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end, it came to be that we were all crying," said Freddy
Ceniceros, 13, the coach's nephew.</TE>
<TE>   When the boys returned home, they didn't attend victory parties.
Instead, they went to Barrios' funeral and placed their jerseys on
his coffin.</TE>

<HD>Chrysler to Build PT Cruiser Convertible</HD>
<DH>Autos: Whether the new version is classified as a truck or
a car will affect the auto maker's efforts to meet U.S. fuel rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL ELLIS</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>DaimlerChrysler said Monday that it would make a two-door convertible
version of its PT Cruiser in 2004, a development that could pose a
challenge to the auto maker's efforts to comply with American
fuel-efficiency standards, according to a U.S. official.</LD>
<LD>   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regards the
Chrysler brand's retro-looking vehicle as a truck, according to its
specifications, which includes an open cargo area created when the
rear seats are removed.</LD>
<LD>   Federal rules for corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE, require
light trucks--pickups, sport-utility vehicles and minivans--sold by
an auto maker in a given model year to get a minimum collective
average of 20.7 miles per gallon.</LD>
<TE>   And DaimlerChrysler counts on the PT Cruiser, which gets 21 to 26
mpg with an automatic transmission, to offset its gas-guzzling
pickups and SUVs in meeting the CAFE rules.</TE>
<TE>   A Chrysler spokeswoman said the convertible PT Cruiser would have
the same truck-defining features according to NHTSA's definition.
However, an agency spokesman was not so sure.</TE>
<TE>   "A convertible is a different vehicle than a light truck, it seems
to me," said NHTSA spokesman Tim Hurd. "It's not something we can
guess about."</TE>
<TE>   Hurd said Chrysler can label the PT Cruiser a truck but would have
to defend the status if it were challenged. For model year 2000,
Chrysler trucks barely exceeded the CAFE standards with an average of
21.3 mpg. NHTSA counts the Chrysler brands separately from
DaimlerChrysler's Mercedes-Benz.</TE>
<TE>   Since DaimlerChrysler first introduced the PT Cruiser, calling it
"too cool" to be categorized, the vehicle has challenged conventional
definitions. Many have put the upright four-door hatchback in the
growing category of "crossover" vehicles that blur the definition
between cars and trucks.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is especially confusing because the Environmental
Protection Agency, operating from a different set of guidelines,
classifies the PT Cruiser as a car, requiring the vehicle to meet
stricter emissions standards than trucks.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever you call it, sales of the once-red-hot vehicle have
cooled somewhat. In February, DaimlerChrysler added sales incentives
on the vehicle for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   The convertible, a two-door, four-seater model, will be built at
the company's vehicle assembly plant in Toluca, Mexico,
DaimlerChrysler said. Pricing has not been set.</TE>

<HD>Ford Agrees to Settle Aerostar Seat Belt Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co. agreed to pay an undisclosed amount to settle a
lawsuit by a Florida woman and her quadriplegic son who claimed the
child's injuries were caused by defective seat belts in an Aerostar
van.</LD>
<LD>   The case was the first to go to trial involving a claim that Ford
knowingly made a restraint system inadequate for children too large
for car seats and too small for standard seatbelts.</LD>
<LD>   Palmella Rainford sued Ford after a driver hit her 1992 Aerostar
van in 1996 after running a stop sign. Her son, Jamaal Walker, then
6, was rendered a quadriplegic when his spine strained due to a loose
seatbelt, her lawyers told a Palm Beach County District Court jury in
West Palm Beach, Fla.</LD>
<TE>   "The family of Jamaal Walker is very pleased with the settlement
reached with Ford Motor Co.," said Tab Turner, a Little Rock, Ark.,
lawyer who represented the family.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides declined to give details on the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Ford and other auto makers now offer special seats for children
between ages 4 and 8.</TE>
<TE>   Jury selection began in the case on Jan. 9.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a tragic accident caused by another driver," said Ford
spokeswoman Kathleen Vokes. "No currently designed restraint system
could have prevented the neck injury."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford rose 53 cents to $16.17 on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Jump in Gas Prices Biggest in 6 Months</HD>
<DH>Energy: Cost at pump rises 2.8 cents a gallon to $1.144,
with fuel in the West Coast most expensive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gasoline prices registered their biggest weekly rise since September,
rising 2.8 cents a gallon over the last week to a national average of
$1.144, the Energy Department reported Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Gasoline prices were highest on the West Coast, where the average
price of a gallon of regular gasoline rose 2.1cents to $1.276. Prices
were lowest in the Southeast, from Virginia to Florida, where regular
gasoline rose 0.9 cent to an average $1.055 a gallon.</LD>
<LD>   The pump price of regular gasoline is still down 27 cents from a
year ago, according to the department's weekly survey of more than
800 service stations. Prices are down from last year because of more
supplies.</LD>
<TE>   However, gas prices have been rising as the U.S. looks toward its
busy summer driving season, and the latest spike in gasoline prices
is the biggest weekly increase since the week ended Sept. 3. In
addition, oil prices have jumped 25% since mid-January. Crude futures
closed Monday at $22.45 a barrel, up 5 cents, in New York trading.</TE>
<TE>   The national average price for cleaner-burning reformulated
gasoline, sold at  one-third of the stations in cities and smoggier
areas, was up 2.2 cents to $1.196 a gallon.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco was the top spot among major cities in fuel costs,
with gasoline prices up 3.7 cents to $1.343 a gallon. Houston was
again the best deal at the pump, but the price was still up, rising
0.2 cent to $1.041.</TE>
<TE>   The report also showed gasoline prices were up 2.3 cents in Los
Angeles at $1.303, up 0.3 cent in New York at $1.165, down 0.4 cent
in Denver at $1.135 and up 6.7 cents in Chicago at $1.201.</TE>
<TE>   The average price nationwide for diesel fuel increased 1.9 cents
to $1.173 a gallon, down 25 cents from a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Truckers in New England paid the most for diesel fuel at $1.289 a
gallon, up 0.3 cent. The Gulf Coast states had the cheapest diesel at
$1.144 a gallon, up 1.8 cents.</TE>

<HD>General Growth Properties Agrees to Purchase JP Realty</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Growth Properties Inc., the second-largest U.S. shopping mall
owner, on Monday agreed to buy JP Realty Inc. for about $1.1 billion
in cash, stock and assumed debt, adding 18 regional malls in the
West.</LD>
<LD>   JP Realty investors and limited partners will receive $26.10 in
cash for each share, 6.8% above the closing price Friday. General
Growth will pay $524 million in cash and assume $460 million in debt
and $116 million of preferred shares, Chief Executive John Bucksbaum
said.</LD>
<LD>   The purchase comes two months after Chicago-based General Growth
lost out in the bidding for mall owner Rodamco North America, which
was sold for $5.3 billion. Analysts expected the company to look for
other purchases. General Growth raised $345 million from the sale of
stock in December in anticipation that it would be the winning bidder
for Rodamco.</LD>
<TE>   JP Realty, whose chairman and founder John Price recently was
appointed as ambassador to the Republic of Mauritius, has a stake in
50 malls, strip shopping centers and warehouses with 15 million
square feet of space.</TE>
<TE>   Salt Lake City-based JP Realty's properties are in Utah, Idaho,
Arizona, Nevada, Washington, California, Wyoming, New Mexico,
Colorado and Oregon. JP Realty's largest property is the
1.17-million-square-foot Boise Towne Square mall in Boise, Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   In California, JP Realty's operations include the Visalia Mall in
Visalia and Anaheim Crossing, a community shopping center in Orange
County.</TE>
<TE>   General Growth is controlled by the Bucksbaum family, which
started building malls in the 1950s and owns 141 shopping malls in 39
states.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of General Growth rose $1.02 to $43.22 on the New York
Stock Exchange on Monday. JP Realty rose $2.10, or 8.6%, to $26.53,
also on the NYSE, a sign some investors expect a competing offer for
the business may emerge.</TE>
<TE>   General Growth said it expects to generate a return of 10% during
the first 12 months after the purchase is completed, scheduled in the
second quarter.</TE>

<HD>Office Owners Expect Weak Demand</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Owners of office properties this year are bracing for more vacancies
and for lower rents as companies try to curb real estate costs.</LD>
<LD>   Though other sectors of the economy seem to be perking up, office
property owners last week gave a downbeat forecast at a real estate
conference sponsored by Lehman Bros.</LD>
<LD>   "So far the signs are not there that we're having a recovery in
real estate," Boston Properties Inc. Chief Executive Edward Linde
said.</LD>
<TE>   Surveys of office markets have shown that demand is weakening,
with more space opening up all over the United States.</TE>
<TE>   A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers found 200,000 fewer office
occupants at the end of 2001 than a year earlier. The study predicted
continued weakness through 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Real estate boomed in 2000, when the roaring economy bolstered
demand for office space and Internet and high-tech companies pushed
rents to phenomenal levels. But the 2001 recession and the Sept. 11
attacks caused vacancies to rise and rents to fall as many companies
found they did not need the space.</TE>
<TE>   "Office markets are going back to the 1999 level," said Sam Zell,
chairman of Equity Office Properties Trust at the New York
conference. "We went through the spike and came back down."</TE>
<TE>   Equity Office is the largest owner of office properties in the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of real estate investment trusts, the companies that own
and manage large portfolios of real estate, jumped in 2000. The
Morgan Stanley REIT index surged 27% that year as demand for all
types of property, including office space, heated up to a frenzied
pace.</TE>
<TE>   Such a rise is unusual for REIT stocks, which generally attract
investors seeking a steady stream of dividend income. Law requires
these companies to pay 90% of their taxable income to shareholders.</TE>

<HD>Buffett Urges Auditor Oversight</HD>
<DH>Forum: Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway says aggressive audit
panel within corporate board is most effective.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The way to help avoid future Enrons is for corporate directors to
hold their auditors' feet to the fire and for stockholders to
discipline executives who withhold information, investor Warren E.
Buffett said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Buffett, billionaire chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., headed a
list of financial experts at two roundtable discussions hosted by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt, who attended the sessions at New York's
Inter-Continental Hotel, said he would use the panel's comments to
help him develop proposals to improve corporate financial disclosure
and auditor independence.</LD>
<TE>   Poor or misleading disclosure and conflicts of interest in auditor
Andersen's relationship with Enron Corp. have been cited as factors
in the energy-trading firm's collapse into bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   After the forum, Pitt said he plans to create a private oversight
body to discipline accountants and review company audits within six
months.</TE>
<TE>   Buffett, however, said such panels rarely are as effective as
having an aggressive audit committee within a corporation's board of
directors.</TE>
<TE>   The audit committee, normally composed of independent directors,
doesn't necessarily need to be stacked with accounting experts, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But if they ask tough questions and put the answers on the record
in the corporate minutes, it should make the auditors think twice
about acquiescing in questionable accounting practices, Buffett said.</TE>
<TE>   James Copeland, chief executive of Big Five accounting firm
Deloitte &amp; Touche, warned that hasty reforms could imperil "70 years
of steady improvement" in U.S. accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   He recommended creating an independent governmental or
quasi-governmental body that would investigate financial disasters
such as Enron the same way that the National Transportation Safety
Board investigates airline crashes.</TE>
<TE>   Giving such authority to a single entity would eliminate the
duplication and turf battles that now hamper such financial probes,
Copeland said.</TE>
<TE>   Melvyn Weiss, a partner at Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Hynes &amp;
Lerach, perhaps the best-known plaintiffs' representative in
shareholder lawsuits against corporations, said the SEC should take a
much stronger role in policing accounting and financial disclosure.</TE>
<TE>   The Security and Exchange Commission's budget should be increased
to conduct surprise "spot audits" of big corporations, the same way
that the Internal Revenue Service conducts unannounced tax audits,
Weiss said. Weiss acknowledged that the idea may be politically
unpopular, noting that President Bush is opposed to dramatically
increasing the SEC's budget.</TE>
<TE>   The Security and Exchange Commission will hold a similar panel
discussion in Washington on Wednesday, followed by a series of such
gatherings around the country, Pitt said.</TE>

<HD>New Systems Urged to Step Up Seat Belt Use</HD>
<DH>Autos: The nation's top traffic safety official is asking
manufacturers to install new technologies to remind people to buckle
up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The country's top traffic safety official is urging auto makers to
install new technologies that encourage motorists to wear seat belts.</LD>
<LD>   All vehicles sold in the United States must have a buzzer and
dashboard light that reminds drivers to buckle up.</LD>
<LD>   Jeffrey Runge, administrator of the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, said Monday that auto makers should go
further.</LD>
<TE>   Runge cited Ford Motor Co.'s new BeltMinder system. Drivers who
aren't buckled up in a vehicle with BeltMinder are subjected to five
minutes of intermittent beeping and a flashing light on the
instrument panel. The system is standard on all of Ford's 2002 model
year vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   A study by the insurance industry found that 76% of drivers in
vehicles with BeltMinder buckled up, compared with 71% in vehicles
without the system.</TE>
<TE>   Runge said a 5% increase in belt use among all vehicles on U.S.
roads would prevent more than 1,000 deaths and 20,000 injuries each
year.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope your company will carefully examine the Ford BeltMinder
system and any other technological ideas you have to increase seat
belt use, and ask that you consider installing these systems in your
vehicles voluntarily as quickly as possible," he wrote in a letter to
the heads of the major auto makers.</TE>
<TE>   He asked each manufacturer to respond within two months and
suggested the systems should address back-seat passengers as well as
those riding in the front.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers said auto
makers already are working on technologies and techniques to increase
seat belt usage.</TE>
<TE>   Seat belt use in the United States has risen in recent years to
73%, but that's still far behind the 90% to 95% found in Canada and
some European nations.</TE>
<TE>   Runge told a Senate panel last week that the government is
abandoning a Clinton-era plan to reach 90% by 2005 because it's
unrealistic. He set a goal of 78% for 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Congress recently instructed NHTSA to work with the National
Academy of Sciences on a study of technologies that could increase
belt usage. Runge said that study will be completed in spring 2003.</TE>

<HD>Airline Stocks Starting to Take Off</HD>
<DH>Securities: Prices are returning to pre-Sept. 11 levels on
reports of fewer empty seats, predictions of rising revenue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's taken nearly half a year, but the stock prices of the nation's
largest airlines are finally returning to their pre-Sept. 11
altitude.</LD>
<LD>   Buoyed by reports of fewer empty seats and predictions from some
carriers that revenues are improving, shares of Northwest Airlines
Corp. (ticker symbol: NWAC) and American Airlines parent AMR
Corp.(AMR) inched toward their Sept. 10 closing prices Monday, and
Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) surpassed the mark.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones transportation average, which tracks the broader
sector, soared more than 5%.</LD>
<TE>   Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV), the only major carrier to report a
fourth-quarter profit in 2001, transcended its pre-Sept. 11 levels in
November.</TE>
<TE>   The firm said Monday, though, that it couldn't be sure of a
first-quarter profit in 2002, blaming two consecutive months of
declining passenger traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Major carriers are still in a funk based on year-to-year
comparisons, but the majority have made month-to-month progress in
luring back travelers--and Wall Street is latching on to any positive
news it can find in this troubled sector.</TE>
<TE>   Salomon Smith Barney analyst Brian Harris called the industry's
performance in February "encouraging"; Merrill Lynch analyst Michael
Linenberg said he was "pleased by the improvement."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Wall Street's optimism about the gradual industry
turnaround, most carriers continue to lose money.</TE>
<TE>   One carrier that has predicted a first-quarter profit is
Houston-based Continental Airlines Inc. (CAL). Continental's
passenger traffic declined 6.7% in February compared with a year ago,
but that was less than January's year-over-year decline.</TE>
<TE>   It also marked an increase in traffic compared with October, the
first full month of travel after the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The positive reception of Continental's February data pushed the
stock up $2.10 on Monday to $34.80. Although Continental's shares
remain lower than their Sept. 10 close of $39.64, the carrier's
positive news sent shares of other airlines substantially higher.</TE>
<TE>   Delta, the third-largest airline, rose $2.42 to $38.59, above its
Sept. 10 closing price of $37.25.</TE>
<TE>   AMR climbed $1.80 to $29.05, and Northwest rose $2.04 to
$19.08--both near their Sept. 10 closing prices.</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press</TE>
<TE>   Lawsuits Oppose Sabre's Bid for Travelocity</TE>
<TE>   Travelocity.com Inc. said Monday that 11 shareholder lawsuits were
seeking to block Sabre Inc.'s bid to buy the online travel company.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuits claim the Sabre offer of $23 a share is too low,
Travelocity said.</TE>
<TE>   Sabre (TSG) owns 70% of Travelocity (TVLY). It said Feb. 19 that
it would launch a tender offer for the other 30% today or soon after.</TE>
<TE>   Nine of the lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery,
and two were filed in state district court in Fort Worth, where
Travelocity is based.</TE>
<TE>   Travelocity said it had formed a special committee of outside
directors to evaluate Sabre's bid.</TE>
<TE>   Travelocity shares rose 73 cents to $26.60, and Sabre shares
jumped $2.74 to $48.04.</TE>

<HD>Two Former Officers Sentenced to Prison in Corruption Cases</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two former law enforcement officers were sentenced to 30 months each
in federal prison Monday, one for tipping off a narcotics suspect and
the other for taking part in a smuggling plot and accepting bribes.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Casas, a veteran U.S. Customs Service agent, had pleaded
guilty earlier to conspiracy to smuggle 10,000 counterfeit Microsoft
computer programs from Hong Kong to the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Casas, 46, of El Monte also admitted taking $14,000 in bribes in
connection with his official duties.</LD>
<TE>   Appearing before U.S. District Court Judge Lourdes G. Baird in Los
Angeles, he apologized to his family and the court.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of a plea agreement, U.S. prosecutors had promised to
recommend a lighter sentence in return for Casas' substantial
assistance in an ongoing investigation.</TE>
<TE>   But Assistant U.S. Atty. Edward B. Moreton Jr. told Baird that
Casas reneged on the agreement by giving false or misleading answers
when questioned by investigators about other suspects in the case.
Moreton said that would have compromised Casas' usefulness as a
witness in court.</TE>
<TE>   However, defense attorney Stephen Sadowsky asked for leniency
because Casas has an autistic child at home who needs the care of
both parents. Baird declined.</TE>
<TE>   Casas faced a 24- to 30-month prison term under federal sentencing
guidelines. Moreton recommended 27 months, but Baird gave Casas the
maximum, saying that corrupt law enforcement "is very tough to
swallow."</TE>
<TE>   Four other defendants were convicted in the smuggling case. Casas'
brother, Edward, 40, of Sylmar was sentenced to two years probation.
Lawrence Boyle, 54, an attorney from Westminster, received three
years probation. Peter Yi, 36, of Chino Hills and his brother, Sung
K. Yi, 32, of Cypress are scheduled to be sentenced April 8.</TE>
<TE>   In the bribery case, Casas admitted taking about $11,000 from an
importer of magnets in exchange for confidential information that the
importer could use to drive a competitor out of business. Casas also
accepted $3,000 from a former police officer who allegedly used a
shill to collect informant fees from the Customs Service.</TE>
<TE>   Casas, who remains free on bail, will begin serving his sentence
May7.</TE>
<TE>   In an unrelated case Monday, Douglas John Bos, a onetime Ontario
police officer assigned to a federal anti-drug task force, fought
back tears as he apologized for his criminal conduct before U.S.
District Judge George H. King.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just very sorry," Bos told the judge. "It'll never happen
again. I hope I will be able to come back to this court someday and
show you I've turned it around."</TE>
<TE>   Bos, 34, of Canyon Lake pleaded guilty last year to obstructing a
major narcotics investigation by warning a criminal target that he
was about to meet with a government informant. Bos asked for an
unspecified amount of money.</TE>
<TE>   The suspect, Nidal Hamayel, 45, met with the informant anyway,
telling him that his cover had been blown by a drug agent assigned to
the case. The conversation was taped and heard by other agents.</TE>
<TE>   When confronted, Bos admitted telephoning Hamayel three times
previously. Hamayel was subsequently arrested in a nationwide
crackdown on illegal importers of pseudoephedrine, a chemical used to
make methamphetamine.</TE>
<TE>   In court Monday, defense lawyer Edward Robinson said Bos was going
through an emotional crisis when he committed his crime.</TE>
<TE>   But Assistant U.S. Atty. Rebecca Lonergan said that a month after
pleading guilty in the federal case, Bos was arrested in Claremont on
a charge of illegally possessing a loaded firearm. He pleaded guilty
to a misdemeanor and received probation.</TE>
<TE>   Bos, who is free on bond, was ordered to turn himself in by
April19.</TE>

<HD>Strip Club Opens Amid Protests</HD>
<DH>Pico Rivera: Imperial Showgirls allowed to proceed after
obtaining permits. City takes action against future adult businesses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANUEL GAMIZ JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pico Rivera residents and owners of the city's first strip club
squared off again Monday when the club was allowed to open after
acquiring all of its permits and licenses.</LD>
<LD>   Leaning against the bar of the Imperial Showgirls as customers
began to wander inside, owner Glenn Smith, 48, said he was "just glad
to be open."</LD>
<LD>   Outside, a group of about 300 angry residents and city officials
booed every person who walked into the club in the 9300 block of
Slauson Avenue.</LD>
<TE>   An hour after dancers took the stage, city officials started
planning for the future. At a meeting Monday, the City Council voted
unanimously to impose a moratorium on future adult businesses and
corrected a zoning loophole that allowed Imperial Showgirls to
operate in a shopping area.</TE>
<TE>   The moratorium on new adult businesses will remain in effect for
at least a year, pending a zoning study by the planning and building
department, which would then recommend permanent regulations.</TE>
<TE>   "We had our hands tied on this one," said Bob Spencer, the city's
spokesman. "It is their constitutional right to be here. We just want
to make sure that it is run in a safe manner."</TE>
<TE>   After receiving its certificate of maximum occupancy Monday, the
club was allowed to keep its doors open, ending a two-month legal
battle with the city.</TE>
<TE>   The Imperial Showgirls strip club had opened quietly in January.
Its location still bears the marquee of a previous business, a
billiard parlor.</TE>
<TE>   Residents learned about the nude-dancing club when police shut it
down a few days after its Jan. 7 opening because it was operating
without permits and within a city zone that did not allow
adult-oriented businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The club's closure was temporary. In a Feb. 19 ruling, U.S.
District Judge Dickran Tevrizian said the club could open because it
was unconstitutional to not allow a business to operate.</TE>
<TE>   He also voided the city's zoning ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   Tevrizian also ruled that the club owners had 10 days to get
licenses and permits.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the club opened briefly, but owners Glenn and LeRoy
Smith agreed to close until Monday because they were missing a
permit.</TE>
<TE>   The Smiths have been in the adult entertainment industry for about
20 years, own an Imperial Showgirls strip club in Anaheim and are
involved with other adult establishments. They bought the
5,000-square-foot Pico Rivera property late last year.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's planned opening was also accompanied by an "unwelcoming
committee" of about 300 residents, religious leaders and city
officials, including Rep. Grace Napolitano (D-Norwalk), who protested
along Slauson Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   "Pico Rivera is a safe city, and it is a good city," said the Rev.
Richard Ochoa, whose church is just a few blocks away from the strip
club. "This is going to increase crime in our city."</TE>
<TE>   The Smiths are eager to start doing business in the area and say
they are not looking to hurt the religiously conservative,
working-class suburb.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an adult-oriented business, and it is aimed toward
adults," said Glenn Smith.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be mature about it."</TE>
<TE>   Still, locals are worried.</TE>
<TE>   "It's scary," said Elaine Duarte, a 32-year-old bartender who
works less than a block away. "I won't feel safe working here late at
night."</TE>

<HD>When to Use English Hard to Decide</HD>
<DH>Government: Laws mandate translation, but give little
guidance about when, and some agencies are unaware the service is
required at all.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRETT THEROLF and LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forget the challenges of drafting a city budget or decoding zoning
regulations. In Southern California, even picking the language to use
at a public meeting can be a sticking point for local government
officials.</LD>
<LD>   Consider the choice facing Pico Rivera Mayor E.A. "Pete" Ramirez
at a community meeting concerning train noise. Looking out at an
almost entirely Latino audience, he started out in Spanish.</LD>
<LD>   But a few minutes into his presentation, he noticed a reporter and
asked if she understood. She didn't.</LD>
<TE>   Ramirez had a dilemma: Should he speak Spanish, which clearly
served the majority of the 100-person crowd in the elementary school
auditorium? Or should he choose English, which could potentially
reach thousands of constituents through the reporter?</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez chose English. And in a speech lasting about 45 minutes,
he couldn't translate back into Spanish for risk of boring his
audience.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the meeting a sheriff's deputy asked how many
Spanish speakers hadn't understood. About a fifth of the audience
members raised their hands.</TE>
<TE>   It's a conundrum difficult to navigate. State and federal law
gives cities a mandate to provide "appropriate" translation when they
have "substantial" numbers of non-English speakers. But what do
"appropriate" and "substantial" mean?</TE>
<TE>   The law doesn't provide much guidance, say government experts. Nor
does the law have very sharp teeth.</TE>
<TE>   "The way the law was written was without specific consequences,"
said Sandra Michioku, spokeswoman for the state attorney general.</TE>
<TE>   The Dymally-Alatorre Bilingual Services Act was enacted in 1973 to
bring translation to state and local government services. Local
government can fulfill its mandate in various ways, from printing
bilingual forms to providing bilingual staffers to translate what is
said at public meetings.</TE>
<TE>   "The laws have been on the books for a long time, but they are not
truly implemented until cities decide what, if anything, they are
going to do," said Luz Buitrago, director of the Law Center for
Families, an Oakland organization that helped bring an ordinance to
the city requiring the hiring of bilingual workers.</TE>
<TE>   A state survey assessing the law's effectiveness was released in
April. Researchers found that only two out of every 10 state
agencies, which the law targets more directly than city governments,
were aware of the act.</TE>
<TE>   For cities, even smaller ones, producing documents in other
languages can be relatively simple. But public meetings are trickier.
Some cities rely on volunteers--be they staffers, council members or
even audience members--who offer to translate.</TE>
<TE>   South Gate is a standout that has provided translation at City
Council meetings for years. The job pays $100 to $175 an hour, and
applicants must pass an oral and written test to be considered.</TE>
<TE>   When the current translator, Gloria Uriarte, started a year ago,
about five Spanish speakers attended each meeting. Now she regularly
sees about 30 and sometimes more.</TE>
<TE>   Uriarte tries to make the sometimes archaic language of city
government accessible.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't use sophisticated words" in the translation, she said.
"I try to figure out very basic words."</TE>
<TE>   At times Uriarte goes beyond a literal translation, offering
commentary on the city's famously raucous politics. "I sometimes ask,
'Could you believe this is being commented?' or 'Can't we all just
get along?' " she said.</TE>
<TE>   Balbina Sanchez, one of Uriarte's listeners, was recently at a
meeting in which one of the councilwomen was mocked by political foes
who meowed when she spoke.</TE>
<TE>   Uriarte interrupted her translation to explain that the foes think
the councilwoman has a cat-like voice. Sanchez said she likes the
perspective Uriarte brings to the sessions.</TE>
<TE>   South Gate officials said they have received praise from residents
for providing translations at public meetings, but the idea has
opponents nationally.</TE>
<TE>   Mauro E. Mujica, an immigrant from Chile, is chairman of an
advocacy group called U.S. English. When he looks at a city like
South Gate, he asks, "What about all the other languages? Many
immigrants speak many different languages. Are you going to translate
for all of them, too?"</TE>
<TE>   Mujica said it "gets too complicated" when politicians
institutionalize translation rather than keeping it informal and only
for important city matters.</TE>
<TE>   Some cities, such as Monterey Park, do not provide translations at
meetings.</TE>
<TE>   In a city where bilingual services are still in their infancy,
some important forms and documents are beginning to be translated,
but city officials said they don't have the resources to move on to
translating at meetings.</TE>
<TE>   The documents are being translated by a group of volunteers from
the city's large Mandarin- and Cantonese-speaking community for
distribution at City Hall. Some officials want to do even more to
serve the city's non-English-speaking population. Councilman David
Lau, who speaks Cantonese and Mandarin, said the city's language
services are inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, we're only serving people who speak English," he said.
"We'd like to run City Hall like a business. We're here to serve the
clients. If half of the clients speak Chinese, we'd like to
accommodate them [and] make City Hall more friendly."</TE>
<TE>   But for now, translating at public meetings will remain ad hoc.</TE>
<TE>   Hillary Wu, an acupuncture assistant who emigrated from Beijing
three years ago, takes English classes at a community college but
said she still cannot understand the specialized language of zoning
variances and tax increment financing.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't go because I don't understand," she said. "If I go, it's
as if I didn't even go."</TE>

<HD>Intel Enters Market for Fiber-Optic Chips</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Intel Corp. has started designing and building customized chips for
fiber-optic networks, taking the world's biggest maker of computer
processors into a market controlled by JDS Uniphase Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., has devised chips that
filter and direct light signals that beam information through
networks, creating a new business called planar photonics. The idea
is to replace some bulky, labor-intensive parts with cheaper, smaller
semiconductors.</LD>
<LD>   Intel, which has been trying to increase sales of chips for
communications gear, conducts internal research in lasers and light
for its processor unit and made a series of purchases starting in
1999 to bolster its optical expertise. Now the chip maker is adding
photonics to broaden its lineup.</LD>

<HD>Microsoft Chief Decries States' Proposal</HD>
<DH>Courts: Steve Ballmer testifies in deposition that planned
sanctions would force the firm to pull Windows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive Steve Ballmer testified that many of
the remedies for the company's conduct proposed by nine states would
force it to take the ubiquitous Windows operating system off the
market.</LD>
<LD>   In a deposition released Monday, Ballmer said that some of the
wording in the states' proposals, such as one requiring documentation
of interfaces between Windows and other programs, is so broad as to
make it impossible for the company to comply.</LD>
<LD>   "There's simply no way to do that for the existing product set,"
Ballmer said. "There will be no Windows PCs shipped."</LD>
<TE>   Ballmer, who hasn't testified in court on Microsoft's behalf
before, is likely to be one of the software giant's most important
witnesses in hearings on the landmark antitrust case scheduled to
begin next week.</TE>
<TE>   At that trial, California, eight other states and the District of
Columbia will try to show that a deal between Microsoft and the
federal Justice Department doesn't go far enough to rein in the
company's aggressive tactics.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft has responded by arguing that the states' proposal would
seriously damage the technology industry and the economy in general.</TE>
<TE>   In the sworn interview conducted last month by lawyers for both
sides, Ballmer went even further, saying the Redmond, Wash., software
behemoth might have to shut its doors.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, he complained about the states' plan to force
Microsoft to auction off the right to make versions of the Office
software suite that would work on Linux or other operating systems.</TE>
<TE>   Assuming the new version sold to consumers for less, Microsoft
might be forced to match the discounting, wiping out one of the
company's most valuable franchises, Ballmer said.</TE>
<TE>   "If two people sell exactly the same thing, they sell them for
zero price," Ballmer said, citing what he called a tenet of the
software industry.</TE>
<TE>   Ballmer spent much of his time on definitions and other details in
the states' proposal, sometimes choosing the most draconian
interpretation. But at least some of his argument was powerful enough
to prompt changes Monday in the states' proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Ballmer maintained that the original proposal calling for the
company to offer stripped-down versions of Windows without a Web
browser, media player or other advanced functions would cripple the
company, because it would have to offer millions of different
versions.</TE>
<TE>   The states then changed the wording in their plan to say that
Microsoft had to make only one new version of its operating
system--but one that was modular, so that computer companies could
remove pieces without damaging the rest.</TE>
<TE>   "Microsoft therefore would not be required to provide numerous
versions of the operating system," said Iowa Attorney General Tom
Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said the
modifications "clarify and sharpen our proposed remedies, without
weakening them."</TE>
<TE>   "The modified measures should deflate Microsoft's overblown
rhetoric and apocalyptic predictions about the proposed remedies,"
Blumenthal said.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate deposition, Jim Allchin, one of the chief architects
of the Windows operating system, described a proposal to strip out
parts of Windows as "terrible" and "so mind-blowing to me I don't
even know what to say about them." Allchin argued with two lawyers
for the non-settling states that it would be impossible for Microsoft
to accomplish what the states were proposing.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't do what you've got here," said Allchin, who had a
severe cold. "There's no way. Forget about any business thing.
Technically I just couldn't do it."</TE>
<TE>   Under questioning, Allchin acknowledged that Microsoft has not
conducted any formal technical reviews to determine whether the
states' plan was feasible. "It's unimplementable," Allchin said.
"That's my technical judgment. I haven't done any studies on it."</TE>
<TE>   But Allchin also agreed that Windows XP, released last year, is
modular and contains "chunks of functionality" that could be swapped
out.</TE>
<TE>   The depositions reflect many changes within Microsoft since the
trial began.</TE>
<TE>   After the government used Microsoft e-mails against the company,
Allchin said he now tells employees to refrain from using obscenities
and "full concepts" in e-mail messages.</TE>
<TE>   "I probably matured quite a bit" in e-mail use, Allchin said.</TE>
<TE>   Allchin also referred to an especially embarrassing part of
Microsoft's case, in which the company showed a videotape to make the
argument that Windows would be damaged if a user attempted to remove
the Internet Explorer Web browser. Microsoft later admitted that the
demonstration computer was rigged.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you have any expectation as to whether or not you will be
putting together similar demonstration for this part of the case?"
state lawyers asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Not exactly like that one," Allchin said.</TE>

<HD>Providian Moving to Lower the Risk</HD>
<DH>Financial services: Policy of attracting customers with
poor credit histories has proved costly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELEN STOCK</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Providian Financial Corp., whose stock fell 94% last year, wants to
attract more reliable credit card customers by lowering interest
rates, revamping its frequent-flier program and adding pictures to
its plastic, said the company's new marketing head.</LD>
<LD>   "If you don't have an attractive product and you don't have it
priced in an attractive way, that's an equation for trouble," said
Warren Wilcox, vice chairman of planning and marketing. "We'll be
more in sync with what the smartest competitors in our market are
doing."</LD>
<LD>   The seventh-biggest U.S. issuer of Visa and MasterCard added
millions of customers with poor or short credit histories in recent
years, charging them as much as 23.99% interest for a basic card. As
the economy soured, many clients couldn't pay their bills.</LD>
<TE>   Shailesh Mehta, who ran the San Francisco-based business since
1988, resigned in October and was replaced by Joseph Saunders, the
former head of FleetBoston Financial Corp.'s credit card unit.</TE>
<TE>   Saunders brought in Wilcox, who had worked with him for more than
15 years.</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox said he wants to take on competitors such as Capital One
Financial Corp. and Discover Financial Services, owned by Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co. In some cases, rivals are charging
customers 2 to 3 percentage points less than Providian for similar
cards, he said, although he declined to specify how much the company
will change rates.</TE>
<TE>   Providian may boost its rewards program, in which clients accrue
points that can be used toward travel on any airline, and put
landscape photos or other designs on cards that are currently solid
colors, Wilcox said.</TE>
<TE>   It also may sell installment loans, which it has never offered
before, or lines of credit, last available in 1995, he said. Lines of
credit allow customers to borrow by writing checks.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to have a broad and potent product array," said Wilcox,
44, who was at Household International Inc. for 12 years before
taking a job as executive vice president of planning and development
at FleetBoston in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Providian stumbled in its previous attempts to appeal to so-called
platinum customers, those with the best track record for paying
bills, Wilcox said.</TE>
<TE>   The company plans to send out improved direct-mail appeals to
these types of consumers in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Providian shares closed Monday at $4.55, up 51 cents, on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Verizon to Slash Jobs to Reduce Costs</HD>
<DH>Telecom: The company will eliminate the equivalent of
10,000 positions this year as it focuses on long-distance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Verizon Communications Inc. will eliminate the equivalent of 10,000
jobs this year to lower costs as sales growth slows.</LD>
<LD>   The reductions add to the equivalent of 29,000 jobs cut last year,
Co-Chief Executive Ivan Seidenberg said Monday at an investor
conference in Orlando, Fla. Verizon ended 2001 with 247,000
employees, down 16,000 from the previous year. That doesn't include
"equivalent" head count, which the company said includes overtime and
contractors.</LD>
<LD>   Seidenberg, who didn't say how many workers will be fired, is
paring expenses after local-phone lines declined for a third straight
period and consumers relied more on mobile phones in the latest
quarter. Sales at the biggest local phone company rose less than 1%
in the fourth period, down from 2.8% in the third.</LD>
<TE>   Verizon and other large regional phone companies "are not in great
shape because of the softer economy," said Lowell Miller of
Miller/Howard Investments Inc., which manages $300 million and owns
170,000 Verizon shares.</TE>
<TE>   Rivals including SBC Communications Inc., the second-biggest U.S.
local-phone company by sales, and Qwest Communications International
Inc. have cut jobs and capital spending in the last year to cope with
the U.S. recession and demand that didn't live up to expectations.
Smaller local-phone companies, such as McLeod USA Inc., have sought
bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   New York-based Verizon has "a wonderful opportunity to get leaner
without having to worry about a lot of competition," Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   The company, formed in 2000 by the combination of Bell Atlantic
Corp. and GTE Corp., plans capital spending of $15billion to
$16billion this year, compared with $17.4billion in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Varettoni, a Verizon spokesman, said 2% to 3% of the work
force, on average, has left the company voluntarily each year.</TE>
<TE>   Seidenberg, at the Credit Suisse First Boston investor conference,
also reiterated 2002 forecasts, which include profit of $3.20 to
$3.30 a share and a sales increase of 3% to 5%. Sales were $67.2
billion last year.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon has 8 million long-distance customers and is on track to
reach a goal of 10 million by the end of the year, Seidenberg said.
The company is trying to win U.S. approval to sell the service in
more states to make up for slowing local-phone sales.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Verizon fell 66 cents to $47.93 on the New York Stock
Exchange. They have risen less than 1% this year.</TE>

<HD>French Utility Reduces Value of U.S. Filter Unit</HD>
<DH>Water: Vivendi Environnement says slumping orders led to
$2.3-billion write-down of Palm Desert company.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Environnement, the world's largest water company, posted a
loss of $1.96 billion last year as declining orders from U.S.
industry prompted it to write down the value of Palm Desert-based
U.S. Filter Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The French company, majority-owned by Vivendi Universal, reduced
the value of its U.S. Filter water unit by $2.3 billion, Chief
Executive Henri Proglio said. It paid $7.9 billion in cash and
assumed debt for the world's largest water-treatment company in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   "They overpaid for an asset which is now worth less," said Andrew
Bell, who helps manage $4.27billion in equities as a strategist at
Carr Sheppards Crosthwaite in London. "The size of the write-down is
probably an unwelcome shock."</LD>
<TE>   Vivendi Environnement follows companies including Vodafone Group
and AOL Time Warner Inc. in writing down the value of purchases made
when the economy was expanding and stocks were surging. Slumping
orders at one of U.S. Filter's units cut the value of the
California-based company, the French utility said.</TE>
<TE>   "The world economy is not the same today as in June 2000," when
Vivendi split its water, waste, energy and transport business into a
separate company, Proglio said. Without the one-time goodwill charge,
2001 profit rose 23% to $365 million from $297 million the year
before.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi bought U.S. Filter, whose clients include General Motors
Corp. and Conoco Inc., to become the top water company in the
deregulated U.S. market. The acquisition was the biggest U.S.
purchase by a French company at that time.</TE>
<TE>   To return to profit this year, Vivendi Environnement expects to
book $870 million from asset sales, including units of U.S. Filter
such as its filters and surface-preparation business, Proglio said.
Those units are either not part of the water company's main business
or are depressing earnings, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The charge "is simply an accounting change," Proglio said. The
company reduced the book value of its water assets in the U.S. to be
consistent with the market value now, and with future cash flows, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   RWE, the world's third-biggest water company, agreed to pay about
$7.6 billion for American Water Works Co., the largest publicly
traded U.S. water utility, in September. The price valued American
Water at about 16 times earnings before interest and tax. Vivendi
paid 46.5 times operating profit for U.S. Filter, based on the U.S.
company's 1998 earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Suez's buyout offer for United Resources Water Inc., No. 2 in the
U.S. behind U.S. Filter, valued United Resources at $2.2 billion in
stock and assumed debt, or six times sales. Vivendi paid about 1.3
times sales for U.S. Filter, Bloomberg data show.</TE>

<HD>'O Brother' CD Puts Lost Highway Records on Map</HD>
<DH>Marketing: Winning the best-album Grammy despite sparse
radio airplay is music to the ears of company's chief.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Radio programmers pride themselves on their skill in reading
listeners' musical tastes.</LD>
<LD>   So it's easy to understand why some country music radio executives
tense up at mention of Luke Lewis. The soundtrack from "O Brother,
Where Art Thou?," released by Lewis' Lost Highway Records label, won
the Grammy Award for album of the year last week, punctuating the
success of a release that has racked up estimated sales of 4 million
copies--even though most radio stations chose not to air it.</LD>
<LD>   "A lot of programmers are risk-averse, and they're more worried
about people tuning out than they are interested in drawing people
in," Lewis said. "In their minds, 'O Brother' is at best a novelty
record. To them it doesn't [fit their format], but maybe that's
because everything else they're playing sounds the same. They've got
to pay attention now."</LD>
<TE>   Barely a year after opening its doors, Lost Highway is emerging as
a source of cutting-edge country music and proving that record labels
can thrive without lavishing millions on radio promotion. The label
was launched as a joint venture of two of Vivendi Universal's music
divisions: Mercury Nashville and Island Def Jam. Country is by far
the most popular radio format in the nation, accounting for about 20%
of all commercial stations.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, 55, who has been in the music business since the mid-
1970s, has been running Mercury Nashville for a decade. And he is
credited with developing country-pop star Shania Twain, who has the
best-selling album of the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Lost Highway, which Lewis launched with Island Def Jam President
Lyor Cohen, became the first new Nashville label in a decade and set
out to nurture alternative country artists who had received little
airplay. Lewis' business plan is to sign artists who already bring a
cult following, then build sales by investing in retail advertising
and street marketing. Owing primarily to the success of "O Brother,"
the label earned more than $20 million on estimated sales of $50
million, Universal sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The film "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" is set in Depression-era
Mississippi and follows three escaped convicts in a retelling of
Homer's "Odyssey." The soundtrack draws on folk, bluegrass and
Appalachian music performed by such acts as Emmylou Harris and Alison
Krauss.</TE>
<TE>   To promote the "O Brother" soundtrack, Lost Highway distributed
thousands of free copies of the album at bluegrass festivals,
packaged in a "Dapper Dan" pomade container inspired by the film, and
made available free downloads of at least three songs from the album
on Web sites such as Amazon.com. Lewis also credits the heavy
rotation received for the music video for the lead single, "I Am a
Man of Constant Sorrow," on the Country Music Television cable
channel.</TE>
<TE>   Lost Highway's success is likely to stoke the already heated
tension between country music's label chiefs and radio executives.
Lewis and other record executives say country music has become boring
and is losing its identity.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcasters say the genre is healthy but the distinctions among
radio formats are too rigid to allow them to experiment with more
traditional sounds, including the rootsy songs of the "O Brother"
soundtrack.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis contends that the time is right for programmers at country
stations to broaden their playlists. On average, ratings at country
stations have dropped about 33% since 1995, according to radio
representation firm Interep. And even with the crossover success of
Faith Hill and other acts, country albums accounted for just 9% of
the U.S. music market last year, down from about 12% in 1995,
according to data from SoundScan.</TE>
<TE>   But several radio station programmers said they are not about to
start embracing more traditional country music.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't drill down into other genres of country. We are just
[playing] the hits," said Michael Cruise, program director for
country music giant KKBQ-FM, a Houston station that plays the same
songs by top acts as many as 100 times a week.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew going in there was no reason to even test this thing"
with listeners, he said. "We're not very willing to play records just
willy-nilly without the benefit of [listener] research."</TE>
<TE>   Radio stations' primary tool for examining listeners' tastes is
"call-out research," phone polling in which listeners rate a song
after hearing a snippet played over the phone. Joe Lenski, vice
president of Edison Media Research, said such polling tends to favor
music that sounds familiar but "doesn't do a good job of picking the
next new trend."</TE>
<TE>   Edison data released last week are spurring more debate about "O
Brother." A survey conducted last month found that among country
music fans who knew of the film or owned the album, 50% said radio
stations should play more such music--five times the number of
respondents who said programmers should play less.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a disconnect when a phenomenon like 'O Brother' isn't
even talked about on the radio station," Lenski said. "Here,
programmers are saying, 'We know better than you.' That's a mistake.
They all missed this, and they'll probably miss the next big thing."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, an analysis of Internet file-swapping services suggests
that contrary to some programmers' contentions, the music of "O
Brother" gained a following among fans of more contemporary country.
Data from Los Angeles research firm BigChampagne shows that among
fans who downloaded songs from the soundtrack, the acts most
frequently downloaded are mainstream country stars, including Alan
Jackson, George Strait and Toby Keith--the same artists who top the
playlists of many country stations.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, a former Army journalist, broke into the record business
when he landed a job as a sales rep for CBS Records in 1976. He spent
more than a decade with the company, then became MCA's vice president
of sales and marketing in 1988. Four years later, he was lured to
Tennessee by Mercury's Nashville division, where he was named
president.</TE>
<TE>   He describes Lost Highway's success as "Music Business 101."</TE>
<TE>   "You just try to get as many people as you can to hear the music,"
he said. "Get it exposed and get it in a store where somebody can buy
it."</TE>

<HD>Stocks Surge in 2nd Day of Rally</HD>
<DH>Investors push Dow to its highest close since July 19 as
hopes for economic recovery replace accounting fears.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO and KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors put away any lingering doubts about the recession's end and
pushed Enron Corp. worries far into the background Monday, as stock
prices rocketed for a second straight session.</LD>
<LD>   On the heels of last week's surprisingly robust economic reports,
the Dow Jones industrial average soared 217.96 points, or 2.1%, to
10,586.82, the highest close since July 19. The index leaped 262
points Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The market's gains Monday, in heavy trading, lifted other key
indexes back into positive territory for the year to date, after a
drubbing in January and February.</LD>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, up 2.3% on Friday, rose 2% on
Monday, leaving it up 0.5% since year's end. The Nasdaq composite
gained 56.58 points, or 3.1%, to 1,859.32 on Monday, though it's
still down 4.7% this year.</TE>
<TE>   As on Friday, stocks closed at or near their highs for the day,
suggesting that big investors are rushing to put money to work.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street's net two-day advance was its strongest since
Sept.24-25, when prices rallied after diving in the week after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Enron debacle has weighed heavily on the market this
year, causing many investors to question the honesty of corporate
accounting, "At the end of the day the main event is that we're going
to have an economic recovery," said Jeffrey Applegate, investment
strategist at brokerage Lehman Bros. in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Fresh data Friday showed a dramatic turnaround in the
manufacturing sector in February and continuing strength in consumer
spending in January.</TE>
<TE>   That information helped persuade Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s chief
economist, Bruce Steinberg, to raise his estimate Monday for U.S.
economic growth this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Demand is coming back far more quickly than anyone had expected,"
Steinberg said.</TE>
<TE>   In turn, that is boosting hopes that corporate profits, which had
been expected to recover in the second half, may grow even faster
than investors assumed.</TE>
<TE>   Investors Monday were particularly hungry for shares of
heavy-industry firms, in a bet that they may enjoy some of the
largest percentage gains in earnings as demand for their products
recovers.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow was led higher by General Motors, up $3.73 to $58.70;
machinery giant Caterpillar, up $2.75 to $59.08; and aluminum
industry leader Alcoa, up $1.64 to $39.56. Airline stocks also were
up sharply, as were financial issues and home builders.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign stock markets rallied sharply as well. Japan's Nikkei-225
index zoomed 638.22 points, or 5.9%, to 11,450.22.</TE>
<TE>   Some stock buyers were doing so under duress: "Short
sellers"--traders who borrow stock and sell it, betting on lower
prices--have been under pressure to terminate those bets as the
market has rocketed since Friday. As they buy shares to close out
their positions, short sellers can help power a market advance.</TE>
<TE>   But Monday's rally was driven by more than short-covering,
analysts said. Winners topped losers by about 2 to 1 on the New York
Stock Exchange and on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   In the technology sector, some of the biggest winners of the last
two sessions have been semiconductor stocks. That sector is viewed as
a classic way to bet on a recovery in demand for computers and other
tech equipment.</TE>
<TE>   A notable loser Monday, though, was software giant Oracle. It
plunged $2.32 to $13.67 after warning Friday that earnings in the
quarter just ended won't meet expectations. Oracle's sell-off didn't
stop other tech shares from rallying, but analysts noted that tech
indexes have significantly underperformed the heavy-industry and
transportation sectors in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   That points up a key issue for technology and the market overall:
Stocks' price-to-earnings ratios, on average, remain historically
high--or at least, not cheap.</TE>
<TE>   With many stocks priced at about 20 times estimated 2002 earnings
per share--and with many tech shares selling for far higher
P/Es--Applegate believes the market already is "reasonably close" to
the high end of a fair valuation.</TE>
<TE>   However, investors' views of what's "fair" for a stock's price can
change with their estimation of future earnings growth. Those views
also depend on what alternative investments are paying.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks now are attracting some investors by default: The average
yield on taxable money-market mutual funds now is about 1.3%, a
record low, thanks to the Federal Reserve's drastic cuts in
short-term interest rates over the last year.</TE>
<TE>   "When you can only make 1.3% on your cash, it just burns a hole in
your pocket," said Frank Glaser, a Los Angeles retiree and investor.</TE>
<TE>   Long-term Treasury bond yields also remain relatively low. The
yield on the 10-year T-note edged up to 5% on Monday from 4.98% on
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Just a few weeks ago, as the Enron scandal shook investors'
confidence in the financial system, Treasury bonds still had
significant appeal for many. But the economy's brightening outlook is
demanding more investors' attention, and shifting their focus back to
stocks, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   The Enron blowup even has made some investors more optimistic,
they say. Charlene Hyde, a Pacific Palisades speech pathologist, said
the congressional scrutiny of companies' accounting procedures is
encouraging for the market.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very positive thing that [lawmakers] are not letting them
get away with it," she said. "I think it bodes well for the future
because it's likely to make other companies a little more
forthcoming."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, trust in an economic recovery also outweighed any
concerns over the renewed heavy fighting in Afghanistan. Robert
Bissell, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Los
Angeles, said that although investors still have worries about the
Afghanistan situation and the possibility of another major terrorist
attack, "The difference now is that it looks like the momentum is on
our side" in the war effort.</TE>

<HD>Justices to Decide on  NextWave Licenses</HD>
<DH>Wireless: Court will consider whether U.S. must pay
billions to get back spectrum space. Some say two sides now may try
harder to settle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide whether the government
must pay billions of dollars to reclaim unused wireless spectrum
space from NextWave Telecom Inc.</LD>
<LD>   The high court's action will further delay resolution of the
long-running dispute over valuable spectrum that could provide better
mobile phone service in several cities, but some analysts think it
will prompt a settlement.</LD>
<LD>   At stake is extra spectrum space for wireless transmissions in
overcrowded markets such as Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, San
Francisco, Seattle and Philadelphia.</LD>
<TE>   The stake for the federal government is huge too. Officials are
hoping to avoid a possible $16-billion setback.</TE>
<TE>   Six years ago, Congress and officials of the Federal
Communications Commission decided to auction spectrum space to the
highest bidders.</TE>
<TE>   Tiny NextWave bid $4.7 billion and won 63 licenses for wireless
service. The company planned to resell the licenses to other new
firms, but the value of their frequencies fell and NextWave was
unable to pay for what it had purchased.</TE>
<TE>   The company filed for bankruptcy protection in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   In response, the FCC moved to reclaim the frequencies, and a
second auction--in a rising market in 2001--brought in bids of nearly
$16 billion for the spectrum.</TE>
<TE>   Major carriers such as Verizon, AT&amp;T Wireless and Cingular
Wireless were among the successful bidders.</TE>
<TE>   But last year, the second auction was voided when the U.S. Court
of Appeals in Washington ruled that the FCC had violated the
bankruptcy laws when it seized NextWave's licenses.</TE>
<TE>   Agency officials tried to work out a settlement, but Congress
refused to pay for the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration lawyers also appealed to the Supreme Court and
urged the justices to reconsider the lower court's bankruptcy
decision.</TE>
<TE>   That ruling "voided the results of a [second] spectrum auction
that generated more than $15 billion in revenue for the U.S. Treasury
and effectively confiscated licenses from applicants who stood ready
to put the spectrum to its most efficient use," U.S. Solicitor Gen.
Theodore B. Olson told the court.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of NextWave say they too can put the spectrum to use now.</TE>
<TE>   With new financing, they said they were ready to build the
wireless network if their ownership of the licenses was confirmed.
They urged the Supreme Court to deny the government's appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the justices will hear arguments in the fall in the case
of FCC vs. NextWave Personal Communications. A ruling is not likely
until next spring.</TE>
<TE>   However, the court's move does not prevent leaders of NextWave and
Justice Department negotiators from negotiating a new settlement.</TE>
<TE>   NextWave shares fell $2.80 to $3.10 in the pink-sheet market.</TE>

<HD>Northrop's Bid Bucks Norm for  Aerospace</HD>
<DH>Defense: If he succeeds in acquiring TRW, Kent Kresa will
have more than tripled company's revenue since 1994.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the staid and often chummy world of defense contractors, hostile
takeover attempts such as Northrop Grumman Corp.'s bid for TRW Inc.
are rare occurrences.</LD>
<LD>   A friendly handshake to complete a deal is typical in the
industry, where most chief executives not only know each other but
have worked with each other on government programs and try to avoid
confrontations.</LD>
<LD>   But for Northrop Chairman Kent Kresa, whose mild-mannered,
studious demeanor belies a tenacious maverick, the hostile bid for
TRW is the latest in a string of high-profile and contentious
acquisitions that have reshaped the Century City-based defense
contractor into a powerhouse.</LD>
<TE>   And more often than not, Kresa has succeeded, a track record that
analysts believe will serve Northrop well as it goes after the
industry's biggest remaining prize.</TE>
<TE>   Under Kresa's leadership, Northrop has been on a corporate
acquisition spree, taking over 14 companies in the last decade and
amassing a business that has interests in virtually every aspect of
the nation's military, from unmanned spy planes to aircraft carriers.
TRW, which develops spy satellites and battlefield command systems,
would be its largest trophy.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like Kresa is going to end up being the most successful
defense executive of the post-Cold War era," said Loren Thompson,
director of the national security program at the Lexington Institute,
a public policy research firm. "When you meet him, it's hard to
believe this is the same guy that put the screws to so many
organizations."</TE>
<TE>   If Kresa succeeds in acquiring TRW--and many analysts believe he
will--Northrop would grow to a company with $27billion in annual
revenue, compared with $8billion before its first major deal in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Kresa, 63, is one of the longest-serving chief executives in the
defense industry, serving in that job since 1990. He came to Northrop
in 1975 after working as a deputy director of the Defense Advanced
Research Agency, a Pentagon unit that funds the nation's leading-
edge and most secretive weapons programs. He has graduate degrees in
engineering, aeronautics and astronautics from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.</TE>
<TE>   A fiercely competitive tennis player, Kresa also Rollerblades. He
has a base salary of $1 million, but he earned $2.8 million in
bonuses last year. Kresa, who projects an image of a bumbling
professor, first stunned the industry and ruffled corporate
boardrooms in 1994 when he made a $2.1-billion hostile bid for Navy
aircraft maker Grumman Corp. It came just days after Grumman reached
a friendly pact to be acquired by Martin Marietta.</TE>
<TE>   He made a similar move last year when Northrop went after Newport
News Shipbuilding Inc., after the military shipbuilder already had
inked a deal with rival General Dynamics Corp.</TE>
<TE>   In both cases, Kresa portrayed Northrop as a jilted victim who
already was talking to the partners about a merger only to have them
turn around and hook up with others. Kresa prevailed in both cases.</TE>
<TE>   And two weeks ago, Kresa was making a similar argument as Northrop
made a surprising unsolicited offer for TRW. In vintage Kresa style,
he said Northrop had been talking to TRW for years about a possible
merger but that it now was forced to act because of the unusual
circumstances when TRW Chairman David Cote abruptly resigned to take
a top post at Honeywell International, leading to speculation that it
had become an acquisition target.</TE>
<TE>   Although Northrop's so-called "bear hug" proposal was considered
friendly, the company was gearing up for a fight, hiring a proxy
solicitation firm to wage a battle for shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Northrop began applying pressure on TRW directors,
saying it was filing three lawsuits challenging laws in TRW's home
state of Ohio that, among others, would prohibit Northrop from
splitting up the business within three years of completing the
acquisition. Northrop wants to sell or spin off TRW's automotive
parts business, which is saddled with debt and has been a drag on
earnings. Another law Northrop is challenging prohibits shareholders
who acquired more than $250,000 in TRW stock since the bid was
announced from voting on the deal.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Northrop launched a hostile bid and said it
would begin appealing to TRW shareholders. The moves came less than
24 hours after TRW directors rejected as inadequate Northrop's
initial offer of $47 a share, or $5.9 billion.</TE>
<TE>   TRW's board reiterated its criticism at the timing of the
proposal, calling it an "opportunistic attempt" at a time when "TRW's
stock price was temporarily depressed" after the sudden departure of
its chairman. Northrop made an unsolicited offer just three days
after Cote's resignation, which set off a selling frenzy that saw TRW
stock plummet 26%.</TE>
<TE>   But TRW also left open the possibility that it could entertain a
higher bid. The statement noted that its shares had closed at $50.05
Friday, or $3 more than Northrop's offer. But the stock has remained
at about $50 with investors anticipating a rival bid.</TE>
<TE>   Lockheed Martin Co. and General Dynamics were considered potential
competitors, but sources said Monday that both firms are backing away
from possible bids because the acquisition would pose some problems.
Lockheed, for instance, has significant satellite and missile defense
businesses much like TRW, which could prompt intense regulatory
scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   Another firm that has been keenly interested faces another issue
altogether. The U.S. unit of BAE Systems, one of the largest defense
contractors in Europe, wants TRW's defense electronics business but
the Pentagon may be reluctant to have a British firm have its hands
on some of TRW's most secretive military programs.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, Northrop has lost some battles including the
acquisition of Hughes Electronics and Texas Instruments, both of
which were purchased by Raytheon Co. and were regarded as carrying
unjustifiable price.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, one of the few friendly deals--a pact to be acquired
by Lockheed Martin--was derailed by regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Paul H. Nisbet, an analyst with JSA Research Inc., said Northrop
has put TRW directors in a bind. If no competing bid comes forth, TRW
shares are sure to drop, giving Northrop the leverage it needs to
seek a deal close to its initial offer. And if Northrop were to walk
away from the table, TRW shares could fall even lower.</TE>
<TE>   "I suspect that it's more likely they'll reach an agreeable price
level and more or less force TRW to agree to be taken over," Nisbet
said. "Not being taken over would risk the stock going below $40, and
stockholders would not be pleased with that."</TE>
<TE>   To Jon B. Kutler, a longtime defense investment banker who has
followed many of Northrop's acquisitions in the last decade, the
latest action against TRW provides a classic example of Kresa's
acumen for acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's once again a brilliant execution," Kutler said. "They're
playing their cards just right."</TE>

<HD>Course Owner Hits Rough</HD>
<DH>National Golf and American Golf chairman, David G. Price,
faces conflict-of-interest charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After spending 30 years building a nationwide golf course empire, Los
Angeles businessman and philanthropist David G. Price is struggling
to salvage his companies and his reputation amid mounting financial
pressures and charges of conflict of interest.</LD>
<LD>   Price's problems have surprised many in the golf business who
thought his two Santa Monica-based companies, publicly traded
National Golf Properties Inc. and privately owned American Golf
Corp., were strong enough to withstand the intense competition and
drop in demand facing the industry.</LD>
<LD>   National Golf is the country's largest publicly owned real estate
investment trust focused on golfing properties, with shares traded on
the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   American Golf operates more than 300 properties, including the
prestigious Mountain Gate Golf and Tennis Club in Los Angeles and
five public courses owned by the city of Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   But American Golf finds itself in trouble with its lenders and is
having difficulty making payments on many of its leases, primarily
those involving the more than 130 golf courses owned by its sister
company, National Golf.</TE>
<TE>   Price and National Golf have been hit with shareholder lawsuits,
and a proposal to merge both firms has been criticized as a deal that
would primarily benefit Price. One likely scenario, according to a
Wall Street investment bank, has National Golf filing for bankruptcy
protection. Price declined to be interviewed for this story.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the lawsuits and mounting criticism from investors and
Wall Street analysts, people familiar with Price, who serves as
chairman of both companies, don't expect the former Navy fighter
pilot to give up control of either company without a struggle.</TE>
<TE>   "There are certainly some conflicts of interest," said golf course
industry consultant William H. Sherman. But "you are not going to
force him out unless he wants to get out."</TE>
<TE>   Price may be out of favor on Wall Street, but on many a fairway
and putting green, the 69-year-old is recognized as an industry
pioneer and innovator who grew wealthy applying corporate-style
operating methods and standards to the golf course business.</TE>
<TE>   A former attorney with experience in the hotel and restaurant
industries, Price founded American Golf in the early 1970s and was
soon turning money-losing private and public courses into efficient
and profitable ventures. Ironically, Price is not a golfer.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at it as a business, not a sport," Price told The Times in
a 1986 interview. "Most golf courses are run by pros who, as
athletes, know lots about the sport but generally not much about
budgets, marketing or management. We come in and offer economies of
scale. Cities make money. We make money."</TE>
<TE>   The wealth generated by the golf course business allowed Price and
his former wife, Dallas, who also is a shareholder in both golfing
companies, to maintain a prominent profile in Los Angeles society and
to bankroll many charities and institutions. The couple helped found
the Museum of Flying in Santa Monica, and Dallas Price donated $10
million to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. The Prices
also have poured substantial sums into building the $30-million
campus for the Oaks Christian High School in Westlake Village.</TE>
<TE>   Price spent his early years in the business overcoming many
skeptics and opposition from some golfers and public employees who
claimed his concept of privately run, public courses would be a
costly fiasco and result in steep fee hikes for golfers.</TE>
<TE>   Government agencies nationwide dismissed such objections and
turned to American Golf, which is nearly 90% owned by the Price
family, for help in running their courses</TE>
<TE>   "He had a brilliant idea," said Craig Kessler, executive director
of the Public Links Golf Assn. of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   American Golf "proved that the private sector could manage
[public] properties and turn losers into winners."</TE>
<TE>   Price again broke ground in 1993 by founding National Golf
Properties as the first publicly traded real estate investment trust
that specialized in golf course properties. As a REIT, National Golf
is prohibited from owning operating companies and contracted with
American Golf to run most of its properties. As a result, it is
dependent on American Golf for the vast majority of its income.</TE>
<TE>   Once sources of strength, the close relations between the two
companies and the Price family ties now are considered liabilities.
Undermined by the golf industry slump, American Golf last year told
National Golf it probably could not make lease payments and that its
deteriorating financial health had put it in technical default on
some of its loans. As a result, National Golf also was in technical
default on its loans and was forced to cut its dividend.</TE>
<TE>   A shareholder lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in February
said Price misappropriated National Golf funds through a "scheme of
complicated financial dealings" that involved entities controlled by
the executive. In addition, the lawsuit charged that $31 million
raised by a secondary offering of National Golf stock went to a
"Price-controlled entity," Oaks Christian High School</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for National Golf said the firm has reviewed the
lawsuit and found it "completely without merit."</TE>
<TE>   As concerns about National Golf have grown, its share price has
tumbled by more than 75% since summer. On Monday, National Golf
shares closed at $5.91, down 19 cents, on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Investors also were rattled after investment firm Morgan Stanley
said a bankruptcy filing "remained a real possibility" given the poor
performance by American Golf and a batch of maturing loans.</TE>
<TE>   But National Golf officials have ruled out filing for bankruptcy
and have announced a merger between the two firms that would create a
firm that would operate as a traditional corporation, not a REIT. The
firm also has said it has worked with lenders to resolve its loan
problems.</TE>
<TE>   "This restructuring of the relationship with American Golf into a
single entity will over time give better value to the stakeholders,"
said Charles Paul, who heads a committee of independent directors and
serves as National's interim chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Paul said the directors, not Price, are calling the shots at
National Golf while the merger and reorganization are being worked
out. "We are independent from the American Golf interests and
independent from the Price family-affiliated interests."</TE>
<TE>   But some analysts and National Golf investors say the proposed
deal is skewed in favor of Price.</TE>
<TE>   Carl Tash, chief executive of Cliffwood Partners, a Los Angeles
investment firm that owns a 9% stake in National Golf, said he is
concerned about loading the newly merged company with American Golf's
problems and debt.</TE>
<TE>   "If American Golf has had financial difficulties, it should clean
up its balance sheet first and then approach National Golf" about a
deal, Tash said. "When you have a tenant that is not paying rent, why
are you running into their arms instead of extricating yourself."</TE>
<TE>   The deal "almost looks like a bailout of American Golf by National
Golf," said Steve Sakwa, a real estate securities analyst at Merrill
Lynch. "As a [National Golf] shareholder, why would I want to do
that?"</TE>
<TE>   Although the merger calls for National Golf and American Golf to
be reborn as a new company, Price and his family would remain heavily
involved in the operation. Under the terms of the proposed merger,
David Price would serve as chairman of the board with a five-year
employment contract.</TE>
<TE>   The Prices, as majority owners of American Golf, also would
receive most of the one million shares of preferred stock that would
be convertible into common stock in the new company at $15 a share.</TE>
<TE>   "To think that he is out is naive," said one investment specialist
who follows the company. "They are all so intertwined that it's hard
to get him out of the equation."</TE>

<HD>Playing Chicken With Steel Imports</HD>
<DH>Trade: Bush's industry rescue effort already has sparked a
reaction overseas, including Russia's poultry ban.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH and MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration is expected to impose new tariffs to shield
U.S. steel companies from overseas competition, but it will try to
avoid a broader trade war with irate allies.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush has not announced details of his plan on the steel
issue. But the administration made it clear Monday that it intended
to impose some combination of tariffs and quotas to give the ailing
U.S. steel industry more time to consolidate and restructure.</LD>
<LD>   The first skirmishes in a trade war already have occurred. On
Sunday, Russia will begin blocking imports of U.S. poultry, a move
sought by Russian steelmakers. Brazil, meanwhile, warned Monday that
the Bush rescue plan could prompt retaliatory actions, and officials
in Europe and Japan said they would consider filing challenges with
the World Trade Organization.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, an administration official said, efforts were
underway to address the concerns of trading partners "who may not
like everything that we announce" and who have the ability to strike
back. "They're going to have recourse in other venues," said the
official, who requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   There are practical limits to the scope of any global backlash.
WTO members can ask the group to review the U.S. trade restrictions,
but they are not supposed to engage in tit-for-tat retaliation.
Although Russia is not a WTO member and is not bound by its rules, it
wants to join the group and may be reluctant to push the issue too
far.</TE>
<TE>   "Other countries are not going to just roll over and take this
lying down," said Ben Goodrich, a trade expert at the Institute for
International Economics in Washington. "But the mechanisms for direct
retaliation are either illegal or frowned upon."</TE>
<TE>   Some U.S. trading partners may attempt to influence the
administration in more subtle ways. Europe, for example, has not yet
decided how much compensation it will seek under a WTO ruling that a
U.S. tax break for businesses with overseas operations amounted to an
illegal subsidy. Brazil's cooperation is essential to the
administration's campaign to create a Free Trade Area of the
Americas. Europe and Japan are big players in a newly launched round
of global trade talks.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's damage-control operation reflects the
political and economic complexity of the steel issue and the
difficulty of crafting a response that assists the industry without
alienating other powerful constituencies.</TE>
<TE>   In October, the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled that
imports have severely injured the U.S. industry, which has struggled
for years to compete with foreign producers that benefit from lower
costs and government subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   The problem has become particularly acute since the 1997 Asian
financial crisis, which caused an import surge. During the last four
years, more than 20,000 U.S. steel industry jobs have been
eliminated, and 31 companies have entered bankruptcy proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   How Bush responds to the industry's travails could have big
political repercussions. Major steel-producing states, such as West
Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio, are viewed as key swing states in
the 2004 presidential campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the International Trade Commission's governing board
recommended an assortment of tariffs and quotas to restrict steel
imports to the U.S. and boost prices in 16 product lines. Bush can
accept, reject or modify their recommendations as he sees fit, but he
is required by law to announce his response by Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials have signaled in advance that they will
not impose the across-the-board, 40% tariffs sought by U.S.
steelmakers. Nor do they plan to have taxpayers pick up the "legacy
costs" associated with generous pension and health benefit programs
created in better days by now-bankrupt firms.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is expected to impose tariffs, perhaps exceeding 20%, in some
product categories. And that would be enough to antagonize U.S.
trading partners such as Russia, a major steel producer and the
world's biggest poultry importer.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian government said that as of Sunday, it would begin
banning imports of U.S. poultry. It attributed the action to concerns
about the use of potentially carcinogenic disinfectants by U.S.
processors. But the announcement came only two days after Russian
steelmakers asked Moscow to block U.S. chicken imports if Washington
erected big barriers to Russian steel.</TE>
<TE>   A Russian trade official insisted Monday that there was no linkage
between the two issues. But he acknowledged that the poultry ban by
"coincidence" might affect the kind of restrictions Bush assigns to
Russian steel.</TE>
<TE>   "I think maybe it would have some impact," said Aleksey Yegortsev,
a representative of the Russian Trade Mission in San Francisco.
"Russian steelmakers are suffering from American laws."</TE>
<TE>   The ban would have serious implications for the U.S. poultry
industry, which employs more people than does the steel industry.
Russia is the largest foreign buyer of U.S. products, accounting for
more than a third of exports and 8% of total production, according to
the National Chicken Council.</TE>
<TE>   Industry officials said a prolonged ban would force processors to
cut back production, which could lead to the loss of some of the
industry's 300,000 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "Russia is an important customer," said Ed Nicholson, spokesman
for processor Tyson Foods Inc. "Our industry has worked and will
continue to work closely with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to
address recent issues raised by Russian officials, but it appears our
products have become part of larger trade discussions."</TE>

<HD>Ouster of Priest Marks a Change in O.C. Diocese</HD>
<DH>Church: Bishop Brown draws praise--and criticism--for his
openness in handling the dismissal of Michael Pecharich, who molested
a teen boy 19 years ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In dismissing a priest Monday for molesting a teenage boy 19 years
ago, Bishop of Orange Tod D. Brown took a number of steps rare for
the traditionally secretive Roman Catholic Church.</LD>
<LD>   He brought aboard a crisis public relations specialist. He allowed
the priest, Michael Pecharich, to say goodbye to many of his 16,000
parishioners at services this past weekend. He set up discussion
sessions after Mass for shocked congregants. Brown even sent press
releases to the media and allowed news photographers to take pictures
as Pecharich gave his farewell.</LD>
<LD>   The public display stands in marked contrast to the approach taken
by the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, which quietly let go as many as a
dozen priests in the past two weeks under the same zero-tolerance
policy the Orange diocese follows. That policy was part of a
settlement agreement reached in August by the two dioceses over
separate accusations of molestations by priests.</LD>
<TE>   "This is their track record," said Mary Grant, a victim of sexual
abuse by an Orange County priest and founder of the Southern
California chapter of the Survivors Network of those Abused by
Priests. "There's something always concealed. It's not acceptable to
hide the perpetrators."</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, Grant and other observers of the church said
they were generally pleased with the new move toward openness. "They
should be open and honest like this," said David Belz, a longtime
church member and Pecharich supporter.</TE>
<TE>   "There's going to be pain no matter what. To handle it up front is
what's appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   The new approach is not without critics. At San Francisco Solano,
some parishioners thought the matter should have been handled
privately and resented the presence of the press at an emotional time
for their congregation. Nervous priests wondered why the bishop made
the announcement while the church officials were still checking the
backgrounds of other diocese employees.</TE>
<TE>   Diocesan officials admit to struggling with the details of
openness: How can they balance the rights of the victims, the clergy
and the public?</TE>
<TE>   "It's a learning process about what's the best way to do this,"
said Father Michael McKiernan, director of clergy personnel. "Is it
better for someone to just disappear? Or should he say goodbye?"</TE>
<TE>   And other congregants, stung by the decision to remove Pecharich
in Rancho Santa Margarita, have asked why the bishop, who advocates
openness, didn't visit the parish Sunday to face angry parishioners.
The news was announced at services Saturday evening and Sunday
morning, and the dismissal became effective Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "He is the shepherd of his flock, and his flock was in the most
dire emergency it could be in," parishioner Bob Beauchamp said. "Even
if Father Michael said, 'I don't want [the bishop] there,' he should
have been there. It was cowardly."</TE>
<TE>   'Story Got Better as Meetings Went On'</TE>
<TE>   Beauchamp also said the diocesan officials' explanations changed
with each meeting, including the reason for the bishop's absence.
"Their story got better as the meetings went on," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Parishioner Maureen McCarthy said she didn't know if news of
Pecharich's departure could ever remain within the congregation,
though she wished it could have. "I never would have liked it to go
this public," she said. "I don't see why his dirty laundry had to be
aired."</TE>
<TE>   Priests, though not willing to openly criticize their boss, have
asked why the public announcement wasn't held off until a task force
was able to complete its investigation into whether diocesan priests
have substantiated molestation charges in their backgrounds. They
said they would rather face a single, large public backlash than the
possibility of several small ones.</TE>
<TE>   But Brown, who was installed as bishop of Orange in 1998, said
it's his duty to report to the public the cases as they are found,
adding that the process should be finished shortly.</TE>
<TE>   "We just think it's important to deal with it as it becomes known
and as we ourselves become aware of it," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the diocese reported the matter to county Child Protective
Services in 1996, when it found out about the molestation.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the more public approach, Pecharich wrote a letter to
his parishioners that was handed out Sunday as they left Mass.</TE>
<TE>   "Nineteen years ago," it says, "I transgressed the personal
boundaries of an adolescent. The resulting sense of damage done to
another led me into a very painful and necessary journey of deep
regret, soul searching, therapeutic counseling and eventual growth
toward emotional maturity. I am truly sorry for the harm caused."</TE>
<TE>   One San Francisco Solano parishioner who liked the new approach is
Meg Waters, who handles crisis public relations for such groups as
the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, a coalition of South County
cities fighting an airport at El Toro. She had grown frustrated with
the way the Catholic Church dealt with priest molestation cases and
in February told Pecharich, her pastor, that she would volunteer her
services if the need ever arose in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Parishioner Helped With Announcement</TE>
<TE>   She heard about her pastor's removal when the diocese called Feb.
26 to enlist her services when making the public announcement. She
said she spent the next few days talking with church officials,
developing a plan and trying to hold back her tears.</TE>
<TE>   She said the diocese officials made for good clients who were
receptive to her ideas. Brown also received qualified praise from an
unlikely source.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to at least praise Bishop Brown for doing the right thing,
not keeping it secret," said Katherine K. Freberg, an Irvine attorney
who settled a molestation case against the Diocese of Orange for a
record $5.2 million in August. But she added that she didn't think
Pecharich should have been allowed to take the pulpit a final time.</TE>
<TE>   "I can understand why they allow it, but the church is coddling
these priests. Until they treat them for what they
are--criminals--there's not going to be real change."</TE>

<HD>Donor of Ayn Rand Manuscript, U.S. Are Not on the Same Page</HD>
<DH>Dispute: Giver saved a portion of 'The Fountainhead'
manuscript as a memento. It is seized.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ayn Rand wrote the book on the chasm between personal happiness and a
heavy-handed government. Leonard Peikoff illustrated it.</LD>
<LD>   That's how Rand fans say the empty picture frame on Peikoff's wall
figures into the fight over two pages of her original handwritten
manuscript of "The Fountainhead."</LD>
<LD>   Federal officials seized the pages after Peikoff joked that he
"stole" them from the Library of Congress.</LD>
<TE>   Peikoff, a writer and philosopher, was a lifelong friend of Rand
and is an expert on her philosophy of objectivism, which teaches that
individuals--not the government--are the key to the development of a
healthy society. He inherited the scrawled first drafts of "The
Fountainhead," "Atlas Shrugged" and two other books when she died in
1982.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven years ago he donated the manuscripts and other Rand papers
to the Library of Congress. For sentimental reasons, he said, he kept
the first and last pages of "The Fountainhead" and sent photocopies
to Washington with the remainder of the manuscript. Peikoff displayed
the original pages under a spotlight on the wall of his Irvine home.</TE>
<TE>   The groundbreaking 1943 novel helped define Rand's philosophy.
Part of that doctrine contends that man's pursuit of self-interest
requires government's willingness to step out of the way.</TE>
<TE>   But it is Peikoff who said he was forced to step aside when a
government agent showed up at his front door in January. The official
cut Rand's manuscript pages from his picture frame and confiscated
them as federal property.</TE>
<TE>   The irony of the seizure is not lost on Rand devotees.</TE>
<TE>   "Ayn Rand, I feel sure, would have said: 'The whole case is
another outrage by looting bureaucrats so drunk with power that they
must possess and flaunt even the very pages in which I have denounced
them,'" Peikoff said.</TE>
<TE>   Yaron Brook, head of the Marina del Rey-based Ayn Rand Institute,
agreed. "Ayn Rand portrayed the government as never happy with the
power it has. The bureaucrats always want to take more."</TE>
<TE>   Peikoff, 68, became acquainted with Rand in 1951 after reading
"The Fountainhead" as a 17-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   "It had changed my life," he said. "I took the train from
Winnipeg, Canada, and went to her house in Chatsworth to meet her."</TE>
<TE>   Soon, he was among those who would have 10-hour philosophical
discussions with the Russian-born author.</TE>
<TE>   Rand embraced Peikoff's work when he began interpreting her
philosophy in his own writings. Eventually, she wrote the
introduction and reviewed each chapter of his book on objectivism,
"The Ominous Parallels." It analyzed the philosophical causes of
Nazism and their parallels in contemporary America.</TE>
<TE>   Peikoff's decision to donate Rand's papers to the Library of
Congress came after he was hospitalized in 1991 with a heart attack.
Years earlier Rand had talked of sending them there. So Peikoff had
an assistant load 11 boxes of manuscripts, proofs and other documents
and ship them off--minus the original first and last pages of "The
Fountainhead."</TE>
<TE>   Peikoff said he later sent a private appraiser to Washington to
attest to the value of the Rand papers and to tell officials that two
of the "Fountainhead" pages were copies. The appraiser reported back
to him that the library didn't care, Peikoff said.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1998 Peikoff was interviewed for a Los Angeles Times
Magazine article about a resurgence of interest in Rand's work. The
interviewer spied the framed manuscript pages on the wall and was
taken by the famous opening paragraph written in Rand's own hand:
"Howard Roark laughed."</TE>
<TE>   Peikoff explained that he had given the 2,158-page "Fountainhead"
manuscript to the Library of Congress. "But I stole the first and
last pages," he added with a laugh. The throwaway line was included
in the lengthy magazine article published Aug. 16, 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Library officials weren't laughing when they read the piece. They
demanded the missing "Fountainhead" pages, claiming them to be
property of the U.S. government.</TE>
<TE>   When Peikoff refused to turn them over, officials threatened to
sue him for $1.1 million--the amount the library had spent "in
storing, archiving and preserving the manuscript" in the belief it
was the complete original.</TE>
<TE>   Peikoff scoffed at the claim. If library officials had even looked
at the documents, they would have noticed the obviously photocopied
pages and the appraiser's report, he said.</TE>
<TE>   After he hired a lawyer, library officials offered to let Peikoff
temporarily keep the two pages, provided that he post a $30,000 bond
and place a sign on his home's wall beneath the frame reading: "On
Loan From the Library of Congress." He declined.</TE>
<TE>   His lawyer told Peikoff that he probably would win the lawsuit,
but warned that the outcome was far from certain under the theory of
"promissory estoppel" that courts often use in cases involving gifts.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm 68 and a heart patient and could not accept the prospect of
being further weakened physically by the stress, and perhaps even
bankrupted in a fight against what is now, it seems, a virtually
omnipotent government," Peikoff said. "I capitulated ... this was the
payment I received from the Library of Congress for my gift."</TE>
<TE>   Library officials denied being heavy-handed. They said Peikoff
signed an "instrument of gift" giving the government ownership of
Rand's papers and a letter confirming that he had sent "the complete
materials."</TE>
<TE>   "The library did not know that Dr. Peikoff had kept two pages of
the manuscript. The library relied on Dr. Peikoff's presentations
that the manuscripts were complete," officials said in a federal
court complaint.</TE>
<TE>   But George Houle, a West Los Angeles rare book expert who traveled
in 1991 to Washington to appraise Peikoff's donation, said he
informed officials that two of the "Fountainhead" pages were
photocopies.</TE>
<TE>   "The appraisal made note of the fact they were facsimiles," Houle
said. "His remark about 'stealing' them was clearly flippant. He
didn't go to the Library of Congress and steal them."</TE>
<TE>   Houle said he was surprised by the library's treatment of the Rand
papers during his inspection trip. "The librarian had them in a
cardboard box. She almost spit on them. She was not a fan of Ayn
Rand. She made some disparaging remarks about Ayn Rand," Houle said.</TE>
<TE>   Library of Congress spokeswoman Helen Dalrymple denied that the
librarian mistreated the Rand materials or looked upon them with
disdain. The library had sought Rand's papers for years, Dalrymple
said. And Houle did not tell her colleagues of the photocopies, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Dalrymple asserted that Peikoff's treatment of the two pages he
withheld was not the best, however.</TE>
<TE>   "From being in the frame the ink had faded and the paper had
turned a different color," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Peikoff, meantime, vowed to never again give anything to the
Library of Congress. And he said he has given up on ever seeing his
beloved manuscript pages again.</TE>
<TE>   At his desk beneath the empty picture frame he is writing a book
on the relationship of philosophy and physics.</TE>
<TE>   The book will include a discussion of the principle of "inductive
proof" in physics. And maybe a chapter on a more inexact science: the
physics of give and take.</TE>

<HD>Baca and Parks a Study in Contrasts</HD>
<DH>Policing: The county sheriff has sought to revolutionize
his agency as the embattled LAPD chief has been trying to perfect
his.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The jobs of Los Angeles' two top cops are on the line, with the
future of one to be determined by voters in the county and the other
by the political machinery of the city.</LD>
<LD>   They are two men who share similar backgrounds but who couldn't be
more different in their styles and approaches to their jobs.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca is up for reelection today,
challenged by two sergeants: Patrick Gomez and John Stites. Los
Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks' bid for another five-year term
is under review by the civilian police commission. Baca's reelection
appears likely while Parks' reappointment--opposed by the mayor--is
far from certain.</LD>
<TE>   Both have spent their professional lives in the institutions they
now lead, though Baca ended up seeking to revolutionize his
department while Parks wants to perfect his.</TE>
<TE>   "If you could put them together in one person, you would have a
very powerful chief of police," said county Supervisor Zev
Yaroslavsky, who is close to both men.</TE>
<TE>   They grew up in Los Angeles, and have followed similar career
paths. Baca, 59, a Latino, has spent 36 years rising through the
ranks of the Sheriff's Department; Parks, also 59, an African
American, has spent 35 years in the LAPD. They are deeply loyal to
their respective organizations; only Baca is known to have flirted
seriously with leaving, twice becoming a finalist to lead the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   That's about where the parallels end.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Parks, Baca was not considered a department insider. He
never became a member of the late Sheriff Sherman Block's inner
circle, despite a series of promotions.</TE>
<TE>   When he became sheriff four years ago, Baca arrived with a
constant stream of ideas. His top staff has scrambled to keep up, and
many deputies have chafed at his unorthodox approach to policing.</TE>
<TE>   He launched a massive internal review of the organization that
could cost millions of dollars to implement. He created a civilian
board of civil rights attorneys to oversee internal affairs
investigations. He opened a jail for drug and domestic violence
offenders and, most recently, he has talked about creating a homeless
shelter near skid row.</TE>
<TE>   He has been described as a social worker who wears a law
enforcement uniform.</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff has become the unlikely darling of the civil rights
community--Connie Rice, a noted civil rights attorney, is a campaign
advisor--and he has developed strong ties to Democratic as well as
Republican legislators.</TE>
<TE>   He turns to outsiders for advice, help, even criticism. He doesn't
seem to have much interest in the nuts and bolts of law enforcement;
his eyes appear to glaze when asked about patrol and discipline.</TE>
<TE>   "Baca, I think, is way ahead of his time," Rice said. "He gets it
that police can't do everything by themselves."</TE>
<TE>   But many of his deputies say the sheriff has run too far afield.
They, like his challengers Gomez and Stites, believe he is spending
too much time and money on non-traditional law enforcement programs.
They think the sheriff has lost sight of the main duties of the
department: arresting criminals and keeping them behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Baca says he firmly believes the sheriff's job is
more complicated than that. His department, which oversees the
largest jail system in the country, has more than 6,500 deputies.
Forty-one cities contract for its services.</TE>
<TE>   Change is imperative, Baca said, because the Sheriff's Department
needs to keep up with a changing society.</TE>
<TE>   "Innovation needs to be fostered so people are not afraid to make
the right changes," Baca said. "I'm fairly aggressive in making sure
the bureaucracy doesn't inhibit solutions."</TE>
<TE>   Baca talks about "harmony" in the department, but he admits that
he is an idealist. Deputies need to embrace new ways of doing things,
said the sheriff, who sometimes uses religious terms to talk about
the department.</TE>
<TE>   It's enough to make some deputies--rookie and veteran alike--say
he is an embarrassment who is out of sync with the rest of the
department.</TE>
<TE>   Baca was not endorsed by either deputies union. The Assn. for Los
Angeles Deputy Sheriffs backed Gomez, and the Los Angeles County
Peace Officers Assn. supported Stites.</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff has done little political campaigning of his own,
airing just one radio ad and sending slate mailers with many other
candidates. His political consultant, who typically handles liberal
Democrats, says that Baca is surprisingly well known in the county
and that there was no need to introduce him to voters.</TE>
<TE>   If Baca's campaign has been low-key, Parks' is in high gear.
Supporters of the chief came out in force last week denouncing Mayor
James K. Hahn's opposition to a second term for Parks.</TE>
<TE>   The chief said in an interview that he is not conducting any kind
of public campaign to keep his position. Rather, he said, community
activists are independently taking up his cause while he is just
doing his job.</TE>
<TE>   "People say I'm out more, that I'm holding more press
conferences," Parks said. "Only the people who don't know what I do
regularly are saying that.... I have the same pace I've had for the
last five years. The only difference is that the media seem to want
to find me more than they did three or four years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Where Baca is seen as being open to outside opinions, Parks is
viewed by some observers as rigid and closed to other viewpoints. He
rose through the LAPD ranks as the consummate insider.</TE>
<TE>   He was ambitious and eager to lead. Parks has an intense grasp on
the details of his department, the nation's second-largest.</TE>
<TE>   Though he refuses to use the word "reform," he is in fact remaking
the department. He is a strong believer in the complaint process, and
as a result, he is disciplining scores of officers. There are nearly
6,000 complaints filed a year against the department's 9,000-member
force.</TE>
<TE>   "I have seen how internally that word is offensive," Parks said.
"You're saying what you stood for in the past is now no good....
Don't use the terminology that makes the activists happy."</TE>
<TE>   Under Parks, the LAPD has dealt with a corruption scandal, a
court-ordered list of reforms and recruitment troubles. But the
department also was widely praised for its handling of the Democratic
National Convention in 2000, and Parks instituted a crime-fighting
program that relies on statistics similar to a groundbreaking model
used in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The chief, who faces strong opposition from the police union,
loves the nuts and bolts of police work. He talks about operational
efficiency, how the mechanism works, charter provisions. By his own
admission, he doesn't always appear warm and cuddly.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Yaroslavsky suggested that some of the differences
between Baca and Parks stem from the fact that one is elected and one
is appointed. Parks is a product of the civil service system, where
public relations is much less important than mastering the internal
details of the organization, Yaroslavsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, he said, "Parks has done quite a bit to reform [the LAPD],
but he gets tagged with the image of being intransigent and
stubborn."</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky and other observers of both agencies say Parks is an

<HD>High Court Upholds County, City Fees on Hotel Conversions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Property owners who want to convert residential hotels to hotels for
tourists can be required to provide replacement housing for the poor
or money to build it, the California Supreme Court ruled Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The 4-3 ruling allows California cities and counties to pass
regulations that require groups of owners to mitigate the impact
caused by changes to their property. Hundreds of cities and counties,
including Los Angeles, now impose such development fees.</LD>
<LD>   In an opinion written by Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar, the
court upheld mitigation fees enacted by city councils and other
legislative bodies if they are applied generally and without
discrimination to a class of property owners.</LD>
<TE>   "It is the detrimental effects of a change in the use of property
that motivates the regulation," Werdegar wrote. "A use not in itself
noxious or harmful, such as the operation of a tourist hotel, may
nonetheless call for mitigation."</TE>
<TE>   The state high court reviewed a San Francisco law that requires
owners of residential hotels to pay a fee to a special city real
estate fund to convert to a tourist hotel or to set aside guest rooms
for low-income residents.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters likened San Francisco's law to the fees that many
cities require developers to pay to cover the costs associated with
growth. Opponents, by contrast, said San Francisco's law was an
attempt to hold hotel owners' property for ransom.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas and Robert Field, owners of the San Remo Hotel in San
Francisco, paid a $567,000 conversion fee under protest to San
Francisco when they turned their 62-room building into an all-tourist
inn several years ago. The owners then sued San Francisco, contending
that the law was unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   The court majority said the law affected 500 residential hotels in
the city, a sizable class, and was intended not to raise general
revenues but to ensure a continuing supply of low-income housing.</TE>
<TE>   "A burden placed broadly and nondiscriminatorily on changes in
property's use is not the equivalent of an arbitrary decision to hold
an individual's property for ransom," Werdegar wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Marvin Baxter, joined by Justice Ming W. Chin, partially
dissented from the ruling. They differed with much of the majority's
analysis and argued that the case should have been sent back to a
lower court to determine whether San Francisco's law complied with
legal requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Janice Rogers Brown, in a withering dissent, contended
that the San Francisco ordinance represented a "taking" of private
property by the government.</TE>
<TE>   "Theft is theft even when the government approves of the
thievery," Brown wrote. "Turning a democracy into a kleptocracy does
not enhance the stature of the thieves; it only diminishes the
legitimacy of the government."</TE>
<TE>   Brown complained that the decision means that property rights in
California are now "hollow."</TE>
<TE>   "The right to express one's individuality and essential human
dignity through the free use of property is just as important as the
right to do so through speech, the press or the free exercise of
religion," she wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's ruling ensures that local and state governments can
continue to use development impact fees widely, said San Francisco
City Atty. Dennis Herrera.</TE>
<TE>   "These fees provide a crucial source of funding for
infrastructure, such as streets, water and schools, and are used to
reduce the environmental impacts of real estate projects."</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco Deputy City Atty. Andrew W. Schwartz, who argued
before the state high court, said property owners who want to
challenge mitigation fees such as San Francisco's now will have to
prove that they are arbitrary.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Zacks, an attorney for the hotel, complained that the
ruling in San Remo Hotel vs. City and County of San Francisco,
SO91757, makes it "virtually impossible for property owners to win."</TE>
<TE>   He said the hotel owners will take their case to federal district
court to argue that the law violates the U.S. Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   Pedro Echeverria, chief assistant city attorney for Los Angeles,
said the court appears to have given cities flexibility to address
the impact of development. He said Los Angeles has a traffic
mitigation fee imposed on development that leads to increased
traffic. Monday's ruling gives the city a "greater degree of
comfort."</TE>

<HD>Grenade in Luggage at LAX Delays Travelers</HD>
<DH>Flying: The inert device found early Monday slows incoming
and outgoing flights; 6,000 people are evacuated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An inert military-style hand grenade in a passenger's luggage
prompted police at Los Angeles International Airport to evacuate
portions of two terminals, close the upper-level roadway and delay
hundreds of flights Monday morning.</LD>
<LD>   Federal security employees in Terminal 3 discovered the grenade
around 6 a.m. in a cardboard box packed inside the suitcase of an
Alaska Airlines passenger bound for Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   The bag was passed through a bomb-detection device after a
passenger profiling computer singled out its owner as suspicious. The
machine showed the clear outline of the grenade, packed next to a
paint can.</LD>
<TE>   Some 6,000 people were evacuated from Terminals 2 and 3 at the
airport for more than three hours, as a bomb squad robot removed the
suspicious package from the bomb-detection machine.</TE>
<TE>   Some 200 flights were slowed by the incident, with incoming planes
asked to delay their landings and outgoing flights held on the
ground.</TE>
<TE>   The evacuation was the sixth time in a week that terminals have
been emptied at the world's third largest airport due to a suspicious
item or other security snafu, including an unplugged metal detector
last Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The incident comes less than a month after the new federal
Transportation Security Administration assumed responsibility for
screening at 429 commercial airports.</TE>
<TE>   Some security experts think the alert on the benign device is an
indication of things to come: Only a handful of the
explosive-detection machines are currently in operation at LAX. But
more than 200 are expected to be installed once the full security
system is in place.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn and other officials said they were pleased
that the screening system detected the suspicious device, proving
that heightened security measures are working.</TE>
<TE>   Jane Garvey, administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration,
was visiting LAX on Monday. She said she is working with new federal
security officials to study how such incidents can be made less
disruptive.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities described the owner of the suspicious package only as
a man in his 30s. He told investigators that he had no idea the
hollowed out grenade was in his bag and that his brother had packed
it.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI detained the man for questioning, but refused to release
any other details after the U.S. attorney's office determined that he
had not violated any laws.</TE>
<TE>   Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office, said the
"outer shell or husk" of a grenade cannot be considered an explosive
or destructive device under the law.</TE>
<TE>   But federal security officials said the man will probably face
civil charges. They added that they have not determined the specific
charges he could face, and that a cash penalty is possible.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Police Department Cmdr. Gary Brennan described the
device spotted by the machine as "an exact military replica of a
grenade, capable of being rendered into an explosive device."</TE>
<TE>   Members of the LAPD bomb squad were so concerned that they took
the unusual precaution of sending a robot to the scene to move the
suspicious package to an enclosed trailer. An ambulance and a
firetruck were also dispatched to the airport's upper-level roadway.</TE>
<TE>   The trailer containing the grenade was then driven to a taxiway
and taken to the remote west side of the airfield, closest to the
ocean. After shutting down two runways for the operation, officials
determined that the device was not explosive.</TE>
<TE>   The thousands of evacuated passengers spent hours standing in the
bright early morning sun, waiting to be allowed back into Terminals 2
and 3. The evacuation delayed 200 flights and forced the cancellation
of five others.</TE>
<TE>   During the incident, traffic diverted from the upper-level roadway
backed up traffic for blocks on roads leading to the airport.</TE>
<TE>   Security evacuations have become so commonplace at LAX that most
draw little comment from LAX administrators. But Monday's incident
was considered serious enough that airport executives called a news
conference.</TE>
<TE>   "The good news is that LAX continues to have a high level of
security," Hahn said. "The suspect was immediately apprehended
without incident. Our safety and security measures are working."</TE>
<TE>   City officials apologized for the inconvenience to passengers, but
added that the traveling public should be forewarned that they should
not try to take suspicious devices onto aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   "It defies belief that someone would have a hand grenade, whether
it's inert or not, in baggage that's going to go on an airplane,"
Hahn said. "A strong message should be sent to someone as thoughtless
as this."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the evacuation created a now familiar tableau at LAX.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of passengers waited for hours for word about their
flights. Some sat reading books on benches between the terminals on
the lower level. The Starbucks in the lower level of Terminal 2 ran
out of pastries.</TE>
<TE>   Word spread quickly among the stranded passengers that there might
have been a bomb in a passenger's luggage. But most said they would
continue with their trips.</TE>
<TE>   "You gotta do what you gotta do," said Gary Sanders, 40, an
assistant manager at a Toyota dealership. "I'm getting on that
plane."</TE>
<TE>   Sanders was waiting with golf-club-toting friends in a long,
disorganized line on the upper-level roadway, still hoping to board a
flight to Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of his fellow travelers searched for the right line and
tried to navigate overloaded luggage carts on crowded sidewalks.</TE>
<TE>   Others said the incident would not keep them from flying in the
future. "I fly for business a lot," said Ken Haz, an Alberta, Canada,
resident who was in town to test telecommunications equipment. "This
is one of those things."</TE>

<HD>Mahony Won't Say if Police Got Priests' Names</HD>
<DH>Crime: A spokesman says only that cardinal stands by his
pledge to report alleged molesters. Authorities have heard nothing
from him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY B. STAMMER and RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cardinal Roger M. Mahony's office refused to say Monday whether he
has given authorities the names of as many as a dozen priests alleged
to have sexually abused children.</LD>
<LD>   Mahony dismissed the priests in private meetings in the last two
weeks over allegations of abuse from as long as a decade ago, church
sources said. The dismissals come as the Roman Catholic Church in the
United States is again reeling from disclosures of sexual abuse by
priests in Dallas, Boston, Philadelphia and St. Louis.</LD>
<LD>   Mahony's spokesman, Tod Tamberg, said the cardinal stands by his
Feb. 21 pastoral statement, agreeing to abide by a California law
mandating that priests, counselors, nurses and teachers report sexual
abuse of minors to police.</LD>
<TE>   "He's a mandated reporter as well," Tamberg said of Mahony,
archbishop of the nation's largest Roman Catholic diocese.</TE>
<TE>   But as of Monday, the Los Angeles Police Department, the Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department, as well as sheriff's departments
in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, said they had received no such
referrals from the Los Angeles archdiocese, which covers the three
counties.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley said Monday that the
reporting law is clear.</TE>
<TE>   "Under the penal code there is a duty to report within 36 hours of
a specific incident of molestation. Among the reporters are clergy,
except in the case of penitential communications [confidential
confessions]," he said. "Priests are definitely mandated reporters
unless it is a confessional."</TE>
<TE>   Failure to report such crimes is a misdemeanor.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no clergy exception," Cooley said. "If and when police
agencies do a thorough and appropriate investigation, those cases
will be prosecuted like any other."</TE>
<TE>   The head of Cooley's sex crimes unit said it has no open cases
stemming from church referrals.</TE>
<TE>   The law took effect in 1987 in the wake of the McMartin preschool
scandal. Its reporting requirements apply to any cases of abuse that
church officials became aware of after the law took effect. It is
unclear, however, whether the alleged incidents of abuse involving
the priests occurred before or after that time.</TE>
<TE>   Tamberg would not say whether the names of the recently dismissed
priests had been given to local police. "I've been told what I can
say," he said. "I have no information on priest personnel matters."</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles have
previously acknowledged that church officials received six child
molestation complaints in the last five years, including four
involving adults complaining of past misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, there were about 50 cases of sexual misbehavior reported
to the archdiocese in the last five years, diocesan attorney John P.
McNicholas of Los Angeles wrote in a letter to an expert witness in a
case late last year. Not all of the cases were believed to involve
children.</TE>
<TE>   Church sources said the priests recently dismissed by Mahony for
allegations of sexual abuse of minors had received psychological
counseling and were believed to have been rehabilitated. The
archdiocese declined Monday to confirm or deny the dismissals.</TE>
<TE>   One church source, however, said generous severance pay was
offered to the departing priests. Any of the priests living in parish
rectories or other church facilities were asked to move out, the
source said.</TE>
<TE>   Left unanswered was why Mahony was taking action now. The
archdiocese's sexual abuse policy dates to 1988. It says the church
will "never deal with a problem of sexual abuse on the part of a
priest or deacon by simply moving him to another ministerial
assignment."</TE>
<TE>   Tamberg said Mahony was committed to obeying the law and
protecting the children of the nation's largest Catholic archdiocese.
In view of renewed reports of child sexual abuse across the nation,
Tamberg said, Mahony felt compelled last month to issue a pastoral
message.</TE>
<TE>   "[The pastoral letter] was motivated by the cardinal's pastoral
concern for Catholic faithful in the archdiocese, that they know we
have comprehensive policies and procedures, that we review them
regularly and that they are protecting their kids from sexual
misconduct from anyone that ministers in the archdiocese, either
clergy or laity," Tamberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony's full message is on the archdiocese's Web site:
www.la-archdiocese.org/english/</TE>
<TE>   Catholic bishops in the United States have been dealing with these
controversies for years. But the magnitude of new disclosures has
sent a tremor through the national church, prompting bishops across
the country to dismiss sexual predators while seeking to reassure the
faithful.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston disclosed to police the
names of 80 priests who had been accused of abusing children over the
last 40 years. The revelation followed a child molestation trial in
which a defrocked priest, John J. Geoghan, was convicted. He is also
awaiting trial in at least two other cases.</TE>
<TE>   Last year the Los Angeles and Orange dioceses paid $5.2 million to
settle molestation allegations by a former high school student
against a priest. The court settlement requires the dioceses to fire
priests known to be molesters.</TE>
<TE>   In Dallas in 1997, a jury awarded $119 million to 11 men who were
allegedly molested when they were altar boys. The case later was
settled out of court for $23 million.</TE>
<TE>   Bishops and other church officials have said their primary concern
is for their parishioners. Money is also at stake. Cases of child
sexual abuse have cost the church hundreds of millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   While their first concern has been to prevent sexual abuse,
bishops have also sought ways of helping fallen priests, including
therapy. Despite some successes, bishops are reluctant to return
priests to any work involving children. More recently, they are
asking priests to leave the priesthood. Still, some sexual abuse
survivors say the church has not done enough.</TE>
<TE>   David Clohessy of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests
said police, prosecutors and judges are beginning to treat the church
with less deference than in the past.</TE>

<HD>Limits Sought on Airport Delays</HD>
<DH>Security: Mineta says 'compartmentalizing' during alerts
would inconvenience fewer people. Some steps already have been taken.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal officials are seeking ways to limit airport evacuations like
the one that affected thousands of people Monday at Los Angeles
International Airport and an "embarrassing" lapse that shut down half
the airport last week.</LD>
<LD>   Two terminals were cleared on Monday after screeners spotted what
appeared to be a hand grenade in a piece of luggage belonging to a
male passenger.</LD>
<LD>   Just four days earlier, the discovery of an unplugged metal
detector shut down half of LAX and delayed 400 flights and at least
10,000 travelers for nearly four hours. Another unplugged detector
forced a smaller shutdown at Chicago's O'Hare International the same
day.</LD>
<TE>   "This is an embarrassing kind of thing," Transportation Secretary
Norman Y. Mineta said at a news conference Monday.</TE>
<TE>   He said technicians are scrambling to find a way to secure the
electrical plugs. And he pledged to find ways to limit massive
evacuations over minor breaches, which critics have warned could
create unforeseen safety and security problems.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to look at airports and trying to ask, 'What is the
logical way to compartmentalize?'" Mineta said. "Even though an
incident occurs, is there a way to compartmentalize so we don't have
to shut down the whole airport and impact thousands of people?"</TE>
<TE>   Officials have already taken some steps, Mineta said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, airport concourse exits are now covered by two
guards. If someone tries to rush in through the exit, one guard can
chase the intruder while the other makes sure no one else is trying
to get in. That should reduce having to empty out a whole concourse
if someone tries to use the exit to bypass security checkpoints.</TE>
<TE>   Another change involves the Atlanta airport, which was shut down
last year after a man in a hurry to make a flight went the wrong way
on an escalator to get around security lines. Technicians have
reprogrammed the electric trams that take passengers from the
check-in area to their gates so the doors can be sealed, trapping
anyone who tried to get around security.</TE>
<TE>   There are dozens of security incidents each day at the 429
airports that came under federal supervision on Feb. 17. Shutting
down concourses has become more common since Mineta announced a
"zero-tolerance" policy toward security breaches last October. The
Federal Aviation Administration is compiling up-to-date statistics on
numbers of incidents.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, officials confirmed that nine of the 19 Sept. 11
hijackers were singled out for additional security measures the day
of the attacks. But the extra screening--their checked bags were
scanned for explosives--failed to turn up anything suspicious, and
the hijackers were allowed to board, apparently without being
questioned. The information was first reported by the Washington
Post.</TE>
<TE>   Six of the hijackers were flagged by a computerized passenger
screening system, and three others because of irregularities in their
travel documents. If the same situation were to occur today, the
individuals--not just their bags--would be searched, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time, our procedures were based on what our intelligence
community perceived as the threat, and that perceived threat was a
bomb in checked baggage," a federal official said. "The procedures
were followed properly."</TE>
<TE>   Congress is expected to look into the incidents as part of any
investigation into the events of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Transportation Security Administration announced a
campaign to recruit 30,000 federal security screeners at wages
ranging from $13.35 to nearly $19.60 an hour, depending on
experience, job responsibilities and location. Screeners at LAX
already earn $14 an hour, one of the highest rates in the country.</TE>
<TE>   The Transportation Department is hoping its campaign will result
in a professional work force with much higher standards of vigilance
and service. Javier Gonzalez, a union official working with screeners
at LAX, said the salary range should be attractive in most parts of
the country.</TE>
<TE>   "It's decent," Gonzalez said. "I thought it would be less."</TE>

<HD>They're Counting Down to the Count</HD>
<DH>Voting: O.C. registrar and workers tackle last-minute
tasks, including preparing for a wave of write-in ballots for a
previously uncontested judgeship.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Inside the county's election building, an army of workers and
volunteers reached critical mass Monday, dealing with last-minute
campaign filings and court rulings ahead of today's primary election.</LD>
<LD>   Computers hum. Counting machines are oiled and prepped. Dozens of
employees in guarded rooms have opened thousands of envelopes with
absentee ballots, scanning for rips and tears that could jam a
machine.</LD>
<LD>   "We're going to be ready," said Registrar Rosalyn Lever, who was
thrown a curve last week when a judge ruled that the county's 1,716
precincts must post a notice that a list of write-in candidates is
available upon request.</LD>
<TE>   Secretary of State Bill Jones has estimated a 36% statewide voter
turnout for today. Orange County voters have traditionally surpassed
statewide estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Though local election officials declined to predict turnout, they
said that the county has had 41% turnout in similar primaries.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's ruling in a lawsuit filed by challengers to Judge Ronald
C. Kline, who faces charges of child molestation and possessing child
pornography, resulted in a hectic weekend for Lever and her staff.</TE>
<TE>   The notice had to be drafted, then translated into Vietnamese and
Spanish, and placed into precinct kits to meet a Saturday deadline
for distribution.</TE>
<TE>   Lever said she and her staff worked until 9 p.m. Friday and
returned before 7 a.m. Saturday to coordinate distribution.</TE>
<TE>   According to the ruling, election officials must now display signs
at polling places alerting voters that they can receive a list of
write-in candidates. In addition, the list may be taken into the
voting booth.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling affects all races--there are 11 write-ins for Kline's
seat alone--in which write-ins are candidates but will particularly
favor the challengers opposing Kline since his name is the only one
that will appear on the ballot for his office.</TE>
<TE>   Kline submitted campaign documents for reelection for another
six-year term before charges were filed against him. With the filing
deadline for seeking election past, challengers' only option was as
write-in candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Three other races on the countywide ballot have write-in
candidates: 2nd District supervisorial, lieutenant governor and
governor's race on the Libertarian Party ticket.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for the registrar, the judge's ruling came after 156
precinct kits had been sent.</TE>
<TE>   The kits contain cardboard voting booths, card punch machines and
other essential election materials.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the registrar had to mail the write-in notices via
overnight delivery at a cost of $2,000, said Steve Rodermund, chief
deputy registrar.</TE>
<TE>   Lever usually has 7,000 volunteers working at the precincts. But
the department typically receives about 1,000 cancellations within 30
days of an election and another 300 volunteers cancel less than 24
hours before the polls open.</TE>
<TE>   A new county program sought to enlist an additional 1,700
volunteers from the ranks of county employees by the November
election. So far, only 260 have volunteered for today's election,
Rodermund said.</TE>
<TE>   Election officials prefer four people staffing a precinct, but
because not enough volunteers applied, they will have only three--an
inspector and two clerks--at about 100 precincts.</TE>
<TE>   "But we have a core of 35 county volunteer employees who are
coming in at 6 a.m. and they will probably go to the lower-staffed
precincts," Rodermund said.</TE>
<TE>   The law requires at least three workers per precinct. But
Rodermund said that with an average of 1,000 voters at each precinct,
"it sometimes gets too busy for only three and they can't have time
for lunch and breaks."</TE>

<HD>Sham Phone Calls Seeking to Taint Supervisor Hopeful</HD>
<DH>Election: Purporting to be a Democratic pitch for Norby,
they may cost him GOP votes in his campaign to unseat incumbent Coad,
a fellow Republican.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County Democratic Party said it is not responsible for
phone calls made Monday to Republican voters in north Orange County
touting an erroneous Democratic Party endorsement of supervisor
candidate Chris Norby.</LD>
<LD>   The party cannot endorse Republicans in any race, said Susan
Freeze, assistant to party Chairman Frank Barbaro. Norby, a Fullerton
councilman, and incumbent Cynthia P. Coad are Republicans.</LD>
<LD>   "That's a hold-your-nose vote for Democrats," Freeze said.</LD>
<TE>   Norby's campaign said it was notified by voters in Anaheim,
Placentia and Fullerton about the automated call; one of the
recipients gave the campaign a tape of the message left on his
answering machine.</TE>
<TE>   It begins with a woman's voice saying, "Hi, this is Loretta Gomez
calling from Democratic Party headquarters to ask you to vote for
Chris Norby for county supervisor."</TE>
<TE>   Norby campaign spokesman John Lewis said his camp didn't know who
organized the calls but added that they were clearly meant to hurt
Norby's chances in the tight race for the 4th District. Some
recipients might think the caller is Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D-Garden
Grove), he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If anybody were to believe it's a real phone call, it would cost
Norby Republican votes, and that's clearly what it's designed to do,"
Lewis said.</TE>
<TE>   Coad's campaign said it was unaware of the calls and had no
involvement with them, but said Norby's campaign might be
responsible.</TE>
<TE>   Norby raised similar complaints about phone banks when he ran
unsuccessfully against Richard Ackerman, now a state senator, for an
Assembly seat in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis said he was "amazed" that the Coad campaign would hint that
this was Norby's doing. "It's like saying FDR bombed Pearl Harbor so
he could blame it on the Japanese," Lewis said.</TE>
<TE>   A similar phone bank was investigated after the April 2001 mayoral
race in Los Angeles. Calls from a "Gloria Morina" were traced to
opponents of Antonio Villaraigosa, who lost the election to James K.
Hahn. The caller, mimicking Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria
Molina, alleged to female Democratic voters that Villaraigosa opposed
legislation increasing penalties for rapists and child molesters.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican voter who provided the Norby campaign with the
tape, Marv Wolff of Anaheim, said he realized that the call was a
sham but said other voters might not.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly, a Democrat who endorsed Norby, said voters
should be wary of unsubstantiated last-minute appeals.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's wrong because it's misleading and it underscores
that any injection of partisan politics into these local races is
dangerous," Daly said.</TE>

<HD>A Healing Place for Injured Raptors</HD>
<DH>Ojai: Kim Stroud's mountaintop center gives ailing birds of
prey a second chance to take wing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Sasquatch needs to feel like a bird again, Kim Stroud takes him
to a mountaintop in Ojai where he looks over the valley floor and
feels the breeze beneath his useless wings.</LD>
<LD>   The red-tailed hawk, crippled by a bone disease, will fluff his
feathers and lean into the wind.</LD>
<LD>   "He feels like he's flying," said Stroud, director of the Ojai
Raptor Center in Oak View. "We try and offer the birds a good quality
of life here."</LD>
<TE>   Stroud rehabilitates injured birds of prey. They include hawks,
eagles, owls, falcons and an occasional heron or duck.</TE>
<TE>   For those beyond repair, she offers the raptor equivalent of a
convalescent home.</TE>
<TE>   Stroud, 45, who started the center two years ago, says it's the
only place between Los Angeles and Santa Maria specializing in
raptors.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always been drawn to raptors," she said, looking into the
deep yellow eyes of a Harris hawk on her arm. "They are majestic and
beautiful. It satisfies a longing in my soul, and it's an honor to
take care of them."</TE>
<TE>   But raptors, she cautions, aren't pets. In fact, they don't like
people. Joker, a half-blind black-crowned night heron, will jab his
dagger-like beak at the eyes of anyone who gets too close.</TE>
<TE>   And the bald and golden eagles can crush human bones with their
sharp yellow talons.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people want warm and fuzzy pets," Stroud said.</TE>
<TE>   "These aren't like that. They are wild animals whose motivation is
simply to eat, fly and procreate."</TE>
<TE>   The 20 birds at the center suffer a variety of ailments and
injuries. A golden eagle had a wing shot off. A peregrine falcon,
which can dive at more than 100 mph, lost a wing when it hit a power
line. A Harris hawk slammed into a building while chasing prey.</TE>
<TE>   And then there are birds like the great horned owl named Luna, who
was fed as a baby by humans and can no longer find food on her own or
relate to other birds.</TE>
<TE>   Once released, Luna was later caught trying to pry open the
sliding glass door of a home looking for lunch.</TE>
<TE>   Birds that can be rehabilitated are first taken to a veterinarian.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Matt Bailey of the Matilija Veterinary Hospital in Ojai treats
many of the animals.</TE>
<TE>   If a bird breaks a wing, he performs surgery for a reduced fee and
applies a wing wrap to immobilize it for a few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "Kim takes it from there," Bailey said.</TE>
<TE>   "She gives them the antibiotics, changes the wing wraps and gives
them restricted exercise. If you are the bird found in the backyard
with a broken wing and your choices are either getting thrown in the
garbage or having Kim fix your wing and give you a second chance at
life, then you will think Kim is providing a huge service."</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura County Humane Society often refers people with injured
raptors to Stroud.</TE>
<TE>   "People like Kim are invaluable because we don't have the
resources or skill to deal with wild animals like that," said Tim
Dewar, spokesman for the society.</TE>
<TE>   Being the local raptor expert has its drawbacks. Stroud, who is
helped by a handful of volunteers, is barraged with all sorts of
animal calls.</TE>
<TE>   "People ask me how to get raccoons from their yard," she said.
"One guy called and said seagulls kept attacking his car. A lady
called asking if she should adopt a dingo puppy."</TE>
<TE>   During windy spells, Stroud's phone is constantly ringing.</TE>
<TE>   Herons and owls get blown from their nests and end up in people's
yards.</TE>
<TE>   Last year she took in 70 baby barn owls, 35 baby great-horned
owls, 25 red-tailed hawk chicks and 17 red-shouldered hawk chicks.</TE>
<TE>   Stroud first got involved with birds as a volunteer at a wildlife
rehabilitation center in Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Later, she helped start Wildlife Care of Ventura County before
founding the raptor center.</TE>
<TE>   Stroud was raised in Santa Barbara, where her stepfather would
take in birds hit by cars.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to be a vet for years, but I got married and had kids,"
said Stroud, who works at the Patagonia store in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   As Stroud made her rounds around the center recently, Chloe, a
slim, snail-eating Indian runner duck, joined her. Chloe, whose wing
was chewed off by a dog, waddled behind Stroud like a web-footed
personal assistant.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike the chummy duck, the raptors are aloof. Those who have
been here a while, like Sasquatch and Luna, tolerate Stroud. Others,
like a glaring bald eagle, are skittish.</TE>
<TE>   The birds are fed once a day. The bald eagle gets trout or salmon,
and the others receive rats, quails and day-old chicks called
cockerels.</TE>
<TE>   "I buy 5,000 cockerels at a time," Stroud said.</TE>
<TE>   Stroud depends on private donations to run her half-acre center
and hopes someone will donate 20 acres so the raptors will have more
space.</TE>
<TE>   She also wants to raise $6,000 for two aviaries at the county
humane society to house a bald eagle and golden eagle.</TE>
<TE>   She often does paid presentations at local schools.</TE>
<TE>   During a recent appearance at Thelma Bedell Elementary School in
Santa Paula, Stroud showed owls, falcons, herons and Chloe.</TE>
<TE>   The students were entranced by the owls and enchanted by the duck.</TE>
<TE>   As she wrapped up, Stroud looked at the young faces and furrowed
her brow.</TE>
<TE>   "And remember if you want a pet, get a cockatiel or a parakeet,"
she said. "Not a wild animal."</TE>

<HD>Teenager Takes Initiative to Aid Victims' Families</HD>
<DH>Philanthropy: The 19-year-old raised thousands to benefit
relatives of his colleagues who died Sept. 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZIE ST. JOHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than most, Chris Finefrock felt compelled to do something to
help the victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The teenager who recently lived in the Conejo Valley worked last
summer as an intern at the Los Angeles office of Cantor Fitzgerald,
an institutional bond trading firm that had extensive offices in the
World Trade Center's north tower. The firm lost about 700 of its
1,000 employees.</LD>
<LD>   "When I first heard about the planes crashing, I had this surreal
feeling. I thought everyone would be OK if they got to the top of the
building and helicopters could rescue them," said the 19-year-old,
who had traveled to New York just weeks before the attacks to meet
some of his East Coast colleagues.</LD>
<TE>   With the Wall Street firm suffering such an incomprehensible loss,
Finefrock, who worked as the regional manager's personal assistant,
went back to the Los Angeles office to help out after Sept. 11,
before his morning classes at Loyola Marymount University and during
school breaks.</TE>
<TE>   "Being in the office, hearing these sad stories of the families, I
just wanted to help fill that void in any way I could," said
Finefrock, who is completing his freshman year as a business major.</TE>
<TE>   Upon hearing that the firm had set up the Cantor Fitzgerald
Foundation to provide assistance to victims' families, Finefrock
asked his family and neighbors to contribute.</TE>
<TE>   His idea was to place American flags for cars on the doorsteps of
hundreds of residents in Thousand Oaks, Westlake and Agoura. Along
with each flag he left a letter explaining his connection to the
World Trade Center events and asked that a donation be made to the
Cantor Fitzgerald Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Finefrock's parents, Peggy and Gary, put up about $5,000 to buy
the car flags at $7.50 each. In his letters, he requested only that
the donation cover the price of the flag.</TE>
<TE>   When he returned to the homes to collect the donations, Finefrock
was overwhelmed.</TE>
<TE>   "There were donations of $10, $20, $100 and $1,000. I have some
very generous people in my community," said Finefrock, adding that
fewer than a dozen people declined to contribute.</TE>
<TE>   When added to collections that his older twin brothers took up at
their offices, the donations totaled more than $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   "One day he walks into the office with checks--a whole lot of
checks--and I really couldn't believe it," said Bill Rice, manager of
Cantor Fitzgerald's Los Angeles office. "A lot of people all over the
country have made donations, but Chris' situation is somewhat unique,
because he had the gumption to do this at such a young age. He's
devoted, dedicated and a very innovative young man."</TE>
<TE>   Finefrock's charitable spirit has not gone unrecognized. He's in
New York today to receive an award from the editors of Teen People
magazine, who selected the former Lake Sherwood resident as one of
"20 Teens Who Will Change the World." This is the fourth year the
magazine has done a nationwide search for teenagers who are making a
difference.</TE>
<TE>   Executive Editor Kristina Johnson said the magazine felt strongly
that Sept. 11 needed to be addressed this year, and Finefrock, who
now lives in Marina del Rey, filled that need.</TE>
<TE>   "In Chris' case, we were really looking for a World Trade Center
focus. His connection to Cantor Fitzgerald is obvious, but it's even
nicer that he wasn't from New York but still had that connection,"
Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Finefrock and the other 19 recipients will each receive
scholarships worth $1,000 underwritten by cosmetics giant L'Oreal.
The magazine provided transportation and accommodations for the teens
and one guest each. Finefrock's father accompanied him on the trip.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many negative stories about kids in the news. Our
readers love stories about teens that are uplifting," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   While in New York, Finefrock plans to spend a couple of days
helping out in Cantor Fitzgerald's relocated offices in lower
Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   "Chris is just amazing. He has a true level of interest, he
understands the economics of the world, and on top of that he's just
a normal kid," Rice said.</TE>

<HD>Students Tackle 'Crisis'</HD>
<DH>Ventura: Foothill High begins a 10-week exercise in
managing a mock national health emergency.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA LEFF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Students at Ventura's Foothill High School got the bad news first:
The U.S. faces a mysterious viral epidemic so severe it threatens
millions from Boston to San Francisco. The president wants the
nation's finest scientific minds to devise a plan for avoiding
widespread panic and death.</LD>
<LD>   That was the scenario presented to 10th-graders Monday during a
surprise assembly featuring a phony emergency news bulletin, chaotic
scenes from the Dustin Hoffman movie "Outbreak," and a visit from a
somber presidential impersonator flanked by pretend Secret Service
agents.</LD>
<LD>   The elaborate production kicked off a 10-week interdisciplinary
study of infectious diseases for Foothill's 180 sophomores. Although
students knew they would have a classwide research project this
spring, the details were secret.</LD>
<TE>   "We planned it as a total simulation and a complete surprise,"
said biology teacher Wendi Butler, chairwoman of Foothill's science
department. "You want them to buy into the project and be excited
about it, so creating memorable experiences and making them as
realistic as possible is a hook."</TE>
<TE>   The dramatics started when the sophomores were summoned from their
third-period classes at 9:40 a.m. by an ominous announcement over the
public address system: "Attention all 10th-grade students. Your
presence is required in Spirito Hall. Please stop whatever you are
doing and immediately exit your class. This is not a drill."</TE>
<TE>   Once they were in the school auditorium, a videotaped image of
geometry teacher Spencer Kellogg, posing as a network news anchor,
appeared for a five-minute mock emergency broadcast interlaced with
images from "Outbreak." Kellogg described mass hospitalizations in
five U.S. cities, quarantines enforced by the National Guard and a
rising death toll.</TE>
<TE>   Students hadn't finished digesting that information when another
teacher took the microphone to announce the arrival of President
George W. Bartlett--played by Don Austin, the school district's
lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "This enemy has killed more innocent people than Hitler or Osama
bin Laden. America is under attack from a biological weapon. Your
input and recommendations are crucial to the defeat of this heinous
enemy," Austin said before he was escorted out by students wearing
suits and dark sunglasses.</TE>
<TE>   The illusion was maintained as sophomores divided into work groups
to receive their sealed "presidential commissions." Each group was
assigned a disease, ranging from AIDS, influenza and the Ebola virus
to anthrax, meningitis and bubonic plague.</TE>
<TE>   During the next two months, students will assume the role of
scientific advisors and be required to prepare taped public service
announcements, develop Web sites on the history and social
implications of their disease, and write position papers advising the
president on how to deal with the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Infectious diseases will be studied in science, English and
history courses. In May, each work group will present its findings to
a panel that includes representatives from the county public health
department and local doctors.</TE>
<TE>   While keeping such an orchestrated event secret seems almost
impossible, many students had no inkling what their teachers had
planned. Some, assuming something was really wrong, were relieved.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of scary when they had the voice coming into our
classroom. I thought something big was happening, something having to
do with the country," 16-year-old Brandon Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, students said they appreciated their teachers' efforts to
engage them. "It was totally cheesy, but I loved it anyway," said
Chandler Christensen, 15.</TE>

<HD>Hospitals to Split $900,000 in Tobacco Funds</HD>
<DH>Health care: Seven county facilities would each get $90,000
for seismic retrofitting, with the remainder for uninsured patient
costs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County's private and nonprofit hospitals are planning to use
their $900,000 share of tobacco settlement money to pay for seismic
retrofits on aging facilities and to help cover the cost of providing
health care to uninsured patients.</LD>
<LD>   Under an agreement that the Board of Supervisors is expected to
approve today, each of the seven hospitals would receive up to
$90,000 for securing boilers, ventilation equipment and other
fixtures that could come crashing down during an earthquake.</LD>
<LD>   The hospitals are also entitled to recoup the costs of treating
uninsured patients who arrive in emergency rooms.</LD>
<TE>   Total compensation available to each hospital varies, from
$163,000 for St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard to $98,000
for Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Distribution amounts are higher in hospitals that historically
serve more poor patients and therefore have higher costs that are not
reimbursed, said county spokeswoman Norma Camacho. Santa Paula
Memorial Hospital is eligible for up to $135,000; St. John's Pleasant
Valley in Camarillo, $136,000; Community Memorial in Ventura,
$135,000; Simi Valley Hospital, $123,000; and Ojai Valley Community,
$98,000.</TE>
<TE>   An advisory committee agreed to provide each hospital with $90,000
for seismic retrofit work because hospital administrators have said
it is a pressing need, Camacho said.</TE>
<TE>   Hospitals are under the gun to meet a series of deadlines imposed
by the state for upgrading facilities to withstand a major
earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   The first deadline--for bolting down dangerous equipment--was in
December. It cost $172,000 to complete that work at St. John's
Pleasant Valley Hospital in Camarillo, said Mike Murray, the
hospital's administrator.</TE>
<TE>   But St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard, also owned by
Catholic Healthcare West, spent nothing on upgrades because the
facilities were built with the safety measure in place, Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, money is needed to prepare for a second round of more
costly structural improvements that must be completed by 2008, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   He estimates it will cost $16 million to upgrade the Camarillo
hospital alone.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got some major funding challenges down the road," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If hospitals don't spend all of the $90,000 on seismic retrofits,
they can use the rest to help provide medical treatment to patients
who cannot pay, Camacho said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the reimbursement rates are generally lower than those
paid by Medi-Cal and Medicare, hospital administrators say they will
jump at the chance to get at least some of their uninsured costs
covered.</TE>
<TE>   "There is clearly a need for any help we can get," said Mark
Gregson, chief executive officer of Santa Paula Memorial Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "Health care revenue is not keeping pace with health care costs,
and that's particularly true for small hospitals. We are still in a
precarious position."</TE>
<TE>   Murray said the St. John's hospital in Oxnard logged 45,000 visits
to the emergency room last year--and that number is expected to grow.
Meanwhile, more people are uninsured because they have lost a job in
the nation's unsettled economy, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The amount available to do true charity care becomes more of a
pressure," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't turn people way. It's our responsibility to serve them
and it's part of our mission. So any additional assistance we can get
from the county, it's needed and appropriate," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The money flows from county government's $10-million annual share
of the states' lawsuit settlement with major tobacco manufacturers.</TE>

<LD>Neighbors who live near the Valaika family in Valencia never panic if
their car alarms go off.</LD>
<LD>   They have come to realize it's one of the Valaika boys at play.</LD>
<LD>   With each changing season, neighbors inquire, "What sports are you
into," so they're ready for any flying objects that may be headed
their way.</LD>
<TE>   Baseballs are the No. 1 choice for the four brothers, all of whom
are shortstops.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everything in the house has been broken once--picture
frames, lamps, vases," their mother, Ilona, said.</TE>
<TE>   Added father Jeff: "They do a lot of ground balls in the living
room, fly balls in the kitchen."</TE>
<TE>   Chris Valaika of Newhall Hart High is no longer the ringleader of
neighborhood games. He has become one of the best junior infielders
in Southern California, a projected top college prospect for 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't make the U.S. junior national team and win the gold
medal unless you're pretty good," Hart Coach Jim Ozella said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's out there every day getting better. His work ethic is
unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   He's the big brother to four siblings, all of whom are
athletically inclined.</TE>
<TE>   There's Matt, 13; sister Briana, 11; Patrick, 9; and Nicky, 6.</TE>
<TE>   The children are involved in so many practices and athletic
competitions that their mother has a color-coded, industrial-sized
calendar hanging on a wall near the kitchen to keep track of
everyone's schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "She's the drill sergeant of the family," Chris said.</TE>
<TE>   Ilona was in charge of Hart's snack bar last season and recruited
her children to help.</TE>
<TE>   They'd step out of the family van carrying sodas, candy and hot
dog buns.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like watching the mother duck and the ducklings," Ozella
said.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Valaika served in the booster club and helped put together
plans that culminated in the building of new dugouts for Hart's
baseball field.</TE>
<TE>   The dugouts cost $50,000, all of which was donated by community
members.</TE>
<TE>   Chris, a 6-foot, 170-pound 16-year-old, is setting impressive
standards for what's expected of an older brother.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't complain about having to share his bedroom with Matt
and Patrick, even when the two brothers put their ears against the
door and try to eavesdrop on phone conversations with his girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   He cherishes his moments of playing hide-and-seek with Nicky, even
when Nicky falls asleep under a table or in a closet.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't mind serving as the boys' personal hitting coach or
driving them to practices when his mother and father are too busy. No
one told him he had to be a role model for his siblings--he just is.</TE>
<TE>   "Chris is nice to everybody," Matt said.</TE>
<TE>   Added Chris: "I have pressure to keep my cool and set a positive
example. Whenever they need anything, they can come to my room and
ask. I like helping them out whenever I can. Nicky is the one always
around me. He comes into my room, hangs out, tries to mirror
everything I do. I say something, and he says it for a week."</TE>
<TE>   Matt and Briana also play soccer, but baseball is the sport on
which the family thrives, mostly because of Chris' success.</TE>
<TE>   He batted .411 with 10 doubles as a sophomore last season, when
Hart finished 26-2.</TE>
<TE>   He has become the leadoff hitter on this year's team that is 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   During the summer, he was voted the top second baseman at the
World Youth Championships in Veracruz, Mexico. His skills and
confidence keep building.</TE>
<TE>   "I know now if I work hard enough, anything is possible," he said.
"I knew I was decent, but didn't know how good I could be. It's
inspired me to keep getting better."</TE>
<TE>   Nicky doesn't want Chris to go too far away for college, so the
6-year-old has already suggested a school close to home--College of
the Canyons.</TE>
<TE>   Matt isn't concerned about Chris leaving because he wants his
share of the bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   Mom knows the truth about the brothers' relationship.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a special bond," Ilona said.</TE>
<TE>   "Chris kind of knows anything he does they emulate."</TE>
<TE>   When Matt, Patrick and Nicky started walking on the baseball field
to take a photo with Chris a couple weeks ago, Ozella shouted, "Here
come the Valaikas."</TE>
<TE>   Teammates started teasing Chris. Most older brothers would have
been embarrassed.</TE>
<TE>   Not Chris.</TE>
<TE>   There was pride in his face. He knows there will be Valaikas
playing baseball for Hart through 2014, and he's showing the way for
his younger brothers.</TE>

<HD>Media Diversity Worth a Question</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As usual, the whole Nolan Richardson saga that played out over the
past week focused too much on Nolan Richardson.</LD>
<LD>   It's always that way with him. Too much attention on the
individual and his words, not enough about the larger issues he
raises.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe in that rant that ultimately led to the end of his stay as
Arkansas' basketball coach he had a valid point.</LD>
<TE>   Maybe the media passed on it because it hits too close to home.
The lack of diversity in the media is a serious problem, and one
that's almost always part of the story.</TE>
<TE>   Did he have to remark on the racial composition of the reporters
covering his team as a response to the criticism he faced?</TE>
<TE>   There's never a bad time or a good time for unpleasant facts.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps a black reporter or two on the beat would not have
prevented the heat for this mediocre season, but it definitely would
have kept him from saying this line at his news conference last
Monday: "When I look at all of you people in this room, I see no one
look like me, talk like me or act like me. Now, why don't you
recruit? Why don't the editors recruit like I'm recruiting?"</TE>
<TE>   To him, something felt unfair. An intrinsically American right is
to be judged by a jury of your peers. That rarely happens when the
media judge minorities.</TE>
<TE>   A study released by the American Society of Newspaper Editors last
April showed minorities made up 11.85% of the reporting staffs around
the country.</TE>
<TE>   And at no place does the white media world encounter black culture
as frequently as the sports section, particularly when it comes to
football and basketball.</TE>
<TE>   Some things get lost in the filter. One person's hot dog is
another person's performer with flavor. Highly paid athletes get
criticized when they harp about a lack of "respect," while in the
entertainment pages highly paid Hollywood actors and directors are
allowed to part ways over "creative differences" as a regular part of
business.</TE>
<TE>   Same principles, different code words.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Richardson's Razorbacks, a bad season is a bad
season. With his team's 13-14 record, he wasn't getting it done this
season.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe a few different voices would have given him more slack for
all he brought to the school, including three trips to the Final Four
and a national championship.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe there would have been a better understanding of what he has
to go through as the only African American coach at that Southern
school, or the meaning behind his statements such as:</TE>
<TE>   "My great-great-grandfather came over on the ship, not Nolan
Richardson. I didn't come over on that ship, so I expect to be
treated a little bit different. Because I know for a fact that I do
not play on the same level as the other coaches around this school
play on. I know that. You know it. And people of my color know that.
And that angers me."</TE>
<TE>   At the 2001 Final Four, there were perhaps a dozen or so African
Americans among the hundreds of reporters sent to cover the event.
The demographics were similar in 1994, when the room quickly tuned
out Richardson's complaints about a lack of respect as his team made
its run to the championship.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson expounded on his comments the next year. It wasn't
about him. It was about black coaches in general, and what they go
through.</TE>
<TE>   Being an African American with even half a conscience means
understanding that nothing you accomplish exists in a vacuum. You
always owe a debt to those who made the sacrifices to give you your
opportunity, and you owe something to the generation that follows.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson knows he won't be held in the same regard as many of
his white peers. But if he makes enough noise, maybe a coach like
Ernie Kent will get his due.</TE>
<TE>   Former Georgetown coach John Thompson noticed that as he kept
winning and kept up his rhetoric, the number of black reporters sent
to cover his team both locally and nationally increased. That was
using his clout to make a difference in his sphere of influence. He
was a basketball coach, not a civil rights leader, but he made an
impact where he could.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson didn't like to be categorized and let anyone make
assumptions about him. If anything, Thompson was tougher on the black
writers such as myself, David Aldridge and Mike Freeman when we
covered the Hoyas for the Washington Post.</TE>
<TE>   But if Thompson caused editors to diversify their staffs, maybe
the next outspoken African American coach wouldn't have the
"controversial" tag hung on him so quickly, or perhaps he would be
described as something more than a good recruiter.</TE>
<TE>   Here's this African American writer's take on the Richardson
departure: Once he held that news conference, he had to go. He
wrecked the working environment at Arkansas by alienating the
administration, the fans and the media.</TE>
<TE>   And I think he wanted to go. Maybe he got wind that some boosters
were rounding up funds for a buyout. Or that the administration was
collecting names for a replacement.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson's time came this year. Seventeen years and 16
postseason trips after he arrived. He was a great coach while he
lasted. Perhaps his fellow Southeastern Conference school Kentucky
would never hire an African American coach such as Tubby Smith if not
for Richardson's success at Arkansas.</TE>
<TE>   I wonder if he had it tougher than we realize, that he had to deal
with more behind-the-scenes battles than we'll know.</TE>
<TE>   I've read some tired columns that sarcastically lament poor Nolan
Richardson and his $3-million buyout. These writers will never even
have a chance of considering Richardson's perspective. They'll never
write in a newsroom in which they're the minority.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Vaughn Refused DH Role</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MESA, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Mo Vaughn bristled at the thought. In November, Angel General Manager
Bill Stoneman met with Vaughn and explained that the team intended
for him to be its designated hitter this year.</LD>
<LD>   "He made it clear he wasn't interested in DH-ing," Stoneman said.</LD>
<LD>   That apparently was the final straw for Vaughn, whose three
injury-filled years in Anaheim ended in December, when the Angels
traded the unhappy slugger to the New York Mets for pitcher Kevin
Appier.</LD>
<TE>   In September, the Angels gave outfielder Darin Erstad a trial run
at first base. In October, during the interview in which he told a
Boston radio station he longed for the East Coast and wanted to be
traded, Vaughn also said of a move from first base to designated
hitter, "I'm going to fight it as long as I can."</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman said Vaughn never issued a formal trade demand during
their meeting, or at any other time. Then again, he didn't need to,
after his radio interview and after hiring a new agent to help
orchestrate a trade. "It was subtle," Stoneman said. "He never
retracted his desire to go east."</TE>
<TE>   Did Stoneman believe Vaughn could no longer play adequate defense
at first base?</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't go that far," Stoneman said. "We thought we would be
better served with [Scott] Spiezio at first base and Mo at DH than
vice versa."</TE>
<TE>   The Angel players believe they are better served with Vaughn in
New York. Garret Anderson said that Vaughn was "way out of line" for
so publicly asking out of Anaheim before meeting with team officials,
that "a lot of guys didn't care for what he said" and that "if a guy
doesn't want to be here, it's not good for him to be here."</TE>
<TE>   Said Vaughn, speaking before Monday's exhibition game against the
Dodgers: "I respect his opinion. I'm surprised he didn't say more.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want to be a distraction, and you don't want to be
somewhere where you're always discussing how you want to leave. G.A.
is right. He's a friend, he's always been a straight-shooter, and
that's what I love about him. I'm glad it got taken care of when it
did. We're both in a better position."</TE>
<TE>   Troy Percival, who also has applauded the trade, remained cool to
Vaughn after the slugger failed to join teammates on the field in a
1999 brawl at Cleveland, prompted by Percival hitting the Indians'
David Justice with a pitch.</TE>
<TE>   "Troy was probably looking at me as the player I was in 1995, '96,
'97 and '98," Vaughn said. "He was looking for that player to add to
his team and, when I wasn't able to do that, he was probably
disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   "I can understand his frustration because I had the same
frustration, and maybe more."</TE>
<TE>   From his beloved East Coast, Vaughn wishes the Angels well.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no ill will against the Anaheim Angels," he said. "I just
wish I was healthy and could have played."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Appier and Anderson made their Cactus League debuts in the Angels'
10-9 victory over the Chicago Cubs on Monday. Manager Mike Scioscia
said Appier was "a little out of whack" during a two-inning stint in
which he gave up two runs, three hits and four walks.... Anderson,
who led the Angels with 123 runs batted in last season, drove in a
run in his first at-bat of the spring. Scioscia plans to bat Anderson
fourth, putting his top run-producing man behind Tim Salmon, who has
walked at least 90 times in six of the last seven seasons. But
because Anderson would prefer to bat third, Scioscia invited him into
his office to discuss the issue. "That's basically a compliment, to
call me in and ask me," Anderson said. "Of all the managers I've had,
I've never had one ask my opinion of anything." Anderson had his say
and vows to bat fourth without complaint.... Shawn Wooten, whose left
hand was badly bruised when he was hit by a pitch Friday, was used as
a pinch-hitter against the Cubs.... Adam Kennedy and Jorge Fabregas
had three hits apiece for the Angels.</TE>

<HD>Jeter, Giambi Are Ailing on Yankees</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter is expected to sit out at least
five games because of a strained neck muscle.</LD>
<LD>   Jeter was hurt while taking batting practice Sunday. After a few
rounds of batting practice, he felt pain on one swing.</LD>
<LD>   "The good thing is, it's just a couple of days," Jeter said Monday
when asked how long he will be sidelined.</LD>
<TE>   "It's like a charley horse in the neck."</TE>
<TE>   First baseman Jason Giambi left Monday's 7-3 loss to a Minnesota
Twins split-squad after his left leg stiffened.</TE>
<TE>   Giambi sat out two intrasquad games and two exhibition games last
week because of left hamstring tightness.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't reinjure it," Yankee Manager Joe Torre said. "He
couldn't get it loose. My guess is Giambi would play if it was the
regular season. It's not a big concern."</TE>
<TE>   Giambi will undergo treatment today and is expected to be out of
action until at least Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland outfielder Alex Escobar, the key player in the trade
that sent All-Star second baseman Roberto Alomar to the New York
Mets, injured his left knee in an exhibition at Winter Haven, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Escobar was to undergo an MRI examination on the knee Monday night
at Winter Haven Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota third baseman Corey Koskie has a sprained right wrist,
and the team doesn't know how long the injury will keep him out of
the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Koskie had an MRI test Monday, but results were unavailable.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seattle utility player Mark McLemore was involved in a scuffle at
a store near the team's training facility in Peoria, Ariz., police
and club officials confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   McLemore told police he went into the store in Glendale to ask
about an electrical cord adapter, but couldn't get help from store
employee Chris Mills and accused Mills of walking toward him in a
threatening manner.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. McLemore said the store employee tried to remove this part
that he was asking a question about out of his hand.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he felt threatened by this, especially when McLemore said
this employee tried to walk through him .... meaning basically walk
right over him," police spokesman Matt Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   No one was injured, and the incident appeared to be "something
that would just fade away," Mariner General Manager Pat Gillick told
the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox hired former Texas Ranger general manager Doug Melvin
as a consultant, the third major appointment by Boston's new owners
in just the last five days.</TE>
<TE>   More are expected, although club President Larry Lucchino wouldn't
comment on Manager Joe Kerrigan's status.</TE>
<TE>   Melvin, fired by the Rangers after last season, expects to spend
the next two to three months studying the Red Sox player development
system and making recommendations for improvement.</TE>

<LD>March Madness is here and the "Mad Man" of college basketball, Dick
Vitale, will be in full swing.</LD>
<LD>   He has his critics in the media, but he told Paul Doyle of the
Hartford Courant: "You're never going to please everyone, when you're
a different style and different personality.</LD>
<LD>   "The bottom line is, the one thing I'm very proud of, in 23 years
I have never, ever read a critique where they've ever questioned my
knowledge of the game. You get some that will question my style and
say I talk a little too much or I'm too loud or I get a little too
enthusiastic.</LD>
<TE>   "You know what? You don't have to go to Harvard to figure that
out. I could tell you that."</TE>
<TE>   Comment: You're awesome, bay-bee.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the Pacific 10 Conference men's basketball
tournament record for points in a game?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Give him credit: Skip Bayless in the San Jose Mercury News: "Many
fans, blinded by the spotlight on Barry Bonds' arrogance and
aloofness, still view him as The Bad Guy Who Makes Way Too Much
Money.</TE>
<TE>   "I view him as the best value in baseball.... Barry Bonds is
living, breathing, slugging Cooperstown. Seeing him still in a Giants
uniform isn't a pain. It's a privilege."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sounds familiar: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle:
"Mike Tyson's attorney [now there's a job] is asking the Nevada State
Athletic Commission to reconsider its refusal to license Tyson.</TE>
<TE>   "Evidently the attorney heard a rumor that the French commissioner
is waffling."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Ostler: "The president of the French Skating Federation says:
'It was total nonsense to award two gold medals.' He probably added,
'If the Canadian skaters want gold medals, they should get 'em the
old fashioned way--by trading votes.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Misconception: Mike Bianchi of the Orlando Sentinel on the
Arkansas basketball situation: "The saddest part of the whole ordeal
is that Nolan Richardson always claimed the world didn't give him
enough credit, but he really didn't give the world enough credit.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw him for what he was--a great coach and a traiI blazer in
his profession. He saw us for what we weren't--racists and bigots."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's a sit-down sport: According to the Daily Record of Glasgow,
Scotland, a series of pregame warmup exercises has been developed for
soccer fans.</TE>
<TE>   A new study discovered that up to 400 fans are treated for
injuries each season at games in Britain's Premier League.</TE>
<TE>   The most common injuries are sprains to the neck, shoulders and
back, when fans jump up too quickly to cheer goals.</TE>
<TE>   Wait a minute! This is soccer. What goals?</TE>

<TE>   A place to be young: Florida Marlin outfielder Tim Raines, on
playing at the age of 42: "But I'm only 32 in the Dominican
Republic."</TE>

<TE>   Trivia answer: Reggie Miller of UCLA, 39, against Arizona State on
March 6, 1987.</TE>

<TE>   And finally: According to Manager Hal McRae's new dress code, the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays must wear high stirrup socks.</TE>

<DH>Scott Wins in New Jersey With Style He Learned From Riley
and Brown</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK HEISLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They call him Coach?</LD>
<LD>   That didn't occur to anyone in the '80s, Byron Scott included.</LD>
<LD>   He was the Laker you saw but didn't know, whose quiet demeanor
belied an exciting dunk-over-you game, who accepted his role so
completely and promoted himself so little, he flew under the radar,
their stealth shooting guard.</LD>
<TE>   That's what people thought he was, a shooter, period, but he was
sound and tough too, the one they'd put on Michael Jordan (gee,
thanks), the blunt one who got right to the point, so while Magic
Johnson would note that young Vlade Divac needed to turn it up, Scott
would say:</TE>
<TE>   "Some days Vlade comes to play and some days he doesn't."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson was smiles and long answers. Scott was succinct and if
reporters didn't ask his opinion, just as happy.</TE>
<TE>   Laker fans adored Johnson, respected Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, admired
James Worthy, marveled at Michael Cooper's Coop-a-Loops and one
season even voted A.C. Green, who was more devout than charismatic,
into the All-Star starting lineup ahead of Karl Malone.</TE>
<TE>   Magic, Kareem and Big Game James, of course, were perennial
All-Stars, but Scott never made it, not even in 1997-98, when he
averaged 21.7 points and shot 53%.</TE>
<TE>   But, as Scott noted recently, good things come to those who wait.</TE>
<TE>   And really good things come to those who wait and watch and
listen....</TE>
<TE>   It's fall, 2000, just like the good old days, or as close as
Scott, newly hired to coach the woebegone New Jersey Nets, can make
them.</TE>
<TE>   In his first training camp, they're dropping like, well, Nets. A
friend, who has flown in to help Scott kick off his coaching career,
thinks it's hilarious.</TE>
<TE>   "Byron has got Pat Riley written all over him," Johnson says. "Has
his notes right in his shorts. I hollered out, 'Junior Riley!'</TE>
<TE>   "I was at the first practice and Kendall Gill came out and said,
'Man, this is the hardest practice I've ever been in!'</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'What'd I tell you?'</TE>
<TE>   "Three guys dropped out. One--[Evan] Eschmeyer--went over and
started throwing up.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'That's Junior Riley.'"</TE>
<TE>   Of course, in the old days, Scott rolled his eyes at Pat Riley as
much as any of them. Now here's Byron, giving his fledglings a taste
of the lash, or at least more laps.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the famous Byron candor. Even Riley played that game,
covering for players--or blaming the media for criticizing them--even
as he criticized them.</TE>
<TE>   Scott still just lays it out.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, in what turned out to be a promising and disastrous
debut at the same time, Scott zinged them all publicly, even Stephon
Marbury, who was doted on and feared by everyone else in the
organization.</TE>
<TE>   "He will say some things," Jason Kidd, Marbury's successor and the
franchise's savior, says of his new coach. "He say something bad?"</TE>
<TE>   Not recently. This season, in one of the bigger turnarounds in NBA
history, the Nets lead the Eastern Conference by 41/2 games.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, he speaks his mind," Kidd says. "As a player, I never
thought of him as a guy who shoots straight from the hip and so it
took some time to get used to.</TE>
<TE>   "But I think the big thing is, you have to look at it as, he's
telling the truth."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Scott always shot the same way. This is just the first
time he has been in a position where anyone noticed.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, the truth was painful, but for the moment, at least,
the Nets are the best team in the East. Scott just made his All-Star
debut, as a coach.</TE>
<TE>   He's a star in the new wave of coaches, outspoken,
up-from-the-ranks guys such as Orlando's Doc Rivers and Seattle's
Nate McMillan, who won't have to worry where their next job, at $3
million a year and up, is coming from.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, these are the Nets, so you don't want to ask what could
go wrong now.</TE>
<TE>   In Which His Dues Are Paid in Full</TE>
<TE>   "I'll tell you what Earvin did for me.... I thought playing in
high school and college that I was a leader, probably by more of an
example. Where he taught me not only to do it but act it and be it
and talk it and walk it and everything else....</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't say I got out from under his wing, but I took a little
bit of Earvin with me."</TE>
<TE>   --Scott</TE>
<TE>   Five seasons in the league, four appearances in the finals, three
rings, what was the hard part?</TE>
<TE>   That didn't come until later.</TE>
<TE>   Acquired in 1984 from the San Diego Clippers for the popular Norm
Nixon, Scott first had to prove to Norman's co-Musketeers, Johnson
and Cooper, that he could take anything they could heap upon him.</TE>
<TE>   After that, it was a purple and gold fairy tale.</TE>
<TE>   "Magic and Coop were the tough ones on me," Scott says. "It wasn't
Riles. Magic and Coop were a little upset at the fact I had taken
Norm Nixon's spot and so they made it hard on me the first couple
weeks of practice....</TE>
<TE>   "One day Coop and I got into it. Magic looked at me the next day,
just kind of said, 'You know, you've got heart. You didn't back down
from us, you took everything we gave you, you just kept coming.'"</TE>
<TE>   Depending on who's telling the story, the process took weeks or
months, but after that, Scott came on as the new Third Musketeer and
the glory days rolled on.</TE>
<TE>   Then, they ran out.</TE>
<TE>   The day before the 1989 NBA Finals, an eagerly waited series
between the twice-defending champion Lakers and Detroit, which had
won 63 games to the Lakers' 57, Scott tore a hamstring in a typically
rugged Riley rebounding drill. Johnson tore a hamstring in Game 2 and
the Pistons swept them.</TE>
<TE>   None of the Lakers actually said they shouldn't have been running
the drill, then or thereafter. It was just what they did.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, who knew the program had only a year left?</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, the Phoenix Suns upset the Lakers in the second round and
players muttered darkly that Riley had gone too far. Taking his cue,
Riley, who was as drained as they were, accepted a buyout and left.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, the Lakers were back in the finals under Mike
Dunleavy, but the Chicago Bulls dispatched them in five games.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, Johnson retired, saying he had tested positive for
HIV.</TE>
<TE>   A year after that, Dunleavy left for a better offer in, of all
places, Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   A year after that, Scott's contract ran out and the Lakers let him
go. At 32, he was already in his twilight years: two as a Pacer, one
in Vancouver, one back with the Lakers, one in Greece, ballgame ...
almost.</TE>
<TE>   In Indiana, he had played for Larry Brown, who had his own way of
seeing things. Everyone had always said Scott couldn't handle the
ball; in Byron's first time back in the Forum, Brown started him at
point guard.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone had always thought of Scott as Johnson's little brother,
starting with Byron (or as he put it recently, "Still am.")</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, Brown encouraged him to think about coaching.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that I really loved about Larry Brown, when he would
come up with a game plan, he would always present it to us," Scott
says. "He would go through it and ask if we liked it or if we wanted
to do something differently because we were the ones out there
playing.</TE>
<TE>   "So many times, he would say, 'How did you guys [Lakers] do it?'</TE>
<TE>   "And I would show him. It just got to the point, he looked at me
and he said, 'One day, you'll make a good coach. If you ever decide
to do this, you'll make a good coach.'</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, from that day on, that's all I started doing. I started
thinking about it and I started writing things down, writing plays
... things I wouldn't do, things I would like to do. Just kept a
little journal for the next five years, 'til I got an opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Two seasons in Sacramento as an assistant and he got his
opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately or not....</TE>
<TE>   Showtime in The Swamp</TE>
<TE>   "This is the franchise synonymous with hideous disaster, rotten
luck and worse timing. In previous lives, the Nets married Calamity
Jane, vacationed on Atlantis, flew the Hindenburg. But now luck--and
results--are changing....</TE>
<TE>   "No one writes, 'Trade Me' or 'All Alone' on his sneakers (all are
tied, incidentally). There hasn't been a single 'Whoop dee damn
doo.'"</TE>
<TE>   --Fred Kerber, New York Post</TE>
<TE>   Imagine the Clippers in a North Jersey swamp, ritually mismanaged,
seemingly cursed, so overshadowed by their "cross-town rivals" that
when they meet in their own arena, it's packed by New York Knick
fans, cheering against them.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine, Derrick Coleman of "Whoop dee damn doo" fame, actually
making up T-shirts to ridicule management's $9 million-a-year offer.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine designated savior John Calipari calling a reporter "a
Mexican idiot," and getting carried out feet first 20 games into his
third season, with a 3-17 record.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine bringing in Marbury as their long-sought franchise player,
only to learn he is a tad hard on the other players and openly
contemptuous of Keith Van Horn.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine a do-nothing committee of owners called the Secaucus
Seven, which finally sells to starry-eyed Lewis Katz, who hires Rod
Thorn at $3 million per--twice the going rate for general
managers--then sells control to something called "YankeeNets," which
is headed by (shudder) George Steinbrenner, who puts the basketball
team under the operational control of Lou Lamoriello, the boss of the
NHL's New Jersey Devils.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine Scott in his first season, getting them off fast (6-4),
then watching them succumb to the usual horrific combination of
injuries and egos.</TE>
<TE>   Then, after their 26-56 finish, imagine Thorn being told he has to
dump salary: Van Horn's, Marbury's, someone's, as long as it's big.</TE>
<TE>   Then imagine Thorn, whose accomplishments to date are modest
enough (see: Chicago Bulls, where he drafted Ronnie Lester after he
blew out his knee, Quintin Daily after the rape charge and Ennis
Whatley after his drug incident), makes one of the great trades in
NBA history:</TE>
<TE>   Marbury for Kidd.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd had had his own problem, a domestic abuse arrest in Phoenix,
but had owned up to it by all accounts, even if it wasn't enough for
the Suns, who were growing desperate, themselves.</TE>
<TE>   As a player, however, Kidd is a wellspring of karma, 180 degrees
from the aloof Marbury, and the effect on the Nets has been
galvanizing. Throw in a good signing (Todd MacCulloch) and a return
to good health (Kenyon Martin, Kerry Kittles) and here they are.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, exactly where is that?</TE>
<TE>   Kidd is a free agent in 2003 and there are already signs he and
his wife, Joumana, don't like Lamoriello's
market-the-team-not-the-individual philosophy.</TE>
<TE>   Lamoriello has the credibility that comes with NHL titles, but
this isn't the NHL. Kidd is relatively soft-spoken and
low-maintenance, but an NBA star is an NBA star, used to being
lavishly stroked and perked.</TE>
<TE>   So it's not a good sign when Joumana, like Jason a native
Californian, tells ESPN magazine's Ric Bucher she was "counting the
days" when they arrived--although she says she's over it--or that she
had to negotiate with the team for premium parking and other details.</TE>
<TE>   Nor does it look good when Kidd didn't dismiss Tim Duncan's musing
All-Star weekend about one day playing together, although Kidd later
noted he's happy where he is, etc.</TE>
<TE>   But that's a challenge, or calamity, for another day. The Nets
have enough problems in the present, playing the Lakers in the start
of a four-game trip, but they're still on a 55-win pace that would
represent a 29-game improvement, fourth biggest in NBA history.</TE>
<TE>   A little bit of Earvin, a little bit of Brown, a lot of Riley ...
it adds up.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a very positive person, always have been," Scott said
recently. "Even though it was real rough last year, you do tend to
learn different things about yourself as a player or as a person or
as a coach. I learned a lot about myself: Hey, I can take the
adversity. I can take it, deal with it and I can grow from it."</TE>
<TE>   Good gigs, or bad ones, are hard to find. Rick Barry, now a
talk-show host in Oakland, campaigns openly for the Golden State job.
Abdul-Jabbar himself just took a job coaching the Oklahoma City entry
in the U.S. Basketball League.</TE>
<TE>   For better and/or worse, Scott's got his.</TE>

<HD>Underdog Siena Crashes the Party</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Siena players and coaches aren't surprised. They might be the
only ones.</LD>
<LD>   Dwayne Archbold scored 30 points and the Saints capped an
improbable Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Tournament run with a
92-77 win over Niagara on Monday night at Albany, N.Y., to secure an
automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.</LD>
<LD>   "It doesn't surprise me at all, because I knew what this team was
capable of," Archbold said. "It just took us a long time to get
everything together, and it just came together in the tournament."</LD>
<TE>   Archbold, the tournament's most valuable player, set a MAAC record
with 111 points in four games.</TE>
<TE>   Siena (16-18) became the first MAAC team to win the championship
after participating in a play-in game as one of the league's bottom
four seeds. The conference went to that format five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The Saints took an 11-point halftime lead and didn't let the
Purple Eagles (18-14) get closer than seven in the second half.
Niagara's final chance to close the gap came with one minute left
when it caused a turnover and Tremell Darden broke out on a
fastbreak.</TE>
<TE>   Darden hesitated at the three-point line, picked up his dribble
and lost the ball, sealing the loss.</TE>
<TE>   Siena's last NCAA appearance came in 1999, when it lost to
Arkansas in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   OTHER TOURNAMENTS</TE>
<TE>   Colonial Athletic Assn.--Brett Blizzard scored 22 points and North
Carolina Wilmington used a fast start and rugged defense to beat
Virginia Commonwealth, 66-51, in the championship game at Richmond.</TE>
<TE>   The Seahawks (22-9) led, 28-10, after 10 minutes and never let the
Rams closer than eight again. Wilmington earned the second NCAA
tournament bid in school history.</TE>
<TE>   Missouri Valley--Terrell Taylor scored 20 points and Kyle Korver
added 18, pacing Creighton to an 84-76 victory over Southern Illinois
in the title game at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Second-seeded Creighton (22-8), which lost twice during the
regular season to the top-seeded Salukis (26-7), has reached the NCAA
tournament the last four years.</TE>
<TE>   Sun Belt--Patrick Sparks made the game-winning shot as time
expired to lead No. 18 Western Kentucky to a 73-72 victory over New
Mexico State in the semifinals at New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   The win gave Western Kentucky (27-3) its 17th straight victory,
the second-longest streak in the nation.</TE>

<HD>Overton Replaces Dooling</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The phone rang at Doug Overton's place in Barcelona, Spain, and he
was out the door and on his way to the airport before he had time to
say, "Adios, amigos." Overton caught a flight Sunday to Los Angeles
and, 12 hours later, was a Clipper.</LD>
<LD>   "This team is one of the teams I've been following all season,"
said Overton, a veteran guard signed to a 10-day contract to bolster
the team for the stretch drive. "I'll bring some leadership and some
survival skills."</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers, 30-30 and ninth in the Western Conference standings,
could use some of each. This is Overton's 10th NBA season and he will
be replacing Keyon Dooling, a backup point guard who on Monday was
put on the injured list. A sore left ankle has cut short Dooling's
second season.</LD>
<TE>   "He doesn't do anything great, but he does everything solid,"
Coach Alvin Gentry said of Overton. "I like his energy. I like his
knowledge of the game. I like him as a player. I like him as a
person. He's a good chemistry guy."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry plans to use Overton as a backup to point guard Jeff
McInnis, which means the Clippers will have two players on 10-day
contracts playing significant minutes. Tremaine Fowlkes assumed the
starting spot at small forward when Corey Maggette dislocated two
bones in his right hand and is expected to sign a second 10-day
contract today.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if it's going to be as dramatic as Tremaine, but,
yeah, I do expect to get him into the games," Gentry said of Overton,
32, who has played for Washington, Denver, Philadelphia, New Jersey,
Orlando, Boston and Charlotte. "He's a veteran guy. He's been around
the league and played a lot of minutes over the years. He knows what
the situation is. He catches on quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Overton averaged 10.3 points in three games during his short stay
with FC Barcelona. He also averaged 14.4 points and 6.5 assists in 16
games with Kansas City of the new American Basketball Assn. before
leaving for Spain.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Piazza Hurts, Jordan Fumes After Incidents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers and New York Mets turned Monday's exhibition game into an
episode of "The Sopranos," with Met catcher Mike Piazza getting
whacked by a pitch, Dodger left fielder Brian Jordan accusing Met
Manager Bobby Valentine of ordering a hit on him, and both camps
feuding about an early spring skirmish.</LD>
<LD>   It began with Piazza, a nine-time All-Star, getting drilled on the
left forearm by an Eric Gagne fourth-inning fastball that was headed
for Piazza's helmet. Piazza glared at Gagne for several seconds, but
no words were exchanged. Though Piazza was pulled from the Dodgers'
9-4 victory, his injury didn't appear serious; the former Dodger
escaped with a sizeable lump below his elbow.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan then led off the top of the fifth against reliever Mark
Guthrie, another former Dodger, and Guthrie's first pitch backed
Jordan off the plate. One strike later, Guthrie, a left-hander, came
inside with a fastball that grazed Jordan's thigh. Home plate umpire
Lance Barksdale issued a warning, and there were no further
hostilities, but Jordan was miffed after exiting the game.</LD>
<TE>   "It's too early for that," said Jordan, the former Atlanta Brave
who tormented the Mets with five home runs and 19 runs batted in last
season. "I think [Guthrie] got the signal [to hit me] from Valentine.
I respect [Guthrie] for not drilling me. He has to protect Piazza.
But I'll write that one down in my memory book."</TE>
<TE>   Valentine seemed almost amused by Jordan's remarks. Guthrie, the
Met manager noted, went right from the bullpen to the mound to start
the fifth inning and did not confer with Valentine.</TE>
<TE>   "I think [Jordan] is flattering himself," Valentine said. "Did he
get hit? I thought the pitch missed him. He thought there was a
definite situation because there were two inside pitches. But what do
they have, a microphone in my dugout? How exactly would I do that?"</TE>
<TE>   Jordan wasn't buying it. He knows the Mets were probably still
smarting from his dramatic two-out grand slam in the bottom of the
ninth inning Sept. 29, a shot that capped a seven-run rally and gave
the Braves an 8-5 victory, all but killing the Mets' playoff hopes.
And he knew when Piazza got hit, the Mets would respond.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he thought Valentine was the sole person responsible for
him getting hit, Jordan said, "Yep. Valentine wanted to send a
message.... As a manager you've got to protect your player, and
Piazza is a big one to protect."</TE>
<TE>   Valentine's response?</TE>
<TE>   "Good," he said. "Let everybody know we're going to protect our
guys. No doubt, our pitchers know Mike is a very valuable part of our
team. My guy got hit on the arm real hard, and he could have been
hurt and sidelined for a while. Their guy got hit on the belt
buckle."</TE>
<TE>   Guthrie claimed there was "no signal, no order" to hit Jordan.
"The ball didn't even hit him, unless it brushed his jersey," Guthrie
said. "I couldn't tell."</TE>
<TE>   There was no question Piazza was hit. And hard.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't happy about it," Piazza said. "It hurts. It's not a
pleasant experience to have a ball going toward your head and to get
hit on such a chilly day. But I'm OK."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if Guthrie's pitches to Jordan were in retaliation, Piazza
gave the sly grin of a knowing veteran. "You've got to work both
sides of the plate," he said. "They were doing it, and we were doing
it."</TE>
<TE>   Gagne, the 26-year-old right-hander who is competing with Odalis
Perez and Omar Daal for the fifth spot in the rotation, was
remorseful.</TE>
<TE>   "You never want to see a Hall of Famer get hurt by a
spring-training pitch," said Gagne, who recovered to pitch three
hitless innings. "I hope he's all right. He knows I didn't do it on
purpose. I tried to throw a two-seamer too hard, and it got away."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, meanwhile, just wanted to get out of Thomas J. White
Stadium as soon as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a bad day all around," he said. "I had my glove stolen off
the bench before the game and then this.... Welcome to Port St.
Lucie."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Perez looked sharp Monday, giving up no runs, one hit and striking
out four in three innings. Perez also contributed to a five-run
second inning with a run-scoring double.... Right fielder Shawn
Green, slowed by a mild case of tendinitis in his left shoulder, will
begin participating in throwing drills this week and hopes to play in
an exhibition game by this weekend.... Pitchers Kevin Brown and
Kazuhisa Ishii will throw simulated games Wednesday, and Andy Ashby,
recovering from elbow surgery, will make his first exhibition start
Wednesday against Florida.... The Mets and Dodgers will meet four
more times this spring and play each other six times during the
season.</TE>

<KH>GIRLS' TRACK SEASON PREVIEW</KH>
<HD>There's Still No Overlooking Untested Poly</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Coach Don Norford of Long Beach Poly High claims he's serious when he
says the Jackrabbit girls' track and field team should not be favored
to win the state championships this season.</LD>
<LD>   He explains that the graduation of Candace Baucham, Na'Onka Mixon
and Jamie Kolar last June has left defending state champion Poly with
some huge holes to fill in the long jump, triple jump and pole vault.</LD>
<LD>   And that a team such as Riverside North could present problems for
the Jackrabbits because the Huskies are strong in the field events as
well as in the sprints, hurdles and relays.</LD>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Poly is regarded by most as the team to beat in the
state championships because of the Jackrabbits' superb talent in the
sprints, hurdles and relays.</TE>
<TE>   "They definitely deserve to be the favorites," said Coach Dan
Fitzpatrick of Cerritos Gahr.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to win state this year, but [Poly] has to be the
favorite."</TE>
<TE>   Poly, which is shooting for its seventh state championship in the
last 11 years, was expected to have the Nos. 3, 5 and 8 returning
100-meter sprinters in the state this season, the Nos. 3 and 5
returners in the 200, the No. 3 returner in the 100 high hurdles and
the No. 2 returner in the 300 low hurdles.</TE>
<TE>   The Jackrabbits became even stronger, however, with the transfers
of juniors Dominique Dorsey from Inglewood and Shauntae McKinney from
Westchester.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey is the sixth-fastest returning 200 sprinter in the state
with a time of 24.29 seconds, and McKinney is the seventh-fastest
returner in the 400 at 54.89 and a two-time City Section champion in
the 800.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Shalonda Solomon and senior Tunisia Johnson are expected
to be the leaders on a team of standouts for Poly.</TE>
<TE>   Solomon placed second in the 100 and third in the 200 in the state
championships last season and has career bests of 11.57 in the 100
and 23.65 in the 200.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, she ran on a 1,600 relay team that finished second in
the state championships in a season-best 3 minutes 39.75 seconds and
on a 400 relay team that was ranked second in the nation with a best
of 45.57 before being disqualified for passing the baton out of its
zone in the Southern Section Division I preliminaries.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson placed second in the 300 low hurdles and sixth in the high
hurdles in the state championships and has bests of 42.32 in the low
hurdles and 14.11 in the highs.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Norford says that Riverside North and Oakland Bishop
O'Dowd should be considered as tri-favorites for the state title with
Poly.</TE>
<TE>   "[North] is much more experienced than we are, especially in the
field events," Norford said.</TE>
<TE>   "I have some talented people in the jumps, but they're young.
They're not battle-tested. You get them up in front of a big crowd in
a big meet and you never know how they're going to perform."</TE>

<LD>A look at the preseason top 10 girls' track and field teams in the
Southland:</LD>
<LD>   1. Long Beach Poly (SS-Div. I)</LD>
<LD>   The return of sprinters Shalonda Solomon, Jasmine Lee and Chanda

<TE>   10. L.A. Baptist (SS-Div. IV)</TE>
<TE>   Allyson Felix is the defending state champion in the 100 and was
runner-up in the 200 last year, but the team is not expected to have

<LD>   What: "Round One, The Album"</LD>
<LD>   Performer: Roy Jones Jr.</LD>
<TE>   Producer: Body Head Entertainment, Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $12.58</TE>
<TE>   World light-heavyweight boxing champion Roy Jones Jr. added
another element to his list of accomplishments with the release last
week of his first rap album, "Round One, The Album."</TE>
<TE>   Jones, who lives in Pensacola, Fla., is featured in "Round One"
but receives contributions from established performers, such as
former Blackstreet singer Dave Hollister and rappers Mystikal and
Scarface.</TE>
<TE>   Jones wrote or co-wrote the 19 songs on the album, performing six.
Several reflect on Jones' career in boxing, including "Ya'll Must've
Forgot," which was played in July at Staples Center before Jones'
fight against Julio Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   The song, heard regularly since on local radio stations, seeks to
remind listeners why Jones is still considered by many as the best
pound-for-pound fighter in the world. In the three-minute song, Jones
recounts some of the biggest moments of his 14-year professional
career.</TE>
<TE>   "You remember the left hook that James Toney got?" Jones raps of
the 1994 victory that earned him the International Boxing Federation
super-middleweight title, "it's a sucker move I stole from a
gamecock."</TE>
<TE>   In the song, "Real Father," Jones, 33, communicates the love for
his children, 10-year-old twin boys DeShaun and DeAndre, and
2-year-old Roy III, and describes the importance of men staying close
to their children.</TE>
<TE>   "My youngest son and my twins are my best friends," he sings in
one verse. "My love for them you can't put prices on."</TE>
<TE>   Another song that has been well received is "That Was Then,"
performed by Hollister.</TE>
<TE>   It made its debut at No. 2 in January on Billboard's Hot Rap
singles list and is holding at No. 3 after eight weeks on the charts.</TE>

<HD>Kings Can Live With 1-1 Tie Against Ottawa</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kings didn't exactly play their best game of the season Monday
night against Ottawa, but they didn't play too badly either.</LD>
<LD>   That's why their 1-1 tie with the Senators in front of 15,815 at
Staples Center was so fitting, because at this stage of the season, a
point is still a point.</LD>
<LD>   Left wing Craig Johnson broke out of a scoring slump with his
first goal since Jan. 28 and goaltender Felix Potvin made 24 saves to
help the Kings improve to 29-21-9-3 and move within four points of
Pacific Division-leading San Jose.</LD>
<TE>   "We've talked about how every goal now is almost like two goals
because all of the games are going to be so close," interim Coach
Dave Tippett said about the Kings' stretch run. "With that being
said, goals are harder to come by because everyone is playing
desperate. You are going to see the best goaltenders every night.
It's going to be tight."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the Kings failed to score first for the fourth
consecutive game since the Olympic break. This time, it was Ottawa
defenseman Wade Redden who cashed in to give the Senators an early
1-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa center Todd White did not pick up an assist on the play but
he played a key role on the Senators' lone goal. After having a
backhand shot stopped by Potvin from the top of the crease, White
parked in front of the King goalie and helped enable Redden to score
his eighth goal this season, at 13:45 into the first period.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who are 12-15-6 in games that they do not score first,
didn't take long to match Ottawa's score.</TE>
<TE>   With a burst of energy from their No. 2 line of Bryan Smolinski,
Steve Heinze and Johnson, the Kings pinned the Senators deep in their
zone until Johnson found the net with his 13th goal of the season at
18:53.</TE>
<TE>   It turned out to be the last goal of the night.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought that was a playoff-type hockey game," said Tippett, who
continues to fill in for ailing Coach Andy Murray, who's recovering
from post-concussion syndrome in Faribault, Minn. "I thought that one
of our keys for the first two periods was our forecheck. But we got
away from that a little bit in the third."</TE>
<TE>   In the second, the Kings had 11 shots to only two by the Senators,
but neither team was able to score. The Kings had a couple of nice
chances in the period but they either hit a crossbar or had the puck
stopped by Patrick Lalime, who finished with 29 saves.</TE>
<TE>   It was more of the same for both teams in the third, but the Kings
found themselves being the team getting outworked for much of the
period. Although center Jason Allison and defenseman Aaron Miller
each had great scoring opportunities for the Kings, the Senators had
the best chances down the stretch of regulation play.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we played a pretty good game [except for] a few lapses,"
Miller said. "It was one of those tight, low-scoring games we need to
play coming down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "We can expect these kinds of games. Teams are really going to
start to tighten it up. I know we are going to try and play that kind
of style of game. We will win them 6-5 if we have too, but I think we
need to play low-scoring games to get ready for the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   If not for several solid saves by Potvin in the third period, the
Kings would be riding a two-game losing streak heading into a
three-game trip that has stops at Dallas, Nashville and Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody knows that if we get a couple of wins, we have a chance
to move up a couple of spots," defenseman Philippe Boucher said. "But
we also can go down a couple of spots if we lose some games."</TE>
<TE>   The last time the Kings played Ottawa was Dec. 20 and they won on
the road, 4-2, in a game that featured several brutal brawls.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa racked up 102 penalty minutes in the second period that
night, almost doubling the previous franchise high for penalty
minutes in a period (57).</TE>
<TE>   But fighting wasn't an issue on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a hard-fought game," Ottawa Coach Jacques Martin said
about Monday's contest, which did not feature any fights. "We didn't
get any shots. They outshot us badly in the second but did not get
any chances. It was a real physical game. It seemed to take us awhile
to get going."</TE>

<HD>Kobe Says He's Sorry</HD>
<DH>Lakers: Oh, Bryant doesn't feel bad about punching Miller,
but he apologizes to teammates for suspension.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK HEISLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Day 3 of his latest controversy, Kobe Bryant played "Meet the
Press."</LD>
<LD>   "What do y'all want?" he said, grinning, as a band of people
bearing tape recorders and TV cameras encircled him Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "I might sucker-punch all of y'all."</LD>
<TE>   Sporting a one-inch scratch on his left cheek--"It's like a little
baby scratch"--he refused to say what he and Indiana's Reggie Miller
had argued about after Friday's game, prompting Bryant to throw a
punch and leading to a two-game suspension for both.</TE>
<TE>   He dismissed Miller, likening him to a fool, at one point. But to
everyone else, Bryant apologized.</TE>
<TE>   "I deserved [the two-game suspension]," he said. "I deserved it.
Probably deserved even a little more....</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to apologize to my teammates because I can't join them.
They're out there battling and fighting on the court....</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe fighting is the answer. At all. I don't. But
sometimes, as a man, you have to do what you have to do....</TE>
<TE>   "We can sit up here and talk about this until we're all blue in
the face. The fact of the matter is, I made a mistake. It wasn't the
best decision in the world. At the time, I felt like it was the right
decision. I have to deal with the consequences. I have to deal with
the criticism. I just move on and continue to grow and mature as a
man. That's the bottom line."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant suggested that he'd thought Miller had extended their
night-long trash-talking duel too far, to non-basketball subject
matter.</TE>
<TE>   "Trash-talking is something, it's part of the game. There's a thin
line between taking things from the basketball court and taking
things off the court," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Miller also hinted pointedly at non-basketball matters,
declaring--two days later, in a prepared release--that, "Kobe has
other issues he has to deal with. They had nothing to do with me or
the basketball game played Friday evening."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, Bryant didn't see it that way.</TE>
<TE>   "Reggie doesn't know me," he said. "He doesn't know me at all. And
I'll never argue with fools. That's just a waste of time."</TE>
<TE>   Prohibited from being in the arena Sunday, as well as tonight,
Bryant says he watched the Lakers' victory over Houston on television
and was moved at the sight of Shaquille O'Neal wearing his No. 8 in
pregame warmups.</TE>
<TE>   As for the possibility that O'Neal stretched the jersey into a
tent, Bryant is OK with that.</TE>
<TE>   "I was kind of happy, man," he said, "because you know how the NBA
rules make you wear those tight, little John Stockton uniforms? I was
kind of happy. He stretched it out for me. I was hoping maybe he
could wear my shorts."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Phil Jackson, grinding his teeth at the thought of losing
ground to Sacramento, even as his players sent Bryant expressions of
love and support, actually saw them cut the Kings' two-game lead to
one Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   So compared to what the Lakers have been through recently....</TE>
<TE>   "This is nothing at all," Bryant said. "It's better to fight
against the opposition than it is to fight amongst ourselves. Last
year, we were fighting amongst ourselves and we pulled through just
fine."</TE>

<LD>We're talking short-handed all-around.</LD>
<LD>   The East's top team, the New Jersey Nets, plays the West's current
No. 2 team, the Lakers, tonight at Staples Center. The Lakers will be
playing without Kobe Bryant.</LD>
<LD>   The Nets will be without forward Kenyon Martin and may not have
starting center Todd MacCulloch.</LD>
<TE>   McCulloch is eligible to come off the injured list, having sat out
five games because of a sore left foot.</TE>
<TE>   On one hand, the Nets would love to throw their biggest
player--he's 7 feet, 280 pounds--at Shaquille O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, dealing with the 7-1, 350-pound-or-so O'Neal is
no way to return to action.</TE>
<TE>   Martin, who has been involved in several hard-foul incidents, was
called for his sixth flagrant foul Sunday against the Chicago Bulls,
which carries an automatic one-game suspension.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Jason Collins would start in MacCulloch's place and rookie
Richard Jefferson would start in Martin's place at forward.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Laker forward Samaki Walker, sidelined by a sore right elbow, is
close to returning.</TE>
<TE>   "The timing could be any time between--we're going to say
game-to-game situation," Coach Phil Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Just in case the Nets were getting big heads....</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to say anything about the Eastern Conference because
they've beaten up on us this year," Jackson said. "But in the West,
the teams that will make it [playoffs], in eighth place, will
probably have to be close to 50 victories.... In the East, you might
have a couple teams that are under .500 that make it into the
playoffs. That tells you something about the difference in the
conferences."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, on the Nets: "New Jersey's a great team. However, if we do
what we're supposed to, I like our chances.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't do what we're supposed to do, it'll probably be a
long night."</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>

<TE>   Fox Sports Net</TE>
<TE>   Site--Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KLAC (570).</TE>
<TE>   Records--Lakers 41-17, Nets 39-19.</TE>

<TE>   Update--The Nets are playing four road games in five nights,
starting tonight at Staples Center, followed by games Wednesday at
Phoenix, Friday at Portland and Saturday at Seattle. MVP candidate
Jason Kidd is averaging 14.5 points, 10.0 assists and 7.3 rebounds.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Portland Trail Blazer forward Shawn Kemp was reinstated by the NBA on
Monday after serving a five-game suspension for violating the
league's anti-drug agreement.</LD>
<LD>   Kemp, who was suspended indefinitely on Feb. 22, was ruled
eligible to play for the Trail Blazers on Monday night at home
against the Sacramento Kings.</LD>
<LD>   Portland activated Kemp from the suspended list before the game
and put guard Erick Barkley on the injured list because of tendinitis
in his left knee.</LD>
<TE>   Kemp was on the court 90 minutes before tipoff shooting jump
shots, but didn't speak to reporters.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of his suspension, the league announced that Kemp
would have to sit out until he resumed full compliance with his
treatment program. Kemp left the Trail Blazers late last season for
treatment of cocaine abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Former NBA player Jayson Williams offered "heartfelt condolences"
to the family of a limousine driver who he is accused of killing with
a shotgun blast.</TE>
<TE>   The former New Jersey Net spoke briefly before leaving the
Hunterdon County (N.J.) courthouse, where he appeared for a
five-minute hearing on the case. Williams is charged with
second-degree manslaughter shooting death of Costas Christofi.</TE>
<TE>   "Me and my wife would like to send out our heartfelt condolences
to Mr. Christofi's family," Williams said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Forward Eric Belanger, out of the lineup since Jan. 15 because of a
left wrist injury, could be back on the ice before the end of the
month.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm feeling pretty good," said Belanger, who had eight goals and
22 points in 46 games at the time of his injury. "If everything goes
well [when he sees the doctor March 15] I could be able to return a
week or so earlier than anticipated....</LD>
<LD>   "It's always frustrating when you miss games, especially the way
the team has been playing," said Belanger, ranked fifth in the league
in faceoff win percentage (58.5%). "It's been a learning process for
me. I hope to be a better player when I get back.</LD>
<TE>   "I'll be able to bring a lot of energy and that may help the team
for the final games."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coach Andy Murray, who's still recovering from post-concussion
syndrome in Minnesota, told the Kings' pregame television show on
Monday that he's feeling better and has not experienced any
discomfort for two consecutive days for the first time since his Feb.
15 single-vehicle accident.</TE>
<TE>   Left wing Ted Donato, who played in his only two games as a King
last week against Pittsburgh and Columbus, has been designated for
assignment to the minors but he has to clear waivers before he can
report to Manchester of the American Hockey League.</TE>
<TE>   Center Jason Allison is scheduled to visit with the kids and
families at the Los Angeles Ronald McDonald House on March 13 as part
of his matching donation program, which is based on the number of
points he scores this season.</TE>

because of excessive heckling, Colin Montgomerie has changed his
mind.</LD>
<LD>   Montgomerie said he will compete in the Players Championship later
this month and will not radically alter his PGA Tour schedule, which
would include the major championships.</LD>
<LD>   "Over the past week, the assurances that I have received from the
PGA Tour and tournament promoters, coupled with the support I have
received via phone calls, letters and e-mails from genuine U.S. golf
fans, has convinced me that I should not let a small minority dictate
where I should play my golf," he said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   When he lost to Scott McCarron in the first round of the Accenture
Match Play Championship, Montgomerie complained of being heckled and
said he would stop coming to America because "I just don't need this
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Montgomerie said reading correspondence from fans has reminded him
of "everything I enjoy about playing in America."</TE>
<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to summarize the women's draw of the Pacific Life Open:
Youngsters on one side.... veterans on the other.</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded Kim Clijsters of Belgium is in the same half as two
other 18-year-olds, No. 3 Justine Henin of Belgium and No. 5 Jelena
Dokic of Yugoslavia. In the other half are No. 2 Martina Hingis of
Switzerland, 21, and No. 4 Monica Seles, 28. Clijsters and Henin, who
could meet in the semifinals if form holds, played in the third round
here last year, with Clijsters winning.</TE>
<TE>   Main-draw action begins Wednesday at the Tennis Garden in Indian
Wells. Clijsters, who reached a career-high ranking of No. 3 in the
world Monday, was a finalist last year, losing to Serena Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Sandrine Testud of France withdrew from Indian Wells because of a
stress fracture of her right foot. Also not playing at Indian Wells,
for various reasons, are Jennifer Capriati, Venus and Serena
Williams, Lindsay Davenport and Amelie Mauresmo.</TE>
<TE>   Sixth-seeded Albert Portas and seventh-seeded Xavier Malisse won
first-round matches at the Franklin Templeton Tennis Classic at
Scottsdale, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   Malisse beat Michael Joyce, 6-1, 6-2. Portas beat Flavio Saretta,
6-3, 7-5.</TE>
<TE>   Others winners were Wayne Ferreira, Greg Rusedski, Juan Balcells,
Felix Mantilla and Andrea Gaudenzi.</TE>

<TE>   The future of The Grand Prix of the Americas was put in doubt when
a judge ruled Miami illegally granted a new company the right to run
the race and voided the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Michael Genden ruled that the city was
required to have asked for competitive bids before granting the
race's rights to Raceworks LLC for the next 15 to 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   The American Le Mans Series race was scheduled to run April 7.</TE>
<TE>   The CART race in Chicago is back on.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly a month after Chicago Motor Speedway suspended its auto
racing schedule, CART said it will lease the track and hold the Grand
Prix of Chicago on June 30 as originally scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first time CART is promoting one of its own races.
CART will lease the track from the speedway, but it will provide all
of the people to organize the race.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   The USC football team made the final moves in an off-season
shuffling of its coaching staff. Gone are assistants DeWayne Walker,
Wayne Moses and Kirby Wilson, who took jobs with the New York Giants,
Stanford and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, respectively. Tim Davis, a
former Wisconsin assistant, will coach the interior offensive line.
Greg Burns, from Louisville, will handle the secondary and Steve
Sarkisian becomes the quarterbacks coach. Kennedy Pola has switched
to running backs and Lane Kiffin has switched to wide receivers.</TE>
<TE>   Linwood Fiedler seized a substantial lead in the Iditarod Trail

<LD>The NFL will open its season on a weeknight for the first time.</LD>
<LD>   The league confirmed Monday that the 2002 season will start on
Thursday night, Sept. 5, probably with San Francisco at the New York
Giants. ESPN will televise the game at 5:30 p.m. PDT.</LD>
<LD>   The matchup is tentative pending completion of the full schedule,
expected to be announced in about a month.</LD>
<TE>   "This Thursday night game is a great new element for our kickoff
weekend," Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said in a statement. "Kickoff
weekend will now begin on Thursday night and culminate on Monday
night with a great slate of Sunday games in between."</TE>

<TE>   The Miami Dolphins made an offer to trade for Ricky Williams, the
former Heisman Trophy winner for whom the New Orleans Saints gave up
their entire 1999 draft.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Spielman, the Dolphins' director of player personnel, said he
hoped something could be worked out by the end of the week.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried to come up with some things that are reasonable to both
clubs," Spielman said after talking for several hours with Saint
General Manager Randy Mueller at the NFL's scouting combine. "If it's
good enough, maybe it will work. If not, it won't."</TE>
<TE>   The Saints, who used their No. 1 draft pick last season to pick
Deuce McAllister, have been trying since the end of the season to
trade Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Williams has rushed for 3,129 yards in his first three NFL
seasons, although he has been bothered by injuries in all of them.</TE>

<TE>   A plea hearing at Alameda, Calif., for Oakland defensive tackle

<TE>   Elvis Grbac will retire instead of trying to play for another
team, the quarterback's agent said.</TE>
<TE>   Released by the Baltimore Ravens last week, Grbac turned down a
proposal from the Cincinnati Bengals over the weekend. He told his
agent, Jim Steiner, he was ready to quit football.</TE>
<TE>   "He is going to retire," Steiner said. "He's got family issues.
The thought of making an additional move was not appealing to him."</TE>

<TE>   Safety Sam Garnes agreed to contract terms with the New York Jets.
Garnes, who played five seasons with the Giants, agreed to a

<LD>Patrick Roy admits he has added incentive when playing against Martin
Brodeur and the New Jersey Devils.</LD>
<LD>   Roy stopped 23 shots for his 60th shutout, leading the Colorado
Avalanche to a 2-0 victory over New Jersey on Monday night at Denver.</LD>
<LD>   "You want to be at your best every time you play against a good
goaltender like Brodeur," Roy said.</LD>
<TE>   Joe Sakic had a goal and an assist, and Greg de Vries added his
career-best seventh goal of the season for the Avalanche, which

Stanley Cup finals last year.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton 3, Buffalo 0--Rookie Jussi Markkanen stopped 25 shots at
Buffalo, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   The Sabres had a four-game home unbeaten string (3-0-1) end, and
have gone 0-5-1 in their last six meetings against the Oilers.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 4, Boston 1--Jiri Dopita scored twice and Brian
Boucher stopped 21 shots at Boston as the Flyers won in a matchup of
the top two teams in the Eastern Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Byron Dafoe stopped 26 shots for Boston, which is still looking
for its first win in four games since the Olympic break. Flyer
captain Keith Primeau strained his ribs in the second period and
didn't return for the third.</TE>
<TE>   Calgary 5, New York Rangers 3--Jarome Iginla scored three goals
and had an assist at New York to boost his NHL-best points total to
72.</TE>
<TE>   It was Iginla's first NHL hat trick.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 5, Atlanta 3--Oleg Petrov scored a short-handed goal with
1:35 left as the Canadiens recovered from blowing a three-goal lead
at Montreal.</TE>

<KH>Lonnie White ON THE NHL</KH>
<HD>This Is Perfect Chance for Lemieux to Retire</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last week, Pittsburgh owner-captain Mario Lemieux, having helped
Canada to its first Olympic gold medal in 50 years, decided to call
it quits for the rest of the season. Critics questioned his timing,
claiming that he's leaving the Penguins in the lurch.</LD>
<LD>   The real question is, why doesn't Lemieux simply return to
retirement?</LD>
<LD>   By playing at Salt Lake City, Lemieux put what would be marvelous
finishing touches on a remarkable career--one that includes two
Stanley Cup championships and numerous individual honors. He has been
playing in pain caused by a hip injury that has bothered him since
training camp, and the Penguins' playoff chances are fading. So, what
better time to step away for good?</LD>
<TE>   Lemieux, though, sees things differently.</TE>
<TE>   "If I can play 60-70 games a year, I'd love to play for a few more
years; I'd love to play until I was 40," said Lemieux, 36, who last
played a full season in 1996-97. "If I can play most of the games
next year, I'll probably keep playing."</TE>
<TE>   He experienced hip pain during training camp in September, then
had arthroscopic surgery Oct. 29 to remove loose cartilage. He
returned less than two weeks later but played only three games before
sitting out the next two months after doctors advised him to rest.</TE>
<TE>   The six-time NHL scoring champion, already in the Hockey Hall of
Fame, returned Jan. 12, later producing 13 points in a four-game
stretch that was part of a six-game Penguin winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Lemieux, however, seemed bothered by the pain and later said that
he'd sat out some Penguin games so he'd be strong enough to play in
his first Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   That's when some began to complain about his motives.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the fans really agreed with my decision," said Lemieux,
who has six goals and 25 assists for 31 points in 24 games this
season. "There were only a few people out there, and there are always
going to be people who disagree."</TE>
<TE>   By telling everyone that he plans to play next season, Lemieux
knows that he keeps hope alive for Pittsburgh fans, who have not had
much to cheer about recently. The mediocre Penguins are four games
under .500 and probably will be out of the playoffs for the first
time in 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   If Penguin supporters were in denial before about their team's
demise, they shouldn't be any longer. Pittsburgh still plays in the
41-year-old Mellon Arena, the oldest in the NHL, and team officials,
Lemieux among them, are adamant that the Penguins cannot survive
unless they move into a new home soon.</TE>
<TE>   What the Penguins could use is a full-time owner committed to
securing financing for a new arena and turning things around. But
Lemieux doesn't seem ready to return to that role. At least not yet.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm back playing because I want to play," he said, although he
has played in fewer games than in any nonretirement season since
1993-94, when he had back surgery and was limited to 22 games. "It's
not because of [the desire for] a new building. The new building's
going to [have to] happen whether I'm playing or not.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to keep playing for the next 10 years. There's
going to be a team here after I'm done playing. The franchise is
going to need a new arena. Whether I'm on the ice or not, I don't
think that has any effect."</TE>
<TE>   When J.R. Talks....</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia center Jeremy Roenick, known as one of the NHL's most
colorful players, says the league needs more flash to catch up with
the other major sports in terms of fan appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the NBA does it very well by trying to bring the
flamboyancy out in their players," said Roenick, who won a silver
Olympic medal playing for the U.S. last month. "I think players have
to be very friendly in all aspects of the game. There is a time and
place for the game to be played and for the game to be played hard.
But there's also a time and place where the antics and the different
characters, different people can come out.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate the closed-door mentality, the no-smile mentality, the
old-school mentality. The old-school mentality is great with the hard
nose and stuff like that, but I believe that the NHL has, without a
doubt, the most accessible, nicest people in terms of athletes in any
of the major sports."</TE>
<TE>   Roenick hopes that the NHL can capitalize on the fans attracted to
the sport during the Olympics. He said that people need to know more
about the players.</TE>
<TE>   "They would then be more inclined to watch and learn about the
game," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's part of our problem. Getting people to watch and
understand our game.... You know, people say it's boring to watch on
TV. Well, you can't tell me that watching a hockey game is more
boring than watching a baseball game."</TE>
<TE>   Line Shifts</TE>
<TE>   * It will be interesting to see how the Toronto Maple Leafs play
on a crucial four-game trip in the wake of a pregame ceremony that
took a tragic turn.</TE>
<TE>   Art Jackson, 78, the nephew of former Maple Leaf Harvey "Busher"
Jackson, collapsed and died just as he was being introduced before
Toronto's 3-3 tie with Buffalo at Air Canada Centre on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   After winning, 3-2, at Washington on Monday, the Maple Leafs--who
are without injured goaltender Curtis Joseph--will face Detroit,
Montreal and Philadelphia on the trip.</TE>
<TE>   * Washington center Adam Oates will turn 40 in August but he's not
thinking about retirement. Or about being traded. "I don't want to be
a rent-a-player or a guy seen as an insurance policy," said Oates,
who will be an unrestricted free agent this summer.</TE>
<TE>   * New Jersey's Bobby Holik is another player not looking to be
dealt before the league's March 19 trading deadline. Holik recently
said that if the Devils came to him with an offer, he would
definitely listen.</TE>
<TE>   "If they want to make a deal with me, that is something that
should not take more than a day or two," he said.</TE>

<DH>Pac-10 Joins NCAA Majority by Holding a Pre-Tournament
Tournament</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like it or loathe it, the Pacific 10 tournament is back.</LD>
<LD>   The next question is simple: How will it affect NCAA tournament
performance?</LD>
<LD>   Forget the issue of making the NCAA field: Very, very few
deserving teams from major conferences are ever left out.</LD>
<TE>   Focus instead on what the results this week at Staples Center
might foretell.</TE>
<TE>   Will Oregon add the tournament title to its regular-season
championship by playing three consecutive games of pell-mell
basketball only to end up an exhausted No. 2 seed in the West that
stumbles in an NCAA first-round game?</TE>
<TE>   Or will USC storm through the weekend on Sam Clancy's shoulders
and ride that wave all the way back to the Elite Eight?</TE>
<TE>   And how about Arizona and Stanford, those reluctant participants?
They say they're here to win, but will their hearts and the soles of
their sneakers be in it?</TE>
<TE>   One thing can't be denied: The Pac-10 has done just fine without a
tournament, winning 15 NCAA titles, more than any other conference.</TE>
<TE>   But face it, those 10 the Bruins won under John Wooden weren't
because guys such as Lew Alcindor were fresh.</TE>
<TE>   The conference had a sterling run last season, with four teams in
the Sweet 16, three in the Elite Eight and one in the Final Four.</TE>
<TE>   But history shows the previous incarnation of the Pac-10
tournament didn't hurt: The league was 12-12 in NCAA games during its
four-year run from 1987-90, and Arizona made the 1988 Final Four. In
the four years surrounding the original Pac-10 tournament, the
league's NCAA record was 7-14.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the example of the Big Ten, the most recent holdout to
adopt a tournament: In the four years the Big Ten has held its
tournament, Michigan State has won an NCAA title and played in three
Final Fours, and Ohio State and Wisconsin also reached the Final
Four. (In the previous four years, only Minnesota reached the Final
Four.)</TE>
<TE>   "We've done exceptionally well since we adopted the tournament,"
Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany said. "We've won two-thirds of our
games. The two or three years previous, we didn't do so well--but our
conference wasn't as good, either.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you can make a case for not having it too. There were
plenty of years we won the NCAA championship without a tournament.
Indiana won several, Michigan State won, Michigan won."</TE>
<TE>   Same thing goes for UCLA in 1995 and Arizona in '97, the
post-Wooden era Pac-10 national champions.</TE>
<TE>   Part of what Delany likes about the Big Ten tournament--the influx
of cash admittedly among the positives--is that it mimics what's to
come.</TE>
<TE>   "What's good about a conference tournament is it's played at a
neutral site. And the early rounds in a conference tournament are a
lot like the NCAA tournament," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You can hear the ball bounce. There aren't a lot of people in the
stands."</TE>
<TE>   Picture Oregon versus Washington at 1 p.m. Thursday: It's not
going to feel like March Madness when two teams from the Northwest
play at lunch hour in Staples, and Washington already beat Oregon
once.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're not playing well, you're going home in a hurry," said
Delany, a former chairman of the NCAA selection committee. "You can
get a wake-up call--but it's a lot better than getting a wake-up call
the next week."</TE>
<TE>   One thing is clear: While conference tournament winners don't
always go on to greatness, teams rarely win the NCAA championship
without at least reaching their conference final if the league played
a tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Since the field expanded to 48 in 1980--allowing more and more
at-large teams--only three teams that lost in a conference semifinal
have won the NCAA title: Arkansas in 1994, Kansas in '88 and
Villanova in '85. (No quarterfinal loser won the NCAA title.)</TE>
<TE>   Eleven teams won their conference tournament and swept on to the
NCAA title.</TE>
<TE>   Five played in leagues that didn't hold tournaments--Indiana in
1981 and '87, Michigan in '89, UCLA in '95 and Arizona in '97.</TE>
<TE>   And three other teams that won the NCAA championship since 1980
reached their conference final before losing.</TE>
<TE>   An improbable run in a conference tournament occasionally signals
the beginning of something memorable.</TE>
<TE>   One of the greatest underdogs ever, the 1983 North Carolina State
team that beat Houston when Lorenzo Charles dunked Dereck
Whittenburg's airball at the buzzer, started its run by winning the
ACC tournament.</TE>
<TE>   The Wolfpack--seeded fourth in the ACC--beat Wake Forest by one
point in the quarterfinals, edged North Carolina in overtime in the
semifinals and beat Virginia by three in the final. (Of course, maybe
they were tired: They had to dodge an NCAA first-round bullet against
Pepperdine.)</TE>
<TE>   More often, the team that comes from the middle of the pack to win
a conference tournament is indeed exhausted.</TE>
<TE>   It's as if great teams can sustain their effort, but lesser ones
spend every ounce of energy and emotion to grab that tournament
title.</TE>
<TE>   Consider Arkansas in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Razorbacks went 15-14 in the regular season and were ticketed
for the National Invitation Tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Then they pressed and ran their way through the 12-team
Southeastern Conference tournament, winning four games in four days.
(The top four seeds earn a first-round bye.)</TE>
<TE>   Five days later, Arkansas was a first-round loser against Miami,
the first SEC tournament champion to lose in the first round since
1989.</TE>
<TE>   "To play four games back-to-back-to-back-to-back, you've got to
have players and depth ... and then it's another season when you get
to the NCAA," said Mike Anderson, the Razorbacks' interim coach.</TE>
<TE>   The struggles apply to other low-seeded winners as well.</TE>
<TE>   It's often "one and done."</TE>
<TE>   Of the four sixth-seeded teams to win the ACC, three lost their
NCAA first-round games.</TE>
<TE>   And reaching the final can be as exhausting as winning the
title--minus the emotional high.</TE>
<TE>   The 1989 Pac-10 tournament still lingers in Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery's mind.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinal, ranked No. 13 in the nation, beat USC and UCLA to
reach the final against No. 1 Arizona, and lost.</TE>
<TE>   Seeded third in the East Regional with a team led by Todd Lichti,
Stanford was upset in the first round by Siena.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question [fatigue was a factor]," Montgomery said.
"But keep in mind, it ended on Sunday. We were sent East and had to
leave on Tuesday and were headed into exams. And our squad was not
very deep.</TE>
<TE>   "Sunday in the Arizona game, Terry Taylor was in the locker room
with an IV in both arms, trying to replace fluids....</TE>
<TE>   "We were very tired, no question about it."</TE>
<TE>   And yet there is another phenomenon seen in conference
tournaments--the team that seems rejuvenated by an early loss.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, Kansas lost to Kansas State in the semifinals of the Big
Eight tournament.</TE>
<TE>   That turned out to be the start of the road to the NCAA title for
the team led by Danny Manning and Coach Larry Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas regrouped, then conquered the Big Eight in the NCAA
tournament when it ran into Kansas State in the Elite Eight and then
beat Oklahoma--the Big Eight tournament winner--in the national
championship game.</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina went on a similar run two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The Tar Heels were 18-13 after losing in the ACC quarterfinals--a
record that until now amounted to a Tar Heel disaster.</TE>
<TE>   Before even leaving for home, Coach Bill Guthridge put his players
through a grueling practice--rededicating a team that would upset No.
1-seeded Stanford on the way to North Carolina's most unlikely Final
Four.</TE>
<TE>   So for the early losers this week--let's say the loser of that
UCLA-California quarterfinal--it could be an opportunity to rest, to
practice, to recover from an ugly stretch run.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have hit a valley, you have to get it back together,"
Delany said. "The conference tournament gives you a stop sign, or a
yellow. It exposes you in a tournament environment. You can go home,
practice, regroup."</TE>
<TE>   For a couple of teams--Arizona State and Washington--the Pac-10
tournament will be a last-ditch chance to somehow win it all and grab
the automatic NCAA bid.</TE>
<TE>   The rest are fighting for seeding, for momentum, for pride.</TE>
<TE>   "There are different motivations," said Duke Coach Mike
Krzyzewski, whose teams have won the last three ACC tournaments--a
title that historically gives teams a 53% chance of reaching the
Final Four.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is going into the conference tournament trying to lose,"
Krzyzewski said. "I do think some people's motivation is higher than
others. The highest motivation may be someone who doesn't think
they're getting in. They have to win. Sometimes, there are teams that
just want to get the season over and are not motivated at all.</TE>
<TE>   "Conference tournaments are great, because they add to the
excitement and anticipation of where we're going."</TE>
<TE>   That's the NCAA tournament--ultimately the only one that matters.</TE>

<HD>TEAM CAPSULES</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA</LD>
<LD>   Coach: Steve Lavin, six seasons.</LD>
<LD>   Record: 19-10 overall, 11-7 in Pac-10 (sixth).</LD>
<TE>   National ranking: Not ranked.</TE>
<TE>   RPI: 21.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Jason Kapono (16.9), Billy Knight (14.1).</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounder: Dan Gadzuric (7.6).</TE>
<TE>   Why they can win the tournament: With four returning starters and
a highly touted freshman class, the Bruins were picked during the
preseason to win the conference. Victories over No. 1 Kansas, No. 6
Alabama, No. 15 Arizona and No. 16 Stanford prove they are capable of
beating anyone. UCLA is 6-3 against opponents ranked in the top 25 at
game time. Dan Gadzuric is playing extremely well and could provide
the dominant force needed in a tournament format. The Bruins'
superior depth could give them an edge if they make the final.</TE>
<TE>   Why they won't: UCLA has gone 1-1 in eight consecutive weeks, a
discouraging stretch of inconsistency that does not bode well for
winning three games in three days against top conference competition.
The inexperience of freshman point guards Cedric Bozeman and Ryan
Walcott is likely to be evident. The recent inability of Kapono and
Knight to get enough open shots is also a problem. A victory over Cal
is likely; a victory over Arizona is not.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: UCLA will win one, lose one in the tournament, become a
No. 6 or 7 seed in the NCAA tournament and be shipped to Dallas or
Pittsburgh for the first round.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CALIFORNIA</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Ben Braun, six seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Record: 21-7 overall, 12-6 in Pac-10 (tie for second).</TE>
<TE>   National ranking: No. 25</TE>
<TE>   RPI: 27.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Joe Shipp (14.3), Amit Tamir (11.5).</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounder: Jamal Sampson (6.7).</TE>
<TE>   Why they can win the tournament: Until a 46-point loss to Arizona
on Saturday, the Bears were hot, having defeated UCLA and USC at home
and Arizona State on the road. Cal has no individual in the top 10 in
conference scoring or rebounding, but seven different players led the
team in scoring in the last six games (including one tie.) All seven
will need to contribute mightily for the Bears to win three days in a
row.</TE>
<TE>   Why they won't: Cal is only 4-6 on the road and lacks a
star-quality player who can be relied on to make the big shots night
after night. The Bears could squeeze past UCLA by making
three-pointers over the Bruin zone defense, but Arizona would be next
and the Wildcats clearly own a psychological edge after the
regular-season finale.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Cal will lose to UCLA in the first round, become a No. 8
seed in the NCAA tournament and will play its first two games in
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ARIZONA</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Lute Olson, 19 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Record: 19-9 overall, 12-6 in Pac-10 (tie for second).</TE>
<TE>   National ranking: No. 15.</TE>
<TE>   RPI: 7.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Jason Gardner (20.6), Luke Walton (15.1).</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounder: Luke Walton (7.4).</TE>
<TE>   Why they can win the tournament: Under Olson, the Wildcats have
proved annually that they can gear up and play extremely well against
top competition and in a tournament format. There is also the
motivation of gaining a No. 2 seeding in the NCAA tournament, a
strong possibility if Arizona secures the automatic berth.
Tournament-savvy veterans Jason Gardner and Luke Walton will make a
difference late in close games.</TE>
<TE>   Why they won't: Olson is vocal in his disdain for the conference
tournament, which he believes forces players to miss too much class
time. The Wildcats might be somewhat unfocused as a result, and they
aren't good enough to win three in a row without their best effort.
The uneven recent play of freshman center Channing Frye is another
concern.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Arizona will defeat Arizona State and UCLA to advance to
the tournament final and could gain as high as a No. 2 seeding in the
NCAA tournament, playing its first two games in Albuquerque.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ARIZONA STATE</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Bob Evans, four seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Record: 14-13 overall, 7-11 in Pac-10 (fifth).</TE>
<TE>   National ranking: Not ranked.</TE>
<TE>   RPI: 89.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Chad Prewitt (17.6), Curtis Millage (13.4).</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounder: Chad Prewitt (6.8).</TE>
<TE>   Why they can win the tournament: Prewitt has evolved into a
dangerous weapon, a center who can score from the perimeter as well
as bang inside. Getting injured guard Kenny Crandall and forward
Awvee Storey back is key to having the depth necessary to have any
chance at winning three in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Why they won't: The Sun Devils have lost three in a row, each to a
ranked opponent. There is no reason to believe a three-victory
about-face is on the horizon. An unlikely upset of Arizona would
merely delay the inevitable elimination, although one victory would
assure the Sun Devils of finishing above .500.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Arizona State will lose to Arizona in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   STANFORD</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Mike Montgomery, 16 seasons</TE>
<TE>   Record: 19-8 overall, 12-6 in Pac-10 (tie for second)</TE>
<TE>   National ranking: 16th</TE>
<TE>   RPI: 29th</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Casey Jacobsen (22.2), Curtis Borchardt (17.0)</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounder: Borchardt (11.3)</TE>
<TE>   Why they can win the tournament: Jacobsen is the one player in the
conference who can take over a game with his scoring. He needs to
take over three in a row and be complemented with the jump shooting
and intimidating defensive presence of conference rebounding leader
Borchardt. The rest of the team just needs to get out of the way and
not do anything to damage its chances.</TE>
<TE>   Why they won't: Stanford doesn't have the depth to win three in a
row. Expecting Jacobsen and Borchardt to carry the load game after
game is not realistic.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The Cardinal will lose for the third time this season to
USC, losing their chance at a No. 5 seeding in the NCAA tournament
and a berth in Albuquerque. Instead, Stanford will be a No. 7 and be
sent to Greenville, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Henry Bibby, six seasons</TE>
<TE>   Record: 20-8 overall, 12-6 in Pac-10 (tie for second)</TE>
<TE>   National ranking: No. 22</TE>
<TE>   RPI: 31st</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Sam Clancy (19.2), Errick Craven (12.1)</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounder: Clancy (9.8)</TE>
<TE>   Why they can win the tournament: The same three--Sam Clancy, David
Bluthenthal and Brandon Granville--who keyed last season's run to the
Elite Eight are now seniors and capable of leading a three-victory
blitz through the Pac-10 tournament. Errick Craven, Desmon Farmer and
others gives USC a dangerous supporting cast. And there is no lack of
motivation for the Trojans, not after Oregon won the regular-season
title by beating them on their home floor. USC will enjoy something
close to a home-court advantage, but only if its tepid fan base shows
up.</TE>
<TE>   Why they won't: Stanford is a very difficult first-round match-up,
as the Trojans have readily admitted. USC defeated the Cardinal twice
already, and there is truth to the axiom that beating the same team
three times in one season is very difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The Trojans will slow Casey Jacobsen and slip past
Stanford, gain revenge by beating Oregon, then run out of gas in the
final and lose to Arizona. USC will gain a No. 6 seeding in the NCAA
tournament and play the first two games in Chicago or Washington D.C.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   OREGON</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Ernie Kent, five seasons</TE>
<TE>   Record: 22-7 overall, 14-4 in Pac-10 (first)</TE>
<TE>   National ranking: No. 9</TE>
<TE>   RPI: 28th</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Fredrrick Jones (18.6), Luke Jackson (15.8)</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounder: Robert Johnson (7.4)</TE>
<TE>   Why they can win the tournament: Ridnour, a savvy point guard can
control the tempo in any environment and gets all his teammates
involved. Jones is deserving of the conference most valuable player
award and is perhaps the best NBA prospect. He has also made all the
big shots lately. Center Chris Christoffersen is improved enough to
keep opposing centers such as Stanford's Curtis Borchardt and UCLA's
Dan Gadzuric from dominating. Down the stretch, Oregon separated
itself from the rest of the Pac 10 to win the regular-season title by
two games. That momentum could continue.</TE>
<TE>   Why they won't: Asking Oregon to return to Southern California and
win three in a row a week after knocking off USC and UCLA is
unrealistic. These are the Ducks, not Duke.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Oregon will survive upset-minded Washington, but will
fall to USC, a good enough showing to earn a No. 4 seeding in the
NCAA tournament and play the first two rounds in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WASHINGTON</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Bob Bender, nine seasons</TE>
<TE>   Record: 11-17 overall, 5-13 in Pac-10 (eighth)</TE>
<TE>   National ranking: Not ranked.</TE>
<TE>   RPI: 105th</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Doug Wrenn (19.7), Curtis Allen (12.2)</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounder: David Dixon (7.7)</TE>
<TE>   Why they can win the tournament: The Huskies rivaled UCLA as the
biggest disappointment in the conference, and this is a chance at
atonement. Washington has defeated first-place Oregon, so anything is
possible.</TE>
<TE>   Why they won't: There are too many good teams in this conference
for the underachieving Huskies to possibly win three in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Washington will lose to Oregon in the first round and
attention will turn to Bender's job security.</TE>

<DH>College basketball: Arizona's Olson and Stanford's
Montgomery didn't see the need for conference tournament.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is the party Arizona and Stanford didn't want to attend.</LD>
<LD>   Will they still display their winning personalities once they're
here?</LD>
<LD>   "I know as far as we're concerned, we're certainly going to try to
win whatever games we're in," Arizona Coach Lute Olson said. The
Pacific 10 Conference men's basketball tournament will be reborn
Thursday at Staples Center, 12 years after its original four-year run
from 1987-90.</LD>
<TE>   The dissenting votes in an 8-2 decision two years ago when the
tournament was reinstituted for a six-year run in Los Angeles were
Arizona and Stanford, longtime opponents of the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Now it's time to play ball in a tournament that could mean as much
as $300,000 for each school under a lucrative television deal.</TE>
<TE>   Plagued by poor attendance when it was held in Los Angeles at
Pauley Pavilion and the Forum in 1987 and '89, the tournament is
expected to do much better at Staples, with fewer than 1,000 tickets
remaining--and none in the lower bowl, a conference spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery said his team is ready.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question, you don't go into it with any other thought
but to try to win it, because that's what we all do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The record says Arizona and Stanford put their objections aside
come tournament time: Arizona won three of the previous four Pac-10
tournaments and was 9-1 during that time.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford reached the 1989 Pac-10 final and was 4-4 over the four
years, third behind UCLA's 6-3 record, which included the 1987 title.</TE>
<TE>   "I really have two objections to it," Olson said. "That is, we've
been beating one another over the head here for 18 games. It makes no
sense to me to play--for whoever goes to the finals--three additional
games.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm concerned about teams that go to the finals in this
conference tournament and how much that's going to take out of them
headed to the NCAA.</TE>
<TE>   "But the worst part of it is from an academic standpoint. I detest
having our players have to miss three days of school at a very
critical time when they're dealing with midterms."</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery shares Olson's views, but they were in the minority.</TE>
<TE>   The final result is that the Ivy League is now the only Division I
basketball conference that doesn't play a tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "I think some people were uncomfortable being compared to the Ivy
League," Montgomery said.</TE>
<TE>   "At Stanford, we weren't."</TE>

<HD>Arizona State Surprises Stanford</HD>
<DH>Pac-10 women: Sun Devils upset No. 2 Cardinal, 70-63, in
tournament final for automatic NCAA bid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EUGENE, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Arizona State couldn't beat Stanford at home or on the road. The only
place left to try was a neutral court.</LD>
<LD>   That must be the Cardinal's weak spot.</LD>
<LD>   At least it was Monday night when Arizona State upset
second-ranked Stanford, 70-63, at Oregon's McArthur Court to win the
inaugural women's Pacific 10 tournament.</LD>
<TE>   In earning the Pac-10's automatic bid to the tournament, Arizona
State (24-8) ended a five-game losing streak to the Cardinal (30-2).
It was also Stanford's first loss to a Pac-10 opponent this season,
ending a 23-game conference winning streak dating to last season. A
bigger loss for the Cardinal may come later this week when the NCAA
pairings are announced. Stanford was banking on a tournament victory
to secure a No. 1 seeding in the West regional.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was sweet for Arizona State Coach Charli Turner
Thorne, who played for Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer from 1985-88.
Since becoming the Arizona State coach, Thorne was 1-9 against
VanDerveer before Monday's game.</TE>
<TE>   Amanda Levens, who rousted Arizona State from a four-point
halftime deficit, led the Sun Devils with 22 points, of which 17 came
in the second half. Enjoli Izidor had 20 for Stanford. Nicole Powell,
voted the tournament's most valuable player, added 19 points and 10
rebounds Monday, but she made only four of 17 shots and did not score
for Stanford after the 10:40 mark of the second half.</TE>
<TE>   There were 10 lead changes in the first half, and the biggest lead
either team could muster was Stanford's 19-12 spread after 10
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Powell did most of her first-half damage from the foul line, where
she was eight for nine, including three free throws at the end of the
half to give Stanford a 35-31 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinal scored a quick five points to open the second half
with a 40-31 edge, but Arizona State put together a 22-7 spurt to go
in front, 53-47, with 8 1/2 minutes to play. The closest the Cardinal
got was 53-51 with 7:08 remaining.</TE>

<LD>Eddie Steward, the football coach at Santa Ana Valley for six
seasons, has been fired, the school announced Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm shocked, and pretty much crushed," Steward said. "I met with
the principal [Antonio Espinoza] and athletic director [Leon Smith]
in January, and wasn't given any indication something like this would
happen.</LD>
<LD>   "There were some issues we discussed, but they were issues we all
agreed could be resolved.</LD>
<TE>   "Me not being the head coach was never discussed, which is why
it's such a shock to me."</TE>
<TE>   Steward had a 23-34 record in six years, 16-15 the last three,
including consecutive 4-6 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the Falcons were 8-3, 4-1 in the Century League.</TE>

<LD>Scoring 1,000 points in a career is notable for a high school player,
but the Rim of the World girls' basketball team finished its season
with four who accomplished the feat: Jessica Jennings scored 1,393
points, Kirsten Muir 1,213, Cassandra Markovich 1,022 and Stephanie
Hanifan 1,013.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know if any team in California has had four players with
1,000 points," Coach Karen Rudolph said, a sentiment confirmed by
Mark Tennis, editor of Cal-Hi Sports.</LD>
<LD>   "In 25 years that Rim has competed in girls' basketball, we've
never had one 1,000-point scorer, and that means you've played a
solid three, if not four years and averaged about double-figures all
four years."</LD>
<TE>   Markovich and Hanifan needed big games in the regular-season
finale to get close. Markovich scored a season-high 20 against
Serrano and Hanifan scored a career-high 29. They went over 1,000
points in a second-round Southern Section playoff game against Garden
Grove Pacifica, but were eliminated by Newbury Park in the Division
III-AA quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   Hanifan is a 5-foot-10 center/forward, the only one of the group
who isn't a guard. She played three seasons on varsity, unlike her
teammates, who each played four. She began the year with 616 points,
and was the last to reach the plateau.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I felt a little pressure," Hanifan said. "We all discussed
it as a team a few games before. [The Serrano game] was our senior
night, and we were discussing how we thought it would be an
accomplishment for the whole team if all four of us got it."</TE>
<TE>   Lone Pilgrim: Amber Cunningham is a one-woman scoring machine for
Division V-A power L.A. Pilgrim. Cunningham has 2,034 points in her
career, and with a 67-43 win over Hemet Baptist Christian on Friday,
she has won four section titles in four seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a very unselfish player," said Coach Kevin Blue, pointing
to Cunningham's career totals: 2,084 points and more than 420
assists.</TE>

<LD>You may have missed it, but talented Times' columnist Bill Plaschke
was selected as California Sportswriter of the Year recently, which
got me to crying, prompting Plaschke to whip out his notebook just in
case I had a sob story to tell.</LD>
<LD>   As you know there's no one better in the country locating the down
and out and then delivering a stirring tear-jerker than Plaschke. I
believe he can hear an ambulance from as far away as a thousand
miles, which got me to thinking I'll never win a writing award unless
Plaschke is more than a thousand miles away, and I become more in
tune with the miserable souls living in our own backyard.</LD>
<LD>   So I begin my new approach to sportswriting and winning awards by
giving you the compelling real-life struggles of some of our local
pitchers, who by the sound of their financial concerns, fear they
might soon be living on the streets of Anaheim.</LD>
<TE>   In the gut-wrenching words of Angel pitcher Jarrod Washburn, "It's
not good."</TE>
<TE>   I'm afraid it's even worse than that, and I wonder now where the
collection boxes should be placed. The Angels have told Washburn he
will have to make both ends meet on a salary of only $350,000 this
year. The cold-hearted buzzards.</TE>
<TE>   You've seen the cars parked in the players' lot at Edison Field.
How's a guy supposed to give the team six quality innings every five
days that he works while worrying how he's going to buy gas for the
Cadillac Escalade the local dealer has loaned him?</TE>
<TE>   If I can find the 7-Eleven where Washburn's wife is working, I
hope to interview her.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WASHBURN WENT to the mound 30 times last season and completed one
game. It makes you wonder if he'll have the motivation to do just as
well this season on only $350,000.</TE>
<TE>   As we know from watching the Lakers, it's difficult for
professional athletes to work up a sweat every game. Now you factor
in the disrespect shown a player who is paid only $350,000, and you
have to wonder how the Angels will perform this season, knowing that
in addition to Washburn, they have decided to make Scott Schoeneweis
and Ramon Ortiz also toil for next to nothing.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are going to pay Schoeneweis, who went 10-11 last
season and gave up more than five runs a game, only $325,000 this
year. It makes you wonder why a guy should bother trying to win more
games than he loses.</TE>
<TE>   As for Ortiz, every season it seems as if he's suddenly three
years older, and if there's anybody on the Angels who has to concern
himself with making it on Social Security some time soon, I guess
it's this old-timer.</TE>
<TE>   "I need to take care of my family," Ortiz said. "I'm not happy."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels offered Ortiz a four-year deal with a salary of
$450,000 this season, but that wasn't enough to take care of his
family. My wife and two daughters just charge everything on their
Sears cards; I'm not happy, but if I got paid more they would charge
everything on their Nordstrom cards.</TE>
<TE>   Because Ortiz wouldn't agree to a multiyear deal, the Angels gave
him a one-year salary of $270,000, and I presume discount tickets to
Disneyland to take care of his family.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger pitcher Matt Herges, meanwhile, is going to be stuck making
$370,000 this season, and aren't you glad you're not a miserable
major league baseball player.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very disappointing.... I'm a human being," Herges said, and
I know how emotional this must be for everyone. "It's tough, and it's
going to take a while to get over it."</TE>
<TE>   A day later, the newspaper reported Herges had gained perspective
after a visit from his cancer-surviving brother. (Plaschke was at the
Olympics--more than a thousand miles away from Vero Beach, Fla.--and
unable to do this part of the story.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW SOME people aren't going to think these guys are as bad off as
they make it seem. Some might even think it's a benefit never going
through an airport--the bus taking you onto the tarmac to your
charter flight, your luggage taken care of for you and placed in your
hotel room, your clothes given to you free by such companies as "No
Fear," everything from TVs to DVDs to hams and turkeys placed in your
locker through the course of the season--but that doesn't pay for the
groceries.</TE>
<TE>   The $77 per diem they give baseball players on the road helps with
that, but there's still only so many ways you can stretch $350,000.</TE>
<TE>   You make $350,000, I know you don't live in my neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW I understand why Plaschke seems so chipper all the
time--everyone he writes about is always worse off than he is.</TE>
<TE>   But I must say after listening to these baseball players, there is
something invigorating about a good sob story. I think I'll try to be
more sympathetic to the needs of athletes like these more often.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SOMEONE IN the NBA front office must really know what Reggie
Miller said to Kobe Bryant and it must have been a real
doozy--something as low down and troubling as the punch Kobe took at
Miller, because there's no other way to justify the two of them
getting the same punishment. Kobe and Miller aren't saying what was
said, and I wouldn't want to guess--in case I was right.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Paul L.</TE>
<TE>   "Regarding your statement in Sunday's column: 'The made-for-TV
movie "A Season on the Brink" with Brian Dennehy playing Bobby
Knight, will be simulcast on ESPN and ESPN2 at the same time... '
Could you explain to me how it could be simulcast at different
times?"</TE>
<TE>   And insult your intelligence?</TE>

<HD>Hines Scores With Lavin as a Selfless, Vocal Leader</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rico Hines went nearly the length of the floor after making a steal
against Oregon, rising up forcefully for a layup, the ball banking
off the backboard and falling through the net.</LD>
<LD>   Anyone who didn't know better would believe Hines was good for
several fastbreak baskets every game. In reality, it was only the
10th field goal of the season for the fifth-year senior guard who
averages nearly 18 minutes a game.</LD>
<LD>   Hines has not scored more than one field goal in a game, is 0 for
11 on three-point attempts and two for seven on free throws. He has
been scoreless in 15 of the 26 games in which he has played and only
once has he scored more than two points, making a field goal and two
free throws in a victory at Stanford on Feb. 23.</LD>
<TE>   Still, Coach Steve Lavin considers Hines invaluable because he
plays sound defense, takes charges and rarely commits a turnover.</TE>
<TE>   "Rico is a selfless player and a vocal leader," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been an asset all season and his work ethic rubs off on his
teammates."</TE>
<TE>   Statistically, though, Hines will never stand out. Although he did
reach a milestone against Oregon on Saturday: he got his first
blocked shot of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Knight might be the most improved Bruin, and at 14.1 points
a game he is the second-leading scorer behind Jason Kapono.</TE>
<TE>   But the fifth-year senior has logged far more minutes than at any
time in his career and he seems to be wearing down. His defense has
been suspect and it is increasingly difficult for him to get his
signature three-point shot from the corner.</TE>
<TE>   Knight has been held to fewer than 10 points in three of the last
five games, including a four-point effort against Oregon on Saturday.
Before the recent lull he had scored in double figures in 21 of 23
games.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I need to pick it up for the [Pac-10] tournament," he
said. "I feel fine. This is the time we've all been waiting for."</TE>

<HD>Bibby Has Doubts Now About the Tournament</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Now that his team is becoming one of the "haves" in the Pacific 10
Conference, USC Coach Henry Bibby is having second thoughts about the
virtues of a postseason league tournament.</LD>
<LD>   Bibby is not as vehemently opposed to the idea as Arizona's Lute
Olson or Stanford's Mike Montgomery, but he is hedging.</LD>
<LD>   "Three games in a row makes it tough to keep everybody healthy,"
Bibby said of what would be required to win the tournament. "I kind
of wanted it before because we always got a little bit better as the
year went on and it could save your year by knocking off one of the
top seeds.</LD>
<TE>   "If I had to vote again, I'd probably vote against it."</TE>
<TE>   Critics have charged that a league tournament for a conference as
strong as the Pac-10 can only hurt its top teams and their NCAA
seedings through possible injuries and upsets. Olson and Montgomery
have complained about more missed class time. The Pac-10 will play a
tournament for the first time since 1990.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A rivalry developed in December at the Forum when Pepperdine Coach
Paul Westphal, annoyed with USC calling numerous timeouts at the end
of the game, mockingly showed the game-winning three-point play he
had drawn up to Bibby from down the sideline.</TE>
<TE>   Monday, a notch was added to the rivalry when the National Assn.
of Basketball Coaches named Westphal and Bibby District 15 co-coaches
of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "That makes me feel good," Bibby said. "That brings a smile to my
face."</TE>
<TE>   The NABC also named Trojan senior forward Sam Clancy as a
third-team All-American.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   X-rays taken Monday of Kostas Charissis' broken left ankle showed
enough healing that the junior center will ditch his crutches
Wednesday and begin putting pressure on the foot. Charissis would not
play until sometime in the NCAA tournament.</TE>

<HD>Gonzaga Earns WCC Berth</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Dickau gets hot in second half of 96-90
victory. Pepperdine will have to wait.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Pepperdine faced some big questions before its showdown with Gonzaga
in the West Coast Conference tournament final Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   After lackluster performances against lowly Portland and St.
Mary's in the first two rounds, could the Waves make a splash against
the nation's No. 6-ranked team?</LD>
<LD>   Or would they ebb meekly under a red sea of deafening cheers from
Gonzaga's crimson-clad fans and a barrage of rainbow three-pointers
from the Bulldogs' expert marksmen, guards Dan Dickau and Blake
Stepp?</LD>
<TE>   For a half, Pepperdine had the right answers, but then Dickau and
the Bulldogs stepped up for a 96-90 victory and the automatic NCAA
tournament berth.</TE>
<TE>   Dickau was held to two points in the first half, but he made eight
shots in a row at one point in the second half and wound up with 29
points.</TE>
<TE>   Dickau carried the Bulldogs back from a seven-point deficit, after
Devin Montgomery's three-point play gave Pepperdine a 61-54 lead with
12:37 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzaga, which won its 14th in a row, heads into the tournament
with a 29-3 record. The Waves (22-8) must wait until Sunday to learn
their fate, though they appear deserving of joining the 64-team field
because of a demanding nonconference schedule, victories over UCLA,
No. 22 USC and Gonzaga; having more than 20 wins and an RPI of 51.</TE>
<TE>   Dickau, a 6-foot senior, capped his run of eight consecutive
baskets by making a three-pointer while falling down and being fouled
by Jimmy Miggins. He made the free throw to complete a four-point
play and give Gonzaga an 83-72 lead with 5:21 left.</TE>
<TE>   "Their big men gave us some hard screens, and [Dickau] got the
looks he needed," Miggins said. "He can shoot it, so he knocked them
down."</TE>
<TE>   Miggins, perhaps mirroring the Waves' frustration, pushed Dickau
down late in the game and was called for an intentional foul. Dickau
made one of two free throws for a 93-87 lead with 43.8 seconds left
and possession to the Bulldogs.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel we can get in and get a good seed, even though we lost
tonight," Miggins said. "I think we can play with anyone in the
country."</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine appeared up to the challenge in the opening minutes of
the game. Despite committing turnovers the first three times they
touched the ball, the Waves matched the Bulldogs basket for basket,
kept Dickau and Stepp in check, and took a one-point halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzaga went ahead early behind center Cory Violette and forward
Zach Gourde, a pair of 6-foot-8, 250-pounders who attacked the Waves'
interior defense. They combined for the Bulldogs' first 13 points,
and Stepp followed with a three-point basket for a 16-12 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine hung close behind junior guard Devin Montgomery, who
made three three-pointers and scored 11 in the first half to help
stake the Waves to a 45-44 halftime lead. Montgomery finished with 27
points.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Dickau struggled. The WCC's player of the year made
only one of five shots, misfiring on both of his three-point
attempts, and had only two points by halftime. Violette scored all of
his 16 points in the first half, and Gourde had 13.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine and Gonzaga shared the regular-season WCC title, losing
only to each other in conference play. Pepperdine prevailed, 88-79,
on Jan. 18 in Malibu, and Gonzaga won the rematch, 91-78, on Feb. 16
in Spokane, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   Rebounding was a key in both games. In their victory, the Waves
held a 47-33 rebounding edge, with more than half (19) coming on the
offensive end. The next time, Gonzaga won the battle of the boards,
45-32. The Bulldogs entered the WCC tournament leading the nation
with a plus-9.4 average rebounding margin.</TE>
<TE>   Monday, the Bulldogs had a 43-37 rebounding edge, and they rode it
into the NCAA tournament.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Monique Currie scored a career-high 30 points and Alana Beard added
25 as the third-ranked Duke Blue Devils became the first women's team
to complete a perfect run through the Atlantic Coast Conference with
an 87-80 win over No. 16 North Carolina in the tournament
championship Monday night at Greensboro, N.C.</LD>
<LD>   The win extended the Blue Devils' school-record win streak to 18
and probably secured a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament for a team
that went 16-0 in league play and won its third straight ACC crown.</LD>
<LD>   "Even when we went 16-0, I don't think we could really appreciate
it because we had this next goal right in front of us that we had to
get ready for," Duke Coach Gail Goestenkors said. "This is such a
tremendous league, and to be able to run the table is something."</LD>
<TE>   Beard, the ACC's leading scorer, was quiet most of the night, but
saved her best for late.</TE>
<TE>   The sophomore guard scored 11 straight down the stretch as Duke
took control with three minutes left.</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded Duke (27-3) beat the second-seeded Tar Heels (24-8) by
20 and 15 during the season, but this one wasn't easy as the Blue
Devils turned it over 21 times.</TE>
<TE>   OTHER TOURNAMENTS</TE>
<TE>   Big East--No. 1 Connecticut (32-0) scored the first 19 points and
made 14 of its first 16 shots at Piscataway, N.J., in blowing out
Villanova, 83-39, in the biggest semifinal victory in the history of
the conference tournament.... In the other semifinal, Jessalyn Deveny
set career highs with 20 points and 10 rebounds to lead No. 20 Boston
College to a 67-48 victory over Syracuse. The final is tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Big Ten--Heather Cassady scored 21 points and Erin McGinnis added
17 as Indiana (17-13) upset No. 23 Penn State, 75-72, at
Indianapolis, to win the Big Ten tournament championship and earn its
first NCAA bid since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Conference USA--Valerie King scored 23 points as No. 21 Cincinnati
ended Tulane's three-year reign as Conference USA women's tournament
champions with a 68-56 victory at Chicago. Laura Wilder had 15 points
and K.B. Sharp added 14 for Cincinnati (26-4), which lost to the
Green Wave in last year's championship final.</TE>
<TE>   Sun Belt--Gergana Slavtcheva had 27 points and 10 rebounds to lead
No. 25 Florida International to an 80-65 victory over Denver in the
semifinals of the Sun Belt tournament at New Orleans. Today in the
championship game, Florida International (25-5) will play North Texas
(21-7), which beat Western Kentucky, 84-52.</TE>

<LD>A 19-year-old ward of the California Youth Authority from San
Bernardino County died after collapsing during a basketball game at
the Ventura Youth Correctional Facility.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County sheriff's and coroner's officials were working
Monday to determine what caused his death Sunday night. His name had
not been released by Monday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   "Witnesses confirmed no one was even near him when he collapsed,"
said sheriff's spokesman Eric Nishimoto. "So there's nothing
suspicious or criminal from what we've found."</LD>
<TE>   CYA officials said only that about 7:20 p.m. Sunday, the man was
transported from the game at the Camarillo facility to St. John's
Regional Medical Center in Oxnard, but that hospital workers were
unable to resuscitate him.</TE>

<HD>Medicaid Ax Is Falling as Recession Saps States</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BELLEVILLE, Ill.
</DL>
<LD>Across the nation, state governments spend nearly as much money on
health insurance for the poor as they do on public schools--more than on
welfare, prisons and roads combined. And the tab keeps rising, fast.</LD>
<LD>   Their budgets squeezed tight by recession, lawmakers in state after
state have had enough. They are moving to cut some people off Medicaid
insurance and to trim benefits for those who remain.</LD>
<LD>   Federal law requires states to provide basic health coverage for poor
kids, pregnant women and the most desperately needy disabled adults. But
most legislatures have expanded Medicaid far beyond those core groups,
reaching to cover low-income working families and people with
extraordinary medical bills, such as AIDS patients or transplant
recipients.</LD>
<TE>   Some states, California among them, still are looking to broaden
Medicaid's reach. But many others are frantic to scale back a program
that eats up close to 20% of state spending. At their annual meeting last
week, the nation's governors were unanimous in declaring Medicaid's cost
the most urgent crisis they face. Just how grave the problem is became
clear Friday, when Mississippi's Medicaid program went broke. Lawmakers
there were unable to come up with the money to pay for medical care for
the poor.</TE>
<TE>   Patients "are calling me asking, are they going to be able to see
their doctor? Are they going to get their prescriptions filled?
Unfortunately, the only answer to those questions is, 'I hope so.' There
is no guarantee," said Rica Lewis-Payton, director of Mississippi
Medicaid.</TE>
<TE>   Added Dennis Braddock, who directs Washington state's program: "There
needs to be a total rethinking of Medicaid and who it's intended to
serve."</TE>
<TE>   The rethinking has begun.</TE>
<TE>   In Vermont, low-income senior citizens soon may have to buy dentures
on their own or go without. In North Carolina, Medicaid no longer will
cover infant circumcision. In Washington, 150,000 children may lose
health insurance altogether. And in Utah, families with annual incomes as
low as $7,500 will have to pay a few dollars for each doctor's visit, up
to $500 a year.</TE>
<TE>   In Florida, disabled construction worker Oliver Hill Sr. faces the
prospect of trying to pay for his own eyeglasses for the first time since
he went on Medicaid. The 59-year-old knows he won't be able to do it.
With the special lenses he needs to shield his glare-sensitive eyes,
glasses cost more than $200. "By the end of the month, I don't even have
enough for a $2 co-pay for my doctor," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Illinois, Republican Gov. George Ryan is taking a different tack:
Instead of cutting benefits, he has told medical providers that the state
will pay them less for treating the indigent.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect does not so much enrage nursing home owner Steven Wolf as
it leaves him speechless. Already, he says, he is losing more than $20 a
day on each of the 115 or so Medicaid patients at his Calvin Johnson Care
Center--a worn but cheery nursing home in Belleville, a blue-collar
suburb of St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   The medical staff and the housekeepers, the liver lunches and the
scrambled eggs on request, the balloon volleyball games, the pet therapy,
the concerts of patriotic music--it all costs him close to $107 per
patient per day. Medicaid pays him $86. And the governor has proposed
slashing that by nearly 9%.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's possible," Wolf said.</TE>
<TE>   His words echo in state after state, as advocates for low-income
patients look at proposed cuts with horror.</TE>
<TE>   Missouri Gov. Bob Holden, a Democrat, wants to eliminate in-home
services for 9,000 disabled residents who need help bathing and eating
but who prefer to live on their own rather than in an institution.</TE>
<TE>   Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a Republican, wants adults with catastrophic
illnesses to pay their own medical bills until they have sunk into
extreme poverty. His plan would leave a single adult with less than $180
a month for rent, food and other living expenses.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just impossible," concludes Anne Swerlick, an attorney at
Florida Legal Services, which works on behalf of low-income people.</TE>
<TE>   But state lawmakers and Medicaid administrators throw the same phrase
right back at their critics. It's not possible, they say, for Medicaid to
do so much for so many. Not if there is to be money left over to improve
schools and fix highways and protect children from abuse, to lower taxes
and build parks. Not in this economy.</TE>
<TE>   Look at the numbers in Illinois: When planning for this year's budget
began, state analysts expected $900 million in revenue growth. Then came
Sept. 11. Tourism plunged; the economy tanked. The new growth estimate:
$250 million.</TE>
<TE>   To cover the gap, Ryan has proposed cutting 3,800 state jobs, closing
two prisons and cutting a variety of services. Medicaid was hit
especially hard. In an emergency measure last fall, Ryan cut the fees
hospitals collect for treating Medicaid patients by 13%. His new budget
proposes another 13% cut in hospital fees--plus deep reductions for other
health-care providers.</TE>
<TE>   Those providers are putting up a fight, arguing that nursing homes and
hospitals will close if Medicaid fees fall too low. Budget director
George Hovanec counters that there are few alternatives. To squeeze the
same savings from other programs, Illinois would have to close 10 prisons
or kick out half the children receiving subsidized day care.</TE>
<TE>   It's the same story elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Medicaid covers 40 million Americans. It pays for 1 in 3 births and
for nearly two-thirds of nursing home patients. It's the single biggest
budget item for many states--and thus an easy target for cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally speaking, when large reductions are needed, you do what
Willie Sutton said was his reason for robbing banks: You go where the
money is," said Glen Rosselli, undersecretary of the California
Department of Health and Human Services.</TE>
<TE>   Medicaid is vulnerable as well because so much of the program is
discretionary. Nearly two-thirds of all Medicaid spending is for benefits
defined by the federal government as "optional"--that is, outside the
mandated package of health insurance for the indigent.</TE>
<TE>   Expanding Medicaid to cover optional groups, such as children of the
working poor, or optional services, such as hospice care, proved
politically popular in many states when times were flush. The expansions
also seemed good fiscal policy: The federal government helps pay for
Medicaid, so for every dollar a state put into the program, Washington
would send it up to $3.31 in matching funds.</TE>
<TE>   But the extra services proved more costly than most states had
gambled. One optional goody in particular, prescription drug coverage,
has sent Medicaid bills soaring. This year alone, the benefit is expected
to cost $25 billion--50% more than in 2000. Many states are moving to
trim those costs by requiring Medicaid patients to use generic drugs, by
limiting the number of medications the program will pay for or by
imposing modest co-payments of a few dollars per prescription.</TE>
<TE>   Yet some lawmakers say such tinkering is not enough to save Medicaid.</TE>
<TE>   They want the federal government to take over a bigger share of the
costs, especially for the elderly. (The federal insurance program for
senior citizens, Medicare, does not now cover long nursing-home stays or
prescription drugs--though changes are being debated--so much of that
burden has fallen to Medicaid.) States also are demanding more
flexibility.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is making bolder experimentation possible
through a waiver program that lets states design new Medicaid
packages--including, for the first time, offering different benefit
packages for different populations--as long as the revisions don't cost
the federal Treasury any extra money.</TE>
<TE>   California, Arizona and Michigan are using their waivers to expand
Medicaid so that both children and parents in low-income households have
coverage.</TE>
<TE>   California, for instance, hopes to insure up to 300,000 more people,
at an estimated cost of about $200 million over the next two years. Gov.
Gray Davis has proposed trimming costs elsewhere in the Medicaid program
by charging patients up to $5 for services and cutting the fees paid to
health-care providers to save the state $78 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Even in difficult fiscal times, when many revenue streams are drying
up, the governor remains committed to the safety net," Rosselli said.</TE>
<TE>   But some states are using their waivers to trim that safety net.</TE>
<TE>   The most far-reaching--and, to critics, most troubling--reforms are
taking place in Utah.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with a waiver granted just last month, Utah plans to eliminate
some benefits it now offers Medicaid patients, including vision, dental
and home health care. It will charge co-payments for other services.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Utah will expand Medicaid to insure more low-income
adults--provided they can pay a $50 annual enrollment fee plus up to
$1,000 a year in co-pays. They will receive a stripped-down package that
covers primary care and prescriptions, but not hospitalization or visits
to specialists.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents see such adjustments as vital to rein in a program that has
grown out of control. They argue that it's better to give more people
basic coverage than to give luxury benefits to just a few. They say they
have to prioritize, funding primary care for children over hearing aids
for seniors because they don't have the money for both.</TE>
<TE>   Critics retort that the reforms are untenable.</TE>
<TE>   Adding enrollment fees and co-payments ignores "decades of research
that shows that co-payments make a big difference in utilization rates,"
argued Leighton Ku, an analyst for the liberal Center for Budget and
Policy Priorities in Washington, D.C. "With premiums, a fairly large
number of people will drop off the program."</TE>
<TE>   Yet some of the very people who will have to pay the new premiums say
they understand that Medicaid cannot be all for everyone.</TE>
<TE>   Take the Horton family of White Hall, Ark. Their oldest child,
11-year-old Caitlyn, has cerebral palsy. No private insurance company
will cover the astronomical bills for her care. The Hortons earn too much
to qualify for regular Medicaid coverage. But Arkansas is one of 20
states that extends Medicaid to severely disabled children, even in
wealthy families.</TE>
<TE>   Medicaid has sent Caitlyn to physical therapy twice a week for years.
She has learned how to communicate using a special device. "She can say
when she's happy, when she's sad, when she's hungry, when she's thirsty,"
her mother, Tina Horton, reports with delight. "Before it was just mama's
intuition that told me."</TE>
<TE>   Caitlyn's progress has cost the state $22,000 a year just for the
therapy. Add in medical bills for her and the 3,350 other kids on the
program, and the state's tab comes to $30 million a year. Now Arkansas is
asking families to shoulder some of those costs. The Hortons estimate
that they will be billed about $400 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Paying that will require sacrifices, of course. Yet Tina Horton does
not begrudge them. "We can cut back. For years we haven't had to pay
anything for the services, so I can't complain."</TE>
<TE>   She can worry, though. And she does, a good deal. If, in some future
fiscal crisis, Arkansas cuts Caitlyn off Medicaid altogether, how would
she pay for the therapy that has given her daughter a voice? The question
haunts, because she has no answer.</TE>
<TE>   "What will the situation be next year? That's what scares me," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   In Florida, Hill voices a similar fear. If the state stops paying for
eyeglasses now, what could be cut off next? "When you're able to work,
you pay into the system, hoping it will be there if you're ever very
poor. Then when you actually need it, they change the rules. You fall
through the cracks."</TE>

<DH>Medical researchers fear the group that says space aliens have
instructed them to start cloning humans will cause lawmakers to ban the
technique.</DH>

<DL>VALCOURT, Canada
</DL>
<LD>In the course of 29 years, Claude Vorilhon built a small yet
international religious group by preaching that scientists from another
planet created all life on Earth. But in 1998, Vorilhon had an especially
big pronouncement for his 5,000 or so followers: The creators would soon
board their flying saucers and return. It was time to prepare.</LD>
<LD>   And so Vorilhon called for beautiful young women in his group to step
forward as hostesses for the arriving aliens. Members of the elite Order
of the Angels were to devote themselves fully--and in some cases
sexually--to the creators and their prophet on Earth, Vorilhon. According
to former members, well more than 100 women volunteered.</LD>
<LD>   It is an unusual tale, but the strangest part may be this: Today,
Vorilhon has won a prominent role in one of the most sober policy
decisions before Congress--whether to outlaw human cloning, even as a
research tool that might help cure disease.</LD>
<TE>   At the direction of the aliens, Vorilhon says, his group is working to
create the world's first cloned child. Some of the Angels have agreed to
act as the egg donors and surrogate mothers that the process requires.</TE>
<TE>   Cloning "is the key to eternal life; that's the goal," Vorilhon said
at his Quebec headquarters, called UFOland, which features a large model
of a UFO he says he boarded in 1973 to meet an alien scientist. "Everyone
who enjoys life would like to live forever. Don't you?"</TE>
<TE>   Now, with Congress engaged in an emotional battle over whether to ban
human cloning, lawmakers are also debating whether to take the
French-born religious leader seriously. Is he truly a rogue cloner, an
example of why regulation might be needed? Or is he merely a charlatan,
riding the public's unease over cloning to gain publicity for his
religion?</TE>
<TE>   It is impossible to determine, yet lawmakers have made Vorilhon part
of their debate. And that has some medical researchers hugely frustrated.
They say Vorilhon, who calls himself the Prophet Rael and testified
before Congress last year in a futuristic white jumpsuit, has made
cloning look unduly creepy. His cloning claims, they say, are pushing
lawmakers to ban the technique not only as a way to produce children, but
as a potential method for growing new cells for Alzheimer's patients,
heart attack victims and other people whose own tissues have gone awry.</TE>
<TE>   "For those of us who want a reasoned debate, it's been a disaster to
have him come out of the woodwork," complained Michael West, chief
executive of Advanced Cell Technology Inc., a Massachusetts company that
aims to create cloned human embryos for disease research. "This is
absurd. It's a circus. Why is Congress debating this by talking to
someone who says he flies around in flying saucers?"</TE>
<TE>   And yet, some biologists say that if it is possible to create a baby
through cloning, Vorilhon and his Raelian Movement might well be the
first to do it.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists have successfully cloned cows, pigs and several other
species, most recently cats. But each birth has followed scores of failed
or aborted pregnancies, and cloned offspring are often unhealthy. Given
the risks, what woman would help create or carry a cloned embryo?</TE>
<TE>   It would take someone with a strong commitment--maybe the commitment
of an Angel. "This cadre of women gives them an advantage over everyone
else in contention," said Dr. Lee Silver, a professor of molecular
biology and public affairs at Princeton University. "For anyone to be
successful, it will take a lot of eggs, a lot of wombs, and a lot of guts
now. The Raelians seem to have a hold on all three."</TE>
<TE>   For some lawmakers, that means no one should be permitted to produce a
cloned embryo for any purpose, whether for reproduction or medical
research. "Once you have these embryos around, and if groups like the
Raelians had access, I don't think it would be difficult for them to
succeed," said Rep. Dave Weldon (R-Fla.), a physician. The House has
already voted to bar the creation of cloned human embryos for any
purpose, and a Senate vote is expected within weeks. President Bush
supports the House bill.</TE>
<TE>   Who is Claude Vorilhon, and what is his true goal? A close look at the
Raelians shows a long history of publicity stunts, and the cloning effort
may be one more. No cloning expert has ever publicly acknowledged working
with them.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the Raelians did open a secret laboratory in West
Virginia, which they closed last year after the location was discovered.
Last month, Vorilhon claimed he had begun work at a new lab to clone a
terminally ill man, who has no family and wants to be "reborn like a
blank tape."</TE>
<TE>   And some people who know the Raelians intimately say they are very
committed to their cause.</TE>
<TE>   "These women, they are not told that this is dangerous," said
Dominique Saint-Hilaire, a 14-year Raelian from Bordeaux, France, until
she quit in 2000. "They are acting for the Great Cause. They are hoping
to be the first mother of a clone. They want to be the most important
Raelian on the planet."</TE>
<TE>   Every summer, Vorilhon's followers drive 90 minutes northwest of
Montreal, past cows and cornfields, tractors and silos. In the small
farming community of Valcourt, they gather at an odd, tear-shaped
building for two weeks of meetings and meditation.</TE>
<TE>   This is UFOland, part office complex, part museum of the Raelian
religion. The tourists who trickle in are guided through Vorilhon's life
and vision--the story of how, in 1973, he was hiking in the French woods
when a UFO landed, and an alien explained to him the true origins of
mankind.</TE>
<TE>   Vorilhon was 27, the editor of a small auto racing magazine. He had
also achieved minor success as a singer. The alien gave him a new
mission: to pave the way for a second coming of the creators from space.</TE>
<TE>   Vorilhon's task was to teach people to accept the aliens as their true
fathers. He was also to preach the alien philosophy: peace, tolerance, a
love of science and sexual freedom.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first heard all this, it was like a philosophical orgasm,"
said Michel Beluet, the UFOland director and a Raelian since 1976. "You
can say we're crazy and on an acid trip, but some people vibrate to it,
and they join."</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Raelians claim 55,000 members in 84 countries, though
Vorilhon says only 10% are active. Others put the membership at about
3,000, with the biggest groups in French-speaking Europe and Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Building a religion takes skill and sensitivity. "The leader of a new
religion has to make followers feel special, like they're the chosen
ones," said Susan Palmer, a Montreal sociologist and author of "Alien
Apocalypse," a forthcoming book about the Raelians. "Otherwise there's no
point in being there, and people drift away."</TE>
<TE>   To keep members engaged, Vorilhon, now 55, has long courted the press.
Media attention makes the Raelians feel important, Palmer said. It also
allows them to spread their message about the alien creators.</TE>
<TE>   The media, in turn, have found the Raelian talk of sex, science and
UFOs to be irresistible. To protest a 1992 decision barring condom
machines at certain Quebec high schools, Raelians passed out condoms from
a van adorned with large spaceships. They bought billboard space in
Toronto to welcome the extraterrestrials. When stories on their
activities appear in print, the Raelians take it as confirmation that the
world is coming to understand their religion and their work is having an
effect.</TE>
<TE>   Vorilhon uses another technique to hold the interest of his followers,
say people who study the group. On regular occasions, he makes
apocalyptic pronouncements, asserting that a world-shattering event is
imminent and that only Raelians are in the know.</TE>
<TE>   Most of his statements have been sufficiently vague or aimed at future
events so that his credibility does not come under direct challenge.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, for example, Vorilhon announced that he had received a
telepathic message from the aliens with dramatic news: The creators would
soon return.</TE>
<TE>   "Which Christian would not like to serve Jesus personally?" the aliens
asked, according to a purported transcript. "Which Jew, Moses? . . .
That's why, for those who would like to, we ask our last prophet Rael to
found a religious order."</TE>
<TE>   Any pious woman could join the new Order of the Angels and help
prepare for the alien arrival. But the creators expressed a special
fondness for beautiful women. Moreover, some women could join an elect
group within the Angels by agreeing to sleep only with the aliens and
their prophets, including Vorilhon.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview at UFOland, Vorilhon said the Angels came under no
pressure to have sexual relations with him. His group believes in sexual
freedom, not coercion, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Angels must be highly committed--willing even to sacrifice their
lives. "When people are ready to die to protect somebody they love from
aggression, I think it's beautiful," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Now the devoted Angels, the apocalyptic announcements and the drive
for media attention have become intertwined with cloning.</TE>
<TE>   After Dolly the sheep was born in 1996, Vorilhon quickly capitalized
on the media frenzy. He said he had created a company, Clonaid, that
would use cloning to help any gay or infertile couple have children, for
a $200,000 fee.</TE>
<TE>   Today, however, Vorilhon says that Clonaid was little more than a post
office box in the Bahamas. "For a minimal investment, it got us media
coverage worth more than $15 million," he wrote last year in a book, "Yes
to Human Cloning." "I am still laughing."</TE>
<TE>   Vorilhon says things turned more serious in the summer of 2000, when a
follower named Brigitte Boisselier told him that she had found an
American investor willing to put up $500,000 to clone his 10-month-old
son, who had died during heart surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Clonaid announced its new cloning effort at a Montreal news
conference. Boisselier, who holds two doctorates in chemistry, became the
company's scientific director.</TE>
<TE>   Clonaid refused to say where the cloning would take place, or to name
any scientists on its team. But as a sign of its credibility, it
introduced several of the 50 Raelian women who had agreed to act as egg
donors and surrogate mothers. Most but not all of them are Angels,
Vorilhon said.</TE>
<TE>   Florence Laudoyer, one of the volunteers, said she saw no health risk
to carrying a cloned child. "The surrogate mother will be followed more
than any other pregnant woman on Earth," she said in an interview at
UFOland. "If there is any problem, there will be an abortion at an early
stage. So there is nothing to fear."</TE>
<TE>   The Clonaid announcement had an important effect within the Raelian
Movement, said Saint-Hilaire, the former member from France.</TE>
<TE>   "Cloning came just in time, because a lot of people had started
getting bored and quitting," she said. "It generates a lot of
excitement."</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Rep. James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), watched the media
coverage of Clonaid. As chairman of a House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee, he was planning a hearing on human cloning, with an eye
toward proposing a ban on cloning to produce children.</TE>
<TE>   Greenwood invited the Raelians to testify last spring, and Vorilhon
appeared in his white jumpsuit, his hair tied atop his head in a knot. He
told the lawmakers that people one day would clone themselves and then
download their personalities into the clones, achieving a kind of eternal
life.</TE>
<TE>   The testimony, Greenwood later said, convinced lawmakers that "even
kooks may have the capacity to make human beings through cloning, and we
better get serious about legislating here."</TE>
<TE>   When the House voted last summer, it chose to bar human cloning for
reproduction and research. That would stop scientists from trying to
produce cloned human embryos for their stem cells, which in turn might be
grown into replacement tissues for patients with a variety of ailments.
Some people said Vorilhon was a big factor in the vote. "The House
invited Rael down to show that cloning was kooky and dangerous and
imminent, then they acted in terror at the image they created," said
Arthur Caplan, a University of Pennsylvania bioethicist. "And Rael
allowed himself to become the poster boy for the anti-cloning forces in
order to gain publicity."</TE>
<TE>   Vorilhon agreed he was used by cloning opponents. "But, we are winners
in any case, even if cloning is banned," he said. "We are winners because
our organization had worldwide media coverage."</TE>
<TE>   Caplan isn't laughing. "If I was a patient," he said, "I'd be angry at
the media and at the politicians."</TE>
<TE>   One night in April, Greg Casto woke at 4 a.m. and had trouble
returning to sleep. He flipped on CNN, and there was Boisselier, talking
about human cloning.</TE>
<TE>   Casto had seen the woman before--right there in the small city of
Nitro, W.Va., at the community center, which Casto manages.</TE>
<TE>   Casto realized he knew something that nobody else knew: The Raelians
really did have a cloning lab. A lawyer, Mark Hunt, had rented a room at
the center and had been stocking it with lab equipment. He had to be the
Raelians' secret financier.</TE>
<TE>   Hunt had lost his 10-month-old son during heart surgery two years
earlier. "What he said was that he wanted to study DNA to cure disease
and get patents," Casto recalled.</TE>
<TE>   When Casto realized Hunt's real intent, he called the authorities, and
Hunt was asked to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the Raelians had set up a lab, there were signs that it
was no more a real attempt at cloning than was Vorilhon's post office box
in the Bahamas.</TE>
<TE>   There was little equipment, Casto said, and there was little activity.
"It was very, very minimal," he said. "There was nothing going on in
there."</TE>
<TE>   Hunt eventually broke with the Raelians, saying Boisselier seemed more
interested in publicity for the religion than in cloning.</TE>
<TE>   Hunt declined interview requests for this story, but he explained his
involvement to his hometown newspaper and to ABC television. He said he
had hoped, through cloning, to reclaim something of his son. But
Boisselier, he complained, had become a "press hog."</TE>
<TE>   Today, Vorilhon says he has a team working to clone the terminally ill
man, whom he will not name, at a secret location outside the United
States. It is impossible to verify his claim.</TE>
<TE>   In the Senate, there is widespread support for outlawing cloning to
produce children. But senators are divided over whether to join the House
in barring it in disease research. A vote could come as soon as this
month.</TE>
<TE>   Vorilhon claims that 3,000 people have signed up for Clonaid's
service, and that the Americans among them would file a lawsuit if
Congress bars cloning. Clonaid wants to operate in the United States,
"which is really the only country in the world where individual freedom
is guaranteed by your wonderful Constitution," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He predicted the Supreme Court would strike down any cloning ban and
rule that Clonaid's clients have a right to reproduce as they choose.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers are still unsure what to make of the Raelians. "If you want
me to put my nickel on the table, I think they're serious," said Weldon,
the lawmaker and physician. "But if you came back in two years and said
they're a hoax, I wouldn't be surprised."</TE>

<HD>Down to the Wire in GOP Primary</HD>
<DH>Election: Jones, Riordan, Simon stump the state. Voting will be key
in races for new House seats.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Capping an election season marked by surprise and scandal,
Californians go to the polls today to pick party nominees in the race for
governor while Central Valley voters decide the fate of embattled Rep.
Gary Condit.</LD>
<LD>   The gubernatorial race has been spirited, with three Republican
candidates vying for the right to face Gov. Gray Davis in the fall. Davis
has run largely unopposed in the Democratic primary.</LD>
<LD>   In the Central Valley race, Democrat Condit has labored under a
tabloid cloud since last year's disappearance of federal intern Chandra
Levy.</LD>
<TE>   The polls will be open statewide from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Despite good
weather--the only chance of rain is on the far north coast--experts were
forecasting a 36% turnout of the state's roughly 15 million voters, the
second lowest on record.</TE>
<TE>   Candidates, led by the three GOP hopefuls for governor, did their best
Monday to excite interest in their contests and exhort followers to the
polls.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Simon Jr., the unexpected front-runner in the Republican
gubernatorial race, made the rounds among the crowd at Philippe, a
lunchtime institution in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Riordan stumped with actor Arnold Schwarzenegger in Van Nuys
while Bill Jones rallied supporters at his Sacramento headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic incumbent Gray Davis, whose $10-million advertising assault
on Riordan helped scramble the Republican contest, faces no major
competition for his party's nomination.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the top-of-the-ticket race for governor, voters will choose
nominees for seven statewide offices--four of them open--thus promising
at least some turnover in Sacramento next year.</TE>
<TE>   Voters also will decide state measures involving term limits, gasoline
taxes and environmental protection, as well as myriad local ballot
questions, among them Orange County's divisive fight over the former El
Toro Marine base.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Supervisors Gloria Molina and Zev Yaroslavsky and
Sheriff Lee Baca are up for reelection, along with Orange County Superior
Judge Ronald C. Kline.</TE>
<TE>   Kline, who is charged with child molestation and possession of child
pornography, has no opponent on the ballot but faces a write-in campaign
by election opponents.</TE>
<TE>   There are heated races for district attorney in Ventura and Orange
counties, and voters in the east San Fernando Valley will choose between
Assemblyman Tony Cardenas (D-Panorama City) and businesswoman Wendy
Greuel to fill an open seat on the Los Angeles City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Once they reach the polls, Californians will face the third set of
voting rules in as many primaries. Gone is the "blanket" primary of two
years ago, in which registered voters could cast ballots for any
candidate of their choosing, regardless of party affiliation. Instead,
the state will conduct its first "semi-open" primary, allowing roughly 2
million unaffiliated voters to participate by requesting a partisan
ballot.</TE>
<TE>   However, Democrats, Republicans and others registered with a political
party will not be allowed to vote in any other primary.</TE>
<TE>   It is not the new rules but the early timing of the primary that has
led to woeful turnout predictions. The first gubernatorial primary to be
held in March--historically it has been in June--the contest also was
overshadowed until nine days ago by the Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, a first-term governor without the press of serious opposition,
spent his primary attacking former Los Angeles Mayor Riordan from across
the aisle.</TE>
<TE>   The onslaught helped boost Simon in the GOP contest and drove a
frustrated Riordan to compare the governor Monday to the fascist dictator
Benito Mussolini. "Gray Davis is gloating about hijacking the Republican
Party and it's just like Mussolini bragging about killing a lot of his
enemies," Riordan said.</TE>
<TE>Stressing Party Unity</TE>
<TE>   The ex-mayor began a hectic day of campaigning in Walnut Creek, where
he greeted morning commuters at the leafy BART station. Later, at a
Sacramento stop, Riordan voiced themes of party unity, saying it was time
for the GOP to put aside divisive feuds among moderates and conservatives
and focus on areas where Republicans all agree, such as fiscal prudence.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan also attempted to turn Davis' ad blitz into a sign of his own
potency, pleading with Republicans not to let Davis have his way by
ousting Riordan from the race.</TE>
<TE>   "He has hijacked the Republican primary," Riordan said of Davis. "We
can't let him get away with that."</TE>
<TE>   The former mayor concluded his day appearing alongside Schwarzenegger,
who introduced him at his campaign launch in November. "Should we listen
to Gray Davis on who we should pick as the Republican nominee," the actor
called out from a stage to roughly 75 Riordan supporters gathered at a
Van Nuys hotel. "No!" the crowd shouted back. "Exactly," Schwarzenegger
replied.</TE>
<TE>Emphasizing Tax Cut</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, Simon worked the luncheon crowd amid Philippe's
sawdust-covered floors and famous French dip sandwiches.</TE>
<TE>   Surrounded by television cameras, the millionaire businessman and
novice candidate shook hands, telling people: "Hi, I'm Bill Simon, I'm
running for governor" and apologized for disrupting their lunch. Everyone
was friendly, even those who seemed less than convinced by his candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you going to support the union boys?" asked electrician Jon
Woods, a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers,
Local 11.</TE>
<TE>   Simon responded by saying he would cut Woods' taxes. "You think you
pay enough in taxes?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   "I think wages should go up," Woods replied. "You need to support our
union."</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing I'm going to do," Simon said, "is reduce your taxes."</TE>
<TE>   After maneuvering into a corner to avoid a backdrop of Riordan signs,
Simon spoke briefly with reporters, offering his standard response when
asked how his conservative stance on social issues would stand up in the
general election.</TE>
<TE>   "Every candidate is free to choose the issues they talk about on the
campaign trail," Simon told reporters, stating his intention to focus on
the budget and tax cuts, improving education and the state's
infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>Targeting Gray Davis</TE>
<TE>   In Sacramento, Secretary of State Jones took shots at his Republican
opponents and Davis during an appearance at campaign headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   "This election has to be about Gray Davis," Jones said. "And we can
make it about Gray Davis with a correct nominee."</TE>
<TE>   Jones said the election is also about building a new majority of
independents, conservative Democrats and Republicans. He said he is the
only one of the three GOP candidates who has been able to deliver in
elected office for 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I will win this election because in the final analysis people are
still looking for leadership they can trust," he said, alluding to his
two wealthy opponents. "You cannot buy leadership no matter how much
money you spend."</TE>
<TE>   When asked about the White House's role in California's primary, Jones
said: "I expect my phone call on Wednesday morning. Everybody else has
gotten theirs."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer was asked whether
Bush still preferred Riordan over Simon or Jones in the GOP contest. "The
president has always said he'll support the nominee," Fleischer replied.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic leaders were somewhat less circumspect in making their
preferences known in California's 18th Congressional District, where the
national scandal over the disappearance of Washington intern Levy
overtook the usual discussion of agricultural policy and economic
development. The party establishment abandoned Condit, leaving him
struggling to hold on to his seat after 13 years.</TE>
<TE>   Reelections used to be a waltz for the Ceres Democrat, who never won
without landslide support. But last spring, Levy disappeared and Condit
became the staple of sensational headlines and the butt of late-night
comedy jokes.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives of the 24-year-old intern--who is still missing--have said
she and the 53-year-old Condit were having an affair. Condit, who is
married, has refused to discuss details of their relationship, other than
to say they were close.</TE>
<TE>   Emboldened by Condit's precipitous fall in polls, a onetime friend and
protege, Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza of Merced, jumped into the primary
and immediately won support from leading Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Four Republicans are vying in the GOP primary and will face the top
Democratic voter-getter in November.</TE>
<TE>   However, that heated competition in the Condit race is something of a
rarity in California's congressional races.</TE>
<TE>   All 52 House members are up for reelection, but few are seriously
threatened, thanks to the incumbent-protection plan that passed the
Legislature as part of the once-a-decade redrawing of the state's
political boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   Two new House seats have been carved out to reflect population shifts
over the last 10 years. Voters will decide among three candidates in the
Democratic primary for one of the new districts, carved out of southeast
Los Angeles County. The winner--attorney Linda Sanchez, South Gate City
Councilman Hector De La Torre or Assemblywoman Sally Havice of
Cerritos--seems a shoo-in to head for Washington in November, given the
district's heavy Democratic registration.</TE>
<TE>   For the opposite reason, the winner of today's GOP primary appears to
be a sure bet to go to Congress from California's other new congressional
district, which is centered in the eastern part of the Central Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The placid political dynamic is the same in most races for the state
Legislature. With most incumbents secure, the intense competition will
come in today's primaries.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego and Riverside counties, conservative Assemblyman Dennis
Hollingsworth (R-Murrieta) is seeking the same state Senate seat as
moderate Assemblywoman Charlene Zettel (R-Poway). In north Los Angeles
County, a similar contest pits Assemblyman Phil Wyman (R-Tehachapi)
against Sharon Runner, wife of the incumbent, Assemblyman George Runner
(R-Lancaster).</TE>
<TE>   A hard-fought contest in the San Fernando Valley pits fellow Democrats
Andrei Cherny and Lloyd Levine in a race to replace outgoing Assemblyman
Bob Hertzberg of Sherman Oaks.</TE>

<HD>Army Strikes Kill 17 Palestinians</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Three Israelis die in later shooting at Tel Aviv
restaurant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>The Israeli army killed at least 17 Palestinians, including the
wife of an Islamic militant, their three children and a doctor, on Monday
as Prime Minister Ariel Sharon vowed to inflict heavy losses after a
weekend of attacks on Israelis.</LD>
<LD>   The army raided towns, villages and refugee camps and launched
airstrikes hours after the Israeli government said it would increase
pressure on the Palestinians. Cabinet ministers called for the
destruction of the Palestinian Authority.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinians promised retaliation, and early today, a Palestinian
gunman armed with an M-16 automatic rifle opened fire on the Seafood
Market restaurant in Tel Aviv, killing three people and wounding 30
before he was shot dead, police spokesman Gil Kleiman said.</LD>
<TE>   The gunman reportedly stood on a bridge above Petah Tikva Street and
began spraying the street with gunfire about 2:15 a.m., Kleiman said. He
also threw two homemade grenades into the crowd, then jumped down and
opened fire on the restaurant and a steakhouse next door. When he ran out
of ammunition, he began stabbing people before patrons of the restaurant
and police shot him dead, Kleiman said.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard the first shot, and I thought it was a firecracker," said
Gilly Cohen, a witness who was in the restaurant. "Then we heard more
shooting. . . . The terrorist sprayed the people inside from the windows.
People started pushing toward the bathroom and became hysterical."</TE>
<TE>   The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militia connected with Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement, claimed
responsibility for the attack and identified the shooter as Ibrahim
Hassouna, from the Jabaliya refugee camp in the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   In a warning to Arafat, the army targeted three of his office
complexes Sunday night, including the Ramallah headquarters where Israel
has confined him for three months.</TE>
<TE>   Attack helicopters fired missiles into the front gate of the Ramallah
compound and into a military intelligence building behind Arafat's
offices. Arafat was unharmed, said his spokesman, Nabil abu Rudaineh.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli fighter jets severely damaged a Palestinian security compound
in the West Bank town of Bethlehem. Palestinian witnesses said jets fired
four missiles into the complex, destroying intelligence offices and a
prison. Palestinians said eight people were slightly injured. Gunboats
also fired missiles at Arafat's seaside offices in the Gaza Strip,
Palestinian sources reported. There were no injuries and little damage.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians "must be dealt a heavy blow which will come from every
direction," Sharon told reporters after briefing a committee of the
Knesset, Israel's parliament.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone wishing to conduct negotiations with [the Palestinians] must
first hit them hard, so that it is clear to them that they will achieve
nothing through terror. If it is not made clear to them that they are
overpowered, we will be unable to return to negotiations," Sharon said.
"We must inflict heavy losses on their side."</TE>
<TE>   Sickened by a series of attacks that claimed the lives of 22 Israelis
over the weekend, among them several children, Cabinet ministers and the
Israeli public are demanding that Sharon change policies that have failed
to deliver the security or peace he promised when elected a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   They are deeply divided, however, over whether he should deal a
crushing blow to the Palestinian Authority or immediately open
negotiations with it.</TE>
<TE>   "I support every move that would worsen the situation for the
Palestinians until they cry out, 'We want a cease-fire,' " Justice
Minister Meir Sheetrit, considered a moderate in Sharon's right-wing
Likud Party, told Israel Radio.</TE>
<TE>   "All our efforts have failed," Sheetrit said, "and I have no doubt
that we should punish them badly. I'm all for having the [army] strike
anyone involved in this without further ado."</TE>
<TE>   But the toll of dead Palestinian civilians Monday underscored the
risks Israel runs in intensifying its pursuit of guerrilla fighters among
the 3 million residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Sheik Ahmed Yassin, spiritual leader and founder of the militant
Islamic movement Hamas, said Israel "is going to pay a dear price" for
its actions.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian Cabinet minister and peace negotiator Saeb Erekat called
for international intervention to stop Israel's attacks, as did the
Palestinian Authority in a statement issued by its WAFA news agency.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, United Nations officials called on Israel to withdraw its
forces from refugee camps and urged both sides to return to negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that the U.N., the United States,
the European Union and Russia were working "to try and help the parties
come back from the brink."</TE>
<TE>   Annan said he hoped that a tentative Saudi peace initiative, in which
Arab states would offer Israel normal relations in exchange for complete
withdrawal from territories captured in the 1967 Middle East War, would
help persuade Israelis and Palestinians to resume talks.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, meeting with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak in Washington, backed Mubarak's proposal to host an
Israeli-Palestinian summit.</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank, the wife of leading Hamas militant Hussein abu Kweik
of Ramallah was heading home after picking up their three children from
school when Israeli troops fired a tank shell at her Mitsubishi truck.</TE>
<TE>   The shell turned the cabin of the truck into a flaming wreck of
shattered steel, scattered schoolbooks and dismembered bodies. Bushra abu
Kweik, 38, was killed instantly, along with all three children: Aziza,
16; Bara, 14; and Mohammed, 10.</TE>
<TE>   Imad Masri, 34, was driving behind the truck, taking his 16-year-old
nephew, his 4-year-old niece, and other children home from school.
Masri's white Subaru was also hit. His nephew and niece were killed, and
Masri was injured. Five other children survived with scrapes.</TE>
<TE>   Nida Mashal, 24, was in her home when she heard "a very large
explosion" and ran into the street.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw the body of the lady. We pulled one boy alive from the car, but
the children in the other car were all blown away," Mashal said.</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli army spokesman said the tank fired on the family by
mistake. In a statement, the army said it had targeted a carload of armed
Palestinians and expressed "deep regret" for the killings. Defense
Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer also apologized for the deaths.</TE>
<TE>   A defiant Hussein abu Kweik marched in a rally organized by Hamas an
hour after his family was killed. Wearing a green baseball cap emblazoned
with the movement's name, Abu Kweik said the Palestinians "will defeat
Sharon with our will and our determination to resist."</TE>
<TE>   He spoke as hundreds marched through Ramallah in a show of force.
Dozens of heavily armed men, many wearing the green bandannas of Hamas,
some waving flags, chanted slogans calling for revenge and fired their
automatic weapons into the air.</TE>
<TE>   Passersby looked on approvingly.</TE>
<TE>   "What do the Israelis want from us? Do they now kill only for the sake
of killing?" asked 45-year-old Samia Shanan. "This Israeli government is
a bunch of criminals, killers, and the Israelis are not taking
responsibility. These young people who are going to fight the Israelis
have a very clear understanding and faith that they have a right to live,
to be here, because this is their country."</TE>
<TE>   The army also apologized for an incident in which troops fired on an
ambulance in the Jenin refugee camp and killed a doctor, 57-year-old
Khalil Suleiman. Three medics and a 9-year-old girl, who was being
evacuated, were wounded. The girl already had been injured during
fighting between the army and Palestinians in the camp.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Hossam Sharkawi, head of emergency services for the Red Crescent
in the Palestinian territories, said the army had prevented ambulances
from evacuating the dead and wounded from the camp for hours. Suleiman
was in the first ambulance allowed inside to evacuate the child, Sharkawi
said.</TE>
<TE>   An army spokesman said ambulances were kept out of the camp "only
because there was a heavy exchange of gunfire" and were allowed in when
the fighting subsided. In a statement, the army said one ambulance was
fired on by troops because it approached them "at a high speed" and the
soldiers thought that their lives were in danger.</TE>
<TE>   At least six people died during the fighting inside the camp,
Palestinians said, including a 53-year-old woman, a 17-year-old girl and
at least one gunman. Three other men reportedly were killed by tank fire.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians also reported that an 18-year-old student was shot dead
when he approached an army checkpoint near the West Bank town of Tulkarm.</TE>
<TE>   The violence Monday began in the predawn hours when Israeli troops
entered the Rafah refugee camp in the Gaza Strip and shot dead three
Palestinians during clashes there. Late Monday, Israel Radio reported
that three Israelis were wounded in the West Bank, two in a drive-by
shooting and one when stones were thrown at a bus in which she was
riding.</TE>
<TE>   The army began raiding Palestinian refugee camps last week, saying it
wanted to demonstrate that it will hunt down militants anywhere, even in
the crowded camps.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian militants, in turn, have vowed to avenge the attacks on
the camps. The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade claimed responsibility for a
suicide bombing in an ultra-Orthodox Jerusalem neighborhood Saturday
night that killed 10 Israelis, including several children. The
organization also claimed responsibility for a sniper attack on an army
roadblock near the West Bank Jewish settlement of Ofra on Sunday in which
seven soldiers and three civilians were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli military commentators said Monday that the army had decided to
launch "all-out war" on the Fatah militia in an effort to stem the rising
tide of attacks on its soldiers and on Israeli civilians.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview in Ramallah, Marwan Barghouti, leader of Fatah's
Tanzim militia, said he was unperturbed by the army's threat.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not new," Barghouti said as he strolled down the street
surrounded by bodyguards. "They have already assassinated a lot of our
cadres. The Tanzim is part of this people, and the Israelis will never
break the Tanzim. What Israel is doing now is just a new, very dangerous
escalation, and I think there will be a lot of responses."</TE>
<TE>   This morning, a suicide bomber apparently blew himself up on a bus at
the central bus station in Afula, a northern Israeli town, Israel Radio
said. Police reported finding two bodies and said 11 people had been
injured, most of them lightly.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, one Israeli was shot dead and another injured this
morning in a drive-by shooting on a road used by Jewish settlers near
Bethlehem, an Israeli army spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Just after the school day began this morning, a bomb went off in the
playground of an Arab school in the Arab south Jerusalem neighborhood of
Sour Baher. A teacher was moderately injured, and at least eight children
suffered light injuries from flying glass, Israel Radio reported. The
radio said an anonymous caller told police that "Revenge of the
Infants"--a previously unknown group--took responsibility for the attack.
The group was believed to consist of Jewish extremists.</TE>

<HD>7 U.S. Troops Are Killed in Assault on Enemy Fighters</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: At least 40 Americans have been hurt in the three-day
attack. Two helicopters reportedly are hit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Enemy fire killed seven helicopter-borne soldiers on a
reconnaissance mission, Pentagon officials said Monday, as the largest
offensive of the Afghan war turned increasingly deadly for American
troops.</LD>
<LD>   A soldier fell to his death when a Chinook helicopter was hit by a
rocket-propelled grenade and crashed, said Navy Cmdr. Frank Merriman, a
spokesman for the U.S. Central Command. Six other soldiers ferried in by
a second helicopter to infiltrate the area were killed in ground combat,
he said, but their chopper managed to rescue the downed crew.</LD>
<LD>   A third helicopter was reported to have been downed by a
rocket-propelled grenade, but Merriman said there were no reports of
deaths or injuries in that incident.</LD>
<TE>   The deaths bring to eight the number of U.S. soldiers killed so far in
the three-day assault on the mountains near Gardez in eastern
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   At least 40 Americans have been injured since the air and ground
attack began early Saturday, Army Gen. Tommy Franks, head of the U.S.
Central Command, said in a separate news briefing from Tampa, Fla. Few
suffered life-threatening injuries, and nearly half have returned to
duty, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan fighters allied with the U.S. in the area said Taliban and Al
Qaeda forces were suffering heavy casualties under relentless U.S.
bombing. U.S. forces have killed 100 to 200 in the battle, Franks said.</TE>
<TE>   "Even now as I am speaking, I hear helicopters landing as well as
bombers overhead," Safi Ullah, a member of the shura, or council, in
Gardez, said by telephone. "The Americans are trying to beat them up
before they start the ground attack. And they have also blocked three
escape routes from the mountains."</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials have described the area as the last major center of
Al Qaeda resistance but say smaller cells remain elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "This will not be the last such operation in Afghanistan," Defense
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said. "Not all Taliban and Al Qaeda forces
have been defeated. Substantial pockets of resistance remain. They're
determined. They're dangerous. They will not give up without a fight.
They are hiding in the villages and in the mountains and just across the
borders, in a number of directions from Afghanistan, and they're waiting
for their opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. helicopters are "straining their capabilities," said Gen. Richard
B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Flying at altitudes up
to 12,000 feet in 15- to 20-degree temperatures can limit a helicopter's
ability to climb out of trouble, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Further complicating matters for the helicopters is the geography of
the battlefield. The jagged mountain ranges of southeastern Afghanistan
rise close together, creating narrow valleys from which it would be
relatively easy to fire at a large, slow-moving helicopter such as the
Chinook.</TE>
<TE>   "The altitude and temperature have a tremendous effect," said Charles
Bailey, a commercial pilot in Oregon who flew Chinook helicopters in
Vietnam in 1970 and '71. "If you lose one engine at that altitude and
temperature, you're going to go down."</TE>
<TE>   Known for its brute strength and reliability, the twin-engine Chinook
has been the workhorse of the military helicopter fleet since the 1960s.
The helicopter is commonly used for moving troops and heavy pieces of
artillery--but typically only into areas that have already been secured.</TE>
<TE>   Chinooks can be crippled if hit in any one of several vulnerable
points. Miles of critical hydraulic lines snake through the cabin, and a
drive shaft that connects the front and back rotors is all that keeps
their blades from slapping against one another. Even under optimal
conditions, the craft are so large that "a blind man could hit them,"
Bailey said.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's death toll equaled the previous deadliest incident for
Americans, which occurred Jan. 9 when a tanker plane crashed into the
mountains of Pakistan, killing seven Marines. The first American soldier
slain in the current offensive, Army Chief Warrant Officer Stanley L.
Harriman, 34, of Wade, N.C., was killed by enemy fire Saturday. The
Pentagon provided no identifications of the most recent fatalities,
although Rumsfeld said their bodies have been removed from the battle
area.</TE>
<TE>   "We sent teams in, and there's some serious combat as I speak, and
lives are lost, and we send our prayers and tears to those whose families
have lost life," President Bush told high school students and teachers in
Eden Prairie, Minn. "But I want to assure the students who are here and
the loved ones of those military [service members], defending freedom is
a noble cause and it is a just cause, and so long as I am the president
of the United States, I will pursue those who want to hurt America and
who want to take away our freedoms."</TE>
<TE>District Regarded as Al Qaeda Haven</TE>
<TE>   Afghan intelligence officials say they regard the Shahi Kot district,
where the fighting is taking place, as the most important remaining haven
for Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Several large pockets of heavily armed Al Qaeda fighters apparently
regrouped there to try to undermine the fledgling Afghan government and
attack American troops, Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   "Their goal is to reconstitute, to try to throw out the new interim
government of Afghanistan, to kill coalition forces and to try to regain
the ability to use Afghanistan as a base for terrorist operations and, as
a byproduct, repress the Afghan people. And we intend to prevent them
from doing that," Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   Franks, who watched the assault unfold on a live video link, said the
fighters might have been simply returning to a fallback position after
being defeated elsewhere, rather than consciously massing there for a new
assault.</TE>
<TE>   Arabs, who are believed to make up a large proportion of Al Qaeda,
began to gather over the last couple of months in the mountains near the
village of Zermal in a neighboring valley, retreating to the mountains
when U.S. forces came to explore the area, an Afghan intelligence
official said.</TE>
<TE>   The treeless and boulder-strewn terrain is difficult for those
unaccustomed to it to tread without being thrown off balance. Some of the
mountainsides are shale fields, others are loosely packed earth and rock.</TE>
<TE>   The cave complexes in the area are particularly deep and winding,
according to local commanders, affording a good place for hiding and
secreting away large stores of supplies. Built during the 1980s, the
caves would be well-known to local Afghan fighters who used them when
they were fighting to free the country from Soviet occupation.</TE>
<TE>   Although Afghan fighters know the territory best, U.S. troops are at
the vanguard of the coalition force fighting in Paktia province.</TE>
<TE>As Many as 900 U.S. Troops Involved</TE>
<TE>   The campaign in November in the mountains of Tora Bora, to the north
of the current offensive, had a small number of U.S. Special Forces
troops assisting hundreds of Afghan fighters, with air power forming the
brunt of the U.S. assault.</TE>
<TE>   But as many as 900 U.S. troops are on the front line of this battle,
including soldiers from the 10th Mountain and the 101st Airborne
divisions.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the Americans are as many as 200 special operations
soldiers from Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany and Norway,
Franks said. French fighter pilots also are involved, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the approximately 1,500 Afghan fighters involved are doing
less central tasks than the Americans, Franks said.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Qaeda fighters, numbering in the hundreds, are well armed with
machine guns, mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and, apparently,
surface-to-air missiles, although the latter have not yet threatened
coalition aircraft, Franks said. The fighters appear to have preserved
their ability to communicate, with runners and possibly satellite
telephones and radios.</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence reports suggest that members of the Islamic Movement of
Uzbekistan are among those exchanging fire with the Americans, Myers
said. That could result in closer ties between the United States and the
former Soviet Central Asian nations of Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, where
the U.S. has established key bases.</TE>
<TE>   French Mirage planes are expected to be the first to arrive at a new
U.S. base in Kyrgyzstan, although Air Force officials say the base is
intended to support the Afghan war and not local anti-terror efforts.</TE>
<TE>Journalist Wounded in Grenade Attack</TE>
<TE>   In Gardez, a staging ground for the operation miles from the
battleground, newspaper correspondent Kathleen Kenna of the Toronto Globe
&amp; Mail was seriously wounded by a hand grenade thrown at her car as she
was returning to the city. Kamal Wazir, a spokesman for the Gardez
council, said an American camp came under fire by two rockets and
automatic rifles at 3 a.m. Monday in Khowst, a town close to the
Pakistani border. No casualties were reported.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Boosting Allies' Military Aid</HD>
<DH>Strategy: The Bush administration offers training and arms in
expectation of later help.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration is preparing to provide U.S. military
advisors, weapons and special training to governments in Central Asia,
the Mideast and Africa over the next six months as part of an expanded
effort to mount proxy fights against terrorists in more than half a dozen
countries, administration officials say.</LD>
<LD>   The administration has sought a 27% funding increase for a federal
program designed to bolster militaries in other countries. Money,
materiel and U.S. military trainers would go to Indonesia, Uzbekistan,
Nepal, Jordan, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, a senior
Defense Department official said.</LD>
<LD>   The United States has traditionally conducted training exercises with
friendly militaries and has helped them buy military equipment and
services. But the expanded effort is designed to allow the U.S. to more
directly use other nations' armed forces to strike at terrorists who
threaten American interests.</LD>
<TE>   The new push comes despite years of controversy over misuse of U.S.
training and materiel by foreign militaries. Now, however, the expanded
ties are seen as essential to the administration's plan to conduct proxy
fights against terrorist cells in many places at once.</TE>
<TE>   "All these programs were predicated on the idea that if we get
together, U.S. values will be transferred and U.S. interests will be
served. Right now, our interest is in curbing terrorism," said D. B. Des
Roches, a spokesman for the Defense Security Cooperation Agency.</TE>
<TE>   While the Pentagon says it will not disclose publicly where the war on
terrorism will take U.S. resources next, military officials said the
Pentagon is sending a surplus patrol boat and rifles to the Philippines
and spare helicopter parts to Pakistan. It has sent military trainers to
Djibouti, Ethiopia and Oman and has trained Georgian pilots at U.S.
military flight schools.</TE>
<TE>   "We will continue to train and equip countries that face terrorist
threats. We will establish or, in some cases, reestablish
military-to-military contacts with countries that face terrorist
threats," Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld said Monday. "The power
and reach of weapons today are too great and too lethal to do otherwise."</TE>
<TE>   Senior defense officials say the preparations are a central part of
the next phase in the war on terrorism, in which the United States hopes
to be able to wage military operations against its enemies around the
world without using U.S. troops. Administration officials believe that by
sending military equipment to countries that have long sought such aid,
then training their militaries, Washington will build relationships
strong enough that U.S. leaders can later ask those nations to use what
they have learned on the United States' behalf.</TE>
<TE>   "This is more of a long-term investment than an immediate fix," said
one senior military official. "It's an attempt to get more exposure to
democracy for front-line states in the war against terrorism, and to
equip them to fight on their turf. It's part of the realization that
there are an awful lot of nasty things out there that could touch us more
directly than we ever thought they could in the past."</TE>
<TE>   The military aid is being channeled through three Cold War era
programs. Two of the programs--Foreign Military Financing, or FMF, which
awards credits, loans and grants to other militaries to buy military
equipment; and International Military Education and Training, or IMET,
which provides education at home and in the United States to officers of
foreign militaries--are run by the State Department and implemented by
the Pentagon. A third program, which awards excess defense equipment to
friendly countries, is run by the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   The programs have been used in the past primarily for funding military
aid to Israel, Egypt, Jordan and countries in Latin America. But they
were also used in 2001 to train and educate more than 9,000 foreign
military personnel and to equip the 100 countries those personnel came
from.</TE>
<TE>   In its 2003 budget request to Congress, the State Department is asking
for an increase of 27% over this year's budget for FMF and 13% for IMET.</TE>
<TE>   The increases reflect "new conditions" after Sept. 11, a State
Department official said. "Certainly we want to use [the programs] to
complement our objectives in the war on terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Military officials say the relationships the Pentagon has been
cultivating for almost a decade with the militaries of Central Asian
countries have already paid dividends. The U.S. has been making heavy use
of air bases in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan to support the war in
Afghanistan. And the Air Force is building an air base in Kyrgyzstan it
plans to use for years.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no guarantee this will buy you anything in the long term, but
if you're coming into these places starting from ground zero, the chances
that you will get anything from them are near zero," said Jay Cope, a
retired Army colonel and a senior research fellow at the National Defense
University.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say that strengthening militaries without strengthening
government institutions in unstable parts of the globe could create more
problems than it solves.</TE>
<TE>   "What do we actually buy when we train these militaries? Presumably
they can shoot better and train better, but are they more likely to be
our friends? We don't actually know," said Deborah Avant, an assistant
professor of political science and international affairs at George
Washington University.</TE>
<TE>   "We're partly going on hope here," Avant said. "You might be shooting
yourself in the foot, particularly when you're talking about getting
terrorist threats under control."</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials said that while the programs are not perfect, they
are gambling that they can be used effectively to leverage U.S. interests
in the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't change where these people come from and the culture of their
particular institution," a senior military official said. "We can expose
them to a lot, but that doesn't necessarily mean that, when they go back
home and they become part of that particular institution, they are going
to respond as expected."</TE>

<HD>New Leader in Kosovo Vows to Seek Tolerance</HD>
<DH>Balkans: Moderate Ibrahim Rugova is elected president in wake of
accord among ethnic Albanian parties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<AU>BLERIM GJOCI</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>PRISTINA, Yugoslavia
</DL>
<LD>Moderate ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova was elected
president of Kosovo on Monday in a key step toward building the political
structures of democratic self-rule--and perhaps toward ethnic
reconciliation.</LD>
<LD>   A new parliament in the southern Serbian province also elected Bajram
Rexhepi as prime minister. Rexhepi, 47, is a surgeon who broke with
Rugova's party four years ago, then worked as a field doctor for the
Kosovo Liberation Army. He is considered one of the most moderate leaders
associated with the former guerrillas.</LD>
<LD>   "We will jointly work for a free, democratic, peaceful, prosperous and
independent Kosovo," Rugova, 57, said after his victory. He cited the
integration of ethnic groups as a top priority, pledging to preserve "the
language, the culture and their identity, because Kosovo is comprised of
its citizens and they are all Kosovars. Albanians, as the vast majority,
bear the responsibility for this to happen."</LD>
<TE>   The election of Rugova and Rexhepi came under a broad power-sharing
agreement reached last week among major ethnic Albanian political parties
after mediation by chief U.N. administrator Michael Steiner.</TE>
<TE>   Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo placed first in a November
election. But it failed to win the majority of seats needed to govern
alone, and the new parliament had been deadlocked in a three-way split
among Rugova's party, former guerrillas and Serb representatives.</TE>
<TE>   Of those present in the 120-seat parliament Monday, 88 voted to
approve the power-sharing deal, three opposed it and 15 abstained. The
vote was celebrated with thunderous applause.</TE>
<TE>   It also won international praise.</TE>
<TE>   "This morning, Kosovo passed a crucial test of democracy," said John
Menzies, head of the U.S. office in Pristina, the provincial capital.</TE>
<TE>   Rugova, a former writer and literary critic who led a pacifist
struggle for Kosovo independence starting in 1989, is more acceptable to
Kosovo Serbs than any former guerrilla leader.</TE>
<TE>   Rexhepi, while associated with the guerrillas, has spoken out more
strongly than most of the former fighters in favor of reconciliation with
Kosovo's Serb minority.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a good day for Kosovo, and this is a great team for the
future of Kosovo," an obviously elated Steiner told a news conference.
"These are men who will work for the interests of Kosovo, and I think
they are united in bringing Kosovo forward."</TE>
<TE>   The agreement also named all but one minister in a 10-member,
multi-party Cabinet. Under U.N.-imposed rules, one Cabinet seat is
reserved for a Serb and one must go to a non-Serb minority. Serb
parliament members have so far refused to fill the Serb seat, but said
they might name a minister after a meeting with Steiner scheduled for
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Rada Trajkovic, leader of the Serb parliament members, called on the
new government to quickly improve treatment of Serbs in Kosovo and accept
the return of those who have fled. "From this moment, we expect the
process of discrimination which has been going on for 2 1/2 years to
stop, making possible the return of all those who want to come back," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Kosovo came under U.N. administration after a 78-day North Atlantic
Treaty Organization bombing campaign in the spring of 1999 aimed at
forcing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to end repression of the
province's ethnic Albanian majority. Yugoslav and Serbian forces were
replaced by NATO-led peacekeepers that June, and nearly 200,000 Serbs and
other non-Albanians left the province, many in fear of reprisal attacks
by ethnic Albanians.</TE>
<TE>   About 80,000 Serbs remain in Kosovo, which now has a total population
estimated at more than 2 million.</TE>
<TE>   For the new government, "almost everything is a priority, starting
from hostages held in the prisons of Serbia to benches in the parks for
citizens to have a rest," Rexhepi said.</TE>
<TE>   Many people here believe that about 500 ethnic Albanians are still
being held in Serbian prisons--and that some of the several thousand
missing persons may also be imprisoned, although it is presumed that most
are dead. Ethnic Albanians view almost all the prisoners as political
detainees or hostages.</TE>
<TE>   The Serbian government acknowledges holding more than 100 prisoners
from Kosovo, most accused either of terrorism or ordinary crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Under a U.N. Security Council resolution, administrative power in
Kosovo remains in Steiner's hands, but he will delegate broad authority
over daily life in Kosovo to the new government as it takes shape.</TE>
<TE>   Kosovo technically remains part of Serbia, the main republic in
Yugoslavia. Virtually all Serbs in Kosovo oppose independence.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations views the question of whether Kosovo should become
independent or be re-integrated into a democratic Yugoslavia as an issue
to be dealt with in the future. The new parliament is not authorized to
discuss Kosovo's final status.</TE>
<TE>   Key Western governments officially oppose independence but have
appeared to move gradually toward accepting that it may be the best
possible outcome for Kosovo. Virtually all ethnic Albanians in Kosovo,
who constitute more than 90% of the residents, support independence and
would bitterly oppose any return to control by Serbia.</TE>

<HD>Afghan Earthquake Triggers Landslide, Burying a Village</HD>
<DH>Disaster: Debris kills dozens and leaves 100 missing after a
magnitude 7.2 temblor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SARBAGH, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>At least 60 people were reported dead and 100 were missing Monday
after a landslide touched off by an earthquake sent tons of rock down on
a village tucked in a narrow gorge in northern Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Virtually the entire village of Darun-i-Zao, which had 60 to 100
homes, was buried beneath more than 50 feet of chalky rock that plugged a
200-yard-wide gorge and dammed the Samangan River.</LD>
<LD>   The slide occurred during a magnitude 7.2 earthquake that struck
central Afghanistan on Sunday, shaking a region that stretched from
Tajikistan to India, and causing several deaths in the capital, Kabul,
and other Afghan cities.</LD>
<TE>   With the river dammed by the landslide, a lake of rising water
inundated an estimated 300 more homes and spread over about 10 acres,
sending more than 1,000 residents of two other villages upstream racing
for higher ground.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in Samangan, a city of about 70,000 people about 25 miles
northwest of the disaster site, said they feared a breach in the debris
would send water roaring through several villages downstream and also
threaten the city.</TE>
<TE>   The mammoth slide left an eerie scene in the neighboring village of
Pas-i-Hisar. Several inches of dust covered streets, houses, rock walls
and trees there like fresh snow. Survivors held scarves across their
faces, and some suffered nosebleeds from the suffocating pall.</TE>
<TE>   Abdul Halim, 36, led a line of about 35 men who crossed a narrow
causeway beside the floodwaters and headed downstream to safety. "There
were many houses in this area," he said from a heap of rock plugging the
canyon. "We are 50 meters [about 165 feet] above them now. There were 70
houses. Only eight people escaped."</TE>
<TE>   It was apparent that an official count of the dead and missing would
take a while. Emergency crews arrived Monday afternoon. They administered
first aid to about seven injured people but evacuated only a few
scattered residents. The rest apparently chose to move farther upstream
to other villages.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan Red Crescent rescuers said they estimated at least 60 dead and
100 missing as a result of the landslide, said Dr. Mohammed Saleh,
director of the Red Crescent clinic in Samangan city, the capital of
Samangan province. Associated Press said that relief workers from the
U.N.'s World Food Program also reached the region and that they had put
the death toll at 100.</TE>
<TE>Villagers Watched as Gorge Collapsed</TE>
<TE>   Villagers said they were startled by violent shaking followed by a
thunderous roar shortly after 4:30 p.m. Sunday, and looked up to see the
sheer wall of the gorge collapse to the canyon floor, Halim said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a huge sound," he said. "The women and children were
frightened to death."</TE>
<TE>   As he spoke, loud cracking noises could be heard from the fractured
rock face, where chunks of unstable rock crashed down, kicking up plumes
of white powder. Behind Halim, a pale green lake had risen to the roofs
of the mud-brick houses.</TE>
<TE>   Water had backed up into the gorge for a quarter-mile and was still
rising Monday. Below the newly formed dam, a river that once ran three to
five feet deep was reduced to a trickle. Villagers continued to collect
and use the water, apparently unaware of the potential danger.</TE>
<TE>   No evacuation orders had been issued, but government officials
dispatched engineers to assess the debris dam's stability, according to
Khadam Hussain Natiqi, deputy governor of the province.</TE>
<TE>   Natiqi estimated that 3,000 residents were affected by the slide.</TE>
<TE>   A World Food Program-hired team was heading to the Salang Tunnel
linking Afghanistan's north and south to clear a quake-triggered slide
that was reported to have at least partially blocked the route, the food
program's spokeswoman Jennifer Abrahamson said in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. and Red Cross teams were en route to the north Monday to assess
damage, said Nigel Fisher, the deputy special envoy for U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.</TE>
<TE>   Two C-130 cargo planes loaded with food and items such as blankets and
medicine are on standby in Dushanbe, the Tajik capital, if needed to
provide emergency relief, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations is also in contact with the Halo Trust, part of the
U.N. Mine Action Program for Afghanistan, to obtain information on
possible mine sites in the earthquake-affected area, he said.</TE>
<TE>Quake's Epicenter Was 120 Miles Deep</TE>
<TE>   At the National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.,
Director Waverly Person said the Afghan earthquake was centered about 120
miles underneath the surface.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the kind of deep quake that is common in that region,"
Person said. "So strong a quake occurring at a shallow level would have
caused far more deaths and destruction." By contrast, California's
magnitude 6.7 Northridge quake in 1994 was about 12 miles deep.</TE>

<HD>Mexico's PRI Swears In Leader</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Bitterly disputed election ends as new party chief
praises rival candidate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>Mexico's former ruling party officially installed Roberto Madrazo
as its new leader Monday, averting a rupture even as it suffered a
setback in efforts to clean up its image as a corrupt political machine.</LD>
<LD>   In a sign of reconciliation between candidates who only last week
leveled bitter criticism at each other, Madrazo praised losing candidate
Beatriz Paredes during his swearing-in ceremony.</LD>
<LD>   Madrazo's victory caps an intense struggle for the soul of the PRI,
which lost its 71-year hold on Mexican politics in July 2000 when Vicente
Fox of the National Action Party swept to power.</LD>
<TE>   In the first election for the party leadership, Madrazo positioned
himself as someone who could work with President Fox and achieve
progress. He criticized his party's "obstructionism" over the past year.</TE>
<TE>   Paredes struck a more independent and populist tone, saying among
other things that globalization was an "exhausted" economic model.</TE>
<TE>   The PRI had hoped the election, which took place Feb. 24, would give
it a new, more democratic image, but widespread charges of
irregularities--corroborated by teams of independent observers and
academics who oversaw the polling--tended to reinforce its reputation for
corruption.</TE>
<TE>   "The door was blatantly open to abuses," said Meghan Bishop, a
researcher with the Washington-based Center for Strategic and
International Studies, who was with a team of poll observers in the state
of Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Madrazo's camp said votes were miscounted in the state of Mexico and
other Paredes strongholds, while Madrazo's supporters were accused of
stuffing ballot boxes in Tabasco and Oaxaca states.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, backward-looking and primitive segments within the
party fraudulently distorted the vote . . . thus harming the process at a
high cost for the PRI," Paredes said in a statement published in Sunday
morning newspapers here.</TE>
<TE>   A party commission voted 8-1 on Sunday to accept the results giving
1,518,063 votes to Madrazo, 49, the former governor of Tabasco state, and
1,486,217 to Paredes, 48, former governor of Tlaxcala state.</TE>
<TE>   Madrazo, whose election to the Tabasco governorship in 1994 was marked
by allegations of vote irregularities, was installed Monday at PRI's
headquarters here before 10,000 party loyalists. He struck a conciliatory
tone in his remarks.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to make with all the strength of my heart and partisan
conviction a respectful and fraternal salute to Beatriz Paredes for her
efforts and role representing the party," Madrazo said.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of a PRI split was also a problem for Fox, whose
difficulties in pushing his legislative agenda have been due partly to
the fractured PRI leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Any temptation that Paredes might have had to split off and form a new
party may have been doused by the harsh realities of such a move, said
Benito Nacif, director of political studies at the Center for Economic
Research and Teaching here.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes a lot of time to build a reputation as a political party and
electoral base," Nacif said, adding that the only successful one in
recent years has been the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, co-founded
by Cuauhtemoc Cardenas in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   If Madrazo follows through on his promise to work with the Fox
administration, his election means a new "political scenario for Mexico,"
said Federico Estevez, a political scientist at the Autonomous
Technological Institute of Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a window of opportunity for Madrazo to change his image, to
reinvent himself as a policy statesman. Fox is also desperate to have
something, to deliver on something," Estevez said.</TE>
<TE>   Rogelio Hernandez of the College of Mexico said the election's strong
turnout bolsters the party's power, as do recent polls that indicate
voter preference for the PRI is climbing as Fox's popularity slips.</TE>

in most places. "The worst is over," senior state government official
Ashok Narayan said.</LD>
<LD>   The violence was sparked when a Muslim mob burned a train carrying
Hindus. Police said they had arrested four Muslims in connection with the
attack.</LD>
<TE>   Scores of bodies are being recovered from wrecked homes and shops
every day, and police say the toll is likely to rise.</TE>

<HD>Israel Military Might Falling Short in Face of Guerrilla Warfare</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Army is under increasing criticism after series of
Palestinian attacks on roadblocks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Twenty-four hours before he and nine other Israelis were shot dead
by a Palestinian sniper, Lt. David Damelin telephoned his mother. He
described his feelings of vulnerability stationed at a remote West Bank
roadblock, the enemy unseen in surrounding hills.</LD>
<LD>   "We feel like sitting ducks," he told her.</LD>
<LD>   Damelin, whose story was recounted Monday in the Israeli newspaper
Maariv, was one of seven soldiers and three Jewish settlers picked off
Sunday morning by a sniper who fired 25 shots in 25 minutes using a World
War II-era rifle. It was a devastating blow to the Israeli army, which
suffered the most deaths in a single incident in years.</LD>
<TE>   As fighting here escalates, the army, Israel's most cherished
institution, has suffered a string of humiliating failures that has
alarmed a desperate public and amplified voices of dissent both within
the military's ranks and without.</TE>
<TE>   Criticism of the military leadership is also the underpinning of a
wider, anguished debate over how to conduct the war with the
Palestinians--how to win it, how to end it. Reeling from some of the
bloodiest violence in years, Israelis for the most part know that they
want a clear-cut resolution but are at a loss on what that might be. Some
say it is finally time to wage all-out war and destroy the Palestinian
Authority once and for all. Others caution that military might alone will
not bring peace and that there is still a role for diplomacy.</TE>
<TE>   The debate reaches into the Cabinet of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. At
a stormy session Sunday in which he ultimately ordered a massive military
campaign against the Palestinians, Sharon listened to one of his
ministers, Avigdor Lieberman, advocate airstrikes on Palestinian markets,
banks and electricity grids.</TE>
<TE>   Shimon Peres, the dovish foreign minister, responded in horror that
such actions would send Israel to an international war crimes tribunal
like former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care," Lieberman answered.</TE>
<TE>   But the shortcomings of Israel's military might--especially when it is
pitted against irregular guerrilla commandos--have been painfully on
display in recent days.</TE>
<TE>   The sniper shootings at the checkpoint Sunday that claimed the life of
Damelin, a 29-year-old reservist and platoon commander, represented "a
massive blunder and a disgrace for the Israeli Defense Forces," said Zeev
Schiff, veteran military affairs commentator for the Haaretz newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   According to survivors, the sniper aimed for heads, avoiding the flak
jackets most of the soldiers were wearing. When the soldiers began
returning fire, they apparently were disoriented by the echo of the
sniper's bullets and initially shot in the wrong direction.</TE>
<TE>   The checkpoint, near the Jewish settlement of Ofra, was especially
vulnerable because it sat in a narrow valley that was hard to protect.
The attack came 12 days after six soldiers were killed at a roadblock
about 15 miles away. In both cases, the assailants escaped.</TE>
<TE>   "The [army] has yet to learn its roadblock lesson," Schiff noted. "The
series of attacks, which are more in line with guerrilla warfare than
terror tactics, will certainly raise Palestinian morale and damage the
[army's] prestige."</TE>
<TE>   All of the soldiers slain near Ofra were reservists; one was nearly 40
years old. (Most Israeli men are required to do regular reserve duty
until about 45.) Newspapers, Web sites and radio shows Monday aired
numerous complaints from reservists and their families who contended that
reserve troops are not given adequate training, equipment or protection,
yet are required to perform dangerous duty.</TE>
<TE>   "We are suckers," a reservist from the town of Nahariya said.</TE>
<TE>   The shootings near Ofra were especially galling for many here because
senior army commanders had just declared victory in a series of raids
into two Palestinian refugee camps.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday afternoon, Col. Aviv Kochavi, commander of a paratroop
brigade who led the charge into the Balata refugee camp in the West Bank
city of Nablus, toured the conquered camp with reporters. Balata is a
notorious center of armed Palestinian resistance, but Kochavi was pleased
to announce that the Palestinian gunmen had fled and that his own men had
suffered few casualties.</TE>
<TE>   "The tiger known as Balata has turned out to be a pussycat," Kochavi
said.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's checkpoint episode, commentators here said, was an example of
the Israeli army trying to assert its invincibility only to have the
attempt backfire. A militia affiliated with Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement, the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade,
claimed responsibility for both the sniper attack and a devastating
suicide bombing in the heart of Jerusalem the night before. It said the
attacks were carried out to avenge Israel's deadly incursions into the
camps.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time we try to send a 'message' to the Palestinians, we get it
thrown right back in our faces," political analyst Hemi Shalev wrote on
Maariv's front page. "Every solution merely aggravates the problem, every
escalation makes itself worse many times over."</TE>
<TE>   The army command and Sharon's government rejected the idea that there
was a connection between the Palestinian attacks and the Israeli attacks.
Israel seized the camps, they said, to capture militants and their
weapons and take away their sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   But most of the gunmen in Balata slipped out ahead of the Israeli
arrival, ready to fight another day.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian attackers have displayed more audacity and lethal
efficiency in a number of recent operations. Marwan Barghouti, a West
Bank leader of Fatah and key lieutenant to Arafat, praised the checkpoint
shootings as "an excellent attack" that would be repeated.</TE>
<TE>   "The expertise of our people will increase, and they will become more
qualified day by day," Barghouti said Monday at a rally by the Islamic
militant movement Hamas after Israel killed the wife and children of a
Hamas leader. The army said the Hamas leader, and not his family, was the
target of tank shells fired into the West Bank city of Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   Danny Rothschild, a retired Israeli army general who headed Israel's
administrative authority over the West Bank and Gaza Strip, said Monday
that mounting large-scale operations, such as the raids on the refugee
camps, to combat guerrilla warfare was a mistake. And he and other
critics said too many military decisions were being based on political
considerations instead of sound strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Rothschild is president of the Council for Peace and Security, a group
of about 300 retired military and intelligence officers who recently
advocated that Israel withdraw from most of the West Bank and Gaza to
defensible borders.</TE>
<TE>   Posting the checkpoint near Ofra was an illustration of the folly of
heeding political rather than military concerns, Rothschild said.
Although checkpoints along Israel's border serve the purpose of
preventing potential terrorists from entering the country, some
roadblocks are posted in remote West Bank locations to protect Jewish
settlers scattered over hilltop enclaves. Soldiers are put in harm's way
for the benefit of small groups of settlers, Rothschild said. Settlers
constitute a powerful political lobby, however, and Sharon is determined
to protect them.</TE>
<TE>   "The government is willing to please voices of public opinion and
maybe in the short term even succeed," Rothschild said. "But in the long
term, it doesn't bring any comfort to anyone."</TE>

<LD>Thousands of supporters of Madagascar's opposition leader and
self-declared president swarmed government ministries in an attempt to
install alternative Cabinet ministers.</LD>
<LD>   As the protests grew to include 10 ministries, it was unclear whether
the alternative Cabinet had in effect taken office. Soldiers guarding the
ministries did not prevent the alternative ministers from entering.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a very big day," said Marc Ravalomanana, mayor of the
capital, Antananarivo, who proclaimed himself president last month.</LD>
<TE>   President Didier Ratsiraka's government has barely been functioning
since an opposition-led strike began several weeks ago, keeping civil
servants at home. His ministers were reportedly not at work Monday.</TE>

<HD>Pakistani Denies Father Passed Nuclear Secrets</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>A former Pakistani nuclear scientist suspected of links to Islamic
extremists met Osama bin Laden twice in Afghanistan but did not reveal
any nuclear secrets, the scientist's son asserted Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Bashiruddin Mehmood, who retired from Pakistan's Atomic Energy
Commission in 1999, did not tell his family that he had met with Bin
Laden in 2000 and 2001, said his son, Asim Mehmood.</LD>
<LD>   The younger Mehmood said the family learned about the meetings after
Pakistani authorities detained his father in October to investigate
possible ties to Bin Laden's Al Qaeda network and its efforts to obtain
nuclear technology.</LD>
<TE>   Mehmood said his father never discussed nuclear technology with Bin
Laden, and he insisted that his father never revealed any nuclear
secrets.</TE>
<TE>   "These are all allegations. There is no truth in them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have long been suspicious of Bashiruddin Mehmood's
contacts with Bin Laden, according to Pakistani officials who spoke on
condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. Security Council ordered the assets of Ummah Tameer-e-Nau, a
charity Mehmood organized after his retirement, frozen in December after
the United States declared it an organization with terrorist ties.</TE>
<TE>   According to his son, Mehmood went to Afghanistan in 2000 in
connection with the charity, which planned ventures including a flour
mill and irrigation projects. He said Mehmood sank his savings in the
ventures and hoped to profit.</TE>
<TE>   Asim Mehmood said his father also met Taliban supreme leader Mullah
Mohammed Omar, and that his father wanted to interest Bin Laden in
financing a polytechnic college in the Afghan capital, Kabul. "But Osama
was not interested," the son said.</TE>
<TE>   In January, the Pakistani government decided not to prosecute
Bashiruddin Mehmood but to keep him under tight surveillance.</TE>

<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>The U.S. government is drafting a plan that would allow Florida
authorities to arrest illegal immigrants deemed threats to national
security.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a big deal, it's revolutionary," said Joe Greene, assistant
commissioner of investigations for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service. "There's a role in homeland security for an appropriate mix of
the INS with the support of local and state law enforcement officials."</LD>
<LD>   Florida would be the first state where state and local authorities
carry authority previously held only by federal agents. Officials said
Monday that the Florida plan may be in place by next month.</LD>
<TE>   Under the proposal, local authorities could arrest suspected illegal
immigrants on civil charges. They already can detain immigrants on
criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   At least 15 of the 19 suspected Sept. 11 hijackers had Florida
connections, and three were in the country on expired visas.</TE>

<HD>In Rights Report, U.S. Criticizes Nations Vital to War on Terror</HD>
<DH>Policy: Annual study cites violations of freedoms in countries such
as Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Israel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A number of countries vital to the U.S. war on terrorism come under
harsh criticism for severe violations of basic freedoms in the annual
U.S. human rights report, released Monday by the State Department.</LD>
<LD>   The countries include Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan,
Russia, Turkey, China and even Israel.</LD>
<LD>   The violations include torture in Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Russia;
extrajudicial killings in Pakistan; and prolonged detentions without
trial in Uzbekistan on the basis of evidence planted by security forces.</LD>
<TE>   The survey of nearly 190 countries also charges that nations such as
China and Uzbekistan have used the war on terrorism as cover for
crackdowns on dissidents demanding freedoms and reform.</TE>
<TE>   The report underscores the basic dilemma faced by the Bush
administration as it struggles to hold together a coalition to combat
terrorism while promoting--and staying true to--its own values.</TE>
<TE>   Before unveiling the report, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said
the United States "will not relax" its commitment to advancing the cause
of democracy, because terrorism cannot thrive in places where fundamental
freedoms are available.</TE>
<TE>   "Freedom fights terrorism, instability and conflict," Powell said at a
news conference.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the 6,000-page survey immediately triggered criticism of the
administration from international human rights groups and members of
Congress. One of the foremost complaints was that there is a growing gap
between the United States' rhetoric and its practices.</TE>
<TE>   "The administration is candid and accurate in pointing out the
problems, but it's still doing virtually nothing to address them," said
Thomas Malinowski, advocacy director of Human Rights Watch, an
international monitoring group.</TE>
<TE>   "Its argument that human rights still matters is not reflected in the
alliance that the United States is forging, the money it's spending or
the military bases it's building overseas," Malinowski said.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Tom Lantos of San Mateo, Calif., the ranking Democrat on the
House International Relations Committee and co-chairman of the
Congressional Human Rights Caucus, called on the administration to
"redouble" efforts to promote democracy in nations such as Sudan, Saudi
Arabia, Syria and China that are pivotal in the war against terrorism but
cited in the report for major rights abuses.</TE>
<TE>   "The war against terrorism is the ultimate struggle for human rights,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups also charged that the administration is going soft
on abuses in countries that are key allies in the anti-terrorism
campaign. The survey is striking for the way it recasts abuses in the
context of the war, thereby easing pressure on governments to act, the
groups said.</TE>
<TE>   "The characterization of human rights violations has changed this
year," said Alex Arriaga, Amnesty International's director of government
relations in Washington. "There's greater reporting on the countries that
the administration believes are involved in terrorism, while there's some
soft-pedaling on U.S. allies."</TE>
<TE>   In the past, for example, the survey has reported on Pakistan's
practice of holding families hostage in order to pressure suspected
extremists into turning themselves in, she said. Although the practice
continues, the report this year did not mention it.</TE>
<TE>   The report's language has also changed. Rebels in the breakaway
Russian republic of Chechnya were described in last year's report as
"separatists," while this year they are "fighters." Last year, Uzbek
security forces were cited for arbitrary arrests and detentions of "pious
Muslims" on false charges; this year they are linked to arrests of
Muslims "suspected of extremist sympathies" on false charges, according
to Sharon Burke, advocacy director of Amnesty International.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Mideast, the report says that in response to about 2,000
terrorist attacks, Israel has detained Palestinians without charges,
coerced confessions and engaged in harassment and abuse at checkpoints.</TE>
<TE>   The report describes Israel's record in the occupied territories as
poor. Israel is also cited for its treatment of Arab citizens in its own
territory.</TE>
<TE>   But Amnesty officials said the report is soft on Israel compared with
past years.</TE>
<TE>   The report indicates that all Israeli actions against the Palestinians
were the result of provocations, and it does not cite Israel for acts
such as Ariel Sharon's controversial visit to Jerusalem's Temple Mount in
September 2000, several months before he was elected prime minister. The
visit enraged Muslims and immediately preceded the outbreak of the
current intifada.</TE>
<TE>   The document this year "goes out of its way to justify" Israeli
actions, Burke said.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians, the report says, have "attacked Israelis, including
settlers, other civilians and soldiers, on a daily basis in the occupied
territories and Israel proper."</TE>
<TE>   The survey, mandated by Congress, also says:</TE>
<TE>   * Pakistani police have engaged in chronic abuses, including rape and
murder, for which no officer has yet been convicted.</TE>
<TE>   * Saudi Arabia has employed torture, forced confessions, arbitrary
arrests, trial without legal counsel and widespread intimidation of both
its own citizens and foreigners. Riyadh has also failed to issue a report
on its findings in the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing, which killed 19 U.S.
troops.</TE>
<TE>   * In Uzbekistan, security forces have tortured, beaten and harassed
dissidents and planted narcotics, weapons and banned literature on
Muslims suspected of having extremist sympathies.</TE>
<TE>   * In dealing with Chechnya, Russia has shown "little respect" for
basic human rights. Credible reports also claim that both the government
and rebels have engaged in extrajudicial killings.</TE>
<TE>   * China has used the U.S.-led war on terrorism to cover up its
crackdown on Uighur Muslims in the western region of Xinjiang. Beijing
has also suppressed "any person, group, whether religious, political or
social," viewed as a threat to government power. Practices include
torture and extrajudicial killings.</TE>
<TE>   * Turkey, which has problems with its Kurdish population, has engaged
in "widespread" torture and beatings of prisoners.</TE>

<HD>Tranquil Winter Olympics Serving as Blueprint for Security
Operations</HD>
<DH>Safety: Officials chalk up their success in Utah to improved
technology, intelligence-gathering and organization.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Security operations at the Winter Olympics proved so successful in
avoiding major disruptions or violence that law enforcement officials
have already begun using the Salt Lake City model as a blueprint for
major events.</LD>
<LD>   In the face of post-Sept. 11 fears about the safety of the 1.6 million
people who attended the Games, authorities combined a new organizational
structure, aggressive intelligence-gathering, advanced technology and a
phalanx of more than 10,000 military and civilian personnel to produce an
event marked by only a few small security hitches.</LD>
<LD>   "We were very happy that the Olympics went off so well," FBI Director
Robert S. Mueller said Friday. The security model for the Utah Games is
one "that we wish to replicate, not just in the future Olympics," but in
other major national and global events, he said.</LD>
<TE>   The wall of security erected by about 60 federal, state and local law
enforcement agencies over the last four years was tested repeatedly
during the 17 days of the Olympics without buckling. Among the incidents
recounted by officials in Washington and Utah who led the operation:</TE>
<TE>   * Eighteen errant pilots and would-be sightseers flew into a vast
no-fly zone above Salt Lake City in the weeks before and during the
Games, only to be warned away or escorted out by F-16 military jets.</TE>
<TE>   * A man whom authorities described as mentally disturbed tried to
scale a fence at one athletic venue but was quickly apprehended after he
was spotted by security video cameras and personnel on the scene. And
several adventure-seekers on foot and snowmobiles who wanted a closer
look at the Olympic terrain were escorted away after infrared and thermal
technology detected them crossing into restricted areas.</TE>
<TE>   * The public, warned by President Bush himself to watch for anything
unusual, flooded Salt Lake City authorities with more than 600 tips about
"suspicious" packages--bags left unattended, for instance, or a lunch
pail discarded in a trash can. Police checked out all the tips and didn't
find any threats that were credible, said David Tubbs, a retired FBI
agent who headed the Utah Olympic Public Safety Command.</TE>
<TE>   * And federal officials received several reports from domestic and
foreign sources about suspected terrorists "possibly" targeting the
Olympics, according to a U.S. intelligence official who asked not to be
identified. With the CIA taking a bigger role in Olympic-related security
than in years past, officials moved to determine whether the reports were
credible and concluded that the safety of the Games was never
compromised.</TE>
<TE>   A few 11th-hour slip-ups may have marred efforts to score a perfect 10
in the security operation.</TE>
<TE>   On the last day of the Olympics, two Secret Service agents buying
souvenirs at a shop mistakenly left behind paperwork that included
details on security arrangements for Vice President Dick Cheney's
appearance at the closing ceremony hours later. The shop owner called
authorities to report the lost papers but couldn't get anyone to pick
them up.</TE>
<TE>   That same day, an explosion at a power substation near Salt Lake
International Airport cut power to about 30,000 residences after someone
apparently evaded round-the-clock security and planted an explosive
device. The FBI does not believe the explosion was the work of
terrorists, or even that the Olympics were a specific target, because the
damaged circuit breaker did not provide power to Olympic sites and no one
has claimed responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the Secret Service blunder nor the explosion affected planning
or operations for the closing ceremony, officials said. And overall, "we
never dealt with any type of situation where we felt we were under
attack," said Mark Camillo, Olympic coordinator for the Secret Service,
one of the lead federal agencies in the security operation.</TE>
<TE>   There were only about 20 arrests made during the Games at venue sites,
nearly all of them for drunk and disorderly conduct and other minor
offenses. "For an event this size, that's a phenomenally low total,"
Tubbs said.</TE>
<TE>   Camillo and many others in the security operation believe that the
security detail massed for the Olympics effectively deterred terrorists
or anyone else who might have been looking to cause trouble. Authorities
picked up on one report, for instance, that an animal rights group
scuttled its plans to disrupt a rodeo attraction during the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Salt Lake City "just wasn't an attractive target because of the level
of security we had," Camillo said.</TE>
<TE>   Even before Sept. 11, law enforcement officials realized that the
global spectacle of the Olympic Games made them a particularly inviting
target for terrorists. The shadow of past Olympic tragedies hung over the
Games--the 1972 murders of 11 Israeli athletes in Munich, Germany, and
the still-unsolved 1996 bombing in an Atlanta park that killed one person
and injured more than 100 others.</TE>
<TE>   Mindful of the events in Atlanta, federal officials vowed to ratchet
up security for America's next appearance on the Olympic stage.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, President Clinton gave the federal government the lead in
planning security for Salt Lake City, with the Secret Service, the FBI
and the Federal Emergency Management Agency ordered to work closely with
local and state officials in Utah to ensure safety.</TE>
<TE>   The aim, which authorities said was achieved in Salt Lake City, was to
better designate assignments and avoid the chain-of-command problems
encountered in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "In Atlanta, there was confusion. The bomb went off, and the question
was, 'Who's in charge?' " said Don Johnson, the FBI's special agent in
charge of the Salt Lake City office. "We tried to work out those issues
here."</TE>
<TE>   With the new framework laid out early in the planning process, the
money soon followed. Federal officials devoted $310 million to security
at Salt Lake City--more than triple the federal outlay for the Atlanta
Games six years ago.</TE>
<TE>   But as well-prepared as security officials thought they were, the
attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon forced them to rethink
some of their basic assumptions.</TE>
<TE>   "Sept. 11 was really a shot across the bow for us," said Maj. Stuart
Smith of the Utah Department of Public Safety, who was deputy director of
the Utah Olympic Public Safety Command. "It sent the message that we're
certainly not immune [to attack] and that the level and scale could be
far beyond what anyone imagined."</TE>
<TE>   Federal, state and local authorities scrambled to rewrite security
measures.</TE>
<TE>   They scrapped some nonsporting events considered potentially
vulnerable. They secured an additional $30 million in federal funds.
After an inspection by U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, they committed 50
additional security officers to patrol outlying gathering spots like the
one where the Atlanta bomb exploded.</TE>
<TE>   They tightened the protocol for dealing with biological and chemical
attacks after the October anthrax mailings. And they paid particularly
close attention to the threat of an air attack, creating a much bigger
no-fly zone, with a radius of 45 miles.</TE>
<TE>   "We had enough aircraft out there at any given time to intercept
within a minute or two any incursion into the airspace and to identify
any aircraft within 200 miles," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to ensure the safety of Bush, Cheney and dignitaries from
around the world, authorities relied heavily on technology. In addition
to infrared and thermal equipment to detect intruders, officials
developed advanced computer models to track and collate data on
suspicious activities, and they made occasional use of digital
recognition equipment--a controversial method of photographing crowds and
matching the scanned images to those of suspects.</TE>
<TE>   One key to the success of the security operation, all agreed, was how
closely federal agencies worked with their state and local police
counterparts. The FBI and other federal agencies are often regarded as
arrogant by local law enforcement, but in Salt Lake City, complaints of
federal heavy-handedness were almost nonexistent, and 27 members of the
state safety command were given top-secret clearance to track threats,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Robert F. Bennett (R-Utah), who attended the Games, said Salt
Lake was "a perfect blueprint" for how events of such a huge scale should
be protected, a sentiment that he said Homeland Security Director Thomas
J. Ridge shared with him.</TE>
<TE>   "People will be paying close attention to what happened in Salt
Lake--or more importantly what didn't happen in Salt Lake--because it
demonstrates what can be accomplished when you have this degree of
coordination between local, state and federal law enforcement," Bennett
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The reaction I was getting from the folks who ran the command center
was 'Senator, this is boring,' " Bennett added. "And in the security
business, boring is good."</TE>

<HD>Hospital Alerts Patients About Health Danger</HD>
<DH>Medicine: A defective instrument at Johns Hopkins may have spread
dangerous bacteria during lung procedures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore alerted 415 patients Monday
that a defective instrument capable of spreading life-threatening lung
infections may have been used in a medical procedure they underwent.</LD>
<LD>   In a certified letter, hospital officials said that "although it is
impossible to know if you are at risk," patients who had been examined by
bronchoscopes--a thin, tube-like instrument with a tiny camera used to
probe the lungs--should call their doctors if they experience fever,
coughing, phlegm or shortness of breath.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman at Johns Hopkins, one of the nation's leading hospitals,
said some patients who underwent the procedure had died, but it was
unknown whether their deaths were a result of bacteria introduced by the
instruments or their existing illnesses. Most of the 415 patients suffer
from cystic fibrosis, AIDS or lung cancer, or recently had lung
transplants.</LD>
<TE>   The Baltimore Sun reported Sunday that Hopkins officials discovered
the problem after an unusually high number of patients--128, or two or
three times higher than normal--had been infected with a bacterium known
as Pseudomonas aeruginosa after undergoing the procedure with
bronchoscopes manufactured by Olympus America.</TE>
<TE>   Puzzled by the high rates, doctors conducted extensive investigations.
They discovered in February that four of the seven Olympus America
bronchoscopes in use at Johns Hopkins were defective--a tiny screw-in
valve on the instrument was loose--and the hospital stopped using the
model in question.</TE>
<TE>   The model was voluntarily recalled by New York-based Olympus America
in November, the Sun reported, but Johns Hopkins did not learn of the
action immediately because a copy of the recall letter was sent to a
wrong department at the hospital. Other companies also manufacture
bronchoscopes and patients who have been examined by them should not
consider themselves at risk, doctors said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of Johns Hopkins' experience, other hospitals in the country
were checking their medical records to see if they had a similar problem.
The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention are investigating the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Pseudomonas infections are relatively common in patients with damaged
immune systems. The bronchoscope procedure is also common, performed
about 460,000 times a year in the United States. But instruments that are
not properly disinfected can cause infection, which was the subject of an
FDA health advisory in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   For Johns Hopkins University, the nation's largest recipient of
federal medical research funds, the bronchoscope problem is the latest in
a string of embarrassments.</TE>
<TE>   In November, the university barred a doctor from leading research
involving human subjects after he tested experimental cancer drugs on
patients in India without approval of a university review board. There
was no evidence patients were harmed.</TE>
<TE>   And in July, the U.S. government temporarily halted all federally
funded research on humans for five days after the death of a volunteer in
an asthma experiment. The university had about 2,400 experiments underway
at the time.</TE>

<HD>Ryan Weighs Clemency for All on Ill. Death Row</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO
</DL>
<LD>Illinois Gov. George Ryan said he is considering whether to commute
the sentences of all 163 inmates on the state's death row.</LD>
<LD>   The moderate Republican acknowledged the possibility during a recent
symposium, a disclosure that adds to this state's roiling debate over the
death penalty. It comes as an Illinois commission he appointed is poised
to release recommendations on what to do about the state's death penalty.</LD>
<LD>   The 68-year-old governor imposed a moratorium on executions in January
2000. Ryan, who approved Illinois' last execution in March 1999, ordered
the moratorium after several inmates condemned to die were found to have
been falsely accused.</LD>
<TE>   Ryan described events leading up to that decision and his evolving
views on capital punishment in a speech last weekend at a University of
Oregon law school symposium. He cited statistics showing that since
Illinois reinstated executions in 1977, 12 people have been executed,
while 13 death row inmates were exonerated by the courts.</TE>
<TE>   "We freed 13 innocent men who were nearly strapped to a gurney in the
state's death chamber so that fatal doses of poison could be injected
into their bloodstreams. That is the ultimate nightmare," Ryan said in
the speech Friday night, adding that even 99% accuracy isn't good enough.</TE>
<TE>   "If government can't get this right, it ought not be in the business
of passing such final, irreversible judgment," said Ryan, who is leaving
office in January.</TE>
<TE>   During a subsequent question-and-answer period, Ryan was asked whether
his faith was so shaken in the legal system that he would commute all of
the sentences that put 159 men and four women on Illinois' death row.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'We're looking at that, we might do that,' " said Dennis
Collatin, Ryan's press secretary, who was at the event.</TE>
<TE>   If Ryan follows through, it would be the most sweeping reversal of
death sentences since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1972 that capital
punishment was "cruel and unusual punishment" because juries were
arbitrary in imposing it--overturning the death sentences for 600 inmates
nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   States began rewriting the laws, and in 1976 the Supreme Court allowed
executions again under statutes that require a second jury hearing to
impose the death penalty. There are more than 3,700 inmates awaiting the
death chamber in 38 states.</TE>
<TE>   Aides say they already have given Ryan files on all the death row
inmates in anticipation of a report from the Commission on Capital
Punishment, a 14-member panel he appointed in May 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Death penalty opponents praised Ryan's comments, calling them part of
his philosophical "progression" from a staunch supporter of capital
punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Commutation "would be the only reasonable and conscionable thing to do
given the errors that have occurred in the Illinois death penalty
system," said Nancy Bothne, Midwest regional director of Amnesty
International in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Death penalty proponents, however, said Ryan's remarks were
unconscionable--as a wholesale condemnation of the judicial system. "This
is the first time we've heard a governor indicate to some extent that he
might be willing to throw the baby out with the bathwater on this," said
Michael Rashford, president of the Sacramento-based Criminal Justice
Legal Foundation, which filed briefs in support of the death penalty
before the Supreme Court.</TE>

<HD>No Evidence Yates Was Psychotic, Doctor Says</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The psychiatrist who decided to take Andrea Yates off
anti-psychotic medication testified that he saw no evidence she was
psychotic when he examined her two days before she drowned her five
children.</LD>
<LD>   Yates' husband, Russell, contends his wife didn't receive adequate
care during two extended stays at Devereux Texas Treatment Network, where
Dr. Mohammad Saeed was a unit medical director, and that the children
might be alive if she had received proper care.</LD>
<LD>   Saeed said he decided June 4 to gradually take Andrea Yates, 37, off
her medication because he thought it was hindering her progress. "I
cannot find any evidence that psychosis was playing any important role,"
Saeed testified at the murder trial in Houston.</LD>

<HD>Abuse in Nursing Care Focus of Report</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Nursing home patients have been dragged down hallways, doused with
ice water, sexually assaulted and beaten in their beds, yet few
prosecutions have resulted, a congressional investigation found.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, the son of one beating victim tearfully gave senators a
message from his late mother: "I don't want anyone else to suffer like
this."</LD>
<LD>   Describing the attack on his mother, Helen, in a Sacramento nursing
home, Bruce Love said that by testifying, "I am here today to fulfill my
mother's request."</LD>
<TE>   The 18-month review by the Senate Aging Committee concluded that many
physical and sexual abuse cases in nursing homes are not treated the same
as similar crimes elsewhere. Its evidence includes a dramatic deathbed
interview with one victim.</TE>
<TE>   On a videotape shown at the hearing, Helen Love, 75, sat with a metal
band pinned to her skull and described the 1998 beating she said was
delivered by a caretaker after she soiled herself.</TE>
<TE>   "He started beating me all along the bed," the elderly women said in a
slurred voice as she described the attacks to lawyers. "He choked me and
he went and broke my neck. He broke my wrist bones, my hand. He put his
hand over my mouth."</TE>
<TE>   Love died two days later from the trauma. The nursing home staff
member eventually pleaded no contest to elder abuse and served a year in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Love had difficulty getting through his written statement. The
incident was not reported to a state official who was in the nursing home
at the time of the beating, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Love quoted his mother as saying: "All my life I have feared being
neglected in a nursing home, and now I know what it is like. I was so
close to death and somehow survived that attack. I don't want anyone else
to suffer like this. Please, son, tell someone who can help."</TE>
<TE>   The investigation found that nursing homes rarely call police for
attacks that would bring an instant response if they occurred elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "A crime is a crime, whether in or outside of a nursing home, where
residents should not spend their days living in fear," said Sen. John B.
Breaux (D-La.), the committee chairman.</TE>
<TE>   About 1.6 million Americans are cared for in 17,000 nursing homes. The
homes received $58.4 billion in reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid
in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Government figures show that from July through September 2000, nearly
26% of nursing homes were cited for violations that ranged from actual
harm to residents to poor record-keeping and failure to put into practice
policies to prevent abuse. Fewer than 2% of the cases involved actual
harm to residents.</TE>
<TE>   Nursing home industry officials said most facilities provide quality
care. "We deplore any that do not," said Alan DeFend, spokesman for the
American Health Care Assn., which represents 12,000 mostly for-profit
nursing homes.</TE>

<HD>Final Action on Voting Overhaul Measure Stalls Again in Senate</HD>
<DH>Politics: Daschle shelves the bill after Democrats fail to overcome
a GOP-led filibuster.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>With negotiations dragging on longer than expected, final action
stalled again Monday in the Senate on legislation to overhaul the
nation's voting machinery and procedures.</LD>
<LD>   Democrats failed for the second time in four days to overcome a
Republican-led filibuster of the bill, prompting Senate Majority Leader
Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) to shelve the measure. He said that lawmakers today
would instead begin a lengthy debate on energy policy.</LD>
<LD>   Daschle and proponents of election reform in both parties refused to
declare the bill dead, despite the recent setbacks to it. They said
passage could come at any time in the next few weeks after negotiators
iron out final details.</LD>
<TE>   "Because so much good work has been done, it's my strong desire to
bring this bill to a successful completion," Daschle said. "And we're
going to do that."</TE>
<TE>   "All of us want to pass a bill," said Sen. Mitch McConnell of
Kentucky, the measure's lead Republican sponsor.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats and Republicans for months have agreed on the basic outline
of a bill that would distribute $3.5 billion over five years to help
states upgrade antiquated voting systems and take other steps to improve
voter participation and cut down on potential fraud. If enacted, it would
be a landmark expansion of the federal role in an election process
historically administered by state and local officials.</TE>
<TE>   The bill is the Senate's response to the vote-counting problems and
other issues that emerged in the 2000 presidential election in Florida
and elsewhere. The House passed its own version of an election reform
bill in December by a broad bipartisan margin.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers and analysts alike agree that the United States is under
considerable pressure to fix problems that surfaced in the 2000 election.</TE>
<TE>   "Our politicians over the years have been free to criticize other
countries over voter fraud," said Sheldon Kamieniecki, a political
scientist at the University of Southern California who studies election
reform.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can't put our own house in order, it really undermines our own
credibility," Kamieniecki said.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate, however, has been stuck for more than a week on issues
such as how best to deter voter fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those questions appeared resolved last week, as key lawmakers
agreed to accept the bulk of a GOP proposal to require first-time voters
who register by mail to show some form of identification before casting a
ballot.</TE>
<TE>   But congressional aides said senators were still haggling over a few
remaining details, including language proposed by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.)
to protect his state's unique vote-by-mail system.</TE>
<TE>   The continued impasse reflects the difficulty of negotiating a bill
that directly affects how lawmakers are elected.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans generally have supported stricter rules to crack down on
alleged voter fraud, while Democrats have backed steps to expand the
electorate.</TE>

<HD>Freer Electricity Market Upheld</HD>
<DH>Deregulation: Decision by Supreme Court backs federal rules aimed
at widening competition and lowering rates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court upheld federal rules Monday that move in the
direction of creating a national market for electricity.</LD>
<LD>   In a 9-0 ruling, the justices said that once electric power moves onto
interstate transmission lines, it is freed of a state's regulatory
control.</LD>
<LD>   This freer market should "encourage lower electricity rates,"
especially for big power users, by creating "competitive bulk power
markets," the high court said in endorsing the 1996 rules set by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</LD>
<TE>   However, states retain some regulatory control over the retail
electric rates that utilities charge their customers. On a separate 6-3
vote, the justices rejected a claim from now-bankrupt Enron Power
Marketing that such power sales should be freed from state regulation as
well.</TE>
<TE>   Experts in electric energy called Monday's mixed decision significant
but not surprising.</TE>
<TE>   On the one hand, it merely upheld 6-year-old regulations and rebuffed
regulators from nine states. However, neither last year's energy crisis
in California nor the Enron Corp. bankruptcy persuaded the justices to
reconsider the move toward national deregulation of energy.</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear whether the ruling will have much impact in
California, energy regulators said.</TE>
<TE>   The state moved early to deregulate the sale of electric power and to
encourage competition. But the steep spike in power prices last year
prompted lots of second-guessing.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the California Public Utilities Commission switched sides
on the issue and belatedly joined the nine other states, led by New York,
that challenged FERC's move to deregulate.</TE>
<TE>   But Monday's ruling sharply limits California's authority to
re-regulate the electricity business.</TE>
<TE>   "This confirms there has been a significant erosion of the state's
ability to protect its consumers," said William Julian II, an attorney
for the state PUC.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest winners of the deregulation move, energy experts said, are
large users of electric power who can take advantage of lower, bulk rates
from the interstate power grid--mostly huge manufacturers such as Ford
Motor Co. and DuPont Co. The losers in this move toward national
competition tend to be older and smaller power producers, who may lose
business to out-of-state competition.</TE>
<TE>   "This gets us back on the track to restructuring the last big monopoly
and heading toward a truly competitive market," said John Hughes,
director of the Electricity Consumers Resource Council, which represents
large manufacturers that want to buy power at the lowest rates. "We
believe this [electricity] is naturally an interstate market, and we're
encouraged the Supreme Court agrees."</TE>
<TE>   A coalition of independent power producers also applauded the ruling.
The court and FERC are "right to seek an end to discriminatory,
anti-competitive practices and to make sure customers have access to the
lowest possible prices," said Lynne H. Church, president of the Electric
Power Supply Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Power producers have been somewhat divided over the move toward
national competition. Some say they want to sell their excess power
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   However, some local utilities say competition is not entirely fair,
since they have costly legal duties to provide electricity to all their
customers at all times, including, for example, homes in rural areas.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the electric industry has been moving steadily toward
deregulation and wider competition.</TE>
<TE>   Justice John Paul Stevens said the law is simply catching up with a
basic change in the nature of electric power distribution.</TE>
<TE>   In 1935, when Congress passed the first Federal Power Act, electricity
was a local business. Power plants served their own communities. State
utility commissions regulated these local monopolies.</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1970s, electric power has moved on huge networks or grids.
The "Eastern Interconnect" serves most of the nation east of the Rocky
Mountains, while the "Western Interconnect" serves California and the
West.</TE>
<TE>   "Any electricity that enters the grid immediately becomes a part of
the vast pool of energy that is constantly moving in interstate
commerce," Stevens said. "As a result, it is now possible for power
companies to transmit electric energy over long distance at a low cost."</TE>
<TE>   But since local utilities often owned the transmission lines, they
could block the interstate competition. In 1996, FERC adopted rules that
required the utilities to open their transmission lines for a fee.</TE>
<TE>   "Transmission is the vital link between sellers and buyers," the
agency said.</TE>
<TE>   The nine states went to court to challenge FERC's authority. They said
they had control of the retail rates charged to customers, even if the
electricity moved on the interstate grid. But Stevens said federal law
allows the agency to deregulate the movement of this electricity "without
regard to whether the transmissions are sold to a reseller or directly to
a consumer."</TE>
<TE>   All the justices agreed to this conclusion in New York vs. FERC,
00-568. Justices Clarence Thomas, Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy said
they would have gone farther and forced FERC to deregulate electricity
sales even in the areas where local utilities sell directly to their
customers.</TE>

<LD>Gov. Bob Holden on Monday declared an economic emergency in
Missouri, the first step toward drawing from a state savings fund to
finance government services facing likely cuts.</LD>
<LD>   Holden's declaration seeks to use $135 million from the state reserve
fund to pay for mental health services, public transit and other
government functions in his budget for fiscal 2003, which starts July 1.</LD>
<LD>   Two-thirds of the 163-member House and the 34-member Senate must
approve the request for it to take effect.</LD>
<TE>   "The rainy day is here, and I call upon members of the General
Assembly to support my recommendations to help Missouri's vulnerable
citizens," Holden said.</TE>

<HD>Left-Handers Are Found to Have Different Brains</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT LEE HOTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>People who grow up left-handed have a different, more flexible
brain structure than those born to take life by the right hand, say UCLA
researchers who use twins to study heredity.</LD>
<LD>   The reason is that right-handers have genes that force their brains
into a slightly more one-sided structure, according to their research
published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Left-handers appear to be missing those genes.</LD>
<LD>   "There really is a difference in brains that results in a more
symmetric brain in left-handers, where the two sides are more equal,"
said UCLA neurogeneticist Dr. Daniel Geschwind, who led the research
team. "There is more flexibility, and that is under genetic control."</LD>
<TE>   That hereditary difference between right-handers and left-handers also
appears to affect how the brain changes in size throughout a lifetime,
the researchers found.</TE>
<TE>   In the effort to understand how the brain shapes the mind, researchers
have been striving to document the way genes and environment affect
intelligence and mental abilities. The human insistence on preferring one
hand over the other poses a particularly nagging question that touches on
both anatomy and behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "There is clearly something fundamental here we need to comprehend if
we are to understand what makes us uniquely human," Geschwind said.</TE>
<TE>   Of all the primates, only humans display such a strong predisposition
to right-handedness. Right-handers make up about 90% of the population.
The left and right halves of the brain are different in both their
anatomy and their functions, related in part to hand preference.</TE>
<TE>   But until now, no one could document the connection.</TE>
<TE>   The UCLA study is the strongest evidence yet that heredity shapes the
brains of left-handed and right-handed people differently, Dartmouth
neuroscientist Michael Gazzaniga said.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only does this study tell us something about the genetic and
environmental influences on brain development during youth, it may tell
us something about those influences on aging," said Dr. Mark Jude Tramo,
a neuroscientist and neurologist at Harvard University Medical School.
"It is very significant and very important."</TE>
<TE>   To study brain size and structure, the UCLA researchers used a
brain-scanning technique called functional magnetic resonance to compare
brains in 72 pairs of identical twins, all of them male World War II
veterans ages 75 to 85.</TE>
<TE>   Identical twins--who share the same genes--offer a unique lens through
which to study the relative effects of heredity on human nature.</TE>
<TE>   Right- and left-handedness is partially determined by genetics. If a
person inherits the gene for right-handedness, that person will be
right-handed. People who do not carry that gene, however, can be either
left- or right-handed. There is no specific gene for left-handedness.</TE>
<TE>   Right-handers typically have a larger left brain hemisphere, where
their language abilities are concentrated. Conversely, left-handers have
more balanced brains, with both sides relatively symmetrical. The
language abilities of left-handers more often are concentrated on the
right side.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, this study shows us that brain structure is highly
influenced by genetics, even later in life," Geschwind said. "This
implies that aging-related changes to the brain also possess a strong
genetic basis. That is kind of wild."</TE>

<HD>Army Promotion Policy Ruled Unconstitutional</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A federal judge ruled Monday that the Army's equal opportunity
promotion process is unconstitutional and allowed a retired lieutenant
colonel to continue with his lawsuit that contends the policy denied him
advancement.</LD>
<LD>   Raymond Saunders served in the Army from 1974 until his retirement in
1997. He was twice denied promotions to full colonel.</LD>
<LD>   Such promotions are handled by a selection board, which recommends the
top candidates for promotion each year to the Army secretary. The board
is guided in its decisions by instructions that include equal opportunity
goals.</LD>
<TE>   For instance, the board, after compiling a list of top candidates,
must determine whether their promotion would result in comparable
advancement rates for all races. If not, the board is to raise the
rankings of lower-ranked minority officers if past discrimination is
found in their files.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, the board recommended its top applicants with no adjustments.
In 1997, when Saunders applied a second time, the board made one
adjustment in the list for a female applicant.</TE>
<TE>   In his suit filed in 1999 against the Army, Saunders claimed that, as
a white man, the equal opportunity policies barred him from advancement.
He claimed that race and sex targets unconstitutionally guide both the
initial rankings of top candidates by the board and the subsequent review
of the list.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth agreed the policies created
racial and gender classifications that resulted in preferential treatment
of minority and female candidates, during both phases of the board
process.</TE>
<TE>   Though Army lawyers argued that the racial classifications were
necessary to correct discrimination, Lamberth disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "The Constitution prohibits the Army from using its policy view to
encourage special treatment for minorities and females," Lamberth said.</TE>
<TE>   The Army argued that Saunders had not suffered because the board made
no adjustments in 1996, and he would not have been promoted anyway in
1997. Lamberth denied the Army's request to dismiss the case, saying its
evidence was inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   The judge also denied Saunders' request for an immediate decision on
the Army's liability, saying Saunders still must prove he was
specifically harmed.</TE>

<HD>Historian Goodwin Withdraws From Judging Pulitzer Prizes</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, who recently admitted copying
passages from other works in one of her best-selling books, has withdrawn
from judging the Pulitzer Prizes next month.</LD>
<LD>   Pulitzer board administrator Seymour Topping said Monday that Goodwin
"decided not to participate" when the board meets April 4 and 5 to choose
the 21 prizes for books, drama, music and journalism work done last year.</LD>
<LD>   In a March 3 letter to board Chairman John S. Carroll, the historian
said, "[B]ecause I am so distracted by the media focus on my work, I do
not feel capable of giving the considerable time needed to make the
proper judgments."</LD>
<TE>   The Pulitzers, journalism's highest honor, are awarded by Columbia
University on the recommendation of the 18-member board, which considers
nominations from Pulitzer juries.</TE>
<TE>   Topping said it was the first time any board member had withdrawn
under such circumstances, and no replacement will be named.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll, editor of the Los Angeles Times, said the board would "do
whatever was necessary to maintain the highest standard of integrity for
the Pulitzer Prize process."</TE>
<TE>   Goodwin's withdrawal, he said, would "allow this year's judging to
proceed without distraction."</TE>

<HD>Antimissile Test Report Faulted</HD>
<DH>Military: GAO says the defense contractors' assessment of a 1997
flight was upbeat, despite the failure of a key component.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A team of defense contractors described a 1997 test of a key
missile defense component as "excellent" and a "success," even though the
results indicated that the component had a variety of performance
problems, congressional investigators reported Monday.</LD>
<LD>   A General Accounting Office report said that officials from Boeing and
TRW offered the upbeat assessment despite a flight test showing that
their prototype antimissile "kill vehicle" had trouble finding its
intended targets in space and couldn't distinguish a mock warhead from
decoys. The component also had problems with cooling, noise and
calibration, the report said.</LD>
<LD>   The report comes amid debate over whether the complex and costly
antimissile system proposed by the Bush administration can be made to
work. In January, the Congressional Budget Office put the ultimate cost
of the program at between $23 billion and $68 billion or more, depending
on the design. Critics of the missile defense program contended Monday
that the GAO study should raise further questions about the program's
viability.</LD>
<TE>   But the Pentagon and the defense contractors said the report was
irrelevant because the Defense Department has since selected a different
design for the system.</TE>
<TE>   The June 1997 flight test became the subject of a series of official
inquiries after a fired TRW engineer, Nira Schwartz of Torrance, sued the
company. Her lawsuit included allegations that the company had faked work
on the project to promote its product.</TE>
<TE>   In its report, the GAO found no fraud and said that, taken together,
the contractors' reports to the Pentagon did convey the test results and
the system's limitations. But it faulted the contractors' use of
imprecise favorable language, saying that the use of subjective terms
"increase the likelihood that test results would be interpreted in
different ways, and might even be misunderstood."</TE>
<TE>   The kill vehicle is lofted into space atop an interceptor missile,
where it is supposed to rely on a suite of sophisticated sensors to
locate and destroy an incoming warhead.</TE>
<TE>   In a joint effort, Boeing made the kill vehicle and sensor, while TRW
wrote the computer programs designed to enable the system to
differentiate the warhead from other objects. The Pentagon rejected the
Boeing-TRW prototype in 1998 in favor of a competing model by Raytheon.</TE>
<TE>   Air Force Lt. Col. Rick Lehner, a spokesman for the missile defense
program, said the GAO's findings had no bearing on the antimissile effort
since the component "hasn't been part of this program for more than four
years." He said the TRW-Boeing component differed from the component now
in use in several ways, including the sensors, the discrimination system
and the mathematical logic.</TE>
<TE>   Lehner said that despite the TRW-Boeing kill vehicle's problems, it
did demonstrate that it had the fundamental capabilities required. Since
it was the first flight test of the antimissile system, "you wouldn't
expect it all to be 100%. But it was on the right track."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, TRW said the GAO report found that the company had
"acted properly" and had "neither withheld or manipulated key data."</TE>
<TE>   The GAO found that in test reports presented in August 1997, the
contractors cited only a few problems and called the sensor's overall
performance "excellent."</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials told GAO investigators that the contractors also
reported orally to them at the time that there were more problems in
performance. But there was no written evidence of such disclosures, the
GAO found.</TE>
<TE>   Later, in December 1997, after Schwartz had modified her lawsuit to
include fraud allegations, Boeing and TRW made further disclosures.
According to the report, they gave details of the sensor's high-false
alarm rate, the shortcomings of the discrimination software and other
problems.</TE>
<TE>   The companies disclosed additional information on the system's
weaknesses in a report in April 1998. All these reports together were
enough to fully brief the Pentagon on the kill vehicle's capabilities,
the GAO said.</TE>
<TE>   John Isaacs, president of Council for a Livable World, an arms control
advocacy group, said that the report raises "further questions about
whether missile defense can work effectively and consistently in
realistic test conditions."</TE>
<TE>   "This is a more complex task than any other weapons program we've ever
devised, and it has to be more effective," he said.</TE>

<HD>Malpractice Rates Stymie Nevada Insurance Chief</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CARSON CITY, Nev.
</DL>
<LD>Nevada's insurance commissioner, urged by doctors to help hold down
soaring medical malpractice insurance rates, said Monday she can't force
insurers to operate at a loss.</LD>
<LD>   "If insurance companies show that their rates are justified by cold,
hard data, I must approve them," Alice Molasky-Arman said during a
hearing on the malpractice insurance crisis.</LD>
<LD>   "Our laws require that rates not be excessive," she added. "But they
must be adequate. I can't force insurers to do business here at a loss. I
can't suppress rates."</LD>
<TE>   The insurance commissioner noted that state legislators tried at one
point to suppress auto insurance rates, but the law was later struck down
as unconstitutional by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   Short-term alternatives to reduced rates, according to the state
insurance division, include forming a joint underwriting association with
the state, setting up a doctors' mutual insurance company, or appealing
to existing companies to prepare new plans.</TE>
<TE>   Long-term solutions could include lobbying the state Legislature for
tort reform similar to California's $250,000 cap on jury awards for pain
and suffering, health officials and insurance company officials have
said.</TE>
<TE>   Before she can enact emergency insurance procedures to maintain
coverage for all medical personnel, state law required Molasky-Arman to
conduct Monday's public hearing to determine the availability of
essential insurance coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Witness after witness testified that skyrocketing malpractice
rates--with some annual policies jumping from $40,000 to $250,000 or
more--are prompting some doctors to retire early, double their patient
load, cut services or quit.</TE>
<TE>   The crisis is especially bad in southern Nevada, where the only
emergency center plans to stop operating around the clock next month and
could shut down entirely in June if rates are not lowered, Molasky-Arman
was told.</TE>
<TE>   The Nevada Trial Lawyers Assn. argued there's no such thing as a
frivolous malpractice lawsuit because, under state law, every case must
be reviewed by a doctor and deemed to be probable malpractice before it
can be filed.</TE>
<TE>   The NTLA also said insurance companies are raising rates to compensate
for having lost money on investments and for insuring bad doctors in the
past. In the case of the biggest insurer in Nevada, St. Paul Cos., the
trial lawyers said it lost $108 million in Enron investments.</TE>

<HD>Bush Takes Quick Party-Policy Trip</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn.
</DL>
<LD>Mixing the politics of education with the more conventional
political activity of fund-raising, President Bush promoted teacher
training, and then helped Republicans collect $2 million Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Bush spent roughly four hours in the air on a round-trip journey to
stay barely six hours in Minnesota, adhering to his recent pattern: one
or two trips a week. He makes appearances in politically important
congressional districts and states, while trying to focus public
attention on a policy message that could help Republican candidates.</LD>
<LD>   The president promoted his education policies at the 3,300-student
Eden Prairie High School in suburban Minneapolis, spotlighting his
efforts to upgrade the quality of teachers and improve conditions for
them in classrooms.</LD>
<TE>   He told teenagers in a packed gymnasium that they may have already
forgotten what an isosceles triangle is, and they may be unable to recall
the workings of photosynthesis. But he said that they have learned to
work hard--and for that they can thank their teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Later, his venue was a hotel ballroom for a fund-raising dinner to
benefit the state GOP and the campaign of Norm Coleman, the former mayor
of St. Paul and the Republican candidate seeking to unseat Democratic
Sen. Paul Wellstone. Both parties expect it to be one of the nation's
tightest races in a year when every contest is crucial to control of the
narrowly divided Senate.</TE>
<TE>   The day offered a glimpse of the president pushing ahead with his
domestic and political agenda, even as U.S. forces were engaged in some
of the most difficult ground combat of the war in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   He stressed his administration's unswerving commitment to the war on
terrorism. "So long as our country is under threat, this great nation
will hunt down those who want to harm innocent Americans," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Education is a topic the White House believes resonates with voters,
but Bush's political advisors are concerned he has not gotten more credit
for enactment of a sweeping school reform bill in December. The
legislation was one of his top domestic priorities.</TE>
<TE>   A poll for Fox News last week found that 38% of the respondents felt
Democrats would do a better job on education, compared with 36% favoring
the Republicans, a finding said to be similar to internal White House
surveys.</TE>
<TE>   In his speech at Eden Prairie High, Bush drew attention to the 35%
increase he is seeking, to nearly $3 billion, for programs designed to
better prepare teachers for the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   His program is built around a series of measures that are intended to,
among other things, encourage professionals from other fields to become
teachers, improve classroom conditions, raise the requirements for
teachers before they are assigned classes--in particular, demanding
higher scores in tests of their knowledge of subject areas they are
teaching--and give them greater authority to enforce discipline.</TE>
<TE>   "Many teachers are wary of imposing discipline, because they might be
sued," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   He cited legal protections against such suits in the legislation he
signed, and said, "we are taking frivolous lawsuits out of the learning
process."</TE>

<HD>Nuclear Fusion Claim Leaves Scientists Cold</HD>
<DH>Research: Oak Ridge team says it created the reaction inside tiny
bubbles. But other experts could not verify the results.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A claim by a team of engineers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory
that they have achieved nuclear fusion inside tiny bubbles has been met
with a wave of skepticism and criticism of the scientific journal that
released the results Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The team says it has created a form of nuclear fusion by zapping tiny
bubbles of acetone with intense sound waves, causing the bubbles to
expand massively and then implode. The imploding bubbles briefly created
temperatures hotter than the surface of the sun, enough to cause hydrogen
atoms to fuse together into atoms of helium, the researchers contend.</LD>
<LD>   Nuclear fusion, the reaction that fuels the sun and the hydrogen bomb,
releases massive amounts of energy. Harnessing that power--and creating
it in a laboratory using cheap raw materials--is the goal of many
engineers and physicists who say fusion might one day provide a clean and
almost limitless source of energy.</LD>
<TE>Memories of 'Cold Fusion' Shape Response</TE>
<TE>   But claims that scientists have achieved fusion labor under a cloud of
suspicion. In 1989, two scientists at the University of Utah said they
had found a way to extract energy from room-temperature water--cold
fusion. Their claim was quickly disproved after a monthlong frenzy of
news conferences, wild claims and sudden retractions. The episode is one
Caltech physicist David Goodstein now calls "science gone berserk."</TE>
<TE>   The idea that energy can be extracted from bubbles is not
controversial by itself. In the 1930s, German scientists discovered that
bubbles pummeled by sound waves would implode and emit energy in the form
of flashes of light. The phenomenon, called sonoluminescence, has
intrigued physicists ever since; a full explanation of the phenomenon
remains elusive.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists at the University of Washington and at UCLA have extended
the finding recently, pushing single bubbles to emit light with each
pulse of sound and concentrating the amount of energy within tiny bubbles
by trillions of times so they build up remarkably high pressures and
temperatures.</TE>
<TE>   "When the bubble is collapsing, the temperature at the surface is much
hotter than the surface of the sun," said Seth J. Putterman, a physicist
at UCLA who has studied sonoluminescence for two decades. "Because the
inside of the bubble can get even hotter, people have thought this could
be an ideal candidate to see if there is fusion inside."</TE>
<TE>   But the notion that the energy involved could be enough to create
fusion is controversial. The claim comes in a report to be published in
the journal Science this Friday. The team, led by Rusi Pusi Taleyarkhan
of the Oak Ridge, Tenn., lab, used a nuclear accelerator to hurl a stream
of neutrons at a flask of acetone. Regular hydrogen atoms in the acetone
had been replaced by deuterium atoms, which are easier to fuse than
hydrogen.</TE>
<TE>   The neutrons created bubbles about the size of the period at the end
of this sentence. The sound waves caused the bubbles to expand hundreds
of time in volume until they imploded into flashes of light and released
their energy.</TE>
<TE>   The scientists say they detected two signatures of fusion after the
bubbles exploded: tritium, a radioactive element that is a product of
deuterium fusion, and a type of neutron emissions typical of fusion
reactions.</TE>
<TE>   But experts in the field, including Putterman and top officials at the
laboratory that conducted the work, have yet to be convinced.</TE>
<TE>   The finding is so controversial that Lee Riedinger, Oak Ridge's
director for science and technology, asked two other scientists there to
verify the experiment.</TE>
<TE>   They could not. In a summary released Monday, nuclear physicists Dan
Shapira and Mike Saltmarsh said they could not detect the emission of
neutrons that would have come from a deuterium fusion reaction. The two
used a larger detector and more sophisticated data analysis than the
original team had employed. The neutrons detected in the original
experiment, they suggest, may have come from background levels of
neutrons, which are omnipresent and extremely difficult to remove from
measurements.</TE>
<TE>   The original authors remain undaunted. They say that Shapira and
Saltmarsh overestimated the efficiency of their detectors and actually
did detect the signature neutrons without realizing it.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether he believed the results were true and whether they were
a breakthrough, Riedinger said he simply did not know.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel we need another set of measurements," Riedinger said.</TE>
<TE>Journal Is Accused of Overplaying Story</TE>
<TE>   A number of physicists, even as they praised the idea and execution of
the bubble experiment, said that it was premature for the article to be
published and that the extraordinary claim requires more rigorous
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "They're claiming something very implausible. This would be a
revolutionary, major discovery, a bridge between the mechanical and the
nuclear," said Larry Crum, a physicist at the Applied Physics Lab at the
University of Washington. Crum was the first, along with his former
student Felipe Gaitan, to create sonoluminescence in a single bubble.</TE>
<TE>   Many physicists, including Robert Park of the University of Maryland,
took issue with how the article was treated by the editors of Science.
The article was chosen for publication, used as the cover article and
accompanied by news releases and "a lot of hoopla," Park said, even
though several distinguished physicists, including Crum, advised against
publication without additional improvements to the experiment.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason for concern are the parallels between this and the
cold-fusion episode 13 years ago," said Park, a legendary debunker of bad
science and the author of a book titled "Voodoo Science."</TE>
