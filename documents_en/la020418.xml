<HD>When Next Priests Are Accused, Remember Salem</HD>

<LD>In a six-month period in 1692, religion-fired mass hysteria resulted
in 19 women being hanged in the Massachusetts Bay Colony town of
Salem because a lot of little girls, writhing in the spotlight,
accused them of being "possessed."</LD>
<LD>   When sanity returned to the colony, 150 others awaiting trial were
freed and the 19 declared innocent of witchcraft. But they remained,
nonetheless, dead.</LD>
<LD>   It was a classic case of the kind of mindless fear that too often
results in death or character assassination. In Salem, it was death.
In the Commie-hunting McCarthy era less than 300 years later, it was
character assassination.</LD>
<TE>   I mention these dark moments in American history only to wonder
aloud about the growing number of adults who are coming forward with
accusations of pedophilia against members of the Catholic clergy.</TE>
<TE>   It occurred, they say, when they were children, and only now do
they have the courage to point to their abusers. The idea of trusted
members of God's crew sexually violating anyone is so repugnant that
it threatens to create a hysteria of its own.</TE>
<TE>   I wonder, in view of the tempo of recriminations, if a word of
caution isn't required here. Accusations can cause deep pain even if
they're later determined to be false. Consider, for instance, the
case of Thomas Brandlin, an ordained Catholic deacon who spent 11
years trying to get his life back after being called a child molester
by an accuser he was never allowed to face.</TE>
<TE>   There were no mass revelations of pedophilia going on in 1986 when
Brandlin was accused. He was working at a Catholic home for disabled
students in Santa Barbara when the human resources director called
him into her office one morning. She told him he'd been accused of
molesting a male resident and, without further explanation, suspended
him.</TE>
<TE>   "I was shocked," Brandlin said as we sat together in his
seventh-floor Westside office. "Then I was frightened. Then I was
angry. After 18 years, I was being shoved out the door without ever
being told who had accused me or why."</TE>
<TE>   He's a pleasant, round-faced man of 53 who could be anyone's
uncle. His manner is casual and his clothing civilian, giving no
indication of his position in the church except for a small gold
cross on his collar.</TE>
<TE>   Brandlin said he forced the Santa Barbara sheriff's office to
allow him to see parts of the report on his case. He discovered that
the molestation had supposedly occurred during a specific period of
time when he was either with dozens of other residents of the home or
in New Mexico attending a Boy Scout workshop.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know where this was going," he said. He had never been
arrested or charged and could prove his innocence, but the mere
accusation had tainted him. He asked the church for help through
Archbishop William Levada, then an auxiliary bishop of the
Archdiocese of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   With Brandlin's permission, Levada informed Archbishop Roger
Mahony of their deacon's plight. Instead of helping him, Brandlin
said, Mahony suspended his powers as a deacon, even though two days
earlier "he had taken my hand in his and said, 'We're praying for you
and want to help you in any way we can.'"</TE>
<TE>   Outraged, Brandlin demanded his ministry back but was told it
wouldn't be restored until he'd been completely cleared. On April 15,
1987, he asked for and received a notice of "factual innocence" from
the Santa Barbara County district attorney's office, without ever
having been charged with a crime.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, Brandlin said, he again confronted Mahony, and
finally his ability to function as a deacon was restored, but he was
prohibited from working with children. Again burdened by suspicion
and wearied by an effort that had already consumed two years,
Brandlin decided to fight on.</TE>
<TE>   The anger still comes through as he discusses the ordeal. Clearly,
Brandlin said, it had become a grudge fight with Mahony. Reached
earlier this week, Mahony's office declined comment, claiming that it
was a "personnel matter" and therefore private.</TE>
<TE>   A psychological evaluation ordered by the diocese in '87 also
cleared him, Brandlin said, "but Mahony still wouldn't back down and
free me to work with children." His next step was to obtain the
services of a canon lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Letters went back and forth between L.A. and the Vatican, finally
bringing pressure on Mahony to lift all restrictions on Brandlin's
ministry. That was in April 1997. The entire process, Brandlin
pointed out, took "11 years, two months, six days, 23 hours and 48
minutes."</TE>
<TE>   When Mahony cleared him, Brandlin said, he immediately made him a
prison chaplain. "He thought I'd hate it," the deacon says gleefully,
"but I love it."</TE>
<TE>   He faults Mahony and the church for not allowing him immediate due
process and says he's speaking out now because others who are falsely
accused cannot.</TE>
<TE>   Count me among those horrified by anyone, priest or coach,
relative or first-grade teacher, who violates a child. But count me
also among those who fear accusations without adequate proof and the
denial of due process in pursuit of that truth.</TE>
<TE>   We've come a long way from hanging witches, but a tendency to
lynch reputations in the heat of passion proves that we still have a
long way to go.</TE>

<LD>Prague was still under Communist rule in the mid-1960s when jazz
legend Louis Armstrong and his band stopped there to give the
avant-garde locals a taste of quintessentially American music.
Reporters followed Armstrong from tours of the old city to his
smoke-filled dressing room backstage, and audiences were enchanted by
his gravelly voice, beaming smile and unparalleled trumpeting.</LD>
<LD>   The tour came back to life Tuesday night in Hollywood, replayed in
a recently restored Czech documentary for a crowd of about 300
National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences members. The grainy,
black and white film, shown at the Harmony Gold Theater on Sunset
Boulevard, was receiving its first screening since being restored by
the Grammy Foundation, a nonprofit educational arm of the Recording
Academy.</LD>
<LD>   The foundation borrowed and restored numerous vintage clips of
jazz players from archives in New Jersey, Queens, N.Y., and Stockton,
Calif., and has shared some of the footage with the academy to be
used to educate public schoolchildren.</LD>
<TE>   Also screened were newly restored clips of jazz pianists Dave
Brubeck and Bud Powell, evoking an era when smoking was ubiquitous.</TE>
<TE>   Watching a Dave Brubeck Quartet performance for an Australian TV
program from the 1960s, Tuesday's crowd laughed when the show's
well-coiffed host appeared in an easy chair, smoking a cigarette
throughout the 30-minute program, and when Brubeck's band performed
the jingle of the show's sponsor, Craven Filter cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   After the screening, as the crowd dispersed, Prague native Rudy
Lukes found Armstrong's drummer, Danny Barcelona, in the audience.
Lukes reminisced about the night Armstrong performed in Prague. "It
was just charged!" said Lukes, who was 17 when he attended the show.
"It was avant-garde! There were very few Western performers who came
to Eastern Europe."</TE>
<TE>   For Barcelona, warm memories of that tour linger through the
decades. His most vivid remembrance of the trip? "I remember the
beer," he said. "They had very good beer there."</TE>
<TE>   Brooklyn in His Heart</TE>
<TE>   Ronnie Marmo can't leave Brooklyn behind. The New York-born actor
came to Los Angeles three years ago. In the beginning, he would
resist taking the jobs that seemed easiest for him to get: the
stereotypical mobster parts that casting directors seemed to
associate with an Italian American from Brooklyn. "I'd comb my hair
forward, do the Matthew Perry thing," Marmo jokes about his early
auditions. But to no avail. "Until you're Bobby D. [Robert De Niro],
you're an Italian boy."</TE>
<TE>   With time, Marmo embraced his inner wise guy. In the Scott Kalvert
movie "Deuces Wild," to be released May 3, Marmo appears with Stephen
Dorff and Matt Dillon as Moof, a knife-wielding Brooklyn gang member.
He describes the movie as "'West Side Story' without the music." In
"Irish Eyes," a movie to be released later this year, he stars
opposite Daniel Baldwin as Jimmy the Bomb--as the name suggests, a
tough guy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great time to be Italian American in this
business--'Sopranos' really opened the door," he says, before
modifying his answer a little. "It's a curse, and it's amazing
because it separates you from [everybody else]."</TE>
<TE>   Marmo steps away from stereotypes at 68 Cent Crew, a theater
company he co-founded and where he acts as creative director. The
company, named for the amount of money Marmo had in his pocket the
day he was cast as Moof, performs at the Space Theatre in Hollywood.
His next role there: Leo Frank, a man wrongly accused of rape and
murder.</TE>
<TE>   Marmo has a minimalist approach to acting: Find your mark, read
your lines. "Some people have to go in a corner to pray and chant
before an audition. That's not me," he says. "I come from the old
school. Jimmy Cagney, Bogart--these are my heroes."</TE>
<TE>   Although he says he's excited about Hollywood, he still gets
homesick. He will hang out at Albano's Brooklyn Pizzeria on Melrose
and "pretend I'm back home."</TE>

<LD>THE STONE BOUDOIR</LD>
<LD>   Travels Through the</LD>
<LD>   Hidden Villages of Sicily</LD>
<TE>   By Theresa Maggio</TE>
<TE>   Perseus Publishing</TE>
<TE>   246 pages, $25.95</TE>
<TE>   There is something inherently romantic in finding yourself between
one tiny black dot and another on a well-traveled tourist map. The
pilgrim's progress in Italy has become so worn with our footsteps
that American college students traveling there often carry the
ubiquitous "Let's Go" travel guide--not for choosing destinations, as
the title suggests, but rather as a template for what, and where, to
avoid.</TE>
<TE>   American-born writer Theresa Maggio has spent the better part of
the last two decades on a Sicilian quest, looking for the tiniest of
towns on Italy's biggest island. "These are places tourists seldom
see," she writes in "The Stone Boudoir," her chronicle of those
journeys. "But they are the island's hidden treasure and the secret
spring of Sicilian endurance."</TE>
<TE>   Maggio--who last wrote about Sicily, the land of her grandparents,
in the evocative "Mattanza," a portrait of the tuna fishermen of
Favignana, an island off Sicily's coast--has sought out places
obscured from the typical tourist's vision by a sentiment that some
towns and villages were too small even to bear mention.</TE>
<TE>   Using Santa Margherita, the town from which her grandfather
emigrated to the United States, as her base of travel, Maggio travels
around Sicily with little money to spend on luxuries but with an
intense curiosity about how people live, and endure, on an island
whose rocky composition is both an obstacle and a comfort.</TE>
<TE>   All that is constant in a Sicilian's life, it seems, is the
presence of the sky, the water--and stones. Houses are fashioned from
caves; a woman saves the stone turned over in her fields to build a
patio for her house; a man makes a living assembling semiprecious
stones into a jigsaw puzzle of elaborate inlay that will fetch
thousands of dollars. When we learn that the father of one of
Maggio's friends died after his body grew a kidney stone too large to
expel, we know that it is not just medicine but the island that
failed him. Stone, after all, lasts for ages.</TE>
<TE>   Maggio herself finds comfort in the cobblestones. Describing the
town of Polizzi Generosa--"a long name for a small dot"--she writes
that the streets "were so close and intimate that I felt I'd walked
into someone's stone boudoir. Every time I put my foot down, it
rolled over the soft convex of a stone.... In the rain, the stones
shone like puffed satin pillows--uneven, imperfect, and of humans."</TE>
<TE>   Maggio is a compelling writer who can render even the simplest
moments into sheer poetry. Describing a mother feeding her 3-year-old
twins, Maggio writes: "She twirled the spaghetti on a fork and the
girls sucked in their supper strand by strand. The noodles whipped
their cheeks with red sauce and made their mother laugh--love from a
bowl, in the street, where there was a breeze and people watching."</TE>
<TE>   In moments like these, when Maggio steps aside and lets the people
she meets take over her pages, "The Stone Boudoir" is delightful. But
too often she inserts her own interpretations of events and people, a
habit that can be disruptive to the narrative. As a result, "The
Stone Boudoir" reads like a scrapbook of sorts, a chronicle of
Maggio's own belabored journey of self-discovery as we leap from one
place and event to the next.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike "Mattanza," "The Stone Boudoir" seems to lack a center, a
place around which all anecdotes and experiences fall, and when
Maggio writes that she is seeking out "small-town traditions that
give dignity to life," one wishes that she would just describe the
traditions and let the reader decide whether they do, indeed, give
dignity to life.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the quest for undiscovered country at the heart of
"The Stone Boudoir" is at odds with the conclusions it leads us to
along the way: The people of Sicily were never really hidden from
view. Perhaps we just weren't looking hard enough.</TE>

<DH>Thomas Wilfred's dancing lights continue to dazzle
astronomer Eugene Epstein, decades after he discovered such works in
a museum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN FREUDENHEIM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forty-two years ago, a young astronomy student took a stroll through
New York's Museum of Modern Art that changed his life. Then a
graduate student at Harvard, Eugene Epstein had been to New York a
few times before, and when he walked into the museum that day, he
certainly wasn't expecting to be so thoroughly seduced by a single
work of art.</LD>
<LD>   "Wow," is the word Epstein remembers saying as he discovered a
secluded alcove where a cabinet displayed a light show of
slow-moving, startlingly beautiful colors. "Wow" is the word the
now-retired 67-year-old radio astronomer repeats often when he talks
about Thomas Wilfred's art, of which he has become perhaps the
world's most avid collector.</LD>
<LD>   On that day in 1960, utterly struck, Epstein stood in front of
"Vertical Sequence II, Opus 136," 1941, for about two hours. Then he
raced to the museum's information desk to find out who Wilfred was.</LD>
<TE>   Call it love, call it fate, but what Epstein experienced that day
is the kind of spark that occurs when a true collector meets
something that matches his or her need for passion. Be it for stamps,
vintage cars or artworks, when that fire is lighted, it takes its own
form, often becoming what to anyone else would seem pure obsession
but to the collector is just part of what gives meaning to life. For
Epstein, the commitment to a single artist's work has been
unrelenting.</TE>
<TE>   The Danish-born musician-turned-artist who had developed elaborate
theories of making silent music with light was a respected, if
somewhat forgotten, artist when Epstein came upon his work. Over the
years, the artist had experienced his share of cultist popularity,
primarily by presenting his work at theaters throughout the
world--from Hollywood High School's auditorium (in 1924) to Carnegie
Hall. His work also had been collected by the likes of Clare Boothe
Luce and admired by the legendary conductor Leopold Stokowski. But
Wilfred was always a bit isolated by the uniqueness of his ideas.</TE>
<TE>   Wilfred, then 71 and living in suburban New York, was responsive
to Epstein when the young man wrote asking to buy a work, but the
prices were too high for a student's budget. Five years later, by
which time the young astronomer was living in L.A., employed and
financially able to buy, Wilfred agreed to sell him a piece and to
meet him. It took a few months to deliver, and in the process the two
corresponded. By the time Wilfred died, in 1968, they had seen each
other twice and had numerous telephone conversations.</TE>
<TE>   Little did Wilfred know that Epstein would be the one to carry his
flame into the next century. Wilfred is hardly known at all today,
but if the artist seems a thing of the past to most people, you
wouldn't know it from talking to Epstein.</TE>
<TE>   On the lower floor of the three-story Modernist Westside home
designed by architect Jim Harlan that Epstein shares with his wife,
Carol, an entire gallery-like wall is devoted to Wilfred's work. In
this quiet, meditative retreat, Epstein spills out stories he has
learned of Wilfred's life in a torrent of anecdotes and facts, his
enthusiasm for the work and his curiosity about the man unabated by
the passage of time.</TE>
<TE>   In a world preoccupied by passing fancies, Epstein's passion for
Wilfred is hard even for him to explain; he is drawn to the images
and the slow pace of the changing imagery. "Imagine an artist having
on her palette the shapes, forms, colors, and intensity range seen in
some of the spectacular Hubble Space Telescope images of clouds of
interstellar dust and gas. The artist creates a slow, peaceful,
sublimely beautiful, almost-imperceptibly evolving sequence of such
images that goes on for hours."</TE>
<TE>   Epstein owns nine works by the artist; each of which he lovingly
tracked down and whose mechanical parts he often had to restore
himself, sometimes with substantial effort. Wide-ranging in their
effects, the mechanisms are encased in cabinets and hidden from view
and are all quite simple: Each one consists of one or more
lightbulbs, a handcrafted color wheel and a series of carefully
shaped moving reflectors that sculpt the continuously evolving
colored emissions.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Wilfred's works, which he dubbed "Lumia," were not so
beautiful, so strangely ethereal in their rotation of colors and
shapes, Epstein's enthusiasm would be hard to resist. As he shows a
visitor each piece, using a rudimentary Radio Shack remote control to
operate the machinery, he stops regularly to express his awe at what
is unfolding in light projections on ground-glass screens.</TE>
<TE>   Since the ever-rotating imagery of each work can take weeks to go
through a full cycle, revelations come with regularity as one watches
the work. Each piece is different in palette and form. They can look
roughly like flickering fire, the light show of the aurora borealis
or perhaps what one might imagine an abstract, Color Field painting
would look like if the colors were in constant fluctuating motion.
"Eugene's devotion to maintaining the pristine quality of the
mechanism and presentation of Wilfred's work is to be congratulated,"
says Stephanie Barron, vice president for education and public
programs and senior curator of Modern and contemporary art at the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art. "Artists are really lucky to have
someone like that."</TE>
<TE>   The match of Wilfred and Epstein would seem to be a perfect
pairing of collector and material, with no suggestion of being
market-driven. Even in the art world, the work is hardly known--the
Museum of Modern Art's three pieces have been out of sight and in
storage since the mid-1980s, and other works by Wilfred are rarely
seen. Epstein has occasionally lent works to the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art, the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C., and to
museums in Europe. He says his ambition is to renew the art world's
interest in the work and to find a permanent home for his collection
to land in some day.</TE>
<TE>   What it is in the work that has so deeply and lastingly impressed
Epstein might seem to be its ethereal astronomical qualities--the
collector spent his career as a radio astronomer and research
scientist at Aerospace Corp. in El Segundo.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Epstein says his devotion stems only from the quality of
Wilfred's work: "To me it was a just purely aesthetic, gut response
to abstract beauty," he insists. This in spite of the fact that
Wilfred wrote an essay in 1956 titled "Musing on the Spheres," a
meditation on man's ability to envision the universe in which he
mentions radio telescopes, Epstein's primary professional tool.</TE>
<TE>   When pointed to that article, Epstein only laughs and denies
knowledge of it. "Did he really write that?" he asks. The scientist
discounts any comparisons between the clinical nature of his
scientific work and the art. "I think that my work gave me a verbal
analysis," he says, "a way to describe it to somebody. But I think
the aesthetic just reached some sensibility. I like it, pure and
uncomplicated, unintellectual."</TE>
<TE>   When Epstein sought out Wilfred, the artist had become reclusive
and even a bit bitter at being left outside by the mainstream art
world of Abstract Expressionism, and he was full of conspiracy
theories about why he wasn't bigger. "He was very suspicious of the
art world and the art market," Epstein remembers.</TE>
<TE>   The two met at the Modern Museum in Manhattan, and the artist gave
his fan a behind-the-artwork tour. "He felt that people didn't want
him to be well known. I have to assume that because he took me inside
the room that housed the mechanism, that he must have had confidence
that I appreciated the artwork. I regarded it as being allowed into
the inner sanctum."</TE>
<TE>   When Wilfred died, he had not yet had a retrospective
exhibition--that would come three years posthumously, in 1971, at the
Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington. But his Rube Goldberg kind of
machinery is delicate and can be very demanding. Like much video and
film art that has become a regular component of museum collections
today, Wilfred's work requires dedicated darkened rooms and asks the
viewer for long-term attention, requirements that don't make the work
easy to place in public institutions.</TE>
<TE>   Although the titles of the works often refer to spatial realms--
"Multidimensional," "Sequences in Space"--Epstein affectionately
refers to them by nicknames that he and his wife have invented:
"Broom Closet," because that's where "Multidimensional" used to
reside before it found its current placement; "Big Boy," for its
size.</TE>
<TE>   Carol Epstein, a volunteer at LACMA for 22 years, joins her
husband as he talks about the work, and it's clear that in their
retirement, tracking down works has become one of the pleasures of
travel. She's also indulged the works' taking over their
lives--before they built their current home, the pieces resided in
every nook and cranny--and she has done much of the informal naming
of the works. The Wilfred gallery wall of their home was her idea; a
simple white facade with windows for the works, it hides their
mechanisms in a utility room behind the wall.</TE>
<TE>   To the eye of a Wilfred scholar, the installation works. "I think
Wilfred would have been very pleased," says Donna Stein, the artist's
biographer who curated the Corcoran exhibition. Stein became
interested in Wilfred through her friendship with Eugene Epstein in
the 1960s. An art historian and independent curator, Stein speaks
with respect for the astronomer-collector-historian with no formal
art degrees, and marvels at the fact that in his home one can see
such a range of Wilfred's work, dating from 1930 until the artist's
death in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   "Eugene's deeply into the research. I did the first work, but he's
taken it a great deal further. He's made a point of trying to figure
out what's going on, as much as anything to see where they are and to
buy them. It is a total passion."</TE>

<LD>As empty spots open up in the garden, fill them with annual bedding
plants that will bloom in the summer. Be aware that many annuals at
nurseries are spring bloomers and will last only another month at
most.</LD>
<LD>   For reliable summer color, consider these annuals for sunny spots:
ageratum, alyssum, amaranthus, balsam, celosia, bedding dahlia,
annual dianthus, gloriosa daisy, lobelia, marigold, nierembergia,
petunia, summer phlox, portulaca, bedding salvia, verbena and zinnia.
In the shade, try bedding begonia, caladium, coleus, forget-me-not,
mimulus and impatiens.</LD>
<LD>   Spring bulbs finish up this month, but don't be too hasty to cut
them. Wait until the leaves turn brown, so the bulbs or corms can
store up the energy necessary to bloom next year. Tulips are the
exception. They won't flower next year, so dig them up and toss them
out before you can't remember where they were planted.</LD>

<LD>Roses</LD>
<LD>   Just about everybody loves roses. Maybe it's because they grow in
so many different shapes, sizes and colors. There is a reason for
this diversity. Roses have grown in many regions of the world for
thousands of years, and gardeners have combined different roses to
hybridize, or create, new ones. But these newer, modern roses also
carry special traits of their "parent" plants.</LD>
<LD>   You know how that works. Do you have the same color eyes as your
mother? Are you tall and thin or strong and husky like your father?
Are you a wiz at math or better at reading? Much of your own
appearance and strengths are traits you inherited from your parents.
The same is true of roses.</LD>
<TE>   This time of year you can see hundreds of modern roses blooming
near their ancient ancestors at Descanso Gardens. If you look
closely, you will see that many old roses have soft colors and strong
perfume. The modern roses have brighter colors, but you might have to
step closer to smell their more delicate perfume.</TE>
<TE>   If you visit Descanso on a Saturday or Sunday from April 27 to May
19, be sure to stop at the Discovery Station to smell the roses and
learn more about them. Ask for a Kid's Adventure Map that will guide
you and your family all around the gardens. For more information,
call (818) 949-4200 or visit www.descansogardens. org.</TE>

<DH>Book examines the influence of Spanish and Mexican
architecture.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY BRYANT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "California Colonial" (Schiffer Publishing Ltd., 2002),
author-photographer and Los Angeles resident Elizabeth McMillian
traces this architectural form, rooted in traditional Spanish and
Mexican architecture, from 1769 to the present, using her photographs
as well as those of Matt Gainer.</LD>
<LD>   The first two chapters of the book are historical text, and the
photos show how this indigenous California style evolved in
chronological order, followed by more explicative color photographs
of specific details that help create it. The final chapter in the
book describes the California ranch house and hacienda from 1900-2000
and follows the same format.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps the easiest way to understand the framework for what
architecture was here originally, and how it developed, is to scan
the book's contents page. For anyone who thinks California Colonial
is not complex or sophisticated, look at the chapter subheads where
such cultural style assimilations as "California's Spanish
Islamic/Gothic revival" or "California's Spanish
Baroque/Churrigueresco Revival," to name just two, are found.</LD>
<TE>   But it took a while to get to those stages. Originally people
living in Southern California built conical homes from natural
materials, such as sticks and brush, until the Spaniards arrived in
the late 1700s and introduced adobe structures. Interestingly,
sticks, barks and leather as building materials would resurface later
in the ranch house style.</TE>
<TE>   "California's style had its roots in Mexico through the Spanish
Franciscans, their Mexican universities and the 18th-century styles
that Mexico derived from Spain," McMillian writes. The first chapter
deals with the different Colonial styles, such as Spanish and
Mexican, until 1915. But the architecture even then was never purely
one thing, with influences from Victoriana, Arts and Crafts and other
forms near the turn of the 19th century. Mission Revival was
especially popular for public buildings, such as the Beverly Hills
Hotel (1910-12) by Elmer Grey, Frederick Roehrig's Green Hotel in
Pasadena (1890s) and the Mission Inn in Riverside, done in 1890-1901
by Arthur Benton.</TE>
<TE>   Using 1915 as a starting point, McMillian writes that by then a
phase of period architectural styles spread across the country
because people were traveling and were better educated. "Alongside
Tudor, Italianate and French Normandy design, Spanish style works
arose in great abundance, particularly in Southern California, where
people used it to claim their tentative lineage as a Hispanic
colony," she writes. She goes on to explain the historical
differences among the different Spanish styles, Plateresco (Spanish
Renaissance architecture, circa 1492-1556), Desornamentado (Spanish
Classical architecture, circa 1556-1650) and Churrigueresco (Spanish
Baroque architecture, circa 1650-1750). She also explains how those
styles were popular in Mexico first, and then spread to California.</TE>
<TE>   Here in Southern California, with its Mediterranean climate, the
Spanish Colonial Revival style was often preferred, with architects
looking directly to Spain for ideas. "They perpetuated the myth and
romantic fiction that California was the New Spain of North America,
after only 79 to 80 years of limited Spanish-Mexican contact,"
McMillian writes.</TE>
<TE>   The many Spanish period styles created throughout California from
1915-40 are documented in the book. Luckily, many are public
buildings that can still be visited. Two are now museums built in the
Spanish Andalusian or white-walled farmhouse style, including
Malibu's Adamson House with its Moorish elements designed in 1928 by
Stiles Clements, and Montecito's Casa del Herrero, built from
1922-25, and designed by George Washington Smith. The latter house
museum is particularly intriguing for its examples of Latino
decorative arts and landscape design with courtyards and fountains.
In Northern California, there is the spectacular Hearst Castle in San
Simeon, designed from 1919-49 by Julia Morgan, which combines many
European styles, including Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   McMillian has also created a catalog-like chapter of details and
objects that help create the California Colonial style, among them
building entrances made of carved wood, wrought iron and even gilded
metal, in the case of the Hearst estate. There are colorful, Moorish
tiles found on furniture, fountains and outdoor courtyards. Fanciful
metalwork depicts dragons, horses and flower motifs.</TE>
<TE>   The last section of the book deals with the ranch house and
hacienda. McMillian writes, "California's true multi-ethnic cultural
roots surface in the California rancho hacienda and the later
California ranch house where Native American, Anglo and immigrant
pioneer, and Spanish and Mexican influences coalesce." One strong
advocate of this style was architect Cliff May, who in his 1946 book
"Western Ranch Houses" defined the style. McMillian points to Will
Rogers' Pacific Palisades home as a good example of this type of
architecture. The house is now a museum and part of Will Roger's
State Historic Park.</TE>
<TE>   For anyone who's driven around California and wondered about this
romantic architectural style that once defined how Californians lived
to the rest of the world, "California Colonial" is a valuable
resource. Those interested in purchasing pieces to create a
California Colonial look will find an excellent resource list put
together by interior designer Bettye Young at the back of the book.</TE>
<TE>   McMillian will give a slide presentation, "Architecture under the
Stars," from 6:30 to 9:30 p.m. May 7, at Casa del Herrero in
Montecito. The cost is $35 for nonmembers; $25 for members. Limited
seating. Call (805) 969-1554. For more information,

<LD>"It's a pleasure thing," said Beth Larsen, explaining why 500
teachers from all parts of the 700 square miles that constitute the
Los Angeles Unified School District had sacrificed last Saturday to
assemble at 8 a.m. in an auditorium at Dorsey High School in Los
Angeles. The teachers were not only giving their own time, she said,
but their own money--$25 each--to learn how to set up school gardens.</LD>
<LD>   Teachers have come out in such numbers for the past four years.
Their curiosity about school gardens is quickly making digging and
planting the most popular new teaching tools in the state. There are
already 200 school gardens in the 915 LAUSD schools and 3,000 in
California's 8,761 public schools.</LD>
<LD>   On the face of it, the teachers have support from their superiors.
Los Angeles Board of Education member Genethia Hudley-Hayes has
called gardening "one of the best programs in the LAUSD." State
Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin has said
gardening can "be the most powerful learning tool going" because it
can draw parents, teachers and children together to learn, and
engender a sense of accomplishment. She is so enthusiastic about the
program that she has made it a state goal to have a garden in every
school.</LD>
<TE>   But this level endorsement has not translated into dollars, or
anything close to an official program. Gardening is not on the core
curriculum. You can't test kids on how to improve soil, nurture a
seedling or set up a market garden in a school funding drive. So to
get the gardens going, teachers must take their own time, then seek
out a variety of constantly changing grants.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the money's coming from the nutrition quarter. Larsen
works for something called "the Nutrition Network," a new name for
the LAUSD school garden program, given because a nutrition grant from
the USDA now outstrips the 1994 National Science Foundation grant
that originally funded the program.</TE>
<TE>   Originally, the Los Angeles gardens concentrated on science,
botany and ecology. But the recent flush of federal food stamp money
has brought a new mission statement. Now, a garden's main function is
to teach kids the health virtues of eating fresh food by growing
tasty samples in schoolyards.</TE>
<TE>   It works, too, said Jennifer Rees, a coordinator from the UC
system's garden outreach program, Common Ground. "When kids grow
their own vegetables they get really excited about eating them.
They'll eat things they would never dream of eating otherwise.
They'll even eat rutabaga."</TE>
<TE>   Hayes, who was the star speaker on Saturday, celebrates the
nutrition angle. "To me the possibilities are limitless," she said.
"If every school had a garden, and they sold the vegetables, we
wouldn't need soda machines in the schools."</TE>
<TE>   But she objects to the garden program being boxed in by the
nutrition label for lack of more serious grant support from the
school board and the state's department of education. "We talk about
how wonderful it is, but we are not prepared to support it fiscally,"
she said. "This is not a peripheral program. It gets at the core
mission of public education," which she maintains should include
learning about "life skills."</TE>
<TE>   Hayes argued that gardening is not only fun, it involves math to
measure a plot, chemistry to judge soil acidity, botany to propagate
seedings, history to understand the concept of "heirloom" tomatoes.</TE>
<TE>   "When you think about life skills offered by a course in
gardening," she said, "this is the most lifesaving life skill we can
teach to 750,000 children."</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of workshops followed her speech, including sessions on
composting, landscaping with indigenous plants eaten by Native
Americans and rehabilitating the reputation of eggplant with kids.
But for many teachers, the goal in attending was what attracts most
first-time gardeners. "I want to beautify the campus," said Beverly
Glass, a school coordinator from Purche Avenue Elementary School in
Gardena.</TE>
<TE>   For others, the passion is wildlife and ecology. Boyle Heights
Elementary School teacher Brandyn Scully led a workshop on how to
teach bird-watching. On hand to support the teachers were dozens of
exhibitors, from UC Davis, the Huntington Library and Botanical
Gardens, the Los Angeles Zoo, Starbucks and Thomas Bros. Maps.</TE>
<TE>   The situation is much the same up and down the state. In
neighboring Ventura County, a collaboration between a charity called
the Hansen Trust and the University of California trains 60 teachers
a year to set up school gardens. Their work has made Ventura a leader
in school gardens, where children from kindergarten through high
school learn gardening. But program administrator Sheri Klittich said
their program, too, is fighting for support from the system so it
does not rely so heavily on the goodwill of teachers. "We're trying
to see how we can strengthen this program on its own merits," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the "big idea" in public education is down to the
state's teachers. Here in Los Angeles, whether the teacher wants to
use it to teach science, math or history, whether it's bird-watching
or beautifying that catches a teacher's fancy, the garden will be
done on their own time, and, on paper, it will all be an offshoot of
nutrition.</TE>

<LD>As Max slowly approached the school gate, he spotted Ray waiting for
him.</LD>
<LD>   "Want to play handball, Max?" asked Ray with a smirk.</LD>
<LD>   "OK," said Max, walking into the schoolyard.</LD>
<TE>   "Did you bring your dollar?" Ray asked, waving his dollar bill in
the air.</TE>
<TE>   "It's in my pocket," said Max, stuffing his hand in his pocket to
show Ray his money.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, no!" Max said. "I forgot my money. I must have left it on my
dresser at home."</TE>
<TE>   "You're gonna have to pay me double, Max," Ray said.</TE>
<TE>   Max began thinking that maybe he didn't want to play handball at
all.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Max!" yelled Ruben, whizzing past the gate. "Let's play
before the first bell rings. I'll get the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Max didn't have a chance to respond. Before he knew it, Ruben had
passed him the ball and took off running.</TE>
<TE>   Max looked at Ray. Ray was smirking again.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's go!" Max said with gusto. Max flew toward the court and
shot the ball through Ruben's legs. It took one bounce, hit the wall
low, arched over Max's head and landed right near Ray.</TE>
<TE>   "I got it!" yelled Ruben, charging in front of the ball and
smacking it with his hand.</TE>
<TE>   Ray positioned himself between the wall and Max, ready for the
next wallop. Max threw his body in a twist toward the ball. His feet
spun in circles as he reached with his hand and whacked the ball
high. Then Max heard the bell.</TE>
<TE>   He looked at Ray and glanced down at his right foot. His shoelace
was dangling on the ground.</TE>

<LD>Ashanti, the 21-year-old R&amp;B singer who surprised the pop world last
week when her debut album entered the sales chart at No. 1, continues
to dominate the marketplace. But the New Yorker has to share the
industry buzz this week with singer Josh Groban, whose debut album
soared dramatically, from No. 121 to No. 12.</LD>
<LD>   Ashanti's self-titled album sold 246,000 copies last week, enough
for a 20,000 lead over Celine Dion's "A New Day Has Come."</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to her hit single "Foolish" and guest roles on hits by Ja
Rule and Fat Joe, Ashanti built enough fan interest to sell nearly
503,000 copies of her album in its first week in stores.</LD>
<TE>   That's the second-highest first-week total this year, behind the
527,000 registered two weeks ago by Dion, who has just passed the
1-million sales mark.</TE>
<TE>   Groban is a 20-year-old Los Angeles singer whose style is a
throwback to an era of polished pop vocalists. His self-titled album,
produced by Grammy-winning veteran David Foster, has been on the
chart since late December, but until this week the highest it had
reached was No. 41, and it seemed to be slowly dropping.</TE>
<TE>   This week's jump was attributed by Groban's record label, Warner
Bros., to a profile of the artist on the television program "20/20"
last Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The album sold 56,000 copies last week (up from 10,000 the
previous week), giving him a total of 431,000.</TE>
<TE>   The highest entry among new releases this week is the Goo Goo
Dolls' "Gutterflowers," which sold 101,000 copies to finish fourth on
the chart.</TE>
<TE>   Two veteran artists--Neil Young and Bonnie Raitt--returned to the
chart with new releases. Young's "Are You Passionate?" finished No.
10, while Raitt's "Silver Lining" was No. 13.</TE>
<TE>   The other positions in the top 10 this week are claimed, in order,
by Vol. 9 of the "Now That's What I Call Music" compilation, Tweet,
the "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" soundtrack, "The Scorpion King"
soundtrack, Shakira and Pink.</TE>
<TE>   The best-selling single remains 'N Sync's pairing with Nelly on
"Girlfriend."</TE>

<DH>Boney James is a rarity: an instrumentalist who broke
through to big venues such as Universal Amphitheatre.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE APPLEFORD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boney James has played New York many times now, but his recent
appearance there was special: It was his first headlining gig at the
Apollo Theatre, a room where some of the greatest names of R&amp;B
launched their careers. And James somehow felt their presence.</LD>
<LD>   "It was wonderful," says the saxophonist. Favorite acts when he
was growing up included Stevie Wonder and Earth, Wind &amp; Fire. "It's
got an aura about it, and we all felt it during the show."</LD>
<LD>   His wife even took a picture of his name on the marquee. That
might seem like a humble gesture for an artist who has enjoyed three
gold records, along with a new tour that delivers him to another big
room, the Universal Amphitheatre, on Saturday. But if anything, the
funkier grooves of R&amp;B are only growing more prominent in his music.</LD>
<TE>   James' newest album, "Ride," includes such guest vocalists as Dave
Hollister and Jaheim, along with beats from Amir "?uestlove" Thompson
of the Roots, and suggests a stickier groove than the smoother sound
of his previous records.</TE>
<TE>   But R&amp;B, and music in general, might have seemed an unexpected
career choice for James, 40, who grew up in New Rochelle, N.Y.,
before moving in 1975 to "the flats of Beverly Hills" while in high
school. Though he played in bands as a hobby starting at 13, he
didn't see music as his destiny.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I was going to be a lawyer or something like that," he
says. But those plans changed when he returned home from UC Berkeley
for summer vacation and rejoined his high school friends, who were
playing in a band in a serious way.</TE>
<TE>   James played with them one night at the Improv club in West
Hollywood, and found himself changed. "I got up on stage with them,
with the lights and the crowd screaming, and I had a sort of
epiphany: Wow, this is what I love."</TE>
<TE>   Back in New Rochelle, James had studied with Yellowjackets saxman
Bob Mintzer. After transferring to UCLA, where he eventually earned a
history degree, he began directing his energy toward music, seeing
the careers of R&amp;B-flavored instrumentalists Grover Washington Jr.
and Ronnie Laws as models.</TE>
<TE>   His first band of neighborhood friends eventually broke up, and
James decided he wanted to be a sideman. In 1985 he was hired into
the first solo band of Morris Day, former leader of the Time. "I
thought I had it made," James says with a laugh. "I was making $1,500
a week. We were staying at the Ritz Carlton. I thought, 'This is it,
I'm in!' Then, of course, I came home from that tour and I had to
deliver pizzas again."</TE>
<TE>   More sideman jobs followed, playing various instruments and
singing background behind the likes of Ray Parker Jr., Randy
Crawford, Sheena Easton, the Isley Brothers and Bobby Caldwell. At
the same time, he was writing songs, aiming to have other artists
sing his material.</TE>
<TE>   But he wasn't happy, either as a writer or a player. "I really
started to get frustrated with my life at that point," James says. "I
decided I should just write songs that I like, and maybe they'll be
better and more honest and people will dig them."</TE>
<TE>   He eventually won a deal with the tiny Spindle Top Records label,
which released his debut album in 1992. Though limited distribution
kept the album out of most stores, some of his songs began to be
heard on "smooth jazz" radio stations.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just the stuff that was coming out of me, which is all I'm
ever trying to do now," he says now. "It's still a record that I'm
very fond of."</TE>
<TE>   By the time he began recording his second album for the label,
Warner Bros. Records expressed interest, and in 1993 the label
released "Backbone," which ultimately sold 100,000 copies.</TE>
<TE>   His newest album, he says, is just another in what he calls a
slow, natural progression in his music. But a funkier vibe can be
heard in the grooves, including the title song, performed with new
hit-maker Jaheim.</TE>
<TE>   James remains a rarity: an instrumentalist popular enough to play
large venues, where he's learned to feel comfortable. "I realized I
had a talent for performance, which I didn't know. When I got out in
front of a crowd, I became a different person. All I know is that I
like it, and I'm always trying to make the music as good as it can be
according to my internal compass."</TE>

<LD>8pm Dance</LD>
<LD>   The Times has consistently called Paul Taylor one of the two or
three greatest living choreographers--and we're not going to stop
now. Not only does he produce one masterwork after another, but his
daring creative experiments quickly become the standard language of
the art. Consider the varied repertory performed by the Paul Taylor
Dance Company on this latest visit. "Arden Court" (1981) is the kind
of sunny, all-American romp to Baroque music that ballet companies
try to grab ASAP. In the tango suite "Piazzolla Caldera" (1997)
dancers move obsessively from one public sexual entanglement to
another, scarcely noticing the number or gender of their partners and
never satisfied. Since "The Word" (1998) has never been performed
locally, you're on your own. All we know is it features music by
David Israel, classic schoolboy attire by Santo Loquasto and concerns
hazing and other rituals of male bonding.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Taylor Dance Company, Campbell Hall, UC Santa Barbara campus,
Santa Barbara. 8 p.m. Also Saturday, 8 p.m. $16 to $35. (805)
893-3535.</LD>

<TE>   7pm Jazz</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his 40-plus year career, jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter
has been highly regarded as an instrumentalist and a composer. His
work--early with Horace Silver and Maynard Ferguson, later with Art
Blakey, Miles Davis and Weather Report,</TE>
<TE>   plus his own solo efforts--established him as a force interweaving
mainstream and progressive elements. Shorter will work with pianist
Danilo Perez, drummer Brian Blade and bassist John Patitucci this
time around.</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Shorter Quartet, LA Jazz 2002 at USC Bovard Auditorium, 3551
Trousdale Parkway, L.A., 7 p.m. $10 to $28. (213) 740-2167. Also

<TE>   Billy Crudup ("Jesus' Son," "Almost Famous") adds another
wandering soul to his repertoire in Bart Freundlich's drama "World
Traveler." Crudup plays a Manhattan architect who, without a word,
leaves his family to hit the open road in search of a "better life."
Julianne Moore, Karen Allen, Cleavant Derricks, James LeGros and
David Keith are among the people he encounters in his cross-country
adventure.</TE>
<TE>   "World Traveler," rated R for language and some sexuality, opens
Friday at Laemmle's Sunset 5, Hollywood; Town Center, Encino; and
Playhouse 7, Pasadena.</TE>

<TE>   Writers Jessica Blank and Erik Jensen spent six weeks traveling

making its West Coast premiere.</TE>
<TE>   "The Exonerated," Actors' Gang Theatre, 6209 Santa Monica Blvd.,
Hollywood, 8 p.m. Regular schedule: Thursdays to Saturdays, 8 p.m.;

<TE>   8pm Theater</TE>
<TE>   Writer-performer Sandra Tsing Loh's uniquely Southern California
perspective has become a staple of public radio. She frets about her
life in Van Nuys on KCRW-FM (89.9) and weighs in on financial matters
for "Marketplace." But those who've heard her outside their cars know
that she's just as funny--and often more poignant--live and in
person. Her new solo show, "I Worry," gets a workshop staging as part
of the New Work Festival's Next Step series, produced by the Mark
Taper Forum.</TE>
<TE>   "I Worry," Evidence Room, 2220 Beverly Blvd., L.A., Friday, 8

<TE>   "The Sacred Spaces of Pieter Saenredam," a traveling show that
opened earlier this week at the J. Paul Getty Museum, showcases the
paintings and drawings of a Dutch artist who was an innovator in the
field of architectural paintings. Saenredam was the first to
specialize in existing buildings during the 17th century, especially
churches. His depictions of medieval churches are notable now for
their markedly modern simplicity.</TE>
<TE>   "The Sacred Spaces of Pieter Saenredam," J. Paul Getty Museum,

a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Parking

mercurial performer is doing a stripped-down, effects-free,
jazz-tinged show, with the focus on the music from his latest album,
"The Rainbow Children."</TE>

and drink. L.A.'s hip salon Spoken Interludes has an eclectic menu of
words for this month's show, including Michael York, reading from his

<HD>Healthy Profits Don't Equal Good Health</HD>
<DH>Without state oversight, insurers can raise premiums to
cover bad investments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMIE COURT</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the California Public Employees' Retirement System--the Goliath of
buyers--can get stepped on, then without new controls the little
guys--small businesses and individual purchasers--will be crushed.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement by the nation's second-largest purchaser of
health insurance that it expects to pay an average 25% more in
premiums next year should sound an alarm bell in Sacramento that
following the money in the health care system is as important as
dealing with abuses of patients' rights.</LD>
<LD>   While auto, homeowner and commercial insurance companies have to
justify premium hikes and seek state approval for them, no such
requirements apply to health maintenance organizations and health
insurers.</LD>
<TE>   For years politicians in Sacramento have rebuffed efforts to
require that the state regulate HMO premium increases. Cash register
politics contributed to the lack of resolve, but so did a confidence
that markets would self-regulate. This confidence shattered in the
wake of CalPERS' failure to control premiums.</TE>
<TE>   Requiring the state's prior approval for the coming tsunami of HMO
premiums is particularly important this year because the rate hikes
are far in excess of actual medical cost increases. For instance,
analysts at CalPERS, who have greater scrutiny of HMO costs than
state regulators, found price gouging at the state's largest HMO,
Kaiser Permanente.</TE>
<TE>   A memo from the analysts stated, "Kaiser's proposed rates are not
only disappointingly high but also higher than justified target
rates. Further, Kaiser's current approach appears to be to charge
what it thinks the market will bear."</TE>
<TE>   This is how the HMO is treating a system that represents 400,000
Kaiser patients. Imagine how individual purchasers will fare.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is that poor investment returns on Wall Street for HMOs
and insurers are responsible for a good deal of the cost crisis.
Insurers raise premiums based not on claims filed (product cost) but
on their investment results. When interest rates increase (so
investment yields are higher), insurers reduce their price to attract
greater capital for investment, underwriting greater risk. When
interest rates are low, premiums increase to maintain profit levels.
When investments fail, patients and policyholders pay more.</TE>
<TE>   For such reasons, insurers might also stonewall payment on claims
to increase interest income on their capital by investing it in
capital markets longer. While auto policyholders have some
protections against this cycle, there are no comparable tools to
prevent health insurers and HMOs from passing on bad investment
losses to patients.</TE>
<TE>   Another reason prior state approval of HMO premiums and policies
is so critical now is the new breed of policy debuting this year that
barely qualifies as insurance. Under these plans, patients must pay
thousands of dollars out of their own pockets at varying stages
before the HMOs pay. These hollow policies limit employee coverage
and employer costs.</TE>
<TE>   The HMO industry no doubt believes it has found a foolproof way to
make a healthy profit in the age of a patient revolt: Dissolve the
notion of insurance by shifting the risk onto the insured but
continuing to charge or it.</TE>
<TE>   The question is whether employers will buy a product about as
worthless as a fax machine that prints only every other page. The bet
is employers will since it is employees who will bear the increased
risks and burdens.</TE>
<TE>   The state, however, needs to inspect these policies closely to
guarantee that insurance is not simply another market illusion that
disappears when individuals need it most.</TE>
<TE>   How HMOs explain their rate hikes of up to 41% for CalPERS is
thorny for an industry that bragged about controlling rising costs.
No doubt patients' rights laws will be an easy scapegoat, but the
truth is that HMOs have managed only their own profits.</TE>
<TE>   Politicians could turn a blind eye to gripes about HMO delays and
denials when there at least seemed to be some cost savings at the end
of the rainbow. With both patients and the bottom line suffering,
however, the wreck of the health care system is harder than ever to
ignore.</TE>
<TE>   The only silver lining in this dark cloud is that the CalPERS
concession to the HMO industry may garner populist support for real
solutions as more Californians see the possibility of being
uninsured.</TE>

<HD>Start With Palestinian Statehood</HD>
<DH>A European plan to end the occupation first is the best
formula.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAM E. FULLER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What does it take to recognize failure? Secretary of State Colin
Powell's trip has ended in complete collapse, as the administration
remains mired in a "peace process" that is empty of content. We are
back to a brutal and hopeless impasse. The reason for continuing
failure? Let's reduce it to a bumper sticker: "It's the occupation,
stupid." Until that issue is addressed, nothing else will fall into
place.</LD>
<LD>   It is time for some radical new thinking.</LD>
<LD>   The European foreign ministers in February unanimously backed a
proposal that reverses the sequence of the whole game, calling for
the establishment of a Palestinian state as the starting point of a
negotiating process.</LD>
<TE>   The new state would receive immediate international recognition by
the world's states, including the U.S. and Israel, a seat at the
United Nations and immediate global financial assistance and would be
empowered to negotiate with Israel on terms of legal equality.</TE>
<TE>   The virtue of the peace plan is that it vaults over the endless
impasse on security issues that Washington and Israel fruitlessly
insist must come first.</TE>
<TE>   Until there is an imminent, visible and tangible pot of gold at
the end of the rainbow for the Palestinians, Yasser Arafat will
not--indeed cannot--move to eliminate the suicide bombings, the only
weapon the Palestinians possess against the repressive power of the
Israeli state, which seeks to frustrate a meaningful sovereign
Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   With no exit, the rampant bitterness in the battered cities of the
West Bank will shortly translate into horrific new waves of suicide
missions that Israeli security experts acknowledge they cannot stop.</TE>
<TE>   The European plan gives the Palestinians an incentive up front,
with restored institutions, hope, dignity and relief aid to rebuild
their shattered infrastructure, economy and homes. It must be
accompanied by an immediate end to the 35-year Israeli occupation. In
short, when Palestinians have a stake in a new country and a new
society, suicide bombings will rapidly lose their importance.
Palestinians don't like to die anymore than other people do, but they
will be willing to die until genuine gains are accomplished.</TE>
<TE>   They cannot be fobbed off with returns to some negotiating table
where we know that Ariel Sharon's deepest principles will not permit
him to give what a just settlement must have. That "negotiating
table" has been the continual backdrop to expand new Israeli
settlements under all Israeli governments--spreading armed islands
across the Palestinian landscape that shrink future Palestinian
territory and ring them with security roads restricted to Israelis
only.</TE>
<TE>   And let's drop the Israeli myth that "the Palestinians walked
away" from Ehud Barak's deal that "gave them almost everything they
wanted." The deal was badly flawed, as honest Israeli analysts
themselves admit--better, to be sure, than anything offered in the
past but still short of what is required and what is just. No
Palestinian leader could have signed it.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally there are many details in the European Union blueprint
that still need to be worked out. But its essence is to give the
Palestinians something up front that provides confidence that the
negotiations will be conducted on some basis of legal equality and
dignity, and not out of Arafat's battered candle-lit office
surrounded by tanks--the ultimate humiliation that moves people to
rage and vengeance.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, there are some Palestinians who would love to eliminate all
of Israel. But it's not going to happen, and most Palestinians know
that. The vast majority, including Arafat, would quickly settle for a
just and dignified peace. Indeed Arafat would then be empowered to
crush the few pockets of radicalism with full public support once the
public had something real to lose. That's when Palestinians would
start rejecting the terrorists who would threaten their new hard-won
gains.</TE>
<TE>   So let's recognize past failures, get on with some fresh
approaches and let the Europeans have a piece of the action that
abandons Sharon's mindless military solution, which Washington has
sadly supported up to now. Failing that, we will only reap a new
harvest of blood and tears and a frightening expansion of our
confrontation with the Muslim world.</TE>

<HD>Dispel the Myth That Cheap Food Comes Without High Costs</HD>
<DH>Market prices are misleading; they ignore the damage to our
environment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANCES MOORE LAPPE and ANNA LAPPE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Earth Day is a perfect time to celebrate the first, true gift of the
Earth to us: food. Before we toss our hats into the air, though, we
might want to start with an admission.</LD>
<LD>   While we in the United States like to think we're blessed with the
world's best and cheapest food, we've actually let market prices lie
to us.</LD>
<LD>   They don't register all the hidden costs of our "factory farming"
model, costs that undermine the very sustainability of nature's
gifts.</LD>
<TE>   Food prices don't count the fact that soil is eroding on prime
farmland many times faster than nature rebuilds it, or the marine
life we're losing because of nitrogen runoff from overusing
fertilizers. The latter has created a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico
as big as Massachusetts and still growing.</TE>
<TE>   The prices don't include the loss of plant diversity that occurs
when our seed is supplied by just a few companies aggressively
marketing a limited selection or the wells in Midwest states poisoned
by farm chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   They don't consider the over-exploited oceans, where extinction
threatens one-third of fish species, or the farm families and entire
rural communities wiped out by rising farm costs and lower returns.</TE>
<TE>   These are merely the uncounted costs of producing our increasingly
unhealthy diet. Eating it adds a host of additional costs, including
more than 5,000 deaths each year from food-borne illnesses, even as
agribusiness--especially the meat industry--has fought against adding
the cost of stricter food safety procedures to the bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   We've boasted that ours is the world's most efficient food system,
but no business could stay afloat for long while ignoring its real
costs.</TE>
<TE>   Efficiency and sustainability--the maintenance of Earth's gifts to
us and our health over time--can no longer be seen as contradictory
aims.</TE>
<TE>   Looked at this way, solving our food-related environmental and
health crisis doesn't require a change in values. No one wants to
destroy our Earth or get sick from what he or she eats. It requires a
change in perception.</TE>
<TE>   We have to see differently. We have to see, then measure and
count, the real costs of producing food and of our sudden (in
historical terms) shift to a meat-based, processed, high-fat and
sugar diet.</TE>
<TE>   Just as important, we have to see that we can have the healthy
food we need within a more honest framework of cost-counting.</TE>
<TE>   During the last 30 years, agriculturists around the world have
been learning to align with nature's genius to create sustainable
efficiency--getting the most from nature without destroying it.</TE>
<TE>   With true sustainability we do not have to blanket the planet with
pesticides or turn to untried technologies such as genetically
engineered seeds that threaten ecological disruption.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, in the first worldwide study of sustainable farming
practices, covering 70 million acres in more than 50 countries,
researchers noted that applying ecology-protecting methods increased
yields substantially. They recorded increases of 150% in root crops.
True, in some cases sustainable practices can mean lower yields but,
because production costs drop even more, farmers reap better
livelihoods. Besides, overproduction, not underproduction, has been
the bane of U.S. agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   Once we dispel the myth of efficiency hiding costs, we discover
that sustainable is synonymous with real efficiency--getting the most
of our resources over time.</TE>
<TE>   To eat well, we don't have to acquiesce to a degrading
environment, a tragic loss of species, a heart-rending erosion of
family farming. We can redirect tax subsidies to further nonchemical
practices and support independent, ecologically committed farmers,
without fearing that we'll risk inefficiency-induced scarcity.</TE>
<TE>   We must let go of the false trade-off between protecting the
planet and feeding ourselves.</TE>

<HD>A Tabloid Tale Amid the Tomes</HD>
<DH>Campus celebrities such as Cornel West are most valued for
their rainmaking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When we turn academics into celebrities, we can hardly be surprised
when they act like them. Still somehow, we are surprised--even
gravely disappointed--to find that there are divas of Wagnerian
proportions trolling the groves of academe.</LD>
<LD>   Because professors purportedly are smarter than your average bear
or because we assume they've assimilated Kant, we expect them to
behave better, more nobly than a climbing corporate careerist.</LD>
<LD>   But they don't. On the contrary, when crossed or thwarted, they
can be every bit as prickly and pusillanimous as a soprano.</LD>
<TE>   Take Cornel West. After rowing bitterly and publicly with Harvard
President Lawrence Summers over the past six months, the esteemed
professor of African American studies is finally defecting to
Princeton with these unbecoming words on his lips:</TE>
<TE>   "Larry Summers strikes me as the Ariel Sharon of American higher
education," West told the New York Times. "He struck me very much as
a bull in a china shop, and as a bully, in a very delicate and
dangerous situation."</TE>
<TE>   Such vitriol may shock those among us who would have expected a
more graceful exit from a respected scholar, but in a sense West was
right. The situation was delicate. He belongs in a special category.
He's famous. He's one of the favored few paid to be himself. Nothing
more. Nothing less.</TE>
<TE>   But Summers, the former Clinton administration Treasury secretary,
is a bit of a rube in these things perhaps.</TE>
<TE>   He insinuated himself into the arrangement and asked West to
perform differently, to conform more to the scholarly norm.</TE>
<TE>   By so doing, Summers showed that he misunderstood the neat
calculus of modern higher education.</TE>
<TE>   West has image. Image is money, and money is all that matters.</TE>
<TE>   The adage has never been truer than today in the elite
universities: You get what you pay for.</TE>
<TE>   Much as we would like to think of our nation's institutions of
higher learning as blessed isles sheltered from the sordid
panhandling of the capitalist machine, they aren't.</TE>
<TE>   They're businesses like any other. They run on money, which is
part of the reason why interlopers such as the United Auto Workers
have been so successful at unionizing graduate students. It's also
the reason why some professors have been made into pop culture icons
who can command six-figure salaries.</TE>
<TE>   To attract more students (more tuition dollars), universities need
to be newsworthy, maybe even a little notorious, which means they
need a personality who can deliver--somebody who's popular, a bit
piquant, with a high profile and a pleasing edge.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, being a member of a minority group can't hurt.
Neither can a few media connections.</TE>
<TE>   Hence the birth of the academic celebrity, the packed lecture
hall, the fat endowment, the glut of eager applicants, the sustained
rank in U.S. News &amp; World Report and on and on.</TE>
<TE>   In truth, West did what he was hired to do. He along with Henry
Louis Gates Jr. gave Harvard the hottest African American studies
department in the country.</TE>
<TE>   The students loved him, as their recently garnered petition to
keep him clearly shows. They got an easy thousand signatures. That's
what matters, because that's where the money is.</TE>
<TE>   In case any of us failed to notice, the university ceased
primarily to be about teaching long ago.</TE>
<TE>   The ivory tower has been sacked by publicists and social
engineers. They are far more interested in the earning potential of
star power and the insipid thrill of correcting history's sexual,
racial and ethnic mistakes with endowed professorships than they are
in preserving traditional academic pursuits.</TE>
<TE>   Summers has just had his first lesson in priorities, and it won't
be surprising if it costs him his job.</TE>

<LD>Bernard C. Parks' reign at Parker Center effectively ended with the
Los Angeles City Council's refusal to overturn the Police Commission
decision not to appoint him to a second five-year term. Now the
insular, paramilitary, reform-averse Los Angeles Police Department
needs a leader who can transform it into a contemporary department
open to strong civilian oversight and broad community policing.</LD>
<LD>   It's hard to imagine a more important hire for the city. Los
Angeles residents should make clear to the mayor and Police
Commission that they expect a thorough, nationwide, gender- and
colorblind search--including within the department.</LD>
<LD>   When the well-screened candidates arrive for interviews, the
Police Commission and then Mayor James K. Hahn must select the
candidate who most effectively answers yes to the following
questions:</LD>
<TE>   * Are you a reformer? Will you fully support the inspector general
and fight to quickly implement the federal consent decree? Can you
embrace, without reserve, the changes suggested a full decade ago by
the Christopher Commission that work to erase the excessive use of
force, the racism, the sexism and other inequities that linger in the
LAPD?</TE>
<TE>   * Are you a strong disciplinarian? Will you make it a priority to
root out corruption, publicly denounce those who tarnish the badge
and punish rookies and brass with equal resolve? Are you willing to
call a botched police shooting just that and make forceful changes in
policy if needed?</TE>
<TE>   * Are you a solid administrator? Will you fight, even in times of
budget cuts, for the resources your officers need to "protect and
serve"?</TE>
<TE>   * Are you politically savvy? Do you grasp the importance of
listening to the mayor, City Council, Police Commission and other
civilian leaders who can make your job painful or easy depending on
the level of mutual respect you cultivate?</TE>
<TE>   * Do you have a visionary streak? Will you see the city's myriad
problems not as insurmountable obstacles but as challenges and come
up with unexpected solutions?</TE>
<TE>   * Can you be unequivocally fair to every part of the city and
every constituency, making sure that cops are assigned according to
need rather than a political pal's finagling or pressure from vocal
activists?</TE>
<TE>   * Are you a diplomat? Can you stand your ground firmly against the
police union without thoroughly alienating the rank and file?</TE>
<TE>   * Are you an effective cheerleader? Can you get "L.A.'s finest" to
believe in that motto again? Even as you aggressively support
reforms, can you persuade young cops that you have faith in their
talents and appreciate the ever more complex and difficult nature of
their job? Do you have the enthusiasm to spur a successful
recruitment drive that will fill the LAPD's perilously dwindling
ranks?</TE>
<TE>   * Can you, in other words, turn a crew of well-trained but often
disillusioned and disunited men and women of diverse backgrounds into
the crack, tough, well-mannered, honest and dedicated team that the
sprawling, vibrant, dangerous and wonderful city of Los Angeles
deserves in the 21st century?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Before they recess for the summer, the nine men and women of the U.S.
Supreme Court will decide several cases that raise fundamental
questions about the constitutionality of the death penalty as it has
been imposed in this country.</LD>
<LD>   For example, would it be cruel and unusual punishment for Virginia
to execute a mentally retarded defendant? Did a condemned man in
Texas whose lawyer snoozed through the courtroom proceedings get a
fair trial? What about a Tennessee man whose lawyer was awake but
offered no argument in his defense, none, when prosecutors pushed for
a death sentence? Does the 6th Amendment's requirement of trial by
jury permit the trial judge instead of the jury to impose a death
sentence, as happens in nine states?</LD>
<LD>   These decisions are likely to vex the majority of the current
court, which has been hard-pressed to find a death sentence it is
willing to overturn. The justices might decide more easily if they
pick up a copy of the report released this week by Illinois'
bipartisan panel commissioned to examine the death penalty.</LD>
<TE>   Gov. George Ryan convened the panel after new evidence cleared 13
individuals who had been sentenced to death in Illinois and have now
been freed from prison. These revelations so troubled Ryan, a
Republican, that he declared a moratorium on executions until he
could be satisfied that capital sentences were imposed fairly and
that innocent people would not be put to death. He's still not
satisfied. Nor should he be.</TE>
<TE>   The panel concluded that Illinois must institute sweeping changes,
85 recommendations in all, to improve fairness in how it imposes the
death penalty. Among them: Statewide standards, not local practice,
should govern when the death penalty is imposed, better defense
attorneys should be appointed, the testimony of uncorroborated
eyewitnesses or unverified jailhouse informants should not be the
basis on which defendants are sentenced to death, and police should
videotape their interrogations of homicide suspects. These are basic,
common-sense reforms, as applicable to California and the rest of the
nation as to Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   Even with such reforms in place, the Illinois panel concluded,
there would be no guarantee that an innocent person would not be
executed. That finding mirrors other studies. One released earlier
this year reviewed 5,000 capital cases and found that state and
federal courts had overturned death sentences in 68% of these cases.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Ruth Bader
Ginsburg have each publicly expressed concern that shoddy police
work, incompetent lawyers and overzealous judges are sending innocent
people to their deaths. The Illinois report underscores their
concerns and it should trouble them and their colleagues.</TE>

<LD>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan must feel vindicated. "A very
strong recovery is underway," he told Congress Wednesday. That makes
this the shortest recession on record, and Greenspan deserves credit
for getting his interest rate adjustments right. Unfortunately, the
rebounding economy is threatened by President Bush's planned budget
deficits.</LD>
<LD>   Despite Bush's declaration at the White House that he will balance
the budget by 2004, with vetoes if necessary, he is heading for a
guns-and-butter spending spree reminiscent of the Vietnam era.</LD>
<LD>   Counting on an expanding economy for new revenues is folly. As
Greenspan correctly emphasized, it remains unclear how strongly the
economy will grow, which is why the Federal Reserve is unlikely to
raise interest rates at its May 9 meeting. American factories are
still running at only about 75% of capacity, down 3% from even a year
ago. Job growth last month was 58,000, still far below the 150,000 a
month that is considered normal. A real surge in oil prices could
send the economy back into recession.</LD>
<TE>   What remains most worrying, however, is the Bush administration's
budget plan.</TE>
<TE>   The president himself said the U.S. must not "repeat the mistakes
in the '60s," when spending on Vietnam was accompanied by domestic
increases, not cutbacks. But the Bush deficits also have a third
source: Government income will be restricted by massive tax cuts.
According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the Bush
budget plan will be $262 billion in deficit until 2005. If tax cuts
are made permanent instead of sunsetting in 2010, the Treasury will
lose an additional $4 trillion over the following decade. Yet the
administration seems not to be calculating the impact of all this red
ink.</TE>
<TE>   Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson admitted
Wednesday before the House Ways and Means Committee, "In regards to
tax policy, I have not considered that with regard to Medicare," even
though the tax-cut costs would in the end fall hardest on Social
Security and Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush's spending may actually have helped pull the
country out of recession in the short term, but it threatens to drag
the economy back down at the very moment the baby-boom generation
begins to retire. No amount of Federal Reserve wizardry can defeat
Vietnam-era-style deficits.</TE>

<DH>Earnings: Emphasis on cost cutting helps United
Technologies report profit despite a 4.5% decline in revenue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>United Technologies Corp.'s first-quarter profit rose, while earnings
for rival defense contractors Boeing Co. and General Dynamics Corp.
declined.</LD>
<LD>   United Technologies, the maker of Pratt &amp; Whitney jet engines,
Sikorsky helicopters and Hamilton Sundstrand aerospace controls, said
profit rose 6.1% because of cost cutting.</LD>
<LD>   Net income increased to $467million, or 92 cents a share, from
$440million, or 86 cents, a year earlier. Sales were below some
analyst estimates, dropping 4.5% to $6.37billion.</LD>
<TE>   Chief Executive George David has cut jobs and condensed plants as
sales dropped at all of the company's units, led by a 9.1% decline at
its Carrier unit. A $100-million gain from an environmental
settlement was used to mostly fund the cost cutting at Carrier, the
world's largest maker of air conditioners.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of United Technologies fell $3.28 to $69.80. They had risen
13% this year as investors bet military suppliers would get more
government business.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company and the No. 2 U.S.
defense contractor, posted its first quarterly loss in more than four
years and said it may cut several thousand jobs because of cost
overruns at a satellite unit.</TE>
<TE>   The company lost $1.25billion, or $1.54 a share, in the first
quarter, contrasted with profit of $1.24billion, or $1.45, a year
earlier. Excluding a $1.8-billion write-down of purchases required by
an accounting change, profit fell a greater-than-expected 21%. Sales
rose 4% to $13.8billion.</TE>
<TE>   Earnings declined 50% at Boeing's space unit, mainly because of
higher production costs in a satellite business it bought from Hughes
Electronics Corp. Shares of the Chicago-based company fell $3.33 to
$45.37. They had climbed 26% this year, the second- largest increase
for a Dow Jones industrial average component.</TE>
<TE>   Profit in the military aircraft and missiles unit helped offset
the space slump, jumping 48% to $363million. The unit's sales rose
22% to almost $3billion, helped by rising deliveries of its F/A-18
Hornet jet fighter, C-17 Globemaster transport plane and AH-64 Apache
attack helicopter.</TE>
<TE>   Earnings at General Dynamics, maker of the M-1A1 tank, fell 4.6%
because it had a tax-related gain in the year-earlier period. Net
income dropped to $229million, or $1.13 a share, from $240million, or
$1.19, a year earlier. Sales rose 17% to $3.12billion.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding a gain of $28million, or 14 cents, in the year-earlier
quarter from a research and development tax settlement with the
government, profit then would have been $212million, or $1.05.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Falls Church, Va.-based General Dynamics rose 46 cents
to $93.01. They've risen 37% in the last year.</TE>

<HD>Fox Series 'Ally McBeal' to Go Off the Air in May</HD>
<DH>Television: The show brought the network critical raves,
but its ratings had dropped off from peak years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Ally McBeal," which helped steer the Fox network brand away from its
tabloid image and gave it some of the critical cachet shared by the
more established broadcast television networks, will end its
five-year run in May, the network announced late Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The move means that News Corp.'s television operation will see the
departure this spring of two of the biggest hit series in Fox's
evolution, as "The X-Files" takes its final bow in May after nine
years on the air.</LD>
<LD>   At one time, "Ally McBeal" and "The X-Files" gave Fox a powerful
one-two punch as it emerged from the shadows of bigger players NBC,
ABC and CBS.</LD>
<TE>   A source said the network and series creator David E. Kelley came
to a mutual agreement about ending "Ally McBeal." Neither Kelley nor
Fox officials could be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   A statement released by Fox quoted Kelley as saying, "It's sad to
say goodbye to something you love, even when perhaps it's time."</TE>
<TE>   Ratings for "Ally McBeal" have dropped off considerably from peak
years. The series also had been under-performing in reruns on News
Corp.'s FX cable network.</TE>
<TE>   Produced by Twentieth Century Fox Television, "Ally McBeal" not
only made series star Calista Flockhart a media sensation, the show
also brought Fox critical raves, moving the network's image away from
such fare as "Beverly Hills, 90210."</TE>
<TE>   "Ally McBeal," nominated multiple times for Emmy Awards, was
honored as the best comedy in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Viewers, meanwhile, were attracted to the series' mix of comedic,
musical and dramatic elements, as Kelley used his quirkier side to
depict the goings-on at a Boston law firm.</TE>
<TE>   Flockhart, in the process, went from working actress to media
star, becoming an icon as both an urban professional and single woman
looking for love.</TE>
<TE>   Such was the show's--and Flockhart's--popularity that Kelley and
Fox repackaged the series as a half-hour comedy during the 1999-2000
season, though "Ally," as it was called, flopped.</TE>
<TE>   "Ally McBeal," meanwhile, appeared to find fresh legs when the
show added Robert Downey Jr., in something of a casting coup, as a
recurring character during the 2000-2001 season. It was Downey's
first role after being released from Corcoran State Prison, where he
had served time for violating probation terms set after previous drug
arrests.</TE>
<TE>   His pairing with Flockhart immediately sparked renewed interest in
the show and garnered headlines. Two subsequent drug arrests for
Downey, however, led Kelley to write him off the show at the end of
last season.</TE>
<TE>   Fox said the "Ally McBeal" series finale will air May 20. Kelley's
relationship with the studio, meanwhile, continues.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to two existing series, ABC's "The Practice" and Fox's
"Boston Public," he has written a pilot for Fox called "Girls Club."
It concerns three young female attorneys who live in a loft in San
Francisco.</TE>

<HD>AMR Posts $575-Million Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>American Airlines parent AMR Corp., highlighting the airline
industry's struggle to recover from 2001, on Wednesday posted a
record $575-million loss for the first quarter and indicated its
second-quarter loss would well exceed Wall Street's expectations.</LD>
<LD>   The world's largest carrier, still trying to rebound from the
effect of last year's recession and terrorist attacks, continues to
grapple with the soft U.S. economy, weak passenger traffic and lower
average fares. Sluggish business travel, in particular, remains a key
hurdle because it accounts for the majority of American's income.</LD>
<LD>   "We are making some progress," Tom Horton, AMR's chief financial
officer, said in a conference call. But he added, "We are climbing
out of a very, very deep hole."</LD>
<TE>   The loss narrowed from AMR's $798-million deficit in last year's
fourth quarter, but was still a record first-quarter loss for the
Fort Worth-based firm. The loss, equal to $3.71 per diluted share,
included a $27-million charge related to a change in tax laws,
compared with a net loss of $43 million, or 28 cents a share, in the
first quarter of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding the charge, AMR lost $548 million in the latest quarter,
or $3.53 a share, a tad better than the $3.55-a-share loss expected
by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call. Analysts also
had expected AMR to lose $1.06 a share in the second quarter, but
Horton signaled that the loss could be much bigger even though
passenger traffic is slowly rebounding.</TE>
<TE>   The problem for American and the industry overall is that much of
the increased travel is being stimulated by fare sales, so the added
revenue isn't offsetting the airlines' costs. And some carriers'
recent efforts to raise fares failed when their rivals didn't follow
suit.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, American's revenue yield--or average fare--dropped 16% in
the first quarter compared with a year earlier. AMR's overall
first-quarter revenue fell 13% to $4.1 billion from $4.8 billion.
(AMR's year-earlier results don't include the operations of Trans
World Airlines, which AMR acquired in April 2001.)</TE>
<TE>   The industry is expected to show first-quarter losses totaling
more than $2 billion, and the major carriers aren't expected to turn
profitable until the second half of 2002, if then. Horton declined to
predict when AMR would report quarterly earnings again.</TE>
<TE>   "It will come; I just can't tell you when," he said.</TE>
<TE>   American said some of its overseas markets also remain especially
weak, including Europe and Latin America, where unrest in Venezuela
and economic problems are depressing travel.</TE>
<TE>   On the plus side, Horton said American hopes to add 3,000 more
jobs by year's end as it continues to gradually build back service.
Immediately after Sept. 11, American slashed 20% of its operations
and about 20,000 jobs, and so far has added back about 5,000 of those
positions. Still, American's operations will be about 11% below
year-earlier levels when the current quarter ends, Horton said.</TE>
<TE>   After the report, AMR's stock fell 57 cents a share, to $23.65, on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Andersen Talks on Settlements Remain Stalled</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Accounting firm Andersen continued its attempts to reach settlements
with federal prosecutors and class-action lawsuit attorneys in
separate meetings and discussions Wednesday but was unable to
conclude agreements.</LD>
<LD>   Sources familiar with the firm's efforts to craft a deal with the
Justice Department to defer prosecution of an obstruction-of-justice
indictment said there were still significant issues to deal with.</LD>
<LD>   The sources said that although both sides planned more discussions
and progress had been made, it was unclear when or whether an
agreement would be reached.</LD>
<TE>   The talks are focusing on the wording of a deal under which
Andersen would offer an admission of wrongdoing for destroying
documents sought in the federal probe of Enron Corp.'s accounting and
subsequent bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen would admit wrongdoing, but stop short of pleading
guilty. The firm would then enter a probationary period with the
charges dropped if it enacted reforms and did not violate any laws.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, Andersen attorneys met in New York with lawyers
representing Enron investors and employees seeking to recover losses
from the Houston energy trader's Chapter 11 filing.</TE>
<TE>   Those talks were snagged over the question of how plaintiffs could
reach a settlement with Andersen that would not set a precedent
limiting what it could collect from other defendants in the
litigation, including banks and investment banks that worked for
Enron, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Though the talks ended with the attorneys heading for the airport
to return to their respective offices, a source familiar with the
discussions said that the parties planned to continue negotiating.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has offered $250 million in insurance money and an
additional $50 million in cash to settle the claims.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, more details came out on the structure of various deals
to sell pieces of Andersen's business to other accounting firms.</TE>
<TE>   Regional offices and practice groups are looking to bolt for other
firms, and a pattern for how these deals might get done is emerging,
said Allan Koltin, an industry consultant helping to broker several
deals.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has preliminary agreements to sell various offices and
parts of its U.S. business to Deloitte &amp; Touche, KPMG and
leveraged-buyout firm Fox Paine &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, Andersen wants a "finder's fee" payment of $100,000 to
$200,000 for every partner who moves to a new firm, Koltin said.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, the acquiring company would have to pay an equipment
fee for hard assets such as computers and office furniture that could
approach $200,000 a partner, Koltin said.</TE>
<TE>   The acquiring firm also would have to agree to pick up certain
lease obligations and to offer employment for about eight non-partner
Andersen professionals and two members of the support staff at their
current wages, Koltin said.</TE>
<TE>   The acquiring firms are in turn asking for total indemnification
from Andersen's liabilities, something that could be conferred only
under a court-approved settlement with the claimants in the various
suits against Andersen or through a bankruptcy proceeding.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has about 1,700 U.S. partners. If half left under such
terms, the surviving firm would be able to raise $340 million,
slightly more than the $300 million in insurance money and other cash
Andersen has offered to settle the class-action lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   An Andersen representative said the agreements were not following
a set formula but that it was clear that partners at the firm were
considering outside deals as a way to protect their staffs and to
make sure that clients continue to receive full service.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said, "a critical mass" of partners remained committed
to a plan by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker to
transform Andersen into a smaller, audit-oriented accounting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, a panel of judges ruled that Enron shareholders
and employees seeking billions of dollars in damages over the firm's
collapse must press their claims in federal court in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Possible conflicting interests in Houston, where Enron is based,
would not jeopardize a fair resolution of nearly 100 suits to be
consolidated in the federal court there, the panel concluded.</TE>

<HD>Touting Communities' Hope</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE ROMNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ten years after riots scarred South Los Angeles and gave birth to
Operation Hope, the founder of the nonprofit organization loaded
dozens of bankers and scores of community leaders onto buses
Wednesday to show off neighborhood progress.</LD>
<LD>   Although plenty remains to be done, group founder John Bryant
pointed to progress throughout the area as five buses rumbled through
the Crenshaw district, the thriving Latino commercial corridor of
Huntington Park, Inglewood's small-business district and the
high-priced homes of Baldwin Hills.</LD>
<LD>   Many of South-Central's grimmest corridors were not part of the
tour. But newly built housing developments and reconstructed shopping
centers in more broadly defined South Los Angeles, along with neatly
landscaped residential streets, impressed some first-time visitors.</LD>
<TE>   "This will definitely give the bank more confidence in this area,"
said Alan Thian, chairman and chief executive of Rosemead-based First
Continental Bank. "My impression has always been that South-Central
is pretty run-down."</TE>
<TE>   Thian said his bank--with $270 million in assets--has financed
some mom-and-pop laundermats in South Los Angeles. But Wednesday he
saw that larger-scale commercial development has taken place and more
is possible.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant formed Operation Hope as a 26-year-old businessman with a
passionate yet vaguely formed notion to turn things around. His first
bus tour netted eight bankers. But in the decade, the
organization--and the tours--have grown.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant has become a key contact for banks large and small
throughout the region that have increased their lending activity in
South Los Angeles while pouring millions into Operation Hope.</TE>
<TE>   And the bankers have found a guide to potential lending
opportunities in neighborhoods they long feared, and a vehicle to
meet mandatory federal Community Reinvestment Act requirements.</TE>
<TE>   "We wouldn't give them money if we weren't getting something out
of it," said Gary S. Dunn, vice president of Fremont Investment &amp;
Loan, an Anaheim Hills-based institution that joined Bryant's board
after the riots and has increased its lending in low-income pockets
of Los Angeles and Huntington Park as a result.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant concedes that he puts an aggressively positive spin on
South Los Angeles. As he handed out copies of his newly released book
on financial literacy, he promised participants they would see no
graffiti or drug dealers in his South-Central. But as buses cruised
down Vermont Avenue toward Florence, they passed more than six police
cars guarding a corner blocked by yellow crime scene tape.</TE>
<TE>   Marva Smith Battle-Bey, executive director of the Vermont Slauson
Economic Development Corp., was slightly more realistic as the bus
she guided edged west on Slauson Avenue. One strip mall that her
organization purchased in 1986 tanked, and the group sold it a few
years later, she said. Rioters torched it in 1992 and the lot still
sits empty.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe someone will come along and rediscover that property," she
said hopefully.</TE>
<TE>   To Bryant, however, hope is a tool in itself, and showing bankers
the positive change has helped shift their mind-set over the last
decade.</TE>

<HD>Earnings Fall at Merrill, J.P. Morgan</HD>
<DH>Brokerages: Slump in investment banking business helps drag
down first-quarter profits and revenues at the two financial giants,
but shares rise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two of the nation's biggest financial companies reported lower
first-quarter earnings Wednesday as Wall Street continues to struggle
with the fallout from stocks' bear market, the economy's slump and
Enron Corp.'s failure.</LD>
<LD>   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. said first-quarter earnings fell 26% from a
year earlier, as merger-advisory and underwriting fees dropped. But
profit margins rose to their highest level in a year as the biggest
securities firm cut costs.</LD>
<LD>   J.P. Morgan Chase, the nation's No.2 commercial bank and also a
major investment bank, said profit fell for an eighth quarter,
dragged down by a slump in underwriting fees and losses on
investments. But Morgan's consumer-banking business posted strong
results.</LD>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch said it earned $647 million, or 67 cents a share, in
the quarter, compared with $874million, or 92 cents, in the
year-earlier period. Revenue totaled $5.1 billion, down 21%.</TE>
<TE>   The company's profit exceeded the 65-cent average estimate of Wall
Street analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call. That helped
the stock edge higher: It gained 2 cents to $48.37 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill has been slashing expenses to offset declining revenue in
its brokerage, investment banking and asset management units. The
firm's work force has declined by 1,000 since the beginning of the
year, bringing the number of employees to 56,400, compared with
70,300 a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The firm "is doing as well as we can expect given the
environment," said Paul Stocking, an analyst at American Express
Financial Advisors, which owned 1.2 million shares of Merrill at
year-end. "Merrill can't turn a bad environment into a good one."</TE>
<TE>   Helped by cost cuts, Merrill's first-quarter pretax profit margin
widened to 19.9% from 15.2% in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill is facing another big challenge: New York State Atty. Gen.
Eliot Spitzer last week accused the firm's analysts of promoting
shares of Internet companies in 2000 and 2001 to try to snare
investment-banking business from the subject companies.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill and Spitzer are meeting this week to try to negotiate a
settlement that would allow the firm to avoid criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, J.P. Morgan Chase said net income dropped 18% in the
first quarter to $982 million, or 48 cents a share, from $1.2
billion, or 58 cents, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Operating earnings, excluding certain one-time items, totaled
$1.15 billion, or 57 cents a share, down from $1.53 billion, or 74
cents a share a year earlier. Total operating revenue fell 8% to $7.9
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts were encouraged because the company's consumer banking
arm showed robust results. Consumer banking, which includes 530 Chase
branches, posted a 25% rise in profit, to $526 million. By contrast,
the firm's investment-banking fees plunged 21% in the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The consumer division's results helped drive Morgan's shares up
$1.89 to $37.27 on the NYSE, a three-month high.</TE>
<TE>   But J.P. Morgan was a major lender to Enron, and is embroiled in
lawsuits seeking to recoup the bank's money.</TE>
<TE>   A much smaller brokerage on Wednesday reported record earnings:
Jefferies Group Inc., an institutional stock trader and investment
bank, said first-quarter earnings rose 13% as investment banking
revenue more than doubled.</TE>
<TE>   Net income rose to a record $17.7 million, or 65 cents a share,
from $15.7 million, or 63 cents, a year earlier, even though total
revenue was off 7% to $195.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Jefferies shares rose rose 88 cents to $48.19 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Fed Signals Low Rates to Persist</HD>
<DH>Economy: Chairman Greenspan's willingness to leave
short-term rates at 1.75% stems from doubts of stable revival.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan signaled Wednesday the
central bank will leave short-term interest rates at a four-decade
low despite the economy showing signs of a recovery that would
ordinarily prompt inflation-dampening rate hikes.</LD>
<LD>   Greenspan's willingness to permit low rates to continue performing
their growth-spurring work stems from a virtual absence of inflation
and deep doubts about whether the economy's recent revival is
durable.</LD>
<LD>   Although the country has done considerably better in recent months
than most people had predicted, many economists wonder what will keep
it growing. Consumers, who confounded forecasters by continuing to
buy cars, clothes and houses during the recession, may be tapped out.
Many executives are still hung over from the business investment
binge of the late 1990s, and so are reluctant to expand hiring and
production.</LD>
<TE>   The result, according to Greenspan: "The strength of the economic
expansion that is underway remains to be clarified.</TE>
<TE>   "Either we are going to get a significant increase in production,
in profits, in capital investment" or "we'll slip back," he told
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Greenspan's remarks all but ensure that Fed
policymakers will leave their signal-sending federal funds rate at a
40-year low of 1.75% when they meet May 7 and again June 25 and 26,
and they may not begin nudging the rate up until late summer.</TE>
<TE>   Interest rates across the economy are keyed to the federal funds
rate, which is what banks charge each other for short-term loans.
Keeping the funds rate low would help encourage new investment,
spending and growth by holding down borrowing costs generally. But
doing so in an economy that's already reviving risks setting off an
inflationary spiral.</TE>
<TE>   However, Greenspan suggested Wednesday there are so few signs of
inflation in the current situation and evidence of revival is so
tentative that the risk is worth taking.</TE>
<TE>   "The Federal Reserve should have ample opportunity to adjust
policy to keep inflation pressures contained once sustained, solid
economic expansion is in view," he told the Joint Economic Committee.</TE>
<TE>   As if to demonstrate the economy's continued weakness, computer
giant IBM Corp. announced late Wednesday that profit during the first
three months of the year fell 32% and sales slipped 12%.
Seattle-based Boeing Corp. also reported a quarterly loss, its first
in four years.</TE>
<TE>   The stock market reacted to Greenspan's remarks and poor corporate
profit reports by sinking. The Dow Jones industrial average fell
80.54 points, or 0.8%, to 10,220.78. The broader S&amp;P 500 index slid
2.3 points, or 0.2%, to 1,126.07, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq
composite index lost 6.12 points, or 0.3%, to 1,810.67.</TE>
<TE>   It is widely agreed that one of the chief causes of the recession,
which began in March of last year, was the bursting of a stock market
bubble that erased trillions of dollars in paper profits and caused
especially affluent households to trim their spending. In his
testimony Wednesday, Greenspan went out of his way to argue that no
comparable bubble has developed in housing despite the ongoing
strength in the housing market.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed chairman argued that the size and cost of real estate
transactions are larger than those in stocks, making the housing
market less prone to wild price run-ups. In addition, he said that
the market for housing is more localized than that for stocks, so if
a problem occurs, it is likely to remain contained.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Greenspan conceded, local bubbles and busts do
occur, and real estate experts say that several appear to be under
way. They include San Francisco, where median house prices have
climbed 83% since 1995, or twice the national average, and Boston,
where they have rocketed 96%, according to the National Assn. of
Realtors.</TE>
<TE>   "The housing market is localized" and thus less prone to busts
that produce economy-wide damage, said Wellesley College economist
Karl Case. But he said Greenspan "may be protesting a little too
much" in dismissing the threat of a housing bubble.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed's policymaking Open Market Committee slashed the federal
funds rate 11 times last year in an effort to offset the effects of
the stock crash and then the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. By late
January, the committee appeared confident that it had reversed the
economic tide and stopped its rate cutting.</TE>
<TE>   An early glimpse at whether the low rates are sustainable will
come next week when the government issues its preliminary estimate of
how much the economy grew in the first three months of the year.
Forecasters said the annualized growth rate for the gross domestic
product could be as high as 5%.</TE>
<TE>   If so, pressure could grow for the central bank to begin reversing
its interest cuts and begin raising rates.</TE>
<TE>   "These low rates are fine when the economy is in recession, but
they are absolutely inappropriate when it is in recovery," said
Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at Bank of America in New York.</TE>

<HD>Bush Considers Kohn, Bernanke for Federal Reserve Board</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush is narrowing his choices for filling two vacancies on
the powerful Federal Reserve Board, Washington sources said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Bush is seriously considering Donald Kohn, the Fed board's advisor
on monetary policy and one of Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's most
trusted lieutenants, to fill one vacancy on the seven-member Fed
board, a senior Bush administration official said.</LD>
<LD>   The official also said the president's meeting Wednesday with
Princeton economist Ben Bernanke suggested that Bush had all but
settled on the widely respected authority on monetary policy for the
second vacant seat.</LD>
<TE>   The Fed governors, along with a rotating list of regional Fed bank
presidents, set U.S. monetary policy, in part by adjusting key
short-term interest rates. They also can influence stock and bond
markets with their comments on the health of the nation's economy.
Bernanke confirmed that he met with Bush. Kohn declined to comment,
as did the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Others who have been looked at by the administration for the seats
include economists Bill Dudley at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and Richard
Berner at Morgan Stanley. Several other academic and Wall Street
economists have been eyed as well.</TE>
<TE>   Bush already has made two Fed board appointments. Last year, he
selected Susan Bies and Mark Olson, both of whom have banking
backgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   Bernanke, 48, part of the elite panel at the National Bureau of
Economic Research that dates U.S. business cycles and who has chaired
Princeton's economics department since 1996, surfaced as a potential
Fed board candidate a few months ago.</TE>
<TE>   In his writings, he has advocated inflation targeting, a tool used
by the European Central Bank and other major central banks. But
Greenspan has said such a target could represent "an unhelpful and
false precision."</TE>
<TE>   As for Kohn, "I think [he] would be an excellent choice," said
former Fed Gov. Lyle E. Gramley, who said he had no knowledge of
whether Kohn was under consideration.</TE>
<TE>   Gramley described Kohn as extraordinarily bright and added that he
commands great respect from Greenspan.</TE>
<TE>   One empty seat on the Fed board was vacated by Laurence Meyer,
whose term expired in January. The other was held by Edward Kelley,
who stepped down in December.</TE>

<HD>Ford's Loss Beats Analyst Estimates</HD>
<DH>Earnings: After its fourth quarter of red ink, the auto
maker says it will turn a profit in the second quarter and be in the
black for the year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co. said Wednesday that it had a first-quarter operating
loss of $108 million, or 6 cents a share, beating expectations thanks
to a strengthening economy and improving auto market.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts had expected Ford to lose 15 cents a share from
operations. The operating loss contrasts with the $1.13 billion, or
60 cents, Ford earned before one-time items in the first quarter of
2001.</LD>
<LD>   Factoring in special charges related to accounting changes, Ford's
net loss was $800 million, or 45 cents a share, down from a
$1.06-billion net profit in the first three months of last year.
First-quarter sales were $39.86 billion, down 6% from $42.45 billion
the year before.</LD>
<TE>   "These are pretty anemic results," said Scott Hill, auto analyst
with investment bank Sanford C. Bernstein. But the
better-than-expected results are "an important and positive step off
very low expectations," he added.</TE>
<TE>   It was the fourth straight quarter of red ink for the world's No.
2 auto maker, which lost $5.4 billion last year and initiated a
far-reaching restructuring plan in January.</TE>
<TE>   But Ford, which has a number of new vehicles coming in the second
half of 2002, says it will turn a moderate profit in the second
quarter and will be in the black for the year.</TE>
<TE>   "Our first-quarter performance shows that our revitalization plan
efforts are taking hold and we are heading in the right direction,"
Chief Executive Bill Ford said in a statement. "While there is still
a great deal of uncertainty in our industry, the general economic
climate is improving and we are on schedule to meet or surpass our
2002 earnings milestone."</TE>
<TE>   Ford will probably earn 8 cents to 9 cents per share above the
Wall Street consensus of 14 cents for the second quarter, Chief
Financial Officer Martin Inglis said. "We're on track to reach all
our milestones," Inglis said in a conference call with security
analysts and journalists.</TE>
<TE>   Since the plan was announced in January--and paid for with a
$4.1-billion charge in the fourth quarter of last year--Ford has
eliminated a shift at a truck factory in New Jersey, raised $5
billion through a bond sale, eliminated 1,500 salaried jobs, decided
to discontinue four car and truck models and announced three new
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Ford's U.S. market share was down nearly two percentage points, to
20.7% from 22.6% this time last year, due largely to lower fleet
sales and the changeover from the previous Expedition sport utility
vehicle to the new model that begins shipping next month.</TE>
<TE>   "The company no doubt cut costs feverishly and a return to
proactive revenue management enabled marketing expenses to fall,"
said John Casesa, automotive analyst with Merrill Lynch.</TE>
<TE>   Ford's vehicle production in the second half is likely to decline
from the first half by about 20% for a 2002 total of about 4 million
in North America, reflecting lower industry sales overall. But
several high-margin Ford vehicles will hit the market in the second
half of the year to boost revenue, Inglis said, including the Ford
Expedition, Lincoln Navigator, Volvo XC90 and Land Rover Range Rover
sport utility vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Ford shares closed Wednesday at $16.18, up 32 cents in trading on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Employers Unlikely to Imitate CalPERS' Hike</HD>
<DH>Insurance: Analysts say the fund's situation is unique and
most workers won't see such high premium increases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In accepting a staggering 25% increase in health insurance premiums
for next year, the California Public Employees' Retirement System on
Wednesday seemed to signal a new round of spiraling health-care cost
increases.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a market decision everybody is going to be facing," said
CalPERS President William D. Crist as he urged "more militant" action
to alert policymakers of a deepening crisis in cost and availability
of health coverage.</LD>
<LD>   But analysts and business groups say most employers--and by
extension their workers--won't be strapped with such steep premium
increases.</LD>
<TE>   Although experts view the CalPERS action as a clear indication of
the return of soaring health increases, they say the pension fund's
situation was in many ways unique and doesn't necessarily point to a
further escalation of what many are calling a national health-care
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Premium increases nationally are expected to remain at about 15%
this year and next, analysts and large insurers said. The increases
will vary by region, and small businesses generally will face greater
rate pressures, prompting some to drop health insurance for their
employees.</TE>
<TE>   But most health insurers won't be looking for the level of
increases approved by CalPERS, which will hit some members with hikes
of more than 50% in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "It decidedly does not have any meaningful implications for the
large insurers," said Credit Suisse health-care analyst Joseph D.
France.</TE>
<TE>   In a report Wednesday, France said the big rate hike at CalPERS
reflected the fund's traditionally low rates and historically
generous benefits for its 1.2 million members. During some years in
the mid-1990s, CalPERS enjoyed a reduction in health premiums as it
wielded its size to garner concessions from competing health plans.</TE>
<TE>   But this year marked a turning point for CalPERS, the nation's
second-largest buyer of health insurance after the federal
government. Despite several months of negotiations, some of CalPERS'
health maintenance organizations adamantly stood by their initial
bids, even as CalPERS' staff threatened to consolidate the number of
HMOs it contracts with.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, CalPERS voted Wednesday to drop PacifiCare and Health
Net, which will force about 350,000 people to switch to Kaiser
Permanente, Blue Shield or three smaller regional HMOs. (CalPERS also
operates self-funded preferred provider organizations, which are
generally more expensive for members. But four-fifths of all CalPERS'
members are enrolled in HMOs.)</TE>
<TE>   Analysts were divided on whether other employers would follow
CalPERS' lead and seek to narrow the number of health plan offerings
to workers.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Lee, chief executive of the Pacific Business Group on
Health, which negotiates for 44 major companies in California, said
he expects employers to look very closely at consolidation because
many plans have an overlapping network of doctors and hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   In CalPERS' case, officials said 90% of the members who will be
forced to leave PacifiCare and Health Net will be able to keep their
existing doctors through one of the remaining plans.</TE>
<TE>   Employers "will be looking at the value of the health-care
delivery, not relying on playing one plan off another," Lee said.
Besides comparing rates, Lee said, employers will be asking questions
such as, "How do the plans distinguish themselves on disease
management, on the quality of care?"</TE>
<TE>   As with CalPERS officials and many analysts, Lee didn't see any
letup in rising health premiums any time soon. Costs nationally have
been spiraling in the face of rising drug costs, bigger
reimbursements at hospitals and new medical technologies, among other
factors. In California, a critical shortage of nurses and the
mandated earthquake-retrofitting of hospitals also have added to
health-care costs.</TE>
<TE>   David Olson, a spokesman at Health Net, one of California's
largest HMOs, said he hasn't seen evidence yet of employers
consolidating plans. Olson said Health Net was disappointed that
CalPERS dropped its plan, but he also noted that the CalPERS account
wasn't profitable.</TE>
<TE>   At Health Net, Olson said, health premiums for other employers
next year aren't expected to rise anywhere near what it was seeking
at CalPERS. He said costs probably will go up about 15% in California
and slightly lower in the Northeast.</TE>
<TE>   "CalPERS is not a bellwether," he said.</TE>

<HD>HP Says Compaq Merger Approved by 51.4%</HD>
<DH>Computers: Winning margin could be tough for Walter Hewlett
to overcome. He indicates he will keep fighting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN KAPLAN and DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. inched closer Wednesday to finalizing its
controversial $19-billion bid to acquire Compaq Computer Corp. after
it announced that 51.4% of voting shareholders cast their ballots in
favor of the deal.</LD>
<LD>   According to a preliminary tally of proxy votes, 837.9 million
shares voted in favor of the merger and 792.6 million voted against
it. An "insignificant number" of votes remain to be counted, but not
enough to sway the deal, HP said.</LD>
<LD>   The tallies, compiled by proxy certification firm IVS Associates,
come less than a week before a Delaware judge hears arguments in
dissident HP director Walter Hewlett's lawsuit seeking to stop the
merger. Analysts and legal experts say Walter Hewlett faces an uphill
fight. If HP's margin of 45 million votes holds up, it would be
enough to overcome claims by Hewlett that 17 million "yes" votes cast
by Deutsche Asset Management should be thrown out.</LD>
<TE>   Hewlett, son of company co-founder William Hewlett, alleged in his
lawsuit that HP improperly steered business to Deutsche Bank to win
the bank's support for the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett indicated Wednesday that he would continue his fight.</TE>
<TE>   "The margin of this vote was extremely narrow," said the William
R. Hewlett Revocable Trust, which counts Walter Hewlett as a trustee
and holds 3.7% of HP shares. "These are preliminary results, and both
sides will have the opportunity to examine and challenge the proxy
tabulation prior to final certification.</TE>
<TE>   "In addition, the pending litigation with Hewlett-Packard in the
Delaware Chancery Court must be heard before any final outcome is
determined."</TE>
<TE>   With shareholders voting in favor of the merger by a margin of 2.8
percentage points, the only real hope for Hewlett now is that Judge
William Chandler III may be so troubled by allegations of vote buying
that he will throw out all the ballots, not just the ones in dispute,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Delaware Court of Chancery could void the election,
especially if HP's 'vote buying' was egregious and there is a
suggestion that Deutsche Bank wasn't the only target," said Reinier
Kraakman, an expert on corporate law at Harvard University.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett might have to depend on the second key allegation in his
lawsuit, that HP improperly swayed the influential Institutional
Shareholder Services, which endorsed the takeover, said Columbia
University corporate law expert John Coffee, who has done consulting
work for HP.</TE>
<TE>   "If he won that, then there is an argument that the court could
give relief by requiring a new election," Coffee said.</TE>
<TE>   HP revealed this week that federal investigators from the Justice
Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are looking
into Hewlett's allegations.</TE>
<TE>   But even a revote isn't likely to change the ultimate outcome,
said Mark Specker, managing director of SoundView Technology Group in
San Francisco. Most shareholders are "likely to vote along very
similar lines," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The main opponents of the deal were the families of co-founders
William Hewlett and David Packard, which together with their trusts
and foundations control about 18% of the company's shares. Without
their votes, the acquisition would have been approved by a margin of
about 2 to 1, the company said. Compaq shareholders approved the deal
in mid-March.</TE>
<TE>   "We are gratified that the preliminary vote tally validates that
HP shareholders voted the majority of their shares in support of the
merger," said Chief Executive Carly Fiorina, who lobbied intensely to
overcome initial skepticism about the deal.</TE>
<TE>   "We are eager to put this difficult period behind us and look
forward to doing business as the new HP."</TE>
<TE>   If Walter Hewlett requests one, a recount of the proxy votes would
last about a week. A process for challenging the final tally also
could take an additional day or two. After that, IVS can release a
final, certified vote tally.</TE>
<TE>   To vote shares in the proxy battle, shareholders had to check off
a box on a card to say they were for or against a slate of candidates
that would express their wishes at the HP annual meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The voter also could check off a box to abstain. About 1 million
votes are still being examined, according to a source familiar with
the situation.</TE>
<TE>   HP released the results of the tally after the markets closed.
During regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday,
HP shares rose 5cents to close at $18.65 and Compaq shares gained 28
cents to close at $10.68.</TE>

<HD>On Tiny Screens, Advertisers See Opportunity</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>

<LD>The wireless revolution has bombarded cell phones and other hand-held
devices with opportunities for users to shop, play video games, check
weather reports and trade stocks. So it should come as little
surprise that advertisers are trying to squeeze their way onto the
tiny screens as well.</LD>
<LD>   Attracted by the prospect of seizing a piece of real estate that
traditionally has been devoid of ads, marketers are fantasizing about
how they can use matchbook-size screens to sell items such as movie
tickets and Chevrolets.</LD>
<LD>   Tens of thousands of college basketball fans who signed up for a
play-along cell phone game from ESPN received scores during last
month's NCAA tournament with a message: "Presented by Chevy Trucks."</LD>
<TE>   "Over the course of the tournament, we delivered a significant
amount of exposure for Chevy," said Riley McDonough, vice president
of sales for the ESPN Internet group.</TE>
<TE>   New York-based media analyst Jack Myers predicts that 1% of all
advertising spending eventually will be directed toward mobile
devices. That may seem paltry, but it amounts to a $2.6-billion
market by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   But forecasts for mobile advertising revenue vary
significantly--an indication of its uncertain future. Analysts at
Forrester Research anticipate less than $1 billion in 2005, even as
market researchers at Kelsey Group expect the figure to reach $6.8
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of where the actual figure ends up, most acknowledge
that the opportunities are significant. "M-advertising" already is
accepted in parts of Europe and Asia.</TE>
<TE>   In a campaign in Hong Kong for the Arnold Schwarzenegger film
"Collateral Damage," wireless ad firm SkyGo Inc. promoted a
four-digit code on billboards and movie posters. Fans who entered the
code through the text-messaging feature on their cell phones were
given information about the movie, show times and ticket prices, said
Daren Tsui, SkyGo's president.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. marketers are just beginning to experiment with wireless
coupons, text messaging and sweepstakes to get the attention of
consumers who use wireless devices.</TE>
<TE>   Although advertising on cell phones may seem like an ideal medium
to reach a captive market and provide personalized information, many
obstacles and unknowns have kept advertisers on the sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   Marketers always want to reach the widest audience possible, but
most cellular consumers have either basic digital phones or older
analog models that lack advanced features such as Internet access.</TE>
<TE>   For another thing, there just isn't much advertising real estate
to work with.</TE>
<TE>   The limited space on cellular handsets generally has meant that
most ads can consist only of text messages. The new phones for
high-speed "3G" networks promise to deliver color, video clips and
other messages.</TE>
<TE>   Companies recognize that with such limited space, they have to
deliver their messages in compact and cunning ways.</TE>
<TE>   A Manhattan-based company called Upoc has gained a lot of
attention for its idea of sending out "celebrity sighting" alerts to
fans as a way to create buzz without resorting to direct advertising.</TE>
<TE>   Upoc--partly owned by Tribune Co., parent of The Times--has
hundreds of such message groups, created by the company and users,
and about 250,000 subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   Entertainment companies have created Upoc groups to send text
messages with news and tour dates for music groups such as Destiny's
Child and information about movies such as the current re-release of
"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial."</TE>
<TE>   "When you asked people about it, they didn't consider it
marketing," said Greg Clayman, vice president of business development
at Upoc.</TE>
<TE>   Such innovative marketing campaigns have created an unusual
problem for mobile advertisers: No one is quite sure how to place a
value on mobile ads because it is not as easy as figuring out how to
charge for a 30-second TV spot based on ratings or a full-page
magazine ad based on readership.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still trying to come to an agreement on what a proper ad
unit should be," said Tim Hanlon, a vice president at Starcom
Worldwide, a unit of ad company Bcom3.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, cellular companies in the U.S. have been slow to open
their networks to mobile advertising. Although companies have created
the technology to deliver ads and promotions to cell phones, the
major carriers have taken ads only on a limited basis. The ESPN
wireless updates on the NCAA basketball tournament, for example, were
available only to AT&amp;T Wireless, Nextel and Sprint subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   But some of these restrictions are coming down. Most cellular
carriers are standardizing their so-called short messaging service so
their customers can send text messages to a customer of another
carrier.</TE>
<TE>   As mobile advertising forges ahead, carriers say they are being
careful not to spark a consumer backlash. Executives say that they
want to make sure privacy guidelines are set up and that controls are
in place to restrict "spam," or unsolicited junk messages.</TE>
<TE>   The downturn in the telecommunications sector has put spending for
experimental wireless products on hold, but marketers are hoping that
as the U.S. economy recovers, new promotions on wireless phones too
will evolve into a medium that consumers will accept.</TE>

<HD>Investors' Profit Taking Pulls Stocks Lower</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Nasdaq and Dow fall, unable to hold on to
Tuesday's big gains. Earnings reports leave buyers uninspired.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street couldn't muster a follow-up Wednesday to the previous
day's big rally as mixed earnings reports from Intel, Philip Morris,
Boeing and other blue chips left investors uninspired.</LD>
<LD>   The selling, coming a day after a 207-point gain in the Dow Jones
industrials and a 63-point surge in the Nasdaq composite index, was
the latest example of the market's inability to hold on to gains.
Instead of buying on expectations of stronger profits ahead,
investors pulled back and took profits.</LD>
<LD>   "The market is recognizing that it may take a couple of quarters
for earnings to really change," said Michael Strauss, managing
director and senior economist at Commonfund. "Although we're having a
lot of day-to-day volatility, on the longer scope the market is
really establishing a more sideways trading pattern as this all sorts
out."</LD>
<TE>   The Dow fell 80.54 points, or 0.8%, to 10,220.78. The tech-heavy
Nasdaq slipped 6.12 points, or 0.3%, to 1,810.67, while the Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 index fell 2.30 points, or 0.2%, to 1,126.07.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the market was narrowly mixed, with winners edging losers
by 17 to 15 on the New York Stock Exchange and decliners outnumbering
advancers by 19 to 17 on Nasdaq in active trading.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street started the session focused on Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony before Congress. Although the
chairman said the outlook for U.S. economy was improving and that the
Fed had no immediate plans to hike interest rates, his comments had
little effect on stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street focused instead on a mixed bag of earnings reports.</TE>
<TE>   Intel shares rose $1.13 to $30.64 on earnings released Tuesday
that met expectations despite disappointing revenue. The market was
pleased by stronger-than-expected microprocessor sales, although the
chip maker said it sees no evidence yet of a broad economic recovery.</TE>
<TE>   The gains were enough to spur more buying in semiconductor stocks,
some of which had turned in better-than-expected results. Texas
Instruments, which beat forecasts Monday, rose 26 cents to $34.05,
while Motorola, which also came in ahead of Wall Street estimates,
jumped $1.33 to $16.33.</TE>
<TE>   Blue chips were mixed. Boeing dropped $3.33 to $45.37 after
missing profit estimates due to weakness in its commercial satellite
operation and continuing fallout from the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Ford rose 32 cents to $16.18 on a narrower-than-expected loss and
indications the auto maker expects a strong year. Philip Morris slid
29 cents to $53.07 despite the tobacco maker beating earnings
estimates by a penny.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news:</TE>
<TE>   * After the closing bell, Dow heavyweight IBM reported its
sharpest drop in earnings since it emerged in 1993 from a string of
losses. But the computer maker said it would meet Wall Street's
full-year profit forecasts. After falling $1.39 to $84.81 during the
regular session, Big Blue rose to $86.48 in after-hours trading.</TE>
<TE>   * Oil stocks rose along with crude prices, which added $1.19 to
$25.94 a barrel on news of declines in U.S. crude stockpiles. The
Philadelphia oil services index rose 3% amid gains by such firms as
Schlumberger, up $1.14 to $56.04. Independent producer Apache added
$1.45 to $56.70.</TE>
<TE>   * Also posting solid gains were shares of gold mining companies,
rising in sympathy with a surprising rebound in bullion, which rose
$3.30 to $302.10 an ounce. The S&amp;P index of mining stocks rose 4.3%
as sector leader Newmont Mining gained 88 cents to $29.07.</TE>
<TE>   * The Bloomberg index of real estate investment trusts fell for a
third day, losing 1.4%. Among the losers: Prentiss Properties, down
91 cents to $31.05, and Equity Office Properties, down 54 cents to
$30.07.</TE>

<HD>Repairman's Hardware: Wrench, Pliers, Laptop</HD>
<DH>Workplace: Sears exemplifies the benefits of a mobilized
work force. It uses cell phones, portable PCs to improve efficiency,
save millions of dollars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA ROSE</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>BLOOMINGDALE, Ill.</DL>
<LD>Russ Molitor is asleep when a computer at a Sears product repair
center dials a laptop in his suburban Chicago home and sends his work
schedule for the day.</LD>
<LD>   By the time he finishes brewing coffee, the 30-year-old technician
for Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. has consulted the laptop for a color map of
the day's route and a list of customers.</LD>
<LD>   His first call is with a homeowner in Glen Ellyn who says her
dishwasher is "making noise." She plans to pay cash for the repair,
and she prefers that he enter by a side door. As Molitor heads out
his driveway, his laptop begins reading him driving directions.</LD>
<TE>   Although much of the buzz about mobile computing has focused on
consumer applications, such as buying movie tickets or making dinner
reservations on the go, mobile technology's biggest influence by far
has been inside corporations.</TE>
<TE>   Companies such as Sears are putting computers in the hands of
repairers not only to make them more efficient but also to streamline
and speed basic functions, such as billing, to save millions of
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "The technology, even though it's not perfect yet, is good enough
to drive very significant value," said Martin Dunsby, a partner at
Deloitte Consulting in Atlanta. "There are substantial paybacks even
on expensive systems."</TE>
<TE>   Sears' experience with mobile technology, starting in the early
1990s, illustrates how far "m-business" has evolved. Workers'
attitudes toward the new technologies have changed dramatically
through the years, and companies have rallied to the benefits of
having a mobilized work force.</TE>
<TE>   The retailer's HomeCentral operation says it is the largest
appliance repair firm in the country, with 13,000 technicians who
make 11 million in-home repairs a year.</TE>
<TE>   Sears won't disclose how much it has saved since it began
equipping service reps with laptops and cell phones in 1993, but it
says the payback has more than covered its investment.</TE>
<TE>   One easily quantifiable gain: Sears saves more than $3million
annually in the cost of telephone calls to order parts.</TE>
<TE>   Molitor is part of a pilot group testing Sears' newest wireless
systems, a $70-million investment in hardware and software that the
retailer expects to roll out to the rest of its technicians by next
year's first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The hardware includes sturdy laptops with color touch screens and
glow-in-the-dark keyboards by Itronix Corp., a Spokane, Wash.-based
maker of rugged mobile computers. Sears' service vans have been
converted into wireless network base stations using equipment
developed by Calgary, Canada-based Wireless Matrix Corp.</TE>
<TE>   A software team of 15 at Sears' headquarters in Hoffman Estates,
Ill., created applications that run on a Windows 2000 platform.</TE>
<TE>   Among the software improvements: a more powerful search engine
that can sift an inventory of 5million parts using descriptions
("dial" or "knob"), an image, product, brand or code number.</TE>
<TE>   Service reps can rotate images in schematic drawings or see a
blowup of a single part by running a finger around it on the laptop's
touch-screen, leaving the schematic displayed behind it.</TE>
<TE>   Sears expects a payback on the new technology in three years, a
timetable that Deloitte's Dunsby suggests may be conservative based
on his experience with similar projects.</TE>
<TE>   Molitor's assessment of the new technology: "It makes the job
easier." He likes the search tools and the global positioning
technology. "Ninety-five percent of the time the computer leads me
right to the customer's door," he said.</TE>
<TE>   All the information he needs to estimate repair costs, order
parts, fix appliances, bill customers and process payments is
available on his hard drive or via wireless networks that connect him
with Sears' computers around the country.</TE>
<TE>   Antennas hidden in a dome on the service van's roof connect the
van with a business data network operated by Cingular Wireless. When
Molitor is making a repair, his laptop communicates with the van over
a shorter-range wireless network.</TE>
<TE>   A 13-year Sears veteran, Molitor remembers a time when he started
his morning by driving to a service center to pick up a batch of work
orders, then sat down to figure out his route and call his customers.
At the end of the day, he drove back with his completed paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   "You basically shuffled your paper all day like a deck of cards,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction was lukewarm, at best, when Sears decided to remove the
paper by introducing cell phones and laptops to a work force that had
no experience with keyboards or computer mice.</TE>
<TE>   "The old guys were totally against it," Molitor said. "We buddied
them up with younger guys."</TE>
<TE>   But typically within about three months, he said, "if their
computer broke they were whining."</TE>
<TE>   The transition wasn't easy.</TE>
<TE>   "You were literally changing your culture overnight," said David
Sankey, Sears' director of process and technology for product repair
services. "There were a lot of people who needed a lot of help."</TE>
<TE>   There were technical hurdles as well.</TE>
<TE>   "There was really no mobile computing wireless business then,"
said project director Bill Miller, himself a veteran service rep.
"Nobody was writing software for a wireless platform. We had to bring
all the vendors together to create our own solution."</TE>
<TE>   Miller and others understood that the biggest benefit would come
from automating processes to reduce errors--a move that could bring
service reps closer to their holy grail: a single visit per repair.</TE>
<TE>   Today, computers in Sears' 80 product repair centers nationwide
map the most efficient routes and schedules for service reps based on
technicians' specialties, ZIP Codes, workloads and customer
preferences. Workloads are balanced to avoid overtime, and schedules
can be changed on the fly.</TE>
<TE>   Information is transmitted in real time from service reps' laptops
to routing offices. At night when phone rates are cheaper, the data
travel over phone lines to a payroll processing center in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   As service reps complete repairs, their laptops access information
offloaded via the routing offices from customer databases in
Columbus, Ohio; a parts database in Dallas; and financial accounting
and other systems at headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Customer files include records of previous service
calls--including handy alerts such as "mean dog in backyard"--and
warranty information.</TE>
<TE>   One of the areas of biggest improvement is electronic parts
ordering. Molitor recalls tying up customers' phones while he waited
on hold for Sears employees to hunt through catalogs for parts.</TE>
<TE>   Simply describing the part was once a challenge: A dishwasher can
have as many as 500.</TE>
<TE>   Now, if a laptop indicates a part is not available on a
technician's truck, the part is ordered automatically when a customer
receipt is printed from the service rep's laptop.</TE>
<TE>   "The shift in organizational mind-set is a big one," said
Deloitte's Dunsby. "Instead of the field service people being
completely dependent on the back office, now you're empowering them
to make decisions on behalf of the customers."</TE>

<HD>Struggling for a Slice of the Wireless Pie</HD>
<DH>Consumer services: Pizza-ordering system tested by
Domino's and Motorola highlights hurdles of m-commerce.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB KAISER</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You're hankering for a pizza and have a cell phone in hand. Why not
go online?</LD>
<LD>   That's the deal Motorola Inc. is pushing.</LD>
<LD>   The Schaumburg, Ill., cell phone giant, searching for ways to sell
more Internet-enabled handsets, has developed a "three-click" mobile
pizza ordering system for Web-enabled phones, which Domino's Pizza
tested last year in Las Vegas.</LD>
<TE>   Results from that trial show the wireless industry is set to
revolutionize the pizza delivery business. Or perhaps the findings
merit more study of the concept.</TE>
<TE>   The answer depends on whether you ask Motorola or Domino's.</TE>
<TE>   "This is easier than ordering over [a regular] phone, especially
repeat orders," said Tim Krauskopf, a vice president of Motorola's
Internet software and content group.</TE>
<TE>   "Ordering online is more difficult than picking up the phone,"
countered Matt Maguire, Domino's vice president for information
services.</TE>
<TE>   The differing responses highlight the hurdles purveyors of
"m-commerce," or mobile commerce, must leap before winning the hearts
of restaurant and retail executives, not to mention consumers.</TE>
<TE>   M-commerce, like its older cousin e-commerce, is expected to offer
companies a new sales channel that could transform how consumers get
information, entertainment and products, including pizza. Yet the
hype about how m-commerce can turn cell phones into electronic
wallets and let stores fire off instant messages to nearby shoppers
hasn't translated into changes in consumers' habits.</TE>
<TE>   And that's unlikely to happen any time soon.</TE>
<TE>   Wireless analysts said the most popular m-commerce offerings for
consumers in the U.S. during the next couple of years probably will
be downloadable games and ring tones.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives the consumer a chance to dip her toe in m-commerce
without diving in," said Adam Guy, a wireless analyst with Strategis
Group.</TE>
<TE>   More elaborate offerings will be constrained by outdated
infrastructure, conflicting standards, security concerns and device
limitations.</TE>
<TE>   "It's got to get to the point where the application is so easy
that people say, 'This is easier than dialing,'" said Adam Zawel, a
wireless analyst at Yankee Group in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   That's the challenge Motorola is taking on in the pizza business.</TE>
<TE>   Motorola wanted to develop a shopping "engine" that can be used
for various m-commerce applications.</TE>
<TE>   Krauskopf said the company decided to test its software in one
industry and settled on pizza because it is a $30-billion market,
already has strong telephone ties and includes many repeat orders.</TE>
<TE>   For pizza outlets, Krauskopf said, the concept clicks because it
cuts down on the number of employees needed to enter orders and
reduces errors in order entry.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the concept faces serious logistical issues.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest barrier from the consumer point of view, Krauskopf
said, is getting people to program their phones with their favorite
combinations of toppings, address and billing information, so they
can quickly enter repeat orders.</TE>
<TE>   Many pizzerias often present their own limitations, particularly
if they don't have computer-based ordering systems installed.</TE>
<TE>   In the test with Domino's, Motorola had to set up a simple version
of the ordering system for locations that didn't have the computer
systems. Users could see a menu and specials but still had to make a
call when they were ready to place an order.</TE>
<TE>   Many businesses still don't have Internet ordering systems.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Pizza Hut offers online ordering in only three
places: Columbus, Ohio; Kansas City, Mo.; and the Dallas-Fort Worth
area.</TE>
<TE>   Manish Patel, chairman and co-founder of Where2getit Inc. in
Northbrook, Ill., said that though his firm develops Internet
store-location search pages and maps for companies such as La-Z-Boy
Inc. and Reebok International Ltd., clients have expressed little
interest in building m-commerce capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   "At this stage, no one is really moving," Patel said.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean, though, that some companies aren't getting
ready.</TE>
<TE>   Donatos Pizzeria, which is owned by McDonald's Corp., has decided
to use Motorola's m-commerce offering.</TE>
<TE>   "We're probably a year away from really pushing it," said Tom
Krouse, senior vice president of marketing at Donatos. "Our hope is
it just grows on the front end of this wave."</TE>
<TE>   Donatos has drive-up windows where customers can pick up orders,
and Krouse expects the ability to click orders into cell phones will
be popular with people who use that service.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Donatos will have to clear technological hurdles before it
can offer the service in its 200 locations as well as get franchisees
on board with the concept.</TE>
<TE>   "The plan would be to make it available to all customers, but you
have to make sure that everybody is set up properly," Krouse said.</TE>
<TE>   Ensuring that the infrastructure works and then converting
customers to use the service take much more time than cranking out
pronouncements on the hype machine, a lesson well learned by
e-commerce pioneers.</TE>
<TE>   Domino's Maguire said every vendor who visits him asks how online
ordering has grown in recent years. He turns around the question,
asking whether they would order pizza online.</TE>
<TE>   "They start thinking about the logistics of it all, and they say
they would still call," Maguire said.</TE>

<HD>Games Anyone?</HD>
<DH>Entertainment firms, hearing the ring of cash registers,
offer compact fun to a huge market of cell phone users.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A large U.S. corporation recently handed down an unusual edict to its
employees: Stop bowling in the office.</LD>
<LD>   It seems that during staff meetings, too many workers were quietly
rolling animated bowling balls down virtual alleys on their cell
phones. That's one of the simple forms of amusement being ushered in
by a new generation of handsets that are equipped to entertain as
well as communicate.</LD>
<LD>   Cell phone users around the globe are or soon will be sampling
songs, watching soccer highlights, caring for electronic girlfriends
and fishing on virtual lakes. They might even pay a celebrity to
supply their voicemail greeting.</LD>
<TE>   Granted, a mobile phone is no one's first choice for music or
video. But close to a billion people carry one everywhere they go,
and that's why major entertainment companies are plotting ways to get
their products onto wireless networks.</TE>
<TE>   Those networks will need much more capacity before they'll be able
to deliver songs, TV programs or movies. So companies are focusing on
more compact forms of amusement that take advantage of the phones'
increasing power.</TE>
<TE>   Games are one example. The current generation of phones can dial
into the Internet and deliver rudimentary games such as Jamdat
Mobile's "Gladiator," in which players maneuver black-and-white icons
through a medieval kingdom and trade blows--slowly--with online
opponents.</TE>
<TE>   New phones for next-generation networks, such as the ones Verizon
and Sprint are deploying this spring and summer, can download games
such as Jamdat's "Bowling" so users don't need to connect to the Web
as they play. These games are still far simpler than what you'd find
on Nintendo or a computer, but they're more detailed, responsive and
instantly gratifying than the previous versions.</TE>
<TE>   The games typically rely on a phone's tiny up, down, left, right
and OK buttons to control the action. In the bowling game, for
example, players must click the OK button at just the right time to
set the optimum speed, direction and spin of the ball. Those three
elements determine the animated ball's path and how many pins it lays
low.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond games, companies are starting to work entertaining elements
into the basic functions of the phone, including its sounds, its
screens and the messages it sends.</TE>
<TE>   For example, New Line Cinema, a film distributor owned by AOL Time
Warner, offered downloadable "Lord of the Rings" theme music and
icons to VoiceStream phones last fall.</TE>
<TE>   "I have 'The Bridge at Khazad-dum Theme' as my ring tone," said
Gordon Paddison, a marketing executive at New Line. "People go, 'Oh
my God, where did you get that?' It's great because it's such a
recognizable tune."</TE>
<TE>   Nokia brought customizable ring tones to the European masses in
1998, and they've become wildly popular despite their cheesy beeps
and bleats. Who knows what will happen as sound quality improves, as
it will in many of the new phones?</TE>
<TE>   The next round of Nokia handsets, for example, includes software
from Beatnik Inc. that brings higher fidelity to ring tones, games
and multimedia messages. Those models and other phones also will have
the ability to download and play "song tones," or ring tones that are
snippets of actual songs.</TE>
<TE>   Moviso, a subsidiary of media conglomerate Vivendi Universal that
focuses on wireless services, plans to offer the first song tones
this summer. Shawn Conahan, Moviso's president, also is eager to
offer multimedia messaging services that use celebrated performers or
athletes to deliver customized tidbits of information.</TE>
<TE>   Sony already is developing a multimedia messaging service
featuring actors and scenes from the upcoming movie "XXX," said Rio
D. Caraeff, vice president of wireless services for Sony Pictures
Digital Entertainment. The company plans to announce deals soon with
several global wireless phone companies to offer mobile messaging and
games built around Sony films, he said.</TE>
<TE>   About half a billion phones today are equipped to handle messages
enhanced with pictures, and upward of 10 million will soon be able to
deliver messages with music and animation, said Adam Lavine, chief
executive of FunMail Inc. in Pleasanton, Calif. The FunMail service,
which is rolling out on several networks, automatically embellishes
messages with cartoon figures and graphics.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers in Japan may have access to the richest variety of
cell-phone-based entertainment. One example is the Love by Mail
virtual girlfriend service, which supplies users with a demanding
female cartoon figure.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, NTT DoCoMo, the dominant wireless phone company in
Japan, enabled customers with camera-equipped cell phones to snap and
send photos wirelessly--a service that attracted 20% of the
subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   P.J. McNealy, a senior analyst at research firm GartnerG2,
cautioned that DoCoMo's success with mobile entertainment may reflect
unique social factors not found in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "People [in Japan] spend two hours on the train every day, going
to and from work. Hand-helds are a main source of communications and
entertainment," McNealy said. For most U.S. workers, who drive to
work, "cell phone entertainment isn't exactly optimal."</TE>

<HD>Furor Over Canal Plus Firing Deepens</HD>
<DH>Media: A one-day strike is threatened and a regulator says
it may revoke company's right to broadcast in France.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>French governmental, cultural and business circles reverberated
Wednesday from the management upheaval at Vivendi Universal, spawning
a new round of street protests, political sparring and talk of
strikes against the nation's largest media conglomerate.</LD>
<LD>   French broadcast regulatory agency CSA threatened to yank Canal
Plus' right to broadcast in France, a day after Vivendi Chairman
Jean-Marie Messier's decision to ax the popular pay TV provider's
chairman, Pierre Lescure.</LD>
<LD>   CSA Chairman Dominique Baudis, who has requested a meeting with
senior Vivendi executives, cited a 1986 law on freedom of
communication that allows the suspension of TV broadcasting rights
without notice when there are substantial changes in the conditions
under which a broadcast license had been awarded.</LD>
<TE>   The move came at the behest of Socialist Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin, who was incensed over what has become known in France as
"L'affaire Lescure." Messier, once a darling of the French corporate
world, is now a whipping boy among politicians in the last days of a
presidential campaign.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,000 employees and subscribers of Canal Plus, some of whom
staged on-air protests Wednesday over the ouster, demonstrated in
front of Vivendi's headquarters at the Arc de Triomphe, throwing eggs
and shouting for Messier to resign.</TE>
<TE>   Union workers at Canal Plus are threatening to stage a one-day
strike on Wednesday, when Vivendi Universal will hold its
shareholders meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Lescure's ouster, which came four days after Canal Plus' No. 2
executive Denis Olivennes resigned, touched off the firestorm in
France, where Messier has been accused of betraying French culture to
American interests. Vivendi owns L.A.-based Universal Studios.</TE>
<TE>   Lescure is considered an icon in French movie and television
circles and has been at Canal Plus since it was founded in 1984.
Canal Plus is the French film industry's biggest financial backer,
producing such films as the recent hit "Amelie."</TE>
<TE>   The uproar continued to fuel speculation that Messier may be at
risk of losing his grip on the company.</TE>
<TE>   "We would say that a departure of Messier is not unlikely at this
stage, although we believe that such a move would be a risk for
Vivendi, given Messier controls the whole company's management," ABN
Amro analysts wrote in a note to clients Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The fallout has created a curious dynamic. Though Messier is being
lambasted in France, many analysts view his action at Canal Plus as a
necessary step to fix a money-losing division.</TE>
<TE>   Canal Plus posted a loss of $439million last year. The channel's
losses and management turmoil have been in stark contrast to Vivendi
Universal's music and film divisions. Universal Pictures last year
had a string of box-office hits, such as "The Mummy Returns" and
"American Pie 2."</TE>
<TE>   "The departure of Pierre Lescure is only the beginning of a very
long and uncertain restructuring program that needs to begin at Canal
Plus," said Mark Harrington, an analyst with J.P. Morgan Chase.</TE>
<TE>   The company's stock gained for the fourth consecutive day. On the
New York Stock Exchange, Vivendi's American depositary receipts
closed at $35.14, up 8 cents.</TE>
<TE>   But support from Wall Street hasn't translated in his homeland,
where Messier's action continued to create an uproar among French
politicians, movie makers and Canal Plus employees, who have been
stewing for months about a statement Messier made last year that
French cultural exception is dead and fear that Messier wants to back
out of Canal Plus. French cultural exception is the policy of using
government quotas and subsidies to support French cinema.</TE>
<TE>   "Cinema is a great part of French culture and is doing
particularly well at the moment, mainly due to [Canal Plus']
funding," Conservative President Jacques Chirac said on TF1
television. "It is essential that this contract is respected."</TE>
<TE>   In exchange for receiving the right to broadcast, Canal Plus is
required under French law to support French cinema. Canal Plus has
been involved in as much as 80% of French film productions.</TE>
<TE>   Messier said Canal Plus will respect its commitments for the
funding of French film industry and defended the management changes.</TE>
<TE>   "The departure of Pierre Lescure as chairman of Canal Plus Group
is not because of personal reasons," Messier said. "The decision was
taken purely on the basis of business considerations ... as Vivendi
Universal's role is not to continue to bankroll Canal Plus
indefinitely, vigorous strategic and operational measures need to be
taken."</TE>
<TE>   Lescure was officially fired by the board during a meeting of
Canal Plus directors at Vivendi headquarters Wednesday. The board
supported Messier's decision to ax Lescure in a 3-2 vote. Dissenters
included Jorge Semprun, a writer, and longtime Canal Plus union
representative Philippe Gildas. Semprun said Tuesday that he would
step down as vice president of the board if Lescure left.</TE>
<TE>   At Canal Plus, the airwaves continued to be filled with Messier
bashing. One of the channel's popular prime-time game shows, "Burger
Quiz," turned over the hour to Messier mockery.</TE>
<TE>   "We went live and had every star from Canal Plus and some big
French comedians on in the place of contestants," said Alex Berger,
Lescure's No. 2 lieutenant until late 2000, whose company produces
programs for the channel.</TE>
<TE>   Messier said Vivendi has filed a complaint to the CSA over
Lescure's use of Canal Plus to air his grievances.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to some European analysts who have suggested Vivendi
and Canal Plus part ways, Messier said Canal Plus' survival would be
threatened if it were not part of Vivendi.</TE>
<TE>   A company spokesman said Messier had a constructive meeting with
French board members Tuesday and would meet with the full board
before the shareholders meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Canal Plus has 15 million subscribers, including 4 million in
France, making it Europe's largest pay TV operator.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi acquired the company along with Universal Studios parent
Seagram Co. 18 months ago with the expectation that it would it
become a key pipeline for Universal's movies, music and games.</TE>
<TE>   But Messier's strategy has met with skepticism among U.S.
investors, who have driven down the stock price by 35% this year.</TE>

<HD>Feeling Disconnected in the Wireless World</HD>
<DH>A cutting-edge hand-held's features and glitches put one
user in overload. Beam him back to the real world.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I am mobile man, Homo mobilis.</LD>
<LD>   The promise of the wireless age is the ability to be in touch any
time, anyplace. The ultimate expression of that promise so far is
Handspring Inc.'s Treo, which combines a telephone, text messenger,
e-mailer, Web browser and personal digital assistant in a single unit
not much bigger than a traditional electronic organizer.</LD>
<LD>   Now if only I could get it to work.</LD>
<TE>   After a week toting Treo, this conclusion: The wireless world is
nigh, but it still has a few bugs to work out. And do we really want
to live in it anyway?</TE>
<TE>   To begin with, one must endure a world of pain just to pass the
threshold of the mobile revolution.</TE>
<TE>   By pain, I mean at least $399 worth to start. That's what it costs
to buy the Treo. Make that $599 if you don't purchase a yearlong
wireless plan.</TE>
<TE>   Having recovered from sticker shock, I again prepared to stride
into the mobile revolution. As an experienced user of computers and
hand-held devices, I was confident I would have no problem learning
this new device. Some of its features--the PDA, outgoing phone
calls--worked right out of the box.</TE>
<TE>   But getting other features to work--incoming calls, e-mail,
messenger, Web browser--required yet another journey. This time, I
wandered aimlessly amid mysterious instructions, wrong instructions,
nonfunctioning components, multiple passwords and endless calls to
technical support.</TE>
<TE>   "Your call is very important to us ... ."</TE>
<TE>   The problems began with incoming calls--I couldn't get them unless
initiated from another Treo. Anyone calling the Treo on a regular
telephone got messages that the number had been disconnected.</TE>
<TE>   I also was not able to receive text messages--except, again, from
another Treo--or e-mail. Handspring and Cingular wireless service
technicians both said they had never seen that problem before.</TE>
<TE>   It was not the last time I would hear that line. It was slowly
dawning on me that one of the really beautiful things about the
mobile revolution was that support people stay in one place.</TE>
<TE>   A replacement chip gave the Treo a new phone number. It could then
get incoming calls but no longer sync with my desktop computer. A
Handspring tech support person directed me to give the device a "hard
reset" (the PDA verison of reboot), and that fixed it.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most alluring aspects of becoming a mobile man was the
possibility of picking up my regular e-mail while away from my
desktop computer. The Treo was equipped with a program called Treo
Mail. The program was in beta, which has its good and bad qualities.</TE>
<TE>   The good news was that it was free--when out of beta, Treo Mail
will cost about $10 a month for those who send or receive up to 20
e-mails a day. The bad was that it didn't work on my company's e-mail
system. After a long phone session with a Handspring technician, he
thanked me for pinpointing a new problem. It was the least I could
do.</TE>
<TE>   Treo Mail worked on my home e-mail account. Unfortunately, my
house is a cellular dead zone, so every time I try a mobile feature I
have to walk a couple blocks and stand under a street light. This was
not exactly the mobility I had in mind when I embarked.</TE>
<TE>   But in the midst of all this frustration, I had to admit that the
thought of having all this mobile power in my hand was alluring. Out
of the box, the Treo was the coolest thing going, imbuing me with an
aura of tech hipness that no mere laptop or cellular phone could come
close to.</TE>
<TE>   The Treo's flip-up cover elicited comparisons to "Star Trek"
communicators. Colleagues wandered the halls, shouting into it, "Beam
me up," or Scotty's immortal, "Captain, we're losing power in the
warp engines!"</TE>
<TE>   With most of the functions up and running, I was ready to take
Treo on the road. The PDA, which uses the Palm operating system, does
not have the normal Palm handwriting recognition pad. That was a
plus. I found it much easier to enter info with the thumb keyboard.</TE>
<TE>   I picked the most serene urban spot I know--a Japanese garden
blocks from the office--to send my thoughts via short message service
for mobile phones to the world. Outgoing worked well, though with
delays of up to 90 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Incoming messages were best when short; after only about 20 words,
they broke into separate takes, which could be confusing. Also, some
messages arrived with no identification of the sender.</TE>
<TE>   The transfer of home e-mail was hit or miss. Because of storage
limitations, I was able to get only two or three messages at a time.
Of course junk e-mail came in with everything else. I was especially
glad to have my Treo provide me with an offer to buy a Kmart stock
certificate as a "valuable collectible."</TE>
<TE>   But no matter. I was already in digital overload. Even with
letting phone calls go into answering machine mode, the loveliness of
the garden was lost in the waves of messages I was sending and
receiving.</TE>
<TE>   I was getting caught up in the novelty/nightmare of always being
in touch, whether by voice or text. It was getting to the point that
while walking down the street, I had all my attention on the keyboard
and screen. A truck barreling down an alley could have taken me out,
and goodness knows how many pedestrians had to step around me in fear
or anger.</TE>
<TE>   The Web browser didn't work as it was supposed to, but that was
probably a good thing. It was just something else to stare at as I
walked, head down, through the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of connecting me to the world, Treo was cutting me off
from it. I was narrowing my scope to phone calls, e-mails and
messages to colleagues typed on a tiny keyboard. There was little
chance for surprise or serendipity, even in a garden or on a bustling
street that featured not one chain store.</TE>
<TE>   A convenient, all-in-one device for keeping in touch is
alluring--especially after the price comes down--but reaching out and
touching someone means more than being on a phone in a restaurant,
sending messages at a concert or downloading e-mail at the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Call me Homo grumpius. Mobile man just wanted to go home to his
cell-free zone.</TE>

<HD>Mobile technology, with its promise of allowing users to
work, play and shop any time, anywhere, is poised to lift off.</HD>
<DH>Hurdle: The industry faces the daunting challenge of
persuading Americans to hang up their lowly telephone modems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM COATES</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a strong whiff of the same old, same old wafting through the
wireless world.</LD>
<LD>   Billions of dollars are being spent to roll out networks and
devices designed to foster a mobile revolution. They use high-speed
radio technologies with names such as 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and
ultrawide band.</LD>
<LD>   Think of it as a marriage of the cell phone and the cable modem: a
new generation of wireless hand-held devices such as the familiar
Palms but capable of high-speed Internet features such as video
e-mail, music and blazing file transfers from any place on Earth to
any other place you happen to roam.</LD>
<TE>   But what a bitter ring of familiarity it has, this talk about a
third generation of mobile phones and allied devices that access the
Internet without wires.</TE>
<TE>   It hardly differs from the hype that fueled the first rush to get
high-speed connections to home and office computers for e-commerce.
That crusade to connect America to broadband lasted maybe four years
before stumbling last year.</TE>
<TE>   It's a bit premature to start passing out the party hats and
confetti for the great revolution that wireless evangelists say
awaits.</TE>
<TE>   The question is: Can wireless somehow bring about the miracle that
far-faster fiber-optic lines failed to produce?</TE>
<TE>   Marketers have rushed to push anything that contains the "m" word,
"mobile." But it's hard to forget that the last tech frenzy left us
with an incredibly powerful global fiber-optic network that remains
more than 90% unused.</TE>
<TE>   All that dark fiber swallowed the hopes of companies such as Cisco
Systems Inc., Nortel Networks Corp., Lucent Technologies Inc., AT&amp;T
Corp. and 3Com Corp. that now are gasping for air.</TE>
<TE>   These companies stand to gain greatly--maybe even rebound to prior
glory--if the world embraces all the new mobile devices that soon
will pour onto the market.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't all disaster, of course.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Internet meltdown blitzed the bulk of the dot-coms,
e-commerce today is almost commonplace.</TE>
<TE>   There is an important e-lesson here: Those selling the dream of
using mobile phones or personal digital assistants to connect to the
Net should remember and respect the lowly telephone modem.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the majority of American Internet users remain content to
dial up from their homes using roughly the same technology that
existed when the information revolution began.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, 88% of Americans accessing the Internet do so from
conventional dial-up modems using connection speeds of 56 kilobits
per second or slower. Only 12% of online Americans use cable modems,
digital subscriber lines or other high-speed connections, according
to the latest studies from the Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation, a
Washington-based technology policy think tank.</TE>
<TE>   Internet service providers that use cable modems such as
Princeton, N.J.-based RCN Corp. and AT&amp;T Broadband are struggling to
support existing customers and find new ones.</TE>
<TE>   Those selling the dream of third-generation high-speed wireless
access, or 3G, must convince the world that people who don't seem to
want high speed in the comfort of their own homes will want it on
their mobile phones.</TE>
<TE>   But many of those who have experienced the excitement of the new
wireless world are eager to embrace it. Consumers are buying mobile
devices, such as the recently introduced Samsung SPH-I300 and the
Handspring Treo, which combine a PDA with a cell phone. Businesses
are adding wireless networks that can provide Internet access at
airports, hotels and college campuses.</TE>
<TE>   There is much to admire about the head-spinning array of clever
wireless technologies. It is, after all, an engineering triumph to
build systems that can slice and dice radio transmissions and create
a 2-ounce telephone that carries moving pictures as effectively as a
40-pound television set.</TE>
<TE>   Most likely, a 3G phone will always be on, just like a PC with a
broadband connection. Link them with the new global positioning
satellite radios, and employers suddenly know where each worker is at
any given time.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it's a cab service coordinating pickups, emergency
operators dispatching police squad cars or a sales manager tracking
order takers, 3G has huge new powers. Such gadgets will tell worried
parents where their children are or how far a commuting spouse is
from the front door.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Americans will learn to use a new palette of technology
tools, such as sending a digital picture on 3G phones without making
a full-fledged call.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe we'll just do what we did when the miracle of fiber-optic
broadband was poised to change our world. Maybe we'll just stay at
home, content to play with our trusty old 1G analog telephone modems.</TE>

<HD>Keeping Lines of Communication Open Is Hard When Overseas</HD>
<DH>Travel: Executives, faced with few roaming agreements or
uniform technologies, combine tools to connect.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFERY D. ZBAR</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alan Reiter recently spent four digitally disconnected days in Sao
Paulo, Brazil.</LD>
<LD>   Although he owns a BlackBerry 957 e-mail device, Reiter found
himself cut off from electronic messaging, 5,000 miles from his Chevy
Chase, Md., office. BlackBerry has no service in Brazil.</LD>
<LD>   Staying digitally connected is tough for world travelers, said
Reiter, president of technology consulting firm Wireless Internet &amp;
Mobile Computing. "You really have problems."</LD>
<TE>   As the business world becomes digitized, access to crucial data
often gets severed when executives travel abroad. Wireless Internet
connections are hard to make because of different communication
technologies around the world and the lack of roaming agreements
between wireless service providers and the cellular companies whose
networks carry their content.</TE>
<TE>   About 70% of the world uses the GSM, or global system for mobile
communication, standard for cellular phone networks. Not the United
States, said Tony Carter, a spokesman for Cingular Wireless in
Atlanta. Cingular, for example, serves only California, Nevada and
parts of the Southeast with GSM--or less than 30% of the company's
market area, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The technology conflicts have made some of the most popular U.S.
devices useless overseas. Research in Motion has separate U.S. and
European networks for its BlackBerry hand-held. Only the company's
new 5820 international wireless digital and phone device receives
e-mail forwarded to the user in Europe from a server in the United
States, a spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   Connections slowly are being made. Users of the Handspring Treo
180 communicator can access their data if their cellular providers
have international roaming agreements. Connections can be made for
e-mail, SMS (short message service for mobile phones) and wireless
Web, depending on the country.</TE>
<TE>   Some companies combine tools to create connections. When Tim
Roper, senior director of business development with Palm Inc. in
Santa Clara, Calif., travels to London, he slips a Bluetooth
networking card into his Palm M515. The card enabled Roper's Palm to
use his Bluetooth-equipped Sony Ericsson T68 GPRS mobile phone to
make an Internet connection and check e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   His phone can get network coverage because his carrier, Cingular,
has roaming agreements throughout Hong Kong, Singapore, Europe and
some parts of Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just like I'm on an Internet terminal somewhere," Roper
said. The cost? About $399 for the M515, $129 for the Bluetooth card
and $199 for the T68 phone plus his air time and roaming costs.</TE>
<TE>   As for Reiter, he has a game plan for his four yearly visits to
London. He uses a $300 British cell phone, the Virgin Mobile prepaid
wireless telephone and e-mail device. Reiter spends about $15 a year
in prepaid minutes for wireless Web access and e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   Because it's a short message service, the Virgin phone will
download only the first 200 characters or so of a message, Reiter
said. But it's better than when he's in Asia or Latin America and
he's totally disconnected.</TE>
<TE>   Other solutions include world phones, which use a combination of
frequency bands to access wireless networks in many international
markets. Satellite phones use orbiting satellites to make
connections. Both are expensive, with phones starting at $900 and
service running from $1 to $2 a minute.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, digital convergence is supposed to deliver the full
range of wireless services to one device that can be transported
anywhere--and still work.</TE>
<TE>   Until more international roaming agreements are forged, and
technology becomes more uniform globally, world travelers can expect
continued missed messages, said Malcolm Spicer, editor for wireless
technology at PBI Media in Potomac, Md.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, travelers should call their digital provider
before departing to see what countries have such agreements, Spicer
said. Other options? Check with airlines or go online to see if
airports have vendors that rent wireless data devices.</TE>

<LD>This year's roll-out of high-speed wireless networks has opened a
host of new possibilities for working, playing and shopping on the
go. Companies have hyped this technology for years, and now they are
betting that Americans finally will begin using their cell phones,
hand-held computers and other devices to jump on the mobile
bandwagon. It's a movement that aims to replace the letter "e" in the
technology vernacular with the letter "m." For more, see Technology,

<HD>These Nets Have Security Holes</HD>
<DH>Safeguards: Hackers can easily break into many networks.
Experts advise the use of common sense.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They call it "war driving." Hackers plug an antenna into a laptop
computer, jump into a car, and then the fun begins. They easily break
into wireless computer networks, which often spew unencrypted
information into the airwaves for anyone to pick up.</LD>
<LD>   "There are two kinds of people doing wireless security assessments
in Silicon Valley: people like me, and the 19-year-old kids who do it
for sport," said Jonas Luster, president of D-fensive Networks Inc.,
a Campbell, Calif., security consulting firm.</LD>
<LD>   During a recent security audit in a Silicon Valley parking lot,
Luster's electronic "sniffer" detected 169 wireless networks using
the most popular standard, known as "Wi-Fi." Just six had any form of
security.</LD>
<TE>   The experience with Wi-Fi is just the tip of the iceberg. The
coming of so-called 3G wireless networks, which will allow cell
phones and hand-held computers to access the Internet at high speeds,
is creating a new realm of vulnerabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Though wireless networks differ in their strengths and
vulnerabilities, none escapes the fact that they transmit information
through the air and are designed to traverse the infamously insecure
expanses of the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Despite such concerns, the push for wireless convenience, mobility
and commerce is racing ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, about 7.5 million devices were sold that connect
personal computers, laptops and hand-held computers to Wi-Fi
networks, which dominate the home and business markets, according to
market research firm Allied Business Intelligence. Research firm
EMarketer Inc. forecasts that by 2004, 63 million people in the U.S.
will be connecting to the Internet by using cell phones or personal
digital assistants.</TE>
<TE>   Businesspeople use Wi-Fi to view documents from distant conference
rooms. Forklift drivers use wireless hand-helds to monitor inventory
in warehouses.</TE>
<TE>   Shoppers browse Amazon.com or answer e-mail over wireless links
while sipping a cafe latte at Starbucks. The coffee chain has
equipped hundreds of outlets with Wi-Fi, and many other restaurants
and airports have done likewise.</TE>
<TE>   That mobility comes at a price.</TE>
<TE>   During an audit for a Silicon Valley company, "we picked up
signals from a nearby hospital," Luster said. "It was a large amount
of patient data, completely in clear text," meaning the information
was not scrambled or encrypted.</TE>
<TE>   "We approached this hospital, and I offered to [plug the gap] for
free," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital refused to talk to him, Luster said.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been an admission of a problem, and people don't
want to do that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On another occasion, he stumbled across a Nevada casino that was
broadcasting unencrypted details of its security operations.</TE>
<TE>   Call it the "if I can't see it, it can't hurt me" effect.
Computer-savvy businesses take at least basic steps to protect wired
networks, such as using anti-virus programs and installing software
"firewalls" to block hackers.</TE>
<TE>   Yet unwired vigilance is rare. Wi-Fi security is among the most
leaky in the wireless world, and because its nodes often connect to
standard networks, they can expose all manner of company secrets.</TE>
<TE>   The root of the problem, experts said, is the same one that has
plagued standard computer networks for decades. Wi-Fi was designed
for convenience and economy, not security.</TE>
<TE>   Default Wi-Fi security settings are next to useless. Few users
bother to learn about advanced settings for wired equivalent privacy,
or WEP, which is built into Wi-Fi devices. Manufacturers don't ship
products with the most secure settings turned on because that causes
conflicts with Wi-Fi products from other vendors.</TE>
<TE>   WEP is meant to encrypt data traveling over the airwaves and patch
holes in company networks through wireless access points, or hubs.
But even when set up properly, WEP provides weak protection on both
fronts. Hacking software called AirSnort and WEPCrack, freely
available online, allow even inexperienced hackers to obtain WEP's
encryption "key" to unscramble airborne text.</TE>
<TE>   Ease of use has led to another big problem: "rogue" access points.
A multitude of technically savvy but careless employees set up ad hoc
wireless connections to their company networks.</TE>
<TE>   "Companies say, 'We don't need wireless security because we don't
have a wireless network,'" said Christopher W. Klaus, chief
technology officer of Internet Security Systems Inc., an
Atlanta-based security company. "But just sniffing around their
office, we find four or five access points."</TE>
<TE>   Large businesses can install virtual private networks, which block
hackers fairly reliably. But that solution can be prohibitively
costly and complex.</TE>
<TE>   Experts advise common sense: Turn on WEP to deter casual
eavesdroppers, and shut down rogue hubs.</TE>
<TE>   They also urge caution in setting up authorized hubs. Wi-Fi is
meant to broadcast only 150 feet, effectively within one building.
But if hubs are set inside windows on the building's periphery--where
no walls impede signal strength--networks become open to remote
hackers, Klaus said.</TE>
<TE>   He has picked up Wi-Fi signals six miles from a network access
point. Bad guys do the same, using a popular hacking tool, a Pringles
potato chip can, as the antenna.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Wi-Fi security should improve as new standards upgrade
WEP over the next couple of years. The first of these, called 802.1x,
will be finalized within a couple of months. It changes the WEP
encryption keys about every five minutes, rendering common hacking
tools ineffective.</TE>
<TE>   As consumers adopt high-speed 3G cellular phones, they may want to
consider Wi-Fi's cautionary tale.</TE>
<TE>   The 3G networks will fix voice encryption problems that make many
of today's cell phones easy to tap. But 3G mobile commerce will
require interaction with Web sites and networks whose security may
not be so reliable. Such glitches have plagued PC-based e-commerce
from its inception.</TE>
<TE>   "3G services will all be insecure," said Bruce Schneier, a
cryptographer and chief technology officer of Counterpane Internet
Security Inc. in Cupertino, Calif. "We'll be patching it up as we
go."</TE>

<HD>Warming to Wi-Fi</HD>
<DH>The network technology is so inexpensive and easy to set up
that it has sparked a kind of populist movement. 'Hot spots' are
sprouting all over.</DH>

<AU>JON VAN</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cell phone executives hype the arrival of their new "3G" networks,
but a lowly technology from the computer world has been steadily
gaining converts as an alternative path to the nirvana of high-speed
mobile access to the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   The technology is known as "Wi-Fi," and it's the most popular
method of creating wireless networks in homes and businesses. For a
few hundred dollars, anyone can pick up the gear at a local computer
store and have a network running in a few hours.</LD>
<LD>   Although cellular carriers are spending billions to build their
high-speed nationwide networks, Wi-Fi adherents point out that their
off-the-shelf technology is faster, cheaper and easier. But there's
one important caveat: Its range is only about 150 feet.</LD>
<TE>   That might seem like a fatal flaw for a technology vying for a
piece of the wireless revolution--a movement built on the promise of
ubiquitous high-speed Web access that works whether you're sitting in
an easy chair or on a bullet train.</TE>
<TE>   But as the revolution has gathered steam, the industry has begun
to realize that the nationwide reach of 3G networks is not really
necessary for everyone. What's important is to be able to connect in
a few key locations: home, office, airport, hotel and--why not?--the
coffee shop.</TE>
<TE>   Business campuses are embracing Wi-Fi networks, and even retailers
are installing local systems for customers' use while they shop. In
many urban areas, computer buffs can move from one Wi-Fi "hot spot"
to another, keeping their Web connectivity as they go.</TE>
<TE>   "You can go to airports and other hot spots and be amazed at the
performance," said Adam Sewall, the former chief executive of
wireless gear maker Spectrum Wireless Inc., who now works at
ComVentures, a venture capital firm in Palo Alto, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Even wireless carriers forging ahead with their "third-generation"
plans are waking up to the benefits of including Wi-Fi hot spots as
part of their national networks--not as a replacement but as a
supplement.</TE>
<TE>   At least two wireless carriers, VoiceStream and Sprint PCS,
already have invested in Wi-Fi firms. Most others have deals in the
works.</TE>
<TE>   Wi-Fi, short for "wireless fidelity" and also known by the techie
moniker 802.11b, is the wireless version of the common ethernet
networks that link computers in homes and corporate offices. The
original selling point of Wi-Fi when it was introduced several years
ago was that it eliminated the need to snake miles of wires
throughout a building.</TE>
<TE>   The earliest version of wireless ethernet transmitted information
at about 1 megabit per second--not particularly fast compared with
the 100-megabits-per-second speeds of wired ethernet. Today, Wi-Fi
transmits information at a respectable 11 megabits per second, and a
recently adopted standard, 802.11a, will bump speeds up to 54
megabits per second.</TE>
<TE>   Wi-Fi still isn't up to wired speeds but runs rings around 3G
wireless technology. The advanced wireless networks that carriers
such as Verizon Wireless Inc., AT&amp;T Wireless Services Inc. and Sprint
PCS Group Inc. are bringing out this year deliver speeds of 60 to 120
kilobits per second.</TE>
<TE>   Wi-Fi is so cheap and easy to set up that it has sparked a kind of
populist movement. Wireless hot spots are popping up in all sorts of
places, creating a pseudo sense of ubiquity in some densely populated
urban areas.</TE>
<TE>   But in the suburbs, countryside or even big buildings, Wi-Fi
begins to lose its luster.</TE>
<TE>   Russ Intravartolo, chief executive of StarNet Inc., an Internet
service provider based in Palatine, Ill., said his firm is expanding
its wireless high-speed Internet service to customers in Chicago's
northwestern suburbs. StarNet recently began using Wi-Fi to put
wireless LANs, or local area networks, into apartment complexes and
discovered the difficulties inherent in the technology.</TE>
<TE>   "Bringing in the signal into a development and then distributing
it to everyone can be a struggle," he said. "We have this 14-story
condo where we're trying to serve the residents with a wireless LAN,
but we find it won't work from one floor to the other.... Even when
you install a wireless LAN for one floor, it may not propagate
everywhere you want to reach."</TE>
<TE>   These difficulties with Wi-Fi's low-powered radio technology
probably will ensure that the higher-powered signals of 3G will find
a significant mass market, said Annabel Z. Dodd, author of "The
Essential Guide to Telecommunications."</TE>
<TE>   "In the end, I'd say Wi-Fi is complementary to 3G wireless," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   A San Diego bus that marries 3G and Wi-Fi may provide a glimpse of
this hybrid future.</TE>
<TE>   Operating on the campus of UC San Diego, the bus is connected to
the Internet via an advanced 3G network providing speeds of 2.4
megabits per second. Riders on the Cybershuttle access that network
through a standard Wi-Fi network set up inside the bus, which is
essentially a rolling hot spot.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a mobile version of a cable modem," said Ramesh Rao,
director of UCSD's advanced Internet division.</TE>
<TE>   Although it has many advantages, Wi-Fi could become a victim of
its own success. It uses unlicensed segments of radio spectrum that
are shared by many sorts of devices, including some kinds of cordless
phones.</TE>
<TE>   More applications for the same spectrum are in the works, said
Roger Marks, who chairs a standards committee for the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many products that want into the band that there are
a lot of concerns about the coexistence problem," Marks said. "It's
hard because no one has a clear answer. There's always a scenario how
these things can interfere with each other and scenarios where they
don't.... But no one knows for sure."</TE>

<DH>Technology: Telecom firms race to install next-generation
wireless networks that will enable 'the next big thing' to flourish.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After several years of false starts, the grand hopes for mobile
commerce in 2002 rest in no small part on the slender shoulders of
Adirem Quintel.</LD>
<LD>   The 25-year-old field technician for Nortel Networks Corp. is part
of an army of thousands of workers who are quietly yet methodically
visiting cellular towers across the nation and upgrading them for a
new generation of faster wireless networks.</LD>
<LD>   Quintel typically visits two or three of them a night, each time
installing a sophisticated piece of digital switching equipment for
Verizon Wireless Inc. that allows cell phones, two-way pagers and
hand-held computers to transmit data as fast as desktop PCs with
dial-up connections to the Internet.</LD>
<TE>   Wireless carriers expect to have their next-generation wireless
networks turned on in the country's major metropolitan areas by
year-end. Verizon has launched its Express Network in Salt Lake City,
the San Francisco Bay Area and the Northeast corridor connecting
Boston, New York and Washington. Sprint PCS Group Inc. plans to
switch on its entire nationwide high-speed network this summer.
Cingular Wireless, AT&amp;T Wireless Services Inc. and others are going
forward with new networks as well.</TE>
<TE>   All of them are betting that the new technology finally will
entice Americans to use their cell phones, hand-held computers and
other mobile devices to shop and conduct business--a trend that is
supplanting the letter "e" in the technology vernacular with the
letter "m."</TE>
<TE>   "The potential for m-commerce is directly related to the roll-out
of these networks," said Ben Macklin, a senior analyst at EMarketer
Inc., a market research firm based in New York. "It provides
consumers with a much more compelling type of offering."</TE>
<TE>   Already a hit in parts of Asia and Europe, mobile computing has
long been anticipated as the next big thing for the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   For corporate America, so-called m-business promises to help
companies streamline their operations and increase efficiency by
allowing workers to conduct business without being tethered to the
office. It will allow real estate agents to access listings from the
road and enable insurance adjusters to process claims without
returning to the office.</TE>
<TE>   For consumers, m-commerce offers the tantalizing prospect of
shopping for books, baseball tickets or other items on portable
gadgets while commuting on the subway or standing in line at the post
office. They will be able to exchange electronic greeting cards on
their cell phones, place bets on racehorses using two-way pagers and
download video games to their personal digital assistants.</TE>
<TE>   Forecasters at New York market research firm Jupiter Media Metrix
predict that by 2005, $22.2 billion worth of goods and services will
be purchased on mobile devices worldwide. Businesses and consumers in
Asia are on track to spend $2.6 billion on m-commerce this year, and
their counterparts in Europe are expected to ring up $500 million in
sales by Dec. 31.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, otherwise indulgent North Americans are projected to
spend a paltry $100 million using their mobile devices in 2002. But
analysts expect those spending habits to change once the faster
wireless networks come online.</TE>
<TE>   The new networks--generally called "3G" because they represent the
third generation of wireless technology--will enable new forms of
m-services, m-entertainment and, of course, m-advertising that are
far more appealing than the offerings available in the U.S. today.</TE>
<TE>   Stock trades from wireless PDAs are slow, and Web sites redesigned
for tiny cell phone screens are cumbersome to navigate with only
about a dozen keys on the number pad. As a result, less than 2% of
Americans whose phones are equipped with Web browsers use them for
mobile commerce, said Dylan Brooks, Jupiter's senior wireless
analyst.</TE>
<TE>   "That points to the lack of a compelling experience," he said. "A
fairly large number of people have used their phones to do something,
but the actual user experience isn't such that it really ropes people
in."</TE>
<TE>   Whether that will change depends on a variety of factors,
including the development of new-fangled devices with bigger screens,
improvements in voice recognition technology that will eliminate the
need to type on miniature keypads, and the emergence of new
applications that will entice users to open their wallets.</TE>
<TE>   But after several false starts, analysts now believe the most
critical factor for the U.S. is the roll-out of 3G networks.</TE>
<TE>   "I liken it to the automobile: You had to have roads before you
could have a car," said Ken Hyers, senior analyst in the mobile
carrier services group at Cahners In-Stat/MDR, a Newton, Mass.,
consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   And that's where Quintel comes in. For the last three months, she
has been spending her nights cruising around Southern California in
her black sport utility vehicle visiting Verizon cell sites. The
essential piece of equipment that brings them onto the company's 3G
network is a channel element module, a metal box about the size of a
coffee table book that converts calls from the digital wireless
network into signals that can be carried on the traditional phone
network and vice versa.</TE>
<TE>   Each box can handle at least twice as many voice calls as the one
it replaces, or it can boost voice capacity while ferrying data at
speeds of 40 to 60 kilobits per second, about three to four times as
fast as current wireless technology allows.</TE>
<TE>   Quintel can swap the equipment in less than 20 minutes and can
usually do two or three upgrades a night. And Verizon has well over
1,000 sites to upgrade just in Southern California before it can turn
on its network here next month.</TE>
<TE>   All the major wireless carriers are upgrading their networks to
accommodate high-speed data transmissions. Though they employ
different technologies, the networks all handle more calls by taking
advantage of faster processors inside phones and cell sites. They
also use compression technology and more efficient coding algorithms
to squeeze more calls onto their networks at once.</TE>
<TE>   As the networks come on line, analysts say business users will be
the first to benefit from the increased speed. The flood of data will
be most useful for people using wireless networking cards to connect
to corporate networks and the Internet on their laptops and PDAs.</TE>
<TE>   Businesses also are more willing to pay the higher prices that
carriers will charge for 3G services, said Cahners analyst Hyers.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers will follow in the next 12 to 18 months, although they
may never embrace m-commerce as enthusiastically as their
counterparts in Asia and Europe, analysts said. People there spend
more time commuting on trains, where their hands are free to play
with wireless gadgets, but Americans pass their commutes behind the
wheel.</TE>
<TE>   Americans also are spoiled by the fast Internet connections they
can get with desktop PCs, which display the Web on large, full-color
screens.</TE>
<TE>   "The ease of doing things online with a PC and the richer
experience there [are] baked into the psyche of a lot of online
consumers," said Jupiter's Brooks. "The idea that they'll replace
that activity with wireless is probably a nonstarter."</TE>
<TE>   Although mobile computing may never supplant desktop computing,
analysts still believe that m-commerce and m-business activities
eventually will become an important part of the technology spectrum.
The first big step is 3G.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, you saw a gazillion people try to develop applications
and the network wasn't really there to support them," Hyers said.
"With the new networks coming out, we will see a lot of people trying
to do it again. That's what's going to make the difference."</TE>

<HD>White House Rejects SEC Budget Request to Boost Worker Pay</HD>
<DH>Agency: Chairman Harvey Pitt says more money and staffers
are needed to deal with rising workload.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NEIL ROLAND</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The White House's Office of Management and Budget is rejecting
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt's request for
an additional $76 million in fiscal 2003 to increase SEC employee pay
to levels of other federal staff, Pitt said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Pitt has been trying to get more money for the SEC amid a surge in
agency accounting probes launched since Enron Corp. failed. Under a
House bill, the SEC also would be responsible for setting up and
monitoring a new accounting-industry oversight panel.</LD>
<LD>   Many in Congress are sympathetic to Pitt's efforts to boost the
SEC's budget. At a hearing Wednesday, Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.),
chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on commerce,
offered to intercede with the Office of Management and Budget to get
Pitt the money he wants.</LD>
<TE>   "Your budget is so small," Wolf told Pitt. "To establish
credibility and confidence in the markets is so important."</TE>
<TE>   President Bush requested a 6.6% increase in the SEC's budget, to
$467 million, in the next fiscal year. The House Financial Services
Committee last week authorized a 77% increase, to $776 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has offered Pitt some additional funding:
The administration recently approved $20 million to fund 100 new
positions at the agency.</TE>
<TE>   But Pitt said the SEC probably needs more than 100 new staffers to
deal with its rising workload.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC almost tripled its number of financial fraud
investigations in the first two months of this year in response to an
outpouring of tips and complaints. SEC staff also is reviewing the
financial reports of the 500 largest U.S. companies.</TE>
<TE>   The Office of Management and Budget will consider Pitt's request
for pay raises after he submits a plan to base pay increases on merit
rather than across the board, spokeswoman Amy Call said.</TE>
<TE>   "We look forward to seeing a merit-based plan from the SEC," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt said he is hopeful a resolution will be reached. "We'll meet
with OMB. Being an eternal optimist, we'll eventually either be able
to persuade them or wear them down," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt, a Republican, praised a bill approved Wednesday by the
Republican-dominated House Financial Services Committee that gives
the SEC discretion in forming a new accounting oversight group. The
panel rejected Democratic bills that would have given the group more
disciplinary authority.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt said the SEC plans to propose rules to create an accounting
oversight group as early as next month. The agency is likely to
approve rules for the new group, as well as an assortment of other
post-Enron disclosure measures, by the end of the year, he said.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cendant Corp. said its first-quarter earnings rose 43% as the world's
largest hotel franchiser was helped by a rebound in travel and
acquisition of the Avis car rental firm and other businesses.</LD>
<LD>   The New York-based owner of the Days Inn and other hotel chains
had net income of $342 million, or 34 cents a share. Revenue rose 83%
to $2.71 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Travel has rebounded from the first drop in 19 years last year,
boosting demand for Cendant's cars, hotel rooms and timeshares. The
company, which also franchises Coldwell Banker and other real estate
brokerages, is being helped by a record level of home sales.</LD>
<TE>   Cendant shares fell 7 cents to $18.68 on the NYSE. The results
were released after the close of trading.</TE>
<TE>   The company also said it agreed to buy its partner's stake in NRT
Inc. for about $230 million in stock to gain full control of the
largest owner of residential brokerages.</TE>

<LD>The improving economy helped drive up the U.S. trade deficit in
February to its highest point in 10 months as Americans' appetite for
foreign-made cars, televisions and other goods increased.</LD>
<LD>   The trade gap widened to $31.5billion, an 11.6% increase from
January's deficit, the Commerce Department reported.</LD>
<LD>   With imports growing more quickly than exports as the economy
rebounds, the trade gap expanded more than expected.</LD>
<TE>   February's deficit was the biggest since a $31.9-billion shortfall

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Allstate Corp. said first-quarter net income fell 15% to $426
million, or 60 cents a share, as it increased reserves for mold
damage in Texas and other homeowner claims, which are costing
millions of dollars more than the insurer expected.</LD>
<LD>   Excluding one-time items, Allstate's first-quarter profit fell to
68 cents a share, far surpassing analysts' estimates of 58 cents.</LD>
<LD>   Like other car and home insurers, Allstate is recovering from
several years of patchy earnings, hit by rising claim costs and
slumping rates after a decade-long price war. New rate increases are
aimed at catching up with rising claims, but they will not boost
profit until next year.</LD>
<TE>   The Northbrook, Ill.-based company's revenue rose 2% to $7.3
billion.</TE>

<LD>* Calypte Biomedical Corp., best known for its urine-based HIV tests,
said it's firing up to 40 employees, about half of its work force,
and may go out of business if it's not acquired soon. The Alameda,
Calif.-based company has been losing money for the last 12 months
despite increasing sales.</LD>
<LD>   * Outdoor magazine Sports Afield will cease publication this
spring, the victim of one of the worst advertising recessions in
years. Publisher Robert Petersen, who had acquired the magazine in
January 2000 and relocated it to Los Angeles from New York, said
Sports Afield will end its 115-year run with the June 2002 issue.</LD>
<LD>   * WellPoint Health Networks Inc. said it is petitioning the Food
and Drug Administration to make Schering-Plough Corp. sell its newly
introduced Clarinex drug over the counter. Schering-Plough officials
had no comment.</LD>
<TE>   * Linens 'n Things Inc. said first-quarter profit rose 9.5% to
$5.14 million, or 12 cents a share, 3 cents better than forecasts.
Sales rose 20% to $456.9million.</TE>
<TE>   * Oakley Inc. reported a 38% decline in first-quarter net income
to $5.6 million, or 8 cents a share, from year-earlier profit of $9.1
million, or 13 cents, which included a benefit of 1 cent from a
reduced tax rate. Sales rose 17% to $109.6 million. The latest
results beat the company's forecast of 5 cents. The Foothill Ranch
company raised expectations for the full year, to 81 cents a share
from its previous forecast of 77 cents to 80 cents. Oakley said its
backlog of orders at the end of the quarter was up 11.9% from a year

<LD>Philip Morris Cos., the world's biggest cigarette maker, said
first-quarter earnings rose 33% after costs fell at Kraft Foods Inc.
and the company had fewer expenses related to its acquisition of
Nabisco Holdings Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Net income at the maker of Marlboro cigarettes rose to
$2.37billion, or $1.09 a share. Last year, Philip Morris had to write
down the Nabisco acquisition, which boosted costs. Under new
accounting rules, the company no longer must do that.</LD>
<LD>   Operating profit, which excludes certain costs, was $2.47billion,
or $1.14 a share, a penny better than analyst estimates. Sales rose
2.9% to $20.5 billion.</LD>

<HD>IBM Earnings Plunge by 32%</HD>
<DH>Technology: Computer maker blames drop in profit, revenue
on reduced corporate spending.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saying companies spent less on technology in the first quarter, IBM
Corp. reported its sharpest drop in earnings since the world's No. 1
computer maker emerged in 1993 from a string of losses.</LD>
<LD>   But the company sounded a positive note for later this year,
saying that it expects to meet analysts' 2002 estimates as revenue
from services improves to double-digit growth, which helped boost its
shares in after-hours trading to as high as $87.29. The shares had
closed off $1.39 at $84.81 on the Big Board before the report was
released.</LD>
<LD>   "While no one can predict the timing of a recovery, we remain
optimistic that business conditions will improve later this year,"
said Chief Executive Sam Palmisano, who took over for longtime IBM
head Louis Gerstner on March 1.</LD>
<TE>   IBM posted a profit of $1.19 billion, or 68 cents a share, in the
first quarter, down 32% from $1.75 billion, or 98 cents, in the
year-earlier period.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue fell 12% to $18.6 billion from $21 billion. Sales in the
closely watched services division dropped 3% to $8.2 billion.
Hardware revenue fell 25% as results from its large corporate
computers and data storage products fell.</TE>
<TE>   The results were in line with the range IBM gave April 8, when it
said profit and sales would trail estimates. Based on that warning,
analyst expectations were reduced from 85 cents a share on revenue of
$19.7 billion to 68 cents on sales of $18.53 billion, according to
Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   IBM shares have been under pressure this year as investors worried
about slowing growth in the company's services division. In addition,
its accounting has been scrutinized.</TE>
<TE>   In other earnings reports:</TE>
<TE>   * Propelled by strong microprocessor sales, Advanced Micro Devices
Inc. reported a smaller-than-expected first-quarter loss of $9.2
million, or 3 cents a share, contrasted with a profit of $124.8
million, or 37 cents, in the same period a year ago. Revenue was down
24% to $902million, compared with $1.2billion last year. But AMD said
it sold 8million PC processors, a record for the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   * Nextel Communications Inc., the nation's fifth-largest wireless
phone service provider, posted a narrower first-quarter operating
loss even as a big charge pushed its net loss wider.</TE>
<TE>   Nextel said its net loss widened to $654 million, or 82 cents a
share, from a loss of $428million, or 56 cents, a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   This year's results included a charge of $355million, or 42 cents
a share, related to goodwill accounting changes as well as a
restructuring charge of $40million, or 5 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding the charges, Nextel's loss was $279million, or 35 cents
a share, compared with analysts' average estimate of a 40-cent loss.
Sales rose to $2.16billion from $1.74billion, but average revenue per
customer fell to $68 from $71 a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   * Internet payment service PayPal Inc. reported a first-quarter
profit, as revenue more than tripled, in its first earnings report as
a public company.</TE>
<TE>   PayPal, which completed an initial public offering this year, also
raised its earnings guidance for the second quarter and the rest of
the year. The company said it earned $1.2 million, or 2 cents a
share, in the latest quarter, contrasted with a loss of $29.3
million, or $5.39, in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue rose to $48.8
million from $14 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Because of brisk demand for its new iMac, Apple Computer Inc.
reported fiscal second-quarter profit that beat Wall Street
estimates. For the three months ended March 30, the PC maker's
earnings fell 7% to $40million, or 11 cents a share, as revenue rose
4.8% to $1.5billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Conexant Systems Inc.'s fiscal second-quarter loss narrowed as
the Newport Beach communications chip maker's operating expenses
declined. Sales fell 4% in the period ended March 29. The loss
narrowed to $200.7 million, or 78 cents a share, from $262 million,
or $1.08, in the year-earlier quarter. Sales fell to $241 million
from $251 million. The loss was the company's ninth straight.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcom Corp., the world's largest maker of cable modem chips,
said its first-quarter loss narrowed as acquisition-related costs
declined. Sales at the Irvine firm fell 23% to $238.8 million from a
year earlier. The loss was $166.1 million, or 63 cents a share,
compared with $356.9 million, or $1.43, a year earlier.</TE>

<HD>Brown Hires Lawyer to End Miramax Contract</HD>
<DH>Media: Former Talk magazine editor is seeking to pursue
other offers including hosting a cable talk show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN W. O'NEILL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tina Brown, editor of defunct Talk magazine, has hired powerful Los
Angeles entertainment lawyer Bert Fields to extricate her from her
Miramax employment contract so she can pursue other offers.</LD>
<LD>   Brown's future has been the subject of speculation since the
magazine, the brainchild of Brown and Miramax co-Chairman Harvey
Weinstein, ceased publication in February after 2 1/2 years.</LD>
<LD>   Known as "The Queen of Hype," the British-born Brown gained fame
in the 1980s for revitalizing Vanity Fair before departing in 1992 to
edit the New Yorker.</LD>
<TE>   "She has multiple offers on the table," said a source close to
Brown who asked not to be identified. The offers include hosting talk
shows on cable television and writing a version of her "Tina Brown's
Diary" column for other magazines.</TE>
<TE>   Brown has 18 months left in the five-year contract she signed with
Miramax Films, a unit of Walt Disney Co.</TE>
<TE>   When Brown and Weinstein founded Talk, the idea was to create a
slick synergy between culture and celebrity, filmmaking and book and
magazine publishing.</TE>
<TE>   They blamed declining advertising revenue in the wake of the Sept.
11 attacks for the magazine's demise.</TE>
<TE>   Until her contract is resolved, Brown continues to head the Talk
Miramax Books unit.</TE>
<TE>   Fields has made a name for himself by winning multimillion-dollar
awards for his clients from film studios and by settling high-level
employment contract disputes. He is best known for winning a
$250-million severance package for Jeffrey Katzenberg, who was fired
as studio chief at Disney. He also has represented former Miramax
executives in contract disputes.</TE>
<TE>   Brown and Fields confirmed Wednesday that the lawyer had been
hired to assist her in talks with Miramax, but they declined to
discuss specifics. Brown denied reports that talks with Weinstein
have grown tense.</TE>
<TE>   But a source close to Brown said her contract with Miramax
prevents her from pursuing other offers.</TE>
<TE>   Weinstein could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent conversation, he described himself as Brown's "biggest
defender," adding that he didn't think the magazine's demise
"strained my relationship with her at all."</TE>

<HD>TRW May Talk With Northrop</HD>
<DH>Aerospace: Revised buyout offer is rejected but takeover
target raises possibility it may be willing to negotiate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TRW Inc. on Wednesday rebuffed Northrop Grumman Corp.'s enhanced
offer to acquire the company for $6.7 billion but for the first time
left open the possibility of negotiating a deal with its defense
rival.</LD>
<LD>   In a move that some analysts believe bolsters prospects for a
merger of the two companies, TRW directors agreed to share nonpublic
financial documents with "interested parties" including Northrop,
subject to confidentiality agreements.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said the directors essentially put TRW up for sale, but
because it now appears that Northrop is the only bidder the move
would mainly benefit the Century City-based defense contractor. TRW
directors had so far steadfastly refused to open the company's books
to Northrop.</LD>
<TE>   "It certainly looks very promising for Northrop," said Paul H.
Nisbet, an analyst with JSA Research Inc. "What's happened here is
that TRW recognizes that its stockholders are likely to back
Northrop."</TE>
<TE>   Northrop, which in late February made a hostile bid for
Cleveland-based TRW, has been pushing hard for TRW to open its books,
contending that a due diligence review could lead to a higher offer.</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, Northrop has been running full-page advertisements
in major newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times, urging
shareholders to persuade TRW directors to "allow us to conduct due
diligence, which is a condition for this offer."</TE>
<TE>   "If not, our offer will not proceed. Period," the advertisement
asserted.</TE>
<TE>   After an initial stock bid of $47 a share, Northrop sweetened the
offer by 13% to $53 earlier this week, raising the overall value of
the deal to $6.7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop said it was raising the offer to reflect the effect of
the improving economy on TRW's automotive and aerospace businesses</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Wednesday, Northrop Chairman Kent Kresa said he
was not surprised by TRW's rejection of the sweetened offer but was
"encouraged" by TRW's decision to open up its financial books.</TE>
<TE>   "It's moving in the right direction," Kresa said. "When we do due
diligence, and if their board believes there is more value, we could
raise the offer and come back with new terms."</TE>
<TE>   What those terms may be is not clear but analysts said Northrop
may have to raise the offer by $2 to $3 a share to consummate the
deal. And Kresa did not preclude making such a revised offer.</TE>
<TE>   "We made it very clear we will pay full value for an excellent
property and this is clearly an excellent property," he said. "But we
won't overpay."</TE>
<TE>   Bolstered by better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, mainly
due to increased defense spending, TRW directors said Northrop's
latest proposal to increase the offer was still "financially
inadequate." TRW last month rejected Northrop's initial hostile bid
of $47 a share, saying the offer "grossly" undervalued the company.</TE>
<TE>   "At $53 per share, our board continues to believe that Northrop's
offer is inadequate," TRW Chairman Philip A. Odeen said.</TE>
<TE>   "As our excellent first-quarter earnings attest, TRW's financial
performance is strong and, as a result of favorable trends in both
our automotive and defense businesses, we have increased our earnings
expectations for the full year," he said.</TE>
<TE>   TRW executives have not publicly said what it believes the company
is worth, but sources familiar with TRW said that the firm's
investment advisor, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., has estimated TRW's breakup
value at $60 a share.</TE>
<TE>   TRW has accelerated a breakup plan, similar to what Northrop had
proposed in its bid. TRW has drawn up plans to sell the aeronautical
parts business, using the proceeds to pay down debt, and then spin
off its automotive parts business to focus the company on its space
and defense electronics business.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop has proposed a similar plan, saying it just wants the
space and defense business because it would allow Northrop to compete
head-on with the nation's two top defense firms, Boeing Co. and
Lockheed Martin Corp.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, TRW executives insisted Wednesday that they received
a number of unsolicited" inquiries from other companies about
acquiring all or parts of TRW but declined to say if any had led to
substantive talks.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Wall Street seemed to believe there were not likely to be
any rival bids, leaving TRW shares slightly above Northrop's
sweetened offer.</TE>
<TE>   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, TRW shares climbed
$1.47 to $53.85, while Northrop shares fell $2.86 to $113.88.</TE>
<TE>   James A. McAleese, a defense industry lawyer in McLean, Va., said
TRW appears to have few options left.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm seeing a guy who is throwing in the towel," McAleese said.
"The market has concluded that Northrop is willing to pay a little
more but that nobody else is going to show up. This chapter is
closed."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Northrop said increased defense spending coupled with
results from several major acquisitions pushed first-quarter earnings
up 13% to $149 million, or $1.27 a share, from year-earlier $132
million, or $1.81 a share. The per-share amount declined this year
because there are 55% more shares outstanding, the company said.
Sales more than doubled to $4.09 billion from $2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   TRW said first-quarter net income rose to $91 million, or 71 cents
a share, from $78 million, or 62 cents, as the company benefited from
a large cut in payroll last year when about 10,000 jobs were
eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   Sales fell slightly to $4.08 billion from $4.17 billion.</TE>

<HD>Williams-Sonoma Boosts Earnings Forecasts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Williams-Sonoma Inc. on Wednesday more than quadrupled its
first-quarter earnings forecast and raised its full-year outlook by
more than 10% as consumers spend more on their homes.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco-based domestics retailer, which runs the
high-end Williams-Sonoma, Pottery Barn and Hold Everything chains,
also announced a 2-for-1 split of its common stock. Its shares soared
to $53.91, their highest level since December, before closing up
$5.49, or 11.6%, at $52.85 on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   "Sales and gross margins continue to be strong," Chief Executive
Dale Hilpert said. "The consumer response to new merchandise in
Pottery Barn has exceeded our expectations."</LD>
<TE>   He said more sales at full price and fewer markdowns at all of its
stores also boosted profit margins.</TE>
<TE>   Williams-Sonoma increased its earnings target for the first
quarter to 17 cents to 19 cents a share from a previous range of 3
cents to 4 cents. Analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call on
average expected 4 cents for the quarter that began Feb. 4. It now
sees first-quarter sales at its stores open at least a year rising
between 4.5% and 5.5%, from an earlier range of 3.5% to 4.5%.</TE>
<TE>   The company raised its full-year guidance to profit of $1.69 to
$1.75, from the prior target of $1.52 to $1.56. The First Call
estimate stands at $1.56.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Williams-Sonoma said it was lowering its previously
reported fourth-quarter profit by 1.4%, after accounting changes in
the timing for booking catalog sales.</TE>
<TE>   The change, made after an internal review and discussions with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, will not affect other quarters,
it said.</TE>

<HD>ExpressJet May See Its Stock Take Off After IPO</HD>
<DH>Airlines: The shares will begin trading today as enthusiasm
for regional carriers appears high.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Regional airline ExpressJet Holdings Inc. today will try to ride the
momentum of JetBlue Airways, which went public last week to a rousing
investor reception.</LD>
<LD>   ExpressJet on Wednesday raised $480 million in its initial public
stock offering, which sold at the top of the expected price range,
tapping strong investor demand for regional air carriers.</LD>
<LD>   Houston-based ExpressJet, majority-owned by Continental Airlines
Inc., sold 30 million shares at $16 each, at the high end of the
expected range of $14 to $16.</LD>
<TE>   The stock will begin trading today on the New York Stock Exchange
under the ticker symbol XJT.</TE>
<TE>   The sale was the largest airline IPO in five years, after the
$700-million IPO of China Southern Airlines Co. in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, upstart airline JetBlue raised $158 million in its IPO.
The stock (ticker symbol: JBLU) was sold at $27 a share and
immediately rocketed to $45. It has held at that level, closing
Wednesday at $45.10 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Investors are attracted to smaller carriers because many are
profitable, while many major airlines still are in the red, analysts
said.</TE>
<TE>   ExpressJet, which flies to 33 U.S. states from hubs in Houston,
Cleveland, and Newark, N.J., registered its first profit last year,
earning $48.1 million on revenue of $980.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   ExpressJet shares are valued at about 16 times the company's
expected earnings per share for the next 12 months, according to Jeff
Hirschkorn, an IPO analyst at World Financial Capital Markets.</TE>
<TE>   That's above the industry average of 10 times estimated 2002
earnings per share, though about half the 34 times earnings at which
JetBlue is trading.</TE>
<TE>   Continental gets the proceeds from 16 million shares and
ExpressJet will keep the remainder.</TE>
<TE>   The ExpressJet stock sale was managed by investment banks Salomon
Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley. Morgan also handled the JetBlue
stock offering.</TE>

<HD>Xerox Stresses Danger of Default</HD>
<DH>Technology: Copier maker says liquidity is at risk unless
it renegotiates $7 billion in loans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN REGA</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Xerox Corp. said Wednesday that a failure to renegotiate $7 billion
in bank loans maturing in October would put it in danger of going out
of business.</LD>
<LD>   The world's largest copier maker said in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission that it is optimistic about talks
with lenders, but it remains in danger of defaulting on the debt if
it is unable to get all 57 banks that own a piece of the loans to
agree to refinance.</LD>
<LD>   Xerox exhausted the loans in 2000 and has been funding operations
with cash, proceeds from asset sales and financing that is backed by
customer bills. The company, which has been in talks with its banks
for months, hasn't made a quarterly report to the SEC--a common place
for such a disclosure--since an amended filing for the third quarter
in December.</LD>
<TE>   The circumstances raise "substantial doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern," Xerox said in the filing.</TE>
<TE>   The company said April 2 that it missed the deadline for its
annual report because it was in talks with the SEC to settle a fraud
case in which the company agreed to pay a $10-million fine.</TE>
<TE>   Xerox inflated results from 1997 to 1999 with bogus accounting,
the SEC has said. The company also supplemented earnings by
$500million by improperly releasing unrelated reserves into income,
the SEC said. The company is preparing restated results for 1997
through 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Xerox fell 11 cents to $9.59 on the New York Stock
Exchange before news of the filing was released.</TE>
<TE>   The company hasn't in past filings used the "going concern"
notice, an accounting term that warns investors a firm might be in
danger of going out of business. The term often refers to a
worst-case scenario rather than a likelihood.</TE>
<TE>   In a January filing, the company said failure to refinance "could
have a serious adverse impact on our liquidity."</TE>
<TE>   Xerox said in March it had about $4.8billion in cash.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's filing was Xerox's first registration statement,
another place where a going concern warning might appear, since May
2000. The S-4 filing was made to permit public trading of $600million
of 9 3/4% senior notes, due 2009, that Xerox sold in January.</TE>

<LD>Robert Scheer has reached a new level of Orwellian doublespeak in his
April 17 commentary comparing Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. How is it that Israel can be an
occupying power when the Arabs outnumber the Jews 20 to 1? And this
is a struggle between the whole Arab world and the Jews. Are Israeli
troops, who are fighting house to house to smoke out terrorists, in
order to save Palestinian civilian lives that would be lost through
airstrikes and artillery barrages, really equivalent to suicide
bombers?</LD>
<LD>   And finally, invoking the proud legacy of Israel's founders to
prove his points is truly nauseating. David Ben-Gurion, Golda Meir,
Menachem Begin and others all extended their hands in peace toward

<TE>   Scheer hit the honesty nail right on the head! Sharon has become
the oppressor in the guise of security. When Sharon consoles the
bombers' victims' families, he should say he is sorry for being so
pigheaded by oppressing the Palestinian youths so much that they
become human bombs. Peace can be achieved only when the Sharon
government stops the invasion, ends assassinations and removes the
illegal settlements on the Palestinian land areas.</TE>

<TE>   Congratulations to Scheer for his courage. Sharon is Israel's
Milosevic. The sad difference between the conflicts in Bosnia and
Kosovo in the past and Palestine now is that the U.S. fuels the
conflict by providing Sharon with the arms and money needed to wage
war against civilians. Will we never understand that there can be no
peace in the Middle East without justice?</TE>

<TE>   Re " 'They Forced Me to Hate,' " April 14: Did Lukea Tomei weep
when innocent people were killed at a Passover Seder, or when others
were killed while shopping for groceries or going dancing or riding a

never hated the Palestinians, but now they have forced me to hate. I

<TE>   The entire Palestinian population should not be collectively
punished for the atrocities committed by a few. Civilized people must
condemn both the suicide bombers and the war crimes being committed
by Israel (as defined by the Geneva Convention), such as the denial
of food, water, electricity and medical care to the Palestinian
people. Both sides need protection from each other, either by the
U.S., the U.N., NATO or a combination of these three.</TE>

<TE>   It is indeed sad and ironic that Israel has gone from the role of
being oppressed to being the oppressor. I have been a lifelong
supporter of Israel. Since Sharon became prime minister and
especially since the Israeli incursion into Palestinian territory, I
have ceased to support Israel. The Israeli people need to learn that
their use of brute force will continue to erode their support base
and impede any hope for lasting peace.</TE>

<TE>   I have stopped waiting for members of the human rights community
to condemn the intentional mangling and murder of Israeli Jewish
children by suicide bombers with the same fervor that they use to
decry the bulldozing of Palestinian homes that are used to shelter
terrorists and bomb-making factories. I am still waiting for them to
express outrage at the exploitation of Palestinian children by their
presumed liberators, who induce them to become human bombs and human
shields.</TE>

<LD>"Off Track on Cell Research," your April 11 editorial on cloning,
raised important issues. As director of the City of Hope
Comprehensive Cancer Center, I agree that Sen. Sam Brownback's
(R-Kan.) bill that would ban research on therapeutic stem cell
cloning would have unfortunate consequences. I disagree with the
contention that the bill would drive public research into the private
sector. Much more damaging is that the bill would drive research on
therapeutic cloning out of the country by making it a criminal
offense.</LD>
<LD>   If the U.S. government bans research in therapeutic cloning, this
work will undoubtedly continue overseas. Today, the U.S. is the world
leader in biomedical research, and American researchers have made
many of the most significant contributions to biomedical research
over the last century. Banning therapeutic cloning in spite of its
promise would risk the loss of America's leadership role in advancing
biomedicine and certainly would delay lifesaving advances in medicine
for millions worldwide who suffer from life-threatening diseases.</LD>

<TE>   Michael Ramirez hit the nail on the head with his political
cartoon (Commentary, April 14). The unborn are being targeted as
utilitarian "pieces of meat" to cure every disease known. The end
justifies the means is the prevailing philosophy.</TE>

innocent are treated as spare parts for experimentation?</TE>

<TE>   Ramirez's cartoon depicting a fetus being cut up to cure various
diseases is apparently meant as a reference to stem cell research. Is
Ramirez so ignorant that he really believes this is how the research
is being conducted, or is he so blinded by his right-wing ideology
that he is willing to totally distort the facts in order to make his
point?</TE>
<TE>   Stem cell research promises an enormous breakthrough in wiping out
diseases that have plagued mankind for centuries. Ramirez would have
been right at home with those who persecuted Copernicus and Galileo
for their heretical views.</TE>

<LD>Arianna Huffington's April 12 commentary, "It's Just What the Spin
Doctor Ordered on Oil," on the U.S. Geological Survey's supplemental
information about protecting caribou in the ANWR, is just simply
wrong. The USGS spent years perfecting a computer model that would
allow us to quickly analyze the effects of various energy production
scenarios on caribou populations.</LD>
<LD>   Several scenarios analyzed in the March 29 report had little to no
effect. The supplemental information uses the same peer-reviewed
computer model to analyze the energy production scenarios that today
appear most likely under the proposed legislation. Like similar
scenarios in the original report, the computer analysis of these
scenarios showed little or no effect on wildlife.</LD>
<LD>   The USGS' supplemental information concludes that energy
production would have little to no effect on caribou. The information
confirms that with new technologies, tough regulations and
common-sense management we can protect wildlife and produce energy on
a tiny portion of Alaska's North Slope.</LD>

<HD>No Drug Tests Needed in a Perfect World</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re ''It's School, Not Prison,'' editorial, April 15: The Supreme
Court has upheld suspicionless searches to conduct drug testing of
railroad personnel involved in train accidents, to conduct random
drug testing of federal customs officers who carry arms or are
involved in drug interdiction and to maintain automobile checkpoints
looking for illegal immigrants and contraband.</LD>
<LD>   While students do not shed their constitutional rights at the
schoolhouse gate, the nature of those rights is what is appropriate
for children at school. Public school children in general, and
students involved in after-school programs in particular, have a
diminished expectation of privacy.</LD>
<LD>   A school that has determined that drugs are a scourge should be
able to stamp out drug use not only by the least-intrusive means
possible, that is, by drug testing on suspicion of drug use. The fact
that the drug tests are random ensures that drug use among students
will be reduced to a minimum. Oftentimes the drug user will not
display any outward signs of impairment or abuse. Moreover, drug
testing based on reasonable suspicion imposes the prospect of
arbitrary testing, which inevitably results in lawsuits.</LD>
<TE>   The Times asserted that the stoners would be the least likely to
participate in after-school programs. The Vernonia School District in
Oregon found that athletes were the leaders of the drug culture. The
Times should applaud a high school willing to eradicate drug use
rather than censure it for requiring that students involved in
after-school programs submit to random drug testing.</TE>
<TE>   Gregory Givens</TE>
<TE>   Redondo Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   My brother is a high school principal in Oklahoma, and his school
already tests students involved in any after-school program. The net
effect at his school has been significantly reduced student
absenteeism, an increase in after-school participation and an
inferred reduction in drug use among students.</TE>
<TE>   Parents are generally clueless about their children's drug use.
But they are aware of their participation in after-school programs.
Linking the two has given parents a heads-up about potential
problems. If Johnny suddenly drops out of band, Mom and Dad want to
know why. Kids are more likely to be influenced to not use drugs if
they know testing will keep them out of school activities. It will
not, as your editorial implied, keep them from joining school clubs.</TE>
<TE>   In a perfect world, high school student drug testing would not be
necessary. We do not live in that world.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In "A Westside Story of Death, Denial" (Opinion, April 14), about the
murder of Deanna Maran, a Santa Monica High School sophomore, Michael
Cieply makes mention of an event called "Stairway of the Stars." He
takes issue with the seeming omission of a mention of Deanna's death
at the performance and insinuates that she is being forgotten by the
music department. Until that unfortunate moment, the article was
strong and raised many excellent points.</LD>
<LD>   I am the choral director at Santa Monica High School, and Deanna
sang in my class. Her murder completely crushed us. A chair still
sits empty in class and her picture, with other student work, still
hangs on the bulletin board at the front of the class. We are
collecting money for a tree to be planted on campus that will be
dedicated to all students who have died while at Santa Monica High.</LD>
<LD>   Two weeks before the Stairway concert we performed the entire
Mozart Requiem in a memorial concert. So, even though her death--or
the other six deaths we experienced last year--was not mentioned at
Stairway, none of these students has been forgotten. We also did not
mention Sept. 11.</LD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BASEL, Switzerland</DL>
<LD>Herbert Wernicke, a German avant-garde opera designer whose
productions appeared in major theaters across Europe, has died. He
was 56.</LD>
<LD>   Wernicke died Tuesday in Basel, where he was working on the set
for Handel's oratorio "Israel in Egypt" at the city's main theater.
The cause of death was not given. The Austrian newspaper Salzburger
Nachrichten reported that Wernicke collapsed in the street and could
not be revived.</LD>
<LD>   A prolific designer, Wernicke's current projects also included a
production of Wagner's "Ring" cycle for the Bayerische Staatsoper in
Munich, Germany.</LD>
<TE>   His production of Ernst Krenek's 1925 opera "Jonny Spielt Auf" was
to open in Vienna in December.</TE>
<TE>   Born March 24, 1946, in Augge in Germany's Black Forest, Wernicke
studied piano, flute and conducting at the conservatory in
Braunschweig, and then at the Fine Arts Academy in Munich.</TE>

<HD>Damon Knight, 79; Science Fiction Author</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Damon Knight, an award-winning science fiction author, editor and
literary critic who pioneered the serious analysis of science fiction
works, has died. He was 79.</LD>
<LD>   Knight, whose short story "To Serve Man" was turned into a
memorable episode of the TV series "The Twilight Zone," died Monday
of age-related causes in a hospital in Eugene, Ore., according to
family members.</LD>
<LD>   "He was a fine writer and much appreciated and won several
awards," said Patrick Nielsen Hayden, who edited Knight's last two
novels at Tor Books.</LD>
<TE>   "But he was best known as a provocateur, an organizer, a critic
and a teacher."</TE>
<TE>   Hayden said Knight "was the first person to take the serious
trouble of reviewing contemporary science fiction and hold it up to
the standards of intelligent mainstream fiction in various magazines
in the late '40s and early '50s."</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of Knight's most important reviews were collected in a
1956 book, "In Search of Wonder: Essays on Modern Science Fiction,"
which is still in print and is considered one of the important works
of science fiction criticism.</TE>
<TE>   The same year the book came out, Knight won a Hugo Award at the
World Science Fiction Convention for best-science fiction criticism.</TE>
<TE>   Knight also was known as a tireless organizer on behalf of fellow
writers. In 1965, he founded Science Fiction Writers of America, the
professional advocacy group for science fiction and fantasy writers,
which sponsors the Nebula Awards.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid 1950s, Knight, along with James Blish and Judith
Merril, co-founded the Milford Science Fiction Writers' Conference in
Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   That led to the highly regarded Clarion Science Fiction and
Fantasy Writers' Workshop, now held at Michigan State University.</TE>
<TE>   For 27 years, Knight and his second wife, writer Kate Wilhelm,
taught at the workshop, whose graduates include Kim Stanley Robinson,
Luscious Shepard and Vonda McIntyre.</TE>
<TE>   "He taught thousands of people, either through Clarion or his
book, 'Creating Short Fiction,' which is a great primer for any
fiction writer; it tells you everything," said Leslie What of Eugene,
a Nebula Award-winning author who first met Knight at the workshop in
1976 and became a friend.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, she said, Knight taught writing workshops over
the Internet. He and his wife also conducted a monthly workshop in
their home in Eugene.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a tough critic as far as being a teacher and had very high
expectations," What said.</TE>
<TE>   To one Nebula Award-winning writer, Knight once said: "I don't
know why you wrote this story. I wish you hadn't."</TE>
<TE>   "There are 36 ways to tell this story," he told another writer.
"And all of them are disgusting."</TE>
<TE>   Knight was born in Baker City, Ore. At 19, he hitchhiked to New
York City, where he joined a writers' group called the Futurians.
Knight wrote about the group, whose members included Isaac Asimov,
Donald A. Wollheim and Frederik Pohl, in his 1977 memoir, "The
Futurians."</TE>
<TE>   While living in a cold-water flat in 1941, Knight sold his first
short story. He went on to write more than 100 short stories and 13
novels, beginning with "Hell's Pavement," published in 1955.</TE>
<TE>   Knight's best-known short story is "To Serve Man," which was
published in 1950 and turned into an episode of "The Twilight Zone"
in 1962.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of his work and influence in the [science fiction]
world, it's a minor but very good story," Hayden said.</TE>
<TE>   The story deals with the arrival on Earth of giant aliens who
promise to end hunger and war. But their true intentions are made
known when their guidebook, "To Serve Man," is finally decoded: It's
a cookbook.</TE>
<TE>   Dark humor was an ongoing ingredient of Knight's fiction, Hayden
said, "but there are other things that can be said about his work."</TE>
<TE>   "He had a wry but not entirely pessimistic view of human nature. I
don't think anybody that works that hard to get other people to do
better work is fundamentally a pessimist."</TE>
<TE>   Family members say Knight was especially proud of "To Serve Man."
Last Christmas, he had the original story printed on linen paper,
encased it in a plastic spine, and gave signed and numbered copies to
17 family members.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Valerie
Olney of Eugene and Leslie Saulsbury of Portland; two sons, Chris
Knight of Los Angeles and Jonathan Knight of Eugene; two stepsons,
Richard Wilhelm of Portland and Douglas Wilhelm of Hilton, N.Y.; and
seven grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be held today at Musgrove Funeral Chapel,
1152 Olive St., in Eugene.</TE>

<HD>Staley McBrayer, 92; Inventor of Offset Press for Newspaper
Printing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FORT WORTH</DL>
<LD>Staley Thomas McBrayer, a former newspaper publisher credited with
revolutionizing the industry by inventing the newspaper offset press,
has died. He was 92.</LD>
<LD>   McBrayer died Sunday in Fort Worth, the Dallas Morning News
reported.</LD>
<LD>   "He pioneered suburban newspaper publishing," said Otha Spencer,
professor emeritus at Texas A&amp;M University-Commerce and author of
"Staley McBrayer and the Offset Newspaper Revolution."</LD>
<TE>   In the 1940s, McBrayer and his wife operated several small
newspapers in the Fort Worth area.</TE>
<TE>   For five years, McBrayer tinkered with the offset press process
used to print books. Many people believed that it could not be
modified to print a newspaper. In 1954, he introduced the Vanguard
web offset press. A plaque marks the site in Fort Worth.</TE>
<TE>   With the new press, McBrayer moved the newspaper industry from
"hot type" printing to a "cold type" process. Newspapers began to
print from photographic images instead of hand-set metal type,
cutting down on printing time and cost.</TE>
<TE>   "It saved the small newspaper," Spencer said.</TE>
<TE>   The importance of McBrayer's contribution to the newspaper
business was recognized by the American Newspaper Publishers Assn. in
1989.</TE>
<TE>   The group's Vice President William Rinehart said that without the
offset press, "There absolutely wouldn't be newspapers, as we know
them, today. It's that simple."</TE>
<TE>   To the end, McBrayer said his efforts with the offset press were
performed out of financial necessity rather than any sense of
altruism.</TE>
<TE>   "I was sinking financially in the newspaper business. The
development of offset was the way I survived," he said some years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Saltillo, Texas, McBrayer earned a bachelor's degree
in 1933 from East Texas State Teachers College, now A&amp;M-Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   He earned a graduate degree in journalism at the University of
Texas.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by two sisters, Elena Jolly and Mary Beth Hale, and
an extended family.</TE>

<LD>Let's give it up for the children of rock stars. Cher's son, Elijah
Blue, and his band Deadsy tore up the Dragonfly last Friday. The band
was celebrating its new Fred Durst-directed video. (An album's due
out in May.) Among the fans in the house were members of Korn, System
of a Down, Static X, as well as hot chicas Drew Barrymore and Lara
Flynn Boyle.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, back at the Viper Room, Chris Stills--son of Crosby,
Stills, Nash &amp; Young's Stephen Stills--proved he got game. In a
stunning display of raw talent, the singer channeled up the likes of
the Black Crowes and Led Zeppelin--not bad company.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking of raw talent, I'm keeping my neck warm with a Diva Zappa
scarf I scored at the Blest Boutique in Hollywood. Diva--the youngest
of the Zappa brood--is a knitting whiz.... Speaking of whiz kids, Tom
and Travis from Blink-182 proved their new side project Boxcar Racer
ain't no joke. In its Key Club debut last Thursday, the group sounded
like a Nirvana-Blink hybrid. Heavy yet tasty.</LD>
<TE>   I'm waving my pompoms for Ball, my new favorite heavy rock band
spotted at Monday's Camaro Club. Brian Tichy is dyn-o-mite,
particularly considering he's really a drummer (he plays with Ozzy,
Billy Idol and Slash).</TE>

<LD>Itinerant musicians wander in and out of Tamales Liliana's in East
Los Angeles. One day you might hear a peppy accordion, another day a
romantic guitar, or there may only be hand-wringing drama from a
telenovela on the TV set high in one corner. The entertainment at
Liliana's varies, but the food doesn't change. It's always good.</LD>
<LD>   The menu is short, concentrating on antojitos such as gorditas,
sopes, tostadas, burritos and, of course, tamales, as well as a few
meat stews and egg dishes for breakfast--nothing you couldn't find
elsewhere. What sets Liliana's apart is the freshness of the food.
It's prepared to order, so chilaquiles arrive with the edges of the
fried tortillas still crisp, rather than soggy from standing in the
sauce.</LD>
<LD>   And the flavors are surprising. Carne con chile colorado--strips
of pork in red chile sauce--departs from the usual concept of meat in
a vigorous blend of dried chiles. The color is lighter, a golden
orange rather than a deep brick red, and there's an unexpected
nuance, an almost imperceptible tang that turns out to be tomatillos
combined with guajillo chiles.</LD>
<TE>   Pork in salsa verde may not be unusual, but the green sauce is
well made, subtly flavored with tomatillos and spicy with green
chiles. Like other main dishes, it comes with rice and refried beans,
shredded lettuce, tomato and tortillas.</TE>
<TE>   Most Mexican restaurants around here base their moles on the
famous mole from Puebla, with its sweet, dark brown,
chocolate-enriched sauce. Instead, Liliana's makes a Zacatecas-style
peanut mole that, according to one of the waitresses, involves bacon,
squash seeds and tomatoes as well as nuts and chiles. Less deeply
colored, the sauce is mixed with cut up boneless chicken rather than
the whole pieces typical of mole poblano. Another plus: The chicken
is freshly cooked and juicy.</TE>
<TE>   The Zacatecas influence is apparent not only in the mole, and
Zacatecas-style gorditas and huaraches, but in scenes of Zacatecas
painted onto the pale pink walls.</TE>
<TE>   Located on Cesar E. Chavez Avenue (there is another location at
3448 E. 1st St.), this is a spare, simple restaurant, just three rows
of tables in one room and a takeout counter in an anteroom opening
onto the street. Even if you eat there, drinks come in plastic foam
containers, as if you had ordered them to go.</TE>
<TE>   People drive long distances to buy Liliana's tamales. Fillings
include meat in red or green chile sauce, chicken with vegetables,
chile strips with cheese, a sweet tamale that contains raisins and
pineapple, and a plain fresh corn tamale. You can order them on a
tamale plate with beans and rice at the restaurant, or take a sack
home. Most Mexican restaurants reserve pozole for weekends, but
Liliana's offers this hearty soup every day. Crisp, freshly shredded
cabbage and sliced radishes top the big bowl of broth, pork and
cooked dried corn. You add lime juice, oregano and hot sauce to
taste. Golden brown fried tortillas, as flat and crisp as crackers,
accompany this dish.</TE>
<TE>   Gorditas come in paper sacks because the corn cakes fall apart
when drenched with sauce from moist fillings such as chicharrones
(fried pork skin) in green sauce. Huaraches (sandals) are oval bases
of masa topped with meat, shredded lettuce, tomato, Mexican crema and
cheese. Sopes transfer the same ingredients to a different type of
base, a thick small circle of masa with edges pinched to form a rim.
Cheese enchiladas are lightly coated with red chile sauce rather than
submerged in it. Tacos, flautas and tostadas are also available.</TE>
<TE>   The only dessert on the menu is flan, but a sign in the window
announces that Guadalajara-style jericalla has arrived. This is a
light pudding, made without caramel sauce and baked until the top is
golden brown.</TE>
<TE>   If you want a tall, cold Mexican drink, ask for horchata,
tamarindo or jamaica. The cinnamon-y horchata is especially good.
However, the lead drink here is champurrado, which is like hot cocoa,
thickened with masa. The Liliana's version is sweet and delicately
flavored rather than dark with chocolate. You could call it liquid
comfort food, it's that soothing.</TE>
<TE>   Tamales Liliana's, 4619 Cesar E. Chavez Ave., East Los Angeles,
(323) 780-0989. Open Monday-Friday, 9 a.m.-9 p.m.; Saturday-Sunday, 7
a.m.-9 p.m. Street parking. No alcohol. There is a $1.50 charge for
using a credit card. Lunch for two, $6 to $12. What to get:
chilaquiles with green sauce, sopes, tamales, pozole, carne con chile
colorado, mole de cacahuate con pollo, carne de puerco en salsa
verde, champurrado, horchata.</TE>

<HD>The Ultimate Turf War</HD>
<DH>A Westsider and an Eastsider go 12 rounds to see which area
can claim supremacy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLEE KOMAIKO and CHRISTOPHER NOXON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are more splits in the city of Los Angeles than at an Olympic
gymnastic competition. There are rich and poor. City folks and Valley
dwellers. Those who work in entertainment and those the trade papers
call "non-pros." And, of course, there are enough ethnicities and
religions to make the L.A. County census look like a work of
theoretical physics.</LD>
<LD>   There's also a much blurrier, but equally contentious, divide:
between Westside and Eastside. It's a tricky split to define.
Everyone draws his own boundaries. And the points of contention can
seem downright silly to those who live in South-Central, Northridge
or San Pedro. But to many who live in places such as Los Feliz or
Santa Monica, the distinctions prompt raging debate. Westsiders gripe
about the smog and cooler-than-thou attitude east of La Brea Avenue.
Eastsiders moan about the superficiality and SUV traffic jams near
the ocean. Such opinions typically are expressed privately, in the
company of like-minded neighbors.</LD>
<LD>   It's time to get this out in the open. It's time to take off the
gloves. It's time for a smackdown.</LD>
<TE>   Taking our cue from those masters of rhetoric at the World
Wrestling Federation, we present a 12-round grudge match between a
die-hard Eastsider and an equally impassioned Westsider. Christopher
"Boom Boom" Noxon lives a few blocks from his childhood home in Los
Feliz and feels like a stranger in a strange land when he goes west
of Robertson Boulevard. Leslee "The Terminator" Komaiko was raised in
Westwood, lives in Santa Monica and says the Eastside is a whole lot
of hype.</TE>
<TE>   Round 1: Identity</TE>
<TE>   Is the Eastside an ugly stepsister?</TE>
<TE>   Leslee: Let's start with this: The Westside is Los Angeles. It is
the public face of our city, and it is why people come here. Not that
tourists are the ultimate arbiters of taste, but it's worth noting
that most of them stay on the Westside. Sun, surf, palm trees--this
is the California dream. What you guys have on the Eastside is
wannabe New York. And what's up with the vintage clothing, tattoos
and sullen 'tude? Are they mandatory Eastside issue? Your cool is so
practiced and cultivated. Ours is effortless. It's as simple as jeans
and a tee and flip-flops. No wonder Westsiders are a generally
happier bunch. Life is good over here. Life, in fact, is better.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher: First off, thanks for so succinctly articulating why
all the sullen, sun-starved Eastsiders choose to live where we do: to
get away from the deluded likes of you. Your sun-and-surf "Baywatch"
fantasy may excite clueless out-of-towners, but over here it sounds
like a whole lot of bland, bubble-headed hooey. And what's this about
effortless cool? All the Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeons and
Brentwood exercise mills tell a very different story. While you're
all madly scrambling to realize your precious California dream, we
Eastsiders are busy living our real lives, thanks very much.</TE>
<TE>   Round 2: Neighborhoods</TE>
<TE>   Is the Westside a sea of sameness?</TE>
<TE>   Christopher: When it comes to neighborhoods, we Eastsiders have
you begging for mercy under the heels of our boots. You've heard of
neighborhoods, haven't you? Despite a few pockets of difference, the
Westside is a vast grid of the similar. Over here, you'll find dozens
of thriving communities, each with its own flavor. One day tooling
around the Eastside might take you to Koreatown, Little Armenia or
Thai Town or down avenues of neon-topped townhouses or through
districts where all the ethnicities, classes and styles of
architecture get lost in a fantastic jumble. We celebrate those
differences. You Westsiders like your hometown like you like your
fast food--dependable but flavorless.</TE>
<TE>   Leslee: Apparently your perceptive abilities come to a screeching
halt at La Brea. Last I checked, Culver City, the Pacific Palisades,
Beverly Hills and Venice weren't easily confused, not to mention
Sawtelle's Japan Town and Westwood Boulevard's Little Persia. Might I
suggest you invest in a Thomas Guide? Or a brain? Or run for office.
Seems your "we are the world" speech is already written. P.S. May you
choke on your next Tito's taco. Flavorless my all-natural,
non-enhanced C cups.</TE>
<TE>   Round 3: Outdoors</TE>
<TE>   Are Eastsiders nature-starved urbanites?</TE>
<TE>   Leslee: You've got Griffith Park, a decent enough patch of grass
with its impressive observatory. Wait. That's closed. There's also
charming MacArthur Park. (At our parks the only transactions going on
are between the kids and the ice cream truck driver.) I'll even toss
you Runyon Canyon. But none of this compares to the Pacific and all
its attendant goodness: miles of bike paths, outrageous sunsets,
endless views from Santa Monica Mountains hiking trails, sandcastle
opportunities, the Venice canals, beautiful tanned and shirtless boys
showing off their ripped abs. Ever try to surf Silver Lake? Good
luck, sucka. Buy yourself a conch shell and take a bath, 'cause
that's as close as you're gonna get.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher: That patch of grass you so quickly dismiss happens to
be 4,100 acres, the largest urban park in America. And I think you're
forgetting something in your rosy view of the Pacific's blessings:
pollution-related illnesses like dysentery and diarrhea. We'll stick
to Echo Park, nearby Angeles National Forest and perhaps the best
outdoor venue in all Los Angeles: Dodger Stadium. Have fun ogling the
sweaty abs (ick, by the way); we'll be in the bleachers with a beer
and a Dodger Dog.</TE>
<TE>   Round 4: Culture</TE>
<TE>   Are Westsiders cultural heathens?</TE>
<TE>   Christopher: Save us both some trouble and curl up right now and
cry like the baby you are, because we Eastsiders have got you beat
bad here. I understand you're proud of that big beige museum on the
hill--you know the one, where tourists go to check out the view
instead of the art--but unless you count breast enhancements or those
airbrush murals they put on surfboards, fine art just ain't a
Westside specialty. Out East, we've got the major museums (LACMA,
MOCA), stellar music venues (the Hollywood Bowl, the Music Center),
world-class live theater (the Ahmanson, the L.A. Theater Center) and
countless more cultural hot spots (the American Cinematheque, the
Central Library, galleries in Echo Park and on Chung King Road).
While you Westsiders may equate culture with the new-releases section
at Blockbuster, we Eastsiders enjoy a cultural diet rich in the finer
things.</TE>
<TE>   Leslee: Get over yourself. To most Eastsiders, culture means
having a Corona at Spaceland. Sure, you have some primo cultural
institutions, but we're not exactly hurting in that department. In
addition to the Getty, which you were kind enough to mention, there's
the Santa Monica Museum of Art, the Geffen Playhouse, the Wadsworth
Theater, the Skirball Center, plus sleepers like Beyond Baroque, the
Museum of Jurassic Technology and Highways. In sum, we have more
culture than Yoplait.</TE>
<TE>   Round 5: Dining</TE>
<TE>   Do Eastsiders know the meaning of haute cuisine?</TE>
<TE>   Leslee: Why did the Westsider cross the road? For dim sum. That's
about it. The most recent Zagat survey (notably by the people, for
the people) puts the city's best American, best brunch, best
breakfast, best Japanese, best Italian, best French, best Greek, best
Indian, best Middle Eastern, best pizza, best steakhouse, best
vegetarian--need I continue?--all on the Westside.</TE>
<TE>   You can't touch Josie's quiche, Nate 'n Al's lima bean soup, Bay
Cities' submarine sandwiches, Stan's doughnuts or the perfect
elegance of a patio table at the Hotel Bel-Air, not to mention the
cheese at the Beverly Hills Cheese Shop and the fish at Santa Monica
Seafood. In sum, we have better restaurants, better chefs and better
food purveyors. Tell that to your king of weird meats and
unpronounceable comestibles, Jonathan Gold. He can wave his pompoms
all he likes. We still pack more flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher: Put that flimsy Zagat away, girl. Every
self-respecting foodie knows that Zagat is about as important to food
as Cliffs Notes are to great literature. Don't kid yourself--most
Westside joints dish out overpriced knockoffs of food you can get
better and with much less attitude here. You want fancy eats? Try
Patina, Musso &amp; Frank, Ciudad, Vida, Les Deux Cafe or Water Grill.
And another thing: Say what you want about weird meats, but don't
mess with Jonathan Gold. You are but a slobbering jester in his
culinary court.</TE>
<TE>   Round 6: Getting Around</TE>
<TE>   Are Westsiders ocean-locked losers without a clue?</TE>
<TE>   Christopher: Gridlock has got us both in a stranglehold. But
getting around the Eastside does have its advantages. For one thing,
we've got a subway so fast and spiffy that it almost makes us forget
its utter impracticality for day-to-day travel. More important,
however, is the fact that we're simply closer to more of what makes
L.A. special. From here you can make a relatively quick trip to the
Huntington Botanical Gardens or Watts Towers or the Burbank Bob's Big
Boy without breaking a sweat. Any one of those trips would prompt
nervous twitches and the installation of a global positioning system
for a typical Westsider. Because we don't have that big blue barrier
hemming us in on one side (I think you call it an ocean), we're never
too far from what makes Los Angeles so vibrant and fascinating.</TE>
<TE>   Leslee: Oh yes, Burbank Bob's Big Boy: Isn't that one of the seven
wonders of the world? Gimme a break. And that subway? Drew Carey's
treadmill probably sees more use. Over here there's Highway 1, the
most awesome drive in the city, as well as Sunset Boulevard from the
Strip to the ocean, the second-most awesome drive. Figure in a few
bike paths and clearly you're the sorry one.</TE>
<TE>   Round 7: Shopping</TE>
<TE>   Is "Eastside shopping" an oxymoron?</TE>
<TE>   Leslee: Remember on "Let's Make a Deal" when the contestant would
pick curtain No. 3 hoping for the shiny new car and instead get a
goat? That's Eastside shopping. Call us materialistic, but we've got
the goods. In addition to a handful of malls and department stores
ranging from Neiman's to Target where they actually sell stuff one
needs--you have to commute to buy your tighty whities!--the Westside
is home to the city's reigning shopping streets: Montana Avenue for
linens and housewares, Main Street for beach gear, Robertson
Boulevard for designer duds, Melrose Avenue for art and shoes, Abbot
Kinney Boulevard for mid-century furniture, Rodeo Drive for bejeweled
baubles. Destination bookshops like Hennessey &amp; Ingalls and Heritage
are also on our side. I challenge you to name something we can't buy
over here, something anyone would want, that is. (I'll pass on the
Los Angeles Zoo souvenir cap, thank you.)</TE>
<TE>   Christopher: Remember on "Let's Make a Deal" when Monty Hall's
evil twin Melvin locked all the doors and everyone was trapped with
piles of crappy appliances and an unruly goat? That's Westside
shopping. Over here we're happy the retail goliaths are close enough
to visit but far enough away that they don't devour our souls.
Instead we've got the best local clothing designers (Sirens &amp;
Sailors, Andrew Dibbens), great flea markets and botanicas and entire
districts devoted to jewelry, toys, flowers and fabric.</TE>
<TE>   Round 8: Night Life</TE>
<TE>   Is the Westside a black hole after dark?</TE>
<TE>   Christopher: Yet again, your feeble attempts to measure up barely
merit mention. Night life on the Westside? After you've lapped up a
lite beer at a seaside sports bar, the picking is thin, which is why
so many of you flee 310 when night falls. Hollywood's Cahuenga
Corridor alone contains a city's worth of great spots (Daddy's, Deep,
Star Shoes). Meanwhile there are plenty more great bars (the Red
Lion, the Bigfoot Lodge), superior venues for concerts and plays (the
El Rey, the Wiltern, the Pantages), a wide selection of comedy clubs
(the Groundlings, the Laugh Factory, the Hollywood Improv) and a
teeming dance scene that includes everything from flashy flamenco at
the Mayan to ecstatic electronic at Circus Disco. Bottom line? The
only sure-fire way to have a great night on the Westside is to spend
the first part of it driving east.</TE>
<TE>   Leslee: I'm going to teach you some respect. We don't wanna drive
east, and we don't have to. Why bother when the Troubadour, the Viper
Room, the Roxy, the Mint, Harvelle's, McCabe's, the Jazz Bakery,
Circle Bar, Largo, Sugar, plus all the boys' clubs are over here?
There's also all sorts of free, fun p.m. activities like the Santa
Monica Pier summer music series, grunion watching and the Friday
night skate through Santa Monica. As for those three comedy clubs you
mentioned, I'd say they belong to us. Nice try, Boom Boom.</TE>
<TE>   Round 9: Air</TE>
<TE>   How do Eastsiders breathe?</TE>
<TE>   Leslee: You want to lay claim to something? How about being the
birthplace of smog, 60-plus years ago. Congratulations. And you're
still--cough--going strong. Might as well enjoy a celebratory smoke.
The damage is already done.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher: To hear Westsiders tell it, perfumed breezes west of
the 405 Freeway carry magic fairy dust and the Eastside is an
industrial ghetto downwind from Chernobyl. Try to get this into your
sun-scorched head: Our air is not that bad. And yours is not that
good.</TE>
<TE>   Round 10: Public Radio</TE>
<TE>   Is Westside public radio more than the bloated pet of moneyed
liberals?</TE>
<TE>   Christopher: There's no better example of the vast chasm between
the East- and Westsides than the difference between our public radio
stations. Admittedly, most of us listen to Santa Monica-based KCRW-FM
(89.9) as much as we do to Pasadena-based KPCC-FM (89.3). But we're
constantly reminded of--and deeply irritated by--how much KCRW
exemplifies the Westside.</TE>
<TE>   Slick, calculated and stinking of liberal entitlement, KCRW feels
less like a public resource than a lifestyle accessory for the Range
Rover mommies sipping Starbucks on Montana Avenue before spinning
class. Sure, none of our public radio stations can touch KCRW when it
comes to funding or original programming. But we much prefer KPCC's
earnest "Air Talk" over more insufferable nagging from KCRW station
manager Ruth Seymour, endless cheesy promos for lavish trips we'll
never take or yet another awkward interview with a French
"turntablist" or some such on "Morning Becomes Eclectic."</TE>
<TE>   Leslee: First off, those Range Rover mommies aren't listening to
the radio. They're talking on their cell phones, stupid. Now that
that's cleared up, back to battle. No doubt Seymour could never find
work as a 976 operator. The silken purr eludes her. But she has
managed to assemble a mighty team of smart hosts such as Warren Olney
and dope DJs like Garth Trinidad, making KCRW the best-known public
radio station in the country. Besides, her voice is seldom heard.
Alas, the same can't be said about Kitty Felde--whose name is
"Kitty," anyway?--KPCC's interminably cheery afternoon host with the
irrepressible giggle. Larry Mantle of "Air Talk" is another matter.
He just might be the Eastside's best feature. And that's all the love
you're getting.</TE>
<TE>   Round 11: Basics</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to important services like medical care and schools,
is the Eastside lacking?</TE>
<TE>   Leslee: Ready for a face full of mat? 'Cause you're going down.
And when you do, you'll be needing an M.D. Who you gonna call? Your
Westside doc. You know the one--he's right down the street from your
Westside dentist, at places likes UCLA, Cedars-Sinai, St. John's. You
have Kaiser. Our schools are also superior. In Santa Monica, Beverly
Hills, Malibu, the Pacific Palisades, Topanga and parts of West Los
Angeles, the public schools are actually draws. With few exceptions,
your dilapidated mills of lowest-common-denominator learning simply
can't compete. And we're not even talking about the Brentwoods and
Crossroads, Harvard-Westlakes and Marymounts. When it comes to the
stuff that really matters, your 'hood is about as attractive as a
half-used bar of soap in a gas station john.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher: Overexposure to the sun has apparently done more than
add years to your face. That's the expert opinion of physicians from
all over the Eastside, from Childrens Hospital to Good Samaritan
(where Westside heroine Madonna delivered her last baby, by the way).
And while you seem certain the only good education is an expensive
one, students at excellent public and private Eastside schools like
Ivanhoe, 3rd Street Elementary, the Oaks and Temple Israel know
better.</TE>
<TE>   Round 12: Housing</TE>
<TE>   Do Westsiders pay more for less?</TE>
<TE>   Christopher: There's one main reason why the Westside is so
completely outclassed by the East: housing. Checked out any open
houses in Santa Monica lately? The idea of a million-dollar stucco
bungalow built for factory-floor aerospace workers would be laughable
if it wasn't so depressing. For about half that fortune you can buy a
Victorian mansion in Highland Park, a spacious Spanish in Eagle Rock
or a landmark modern in Silver Lake. And while West L.A. working
stiffs don't think twice forking over a third of their income in
rent, less affluent Eastsiders live like royalty in grand Wilshire
district townhouses or Los Feliz duplexes. The variety and
affordability mean a broader range of people live and work here,
which makes life far more interesting for all of us.</TE>
<TE>   Leslee: You know why people pay a premium to live on the Westside?
Because it's worth it. I'm sorry your envy has made you so angry. I
think there's a place for rent down the street. You can call me for
the details. I promise I won't tell a soul.</TE>

<HD>It's Tough Knowing Where to Draw the East-West Line</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER NOXON and LESLEE KOMAIKO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Feliz native Jeff Bey lives by a strict personal code: Never
venture west of Highland. "I avoid the Westside like the plague,"
says Bey, who owns Hollywood Billiards and Silver Lake's Cafe
Tropical. "I just don't have a visa for that part of town."</LD>
<LD>   West L.A. resident Brian Lewis knows he's on the Eastside when he
crosses La Cienega Boulevard--not that he approves of such
distinctions. "I prefer not to think of Balkanistic boundaries for
our city," says Lewis, editor of the Los Angeles Independent
Newspaper group.</LD>
<LD>   Such good intentions aside, most Angelenos have a habit of
dividing the city into east and west. We do so for all sorts of
reasons: to claim allegiance with our community, to draw a line
between ourselves and others and simply to make sense of a sprawling,
borderless metropolis. The boundary divides social circuits and
political districts, even gang affiliations.</LD>
<TE>   There's just one problem: No one can agree where the border falls.
Depending on whom you ask, the boundary between Eastside and Westside
falls as far west as the 405 Freeway or as far east as downtown L.A.
Some draw a jagged line that cuts back and forth like broken glass.
Some describe a border that shifts according to the time of day.
Others insist upon a central buffer zone that counts as neither east
nor west.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing everyone can agree on is that the Westside starts
at the ocean and continues through at least Brentwood. West Hollywood
masseuse Penny Compton says she's always thought of the Eastside as
starting at La Cienega. Venice-based real estate agent Deborah
Glusker puts the boundary at Laurel Canyon, which turns into Crescent
Heights Boulevard in West Hollywood. Many put the boundary at La Brea
Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles City Councilman Jack Weiss, whose 5th District
straddles neighborhoods claimed as east and west, draws the line at
Highland Avenue. It's a matter, he says, of pure self-determination.
"I think most people in the Fairfax district think of themselves as
Westsiders and most people in Hancock Park think of themselves as
Eastsiders," he says. "Highland is what separates them."</TE>
<TE>   Club owner and die-hard Eastsider Mitchell Frank says the line
moves from La Brea to Western Avenue when the sun goes down. "You
never want to go past Western at night," he says. "But during the
day, it's fine to go into Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   Historically, the border fell on the eastern edge of downtown,
along the banks of the Los Angeles River. Retired record shop owner
Esther Wapner Arbeitel recalls growing up near downtown's Temple
Street and thinking of Boyle Heights as the Eastside. And in the
early days of the city, Western Avenue, which cuts through
neighborhoods now thought of as the core of the Eastside,
marked--what else?--the western edge of the city.</TE>
<TE>   The division is most complicated in East Hollywood, Los Feliz,
Silver Lake and Echo Park, areas commonly thought of as the Eastside.
Though some locals cling to the Eastsider label as a badge of honor,
many Latino neighbors describe themselves in different terms. Jose
Almarez lives in Silver Lake, and he thinks the Eastside starts where
Sunset Boulevard becomes Cesar E. Chavez Avenue, at the downtown
intersection with Figueroa Street.</TE>
<TE>   This is no casual distinction for Almarez. He feels so strongly
about the subject that he tattooed his neighborhood on the back of
his neck: "West Los Angeles."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just across from Sparks Woodfire Cooking on Ventura Boulevard is this
new Studio City destination: an ivy-covered building with only the
discreet presence of a valet station and a tiled doorstep to mark the
location of Firefly.</LD>
<LD>   Inside is a dimly lighted bar furnished with burnt-orange velvet
couches. The walls are covered in books, only it's too dark to read.
Don't pack your Itty Bitty Book Light because they're a strange
collection of Reader's Digest compilations, old law books, matched
sets of this and that, along with the odd novel, such as "Scarlett,"
a sequel to "Gone With the Wind."</LD>
<LD>   Off the bar is the surprising dining room. Once a patio, it's
lined with cabanas framed in muslin curtains. More tables are grouped
around a fireplace in the middle of the room. On the walls, pierced
brass sconces cast a lacework of light to create a setting that could
be titled "Lawrence of Arabia Meets Met Home."</LD>
<TE>   Firefly's menu is short and not very ambitious, but in this
context, that's definitely a plus. The place is more bar and social
scene anyway, but also somewhere to get a bite to eat or have dinner
with friends. The setting with that fireplace and the cabanas
definitely invites lingering.</TE>
<TE>   Dinner starts out with crusty, fresh-from-the-oven La Brea Bakery
bread. A bottle of red from the eclectic wine list cries out for a
charcuterie platter to start. Priced by the person (an order for two
is plenty for four to share), it includes thinly sliced salami, coppa
and pale pink ham, with some charred roasted peppers, Nicoise olives
and cornichons heaped in the middle. Nothing could be simpler or more
satisfying.</TE>
<TE>   And that's all it takes for one of my guests to declare himself a
fan of Firefly. By the time he tastes the sauteed sausages and
peppers, another appetizer, he's infatuated. The straightforward
saute is a homey dish of good ingredients simply prepared. It doesn't
take a genius cook; that's the beauty of it. And that's what's so
smart about Firefly's menu. It's doable.</TE>
<TE>   Mussels steamed in vermouth with shallots are delicious too,
served with their reduced juices on a plate instead of the usual
bowl. This appetizer would make a good light supper entree, too.</TE>
<TE>   All is delightful until we hit the main courses. The best thing
about the skewered shrimp are the skinny pommes frites that come with
them. Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to slather the
pancetta-wrapped shrimp in an oily caper sauce. They're better off
naked. The burger is a baroque construction of beef, bleu cheese and
avocado on a firm, chewy bun that makes eating it something of a feat
without knife and fork. My croque monsieur doesn't need cheese on
both the inside and the outside. I'm left wondering what happened to
the sense and sensibility of the first courses.</TE>
<TE>   Those missteps aside, all that's needed is some tinkering with the
menu to make Firefly a bona fide hit. It's hip, it's reasonably
priced, and it's open late. In the Valley, at least, there's nothing
like it.</TE>
<TE>   Firefly, 11720 Ventura Blvd., Studio City; (818) 762-1833. Open
for dinner only, Monday-Saturday, 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. Appetizers $4 to
$10; main courses $10 to $18. Valet parking.</TE>

<HD>Sosa's Worldly Recipe a Diverse Treat</HD>

<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pianist Omar Sosa's appearance at the Jazz Bakery this week is
subtitled "The Soul of Cuban Jazz." But that's a label that only
partly describes the kaleidoscopic sounds and rhythms surging from
the stage on Tuesday in the opening-night set from Sosa and his
septet.</LD>
<LD>   Cuban elements were present in abundance, from Sosa's surging
tumbaos and singer Martha Galarraga's steadfast clave playing to a
flowing array of body-moving salsa rhythms and sweetly harmonized
boleros.</LD>
<LD>   Sosa, who was born in Camaguey in 1965, started out as a
percussionist, somehow picking up enough piano skills along the way
to become a masterful performer of that instrument too. But his
visceral understanding of the full range of Cuban rhythms never went
away, investing his piano playing with a rich stylistic diversity and
a passionate emotional expressiveness.</LD>
<TE>   Sosa's American albums, issued since he moved to San Francisco in
1995 (he recently relocated to Barcelona, Spain), have been
extraordinarily diverse, embracing solo piano, duets with
percussionists, large ensembles and the septet instrumentation that
surfaced at the Bakery. With each release, he expanded his musical
horizons, starting with generic Cuban styles and gradually reaching
out into other music of the world.</TE>
<TE>   The septet he brought to the Bakery typified that global reach
with personnel that included Cuban and American musicians as well as
rapper Brutha Los, Venezuelan percussionist Gustavo Ovalles and
Moroccan violinist-vocalist Bouchaib Abdelhadi. And the music--much
of it from Sosa's new album, "Sentir"--was similarly eclectic.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning with the incantatory "Opening for Eleggua," with its
Yoruban spiritual references, the music continued in persistently
blended fashion. Abdelhadi's sweet-sounding, Middle Eastern-inflected
vocals were juxtaposed against Los' poetic rapping. Sosa dipped in
and out of the sort of rhapsodic pianistics associated with Ruben
Gonzalez, the driving arpeggios of McCoy Tyner and the offbeat
accents of Thelonious Monk. At times as many as six players performed
simultaneously on various percussion instruments, layering American
backbeats, Moroccan rhythms and a collective sense of swing over the
Cuban clave.</TE>
<TE>   There were a few passive moments in which a sprinkling of New Age
qualities became a bit too dominant. But for the most part, Sosa's
performance was an extraordinary example of state-of-the-art world
jazz, splendidly illustrating how entrancing the music can become
when it is open and receptive to global input and interaction.</TE>
<TE>   The Omar Sosa Septet at the Jazz Bakery, 3233 Helms Ave. Tonight
through Sunday at 8 and 9:30 p.m. $25. (310) 271-9039.</TE>

<HD>To Activists, Every Day Should Be Earth Day</HD>
<DH>Concerts and cleanups will mark the event, but it's often
the more mundane things that count.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In honor of Earth Day 2002, Jennifer Scott-Lifland wishes everyone
would visit a dump for an eye-opening experience.</LD>
<LD>   "If everyone saw all that trash and waste, they might begin to
realize how little actions can have big effects," says Scott-Lifland,
a certified arborist for TreePeople.</LD>
<LD>   If there's a universal lesson to teach kids on Earth Day, leaders
from local environmental groups agree, that's it: Small changes add
up to big differences. This weekend, activities ranging from concerts
to beach cleanups will mark the 32nd anniversary of Earth Day. But
just as important, these environmentalist say, are the examples
adults set every day.</LD>
<TE>   Founded in 1970 by U.S. Sen. Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin, Earth
Day started as a nationwide environmental protest to draw attention
to industrial pollution and conservation issues. It was part of the
political movement that led to the creation of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, and the passage of the Clean Air, Clean Water and
Endangered Species acts.</TE>
<TE>   Scott-Lifland, who regularly meets with schoolchildren to talk
about ecology, says youngsters sometimes have already absorbed
save-the-planet ideas. "Little kids seem to get this, but it's the
parents who oftentimes need the education," she says. "Many people
think it's too much work."</TE>
<TE>   Conservation doesn't have to be complicated, time-consuming or
costly. Just go back to the basics: Take only what you need and clean
up after yourself. And it's easy to involve young ones in the effort.</TE>
<TE>   "Tell kids not to leave the water running when they brush their
teeth, wash their faces or play in the pool," says Hallie Jones of
Heal the Bay. "And always sweep instead of hosing down the sidewalk."</TE>
<TE>   L.A.'s 250,000 storm drains are a major source of water pollution
in the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever goes in here flows out there," Jones says. "We need
everyone to pick up after their pet so dangerous bacterium doesn't
get into the water system. And if you see a gutter drain clogged with
trash, take a moment to clear it up."</TE>
<TE>   To reduce local landfills, Jones stresses reuse of materials.
Kids' lunches are full of disposable plastic bags and over-packaged
foods. "Why not pack lunches and other items in reusable containers
like Tupperware? Think of what you'll save not buying Baggies."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, eco-changes can be a cost-effective benefit to the
environment, says Lori Shimonishi of the Coalition for Clean Air.
Turning off light switches, TVs and computers is an important lesson
to learn and also saves money. "Switch from incandescent lightbulbs
to compact fluorescent ones," she also suggests, explaining that one
15-watt fluorescent bulb is comparable to a 60-watt incandescent one.
"You're going to use less energy, have a reduced electric bill, and
these bulbs last seven to nine years."</TE>
<TE>   Although today's youngsters might have more of an eco-edge than
their parents, they still need adults to be good examples. Parents
can demonstrate clean-air behavior by tuning up engines, carpooling,
not topping off gas tanks, and even seeking out dry cleaners that use
less harmful "wet-cleaning" chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way kids are going to see an appreciation of the
environment is for adults--parents and teachers--to show them
nature," says Martin Schlageter of the Sierra Club. Children and
young adults need to have firsthand experience with Mother Earth.</TE>
<TE>   Hike through the surrounding wilderness areas, beaches and
mountains of Southern California, suggests Schlageter, then "come
back home and realize that your home is part of the natural
environment around you."</TE>
<TE>   "Landscape with native plants instead of plants that need lots of
water. Compost your yard trimmings. Plant a garden. Be aware of all
the living things right in your backyard or park."</TE>
<TE>   Scott-Lifland agrees, adding that despite its concrete reputation,
Los Angeles is an urban forest, bustling with trees, shrubbery and
wildlife--assets we should all care for every day, not just on Earth
Day.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't wait or think it's someone else's job," she says. "If you
see, for example, a little street tree that's not looking so hot, go
over and give it some water, cut it back, help it. Our Earth, much
less our trees, needs champions. Let's all be those champions."</TE>

<LD>* The painter, whose photo-realistic, cartoon-like works appeared in
MOCA's 1991 "Helter Skelter" show, has an anthology of his
underground comics coming out later this year, "Hysteria and
Remission."</LD>
<LD>   American Food: Over on Pico Boulevard, just west of La Cienega,
there's a lunch and breakfast place called Nick's Coffee Shop. It's
been there since 1946. It's like an old American, classic, Norman
Rockwell diner--and those are really hard to find. It's always
crowded and the food is exceptional and, of course, it's high in
cholesterol. You know these are the things that make life dangerous.
You pay for your indulgences.</LD>
<LD>   No Wine Left: On the weekends, I go every so often to Bergamot
Station in Santa Monica and hit all the galleries there, but there
are favorites like Track 16, Patrick Painter Inc., Rosamund Felsen
and Robert Berman. The openings there in the last year or two have
been so intense, you can't even get a car on the parking lot. So I'll
catch those shows sometimes on a day of the week when it's not their
openings.</LD>
<TE>   The Red Baron: At Van Nuys Airport, there's a restaurant right on
the edge of it called the 94th Aero Squadron, and the whole place
looks likes a movie prop from the First World War. It looks like a
French chateau that's been bombed. In other words, the roof is
knocked out in places and there are sandbags, artillery gun
emplacements and World War I fighting planes sitting around it.</TE>
<TE>   No-Tell Motel: Sometimes when we travel, we like to go to rundown
old motels, so me and my wife, Suzanne, can play like we're young
again, have secret affairs and stuff.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Parking: I've got this closet life of being a hot rodder.
That opens up a whole different avenue of entertainment on the
weekends. The premier place in L.A. on Friday nights is Bob's Big Boy
on Riverside Drive in Toluca Lake. Bob's Big Boy was built in 1949
and it's a historical monument. Plus you've got this colorful group
of people hanging out there that vary from hot rodders to muscle car
builders to Hells Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Hot rodding: I have two '72 Fords and my wife has a '34 Ford and
'57 T-Bird. I like to go for a drive up on Mulholland or over on
Sepulveda next to the 405. There's other small two-lane roads in the
Valley where I can go out and drive late at night. It's really fun to
take a hot rod out on an old lonely road and open it up. It's very
infantile, but it's a great pleasure.</TE>

<LD>Many modern playwrights seem fixated on plumbing society's lower
depths, dredging up as much angst, anger and amorality as they can,
then wallowing in the subterranean squalor.</LD>
<LD>   The in-your-face dramas that typically result can seem
depressingly rote. "Den of Thieves" at the Black Dahlia Theatre has
subterranean squalor aplenty, lots of gritty language and the
requisite bevy of desperate losers. However, if you thought this West
Coast premiere of Stephen Adly Guirgis' play was going to puddle
along the same familiar sewer, think again.</LD>
<LD>   Guirgis, who has recently generated a fair amount of heat with
productions of his play "Jesus Hopped the 'A' Train" at London's
Donmar Warehouse and Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre, defies
expectations with his tale of criminally minded New York City
have-nots involved in an ill-considered heist. Of course, the heist
goes disastrously awry, the mob gets miffed, and vengeance looms.
Although it ultimately softens into a farfetched happy ending, the
story unfolds with crackling comic propulsion and a screwball
sweetness as unexpected as it is welcome.</LD>
<TE>   As the action opens, the compulsive and depressed Maggie (Ana
Ortiz) is getting an emergency pep talk from Paul (Russell G. Jones),
her 12-step sponsor. A recovering klepto and overeater, Maggie has
just stolen a backpack full of junk food. Paul, himself in recovery
for just about everything, is pleading with Maggie to relinquish her
ill-gotten Yodels when Flaco (Trevor Long), Maggie's crack-fueled ex,
bursts onto the scene with a supposedly sure-fire scheme to rob an
area disco.</TE>
<TE>   The criminal quartet, which includes Flaco's hard-bodied new
floozy, Boochie (Elizabeth Rodriguez), runs immediately afoul of Lou,
a.k.a. Little Tuna (Marco Greco), a reluctant mobster whose
crime-lord father, Big Tuna (Ronald Hunter), is out of town. Sadistic
Sal (Bruno Gioiello), Lou's cousin and underling, is itching to
murder the entire gang. However, soft-hearted Lou, who needs a body
(and three thumbs) to satisfy his father's sanguinary expectations,
decides to kill only one--the victim to be determined by the crooks
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy on the exposition, the chatty first act sets up the
explosively funny second act, which opens with a hilarious sight gag
that establishes the tone for the rest of the show.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Shakman, who helmed last season's award-winning "Orson's
Shadow," proves once again that he is a formidable actor's director
with a keen sense of comic rhythm. With the exception of Ortiz, an
appealing actress who nonetheless seems overly subdued and glum in
this context, the performers go gleefully over the top in pursuit of
laughs.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Hanson's set, which starts out as a tiny tenement apartment,
then deepens into a spacious nightclub lobby, is yet another
impressive aspect of this thoroughly impressive production.</TE>
<TE>   "Den of Thieves," Black Dahlia Theatre, 5453 W. Pico Blvd., Los
Angeles. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends May 5.
$15. (323) 525-0070. Running time: 1 hour, 40 minutes.</TE>

<HD>Jazz Returns to the Wee Hours</HD>
<DH>The new Rocco, in a former refrigerator store on Santa
Monica Boulevard, offers die-hard audiences jam sessions late into
the night.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jazz clubs, no matter where you find them--a former bakery in Culver
City, a New York knitting factory or the cellar-dwelling Village
Vanguard--have one consistency: late-night sets
and--sometimes--early-morning jam sessions.</LD>
<LD>   Those hours aren't exactly prime time for Los Angeles'
entertainment scene, save a few after-hours dance clubs. Jazz fans
yearning--or just willing--to experience the music in that original,
late-night tradition now have the new Rocco--the second installment
of the venue that established Rocco Somazzi as a jazz club owner
before he turned 30.</LD>
<LD>   The original Rocco, an elegant jazz performance room and supper
club, ran into the high cost of doing business at the top of Beverly
Glen. Despite the room's popularity with listeners and musicians, it
was shut down in December 1999.</LD>
<TE>   When Somazzi decided to open the new Rocco on a schedule that ran
from 10 p.m. into the post-midnight hours--an after-hours jazz room,
by most definitions--there were few willing to bet on its success.
His odds got longer when he debuted the room nine months ago without
the safety net of a liquor license, in a stretch of Santa Monica
Boulevard just west of Vine Street that can be generously described
as a dramatic change from the original Rocco.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't sure what I was going to do after I closed the original
club," Somazzi says. "And I actually found this space through a
writer named Rick Pagano who was looking for a space to produce a
play. After he found this room--which had been a refrigerator
store--he came to me to talk about creating a theater cafe, and we
started developing the concept together. But we only did a small
amount of theater in the beginning, and then became primarily a music
room."</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, Rocco's after-hours performance schedule became
a necessity; the building complex includes two other theater stages
well within acoustic reach. There's still no liquor license, but soon
you'll be able to order sandwiches and salads in addition to coffee,
soda and pastries.</TE>
<TE>   The late-night schedule has given Rocco a unique cache among local
jazz venues. The room is reminiscent of a 1960s Greenwich Village
coffeehouse, with its mixture of comfortable couches, tables and
chairs, and a rotating selection of paintings. The decor and hours
capture just the right feel for the sort of far-ranging, eclectic
programming provided by music director Matt Piper.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Friday evening, for example, Seattle's Jessica Lurie
Sextet--featuring a rare front line of two female
saxophonists--brought a provocative sampling of the intrepid jazz
varieties surfacing outside New York and L.A. A sampling of recent
intriguing bookings includes keyboardist Andy Milne's superlative
ensemble from New York, James Carney's exploratory trio, Bulgarian
singer Tzvetanka Varimezov, and a rare full day of electronic and
ambient music.</TE>
<TE>   Call it a spicy enhancement of your typical jazz club menu.</TE>
<TE>   "The focus has definitely shifted from the original Rocco's,"
Piper says. "What we're trying to do is emphasize music that I
believe is really in the moment--music by performers who are jazz
informed or classically informed but who are all aware of what's
going on around them in other music, including pop, rock, world music
and beyond."</TE>
<TE>   The audience for this kind of diverse booking is probably as
wide-ranging as the programs. Any given night at Rocco--even for the
most musically far-out programming--listeners range from teenagers to
senior citizens. But the vibe, regardless of age, seems to be the
same--folks in search of a laid-back atmosphere where they can
experience compelling and adventurous music.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're trying to do," says Piper, "is build a sense of
community and make the room an artistic hub. Ideally, we're
attracting people who are willing to relax, close their eyes and open
their ears and their minds. There's not usually a lot of talking
during our performances because people just seem to dig zoning out
for an hour and taking in what we have to offer."</TE>
<TE>   Rocco, 6320 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood, (323) 804-4146.
Tonight, pianist James Carney's trio; Friday, shakuhachi player
Philip Gelb's quartet; Saturday, violinist Jeff Gauthier's Goatette.

<HD>Nick Cave's Laments Still Prove to Be Enthralling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It seems probable that most people going to see Nick Cave &amp; the Bad
Seeds at the Wiltern Theatre on Tuesday knew exactly what they were
going to get. There were tormented dirges, relieved by the occasional
rueful lament. There was Cave, the lanky Australian, delivering fire
and brimstone with a fury that would take Elmer Gantry aback. It was
essentially what Cave has been doing since forming this band nearly
20 years ago. And yet at the end of the evening--the first of two
nights at the Wiltern for Cave--the wild applause that brought the
musicians back for an apparently unplanned second encore was
justified. As predictable as the concert was, it was frequently
enthralling.</LD>
<LD>   Touring with the Seeds for the first time since 1998, Cave made
the most of the backing, guiding the band (featuring longtime Seeds
guitarists Blixa Bargeld and Mick Harvey, with Dirty Three violinist
Warren Ellis now also on board) through several cycles of dark
marches, sorrowful ballads and manic peaks. There's no better setting
for the thorny roses of his vivid Gothic narratives--Yeats pulled
through Flannery O'Connor.</LD>
<LD>   Songs from last year's "No More Shall We Part," though of an
emotional piece with the rest of his canon, expand and refine the
formula, tempering the spiritual despair with an at least nominal
belief in love.</LD>
<TE>   But it's something of a tease: With "Fifteen Feet of Pure White
Snow," he attacked the smothering evil of naive goodness, and in "God
Is In the House," a lilting piano ballad, he mocked the hypocrisy of
false piety, his voice barbed with sarcastic bile. And with the new
album's title song, which closed the regular set following "The Mercy
Seat," his signature first-person tale of a defiant murderer in the
electric chair, even death did not provide release.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps someday Cave will reveal amid the death and depression a
way to redemption. He didn't Tuesday, really. But it will be worth
coming back to find out if he ever does.</TE>

<LD>   Side Show--The title of this play is appropriately double-layered.
The musical's protagonists, Daisy and Violet, are forever side by
side, as Siamese twins joined at the hip. And they're discovered in a
tawdry Depression-era side show. In the course of the musical, they
join classier show business circles, yet they learn that it's
impossible to fully transcend their roots.</LD>
<LD>   Daisy and Violet are presented as individuals who must cope with
the elusive concepts of how to define themselves and their ties to
other human beings. These are not esoteric subjects. The women's
position is a metaphor for universal human concerns. However, we soon
learn that they have issues dividing them. Daisy wants to be famous;
Violet wants a husband and children. Librettist-lyricist Bill Russell
tells their story simply, allowing the ironies and the larger
metaphor to emerge without forcing the issue.</LD>

<LD>DVD</LD>
<LD>   Elmo's World: Springtime Fun! Sony Wonder. 50 minutes. VHS: $10.
DVD: $17. Ages 2 to 5.</LD>
<LD>   Elmo, the sunny and adorable little red Muppet child, is the
perfect guide to birds, bikes and bugs in this compilation of shows
with playful themes that fit the season. In Elmo's simple,
crayon-drawn world, ducklings hatch, the "Bird Channel" demonstrates
a "chicken dance," kids are shown learning how to ride bikes, and all
manner of creepy crawlies make an appearance. Elmo doesn't do it
alone: He gets help from his pet goldfish Dorothy, his computer, desk
drawer and window shade, a host of Muppet critters, vaudeville-style
bits with Mr. Noodle (Michael Jeter), real babies and short animated
and live-action films. Each episode includes simple, play-along
guessing games. (No added DVD features.)</LD>
<TE>   Real Wheels: Truck Adventures. Warner Home Video. 90 minutes. DVD:
$20. Ages 3 to 8.</TE>
<TE>   Kids who can't get enough vehicle-viewing can see three
truck-centric videos from the "Real Wheels" series--"There Goes a
Truck," "There Goes a Garbage Truck" and "There Goes a Fire
Truck"--in this first DVD release. Goofy host Dave (who tries a bit
too hard to be funny) and his sometime sidekick Becky get behind the
wheel themselves and show film of real truck drivers and
firefighters, plus the insides and outsides of 18-wheelers, moving
vans, garbage trucks, logging trucks, fire engines and more.</TE>
<TE>   DVD extras include a ho-hum "Blooper" reel (the trucks, not Dave,
are the draw), a sing-along truck song, an interactive firetruck tour
and an interactive glossary--kids click on parts of the firetruck for
a close-up look and click on words for video descriptions.</TE>

<HD>A Better Understanding of His Country</HD>
<DH>Cambodia's Rithy Panh explores a land of survivors via
film.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JODY McPHILLIPS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rithy Panh wants to understand how a man could pull out another man's
fingernails, or apply an electric shock to his genitals, or dunk him
in a vat of water until his lungs are bursting.</LD>
<LD>   All this happened at the S-21 interrogation center in Phnom Penh,
Cambodia, during the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime between 1975 and
1979. More than 16,000 inmates of S-21 were later slaughtered at a
"killing field" south of the city.</LD>
<LD>   Panh knows a man who did such things. For the past seven years, he
has visited him three to four times a year with a documentary film
crew, each time asking, "Why?" He says he will not quit until he
understands, though he sometimes doubts that day will never come.</LD>
<TE>   "Sometimes I am strong; sometimes I get very upset. Sometimes I
talk to myself and say, 'Finish it now!' so I can go on to other
projects. But this is my work. I think it will take a very long time
to finish."</TE>
<TE>   Panh, a Khmer Rouge survivor, has produced a string of
internationally acclaimed films about Cambodia. He will attend a
retrospective of five of his films screening Friday to Sunday in
Claremont at Scripps and Pomona colleges. The events are co-sponsored
by the Pacific Basin Institute, Scripps Humanities Institute and
Pomona Media Studies.</TE>
<TE>   It will be the third U.S. visit for the director, who splits his
time between Cambodia and France. "I always like to talk to
students," he said. "They need to know what has happened in the
world."</TE>
<TE>   What happened in Cambodia during the Pol Pot regime--and what is
happening today--has obsessed Panh since he escaped the killing
fields in 1979 for sanctuary in France.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not a historian," he said. "But I was there in the Pol Pot
time, and I ask myself why I survived, and not my brother or my
sister or my mother" or the estimated 1.7 million who died of hunger,
disease or overwork, or were executed between 1975 and 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Films to be shown are "The Land of Wandering Souls" (1999), "One
Evening After the War" (1997), "Bophana, A Cambodian Tragedy" (1996),
"The Rice People" (1994) and "Site 2" (1985).</TE>
<TE>   The Cambodian film industry boomed in the 1960s, when King Norodom
Sihanouk directed a long string of engaging but forgettable
melodramas starring himself, his wife, his friends and the nation's
military hardware. The industry was destroyed during the Khmer Rouge
years, when an estimated 90% of the country's performing artists were
executed as exemplars of corrupt Western influence.</TE>
<TE>   In the past two years, a fledgling, revived industry has churned
out saccharine karaoke videos and at least two feature films: "Child
of the Giant Snake" and "Commander Damden," both entertaining but
rudimentary fantasy-adventures.</TE>
<TE>   Panh's exponentially more sophisticated work has not been seen
much in Cambodia, although that is beginning to change. The
documentary "Bophana" is the wrenching story of a couple imprisoned
at the S-21 interrogation center, where they were tortured and
eventually killed.</TE>
<TE>   The film includes rare Khmer Rouge propaganda footage showing
thousands of black-clad Cambodians performing essentially slave labor
as part of the regime's attempt to create an agrarian utopia. The
radical Maoists left extensive records of their activities--just like
the Nazis.</TE>
<TE>   Although the government held Panh at arm's length for years,
officials this year decided to allow "Bophana" to be shown twice
daily at Tuol Sleng, now a genocide museum and one of Phnom Penh's
top tourist attractions.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they understand what I am doing now," Panh said. "They
understand that I am not interested in using this material in a
political way. I just want our children to become stronger and not be
ashamed of their past."</TE>
<TE>   While making his other movies, Panh has labored for the past
decade on the as-yet-untitled documentary that examines the Khmer
Rouge years from the perspectives of victims and perpetrators. More
than anything, he says, it explores the nature of memory.</TE>
<TE>   "For some people, perceptions change over time. Some didn't want
to examine [what had happened] at all at first. They would just say,
'I was following orders.' But when they understand and trust you,
they begin to cooperate with you.</TE>
<TE>   "I have only the experience of the survivor. I want to understand
the other side....It is hard to work with these people--very hard.
But I try to consider them as human beings first. I ask them to
remember the little things, the small details of daily life" that
illuminate the truth.</TE>
<TE>   For Panh, it is crucial that Cambodians confront those years, and
try to understand what happened to their country and how their own
actions fit into the bigger picture. "This work only the Cambodian
people can do, because it is our story," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no other choice. There is no other way. You can put it
off until tomorrow, but the questions will come back. I want to be a
normal person, a normal father. But in order to be that, I must face
this first.</TE>
<TE>   "For a long time, Cambodians tried to bury this. Now, when things
are going better, the ghosts come. Now they need to know how to talk
to their children about it. We cannot lie to them."</TE>
<TE>   It is imperative to learn from what happened in Cambodia in hopes
of heading off other disasters, like Rwanda or Bosnia, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to face history now if we want to find peace. I want to
face it for future generations. I want them to be proud, not ashamed.
And if we do not memorialize nearly 2 million people, we will be
ashamed."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, he dreams of the day when he will finish his project
and can move on.</TE>
<TE>   "I would really like to make something funny, something real and
funny" about life in modern Cambodia, he said. He tells a story about
his assistant, who loaded his wife and three watermelons on his
motorbike after a lunch washed down by many beers and set off over
one of Cambodia's notoriously bad roads.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving at his destination, he was asked, "Where's your wife?"
She had fallen off more than a mile back, and he had never noticed.
When he went back to get her, she was trudging along, lugging the
melons. Panh would like to capture that kind of resilience, that
doggedness, and show how humor leavens the hard lives of poor
Cambodians today.</TE>
<TE>   "We laugh every day. When we eat, when we move, we laugh. It is
hope for us. When life is difficult, we keep something very strong.
We have many problems, but people keep their sensibility.</TE>
<TE>   "It is good, very good."</TE>

<HD>'Book of the Dead' Jumbles Icons and Ideas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Left to us by the ancient Egyptians, the Book of the Dead is a
collection of prayers and charms meant to help souls navigate the
afterworld.</LD>
<LD>   Playwright Paul Mullin, who wrote the 1999 hit "Louis Slotin
Sonata," has taken that idea and combined it with beliefs about
reincarnation and events from American history to come up with "An
American Book of the Dead, the Game Show." His intent, presumably, is
to guide the living through the responsibilities of being American.</LD>
<LD>   Or maybe not. The show is such a jumble of ideas, flimsily held
together within a game-show context, that it is difficult to know
exactly what he has in mind.</LD>
<TE>   Circle X Theatre Company soldiers on, however, with 16 actors and
much the same creative team that worked on "Louis Slotin Sonata,"
including co-directors Jim Anzide and Jonathan Westerberg.</TE>
<TE>   Theatergoers are treated as a game-show audience as the host
(Kevin Fabian) cheerfully pronounces everyone dead, then calls three
contestants (William Salyers, Rebecca Avery and Wendy Abas) to the
stage to vie for perfect enlightenment. They are sent off to
isolation booths--which are kitchen refrigerators in Gary Smoot's
cheeky game-show set design--to begin their search for understanding
during a series of reincarnations.</TE>
<TE>   From then on, the action fragments into a series of long-winded,
barely related skits.</TE>
<TE>   Harriet Tubman becomes wife to Stonewall Jackson, and they produce
the children Crispus Atticus, Emma Goldman, Audie Murphy and Molly
Pitcher, who become enmeshed in an unholy fusion of American wars.</TE>
<TE>   People are reborn into one another's lives while riding the No. 7
train to Flushing, Queens, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin listen in wonder to
a spontaneous, ecstatic '50s-era jazz performance by Louis Prima and
Keely Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Is Mullin trying to say that we must work together to achieve
enlightenment? Is he trying to indicate that insight comes mainly
through art? Perhaps while sitting here for nearly three hours--which
feels like several lifetimes--you'll figure it out. But don't count
on it.</TE>
<TE>   "An American Book of the Dead, the Game Show," Circle X Theatre
Company at the Met Theatre, 1089 N. Oxford Ave., Hollywood.
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends May 18. $15;
Sundays, pay what you can. (323) 461-6069. Running time: 2 hours, 50
minutes.</TE>

<LD>   Roth and Hagar: Unlikely Partners</LD>
<LD>   One of rock 'n' roll's oddest soap operas is taking a new twist:
David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar, two of the former lead singers of Van
Halen, are going to tour together now that the hugely popular rock
band has run aground.</LD>
<TE>   The event is billed as "Song for Song: The Heavyweight Champs of
Rock and Roll," a reference to Hagar's pugilist past and to Roth's
enthusiasm for martial arts. Roth, 47, and Hagar, 54, plan to hit the
road in May for a tour of the United States. Locally, the duo will
appear at the Universal Amphitheatre on June 24. No date for ticket
sales has been announced.</TE>
<TE>   The seeds for the tour were planted by Roth in 1996, just after
Hagar left the band. Though Hagar rebuffed him at the time, Roth
revived the idea a few months ago, despite having referred, over the
years, to the singer who replaced him in Van Halen as "a mediocre
talent," "a complete failure" and "a mindless little bridge-troll
drone."</TE>

<TE>   Grammer to Give Voice to Rodent on TNN</TE>
<TE>   The TNN cable channel has picked up six episodes of "Gary the
Rat," an animated series that Kelsey Grammer helped produce for the
Web site Mediatrip.com, and will run them in prime time next year in
conjunction with reruns of the old Nickelodeon cartoon "The Ren &amp;
Stimpy Show." Grammer supplies the voice of Gary, a New York attorney
who doesn't simply act like a rat--he turns into one.</TE>
<TE>   The network said it also has other adult animated series in
development, including one from Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee about
a superhero whose cover is working as a stripper and another from the
producers of "Rugrats" about the friendship between two immigrants, a
Russian and a Mexican, living in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, TNN is planning to unveil two original series this
summer: "Oblivious," described as a game show that uses hidden
cameras (so the contestants don't know they are contestants), and
"Slamball," a new team sport played on trampolines.</TE>

<TE>   'Saving the Silents' DVDs Due in 2004</TE>
<TE>   Rarely seen silent films will get a new lease on life from the
National Film Preservation Foundation, thanks to a $200,000 grant
from the National Endowment for the Humanities to produce three
"Saving the Silents" DVDs to be released in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Although the specific contents of the three anthologies have not
yet been chosen, they are expected to include rare features,
newsreels, documentaries, animation, one-reelers, serial episodes and
exhibitor reels. Each DVD will run up to three hours and will include
new musical accompaniments and scholarly notes.</TE>
<TE>   To complete the project, the foundation is beginning a campaign to
raise matching funds.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Actor Benjamin Bratt, who dated Julia Roberts for nearly four
years, married his "Pinero" co-star Talisa Soto in San Francisco last
Saturday.... Placido Domingo is developing a movie based on the life
of the composer Giacomo Puccini ("La Boheme," "Madame Butterfly") in
which he would star. His wife, Marta, has written the story and a
search is on to find a screenwriter for the project.... Pasadena's
Norton Simon Museum has launched a new Web site
(www.nortonsimon.org), featuring a catalog of nearly 1,000 works.</TE>

<LD>* New this week: "Texas Rangers" reduces the turbulent post-Civil War
history of the legendary law-and-order agency to the level of a
routine shoot-'em-up. The triteness of Scott Busby and Martin
Copeland's script is exceeded only by the flatness of Steve Miner's
direction. Real-life ranger Leander McNelly (a tight-lipped Dylan
McDermott), embittered by the kidnapping of his wife and three
children by bandits years earlier, recruits a group of men, including
James Van Der Beek and Ashton Kutcher, and after entirely predictable
developments and much carnage, the Rangers, of course, triumph. Only
Robert Patrick, as one of McNelly's right-hand men, manages to
transcend the glum circumstances to come alive and register some
personality and complexity. Any one of the half-hour episodes in the
old radio serial "Tales of the Texas Rangers," starring Joel McCrea,
or "The Lone Ranger" holds more interest than this 93-minute bore.</LD>

<HD>Carnage Becomes Expressive in Salute to Director John Woo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Woo made his mark as an action director with films that play
strong sentiments of loyalty and self-sacrifice against violence. Not
since Sam Peckinpah has anyone choreographed carnage to such stunning
effect. Woo has won international acclaim not only for himself, but
also for his frequent charismatic star, Chow Yun-Fat.</LD>
<LD>   In "Hard-Boiled: A Tribute to John Woo," American Cinematheque
presents a selection of films that put the Hong Kong director on the
map and established him in Hollywood. The series--which continues
through Sunday at the Egyptian in Hollywood--begins tonight at 7:30
p.m. with "A Better Tomorrow," high-style vintage (1986) Woo with a
premise that could well have been lifted from early Warner Bros.
films: One brother (Ti Lung) becomes a gangster, the other (Leslie
Cheung) a cop. It extols loyalty between friends in the tradition of
Howard Hawks. The film's success, however, rests on a well-developed
plot and three-dimensional characterizations. The central figure is
the older brother's former partner in crime (Chow), now destitute.
Followed by "A Better Tomorrow 2"(1987).</LD>
<TE>   "The Killer" (1989), Friday at 7:30 p.m., is an example of the
addictively supercharged Hong Kong cinema at its most outrageous. Woo
sets off a plot with more twists and turns than a drive up the city's
Victoria Peak with the simplest of premises: A hired killer (Chow)
takes one last job but accidentally blinds a nightclub singer (Sally
Yeh) in the cross-fire.A discussion follows with Woo, who will also
introduce the 9:45 p.m. second feature, "Hard-Boiled" (1992), also
with Chow, in which a gangster (Ti) is torn between his allegiance to
his rookie cop brother (Cheung) and his hit-man pal. It boasts a
bravura 45-minute shootout finale.</TE>
<TE>   The 1990 "Bullet in the Head" (Saturday at 5 p.m.), arguably Woo's
masterpiece, is a dynamic variation on "The Deer Hunter." At once an
epic adventure, war picture, gangster melodrama and buddy movie, it
features three petty Hong Kong crooks who in 1967 take off for
Vietnam, where wartime dangers are equaled only by the illicit
opportunities. Tony Leung, Jacky Cheung and Waise Lee star.
Afterward, Woo will discuss the film and introduce his 1997
"Face/Off," with John Travolta and Nicolas Cage, screening at 8:30
p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The series ends Sunday with a 5 p.m. double feature, "Once a
Thief" (1990) and an encore of "The Killer" (1989). In the first, Woo
adds comedy to his usual potent blend of sentiment and action to
create a terrific mix of slapstick and sophistication in which Chow,
Leslie Cheung and Cherie Chung star as big-league art thieves. (323)
466-FILM.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Zachary Hansen's "Killer Me," which screens today in the Method
Festival at 4:30 p.m. at the Playhouse 7 in Pasadena, is a striking
portrait of a young man, Joseph (George Foster), who alternates
between moments of the utmost tenderness with the lonely young girl
Anna (Christina Kew), who has worked up her courage to reach out to
him, and his impulses to strike out at others or himself. Joseph's
escalating turmoil is expressed eloquently by Foster's intensely
interior performance and by the dynamic camerawork of "The Blair
Witch Project's" audacious Neal Fredericks. Contributing crucially to
this ambitious film's unsettling impact are Kew's delicately shaded
portrayal, Arlan Boll's imaginative sound design and an eerie,
disturbing score by Hansen--he recorded it (and then distorted it) on
an old PXL 2000 sound camera. Amazingly, this beautifully realized
film cost $12,000. (626) 844-6500.</TE>

<TE>   The Los Angeles County Museum of Art's "Out of India: The Films of
Satyajit Ray" begins its final weekend tonight at 7:30 p.m. with the
1962 "Abhijaan" ("The Expedition"), one of the few films in the
series that did not receive an American release. A big hit on home
ground, it is not an easy picture: It takes a long time to gather
power and features a difficult protagonist, but it is ultimately so
affecting it is worth the effort.</TE>
<TE>   Set in Bihar, northwest of Bengal, sometime in the 1950s, it stars
Soumitra Chatterjee as Narsingh, a taxi driver whose cherished
vehicle is an elegant but shabby Chrysler touring car, circa 1930.
Narsingh is as impoverished as his fellow cabbies, but comes from an
old warrior family that feeds both his delusions of grandeur and his
frustrations. One day he impatiently and riskily overtakes a car on a
dirt road, not realizing it is a government vehicle carrying, among
others, his boss, who promptly fires him and rescinds his cab
driver's permit. He has no recourse but to take off to a new region.
On the way, in the dark of night, a middle-aged man, Sukhanram
(Charuprasash Ghosh), whose oxcart has overturned, flags him down.
Sukhanram is so grateful for a lift he promises Narsingh he will set
him up in his nearby town, get him a permit and provide him a place
to stay. Sukhanram takes his time in spelling out what he expects in
return. The way "Abhijaan" plays out is stunningly effective, and
Chatterjee delivers a selfless, far-reaching portrayal that manages
to surmount a rather too obvious wig and beard.</TE>
<TE>   Sharmila Tagore will introduce two important Ray films in which
she starred: the 1960 "Devi" ("The Goddess"), Friday at 7:30 p.m.,
and "Days and Nights in the Forest" (1970), Saturday at 7:30 p.m.
Prints of all three films were restored by the Academy of Motion
Pictures Arts and Sciences Archive. (323) 857-6010.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Rutenberg," a stirring saga of the man who built a hydroelectric
plant across the Jordan River in 1931, screens in the Israel Film
Festival Saturday at 7:30 p.m. at the Music Hall in Beverly Hills as
part of a retrospective of the films of director Eli Cohen. It's a
traditional, absorbing film biography, and clearly Pinchas Rutenberg
(1880-1942), a Russian Jewish emigre to Palestine, was a man of
unusual force of character who succeeded in getting Winston
Churchill's backing for his project. Menahse Noy's Rutenberg is a
brilliant, formal, self-absorbed man who had the ability to compel
the most recalcitrant worker to follow his lead. The crux of this
drama is how a man with a seeming limitless capacity to bend the will
of others for his purposes is gradually affected by the accidental
death of one of his most trusted workers. There will be repeat
screenings. (310) 274-6869.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Laemmle Theaters' Documentary Days 2002 continues with the
screening of J.T.S. Moore's witty "Revolution OS" Saturday and Sunday
at 10 a.m. at the Sunset 5 in West Hollywood. It charts a group of
self-described hackers' rebellion against Microsoft, and the creation
of Linux operating system and the Open Source movement. While the
fundamental issue of sharing information over the Internet in the
face of the monolithic Microsoft is clear enough, this film will be
better appreciated by more advanced computer users. Moore, however,
deserves credit for maintaining a brisk pace for his assembly of
articulate talking heads. (323) 848-3500. "Revolution OS" has 11 a.m.
screenings April 27 and 28 at the Monica 4-Plex in Santa Monica,
(310) 394-9741; May 4 and 5 at the Playhouse 7, (626) 844-6500; and
May 18 and 19 at the Lido in Newport Beach, (949) 6763-8351.</TE>

<TE>   On March 20, 1984, a thin but cheerful Andy Kaufman made what
would be his final public appearance, two months before his death
from cancer. The occasion was the premiere at the Nuart Theater of
"My Breakfast With Blassie," a spoof of "My Dinner With Andre"
conceived by Johnny Legend and Linda Lautrec, that would find Kaufman
meeting fabled wrestler Freddie Blassie at the long-gone Sambo's
coffee shop at 6th Street and Vermont Avenue in L.A. "My Breakfast
With Blassie" repeats Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. at the Egyptian along
with Lynne Margulies and Joe Orr's 1992 Kaufman documentary "I'm From
Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   Back in the '50s, when local TV was dominated by popular orchestra
programs and wrestling matches, ferocious Freddie Blassie,
self-proclaimed "King of Men," became a household name, a man whose
favorite put-down was "pencil-necked geek." Since Kaufman became
notorious for wrestling with women, it was only natural that an
acquaintance would spring up. Kaufman wears a neck brace, from having
been body-slammed by heavyweight champ Jerry Lawler on the David
Letterman show, and the massive Blassie arrives deeply tanned and
silver-haired, wearing a Hawaiian shirt, white trousers and gold
jewelry. They seem genuinely fond of each other, and their restaurant
conversation is sometimes funny and outrageous. Bob Zmuda gives the
film a welcome, if gross, jolt as a weirdo customer. "My Breakfast
With Blassie" is not exactly a thigh-slapper but is a record of two
distinctive personalities. There's a discussion between films with
Margulies, Legend and Zmuda. American Cinematheque: (323) 461-2020.</TE>

<TE>   When infomercials-maker Steven Dworman went through a painful
divorce and protracted custody battle, he decided he needed the
catharsis of making "Divorce: The Musical," a wholly inept and
unfunny business about an infomercials director (Dworman) who
attempts to win favor with his estranged 14-year-old daughter
(Anneliese van der Pol) by staging a musical in which she will star.
It opens Friday at the Aero in Santa Monica. (310) 395-4990.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. at Village at the Ed Gould Plaza,
Outfest will screen Christopher Muench's acclaimed "The Hours and
Times," about a four-day vacation Beatles manager Brian Epstein and
John Lennon took in 1963. Preceded by a 6:30 p.m. reception. (213)
480-7090.</TE>

<HD>New Life for 'Walking'</HD>
<DH>Opera Pacific's production of Jake Heggie's opera, a year
after it debuted in San Francisco, is more subtle and trusting and
should have a long run.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Dead Man Walking," Jake Heggie's opera, has legs. A year after its
premiere by the San Francisco Opera, it has now received a second
production by Opera Pacific, and Tuesday night the company easily
sold out the house for the first of five performances at the Orange
County Performing Arts Center. A live recording from San Francisco
has recently been released by Erato. Opera companies in the U.S. and
abroad are lining up to mount either the original or this new
production.</LD>
<LD>   It will take time, of course, to know just how long this opera's
legs will be, but short is not a safe bet. Thus far, it has brought
out the best in everyone involved in its performances. And Heggie's
work, based upon the best-selling book by Sister Helen Prejean (upon
which the film was also based), appears critic-proof. There is little
doubt that Joseph De Rocher, a convicted rapist and murderer, will
receive his fatal injection at the Louisiana State Prison a great
many more times on stage and then return for a well-earned standing
ovation.</LD>
<TE>   "Dead Man Walking" confronts capital punishment. Prejean is a
tireless opponent of the death penalty, and her book records the
spiritual journey she undertook in acting as a spiritual advisor to
De Rocher. Spiritual journeys are, of course, the business of opera,
as are politics, sex and violence. Heggie, and his librettist,
popular playwright Terrance McNally, have chosen their subject well.</TE>
<TE>   Opera Pacific reveals just how well. Leonard Foglia's new
production is less lavish than San Francisco's celebrated one, but it
trusts the opera more and reminds one of the movie less. The Broadway
director's first foray into opera was remarkably focused on the
moment, moved with fluid grace and presented the drama with clarity.
Michael McGarty's practical set did exactly what it needed to do in
order to suggest locations without fully re-creating them and thus
allowing the opera room for imagination. Jess Goldstein lighted it
with care.</TE>
<TE>   A second advantage to be found in Orange County is the taut,
dramatically sophisticated conducting by the company's music
director, John DeMain, who doesn't oversell the score's obvious
dramatic devices.</TE>
<TE>   And there is also the peculiar advantage of less star power. At
the premiere, Susan Graham's emotive performance practically elevated
Helen to the realm of a mythic character. This time, Kristine Jepson
(who was an alternate in San Francisco) was more ordinary in the most
human sense. Her moral dilemma was larger than her. Her need to
understand, and forgive, De Rocher included a subtle, unvoiced
undercurrent of sexual attraction, which made things all the more
interesting. She has a natural, fresh mezzo-soprano voice that only
enhanced her appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Everything about this production and performance that was
good--and that included John Packard and Frederica von Stade
repeating their authoritative portrayals of De Rocher and his mother,
along with many other fine performances--should supply confidence in
Heggie's music.</TE>
<TE>   Listening to the recording, examining the score and hearing an
excellent performance from a new perspective changes some first
impressions. I think the music is better, or at least more cannily
crafted, than many of us found it on first hearing. Heggie relies on
simplistic devices, such as a five-note Bernsteinian riff for De
Rocher and a spiritual tune he invents for Sister Helen. Everything
sounds familiar and is used in obvious ways that skirt a middle
ground between old-fashioned operatic models and feature-film
developmental devices.</TE>
<TE>   Heggie has the kind of sentimental popular touch that can't be
learned or faked. And the real genius of this opera is that, in its
quest to be loved, it makes love, not killing and not spiritual
enlightenment, its center. We feel sympathy for De Rocher, and we
also understand that he has to die. The operatic Sister Helen,
dispensing of love left and right, triumphs.</TE>
<TE>   The political slope to not take sides, though, is slippery, and
there was a lot of slipping and sliding Tuesday to justify a
feel-good opera about capital punishment. Heggie has the real Helen
Prejean's approval, and he brought her out to take a bow. In the
program booklet, a page about Prejean's Moratorium Campaign was
carefully worded to disguise the nun's position--but sign on to her
Web site, www.moratoriumcampaign .org, and get the real story.</TE>
<TE>   OCPAC moreover restricted moratorium petitioners to a point far
enough away from the entrance of the auditorium that only those opera
attendees who parked illegally in the shopping mall across the street
would encounter them. Meanwhile, I'm still trying to figure out for
whom Opera Pacific's tasteless "Dead Man Walking" T-shirt might be
intended. Sales did not seem brisk Tuesday. But ticket sales are
certainly no problem.</TE>
<TE>   "Dead Man Walking" repeats tonight, Friday and Saturday at 7:30
p.m., and Sunday at 2 p.m. (with Theodora Hanslowe singing the role
of Sister Helen on Friday and Sunday); $25-$175; Orange County
Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa; (800)
34-OPERA.</TE>

<LD>Where's the beef been? You might not want to know, but your health
could depend on it.</LD>
<LD>   As tonight's "Frontline" documentary, "Modern Meat" (9 p.m., KCET;
10 p.m., KVCR), demonstrates, most cattle nowadays spend only their
first six months grazing at home on the range. After that, they move
to a feedlot, where up to 100,000 can be held until they are ready
for high-speed slaughterhouses.</LD>
<LD>   The consequences of this industrialization are manifold. In the
meat producers' defense, to which this film rarely comes, beef is
more plentiful and considerably cheaper than it was 30 years ago. An
industry spokesman also says that corporate consolidation has allowed
companies to invest more in technology to make beef safer.</LD>
<TE>   But "Modern Meat" presents far greater evidence that the changes
have done more harm than good. Mass herding promotes the passing of
bacteria such as salmonella among cattle, food safety experts say.
Speeding up the slaughtering process and mixing meat from potentially
hundreds of cows for one burger have also increased the risk of
contamination, they add.</TE>
<TE>   As for new inspection regulations set forth in 1996, many of those
interviewed call them essentially toothless. Perhaps most shocking,
the government does not have the power to recall tainted meat.</TE>
<TE>   Yet for all of the program's revelations, it tends to have a
Chicken Little effect by overemphasizing critics' rhetoric rather
than letting facts speak for themselves.</TE>

<DH>Miniature golf, once all the rage around L.A., may have
just run its course.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRENDA REES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Golf's Scottish forefathers surely had no idea their noble creation
would one day mutate into a maddening miniature experience complete
with Day-Glo windmills, fluorescent blue waterfalls and fairways
covered with a strange green fabric.</LD>
<LD>   Thus is the legacy of miniature golf, a "racy" amusement in the
1930s, resurrected in the 1950s as the wacky fantasy sport, and one
that continues to putter along in the 21st century.</LD>
<LD>   Although Los Angeles has played a part in the development of the
game, it's unfortunate that many of the great miniature golf courses
in the Southland have gone the way of another West Coast creation
practically laid to rest--the drive-in theater.</LD>
<TE>   "Miniature golf courses are totally disposable, throwaway
recreational environments," laments Charles Phoenix, author of
numerous books on 1950s Southern California. "They really are the
forgotten stepchild of kitsch culture. We haven't done enough to
document them, especially here in Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles preservation consultant John English also would like
to see more attention paid to miniature golf. "We need to identify
the ones that are significant and see what we can do to make sure
they remain," he says. "What is really mind-boggling is they were all
over this city in the 1930s."</TE>
<TE>   Back then, Los Angeles fanatically embraced mini-golf, creating
elaborate settings. More than 300 courses could be found in Hollywood
alone.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles' famed Caliente course was built atop a natural geyser
that spewed steam 100 feet in the air. Another local course boasted
Chinese dragons and junks floating in water hazards as an eight-piece
orchestra played Chinese classical music and jazz.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood had an Eskimo village replete with blue turf, snow banks
and an aurora borealis. Not to be outdone, Altadena's Japanese garden
motif had a miniature Mt. Fuji, bridges and shrines.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood celebrities were drawn to the mini-golfing scene. "Mary
Pickford built her own golf course that was done in this modernistic
French style with bizarre palm trees and surreal flowers," says Maria
Reidelbach, co-author of the book "Miniature Golf" by Abbeville
Press.</TE>
<TE>   Movie stars of the day were forbidden by the studios to play or be
seen on miniature golf courses, which is why Pickford and also actor
Jackie Coogan designed their own, explains Reidelbach. "The movie
studios feared the soaring popularity of mini-golf would diminish
theater ticket sales," she says. "That's why in movies of that era,
you rarely see someone playing mini-golf, despite the fact the
courses were everywhere in Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, people of all ages, backgrounds and ethnicities flocked to
miniature golf courses. It was an activity women could do unescorted,
and since courses were open late--some closed at 4 a.m.--it had a
risque nighttime allure.</TE>
<TE>   But interest eventually waned as mini-golf faced legal and civic
restrictions. People grew tired of the amusement and went on to other
fads. Courses became parking lots and city streets.</TE>
<TE>   But the sport was revitalized in the 1950s, thanks to
entrepreneurial folks on the East Coast like Don Clayton, founder of
Putt-Putt ompany Golf and Games. Mini-golf became a wholesome, family
activity.</TE>
<TE>   "They became mini-amusement parks," says photographer John
Margolies, whose quirky pics are included in the "Miniature Golf"
book. "Family-valued Mormons played a hand in building Fountain
Valley's miniature course," says Margolies, explaining that they
wanted a "place kids could go on a safe date."</TE>
<TE>   Mini-golf became larger than life in Southern Californian due to
the freeways. "Owners had to use very large sculptures to appeal to
people going 65 mph," says Margolies. "Big castles were positioned
prominently on hills."</TE>
<TE>   Mom-and-pop courses flourished for about 10 to 20 years.
Exaggeratedly modern, tacky and often handmade, these mini-golf
courses contained unique obstacles and challenges, which made
Putt-Putt owner Clayton contend that mini-golf was indeed a serious
sport. "Our putters are great athletes and men," he once said, which
began the contemporary argument: Is miniature golf a game or sport?</TE>
<TE>   But, in the end, the '50s revitalization waned, and with it came
the demise of many courses. Today, few mom-and-pop courses survive in
Southern California. A remnant of that era is the tiny and unique
Arroyo Seco Course in South Pasadena built in 1955. Most miniature
golf courses, however, are part of family fun centers, where the soft
clunk of a hole-in-one is drowned out by the roar of race cars,
batting cages and video arcades.</TE>
<TE>   One quiet course, located in Avalon on Catalina Island, is faced
with potential or partial extinction. Golf Gardens, created with
bricks and simple materials by owner John Frick, has been pleasing
tourists and residents since 1971. But the small city is desperate
for a fully functioning grocery store, which may send the wrecking
ball to Golf Gardens.</TE>
<TE>   "The future is up in the air," states Paul DeMyer of the Santa
Catalina Island Co., which owns most of the land in Avalon. "We have
to balance our community needs and are evaluating all our
alternatives. But we do recognize the need for green space and the
historical significance of the miniature golf course."</TE>
<TE>   Despite course closures, miniature golf probably will be around
for quite a while, since longtime course managers say they have a
steady business, thanks to teenagers, families and young people
looking for alternative amusements.</TE>
<TE>   For many, mini-golf is a great first date. "You can learn a lot
about someone's personality by the way they golf," says Jamie Case of
Sherman Oaks. "I've done it many times and it's a pretty good method.
You can see how smart they are, what upsets them, if they have a good
sense of humor."</TE>
<TE>   A comedy writer for radio, Case is a member of a 3-year-old
organization, the Professional MiniGolf Assn. (PMGA), which has been
holding tournaments nationwide. "Our goal is to emulate the PGA with
a Masters and U.S. Open," says president Bob Detwiliger from his
office in Florida. "We've been talking to ESPN for tournament
coverage too."</TE>
<TE>   So far, no PMGA tournaments have been slated for Southern
California--there is one scheduled in Sacramento--but Detwiliger is
confident one will happen soon. "We're getting a lot of interest," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   The future of miniature golf--as sport and/or recreation--seems to
be coasting on a slow bank heading lazily toward a hole hidden
beneath a swinging cylinder. Although mini-golf probably never will
recapture its glory days, it remains an otherworldly experience.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great thing to do as a kid on warm Friday nights," sums
up author Phoenix. "To me, miniature golf is like stepping into a
comic strip or a fantasy land. You can be anyone and go anywhere. I
love it."</TE>

<LD>Got the urge to putt and frolic under in the shade of a mini-golf
windmill? Here are some area recommendations.</LD>
<LD>   Arroyo Seco Golf Course--Built in 1955 and constructed with lava
rocks and cement blocks, it's the oldest course in town and has only
nine holes. The three-level bank shot is a whopper. 1055 Lohman Lane,
South Pasadena, (323) 255-1506.</LD>
<LD>   Boomers Park--The only place in the Southland to mini-golf
indoors. Those courses feature a Wild West theme and Middle-earth
fantasy. 1500 W. 7th St., Upland, (909) 981-5251.</LD>
<TE>   Camelot Golfland--The biggest mini-golf spot in Southern
California with five courses. Picturesque holes include shots over a
fishing wharf, putting through an Oriental pagoda and by an African
village. 3200 E. Carpenter Ave., Anaheim, (714) 630-3340.</TE>
<TE>   Castle Park--Each of these four courses has different musical
accompaniment. Highlights include a Native American village, a
haunted house and an old western fort. 3500 Polk St., Riverside,
(909) 785-3000.</TE>
<TE>   Fountain Valley Boomers--California Mission-themed courses as well
as European favorites, the Eiffel Tower and Big Ben. 16800 Magnolia
St., Fountain Valley, (714) 842-1011.</TE>
<TE>   Golf Gardens--Hand-made in 1971 with none of the commonplace
kitschy statuary. You will encounter complicated obstacles encased in
a park-like setting. Watch out for roaming cats. Island Plaza,
Avalon, Catalina Island, (310) 510-1200.</TE>
<TE>   Golf N' Stuff--A fiberglass hippo and alligator cavort in a pond;
a huge elephant sprays water. Putt inside a gold mine cave. 5555
Walker St., Ventura, (805) 644-7148.</TE>
<TE>   Malibu Castle--Avast ye mateys! Pirate-themed courses with sunken
ships and even a water fountain that erupts from a skull on a nearby
lake. 2410 Marine Ave., Redondo Beach, (310) 643-5167.</TE>
<TE>   Sherman Oaks Castle Park--Putt alongside the 405 Freeway near a
tiki god that blows mist. Springtime usually brings out early morning
rabbits that scurry round the fairways. 4989 Sepulveda Blvd., Sherman
Oaks, (818) 756-9459.</TE>

<LD>British director Adrian Lyne has never shied away from controversy.
In fact, he seems to court it with such erotic, controversial films
as "9 1/2 Weeks," "Fatal Attraction" and "Indecent Proposal." Not
only did these films become box office hits, their subject matter
also made them cultural phenomena.</LD>
<LD>   This week, Paramount has released special editions of 1987's
"Fatal Attraction" and 1992's "Indecent Proposal" ($25 each).</LD>
<LD>   "Fatal Attraction," which was nominated for six Oscars, including
best picture, caused a media storm when it was released. Glenn Close
stars as a beautiful but definitely psychotic associate editor for a
publishing house who has an affair with a married attorney (Michael
Douglas). When he tries to extricate himself from the relationship,
she refuses to let him go. Anne Archer also stars as Douglas'
unsuspecting wife.</LD>
<TE>   The splendid DVD features new interviews with Lyne, Douglas,
Close, Archer, producers Stanley Jaffe and Sherry Lansing, and writer
Nicholas Meyer, who worked on James Dearden's original script.
Lansing and Jaffe discuss the genesis of the project--a short film by
Dearden--and Lyne, Douglas and Close discuss the fact that Close was
not the first choice for the role. She had previously played more
wholesome heroines and wasn't considered a "sexy" actress. But after
reading Dearden's script, Close pursued the role and won everyone
over when she and Douglas performed a pivotal scene together in her
audition.</TE>
<TE>   Also included in the new documentary is a look at the controversy
surrounding the original ending of the movie. When the film was
tested, audiences weren't satisfied and wanted more of a revenge
scenario. Close admits she fought against reshooting for two weeks
before giving in and agreeing to do the more violent and cathartic
ending.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the disc are informative featurettes on the cultural
impact of the film and its visual design, rehearsal footage involving
Close and Douglas, and a perceptive commentary track with the
director.</TE>
<TE>   Lyne also supplies the commentary for "Indecent Proposal," an
often unintentionally funny drama about a couple (Demi Moore and
Woody Harrelson) with money problems who go to Las Vegas in hopes of
improving their financial luck. When they lose most of their money, a
handsome, single billionaire (Robert Redford) offers them a cool $1
million if he can spend the night with Moore.</TE>
<TE>   Among the interesting tidbits Lyne serves up: The sexy black dress
Moore wears in the film was altered 17 times because the actress
didn't like the way it fit. In the case of Redford, Lyne says that no
one on film walks quite like he does, describing his gait as "ramrod
straight."</TE>
<TE>   He also points out that he always knew when Redford had arrived on
the set because the cast and crew would fall into a hush.</TE>
<TE>   Be on the lookout for a quite pudgy Billy Bob Thornton in a small
part as a gambler who engages Harrelson in a brief but funny
conversation.</TE>
<TE>   On the digital edition of Joel and Ethan Coen's quirky dark comedy
"The Man Who Wasn't There" (USA, $27), they jokingly describe the now
gaunt Thornton as resembling Abraham Lincoln. Thornton plays a
laconic barber named Ed Crane who lives in a small Northern
California town, circa 1949. When a shyster (Jon Polito) convinces Ed
to invest in his new dry-cleaning business, Ed decides to blackmail
his wife's (Frances McDormand) married lover (James Gandolfini). But
Ed's best-laid plans go murderously awry.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD includes a "making of" documentary and an interview with
Roger Deakins, who supplied the gorgeous, Oscar-nominated,
black-and-white cinematography. There are some very bizarre deleted
scenes that consist mainly of hairstyles and a plate of salad.</TE>
<TE>   "The Man Who Wasn't There" also marks the first time the Coen
brothers do an audio commentary. The siblings, with their off-kilter
view of the world, are a hoot.</TE>
<TE>   Named the best American movie of 2001 by the New Yorker, the
thriller "The Deep End" arrives this week on DVD (Fox, $30). Tilda
Swinton and Goran Visnjic star in this scintillating tale of
blackmail, murder and redemption. The serviceable DVD includes a
minor featurette, a still gallery, trailers, an informative "Anatomy
of a Scene" special that aired on the Sundance Channel, and decent
commentary from David Siegel and Scott McGehee, who wrote, produced
and directed the indie hit.</TE>
<TE>   Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman and Robert Sean Leonard star in "Tape"
(Lions Gate, $25), Richard Linklater's fascinating character study
about three former high school friends who come together in a shabby
hotel room 10 years after graduation and end up playing out
unresolved problems. The film reunites Hawke and Leonard, who
appeared together in 1989's "Dead Poets Society."</TE>
<TE>   Linklater and Hawke supply the perceptive commentary on the
digital edition of the low-budget film, which was shot on
high-definition video in just six days.</TE>
<TE>   In his audio commentary for the strained Martin Lawrence comedy
"Black Knight" (Fox, $27), director Gil Junger actually thanks the
studio and the producers for giving him the job.</TE>
<TE>   Best known as a sitcom director, Junger had previously directed
only one feature, the low-budget 1999 teen comedy "Ten Things I Hate
About You."</TE>
<TE>   The DVD also includes Lawrence talking about two of his scenes in
the film, deleted scenes with commentary from Junger--one excised
sequence features tennis champ Serena Williams--unfunny outtakes,
storyboards, a short interview with Paula Abdul, who choreographed
the film, and a look at the film's production design.</TE>
<TE>   The thriller "Domestic Disturbance" is just the latest in a series
of unsatisfactory vehicles for star John Travolta. In this uninspired
chiller, he plays a father who must protect his son from his evil
stepfather. Teri Polo, Vince Vaughn and a scene-stealing Steve
Buscemi star.</TE>
<TE>   The digital edition (Paramount, $30) includes six deleted scenes
with an introduction from veteran director Harold Becker, as well as
his passable audio commentary.</TE>
<TE>   If you love films that feature brutal fight sequences, you'll want
to check out "Ultimate Fights" (Universal, $15 for VHS, $20 for DVD),
a collection of 16 fight scenes from such films as "Gladiator,"
"Scarface," "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," "They Live!" and
"Legend of the Drunken Master."</TE>
<TE>   The digital version includes a featurette with fight choreographer
James Lew on how to stage your own movie fight; audio commentary with
Hong Kong director Tsui Hark, an interactive game and fun facts about
each scene.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Opportunities to hear single-composer concerts, portraits of an
artist rather than just a glimpse, are all too rare. They do occur,
however, in academia, as when USC student and faculty musicians
performed works by accomplished composer Frederick Lesemann on
Tuesday at the Newman Recital Hall on campus.</LD>
<LD>   In program notes, Lesemann called the concert less a definitive
"retrospective" than a loose selection of pieces spanning the '50s
through last year, befitting its title "Chamber Music From Six
Decades." The music did touch on the arc of his development through
style and history, suggesting that he's a composer of generous range,
resistant to the strictures of "isms."</LD>
<LD>   That was a clear message in Five Fugues for String
Quartet--smartly played by the Calder String Quartet--a 1985 piece
with fugal passages that ironically allude to the repetitive lines of
Minimalism.</LD>
<TE>   One impression left was that Lesemann--a faculty member for nearly
40 years--has a winning way with brass, from the requiem-ish contours
of "Caoine (Music for Brass)" to the artful blare of "Lux Lituorum,"
for eight trumpets producing a big, bright yet lush sound.</TE>
<TE>   "Variations" (1957) for solo piano gestured toward 12-tone
pioneer--and iconic USC faculty member--Arnold Schoenberg. Played
beautifully by Susan Svrcek, the work wields its atonal language
gracefully with an almost Satie-ish feeling and economy.</TE>
<TE>   This program's highlight was last year's Concertino for Oboe and 6
Instruments, with Paul Sherman in top form as soloist.</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, the concert's pluralistic range was packed carefully
into this single, moving work, ranging from playful to plaintive,
with a section of fervid, bullying unison and a final, hypnotic
oboe-flute duet.</TE>

<HD>Local Rocker's Tuna Town Strikes a Familiar Chord</HD>
<DH>Korn drummer David Silvera's new Huntington Beach sushi,
teppan spot is a rock 'n' roll Benihana.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN BOOE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tuna Town is a new Huntington Beach restaurant owned by Korn drummer
David Silvera and his wife, Shannon. Depending on your musical
tastes--or, more likely, your age--this detail of ownership will rate
as either highly significant or mildly confusing.</LD>
<LD>   I happened to know that Korn is a popular rock band, and I have
now learned that they got together in Huntington Beach, but,
personally, I wouldn't recognize one of their songs if you played it
at my wedding. Two friends who joined me at the restaurant were
somewhat more savvy. They knew how Korn spells its name, but
disagreed about whether it's the "k" or the "r" that is written
backward.</LD>
<LD>   The rock connection wouldn't seem to have anything to do with the
food, but in a way it does. Tuna Town is, in effect, a rock 'n' roll
Benihana; if you reserve a teppan table, a chef cooks in front of
you, doing a Benihana-style culinary tap dance with knives and
spatulas.</LD>
<TE>   It's all good fun, but quite a different experience, of course, if
you're not much over college age and have never seen it before. As we
were being seated at a teppan table with a foursome in their early
20s, one of my friends mentioned the name Benihana. "Benny who?" they
replied.</TE>
<TE>   The restaurant is, as you might expect, trendy in design, using
the industrial Gothic motif that seems to be de rigueur for sushi
bars and ambitious Asian restaurants these days. It's a large room
with high ceilings, concrete floors painted institutional gray and on
the walls are gold and platinum records and other musical
memorabilia.</TE>
<TE>   On one side as you enter, there's a bar and a sushi bar, on the
other, vastly spacious crescent-shaped banquettes where only sushi is
served. In the middle toward the rear sprawl the three huge teppan
tables, each seating up to 10 people. The room is very noisy.</TE>
<TE>   When you make reservations for a teppan table, you'll be politely
but firmly told that if you're more than 15 minutes late, you'll lose
your slot. Fair enough, but it's also good to know that the teppan
tables are large, so you'll probably be seated with another party,
and if you don't get there on time, you'll be delaying their service
as well as your own. We were close to a half-hour late. Fortunately,
the group of young adults we shared the teppan table with were
patient.</TE>
<TE>   From that point, it took another 20 minutes for our waiter to take
our orders. She forcefully suggested that we try the infused sakes. I
was skeptical, suspecting something on the order of a wine cooler,
but we settled on the Momokawa Ruby Sake, and it turned out to be the
roundest, softest sake I've ever had.</TE>
<TE>   We ordered some sushi to start with, then a variety of items from
the teppan menu.</TE>
<TE>   The sushi gets the job done. It's nicely presented and
appropriately fresh, arriving on a chilled plate. In the center, our
yellowtail sashimi was curled into a rose and sprinkled with salmon
roe. The spicy tuna roll was on the mark, and the crab roll got a
nice bite from radish sprouts and shredded pickled carrots.</TE>
<TE>   The kitchen does have a few kinks to work out, though. Our miso
soup, which came tepid, was salty and tasted as if it came from a
mix. The salad, a big bowl of iceberg lettuce, had a good
tomato-garlic vinaigrette, but some parts had dressing and some
didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Still, everything fell into place with the arrival of the chef,
who began slicing and dicing with considerable deftness, juggling
knives, tossing an egg into the air and splitting it on his spatula,
flipping a shrimp tail from behind his back and catching it on his
toque. He did the old Benihana trick of stacking onion slices to
create a "volcano" with steam puffing out of the center.</TE>
<TE>   The food is fine, and it's prepared so simply--flash-fried on the
griddle with little more than salt and pepper--that the most
important thing to say about it is the ingredients are first-rate.
The filet mignon is tender and juicy, the lobster succulent, the
shrimp plump and moist, the halibut and scallops tender and
flavorful.</TE>
<TE>   The sushi items run $3 to $9.50. Teppan entrees are $14 to $25,
combinations $24 to $35. The prices, particularly the teppan prices,
reflect that you're paying for the show as much as anything else, and
our youngish tablemates looked as if they were having the time of
their lives.</TE>

<HD>In Truth, 'Misanthrope: Karaoke Musical' Is Good for a Few
Laughs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK CHALON SMITH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "The Misanthrope: The Karaoke Musical!" at Stages Theatre, there's
a "karaoke moral charter" that singers must follow. The top
commandments are: Never perform original songs and always, and they
mean always, applaud everyone, no matter how sour.</LD>
<LD>   Albert (Robert Dean Nunez), the star of Joel Beers' wobbly
adaptation of Moliere's classic, is fine with the first commandment.
He knows that singing anything but a pop hit amounts to sacrilege.
It's the second that ruins his rhythm. Does everyone have to make
nice all the time? Wouldn't some well-placed honesty help? All the
pretense, the hypocrisy, the smiling. Bah. Moliere was just as
infuriated with these things when he wrote "The Misanthrope" in the
mid-1600s. French high society was a den of glad rags and
glad-handing as people vied for better placement among the blue
bloods.</LD>
<TE>   Beers and director Patrick Gwaltney seem to think karaoke clubs
are a modern equivalent of Moliere's turf, with rules, compromises
and bad clothes coloring the scene. Well, even Beers and Gwaltney
admit, in news releases, that the parallels they draw are a stretch.
They stress they just want to have fun. Is "The Misanthrope: The
Karaoke Musical!" fun? Sure, but it's a lot like visiting a karaoke
joint: A trickle of the stuff can bring on grins, but a flood
threatens to wear you out. And here's a caution: You can't signal for
another cocktail when resolve weakens.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, this show owes as much to "Saturday Night Fever" as to
Moliere. We get rhyming couplets, many revamped with slang, but the
plot and people push John Travolta and that famous disco contest into
mind. Albert (taking off on Moliere's Alceste) might be fuming over
all the phonies, but he still wants to win the upcoming sing-off.
Partnering with his sweetheart, Celine (Moliere's Celemine) would
seal victory but she's busy playing the field.</TE>
<TE>   As we drift to the finale, various regulars and would-be
contestants, both high and low on the food chain, get to wreck a song
or two. There's nothing subtle about it. When the message is love, we
hear an iffy rendition of Tom Jones' "It's Not Unusual." And when
Albert realizes his ethics have left him an outsider, a sanctimonious
"Solitary Man" by Neil Diamond fills the small Fullerton theater,
gaudily decorated as a club by set designer Jon Gaw. It's a laugh.
And so are some of the characters.</TE>
<TE>   Patti Cumby's Celine knows she's the queen of the prom and milks
this knowledge throughout. Her verbal catfight with Andrea (Cynthia
Ryanen) tickles in more than a few places. Jon-Enee Merriex as
Albert's sidekick, Phillip, and Aaron Wyne as his nemesis, Oliver,
are as silly as they're supposed to be.</TE>
<TE>   Beers and Gwaltney toss in the unexpected every now and then to
tweak things. My favorite surprise, apparently inspired by the more
melodramatic figure skating at the Winter Olympics, comes when a
not-so-graceful woman, in delicate chiffon, roller-skates around the
stage to accent a romantic moment. Down went designer Bill Mittler's
mood lights and up went the chuckles.</TE>

<HD>'The Red Violin,' From the Silver Screen to New West</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Distinctive Quebecois film director Francois Girard has done more
than his share to bring the fineries of classical music culture into
the realm of the movie world--no easy feat.</LD>
<LD>   His engaging and unusually structured film, "32 Short Films About
Glenn Gould," did well on the festival and art-house circuit after
its release in 1993. Next up, Girard struck a more popular chord with
his 1998 historical saga, "The Red Violin," which managed to wed
mystery and the wandering story of a cherished violin through the
centuries.</LD>
<LD>   Now the film's score, by noted composer John Corigliano, has crept
back into the concert hall.</LD>
<TE>   The Chaconne for Violin and Orchestra, from the film's score, was
a showcase work in the recent program of the New West Symphony. It
was played with requisite flair and care by New West concertmaster
Charles Stegeman in the challenging soloist role, and the orchestra,
under Boris Brott's hand, was up to its usual high standards. Still,
this is music that may have served the screen well but projects
something of an identity crisis live. With tendrils in the 19th
century romantic concerto tradition, 20th century Hollywood and the
composer's own eclectic voice, the work dazzles but fails to cohere
into much that is memorable.</TE>
<TE>   In this program, Corigliano's music ended up being outshone by the
works surrounding it, for very different reasons. Argentine composer
Alberto Ginastera's "Suite From Estancia" opened the concert.
Emotionally exuberant but also cerebral in design, it was a too-rare
blast of creative excitement from Latin America. That's an area the
New West should be paying closer attention to, for reasons of
proximity and aesthetics. The orchestra certainly played it with a
winning intensity.</TE>
<TE>   After intermission came the concert's real highlight--and one of
the strongest performances of its current season--on the weird,
classic hoary theme of Berlioz's "Symphonie Fantastique." As Brott
mentioned in his preconcert banter, it is hard to believe that this
impressionistic-cum-romantic piece was penned in 1830. Inspired by
unrequited love and probably by opium abuse, the opus has an exotic
back story.</TE>
<TE>   But in the end, it is the music that speaks for itself.</TE>
<TE>   Singing in City Hall: A sense of lightheartedness is programmed
into the very name of the local group called Opera Unplugged. It has
presented several more serious operatic programs in its young but
energetic life, but Friday at Ventura City Hall show tunes are on the
menu. The program called "I'm in the Mood for--Love," which opened
last weekend, is the first of three programs to include "I'm in the
Mood for--Celebration" and "I'm in the Mood for--Jazz."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, singers Arlene Thomas, Gene Brundage, Vicki Harrop and
Bruce Liberty will traipse down Broadway lane. Ed Scott, the pianist
for the show, has a direct Broadway connection as a friend and
colleague of Frank Loesser.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   * Opera Unplugged presents "I'm in the Mood for--Love," Ventura
City Hall atrium, 501 Poli St., Friday, 8 p.m. $25; senior citizens,

<HD>Towering Over the Traditions of UC Berkeley</HD>
<DH>Cal's beloved Campanile clock and bell tower has long been
the defining sound and image of the campus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FERRELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Campanile is 9 feet shorter than London's Big Ben--and not nearly
as famous--but few clock towers in the world have such grandeur or
history.</LD>
<LD>   Rising 307 feet above a courtyard full of sycamores, the Campanile
has been the defining landmark at UC Berkeley since 1914. Sixty-one
bells, the largest weighing more than 5 tons, hang in the belfry just
above the open-air observation deck.</LD>
<LD>   At noon, on the last day of classes, they chime an old Irish
lament, "They're Hangin' Danny Deever in the Mornin'," for students
about to take final exams:</LD>
<TE>   "What's that so black against the sun?</TE>
<TE>   It's Danny fightin' 'ard for life.</TE>
<TE>   What's that that whimpers over'ead?</TE>
<TE>   It's Danny's soul that's passin' now."</TE>
<TE>   Generations of knowledgeable undergraduates have mouthed Rudyard
Kipling's lyrics for 75 years. No one knows how the tradition
started, but the despair, for some, is real. At least three students
leaped from the tower before bars were installed years ago to enclose
the observation platform.</TE>
<TE>   The Campanile's four clocks are said to be the largest in Northern
California, each measuring 17 feet in diameter. Alumni remember when
pranksters managed to decorate them with Mickey Mouse hands. More
recently, for Halloween, someone crowned the tower with a massive
faux pumpkin.</TE>
<TE>   Legends and stories go back as far as World War I. One involves
gridiron hero Harold "Brick" Muller, who helped lead an unbeaten Cal
team to a 28-0 dismantling of Ohio State in the 1921 Rose Bowl.
Muller had the audacity and showmanship to try to catch a football
thrown from the deck of the Campanile.</TE>
<TE>   Visible from San Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge, the square
bell tower, designed by John Galen Howard, is the focal point of
campus life, said Charles Palmer, student body president during the
1968-69 school year. "I think for anybody who's gone there, no matter
what they were getting out of Berkeley, it's a symbol."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, now a Los Angeles attorney, remembers the tower as a place
where secret societies met before conducting their initiation rites.
"You were told to meet there ... and led to a meeting place," he
said. "You'd be cloaked in almost graduation robes, and there'd be a
presentation about the history of the organization." Some of the
private groups date to the founding of the campus in 1868.</TE>
<TE>   Although he keeps the vows of 30 years ago and declines to
identify the society he joined, Palmer talks effusively about other
tales involving the Campanile. Some center on the Big Game, Cal's
annual football matchup with archrival Stanford. To the winner goes
"The Axe," a perpetual trophy consisting of the head of an old
lumberjack ax.</TE>
<TE>   While Palmer was a student, Stanford was dominant and kept The Axe
secure inside a locked case. Well, apparently not so secure, because
Palmer's friend John Welborne broke in with a screwdriver and got it.</TE>
<TE>   "Alarms went off. Everybody went nuts," Palmer recalled. "There
was this huge hullabaloo about, 'Where was The Axe?'"</TE>
<TE>   Welborne, also a Los Angeles attorney now, devised a scheme for
answering that very question. He shot pictures of The Axe in front of
the Campanile--"so it was obvious where it was"--and sent 8-by-10
glossies to the San Francisco Chronicle, the Berkeley Gazette and
both campus newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   "The caption we put on the back," Welborne said, "was, 'The
Stanford Axe Back Home Where It Belongs.' "</TE>
<TE>   The end of the story was perhaps fitting. Cal lost to Stanford
that year for the fifth consecutive time.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to go down and give The Axe back to the Stanford football
team," said Palmer, who, as student president, was in charge of the
formal presentation. "Not fun."</TE>
<TE>   More history rests inside the Campanile: bones and fossils from
the Ice Age. Five cramped floors inside the tower, just above the
lobby, hold thousands of relics of saber-tooth cats, mammoths, dire
wolves, birds, insects, snakes and other animals that lived 40,000
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Most were dragged out of the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles. John
C. Merriam, a Berkeley paleontologist, was one of the first to
explore the pits beginning in 1912. His artifacts--and many added
since--fill scores of shelves, drawers and boxes in dim rooms that
few visitors get to see. Across one floor lies a fossilized piece of
backbone from a plesiosaur, a giant aquatic reptile of 60million
years ago, said elevator operator Lilyanne Clark.</TE>
<TE>   "I call him my Loch Ness monster," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby stand tusks and a massive jawbone. Dinosaur footprints are
preserved in plaster. One set is marred by felt-tip pen: "Go Bruins."</TE>
<TE>   Even though the Campanile elevators are now closed for several
months to undergo $400,000 in repairs, scholars still hike the stairs
to study creatures of the Pleistocene, said paleontologist Mark
Goodwin. "Scientifically," he said of the relics, "they are
irreplaceable."</TE>
<TE>   The Campanile's construction began about the time Merriam was
poking in the tar. The framework was erected in 1914. The tower
contains three times as much steel per cubic foot as most
skyscrapers. By the time the original bells were installed and a
facing of white granite applied in 1917, the structure cost $144,000
and weighed over 10million pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Formally named the Jane K. Sather Tower, for an early campus
benefactor, the Campanile was designed after the bell tower at St.
Mark's Square in Venice, Italy. The Campanile spire is topped by a
20-foot-tall lantern that burns at night with a 1,200-watt light
bulb. To service it, crews climb spiral staircases up through spidery
areas above the observation deck.</TE>
<TE>   The deck, framed with granite arches, costs $2 to visit when the
elevators are working. The bells are visible above it, some 6 feet in
diameter. The carillon--as the array is called--is played by a man in
a glass-walled booth who manipulates some 60 baton-like keys and 30
foot pedals, all rigged to cables.</TE>
<TE>   That man is Jeff Davis. He has been on the job for 17 years,
having learned the obscure trade from the carillonist who preceded
him.</TE>
<TE>   Couples who get married at the nearby Faculty Club often time
their nuptials to end as Davis begins a Sunday concert. They exchange
rings and someone makes a call to the tower. Davis launches into a
joyous piece from Bach or some baroque tune he has arranged
specifically for the carillon.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a huge repertoire--about 500 pieces," he said, conceding
that the bells are difficult to play. The carillon is California's
biggest, even larger than Stanford's. But when operated by a master,
it is also extraordinarily expressive, Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   "It has the widest dynamic range of any instrument," he said. "I
can play it so softly you can't hear it at the bottom of the tower,
and so loudly you can hear it miles away."</TE>

<LD>Crespi High senior tennis standout Stephen Amritraj, out all season
because of a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee, will
play his second match of the season today when the Celts play against
Chaminade.</LD>
<LD>   Amritraj, who will play at Duke next season, is ranked No. 4 in
the world in International Tennis Federation junior doubles rankings
and No. 97 in singles.</LD>
<LD>   He will compete in the CIF Interscholastic doubles division of the
upcoming Ojai tournament with Crespi junior Steven Bondy.</LD>
<TE>   Amritraj, who was injured Jan. 25 during the Australian Open
junior tournament, has been the No. 1 singles player for the Celts
the last three years but played doubles in his return last week
against Loyola, which handed Crespi an 11-7 loss.</TE>
<TE>   "I've become a lot more motivated because of [the injury],"
Amritraj said. "I'm just so happy to be doing simple things like
going for a jog, which I used to hate to do."</TE>

<LD>Matt Koffler, who last season guided Rosemead to the Southern Section
Division VII semifinals, has been hired as football coach at Lakewood
Artesia.</LD>
<LD>   Koffler was selected San Gabriel Valley coach of the year in 2001
after Rosemead finished 10-3, 5-0 in the Mission Valley League.</LD>
<LD>   The former USC quarterback replaces Jason Arnold, who coached
Artesia for four seasons. The Pioneers last season finished 2-7, 2-5
in the Suburban League.</LD>
<TE>   In other coaching news:</TE>
<TE>   * Randy Wright has resigned as girls' water polo coach at Irvine
Northwood to concentrate on the boys' program, and Mark Foster has

coaching club soccer.</TE>
<TE>   * Rich Sanders, the boys' basketball coach at Westlake the last
two seasons, has resigned to spend more time with his family. Sanders
had a 26-24 record at Westlake. The Warriors will have eight players

<HD>Mariners Complete a Perfect (10-0) Trip</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Seattle Mariners finished up a 10-0 road trip as Ichiro Suzuki
hit a three-run double and John Olerud had a two-run homer Wednesday
night in a 7-4 victory over the Oakland Athletics.</LD>
<LD>   The Mariners, who set an American League record with 59 road
victories last season, won four games at Anaheim, four more at Texas
and finished with a two-game sweep at the Coliseum.</LD>
<LD>   Seattle became the seventh team to start a season with at least 10
consecutive road victories. Atlanta was the last club to do it in
1994.</LD>
<TE>   Jamie Moyer (2-1) gave up three runs and six hits over five
innings. Last season's 20-game winner for Seattle hasn't given up
more than three runs in any of his first four starts.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 7, Cleveland 2--Mark Buehrle became the AL's first
four-game winner and Ray Durham matched a career-high with four RBIs
as the White Sox won at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago has now won seven of eight games, and is off to its best
start since 1994. Cleveland, which had its 10-game winning streak
snapped Tuesday night, lost two in a row for the first time this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 10, Toronto 3--Manny Ramirez homered and drove in four runs
to lead the Red Sox to the victory over the Blue Jays at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez was four for five and scored three runs as Boston's
designated hitter. In the two-game sweep at SkyDome, he had seven
hits, including two homers, and seven RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   New York 7, Baltimore 1--Jason Giambi hit his first home run at
Yankee Stadium this season, helping the Yankees defeat the Orioles
for a much-needed victory.</TE>
<TE>   Alfonso Soriano went three for four with a leadoff homer, Jorge
Posada and Rondell White hit two-run shots and Shane Spencer had a
solo homer for New York.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees had lost six of seven games since a seven-game winning
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 16, Minnesota 3--Carlos Beltran broke open a close
game with a three-run homer in the seventh inning and the Royals
scored nine more times in the eighth in the rout at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Beltran's first homer of the season made it 7-3 and helped the
Royals stop a three-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins had won four in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 7, Tampa Bay 6--Wendell Magee scored on a wild pitch in
the bottom of the ninth inning at Detroit as the Tigers defeated the
Devil Rays for their second consecutive victory after an 11-game
losing streak to open the season.</TE>

<HD>Hit Parade a No-Show for Angels</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Anaheim, batting .220 as a team, continues to
struggle at plate in 4-1 loss to Texas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bengie Molina, the Angels' last batter, summed up Wednesday's game
with his last swing. His bat sailed toward left field. The ball hit
catcher Bill Haselman's mitt.</LD>
<LD>   It's too early to press the panic button. Angel batters will come
around. They won't hit .220 as a team all season ... right?</LD>
<LD>   Still, a gentle push on the mildly concerned button seems to be in
order after the Angels' 4-1 loss to the Texas Rangers in front of
15,632 at Edison Field.</LD>
<TE>   "We had stretches last season where we didn't do a lot," Manager
Mike Scioscia said. "We'd have 14 games where we struggle some. But
everything is magnified when it's the start of the season."</TE>
<TE>   Highlighted Wednesday was that the Angels had few base runners and
only one clutch hit, that being Orlando Palmeiro's excuse-me blooper
that landed just out of the reach of Ranger shortstop Alex Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   Ranger starter Ismael Valdes dominated, giving up only three hits
and retired 13 consecutive batters before hitting David Eckstein with
one out in the eighth. The Angels couldn't get a run off two
relievers from a Ranger bullpen that had given up 17 runs in its last
112/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not too worried about it this many games into the season,"
Garret Anderson said. "You see guys get off to these fast starts and
then wonder what happened to them at the end of the year. The cream
rises."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels did rise a bit as Anderson doubled off the top of the
center-field fence to lead off the second. Scott Spiezio lined out to
right and Tim Salmon flied to center, which sent Anderson to third.
But just when it looked like Valdes was going to wiggle out of
trouble, Palmeiro sent a flair to the left side that wouldn't stay up
long enough for Rodriguez to snag it and Anderson scored.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone seems concerned about this slow start," Darin Erstad
said. "I'm very confident about the type of offense we have here."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels began Wednesday next to last in the American League in
batting average, runs and home runs.</TE>
<TE>   Six players in baseball have hit more home runs than the five the
Angels have as a team. On the bright side, they have saved a bundle
on those post-home run firework celebrations so far.</TE>
<TE>   True, the Angels were without their home run and RBI leader, as
Troy Glaus sat out because of vision problems with his contact
lenses. But other Angels might want to consult the nearest eye chart
as well.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon stranded three runners in scoring position, one with a
tapper in front of the plate in the ninth. Anderson had two hits, but
also rolled a grounder back to the pitcher with runners on first and
third and two out in the eighth. And the last time Brad Fullmer drove
in a run, he was north of the border, playing for Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest threat the Angels mustered didn't cost the Rangers
anything but their pitching coach.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson singled and Spiezio walked to start the fourth inning.
Pitching coach Oscar Acosta went out to talk with Valdes, but their
conversation was brought to a rapid conclusion. Home plate umpire
Alfonso Marquez went to the mound and had words with Acosta, then
ejected him.</TE>
<TE>   Valdes still got out of the inning, getting Salmon and Palmeiro to
pop up and Molina to fly to right.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some guys who might have been pressing," Scioscia said.
"You get up there with a runner on base and you start thinking, 'OK,
this is my chance, I have to do it.' But sometimes it's not because
of pressure. Sometimes the pitcher makes a great pitch."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes your pitcher does a good enough job to get a victory,
but doesn't. Scott Schoeneweis deserved better. He went seven
innings, allowing three earned runs.</TE>
<TE>   Carl Everett tied the score, 1-1, with a homer in the fourth.
Rodriguez gave the Rangers the lead with a double in a three-run
fifth. Rafael Palmeiro followed with a run-scoring single and a
throwing error by Spiezio allowed another to score.</TE>

<HD>A New View for Erstad, Glaus</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Precautions and prescriptions altered the Angel lineup considerably
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Darin Erstad, who went face-first into the center-field wall
trying to make a catch Tuesday, was moved to designated hitter. Third
baseman Troy Glaus, who left Tuesday's game with contact lens
problems, was on the bench.</LD>
<LD>   Manager Mike Scioscia said he wanted to rest Erstad a little, with
the Angels playing a 1 p.m. game at Oakland today.</LD>
<TE>   But Glaus' vision troubles may be more of a problem. He was
available Wednesday as a pinch-hitter or defensive replacement, but
only "under the right circumstances," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Glaus would return to the lineup today was unknown.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been something he has dealt with on and off for a couple
years," Scioscia said. "He has had problems with clarity. His vision
became more labored last night."</TE>
<TE>   Glaus struck out with runners on second and third in the first
inning Tuesday. He struck out with runners on first and second in the
second inning.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not super concerned about this," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Glaus has struck out 11 times in 41 at-bats this season. He
struck out 158 times last season, 163 times in 2000 and 143 times in
1999.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A brief question-and-answer session with Glaus about his vision
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What happened with your contact lenses?</TE>
<TE>   A: It's just a little problem, they're trying to fix it.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do they fall out of your eye?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Texas Rangers optioned John Rocker to triple-A Oklahoma early
Wednesday, after he blew a save opportunity by giving up two runs in
the 10th inning of the Rangers' 6-5 loss to the Angels the night
before.</LD>
<LD>   "John's performance just hadn't been what we think his ability
is," General Manager John Hart said.</LD>
<LD>   Rocker was 0-1 with one save, two blown saves and a 9.53
earned-run average.</LD>
<TE>   Cleveland Indian pitcher Chuck Finley filed for divorce from
actress Tawny Kitaen only days after she was arrested for allegedly
hitting him.</TE>
<TE>   Finley, 39, filed divorce papers in Orange County Superior Court
on April 4 and obtained a temporary restraining order preventing
Kitaen from seeing him. He also received temporary custody of the
couple's two daughters, ages 9 and 3.</TE>
<TE>   The St. Louis Cardinals intend to put struggling right-hander Andy
Benes on the disabled list, and the pitcher is contemplating
retirement.</TE>
<TE>   He lasted three innings in a 14-5 loss at Arizona on Monday,
giving up 10 runs--three earned--and was seen saying goodbye to
teammates and former teammates with the Diamondbacks before Wednesday
night's game in Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   The Florida Marlins put right-hander Julian Tavarez on the 15-day
disabled list because of tendinitis in his shoulder. ... Left-hander
Bill Pulsipher has signed a minor league contract with the New York
Yankees and is pitching for the team in extended spring training. ...
The Oakland Athletics recalled right-hander Mike Fyhrie from triple-A

<KH>MORNING BRIEFING</KH>
<HD>Draftniks Are Way Beyond Hopeless</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They sit with their noses pressed against their computer screens,
their thumbs immersed in media guides, their thoughts filled with a
whirlwind of obscure numbers.</LD>
<LD>   They are the obsessive followers of the NFL draft, known as
draftniks, and this is their big week leading up to Saturday's
opening selections.</LD>
<LD>   "Do you know any draftniks?" writes Bob Sansevere in the St. Paul
Pioneer-Press. "Maybe you're in an intimate relationship with one.
You'll know it if they a.) care more about Ashley Lelie's vital
statistics than yours, b.) would rather work on their mock draft than
spend time with you, c.) yell out Mel Kiper's name in the middle of
the night, or d.) all of the above.</LD>
<TE>   "If you don't know who Ashley Lelie [Hawaii receiver] or Mel Kiper
[analyst] are, good for you. It means you have a life."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who was the first player selected by Dallas owner
Jerry Jones in his first draft with the Cowboys?</TE>
<TE>   This is his life: With his team having fallen on hard times, Jones
has the sixth pick in the draft, and he is bursting with excitement.</TE>
<TE>   "Put me in coach, I'm hot," he told Randy Galloway of the Ft.
Worth Star-Telegram.</TE>
<TE>   "I know, I just know we are going to do well.... I'm not nervous
because I feel this is the most prepared we've been in years for a
draft.... But I'm on the edge of my seat. I'm excited. We really have
the ammo available to us this time."</TE>
<TE>   Sounds like a draftnik with money.</TE>
<TE>   Also exposed to a draft: The changes in Cowboy personnel won't
stop at the sidelines. The organization is also planning new
additions to the roster of its famed cheerleader squad.</TE>
<TE>   The Cowboys have employed the services of Options, a talent search
firm, to conduct a nationwide hunt for new cheerleaders.</TE>
<TE>   "We would like a more diverse cross-section of American women,"
Kelli Finglass, Cowboy cheerleading director, told the Tampa Tribune.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of great talent in places that don't have NFL
teams," said Erin Cameron of Options. "There is no height or weight
criteria. We're looking at the person as a whole."</TE>
<TE>   Uh-huh. Sure they are.</TE>
<TE>   Bad look: With the announcement by the Houston Rockets that they
will have new uniforms next season, sportswriter Jonathan Feigen
expresses his fondest hope in the Houston Chronicle:</TE>
<TE>   "That the Rockets will never again be as stubborn as they were in
forcing the league's most hideous get-ups on the players and fans of
what was then a championship team. The Rockets' uniforms were, from
the start, obviously amateurish and garish. They should have been
burned years ago, long before they became ... out of date ...</TE>
<TE>   "If the move to the stripes was the start of a downward cycle, the
Rockets can hope something beautiful could emerge from exorcising
their curse. If not, at least they can look better."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Quarterback Troy Aikman of UCLA in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Bud Geracie in the San Jose Mercury News: "Cleveland
GM Mark Shapiro said Chuck Finley is experiencing 'the regular ups
and downs people go through in their personal lives,' and who among
us hasn't been pounded with a high-heel shoe by a beauty queen who
used to be married to a rock star?"</TE>

<HD>Clippers Sputter to Off-Season</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Superb efforts by Maggette and Brand are
not enough to prevent 107-103 loss to lowly Golden State.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry Stewart</AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>Corey Maggette scored 27 points and Elton Brand set a team record
with his 55th double-double this season, but the Clippers fell to the
Golden State Warriors, 107-103, Wednesday night in the season finale
for both teams.</LD>
<LD>   Brand had 18 points and 15 rebounds, and Jeff McInnis scored 22
points for the Clippers, who lost for the 10th time in 13 games.</LD>
<LD>   Antawn Jamison scored a season-high 35 points and Jason Richardson
had 23 for the Warriors, who ended a six-game losing streak. Gilbert
Arenas scored 19 points.</LD>
<TE>   Golden State finished in a tie with Chicago for the league's worst
record, giving the teams equal chances--225 of 1,001--to win the top
pick in the NBA draft lottery.</TE>
<TE>   Jamison put the Warriors ahead to stay with a short jumper with
1:16 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Arenas grabbed a loose ball with 32 seconds left, and Richardson
tipped in a missed shot 12 seconds later.</TE>
<TE>   Until Maggette slammed the ball home with 11:34 remaining to play
to tie the score, 80-80, the Clippers hadn't been so close since the
opening tip.</TE>
<TE>   The Warriors threatened to run away with it early as Richardson
and Arenas combined for 21 points in the first quarter en route to a
33-18 advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Jamison scored 11 points in the second quarter and Golden State
opened a 20-point lead before settling for a 61-43 halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   Erick Dampier set a team record and tied an NBA mark with eight
blocked shots in the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Warriors made nearly 56% of their shots in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   McInnis, who sat out his first game this season Tuesday night,
became the first Clipper to log more than 3,000 minutes in a season
since Mark Jackson in 1992-93.... The Clipper starters all wore
headbands in the first half. Only Earl Boykins didn't wear one during
warmups.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers, who finished their season without an over-the-air
television broadcast partner and still don't have one lined up for
next season, at least have a radio station.</TE>
<TE>   The team announced Wednesday that it has reached a five-year
agreement with KXTA (1150).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers previously had two two-year agreements with the
station.</TE>
<TE>   "We have had a great relationship over the last four years and are
looking forward to the next five," KXTA Manager Greg Ashlock said.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Roeser, the Clippers' executive vice president, said there
will be no tape delays and "very, very few conflicts."</TE>

for a 6-3 victory over Rockies and a 5-4 trip. Ishii is 3-0.</DH>

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers exited Coors Field on Wednesday without the usual gaudy
offensive statistics associated with the hitters' haven.</LD>
<LD>   The only significant number in double digits was the 11 runners
they left on base in the final game of their three-game series
against the Colorado Rockies.</LD>
<LD>   But the Dodgers managed to overcome what has become an early
shortcoming and defeated the Rockies, 6-3, before 32,878.</LD>
<TE>   Chad Kreuter had a bases-loaded sacrifice fly and pinch-hitter
Dave Hansen followed with a two-run double in a three-run seventh
inning that helped the Dodgers take two out of three from the Rockies
and finish their nine-game trip 5-4.</TE>
<TE>   "It turns out to be a good series, a good road trip," said Dodger
Manager Jim Tracy, whose team improved to 8-7. "We know it could have
been better."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's victory marked the first time during the trip that the
Dodgers scored more than five runs. And for the first time in three
games here against the Rockies, they scored in more than one inning.</TE>
<TE>   "That was something new for us," said second baseman Mark
Grudzielanek, who doubled and scored on Shawn Green's single in the
first inning. "We got out there early and were able to put some
things together after we missed so many opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   Rookie left-hander Kazuhisa Ishii wasn't nearly as sharp as he was
in his first two outings, but he overcame early wildness and improved
to 3-0 with some outstanding help from relievers Jesse Orosco,
Giovanni Carrara and closer Eric Gagne, who earned his fifth save.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii faced the Rockies in his major league debut April 6 and
shook off spring-training jitters to record 10 strikeouts in 52/3
shutout innings at Dodger Stadium. He followed that performance with
six shutout innings against the San Diego Padres in a 3-0 victory at
San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   But Wednesday, Ishii pitched from behind in the count through the
first 31/3 innings. He gave up four consecutive singles to start the
game as the Rockies scored twice in the first inning on an RBI single
by Benny Agbayani and a groundout by Greg Norton that drove in Todd
Helton from third. Colorado added another run in the third on a
sacrifice fly by Terry Shumpert.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii walked Mark Little to start the fourth inning, then retired
nine consecutive batters before he was removed after throwing 92
pitches in six innings.</TE>
<TE>   "The feeling was different," Ishii said through interpreter Scott
Akasaki. "The angle of the curveball was different. But it was a good
learning experience for me today, so when I come to Coors Field next
time I can make adjustments accordingly."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers had at least one runner in scoring position in each of
the first five innings against left-hander Mike Hampton, but the
score was tied, 3-3, heading into the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Center fielder Marquis Grissom, celebrating his 35th birthday, led
off the seventh with a double to right field against reliever Rick
White (0-1) and Eric Karros reached on an error. White walked Adrian
Beltre to load the bases and was replaced by Todd Jones, who gave up
a fly ball to right to Kreuter.</TE>
<TE>   Little's throw appeared to beat Grissom to the plate, but he slid
beneath the tag to put the Dodgers ahead, 4-3. Hansen then pinch-hit
for Ishii and flared a double down the left-field line, scoring
Karros and Beltre.</TE>
<TE>   "That gives me a lot of confidence," said Hansen, who is two for
nine this season. "We had some chances and weren't able to take
advantage of them, so to go up there and deliver was great."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers scored one run in the first on Green's RBI single but
stranded two runners. They scored again in the second inning when
Hampton walked Grudzielanek with the bases loaded with one out. But
Hampton struck out Green and got Brian Jordan to ground out.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan's double in the fourth gave the Dodgers a 3-2 lead, but
Green was thrown out at the plate on the play.</TE>
<TE>   "When you play 162 games, you're going to play some you're not
particularly proud of," Tracy said. "But we won a ballgame."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Daal Gets Chance to Start Tonight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Omar Daal wants to be a starter so badly, he demanded a trade after
he was not named to the Dodger rotation in late March.</LD>
<LD>   General Manager Dan Evans told Daal's agent there was no way the
team was going to move a pitcher with a staff that had two starting
pitchers coming off elbow surgery. Daal was an insurance policy,
Evans said, and starting opportunities were certain to come.</LD>
<LD>   The opportunity is here.</LD>
<TE>   Daal, a left-hander who has made 124 starts for three other teams,
will start for the Dodgers for the first time today at Dodger Stadium
against the San Diego Padres. He is replacing right-hander Kevin
Brown, who reinjured his throwing arm last Saturday against the
Padres in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Daal is 1-0 with a 2.16 earned-run average in four relief
appearances this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been throwing two or more innings every time I've gone out
there so I'm not worried about starting," Daal said. "I'm just going
to take it pitch by pitch, hitter by hitter and inning by inning."</TE>
<TE>   Daal, 30, is in his second tour with the Dodgers. He was
originally signed as a nondrafted free-agent in 1990 and made 99
relief appearances in 1993-95 before he was traded to the Montreal
Expos for minor league pitcher Rick Clelland.</TE>
<TE>   Daal also played for the Toronto Blue Jays, Arizona Diamondbacks
and Philadelphia Phillies before returning to the Dodgers last
November in a trade for minor league right-handers Jesus Cordero and
Eric Junge.</TE>
<TE>   Daal was 13-7 with a 4.46 ERA in 32 starts and 1852/3 innings last
season for Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd be a starting pitcher for most other teams in baseball--we
just happen to be stacked with a bunch of good ones," pitching coach
Jim Colborn said. "He's a great luxury and we're really lucky we've
got reserves like him."</TE>
<TE>   Brown played catch for 10 minutes from 75 feet Wednesday at Dodger
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger officials said he experienced no pain and that swelling
continues to subside.</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Shawn Green went two for five and drove in a run in the
Dodgers' 6-3 victory over the Colorado Rockies. He is now 12 for 14
with 10 runs batted in against Colorado left-hander Mike Hampton.</TE>
<TE>   Green raised his season average from .216 to .232, but also struck
out twice against Hampton and once against Kent Mercker. He was seven
for 35 during the trip.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a ways to go," Green said. "It's kind of an annual April
for me. I just have to try and battle and do what I can to ride it
out."</TE>

<HD>Relatively Speaking, Mickelson Did Fine</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tina Mickelson posed the question to her mom Sunday on the 17th hole
at Augusta National.</LD>
<LD>   "You know," she said, "what would it be like if Tiger was not born
in the same era? If Tiger could be 10 now, where would Phil be?"</LD>
<LD>   Where indeed would Phil Mickelson be without Tiger Woods in the
mix?</LD>
<TE>   It is pure conjecture, of course, but he probably would be the
world's No. 1-ranked player, instead of settling for No. 2.</TE>
<TE>   He probably would have posted more than the 20 PGA Tour victories
currently on his resume--and he might even have bagged a major
championship or two.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe then there wouldn't be so much criticism leveled his way.
People are not so quick to judge the best there is.</TE>
<TE>   These are some of the things going through the mind of Mickelson's
only sister.</TE>
<TE>   As a teaching pro at Riverwalk Golf Course in San Diego, Tina
Mickelson, 33, obviously knows the game. And being admittedly
protective of both of her younger brothers--Tim Mickelson, 24, is an
assistant golf coach at San Diego State--she feels for Phil as only a
sibling can.</TE>
<TE>   The point has been raised repeatedly this week that Mickelson, 31,
is now 0 for 39 in majors. She sees it this way: He has 15 top-10
finishes in majors, which is more success than most players can even
dream of attaining.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say Mickelson is too aggressive and that the risks he
takes are a large part of what is keeping him from becoming a truly
great player. She says his aggressive style of play, while costly at
times, is also what earned him so much success.</TE>
<TE>   "He takes shots that other people would not normally take because
they don't have those shots in their bag," she said. "Phil has never
taken a shot that he wasn't confident he could make. And God help the
person who comes up to me and wants to start a debate about all of
this."</TE>
<TE>   Which takes us to Sunday. Ironically, Mickelson was in a position
where he had to play aggressively if he was going to catch Woods, who
started the final round four strokes ahead and in a tie for the lead
with Retief Goosen.</TE>
<TE>   Between them were Vijay Singh, Ernie Els and Sergio Garcia. All
were aware of Woods' impeccable record in these situations; they
needed birdies on a day they would be especially hard to come by,
given the length of the course and the tough pin placements.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson fared better than those ahead of him, and for the most
part matched Woods shot for shot, ultimately carding the same score,
a 71. Had he not stumbled with bogeys on Nos. 3 and 4, had a few more
putts fallen, and had Woods not chipped in at No. 6, the gap might
have been closed considerably.</TE>
<TE>   It seemed unfair to lump Mickelson, who finished third, with
Singh, Els and Garcia as players who caved under the pressure
generated by the mere presence of Woods atop the leaderboard Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   But there he was lumped, and Tina Mickelson, standing there with
her mom, could hear the disparaging remarks blowing in the wind.</TE>
<TE>   "Phil has been criticized for being too aggressive and now the big
topic is that everybody cowered under the pressure and was not
aggressive enough," she said. "You're damned if you do and damned if
you don't."</TE>
<TE>   And so that's the way the ball bounces where the Mickelsons are
concerned. But at least there is the support of an extended family to
fall back on. The Masters is their version of the annual family
vacation. This year, the gathering numbered 13, which some might
consider unlucky.</TE>
<TE>   Phil foots the bill for the rental home and hires a cook so he
doesn't have to deal with the public. In the house, there is one
unwritten rule: No talking about golf.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the one week that our family spends most of its time
together," Tina Mickelson said. "We go out and watch him play and
then we usually stay home and watch TV at night. Of course, Phil is
in an entirely different mind frame than the rest of us. It's not
like I can go up to him and discuss boyfriend problems or anything,
because he has so many other things on his mind."</TE>
<TE>   Major things, no doubt.</TE>
<TE>   The Shark Bites</TE>
<TE>   "The Par Report" on Greg Norman's Web site, www.shark.com, talks
about Woods' domination and suggests that the only hope for the rest
of the tour is that Woods marries his girlfriend, Swedish model Erin
Nordegren, and gets distracted by family life.</TE>
<TE>   It goes on to refer to those chasing Tiger on Sunday as "the
Masters of disaster." How soon those in Norman's corner seem to
forget who the real master of that is. On a certain Sunday in 1996 it
was Norman who squandered a six-stroke lead, shooting a 78 and losing
by five to Nick Faldo.</TE>
<TE>   Not So Fast</TE>
<TE>   Michael Wilbon of ESPN on the prospect of a Woods-Nordegren union:
"If I'm Tiger, the word marriage is not entering my vocabulary for
the next 10 years at least, and if any woman in a seat in my car said
'marriage' on a date, I would hit the Buick ejector [button] ...
gone!"</TE>
<TE>   To this Tony Kornheiser replied, "You don't really think he drives
a Buick, do you?"</TE>
<TE>   Money Player</TE>
<TE>   An unidentified individual or group submitted the winning bid of
$425,000 on eBay for a round of golf with Woods at his home course,
Islesworth, in Windermere, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   The auction, which ended Sunday, benefits the Tiger Woods
Foundation. The package includes 18 holes of golf, lunch, a picture
with Woods and an autographed item for members of the foursome.</TE>
<TE>   Bubba Steps</TE>
<TE>   Reigning U.S. Amateur champion Ben "Bubba" Dickerson announced
this week that he is turning pro. Dickerson, who left the University
of Florida in January and will turn 21 next month, will make his
professional debut April 25-28 at the Greater Greensboro Chrysler
Classic, playing on a sponsor exemption.</TE>
<TE>   Dickerson missed the cut at the Masters but was one of the longest
hitters with an average drive of 293.5 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Birdies, Bogeys and Pars</TE>
<TE>   Hal Linden, Jamie Farr, Bruce Jenner, Alan Thicke, Ann Meyers,
Norm Crosby and Tom Dreesen are among the celebrities scheduled to

<DH>After Bad Experience at Sydney, Dantzscher Loves UCLA</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TUSCALOOSA, Ala.</DL>
<LD>Gymnastics had consumed her life since she was 9 years old and first
discovered the exhilaration of flying on uneven bars. But when
pressures of elite competition threatened to also consume her spirit,
Jamie Dantzscher of San Dimas had to walk away to find sustenance for
her soul.</LD>
<LD>   She didn't lose a career when she took a step back after the
Sydney Olympics, where she had dared to criticize coaching guru Bela
Karolyi--the U.S. women's team's coordinator--after the squad's
non-medal finish. She gained a new perspective on herself and what
matters after she enrolled at UCLA, which will try for its third
consecutive NCAA gymnastics team championship beginning today at the
University of Alabama.</LD>
<LD>   "I think I was very misunderstood by my coaches and even sometimes
by my parents and other people," said Dantzscher, who set a national
record this season by earning seven consecutive perfect 10s on floor
exercise. "Gymnastics was my life. It was very difficult at times.
Sometimes I didn't seem like the happiest person.</LD>
<TE>   "It's funny. People come in [to the gym] and say, 'Wow, she's
bouncing off the walls.' That's me. I'm very seldom in a bad mood. It
takes a lot to put me there."</TE>
<TE>   She had reason to be unhappy during and after the Games.</TE>
<TE>   In a decision she disputed, Karolyi didn't choose her to compete
on the balance beam or uneven bars, keeping her out of the all-around
finals. The team finished fourth, widely considered a failure after
the 1996 team's gold-medal exploits at Atlanta. Karolyi said the 2000
athletes "did not have that same backbone, they did not have that
same work ethic" as their predecessors.</TE>
<TE>   Dantzscher's response was blunt. "Bela takes credit when we do
good and blames everyone else when we do bad. It's so not fair," she
said. "He has too much control, too much control of the U.S. team.
It's horrible. It's sad."</TE>
<TE>   Officials of USA Gymnastics, the sport's governing body, urged her
to soften her stance. She refused. A controversy flared until it was
eclipsed by the news that Dantzscher's father, John, and sister,
Jennifer, had been hurt when the taxi in which they were riding was
broadsided by a bus on a Sydney street.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer's injuries were minor. But John, a produce manager at a
Glendale grocery store, suffered a serious brain injury and lasting
impairment. He was in a coma for a week and confined to a Sydney
hospital for five weeks; when he came home and began rehabilitation,
Jamie had left to perform on a post-Olympics tour.</TE>
<TE>   "That was definitely a difficult time," she said, her voice
thickening with emotion. "People that don't know him would never
guess [his injury]. We know, our family members, that he's different.
In some ways, some of the changes he's gone through have been more
good than bad. He's more sensitive, maybe. I don't know if it's his
brain injury. His appreciation for life is definitely better.
Sometimes that's hard too."</TE>
<TE>   Starting at UCLA for the winter quarter was a welcome diversion.
She plunged into her studies--she's considering a major in psychology
or communications--and rekindled her enthusiasm for gymnastics.</TE>
<TE>   It's different, though, because her self-esteem no longer rests on
whether she lands a vault perfectly, wobbles while doing a pirouette
on the 4-inch-wide balance beam or loses favor because some newcomer
catches a coach's eye.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, it was like gymnastics was my life. That was my life,
training for the Olympics," said Dantzscher, who will be 20 next
month. "Now it's like here, I have gymnastics still, the sport I
love, my passion, but I'm also out in the real world. I'm doing other
things. I want to be a schoolteacher, and I'm experiencing other
things I've always wanted to experience."</TE>
<TE>   Her happiness was evident in the gym. She earned 10s for her first
two routines in her first meet, on the bars and in floor exercise,
and earned five more 10s as a freshman. She also placed second in
floor exercise at last year's NCAA meet. This season, she was voted
Pac-10 gymnast of the year after averaging 9.9 or more on vault, bars
and floor exercise and recording three 9.9s on beam.</TE>
<TE>   A tendon problem in her left ankle hampered her late in the
season, but she has pushed through it.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had quite a few people say how nice it is to see her smile
during competition," Bruin Coach Valorie Kondos Field said. "I'm
like, 'What do you mean? She's always like this.' Well, she hasn't
always been like that, and it's nice to see her come into her own."</TE>
<TE>   Dantzscher ranks first in the nation in floor exercise and bars
and second on vault, a key factor in the Bruins' No. 1 national
ranking. Kondos Field called her "the optimal team player" because
she was embarrassed to receive so many perfect scores until Kondos
Field pointed out all those 10s boosted the team's score.</TE>
<TE>   "She's extremely bright. She's extremely talented. She's got to be
the most talented female gymnast in the history of college athletics,
without a question," said Kondos Field, coach of the year four times
in the past six seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "She's got the talent, she's got the strength, she's got the
brains and she's got that God-given gift called charisma. Put that
all together and she's a perfect package. And I have to add to that
she's as humble as she is talented. She has a heart as big as gold.
It's important for me to encourage her, all of her energy, in a
positive direction without stifling her spirit."</TE>
<TE>   The fire within her still burns bright.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many times Jamie is not the easiest athlete to coach,
and sometimes you want to wring her neck," Kondos Field said. "She is
constantly testing you. Constantly. A lot of times she just really
wants to know why, and if you give her respect of being cognizant
she's a human being and explain yourself, she'll say, 'Thank you for
explaining it,' and she'll do it."</TE>
<TE>   She feels she didn't get that respect at Sydney, and she has no
regrets about condemning the confusion that resulted when the
personal and team coaches jockeyed for power. "I know some people
probably thought I was a little brat," she said, but she stands by
her sentiments.</TE>
<TE>   "People looked at us like, 'They're a team that's going to
college. They're rebels and they're bad,' and that just wasn't the
way it was at all," she said. "We had as much focus and desire as any
other team did. They [the coaches] tried to change things and make it
more, I don't know, I guess they were trying to help.</TE>
<TE>   "Things were very negative there and I think it could have been
done in a very different way. The experience of the Olympics could
have been much different for all of us. That's why I said something
....Those people are not a part of my life anymore. I have other
people that are a part of my life and it's more important to be
respected by them."</TE>
<TE>   Her 14-year-old twin sisters, Jalynne and Janelle, are gymnasts,
and she has cautioned them about the politics at the sport's upper
levels. However, she said her experiences at Sydney aren't the reason
she's not inclined to try out for the 2004 Olympic team.</TE>
<TE>   "If I have to give an answer now I would say no, just because I'm
really enjoying the college part of it," she said. "It's more
team-oriented and it's a lot of fun. And my priorities are different
now. School comes first. My education will come before my gymnastics,
and to train for the Olympics again would be [making] gymnastics my
No. 1 priority again, and I don't know if I want to go back to that.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying that I don't think I could. I think if I tried,
I'd have a good chance of making it, actually. What's hard is people
get confused. They're like, 'If you can, you should, or you'll regret
it.' No, I mean, I already went through that part of my life and I'm
content with where I am now."</TE>

<HD>Johannesburg Likely for Derby</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Johannesburg, the Irish-based colt who won last year's Breeders' Cup
Juvenile but has never run beyond seven furlongs except in that race,
is headed for the Kentucky Derby, based on comments made by his
trainer, Aidan O'Brien, to two European publications.</LD>
<LD>   "Our 3-year-olds can't all run in the 2000 Guineas," O'Brien was
quoted in the Racing Post, referring to the race in England on May 4,
same day as the Derby. "We are very close to making a decision, but
if everything went well in the meantime, we would have to go."</LD>
<LD>   O'Brien has hired Jerry Bailey, the rider who has won the Derby
twice, to ride Castle Gandolfo, another of the trainer's horses who
would run in the Derby. Mick Kinane, who has ridden Johannesburg in
all his races, including the Breeders' Cup win at 11/16 miles on dirt
at Belmont Park in October, will continue to ride that colt.</LD>
<TE>   "It looks likely that both horses will go to Kentucky," O'Brien
told the Irish Times.</TE>
<TE>   Johannesburg won all six starts last year, culminating in the
Belmont win that led to his being voted the best 2-year-old male in
North America. A rainy Irish winter slowed his progress as a
3-year-old, however, and in his only start this year he was nosed out
by a good 4-year-old filly, Rebelline, in a seven-furlong grass race
at the Curragh near Dublin on April 7. The Breeders' Cup has been
Johannesburg's only race on dirt.</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien, the perennial leading trainer in Ireland, has three or
four other 3-year-olds lined up to run in the 2000 Guineas, which is
the first race in the English Triple Crown.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his record, Johannesburg's ability to negotiate the Derby
distance of 11/4 miles has been questioned. U.S. horses usually prep
for the Derby with two or more races as 3-year-olds. The last horse
to win the Derby off only one 3-year-old prep was Bold Venture in
1936.</TE>
<TE>   Johannesburg probably would make the seven-hour flight to Kentucky
about a week before the Derby. Because Churchill Downs doesn't
maintain a year-round quarantine station, the colt would have to
spend about 48 hours at Keeneland, 70 miles away, while his blood
work is processed by a federal laboratory in Iowa.</TE>

<HD>Etiwanda's Poe Is Picking Up Pace</HD>
<DH>Cross-country: Junior surprised himself, returning from
illness to run state's second-fastest time in 1,600.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Did you hear about Poe?</LD>
<LD>   That was the question of the hour on Saturday evening as
spectators arrived for the invitational session of the Arcadia
Invitational track and field meet.</LD>
<LD>   The invitational session at Arcadia High annually produces a slew
of nation- and state-leading season marks. But junior Michael Poe of
Etiwanda High had stunned himself and most of those in attendance at
the open session earlier in the day, when he won the second race of
the boys' 1,600 meters in 4 minutes 12.92 seconds.</LD>
<TE>   The time lowered Poe's previous best by nearly 10 seconds and was
the fastest in the state this year, until junior Phillip Reid of
Oxnard Rio Mesa ran 4:12.25 to place fourth in the invitational race
Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people didn't really think I could run that fast, and
neither did I," Poe said. "I was hoping to break the school record
[of 4:20.80 set by Kent Lawson in 1999], but the race was crazy. Six
guys broke 4:19 and eight broke 4:20."</TE>
<TE>   Poe's performance, which he capped with a 59.7-second last lap,
was more impressive because he missed two weeks of training in March
when he became ill after having his tongue pierced.</TE>
<TE>   "I was mad," Poe said about the illness. "I was hoping my season
wouldn't go down from there."</TE>
<TE>   It didn't, thanks to a variety of reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Poe obeyed his doctor's orders and didn't train for two weeks.
That allowed him to recover from the illness before he began running
again.</TE>
<TE>   He had also built up a large endurance base since last summer,
when he frequently ran 100 miles a week. That allowed him to maintain
much of his fitness, despite being sidelined.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Poe is an innately strong runner.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike's strength is his strength," said Charles Hicks, who began
coaching Etiwanda's middle- and long-distance runners in January.
"Mike doesn't have the great speed on the track, but he has superb
strength. He's just so powerful and can run so hard for so long that
it's hard for people to go with him."</TE>
<TE>   Poe, who will run in the 3,000 and the distance medley relay
during the high school portion of the Mt. San Antonio College Relays
on Saturday, first caught people's attention as a sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   He ran a notable 15:28 over Mt. SAC's 2.91-mile cross-country
course and finished 28th in the 2000 Southern Section Division I
final. He failed to advance to the final of the Division I track
championships last May, but his best of 4:24.97 in the 1,600 was
notable for a sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   Then came last summer, when he and Erick Maldonado of Chino Don
Lugo trained together.</TE>
<TE>   The training went so well that Poe, who felt he wasn't getting
enough individual attention at Etiwanda, applied for a transfer to
Don Lugo.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern Section turned down his request, but Poe said he came
to the realization that Etiwanda cross-country Coach Kevin Uhl was
doing the best job he could while working with a group of 50 runners.</TE>
<TE>   Poe had a superb junior cross-country season, winning the Mt.
Baldy League title before finishing fourth in the Division I finals
of the section and state championships.</TE>
<TE>   He ran a career-best of 4:24.17 in the mile to place third in the
L.A. Invitational indoor track meet at the Sports Arena on Feb. 23
and anchored Etiwanda to a then-yearly state-leading time of 10:29.04
in the distance medley relay at the Long Beach Millikan Invitational
on March 2. Then came the illness after getting his tongue pierced.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't get a gold star for clear thinking," Hicks said with a
laugh. "Oh to be 16 again ... and idiotic."</TE>
<TE>   Hicks, 72, returned to coaching two years ago after earning a
reputation for producing high-quality mile-relay teams while at
Chaffey College from 1965-83. He is old school but says Poe and
Etiwanda runners such as Kyle Sunderland have been receptive to his
training ideas.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike is very coachable," Hicks said. "He's very accepting. He
gives you 100% whether he believes in what you're doing or not."</TE>
<TE>   Confidence is Poe's greatest asset, according to state Division I
cross-country champion Maldonado.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a good athlete," Maldonado said. "He trains hard. He works
hard, but most of all, he believes in himself. When you have talent,
train hard and believe in yourself, you can accomplish a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Poe, whose slight drawl reveals his parents' Kansas roots, has no
intention of resting on his Arcadia laurels that also include a split
of 4:17 for his 1,600 leg in the distance medley relay.</TE>
<TE>   He's looking forward again to teaming with Sunderland, the
third-fastest 800 runner in the state, Dane Simmons and Tony Chavez
in the distance medley relay at Mt. SAC and to running against highly
regarded Billy Nelson of Taft in the 3,000.</TE>
<TE>   "All I have to do is progress from here," Poe said. "I can't just
do it once and not again."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The seventh race on a normal weekday card at Santa Anita, Hollywood
Park or Del Mar is usually the day's feature race.</LD>
<LD>   This afternoon, on the 82nd of 85 programs in Arcadia, the seventh
is a $62,500 claimer for older horses going 11/8 miles on the turf.</LD>
<LD>   Before scoffing at the fact the race is a claimer, take note that
the eight entrants have combined to win 47 races from 205 starts and
earned over $1.7 million.</LD>
<TE>   The richest of the eight veterans--and the 3-1 morning line
favorite--is Martiniquais.</TE>
<TE>   A 9-year-old horse trained by Bobby Frankel for owner Ed Gann, the
Irish-bred has banked $680,869 while winning 10 of 42. Victories have
been rarer in recent years, however.</TE>
<TE>   He is only one for 11 since the beginning of 2001, but five of his
lifetime wins have come at today's distance.</TE>
<TE>   A former Frankel runner, Quianlong, is second in the field in
terms of wins with nine.</TE>
<TE>   A loser in his first three starts of the year, the 7-year-old
Zilzal horse won in his third race for trainer Mike Mitchell, beating
$50,000 claimers on April 6.</TE>
<TE>   He will again be ridden by Laffit Pincay Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Four races earlier, Snowflake will go for her third win in as many
U.S. starts when she takes on only four rivals going a mile on the
turf.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: De Bertie, who has won nine of 22, will attempt
to improve to six for 11 at 1 1/16 miles in the $100,000
Doubledogdare at Keeneland. Her opponents include the Frankel-trained
Waki Music, who will be making her first start on dirt.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Robby Albarado. The jockey began the week at Keeneland
on top of the standings with 17 victories.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Ricardo Zamora. The trainer, who will start longshot
Flower Lane in today's eighth at Santa Anita, is 0 for 19 in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Snowflake in the third,
using Rock Cod Johnny, Splendid Times and A One Rocket in the fourth,
and using Ace's Valentine and Charlie's Good Girl in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/223. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $11.60/$1,288.84. Total money bet: $1,394.</TE>

<KH>STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS</KH>
<HD>Kings Can't Just Skate By</HD>
<DH>Simply Qualifying for the Playoffs Used to Be Enough, but
Improvement Since Last Season Has Raised Expectations</DH>

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Playoff combatants for the second consecutive season, the
star-studded Colorado Avalanche and the no-name Kings took
surprisingly similar paths to the rematch beginning tonight in the
Pepsi Center.</LD>
<LD>   Both overcame the loss of key players and early-season
inconsistency. Both won with tight defense, strong special teams and
stingy goaltending.</LD>
<LD>   And now both carry the weight of great expectations.</LD>
<TE>   For the Avalanche, defending Stanley Cup champion and winner of
eight consecutive division titles, this is business as usual.</TE>
<TE>   For the Kings, rarely a playoff force, this is new territory.</TE>
<TE>   Probably for the first time since 1993, when they made their one
and only advance beyond the second round of the playoffs and reached
the Stanley Cup finals, the Kings are involved in a first-round
series many view as a tossup.</TE>
<TE>   Only four points separated the Avalanche, which won the Northwest
Division championship with 99 points and is seeded second in the
West, from the Kings, who finished third in the Pacific Division and
are seeded seventh.</TE>
<TE>   "If the expectations are greater this year, I like that," King
Coach Andy Murray said this week, "because it must mean that people
are acknowledging that we've done some better things this year."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings were delirious last season after upsetting the Detroit
Red Wings before pushing the Avalanche to the brink of elimination in
the Western Conference semifinals. They lost in Game 7, 5-1, in the
Pepsi Center.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings hadn't won a playoff game in eight years, so defenseman
Aaron Miller understood the reaction--kind of. But he used to play
for the Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, I think maybe too many people were too happy," said
Miller, traded to the Kings late last season in the deal that sent
Rob Blake to the Avalanche. "I mean, we had a decent [showing], but
we won one round....</TE>
<TE>   "It was just a different atmosphere for me. This organization
hadn't won a playoff round in six or seven or however many years, so
to beat Detroit coming back from two games down, that was a major
accomplishment. But it was only one round."</TE>
<TE>   This time, Miller acknowledged, the bar has been raised.</TE>
<TE>   "And that's the way it should be," he said. "I don't understand
working hard to get to the playoffs and then not expecting to win the
whole thing."</TE>
<TE>   Last year's experience should help, center Bryan Smolinski said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's gut-wrenching to lose in the final game like that and the
other team goes on to win the Stanley Cup," he said. "We were that
close and I think we expect a lot from ourselves, and so do our
coaches. Our fans should too."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the off-season departure of high-scoring left wing Luc
Robitaille and the early-season losses of Jozef Stumpel and Glen
Murray in the trade that brought top-line center Jason Allison from
the Boston Bruins, the Kings posted the NHL's best record after Dec.
8, recovering from an 8-14-4-2 start.</TE>
<TE>   Their 2.29 goals-against average was the best in franchise
history, and goaltenders Felix Potvin and Jamie Storr both posted
career-best goals-against averages.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings led the league in power-play goals and power-play
efficiency, and they ranked third in penalty killing, after finishing
24th last season.</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche, meanwhile, adjusted to the retirement of Ray
Bourque and the absence of All-Star center Peter Forsberg, who
returns tonight after sitting out the regular season, by emphasizing
defense in front of Patrick Roy.</TE>
<TE>   Arguably the greatest goaltender in NHL history, with a resume
that includes a record 137 playoff victories and four Stanley Cup
championships, the 36-year-old Roy enjoyed what he called "my best
year," leading the league with a career-best 1.94 goals-against
average.</TE>
<TE>   With Blake, Adam Foote, Greg de Vries and trading-deadline
acquisition Darius Kasparaitis leading the defense in front of the
goaltender, the Avalanche set a franchise record by giving up a
league-low 169 goals.</TE>
<TE>   That helped compensate for a drop in productivity by 2001 league
MVP Joe Sakic, whose goals and points fell from 54 and 118 to 26 and
79, and an overall dip in offensive firepower. Also without injured
right wing Milan Hejduk for the season's last 20 games, the Avalanche
scored 212 goals, fewest in franchise history, and was shut out 10
times, also a franchise record.</TE>
<TE>   The defending champions still were potent on the power play,
however, finishing fifth in the league. They were second in penalty
killing.</TE>
<TE>   They were 2-2 against the Kings, who outscored them, 14-13.</TE>
<TE>   After similar seasons, the teams now share similar goals.</TE>
<TE>   And Murray said this week that, in his mind, the Kings step onto
the ice tonight on equal footing with the defending champions.</TE>
<TE>   His players agree. The expectations, they say, are warranted.</TE>
<TE>   "We have those expectations on ourselves," captain Mattias
Norstrom said. "I don't think we have any problem with that. We want
to do some damage."</TE>

<HD>It Has Been a Group Effort</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Despite slow start, Kings never made excuses and
eventually turned season around through teamwork and hard work.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kings' season could have fallen apart before it really began,
after they had won merely five of their first 18 games and Coach Andy
Murray declared them "an insult to every parent that's ever taken
their kid to play in a hockey game at 5:30 in the morning like their
parents did for them."</LD>
<LD>   They had many ways to rationalize their failures.</LD>
<LD>   They could have said they missed the physical presence of Rob
Blake, who was traded to Colorado in March 2001, and the power-play
prowess of Luc Robitaille, who left as a free agent last summer. They
could have blamed Jason Allison's rustiness after he ended a contract
dispute and was acquired from the Boston Bruins on Oct. 24. They
could have cited injuries to Ziggy Palffy, Mathieu Schneider and
Aaron Miller.</LD>
<TE>   And they certainly could have blamed the emotional blow they
suffered Sept. 11, when scouting director Ace Bailey and scout Mark
Bavis died aboard the United Airlines plane that was hijacked and
crashed into the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   "We were finding ways to lose games early in the year," defenseman
Philippe Boucher said. "We played a lot of one-goal games and lost."</TE>
<TE>   But when they could have fractured, the Kings instead bonded to
form a strong whole. They never lost sight of their potential, even
when they weren't fulfilling it. "We regrouped," Murray said, "and we
got our compete back."</TE>
<TE>   They didn't soar for a week or two after Murray scorched their
pride following a 4-2 loss at Detroit on Nov. 17. But once they
learned to work with what they had instead of bemoaning what they'd
lost, the Kings became a force in the tough Western Conference,
finishing seventh overall to earn a first-round playoff matchup
against the Colorado Avalanche starting tonight at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Allison was the lone King among the NHL's top 25 scorers, and
their defense corps has no one like Blake, who can change a game with
a hit or a slap shot from the point. But they have resilience,
tenacity and balance, prize commodities in an era when some general
managers spend lavishly on a franchise player and try to economize
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "You certainly can't replace a guy like Rob Blake, who, year in
and year out, is one of the top two defensemen in the league,"
defenseman Mattias Norstrom said. "But you've got to find a way to
replace what he did offensively and defensively for us. In our case,
it took all six of us [defensemen] to do it."</TE>
<TE>   While the New York Rangers threw millions of dollars at Pavel Bure
and Eric Lindros, and the Washington Capitals acquired Jaromir Jagr
and upped their payroll by nearly $20 million, the Kings built an
ensemble cast around players who fly just beneath the superstar
radar.</TE>
<TE>   Allison, Palffy and Adam Deadmarsh lack the flair of Bure and
Jagr, but the Rangers and the Capitals, two of the NHL's most
free-spending teams, missed the playoffs--proof that success in the
NHL depends not on how much you spend, but how well you spend. After
apportioning $5.5 million this year and $20 million over three years
to Allison, the Kings' payroll was about $40 million, 10th among 30
teams.</TE>
<TE>   "You can use the analogy of pieces of a puzzle. Everybody has
their part," said forward Brad Chartrand. "Defensively, everyone's
accountable. It seems like it's working out, and there's good
chemistry.</TE>
<TE>   "A team that's close plays for one another. You're counted on
every night by guys you're sitting next to, and you want to play for
them and the other guys on the roster."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, it isn't quite accurate to say the Kings have no superstars.</TE>
<TE>   Allison, strong and always around the puck, averaged a point a
game (74 points in 73 games), a benchmark for a top-six forward.
Those who know hockey rate him an elite player. Deadmarsh, acquired
with Miller in the Blake trade, is dogged around the net. And Palffy
scored 32 goals while playing sound defense, sometimes even blocking
shots.</TE>
<TE>   "Guys respond to things like that," Chartrand said. "When I saw
that, I was pumped up, too....</TE>
<TE>   "I'll put those guys up against any player in the league.
Superstar--is that a word you can use? In our eyes, yes. They're
great players. I practice and play with them every day. At the same
time, they're good team guys as well. They're buying into the
defensive system."</TE>
<TE>   Norstrom, who has settled comfortably into the captaincy he
inherited from Blake, agreed the term "superstar" is relative.</TE>
<TE>   "There's only a handful of superstars in this league," he said.
"We have star players in Ziggy, Jason Allison and Adam Deadmarsh....
It's more important what that player brings to your team. Superstar,
star, franchise player, it doesn't matter what you call them."</TE>
<TE>   Just call the Kings a team, not the frustrated group they were in
November. To Murray, the ultimate compliment during the Kings'
six-game winning streak last month was hearing San Jose Coach Darryl
Sutter describe the Kings as a team that plays hard.</TE>
<TE>   "When we were struggling at the start, we went back to this theme
[from last season] of 'tough to play against,'" Murray said. "And
we've done a pretty good job."</TE>
<TE>   That determination surfaced during a 6-0-1 run in December and an
11-3 surge in January. They were one of the NHL's best road teams,
had the top power play for most of the season and, for a while, also
had the most effective penalty killing. They finished with the top
power play and third-best penalty killing; no team has led the NHL in
both categories since the 1984-85 New York Islanders did so.</TE>
<TE>   "We just had to get used to playing with each other," goaltender
Felix Potvin said. "The good thing, and the thing you've got to keep
in mind, is everybody was patient in management. Nobody was
panicking, like some other teams, and we were able to take the time
to jell."</TE>
<TE>   Time helped Boucher become more confident and prolific when he got
extra power-play time during Schneider's recovery from hernia
surgery. Time also helped Jaroslav Modry blossom from spare part to
All-Star. Realizing Modry would never be a bruiser but was a good
positional player, Murray emphasized the Czech defenseman's strengths
instead of trying to make him something he can't be. Modry's 42
points, many on the power play, were a bonus.</TE>
<TE>   "Modry and Boucher deserve a lot of credit," Norstrom said. "When
they got the chance to do it, they stepped up."</TE>
<TE>   But the next step for the Kings is the most treacherous. Last
spring's first-round victory over the Detroit Red Wings and valiant
seven-game loss to the Avalanche are history, as are the 95 points
they earned this season. They can only hope their slide the last few
weeks of the season will also be irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't maybe have the All-Stars Colorado has, but we have a
gritty lineup and everyone chips in. That's hard to come by,"
Deadmarsh said. "I like that in a team, especially come playoff time.
When everyone chips in, the other team can't focus on one line or one
player."</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Dave Taylor also likes the Kings' chances, based
on their strength in goal and on special teams and their response to
the crises they faced on and off the ice. "Our guys are competitive,
very competitive," he said. "They show up to play every night, and
from a management standpoint, that's all you can ask."</TE>
<TE>   Fans, however, might ask more. The Kings have gotten past the
second round of the playoffs only once, when they lost the 1993
Stanley Cup finals to Montreal. This season's gains, although
respectable, could be overshadowed by an early playoff exit.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult to say, 'Well, the season will only be deemed a
success if we get to the third round,'" Taylor said. "I think when
the season is over, you can sit back and evaluate it. If you play
hard and your team plays well and you get beat at some point, it's
easier to live with that. It's when you feel that you've
underachieved that you feel you have a problem with that."</TE>

<HD>Shaq Not Only Big Center in L.A.</HD>

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>The Lakers aren't the only Los Angeles-based team with a dominant,
versatile center, King Coach Andy Murray said this week, suggesting
that Jason Allison is the hockey equivalent of Shaquille O'Neal.</LD>
<LD>   "You look at some of the things he does and you kind of go, 'Holy
smokes; he's on our side,'" Murray said. "He gives us certainly
playmaking, offensive skills, but he also gives us some grit and bite
up the center-ice position.</LD>
<LD>   "It's nice when your top center can be that kind of player
too--can compete physically. It doesn't matter if you're playing a
Rob Blake or an Adam Foote, he's going to go head to head with them.
He gives us that capability.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know if there are many big guys with the kind of hands
he's got. He's an interesting player because you can have his body
tied up but if you don't have his hands tied up he can still make the
play.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the Shaq of the NHL because he can bring people to him and
then he kicks the ball out and somebody else benefits. Or you can
double-team him and he'll find a way to get the puck to the front of
the net, just like Shaq can get it to the hole. Very similar in the
way that they approach their specific sports."</TE>
<TE>   After a 28-8-5-2 surge, the Kings stumbled into the playoffs with
a 4-5-2 finish, but there seems to be no consensus as to whether
that's cause for alarm.</TE>
<TE>   "The year we won the Stanley Cup in Montreal," said defenseman
Mathieu Schneider, who helped the Canadiens defeat the Kings in the
1993 finals, "we lost eight out of our last 10 going into the
playoffs. Everyone was writing us off. But each series is new."</TE>
<TE>   Revenge is far from the mind of King defenseman Aaron Miller, who
missed out on a championship run after the Colorado Avalanche traded
him late last season.</TE>
<TE>   "The trade is old news," Miller said. "I'm an L.A. King now. I've
played that team 11 times since the trade. It's really just going to
be another series for me. For me, the trade was a long time ago and
now I'm just playing against the Colorado Avalanche. That's a big
enough challenge as it is without worrying about the trade."</TE>

<LD>OFFENSE</LD>
<LD>   With Jason Allison, Ziggy Palffy and Adam Deadmarsh leading the
way, the Kings pack more offensive firepower. But that might not be
the case if Peter Forsberg can pick up where he left off after an
11-month layoff and Milan Hejduk, suffering from an abdominal injury,
is able to return. Hejduk, sidelined for the last 20 games of the
regular season, has skated but has yet to take contact. Forsberg's
return could open things up for Joe Sakic, whose numbers dipped in
his absence.</LD>
<LD>   Edge: Kings.</LD>
<TE>   DEFENSE</TE>
<TE>   Unsung veterans Mattias Norstrom, Aaron Miller, Mathieu Schneider
and Jaroslav Modry, their top-scoring defenseman, provide a solid
defense corps for the Kings, and only the high-scoring Detroit Red
Wings got more points from their defensemen. Rob Blake, Adam Foote
and Darius Kasparaitis of the Avalanche, however, might be the top
three defensemen in the series. The Avalanche gave up a league-low
169 goals, setting a franchise record.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   GOALTENDING</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Roy might be the best goaltender in NHL history and he
just wrapped up the best regular season of his career, compiling a
league-leading and career-best 1.96 goals-against average. But Felix
Potvin also enjoyed a stellar season, his 2.31 goals-against average
ranking as a career best. Last season, he shut out the Avalanche in
Games 5 and 6, forcing a do-or-die game won by Roy.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   POWER PLAY</TE>
<TE>   With 37 points in 73 games, Allison was the league's
second-leading point-producer on the power play, spearheading a unit
that led the league with 73 power-play goals, 15 by Palffy. The Kings
converted 20.7% of their power-play opportunities to lead the league.
The Avalanche was fifth, converting 18%.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Kings.</TE>
<TE>   PENALTY KILLING</TE>
<TE>   Only a few weeks ago the Kings looked like a good bet to become
the first team since the 1984-85 New York Islanders to lead the
league in both power-play conversion and penalty-killing percentage,
but then they gave up 11 power-play goals in six games and that was
that. Still, they were third in the league, killing 86.6%. The
Avalanche was slightly better, killing 87%.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   COACHING</TE>
<TE>   Neither Andy Murray of the Kings nor Bob Hartley will win the
Adams Trophy as the NHL's coach of the year, but each should at least
be considered. Murray rallied the Kings from an 8-14-4-2 start and
also overcame a near-fatal auto accident to lead the Kings into the
playoffs for the third consecutive season. And Hartley, without
Forsberg and retired defenseman Ray Bourque, guided the Avalanche to
its eighth consecutive division title, matching a league record.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Even.</TE>
<TE>   INTANGIBLES</TE>
<TE>   Unbeaten in their last 11 home games, the Kings also are winless
in their last six road games. So you can guess why Murray was so
upset when they put forth such a lackluster effort Saturday at San
Jose, when they still had a chance to earn home-ice advantage in the
first round. The return of Forsberg will give the Avalanche an
emotional lift, but Roy will be the difference in the series.</TE>

<LD>The Lakers, who enter the postseason Sunday against Portland as the
No. 3-seeded team in the West, have won eight previous NBA
championships in Los Angeles, none while seeded lower than second.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, if the Lakers win the title this season, it will be as
the lowest seed since 1995, when the Houston Rockets were seeded
sixth and beat Shaquille O'Neal's Orlando Magic in the Finals.</LD>
<LD>   Since 1967, only four teams have won the championship after ending
the regular season out of the No. 1 or 2 spots. The Portland Trail
Blazers of 1977 and Washington Bullets of 1978 were seeded No. 3, the
Boston Celtics of 1969 were No. 4, and Robert Horry's Rockets were an
afterthought in a non-Michael Jordan year.</LD>
<TE>   It could reasonably be argued that the Lakers are not a true No.
3, of course. In the competitive Western Conference, four teams
finished with at least 57 victories. The New Jersey Nets, the best
team in the Eastern Conference, won 52 games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers will begin their 50th playoff experience, more than any
team in NBA history and all but five teams in professional
sports--the Montreal Canadiens (73), Toronto Maple Leafs (62), Boston
Bruins (60), Chicago Blackhawks (53) and Detroit Red Wings (51).</TE>
<TE>   Entering the playoffs, the Lakers have only two players--Derek
Fisher and Devean George--shooting well from the three-point arc.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher, who got hot this time last season, has made 45.8% (22 of
48) of his three-point shots in April. Last postseason, he made 51.5
of his three-point attempts, including 15 of 20 against San Antonio
in the conference finals.</TE>
<TE>   George has made 11 of 23 three-point shots since March 31.</TE>
<TE>   While good half-court offenses are at a premium in the coming
months, Coach Phil Jackson said Wednesday he is unconcerned, because
there is plenty of time for shooters to get into a groove. Or out of
one.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes this first round will take a couple of weeks," he said.
"Who knows what will happen in that time?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The third-best thing that could happen to O'Neal entering the
playoffs--after a healthy toe and wrist--is his free throws, which
are falling with uncommon deftness. He shot them pretty well since
the All-Star game, and was 22 for 29 in the last three games.</TE>
<TE>   While his mechanics don't appear drastically changed, there is arc
to his shot. He concluded the regular season having made 55.5% of his
attempts, the second-best percentage of his career. He did not have a
coach, but he did spend many hours practicing, particularly when his
arthritic toe would not allow him to run in practice.</TE>
<TE>   "He started getting that ball up instead of line-driving it, and
it really changed a lot for him," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mitch Richmond, who signed a cut-rate contract in order to
experience his first championship, might get the championship but not
the experience.</TE>
<TE>   He has played 50 minutes since March 20, 11 of those Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Lakers' Finale Is a Rob Story</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: They gain third seeding in West by
defeating Kings, 109-95, but Horry's status is uncertain for playoffs
because of stomach injury.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe the Lakers weren't vulnerable when they lost a few late-season
games they wanted to win, and when they didn't play well enough often
enough to win the Pacific Division title. The Sacramento Kings hung
that banner at Arco Arena this week.</LD>
<LD>   And while they beat a bunch of understudies in King uniforms
Wednesday night--the Kings played for self-preservation, the Lakers
to further their various home-court advantages--the Lakers came upon
yet another potential issue as three-peat season opened.</LD>
<LD>   Early in the second quarter of the Lakers' 109-95 victory at
Staples Center, a win that clinched the No.3 seeding and a
first-round series starting Sunday against the Portland Trail
Blazers, power forward Robert Horry grabbed the left side of his
stomach and walked from the floor.</LD>
<TE>   The early diagnosis was a strained stomach muscle, hours after an
ultrasound examination was normal. Horry is scheduled for an MRI exam
today, only three days before the Lakers play the first of a
best-of-five series against the Trail Blazers and their surly power
forward, Rasheed Wallace.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have summoned Alex McKechnie, the abdominal specialist
who mended Shaquille O'Neal two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't know what it is," O'Neal, who swears by McKechnie,
said of Horry. "They say hip flexor, he says stomach. They'll figure
it out. Alex will save the day. We're going to get it straight."</TE>
<TE>   A long-term injury to Horry would seriously complicate the Laker
postseason, their desire to become the fifth team to win as many as
three consecutive NBA championships.</TE>
<TE>   "We won't think about that until it's reality," Laker Coach Phil
Jackson said. "But you know it's important for us to get Rob back. We
do have some time. It's Wednesday, rest through Sunday, and the
second game is Thursday. Even one game is a critical thing, but we'll
have to play through it."</TE>
<TE>   It was the kind of question that drew long stares and sighs after
the game.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox smiled and called it, "Building the drama."</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't worry me," Kobe Bryant said. "He'll be fine. I have
complete confidence in our staff that he'll be ready on Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   Horry, normally one of the most accommodating Lakers, left without
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Among the best sixth men in the league, Horry averaged 6.9 points
and six rebounds in 26.7 minutes. He started 23 games, many when
O'Neal was injured or suspended and Samaki Walker was forced to start
at center.</TE>
<TE>   More important, the postseason is Horry's time of year. Composed
in the most difficult circumstances, Horry won two titles in Houston
and two more with the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   After another so-so regular season last year, Horry averaged 8.4
points against the Philadelphia 76ers in the NBA Finals. His career
scoring, rebounding and assist numbers all are higher in the playoffs
than in the regular season, and he has made 37.1% of his postseason
three-point shots.</TE>
<TE>   Arguably the Lakers' third-best player, behind O'Neal and Kobe
Bryant (who both played 29 minutes and scored 21 points), Horry is a
deft defender against the Western Conference's most versatile
players, the power forwards. Also, his threat as a three-point
shooter draws potential double-teaming forwards to the perimeter,
allowing O'Neal more room.</TE>
<TE>   Horry played the final two minutes of the first quarter and then
about a minute in the second. He was on the defensive end when he
cringed and put his hand to his side. Trainer Gary Vitti met him
halfway to the bench, and they walked together through the tunnel to
the Laker locker room.</TE>
<TE>   The same thing happened late in Monday's game against the Seattle
SuperSonics, and Laker officials claimed Horry had a stomachache.</TE>
<TE>   It was a predictably arduous game for the Lakers, who aren't
easily aroused when they feel superior. That's why they needed a
14-foot Bryant jump shot at the buzzer to lead at halftime, 56-54,
and why nothing felt particularly complete until the Kings packed up
and the Lakers started to think about the Trail Blazers.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers won five of their last six games. It's something short
of the eight-game winning streak they rode in last season, but they
seem reasonably confident, particularly given O'Neal's energy for the
past couple of weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "Just about that time," he said. "About that time, that's all."</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Each and every night, Los Alamitos is offering more 2-year-old races.</LD>
<LD>   The new week begins with three of the eight contests featuring
juveniles, including the opener, the third and the fifth.</LD>
<LD>   As usual, trainer Jaime Gomez will be prominent in the baby races.
He entered five in the three races, beginning with Dreams To Fill, a
first-time starter who will debut for a $12,500 claiming price in the
first at 300 yards.</LD>
<TE>   A daughter of Dash Thru Traffic, Dreams To Fill will leave from
the rail and will be ridden by Jesus Vallejo. Owned by Dutch Masters
III, she worked in 12.80 seconds from the gate a week ago.</TE>
<TE>   In the third, also at 300 yards, Gomez will be represented by the
Dutch Masters-owned entry of Flys R Streakin and Launch Code.</TE>
<TE>   Both 2-year-olds are by the sire Strawfly Special and have worked
well.</TE>
<TE>   Gomez will saddle two more in the fifth--also at 300 yards--in
Toasting My Dad, a Special Task gelding, and That Giver, a gelding by
Dash Thru Traffic.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. A Choice Effort. 2. Oreo Speedwagn HF. 3. Flys R
Streakin. 4. Zipolator. 5. That Giver. 6. Lord Triagain. 7. BW Old
Smokey. 8. Oh Just Lucky.</TE>
<TE>   Four!  In the first, let's use Dreams To Fill, Run For Shelter,
Tinys Royal Hugger and A Choice Effort, Oreo Speedwagn HF and Amazing
Proof in the second, single the entry of Launch Code and Flys R
Streakin in the third, and Zipolator, Old Richmond and Silverio Time
in the fourth. Total cost: $24.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Run Cielo Run could get the right pace setup in
tonight's sixth at 41/2 furlongs and Uncas Sister could improve
second after a layoff for trainer Dan Francisco in the eighth at 300
yards.</TE>
<TE>   Post time: 7:15 p.m.</TE>

<HD>Mexico Pushes Its Luck, Beats Bulgaria</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The luck that has ridden with Javier "Vasco" Aguirre since he took
over as Mexico's national soccer team coach last year was still with
him Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   There were only five minutes left in Mexico's game against
Bulgaria in front of 42,591 at East Rutherford, N.J., when Aguirre
sent Francisco De Anda into the match.</LD>
<LD>   The move should not have made any difference. De Anda is a
defender, but as Aguirre's luck would have it, the Pachuca player
found himself in the right place to score with 15 seconds remaining
and give Mexico a 1-0 victory.</LD>
<TE>   The result was deserved but improbable.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico dominated the game statistically, winning nine corner kicks
to only two for Bulgaria, which was content to sit back and
counterattack.</TE>
<TE>   So negative were the Bulgarians that Mexico goalkeeper Jorge
Campos, who replaced starter Oscar Perez for the second half, did not
have to make a save.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico also led in a less appealing category. In a fast-paced but
untidy and bruising game, it committed more than 30 fouls to barely a
dozen for Bulgaria.</TE>
<TE>   Part of that was caused by frustration. Aguirre started three
strikers: former Galaxy forward Luis Hernandez and the Spanish-based
duo of Cuauhtemoc Blanco and Francisco Palencia. But the goals would
not come. Shots flew high or wide or were blocked.</TE>
<TE>   After 75 minutes, Aguirre replaced Blanco and Palencia to no
avail.</TE>
<TE>   Just when it seemed the stalemate would not be broken, Mexico
earned one last corner kick.</TE>
<TE>   Ramon Morales sent the ball in from the left, it was headed on by
Braulio Luna at the near post and flew to De Anda at the far post.
His side-foot volley was completely beyond the reach of goalkeeper
Yordan Gospodinov.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico plays Croatia, Ecuador and Italy in the first round of the
World Cup, and Aguirre has been lining up Eastern European opponents
he believes will prepare Mexico for Croatia.</TE>
<TE>   The first of them, Yugoslavia, defeated Mexico, 2-1, at Denver.
The second, Albania, lost, 4-0, at San Diego. Now, Bulgaria has been
subdued--barely.</TE>

<HD>Bucks Out; Raptors, Pacers in</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sam Cassell couldn't pull off what Joe Namath and Mark Messier did.</LD>
<LD>   Cassell guaranteed Tuesday that his Milwaukee Bucks would beat the
Detroit Pistons on Wednesday and clinch an Eastern Conference playoff
spot.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the Bucks failed miserably, losing, 123-89, and were
eliminated from the NBA playoff race after the Toronto Raptors,
winning 12 of their final 14 games without the injured Vince Carter,
and the Indiana Pacers clinched the final playoff berths with
victories.</LD>
<TE>   "Why shouldn't I have had made that guarantee?" Cassell said. "If
we would have played with the intensity we should have had, we would
have won the game. We just didn't work hard enough."</TE>
<TE>   Cassell, playing on a bad toe, scored only six points, 18 fewer
than he had in Tuesday's victory over Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   The loss was the final act in Milwaukee's collapse as the Bucks
lost 16 of their final 22 games overall and 12 in a row on the road
to miss the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no one to blame but ourselves," Milwaukee Coach George
Karl said. "This is a bitter disappointment, but we created it for
ourselves with our lack of urgency and our lack of commitment. We
just kind of self-destructed."</TE>
<TE>   Cliff Robinson scored 24 points as Detroit (50-32) got its first
50-win season since 1996-97.</TE>
<TE>   Glenn Robinson led Milwaukee with 21 points, but Ray Allen had
only six.</TE>
<TE>   "We know we are better than this," Allen said. "We've got a lot of
things to work on this summer."</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 103, Cleveland 85--Morris Peterson and Jerome Williams
each scored 22 points at Toronto to help the Raptors clinch the No. 7
spot.</TE>
<TE>   The Raptors, who had lost 17 of 18 games before Carter was
sidelined for the season by a knee injury, will open the playoffs
against Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 103, Philadelphia 80--Brad Miller scored 19 points at
Indianapolis as the Pacers closed the season with their fifth
consecutive victory to clinch the eighth and final Eastern Conference
playoff berth.</TE>
<TE>   To make the playoffs, the Pacers needed a victory and a loss by
either Milwaukee or Toronto and the Bucks obliged. Indiana will open
against top-seeded New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 86, Utah 84--Tony Parker drove the length of the floor
and scored on a layup with two seconds left at Salt Lake City,
clinching the Midwest Division title for the Spurs.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs will get Seattle in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Utah got the No. 8 seeding and will open against
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 89, Dallas 76--Jake Tsakalidis had 19 points at Phoenix as
the Suns relegated the Mavericks to fourth place in the West.</TE>
<TE>   The Mavericks will open against Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte 112 Chicago 106--Jamal Mashburn and Elden Campbell had
20 points apiece at Charlotte, N.C., to help the Hornets leap past
Orlando for the No. 4 seeding in the East and home-court advantage in
their first-round series.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 109, Memphis 94--Desmond Mason scored 33 points on
13-of-16 shooting and Gary Payton had 30 as the SuperSonics clinched
the No. 7 playoff berth at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Portland 92, Houston 79--Steve Kerr had 16 points as the Trail
Blazers rested their starters for the final quarter in a forgettable

<HD>There's a Safe Route in Draft</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Hawaii's Lelie, Tennessee's Stallworth lead a
group of talented receiving prospects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Any good receiver relishes the prospect of one-on-one coverage,
operating on an island.</LD>
<LD>   As for Ashley Lelie, he's ready to get off an island.</LD>
<LD>   Lelie (pronounced la-LEE), who set every receiving record of note
in his three seasons at Hawaii, is one of the top receivers in a 2002
draft class full of them. There could be as many as six receivers
selected in the first round of the two-day draft, which begins
Saturday, matching last year's first-round total.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a few great ones," Detroit Lion General Manager Matt
Millen said. "There are enough good ones that most every team can
make themselves better."</TE>
<TE>   Lelie, a fourth-year junior who set a Warrior record last season
with 83 catches for 1,713 yards and 19 touchdowns, is simply ready to
make himself known.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't get too much exposure in Hawaii," he said. "When we did
play on TV, half the country was asleep already. I know the coaches
and scouts, they watch tapes. I wasn't that worried."</TE>
<TE>   Most draft analysts consider Tennessee's Donte Stallworth the top
receiver in the class, although there is no indisputable pecking
order. Among the other receivers who could go in the first round are
Louisiana State's Josh Reed, Florida's Jabar Gaffney and Reche
Caldwell, Florida State's Javon Walker, Pittsburgh's Antonio Bryant,
Virginia Tech's Andre Davis and Michigan's Marquise Walker.</TE>
<TE>   On the rise is Bryant, a third-year junior who was a freshman
All-American in 1999 and won the Biletnikoff Award as the nation's
best receiver as a sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   He had ankle problems last season but rallied and was named most
valuable player of the Tangerine Bowl. Also, he doesn't lack swagger.</TE>
<TE>   "There were plenty of opportunities I had at Pittsburgh where I
made games look like all-star games," he told reporters at the NFL
combine in February. He said he styles his rough-and-tumble style
after former Dallas receiver Michael Irvin by "beating up on players,
throwing the trash can at them."</TE>
<TE>   Stallworth might be best remembered at Tennessee for the way he
changed his mind after announcing in January he would forgo his
senior year. Shortly thereafter, he reconsidered, but the NCAA
wouldn't let him come back. Turns out he violated NCAA rules by
accepting $1,300 in illegal benefits from an agent: a rental car,
cell phone and a plane ticket for his brother.</TE>
<TE>   Stallworth, who said he repaid the agent, passed on a chance to
further appeal the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I was 30 hours from graduating and we were so close to the
national championship," he told a reporter at the combine. "After I
decided to come out, I started to think I really wanted to come back
and pull with my teammates to try to win the national championship.
But when the NCAA denied the first appeal, I decided it was time to
move on."</TE>
<TE>   Reed's stock jumped dramatically after last season, when he won
the Biletnikoff Award and turned heads of scouts who might otherwise
have written him off as too small (5 feet 10, 210 pounds). He has the
rare ability to maintain his speed through his cuts--most players
decelerate--and blocks as well as any receiver on the board. He has
been clocked at 4.47 seconds in the 40-yard dash, which is nearly
two-tenths of a second faster than his best time a year ago. He
credits that to working with a personal coach, Tom Shaw, who
specializes in helping NFL players and prospects improve their speed.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no one that's perfect, nobody that is 6-4, 215 pounds
that runs the 40 in a 4.3," Reed said. "They [scouts] are going to
find something that you need to improve on, and that will show them
your work ethic and what kind of character you have, if you got
better, stayed the same or got worse."</TE>
<TE>   While Reed has been getting faster, Lelie has been bulking up. He
has added 15 pounds to his 6-2, basketball-player body in the
off-season and weighs 197. He's ready to give up his laid-back
lifestyle on the islands for a taste of NFL paradise.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm ready to get out of here," he said, pausing. "Until the Pro
Bowl."</TE>

<KH>NHL ROUNDUP</KH>
<HD>Detroit Winged by the Canucks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Henrik Sedin scored an unassisted goal, off the shoulder of Detroit's
Igor Larionov, at 13:59 of overtime to give the Vancouver Canucks a
4-3 win over the Red Wings on Wednesday night in Game 1 of their
first-round series at Detroit.</LD>
<LD>   A sold-out crowd left Joe Louis Arena virtually silent as the Red
Wings stumbled on the first step toward their quest for the Stanley
Cup.</LD>
<LD>   "We're not going to panic; everybody else can panic," Detroit's
Darren McCarty said. "It's what we expect with the team we have, with
what we expect of ourselves and what people expect from us. We know
what it is."</LD>
<TE>   The "it" is a Stanley Cup, the only result that will be acceptable
for the Red Wings and their fans.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit, which had the NHL's best record, will play host to the
Western Conference's eighth-seeded Canucks again Friday, in the
best-of-seven series.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes Friday even bigger," McCarty said.</TE>
<TE>   Sedin said he didn't have a clear path toward Dominik Hasek, who
made just 22 saves, so he just lifted his shot into traffic from
above the right circle.</TE>
<TE>   "I just tried to get it on net," Sedin said.</TE>
<TE>   It led to Vancouver's first playoff win since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit Coach Scotty Bowman defended the play of Hasek, the
six-time Vezina Trophy winner and two-time league MVP.</TE>
<TE>   "One was deflected and one was in traffic," Bowman said. "There's
not much you can do on those."</TE>
<TE>   Luc Robitaille, Sergei Fedorov and Igor Larionov scored for the
Red Wings in regulation to give them 1-0, 2-1 and 3-2 leads.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Warriner, Andrew Cassels and Trevor Linden scored for
Vancouver.</TE>
<TE>   Linden's goal tied the score, 3-3, at 10:47 of the third period.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 1, Ottawa 0-- Nobody is questioning Roman Cechmanek
now.</TE>
<TE>   Cechmanek made 35 saves and Ruslan Fedotenko scored 7:47 into
overtime, lifting the Flyers in the opener of their Eastern
Conference quarterfinal series at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   "He kept us right there. He played outstanding the whole game,"
Flyer Coach Bill Barber said of Cechmanek, who struggled in the
playoffs last year.</TE>
<TE>   Cechmanek, a Vezina Trophy finalist last season, allowed 18 goals
in a six-game series against Buffalo in his first playoff series. He
was 2-3-1 in his last six regular-season starts after returning from
an ankle injury that forced him to miss 13 games.</TE>
<TE>   The Flyers, who had won only two of their last 10 regular-season
games, were outshot, 32-15, in regulation but took nine of the 12
shots in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   After getting a few solid scoring chances early in overtime, the
Flyers capitalized on a freak play. Marty Murray, while falling to
the ice, dumped the puck toward the net from the wing. It hit
defenseman Shane Hnidy's skate and ricocheted into the slot to
Fedotenko, who backhanded it past goaltender Patrick Lalime's glove.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 2, New Jersey 1--The depleted Devils are in an early
first-round playoff hole for the first time in four years.</TE>
<TE>   Rod Brind'Amour and rookie Erik Cole scored 1:22 apart and Arturs
Irbe stopped 34 shots as the Hurricanes beat the Devils in Game 1 of
the Eastern Conference quarterfinals at Raleigh, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   The Devils, two-time defending East champions, were without Joe
Nieuwendyk (flu), Petr Sykora (foot), Scott Gomez (broken hand) and
Stephane Richer (bruised foot)--and it showed.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey won last year's playoff opener, 5-1, against Carolina
en route to a 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven series it eventually won,
4-2.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 2, Phoenix 1--Sean Burke's only big mistake was enough to
doom the Coyotes.</TE>
<TE>   Teemu Selanne passed to Patrick Marleau for the go-ahead goal in
the second period after Burke fumbled the puck behind his net, giving
the Sharks a victory in Game 1 of their Western Conference
quarterfinal series.</TE>
<TE>   Vincent Damphousse also scored for the Sharks, who won the opening
game of a playoff series for the first time in seven tries.</TE>
<TE>   Goaltender Evgeni Nabokov stopped 21 shots for his second career
playoff victory as the Sharks began their fifth straight trip to the
playoffs with a tight-checking win.</TE>

<HD>Morris Good Enough to Beat Schilling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Twice in last season's playoffs, Matt Morris pitched great in a duel
with Arizona's Curt Schilling and lost.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, Morris wasn't so great and won.</LD>
<LD>   Jim Edmonds hit a grand slam off Schilling as the St. Louis
Cardinals rallied from three runs down at Phoenix to end the
Diamondbacks' six-game winning streak, 8-4.</LD>
<TE>   "That's not the best Curt Schilling," Edmonds said. "He didn't
have his best stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Edmonds, who also doubled and scored in the fourth inning, lined
his first pitch from Schilling in the fifth inning into the
left-field seats, the fourth slam of his career and sixth home run of
the season.</TE>
<TE>   "He threw a slider," Edmonds said. "I was just trying to hit the
ball in the air. I just hit it on the barrel, got lucky. I was trying
to drive in one run there, not all four."</TE>
<TE>   Morris (4-0) gave up three runs in the first three innings on an
RBI single and two-run homer by Luis Gonzalez, but grew stronger as
the game went on to join Arizona's Randy Johnson as the National
League's first four-game winners.</TE>
<TE>   Morris gave up four runs and nine hits in seven innings. He struck
out five and walked none. Jason Isringhausen pitched the last two
innings for his second save.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling (3-1) gave up six runs and nine hits, struck out seven
and walked two in six innings in his first loss since Aug. 23. He was
4-0 in the postseason last year.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 5, San Francisco 3-- Ryan Klesko homered and drove in
three runs as the Padres overcame an impressive homer by Barry Bonds
to defeat the Giants at San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   The Padres were 7-2 on their opening homestand after a 1-5 start
on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds gave the Giants a 1-0 lead in the first inning with his
eighth homer, a 442-foot shot that reached the second deck in right
field at Qualcomm Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 7, Florida 5--Scott Rolen, Pat Burrell and Mike
Lieberthal each homered as the Phillies overcame a four-run deficit
at Miami to end the Marlins' three-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Rolen hit a solo shot in the eighth inning off Braden Looper (0-3)
to break a 5-5 tie after Burrell and Lieberthal got the Phillies back
in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 7, Cincinnati 2--Lance Berkman's two-run homer, his fourth
home run in two days, led the Astros over the Reds at Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Berkman, who drove in eight runs over the two games, became the
seventh Astro player to homer four times in a two-game span.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 15, Chicago 8--Vladimir Guerrero hit a bases-loaded
triple and single during an eight-run rally in the fourth inning and
the Expos came back from a six-run deficit to defeat the Cubs at
Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   The Expos trailed, 6-0, after Tomo Ohka failed to retire any of
the six batters he faced to begin the game. Bruce Chen (1-0) gave up
Chris Stynes' RBI single after relieving Ohka as the Cubs took a 6-0
lead with nobody out.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 2, New York 1--Rafael Furcal drove in two runs with a
triple and single as the Braves lost starter Greg Maddux early but
ended a four-game losing streak with a victory at New York.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Millwood (2-1) pitched four innings of two-hit ball after
Maddux was forced out after only one inning because of a recurrence
of back pain.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 3, Milwaukee 2--David Williams gave up two hits in five
innings and drove in two runs, and the Pirates completed a three-game
sweep at Milwaukee .</TE>
<TE>   The Pirates have won seven consecutive road games for the first
time since 1987.</TE>

<LD>Shaquille O'Neal grabbed a reporter by the lapels of his suit jacket.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of twisting them, he adjusted them.</LD>
<LD>   He then grabbed the reporter's tie.</LD>
<TE>   Instead of yanking it, he straightened it.</TE>
<TE>   The message had been delivered, but in case there was any
confusion, he said it anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about that time," the Big Tailor announced. "It's about that
time."</TE>
<TE>   Time to button up. Time to clean up.</TE>
<TE>   Time to worry that somebody is going to steal the shirt off your
back.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers walked away from the regular season Wednesday night
with the same two pieces of awkward playoff luggage they've carried
the last three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Oversized hopes and a carry-on concern.</TE>
<TE>   The hopes are legitimate, even an understatement, for a team
seemingly incapable only of bettering last year's 15-1 postseason
record.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen and four, anybody?</TE>
<TE>   The concern, however, is a moving target, shifting from the
arthritic big toe on O'Neal's right foot to the belly underneath
Robert Horry's shirt.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen and fourteen, anybody?</TE>
<TE>   Horry left a second consecutive game Wednesday with a possible
strained stomach muscle that is serious enough to warrant an MRI exam
today.</TE>
<TE>   The chances of the Lakers easily winning a championship without
him are only slightly better than the Sacramento Kings' chances of
beating the Lakers with Brent Price and Mateen Cleaves in their
backcourt.</TE>
<TE>   The final score was Lakers 109, indifferent Kings 95.</TE>
<TE>   If it's anything more than a stomachache, dealing with Horry's
condition could be considerably more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   The abdominal area is like the back. There are few quick heals.
There are few easy answers.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, the Lakers need this about as much as they need
Christina Rice.</TE>
<TE>   Horry doesn't start, but he's their third-best weapon, and
sometimes their playoff soul.</TE>
<TE>   This has been his busiest and most consistent regular season under
Coach Phil Jackson. But now, for him, it really gets fun.</TE>
<TE>   Spring is when this casual shooter makes the big shot, when this
occasional defender makes the big stop.</TE>
<TE>   Spring is when this otherwise ordinary guy has won four
championship rings.</TE>
<TE>   The worry about Horry is no less than last year's worry about team
chemistry.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be more concerned tomorrow when we get a look at that
MRI," Coach Phil Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   He underwent an ultrasound Wednesday, and no problems were found.</TE>
<TE>   But the MRI--which athletes claim is an acronym for Maybe Really
Injured--is the real test.</TE>
<TE>   Not that anyone else in the league will buy it.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't fall for that," Chris Webber said with a big smile
before sitting the bench in a meaningless game for the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't talking about Horry's then-unknown injury but about the
annual Laker pre-playoff problems that always seem to disappear.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year was about Kobe and Shaq fighting, this year it's about
Shaq's big toe," Webber said. "I don't fall for that."</TE>
<TE>   We also fell for it last year, writing that the Lakers were as
fragile as a teacup, shortly before they turned into a steamroller.</TE>
<TE>   It was our proudest moment since our endorsement of Nick Van Exel.</TE>
<TE>   Like Webber, we're also wary of being suckered again.</TE>
<TE>   "The Lakers should be the favorite, and everybody else should be
thrown in the pot," Webber said. "They are not any worse than last
year."</TE>
<TE>   If Horry is sound, then Tyra Banks' boy toy is right, no matter
what you hear.</TE>
<TE>   As in the previous two seasons, there is the league spin, and
there is reality.</TE>
<TE>   The spin is that this team will miss the veteran leadership of Ron
Harper.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is that last spring, Harper played all of 42 playoff
minutes, or about one of the 16 games.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Fisher has become the new Ron Harper, only with more hair
and skills.</TE>
<TE>   The league-wide spin is also that this team will miss the
rebounding and defense of Horace Grant.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is, by the time the Lakers had won their second
consecutive championship last year, Grant was playing the sixth-most
minutes on the team.</TE>
<TE>   Horry has become the new Grant, with occasional help from Samaki
Walker.</TE>
<TE>   The one area that Grant excelled was against Webber, a fact that
did not go unnoticed by Tyra Banks' cuddly bear.</TE>
<TE>   "He pretty much played me to a standstill," said Webber. "I don't
know too much about Samaki Walker's game."</TE>
<TE>   But he does know O'Neal. And, aching dogs and all, O'Neal is not
disappearing.</TE>
<TE>   He has scored at least 32 points in four of his last six games. He
has made more than half of his free throws in all six games.</TE>
<TE>   He's ready, and so is his sidekick, with Kobe Bryant having
learned the difference between toughness and temper tantrums.</TE>
<TE>   The two best players in the league have never seemed more
together. The town has never seemed more certain.</TE>
<TE>   "Three-peat, three-peat," chanted the crowd for the first time
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't sound like a request.</TE>
<TE>   It sounded like an order.</TE>
<TE>   They should hope that Robert Horry, sitting somewhere far from the
court, heard them loud and clear.</TE>

Lakers vs. Portland Trail Blazers
FORWARD: Rasheed Wallace, the most temperamental player in an edgy
group, averaged 19.4 points and 8.2 points in his first season as a
captain. He is a difficult defensive assignment for the Lakers, who
have trouble with him inside against Samaki Walker or Robert Horry,
and outside against Shaquille O'Neal. He made a crucial three-point
basket that sent Sunday's game into the first of two overtimes. Bonzi
Wells had a breakthrough season, averaging 17.1 points and 6.0
rebounds. He scored 33 points Sunday against the Lakers
CENTER: Arvydas Sabonis occasionally was able to push O'Neal beyond
his comfortable shooting range, which at times gave the Trail Blazers
half a chance against him. But Sabonis retired, and Dale Davis has
neither the girth nor the height to stand inside with O'Neal. Shawn
Kemp has the girth but none of the mobility, so this is where the
Lakers do most of their damage. Davis averages 8.9 rebounds and 9.6
points but probably won't come close to those numbers against the
Lakers
GUARD: Damon Stoudamire had his best season since being traded from
Toronto in 1998, right up until the police investigation with a game
left in the season. He made 35.3% of his three-point shots. Scottie
Pippen gets a lot of the credit for the Trail Blazers' second-half
surge, but he has been only so-so against the Lakers and his former
coach, Phil Jackson. Ruben Patterson comes off the bench and hounds
Kobe Bryant, often pressing Bryant into poor decisions and shots
COACHING: Maurice Cheeks, who replaced Mike Dunleavy after the last
time the Lakers met the Trail Blazers in the postseason, has never
coached in the playoffs. After a tumultuous start, it appears Cheeks
has Pippen leading and the rest following, which got them this far.
Jackson has won 141 of 191 playoff games, 15 of 16 last season
ANALYSIS: There are few defensive answers to O'Neal, but the Trail
Blazers are particularly lacking. A small lineup could be bothersome
to the Lakers, but not enough to turn a best-of-five series</TE>

<HD>Purse Becomes Ishii's Accessory to Murmurs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Because Kazuhisa Ishii has made it known he can't win if he feels
anxious, I didn't say a thing when he grabbed the gold handle of his
cute little black patent-leather purse, and walked out of the Dodger
clubhouse Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Now don't misunderstand, there's nothing wrong with carrying a
purse. My wife does, and I love her dearly. I've got a friend named
Steven, and if he showed up carrying a purse, I wouldn't be
surprised.</LD>
<LD>   But I'm still trying to picture Kevin Brown walking past the
Colorado Rockies' clubhouse the night before he's scheduled to pitch
with purse in hand. Believe me--with just the right handbag, maybe a
strap over his shoulder--I think Brownie could pull it off, but
that's probably left to someone else to suggest.</LD>
<TE>   The thing is, intimidating appearances count for something in
sports, and I never saw the Mad Hungarian carrying his glove to the
park in a dainty handbag. I guess if Ishii hadn't come across as Mr.
Shaky in spring training, I wouldn't have looked at him as some kind
of flake when he walked by with his purse.</TE>
<TE>   I will say this, when he was stopped for an autograph, I thought
for a second he was going to hand the purse to me. And if someone had
seen me, I couldn't very well tell them it was my wife's.</TE>
<TE>   Now maybe it's a cultural thing, Japanese baseball players
carrying the kind of purse you might see a young girl wearing on
Easter-- complete with matching shoes. I just wish I had looked at
Ishii's shoes Tuesday night. I asked Gaku Tashiro, who writes for
Tokyo's Sankei Sports, if purses were commonly carried by athletes in
his country, and he said no, but Ishii uses it "to carry his wallet
and cigarettes."</TE>
<TE>   SO NOW I had this picture in my head of some nervous hurler who
chain-smokes and closes his eyes when he pitches, who was probably
going to get lit up in Coors Field on Wednesday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   And then he surrenders four, or maybe it was five, hits in the
first inning, and I figure he's a goner, but then it's the second,
and the third inning, and he has not only settled down, but he's
coming on like John Wayne mowing down Colorado batter after batter to
run his record to 3-0 after three games.</TE>
<TE>   We're talking true grit here in a place that's almost never
forgiving to a pitcher, and so I told him how impressed I was after
the game, and how nervous I had been the night before.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Akasaki, the Dodgers' Japanese interpreter, told Ishii of my
anxiety, and right away he got the joke. And when I added, "I like my
Dodger pitchers to be a little more intimidating," Ishii grinned.
"Then I will carry two purses," he said, and I know that would scare
me away.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii continued talking with Akasaki, the two laughing as they
exchanged words, with Akasaki saying Ishii could feel my concern
during the game, "and when he had so many two-ball counts on the
Rockies, he knew how nervous the media had to be."</TE>
<TE>   So now we know he has a disarming personality to go with a
roundhouse curve, but what's the deal with closing his eyes when he
pitches?</TE>
<TE>   "I have better control with them closed," he joked, and when
you're 3-0, you control everything, including the postgame news
conference.</TE>
<TE>   DODGER PITCHING coach Jim Colborn, who had suggested a mechanical
adjustment to Ishii during the game that contributed to his gutsy
performance, acknowledged he was looking at a different pitcher three
weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy had his eyes closed because he was afraid to see what
might happen when he threw the ball," Colborn said. "We pumped him up
with confidence after that, and told him he was going to let this
whole baseball experience in this country go by if he didn't open his
eyes."</TE>
<TE>   Colborn speaks Japanese, so when he goes to the mound he can
communicate with Ishii, which doesn't explain why the entire infield
joined the conversation.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never heard Colborn speak Japanese," Eric Karros said, "so I
just wanted to hear it. I couldn't understand any of it, so I went
back to first base."</TE>
<TE>   COLBORN SAID he speaks Japanese at about a third-grade level. "Let
me tell you what happened with this guy," Colborn said with the
understanding I'd make it sound as if he were speaking English. "Most
pitchers starting in January are getting mentally ready to pitch.
This guy didn't know where he was going to play, how much money he'd
make, whether he'd get a visa, what the food was going to be like,
and he couldn't focus.</TE>
<TE>   "After his last exhibition game, it was like, gosh, I better start
preparing myself. That's when his work ethic improved and his
concentration sharpened."</TE>
<TE>   The show he put on against the Rockies spoke to Ishii's experience
as a pitcher in Japan. There was every opportunity to get rattled,
but he kept the Dodgers tied with the Rockies until L.A. could pull
ahead. Then afterward, when asked the smart-aleck, awkward question
about his handbag, he threw one more effective curve.</TE>
<TE>   "That's my bowling bag," he said.</TE>
<TE>   SHAWN GREEN, Karros and Hiram Bocachica lead the team in home runs
with two each. It's the Dodgers' version of Murderers' Row.</TE>
<TE>   WHEN I asked Dodger Manager Jim Tracy if he knew who the starting
goalie was for the Kings, he was stumped. Colborn explained why: "The
guy wears a mask."</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Jim Stock:</TE>
<TE>   "Did you really ask Eric Karros those questions to his face? If
so, you've crossed the line of common decency."</TE>
<TE>   I'm sorry. I'll go back to talking behind his back.</TE>

<HD>France Slumbers to Tie; Argentina Wins Solidly</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Defending world champion France was held to a drab 0-0 tie by Russia
on Wednesday at Paris, but Argentina, the favorite to take the title
away from the French at next month's World Cup, showed its potential
by shutting out Germany, 1-0, at Stuttgart.</LD>
<LD>   In an ill-tempered and foul-marred game in which Argentine
midfielder Marcelo Gallardo was carried off on a stretcher after a
second-half collision with German counterpart Jens Jeremies, the
South Americans won thanks to a 48th-minute headed goal by Juan Pablo
Sorin.</LD>
<LD>   The nature and extent of Gallardo's injury was not immediately
known.</LD>
<TE>   "I think our victory was well-deserved," Coach Marcelo Bielsa
said. "But no way was it an easy win for us against a German team for
whom I had and still have great respect."</TE>
<TE>   Countered German Coach Rudi Voeller: "Perhaps we had too much
respect for this Argentine team. But ... they were the best team out
there tonight and they could have scored a second goal at the end of
the match."</TE>
<TE>   On a day when 28 of 32 World Cup teams played warmup games ahead
of the May 31-June 30 tournament, Denmark earned a 3-1 victory over
Israel in front of 9,598 in the wake of a bomb threat and clashes at
Copenhagen between police and anti-Israel protesters. More than 200
arrests were made.</TE>
<TE>   England, meanwhile, shrugged off the recent loss of playmaker
David Beckham to injury and routed Paraguay, 4-0, at Liverpool.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Owen, who took over the captaincy after Beckham was
sidelined with a broken foot, scored four minutes into the match.
Danny Murphy and Darius Vassell had goals and Celso Ayala put the
ball into his own net.</TE>
<TE>   "We played against a team of superior category," Paraguay's
Italian Coach Cesare Maldini said. "They're among the favorites for
the World Cup with good reason."</TE>
<TE>   Italy didn't fare as well, being held to a 1-1 tie by Uruguay at
Milan and possibly losing defender Gianluca Pessotto for the World
Cup after he suffered a knee injury seven minutes into the match.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a suspected cruciate [ligament] injury," said Italy Coach
Giovanni Trapattoni, who Wednesday signed a contract to remain as
coach through July 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Christian Panucci gave Italy the lead off a 73rd-minute corner
kick and Sebastian Abreu tied the score four minutes later,
deflecting in a cross by Gianni Guigou.</TE>
<TE>   Four-time world champion Brazil played Portugal at Lisbon and
managed only a 1-1 tie against the United States' first World Cup
opponent. Sergio Conceicao put Portugal ahead, but Ronaldinho scored
on a penalty kick to salvage a tie.</TE>
<TE>   "It was made evident today that Portugal is capable of beating any
[team]," Portugal Coach Antonio Oliveira said.</TE>
<TE>   Poland, another team the U.S. will face in the first round,
suffered its second consecutive loss, falling to Romania, 2-1, at
Bydgoszcz. Poland was blanked by Japan, 2-0, last month.</TE>
<TE>   In other results:</TE>
<TE>   Spain ran over Northern Ireland, 5-0, at Belfast, where Raul
scored twice; Nigeria upset Scotland, 2-1, at Aberdeen, with Julius
Aghahowa scoring both goals; Croatia shut out Bosnia, 2-0, at Zagreb;
Turkey beat Chile by the same score at Kerkrade, Netherlands, and
Slovenia defeated fellow World Cup finalist Tunisia, 1-0, at
Ljubljana.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Costa Rica and co-host Japan finished 1-1 at Yokohama;
Belgium was booed off the field at Brussels after a 1-1 tie against
Slovakia; African and Olympic champion Cameroon was held by Austria,
0-0, at Vienna; Sweden tied Norway, 0-0, at Oslo, and Ecuador and
South Africa played to a 0-0 tie at Murcia, Spain.</TE>

<LD>That night, back in his apartment, Darryl Poston felt horrible.</LD>
<LD>   USC coaches had pulled him aside and asked him to switch from
tailback to cornerback--or at least consider it--and Poston agreed.
But something felt wrong. So he returned to practice the next day and
told them, somewhat timidly, he wanted to stay put.</LD>
<LD>   "They said all right," the sophomore recalled. "But I knew in the
back of their minds they might have been upset."</LD>
<TE>   It happens all the time in college football. Players are asked to
change positions because the team has a gap to fill or maybe a coach
has an inkling that a particular athlete's skills might be better
suited to a different spot.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, as with Poston, it is a suggestion. Other times the
player has no option. Either way, it can be a prickly situation for a
teenager facing what amounts to a major career change, balancing his
desires with the fear of angering a coach.</TE>
<TE>   Just look at the Trojan team finishing spring practice this week.
With the defensive backfield thin, receiver Marcell Allmond has moved
to cornerback. Matt Grootegoed--recovering from injury--is projected
as a starter at linebacker after moving from safety last season.</TE>
<TE>   Those players were not given much choice because the team needed
them to change. Allmond, in particular, was eager to please after
sitting out last season for disciplinary reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Across the line of scrimmage, however, Matt Cassel is playing
quarterback after months of talking with coaches about becoming a
tight end. For him, the decision was wrenching.</TE>
<TE>   With Carson Palmer ensconced atop the depth chart, Cassel appeared
in several games last season as an H-back, catching a 12-yard pass
and running the ball three times for 22 yards. Coaches suggested he
spend next fall as a receiver, then return to his natural position
after Palmer graduates.</TE>
<TE>   Like Poston, he went back and forth. Then he worked up the nerve
to walk into Coach Pete Carroll's office.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a 19-year-old kid going to see the big guy," Cassel said.
"You don't know how he'll react."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll says he respected the sophomore's sincerity and, in this
instance, could afford to let him remain at his original position.
Still, the situation raises a question: Would players have voiced
their opinions in this manner 20 years ago?</TE>
<TE>   "Probably not," said offensive coordinator Norm Chow, who has been
in the college game for three decades. "But times have changed."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll agreed: "The whole world is different than 20 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   But Carroll wants to be clear about something: If the team needs a
player to switch, he will switch. Carroll also pointed to potential
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Grootegoed was selected to a couple of freshman all-star teams at
his new position. Former linebacker Kori Dickerson caught 25 passes
for 334 yards as a converted tight end last season.</TE>
<TE>   The payoff could be even greater for Antuan Simmons, who went from
cornerback to safety for a few games before changing back and making
a between-the-legs interception for a touchdown against UCLA. Last
week, in a private workout for the San Francisco 49ers, pro coaches
told him they liked his versatility.</TE>
<TE>   "There are success stories," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Cassel is thinking only about quarterback and says he is
more focused on the field, more relaxed running the offense. The
other day, he threw a 55-yard touchdown pass in a scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   Poston has shown some spark in practice, too, running harder and
more confidently than last season. His motivation comes from a
slightly different source.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day I have it in the back of my head," he said. "If I don't
perform, I'm going to get switched to cornerback."</TE>

<HD>Poor Defense Turns U.S. Into Irish Stew</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Only days before Arena selects World Cup roster,
Americans fall, 2-1, in the rain at Dublin.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five days before Coach Bruce Arena selects the 23 players he will
take to the World Cup next month, the United States national soccer
team still has an unfinished look.</LD>
<LD>   That much was evident in a 2-1 loss to Ireland Wednesday in
rain-swept Lansdowne Road Stadium at Dublin.</LD>
<LD>   Defensive lapses by the U.S. allowed the Irish to score seven
minutes into the game and seven minutes from the end. On both
occasions, it was because defenders were beaten either for speed or
position. Arena, who will select his squad Monday, said he was
"disappointed" in the outcome of the American team's final overseas
warmup before it leaves for South Korea on May 23.</LD>
<TE>   "I think our defensive shape was better [than during a 4-2 loss to
Germany last month]," Arena said. "I think our back line performed a
bit better in terms of how they moved.</TE>
<TE>   "But in terms of evaluating the game, passing, getting forward, it
was a tough game for that because of the conditions. Some of the
issues defensively were good, but it has to be better. We need to get
our players into camp and clean up some of our mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   The first of those Wednesday came when U.S. left back Jeff Agoos
closed down Ireland's Rory Delap, only to see him push the ball past
him into the right corner and into the path of overlapping Irish
defender Steve Finnan.</TE>
<TE>   Finnan, completely unmarked, had time to find midfielder Mark
Kinsella in front of the net and Kinsella, loosely guarded by Gregg
Berhalter, volleyed the ball into the upper left corner past Brad
Friedel.</TE>
<TE>   With wind-driven rain having turned the playing surface into a
quagmire more suited to rugby, it took the U.S. players a long while
to settle into the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't come alive until after the first goal," Arena
acknowledged, and even then it took some time.</TE>
<TE>   Clint Mathis gave an indication that the Americans would not sink
quietly into the mud by unleashing a 35-yard shot that was tipped
over the crossbar by Shay Given in the 10th minute.</TE>
<TE>   Ireland continued to apply most of the pressure, however, and its
passing and possession were far superior, allowing it to dictate the
rhythm. Still, the U.S. slowly managed to claw its way back.</TE>
<TE>   In the 34th minute, the Americans earned a corner kick on the left
and midfielder John O'Brien crossed the ball deep into the penalty
area for Eddie Pope, whose sharp downward header gave Given no
chance.</TE>
<TE>   Just like that, the U.S. was back on level terms. Both coaches
substituted freely in the second half, with Arena eventually using
all 18 of his players and Ireland's Mick McCarthy employing 19 of his
21.</TE>
<TE>   Two substitutes combined to give the Irish the victory to the
delight of the crowd of 39,000.</TE>
<TE>   In the 83rd minute, veteran Steve Staunton sent a free kick from
the right flank to the back post, where Gary Doherty headed the ball
just inside the left post, beyond the reach of Kasey Keller, who
replaced Friedel for the second half.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. had one final chance to tie the score, but Josh Wolff's
volley off a pass from Eddie Lewis was palmed away by Given.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought their two goals were preventable," Friedel said, "and
it's something we need to work on."</TE>

<KH></KH>
<HD>Agency Chief Gets No Break From City's Breakaway Bids</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUE FOX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Larry Calemine, truth be told, is tired of secession.</LD>
<LD>   His blue eyes are rimmed red. He goes to bed only to lie awake,
mind aswirl with thoughts of fixed assets and bond debt. His phone
seems to never stop ringing.</LD>
<LD>   As head of the government agency weighing the consequences of
carving Los Angeles into as many as four cities, Calemine is
essentially the lead architect drawing up the breakup blueprints.</LD>
<TE>   It's a responsibility the former developer says he never bargained
for, a job fraught with controversy and with no precedent in
California. The last time a new city split from an existing one was
82 years ago, when Montebello left Monterey Park--decades before the
state created the modern machinery for making a break.</TE>
<TE>   Making Calemine's task tougher as executive officer of the Local
Agency Formation Commission are the repeated charges of bias and
conflicts of interest stemming from his role as a secession leader in
the 1970s and his real estate consulting work.</TE>
<TE>   "Hell, I wouldn't have taken the job if I'd known [a secession
bid] was coming," he said, his voice coarsened by years of smoking.
"When this is over I'm going to get my life back."</TE>
<TE>   Sometime today, Friday, or maybe next week--the schedule is always
changing as new data tumble into his office--Calemine plans to
present his final report on San Fernando Valley secession. Reports on
the viability and terms of cityhood for Hollywood and the harbor area
will follow.</TE>
<TE>   Calemine must decide whether cityhood is financially feasible for
the three regions. If so, he must propose terms for police and fire
protection, water rights, and "alimony" payments. It's Calemine who
will recommend when the new cities would be born, and Calemine who
must devise a fair split for Los Angeles' billions of dollars in
contracts and debt.</TE>
<TE>   Then it's up to Calemine's bosses, the nine members of LAFCO, to
decide whether to put secession to a citywide vote in November.</TE>
<TE>   By law, LAFCO must consider Calemine's recommendations in making
its decision.</TE>
<TE>   Despite early doubts, some officials who have worked closely with
Calemine say he has proved evenhanded and willing to listen to both
sides of the secession debates.</TE>
<TE>   "Larry has navigated this minefield with more sophistication than
he's given credit for," said county Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, a
LAFCO commissioner who helped shape the terms of the proposed
breakups.</TE>
<TE>   "I had concerns going into this process about whether he could be
fair," Yaroslavsky admitted. "But I've been more than satisfied with
the way he's handled it."</TE>
<TE>   Early Support for Valley Secession</TE>
<TE>   By his own admission, the 66-year-old Calemine isn't much of a
diplomat. Built like a bulldog with a short temper to match, he was
raised "in the streets of Brooklyn," he says proudly. The son of
Italian immigrants, he started working full time as a carpenter at 17
and served in the Navy during the Korean War.</TE>
<TE>   His unlikely journey into the eye of secession's political storm
began in 1958, when he moved his young family to California in search
of warmer weather. He found drafting jobs at a series of engineering
firms, and by the mid-1960s he was working for the Warner family in
the Valley, developing Warner Center.</TE>
<TE>   Calemine later started his own commercial realty company, which
bought and sold projects throughout the Southwest.</TE>
<TE>   And in 1975, he did what a lot of prominent Valley businessmen
did: He joined CIVICC, the Committee Investigating Independent
City/County. The group was so incensed by what it saw as City Hall's
slights that it wanted the Valley to secede from Los Angeles. "Those
of us who were very active in the Valley felt we were getting short
shrift," Calemine recalled.</TE>
<TE>   The breakaway effort, though quickly snuffed out by state
legislation that gave city councils veto power over secessions, was
"a win-win situation," he said. "Mayor [Tom] Bradley spent a lot of
time in the Valley after that. It became obvious that the Valley was
not an area to be ignored."</TE>
<TE>   It's that sort of saber-rattling, however, that worries opponents
of today's secession drives, who must rely on Calemine to be a
neutral mediator.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been pushing to break up the city for 30 years," said Julie
Butcher, general manager of Service Employees International Union
Local 347, the largest city employees union, which contends that
secession could jeopardize jobs. "He's been utterly unresponsive to
the union's concerns."</TE>
<TE>   Calemine denies any bias. "I am a professional," he insists time
and again, whenever questions arise.</TE>
<TE>   And they come up often. Last year, The Times found that Calemine
had earned at least $117,000 for outside consulting work--including
for an attorney with business before LAFCO--while employed at the
government agency. His $100,000-per-year LAFCO job required him to
work 40 hours a week and limited outside employment to 24 hours a
week.</TE>
<TE>   County lawyers determined that he had not broken any
conflict-of-interest rules, and Calemine agreed not to accept new
clients without LAFCO's consent.</TE>
<TE>   Several months later, it was revealed that a Valley-based
political action committee--of which Calemine was a member--had given
$6,000 to pro-secession Valley VOTE. Calemine said he had no role in
the contribution.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole thing smacks of conflict," said Larry Levine, a
Democratic political strategist who leads the anti-secession group
One Los Angeles. "At this stage of the process, it's almost absurd,
but I think the LAFCO board should have removed him long ago from the
question of Valley secession."</TE>
<TE>   Even Calemine's hiring seven years ago was marred by controversy.
He was disqualified when he applied for the executive officer post in
1993 and again in 1995. County lawyers said that he wasn't eligible
because he had served as an alternate on the LAFCO board at the same
time that the board was searching for an executive.</TE>
<TE>   By then Calemine was running a thriving consulting business,
working on developments such as the 1,300-acre Porter Ranch project
in the hills north of Chatsworth. He was eventually hired at LAFCO in
late 1995 after another candidate turned down the job.</TE>
<TE>   Governor Threw Agency a Curve Ball</TE>
<TE>   For a couple of years, things were quiet. LAFCO usually toils in
obscurity, setting sewer district borders and overseeing other minor
municipal boundary changes.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in 1997, Gov. Pete Wilson signed the so-called Valley
secession bill, revoking city council veto power over secessions
statewide. Long-simmering resentment in the suburban reaches of Los
Angeles blazed to life in a rash of secession movements.</TE>
<TE>   Calemine hardly seemed to relish the excitement. At one public
forum three years ago, he told the audience that the upcoming
secession battles were "the legal profession's fantasy and LAFCO's
nightmare."</TE>
<TE>   Several of Calemine's early proposals, in fact, came down against
the secessionists. In 1998, he urged officials to verify every
signature collected by Valley VOTE advocating a study of cityhood's
viability. He also suggested billing secessionists for the study,
expected to cost at least $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, Calemine has recommended that Los Angeles retain
control of utilities such as the water and sewer systems, even as
secession leaders pressed for joint ownership. He also initially
advised that Los Angeles keep assets such as fire stations and parks
in the Valley, until secessionists sought another opinion from the
state legislative counsel.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is we had to fight to get our assets," said Jeff
Brain, Valley VOTE president. "We haven't gotten everything we
wanted. I mean, where is he showing favoritism?"</TE>
<TE>   Other Calemine recommendations have bolstered the secessionist
cause. He said that Los Angeles should not be allowed to charge
higher utility rates in the breakaway cities, and even advised that
Hollywood keep its famous sign.</TE>
<TE>   A businessman clearly frustrated with government's molasses pace
and insistence on public procedures, Calemine also resisted
entreaties from the city Ethics Commission to require disclosure of
lobbying and fund-raising efforts by any side in the secession
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, gimme a break," he said when asked about the ethics requests.
"If you worked for the city of Los Angeles and you wrote a check [to
a secession group], would you want the city to know?"</TE>
<TE>   In the end, it's the LAFCO board--not Calemine--that has the final
say on taking secession to the ballot. Only if the panel ignores data
from its numerous hearings and studies could its decision be appealed
in court.</TE>
<TE>   But Calemine shrugs off any mention of a lawsuit, especially one
targeting his role in the process.</TE>
<TE>   "Not a chance in hell," he said. "I'm not the decision-maker on
this subject. The commission is. We have lawyers, we have
consultants.... To think that I'm the lone man that's producing
everything is ludicrous."</TE>

<LD>Racial politics and anger over the firing of Police Chief Bernard C.
Parks spilled over into the secession debate Wednesday, as about 150
people filled an auditorium at the Brookins AME Church in South Los
Angeles for what was billed as an informational town hall meeting on
secession.</LD>
<LD>   "Mayor Hahn has asked us to follow him" in opposing secession,
said the Rev. Frederick O. Murph. "But we don't trust him."</LD>
<LD>   Speakers included representatives of the League of Women Voters
and secession groups in the San Fernando Valley, Hollywood and the
harbor area.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a revolution!" boomed Gene La Pietra of the pro-secession
group Hollywood VOTE.</TE>
<TE>   Some speakers suggested that blacks would have more power if Los
Angeles were smaller.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want representation for your community, this is the
fastest way to do it," said Andrew Mardesich of the harbor secession
movement.</TE>
<TE>   Jacquie St. James said that the city and county of Los Angeles are
too complex, and that she recently had to go to three offices to find
out who could deal with truck noise in her neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   The turnout at the meeting, she said, "is because they're angry.
I'm angry."</TE>

<HD>Logging Friends Turn Foes</HD>
<DH>Environment: Water damage angers North Coast neighbors and
may lead to new state rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EUREKA</DL>
<LD>In this land of tree-sitters and tie-dye, Kristi Wrigley isn't your
typical North Coast logging foe.</LD>
<LD>   She's a third-generation apple farmer, a lifelong Republican.
Turning trees into boards doesn't usually make her angry. But ever
since Pacific Lumber Co. boosted its clear-cut of redwoods upstream
from her family's 25-acre ranch, Wrigley said she has seen problems
pour forth.</LD>
<LD>   Sticky mud cascading down hillsides filled Elk River out back.
Flood waters hit like never before. The apple orchards choked. No
longer could Wrigley draw from a crystal-clear stream. Now her
drinking water is trucked in.</LD>
<TE>   It's left Wrigley indignant. Along with a host of others in
Humboldt County, she believes that the California Department of
Forestry has failed to control the effect that timber harvests have
had on downstream neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   But that may be changing, with repercussions that could ripple
through private forest lands throughout the state.</TE>
<TE>   The North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board is set to
begin a two-day hearing today to decide if it should throw a new
regulatory hurdle in front of Pacific Lumber, setting strict limits
for the amount of silt that flows off the vast acreage it cuts above
the Elk River, Freshwater Creek and several other troubled streams.</TE>
<TE>   If so, pressure could increase for similar restrictions in the
timber country of the Sierra Nevada and other California forests. "It
could," concluded Forestry Department spokesman Louis Blumberg, "have
large implications for timber harvesting in this state."</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Lumber, which owns 211,000 timber acres in Humboldt
County, has hopes this year of a big harvest on Elk River, where the
chain saws have been quiet for the last two summers. But the water
board could take actions that would end up severely restricting how
many trees are felled or even halt the cut altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "We're concerned," said Jim Branham, the firm's government
relations director. "This would represent another regulatory burden
when we're already the most tightly restricted private landowner in
the state."</TE>
<TE>   For generations, Pacific Lumber logged its lands at a leisurely
rate that kept neighbors happy. But in 1986, the firm was acquired by
Texas financier Charles Hurwitz and his Maxaam Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The cut shot up dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   On the Elk River's north fork, logging went from 72 acres a year
in the decade before Hurwitz bought the firm to 504 annual acres
after the purchase.</TE>
<TE>   Water regulators said the firm's operations caused more silt to
cascade into the streams, washing mostly from poorly constructed
logging roads. From 1990 to 1997, the firm was cited by the state for
230 violations.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, however, Pacific Lumber "has cleaned up their
act," said Blumberg of the California Department of Forestry. To the
dismay of environmentalists, the department has concluded that
Pacific Lumber could log 600 acres a year on the Elk River and an
additional 500 annually above Freshwater Creek without making things
worse.</TE>
<TE>   More Lumbering to Reduce Problems?</TE>
<TE>   Make Pacific Lumber officials said renewed logging will actually
reduce the problems, providing income for roadwork and other
improvements to slash sediment flowing from their property. Jeff
Barrett, Pacific Lumber's fish and wildlife director, said computer
modeling indicates that 11 yards of muck will be eliminated by road
improvements for every yard produced by hillsides freshly shorn of
trees.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll do more to fix these problems by harvesting than by not
harvesting," Barrett said.</TE>
<TE>   Such conclusions are laughable to environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   They contend that the logging needs to be slowed dramatically if
not stopped, or the meandering streams of the redwood country--and
other spots in the state's timberlands--will be lost for generations
to come.</TE>
<TE>   "These watersheds are being ripped apart," said Cynthia Elkins of
the Environmental Protection Information Center in Garberville. "You
just cannot have logging like this and clean water at the same time."</TE>
<TE>   Though the water quality debate could affect the future of salmon
and steelhead trout that once filled the North Coast streams, this
fight is less about endangered fish and more about people.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the central players aren't the colorful collection of
anti-logging activists that typically dominate the front lines
hereabout, but rather workaday homeowners who inhabit the lush turf
downstream from Pacific Lumber's timber lands.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of them are private people who don't like to complain," said
Ken Miller of the Humboldt Water Shed Council, which is pressing the
clean-water fight. "They're not hippies. They're not yuppies. They
like logging; they just don't want it to hurt them. And they're very
upset."</TE>
<TE>   Residents said the rising sediments have polluted wells and caused
septic tanks to boil over. Washing machines have been worn out by the
grit that gets in. Houses that once seemed safe have been flooded
repeatedly. Some have spent thousands of dollars having their homes
raised a few feet to escape the water.</TE>
<TE>   Flood waters at a spot called Dead Woman's Corner on Elk River
Road have kept residents isolated for days at a time. Scott Keele, a
neighbor of Wrigley, bought a 12-foot rowboat to ferry family and
friends.</TE>
<TE>   Barrett of Pacific Lumber contended that the increased silt and
flooding can be explained by the vagaries of Mother Nature. Barrett
didn't deny that logging produces silt, but insisted that the bulk of
the problem was created by heavier rains during the late 1990s and a
bumper crop of landslides that sent muck flowing into rivers.</TE>
<TE>   Other scientists, however, have argued that logging is a prime
culprit. Sediment increased more than 1,000% on two heavily logged
North Coast tributaries--Stitz and Bear creeks--between 1994 and
1997, according to a North Coast water district report. Another study
found that so much silt has filled Elk Creek that flooding has
increased eightfold in just the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   On Freshwater Creek, homeowner Alan Cook pointed to the high-water
mark for the epic flood of 1955, when 19 inches of rain fell in five
days. In a 2-inch storm in January 2000, the river again hit that
mark.</TE>
<TE>   "It's impassable," said Cook, who has been cut off from his wife
and small children for days at a time. "The waters just rip through
here."</TE>
<TE>   Wrigley knows rising waters.</TE>
<TE>   Her family has been on this land, flanked by a sweeping bend of
the Elk River, for 99 years. They've been growing
apples--Gravensteins, Kings, Waltana--for most of that time. Rarely,
she said, did the river rise and pool around the base of the trees.
Now it seems to happen every winter.</TE>
<TE>   And the trees are suffering because of it, virtually drowning. In
years past, the thousand trees produced 900 boxes of apples even in a
bad year. Last season, Wrigley got just 250 cases of fruit.</TE>
<TE>   "They're just generally sick," she said. "Trees do not like wet
feet."</TE>
<TE>   The family used to draw water from the river for their household.
No more. The mud gave it an awful taste. The washing machine left
clothes covered with muck. A few years back, the water board got
Pacific Lumber to agree to truck in water a few times a month to
Wrigley and several neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   They've also banded together to sue, claiming that the lumber
company has violated their health and safety and trampled on their
property rights as it has cut redwoods on portions of the more than
21,000 acres it owns in the river's watershed.</TE>
<TE>   Others have come before them. Last year, Pacific Lumber agreed to
pay a $3.3-million settlement to 38 residents of the North Coast
timber town of Stafford, where a torrent of mud destroyed or damaged
10 homes.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing so dramatic has happened along the Elk River, but Wrigley
sees trouble in its murky waters.</TE>
<TE>   A childhood swimming hole is now a shallow, mud-filled pool. Fish
that used to carve a course upstream through the cobbles now are
never seen. A house downriver flooded four times in the 45 years
before Pacific Lumber revved up its logging on the Elk River, Wrigley
said. In four recent years the river overflowed four times.</TE>
<TE>   When she approached officials at Pacific Lumber, which owns every
acre to the east of her, the message was the same: It's the rain.</TE>
<TE>   Wrigley harbors no ill will against loggers. They're neighbors,
friends, great people, she said, "hard-working, honest." But the
management of the timber firm has taken "those sweet boys and used
them," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "If they start up logging again," Wrigley concluded, "they'll bury
this river."</TE>

<HD>Mahony Gives Abuse Panel More Muscle</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Number of laypeople will be raised to boost
credibility. Cardinal will unveil new programs he wishes were in
place earlier.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER and LARRY B. STAMMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cardinal Roger M. Mahony will announce today that he is expanding the
scope and authority of a panel overseeing all sexual abuse
allegations in the Los Angeles Archdiocese in an effort to add more
credibility to the process.</LD>
<LD>   Mahony plans to discuss three new initiatives aimed at dealing
with abuse cases in the Roman Catholic Church in media interviews
today. In an interview Wednesday, Mahony said his initiatives are
far-reaching and will help the church deal with future problems.</LD>
<LD>   As he looks back over the clerical sex abuse allegations, Mahony
said he wished he had two of the new programs in place: an expanded
panel of mostly laypeople to examine the accusations and claims and
an education program to teach children how to guard against sexual
abuse and other types of violence.</LD>
<TE>   The cardinal said he also plans to add "spiritual" programs aimed
at helping abuse victims who want to continue their involvement in
the church separate from therapy or other forms of counseling.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, a separate task force will be created by Mahony to
attempt to determine how much the archdiocese has paid to settle
abuse claims against clergy members. Because the archdiocese had
several insurance companies over the years, Mahony said he wants to
determine the costs involved in these cases to get a better idea of
the financial aspects of the problem.</TE>
<TE>   As the sexual abuse scandal has flared across the country in
recent months, a frequent complaint from rank-and-file Catholics has
been that bishops who control the church's 195 U.S. dioceses have not
been accountable to parishioners.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony seemed intent to begin addressing that issue by not only
expanding the number of laypeople on his existing sexual abuse
council but giving it more authority.</TE>
<TE>   "What has become obvious to me is that too much of this has been
functioning within the close clerical circles. We're much better
served when we involve ... laypeople," Mahony said.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Mahony said the priests' role is somewhat
"conflictive."</TE>
<TE>   "One of our main roles is forgiveness, reconciliation,
restoration," Mahony said.</TE>
<TE>   Years ago, he added, bishops believed that "God's grace was
powerful enough to help overcome this moral evil."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said that today, however, he knows that some problems
cannot be solved spiritually and need to be dealt with through the
criminal justice system.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal said he will expand the existing nine-member sexual
abuse advisory council to 15 members, only three of whom will be
priests. The council now has seven lay members and two priests. Among
the lay members are the parents of two children who were molested by
priests, and a retired judge.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said he wants to appoint a sexual abuse victim to the
expanded panel which, he said, will have "much more authority" over
deciding how to resolve complaints of priest abuse. He said the panel
will develop and review sexual abuse policies for the archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if the council would have the final word on how a case is
decided, Mahony said that is "the thrust" of his intention.
Currently, the panel makes recommendations to Mahony.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal May Be Trying to Take Lead Nationally</TE>
<TE>   Mahony's proposals were met with praise from some who believe the
cardinal is attempting to take the lead on these issues.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said he will discuss these ideas, among others, when he and
other American cardinals meet with Vatican officials in Rome next
week.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Ryan, a spokesman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops
in Washington, said that the scope of Mahony's initiatives appears to
be unprecedented. He said he does not know of any other church
programs as comprehensive.</TE>
<TE>   "This certainly does sound very far-reaching," Ryan said. He said
that a number of other U.S. dioceses have sexual abuse review
councils whose members include a majority of laypeople. But he said
Mahony's intention to give his council greater authority in resolving
cases may be unique.</TE>
<TE>   The Most Rev. William S. Skylstad, vice president of the U.S.
Conference of Catholic Bishops, said Tuesday that Mahony's proposals
are the "most specific" he has seen.</TE>
<TE>   "We've talked about some of those issues but haven't gone ahead as
far as planning. I'm very impressed," Skylstad said.</TE>
<TE>   The education programs, which are expected to be implemented in
the 287 parishes in the three-county archdiocese, are aimed at
teaching children ways to avoid potentially dangerous situations,
including sexual abuse, kidnapping and neglect by any adult.</TE>
<TE>   "These programs are designed to help children and young people in
all kinds of situations," Mahony said. "How do you avoid being
kidnapped? How do you avoid pornography on the Internet? How do you
deal with advances by abusers?"</TE>
<TE>   He said there are several good existing programs that involve both
minors and their parents. He said an archdiocesan working group is
looking at programs now and should have recommendations to parishes
within a few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said his offer to create spiritual programs for sexual
abuse victims may not appeal to some, but he said he believes it is
important for the church to make a "spiritual outreach."</TE>
<TE>   The Roman Catholic Church faces sexual abuse allegations around
the country. The accusations, some new and some years old, first
surfaced in Boston earlier this year when it was revealed that a
priest had molested more than 130 boys and was transferred from
parish to parish.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony insists that his archdiocese is cooperating with law
enforcement authorities and that he has a "zero-tolerance" policy
toward maintaining abusers in the church. He said he has turned over
names of alleged abusive priests to the Los Angeles Police
Department, and he is continually meeting with victims.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD has a special phone line for victims to report abuse by
clergy, and detectives say they are receiving new tips nearly every
day. The phone number is (213) 485-2883.</TE>

<KH></KH>
<HD>LAFCO to Release Study on Valley Breakaway</HD>
<DH>Report: Long-awaited document due this week is expected to
determine that an independent city is feasible and lay out the terms
of the divorce.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The proposal to wrest the San Fernando Valley away from Los Angeles
is expected to move significantly forward this week with the release
of a long-awaited report on whether a new city would be fiscally
sound.</LD>
<LD>   Planners for the state commission overseeing Valley secession have
been closed-mouthed about their report, but others involved in the
process said they believe the document will conclude that a new city
would be financially viable.</LD>
<LD>   If approved by the Local Agency Formation Commission next month
and sent to voters in November, the report would become the blueprint
for a Valley city, setting its boundaries, drawing its council
districts and establishing its budget.</LD>
<TE>   As of late Wednesday, LAFCO Executive Director Larry Calemine was
still working on the report, which he said will probably be released
Friday morning. It will be presented to the LAFCO board next
Wednesday, but the board is not expected to vote on it until mid-May.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be the whole banana," Calemine said of his
report, which has been in the works for 21/2 years and has cost more
than $2 million in staff time and consulting fees.</TE>
<TE>   Similar studies are ongoing for the harbor area and Hollywood,
where secession movements are also active. The commission has
indicated that it hopes to complete work on all three proposals in
time to place them on the November ballot, although recent reports
have indicated that the harbor area may not be financially healthy on
its own.</TE>
<TE>   Final reports on the harbor area and Hollywood are expected to be
ready within two months.</TE>
<TE>   In his report, Calemine is expected to address the question of how
much a Valley city would have to pay Los Angeles after a split. Los
Angeles has said it will be left with about $300 million in so-called
stranded costs after the Valley leaves, but the LAFCO staff has
rejected that argument. Instead, the staff and a commission
subcommittee said the Valley should pay $36.6 million, down from an
original estimate of $65 million.</TE>
<TE>   Calemine said Wednesday that the figure will change in his report,
but that the final number had not yet been worked out. City officials
said privately that they feared that the payment would be cut even
further, perhaps by as much as $20 million.</TE>
<TE>   Report to Recommend Council Districts</TE>
<TE>   Calemine is also expected to submit a map for council districts.
Earlier proposals have recommended 12 to 14 districts. One tentative
map drew criticism from some groups that said it did not provide
enough Latino-majority districts; Calemine is considering a new map
that would provide more.</TE>
<TE>   Also in play is the date that the new city would be incorporated.
Calemine said Wednesday that he plans to recommend that a new
municipality come into existence on July 1, 2003, the start of the
fiscal year. Previously suggested dates were Dec. 16 of this year and
Jan. 1, 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Other issues have to do with whether a new city would take
possession of certain bank accounts and other assets owned or held in
trust by Los Angeles, including parks, libraries and police and fire
stations.</TE>
<TE>   Calemine probably will recommend that most of the parks, fire
stations and police stations in the Valley transfer to the new city,
because both sides have already agreed on that. But it is unclear
whether certain funds and other assets, such as Van Nuys Airport,
will transfer, because the commission has received conflicting legal
opinions about them.</TE>
<TE>   The report also will address a request by secession proponents
that a Valley city receive partial ownership of regional assets such
as Los Angeles International Airport and the Port of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is on pins and needles," said former state Assemblyman
Richard Katz, a member of the board of the secession group Valley
VOTE. "We're waiting for them to actually decide on terms and
conditions [including] what is the 'alimony' payment and how we deal
with regional issues."</TE>
<TE>   Calemine said he drew on several sources for his report. The
commission's consultant, Public Financial Management, drafted the
fiscal analysis of secession, which concluded that the Valley would
be viable on its own and set its annual budget at about $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Valley City Would Start With Few Employees</TE>
<TE>   That study envisioned a Valley city with just 19 employees to
start, because nearly all city services would be leased from Los
Angeles during a transition period of up to three years. Council
members would be paid $12,000 per year according to the report, but
secessionists have suggested $75,000. Los Angeles council members
earn about $130,000.</TE>
<TE>   Calemine also is expected to consider a proposed budget submitted
by Valley VOTE. The group has said that it can provide services more
cheaply than envisioned by Public Financial Management.</TE>
<TE>   Also in the mix are negotiations between the city and
secessionists, and a lengthy report by a LAFCO subcommittee led by
commissioner and county Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, which suggests
ways to divide assets between the two cities and sets other terms for
a municipal separation.</TE>
<TE>   Most likely, Calemine said, he will incorporate earlier staff and
subcommittee recommendations as well as items that the city and
secessionists have negotiated</TE>

<HD>Families Keep Cornea Rights, Court Decides</HD>
<DH>Transplants: Appeals panel reverses decision under '83 law,
which said coroner needn't ask permission of families.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court in San Francisco has ruled that the Los
Angeles County coroner should have obtained the permission of parents
in California and Pennsylvania before harvesting and selling the
corneas of their dead sons.</LD>
<LD>   "Duties to protect the dignity of the human body after its death
are deeply rooted in our nation's history," wrote U.S. 9th Circuit
Judge Raymond C. Fisher for the majority in the 2-1 decision.</LD>
<LD>   "The property rights that California affords to next of kin to the
body of their deceased relatives serve the premium value our society
has historically placed on protecting the dignity of the human body
in its final disposition," Fisher wrote.</LD>
<TE>   "California infringed the dignity of the bodies of the children
when it extracted the corneas from those bodies without the consent
of the parents," says the opinion, which Judge James R. Browning
joined. Their ruling is in line with the only other federal court
decision on the issue--issued by the U.S. 6th Court of Appeals in
Cincinnati, stemming from cornea removal disputes in Ohio and
Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Ferdinand F. Fernandez dissented. Fernandez said that under
California law the death of a loved one creates only a duty to
dispose of the body, not a constitutional right to possess it.</TE>
<TE>   The 2-1 ruling, issued Tuesday, paves the way for Robert Newman of
California and Barbara Obarski of Pennsylvania, whose sons Richard
Newman and Kenneth Obarski died here in 1997, to go to trial in Los
Angeles federal court seeking damages for deprivation of property
without due process of law.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit reversed the decision of U.S. District Judge J.
Spencer Letts, who dismissed the case after attorneys for the coroner
contended that no parental consent was required under an obscure 1983
state law passed to facilitate transplants.</TE>
<TE>   Under the statute, coroners were permitted to remove corneas in
cases targeted for autopsy if the coroner had "no knowledge of
objection to the removal."</TE>
<TE>   The law was changed in 1998 after a Times story revealed that the
Los Angeles coroner's office had sold thousands of corneas to a Los
Angeles eye bank for $215 to $335 per set of corneas. The eye bank
then resold them at a 1,400% markup. The cornea measure, sponsored by
state Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), requires coroners to get
permission from relatives before removing the eye tissue for
transplants.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Colovos, the Southgate, Mich., attorney who represents the
plaintiffs, said he was pleased with the decision and looked forward
to taking the case to trial. Colovos said that after the case was
sent back to the trial court he would seek class-action status
because there are potentially 10,000 plaintiffs with similar
situations.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles attorney Robert L. Dickson, who represents the
coroner's office, said he had not decided yet whether to seek a
rehearing from a larger panel of 9th Circuit judges or simply to
fight the case in the court in Los Angeles. If the case comes back to
the trial court, Dickson said his first move would be to file a new
motion to dismiss, based on another provision of the 1983 law that
said the coroner was immune from criminal or civil liability for any
actions related to cornea harvesting.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Dickson said he has successfully defended seven cases
in Los Angeles County Superior Court, stemming from cornea removals.
In one instance, he said, a jury found that a plaintiff was entitled
to no damages from the coroner. In the other six, Dickson said, a
judge threw the cases out before trial, citing a provision of the
1983 law that said pre-removal consent was not required.</TE>

<HD>Davis Presses Simon on Taxes</HD>
<DH>Politics: Governor says challenger may be hiding something
by refusing to reveal returns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis escalated his criticism of Republican challenger Bill
Simon Jr. on Wednesday, suggesting that Simon may be hiding something
by refusing to unveil his tax returns.</LD>
<LD>   Davis made his remarks after a speech to the California Chamber of
Commerce, where his aides passed out copies of a Times article
recounting how Simon, a multimillionaire, compared the Democratic
governor to Karl Marx for calling on Simon to release his tax
returns.</LD>
<LD>   "We won't know whether he paid his fair share until he discloses
that information," Davis said, adding with a wide grin that he was "a
little surprised" that Simon compared him to Marx.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the day after most taxpayers filed their 2001 income
tax returns, Simon told a San Francisco radio talk show host: "I
don't even know what a fair share is. I mean, that sounds like
somebody coming out of Moscow, you know? 'Their fair share.' You
know, Karl Marx talked like that."</TE>
<TE>   Simon stood by his remarks Wednesday: "It's just a comment. Gov.
Davis made a comment, and I made a response. I think people need to
pay taxes that they owe. I don't need the governor to tell me what's
a fair share."</TE>
<TE>   Simon also reaffirmed that he has no plans to release his state or
federal income tax returns, and offered an ambiguous answer when
asked whether he paid California state income taxes in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd have to go back and take a look at all that information,"
Simon told reporters. "I'm not prepared to answer that today. I'm
sure whatever we owed we paid."</TE>
<TE>   The campaign skirmish began Monday when Davis released his tax
returns and called on Simon to do the same. Davis, a career
politician, reported that he and his wife, Sharon, paid more than
$55,000 in state and federal taxes on income of $200,351.</TE>
<TE>   Although no state or federal law compels public disclosure,
candidates for statewide and national office commonly release their
income tax returns--and criticize any opponents who like Simon balk
at making their tax filings public.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a difficult situation," said George Gorton, who managed
campaigns for Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, a politician who routinely
released his income tax returns. "It's like not debating."</TE>
<TE>   The back-and-forth over disclosure overshadowed back-to-back
speeches by Davis and Simon to the California Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said his achievements in office include improvements in
public schools, spending $7 billion on transportation projects and
cutting taxes by $4.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   He also said he plans to sign a $2.1-billion bond proposal for the
November ballot that would help finance housing for low- and
moderate-income Californians, and he told the business leaders he
will sign legislation extending so-called enterprise zones for 20
years. Businesses receive tax breaks and other incentives by locating
in such zones, which generally are in economically depressed areas.</TE>
<TE>   Simon criticized Davis' handling of the energy crisis and the
state budget, charging that the governor inherited an $8-billion
surplus and is "trying to paper over a record $15-billion to
$17-billion deficit."</TE>
<TE>   Simon called for a 15% reduction in spending on programs other
than public safety and public education, and for cuts in state taxes
on income and capital gains.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone is going to complain about a large deficit," Davis
said, "I'd like to think they contributed something in the way of
paying taxes to keep the government running."</TE>
<TE>   Davis called it essential that people running for office disclose
whether they have paid their fair share of taxes, and again slapped
at Simon for failing to vote in several elections.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a couple of fundamental obligations of citizenship:
voting and paying taxes," the governor said. "Surely, if you're going
to stand for public office, you should be willing to do both."</TE>
<TE>   "Every American should pay their taxes," Simon told reporters
after his speech, "and I do pay my taxes."</TE>
<TE>   Simon said he has nothing to hide, and noted that he complied with
state law by publicly filing a statement of economic interests with
the Fair Political Practices Commission. The conflict-of-interest
report, which all candidates and office holders must file, discloses
"pretty much all my holdings and all my sources of income," Simon
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Where do you draw the line?" he said. "We drew the line with the
statement of economic interests. We felt that was adequate
disclosure."</TE>
<TE>   Simon said he applied for a 90-day extension on filing his tax
returns. But people who file extensions still must pay what they owe
to the state and federal governments.</TE>
<TE>   "We got an extension on the return because they're fairly
complex," Simon said, "and so routinely every year we get an
extension in order to receive all the information we need."</TE>

<HD>Inmate's Lawsuit Says Deputy D.A. Defamed Him in News
Article</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A convicted kidnapper and perjurer who was at the center of the 1980s
Los Angeles County jailhouse informant scandal has filed suit
accusing the district attorney's office of besmirching his
reputation.</LD>
<LD>   Leslie Vernon White, 44, who is now in state prison on a 1998 drug
conviction, said in a federal court complaint filed Wednesday that
Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Curt Livesay defamed him by calling him a
liar and making other derogatory comments in a Los Angeles Times
article last month.</LD>
<LD>   The allegation is part of a 16-page complaint accusing the
district attorney's office of conducting a "sham" investigation into
a claim that White lodged last year alleging that Redondo Beach
police illegally searched his car after a traffic stop in December
1997 and then arrested him on suspicion of drug possession.</LD>
<TE>   White, who was convicted of the charge and sentenced to nine years
in prison, acknowledged in a telephone interview that it may be
difficult for some people to regard as serious a convicted perjurer's
complaint that someone defamed him.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to admit anyone who reads that allegation, at first blush,
would laugh at it because of my history," he said. But White said
that he has spent 14 years trying to overcome his "reputation for
lying" and that Livesay destroyed the success he has had in restoring
his credibility.</TE>
<TE>   In the suit, which he filed under a second name that he uses,
Christopher Scott, White targets Livesay, Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley
and five others in the district attorney's office as defendants. He
seeks $3 million in damages from each and demands that Livesay
publicly retract his comments.</TE>
<TE>   The suit seeks the appointment of a special prosecutor to
investigate White's complaints that Redondo Beach police lied in
their reports and in court about their reason for searching his car
in 1997 and that a prosecutor knew about the deception and failed to
expose it. He also asks that the special prosecutor determine whether
the district attorney's office is covering up the alleged misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   White charges in his suit that the actions of the district
attorney's office have interfered with his ability to effectively use
the courts to challenge his drug conviction. He said prosecutors are
driven by a "burning hatred" of him for exposing the misuse of
jailhouse informants by officers and prosecutors in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Livesay, who at the time supervised the district attorney's
jailhouse informant program, declined to comment on the suit.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal involved White, at the time a convicted robber and
kidnapper, and other jail informants who concocted confessions from
other inmates and traded that information to prosecutors and police
in return for favors. White admitted to lying under oath as a
prosecution witness 12 times.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal was a major embarrassment for the district attorney's
office. About a year after a critical grand jury report in 1990,
Livesay temporarily retired from the office and went into private
practice.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Redondo Beach police stopped White for driving with a
suspended license and for an outstanding warrant, which also was for
driving with a suspended license, court papers say.</TE>
<TE>   Officers impounded his vehicle and said they searched it to look
for narcotics and to inventory its contents. They said they found a
small amount of drugs hidden under the hood behind a headlight. Later
in court, White tried to prevent the prosecution from using the drugs
as evidence.</TE>
<TE>   He alleged that the inventory search was illegal because police
conducted it solely to look for drugs. When a Superior Court judge
rejected his claims in 1998, White, facing a possible third-strike
conviction, pleaded no contest to possession and was sentenced to
nine years in prison. White challenged the search on appeal, but lost
again in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In July 2000, he submitted a complaint about the conduct of the
officers and the prosecutor to the district attorney's office and
demanded an investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Five months later, Livesay returned to the district attorney's
office as Cooley's interim chief deputy, and White was one of his
first callers, Livesay told The Times.</TE>
<TE>   "He [White] says, 'I'd like to tell you about something,' and 'I
think you can help me out some too,'" Livesay recalled in the Times
article. Livesay said White was "untrustworthy and a liar."</TE>
<TE>   White said in his suit that he communicated with Livesay by
letter, not by phone. He also complained that the veteran prosecutor
unfairly gave a false impression in the news article that White is
"back to his old tricks." White said that Livesay's derogatory
remarks about him were a "preemptive strike" to discredit his
allegation that the district attorney's investigation into his
complaint was a sham designed to cover up police and prosecutorial
misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   White said that during a 2001 taped interview with two
investigators from the district attorney's office, he provided them
with evidence to support his complaint about the arrest. He also said
one of the investigators conceded that the search was improper.</TE>
<TE>   But the district attorney's office said that the investigator made
no such concession and that White's information did not substantiate
his complaint about his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office has rejected a Times request to
listen to the tape recording, saying it is investigative material
exempted from the public records act.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to suing the district attorney's office, White has
filed a separate legal action asking the federal court for a hearing
to again challenge his drug conviction. That case is pending.</TE>

<HD>Hahn's Budget Seeks to Add Police, Firefighters</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn on Wednesday proposed giving the Fire
and Police departments modest budget increases next year that would
slightly raise the number of police officers and firefighters.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn said he wants to increase the LAPD operating budget by $34
million, enough to pay for 360 new police officers and fully
implement the senior lead program, which assigns officers to work
with specific neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   However, the hiring would not make much of a dent in the Police
Department's 1,000-officer deficit.</LD>
<TE>   Hahn said he would work to find more money to hire additional
officers if more can be recruited. The mayor also said he wants to
reassign 100 police officers in administrative positions back to
patrol duty.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Hahn proposed raising the Fire Department budget by
about $19 million. The additional money would allow the department to
replace obsolete equipment, add 10 new ambulances, hire 48 more
firefighters and 28 more paramedics.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, who has been rolling out highlights of his proposed 2002-03
budget for the last week, also wants to maintain the current levels
of street resurfacing and sidewalk repairs, and increase tree
trimming by 5%.</TE>
<TE>   The complete budget, which is expected to contain some cuts to
city programs, will be unveiled Friday.</TE>

<HD>Two Proposals for Rail Project</HD>
<DH>Transit: Plans agree on all but one disputed street
crossing for Pasadena line. PUC is expected to vote in May.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A pair of recommendations to state regulators this week would clear
the way for construction of most intersections along the Pasadena-Los
Angeles light rail line. But the design of at least one street
crossing remains in dispute--potentially adding years and millions of
dollars to the project.</LD>
<LD>   The $725-million project has distinguished itself from most mass
transit projects in Los Angeles County by proceeding on budget and on
schedule--with the first passengers expected to board in the summer
of 2003.</LD>
<LD>   But the public authority building the 13.2-mile rail line took a
significant risk--launching construction before the state Public
Utilities Commission had approved the design of about 70 junctions
where rails will cross roadways.</LD>
<TE>   Several community groups have said pedestrians and drivers will
not be safe if trains cross roads at street level. The activists
asked that the tracks either be raised onto bridges or sunk into the
ground, to move them away from cars and people.</TE>
<TE>   One PUC member recommended this week that all 14 disputed
crossings on the 13.2-mile track be built as designed--without
expensive "grade separations." An administrative law judge who has
studied the dispute for the commission agreed that 13 of the
crossings are fine as designed. But on another, at Del Mar Boulevard
in Pasadena, he recommended that the tracks cross over or under the
street.</TE>
<TE>   The five-member PUC is expected to decide next month which option
to follow, as builders work to finish the so-called Gold Line.</TE>
<TE>   Officials for the construction agency remain hopeful that the PUC
will approve the recommendation by Commissioner Henry Duque that
construction be completed as designed.</TE>
<TE>   "When the commission votes on this thing next month, hopefully we
will be able to move ahead with it," said Rick Thorpe, executive
officer of the Los Angeles to Pasadena Metro Blue Line Construction
Authority. The project was renamed the Gold Line earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Thorpe said, the authority is still operating within its
budget. But he warned that, even as builders wait for next month's
PUC decision, more than $2 million could be added to the cost of
construction. It's unclear how much costs could grow after that if
the construction authority is forced to build a major crossing at Del
Mar.</TE>
<TE>   If the PUC accepts the recommendation of administrative law Judge
Sheldon Rosenthal requiring an alternative route around Del Mar,
Thorpe said, delays could be substantial.</TE>
<TE>   "That could push the process back a couple of years," he said. "We
would have to redo the environmental impact reports, redo the design.
Right now there is no money for that, so we would have to find the
funds to do it. All of that would certainly take quite an amount of
time."</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco attorney James D. Squeri, who represents the
Pasadena group Citizens Against the Blue Line At-Grade, said he is
happy that both reports at least recognized the safety concerns at
Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   The citizens group advocates construction of grade separations at
six Pasadena crossings, including Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenthal said the Del Mar crossing could be hazardous because a
proposed development of apartments and shops next to the tracks would
obstruct motorists' and pedestrians' views of oncoming trains.</TE>
<TE>   The judge said the line won't be safe unless the tracks are
separated from Del Mar by either a bridge or a tunnel.</TE>
<TE>   The commission will accept comments on the two proposals for 30
days and is expected to vote next month on how the crossings should
be designed.</TE>

<CX>   Gold Line--A story in Thursday's California section said two public
officials had recommended that most crossings along the Pasadena-Los
Angeles light rail line be built "as designed." The officials' reports to
the state Public Utilities Commission said the structure of most
crossings on the so-called Gold Line can remain the same. But the
officials also recommended changes in operation of the line--including
slowing train speeds and limiting the sounding of train horns--to improve
safety and reduce noise at several crossings.</CX>

<HD>High School Bans Air Force Recruiters</HD>
<DH>Education: The military is investigating why officers
detained a Washington Prep pupil.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. Air Force recruiters have been banned from a Los Angeles high
school campus after they briefly detained a student they mistakenly
thought was praising Islamic terrorists. In fact, the 17-year-old had
typed his own name, plus a little joke, into a computer that was part
of a Air Force display.</LD>
<LD>   Hassan Ali Bahar III, a senior at George Washington Preparatory
High School in South-Central, entered his name last week and added
the words "can't be stopped." An Air Force officer, suspecting a
nasty reference to the Sept. 11 attacks, allegedly put a plastic
restraint on Bahar's wrists and led him outside the trailer the Air
Force had parked on campus.</LD>
<LD>   Once the officer and an accompanying recruiter realized what Bahar
had really done, they let him go, according to Lt. Col. Bill
Williams, deputy commander for 372nd Recruiting Group, based in Utah.</LD>
<TE>   Bahar, who is Christian, said he thinks he was targeted because of
his Arab name. A member of the Junior ROTC program for five years, he
contended that other students also added the phrase "can't be
stopped" after their names, but were not restrained.</TE>
<TE>   He said the officer told him the phrase sounded too similar to
"Osama bin Laden can't be stopped."</TE>
<TE>   "I told him I don't have anything to do with Osama bin Laden,"
Bahar said. "I said I think [Bin Laden] should be killed for what he
did."</TE>
<TE>   Bahar's mother, Tasha Holt, protested the incident. The school
sponsored a meeting Tuesday with her, her son and Air Force
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Prep will ban Air Force recruiters for an unspecified
time, said Principal James Noble.</TE>
<TE>   "It is unfortunate that the actions of an overzealous officer from
the U.S. Air Force turned a routine visit to our campus into an
apparent case of harassment for one of our students," Noble said.</TE>
<TE>   Other schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District will not
join the ban, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force is investigating the matter, Williams said, adding
that the service "in no way shape or form tolerates any racial
profiling or discrimination."</TE>
<TE>   He said he hopes the school will allow recruiters back soon to
offer students "the opportunity of a career."</TE>
<TE>   Holt called the actions unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying the whole Air Force is wrong," she said. "I'm
saying they should not send people like that to deal with children."</TE>

<HD>Children Sending a Gift to Israel</HD>
<DH>Celebration: Jewish students present ambulance on country's
54th birthday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the other side of the globe, Israel was consumed by war. But in
Encino, Jewish schoolchildren were dancing.</LD>
<LD>   Dressed in blue and white, children at Valley Beth Shalom Day
School frolicked and sang to mark Israel's 54th birthday Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   They also presented an ambulance they had purchased to American
Red Magen David Israel, or ARMDI, Israel's version of the Red Cross.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a way kids can see the culmination of their work do
something tangible--like save a life--whether it be Jew or Gentile,"
said Avery Greenberg, president of Temple Valley Beth Shalom.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the midday ceremony on the school's playground,
speakers repeated the wish that the ambulance be used to treat
anyone, regardless of their ethnicity or religion.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi Harold Schulweis said the ambulance would bring comfort to
"Jews and Palestinians alike."</TE>
<TE>   The rabbi praised the children's efforts in raising the needed
$67,000.</TE>
<TE>   "What you are doing is a godly thing," he told more than 300
students and family members. "It is for the sake of peace. It is for
the sake of healing. And it is for the sake of the country.</TE>
<TE>   "May we have peace in our time," Schulweis said.</TE>
<TE>   The boisterous celebration began with younger pupils whirling in
circles and dancing arm in arm to traditional Hebrew songs broadcast
over loudspeakers.</TE>
<TE>   Donna Bender and Scott Howard, the parents who approached the
school's student council in the fall with the idea of raising money
for an ambulance, presented the truck.</TE>
<TE>   The ambulance was emblazoned with a red Star of David and a Hebrew
message meaning, "Presented to the People of Israel With Love and
Blessings."</TE>
<TE>   It will be transported to Israel in the next few weeks, organizers
said.</TE>
<TE>   David Alpert, 12, the school's student body president, said he and
his fellow students were well aware of the violent events that have
unfolded in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   He said that buying the ambulance was the students' way of helping
out, if only "in a small way."</TE>

<HD>City Seeks New Court Order to Suppress 18th Street Gang</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city of Los Angeles is seeking an injunction to prohibit 18th
Street gang members in the Pico-Union area from gathering in public,
officials are expected to announce today.</LD>
<LD>   A 1997 injunction against the gang was suspended soon after the
Rampart police corruption scandal surfaced in late 1999. A Los
Angeles Superior Court judge dissolved the injunction in February.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities say the gang has openly engaged in drug dealing,
vandalism and intimidation in the area, which is patrolled by the Los
Angeles Police Department's Rampart Station.</LD>
<TE>   "The community was telling us that the gangsters were ... more
brazen," said Assistant City Atty. Marty Vranicar, who heads the gang
unit of the city attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   The new injunction being sought by city and county prosecutors is
based on declarations of police officers who replaced the anti-gang
CRASH officers involved in the scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "We obviously had to wait some period of time before the LAPD
could reconstitute the new gang detail ... and until the new officers
became familiar with the gangs they were responsible for," Vranicar
said.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint seeking the injunction names 29 gang members and
targets a three-quarter-square-mile area bounded by James M. Wood
Boulevard to the north, the Harbor Freeway to the east, the Santa
Monica Freeway to the south and Hoover Street to the west.</TE>

<HD>Long Beach Sues PAC for Alleged Breach</HD>
<DH>Politics: City attorney plans to seek fines of at least
$80,000, saying the group accepted donations that exceeded the $600
limit in the race for mayor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Long Beach city attorney's office Wednesday filed a lawsuit
alleging election illegalities by a political action committee whose
treasurer also serves that role in the campaign of mayoral candidate
Dan Baker.</LD>
<LD>   Baker has said he had no knowledge the PAC was spending money to
support his bid to become mayor of California's fifth-largest city.</LD>
<LD>   Baker could not be reached for comment Wednesday, but he has
pointed out that the PAC treasurer, Kinde Durkee, is treasurer for
numerous candidates in other Southern California elections. Sabrina
Skacan, field director of Baker's campaign, said his office had
received a copy of the suit, but he had not had time to review it.</LD>
<TE>   City Atty. Bob Shannon said he will seek fines of at least $80,000
from the California Concerned Citizens for Neighborhood Empowerment.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be more," said Shannon, "if the investigation finds
other unlawful activities" by the PAC. "We want to deter this
happening in the future."</TE>
<TE>   The suit alleges that the PAC and Durkee violated a Long Beach
ordinance that says mayoral candidates and PACs may not solicit or
accept donations exceeding $600. Durkee could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Illustrating the small world of local politics, newly reelected
City Prosecutor Tom Reeves said Wednesday that he is handing the
inquiry over to the Los Angeles County district attorney's office
because he had paid Durkee to "fill out some campaign forms."</TE>
<TE>   He also said that he had employed Baker's campaign manager, Mike
Orlito, as his chief fund-raiser.</TE>
<TE>   "The press has reported that CCNE supported candidates that used
the political consulting services of Mike Orlito," he said in a
prepared statement.</TE>
<TE>   "Therefore, in order to avoid any appearance of impropriety,
[Tuesday] I spoke with the district attorney's office and requested
that it take responsibility for the criminal investigation of this
matter."</TE>
<TE>   The mayoral race had enough novelty to earn unprecedented
attention: a termed-out incumbent, Mayor Beverly O'Neill, whose bold
but underdog write-in campaign won her the most votes in the April 9
election, and a June runoff with only one name on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   However, on Wednesday, the spotlight was on the financing of the
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Orlito and Baker are former officers of the Long Beach chapter of
the Lambda Democratic Club, which gave $1,000 to the PAC.</TE>
<TE>   Lambda is a national organization formed 25 years ago to provide
gays and lesbians a voice in the Democratic Party.</TE>
<TE>   Baker, who is gay, has not made that a focal point of his
campaign, but gay political groups note that, were he to win, Long
Beach would become the largest city in the country with an openly gay
mayor.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the $1,000 from Lambda, the PAC accepted other
large donations, the suit alleges.</TE>
<TE>   Among them was $15,000 from the Long Beach Police Officers Assn.,
which endorsed Baker.</TE>
<TE>   Other PAC contributors with Orlito ties are Lambda chapter
President Marsha Naify, who gave $5,000, and Camden Realty Inc., a
developer Orlito represented in its efforts to build a high-rise
project now under construction downtown. Camden gave $7,500.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit notes the PAC produced fliers that suggested that
mayoral candidate and City Councilman Ray Grabinski had so
exaggerated his accomplishments that he claimed to have found a cure
for cancer. Grabinski's wife died of a brain tumor in the 1980s,
leaving him a single father of four.</TE>
<TE>   The mailer's content did not violate the election law, but it did
embarrass some Baker supporters and shifted attention toward the PAC
during the final days of the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The Lambda chapter requested its donation back after the flier was
circulated.</TE>
<TE>   The PAC "purports to act independently of candidates in the Long
Beach race," Shannon said Wednesday. "However, a state registration
form listed the expenditures as having been made in support of a
mayoral candidate."</TE>
<TE>   Shannon said the public filings by the PAC, which he termed
"anonymous and amorphous," show that it accepted contributions of
$5,000, $7,500 and $15,000, clear violations of city election law.</TE>
<TE>   Several Baker supporters who contributed to the PAC said they
don't remember or won't comment on who solicited their donation or
accepted it.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, Shannon said he has never employed Durkee or
Orlito in his campaigns but did endorse Baker in a City Council race
a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   City law allows prosecution of election illegalities as either
crimes or civil violations, and Shannon said he and prosecutor Reeves
decided a civil lawsuit would provide a speedier investigation and
resolution.</TE>
<TE>   However, Shannon conceded that resolution won't come before the
June runoff.</TE>
<TE>   "No," he said, "realistically, no, it will not."</TE>
<TE>   The runoff competitors are Baker and O'Neill, but only Baker's
name will be on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill was a write-in candidate in April and will remain so in
June.</TE>

<LD>   Among the more traditional projects--robots, potted plants and
Popsicle-stick bridges--were about 25 studies on the ability of steel
girders to resist fires and how skyscrapers can survive terrorist
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Those terrorism-influenced projects were just a fraction of the
929 entrants from 150 public and private schools at the competition,
which opened Wednesday at the Los Angeles Convention Center. But they
show that science is connected to dramatic history as well as
everyday life, organizers say.</LD>
<TE>   "Science fairs get students, parents and teachers to really see
the relevance of all the facts and figures that they memorize in
science textbooks and allow them to explore problems," said Dean
Gilbert, science fair president. "Most people just think of science
as what creates the bombs or causes destruction and don't explore how
it can actually save us from harm."</TE>
<TE>   Eighth-grader Lynn Hiel tried to simulate the fire in the World
Trade Center when she used a Bunsen burner to heat steel rods until
they collapsed. Rods that the Palos Verdes Intermediate School
student coated with fiberglass stayed intact three times longer.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the people at the fair seem to get their ideas out of a
textbook," Lynn said. "I was interested in doing something a little
more unusual that might actually help people."</TE>
<TE>   The terrorist attacks also shaped a project entered by Lynn's
brother, Tom Hiel.</TE>
<TE>   The sixth-grader loaded sand onto a small metal platform supported
by steel rods of different lengths to determine how much weight they
could support. The idea was to test how long a floor in a high-rise
could remain intact if an airplane crashed into it.</TE>
<TE>   "When the connections between the World Trade Center floors melted
away, the distance between the supports increased and made the whole
thing collapse," Tom said. "If they weren't trying to make their
buildings so big, the disaster wouldn't have been as bad."</TE>
<TE>   Tom, Lynn and the other students will find out how their projects
rate at an awards ceremony at 5:30 p.m. today, following free public
viewing from 1 to 5 p.m. in the West Hall of the Convention Center in
downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The competition is stiffer since the number of schools
participating has doubled from last year and about 200 more projects
were entered due to a major outreach effort by the fair.</TE>
<TE>   Judges roamed the rows of displays Wednesday morning, choosing
finalists from each of 20 categories, including crowded sections like
botany and the slimmer pickings in mathematics. The top three
students in each category will advance to the state science fair at
the California ScienCenter in Exposition Park at the end of May.</TE>
<TE>   Although many judges said they appreciated the projects tied to
current events, they said the more quirky entries grabbed their
attention.</TE>
<TE>   "You always have the canned experiments like the bridges and the
lasers," said Trina Ray, an astronomer at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, stopping in front of a project about how the
amount of salt in meat affects the effort to slice it. "But for
something like this, you know the kid was just sitting at the dinner
table trying to cut his meat and this experiment was born." (Turns
out, salting makes no difference in cutting.)</TE>
<TE>   When he became president of the county science fair three years
ago, Gilbert noticed that fairs around the country were in decline.
Teachers were concentrating more on course content and testing than
on homegrown experiments, said Gilbert, a former science teacher in
Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Aiming to reverse that trend locally, science fair officials held
workshops for teachers and collaborated with the Metropolitan Water
District, one of its longtime sponsors, to target schools that had
never participated.</TE>
<TE>   "Teachers see the science fair as an additional item on their
plate rather than as a unique opportunity to bring relevance to their
teaching," Gilbert said. "We showed them how you can incorporate the
research into the mainstream of instruction."</TE>
<TE>   Norwalk High School freshman Jaime Lopez said a classroom lab
experiment inspired his project, exploring the effect of temperature
on enzymes, one of 13 entries the MWD funded.</TE>
<TE>   Mentors from the science departments at Cal State campuses in Los
Angeles, Northridge and Long Beach were matched with students from
seven middle and high schools.</TE>
<TE>   Jaime said he never would have considered the fair had it not been
for the mentoring.</TE>
<TE>   "I have enough schoolwork to do as it is," he said. "But this way
I got to go deeper into something I had liked in one of my classes."</TE>
<TE>   While the World Trade Center collapse raised much interest,
traditional topics such as astronomy and space travel held their own.</TE>
<TE>   Crescenta Valley High School freshman Maral DerSarkissian tested
the effect of solar activity on the Earth's magnetic field in an
experiment she said will further her goal of being the first Armenian
woman in space.</TE>
<TE>   "I have this dream I want to accomplish, and science fairs really
help people like me develop their interests and learn more about what
they want to do," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Exposing students to those challenges is why Giovanna Sergi
reinstituted a science fair last year when she started teaching at a
Montebello parochial high school.</TE>
<TE>   "Academics are very important, sports are very important, but if
it weren't for the science fair, many of my students would not have
the chance to show their true talents," said Sergi, who teaches
science at Cantwell-Sacred Heart of Mary High School.</TE>
<TE>   "It can be hard to fit it in with the other curriculum, but it's
completely unfair to the students not to give them a chance."</TE>

<HD>Council's Ontal Quits After Vote</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carson City Councilman Manuel Ontal abruptly resigned Wednesday night
after voting with a majority of the council to cancel a controversial
waste-hauling contract at a special meeting called for the purpose of
reconsidering it.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Daryl Sweeney and council member Raunda Frank, who had voted
previously with Ontal to award the commercial hauling contract to
Browning Ferris Industries, stuck with their decision and voted to
maintain it.</LD>
<LD>   But Ontal sided with council members Jim Dear and Kay Calas, who
had initially opposed the award as tainted, and voted to rescind it.</LD>
<TE>   Dear spoke passionately, saying: "The way this was done before was
wrong. We have a chance to right the wrong...."</TE>
<TE>   Ontal said nothing during the debate. But after the vote, he
stunned the packed council chamber by announcing his decision to
resign.</TE>
<TE>   Ontal said Carson residents deserve an "honest and fair"
decision-making process.</TE>
<TE>   He said he felt he had let people down and said he hoped his
resignation "can be another step in the cleansing process this city
so badly needs."</TE>
<TE>   The contract award process became enmeshed in controversy when it
was revealed that a lawyer, employed as a consultant by BFI and as an
attorney for the city, faxed BFI supposedly secret bid information
that a BFI competitor had supplied to the city.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, FBI and Internal Revenue Service agents searched the
residences of Sweeney and Frank, looking for evidence of an
unspecified crime.</TE>
<TE>   A third warrant was served Tuesday on the Gardena office of BFI.</TE>

<LD>Long Beach Airport has been awarded a $2.8-million federal grant to
beef up security as part of a post-Sept. 11 effort by the U.S.
Department of Transportation.</LD>
<LD>   The grant, part of a $175-million fund established to combat
terrorism at U.S. airports, will help pay for new law enforcement and

<HD>Readers Protest Times</HD>
<DH>News: Almost 1,000 in the Jewish community interrupt
delivery, citing Mideast coverage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly 1,000 Los Angeles Times subscribers have ordered suspension of
home delivery for a day or more to protest what they call inaccurate,
pro-Palestinian reporting of the unrest in the Middle East.</LD>
<LD>   The protest reportedly was organized in the local Jewish community
and was timed to correspond with Wednesday's 54th anniversary of
Israeli independence.</LD>
<LD>   Times officials said they could not provide precise figures on the
number of delivery suspensions, but said the orders amount to less
than one-tenth of 1% of the paper's total daily circulation of
slightly more than 1 million.</LD>
<TE>   They said the newspaper began receiving multiple calls about
Middle East coverage Monday. About 900 calls were received Wednesday,
but not all of them requested suspensions.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Joe Englanoff, a physician at UCLA Medical Center, said talk
about staging the protest against The Times' Middle East coverage
began circulating through Southern California's Jewish community
several weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Thousands have been contacted, mostly by e-mail," he said.
"There's a feeling in the community that The Times clearly has been
one-sided and biased in its reporting about the Middle East. People
in the Jewish community want to express their anger."</TE>
<TE>   Times Editor John Carroll noted that the newspaper has a large
staff of reporters and photographers chronicling the Middle East
conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to provide coverage that is both fair and complete,"
he said. "We feel that we serve our readership by covering all
aspects and points of view.</TE>
<TE>   "Some readers may take exception to specific articles, but I am
confident that, over time, careful readers of this newspaper will get
a full, balanced account of these unsettling events," Carroll said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Downey man was arrested Wednesday on suspicion of murder after his
car struck and killed a boy as the man was being chased by police in
Downey.</LD>
<LD>   Walter Larry Lego Jr., 21, was being held without bail pending his
arraignment Friday, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Brian Rosero, 10, of South Gate died at a local hospital about 8
p.m. Tuesday, Downey police said.</LD>
<TE>   Officers said they began pursuing the sedan about 7:30 p.m.
Tuesday after noticing that it was being driven erratically. The car,
later determined to have been stolen, did not have license plates,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said the car struck the boy as he was chasing a
basketball across Coldbrook Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   " I hear a big thump and I see a little boy flying up in the air,"
said Michael Lakey, who lives in the neighborhood. Lakey said the
pursuing police officer stopped immediately and tried to revive the
boy.</TE>
<TE>   "He was working desperately, trying to save the kid," Lakey said.</TE>
<TE>   Officers said Lego drove for two blocks before abandoning the car
and running away. Detectives finally found him early Wednesday at a
residence in Covina.</TE>
<TE>   The California Highway Patrol is investigating the accident to
determine if officers followed policy.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, neighbors and family members grieved for the boy. A
shrine of candles, flowers and stuffed animals was placed near the
spot where he died. A vigil Wednesday drew about 100 people.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a very happy, very jovial boy" said Fernando Rosero,
Brian's father. "He raised a fiesta. He was our little dancer."</TE>
<TE>   Brian was a fourth-grader at Gauldin Elementary School and was to
play youth football in the summer, his father said.</TE>
<TE>   Brian's aunt, Sonia Rosero, said the boy loved to run and had been
looking forward to participating in a relay race next week.</TE>
<TE>   "He loved sports," she said. "He was a very active little boy."</TE>

<HD>Police Log Shows Evidence That Suspect Tried to Forge a New
Path in Crime</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For today's episode of stupid criminal tricks, the Los Alamitos
News-Enterprise police log reports that a woman "tried to cash a
forged check," left her ID behind, "then returned for her ID the next
day."</LD>
<LD>   There's no accounting for the behavior of some folks: Scott Wilson
of Long Beach told me about a friend who boarded a crowded Blue Line
train, pulled out a book and began to read. After a while, he noticed
out of the corner of his eye that his disheveled seatmate seemed to
be staring at him. The book-reader tried to concentrate but finally
was unable to resist making eye contact. His seatmate broke into a
smile and chirped, "Need someone to do your taxes for you?"</LD>
<LD>   Traveler's advisory: A reader's mention of the town of Orgy,
France, prompted Robert Spenger of Fullerton to point out that the
town of Condom is in the southwest of that fun-loving country.</LD>
<TE>   And a sighting of a Portuguese town with an eye-catching name was
confirmed by Mary Anne Peterson and Charles Kaplan, who submitted
evidence (see photo). That sign, by the way, would not look out of
place by any Southern California freeway at rush hour.</TE>
<TE>   For those with buyer's remorse: Michele Saldonis of Redondo Beach
sent a notice for a mansion that is equipped with a room where the
new owners can brood about the $1,275,000 price (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   The real hard sell: Braden Stoemner of San Juan Capistrano spotted
an ad for a misting device that apparently hasn't been too popular
(see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Something to lose sleep over? Larry Pfaadt of Covina writes: "I
thought people died only once." What puzzled Pfaadt was a statement
in an American Pharmaceutical Assn. booklet: "People who reported
sleeping eight hours or more per night died more often than those who
slept six or fewer hours."</TE>
<TE>   Stupid driving tricks: On a visit to L.A., Dennis Mahoney spotted
a freeway motorist who was "holding an open book in her left hand and
holding a cell phone to her face with her right hand, and apparently
reading from the book into the telephone." Let's hope this isn't a
new way for absentee parents to read to their children.</TE>
<TE>   My long wait is over: I recently achieved a lifetime ambition as a
baseball fan of more than 50 years: I finally caught a foul ball in
the stands. The closest I had come previously was when a ball landed
in my seat in Dodger Stadium--while I was in a concession line buying
a beer. I must admit I didn't catch this foul ball at a major league
game but at my daughter's softball game. Still, there was applause.
And then there was silence as the spectators and players stared in my
direction, as though waiting for something.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, how was I to know I didn't get to keep the ball?</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: At a breakfast honoring Newport Beach's top high
school seniors, Brandon Powers related how his Speedo slid part way
down his legs while he was competing in a 100-yard-butterfly event.</TE>
<TE>   When he tried to pull the swimsuit up during the race, he was
disqualified for breaking his stroke. But Powers saw the positive
side of the incident. He told the Daily Pilot: "At least I wasn't
swimming the backstroke."</TE>

<HD>3 Women Arrested in Beating of Neighbor</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three women were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after they
allegedly beat and doused a female neighbor with lighter fluid
because they mistakenly believed she molested one of their daughters,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Yvonne Roach, 26, of Yucca Valley was taken Tuesday to High Desert
Medical Center, where she was treated for gashes to her head, a
broken arm and several broken teeth, investigators said.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said Mindy Pyle, 26, believed, based on statements
made by her 6-year-old daughter, that Roach had molested her child.</LD>
<TE>   Pyle; Katherin Aceves, 25; and Vickie Lynne Hammond, 44, all of
Yucca Valley, beat Roach with various household items, including a
frying pan and a fireplace poker, said San Bernardino County
Sheriff's Sgt. John Ginter.</TE>
<TE>   But the 6-year-old told investigators she had not been abused.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, we believe the parent and the suspects involved
overreacted to statements from the child," Ginter said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors filed a felony charge Wednesday against a Los Angeles
County sheriff's sergeant and a school principal who were charged
last year with abusing their teenage son.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors alleged in court documents that sheriff's Sgt. Grady
Machnick beat and pushed his 14-year-old son and that Deborah
Machnick made her stepson pose for nude photographs and smeared dog
feces on his backpack.</LD>
<LD>   The couple was to stand trial Monday on a misdemeanor charge, but
prosecutors added the felony charge of conspiracy to commit child
endangerment.</LD>
<TE>   In court documents, prosecutors also accused the couple of forcing
the boy to sleep on a mat outside their Yorba Linda house. Locked
out, the boy had to use a restroom at a neighborhood park.</TE>

<HD>7 Accept Plea Deals in Isla Vista Assault</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seven young men charged in the videotaped assault of a 19-year-old
college student in Isla Vista accepted plea deals that will
significantly reduce their punishment.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Frank Ochoa, who will sentence the men in
June, has options ranging from probation to three years in prison. If
convicted on the felony charges that were filed, they could have
faced up to six years in prison.</LD>
<LD>   A videotape of the September 2000 attack showed the defendants
inside an apartment offering the former Santa Barbara City College
freshman shots of rum and writing on his naked body. One of the men
urinated on the man as he lay on the floor in a laundry area and the
group later placed garbage on the unconscious student while he was
sprawled on a couch in the street.</LD>

<LD>A Nevada man was found guilty of five felonies for breaking into a
Russian River compound last year to stop what he thought were human
sacrifices and child abuse.</LD>

arson, burglary and brandishing a weapon at a peace officer, and of
two enhancements for being armed and wearing a bulletproof vest while
committing his crimes.</LD>
<LD>   McCaslin said he hoped to expose human sacrifice at Bohemian
Grove, a two-week encampment of the Bohemian Club that draws business

former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.</LD>

<HD>Hells Angels Leader Gets Probation in Drug Case</HD>
<DH>Court: George Christie Jr., co-founder of group's Ventura
chapter, is sentenced after judge rejects a last-minute bid for
prison time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON and DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>National Hells Angels leader George Christie Jr. was sentenced
Wednesday to three years' probation for conspiring to sell drugs
after a Ventura judge refused prosecutors' last-minute plea for
prison time.</LD>
<LD>   As he left court, the 54-year-old Christie denied he had sold
prescription drugs and told reporters he pleaded guilty only to spare
his family prosecution.</LD>
<LD>   "I did not sell drugs to anyone," said Christie, a co-founder of
the Ventura chapter of the Hells Angels and a national club spokesman
for two decades. "I made a deal because they were holding my family
hostage."</LD>
<TE>   Christie's sentence came after a tense court hearing in which
defense lawyers accused the district attorney of trying to back out
of a plea agreement negotiated in the high-profile drug case. Last
month Christie pleaded guilty to conspiring to sell drugs and no
contest to filing a false tax return--resolving one of the longest
and most expensive criminal cases in Ventura County history.</TE>
<TE>   Christie's ex-wife and their 25-year-old son, who were charged in
the same indictment, also pleaded guilty and no contest to felony
counts after cutting deals to dismiss most of their charges. The plea
bargains ended a five-year investigation into allegations that the
elder Christie ran a criminal narcotics ring that stole drugs from an
Air Force base and sold them to teens as they left campuses in
Ventura and Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   The massive Hells Angels case took eight months to present to the
grand jury and included tens of thousands of pages of evidence,
seized during raids over the last four years. The Christie family had
faced 57 criminal counts--23 against George Christie Jr., 19 against
his ex-wife and 13 against their son.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those counts were expected to be dismissed after lawyers
reached a plea agreement, which the defense believed excluded prison
time.</TE>
<TE>   But at the sentencing hearing, Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff
Bennett urged Superior Court Judge Bruce A. Clark to impose a
seven-year prison sentence for George Christie Jr.</TE>
<TE>   "The district attorney's office believes the defendant should be
sent to state prison for his conduct," Bennett said, arguing that
Christie was involved in large-scale narcotics sales.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett described Christie as a drug dealer who deserved the most
severe penalty possible.</TE>
<TE>   But San Francisco defense lawyer William A. Welch minimized
Christie's role and said prosecutors tried to renege on a plea deal
after being criticized for their handling of the case.</TE>

<HD>Hells Angels Leader Gets Probation</HD>
<DH>Court: George Christie Jr., co-founder of Ventura chapter,
sentenced in drug case after judge rejects late plea for prison time.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>National Hells Angels leader George Christie Jr. was sentenced
Wednesday to three years' probation for conspiring to sell drugs
after a Ventura judge refused prosecutors' last-minute plea for
prison time.</LD>
<LD>   As he left court, Christie, 54, denied he had sold prescription
drugs and told reporters he only pleaded guilty to spare his family
prosecution.</LD>
<LD>   "I did not sell drugs to anyone," said Christie, a co-founder of
the Ventura chapter of the Hells Angels and a national club spokesman
for two decades. "I made a deal because they were holding my family
hostage."</LD>
<TE>   Christie's sentence came after a tense court hearing in which
defense lawyers accused the district attorney of trying to back out
of a plea agreement negotiated in the high-profile drug case. Last
month Christie pleaded guilty to conspiring to sell drugs and no
contest to filing a false tax return--resolving one of the longest
and most expensive criminal cases in Ventura County history.</TE>
<TE>   Christie's ex-wife and their 25-year-old son, who were charged in
the same indictment, also pleaded guilty and no contest to felony
counts after cutting deals to dismiss most of their charges. The plea
bargains ended a five-year investigation into allegations that the
elder Christie ran a criminal narcotics ring that stole drugs from an
Air Force base and sold them to teens as they left campuses in
Ventura and Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   The case took eight months to present to the grand jury and
included tens of thousands of pages of evidence, seized during raids
over the last four years. The Christie family had faced 57 criminal
counts--23 against George Christie Jr., 19 against his ex-wife and 13
against their son.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those counts were expected to be dismissed after lawyers
reached a plea agreement, which the defense believed excluded prison
time.</TE>
<TE>   But at the sentencing hearing, Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff
Bennett urged Superior Court Judge Bruce A. Clark to impose a
seven-year prison sentence for George Christie Jr.</TE>
<TE>   "The district attorney's office believes the defendant should be
sent to state prison for his conduct," Bennett said, arguing that
Christie was involved in large-scale narcotics sales.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett described Christie as a drug dealer who deserved the most
severe penalty possible.</TE>
<TE>   But San Francisco defense lawyer William A. Welch minimized
Christie's role and said prosecutors tried to renege on a plea deal
after being criticized for their handling of the case.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe the district attorney's office has engaged in deceit
and duplicity," Welch argued in court. "It is fraud, and it is
wrong."</TE>
<TE>   After listening to the arguments, Clark ordered the elder Christie
to sit down and asked his son, George Christie III, to come forward.</TE>
<TE>   The son, also a Hells Angels who has no criminal record, had
pleaded no contest to two counts of possession of drugs for sale.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors did not argue in favor of prison, and Clark placed
George Christie III on five years probation with credit for one year
served in county jail.</TE>
<TE>   Then the judge recalled the father's case.</TE>
<TE>   As the elder Christie stood before a courtroom crowded with
lawyers, including Dist. Atty. Michael Bradbury, Clark noted that the
evidence in the case showed that the son was more culpable than the
father of selling drugs and he rejected the request for prison time
for the elder Christie.</TE>
<TE>   Clark further rejected probationary terms that would have
prohibited the two Christies from associating with Hells Angels
members, finding that there was no evidence that the group was a
street gang as alleged by the prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, defense lawyers accused prosecutors of
squandering millions in a mean-spirited pursuit of the Hells Angels
leader.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles attorney Robert Sheahen, who formerly represented
George Christie Jr., said his client offered to plead guilty to the
same charges three years ago, but prosecutors refused.</TE>
<TE>   "Their conduct has been disgraceful," Sheahen said.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Kay Duffy said prosecutors reneged in a deal for
her client, ex-wife Cheryl Christie, who was sentenced to three
years' probation after pleading guilty to one count of accessory to
grand theft after the fact.</TE>
<TE>   Duffy said prosecutors had previously indicated a willingness to
dismiss the entire case, but then sought a felony conviction.</TE>
<TE>   "They have not stood by their word in this case," Duffy said.
"Their role is to seek justice and the truth, and that was not the
case here."</TE>
<TE>   After the sentencing, Bradbury admitted his office did not get
everything it wanted but said it exposed Christie as a drug dealer
and helped shut down an epidemic of the prescription drug Vicodin
throughout Ventura County schools.</TE>
<TE>   Bradbury attributed his rare court appearance to the high-profile
nature of the case and his involvement in the lengthy investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "I came here because this is a case I initiated five years ago,"
he said. "I was there at the beginning and I wanted to be there at
the end."</TE>
<TE>   He dismissed defense claims he had reneged on a plea-bargain
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "You will find no commitment from the district attorney's office
against asking for a state prison sentence," he said.</TE>

<HD>Hells Angels Leader, Ex-Wife and Son Get Probation in
Drug-Selling Case</HD>
<DH>Court: George Christie Jr., co-founder of the group's

<LD>National Hells Angels leader George Christie Jr. was sentenced
Wednesday to three years' probation for conspiring to sell drugs
after a Ventura judge refused prosecutors' last-minute plea for

<TE>   "You will find no commitment from the district attorney's office
against asking for a state prison sentence," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is my opinion that what you are hearing are a bunch of lies
from a drug dealer's public mouthpieces."</TE>
<TE>   Responding to criticism that millions had been spent on the case
only to see the defendants go free, Bradbury said the figures had
been inflated by the defense.</TE>
<TE>   The total cost of the prosecution was $1.5 million, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution has resulted in guilty or no-contest pleas by 16
of the 28 defendants initially indicted.</TE>
<TE>   Most have been released from custody, and many of the most serious
charges have been dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Bradbury scoffed at the notion the Hells Angels were a bunch of
guys who simply share a love of motorcycles, saying they were in fact
a criminal gang. And he accused George Christie Jr. of masquerading
as a businessman while selling drugs to children.</TE>
<TE>   "All the king's horses and all the king's men won't put George
Christie together again as a businessman in this county," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As he left the courthouse, George Christie Jr. questioned the
evidence prosecutors had against him.</TE>
<TE>   He said he has been harassed by law enforcement for years because
he hosted the Hells Angels' 50th anniversary celebration in downtown
Ventura in 1998. He said he is certain he would have prevailed at
trial, but wanted the case to be over.</TE>
<TE>   Now, he said, his focus is on complying with the terms of
probation and getting on with his life. He hopes to open up a
coffeehouse in downtown Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad it's over," he said. "It's been a long haul."</TE>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>   John Burtt of Riverside sounds like a regular, level-headed guy,
even if his hobby may seem strange to many: He likes to go out into
the desert and target shoot with a .50-caliber sniper rifle capable
of taking out a concrete bunker, armored personnel carrier or
hovering helicopter.</LD>
<LD>   That's a 5-foot rifle weighing 30 pounds that sits on a tripod and
fires 5.5-inch BMG bullets. BMG means Browning Machine Gun, a round
much more powerful than an ordinary .50-caliber bullet.</LD>
<TE>   By comparison, an average deer hunting rifle--say a .308--might
measure 4 feet and weigh 9 pounds and, unlike the supergun .50,
probably would not destroy a tanker truck at 2,000 yards.</TE>
<TE>   A retired police marksman, Burtt enjoys shooting with his wife out
by Baker or up near Coalinga in the San Joaquin Valley. They set up
on 1,000-yard ranges, firing bullets that could cost $5 each if he
didn't make his own. She has broken two world records.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an extreme sport that does not appeal to everybody,"
acknowledges Burtt, 57. "It's a toy that we use and we've invested a
lot of money in it."</TE>
<TE>   The guns start at around $2,000.</TE>
<TE>   Burtt was in Sacramento on Tuesday to argue against a bill that
would regulate these small cannons. Now they can be purchased freely
at gun stores--same as handguns, shotguns and deer rifles--after a
10-day waiting period for a background check.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, by Assemblyman Paul Koretz (D-West Hollywood), is
modeled after the 1999 act that regulated assault weapons. It would
"grandfather" in all currently owned .50-caliber BMGs, but require
them to be registered, as assault weapons and handguns are now. That
way, police can trace back the guns to their owners if they are
stolen or found at a crime scene.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning Jan. 1, nobody could buy a .50-caliber BMG in California
without a permit. And a permit would be hard to come by.</TE>
<TE>   Koretz is especially worried about these monsters falling into the
hands of terrorists--and their taking aim from some distant rooftop
at a propane tank, chemical plant or low-flying passenger jet.</TE>
<TE>   "The further away we get from terrorist incidents, the more our
eyes glaze over," he told the Assembly Public Safety Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The committee delayed a vote for a week. The bill's ultimate fate
is iffy, given that Gov. Gray Davis is cool toward new gun controls.
He previously signed bills regulating assault weapons and banning
Saturday night specials, among other firearms restrictions. Give all
these a chance to work, he asserts.</TE>
<TE>   But terrorism no longer is theoretical, notes Koretz, a longtime
gun-control advocate.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who own these weapons currently tend to be a pretty
benign group," he says. "I don't think they're potential terrorists.
But I don't want to make it easy for people to purchase them in the
future."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, the lawmaker adds, there already are too many of the guns
in California.</TE>
<TE>   How many? Burtt thinks in the high hundreds.</TE>
<TE>   Burtt clearly is in the benign group and proof that not all
firearm fanciers are nuts. He's a calm, thoughtful sport shooter who
speaks out against gun control, contending it's an ineffective
harassment, a step toward confiscation and unconstitutional. Never
mind that the Supreme Court never has overturned a gun-control law.</TE>
<TE>   But some gun worshipers do talk like dangerous crackpots who,
ironically, make their own best case for strong regulation. They
speak of killing politicians.</TE>
<TE>   For example, there's this lead paragraph from an essay by
freelance writer Brian Puckett on the Keep and Bear Arms Web site:</TE>
<TE>   "Hundreds of thousands of Americans ... faced with ongoing
state-sponsored terrorism against gun ownership, believe that they
will never regain the free exercise of their right to own, carry and
use firearms unless many leading anti-gun politicians and activists
are killed.</TE>
<TE>   "In human terms, this is perfectly understandable. In fact, it is
absolutely logical."</TE>
<TE>   This man definitely should not get a .50-caliber BMG permit.</TE>
<TE>   There's incendiary junk like that all over the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't endorse it," Burtt says. "I would not consider those
people mainstream Americans."</TE>
<TE>   Motioning to the Assembly committee room, he added: "This is the
forum where these things should be handled."</TE>
<TE>   One way to handle it is for likable, knowledgeable Burtt to be at
any negotiating table.</TE>
<TE>   Another way is for him and his wife to find a smaller gun to
enjoy.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever, you'd think California would regulate .50-caliber
armor-busters at least as strictly as .22 pistol plinkers. At
minimum, register them.</TE>
<TE>   We've banned fingernail clippers from airplanes and are
barricading the state Capitol. We should also be a little concerned
about obscure superguns.</TE>

<HD>Another Costly Pact for College</HD>
<DH>Courts: Agreement settles a suit filed by Cal State
Fullerton's ex-personnel director. It is the fourth large payout,
including three sexual harassment cases.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With the settlement of a second lawsuit, a brother and sister who
were longtime employees at Cal State Fullerton will have received
nearly $1 million from the state university system.</LD>
<LD>   The university agreed in a settlement hearing Friday in Orange
County Superior Court to pay former personnel director David Losco
$457,000 to settle his lawsuit, said his attorney, Karen Taillon, who
also represented his sister, Pamela Losco.</LD>
<LD>   Losco had alleged that he was demoted because the university
believed he had helped his sister in her sexual harassment suit and
as retaliation for giving information to a state auditor about
financial misdoings by university officials.</LD>
<TE>   Cal State Fullerton spokeswoman Paula Selleck said that an
agreement in principle had been reached but that university lawyers
had advised officials not to comment until the deal was signed.</TE>
<TE>   She said the agreement was not an admission of wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   His was the fourth substantial lawsuit by a CSUF employee the
university has lost or settled in the past two years for a total of
about $1.3 million. Three previous ones were sexual harassment suits.</TE>
<TE>   Six current or former Latino employees also filed suit against the
university last month, alleging discrimination. Another lawsuit,
filed last year by a psychological counselor at CSUF, alleges
discrimination, harassment and retaliation.</TE>
<TE>   Pamela Losco's suit was one of two sexual harassment cases filed
against the campus and Charles B. Darke, then the director of the
student health center.</TE>
<TE>   Pamela Losco, Darke's administrative assistant, received $447,000.
Her assistant, Debbie Melsheimer, received $100,000 in a separate
suit. Both cases were settled in March 2000.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Pamela Losco's settlement was believed to be the
largest the 23-campus university system had paid in a sexual
harassment lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Taillon said that shortly after Pamela's settlement with the
university, her brother was demoted.</TE>
<TE>   After staying away from work on a combination of paid and unpaid
leave, he was fired. As part of the settlement, David Losco, 59, will
retire in his former position as executive director of human
resources, Taillon said.</TE>
<TE>   The third sexual harassment suit came in March 2001 when a jury
awarded assistant biology professor Sandra Banack $311,000 in damages
and attorney's fees.</TE>

as of Feb. 1, Taillon said.</TE>
<TE>   Taillon called the university's action against him "pure and
simple, vindictive retaliation.''</TE>
<TE>   "I would hope [CSUF] has learned that the behavior exhibited
toward my clients is not only inappropriate but illegal, and would
take steps to make sure it doesn't happen again as opposed to taking
steps to ensure that they do a better job of covering it up the next
time," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In his suit, David Losco said he helped whistle-blowers and passed
information to the state auditor's office.</TE>
<TE>   The auditor reported in December 1999 that university officials
misspent about $1 million, using scholarship money on entertainment
and meals and giving work to friends.</TE>
<TE>   Losco's lawsuit said that officials blamed him for the audit
results and harassed him.</TE>
<TE>   The suit also charged that university President Milton Gordon
instructed Losco to destroy his notes of conversations with auditors.
Taillon said she filed declarations by other employees that David
Losco had told them of Gordon's orders in early 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon has denied the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   The third sexual harassment suit came in March 2001 when a jury
awarded assistant biology professor Sandra Banack $311,000 in damages
and attorney's fees.</TE>

<HD>UC Davis Accepts, Then Rejects 105</HD>
<DH>College: Letters of admission were erroneously sent to
students, most overseas, who did not qualify.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UC Davis erroneously sent letters of admission and congratulations
last month to 105 high school students, then within about four weeks
revoked all the offers.</LD>
<LD>   The letters, which went mainly to students overseas, were
mistakenly sent by a clerk, university officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "We really feel bad about it, but it doesn't serve anyone to admit
students who don't meet the faculty's criteria," said Gary Tudor,
undergraduate admissions director at the campus near Sacramento.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, Tudor noted that the UC Davis Web site, which
applicants were invited to check for their admission status while
they waited for their letters to arrive, had the correct information
about each student.</TE>
<TE>   Not all students checked there, however, including Matthew Hulse,
a 17-year-old American now in his senior year at the Singapore
American School.</TE>
<TE>   For several days, Matthew said, he was happily anticipating
enrolling at Davis in the fall, a move that would have allowed him to
return to California, where he lived with his family until he was 12.</TE>
<TE>   "I was pretty happy," said Matthew, whose parents work for
technology companies in the Southeast Asian nation. But then an
e-mail arrived from Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "They said they had messed up, that I wasn't admitted and that my
real letter would arrive in the mail," he said. When it did, it
confirmed the bad news.</TE>
<TE>   When the error was discovered in late March, UC Davis officials
said, they tried to correct it as quickly as possible to allow the
rejected students to make other choices before the May 1 acceptance
deadline for most schools. Apologetic e-mails were sent April 1,
followed by letters days later.</TE>
<TE>   Several high school counselors and others involved with college
admissions nationwide said Wednesday that they knew of previous
instances in which a single student, or a handful of students, had
been admitted to various colleges by mistake. But most said they
could not recall a case in which such a large group of students was
affected.</TE>
<TE>   "They should just take these 100 kids," said Jim Conroy, chairman
of college counseling at New Trier High School in the Chicago suburb
of Winnetka. "They screwed up. They should live with it."</TE>
<TE>   Tudor said the mistake occurred when a clerk in the admissions
office inadvertently placed the rejected students' names in a pile
with those of admitted students, and then generated acceptance
letters for all of them. But unlike the others, the erroneous letters
were sent out without the usual thick packet of accompanying
material, including response forms, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Now, "we're feeling that we've done the right thing," Tudor said.
"We're trying to communicate with the students to help them get to
the campus where it's really the right fit for them."</TE>
<TE>   But at least some of those involved are still upset at the error.</TE>
<TE>   But Matthew Hulse, who now plans to attend the University of
Colorado at Boulder, is relatively unperturbed.</TE>
<TE>   Describing himself as a good but not outstanding student, Matthew
said Davis was not his first choice, even among the eight
undergraduate UC campuses.</TE>
<TE>   But it was near where he had lived as a child and where he has
many friends. When the first letter arrived, it was also his
remaining option in California; three other UC schools had already
sent rejections.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, I'm trying to shrug it off," he said. "I'll be
OK."</TE>

<HD>Egyptian Girl Denies She Was Family Servant</HD>
<DH>Crime: Police doubt her story, saying others in the home
said she cooked and cleaned. Charges against an Irvine man are under
consideration.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 12-year-old Egyptian girl who police allege was kept as an
involuntary servant by a wealthy Irvine family told detectives that
she loved living in America and was not being forced to work as a
maid, according to a police affidavit made public Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   But police didn't believe the girl was telling the truth and were
later told by others who lived in the house that she helped cook and
clean instead of attending school, according to court documents.</LD>
<LD>   The affidavit outlines for the first time how police came to
suspect the girl was being mistreated and what led them to arrest the
head of the family, Abdelnaser Ibrahim, 41. Police say the girl lived
in unsanitary conditions in the home's garage.</LD>
<TE>   The Orange County district attorney's office is weighing criminal
charges against Ibrahim, who owns a steel export business.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors are reviewing the case for possible civil
rights violations.</TE>
<TE>   Ibrahim's attorney insisted Wednesday that the girl was well
treated and slept in a comfortable bedroom in a renovated section of
the garage. And he criticized police, saying they overreacted.</TE>
<TE>   "They arrested [Ibrahim] on a slavery charge--it's just
ludicrous," attorney Allan Stokke said. "She's the first slave in the
United States to be served Perrier water. They found empty Perrier
water bottles" in her living space.</TE>
<TE>   According to the search warrant, a senior Orange County social
worker, Carol Chen, contacted Irvine police April 9 after an
anonymous caller made a child abuse complaint. The caller said a girl
was living in Ibrahim's garage and acting as a maid for the family.</TE>
<TE>   About 10:10 a.m., Chen, Irvine Police Investigator Tracy Jacobson
and another detective knocked on Ibrahim's door. Ibrahim invited them
inside.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobson quizzed him about his five children and the girl living
with them. Ibrahim, the warrant said, told her at first that he was
not related to the girl, but then said she was a distant relative.</TE>
<TE>   He said the girl was not going to school but said he would try to
enroll her, the affidavit said. He brought the girl to speak to
detectives, but when she arrived, detectives grew concerned as
Ibrahim repeatedly addressed her in Arabic, according to documents.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him several times to stop speaking to her, as I could not
understand what was being said," Jacobson wrote in the affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   Having problems understanding the girl, the detectives called an
AT&amp;T operator who translated. The girl insisted she was being treated
well and was living in one of the bedrooms in the main house. But
police said they suspected she was not telling the truth.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no idea what [Ibrahim] told her in Arabic, so we believe
this may have influenced her answers," Irvine Police Lt. Sam Allevato
said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Ibrahim, his wife and their 17-year-old daughter refused to say
anything more, so detectives drove to school to talk to three of the
family's other four children. They said the girl was an "assistant"
to their mother, helping her cook and clean, the affidavit said.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives took the girl into protective custody and hauled away
evidence they say shows how poor her living conditions were,
including a dead black widow spider allegedly found in her bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   But Ibrahim's attorney said the warrant omits evidence showing how
well the girl was treated. The family, Stokke said, bought her passes
to Disneyland and other local theme parks.</TE>
<TE>   The girl's living space was carpeted and nicely painted, Stokke
said. "It's highly misleading to say she's sleeping in the garage,"
he said. "It's a very nice room."</TE>
<TE>   The family was planning to hire a private tutor for the girl, he
said, and regularly sent money to the girl's impoverished parents in
Egypt. Three of her sisters had lived with them in similar conditions
in Egypt with the approval of their parents, Stokke said.</TE>
<TE>   The girl remains in Orangewood Children's Home. The county's
Social Services Agency is trying to find her parents in Egypt before
a family judge decides next month whether she should stay in the
United States.</TE>

<HD>Officials Lobby Washington to Revive O.C. Airport Plan</HD>
<DH>Aviation: A delegation representing cities around LAX seeks
FAA intervention at El Toro base as Navy considers its sale and
Irvine pushes annexation proposal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an eleventh-hour effort to revive an airport at the El Toro Marine
base, elected officials in Los Angeles County have asked federal
transportation officials to intervene with the Navy in hopes of
postponing next week's expected decision to sell the closed site.</LD>
<LD>   The appeal from a dozen elected officials representing areas
around Los Angeles International Airport was delivered by letter
Tuesday to Federal Aviation Administrator Jane Garvey and Secretary
of Transportation Norman Y. Mineta.</LD>
<LD>   "Department of Transportation and FAA must carefully consider the
consequences of eliminating a viable airport resource in the midst of
a nationwide airport capacity crisis," said the letter, signed by Los
Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles),
Assemblyman George Nakano (D-Torrance), Los Angeles County Supervisor
Don Knabe, Los Angeles Councilwoman Ruth Galanter and El Segundo
Mayor Mike Gordon, among others.</LD>
<TE>   Gordon led a delegation of local officials to Washington on
Tuesday to meet with Garvey about El Toro. The FAA has said
repeatedly that federal law allows Orange County to determine what
happens to the base; voters on March 5 replaced airport zoning at the
4,700-acre property with zoning for a large park, nature preserve and
limited development.</TE>
<TE>   "People in the federal government should not concur that the
airport is dead," Gordon said Wednesday. He cited two pending
lawsuits over the March 5 vote and airport initiative that backers
hope to qualify for the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   There are "a lot of mechanisms" for an airport to be built at El
Toro, including the property staying in federal hands and being
developed by the FAA, he said. There are two such airports
nationally--both in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   "There is still a great deal of life left in this debate," Gordon
said.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong, said Irvine Councilman Mike Ward. Orange County supervisors
agreed Tuesday to allow Irvine to annex the property, and Irvine
officials will meet with Navy officials today in Washington. They
will ask the Navy to give the bulk of the base to the city in
exchange for payments from the development of 1,500 houses on the
southern tip of the property.</TE>
<TE>   "The airport is dead," Ward said. "The people in Los Angeles need
to be looking at [airports in] Palmdale and other places. This is a
political move to appease some of their voters" who don't want LAX
expanded.</TE>
<TE>   A Hahn spokesman said the mayor didn't attend the Washington
meeting but has told Mineta and Garvey privately that building an
airport at El Toro is crucial for Southern California's air passenger
and cargo transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who made the trip to Washington were Galanter; Sandy
Jacobs, vice mayor of El Segundo; Monterey Park Mayor Francisco
Alonzo; Ontario Mayor Gary Ovitz; Los Alamitos Mayor Ronald Bates;
Garden Grove Councilman Mark Rosen; Art Bloomer, executive director
of the Orange County Regional Airport Authority; Stacy Murphy, vice
mayor of Burbank; and Larry Kirkley, mayor pro tem of Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting was arranged by Rep. Jane Harman (D-Venice) and Rep.
Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach). Staffers from the offices of
Reps. Joe Baca (D-Rialto) and Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) also attended.</TE>
<TE>   To counter the lobbying onslaught, anti-airport forces this week
distributed a poll to the FAA, Navy, and federal and local officials
showing that 61% of Orange County voters oppose building an airport
at El Toro. The poll of 750 registered voters countywide was used to
counter arguments by pro-airport forces that public support remains
for an airport at El Toro because 20 out of 34 cities voted against
last month's park measure.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Pushes El Toro Airport</HD>
<DH>Land use: A delegation representing cities around LAX
seeks FAA intervention as Navy considers sale of base.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an eleventh-hour effort to revive an airport at the El Toro Marine
base, elected officials in Los Angeles County have asked federal
transportation officials to intervene with the Navy in hopes of
postponing next week's expected decision to sell the closed site.</LD>
<LD>   The appeal from a dozen elected officials representing areas
around Los Angeles International Airport was delivered by letter
Tuesday to Federal Aviation Administrator Jane Garvey and Secretary
of Transportation Norman Y. Mineta.</LD>
<LD>   "Department of Transportation and FAA must carefully consider the
consequences of eliminating a viable airport resource in the midst of
a nationwide airport capacity crisis," said the letter, signed by Los
Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles),
Assemblyman George Nakano (D-Torrance), Los Angeles County Supervisor
Don Knabe, Los Angeles Councilwoman Ruth Galanter and El Segundo
Mayor Mike Gordon, among others.</LD>
<TE>   Gordon led a delegation of local officials to Washington on
Tuesday to meet with Garvey about El Toro. The FAA has said
repeatedly that federal law allows Orange County to determine what
happens to the base; voters on March 5 replaced airport zoning at the
4,700-acre property with zoning for a large park, nature preserve and
limited development.</TE>
<TE>   "People in the federal government should not concur that the
airport is dead," Gordon said Wednesday. He cited two pending
lawsuits over the March 5 vote and airport initiative that backers
hope to qualify for the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   There are "a lot of mechanisms" for an airport to be built at El
Toro, including the property staying in federal hands and being
developed by the FAA, he said. There are two such airports
nationally--both in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   "There is still a great deal of life left in this debate," Gordon
said.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong, said Irvine Councilman Mike Ward. Orange County supervisors
agreed Tuesday to allow Irvine to annex the property, and Irvine
officials will meet with Navy officials today in Washington. They
will ask the Navy to give the bulk of the base to the city in
exchange for payments from the development of 1,500 houses on the
southern tip of the property.</TE>
<TE>   "The airport is dead," Ward said. "The people in Los Angeles need
to be looking at [airports in] Palmdale and other places. This is a
political move to appease some of their voters" who don't want LAX
expanded.</TE>
<TE>   A Hahn spokesman said the mayor didn't attend the Washington
meeting but has told Mineta and Garvey privately that building an
airport at El Toro is crucial for Southern California's air passenger
and cargo transportation. Hahn supports a limited expansion of LAX to
78 million passengers a year, with growth spread to other airports in
the region.</TE>
<TE>   "The burden of having air transportation and cargo exploding at
LAX is no longer an option," Hahn spokesman Matt Milbrook said. But
"we don't control this decision. There's only so much we can do."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Mayor Troy Edwards echoed the interest in El Toro by
officials in Los Angeles, which operates the largest commercial
airport in California. He said that Hahn feels strongly that there
needs to be a regional plan to cope with the area's air traffic, and
that an airport at El Toro should be part of that equation.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor has emphasized that Orange County should pick up their
fair share of their traffic," Edwards said. "It's unfair that LAX
should be asked to shoulder the burden of the region's aviation
traffic demands."</TE>
<TE>   Garvey's office couldn't be reached for comment Wednesday on
whether the FAA will intervene with the Navy.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who made the trip to Washington were Galanter; Sandy
Jacobs, vice mayor of El Segundo; Monterey Park Mayor Francisco
Alonzo; Ontario Mayor Gary Ovitz; Los Alamitos Mayor Ronald Bates;
Garden Grove Councilman Mark Rosen; Art Bloomer, executive director
of the Orange County Regional Airport Authority; Stacy Murphy, vice
mayor of Burbank; and Larry Kirkley, mayor pro tem of Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting was arranged by Rep. Jane Harman (D-Venice). Rep. Dana
Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) and staffers from the offices of
Reps. Joe Baca (D-Rialto) and Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) also attended.</TE>
<TE>   To counter the lobbying onslaught, anti-airport forces this week
distributed a poll to the FAA, Navy, and federal and local officials
showing that 61% of Orange County voters oppose building an airport
at El Toro. The poll of 750 registered voters countywide was used to
counter arguments by pro-airport forces that public support remains
for an airport at El Toro because 20 out of 34 cities voted against
last month's park measure.</TE>
<TE>   In the middle of the competing lobbying efforts, Orange County
Supervisor Cynthia P. Coad, who cast Tuesday's pivotal vote to allow
Irvine to annex the base, said she wants the city to put in writing a
promise to share as much as $800,000 a year in property tax revenue
from base development with the county.</TE>
<TE>   The money would be used to create more parks in north Orange
County.</TE>
<TE>   An agreement approved Tuesday by supervisors calls for Irvine to
share 82% of property tax funds from the base. But that amount would
be zero if the city follows through with plans to create a
redevelopment agency to fund improvements at the base.</TE>
<TE>   Creating a redevelopment zone diverts all new property taxes into
a redevelopment fund; there are no taxes currently paid on El Toro to
be shared because the federal government doesn't pay local property
taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Coad indicated Wednesday that without that agreement, she would
oppose Irvine's final annexation application.</TE>
<TE>   Ward said Coad will have a promise in writing within two weeks to
lock in the future tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "We will make sure that there are the funds that Supervisor Coad
wants somehow," Ward said. "She went out on a limb to support us and
we really, really appreciate it."</TE>

<HD>Deaf Travelers Sue S.F. Airport</HD>
<DH>Transportation: They seek more visual information, other
improvements at the busy facility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Anyone who has felt frustrated while traveling through an airport in
this post-Sept. 11 world should consider what happens to Colin
Piotrowski.</LD>
<LD>   Each time he goes to San Francisco International, the 30-year-old
college student--who has been deaf since birth--struggles to
negotiate an obstacle course of ticket counters, boarding gates and
security areas that offer him no visual information, and where
workers lack training in sign language.</LD>
<LD>   Relying on a haphazard combination of written notes and the often
incomplete departure and arrival screens, Piotrowski has nearly
missed flights and has been waylaid at security checkpoints where no
one could communicate why he had been detained.</LD>
<TE>   "It's nerve-racking and embarrassing," he said through an
interpreter. "Once, I apparently set off an alarm and these security
people rushed up to me. And even though I pointed to my ears, that I
couldn't hear, they kept talking, giving me orders. I know I'm deaf,
but those trips to the airport really make me feel disabled."</TE>
<TE>   Piotrowski is now a plaintiff in a class-action lawsuit filed
Wednesday against San Francisco International Airport and the city
that runs it. The suit accuses the defendants of flagrantly violating
the needs and rights of travelers with hearing disabilities by
failing to fix "multiple access, communication and training problems"
at the world's ninth-busiest airport.</TE>
<TE>   Sid Wolinsky, director of litigation for the Oakland-based
nonprofit Disability Rights Advocates, a co-counsel in the suit, said
access for the deaf has become a serious problem at most major
American airports. But he ranked San Francisco International among
the nation's worst for the way it treats those who are deaf or have
hearing problems.</TE>
<TE>   Activists say SFO recently completed an $840-million renovation,
but did not spend even a minimal amount of money to upgrade services
for the deaf.</TE>
<TE>   "The way most airports deal with deaf access is pretty slipshod
and incompetent, not to mention illegal," Wolinsky said. "But San
Francisco International has become a disaster waiting to happen for
most deaf travelers."</TE>
<TE>   Airport officials said Wednesday they had not seen the lawsuit but
defended their practices in assisting deaf passengers. "We abide by
the current codes," said Ron Fong, an SFO construction inspector.
"But we know there's always room for improvement."</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit, filed in federal district court in San Francisco,
calls for the creation of visual boards throughout the airport with
emergency, flight and paging information, along with monitors at
gates with information about pre-boarding, delays, gate changes and
cancellations. The suit also requires that security checkpoints post
signs containing common commands or questions; provide training for
airport workers in communication with the deaf; install text
telephones for the deaf, and hire sign-language interpreters.</TE>
<TE>   "SFO does not have one telecommunications device for the deaf,"
Wolinsky said. "There's no way for the deaf to use the courtesy
phones. They can't respond to pages; they don't even know when or if
they've been paged. In evacuations, there are no signboards. All
we're asking is that the airport pay at least as much attention to
its disabled travelers as their new art collection they seem so
fixated upon."</TE>
<TE>   Wolinsky estimated that as many as 10% of the 40 million
passengers who use SFO each year are deaf. He said many of the
changes, such as installing text telephones, can be done free of
charge by local phone companies.</TE>
<TE>   Fong acknowledged that the airport does not have a sign-language
interpreter on staff.</TE>
<TE>   And although SFO has text telephones, or TTY machines, that allow
deaf passengers to answer pages and contact airport security by
typing messages on a keyboard, he also acknowledged that the courtesy
phone cords did not reach the text machines, rendering them useless
for the disabled.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not our fault," he said. "Our security people say if we
made the phone cords any longer, they could be used as a weapon."</TE>
<TE>   Wolinsky said complaints have risen tenfold since Sept. 11, when
airports tightened security measures. While deaf travelers once could
have hearing friends or family escort them to a departure gate, those
escorts are now stopped by security.</TE>
<TE>   Most airports earn failing grades in assisting the deaf, he said,
including Los Angeles, Oakland and San Jose. However, facilities in
Portland, Ore., and Atlanta have been sensitive to the needs of
disabled passengers, proving that it can be done.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara LaBrosse, Americans with Disabilities coordinator for the
Portland International Airport, said the facility has a visual paging
program where deaf passengers can get information about evacuations
and other emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty simple," she said. "I don't know why such services
wouldn't be more widely used."</TE>
<TE>   Added Wolinsky: "Airports have long been more than an
inconvenience ... a dangerous place for the deaf. After 9/11, they've
become a nightmare."</TE>

<HD>Moorpark High Turns Out to Welcome Home Its Academic
Decathlon Team</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moorpark school officials had promised their Academic Decathlon team
that no matter what happened at the national competition in Phoenix,
they would come home to a hero's welcome.</LD>
<LD>   So although the nine students on Moorpark High School's team were
disappointed with their second-place finish in the U.S. Academic
Decathlon last week, just 579 points behind a team from Wisconsin,
they were greeted Wednesday by more than 1,800 cheering students and
teachers at a morning pep rally.</LD>
<LD>   "We have shared in your successes, celebrated your victories and
felt your disappointments," Principal Anna Merriman said. "Through
your hard work and dedication, you enabled all of us to use the term
'Moorpark High School' with great pride."</LD>
<TE>   It also was a chance to celebrate the team's accomplishments at
the nation's premiere scholastic contest, Merriman said, including
its first-place finish in the division for large schools, defined as
those with more than 1,500 students. In addition to that trophy, the
squad brought home 24 gold, silver and bronze medals.</TE>
<TE>   The team--seniors Michelle Kim, Julie Bristol, Dean Reich, Sergio
Suarez, Sheena Sidhu, Jerome Yang, Johnny Mendoza and Andy Song and
junior Nathaniel Jones--won the gold medal in the decathlon's Super
Quiz event, as well as several individual awards.</TE>
<TE>   Sergio, who was named the highest-scoring student from California,
won a gold medal and a $1,000 scholarship for his performance in the
annual two-day battle of the brains, as did Johnny. Julie won second
place and a $750 college scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   "We're absolutely thrilled with their accomplishments," said Phil
Gore, who coordinates the Ventura County decathlon for the
superintendent of schools office. "They are the neatest bunch of
students I've ever met, and their intellects are rivaled only by
their personalities."</TE>
<TE>   Decathletes, some of whom burst into tears when their second-place
finish was announced Saturday, said that being back to normal has
been a huge relief, peppered with some sadness.</TE>
<TE>   "It's over, so now we don't have to stay until late at night
studying our brains out, but in a way I miss having that time with my
teammates," said Michelle, 17, who is now focusing on making up
schoolwork and getting ready for the prom and graduation. Team
members watched videos together the other night and went to
Starbucks--where they had spent hours poring through study
material--and just talked.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still disappointing we didn't come in first, but I'm getting
over it," Michelle said. "Being able to meet these eight wonderful,
extremely intelligent and fun people has made it all worth it. If I
could, I would do it again."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A retired priest living in the rectory at Our Lady of Guadalupe
church in El Sereno apparently attempted suicide this week after
learning that the Los Angeles Police Department was investigating him
for alleged child abuse, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Father Stephen Hernandez, 68, cut his wrists and took an overdose
of pills, police said. The priest, who was found Monday morning, is
listed in stable condition at an undisclosed hospital, police said.</LD>
<LD>   "He is the subject of an ongoing investigation into sexual abuse
of minors," said LAPD Capt. Sharyn Buck.</LD>
<TE>   The investigation is one of several being conducted by the LAPD's
Sexually Exploited Child Unit. Buck said investigators are examining
about 50 reports of abuse from alleged victims or the Archdiocese of
Los Angeles. Some reports involve the same individuals, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez, who was ordained in 1982, tried to take his life after
police investigators contacted him while checking a tip, sources
said.</TE>
<TE>   The pastor of the parish was unavailable for comment Wednesday.
Archdiocesan officials said they were aware of the probe. "The LAPD
is conducting an investigation and we are cooperating with
authorities," said Tod Tamberg, a spokesman for the archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez retired from the ministry in 1997 at Our Lady of
Guadalupe on Mercury Avenue, but continued to work at the parish. The
church also operates a school with 425 students in kindergarten
through eighth grade.</TE>

<HD>Pretrial Secrecy Ignites Legal Clash</HD>
<DH>Court: Attorneys for accused child-killer and prosecutors
argue over sealing search results.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Prosecutors and defense attorneys squared off Wednesday over the need
for pretrial secrecy in the highly publicized case of David
Westerfield, charged with kidnapping and murdering 7-year-old
Danielle van Dam. There will be a hearing today with arguments likely
over the legality of a police interrogation of Westerfield and a
search of his home.</LD>
<LD>   Westerfield was arrested Feb. 22, three weeks after the girl was
discovered missing from her bedroom. Her nude, decomposing body was
found Feb. 27.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors allege that DNA links Westerfield to the crime and
that he harbored fantasies about sex with children. He also is
charged with possessing child pornography.</LD>
<TE>   Westerfield's attorneys argued before the 4th District Court of
Appeal on Wednesday that 200 pages of search warrant documents should
remain sealed, at least until Westerfield's trial--a request opposed
by prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Laura Schaefer told the appeals court that the
records of the police search of Westerfield's home should remain
sealed because the information might taint the potential jury pool.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Westerfield's right to receive a fair trial in which his life
may be at stake outweighs the public's right to know," Schaefer said.</TE>
<TE>   But Guylyn Cummins, an attorney for the San Diego Union-Tribune,
arguing for disclosure, said "publicity does not equal prejudice. You
can still find an impartial jury. It's virtually impossible not to
find an impartial jury."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Armstrong suggested a compromise:
Release the documents but black out some parts. "A complete seal
damages the press' interest and a complete unseal damages the
defendant's right to a fair trial," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The three-judge panel took the arguments under submission and
promised a ruling within a few days.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the tables will be turned if defense attorneys argue, as
expected, in Superior Court for full disclosure of the employment
records of San Diego police detectives. The detectives conducted
marathon interview sessions with Westerfield in the days after
Danielle was reported missing.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield's attorneys allege that police coerced and lied to
Westerfield in an effort to manipulate him into not exercising his
right to have an attorney present during questioning. Defense
attorneys say some of the police who interrogated Westerfield may
have a pattern of lying and trampling on the rights of criminal
defendants.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield's attorney, Robert Boyce, argued that he plans to ask
Superior Court Judge William Mudd to rule inadmissible much of the
evidence seized at Westerfield's home and many of the statements
Westerfield made to police. Boyce said the truthfulness of police
"will be an issue."</TE>
<TE>   Boyce claims that police failed to advise Westerfield of his
rights and ignored him when he "requested or inquired about a lawyer
at least 22 times." Among other things, Boyce said, he wants copies
of any psychiatric evaluations of the officers during their police
careers.</TE>
<TE>   City Atty. Casey Gwinn opposes the request for the officers'
personnel records. He called Boyce's request a "fishing trip" and
said the officers' right to secrecy would be violated.</TE>

<LD>At least one of California's bigger long-term power contracts could
be declared void because of a state official's conflict of interest,
according to a new analysis by the legislative counsel's office.</LD>
<LD>   In an opinion requested in August by state Sen. Tom McClintock
(R-Thousand Oaks), the Legislature's attorneys conclude that a
Department of Water Resources manager probably violated state
political reform laws by making decisions involving a company in
which he had a financial interest.</LD>
<LD>   The employee, unidentified in the legal opinion, owned $2,000 to
$10,000 in Allegheny Energy Supply stock when he helped negotiate a
10-year, $4-billion contract with the company.</LD>
<TE>   The department signed roughly $43 billion worth of long-term power
contracts last spring, and only after Gov. Gray Davis made the
contract public in the summer did it become clear that several of the
state's electricity buyers and contract negotiators owned stock in
energy companies with which the state did business.</TE>
<TE>   The legislative counsel's office studied one employee's situation
as an example, and said that for such a conflict to nullify a
contract, a judge would have to conclude that it might not have been
signed if not for the conflict of interest.</TE>
<TE>   The stage is set for such a court test. McClintock and the U.S.
Justice Foundation, a nonprofit group that describes itself as "your
conservative voice in the courts," filed suit in November seeking to
invalidate the contracts on grounds that they were negotiated in
secret and violate conflict-of-interest codes and antitrust laws.</TE>
<TE>   DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo questioned whether there is any
conflict at all in the Allegheny contract. It is unique, he said, in
that it was negotiated between the department and Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co., which then turned over the contract to Allegheny just before it
was signed.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has opened his own investigation of
whether Water Resources employees violated a code governing state
workers.</TE>

<HD>Disabled Protest Proposed Cutbacks</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thousands of developmentally disabled people in Ventura County turn
to nonprofit agencies like Arc for self-reliance, learning skills
from making breakfast to finding work.</LD>
<LD>   But proposed budget cuts will force such organizations that
receive state funding to turn people away, according to protesters at
a Wednesday rally at the Ventura County Government Center. The
gathering attracted more than 300 of the agencies' disabled clients,
their care providers and supporters.</LD>
<LD>   Simultaneous rallies were held in Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo
and Sacramento to protest Gov. Gray Davis' proposed $60-million
reduction in the budgets of the Department of Developmental Services
and the Department of Rehabilitation. The reduction will deny
services to 5,500 people statewide, rally organizers said.</LD>
<TE>   The state is facing an estimated budget shortfall of $17.5
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Countering Davis' proposal, rally participants had a suggestion of
their own: Support an Assembly bill that would reduce the population
of the state's seven institutions for developmentally disabled people
and redirect the funds to help them live in a community setting.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to stimulate conversation," said Peggy Bishop of
Work Training Programs. "A lot of people don't know that the programs
are in jeopardy. They don't realize the importance of the threat to
people's ability to live in the community."</TE>
<TE>   About 20 people at the rally stood roadside, waving signs asking
for support. Every now and then, a passing motorist offered a honk
and a wave, eliciting cheers from the crowd. Some passersby joined
the rally.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Dwight Hansen, vice president of government
affairs for the California Rehabilitation Assn., said that of the
185,000 Californians who are developmentally disabled, only 3,800
live in the seven state-owned institutions.</TE>
<TE>   "The state spends 25% of the budget on 2% of the disabled
population," he said. His group, an association of 135 nonprofits, is
lobbying for support of Assembly Bill 896, which was passed by the
Assembly and is now in the Senate Health Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents argue that the facilities are old and would cost nearly
$3 billion to renovate. Housing someone in a state facility costs
about $170,000 annually while the cost of services for people at
board-and-care homes and other facilities in the community is $12,000
a year, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "They should give regional organizations the funds and let the
clients live in the community," Bishop said. Doing so, she said,
would help the organizations overcome budget cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, supporters of the measure argue, people with disabilities
should have the opportunity to live on their own.</TE>
<TE>   "They're locked up in huge institutions," Hansen said. "Their
lives are governed by somebody else."</TE>
<TE>   "Many of these people [at the rally] spent much of their lives
living in the state hospital in Camarillo before it closed," said
Mary Kay, a local program director with Arc, a national network of
community agencies that provides educational, vocational and
residential services for people with developmental disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   . "Now they're all out here, being a part of the community.
Imagine the difference--now they can be out somewhere in the middle
of the day, work, go out and make friends," Kay said.</TE>
<TE>   Roy Perather, 64, moved from the hospital to a group home and now
lives in his own apartment in Simi Valley. About the difference that
living independently has made in his life, he simply says: "I am
happy. I am so happy, I can't put it into words."</TE>

<HD>Water, Silt Damage From Logging Angers Residents</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EUREKA</DL>
<LD>In this land of tree-sitters and tie-dye, Kristi Wrigley isn't your
typical North Coast logging foe.</LD>
<LD>   She's a third-generation apple farmer, a lifelong Republican.
Turning trees into boards doesn't usually make her angry. But ever
since Pacific Lumber Co. boosted its clear-cut of redwoods upstream
from her family's 25-acre ranch, Wrigley said she has seen problems
pour forth.</LD>
<LD>   Sticky mud cascading down hillsides filled Elk River out back.
Flood waters hit like never before. The apple orchards choked. No
longer could Wrigley draw from a crystal-clear stream. Now her
drinking water is trucked in.</LD>
<TE>   It's left Wrigley indignant. Along with a host of others in
Humboldt County, she believes that the California Department of
Forestry has failed to control the effect that timber harvests have
had on downstream neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   But that may be changing, with repercussions that could ripple
through private forest lands throughout the state.</TE>
<TE>   The North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board is set to
begin a two-day hearing today to decide if it should throw a new
regulatory hurdle in front of Pacific Lumber, setting strict limits
for the amount of silt that flows off the vast acreage it cuts above
the Elk River, Freshwater Creek and several other troubled streams.</TE>
<TE>   If so, pressure could increase for similar restrictions in the
timber country of the Sierra Nevada and other California forests. "It
could," concluded Forestry Department spokesman Louis Blumberg, "have
large implications for timber harvesting in this state."</TE>
<TE>   Hopes for a Big Harvest</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Lumber, which owns 211,000 timber acres in Humboldt
County, has hopes this year of a big harvest on Elk River, where the
chain saws have been quiet for the last two summers. But the water
board could take actions that would end up severely restricting how
many trees are felled or even halt the cut altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "We're concerned," said Jim Branham, the firm's government
relations director. "This would represent another regulatory burden
when we're already the most tightly restricted private landowner in
the state."</TE>
<TE>   For generations, Pacific Lumber logged its lands at a leisurely
rate that kept neighbors happy. But in 1986, the firm was acquired by
Texas financier Charles Hurwitz and his Maxaam Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The cut shot up dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   On the Elk River's north fork, logging went from 72 acres a year
in the decade before Hurwitz bought the firm to 504 annual acres
after the purchase.</TE>
<TE>   Water regulators said the firm's operations caused more silt to
cascade into the streams, washing mostly from poorly constructed
logging roads. From 1990 to 1997, the firm was cited by the state for
230 violations.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, however, Pacific Lumber "has cleaned up their
act," said Blumberg of the California Department of Forestry. To the
dismay of environmentalists, the department has concluded that
Pacific Lumber could log 600 acres a year on the Elk River and an
additional 500 annually above Freshwater Creek without making things
worse.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Lumber officials said renewed logging will actually reduce
the problems, providing income for roadwork and other improvements to
slash sediment flowing from their property. Jeff Barrett, Pacific
Lumber's fish and wildlife director, said computer modeling indicates
that 11 yards of muck will be eliminated by road improvements for
every yard produced by hillsides freshly shorn of trees.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll do more to fix these problems by harvesting than by not
harvesting," Barrett said.</TE>
<TE>   Such conclusions are laughable to environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   They contend that the logging needs to be slowed dramatically if
not stopped, or the meandering streams of the redwood country--and
other spots in the state's timberlands--will be lost for generations
to come.</TE>
<TE>   Fight Is Not About Fish</TE>
<TE>   "These watersheds are being ripped apart," said Cynthia Elkins of
the Environmental Protection Information Center in Garberville. "You
just cannot have logging like this and clean water at the same time."</TE>
<TE>   Though the water quality debate could affect the future of salmon
and steelhead trout that once filled the North Coast streams, this
fight is less about endangered fish and more about people.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the central players aren't the colorful collection of
anti-logging activists that typically dominate the front lines
hereabout, but rather workaday homeowners who inhabit the lush turf
downstream from Pacific Lumber's timber lands.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of them are private people who don't like to complain," said
Ken Miller of the Humboldt Water Shed Council, which is pressing the
clean-water fight. "They're not hippies. They're not yuppies. They
like logging; they just don't want it to hurt them. And they're very
upset."</TE>
<TE>   Residents said the rising sediments have polluted wells and caused
septic tanks to boil over. Washing machines have been worn out by the
grit that gets in. Houses that once seemed safe have been flooded
repeatedly. Some have spent thousands of dollars having their homes
raised a few feet to escape the water.</TE>
<TE>   Flood waters at a spot called Dead Woman's Corner on Elk River
Road have kept residents isolated for days at a time. Scott Keele, a
neighbor of Wrigley, bought a 12-foot rowboat to ferry family and
friends.</TE>
<TE>   Barrett of Pacific Lumber contended that the increased silt and
flooding can be explained by the vagaries of Mother Nature. Barrett
didn't deny that logging produces silt, but insisted that the bulk of
the problem was created by heavier rains during the late 1990s and a
bumper crop of landslides that sent muck flowing into rivers.</TE>
<TE>   Other scientists, however, have argued that logging is a prime
culprit. Sediment increased more than 1,000% on two heavily logged
North Coast tributaries--Stitz and Bear creeks--between 1994 and
1997, according to a North Coast water district report. Another study
found that so much silt has filled Elk Creek that flooding has
increased eightfold in just the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   On Freshwater Creek, homeowner Alan Cook pointed to the high-water
mark for the epic flood of 1955, when 19 inches of rain fell in five
days. In a 2-inch storm in January 2000, the river again hit that
mark.</TE>
<TE>   "It's impassable," said Cook, who has been cut off from his wife
and small children for days at a time. "The waters just rip through
here."</TE>
<TE>   Wrigley knows rising waters.</TE>
<TE>   Her family has been on this land, flanked by a sweeping bend of
the Elk River, for 99 years. They've been growing
apples--Gravensteins, Kings, Waltana--for most of that time. Rarely,
she said, did the river rise and pool around the base of the trees.
Now it seems to happen every winter.</TE>
<TE>   And the trees are suffering because of it, virtually drowning. In
years past, the thousand trees produced 900 boxes of apples even in a
bad year. Last season, Wrigley got just 250 cases of fruit.</TE>
<TE>   "They're just generally sick," she said. "Trees do not like wet
feet."</TE>
<TE>   The family used to draw water from the river for their household.
No more. The mud gave it an awful taste. The washing machine left
clothes covered with muck. A few years back, the water board got
Pacific Lumber to agree to truck in water a few times a month to
Wrigley and several neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   They've also banded together to sue, claiming that the lumber
company has violated their health and safety and trampled on their
property rights as it has cut redwoods on portions of the more than
21,000 acres it owns in the river's watershed.</TE>
<TE>   Others have come before them. Last year, Pacific Lumber agreed to
pay a $3.3-million settlement to 38 residents of the North Coast
timber town of Stafford, where a torrent of mud destroyed or damaged
10 homes.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing so dramatic has happened along the Elk River, but Wrigley
sees trouble in its murky waters.</TE>
<TE>   Logger Blames the Rainfall</TE>
<TE>   A childhood swimming hole is now a shallow, mud-filled pool. Fish
that used to carve a course upstream through the cobbles now are
never seen. A second house just downriver flooded four times in the
45 years before Pacific Lumber revved up its logging on the Elk
River, Wrigley said.</TE>
<TE>   When she approached officials at Pacific Lumber, which owns every
acre to the east of her, the message was the same: It's the rain.</TE>
<TE>   Wrigley harbors no ill will against loggers. They're neighbors,
friends, great people, she said, "hard-working, honest." But the
management of the timber firm has taken "those sweet boys and used
them," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "If they start up logging again," Wrigley concluded, "they'll bury
this river."</TE>

<HD>Tax Hike Helps City Keep Its Good Looks</HD>
<DH>Government: Irvine landowners approve a doubling of parcel
levy for parks, street lights and landscaping.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irvine property owners agreed to double a special tax that keeps the
parks pretty, streets well-lighted and the city's well-manicured look
intact.</LD>
<LD>   The parcel tax, approved initially in 1997, received 56% of the
vote.</LD>
<LD>   The average Irvine property owner will pay an extra $35 a year to
keep the town well-groomed. The tax will generate $3.2 million a
year, or roughly half the amount needed to keep Irvine's city parks
in good shape and its streets lighted.</LD>
<TE>   Mayor Larry Agran said the tax increase was crucial to the city's
image.</TE>
<TE>   "If this failed, it would have sent a signal that we are prepared
to allow our standards to slip dramatically," Agran said. "In Irvine,
we take great pride in the fact that we have the best lighting, the
best landscaping and the best parks around."</TE>
<TE>   Ballots were mailed to about 60,000 landowners, but fewer than 40%
were returned. The Irvine Co., the city's largest landowner,
accounted for 18.5% of the ballots cast, which city consultants
finished counting Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Greg Smith, an opponent of the parcel tax,
wondered about the timing of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   "In a down economy, when people are hurting, this is the wrong
time to raise taxes," he said. "I think this money will probably be
going more to pet projects than for keeping the parks nice."</TE>
<TE>   Some residents who opposed the tax argued that the assessment,
which shows up on property tax bills, is a form of double taxation
because they pay property taxes for such maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   Also, almost two-thirds of Irvine residents pay fees to homeowner
associations to cover similar maintenance expenses within their
neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   But Agran argued that rising energy costs and growth in the city
have driven up the cost of keeping Irvine pretty.</TE>
<TE>   "Irvine has always set the highest standards with their city's
landscaping and lighting," he said. "The voters have simply decided
to sustain it."</TE>
<TE>   The parcel tax measure also calls for a $100,000 gift to the
financially strapped Irvine Unified School District.</TE>

<HD>Ton of Sludge Leaks Onto Street</HD>
<DH>Environment: Sewage treatment solids escape from truck in
Fountain Valley. Sanitation District says no residents were at risk.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A truck leaked a ton of sewage sludge in Fountain Valley on
Wednesday, leaving a wide trail of smelly black waste on Euclid
Street and shutting down a freeway offramp for six hours.</LD>
<LD>   The dump truck had left the Orange County Sanitation District
treatment plant shortly before 8 a.m. carrying 50,000 pounds of
solids left over from sewage treatment when the driver noticed the
truck was leaking. The sludge was headed to a farm in Kern County to
be used as fertilizer on nonfood crops, district spokeswoman Lisa
Murphy said.</LD>
<LD>   The driver made a U-turn and returned to the district plant on
Euclid Street. The truck leaked about 6,000 pounds of
sludge--one-third on the street and the remainder on district
property--before workers blocked the leak.</LD>
<TE>   City police closed a southbound San Diego Freeway offramp and
parts of Euclid Street. District officials also notified city, fire,
county health and state water officials.</TE>
<TE>   Workers used shovels, a vacuum truck and a street sweeper to clean
the roadway, Murphy said. She said the spill posed no health hazard
to nearby residents, and the roads were reopened about 2 p.m.
Mechanics will try to determine what caused the leak.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby residents are not in danger from airborne particles, since
the sludge is slightly wet, said Kurt Berchtold, assistant executive
officer with the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board.</TE>
<TE>   "There would be a health hazard if [people] came in direct contact
with the stuff," he said, because of bacteria and viruses in the
material. "Provided there's restricted public access of the area and
the cleanup is effective, there shouldn't be a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Sludge is commonly used as a fertilizer in the United States.
However, safety concerns have increased in recent years. The U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency has asked the National Academy of
Sciences to review potential health risks, which could include
gastrointestinal, skin and respiratory infections. Nineteen counties
in California have restricted the use of certain types of sludge.</TE>

<HD>Felony Is Added in Abuse Case</HD>
<DH>Court: L.A. County sheriff's sergeant and his wife, a
principal, accused of child endangerment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County prosecutors filed a felony charge Wednesday against a
Los Angeles County sheriff's sergeant and his wife, a school
principal, who were charged last year with abusing their teen-age
son.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors alleged in court documents that sheriff's Sgt. Grady
Machnick beat and pushed his 14-year-old son and that his wife,
Deborah, made her stepson pose for nude photographs and smeared dog
feces on his backpack.</LD>
<LD>   The couple was scheduled to stand trial Monday on a misdemeanor
charge, but prosecutors decided the conduct was serious enough to
support a felony charge, said Tori Richards, a district attorney
spokeswoman.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors accused the couple of conspiracy to commit child
endangerment, a felony that carries a sentence of up to three years
in prison. In court documents, prosecutors also accused the couple of
forcing the boy to sleep on a dog mat outside their Yorba Linda home.
Locked out of the house, the boy had to use a restroom at a
neighborhood park.</TE>
<TE>   "We decided this case had to be a felony because their conduct was
so egregious," Richards said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the Machnicks nor their attorneys could be reached for
comment. An attorney for Grady Machnick has denied that his client
abused the boy, saying any actions were appropriate discipline.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said the boy was abused between 1997 and 2001 as
punishment for not finishing homework or for returning home late from
school.</TE>
<TE>   Grady Machnick, 45, and his wife, 46, are scheduled to appear in
court Thursday morning to face the felony charge.</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Machnick, 46, was working as principal of Cyrus J. Morris
Elementary School in Walnut when the allegations surfaced. Her
husband worked at the Los Angeles County Jail.</TE>
<TE>   The boy "was placed in a very loving foster home and he's doing
very well," Richards said.</TE>

<LD>Three women were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after they
allegedly beat and doused a female neighbor with lighter fluid
because they mistakenly believed she molested one of their daughters,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Yvonne Roach, 26, of Yucca Valley was taken Tuesday to High Desert
Medical Center, where she was treated for gashes to her head, a
broken arm and several broken teeth, investigators said.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said Mindy Pyle, 26, believed, based on statements
made by her 6-year-old daughter, that Roach had molested her child.</LD>
<TE>   Pyle, Katherin Aceves, 25, and Vickie Lynne Hammond, 44, all of
Yucca Valley, beat Roach with various household items, including a
frying pan and a fireplace poker, said San Bernardino County
Sheriff's Sgt. John Ginter.</TE>
<TE>   Pyle told authorities Roach had molested her daughter. But the
6-year-old told investigators she had not been abused by her
neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   Pyle, Aceves and Hammond are being held in lieu of $500,000 bail.</TE>

<HD>Accountant Found Dead in West Valley Apartment</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Police are trying to determine if it was a
homicide. Neighbor reports hearing suspicious noises the night before
the body was discovered.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANUEL GAMIZ JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>West Valley detectives were trying to determine Wednesday whether a
39-year-old accountant found dead in his Woodland Hills apartment was
slain.</LD>
<LD>   The man was identified as Kyle Jonathan Frieze, said Det. Rick
Swanston of the West Valley Division.</LD>
<LD>   A security guard discovered Frieze's body about 4 p.m. Tuesday
after co-workers called the apartment complex when Frieze didn't show
up for work, Los Angeles Police Officer Esther Myape said. Detectives
would say only that Frieze had suffered severe trauma.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County coroner's office received the case as a
reported homicide, spokesman Craig Harvey said.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors in the Oakwood Apartments in the 22100 block of Erwin
Street said Frieze was so quiet that some thought the apartment was
vacant.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really a quiet and safe place to live," said Don Reid, a
financial planner who lives next door in the complex, which provides
temporary housing for corporate clients. "You can hear people walking
around and closing their doors, but his apartment was always quiet."</TE>
<TE>   But Reid said he heard "suspicious" noises coming from his
neighbor's apartment between 10:30 and 11 Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   "These were sounds I never heard before," Reid said. "It was like
someone was banging up against the wall. Almost sounded like someone
was moving furniture."</TE>
<TE>   Reid speculated that Frieze knew whomever was in the apartment
because there were no sounds of anyone breaking in and he didn't hear
any screams or cries for help.</TE>

<LD>An escalating fight over the proposed 3,050-home Ahmanson Ranch
subdivision moved to a Ventura hearing room Wednesday, with warring
factions offering reasons why an environmental study should either be
approved or thrown out.</LD>
<LD>   More than a dozen opponents attacked the study as flawed because
it does not update 10-year-old traffic projections for the planned
mini-city at Ventura County's southeast boundary near Calabasas.</LD>
<LD>   Studies of wildlife and water quality, particularly runoff that
would reach Malibu Creek, are also inadequate, opponents charged.</LD>
<TE>   Larry Horner, representing U.S. Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman
Oaks), said an estimated 45,000 car trips a day generated by the
project is probably understated.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got gridlock everywhere in Southern California, and that is
unacceptable to the congressman," Horner told the county's
Environmental Report Review Committee.</TE>
<TE>   But an even larger number of supporters told the panel that the
analysis is thorough and should be approved.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing neon-green stickers that read, "Yes, Build It," several
noted that the development has gone through a 15-year review process
in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Tepper, a Hidden Hills real estate attorney, said Ahmanson
Land Co. has done a good job designing the project and has abided by
all laws and regulations in getting it approved.</TE>
<TE>   He criticized another speaker's contention that the developer has
ignored contaminated soil.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a smoke screen that has been raised before and litigated
to the Court of Appeal," Tepper said. "It's a false set of facts."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's four-hour session was the first in a series of public
hearings that will be held in coming months as the environmental
study works its way to the Ventura County Board of Supervisors.
Although the board approved the project in 1992, developer Washington
Mutual Bank hit a snag in 1999 when its biologists found a rare
flower and frog in the rolling, oak-studded hills.</TE>
<TE>   The discoveries prompted Ventura County to commission a
supplemental environmental impact report, required under state law
when significant new information emerges.</TE>
<TE>   Released in February, the report said the project would harm the
frogs and flowers but that safeguards could reduce the problem to
acceptable levels.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors must approve the report before construction can begin.</TE>
<TE>   The six-member Environmental Report Review Committee is made up of
county planning and technical staff. Wednesday's meeting will be
followed by another session May 1, where more public testimony will
be taken.</TE>
<TE>   If the technical committee finds that the supplemental report
complies with state law, it will next be reviewed by the county
Planning Commission. The Board of Supervisors will be the last to
weigh in on the supplemental study, possibly in the fall, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   The project has withstood more than a dozen lawsuits over the past
decade, most filed by opponents. But opposition to the 2,800-acre
residential, retail and office development has gained strength in
recent months as high-profile activists revived a campaign to stop
it.</TE>
<TE>   Rally to Save Ahmanson Ranch, co-chaired by Hollywood director Rob
Reiner and HBO executive Chris Albrecht, has vowed to halt the
project.</TE>

<HD>Woman, 19, Killed in Drag-Racing Accident</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: Her boyfriend, who was speeding against his
brother in El Rio, is injured.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 19-year-old mother of a month-old girl was killed and her
boyfriend seriously injured after he lost control of his car while
drag-racing against his brother in El Rio and slamming head-on into
another vehicle, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Noemi Romero, an Oxnard resident who gave birth to the couple's
daughter, Daveena, on March 15 and graduated from Hueneme High School
in June, was pronounced dead at the scene of the Tuesday night crash,
Senior Deputy Medical Examiner Armando Chavez said.</LD>
<LD>   Darnell Thompson, 20, of Oxnard, who graduated from Hueneme High
School in 2000, was the driver of the black 1988 Honda Civic,
California Highway Patrol Officer Steve Reid said.</LD>
<TE>   Thompson was listed in serious condition at St. John's Regional
Medical Center in Oxnard Wednesday, hospital officials said.</TE>
<TE>   His 21-year-old brother, Donald, a 1999 graduate and former
football star at Hueneme High, was not injured. He was driving a
white Honda Civic.</TE>
<TE>   The driver of the other car involved in the crash, Gabriella
Ayala, 19, of Oxnard, was treated for minor injuries and released
from Ventura County Medical Center. Her 2-year-old daughter, who was
strapped in a child-protective seat in the 1991 Camaro, was not
injured, Reid said.</TE>
<TE>   No arrests have been made, Reid said. CHP investigators will turn
over their findings to the district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Alcohol was not a factor in the crash, Reid said.</TE>
<TE>   The dead woman's mother, Maria Romero, was grieving with family
and friends Wednesday at her Port Hueneme home while making funeral
plans for the second-oldest of her four children.</TE>
<TE>   She said Noemi had known Darnell Thompson since they were in high
school and that her daughter told her on more than one occasion that
Thompson liked to race.</TE>
<TE>   "And I always told her don't get in the car with him," Romero
said. "I'm going with my faith now and my family is giving me
strength."</TE>
<TE>   Court records show that the Thompson brothers had been cited in
recent years for speeding or reckless driving.</TE>
<TE>   On May 25, Darnell Thompson was cited by Oxnard police and paid a
$114 fine for "exceeding safe speed." Six days later, he was cited
for "speed exhibition." He paid a $385 fine and was placed on three
years' probation.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Thompson paid a $270 fine for speeding after being cited in
November 2000 by Ventura County sheriff's deputies. In March 2001, he
was stopped by deputies and cited for being an unlicensed driver and
driving with a suspended license. He was ordered to pay a $420 fine.</TE>
<TE>   It was unknown whether Donald Thompson's driving privileges had
been reinstated before the crash, Reid said.</TE>
<TE>   Noemi Romero's daughter, Daveena, was born six weeks premature,
Maria Romero said. Because of an intestinal irregularity, the infant
has spent the last few weeks at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The couple were living with Thompson's relatives in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   Several witnesses told investigators that before the accident the
Thompson brothers sped side by side down Rose Avenue north of the
Ventura Freeway. The road has a posted speed of 45 mph, Reid said.</TE>
<TE>   As the cars headed south on Rose near Walnut Drive, Darnell
Thompson lost control of his car, drove over a divider and slammed
into Ayala's car, Reid said.</TE>
<TE>   Romero's death on Tuesday was the latest in a string of recent
tragedies that have touched the Hueneme High School campus.</TE>
<TE>   On March 27, Artis Jackson, a 25-year-old former member of the
school's football team, was stabbed to death after a fight in an
Oxnard apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Four days earlier, 18-year-old Jessica Ann Mohorko, a promising
senior at the school, was killed when the car in which she was riding
was broadsided by a CHP patrol car in pursuit of a speeding motorist.</TE>
<TE>   Mohorko's boyfriend, Chris Haynes, the captain of the Hueneme High
football team, was driving the car in which she was riding. He was
injured in the accident.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, a popular member of the school's student
government died of cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Yearbook photographs of Noemi show an elegant, serious-looking
girl who performed alongside the school's marching band at sporting
events as a member of the flag auxiliary.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been tough and it's been a somber time," football Coach
Larry Miller said. "There's the realization that you never know what
can happen, so you have to be all you can be."</TE>

<HD>Masry's Complaint to State Accuses Hoffman Campaign of
Illegal Activity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thousand Oaks Mayor Ed Masry has filed a complaint with state
regulators alleging that failed supervisorial candidate Randy
Hoffman's campaign illegally coordinated political research and
strategy with a so-called independent expenditure committee that
supported Hoffman.</LD>
<LD>   Independent expenditure committees may spend unlimited amounts in
support of a candidate so long as their efforts are not coordinated
with the candidate.</LD>
<LD>   Hoffman, a Thousand Oaks entrepreneur, lost to Councilwoman Linda
Parks in the March 5 primary to succeed retiring county Supervisor
Frank Schillo.</LD>
<TE>   Masry, a trial lawyer, is one of Parks' closest supporters. Masry
filed the complaint with the state's Fair Political Practices
Commission on letterhead from his law firm, not city stationery.</TE>
<TE>   In the complaint, Masry also alleged the independent expenditure
committee, Ventura Taxpayers for Responsible Government, and the
group's major donors deliberately delayed filing contribution
disclosures to obscure supporters' identities until after the
election.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman denied any coordination with the independent committee,
calling Masry's April 2 complaint "preposterous."</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman said he had filed a complaint against Parks the day before
the election. That filing, Hoffman said, was the reason Masry was
retaliating against him.</TE>
<TE>   In that complaint to the commission, Hoffman alleged Parks had
failed to disclose all her campaign contributions. He argued the
market rate and postage for Parks' last-minute advertisements would
cost more than she reported having in her war chest.</TE>
<TE>   After the election, Hoffman was appointed to the Planning
Commission. Parks supported Hoffman's nomination; Masry abstained.</TE>

<HD>Murder Suspect Says He Was With Family at Time of Crime</HD>
<DH>Courts: Richard Geise denies slaying a Ventura market clerk
last April. He says two men, now dead, told him they were responsible
for the fatal robbery attempt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Murder defendant Richard Geise took the stand Wednesday, contending
that he was with his family at the time that police say he was
involved in a deadly robbery attempt at a Ventura market.</LD>
<LD>   Geise, a 32-year-old former Ojai resident, also told jurors that
two men he believes are responsible for the April 2001 killing
confessed to him a few hours after the crime at a Ventura motel.</LD>
<LD>   Geise said one of those men was his cousin, Alfonso Delgado Jr.</LD>
<TE>   "He said they went there to rob the Central Market," the defendant
testified. "He said they wouldn't open the safe and one of the
gentlemen reached for a gun and he started shooting. They both
started shooting."</TE>
<TE>   Geise is charged with one count of murder, two counts of attempted
murder and several other charges stemming from the shooting at the
family owned market on Ventura Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   About 1 p.m. on April 6, 2001, two men wearing gas masks rushed
into the store and demanded that clerks give them money, police said.
Before the clerks had a chance to comply, police said, the men opened
fire, killing clerk Primitivo Alejandro Alvarez, 35, and wounding two
other employees.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Willard Wiksell has argued since the start of the
trial last week that although his client is an admitted drug dealer
and thief, he was not at the small market that day.</TE>
<TE>   "You've committed a laundry list of crimes [in the past]," Wiksell
said while questioning Geise. "Did you kill anybody?"</TE>
<TE>   Geise said he never had.</TE>
<TE>   Wiksell contends Delgado teamed up with his friend, Sam Patterson,
for the robbery. Delgado was killed a month after the attempted heist
during a shootout with police, and Patterson died of a drug overdose
months after that.</TE>
<TE>   During two hours of questioning, Wiksell had Geise reconstruct the
time before and after the killing, starting with waking up about 11
a.m. the day of the shooting, and ending with his arrest on drug
charges a day later.</TE>
<TE>   Geise testified that between 12:30 and 12:45 p.m., he left a
Seaward Avenue motel where he was staying with his girlfriend to meet
his wife and infant son in the parking lot of a Chinese restaurant a
few blocks away.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the restaurant, Geise said, he and his wife talked about
their pending divorce and child custody issues as they played with
their son, who was just starting to walk.</TE>
<TE>   Geise said he was with his family for 30 to 40 minutes before
returning to the motel. The scenario places Geise more than two miles
from the crime scene at the time the clerk was shot.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the shooting, Geise said, he picked up a cell phone
that was being repaired at a store on Main Street near Ventura
Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   By 3:30 p.m., Geise said, Delgado and Patterson showed up at his
motel room asking for his help in making fake identification cards.
Geise admitted in court that he provided such illegal services.</TE>
<TE>   Despite objections from Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Don Glynn,
Superior Court Judge Ronald N. Purnell ruled that Geise could tell
jurors about the alleged confessions made to him by Delgado and
Patterson.</TE>
<TE>   In his cross-examination, Glynn focused on portraying the
defendant as a habitual liar who allegedly gave police one alibi and
then changed it.</TE>
<TE>   According to a police report cited in court, Geise told
investigators he had gone to Magic Mountain with his family on the
day of the killing.</TE>
<TE>   On the witness stand, Geise said he never told police he had gone
to the amusement park.</TE>
<TE>   He also allegedly told police that drugs found at his motel
belonged to other people, as did computer equipment used to make IDs.
On Wednesday he admitted the drugs and computer belonged to him.</TE>
<TE>   During a hearing outside the presence of the jury, Glynn said
Geise "seems to have a habit of finding other people to blame when he
is charged."</TE>
<TE>   Jurors are in recess until Monday, when they are expected to begin
deliberations.</TE>

<HD>Oxnard College Names President</HD>
<DH>Education: Selection of Lydia Ledesma-Reese, head of a
two-year school in the Northwest, fills a nearly 11/2-year vacancy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA LEFF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The top official of a Washington community college--an immigrant
rights advocate with Southern California roots--was hired Wednesday
as the new president of Oxnard College.</LD>
<LD>   Lydia Ledesma-Reese, president of Skagit Valley College in Mount
Vernon, Wash., was selected by Ventura County Community College
District Chancellor Phillip Westin just hours after he had
interviewed her and three other finalists for the job.</LD>
<LD>   On July 1 Ledesma-Reese assumes the $138,744-a-year post, vacant
since December 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Westin said Ledesma-Reese, 53, was his top pick based on her
personal and professional experience. Westin said he liked that she
attended community college as a reentry student, worked at UC Irvine,
still teaches part time and has held leadership posts in several
national organizations, including the National Community College
Hispanic Council.</TE>
<TE>   "Lydia brought that extra thing that we needed," Westin said. "She
passionately cares about the mission of the community college. She
passionately cares about the diverse students we have at Oxnard
College. She is a woman of color herself and she lives that."</TE>
<TE>   The other candidates were Erlinda J. Martinez, vice president of
student services at Cerritos College in Norwalk; Rose-Marie Joyce,
president and superintendent of the Gavilan Joint Community College
District in Gilroy, and Craig S. Washington, executive assistant to
the chancellor of the Pima County Community College District in
Tucson.</TE>
<TE>   At Oxnard College, news of Ledesma-Reese's appointment was greeted
with cheers, said Academic Senate President Mary Jones, who led a
campus screening committee that winnowed the original pool of 61
applicants to the four finalists. "We're really, really thrilled.
There is a genuine sense of relief."</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard College has had five permanent and interim presidents since
1994, and the latest search effort represented the district's third
attempt to find a successor to Steven Arvizu, who resigned for health
reasons 17 months ago.</TE>
<TE>   The first search resulted in too few applicants, and the second
ended last fall without an appointment after Westin decided neither
of the two finalists was qualified.</TE>
<TE>   According to Jones, each of the four finalists had some faculty
support after a public forum on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   But Ledesma-Reese emerged as the clear favorite of several
students, including Student Body President Albert Mendez, a screening
committee member.</TE>
<TE>   "As a student, I feel she is the one," Mendez said. "She was the
whole package."</TE>
<TE>   Ledesma-Reese endeared herself to many in the audience when she
confided she was attracted to the Oxnard position in part because it
would allow her to live nearer to her 3-year-old granddaughter and
soon-to-be born grandson in Placentia.</TE>
<TE>   She also won fans when she described her background as a young
mother of two who entered Cypress College in Orange County at age 26
and spent five years earning her associate's degree.</TE>
<TE>   She went on to obtain both her bachelor's and master's degrees in
speech communication from Cal State Fullerton. She later earned a
doctorate in institutional management from Pepperdine University.</TE>
<TE>   After spending eight years as an administrator at UC Irvine,
Ledesma-Reese was a dean at Cerritos College and De Anza College in
Cupertino before moving to Hartnell College in Salinas, where she
served two years as vice president for instruction and assistant
superintendent. She has been president of Skagit Valley College since
1995, and has testified before the state Legislature on a need for
bilingual education and rights for immigrant students.</TE>

<LD>   Ventura County Medical Examiner Ronald O'Halloran told a judge at
a preliminary hearing for Barroso's alleged killer that the
20-year-old Moorpark woman likely died of a gunshot wound to the
abdomen.</LD>
<LD>   O'Halloran found two pieces of a bullet lodged inside Barroso's
remains during an autopsy, and bullet holes in her clothes matched
wounds to her body.</LD>
<TE>   The coroner said Barroso probably lived for several hours after
being shot because the bullet fragments appeared to have missed her
kidneys and aorta.</TE>
<TE>   O'Halloran's opinion on the time of death is consistent with
testimony offered by two other medical experts.</TE>
<TE>   Barroso was reported missing after her bullet-riddled car was
found abandoned near a freeway overpass in the early morning hours of
July 5. Her remains were recovered a month later in a canyon near
Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors contend that Vincent Sanchez, a 31-year-old Simi
Valley handyman, shot Barroso, then kidnapped and sexually assaulted
her before she died.</TE>
<TE>   They are seeking the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   But defense attorneys say there is no evidence of rape, and they
have tried to show that Barroso could have died almost immediately
after being shot.</TE>
<TE>   O'Halloran acknowledged on cross-examination that he cannot rule
out that bullet fragments hit Barroso's kidney and resulted in death
within minutes. But he called the scenario unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   O'Halloran said he could not examine Barroso's body for sexual
trauma because of decomposition. He testified that she was found
wearing only a T-shirt and panties.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony is scheduled to resume today in Ventura County Superior
Court.</TE>

<LD>Three women were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after they
allegedly beat and doused a female neighbor with lighter fluid
because they mistakenly believed she molested one of their daughters,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Yvonne Roach, 26, of Yucca Valley was taken Tuesday to High Desert
Medical Center, where she was treated for gashes to her head, a
broken arm and several broken teeth, investigators said.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said Mindy Pyle, 26, believed, based on statements
made by her 6-year-old daughter, that Roach had molested her child.</LD>
<TE>   Pyle; Katherin Aceves, 25; and Vickie Lynne Hammond, 44, all of
Yucca Valley, beat Roach with various household items, including a
frying pan and a fireplace poker, said San Bernardino County
Sheriff's Sgt. John Ginter.</TE>
<TE>   Pyle tried to stab Roach with a kitchen knife and eventually
doused the woman with lighter fluid, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors called deputies.</TE>
<TE>   Pyle told authorities Roach had molested her daughter.</TE>
<TE>   But the 6- year-old told investigators she had not been abused by
her neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, we believe the parent and the suspects involved over
reacted to statements from the child," Ginter said. "They drew their
own conclusions and went over there and beat her up.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just crazy. And sad."</TE>
<TE>   Pyle, Aceves and Hammond were each booked into the Morongo Basin
Jail and are being held in lieu of $500,000 bail.</TE>

<HD>Powell's Peace Mission Yields No Cease-Fire</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Secretary heads home after security and political strife
thwarts an accord. He calls on both sides to make choices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>In a serious setback to the Bush administration's foreign policy,
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell left the Middle East on Wednesday with
little to show for his ambitious 10-day peace mission, quickly triggering
angry rhetoric and fears of new bloodshed.</LD>
<LD>   Powell failed most significantly to work out terms for a cease-fire to
end nearly 19 months of violence, which has blown up into a region-wide
crisis during the last three weeks of suicide bombings and Israel's
reoccupation of many areas in the West Bank.</LD>
<LD>   He was also unable to win agreement on an international conference to
launch a political process on a final settlement between Israel and the
Arab world, a step that would be key to providing incentives to end the
violence and prevent the spillover of bloodshed into the wider region.</LD>
<TE>   "Secretary Powell leaves the situation much worse than when he came
in," senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said after Powell held his
final talks with Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat in the
West Bank city of Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   At a subsequent news conference, a tired and grim-faced Powell said he
had "listened carefully" and "probed hard." He claimed that he had gained
broad support for a comprehensive strategy that embraces three
components--political, security and humanitarian issues--to move forward.</TE>
<TE>   But in the end, America's top diplomat was unable to be a catalyst in
dealing with the security and political disputes blocking the peace
process. Failure to break the deadlock could in turn have a ripple effect
on the Bush administration as it pursues a war on terrorism, the
all-absorbing focus of President Bush's foreign policy, analysts in the
region warned.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before leaving Jerusalem, Powell called on Israelis and
Palestinians to make strategic choices to break the deadlock.</TE>
<TE>   "Both sides will have to compromise. Both sides will have to make
difficult choices. And both sides may well have to shift from long-held
positions," he told the televised news conference.</TE>
<TE>   In a reflection of the chicken-and-egg problem all the parties face,
he added, "There can be no peace without security, but there can also be
no security without peace." At least 1,278 Palestinians and 452 Israelis
have been killed since the Palestinian uprising began in September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The secretary said he was disappointed in Arafat, whom he pressed to
stop equivocating on the violence and suicide attacks against Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "We believed all along that he could have done more. . . . The world
is looking for him to make a strategic choice and lead his people down
the path of peace and reconciliation and let the international community
help him," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   "If he does not make that strategic choice, it becomes very difficult
for the United States, or for anyone else, frankly, to play a role in
achieving what the Palestinian people want, and that is peace and a state
of their own," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat must issue orders to his remaining security forces to arrest
and prosecute extremists, dismantle the terrorist infrastructure in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip and stop incitement, the secretary said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Arafat issued a strong statement before his talks with Powell
that condemned all terrorist attacks, including a suicide bombing Friday
that killed six people and injured dozens, words are not enough, the
secretary added.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat might be "constrained" in his ability to move about or to
communicate from his besieged headquarters in Ramallah, but the
Palestinian leader still has "a powerful voice" and a leadership position
from which to rein in extremists, Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian Authority "must decide, as the rest of the world has
decided, that terrorism must end," Powell said. "Arafat must take that
message to his people."</TE>
<TE>   To facilitate that process, the U.S. plans to resume contact soon with
Palestinian security forces to evaluate their capabilities in the
aftermath of massive Israeli detentions and destruction of police
stations, computer databases, communications and vehicles. The U.S. goal
is to restore cooperation between Palestinian and Israeli security
forces, Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   But Powell also had firm language for the government of Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon. Despite an "unshakable" U.S. commitment to
Israel's security, Powell called on the Jewish state to expedite its
withdrawal from West Bank villages and towns and to "look beyond the
destructive impact of the [Jewish] settlements and occupation, both of
which must end."</TE>
<TE>   Israel should instead embrace "the promise" now offered by a recent
Arab League proposal for a comprehensive and lasting peace, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Sharon has provided a timetable for an Israeli withdrawal,
Powell said he was eager to see the long-promised movement and had
stressed the urgency of its completion in talks with the prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   En route home, Powell briefed the Egyptian and Jordanian foreign
ministers in Cairo on his mission and told them that Israel's defiance of
U.S. and international pressure to withdraw from the West Bank was the
plug that prevented movement on a cease-fire, according to a well-placed
diplomat who asked to remain anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   Powell understands that the "first order of business is withdrawal.
That is the message he is going back with," the diplomat said.</TE>
<TE>   The Arabs are counting on Powell to persuade Bush to further pressure
Sharon to withdraw completely and permanently. "This is a call the
president has to make," the source added.</TE>
<TE>   Bush on Wednesday said Israel "must continue its withdrawals. . . .
The time is now for all to make the choice for peace."</TE>
<TE>   But the pullout has been further complicated by Israel's plans for
search-and-arrest raids into areas from which it has withdrawn, as
intelligence provides new leads. Israel also plans to build new buffer
zones within the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   After his talks with Powell, a visibly angry Arafat charged that
Israel's raids signal its "continuing aggression" in violation of the
international call for a withdrawal.</TE>
<TE>   The diplomat warned that there will be no progress on other fronts
until Israel pulls out its troops and tanks from all Palestinian areas.
"Nothing can get done without it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If Washington is unable to persuade Sharon, the Americans "can forget
about all else" in terms of Arab cooperation in pressuring Arafat,
attending a U.S.-orchestrated peace conference between Israel and the
Arab world or aiding in the wider war on terrorism, he added.</TE>
<TE>Deadlock Over Siege at Bethlehem Church</TE>
<TE>   What is getting in the way of a withdrawal is the deadlock over
Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity, the site that many Christians believe
is Jesus' birthplace, and over Arafat's besieged Ramallah headquarters.
Israel has indicated that it will pull out of other areas within a week
or less.</TE>
<TE>   But Israel charges that Palestinian militants responsible for the
assassination of an Israeli Cabinet minister, arms smuggling from Iran
and other acts have taken refuge in the facilities--and that it will not
lift the siege on either site until they are turned over.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is working on a compromise deal on the gunmen in the church,
which involves a choice of deportation or trial in Israel, according to
U.S. and Israeli officials. But tensions increased overnight after a
firefight that caused some damage at the church. Powell called the clash
"troubling."</TE>
<TE>   The harder problem is at Arafat's headquarters in Ramallah, where
Arafat ally Fuad Shubaki and at least four men suspected by Israel of
having a role in the October slaying of Tourism Minister Rehavam Zeevi
are holding out. Israelis have linked Shubaki to a scheme to ship Iranian
arms to the Palestinian territories.</TE>
<TE>Ramallah Standoff Is 'Most Difficult Problem'</TE>
<TE>   The Ramallah standoff "has become the most difficult problem with
respect to resolving this whole situation," Powell acknowledged at his
news conference.</TE>
<TE>   Under U.S. pressure, Arafat agreed to keep the wanted men under house
arrest at his headquarters, U.S. officials said. But Israel insists that
they must be turned over before it will lift the siege on Arafat and his
offices.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is trying to work out some kind of creative solution, perhaps
including having the men tried in a different venue. In the meantime, the
Powell team is pressing Israel to allow Arafat more freedom.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be useful for the chairman [Arafat] to have greater access,
greater ability to communicate with the people that we want him to
communicate with, in order to move down the right path and to exercise
control over the security forces that are available to them," Powell told
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   After his talks with Powell, Arafat assailed Israel for isolating him.
"I have to ask the whole world, I have to ask his excellency President
Bush, I have to ask the U.N., is this acceptable that I cannot go outside
from this door?"</TE>
<TE>   Israel countered that Arafat was responsible for any failure in
Powell's trip, because it had offered a timeline for withdrawal.
"Unfortunately, Yasser Arafat has not reciprocated, has not offered a
meaningful cease-fire. . . . Therefore, unfortunately, the cup is
half-empty, and it's half-empty because of Palestinian refusal," Sharon
advisor Dore Gold said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration tried to put a positive spin on the diplomatic
rescue mission. Powell said he plans to discuss the idea of an
international conference with Bush and U.S. allies after he returns to
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   And he announced that Norway will host an international donors
conference later this month to raise new funds to reconstruct devastated
West Bank towns and provide urgent humanitarian aid for the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Bush praised Powell on Wednesday for taking on "a difficult task. He
returns home having made progress toward peace."</TE>
<TE>   "We're confronting hatred that is centuries old, disputes that have
lingered for decades, but I want you to know, I will continue to lead
toward a vision of peace," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Powell said he will return to the region, as will other senior
administration officials, to try to keep the peace effort alive.</TE>
<TE>   But other U.S. officials were more sanguine about the results of
Powell's first effort. "There's not nothing that came out of it," said
one U.S. diplomat involved in the effort. "But there's not a lot."</TE>

<HD>Inca Mummies Discovered Under Lima Shantytown</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The emergency excavation of a 500-year-old cemetery under a Lima
shantytown has produced the largest trove of Inca mummies ever discovered
in Peru--a finding that already is changing established views of Inca
society.</LD>
<LD>   Archeologists have unearthed more than 2,200 remarkably well-preserved
mummies, some in bundles containing as many as seven individuals. The
find includes some 60,000 artifacts--including textiles, wooden
implements, pottery and burial gifts--that will provide a wealth of new
information about the short-lived Inca empire.</LD>
<LD>   The finding dwarfs previous discoveries in Peru, which have produced
only handfuls of mummies from any one site.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a fabulous find, in part because of the extraordinary
preservation of the mummy bundles and in part because it is such a large
sample," said archeologist Christopher P. Donnan of UCLA, who was not
involved in the excavation effort. "We really don't have anything
comparable to it."</TE>
<TE>   The sprawling 20-acre cemetery was a central burial site for the Inca
people from about AD 1480 to 1533, when Spanish fortune hunter Francisco
Pizarro and his troops--and cannons--destroyed the fledgling empire.</TE>
<TE>   The mummies and artifacts at the site, called Puruchuco-Huaquerones,
were in imminent danger because peasants who have fled to the shantytown
in recent years to escape guerrilla warfare in Peru's highlands are
dumping as much as 60,000 gallons of sewage and other liquids onto the
bone-dry soil every day. The moisture is destroying the buried bodies and
other organic materials that were preserved for five centuries by
desiccation and the arid climate.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had started five years from now, we would have found only
bones," said Peruvian archeologist Guillermo "Willy" Cock, who led the
excavations. Cock, 48, is a graduate student at UCLA and a research
associate at the school's Fowler Museum of Cultural History.</TE>
<TE>   As it is, the team was able to retrieve only a fraction of the mummies
buried at the site before running out of time and money. In the last
areas where they excavated, Cock said, the mummies were decomposing "with
worms and insects, as if they had died 45 days before, not 500 years
before. . . . It was not a pretty sight."</TE>
<TE>A Cross-Section of Inca Society</TE>
<TE>   The finds were revealed Wednesday in a news conference at the National
Geographic Society, which provided emergency funds to carry out the
excavation. The excavation will be featured in the May National
Geographic magazine and in a May 15 television special on PBS. Further
information is also available online at www.nationalgeographic.com/inca.</TE>
<TE>   The discovery is particularly valuable because it includes a
cross-section of Inca society, from crude peasant burials to the
elaborate mummies of the elite. And unlike elite mummies from most
previous excavations, these have not been pillaged by looters.</TE>
<TE>   As the findings are cataloged and studied, "we are going to rewrite
Inca history," Cock said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the press of excavation, the team so far has opened only
three of the mummy bundles. But already, the finds "are telling some
amazing stories," Cock said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the pottery from the burials, for example, comes from hundreds
of miles to the north and south of Lima, indicating that the Inca empire
was more highly integrated than researchers had previously believed.</TE>
<TE>   "We always thought that they were in a structure imposed over local
ethnic groups [by the ruling Inca] and that the people in general were
not integrating Inca culture into their everyday lives," Cock said.</TE>
<TE>   "What we have found is evidence of the opposite. The common people
were becoming a part of the Inca society, rather than being kept
marginal, as was assumed.</TE>
<TE>   "Ethnic differences were disappearing, perhaps for the first time," he
added. "In modern terms, they were developing a sense of nation."</TE>
<TE>   But the intrusion of the Spanish cut that effort short, Cock added.
"There was not enough time to integrate the entire country."</TE>
<TE>   Individual skeletons disturbed by looters or by construction are also
being studied.</TE>
<TE>   "That's already shedding light on the diet and general health
conditions of the population," Donnan said. "There's clear evidence of
malnutrition among some of the children."</TE>
<TE>   Researchers do not yet understand what led to the malnutrition or what
it implies about Inca society.</TE>
<TE>   Cock's team was able to excavate only in the streets of the shantytown
and in other open spaces, such as the local schoolyard. The team needed
to build bridges over the trenched streets so that peasants could cross
in front of their homes. Many of the locals were hired to work on the
project.</TE>
<TE>   Cock estimates that the team was able to extract only about 20% of the
mummies in the cemetery. The rest are under houses and other structures
and are rapidly being destroyed by the influx of water.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining mummies cannot be recovered, Cock said at the news
conference. The researchers have exhausted their financial resources, and
the 1,240 families of the shantytown have secured permission to remain on
the site.</TE>
<TE>   "Having to walk away is frustrating," he said. "What's left may have
been a huge contribution to knowledge of the Inca."</TE>
<TE>   But what was removed will also have a massive impact, said other
experts.</TE>
<TE>   "What's most important is the tremendous size of the collection, 2,200
bodies," said archeologist John W. Verano of Tulane University, who, like
Donnan, was not involved in the rescue effort. "For an archeological site
in South America, that is a huge sample.</TE>
<TE>   "That's significant because you can say so much more if you have a
large representative sample of the burial population. You can talk about
mortality patterns, life expectancy, burial practices, health, disease,
causes of death, etc."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the mummy bundles weigh hundreds of pounds and hold as many as
seven individuals, along with their possessions.</TE>
<TE>   The simplest bundles have wrappings of elaborate textiles around an
individual and his possessions. In others, the individual mummies are
separated from each other with stuffing, then the entire bundle is
enclosed in textiles and often, on top of that, an elaborate net made of
rope.</TE>
<TE>'Cotton King' Was Buried With Infant</TE>
<TE>   One bundle, christened the Cotton King, was made up of 300 pounds of
raw cotton. Inside was the body of an Inca noble and a baby, probably
related. They were accompanied by 70 items, including food, pottery,
animal skins and corn to make a fermented drink called chicha.</TE>
<TE>   Forty of the bundles are so-called falsas cabezas or "false heads,"
having a cotton-filled protuberance on top to mimic a head. Some are
adorned with a metal mask or a wig made of vegetable fibers and dyed
black.</TE>
<TE>   The falsas cabezas contain several individuals: one of them the
principal person and the others presumably accompanying him in the
afterlife. The bodies of the adults are in the fetal position, the
classic Inca burial posture, with their possessions arranged around them.</TE>
<TE>   There is no evidence indicating whether the accompanying individuals
are servants or relatives, Cock said, and no suggestion that they were
killed when the principal died. Apparently, bodies were kept until the
entire group was dead, at which time they were buried.</TE>
<TE>   The mummy bundles, said archeologist Johan Reinhard of the Mountain
Institute, a National Geographic explorer-in-residence, "are like time
capsules from the Inca."</TE>

<HD>Hospital 'Angel of Death' Gets Life Without Parole</HD>
<DH>* Crime: After sentencing in six murders, therapist's confession to
more than 100 killings is unsealed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL LIEBERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Asking for forgiveness, self-described "Angel of Death" Efren
Saldivar was sentenced to life in prison without parole Wednesday, even
as a judge unsealed a second confession in which the defendant said he
killed considerably more than 100 Glendale hospital patients with
injections of paralyzing drugs, more than twice the number he had
admitted to previously.</LD>
<LD>   In the Jan. 9, 2001, confession, the 32-year-old Saldivar also said
that he killed for a "shameful" and "flippant" reason--to reduce his
workload.</LD>
<LD>   "Oh, God, you can't believe how flippant. It was not for personal
pleasure. It was not a rush," the former Glendale Adventist Medical
Center respiratory therapist told two members of a police task force.</LD>
<TE>   "We had too much work," Saldivar said. "When I was only at my wits'
end on the staffing, I'd look at the [patient] board. 'Who do we gotta
get rid of? . . . OK, who's in bad shape here?' "</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar, who pleaded guilty March 12 to six counts of murder and one
of attempted murder under a plea bargain that spared him the death
penalty, also told police that he killed patients at two other hospitals
where he moonlighted. He also said he "introduced" two other respiratory
therapists to killing.</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar made the statements just after his arrest on suspicion of
murder. He also had confessed in 1998, but said then that he killed no
more than 50 patients, and only at Glendale Adventist.</TE>
<TE>   The second confession was among hundreds of pages of records unsealed
by Superior Court Judge Lance Ito after an emotional sentencing at which
Saldivar's one known surviving victim said he should have received the
death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a survivor. . . . I'm very lucky," said Jean Coyle, 64, who was
revived after a "code blue" emergency in February 1997 and now lives in a
nursing home. She addressed the court haltingly, breathing with the help
of a tracheotomy tube, while Saldivar sat at the defense table, his head
bowed.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if he thought he was God or what. It wasn't right,"
Coyle said. "I think that he should die."</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, Saldivar spoke as Coyle and relatives of several other
victims listened from the back of the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   "I am deeply ashamed by the fear, frustration and the pain that these
and other families have had to endure. I know there's nothing I can say
to soothe their anger," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "However I want to say that I am sorry. I am truly sorry. And I ask
for forgiveness, though I don't expect any."</TE>
<TE>Comparing Killing to Shoplifting Gum</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar, who lived in Tujunga, was taken into custody after his first
confession in 1998, but freed two days later when prosecutors said they
needed independent evidence to corroborate his admissions. Saldivar then
recanted that confession, saying he fabricated the story of killing
because he was pressured by a detective and was so depressed that he
wanted to die.</TE>
<TE>   To determine whether he had killed anyone, the police task force
exhumed 20 bodies, chosen from among 1,050 patients who died at Glendale
Adventist while Saldivar was on duty or within an hour of his shifts.
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory found traces of Pavulon--which
stops natural breathing while doctors insert tubes down patients'
throats--in six of the 20.</TE>
<TE>   In his first confession, Saldivar insisted that he injected lethal
drugs in patients' intravenous lines to end the suffering of terminally
ill people. Last year, however, he spoke of having too much work and
compared killing to shoplifting a pack of gum.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't plan it. After that moment, you don't think about it for
the rest of the day, or ever," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar was employed at Glendale Adventist from 1989 until March
1998, when a phone tip prompted the hospital to call in the police. In
his second confession, he indicated that he began giving lethal
injections early in his career, and got away with it for years.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost count after 60. And that was back in '94," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He estimated that he killed as many as 40 patients in each of the
following two years, 1995 and 1996. He then "slowed down" in 1997, his
last full year at Glendale Adventist, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking hundreds of people," Sgt. John McKillop said.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's over a hundred," Saldivar replied, according to a
transcript of the confession, which was first filed in court by police as
part of a search warrant application.</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar's estimate, if accurate, would establish him as one of the
most deadly serial killers in American history, and among the most deadly
hospital killers on record.</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar's lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Verah Bradford, said after
the sentencing that many of his comments to police were "exaggeration"
and "hyperbolic." Saldivar is "a very warm, caring and good-hearted man,"
she said, but also self-destructive.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think it's a kind of unfortunate flip exaggeration that Efren
might be subject to," Bradford said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite what one official characterized as the "chilling" statements
in his second confession, both Glendale police and county prosecutors
have said that they will not seek to tie more deaths to Saldivar, or to
determine his actual toll. Killings early in his career--or at the other
hospitals--would be difficult to document after all these years, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It will always be a mystery as to how many people died at the hands
of Mr. Saldivar," Deputy Dist. Atty. Al MacKenzie said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor said Saldivar's motive might remain a mystery as well,
after his varying statements over the years.</TE>
<TE>   "This crime is so abnormal . . . you can't attribute one motive to Mr.
Saldivar," MacKenzie said, pointing to the grand jury testimony of a
Verdugo Hills High School classmate of Saldivar's, Cindy Barnard.</TE>
<TE>   Even before he became a respiratory therapist, Barnard said, Saldivar
spoke of wanting to "put people out of their misery."</TE>
<TE>   Barnard told the grand jury that Saldivar said he was thinking of
getting into the medical field "to help, like, older people that were
basically dying. . . . He had told me that . . . his faith believes that
God doesn't like seeing people suffer."</TE>
<TE>   In Saldivar's first confession, he spoke vaguely of contributing to
deaths at hospitals where he moonlighted by neglecting to offer medical
help patients needed, such as by providing "not the greatest CPR." He
said he gave lethal injections only at Glendale Adventist.</TE>
<TE>Confessed to Killings at Other Hospitals</TE>
<TE>   In the second confession, though, Saldivar volunteered that his
killing "wasn't just at Glendale [Adventist]," and named two other
hospitals: Methodist Hospital of Southern California in Arcadia, where he
worked part time from 1991 to 1993; and Glendale Memorial, where he
moonlighted from 1991 to 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how many patients he killed, Saldivar said, "over at Memorial,
maybe 10."</TE>
<TE>   He said he was less active at the Arcadia hospital, "maybe two or
three . . . less than five," according to the transcript of the
confession.</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar said he also obtained vials of Pavulon at Glendale Memorial.
"They just kept the packs of 10 over there in the fridge," he said.</TE>
<TE>   McKillop, who headed the task force, said police alerted both
hospitals of Saldivar's statements, but did not think it was feasible to
expand the investigation because the patients' bodies were "just too long
in the ground."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Methodist Hospital said last year that "there was no
evidence that anything had transpired." Glendale Memorial said in a
statement Wednesday that "an exhaustive internal investigation" found no
link between Saldivar and "any patient fatalities," or any breach of
security practices for handling drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Glendale Adventist said Wednesday that "the search for the truth in
this matter has been difficult for the families and medical center staff.
. . . We are relieved that this process is at an end."</TE>
<TE>   As he did in his first confession, Saldivar also told investigators
that he was not the only respiratory therapist to kill at Glendale
Adventist. He said two male co-workers followed his lead.</TE>
<TE>   "They knew what I was doing," Saldivar said. "They wanted to try it. .
. . I helped with the first couple by being the lookout. . . . After
that, they're on their own."</TE>
<TE>   The number of patients killed by the pair "had to be less than six,"
he said, and they never discussed the incidents later.</TE>
<TE>   The two men Saldivar named were among four respiratory therapists
fired by Glendale Adventist after his 1998 confession, apparently for
failing to disclose their suspicious about him. Both were given limited
immunity during the investigation of Saldivar, meaning anything they said
could not be used against them in a criminal case. But even with
immunity, neither admitted killing patients and they provided little
testimony that was useful to the task force, according to transcripts of
their statements filed in court last year.</TE>
<TE>   During a grand jury appearance last October, another of the four,
Ursula Anderson--whom Saldivar did not accuse of killing
patients--described finding a vial of one paralyzing drug,
succinylcholine chloride, on a windowsill and giving it to him. "He had
asked me to get him some," said Anderson, who often worked the overnight
shift with Saldivar.</TE>
<TE>   She also recalled seeing him inject a drug into a patient's
intravenous line, though she didn't know if the patient died.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you report Mr. Saldivar to anyone at Glendale Adventist Medical
Center?" she was asked.</TE>
<TE>   "No, I didn't," she said. Asked why she didn't report the incident,
she said, "I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   All four of the fired therapists still have their state licenses. The
head of the California Respiratory Care Board said recently that the
agency had monitored all four in any jobs they have held since they left
Glendale Adventist, but did not pursue potential disciplinary cases
against them to avoid jeopardizing the prosecution of Saldivar.</TE>
<TE>   With his criminal proceedings completed, "we're going to be expediting
it," Stephanie Nunez, the board's executive officer, said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Though Saldivar's name may now be included on lists of leading serial
killers, Judge Ito indicated Wednesday that the hospital worker came
close to never having criminal charges filed against him.</TE>
<TE>Judge Praises Prosecutors' Tenacity</TE>
<TE>   Ito praised the "tenacity" of the current prosecutors for bringing the
case to a conclusion "when others thought it was a lost cause years ago.
. . . This case was moribund for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Ito told the lawyers in the case last month that their plea bargain
had avoided a potentially "difficult" trial.</TE>
<TE>   Had the case gone to trial, public defender Bradford was expected to
challenge the legitimacy of Saldivar's confessions, both given without a
lawyer present. In addition, while Saldivar spoke in general terms about
killing scores of patients, he offered no patient names or dates, even
after he was shown the medical charts and photos of the people he was
suspected of murdering.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plea deal, Ito sentenced Saldivar to six life terms without
parole for the murder counts and 15 years to life for the attempted
murder of Coyle. "This, above all, was a very human tragedy," the judge
said. "I think nothing more needs to be said."</TE>

<HD>City Council Denies Parks' Final Appeal</HD>

<LD>With a swift vote, the Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday put an
end to Chief Bernard C. Parks' bid for a second term as head of the Los
Angeles Police Department and brought to a close a tumultuous chapter of
city politics that pitted Mayor James K. Hahn against his own chief.</LD>
<LD>   The council, voting 11 to 3, refused to overturn the Police
Commission's decision to deny Parks a second five-year term--an action
that effectively ends the chief's 37-year career in the Los Angeles
Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   In a phone interview, Parks said he was disappointed with the
council's decision, but not surprised.</LD>
<TE>   "The people who sit around the horseshoe do what they do all the time:
They play inside politics," said Parks, referring to the U-shaped desk
where council members conduct their meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Parks, who has accused the city's leadership of orchestrating a
conspiracy to oust him, said he is considering all of his options,
including whether to file a lawsuit, a step Councilman Nate Holden urged
him to take.</TE>
<TE>   "It's disappointing when you've offered so much and you've grown up in
a department in which merits are important, and then find out that those
merits get redefined and then actually ignored," Parks said.</TE>
<TE>   The chief appeared before the council Tuesday to make an impassioned
hourlong speech defending his record, but the majority of the city
lawmakers were unswayed. They maintained that the department needs fresh
leadership, and rejected Parks' claim that he was a victim of a
conspiracy by the mayor and the police union that culminated in last
week's vote by the Police Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Only the council's three African American members--Holden, Mark
Ridley-Thomas and Jan Perry--supported Parks' bid for a second term.
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter was in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   "Chief Bernard Parks has served the men, women and children of this
city honorably, capably and extraordinarily for the past 37 years,"
Councilman Jack Weiss said. "This city ought to congratulate and commend
Chief Bernard Parks for his extraordinary service, but at the same time
it is proper for the city's policymakers and for the public to say that
it's time for a change."</TE>
<TE>   Moments after the vote, Hahn held a news conference, telling reporters
he was pleased with the outcome and believes the process had been a fair
one.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's time for all of us to move forward," the mayor said. "I
would encourage the chief to move forward with his life. I think that the
city needs to move forward. We need to look toward the future about how
we make Los Angeles a safer city."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn dismissed the chief's allegations that he and the Police
Commission had moved against Parks to reward the police union for
supporting Hahn in last year's mayoral campaign. Parks complained that
the process for evaluating his application for a second term was unfair.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly would remind the chief that he said throughout this
process that he believed he was given a full and fair evaluation," Hahn
said. "Only when the result became apparent to him has he suddenly
challenged the fairness of the process."</TE>
<TE>   Parks also blamed politicians for making decisions that took officers
off the street. At one point he suggested that flawed political
initiatives--such as the compressed work schedule for police officers
championed by Hahn--had contributed to a spike in crime, costing lives.</TE>
<TE>   He further accused Hahn of lining up votes against him on the Police
Commission and the City Council.</TE>
<TE>Mayor Denies Lobbying for Votes Against Chief</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Hahn called Parks' allegations "flat-out wrong."</TE>
<TE>   "I did not line up votes, lobby people," the mayor said. "I told him
in my political judgment where the support was. . . . He's twisted that."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said it was up to Parks to decide whether he should resign
before his term expires Aug. 12. Hahn also said that he did not believe
the chief should file a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "I think lawsuits and lawyers are not the way to make the city safer,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Parks' lawyer Gloria Allred said the chief is considering all of his
options, including litigation. On Wednesday morning, before the council
voted, she sent a letter to the city attorney's office detailing laws
that may have been broken during the evaluation process, Allred said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think as a result of the City Council action, Los Angeles is going
to lose the best police chief the city has ever had," Allred said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think personally that his rights have been violated and that he has
been deprived of due process," she added, but declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   The five-member Police Commission decided not to grant Parks a second
term after interviewing him for nine hours in a closed-door session. The
panel cited a variety of reasons, including an increase in crime, low
officer morale and problems with recruiting and retaining officers.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, a friend of the chief's, said he
hopes Parks does not pursue legal action.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it would be in his best interests or the city's best
interests," Yaroslavsky said. "He's had a great career. He's walking away
with a lot of accomplishments."</TE>
<TE>   Parks said that no matter what happens, he plans to stay in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to be here and certainly look at ways I can continue on
public issues, volunteerism and other items," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Late Wednesday evening, Parks' office released a statement saying,
"The process for transition in the office of chief of police will be
orderly and professional."</TE>
<TE>   The statement did not indicate if Parks intends to serve the rest of
his term.</TE>
<TE>Panel, Hahn Turn to Replacement Question</TE>
<TE>   The question of who will replace Parks now goes to the Police
Commission, which is scheduled to begin laying out the search process at
its meeting next Tuesday. Hahn said he would like a high level of
community input during the process, and repeated that he does not have
any short list of preferred candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "The next police chief must have a demonstrated commitment to reform,
which I believe is the foundation of building trust with the community,"
Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   After the vote, Councilwoman Perry said she felt "embarrassed" for the
city.</TE>
<TE>   "The man was clearly qualified," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Holden said he thought Parks was denied a fair evaluation, and added
that the chief should sue over the matter.</TE>
<TE>   "I would respectfully request that the chief file a lawsuit for the
purpose of having this matter aired in public, as it should have been,"
he told reporters. "The public has a right to know. Closed-door decisions
should not stand in this city any more."</TE>
<TE>   Other officials criticized Holden for suggesting that someone pursue
litigation against the city.</TE>
<TE>   "The city gets sued enough, and to recommend that someone file a
lawsuit, I think is irresponsible," said Councilman Dennis Zine, who said
Parks is not entitled to get a second five-year term, and so there are no
issues of due process to consider.</TE>
<TE>   "This vote today, 11 to 3, clearly reflects the fact that Chief Parks
was not able to muster support with the mayor, with the Police
Commission, with the rank and file of the LAPD and with the City
Council," said Zine, a former LAPD officer and union official.</TE>
<TE>   "What we need for this city is a Police Department that can be
effective in policing the city of Los Angeles, all areas of the city of
Los Angeles," he added. "We are miserably failing in that mission at this
time."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Cannot Block Oregon Suicide Law, Judge Rules</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM MURPHY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.
</DL>
<LD>A federal judge ruled Wednesday that Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft
overstepped his authority in attempting to sanction doctors who prescribe
lethal drugs under Oregon's landmark assisted-suicide law.</LD>
<LD>   In an opinion that upheld the state's case on every point, U.S.
District Judge Robert Jones issued a permanent injunction shielding the
statute and said Congress never intended the attorney general to decide
what constitutes "legitimate medical practice" in individual states.</LD>
<LD>   "To allow an attorney general--an appointed executive whose tenure
depends entirely on whatever administration occupies the White House--to
determine the legitimacy of a particular medical practice . . . would be
unprecedented and extraordinary," the judge wrote.</LD>
<TE>   Jones went a step further, accusing congressional opponents of going
to the Bush administration for help when they failed to win support in
Congress for a ban on physician-assisted suicide. "Certain congressional
leaders made a good-faith effort to get through the administrative door
what they could not get through the congressional door, seeking refuge
with the newly appointed attorney general, whose ideology matched their
views, and this is precisely what occurred."</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft's Nov. 6 directive, which found doctors who prescribe drugs
to hasten the death of terminally ill patients in violation of the
federal Controlled Substances Act, "is not entitled to deference under
any standard, and is invalid," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that opposition to assisted suicide may be fully
justified--morally, ethically, religiously or otherwise--does not permit
a federal statute to be manipulated from its true meaning to satisfy even
a worthy goal."</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department stood behind its decision, saying it is
convinced that a ban on the use of federally controlled drugs to assist
in suicides is the "correct" policy. Although the department said it is
still reviewing the decision, sources familiar with the case said a
decision to appeal already has been made.</TE>
<TE>   "A just and caring society should do its best to assist in coping with
the problems that afflict the terminally ill. It should not abandon or
assist in killing them," Assistant Atty. Gen. Robert McCallum said in a
statement Wednesday. "Doctors should not use controlled substances to
assist suicide. Instead, they should be encouraged to use them for pain
control, which is one of the most important positive alternatives to
suicide."</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft said, "We'll make decisions about what our response is when
we have an opportunity to digest the opinion."</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of the Oregon law said the ruling is so narrow that it
almost certainly will withstand an appeal. It never addressed questions
of whether there is a constitutional right to assisted suicide but
instead focused squarely on whether the federal law that regulates drug
abuse can be applied to the assisted-suicide statute.</TE>
<TE>   Under Ashcroft's directive, doctors who prescribed fatal doses for
their patients stood to have their licenses revoked, based on the
attorney general's finding that assisted suicide does not fall within the
scope of "legitimate medical practice" covered in the statute for
federally registered drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "The ruling today respects and secures the right of dying Oregonians
to make their own decisions," said Estelle Rogers, executive director of
the Death With Dignity National Center, which has been a strong proponent
of the Oregon law. "Secondly, today's ruling also protects the ability of
physicians nationwide to provide adequate and appropriate pain care to
their terminally ill patients, without fear that the [Drug Enforcement
Administration] will second-guess their intent and punish them."</TE>
<TE>   It was on that issue that the California Medical Assn. filed a
friend-of-the-court brief, and CMA President John Whitelaw, a Sacramento
physician, applauded the court's ruling. "While CMA does not support
physician-assisted suicide, we feel that this directive by Atty. Gen.
John Ashcroft would grossly interfere in the doctor-patient relationship
and would unnecessarily interfere with patients' ability to receive
adequate pain relief during end-of-life care," Whitelaw said.</TE>
<TE>   But opponents said the ruling blocked the federal government's
legitimate attempt to prevent abuses in the care of the terminally ill.
They have expressed fears that assisted suicide will be used by patients
who are depressed or who have become a burden to their families.</TE>
<TE>   "The opponents of physician-assisted suicide continue to be concerned
that this right to die, no matter how well intentioned or well conceived,
will over time become the duty to die," said Portland lawyer Kelly Clark,
representing Oregon Right to Life. "And as time goes on, that duty will
disproportionately fall on the poor and the dispossessed, and my clients
are not going to stand by and see that kind of cultural and social
suicide without trying to stop it."</TE>
<TE>   National Right to Life Committee attorney James Bopp Jr. said the U.S.
Supreme Court, rejecting parts of California's medical marijuana
initiative last year, already has said that states do not have authority
over what constitutes legitimate medical uses of federally controlled
drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "If using marijuana for glaucoma is not permitted by the Supreme
Court, under the pretext of medical care, I just don't see how killing
patients can be justified," Bopp said.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon's assisted-suicide law took effect in 1997 in response to a
state ballot initiative. Through 2001, 141 prescriptions were issued,
resulting in 91 physician-assisted deaths. Many others died without using
their prescriptions.</TE>
<TE>   Nine patients still have prescriptions for assisted suicide but have
not taken the drugs, according to George Eighmey, executive director of
Compassion in Dying of Oregon, which helps patients seeking to use the
law. About a dozen others sought prescriptions but had not obtained them,
perhaps in some cases because Ashcroft's directive left doctors
uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   "I was devastated by Ashcroft's ruling five months ago. Today, I feel
liberated again," said Jim Romney, 57, a former high school principal and
superintendent who has been diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Holmes, a 72-year-old retired salesman who is dying of cancer,
already has a lethal prescription. "If I get in a lot of pain and
suffering, I may use the medication. I may not. I don't know whether I'm
brave enough to do it, but if I am brave enough, I've got the right."</TE>

<HD>Hearing the Last of Lost Lives</HD>
<DH>The U.S. is allowing the families of Flight 93's victims to hear
cockpit voice tapes. Investigators who harden themselves to bitter
reality will share their inner sanctum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Until today, the U.S. government had never played the cockpit tapes
of an air disaster for families who lost loved ones, insisting that the
sounds would be too raw.</LD>
<LD>   Now, families of the 40 passengers and crew of United Flight 93 will
hear the 30 minutes of tension and chaos that preceded the crash of the
jetliner into a Pennsylvania field Sept. 11. They felt they had a right
to listen, to know. Their relatives apparently tried to take back control
of the plane from four hijackers, and thereby thwarted another terrorist
attack.</LD>
<LD>   As they listen, the families will enter a zone normally inhabited only
by a small corps of investigators hardened to bitter reality. Like
coroners with headphones, the investigators seek to uncover the hidden
causes of tragedies through painstaking analysis of the most minute
clues.</LD>
<TE>   They work from a National Transportation Safety Board laboratory in
Washington that is stacked with mangled recorders, reminders of life's
fragility. The listening room itself is spartan. There is a table and
chairs, with headphones at each seat. At the end of the table sits a
large computer monitor, so everyone can see as an NTSB technician
transcribes what is heard on the tape.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators regard this room as the agency's inner sanctum, a
workplace in which they witness struggles that reveal both the harsh
finality of death and the power of the human will to live.</TE>
<TE>   "You are really very close to the soul," said Malcolm Brenner, an NTSB
psychologist who specializes in voice analysis. "Speech is very close to
how a person thinks."</TE>
<TE>   Brenner believes he has gotten to know some pilots as one would a
friend by repeatedly listening to snatches of the last half-hour of their
lives to figure out how they died.</TE>
<TE>   He listened hundreds of times over four years to the cockpit tapes of
USAir Flight 427, which went down near Pittsburgh in 1994, killing all
132 aboard.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, he was able to match a series of grunting sounds by the
co-pilot with data replicating a malfunction of the Boeing 737's rudder.
The co-pilot was grunting as he fought to overcome an unexpected,
catastrophic turn in what would otherwise have been a routine landing.
Brenner's work helped bring about a redesign of the rudder system on the
airliner, the world's most popular.</TE>
<TE>   When the Federal Aviation Administration first required voice
recorders in the mid-1960s, investigators could do little more than try
to make out the conversation. Now some tapes are studio quality, Brenner
said.</TE>
<TE>   Computer analysis allows measurement of the level of stress in a
pilot's voice. Specific scientific criteria have been developed to
identify panic in a human voice. The panic response has never been heard
with pilots undergoing training in a simulator, Brenner said, only in an
actual crash.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators correlate the words and exclamations of pilots with
information on controls and flight conditions from the plane's second
"black box," the flight data recorder. Clicks, thumps, vibrations and
other mechanical noises can also be of significance, and the NTSB
maintains a sound library to help identify them. Both recorders were
recovered from the Flight 93 crash.</TE>
<TE>   The cockpit tapes often reveal the best of people under the worst of
circumstances, investigators say.</TE>
<TE>   The cockpit recorder of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 showed that the
pilots kept struggling to regain control of the plane even after its
horizontal stabilizer broke away. It plunged upside-down into the Pacific
Ocean off Ventura County on Jan. 31, 2000, killing all 88 aboard.</TE>
<TE>   In the heroism of Flight 93's passengers, veteran investigators see
the same kind of resolve.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a problem and you try to solve it without any foreknowledge
of how much time you have to live," said Douglas Wiegmann, a professor of
aviation human factors at the University of Illinois and a former NTSB
psychologist. "I believe these passengers thought they could take control
and land the plane. They weren't trying to find another way to die; they
were trying to save the situation."</TE>
<TE>   "The passengers who took action were of the same mind-set as the
people who fly airplanes," agreed Paul McCarthy, an airline captain who
represents the pilots' union in investigations. That mind-set? "Pilots
are survivors," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, there comes a moment of dread on cockpit tapes. An
exclamation, an invocation, a lament, a curse. Then voices cease and an
awful silence reigns.</TE>
<TE>   "The most chilling part is when it ends," said David F. Thomas, a
former chief investigator for the FAA. "All of a sudden there's silence,
and you know it's over."</TE>
<TE>   The families of Flight 93 have been told what to expect. "The content
is violent and very distressing," said an FBI memo to the families. "Once
the [recording] is heard, it may be impossible to forget the sounds and
images it evokes."</TE>
<TE>   Alice Hoglan, whose son Mark Bingham is believed to have been one of
the rebel passengers, said at least one family has been advised by the
FBI not to attend, presumably because the violence done to their relative
is so distinct.</TE>
<TE>   The recording reportedly opens with the voice of a person pleading for
mercy, Hoglan said. There is aircraft noise. There is a commotion. The
hijackers apparently try to maneuver the plane to disrupt an assault by
passengers on the cockpit.</TE>
<TE>   Air safety investigators are divided over whether the families of
Flight 93 should listen to the tape.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a logical request," Wiegmann said. "Most of the surviving family
members remember the voice of their deceased loved one. Some of [the
passengers] may have charged the cockpit. Listening to it will help the
family members better understand what caused the death of the person they
are mourning, rather than getting secondhand information about what is
supposedly on that tape."</TE>
<TE>   It's not about logic, responded Greg Feith, a former NTSB air crash
investigator. "I would tell them, 'You don't want to hear this, because
you may hear something that may haunt you the rest of your life.' "</TE>
<TE>   Jack Grandcolas agrees. His wife, Lauren, called him from the hijacked
plane that morning and left a message of comfort and encouragement on
their answering machine. Then she gave her phone to another passenger, an
anguished young woman who was able to reach her family.</TE>
<TE>   "She was an incredible woman, helping others to be strong," Grandcolas
said. "That is the thing I would rather focus on. I have no desire to
pursue hearing" the cockpit tape.</TE>
<TE>   But Lauren's younger sister Vaughn Lohec feels a duty to learn
everything she can about the events on the plane. She plans to listen to
the tape, if she can get up the nerve.</TE>
<TE>   "Even within our family network, we have differences of opinion,"
Lohec said. "I just don't know if I can go through the rest of my life
without listening."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI and Justice Department decision to allow the families to
listen came after a campaign by Deena Burnett. Her husband, Tom, a Bay
Area businessman, was on the flight from Newark, N.J., to San Francisco
and is believed to have been one of the leaders of the passenger revolt.</TE>
<TE>   Another reason for holding a listening session is that authorities are
considering playing the tape in court. Hoglan said FBI officials have
told the families the tape will be evidence in the trial of Zacarias
Moussaoui, who is suspected of having been a missing member of the Flight
93 hijacking team.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials and federal prosecutors declined to comment. NTSB
experts also declined to answer any questions about the technical support
they have provided in the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   If the tape is eventually played in court, the types of voice and
sound analysis now possible will increase jurors' understanding of what
happened.</TE>
<TE>   Noise that may seem like pandemonium can be stopped, slowed down and
correlated with movements of the aircraft. Every sound is a potential
clue.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800 off Long Island, in which 230
people died, the cockpit tape showed the pilots were unaware of any
problems before the catastrophe. "It was a perfect, do-it-every-day
flight," said James Cash, the NTSB's chief technical advisor on
transportation recorders.</TE>
<TE>   An abnormal noise registered on the last 120 milliseconds of the tape,
a sound like a crash, or maybe an explosion. Was it a bomb? A missile
strike? Cash spent three years analyzing the sound "signature" of the
noise. He blew up part of a scrapped Boeing 747, recording that sound for
comparison.</TE>
<TE>   His findings supported the conclusion that a mechanical defect ignited
fuel vapors in the plane's center tank. The 120-millisecond noise was
really a compressed stream of sound: the fuel tank rupture, the
structural failure of the aircraft, the ripping of wires and the loss of
power to the recorder.</TE>
<TE>   "High explosives develop quickly and don't last very long," Cash said.
"A fuel-air explosion like this takes a little longer to develop."</TE>
<TE>   When EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed off New England in 1999, killing 217,
cockpit tapes caught the co-pilot, alone in the cockpit, reciting a
prayer in Arabic as he put the plane into a dive. That was strange
enough. But even more startling to Bernard Loeb, then chief of the NTSB's
aviation safety office, was what happened after the plane's captain
managed to scramble back.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately, the captain began to trouble-shoot the problem--the
classic response of a pilot who encounters an unexpected crisis. The
co-pilot kept intoning his prayer.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't say, 'There's something wrong. . . . I can't pull the nose
up,' " Loeb said. "That's what anybody who was in the situation would
say." The flight data recorder showed that the co-pilot then shut off the
engines. The captain pulled back on his control yoke to bring the nose
up; the co-pilot pushed forward on his.</TE>
<TE>   Analysis of the Flight 93 tape should be able show who was at the
controls and whether the passengers were indeed able to get into the
cockpit.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of the tape eventually being played in court is raising
concerns among family members and pilots' organizations that an audio
version might become public and even be posted on the Internet. In an
NTSB air crash investigation, the audio recordings are protected from
release by federal law, although edited transcripts are eventually made
public.</TE>
<TE>   "It's basically a violent murder, and that's an impression I would
prefer not to leave in my mind," Grandcolas said. "I'm sure eventually it
will be in the public domain, but I don't know if I'd be able to deal
with it."</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy, the airline captain who also serves as an accident
investigator, said pilots will do everything possible to block widespread
release of the tape. Pilots' groups are considering asking the judge to
close the courtroom if the tape is played.</TE>
<TE>   "Congress intended for cockpit voice recordings to simply never be
played for the public," McCarthy said. "We are going to petition if the
prosecution decides to use it in this case. It's not a matter of
balancing competing rights. If you're going to compel me to record my
voice, you owe me the common decency of keeping it private."</TE>

<HD>Troubled Cable Mogul Is Still a Hometown Hero</HD>
<DH>Media: Federal probe or no, loyalty to Adelphia founder John Rigas
runs deep in Coudersport.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>COUDERSPORT, Pa.
</DL>
<LD>The owner of one of the most popular diners in town sent the first
flower arrangements to John Rigas' office. Her neighbors followed with
daisies and potted plants, sent from all over this wooded hamlet,
population 3,000.</LD>
<LD>   Their messages offered love, support and prayers to the cable TV
magnate whose company, Adelphia Communications Corp., faces a federal
investigation and 18 shareholder lawsuits alleging securities fraud.</LD>
<LD>   But in contrast to Houston, where protesters marched on Enron Corp.'s
headquarters after the energy company collapsed, in this small western
Pennsylvania town Rigas remains a hero, if not a saint, because of
decades of good deeds.</LD>
<TE>   Only three weeks ago Adelphia disclosed some questionable, Enron-like
accounting practices. Wall Street swiftly wiped out almost two-thirds of
Adelphia's stock value. Yet as Adelphia scrambles to survive by selling
off cable franchises, including some in Los Angeles, residents here are
rallying around Rigas, the slight, stooped 77-year-old cable pioneer.</TE>
<TE>   "He's our Greek god," said Shirlee Leete, a council member, antiques
shop owner and local journalist who since 1968 has written about the
folksy, white-haired son of Greek immigrants. "People here feel a certain
element of fear about the future and what might happen, but mostly they
feel trust."</TE>
<TE>   Like hundreds of other locals, Leete lost money investing in Adelphia
and an affiliated fiber-optic phone company that filed for bankruptcy
protection last month.</TE>
<TE>   But over coffee at Kaye's Hometown Restaurant on Main Street, Leete
fought back tears as she thought of the pressure Rigas faces. "I lost
thousands of dollars in [his companies], but I have faith it will all be
fine because of John," Leete said. "Integrity is his middle name." She
even started a "prayer chain" for Rigas at local churches.</TE>
<TE>   Loyalties run deep in this town with two stoplights and only one
taxicab, where waitresses know customers by their first names and Boy
Scouts collect syrup from maple trees near Main Street.</TE>
<TE>   It's not only that Rigas provides 2,400 jobs, keeping the region from
becoming an economic sinkhole. He's also a mythical caretaker, who sends
Adelphia crews onto the streets to plow driveways in the harsh winters
and to do landscaping work in the spring. He gives jobs to those who ask
and routinely lends money to families in need, never expecting to be paid
back.</TE>
<TE>   Rigas' wealth soared in the late '90s when Adelphia had a dizzying
run-up, its stock jumping seventeenfold. On paper he was a billionaire.
Bankers were eager to lend him money during a frenzied consolidation that
sent cable values flying.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Rigas bought Century Communications Corp., Los Angeles'
largest cable provider. The deal doubled Adelphia's size and took it far
afield of its small and mid-size cable markets.</TE>
<TE>   Now shareholders accuse the Rigases of misleading them by secretly
securing loans for as much as $3 billion, guaranteed by Adelphia, through
family partnerships. The family apparently used the money to buy stocks
and bonds in Adelphia, gaining control of the nation's sixth-largest
cable provider.</TE>
<TE>   But locals say that if bad things happened, it was the fault of
big-city lenders that permitted Adelphia and the Rigases to over-borrow.
Or they blame Rigas' sons, with their Ivy League degrees and oversized
ambitions, who expanded the company too big too fast.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe the boys tried too hard to prove themselves to Dad," said Chris
Schmoyer, owner of Jack's Steak &amp; Seafood restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Schmoyer has a soft spot for John Rigas. She remembers when she split
open her leg sliding into second base as a kid. She received speedy
medical service--and 63 stitches--only after her father called Rigas, who
was on the hospital board. "He came and sat with me," said Schmoyer,
whose two sons work for Adelphia. "He has a gift for giving, and what you
give comes back to you."</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia is critical to surrounding Potter County, which derives 10%
of its tax dollars from the company. "They'll land on their feet," said
County Commissioner Ken Wingo. "When they get more information out, that
will calm these fears."</TE>
<TE>   Very few facts have come out of Adelphia since the crisis began. Some
townsfolk are uneasy because John Rigas, a regular at eateries around
town, hasn't shown his face in weeks, staying holed up at headquarters on
Main Street.</TE>
<TE>   An important banker in town believes Adelphia is like any other
company that must take big risks with other people's money to beat the
competition. "A lot of people in town don't understand that it's a tough,
cutthroat world out there. It's not Mayberry," said Charles Updegraff,
chief executive of Citizens Trust Co., the local bank of which John Rigas
sits on the board.</TE>
<TE>   Rigas grew up 40 miles away in Wellsville, N.Y., above his family's
Texas Hot diner, which is run by his brother Gus today. He fought in
World War II and was among the troops who landed at Normandy. Although
educated as an engineer, in 1952 he bought the movie theater on Main
Street here and the local cable franchise.</TE>
<TE>   He and Gus strung cable wires from telephone poles and sold service
door-to-door until 1983, when John bought out his brother so his three
sons could join the business.</TE>
<TE>   Rigas, who declined to be interviewed for this article, loves to
regale listeners with tales of his early brushes with financial disaster.
He overdrew his bank account to buy that first cable franchise for $300.
In the late 1960s he almost defaulted on a $25,000 loan before being
bailed out by one of his employees, who gave him the money she had just
inherited.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been many times when he's come close to losing it all," said
Francis Castano, a retired dentist whose mother was Adelphia's first
employee. "The company's strong cash flow always allowed them to be . . .
just one step ahead of the creditors. They've learned to live with it."</TE>
<TE>   Even as his wealth grew, Rigas remained loyal to his small town. He
bought out destitute farmers and wound up with 10,000 acres, which he
planted with Christmas trees, corn and sunflowers. He also bought an
abandoned school that his four children attended decades ago and
converted it into Adelphia's headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Though storefronts are boarded up in nearby towns such as Painted Post
and Port Allegany, Main Street here is postcard perfect. It has lovingly
restored brick buildings and Victorian facades freshly painted
wintergreen and burgundy under the direction of Rigas' historically
minded wife, Doris.</TE>
<TE>   "People have become so dependent, with the attitude that 'Oh, Adelphia
will do it,' just like in the old steel towns," Castano said. "The whole
area has been lifted to a higher quality, and that is a legacy of
Adelphia's, no matter what happens."</TE>
<TE>   When an acquisition spree strained Coudersport's resources, Rigas
refused to move Adelphia's headquarters to Buffalo or Pittsburgh.
Instead, he spent $100 million building and renovating offices. An empty
silk mill was transformed into command central for the now-troubled phone
venture. And a new brick headquarters for Adelphia, the first three-story
structure in town, with four imposing marble pillars, is nearly finished.</TE>
<TE>   But expansion also brought urban evils as real estate prices nearly
doubled and traffic and parking became problems.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in recent weeks, these complaints have been overshadowed by a much
greater--and mostly unspoken--fear that the bubble of prosperity will
burst. The local newspaper, the Potter Leader-Enterprise, had three
Adelphia stories on its front page last week.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is worried that they'll go belly up, but no one wants to
admit it," said one local business owner.</TE>
<TE>   Despite some doubts about Adelphia, most townspeople are
overwhelmingly protective of Rigas. At a local bar, one hometown investor
said, "Don't write a bad word about John, or I'll hunt you down."</TE>
<TE>   Townspeople, however, feel less affection for Rigas' sons.</TE>
<TE>   The town's favorite is Michael, the oldest, a Harvard law graduate who
is in charge of cable operations. He is described as a carbon copy of his
father--sweet, soft-spoken and civic-minded.</TE>
<TE>   James, a Stanford law graduate, runs the ailing telephone company and
stays behind the scenes. He has a reputation for a volatile temper. The
only married son, James has young children and a stately, $7-million
Victorian mansion under construction in town that dwarfs neighboring
houses.</TE>
<TE>   Tim, a Wharton graduate, is Adelphia's chief financial officer and
deal maker. He also watches over the company's interest in the Buffalo
Sabres hockey team and is the heaviest user of Adelphia's three private
jets.</TE>
<TE>   Locals say James and Tim are like their mother, Doris, who is regarded
as demanding, ambitious and materialistic. While John putts around town
in a white GMC Envoy, Doris is usually transported by limousine. She has
barns full of antiques from around the world and runs an interior design
shop that picks Adelphia's decor. People still are talking about her
attempt to return the marble columns for the new headquarters because she
didn't like their grain.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Adelphia became delinquent with the Securities and
Exchange Commission by failing to file its annual report. A few nights
earlier, John Rigas' SUV was parked behind the former school well past
dinner time, as Adelphia executives raced to complete the filing.</TE>
<TE>   In the old principal's office, where Rigas' secretaries sit, a paper
shredder whirled amid gallows humor. One executive popped in for a gum
ball and joked about having to produce documents, alluding to the SEC
investigation the company faces.</TE>
<TE>   John and Michael Rigas were upstairs on a marathon conference call
with board directors, who all have been sued on securities fraud
allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Outside on Main Street, it was just another day in Mayberry. A
sidewalk sale by local merchants celebrated small-town prosperity, with
clowns and balloons and homemade baked goods, as the sun went down on one
of the first balmy days of spring.</TE>

<HD>Panama Probe Uncovers Apathy</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Findings on dictatorship-era killings probably won't
be pursued. Few seem to care, except for the victims' relatives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PANAMA CITY
</DL>
<LD>The break in the case came from an American dog named Eagle.</LD>
<LD>   Panama's truth commission had been struggling for months to
investigate the darkest chapter of the country's past, the nearly 150
killings or disappearances that took place during two decades of
U.S.-backed dictatorships.</LD>
<LD>   The government had provided less than half a million dollars for the
task, and the public didn't seem to care what the truth was, or whether
it was uncovered. The commission was coming up empty.</LD>
<TE>   Then, last June, a U.S. forensic investigator brought in Eagle, a
Doberman mix trained in finding human remains.</TE>
<TE>   Eagle eventually found bone fragments, buried like memories in
scattered grave sites throughout the country. There wasn't much left: a
toe bone at one site, an ankle bone that bore deep scratches, possibly
from manacles.</TE>
<TE>   But they were enough to make Eagle a star, mobbed by children at a
local hospital, praised in the press. And the findings were enough for
the families too.</TE>
<TE>   "This is part of our story," said Maritza Maestre, 53, whose uncle was
taken into custody and then disappeared under the dictatorship here in
1971. "We want Panama, and the world, to know it."</TE>
<TE>   Today, the commission will release its final report, but justice may
be long in coming: The document won't name names, and the country's
attorney general apparently doesn't have enough money to pursue the
cases.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, the apathetic reaction to the truth commission isn't
surprising.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, Panama's dictators, beginning with Gen. Omar Torrijos
in 1968 and ending with Gen. Manuel Noriega, ousted during a U.S.
invasion in 1989, weren't particularly vicious by Latin American
standards.</TE>
<TE>Neighboring Countries Have Bloodier Records</TE>
<TE>   More than 200,000 people were killed or vanished during Guatemala's
long, savage civil war. In Peru, where a truth commission is just
beginning to look into the regime of disgraced former President Alberto
Fujimori, 30,000 people were killed and 1,000 disappeared during battles
between the government and leftist guerrillas in the 1980s and '90s.</TE>
<TE>   For another thing, Panamanians have become preoccupied with the
future.</TE>
<TE>   No longer dominated by the United States and its management of the
Panama Canal, the country is struggling to find its identity: Is it part
of Central America? South America? An island of commerce and free trade?
Or a diplomatic and political center, a sort of Brussels for Latin
America?</TE>
<TE>   That identity search has left questions about the past in the past.
Panama's history has remained buried, literally and figuratively, as the
country moves forward.</TE>
<TE>   The Panamanian version of the truth commission is one of the latest of
more than 20 such panels installed around the world as nations moved from
dictatorship to democracy.</TE>
<TE>   The commissions, which originated in Latin America during the 1980s
and gained fame in South Africa, were supposed to provide a way for
countries to shed light on the dark secrets of their pasts.</TE>
<TE>   But as part of that process, some of the commissions made a
controversial bargain. They traded truth for justice, usually providing
protection to those guilty of, or complicit in, the abuses in exchange
for testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups have begun warning that the commissions must be
carefully constructed to deliver what they promise.</TE>
<TE>   "The risk of truth commissions is that they are conceived as a
substitute for justice and accountability," said Jose Miguel Vivanco,
head of the Americas Division for New York-based Human Rights Watch.</TE>
<TE>   The Panamanian commission in many ways typifies both the problems and
the promise of such efforts.</TE>
<TE>   It has long been known among Panamanians that people disappeared or
were killed under the dictatorships of Torrijos and Noriega. In the days
after the U.S. invasion, an unofficial list was even published in leading
newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   A "reconciliation" commission was set up in 1990 that urged
investigation into individual cases, but no one ever followed up on the
recommendations. A leading government official at the time now says that
was a mistake, blaming a lack of resources and the chaos following the
invasion.</TE>
<TE>   As years went by, victims' families tried to pressure different
governments for an investigation. They got nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in 1999, two former military officers confessed to priests that
they had helped conceal the remains of several men on an old military
base that is now part of Panama's international airport.</TE>
<TE>   The priests passed along the information to government officials, who
responded quickly, attacking the site with a backhoe. They found two
bodies in September of that year, but no more. Still, the discoveries
were enough to convince President Mireya Moscoso's government to set up
the commission early last year.</TE>
<TE>   The idea met with resistance. There was talk from opposition
politicians about retaliation. Moscoso's late husband, former President
Arnulfo Arias Madrid, had been deposed by Torrijos with the help of
Noriega.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's attorney general refused to back the investigation.
Moscoso had to dig into a special executive fund to pay for the work. The
legislation creating it gave the commission only six months to sift
through 30 years of history, later extended to this month.</TE>
<TE>   One of the commission's earliest decisions continues to be
controversial. Commissioners decided to limit their investigations to the
period of the two dictatorships. They would not pursue cases that arose
during the U.S. invasion, saying it would be too much work.</TE>
<TE>   That period is still shrouded in controversy. There has never been a
complete figure of how many people were killed, but informed estimates
range as high as 400, including Panamanian security forces and civilians.</TE>
<TE>   When work finally got underway, it quickly became clear that Panama's
investigation suffered from one unusual problem. Most commissions do
their investigations in the years immediately following the end of
repressive regimes.</TE>
<TE>   But Panama's investigators were examining cases up to 30 years old. In
fact, the bulk of the incidents occurred during the beginning of the
Torrijos regime in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when small bands of
leftist student leaders and armed groups were targeted.</TE>
<TE>   The age of the cases made the investigation difficult. Memories had
faded. Many of the sites had been bulldozed or had returned to jungle.
Most mysterious of all, perhaps, was the disappearance of the Panamanian
intelligence service records.</TE>
<TE>   The commission only recently learned that the records, about 15,000
pages seized during the invasion, had been taken to the United States and
microfilmed. Investigators are hoping the U.S. government will release
those records, just as it did in El Salvador and Guatemala. They have yet
to receive a response.</TE>
<TE>   And so, when work began a year ago, investigators had little concrete
evidence. They sifted through the site where the two bodies had been
found. They dug up new sites on the basis of imprecise and conflicting
witness testimony.</TE>
<TE>   And they found nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "There was serious skepticism" about the commission's work, said Bruce
Broce, the head anthropologist.</TE>
<TE>   That's where Eagle came in. By chance, investigators made contact with
Sandra Anderson, 46, a private forensic investigator who volunteered the
dog's services. Eagle, who usually works on law enforcement cases, can
find bodies decades old, buried six feet deep or even underwater.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers were skeptical. But they decided to take a chance.
Anderson and Eagle came to Panama last July and started working the air
base. The dog began barking along a ridge of red earth far from where the
original bodies were discovered.</TE>
<TE>   Unsure, the workers slowly started digging with trowels. They found
nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "Is there really something here?" one asked. Anderson said to keep
digging. After more fruitless effort, Anderson and the investigator began
arguing. Then a worker came over with a mud-encrusted "rock" that felt
lighter than normal. The investigators dusted it off.</TE>
<TE>   It was a toe bone--the first indication of more bodies buried at the
site.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, I saw his face change. He was a believer," said
Anderson, who works about 200 cases a year with Eagle, most of them for
law enforcement agencies in search of bodies or trace elements such as
blood.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson and Eagle would come back to Panama twice more, exploring
different sites on each visit. More than 30 sites were excavated. In some
cases, the bones had been disturbed, as happened when the Panamanian
government moved tons of earth at the original site. In other cases,
animals had disturbed burial sites. In others, the bodies were never
buried, and the remains became scattered over time.</TE>
<TE>   The investigators have sent what they believe are bone fragments from
about 20 victims to a laboratory in the U.S. for identification.</TE>
<TE>Hoping to Compare DNA to Relatives'</TE>
<TE>   The investigators are hoping to compare the bones' DNA with DNA from
family members to find matches and identify the remains.</TE>
<TE>   "We just want to give the families something," Broce said.</TE>
<TE>   But that alone won't satisfy the victims' families.</TE>
<TE>   Maestre was a young girl when her uncle, Alcividades Betancourt, a
member of a left-leaning student group, was snatched by Panamanian
security forces Feb. 17, 1971--a date she rattles off like her own
birthday.</TE>
<TE>   He was never seen again, although Maestre's brothers made repeated
trips to a jail where he allegedly was being held and demanded to see
him.</TE>
<TE>   Maestre knows the name of the Panamanian intelligence officer, now
retired, who last saw her uncle alive and hopes the commission will help
find out what happened. But she also wants justice, something she fears
is still far away.</TE>
<TE>   The commission won't put any names of killers or torturers in its
report--Alberto Almanza, the commission president, said it isn't in his
purview.</TE>
<TE>   Nor does the nation's attorney general seem disposed to pursue the
cases. A top justice official said the office simply doesn't have the
resources to prosecute without international assistance.</TE>
<TE>   And so, Maestre is afraid that at the end of her 30-year-search, she
will have answers but no satisfaction.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important that those involved are investigated and
punished," Maestre said. "If they are not, it will create a sense of
impunity. And then it could happen again."</TE>

<HD>Venezuelan's Role Unraveled Coup, U.S. Says</HD>
<DH>Politics: Interim leader's unconstitutional dissolution of
government branches led the military to reinstate Chavez, officials
contend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>U.S. officials, pressing their case that they played no improper
role in last week's failed uprising in Venezuela, on Wednesday blamed
business leader Pedro Carmona for taking actions as self-appointed
president that violated his nation's constitution and led to the coup's
rapid collapse.</LD>
<LD>   In the most detailed account yet of their role in the abortive ouster,
U.S. officials said Carmona thrust himself into a power vacuum created
when Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was forced from office late last
week. They said that when Carmona unwisely dissolved the National
Assembly and removed the country's Supreme Court, the military became
alarmed and reinstalled Chavez.</LD>
<LD>   When Carmona and his aides dissolved the National Assembly on Friday,
"it was apparent that they didn't know what they were doing in terms of
operating within the constitution," said a senior Bush administration
official who insisted on remaining unidentified. "I think the military
probably noticed that as well."</LD>
<TE>   Chavez, elected by a landslide in 1998, has become an increasingly
polarizing figure in his country, restricting opposition parties, gagging
the media and seeking to reorganize the state oil company. He surrendered
power last week after large demonstrations in Caracas, the capital, set
off violence that killed at least 15 people. He regained the presidency
early Sunday.</TE>
<TE>U.S. Reaction Faulted</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has been criticized by congressional Democrats
and other observers, who say it was slow to condemn the undemocratic
effort to dump Chavez even though the U.S. has led a public effort to
dissuade coups against democratically elected governments. Critics have
charged that American officials might even have encouraged Venezuelans to
dump the leftist leader, with whom the U.S. has long clashed.</TE>
<TE>   But administration officials insisted that they took no action either
to encourage a coup or to ensure that it would succeed.</TE>
<TE>   They insisted that although U.S. Ambassador Charles Shapiro contacted
Carmona on Friday as the interim Venezuelan leader sought to close down
the legislature, it was not to aid the effort but to avert
unconstitutional acts that would further harm U.S.-Venezuelan relations.</TE>
<TE>   An official said that if the interim government had violated the
constitution, the United States and other countries would have been
forced to impose trade and other sanctions under a 7-month-old
international agreement called the Inter-American Democracy Charter.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't that we wanted Carmona to succeed," a senior U.S. official
said. "It was a question of having some democratic continuity so that we
could continue to operate with Venezuela as a country."</TE>
<TE>   He said U.S. officials were "outraged" at Carmona's moves to shut down
the legislature, the Supreme Court and other branches of the government.</TE>
<TE>   Most officials willing to discuss the events requested anonymity
because of the sensitive diplomatic relations.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration's actions have drawn fire from Democrats in
part because the assistant secretary of State responsible for Latin
America is Cuban-born Otto J. Reich, a staunch anti-Communist whose
appointment was opposed this year by some Democratic senators.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics have questioned whether the administration's actions
might have been influenced by Reich's dislike for Chavez, who supports
Fidel Castro.</TE>
<TE>   But Reich insisted that he had had no contacts with Carmona or other
leaders of the coup attempt during the thwarted ouster. "I never spoke to
Mr. Carmona," he told reporters at the State Department on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>Praise for the Military</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said that although they still have no proof that Chavez
willingly relinquished power, they did hear reports of his resignation
from a number of military and civilian sources in Venezuela. They said it
was possible that the military might have forced the president from
office temporarily because it was upset that pro-Chavez gunmen had fired
on large crowds of protesters in Caracas last week.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. officials praised the actions of the military officers who,
they said, had risen up against Chavez because of his role in directing
the violence against protesters.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. officials contended that the military had not sought to
install any new president or take any other unconstitutional action, but
had allowed the job to be temporarily unfilled. As of last Thursday
night, they said, Venezuelan sources were telling them that no one was in
charge.</TE>
<TE>   By Friday, however, Carmona had sworn himself in as president and
begun to reorganize the government, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional aides say Bush administration officials have told
lawmakers of reports that Cuban troops had joined last week's fighting on
Chavez's side. An administration official, who acknowledged that the
government had received reports that foreign troops were involved,
declined to identify them or elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said they hoped to help steer Venezuela back toward a
more robust democracy by working with other nations in the Organization
of American States.</TE>
<TE>   The OAS might even send an observer mission to monitor the actions of
the Venezuelan government, as it did in Peru during the troubled tenure
of former President Alberto Fujimori, officials said. But it also could
choose a less intrusive approach, they said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is in a sensitive diplomatic position because it does not
want to be seen as trying to push around the Chavez government,
especially given the controversy over the U.S. attitude toward the
attempted ouster.</TE>
<TE>   OAS members are to meet in Washington today to consider a fact-finding
report from Secretary-General Cesar Gaviria on the failed coup and to try
to chart actions to help move Venezuela toward a fuller democracy.</TE>

<LD>The Dutch army's top general resigned, a day after the ruling
coalition quit over the failure of Dutch peacekeepers to prevent a 1995
massacre in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</LD>
<LD>   Lt. Gen. Ad van Baal took responsibility for mistakes made by the
military. Lawmakers, meanwhile, called for a parliamentary inquiry into
the fall of the U.N.-declared "safe area" at Srebrenica, where Serbs
killed more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys.</LD>
<LD>   In Bosnia, victims' relatives demanded compensation from the Dutch

<LD>Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon wants to question former U.S.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger about crimes committed during the
military dictatorships in South American countries in the 1970s and '80s.</LD>
<LD>   Garzon, who has been investigating rights abuses during Chilean Gen.
Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship, has filed a request with British
authorities to allow him to question Kissinger when he arrives for a
convention, said Juan Garces, a lawyer in the Pinochet probe.</LD>
<LD>   Garces said Garzon wants to question Kissinger about his alleged
involvement in Operation Condor, a concerted plot by former military
dictatorships in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay
to persecute and eliminate opponents.</LD>

<HD>Hong Kong Leader Seeks to Revamp Civil Service</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HONG KONG
</DL>
<LD>Hong Kong's leader announced plans Wednesday to form a Cabinet of
political appointees to run the 180,000-member civil service left behind
by the British, the biggest government shake-up since the former colony
returned to Chinese rule.</LD>
<LD>   Pro-democracy lawmakers accused Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa of
seeking more power by setting up a government of yes men and said he was
pushing through the changes too quickly for adequate discussion.</LD>
<LD>   Handpicked by Beijing in 1997, Tung has been highly unpopular among
Hong Kong citizens. He will begin his second term in July.</LD>
<TE>   Tung dismissed the criticism.</TE>
<TE>   "If you think all the people who join the government will listen to my
voice only, you're underestimating them," he told lawmakers. "If I can
only employ such people, then it's my failure. I won't employ people in
this way."</TE>
<TE>   In a publicly broadcast speech before the legislature, Tung said he
was proposing 14 senior-level posts for political appointees who will
report directly to him.</TE>
<TE>   The civil service needs radical reforms to cope with major challenges,
he said. Hong Kong is struggling to bounce back from its second economic
downturn since Britain handed the territory back to China in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The measure seems certain to pass. The opposition can object but do
little else under Hong Kong's legislative arrangement, which critics say
is unfairly tilted toward big business and pro-Beijing interests.</TE>
<TE>   The revamping will leave the appointees running the territory's civil
service, currently a nonpolitical force that is a legacy of British
colonial days.</TE>
<TE>   Tung said the final power over any appointment and removal of
officials rests with Beijing, which has allowed Hong Kong a great deal of
political autonomy under an arrangement dubbed "one country, two
systems."</TE>
<TE>   Pro-democracy legislators grilled Tung on how the government would be
more accountable to the people when its top officials answered only to
him.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it fitting to call this an accountability system when it has no
democratic basis and isn't accountable to the public?" asked Martin Lee,
head of the political opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Many lawmakers also complained that they weren't being given enough
time to study the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't give us any concrete details," said legislator Margaret
Ng, who walked out of a private briefing given before Tung publicly
announced his plans. "It was meaningless."</TE>
<TE>   Another opposition figure, Emily Lau, said it was "totally
unacceptable" that Tung wanted his new plan approved in time for the
start of his second term July 1.</TE>

<LD>A Serbian coalition has agreed to participate in Kosovo's
government after reaching a compromise with the province's U.N.
administrators.</LD>
<LD>   Parties representing ethnic Serbs, a minority in Kosovo, boycotted the
province's new government because they were given control only of the
Agriculture Ministry. The coalition demanded that it also be allowed to
run the ministry overseeing the return of Serbian refugees.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Steiner, chief U.N. administrator for the province, had
insisted that refugee return was part of the U.N. mandate, but he
compromised by agreeing to accept a Serb-appointed advisor.</LD>
<TE>   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Soldier Shot in Bazaar Attack</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ZUCCHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>A U.S. Special Forces soldier was shot in the face by a gunman who
rushed up to him and three other Americans as they were shopping in the
crowded downtown bazaar Wednesday in this southern desert city.</LD>
<LD>   The soldier was treated at the American military camp outside Kandahar
and was in stable condition, a base spokesman said. Witnesses said the
gunman escaped on foot through the warren of narrow alleyways and
vegetable stalls in the Largo Gange market.</LD>
<LD>   It was the first reported incident of an American soldier being
attacked in a civilian setting since the U.S. military campaign in
Afghanistan began Oct. 7. Combat, accidents, land mines and aircraft
crashes have killed 37 U.S. military personnel since last fall.</LD>
<TE>   Ahmad Walli, a cotton merchant in the bazaar, said the soldier was
examining an ammunition belt at the Insaf gun and ammo stall next door
when a man emerged from behind a stack of yellow cotton bales. He shot
the soldier in the corner of the mouth. An Afghan standing nearby was
grazed, Walli said.</TE>
<TE>   The American had drifted away from three fellow U.S. soldiers, who
were buying ammunition belts in a stall directly across the dirt pathway.
By the time the three soldiers reacted and came to the aid of the wounded
man, Walli and other merchants said, the assailant had fled.</TE>
<TE>   All four soldiers were armed, the merchants said, but did not fire
their weapons. The gunman used a small-caliber weapon, said Army Maj.
A.C. Roper, a spokesman at the Kandahar base.</TE>
<TE>   Marine Maj. Ralph Mills, a spokesman for the U.S. Central Command in
Tampa, Fla., said the fellow soldiers at first thought that the shot was
a firecracker.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan soldiers cordoned off parts of the bazaar after the 11:10 a.m.
shooting, but no arrests were reported. Five merchants were brought in
for questioning, security officers said.</TE>
<TE>   The merchants said U.S. soldiers often come to browse the gun stalls,
which offer Russian-made automatic rifles, shotguns, ammunition, pistols,
bayonets and ammo belts.</TE>
<TE>   The gun shops are about 200 yards from the Special Forces unit's
fortified compound. Mills said the injured soldier was driven to get
treatment. The soldier remained conscious and was to be flown to an
undisclosed American military hospital for further treatment, Mills
added. The soldier's name was not released.</TE>
<TE>   Mills said the four soldiers were on patrol, which would require them
to be armed.</TE>
<TE>   Three security guards at the Special Forces compound said U.S.
soldiers normally visit the bazaar accompanied by an armed Afghan
bodyguard. The four Americans had no bodyguard, according to the security
guards and merchants. One shopkeeper said they were accompanied by an
unarmed Afghan translator.</TE>

</DL>
<LD>Images of Osama bin Laden allegedly filmed in December and shots of
Muslim fighters killed by American bombs were broadcast Wednesday across
the Middle East on a Saudi-owned satellite station that says it received
an Al Qaeda videotape.</LD>
<LD>   The tape was broadcast by the Middle East Broadcast Corp. a day after
the Qatar-based station Al Jazeera previewed a similar video. Both were
compilations of various clips, including undated material, narration,
graphics and news footage of the World Trade Center towers collapsing
Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   MBC's tape, like the Al Jazeera excerpts, showed Bin Laden next to his
top lieutenant, Ayman Zawahiri.</LD>
<TE>   A U.S. official in Washington familiar with the broadcasts said the
two tapes are different, though they contain some of the same footage.</TE>
<TE>   MBC Chief Editor Nakhle Haj said the tape obtained by his station
"best shows Al Qaeda's involvement in masterminding the Sept. 11
attacks."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Expecting New Attacks in Afghan Spring</HD>
<DH>War: Warm weather will bring skirmishes and assaults on patrols and
civilians, military says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>As snowcaps begin to melt on the mountain peaks of Afghanistan,
military strategists are preparing for renewed attacks by guerrilla
fighters, who suffered heavy casualties in a massive assault last month
but have historically returned with the spring poppies.</LD>
<LD>   Echoing reports that he has been receiving from U.S. military and
intelligence officials, President Bush on Wednesday warned that fighting
would probably intensify as mountain passes and roads open and fresh
vegetation provides cover for Al Qaeda fighters.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike ground battles in the first phase of the war, which sometimes
involved thousands of troops, spring will bring smaller skirmishes,
hit-and-run attacks against military patrols, and targeted assassinations
and terrorist assaults against civilians and facilities, intelligence
officials predict.</LD>
<TE>   Hours after Bush spoke, a gunman shot a U.S. soldier in the face as he
was shopping in a marketplace in Kandahar. The assailant fled.</TE>
<TE>   British commandos searching the mountains of eastern Paktia province
said they had seen signs that Taliban and Al Qaeda troops were returning
to the region.</TE>
<TE>   "As the spring thaw comes, we expect cells of trained killers to try
to regroup, to murder, create mayhem and try to undermine Afghanistan's
efforts to build a lasting peace," Bush said at the Virginia Military
Institute. "We know this from not only intelligence, but from the history
of military conflict in Afghanistan. It's been one of initial success
followed by long years of floundering and ultimate failure. We're not
going to repeat that mistake."</TE>
<TE>   The rising danger comes at an especially sensitive time, as Afghans
begin trying to build a stable political system on the ruins of decades
of war.</TE>
<TE>   The countermeasures against the anticipated guerrilla warfare are
likely to resemble the war on drugs in Colombia more than the large-scale
air-and-ground combat that crushed Afghanistan's Taliban regime. The new
strategies are likely to involve a smaller number of pinpoint airstrikes,
ground patrols rather than attacks, and an emphasis on intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   Concerns about the possibility of a renewed pro-Taliban push led to an
assault this week by 1,700 British commandos and a smaller number of
American and other coalition fighters in Paktia province, the site of
last month's big battle known as Operation Anaconda.</TE>
<TE>   British marines still growing accustomed to the thin air at 10,000
feet have found booby-trapped bodies, documents and thousands of rounds
of ammunition, said Lt. Col. Tim Chicken, the group's operational
commander.</TE>
<TE>   "The ammunition appears to have been dumped or stored here, and we
have come across a number of tripwires," said Chicken, 43. "The enemy has
been here, but he has scarpered. Our job is to make sure he can't come
back."</TE>
<TE>   The British used explosives to destroy the caves and bunkers in which
the arms caches were hidden, reducing the threat that guerrillas will
reuse a corridor known as the rat line, through which they have
historically transported supplies from Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   "When we pull out, the Al Qaeda and Taliban could come back in and set
up shop," said Sgt. Maj. Russ Craig of the 45 Commando Royal Marines,
whose camouflage-clad troops with painted faces and bulletproof vests
trained for the mission in the rocky inclines of Scotland. "Since we've
destroyed them, they can't establish themselves in the same way."</TE>
<TE>   There is ample precedent for renewed spring attacks. During the 1980s
war to oust the Soviet military, moujahedeen rebels launched new
offensives each spring, especially in heavily farmed areas of eastern and
southern Afghanistan. The rebels used new growth in gardens, vineyards,
poplar groves and thickets to hide their movements and to launch
hit-and-run attacks, often with deadly accuracy.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, the guerrillas hid snipers and machine-gun nests behind
packed-mud walls that surround and divide fields, and they flooded
irrigation canals and fields to hinder their Soviet pursuers.</TE>
<TE>   Some Afghan officials had been quietly urging U.S. commanders to
conduct a large attack in Paktia province. But the U.S. commander of the
war, Army Gen. Tommy Franks, told reporters last week that he had no
immediate plans for a military action on the scale of Anaconda, the
largest ground attack of the war.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Franks signaled that smaller military assaults were still to come,
saying, "There are groups of enemy troops still in that country." He
noted that U.S. troops had reported finding leaflets "offering rewards
for the kill or capture of Americans."</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,500 U.S. troops and 500 allied soldiers took part in
Anaconda's bitter 17-day assault, reportedly killing hundreds of
suspected Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters. Given those heavy casualties,
other officials said, Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders were unlikely to mass
their troops again and risk further slaughter.</TE>
<TE>   More than 5,000 U.S. troops and a similar number of coalition forces
in Afghanistan are working to stabilize the fractious country and to
track down pro-Taliban fighters, as the military personnel also
coordinate shipments of food and humanitarian assistance, Franks said.</TE>

<HD>Ex-King Heads Home to Kabul After 29 Years</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Despite reports of assassination plots, exiled monarch
is upbeat, family says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>The former king of this war-battered nation was heading for home
early today after nearly three decades in exile, with family members
playing down the security threat he may face.</LD>
<LD>   Despite reports of plots to assassinate Mohammad Zaher Shah, and the
arrest of suspects in an alleged bombing campaign in Kabul two weeks ago,
the ex-king was in high spirits shortly before his departure from Italy,
according to family members at his residence near Rome. He was expected
to arrive in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital, this morning.</LD>
<LD>   "He's not a man who is easily afraid," said Zaher Shah's cousin
Walishah Wali, one of eight family members returning on the flight. Zaher
Shah survived an assassination attempt about 10 years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Although the king is returning as a private citizen, not a monarch,
his arrival is of great symbolic significance to many Afghans, and he has
broad support among his countrymen.</TE>
<TE>   Zaher Shah was deposed in 1973 by a cousin, and only older Afghans
remember his reign, but he is identified in the popular consciousness
with the country's last period of peace and stability.</TE>
<TE>   While Zaher Shah's supporters say his return will build a sense of
national unity, detractors--including some figures from the anti-Taliban
Northern Alliance, whose members control the main security
ministries--question what the 87-year-old former monarch can achieve in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Plans for a big welcoming ceremony in Kabul were scrapped because of
safety concerns. Security was extremely tight in preparation for the
return, with police at main intersections stopping all vehicles to check
drivers and passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking shortly before Zaher Shah left his residence in Italy, Wali
said the ex-king's "mood is excellent. He's very well. He is calm. He has
a mission to perform, and he is very eager to perform it."</TE>
<TE>   He said Zaher Shah had no doubts about the security arrangements in
place in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   "All we wish for is that the return of the king can create a sense of
unity in the country," Wali said. "He's not coming to take back the
crown. He is coming as a man who was king for 40 years and is respected
by his people. He feels the respect they have for him will enable him to
get them to unite and put an end to the strife."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters hope his return will send a message that Afghanistan is
moving toward stability and peace, signaling to refugees that it is safe
to return and promoting reconciliation among ethnic and factional groups
after more than two decades of war.</TE>
<TE>   Early today, even as the former king was winging his way to
Afghanistan, people in Kabul were unsure whether the rumors that he was
coming were true. But there was growing excitement.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess it's a special day," said merchant Haji Ziauddin, 65, who
remembered Zaher Shah's reign as a time of stability.</TE>
<TE>   He said the king achieved little for Afghan development in his time,
"but he has always been sympathetic to all Afghan people. . . . People
trust him very much."</TE>
<TE>   Shopkeeper Mohammed Bayad, 55, said people would accept Zaher Shah as
king, president "or under any name, if he brings peace."</TE>
<TE>   "I remember his era. They were good days. There was never any fighting
or misuse of power," he said. "Schools were active, merchants were
working, banks were working. There was no robbery."</TE>
<TE>   Three of Zaher Shah's six offspring traveled with him to Kabul: his
sons Ahmad Shah, about 68, Mohammad Nadir, about 61, and Mir Wais, about
45. In addition, he traveled with three cousins, Wali, Abdul Wali and
Sultan Mahmoud Ghazi, and two grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Homaira, 86, suffering from osteoporosis, is under constant
medical care and remained in Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Zaher Shah was escorted home by interim Afghan Prime Minister Hamid
Karzai, who said earlier that the security situation in Kabul was
"perfect" for the ex-king's return.</TE>
<TE>   The ex-king's party flew out of Pratica di Mare military air base
outside Rome on an Italian air force jet. On board were Zaher Shah's
doctor and Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Margherita Boniver. Also on
board were Italian military personnel, including two doctors, two nurses
equipped with a heart defibrillating machine and nine police officers.</TE>
<TE>   After landing in Uzbekistan, the entourage had breakfast and switched
to two Italian air force C-130s, equipped to respond to a missile attack,
for the flight to Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The former king's arrival was delayed by three weeks because of
concerns about an alleged plot to shoot down his plane with a missile.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, Afghanistan's interim government claimed to have
unearthed another plot, involving a plan to kill Zaher Shah, Karzai and
other top government officials with a bomb. Dozens of people were
arrested, all of them opponents of the interim administration.</TE>
<TE>   The former king and his entourage have played down his ambitions to
regain the crown, but he said in a March interview with The Times that if
the Afghan people wanted him as king, he would not refuse.</TE>
<TE>   Members of Afghanistan's interim administration have shown little
enthusiasm for restoring the monarchy, but some observers believe that
Zaher Shah's family is hoping to steer the ex-king's son Mir Wais to the
crown.</TE>
<TE>   Although the former monarch enjoys support among Afghan citizens, it
is not clear how much political clout he will have.</TE>
<TE>   Zaher Shah, like Karzai, is a Pushtun. His return should provide a
greater sense of comfort to the country's largest ethnic group, which
makes up about 40% of the population but feels underrepresented in the
interim administration. The key Defense, Interior and Foreign Ministry
portfolios are held by ethnic Tajiks, mainly from the Northern Alliance,
which fought alongside U.S. and allied forces to depose the
Pushtun-dominated Taliban regime.</TE>
<TE>   The former king's main role in the coming months will be to convene a
grand council in June. The group will choose the country's next leader
and government. That administration will stay in power until elections
are held 18 months later.</TE>
<TE>   Those least enthusiastic about Zaher Shah's return are ethnic Tajik
moujahedeen commanders, who have criticized him for remaining aloof from
Afghanistan's civil war while they fought against the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   They've made clear their opposition to a return of the monarchy.</TE>
<TE>   Former President Burhanuddin Rabbani, a top Northern Alliance figure,
has said he does not oppose Zaher Shah's return as long as he is not
reinstalled as monarch. Others merely say that any former citizen is
entitled to return to his homeland.</TE>
<TE>   One question is whether the ex-king will be free to travel around
Afghanistan, or whether he will be hemmed in at his home by security
concerns. He has expressed his determination to travel throughout the
country and mix with Afghans, but coalition forces are still working to
clear eastern Afghanistan of Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Several recent attacks have raised fears about security, including a
bombing this month that hit a convoy carrying Defense Minister Mohammed
Qassim Fahim in Jalalabad--apparently an assassination attempt. Fahim
survived.</TE>
<TE>   The king's security will be provided by 40 Afghan bodyguards who were
trained by international forces. They will be backed by carabinieri,
Italian paramilitary police, who will remain at the former king's
residence for two to three months.</TE>
<TE>   "The new Afghanistan welcomes all its sons, including the former king
. . . a fatherly figure, a symbol of unity," Karzai said in Rome.</TE>

<HD>Name in Cave Leads to Detention</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Federal authorities said Wednesday that they have detained a
Tanzanian man and are investigating why his name was found on a document
in an Al Qaeda cave in Afghanistan congratulating him on his graduation
from a U.S. flight school.</LD>
<LD>   But the officials cautioned that, so far, there are no indications
that Issaya Nombo, described as being in his early 40s, had anything to
do with any terrorist plots, including the Sept. 11 attacks on the World
Trade Center and the Pentagon. Several of the suicide hijackers trained
at U.S. flight schools.</LD>
<LD>   Nombo was detained Monday in the small North Carolina town of Apex by
Immigration and Naturalization Service officials, who say his visa had
expired and that he is in the country illegally. Authorities would not
describe how or why they came into contact with Nombo and detained him
but said he was being held in a federal lockup in North Carolina.</LD>
<TE>   Federal law enforcement officials said FBI agents have conducted a
preliminary investigation, along with the INS, and have determined that
Nombo appears to have some legal problems, but none that appear to stem
from terrorist activities.</TE>
<TE>   Nombo "doesn't fit any of the traditional Al Qaeda stereotypes" and
apparently is Roman Catholic, not Muslim, said one official who asked not
to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a letter found in a cave with this guy's name on it,"
another law enforcement official said. "At this point, we have
interviewed him, and at the end of the day he may not be linked to
terrorism. . . . He may have been targeted as a recruit."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities would not disclose details about how or where in
Afghanistan the document was discovered or what it contained. But they
said they planned to continue to aggressively investigate the matter and
interview Nombo further.</TE>
<TE>   Several officials speculated that, based on initial evidence, Al Qaeda
operatives in Afghanistan may have gotten Nombo's name from the Web site
of a Titusville, Fla., flight training school, perhaps in an effort to
take advantage of his flight skills.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>An American fighter jet accidentally dropped at least one
laser-guided bomb on Canadian forces in Afghanistan on Wednesday night.
Canadian officials said four soldiers were killed and eight were injured.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Central Command confirmed that there were dead and injured
but said it didn't know how many.</LD>
<LD>   Navy Cmdr. Frank Merriman, spokesman for the Central Command in Tampa,
Fla., said an Air National Guard F-16 dropped one or two 500-pound bombs
near Kandahar, a former Taliban stronghold in the country's south.</LD>
<TE>   A Canadian Defense Department official said the Canadians were on an
exercise about 10 miles south of their Kandahar base when the bomb or
bombs were dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Six soldiers, including one who was seriously injured, will be
evacuated to an American medical facility. Two other soldiers suffered
minor injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Neither U.S. nor Canadian officials had information about what caused
the error.</TE>
<TE>   "How this can happen is a mystery to us. Without a doubt, there was a
misidentification," Canada's defense chief, Lt. Gen. Ray Henault, told
reporters in Ottawa.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Jean Chretien said President Bush had called to offer
his condolences and pledged to cooperate with a Canadian investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "As to the circumstances of what appears to have been a terrible
accident, clearly there are many questions that the families, and all
Canadians, expect to be answered," Chretien said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   More than 700 Canadian soldiers are deployed in Afghanistan, operating
out of Kandahar. Until now, no Canadian casualties had been reported.</TE>

<HD>Bush Says Arab States Must Choose Peace or Terrorism</HD>
<DH>Policy: Those in region have a responsibility to help calm the
Mideast conflict, president says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LEXINGTON, Va.
</DL>
<LD>President Bush said Wednesday that the Arab nations that have
supported the U.S.-led fight in Afghanistan must also clearly oppose
terrorist acts in the Middle East, singling out Egypt, Jordan and Saudi
Arabia.</LD>
<LD>   "All parties have a responsibility to stop funding or inciting terror.
And all parties must say clearly that a murderer is not a martyr; he or
she is just a murderer," Bush said in a speech that put moderate Arab
states on notice that, in his view, they are either on the side of peace
or supporters of terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's comments were his first in public on the Middle East since
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell embarked early last week on a mission
to the region. And they came as Powell headed home.</LD>
<TE>   Addressing cadets at the Virginia Military Institute, Bush declared
that his administration will continue to be involved in the Middle East.
Before the Powell trip, Bush had faced growing criticism for not doing
enough to address the spiraling violence between Palestinians and
Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   "We're confronting hatred that is centuries old, disputes that have
lingered for decades," Bush said. "But I want you to know, I will
continue to lead toward a vision of peace."</TE>
<TE>   He offered no specifics on how he would pursue this goal.</TE>
<TE>   He also sought to broaden responsibility for calming the conflict--a
goal that largely eluded Powell, who returned without a cease-fire
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "All parties have responsibilities," Bush said. "Those
responsibilities are not easy, but they're clear."</TE>
<TE>   Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia supported the campaign in Afghanistan
in response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United States, Bush
said. Now, he said, "they must help confront terrorism in the Middle
East."</TE>
<TE>   More broadly, the president directly applied to the Middle East what
has become known as the "Bush doctrine": that in the war on terrorism, no
nation can be neutral.</TE>
<TE>   "In the Middle East, where acts of terror have triggered mounting
violence, all parties have a choice to make," the president said. "Every
leader, every state must choose between two separate paths: the path of
peace or the path of terror."</TE>
<TE>   The speech previewed the message he is expected to deliver to Saudi
Crown Prince Abdullah when the two meet at Bush's ranch in Texas next
week.</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, the administration has sought to draw attention to the
human cost of the conflict to both Palestinians and Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz drew boos from
some attending a massive pro-Israel rally in Washington when he said, "It
is critical that we recognize and acknowledge" that along with Israelis,
"innocent Palestinians are suffering and dying in great numbers as well."</TE>
<TE>   Bush touched upon that theme in his speech, saying, "In the stricken
faces of mothers, Palestinian mothers and Israeli mothers, the entire
world is witnessing the agonizing cost of this conflict."</TE>
<TE>   The president outlined specific, short-term steps that he believes are
necessary to defuse the Middle East crisis.</TE>
<TE>   His directive to Israel seemed less emphatic than previous comments.
As Powell started his trip, Bush had demanded that Israel withdraw
"without delay" from the cities and villages it has occupied in the West
Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with some troop movement underway, the president said only that
"Israel must continue its withdrawals."</TE>
<TE>   Bush didn't mention by name Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon or
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat. But he made it clear that
the condemnation of suicide bombers Arafat finally issued over the
weekend would be insufficient if not accompanied by a real effort to
bring the attacks to an end.</TE>
<TE>   "The Palestinian Authority must act--must act--on its words of
condemnation against terror," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   He also said that all Arab states "must step up to their
responsibilities" to end terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   In the longer run, Bush said, the region must realize that the only
solution is the existence of two nations, Israel and Palestine, "side by
side in security and in peace."</TE>
<TE>   "That will require hard choices and leadership by Israelis,
Palestinians and their Arab neighbors," Bush said. "The time is now for
all to make the choice for peace."</TE>

<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>There is no evidence on the ground here that Secretary of State
Colin L. Powell's shuttle diplomacy between Israelis and Palestinians did
anything to defuse the conflict he left seething behind him Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   And it is far from clear that either Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat or Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is entirely unhappy
with Powell's failure.</LD>
<LD>   Powell secured neither an Israeli military withdrawal from Palestinian
areas nor a clear statement from Arafat that he was renouncing violence
and recommitting himself to negotiations. In Bethlehem, Israeli tanks
remain pointed at the Church of the Nativity, where more than 100
Palestinian gunmen are holed up. In Ramallah, Israeli soldiers are still
bunking down on the grounds of Arafat's battered and increasingly fetid
headquarters.</LD>
<TE>   Throughout the West Bank, troops and tanks continue to move in and out
of Palestinian towns and refugee camps, and militants who went
underground when Israel launched its sweeping offensive March 29 say they
are itching for revenge.</TE>
<TE>   With his state-in-the-making in ruins and his international prestige
badly battered, Arafat might have been expected to embrace the terms for
a cease-fire. But during his final, stormy meeting with Powell on
Wednesday, the Palestinian leader refused to meet Israel's demand that he
hand over the alleged killers of an Israeli Cabinet minister or accept an
Israeli proposal that the gunmen in the Church of the Nativity surrender
and face trial in Israel or go into exile.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Arafat emerged to denounce the international community for
failing to end Israel's stranglehold on his headquarters or the Bethlehem
church.</TE>
<TE>   In his defiance, Arafat gains points both with his own increasingly
embittered people and across an Arab world appalled by the scenes of
destruction in the West Bank that they see on their television screens
each night.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat's insistence that he will offer no concessions until Israel
ends its incursion has put moderate Arab regimes on the hot seat,
hard-pressed to explain to their angry citizens why neither the Arabs nor
the United States is forcing Israel to pull back. The first suggestion of
displeasure from an Arab leader came Wednesday, when Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak canceled his meeting in Cairo with Powell, offering no
further explanation but that he was "indisposed."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli commentators said Powell's failure to achieve a cease-fire
offered certain political advantages for Sharon, who has declared Arafat
an enemy of Israel and appears bent on dismantling not only armed
militias in Palestinian areas but also the infrastructure of the
Palestinian Authority that Arafat leads.</TE>
<TE>   Powell said Sharon promised that Israel will pull out of all areas
except Bethlehem and Ramallah in the coming week. Sharon, commentators
here say, will spend that week inflicting greater damage on Arafat's
administration. And in comments to reporters after Powell's departure,
Sharon said Israeli tanks and troops will continue to ring Palestinian
cities, poised to reenter whenever Israel feels it needs to.</TE>
<TE>   Predictably, Israel and the Palestinians blamed each other for what
both agreed was a failed attempt to achieve a cease-fire or an Israeli
withdrawal. Palestinians accused Powell of giving Sharon a green light to
continue his military campaign. Arab moderates warned that the Bush
administration's prestige was damaged by its failure to compel Israel's
withdrawal from recaptured Palestinian areas.</TE>
<TE>   "When Powell leaves everything the way it was when he came here, this
indicates that Sharon is going to attack" more Palestinian targets, said
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat. "We have nothing against the
secretary. All we can say is that Sharon did a good job of torpedoing his
mission here."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials put the blame squarely on Arafat, saying his refusal
to renounce violence, hand over militants or recommit himself to
achieving a negotiated settlement blocked progress.</TE>
<TE>   "What Powell really said is: The onus is very clearly on the
Palestinians; it is up to the Palestinians to end their violence," said
Zalman Shoval, a foreign policy advisor to Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   But Yossi Sarid, leader of the left-wing opposition in Israel's
parliament, assailed Powell for failing to achieve a cease-fire and for
taking a lead on Sharon's proposal for a regional conference to discuss
issues between Israel, its Arab neighbors and the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "If the United States will prepare and manage the international
conference the way it did Powell's mission," Sarid said in a statement,
"then it had better give up the idea of this conference already."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration, Sarid said, "has lost its authority over the
parties." To salvage the situation, he said, it should "impose a solution
on the basis of full withdrawal for full peace or give up its vision of
saving the free world from fundamentalist zealotry."</TE>
<TE>   Powell, for his part, apportioned blame to both sides during a news
conference in Jerusalem shortly before he left for Cairo for talks with
the Egyptian and Jordanian foreign ministers.</TE>
<TE>   But it will take more than even-handed blame to move Sharon and Arafat
from their entrenched positions, said Joseph Alpher, an Israeli strategic
analyst.</TE>
<TE>   "Powell was just trying to reason with everyone, and that's not good
enough right now," he said. "At the heart of the problem is the fact that
we don't have enough common ground to make any progress. You need
political concessions from Sharon to get security concessions from
Arafat. Neither leader has a realistic strategy for peace, so you're
going to have to clobber them, to smash heads together."</TE>
<TE>   Powell needs to enlist the help of moderate Arab states and the
European Union to pressure Arafat by threatening to cut off funding and
end diplomatic support, Alpher said. The secretary also needs to lean on
Israel by holding up funding for some projects and publicly criticizing
Sharon's policies.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the meager achievements of Powell's mission, it is what comes
next that will determine whether it was truly a failure. The secretary
said he will explore Sharon's proposal for a regional conference. But the
agenda for such a conference, and the participants, has yet to be
decided.</TE>

<DH>Diplomacy: Within the political establishment, Bush draws fire for
calling on Sharon to pull Israeli forces out of the West Bank.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Israel's defiance of a call by President Bush to withdraw from the
West Bank has prompted an unexpected political reaction in America: a
backlash against Bush for issuing the demand at all.</LD>
<LD>   In the last week, leading Democrats such as Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman
(D-Conn.) and Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) have joined conservative
Republicans in denouncing Bush's call for Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon to end military operations against the Palestinians.</LD>
<LD>   Many analysts believe that the uproar on the home front has
contributed to Bush's muted protest of Sharon's defiance. That pattern
continued Wednesday, when the president included only five words on an
Israeli withdrawal in his speech at the Virginia Military Institute.</LD>
<TE>   The domestic criticism could also signal difficulties for the White
House in advancing any peace process viewed as pressuring Sharon or
legitimizing Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very smart White House politically . . . and I think they
recognize there is not as much maneuvering room as State Department
bureaucrats may think there is," said Gary Bauer, who ran against Bush in
the 2000 GOP primaries and organized a pro-Israel letter from social
conservatives last week.</TE>
<TE>   More traditional voices in the foreign policy establishment, such as
Sens. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) and Charles Hagel (R-Neb.), have begun
to argue that there is no military solution to the Israel-Palestinian
confrontation. Yet they have been largely drowned out by demands from
others in both parties that Bush offer virtually unreserved support for
the Israeli offensive.</TE>
<TE>   "The pressure is almost exclusively from the hawkish side," said one
White House aide.</TE>
<TE>   Recent polls indicate that public opinion about the proper U.S. role
in the conflict is more ambivalent, with widespread hostility toward
Palestinian terrorist attacks mitigated by skepticism about the Sharon
government's commitment to peace.</TE>
<TE>   Surveys by both CBS and Gallup Organization found that between three
and five times as many Americans who responded sympathized more with
Israel than the Palestinians in the conflict. An overwhelming majority
agreed that Arafat was not doing all he could to end the violence.</TE>
<TE>   Yet doubts about Israel's course were also evident. In the CBS survey,
nearly half of Americans polled said they doubted the Israeli government
wanted peace enough to make real concessions for it.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, virtually no national political leaders have criticized
the Israeli offensive.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. politicians most intimately identified with the peace camp in
Israel have been restrained in their comments. Sen. Paul Wellstone
(D-Minn.), for instance, has simply called on Sharon to "respect the
dignity and human rights of ordinary, innocent Palestinian civilians,"
rather than issue an unequivocal call for withdrawal.</TE>
<TE>   The dominant voices have been those criticizing Bush for urging
Sharon, in an April 4 speech at the White House, to end the military
offensive.</TE>
<TE>   Bush came under immediate fire from foreign policy thinkers known as
the neo-conservatives. That group, composed mostly of Jewish and Roman
Catholic intellectuals such as William Kristol and William J. Bennett,
argues that Israel is responding to terror in the same way the United
States did after Sept. 11. It is hypocritical for Bush to tell Israel to
stop, they say.</TE>
<TE>   They also maintain that it undermines the "Bush doctrine"--which
states that the United States will treat any government that harbors
terrorists as a terrorist--for Secretary of State Colin L. Powell to meet
with Arafat as he did in the Middle East, or consider him a potential
negotiating partner.</TE>
<TE>   The neo-conservatives soon were joined by religious conservatives, who
have become an increasingly important pro-Israeli force within the GOP. A
group of leading religious conservatives, including Bauer and the Rev.
Jerry Falwell, urged Bush in their letter to "end the pressure on . . .
Sharon so that he has the time necessary to complete the mission he has
undertaken."</TE>
<TE>   Democratic and Republican senators also entered the fray, sending Bush
a letter late last week that echoed the statement from the Christian
conservatives.</TE>
<TE>   Its signers included liberals such as Clinton, Charles E. Schumer
(D-N.Y.) and Jon Corzine (D-N.J.), as well as Republican moderates Susan
Collins of Maine and Gordon Smith of Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Last weekend at the Florida state Democratic Party convention in
Orlando, Lieberman and Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) received loud
applause in denouncing Bush's pressure on Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   Will Marshall, executive director of the Progressive Policy Institute,
a centrist think tank, said the administration's conservative and
Democratic critics may part ways down the road because the Democrats
generally believe that the United States must eventually negotiate with
Arafat--an idea that is anathema to most on the right.</TE>
<TE>   For now, however, those protesting Bush's pressure on Sharon are
frustrating the traditional foreign policy establishment, a group that
includes the editorial pages of most major newspapers, many former
officials from Democratic and Republican administrations, and senators
such as Hagel and Biden.</TE>
<TE>   Those in this group tend to believe that the conflict can be defused
only by negotiations convened by the United States and preferably
involving Arab nations as well as Israel and the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is, if we are going to get to a peace, and ultimately a
political settlement, then all sides . . . are going to have to
participate" in making concessions, said Hagel.</TE>
<TE>   Those urging a greater emphasis on negotiation and diplomacy are
quietly reemerging after being overshadowed for the last two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Biden and Hagel have both defended Bush's efforts at diplomacy and
urged him to convene a peace conference that includes Arab nations.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what the president has to do is continue to stay on a course
that is able to get through the fog . . . knowing full well you are going
to take the hits, and they are going to be deep and painful and many of
them are going to be from your own party," Hagel said. "You've got to
stay with it; you can't back out of it now."</TE>

<HD>A Critical Juncture for Arafat</HD>
<DH>Conflict: A generation after he launched his struggle, his dream
remains elusive. Today he risks losing power if he is seen as appeasing
Israel.</DH>

<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>On New Year's Day 37 years ago, a little pear-shaped man with a
stubble beard and a kaffiyeh covering his balding pate went door to door
through Beirut's newspaper offices, handing out a press release that he
called "Military Communique No. 1." It said guerrillas had launched an
attack on Israel's water system.</LD>
<LD>   Mohammed Abdel Raouf Arafat Qudwa al Husseini, 35 and barely 5 foot 4,
looked almost comical in his baggy fatigues and unpolished boots. He was
unknown to the editors he met, as was the organization, Fatah, he had set
up with a dozen friends in Kuwait six years earlier. No one printed his
communique, a decision that turned out to be good journalistic judgment.
The attack had never happened.</LD>
<LD>   The author of the fabricated release was pictured on the front page of
the Jerusalem Post on Monday, shaking hands with a somber Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell. He had added some pounds and gray hair but
otherwise looked and dressed--perhaps even thought--almost as he had a
generation ago.</LD>
<TE>   What had changed was that the man now known as Yasser Arafat has one
of the world's most recognizable faces.</TE>
<TE>A Dire Predicament</TE>
<TE>   Today Arafat, 72, stands at a crossroads, perhaps the most desperate
of his long, unpredictable political career as the leader of the
Palestinian people. An Israeli offensive in the West Bank, launched March
29 after an epidemic of deadly Palestinian suicide bomber attacks in
Israel, has demolished his Palestinian Authority and left Arafat isolated
in his Ramallah compound. He is surrounded by Israeli tanks and soldiers,
to whom he is beholden for electricity to run his refrigerator and water
to flush his toilet.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat's wife, Suha, and daughter, Zahwa, are in Paris. Only a handful
of aides and bodyguards is left at his side in the two-room office where
he works, sometimes by candlelight. He is not free to step into his yard.
Food runs low unless the Israelis allow in new supplies. Sometimes the
batteries in his cell phone go dead.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in years, political analysts use the words "after
Arafat"--who will be the next to lead the Palestinians' campaign for
statehood?</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis had hoped that Powell would ignore Arafat on his Mideast
peace trip, thus adding to his isolation. But Powell met with him twice
in the besieged compound, including a final meeting Wednesday in an
attempt to win agreement on a plan to tie a cease-fire to political
progress toward statehood. There were no indications that Arafat made
significant concessions.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli columnists are calling this Arafat's "last final chance."</TE>
<TE>   If he doesn't seize it, if the suicide attacks resume in Israel, Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon could order him killed or exiled. Arafat, however,
has turned his back on opportunity before, particularly in July 2000 at
Camp David.</TE>
<TE>   There, during two weeks of negotiation under the auspices of President
Clinton, then-Prime Minister Ehud Barak gave Arafat almost everything he
wanted except Jerusalem and the right of Palestinian refugees from
Israel's 1948 War of Independence to return to homes that are now in
Israel. Arafat made no counterproposal. He said no and went home to
Ramallah, where, with rhetoric if not actual orders, he eventually fanned
the flames of a second intifada against Israeli rule.</TE>
<TE>   "You find a lot of criticism among Palestinians that Arafat fumbled at
Camp David," said Khalil Shikaki, a political science professor in
Ramallah. "And you'll hear criticism that he lacks the capacity or will
to lead, that he simply projects himself as another actor trying to
balance the interests of different factions within the Palestinian
movement."</TE>
<TE>   But Arafat has always been more effective as a symbol than as a
leader. He is disliked by many Arab heads of state but embraced because
he represents the Palestinians' aspirations. The administration he runs
in Ramallah is corrupt and inept. His miscalculations have cost the
Palestinians dearly. His intransigence has slowed the pace of pending
statehood.</TE>
<TE>   But without Arafat, it is possible that the so-called Palestinian
problem would never have been an issue that galvanized the world or
became the pivot point of Middle East peace.</TE>
<TE>   Raised in Cairo, Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip as the son of a wealthy
merchant, Arafat has always been an enigma. He deflects questions about
his personal life by giving political answers. He is at once manipulative
and concessionary, a master of double talk who says one thing in English
and quite another in Arabic. His Arabic is so bad that grammarians
cringe.</TE>
<TE>   Many political analysts say the man who once promised "a generation of
revenge" has been playing his role so long that he simply has run out of
ideas. He speaks of the physical reality of a Palestinian state but never
of his vision for what that state would be like. He has never groomed a
successor. A secular Muslim, he increasingly seems to view himself as a
guardian of Islam, trying to deliver a Palestinian state as well as the
holy sites of Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   He might well realize that he has far more power as an icon of
victimhood than he would as the president of an impoverished state on the
international dole.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest Israeli-Palestinian clash, Arafat has burnished his
image as a survivor, hunkered down in his compound. But many political
analysts wonder whether he might not have miscalculated the long-range
benefits of his strategy.</TE>
<TE>   The bombers allied with Arafat who blow themselves up in civilian
crowds have elicited no international sympathy for the Palestinian cause.
Their motivation appears to be desperation and revenge. The result of
their actions has been a massive Israeli attack that has killed hundreds
of Palestinians and destroyed sizable chunks of West Bank cities.</TE>
<TE>   The suicide bombings have also solidified support at home for Israel's
militant prime minister, even among leftists who once saw Arafat as a
peace partner worthy of trust.</TE>
<TE>Violence as a Tool</TE>
<TE>   There are at least two theories as to why Arafat doesn't rein in his
militants and speak out more convincingly against terrorism. One is that
he could lose power if he appeared to appease Israel. Another is that
violence has served Arafat's interests in the past. Except for a few
years in the mid-1990s when he seemed truly interested in pursuing
diplomacy, Arafat has used violence and instability as a tool of policy.</TE>
<TE>   It was the hijacking of airliners in the 1970s that brought the
Palestine Liberation Organization infamy and helped turn it into the
world's richest, best-armed and most widely known guerrilla movement.
Arafat's expulsion from Lebanon in the 1980s at the hands of Israeli
invaders gained the outgunned and outnumbered PLO international sympathy
that was important politically. The first intifada helped Arafat win
major population centers in the West Bank in the 1990s after the Oslo
accords.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon has called Arafat "irrelevant" and publicly lamented that the
Israeli sniper who had the Palestinian in his cross hairs in Beirut in
1982 didn't pull the trigger. The Bush administration differs, saying,
"The path to peace leads through Arafat."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the truth, Arafat, even in the isolation of his besieged
compound, is back where he is most comfortable: on center stage, the
underdog with a dream if not a vision.</TE>

<HD>Report Clears Officer in Columbine Slaying</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Independent investigation finds that Eric Harris, one of
the teen shooters, killed Daniel Rohrbough.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GOLDEN, Colo.
</DL>
<LD>An independent investigation released Wednesday found that a
student slain during the Columbine High School massacre was not killed by
a police officer as his parents have long claimed.</LD>
<LD>   The report concluded that Daniel Rohrbough, 15, was shot by Eric
Harris, one of two teen gunmen whose rampage killed 12 classmates and a
teacher three years ago.</LD>
<LD>   The 1,200-page report by the El Paso County Sheriff's Office
contradicted the official Columbine investigation on several points. That
report, issued by the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office in May 2000, has
been the subject of intense criticism and spawned dozens of lawsuits. The
controversy led to an unsuccessful recall effort against Sheriff John
Stone.</LD>
<TE>   The El Paso County probe concluded that Denver SWAT officer Sgt. Dan
O'Shea did not accidentally kill Rohrbough outside the school on April
20, 1999. It also said Rohrbough was not killed by gunman Dylan Klebold,
as the Jefferson County report concludes. Rather, ballistics evidence
shows that the bullet recovered from Rohrbough's body was a "textbook
match" to Harris' gun, said El Paso Sheriff Wesley Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the worst school shootings in U.S. history, Harris, 18, and
Klebold, 17, roamed Columbine High School, tossing homemade bombs and
shooting scores of classmates. The pair eventually killed themselves in
the school library.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso County officials met with the parents of Daniel Rohrbough for
2 1/2 hours Wednesday morning to review their findings. Brian Rohrbough
and Sue Petrone said that, while the new report gives them a glimpse for
the first time of what happened to their son that day, it also reinforces
what they say has been the incompetence of Sheriff Stone.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been searching for the truth for three years," said Brian
Rohrbough. "I think we finally got the facts that resemble the truth. The
Jefferson County Sheriff's Office never, ever gave us access to this
information. But I never gave up hope of finding out what happened. But
if this is a victory, there's nothing to celebrate."</TE>
<TE>   Stone asked neighboring El Paso County in December to investigate
whether Rohrbough was killed by a law officer. The results were presented
April 10 to the Jefferson County district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office and a lawyer for O'Shea did not
return phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   Rohrbough said Wednesday he regretted naming O'Shea in a lawsuit
claiming the officer mistakenly killed their son. The lawsuit, he said,
was based on information provided by Jefferson County.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Arrington, a lawyer for the Rohrbough family, noted that the
Jefferson County report set Daniel Rohrbough's death at a time when
O'Shea was known to be near the boy. That and other information led the
family to believe the high school freshman was caught in police gunfire.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the El Paso County report concluded that Rohrbough was
killed at least 36 minutes before O'Shea was even on the scene. It also
accounted for three spent shell casings that came from O'Shea's gun that
were found near the teen. The report said O'Shea was providing covering
fire for two policemen who were checking on Rohrbough.</TE>
<TE>   Rohrbough was in the cafeteria when the lunchtime rampage began. He
fled the school with two other boys. They inadvertently rushed straight
into Harris and Klebold, who were picking off students from the top of a
staircase outside the school.</TE>
<TE>   Rohrbough was hit by at least two bullets and fell to the sidewalk.
Then, according to the Jefferson County report, "Klebold goes back down
the stairs to the area outside the cafeteria and shoots Daniel Rohrbough
again at close range, killing him instantly."</TE>
<TE>   An autopsy included in the Jefferson County findings said one bullet
hit the teen in his left leg, a second entered his abdomen and lodged in
his chest and the third entered his chest and exited his upper back.</TE>
<TE>   The bullets that hit Rohrbough's chest and abdomen traveled upward,
the autopsy concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Rohrbough's parents first questioned the official account about a year
after their son's death.</TE>
<TE>   The distraught father began to pepper the Jefferson County Sheriff's
Office with questions: If Daniel was running away from Harris and
Klebold, how could he have been hit twice from the front? If the two
gunmen were standing on stairs above Daniel, how could the bullets enter
the boy's body in an upward trajectory? If Klebold delivered the fatal
shot from close range, why wasn't a bullet or fragment found near the
boy?</TE>
<TE>   All those questions were answered Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   According to the lead investigator, Cmdr. Joe Breister, Rohrbough was
hit in the leg first, causing him to spin around and face Harris. Harris
then fired two quick shots, hitting Rohrbough as he fell. He said that
the upward trajectory was explained by the angle of Rohrbough's falling
body.</TE>

<HD>Congress Rethinks Screening Deadline</HD>
<DH>Airports: Panel hears of soaring costs, allegations of waste at a
new agency charged with being able to check all luggage for explosives by
Dec. 31.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Stunned by a tripling in airport security costs, senior members of
Congress on Wednesday urged reconsideration of their own year-end
deadline for checking all bags for bombs.</LD>
<LD>   "Does the agency really take this committee to be a bunch of chumps,
or do you simply expect we are going to supinely provide blank checks?"
fumed Rep. David R. Obey (D-Wis.), questioning Transportation Department
witnesses during a contentious hearing.</LD>
<LD>   The exchange before a House panel that controls transportation
spending could mark a turning point in congressional support for
post-Sept. 11 security spending. The committee also heard criticism of
potentially wasteful practices and allegations of abuse of authority by
the new Transportation Security Administration, which in February took
over responsibility for security at the nation's airports.</LD>
<TE>Official Recommends Using Part-Time Help</TE>
<TE>   The Transportation Department's inspector general testified that the
new agency could save millions by using more part-time airport screeners
instead of relying chiefly on full-time workers. And local airport
officials complained that TSA has threatened to suspend air service to
communities that balk at using their own money for some federally
mandated security costs.</TE>
<TE>   TSA's budget estimate for this year has ballooned from $2.4 billion a
few months ago to $6.8 billion. Much of that is because of projections
that the agency will need as many as 72,000 new security employees, more
than double the original estimate of 30,000.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the additional workers would be required to meet the Dec. 31
congressional deadline for screening all checked bags using
explosive-detection technology. Checked baggage on domestic flights long
has been considered an easy target for terrorists. Congress wrote the
deadline into law because the Transportation Department is notoriously
slow in fulfilling its mandates.</TE>
<TE>   "If these deadlines are causing us to spend zillions, when if we
waited a couple of months it could be done for half that, then that's
worth talking about," said Rep. Harold Rogers (R-Ky.), chairman of the
House transportation appropriations subcommittee. Lawmakers said they
were misinformed about the costs when they voted in November to create
the agency.</TE>
<TE>   "Why, it's ridiculous," Rogers said. "We're not going to fund 72,000
people."</TE>
<TE>   "The American people want to do it right, rather than quickly," said
Rep. Carolyn C. Kilpatrick (D-Mich.). "We still have to fund education,
health care, housing and all the other priorities."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Transportation Secretary Michael Jackson used such terms as
"crushing" and "a forced march" to describe the deadline but said the
Bush administration intends to fulfill the congressional mandate.</TE>
<TE>   "Until otherwise instructed, this is one group of people who intend to
do the job," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   The new security agency promises to be bigger than the Federal
Aviation Administration or the Coast Guard. It will have more employees
than the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and Border Patrol combined.</TE>
<TE>   Inspector General Kenneth Mead testified that meeting the deadline
won't necessarily ensure the best system for detecting explosives in
checked baggage. "Do we blink on this Dec. 31 date together? Who blinks
first?"</TE>
<TE>   At the root of the problem is a choice about technology.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, there are two types of systems for detecting explosives.
The most advanced employs truck-size machines that cost $1 million each
and scan the insides of bags. The alternative is much less expensive,
costing about $45,000 per machine. But it can involve opening each bag
and taking a swab of the contents, a time-consuming process that requires
at least twice as many workers.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers already can see both systems at major airports. The
less-expensive system is used to check for explosives in shoes. It is
known as Trace, because it checks for volatile explosive residue. The
more expensive system uses CT scan technology--computed tomography--akin
to that employed by hospitals in diagnosing tumors.</TE>
<TE>   Not enough CT machines can be built to cover all 429 commercial
airports by Dec. 31, so planners are considering a combination of CT and
Trace systems. Because Trace is only 50% effective when used to check a
closed bag, industry and government officials say screeners will have to
open a large sample of bags to assure confidence in the system.</TE>
<TE>Texas Airport Can't Guarantee Compliance</TE>
<TE>   Jackson promised a decision soon on the final combination of CT and
Trace, but at least one major airport is unlikely to meet the deadline.
Jeffrey Fegan, chief executive of Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport, testified that he cannot guarantee that the systems can be
installed in time because the Transportation Department has taken too
long to decide. The airport had offered to raise $193 million to cover
the cost, but it needed a decision from Washington this week.</TE>
<TE>   Other local officials complained of bureaucratic bullying by the new
federal security agency.</TE>
<TE>   James Koslosky, airport director in Grand Rapids, Mich., said TSA had
threatened to suspend flights to a number of smaller airports unless
local governments paid for police officers to replace National Guard
troops at passenger checkpoints. "They just need to recognize that we're
not the enemy," Koslosky said of TSA.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers warned the administration that Congress "will not tolerate
dictatorial attitudes at TSA."</TE>
<TE>   But Jackson said he already had put a stop to such threats. "The idea
that we could stop flights is ludicrous--it's not going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Mead said TSA is not paying enough attention to its bottom line. The
agency will run out of money next month unless Congress approves a
$4.4-billion emergency funding request. Mead said TSA has just two clerks
to handle $250 million a month in bills from its contractors, and the
employees have no way to vouch for the accuracy of the accounts. And he
questioned why the agency plans to pay federal police officers who
eventually will be assigned to passenger checkpoints on the same scale as
FBI agents.</TE>

<HD>Some Savor and Others Choke on Taste of Summer in the East</HD>
<DH>Weather: Unseasonable heat sends ozone levels and power usage
soaring. Several records are set.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Summer-like heat shoved spring aside Wednesday across the Eastern
United States, setting several records, including in New York, where
power plant operators fearing blackouts urged large customers to conserve
electricity.</LD>
<LD>   The temperature reached 96 degrees in Manhattan's Central Park,
eclipsing the previous record for the date of 91 in 1976, and tying the
all-time record for April set the same year. At Newark International
Airport in New Jersey, the temperature hit 97, breaking the month's
record of 94, set in 1990.</LD>
<LD>   The unseasonable temperatures stretched from the Midwest to the
Eastern Seaboard, with record highs also in Concord, N.H., and Portland,
Maine. The National Weather Service said a high-pressure system anchored
off the East Coast brought warm air from the South to the New York
metropolitan area.</LD>
<TE>   The weather service issued a health advisory as ozone levels climbed,
adding to the misery in New York. Increased levels can cause respiratory
difficulties.</TE>
<TE>   "I am trying to stay cool by jumping on the bus and standing in the
back, where the air conditioning comes out," said Ray Garced, 28, a
process server. "The best thing to do is drink water or stay in a cool
bus."</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to be in Brazil, right next to the ocean," added Carl
Simmons, 48, a travel agent. "The New York beaches are too crowded for
me. I am a Caribbean water person."</TE>
<TE>   Standing in front of an office building, he held a cold soft drink in
his hands. "I am putting it in the freezer when I get upstairs to make it
even colder," Simmons said.</TE>
<TE>   On a nearby side street, an attorney who declined to give his name
opened the trunk of his car, which stood in the midday sun.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I work in a bakery right now," he said. "Today would be a
good day not to be working and [to be] in the Catskills under a shady
tree."</TE>
<TE>   Ice cream stores were crowded with customers seeking a respite, while
dry cleaners were busy with people rushing to get their spring and summer
clothes into shape.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people are coming in. It is beautiful weather outside," said
Jerry Guzman, 35, the manager of Sweet and Sour in midtown Manhattan. "It
is much better than when it is cold. It is good for business."</TE>
<TE>   Behind him, two clerks serving ice cream and frozen yogurt rang up a
steady stream of sales.</TE>
<TE>   The heat caught power system operators by surprise.</TE>
<TE>   The owners of skyscrapers and large industrial facilities were asked
by the New York Independent System Operator, which manages the power
grid, to turn down thermostats as air conditioning systems drove power
usage toward record levels.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the New York power pool said the unusual heat flared
at a time when many generating plants were offline for maintenance to
prepare for summer--when demand is predictably high.</TE>
<TE>   The weather service predicted the summer preview would start to fade
today, with temperatures in New York in the mid-80s. By Sunday,
thermometers are expected to register in the 60s.</TE>
<TE>   That friendly forecast was small consolation for Melissa Cohen, 27, a
pharmaceutical company representative who rested briefly on a bench
before continuing to carry two large sample cases to the offices of
physicians.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing slacks and a sleeveless tank top, she looked uncomfortable.</TE>
<TE>   "I love springtime in New York, and this clearly is not springtime,"
she said. "This is ridiculous. It's disgusting. I'm supposed to be in a
blazer, but it's too hot."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg presented a revised $42-billion
budget and warned that, without union concessions, $65 million in layoffs
would be necessary.</LD>
<LD>   The Republican mayor, who pledged during his campaign not to lay off
city workers, said the budget shortfall, projected at $5 billion for next
year, could grow to $6 billion by 2006.</LD>
<LD>   He also raised the possibility of a state takeover of city finances if
the City Council approves a tax increase.</LD>
<TE>   Critics say Bloomberg has reason to exaggerate the city's troubles, as
he wants unionized workers to accept $500 million in cost savings and
wants Albany and Washington to take steps that would let the city save
$650 million.</TE>

<HD>Parental OK on Abortion Again Clears House</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The House passed a bill Wednesday that would make it a crime for
anyone other than a parent to take a teenage girl across state lines for
an abortion, but Senate action appears unlikely.</LD>
<LD>   The vote was 260 to 161. It is the third time the House has passed the
bill, but the Senate has declined to take the measure up each time.
Senate aides say no action on the bill is expected this year.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty-seven states require one or both parents to be notified before
a minor can have an abortion. This bill would make it a crime for anyone
to take a girl younger than 17 across state lines to circumvent those
laws.</LD>
<TE>   Violators could face a $100,000 fine and up to a year in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Backers of the bill, sponsored by Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.),
said parents have to give their consent for any other medical procedure,
even getting an aspirin from a school nurse, and should also be involved
with abortion.</TE>

<HD>High Court Weighs Prison Cruelty Case</HD>
<DH>Law: At issue is whether tying an inmate to a post is cruel and
unusual punishment and, if so, can the guards be sued.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In 1689, the English Bill of Rights prohibited "cruel and unusual
punishments," partly in response to a notorious case of a defrocked
clergyman who had been put in the stocks and whipped.</LD>
<LD>   A century later, the ban on "cruel and unusual punishment" was added
to the U.S. Constitution, and the Supreme Court in 1909 described the
pillory and the whipping post as the kind of penalties that were
"banished" by public opinion and "forbidden as cruel and unusual
punishment."</LD>
<LD>   But in the mid-1990s, Alabama reinstituted chain gangs for prisoners
and permitted guards to handcuff difficult inmates to a metal rod known
as the "hitching post."</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the Supreme Court took up the case of Larry Hope, an
inmate who received such treatment on a hot day seven years ago. The
justices will decide whether he had been subjected to cruel and unusual
punishment and, if so, whether his guards can be forced to pay damages
for violating his constitutional rights. The Bush administration has
taken Hope's side in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Accused by his guards of disrupting a work crew, Hope spent seven
hours standing in the sun on June 7, 1995, handcuffed to the pole.
Because his hands and arms were fastened at shoulder height, his wrists
became bruised and swollen. Guards had removed his shirt. Hope also went
at least three hours without water, although he says guards did bring
water for the dogs that were watching over him. He also had no bathroom
breaks for most of his time on the post.</TE>
<TE>   After being released from prison, Hope sued several of the guards.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals handed down a split
decision in Hope's case. It ruled that Hope had suffered cruel and
unusual punishment, but it threw out his lawsuit against the guards,
saying they could not be sued because of the legal principle of qualified
immunity.</TE>
<TE>   Under that principle, the Supreme Court has said, police and other law
enforcement officers can be sued only for violating a "clearly
established" constitutional right.</TE>
<TE>   And the Alabama prison guards argue that they cannot be held liable in
Hope's case because the Supreme Court has never said that handcuffing
someone to a fence or a post is unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   The justices have struggled in the abstract with defining what is
cruel and unusual punishment, but most of them seemed to have no doubt
Wednesday that Hope's ordeal qualified.</TE>
<TE>   This was not about "quelling a riot" or using force to maintain order
in prison, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg told an Alabama state lawyer. This
was "strictly a form of punishment," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Nathan Forrester, the state's solicitor, denied that it was
punishment. Inmates who were "disruptive" or refused to work were cuffed
to the pole, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Stephen G. Breyer interrupted him in an angry tone. "Would any
human being know that [it is cruel and unusual punishment] if you stand
someone in the sun, without water, arms over his head?"</TE>
<TE>   Forrester said Hope's hands were not over his head. "His hands were
chest high," the state's lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   "So the state could legally keep him hanging to this rod? Hours on
end? No water?" asked Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.</TE>
<TE>   "And no bathroom breaks?" added Justice John Paul Stevens.</TE>
<TE>   "And that's the state's position? That's just fine?" O'Connor said.</TE>
<TE>   Only Justice Antonin Scalia came to the state's defense.</TE>
<TE>   "What was the prison supposed to do? He was disrupting the work crew,"
Scalia told Hope's lawyer, Craig T. Jones of Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Jones responded that Hope had not been disruptive. A guard had grabbed
him by the throat for sleeping on the bus, and their fight prompted the
guards to handcuff Hope to the rod, he said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Solicitor General Theodore Olson sided with Hope, saying the law
was clear that guards cannot chain prisoners to fences or railings. "No
reasonable officer could have thought that the prolonged, painful and
punitive use of the hitching post that allegedly occurred on June 7,
1995, was lawful," Olson said in his brief to the court.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama was the only state in the nation to use the hitching post, he
said. (The state discontinued its use in 1998.) More than 20 years ago, a
federal appeals court in New Orleans had condemned Mississippi's prison
guards for handcuffing inmates to cells for long periods of time, and
that ruling should have put Alabama's officials on notice, Olson said.</TE>
<TE>   But lawyers for 15 states--California was not among them--joined
Alabama in urging the court to say that guards should be immune from
lawsuits unless they cause "serious harm" to an inmate, such as
inflicting permanent injury. In this case, Hope may have suffered pain
and discomfort, but he was not permanently injured, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Police and prison guards need to make "split-second decisions" and
should not face personal lawsuits over their actions, said Gene Schaerr,
an attorney representing the other states.</TE>
<TE>   "This was not split-second. We're talking about seven hours here,"
O'Connor responded.</TE>
<TE>   The justices have between now and late June to spell out the law in
the case of Hope vs. Pelzer, 01-309.</TE>

<HD>Trying Times for Providence's Mayor</HD>
<DH>Prosecution: 'Buddy' Cianci gamely keeps boosting his city as jury
selection begins in his racketeering case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PROVIDENCE, R.I.
</DL>
<LD>Never had Mayor Vincent A. Cianci Jr. been so thrilled to hear a
talk on "the health-care paradigm shift."</LD>
<LD>   "What a relief," Cianci quipped at a luncheon Wednesday, especially
after spending the morning at jury selection in his federal racketeering
trial.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's longest-serving mayor--known to one and all in his
hometown by his childhood nickname, Buddy--faces 29 felony counts of
racketeering, conspiracy, extortion, bribery, mail fraud and witness
tampering. Along with charges that he took kickbacks from businesses and
private citizens alike, Cianci is charged with muscling a free lifetime
membership out of a swank downtown club that once snubbed him.</LD>
<TE>   Cianci, a one-man cheering section for Providence, insists not only
that he is innocent but also that he was set up by crooked associates and
federal agents who conducted a covert probe called Operation Plunder
Dome. At every opportunity, whether at the White House or the local YMCA,
Cianci prefers to talk about how he turned a drab, industrial city into a
glittering showpiece, with gondolas and a legendary light show on a
revitalized riverfront.</TE>
<TE>   In the process, the federal government counters, Cianci made off like
the proverbial bandit. Prosecutors contend that by "defrauding the
citizens of Providence of the honest services of its public officials,"
Cianci and three co-defendants essentially turned City Hall into a sieve
for their personal enrichment, taking more than $1.5 million during the
1990s.</TE>
<TE>Half in Providence Think Mayor's Guilty</TE>
<TE>   A recent Brown University poll showed that 50% of those surveyed here
think the mayor is guilty. Yet Cianci, who turns 61 later this month, is
beloved in Providence, not only for his boosterism but also for his
more-than-colorful personality. The same poll showed that 64% of those
questioned think Cianci is doing a swell job as mayor.</TE>
<TE>   With his remarkable assortment of toupees--they have been getting
grayer in recent years, to make him look more distinguished--and his
shameless promotion of "The Mayor's Own Marinara Sauce," Cianci is an
endless source of diversion in Providence.</TE>
<TE>   He lives in the presidential suite of a downtown hotel and once got
his bodyguard to assault his estranged wife's boyfriend with a fireplace
poker. Cianci holds court at one of several boites on Federal Hill, a
neighborhood that once swam in red sauce but now claims some of the
hottest eating establishments in America.</TE>
<TE>   Publicly, Cianci has been almost nonchalant about a federal trial that
is expected to last until July, even suggesting last week that he should
see about getting a tourism grant for all the economic benefits the event
is bringing in.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he could face at least 30 years in prison if found guilty--and
many here think a conviction is likely. As Providence Journal political
columnist M. Charles Bakst wrote this week: "People will have to open
their minds to the possibility that a very entertaining mayor is also a
bum."</TE>
<TE>   His trial comes at a moment when at least five other mayors across the
country are under indictment on federal charges. From Cicero, Ill., to
Beaumont, Texas, to nearby Bridgeport, Conn., urban leaders are battling
accusations ranging from corruption to conspiracy to statutory rape.</TE>
<TE>   But Providence is the largest of those cities--and Cianci is arguably
the most flamboyant of the mayors.</TE>
<TE>   His lawyers hope he will be helped by the fact that surveillance tapes
do not show Cianci taking or soliciting bribes. But under federal law,
prosecutors need only show that his deputies took money for Cianci--and
with his full knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   In court Wednesday, Judge Ernest C. Torres made a point of telling
prospective jurors to expect none of the circus-like antics that have
characterized some other high-profile trials.</TE>
<TE>   "I can assure you, this will not be anything like the O.J. Simpson
trial," Torres said.</TE>
<TE>   He told jurors they would not be sequestered. But Torres has imposed a
gag order applying to all participants in the trial. In the opening phase
of jury selection Wednesday, the judge read off a list of close to 200
prospective witnesses.</TE>
<TE>Pleaded No Contest to Domestic Assault</TE>
<TE>   First elected in 1974, Cianci has been mayor for all but six years
since then. He began political life as a Republican but shifted to being
an independent after a hiatus following the fireplace poker incident.
Although he did not serve time, Cianci pleaded no contest to domestic
assault. He stepped down as mayor, using his time off to become the
city's most popular radio talk show host.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago, Cianci moved back into City Hall with a firm
endorsement from the electorate. He has encountered little political
opposition, but a popular Democratic state representative recently seized
the opportunity of Cianci's 98-page indictment and trial to mount an
energetic campaign for the mayor's job.</TE>
<TE>   Losing the mayoralty would do more than destroy Cianci's career, said
Brown University political science professor Darrell West.</TE>
<TE>   "He lives for the public adulation," West said. But "if he is found
guilty, his political career is over and he is publicly humiliated. This
will be so devastating for him personally, if he is found
guilty--everything that he has built will evaporate."</TE>
<TE>   West, like many observers here, thinks it is unlikely that Cianci will
walk away.</TE>
<TE>   "There are 29 counts here," he pointed out. "The feds basically have
to win on only one."</TE>
<TE>   During the court's lunch break Wednesday, Cianci hopped into the back
seat of his official car, a Lincoln Town Car, and headed to a luncheon
for the Rhode Island Urban League. Business as usual: Cianci was chatty
and even made a joke at his own expense, congratulating his hosts for
getting "so much press for the Urban League."</TE>
<TE>   But his temper showed slightly when a reporter asked whether the trial
was interfering with his schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "No," sniffed Cianci. "But you are."</TE>
<TE>   Jury selection is expected to take one to three weeks.</TE>

<HD>Museum Plan Hits Too Close to Home</HD>
<DH>Dispute: Space-hungry N.Y. tenement exhibit seeks to evict tenement
neighbors. 'The irony just smacks you in the face,' opponent says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>They were once joined at the hip in the heart of New York's Lower
East Side, two identical brick tenements offering cheap, dimly lit
apartments to waves of immigrants from all over the world.</LD>
<LD>   But they came to play different roles in the community: One was turned
into a museum celebrating the area's immigrant history. The other is home
to 15 families, as well as a popular Chinese restaurant on the ground
floor.</LD>
<LD>   And now, in a move that has some shaking their heads, the museum is
attempting to evict the people who live and work next door--many of them
immigrants--so it can expand and accommodate more tourists.</LD>
<TE>   "The irony just smacks you in the face," said Martha Danziger, a
community leader who opposes the Lower East Side Tenement Museum's bid to
take over the adjacent building. "They want to create a virtual tenement
museum in a neighborhood that already has tenements."</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1863, the twin walk-ups at 97 and 99 Orchard St. were
fixtures in a neighborhood that welcomed Irish, German, Jewish, Italian,
Puerto Rican and Chinese families. Yet now, as booming property values
transform the area, the feud between the buildings' owners highlights a
battle over the community's future--and its place in America's immigrant
memory.</TE>
<TE>   This is a street where living history collides with living people.</TE>
<TE>   Opened in 1988, the Tenement Museum is a national landmark that has
restored turn-of-the-century immigrant apartments to their original
conditions and draws 90,000 visitors each year. Ruth Abram, the founder,
says she wants to welcome 200,000 tourists and can only do this by
acquiring the building next door. She has asked state officials to seize
the property through eminent domain if a deal cannot be worked out.</TE>
<TE>   But Lou Holzman, whose family members have been living at 99 Orchard
St. since 1910, has no intention of selling the building. Neither does
his business partner, Peter Liang, who runs the Congee Village restaurant
and employs more than 50 Chinese and Latino immigrant workers. Both say
the use of eminent domain to help a small museum would be absurd.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy to sympathize with the two sides, so the question is, which
view of the Lower East Side do you embrace?" said sociologist Christopher
Mele, author of "Selling the Lower East Side." "Is this area a gold mine
of immigrant history that should be preserved? Or is it a living,
breathing place filled with new and older immigrants who should be
protected?"</TE>
<TE>Eminent Domain Decision Nears</TE>
<TE>   Tensions are rising on both sides as the Empire State Development
Corp., New York state's economic development agency, nears a
decision--expected this week--on whether to proceed with the eminent
domain. And the dispute is playing out against a steady drumbeat of
gentrification that is rapidly changing the community from a
crime-infested slum into an edgy but vibrant melting pot of bars,
boutiques and restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   The Lower East Side is a study in contrast. While it continues to pack
waves of new immigrants, mainly Chinese, into tenements, the once-rundown
buildings of the nearby Bowery are being turned into million-dollar
co-ops. The average rent at 99 Orchard St. is $1,600 for a
350-square-foot apartment--a price that is high but hardly atypical,
given Manhattan's tight rental housing market.</TE>
<TE>   Bordered on the north by 14th Street, on the south by Fulton and
Franklin streets and running west from Broadway to the East River, the
neighborhood is growing economically, despite the effects of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   While Latino groups push for more affordable housing and criticize the
trend toward higher-priced apartments, young Orthodox Jewish couples have
begun moving back into the aging, high-rise units that were once occupied
by their grandparents. On a recent afternoon, the sidewalk shops and
restaurants near Orchard Street were filled with the aromas of garlic
kosher pickles, fresh-baked empanadas and pungent Chinese congee.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of America's most symbolic neighborhoods," said historian
Suzanne Wasserman, associate director of the Gotham Center at City
University of New York. "It's constantly reinventing itself, and many
groups see it as sacred because so many people can trace their roots back
to this community. Everybody wants a piece of the Lower East Side."</TE>
<TE>   The community is no stranger to controversy. As immigrants poured in
during the late 19th century, it became America's prototype of a big-city
slum. Journalist Jacob Riis wrote his powerful newspaper expose "How the
Other Half Lives" after visiting the squalid area in 1890. Ever since
then, activists have been drawn to a neighborhood that was the first
glimpse of America for millions of people who got off the boat at Ellis
Island.</TE>
<TE>   Abram said her overriding goal is to promote tolerance for the
different kinds of people who have lived on Orchard Street--and to use
history as a tool to better understand the present.</TE>
<TE>Building Offers Guided Tours</TE>
<TE>   The narrow, six-story building offers guided tours of meticulously
restored apartments that were occupied by poor immigrant families dating
from 1897. The museum also sponsors film festivals, walking tours and
community forums on social issues, including the problems of Garment
District workers on the Lower East Side and America's historical
perceptions of poverty.</TE>
<TE>   "We want people to understand how hard it must have been to come to
America and live in such small apartments," Abram said. "But I worry that
a lot of the people who come away moved by the experience of Jewish and
Italian families leave the museum and then look down on the Chinese and
Hispanic people who live in the same neighborhood today."</TE>
<TE>   It is this very attitude, however, that infuriates her opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's a museum that wants to promote the history of immigration and
educate people," Holzman said. "But it proposes to do this evicting
tenants and throwing 50 immigrants out of work. It makes no sense."</TE>
<TE>   Many New Yorkers fled the Lower East Side in the 1960s and '70s, when
the area was filthy and dangerous. Yet Holzman is proud that he stayed
because his family has roots here.</TE>
<TE>   Holzman once ran a jazz and rock recording studio in the building, but
he recently formed a partnership with Liang to renovate the property. The
six-story tenement's living quarters, which had been closed for years,
reopened last fall.</TE>
<TE>   As the owners spruced up 99 Orchard St., Abram was feeling growing
pains next door. She said she badly needed additional space--in part to
build an elevator so disabled visitors could enjoy the museum--and had
been attempting for some time to buy Holzman's building. But he had no
interest in selling.</TE>
<TE>   A nasty feud erupted two years ago, when Abram charged that the
renovation next door had structurally damaged the foundation of the
Tenement Museum. She sought help from political allies wherever she could
find them.</TE>
<TE>   "The state responded, and we were just so relieved," Abram said,
noting that the Empire State Development Corp. agreed to consider taking
Holzman's building through eminent domain.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is highly unusual for a private entity to request such
action, it is not unheard of.</TE>
<TE>   Once initiated, eminent domain proceedings are rarely overturned, and
Holzman's main challenge would be over the price to be paid for his
property. Although the museum once offered to buy his building for $1.3
million, he said the full value of a newly renovated 99 Orchard St. is
between $7 million and $10 million.</TE>
<TE>'A Matter of Public Need'</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the final price, Abram said, the condemnation is "a matter of
public need," no different than previous seizures of land for public
purposes such as freeways and large commercial projects.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, she added, state law had prevented her from speaking
publicly about the eminent domain proposal until it was announced in
December. And by then new tenants had moved into Holzman's building. If
the building is condemned, Abram said, tenants will be helped to find new
homes; they will also be compensated for moving expenses.</TE>
<TE>   "It was so unfair for this to happen to the people who just got here,"
said Suzy Lease, 25, a waitress who moved in last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Many observers wish that the two sides could have worked out some kind
of accommodation. While Abram insists she must have 99 Orchard St.,
others ask why the museum couldn't have looked for tenement property
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "In almost any other neighborhood, this would be a simple real estate
dispute," said Hasia Diner, a New York University history professor and
author of "Lower East Side Memories." "But there is so much communal
memory in this area. It's become a collision over sacred space."</TE>

</DL>
<LD>The task of defending the continental United States from terrorist
attacks will be brought under a single military command beginning Oct. 1
as part of a major restructuring, the Pentagon announced Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The new operation, dubbed Northern Command, will put a four-star
general in charge of protecting U.S. territory, including coastal waters,
and organizes the military for the first time to defend against threats
emanating from inside the country.</LD>
<LD>   The command will be charged with protecting domestic airspace and
managing the military's response to natural disasters, as well as
chemical, biological, nuclear and other attacks, defense officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Under the existing arrangement set up after World War II,
responsibility for U.S. territory was shared by numerous commands.
Homeland defense was a bureaucratic stepchild.</TE>
<TE>   But since Sept. 11, the defense of U.S. territory has become a
pressing priority, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld noted in
outlining the creation of Northern Command and other changes to the
military's unified command plan.</TE>
<TE>   He said the new command would "defend the American people where they
live" against possible threats from "the world's most irresponsible
regimes."</TE>
<TE>   Until now, the Pentagon has divided its war-fighting responsibilities
around the world into four geographically based command operations:
European; Pacific; Central, with responsibility for much of the Middle
East; and Southern, which oversees military operations in the Western
hemisphere.</TE>
<TE>   Northern Command will have responsibility for the continental United
States, Alaska, Canada, Mexico, portions of the Caribbean, and contiguous
waters of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans extending 500 miles from shore.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush is expected to nominate Air Force Gen. Ralph Eberhart
as its first commander. It will likely be headquartered at Peterson Air
Force Base in Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Air Force Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said that decisions have yet to be made on which U.S.-based forces
will be overseen by Northern Command.</TE>
<TE>   Among the open questions are control of the Coast Guard, which in
peacetime is part of the Department of Transportation, and of a proposed
U.S. missile defense system, possibly based in Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld stressed that the new command is designed to unify existing
military functions--including the use of Air Force jets patrolling U.S.
cities and Navy ships running coastal checks--rather than to increase the
mission of the military in homeland defense.</TE>
<TE>   The Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law crafted to curtail the use of
Army soldiers in law enforcement after the Civil War, forbids the
military from engaging in police activities "except in cases or under
circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of
Congress."</TE>
<TE>   The law has been viewed as severely limiting actions the military can
take on U.S. soil. As a result, the Pentagon has always played a
supporting role to civil authorities when disasters of man or of nature
have struck--and has sometimes failed to respond fast enough.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably if you looked back at how the [Defense] Department responded
to needs up in New York after the World Trade Center, you might find
that, while not confusion, there was not good unity of effort in that
case," Myers said.</TE>
<TE>   The military has struggled since Sept. 11 to determine how much
authority it has to operate at home. It has directed a team of military
lawyers at the Joint Forces Command in Norfolk, Va., to assess the reach
of the Posse Comitatus Act.</TE>
<TE>   Northern Command will have overall responsibility within the military
for homeland defense. On the civilian side, it will coordinate with the
White House's Office of Homeland Defense.</TE>
<TE>   "The creation of Northern Command is significant because it will
concentrate many of the military assets that would be required to support
homeland defense under one operational four-star commander; and
traditionally inside the Pentagon, that is when a mission finally gets
the sort of resourcing and attention it deserves," said Michele Flournoy,
who served in the Defense Department under President Clinton.</TE>

<HD>Judge Rules Boston's Cardinal Law Must Answer Attorney's Questions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAMBRIDGE, Mass.
</DL>
<LD>A judge said Wednesday that Cardinal Bernard Law must answer an
attorney's questions about his handling of the case of a priest accused
of sexual abuse.</LD>
<LD>   The request to depose Law involves a lawsuit against the cardinal and
the Boston archdiocese over abuse allegations against the Rev. Paul
Shanley.</LD>
<LD>   The judge scheduled the deposition for June 5.</LD>
<TE>   Law has been under increasing pressure to resign since about 850 pages
in Shanley's personnel files were turned over by the archdiocese to
attorney Roderick MacLeish and later made public.</TE>
<TE>   The records detailed Shanley's advocacy for sex between men and boys
as well as his transfer to several parishes by the archdiocese, despite
claims of child sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   A lawyer for Shanley, Frank Mondano, appeared in court Wednesday,
joining the archdiocese to argue that medical records are confidential.
Judge Leila Kearns set a May 1 hearing on that issue.</TE>
<TE>   Kearns rejected a motion by archdiocese attorney Wilson Rogers Jr. to
dismiss the lawsuit on constitutional grounds of separation of church and
state.</TE>
<TE>   MacLeish represents 120 plaintiffs suing priests, the archdiocese and
Law.</TE>

<HD>Jail Rules for Moussaoui Necessary, Prosecutors Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.
</DL>
<LD>A suspected Al Qaeda terrorist is justifiably confined under the
tightest restrictions so he will not escape, assault his jailers or send
coded messages to Osama bin Laden operatives, prosecutors said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Responding to Zacarias Moussaoui's claim that he was too isolated to
aid his defense, the government asked a judge to oppose the defendant's
"efforts atmicromanaging the prison."</LD>
<LD>   Moussaoui, a French citizen, is the only person charged in connection
with the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and the Pentagon and could face the
death penalty.</LD>
<TE>   His "commitment to join a deadly war against American civilians" won't
be stopped by his imprisonment, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. said it would allow Moussaoui computer access in a secure
room, not in his cell as he requested.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema has scheduled a hearing for Monday
on Moussaoui's request.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui wants a larger cell with a laptop, a table and chair;
CD-ROMs that would not be searched; telephone access to attorneys without
being overheard; a ban on searches of his books, papers, computer and
other defense preparation materials; a ban on recording conversations
with counsel; and the right for a "Mr. Doe" to visit in the presence of
counsel, who would not be identified to the government.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui is charged with conspiring to commit terrorism, destroy
aircraft, use airplanes as weapons of mass destruction and murder U.S.
employees.</TE>

<HD>Doctor Testifies on Gunman's Prozac Use</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAMBRIDGE, Mass.
</DL>
<LD>A man on trial for killing seven co-workers tripled his dosage of
Prozac before the shootings, a move that may have heightened his rage and
sparked the shooting spree, a defense psychiatrist testified Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Anthony Joseph said Michael McDermott suffers from paranoid
schizophrenia and other mental disorders that made him unable to
understand that what he was doing was wrong when he opened fire at
Edgewater Technology on Dec. 26, 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors contend McDermott killed his colleagues because he was
angry over the company's decision to withhold some of his salary to pay
back taxes.</LD>
<TE>   But Joseph said McDermott told him that he had increased his dosage of
Prozac by Dec. 1, first from 70 milligrams a day to 140 milligrams, and
then to 210 milligrams. Joseph said McDermott increased the dosage
without his doctor's permission or advice.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very possible that Prozac is the final piece of the puzzle that
explains the level of rage and anger that allowed the killings to occur,"
Joseph said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Prozac acts as an antidepressant, potential side effects
include restlessness, agitation, psychosis, rage, anger and violence.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph acknowledged he could not say to "a reasonable degree of
medical certainty" what effect the dosage had on McDermott.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors planned to cross-examine Joseph today. They also planned
to call witnesses to support a theory that McDermott concocted an
elaborate tale to make himself look insane to the jury.</TE>
<TE>   On the witness stand last week, McDermott, a 43-year-old software
engineer, said he believed he killed Nazis and not his co-workers.</TE>
<TE>   He said an archangel appeared to him before the killings and told him
he could prevent the Holocaust and earn a soul if he traveled back in
time to 1940 and killed Adolf Hitler and six German generals.</TE>

<HD>70 Philadelphia Schools Go Private</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA
</DL>
<LD>Seventy of the city's more than 200 public elementary and middle
schools were handed over to private companies, nonprofits and parent
groups Wednesday as part of a sweeping management reform plan.</LD>
<LD>   The School Reform Commission, created by the state after it seized
control of the city's public school system in December, voted 3 to 2 in
favor of the plan.</LD>
<LD>   The two dissenting votes came from the appointees of Mayor John
Street, whose appointed school board was abolished in the state takeover.</LD>
<TE>   "I am greatly concerned that the magnitude of the change being
proposed is too ambitious at this point," said commissioner Michael
Masch.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not intend to be obstructionist here. We're going to work along
with the SRC," Street said.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Daniel Whelan, one of three appointees of Gov. Mark
Schweiker, said the schools are in need of aggressive reform,
immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the schools selected for takeover are in North and West
Philadelphia, the city's two poorest neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   The decision came over the objections of unions, students and some
parents.</TE>
<TE>   "We want off the [takeover] list, and if someone does come in, we want
them to be people who know the community and who understand us, not some
outsiders thinking about their profits," said Gladys Ortiz, mother of
three elementary school students.</TE>
<TE>   About two dozen students spent Tuesday night camped outside the city's
school administration building, then formed a human chain and refused to
allow anyone inside Wednesday morning. The commission responded by moving
the meeting to another building several blocks away.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan, the commission will bring in seven groups to operate
the schools, including three of the nation's largest private managers of
public schools: Edison Schools, Chancellor Beacon Academies and Victory
Schools.</TE>

<HD>Texas Death Row Inmate's Appeal to State Court Rejected, Stay
Lifted</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AUSTIN, Texas
</DL>
<LD>A state court on Wednesday rejected an appeal filed by a man who
was sentenced to death for a killing carried out when he was 17. The
appeals court also lifted a stay of execution it had granted while
reviewing the case.</LD>
<LD>   Napoleon Beazley, who was four hours away from execution when he won
the stay in August, was convicted of murdering 63-year-old John Luttig, a
prominent Tyler businessman and the father of a federal judge.</LD>
<LD>   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejected all of the issues Beazley
raised in challenging his conviction and sentence.</LD>
<TE>   Beazley's attorney, Walter Long, said he would appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court and ask the state pardons board to commute Beazley's
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   The case drew international attention because of Beazley's age at the
time of the April 19, 1994, slaying and because of J. Michael Luttig's
position as a federal judge in Virginia. Beazley's trial judge, Cynthia
Kent, and 18 state representatives had asked Gov. Rick Perry to commute
his sentence to life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   In Texas, the death penalty is applicable if the defendant was 17 or
older at the time of the crime.</TE>

<HD>3 Winning Tickets Sold in $325-Million Lottery</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA
</DL>
<LD>A young woman claimed a third of the $325-million Big Game jackpot
Wednesday and said it was the first time she had ever played the
multi-state lottery. Two other winning tickets were sold in Illinois and
New Jersey, but there were no immediate claimants.</LD>
<LD>   Erika Greene, 20, said she spent $10 on tickets. "That's all the money
I had on me," she told reporters.</LD>
<LD>   About two hours before Tuesday night's drawing, Greene bought her
tickets at a convenience store in the small northern Georgia town of
Dacula, about two miles from her home.</LD>
<TE>   She said she selected numbers on one ticket and let the computer pick
the nine others. One of the computer-generated numbers had the winning
combination--07, 10, 25, 26, 27 and bonus number 23.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the three winning tickets is worth $108,333,333 in the
second-largest jackpot in U.S. history. Big Game ticket buyers can choose
payments over 26 years or a smaller, onetime sum; because Greene opted
for the single payout, her winnings would be about $58 million, lottery
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Greene said she planned to have someone else handle the money for her.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to invest it and spend it wisely," said Greene, who works
at a cell phone office. "I'm not going to work, no. I'm going to invest
and let the money work for me."</TE>
<TE>   She arrived at the lottery office in a stretch limousine with her
boyfriend and her mother. She said she planned to buy a car and a house,
but had no plans after that.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Lottery Corp. President Rebecca Paul said she could not
immediately confirm that Greene held the winning ticket, but the
convenience store manager, Neerej Dutta, said Greene had already showed
it to him. Dacula is about 30 miles northeast of Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Illinois state lottery officials said a winning ticket was sold at a
gas station in Burbank, a suburb southwest of Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "I sure hope it's one of my regulars," said Speedway gas station
manager Debbie Murnane.</TE>
<TE>   Jan Reichard said that when she and other employees sold tickets for
the drawing, "we were teasing them that we wanted Cadillacs."</TE>
<TE>   The third ticket matching all five numbers and the Big Money ball was
sold in New Jersey's Union County, lottery officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The odds of winning were 76 million to 1.</TE>
<TE>   The Big Game is played in Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan, New Jersey and Virginia. Its largest jackpot was in 2000, when
two winners split $363 million.</TE>
<TE>   The game is going to get even bigger next month when New York and Ohio
join and the name is changed to Mega Millions. Washington state also
plans to join in September.</TE>
