<LD>I have a screenwriter friend who has just turned 40 and is already
making plans for the disposal of his body after his death. Call him
Otto.</LD>
<LD>   He has drawn up a will and has asked for brochures from the
Neptune Society, an organization that will arrange for cremation at a
reasonable price.</LD>
<LD>   Otto is in fairly good health, but he is convinced that his life
is essentially over. At least his productive life. Nobody wants to
hire old guys like him to write scripts when there are so many
talented 15-year-olds around.</LD>
<TE>   His obsession with life's end began as a joke based on statistics
by the Writers Guild of America that reveal how a writer's ability to
get work in show biz declines steadily after he or she reaches the
age of 40.</TE>
<TE>   It is a kind of psychological cutoff that lends validity to Jack
Benny's old running gag in which he was forever 39. Life does not
begin at 40 in Hollywood. It ends.</TE>
<TE>   After entering the fourth decade of his life, Otto claimed that
producers and network executives began looking at him in a different
way when he went in to pitch a story. And he began looking at them in
a different way.</TE>
<TE>   "I hallucinated that they were babies in sandboxes with little
shovels in their hands," he said to me one day. "They were drooling
and saying ba-ba and goo-goo as I laid out a story line. What's
happening here?"</TE>
<TE>   That's obvious. We're living longer but getting older sooner.</TE>
<TE>   I can understand Otto's growing obsession with the idea that his
life is over. I wrote movies, pilots and episodes for television for
20 years before I was replaced by what is known in the industry as
"hot young writers" with hot young ideas based on sex, violence and
flatulence.</TE>
<TE>   I was doing it part time, realizing with some degree of wisdom
that there is no permanency in show biz. I never gave up my day job.
But people like Otto devote their lives to telling stories for the
tube and the screen, believing that age and experience will be
respected elements of creativity. Dreams don't die when you reach 40,
except in the undiscerning minds of network executives.</TE>
<TE>   I was discussing this the other day with Ann Marcus, one of
television's premier writers, who, at 80, has been dumped on to
Hollywood's trash heap. Forget that she can't get work. She can't
even get an agent.</TE>
<TE>   Marcus is among about 150 writers who have filed
age-discrimination suits against 23 networks, production companies
and talent agencies, claiming that they won't give work to writers
over 40. The suits are pending in L.A. County Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   A woman with more credits than would fit in any one column, she
has been honored with an Emmy, several Emmy nominations and a
distinguished service award by the Writers Guild. She co-created and
was head writer for the satirical evening soap opera series "Mary
Hartman, Mary Hartman" in the days when satire still had a market.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years, she's written an autobiography and a
screenplay, and a mountain of scripts and outlines that are ready to
be offered whenever anyone is willing to listen. Earlier this year,
her new play, "Waiting for Betty Friedan," opened at the Theater East
in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   But she's considered too old for television, and no doubt
physically unable to crawl down to the abysmal level of its current
standards.</TE>
<TE>   Marcus was one of nine WGA members who came up with the idea of
challenging the gray wall that keeps older writers out of the loop.</TE>
<TE>   "Some writers were afraid to be a part of it," she said sitting
across from me in the Sherman Oaks home she has occupied for 35
years. "I'm not. I'm old, I have a good pension and a 40-year career
behind me. How can they hurt me?"</TE>
<TE>   An energetic woman with intense blue eyes, she bristles at the
fact that the gray barrier has prevented her from competing in the
world of television production.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a vicious circle," she said. "You can't get a job without an
agent and you can't get an agent because you can't get work."</TE>
<TE>   For a moment, she sits in silence, a still life in a room that
sings of her success: the golden Emmy on a shelf, framed credits on
the wall, copies of her book on a desk, and all those scripts,
outlines and ideas on a table.</TE>
<TE>   Then she says, as though addressing a meeting of those who won't
listen, "I have ideas! I've lived a lifetime!" And, more quietly, "I
want to contribute...."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood, in a general sense, is locked into the notion that only
younger writers possess the energy to project excitement in a movie,
which is why we have so many buildings that explode on the screen and
so many cars that crash and burn. Subtlety explodes with the
buildings, and nuances perish in the flaming cars.</TE>
<TE>   I feel especially sorry for people like Otto. There's little hope
that a lawsuit, even if successful, will alter the state of mind that
has built the gray wall. Without acne and braces, the guy hasn't got
a chance.</TE>

<LD>ANYTHING GOES</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By Madison Smartt Bell</LD>
<TE>   Pantheon</TE>
<TE>   308 pages, $24</TE>
<TE>   Jesse, at 20, is already a four-year veteran bass player in a
bush-league band. "Anything Goes" is his laconic account of one
turning-point season on the road, as the plus-or-minus four-man group
follows the sun on an East Coast track from Nashville to Key West,
Fla., and come summer, north to Vermont, serving up eclectic,
home-brewed sets of rock-blues-country-pop in back-street dives.</TE>
<TE>   Anything Goes just happens to be this band's name, cited
straight-faced, with nary a nod to Cole Porter until the novel's
sweet end.</TE>
<TE>   Nashville-raised, blue-collar Jesse is on the slight-but-athletic
side, pretty-faced, cool as icy mint tea and fairly irresistible to
the awfully young and available girls he tries, at least on
guilt-stricken mornings after, not to take entirely for granted. Like
his kind of music, Jesse seems to exist mainly in and for the
present. The future's on hold: "I knew plenty of guys who played in
bands that from the way they talked and acted had just as soon be
swinging a nine-pound hammer.... Only I didn't have no other ideas
either."</TE>
<TE>   As for the past, he gives no last name, nor details of his
motherless childhood, apart from some ugly recollections of his
father's brutal beatings. This absence leaves a reader to puzzle over
how Jesse came by the unusual "voice" of this novel, a language that
combines hick grammar with a vocabulary that keeps words like "ochre"
and "deferential" within easy reach. It's a beguiling blend,
reminiscent of Denis Johnson's lyrically gifted protagonists,
uncommon in life.</TE>
<TE>   Jesse's youth--his fervent coolness and wonder at the still-fresh
world--is entirely convincing. In presenting Jesse, critically
acclaimed author Madison Smartt Bell ("Master of the Crossroads") has
artfully effaced himself.</TE>
<TE>   Structurally, "Anything Goes" builds episodically, as a picaresque
journey, with an added boost from concept rather than through much
knotting and twisting of plot. "Anything Goes" touches all the
traditional bases of the coming-of-age subgenre. For openers, there
is the hero's jaded cluelessness: The first chapter is titled "Never
Mind." It's a guy's world, in which women are lovely or witchy
ciphers, and the real, complex relationships are those that bind
buddies. There is discipleship to be served under a peevish guru,
eventually to be recognized as an ersatz father: the band's founder,
Perry, a self-disciplined philosopher of rock who limits binging on
his home-farmed dope to off-road breaks.</TE>
<TE>   Another classic element is the hero's struggle and
self-extrication from Oedipal flypaper. For Jesse, already no
stranger to the urge to patricide, a tempting Older Woman turns up in
the form of a honey-voiced new singer. There's something about
enigmatic Estelle, gap-toothed, swaying hips, baby and all, who turns
out to be the band's salvation and his ne'er-do-well father's main
squeeze. After further setbacks and tests comes the hero's epiphany
of self-worth, and ultimately the heady experience of a guy standing
tall on his own two feet.</TE>
<TE>   There are vivid delights along the road. What could have been
curdled to high melodrama is wryly underplayed. Keeping things
simple, the band calls all the roadhouses they play "the Black Cat."
In Myrtle Beach, "The Black Cat closed for Thanksgiving Day....
Friday night we were back in action but it was slow ... less people
and the ones that were there all kind of groggy, like overfed
snakes." Later a girl turned up, "executing a sort of a white-chick
belly dance.... She had on a white dress shirt with the tails lashed
tight and high over a belly that pretty well cried out personal
trainer." In the end, however, it's all about the music. What Jesse,
Perry, Estelle and the boys love, or don't, and why; and how the
music is made, chord by chord, bridge to riff to mood.</TE>
<TE>   "Lonely Avenue." "Blue." "Roomful of Tears." Each of the chapter
titles turns out to be also the title of a song, either a tune
covered by the band, or an original composition. And not a fictional
original, though introduced through and embedded in a novel, but a
real tune off a downloadable set of tracks. Directions for getting to
the "Anything Goes" album (music by Bell, lyrics by Wyn Cooper) are
right up front in the acknowledgments. Or, as Cole Porter rhymed it:
" ... writing prose ... Anything goes!"</TE>

<LD>Sounds in the Garden</LD>
<LD>   People go to gardens and other quiet places to escape the noise of
everyday life and enjoy the silence. But even within the "silence" of
a garden, many sounds can be heard.</LD>
<LD>   If you listen carefully, you might hear the sounds of rustling
leaves, the chirping of birds and buzzing of bees.</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps you'll catch the chattering of squirrels as they scurry
along down paths. You might hear the cracklings of small creatures as
they hop on the dry leaves beneath bushes and trees.</TE>
<TE>   If the garden has a pond, you might hear the rushing of water as
it flows over rocks or falls into a stream. There may be the sounds
of fish as they break the water's surface with a light splash. People
may be talking and humming as they walk, or tapping their feet on a
wooden bridge or scuffling along on hardened paths.</TE>
<TE>   The garden's staff and volunteers might be busy at work, talking
to each other, scraping their hoes in the ground and clipping their
clippers as they prune trees and plants. You might hear their rakes
scratching and poking through the gravel, and their saws whining
through trunks and branches.</TE>
<TE>   This mixture of sounds can be described as a symphony. The rhythm
of the sounds may change from loud to soft and from fast to slow.
They can make you happy and glad to be alive. Sometimes, depending on
the kinds of sounds and your mood, they can be irritating.</TE>
<TE>   The next time you are in a garden, pay attention to the sounds.
Take a pencil and some paper with you and write down your thoughts.
How would you describe what you hear? Draw a picture. Give your
garden "symphony" a name. Share your experience with a friend or a
family.</TE>
<TE>   A good place to experience the sounds of a garden and see
approximately 5,000 species of plants is at the Mildred E. Mathias
Botanical Garden at UCLA. Visit www.botgard.ucla.edu or call (310)
825-1260.</TE>

<LD>Until early next month when the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels
opens, the best view available to the public is afforded to westbound
traffic passing through downtown on the 101 Freeway. For actual
inhabitants of downtown, the view of the cathedral from its location
at Grand Avenue and Temple Street is limited to its concrete back and
sides, and cut off completely at street level by a network of high
and higher walls.</LD>
<LD>   One might well wonder: Is it a cathedral, or is it a correctional
facility?</LD>
<LD>   In early September, it will be consecrated, and the gates to those
walls will open. The public can come, worship, or just snoop, and
decide for itself what it thinks. Hate the outside, love the inside,
hate the light fixtures, love the pews, love love love the cool
stillness that so many tons of stone and marble can buy. For better
or worse, slowly people will begin to break it in.</LD>
<TE>   Getting the measure of the grounds will take longer. Much longer.
It will never be part of the green space walking corridor beginning
with the Mark Taper Forum and Dorothy Chandler Pavilion along Grand,
and continuing past the new Walt Disney Concert Hall and the Museum
of Contemporary Art. The citadel-style walls reject the formula of
interconnecting gardens of virtually all of the buildings on Bunker
Hill.</TE>
<TE>   It won't even have the whispering shade trees of most of downtown,
at least for some time. The planting around the Our Lady of the
Angels is so young, it will take years to attain the kind of scale
that will cast a cooling shade.</TE>
<TE>   In many instances, the planting has been left
undone--deliberately, according to husband-and-wife landscape
architects Douglas and Regula Campbell. The request not to finish the
job came from the chief proponent of the project, Cardinal Roger
Mahony. "The Cardinal gave us a timeline to project over 200 years,"
Douglas says. There is no rush to finish a timeless job. "The
Cardinal likes to joke that the job has been in the works for 2,000
years."</TE>
<TE>   The Campbells have been on it for seven of them, inventing a new
SoCal cathedral garden style, borrowing motifs as they went along.
Angelenos who have not heard of the designers have probably seen the
work of their 21-year-old Santa Monica firm, Campbell &amp; Campbell,
elsewhere around town. It includes the landscaping in front of the
Los Angeles Central Library and the linked courtyards of the Beverly
Hills Civic Center. They did the Carousel Park at the Santa Monica
Pier. In Pasadena, the deliciously witty stone garden with the two
sycamores set opposite a water feature and plinth topped by a cop
badge motif at the police station is theirs. The lush, almost comic
jumble of jacarandas, azaleas and lilies now lining Washington
Boulevard in Culver City clear from Fairfax to the Sony complex is
theirs, too.</TE>
<TE>   "They're a very smart architecture firm," says Bruce Coats, an art
historian and authority on church architecture at Scripps College in
Claremont. "They often take on very difficult sites and come up with
thoughtful and convincing solutions."</TE>
<TE>   The challenges posed by the cathedral site include the diverse
audience to be served by it: Southern California's 5 million
Catholics, who celebrate Mass in no fewer than 38 languages. The
Campbells' assignment was to invent a style to suit all of them. That
is no small order when there are no hard and fast rules for what
constitutes a cathedral garden in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   Monasteries, yes. Churches, yes. But cathedrals, no. Landscaping
around monasteries has a long tradition dating back to the Middle
Ages and involves vegetable gardens, graveyards, a medicinal herb
garden, orchards and stables. The orchards might double as
cemeteries, the idea being that a grove of fruit was paradise.
Christian cloister gardens, thought to hark from ancient Paradise
gardens, were typically crisscrossed into quarters, and might have a
fountain at the center flowing in four directions, said to represent
the four rivers of Eden.</TE>
<TE>   European church gardens also had their formulas, with cemeteries
for parishioners and often "Mary Gardens" with roses and lilies
associated with the Virgin. Here in California, European and Mexican
missionaries brought a mixture of Moorish, Spanish and Italian
traditions to the American West, along with their classic repertoire
of plants: citrus, olives, grapes, rosemary and sage.</TE>
<TE>   So there were associated themes but precious little precedent for
cathedrals. In Europe, cathedrals are often set in dense urban
environments without any garden, Coats says. In England,
beautification societies might or might not have added trees in the
19th century. The arching shade trees down at the L.A. archdiocese's
former home, St. Vibiana's, the fomer cathedral, sheltered a small,
church-scale garden. This could never accommodate a vast festival
audience. The new cathedral begged for a sweeping plaza for
gatherings, such as the blessing of the animals, but our heat and
landscaping styles demanded greenery.</TE>
<TE>   The Campbells describe the process of begging and borrowing
different styles as "revisioning." Douglas thinks they made up the
word. "It just seemed the right way for us to imagine our work," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   This "revisioning" begins around the perimeter on the street
level, where the Campbells placed two coast redwoods, which will grow
to more than 100 feet tall, next to the bell tower on Grand. The idea
was to answer the architect's symbol of grandeur with nature's
home-grown retort. They couldn't use giant redwoods, Regula says.
"Obviously, because of smog, we had to be realistic."</TE>
<TE>   Down Grand, and around the corner down Temple, liquidambars have
been used as street trees, because, Douglas says, their blush of
color from green to purple echoes the liturgical calendar. "They are
also American cousins of the storax tree, which is used in anointing
oil," Douglas says.</TE>
<TE>   (Liquidambars are controversial as street trees because of their
limited benefits giving shade and producing oxygen and a suspected
synergy with car exhaust. The Campbells see this cathedral context as
special. "I would probably suggest that the tree used in excess is
probably an issue. On balance here for the size and scale, we made
that call," Douglas says.)</TE>
<TE>   Halfway down Temple, in another unusual touch, California live
oaks are pressed against the cathedral's garage wall, and the
cardinal-red theme is carried on by trumpet and flame vines. Around
on Hill Street, planting switches to a mixture of Italian stone pines
and ginkgos. The ginkgos are customarily grown next to temples in
China and Korea, Douglas says. The stone pines connote Rome. To the
Campbells, the mix of plants symbolizes the meeting of East and West.
"It's symbolic of the whole world being part of the sacred
landscape," Regula says.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the cathedral's walls, through the temple entrance, the
sacred landscape is largely paved. Past a fountain designed by Lita
Albuquerque and inscribed with "I am the living water" in 38
languages, visitors ascend onto a plaza that on sunny days is as hot
as a bake stone from midmorning to midafternoon.</TE>
<TE>   At the western end of this plaza looms the new cathedral, at the
eastern one stand cathedral offices, space for a gift shop and the
residences for the cardinal and parish priests. A window box of
impatiens already hangs from the cardinal's balcony.</TE>
<TE>   By 5 p.m., the light is angled, the glare is dimmed and heat
tolerable. The scope of the plaza transforms from threatening to
thrilling. A path across it leads to a shrine to Our Lady of
Guadalupe. Out on the plaza, the Campbells point to clusters of young
pepper trees and oak saplings that will one day climb into the sort
of shade trees left behind to drought and drunks at the now derelict
grounds of St. Vibiana's.</TE>
<TE>   There is more space near the saplings, for planting by future
generations, Regula says. This western half of the plaza is on solid
ground. Trees planted here could reach 100 feet high in a century.</TE>
<TE>   The eastern end of the plaza is roof space over a multistoried
parking lot. Planting here is concentrated in raised beds. There is a
small orchard of olive trees set in lawn. Grass is too wet for most
olives, but this is envisioned as a children's garden one day, though
the low branching habit of the trees would make playing among them
difficult.</TE>
<TE>   The choice of olive trees alludes to the fruit whose oil fueled
lamps of California's missions. Except these trees are sterile
hybrids, without pollen or olives. Birth control for trees is
acceptable if it prevents fruit staining the plaza.</TE>
<TE>   Along the southern wall, a vine-lined pergola will shade
congregants as they proceed to the cathedral door. Here, touchingly,
one finds the rosemary and roses of the Mary Garden and even
Madagascar jasmine, a traditional flower of wedding bouquets.</TE>
<TE>   At the northern wall, a fountain made from Jerusalem stone and
donated by the Jewish community is being installed. Regula holds tile
samples for the base. She wants gold, she says. The fountain is meant
to evoke the old washing wells, public meeting spaces, of biblical
times.</TE>
<TE>   Behind it is the site's quirkiest touch. An observation window has
been cut into the wall overlooking the 101 Freeway and filled with
etched glass depicting trumpeting angels. Another architect might
have left the wall whole and asked landscapers to put in rows of
tall, tall trees, say a posse of those 100-foot redwoods, on the
freeway verge to buffer the traffic noise and filter the pollution.</TE>
<TE>   But the cathedral's architect Jose Rafael Moneo believes the 101
to be the city's Seine to its new Notre Dame. Thus, he opened the
vista to the freeway and walled out city residents on the street.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Campbell sees another significance. The freeway follows
the route of the old El Camino Real, he says, the path the
missionaries took.</TE>
<TE>   Pity it was "revisioned" as the 101. At 5 p.m. on a Thursday, the
air is bitter with the tang of exhaust. The roar of traffic is
constant. But the Campbells are so enchanted by the site, they
genuinely seem immune to it. Standing near a line of stately palms,
Regula whispers, "Listen to the fronds rustle," just as a truck
thunders by.</TE>
<TE>   These rustling palms mark the entrance to a pocket at the
northwestern corner of the site, which the Campbells call the
"cloister garden." This is a lovely space. Its collection of native
oaks, Western Red buds, Japanese maples and sycamores have been set
around a koi pond in a stylish play on the earliest church garden
themes. Against the northern wall, in a delightful wink to the Eden
theme, a fig tree has been slipped in. Under-planting of clivia is
burning now. This will lessen as trees grow and cast some meaningful
shade. It's not perfect, but it's a kind of paradise, right for the
climate, right for the place.</TE>
<TE>   A long window has been cut in the wall of the cathedral, so
parishioners leaving confessionals will emerge to a view of Eden
updated.</TE>
<TE>   Back on the main piazza, empty concrete sacks tumble in the wind
as construction teams race to meet the Sept. 3 deadline. But for the
Campbells, it's not a matter of getting it finished on time, but
started. As the construction winds up, the gardening has only just
begun.</TE>

<DH>A new approach to products helps students make the most of
their tight on-campus space.</DH>

<LD>There's not much room for error in furnishing a dorm room. Furniture
has to be space- and cost-effective. Twin sheets have to be big
enough to fit extra long mattresses. And bulky nonessentials are
usually booted out before Thanksgiving.</LD>
<LD>   Kevon Saber knows all of this ... now. He didn't in 1998 when he
was a freshman finance and economics major at Santa Clara University.
Instead of shopping smart, he ran around to a dozen stores, grabbing
too much of the wrong stuff. He hauled in furniture that was too big
for the cramped 15-by-12-foot room he shared with another student.
And he bought hot-burning halogen lamps and candles, then found the
potential fire-starters are banned from on-campus housing.</LD>
<LD>   Seeing others struggled as he had taught Saber, 22, that there had
to be a better way, so he and three other dorm-dwellers who graduated
in May, launched AllDorm Inc., a mail-order company based near their
alma mater that caterers to students living on 3,500 campuses across
the country.</LD>
<TE>   Lots of stores sell dorm accessories, from sheets that fit
36-by-80-inch-long mattresses to designer trash cans, but AllDorm Web
site visitors find such student-tested products as the Crouton and
the Scrawlwall. The Crouton is a hybrid of a couch and a futon that
can fit under a loft bed. At 5-feet long, three people can cozy up on
top of it and underneath the cushions is enough storage space to hold
about 110-pounds of dirty laundry or 200 VHS tapes. The frame is made
of rigid polypropylene ("because we know students will kick it," says
Saber) and upholstered in a washable ("because students will spill
drinks on them") velour-like fabric known as velboa that comes in
blue, black and black-and-white zebra print ("just because"). It
sells for $99 plus $20 shipping.</TE>
<TE>   The Scrawlwall is a dry-erase message board that clings to a
surface without damaging paint--a dorm room no-no that results in a
fine at the end of the school year. It's a paper-thin sheet of
plastic that, when unrolled, is crackling with static electricity,
which allows it to stick to walls or doors, and peel off without a
trace. The board ($15) is 40 inches by 26 inches, leaving plenty of
room for visitors to leave their mark. The Scrawlwall, like other
AllDorm products, has changed over time. "We used to make it longer
but we found in talking to students that they don't write below their
waistline so we made it shorter," says Saber.</TE>
<TE>   Because lugging possessions to the dorm can be the worst part of
the adventure, the company ships directly to dorm rooms and adheres
to each campus' label guidelines (some want the packages' contents
listed on the outside, among other requirements). This prevents the
boxes from being rejected and returned before the student receives
them.</TE>
<TE>   For more information, call (866) 255-3676; www.alldorm.com.</TE>
<TE>   Here's an idea for a dormmate who foolishly enrolled in an 8 a.m.
class on Mondays: Instead of the typical alarm clock that rattles
everyone in the room, the ShakeAwake can be placed in a pillowcase
and intense pulsating vibrations, not sound, roust the sleeper. The
plastic device was originally designed for those who are hearing
impaired but it has been embraced by others who share space but not
the same schedules. About the size of a deck of playing cards, it's
powered by two AA batteries. A 1-inch LCD display gives the time and
a backlight allows for nighttime viewing. A snooze button grants a
few extra minutes of dream time and a switch can convert the clock to
an audible alarm. AllDorm and other companies sell it for $25. For
more information, www.shakeawake.com.</TE>
<TE>   You can't avoid back-to-school displays in department,
bed-and-bath and discount stores through mid-September, but you can
escape bland hues. Target hired Todd Oldham this season to dress up
mundane staples with a color palette the fashion designer named "Geek
Blue," "Go Away Green" and "Cheerleader Red." One item, a 21
1/2-inch-high metal wire laundry basket that rolls on coasters ($17),
has a removable cotton canvas liner with a multicolored star-pattern.
For more information, www.target.com.</TE>
<TE>   Not that it's on students' shopping lists, but it's tough making
furniture for dorm rooms. Housing officials expect beds and desks to
last for 20 years, parents want to be impressed by their look when
they first inspect the rooms and students don't want to get into
trouble for damaging them. Enter Ecologic Inc., one of a dozen
companies that specializes in providing for the $125-million
on-campus housing market.</TE>
<TE>   The Waukegan, Ill.-based company makes furniture from recycled
milk jugs and other plastics, and desktops of pressurized newspaper
and soy that look like granite. "You can take a sledgehammer or a
switchblade to it, and use acetone to remove pen marks and it will
still look good," says Ecologic President Stephen Lee, whose products
were recently installed in San Jose State's 12-story dorm. The part
that students care about: Beds can be raised up to 6-feet high to
create a loft-like sleeping area with floor space underneath for a
desk or storage. For more information, (800) 899-8004; www.
ecoinc.com.</TE>

<HD>Unexpected Return of a Big Stinker</HD>
<DH>So much for once in a lifetime. Corpse flower blooms again
at the Huntington.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SMAUS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What, they're lining up again to see the huge, stinky blooms of
Amorphophallus titanum, "the world's largest flower"? I thought this
rare plant seldom bloomed, that the last time it flowered, in August
1999 at the Huntington Botanical Gardens in San Marino, was only the
11th time in the U.S. since its discovery in Sumatra in 1878--a
once-in-a-lifetime event.</LD>
<LD>   It's the same plant that's blooming this time around, and it
appears that it may flower every three to seven years, though
flowering has been such a rare enough occurrence that no one is sure.
"It's becoming more frequent, but it's still rare," said Huntington
curator John Trager. Last year the plant, also known as titan arum,
bunga bangkai or corpse flower, bloomed at Fullerton Arboretum, and a
few weeks ago one flowered at the University of Wisconsin. This has
Trager hopeful that the Huntington can pollinate its plant this time
around and get lots of little stinkers.</LD>
<TE>   It is not easy to pollinate. Technically it does not have the
"largest flower" because that huge, 6-foot-tall "flower" is actually
an inflorescence, or composite flower, not a single blossom. There
are in fact thousands of flowers, male and female, arranged spirally
around the spadix, the fleshy central column. Last time the plant
bloomed, the Huntington managed to get only five seedlings because
the female flowers open before the males, so the plant cannot
pollinate itself. While the female flowers were still open, Trager
plucked off a few males and forced them to open early by putting them
in a bag with rotting apples (which release a gas that triggers
flowering).</TE>
<TE>   But this time Trager has pollen from the Fullerton and Wisconsin
plants, so he is hoping for lots of offspring. The Huntington would
love to have loads of stinky plants in its new conservatory, set to
open in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   One of the seedlings from the last flowering is on display next to
its parent, though mom is only 10 years old and "still a baby,"
according to Trager. The bulb-like tuber it grows from weighs 36
pounds; mature plants have tubers that can weigh 160 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Everything about this plant is huge, hence the name. After it
bloomed last time, it made one single leaf, but what a leaf it was.
It lasted for three years and was 10 feet tall, with a stem 8 inches
in diameter. After it fell off, the Huntington repotted the big
tuber, but curators noticed a little rot near the base, so they
briefly dried it out. Trager is not sure if this drying out or the
starch built up by the humongous leaf is responsible for the quick
reblooming.</TE>
<TE>   The inflorescence came into full bloom Wednesday. It is expected
to stay that way through today and will be on display through the
weekend. You can be sure it will again raise a stink. That smell of
rotting flesh is designed to attract the carrion beetles and dung
beetles that pollinate the plant in the rain forests of Indonesia.
Last time around, it was said you could smell it from half a mile
away, but wouldn't you rather stop and smell the roses that grow
nearby?</TE>

<LD>"Bartholomew is a rattlesnake that lived here over 50 years ago,"
said Wolfman. "The legend is that he used to slither into camp and
sun himself near the cabins. No one ever saw him, but the campers
knew he was here because once in a while he shed his skin."</LD>
<LD>   The campers looked stunned.</LD>
<LD>   "If he lived a long time ago, then how did this get here?" asked
Jack, holding up the rattlesnake skin.</LD>
<TE>   "It must be the ghost of Bartholomew," Wolfman said with a twinkle
in his eye.</TE>
<TE>   Devin felt the hairs on her arms stand on end. She didn't want to
even think about snakes.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's gather sticks and roast some hot dogs," said Wolfman.</TE>
<TE>   The kids slowly started gathering sticks.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you think about that story?" Jack asked Devin.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe it," she replied. "I think Wolfman put that
rattlesnake skin there just to teach us something. I heard that every
time a baby rattlesnake sheds its skin, it grows a new rattle. Maybe
that's what he wanted to teach us."</TE>
<TE>   The sun was beginning to set over the lake, turning the sky
different shades of pink. Soon it would be dark.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfman started a campfire. The kids roasted their own hot dogs on
the ends of their sticks. Devin never tasted a hot dog that was so
good. Next came the marshmallows, which melted in her mouth after
they were warmed over the fire.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's play a game," said Wolfman. "It's called 'No Laughing.' "
Wolfman made the craziest face: scrunching his nose up, sticking his
lips out and walking like a duck. All of the kids burst out
laughing--except Jack. Wolfman relaxed and gave Jack a pat on the
head.</TE>
<TE>   "Your turn," said Wolfman. "I bet you can't make us laugh."</TE>
<TE>   Jack couldn't speak. He was pointing toward the boulders behind
the cabins. The kids turned to look. Staring back at them, low to the
ground, were a pair of yellow eyes.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>At the University of St. Andrews, royal hottie Prince William can't
even go out for drinks with friends without being tracked
electronically by a pack of networked women.</LD>
<LD>   "A quite sophisticated text messaging network has sprung up," an
"insider" told the Scottish Daily Record. "If William is spotted
anywhere in the town then messages are sent out" on his admirers'
cell phones. "It starts off quite small. The first messages are then
forwarded to more girls and so on. It just has a snowball effect.
Informing 100 girls of his movements takes just seconds." At one bar,
the prince had to be moved to a safe location when more than 100
"lusty ladies," so alerted, suddenly mobbed the place.</LD>
<LD>   Chalk up another life changed by "swarming," which is transforming
social, work, military and even political lives worldwide. It is the
unintended consequence of people, cell phones in hand, learning they
can coordinate instantly and leaderlessly.</LD>
<TE>   "It's the search for peak experience, something that's really
going to be special," says Adam Eidinger, a Washington political
organizer. It's the precise opposite of a 1962-style "American
Graffiti" world. Then you had to go to a place--the strip, the
drive-in--to find out what was going on. Now you find out what's
going on by cell phone, and go to the place where it's happening.</TE>
<TE>   Once-isolated individuals are discovering a new way to organize
order out of chaos, without guidance. Swarming reverses the idea that
geography, in an Internet age, has become irrelevant. The whole point
is to bring people together in one location for face-to-face contact.
Swarming is also leading to such wondrous social developments as
"time-softening," "cell dancing," and "smart mobs."</TE>
<TE>   Howard Rheingold is an apostle of swarming.</TE>
<TE>   Rheingold has for a generation examined society's unintended and
imaginative uses of new technology. He helped pioneer virtual
communities--a phrase he invented--before most people had even heard
of e-mail or seen a cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   As the Internet and mobile communications merge, Rheingold sees a
profound societal shift. "They amplify human talents for
cooperation," he says.</TE>
<TE>   This is by no means all fun and games. The gear was used by "some
of its earliest adopters to support democracy and by others to
coordinate terrorist attacks," says Rheingold, whose forthcoming book
is called "Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution."</TE>
<TE>   Smart mobs are a serious realignment in which leaders may
determine an overall goal, but the actual execution is created on the
fly by participants at the lowest possible level, Rheingold notes.
They respond to changing situations without requesting or needing
permission. The key to the power of mobiles--including such hybrids
as two-way pagers, Blackberry e-mailers, personal digital assistants
merged with phones, wireless laptops, and phones merged with two-way
radios--is that they liberate people from their desktop phones and
computers.</TE>
<TE>   Former Philippine President Joseph Estrada, accused of massive
corruption, was driven out of power two years ago by smart mobs who
swarmed to demonstrations, alerted by their cell phones. "It's like
pizza delivery," Alex Magno, a political science professor at the
University of the Philippines, told the Washington Post then. "You
can get a rally in 30 minutes--delivered to you."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. military has been one of the earliest institutions to
both fear and see the possibilities in swarming. John Arquilla
co-authored "Swarming and the Future of Conflict" two years ago for
the think tank Rand Corp. and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.
He sees swarming--"a deliberately structured, coordinated, strategic
way to strike from all directions"--as spearheading a revolution in
military affairs.</TE>
<TE>   But social swarms are easily the most common and intriguing for
most people. On a Saturday night in Washington, the members of one
swarm--single, in their 20s and 30s--are briefly landing at Gazuza, a
club where, at this instant, the action is.</TE>
<TE>   Anna Boyarsky and Corinne Fralick, both 21, both interns, casually
mention that their group house has no land lines anymore. Why bother?
To be young is to be cognitively welded to a mobile.</TE>
<TE>   The swarmers laugh at themselves and the role swarming plays in
their lives. "Cell dancing" comes up, the choreographed behavior in
which two people who are vaguely in the same area but can't find each
other get on the phone.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a locator service," says Boyarsky. "My younger brother was
in town. We were going to meet up for lunch. 'I'm at M and
something,' he said." She had him walk down the street, calling out
landmarks until they spotted each other. More seriously, everyone
acknowledges that being constantly in touch with the swarm is
changing their sense of time, place, obligations and presence.</TE>
<TE>   Remember arranging to meet at a specific time at a specific
location? Forget it. People now vaguely agree to meet after work,
then work out the details on the fly. A time-softened meeting starts
with a call that says, "I'm 15 minutes away."</TE>
<TE>   "If you didn't have the cell phone, you'd make more of an effort
to be on time," says Kaine Kornegay, 21, an intern in the Senate.
"It's more socially acceptable to be late," he says, "because you've
given notice that you would be."</TE>
<TE>   There can be a dark side. Swarmers run the risk of never really
connecting with the person physically in front of them. They're
always wondering if there isn't somebody better to talk to at the
next place. How's the party? Should we move on? Is there any food?
Are the girls prettier where you are?</TE>
<TE>   Swarmers do indeed end up with "a more abrupt attention span,"
says Boyarsky. "But you have to have a grip on reality to feel it.
Unless you know what is real--what is a real friendship and
relationship--neither can have an effect on you. If you know what is
real, then you know that the cell phone is not a real relationship.
It's a connection, but not a person. It allows you to connect to
other people, but it's not them, and not you.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sign of commitment, when you turn off the phone," Boyarsky
says. "When somebody turns off their cell phone for you, it's true
love."</TE>

<HD>Via Warhol, Lingering Fame--but No Lasting Fortune</HD>
<DH>The MOCA retrospective has brought the toilers in the
Factory an extra 15 minutes of fame. But it's no Andy love fest.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Viva is busy rearranging her seascape paintings in the cluttered
front room of her Santa Monica apartment. That's Viva Superstar
(a.k.a. Susan Hoffman), Andy Warhol's queen of Pop. Louie is supposed
to show up. Yes, Louis Waldon, as in original member of the Factory
during the late '60s, at the height of Warhol's career.</LD>
<LD>   Viva, who's a painter now, is relentless in her diatribe about how
she only sold three paintings in her last show, how she survives only
on plastic, how they should have a paintbrush-cleaning service like a
diaper service and how she can't take it anymore. It's as if she's
talking to herself or her two fluffy, curious dogs. Waldon shows up
with some Trader Joe's sushi. Viva seems surprised to see him.</LD>
<LD>   There's an eerie feeling that this scenario isn't too far from the
antics of the Factory days, even though that would be more than three
decades ago. Viva, in her late 50s, and Waldon, 67, both key players
from that period, haven't seen each other to speak of in 20 years,
but they seem to pick up where they left off. They bicker like old
lovers (which in fact they were, briefly), arguing about lunch,
money, Andy, the hard times. Waldon takes Viva's complaints in
stride, stoking her discontent. They finally decide to go to lunch at
the 18th Street Coffee House--they say it's owned by Bob Dylan, a
nice fit for the time warp.</LD>
<TE>   Viva drives--and scares the daylights out of everyone. She talks
constantly, throwing in her own spin on the "Andy Warhol
Retrospective" at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art. "Yeah,
really beautiful, gorgeous. I was surprised how good it looked.
Except for those old drawings--they should never show those. The Mao
Tse-tung looked really great." And who better to offer a critique
than an original Factory member, who was there when it was all
happening. The Warhol show, now in its third month, has put the
spotlight back on these Warhol actors.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if they own any Warhols, Waldon says: "No, we wouldn't have
accepted them." But Viva owned some Campbell soup can lithographs and
sold them long ago. Was it worth it? "It doesn't matter," she says.
"Whenever it was and however much it was, it would all be gone now."</TE>
<TE>   All gone but the memories, and the lingering, lately revived fame
that came from their association with the Warhol epoch. To become a
member of Warhol's Factory, which refers to both his studio and
entourage, you had to fit in, have certain qualities. But once you
got in, it's as if you could never turn back.  In Warhol's book,
"Popism" (co-authored with Pat Hackett, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich,
1980), there's a line: "Don't be in an Andy Warhol movie--there'll be
a spell on you all your life."</TE>
<TE>   Spellbound or not, the Warhol retrospective, now in its final
days, brought the Warhol players living in Los Angeles out of the
woodwork for just one more quarter-hour of fame. They've been running
into each other at parties and openings, invited to lecture and
beckoned to appear at the Factory films being shown practically
nonstop around town.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Dallesandro and Paul Morrissey attended Cannes this summer.
Mary Woronov's second novel just got published, and Holly Woodlawn is
making a movie about her/his life. Along with Viva and Waldon, they
were permanent fixtures at the Factory and worked with Warhol during
his most productive and creative period.</TE>
<TE>   Waldon tells the story of how a PR person asked whether he'd like
to speak before or after a film. Viva and Waldon both laugh and joke
that the latter would be a smarter move to ensure there would still
be an audience at the end of the films. They all agree that basically
all Warhol's films were boring.</TE>
<TE>   But Viva Superstar gave her all to Andy and well earned her title.
Warhol knew a good thing when he saw it, and the two were inseparable
from the moment they met in 1967. Viva was known for her star quality
and exquisite beauty, and her eagerness to be part of the picture
landed her major roles in "Blue Movie" (1969), "Lonesome Cowboys"
(1968) and "Nude Restaurant" (1967). She wasn't shy about baring all.
A rape scene in "Lonesome Cowboys" and an explicit lovemaking scene
with Waldon in "Blue Movie" (which was seized by the FBI for
obscenity during the first week of its run) earned her attention
inside and outside Warhol's world. Viva took her role as Superstar
seriously, realizing the impact the Warhol gang was making in the art
world. For his part, Waldon, being a working actor, looked on the
roles as just another gig and kicked back and enjoyed the ride.</TE>
<TE>   Waldon and Viva talk intelligently about underground and foreign
films, and it's clear they were dedicated actors once. But Viva's
celluloid palate has taken a turn. "My favorite movies to watch are
films like 'Terminator II.' And what's those films that Bruce Willis
was in? What are those movies called? Oh yeah, 'Die Hard.' Yeah, I
love 'Die Hard,' 'Terminator.' All that high-tech violence. They're
the only movies I really like."</TE>
<TE>   Waldon pipes up. "I like the sex movies today. Like 'The Piano
Teacher,' " Michael Haneke's psychosexual summer domestic release. He
describes another favorite Korean movie with kinky sex and an S&amp;M
scene. Viva screws up her face. "I can't even stand to see kissing on
the screen. Makes me want to throw up. I can't stand anything to do
with sex on the screen. I'm getting like Paul Morrissey.... I think
once your hormones are basically gone, which mine are at my age, you
can't stand it. The thought of sex is really kind of disgusting,
vomitous, nauseous."</TE>
<TE>   This seems totally out of character coming from Viva, sex goddess
of the Warhol silver screen. She still retains her elegant looks,
with piercing blue eyes, a strong angular nose and delicate fair
skin. Is she joking? "I'm totally serious. I used to say the happiest
day of my life was when I lost interest in sex."</TE>
<TE>   It seems Warhol has left a mark on his actors' souls. There's a
sourness that comes up with each mention of Andy. They feel burned.
Waldon speaks for the both of them: "Andy never paid us, [at least
not] very much money. Not near the money that we should have gotten
paid or should be getting paid still, and that's Viva's big
[complaint]. She felt like she helped create Andy Warhol. Right now,
they're showing the movies, but it's the [Andy Warhol] Foundation.
And they're making lots of money, and the people who work for the
foundation make incredible salaries. They're all college-educated,
but none of them ever had anything to do with Warhol."</TE>
<TE>   Warhol's sun is still golden for the higher echelons of the art
world, but these Warhol players, who were there making it happen,
seem to have gotten sunburned. The peculiar nature of their
predicament is apparent to the people close to them.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Poe, a friend of Waldon's and partner in the Santa Monica art
gallery Blum &amp; Poe, recognizes the enormous role that Warhol's
entourage played in the creation of the Warhol mystique. "Never
forget that Warhol has this incredible archive. Because he collected
everything. Everything in his life. He taped everything. He bought
junk every day; he couldn't stop spending .... But that psychology of
collecting extends even to these people. He collected them, also. Now
the question is what happens when you collect something that is not
an object. Something that has its own powers. It's almost like a Dr.
Frankenstein situation."</TE>
<TE>   For Waldon, it's been a mixed bag. He doesn't seem to feel as
abused and exploited by Warhol as Viva does. He's found a way to make
the most of his Warhol days. He seems settled and content these days,
living in the Marina on a houseboat. Known for his roles in "Blue
Movie," "Lonesome Cowboy" and "Nude Restaurant," Waldon joined the
Factory in the early '60s and really hasn't left. He makes a living
reprising Warhol's most famous and popular images, selling
silk-screen portraits of Marilyn Monroe, Liz, Jackie O., Elvis and
the Electric Chair. And he's been doing it since 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Poe feels somewhat responsible for the first Waldon/Warhol
knockoff. Poe found himself in Waldon's West Hollywood basement
apartment, and "during that night, Louis was talking about Warhol and
pulled out the screens." (These would be the original screens Warhol
inked to produce his silk-screen images.) "It was the Electric Chair
silk screen. I said, 'Louis, what are you doing with this?' He said,
'I dunno, I've carried it around for years, I don't know what to do
with it.' [I said,] Well, I'll pay you right now to make me an
Electric Chair. And he did. And I sold four more for him, and he's
been making them since."</TE>
<TE>   The original Electric Chair screen eventually disintegrated, but
Waldon went through the same process Warhol did, obtaining the press
photos, photographing them and making silk screens out of them. It's
all perfectly legal--he doesn't claim his prints are anything they're
not--and probably the most ironic homage to his mentor. It's hard to
say if Warhol would have been proud, but he was living when Waldon
started, and Waldon says he was aware.</TE>
<TE>   Waldon knows he's cashing in, but he feels it's in the true spirit
of Andy. After all, which Marilyn would you rather have--one with a
"Louie Waldon Factory Superstar" stamp or one with a "Made in Japan"
stamp? Waldon rationalizes his art. "I'll tell you one thing, if you
could make any money on your own with Andy, he never said a word. He
was totally helpful that way. If you wanna do something and you were
going to make some money, he certainly wouldn't stand in your way."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if they felt cheated by Warhol even during the Factory days,
Viva and Waldon replied "yes and no."</TE>
<TE>   "I was always mad," Viva adds enthusiastically, tacking on some
expletives. "I've been angry about one injustice or another, either
perpetrated on myself, the female gender as a whole, or the human
species. I was also on the cover of the Ms. magazine, making me an
early feminist. Therefore, I feel it my duty to continue to be
[enraged] at the state of affairs."</TE>
<TE>   Viva played a bigger role in Warhol's history than Waldon did, and
perhaps that explains her bitterness. She's the No. 2 female in
Warhol's lineup, after Edie Sedgwick. Her outrageous behavior
appealed to Warhol and became a major part of his life,
professionally and personally. In fact, they were having one of their
daily chats when Warhol was shot by Factory interloper Valerie
Solanas. Viva was talking to Warhol on the phone and thought she
heard firecrackers.</TE>
<TE>   The Factory characters living today are talented and productive in
their own right, but their Warhol sensibilities never seem to have
left them. "Everyone who was involved with Andy never left Andy,"
says Poe. "They're all stuck with Warhol. It's like a curse almost."
He pauses and adds: "It was a blessing and a curse." Perhaps like the
Warhol retrospective as it rolls out of L.A. A bittersweet treat,
like an old uncle you forgot you disliked--and then remembered why.</TE>

<LD>Bruce Springsteen's "The Rising," a set of songs mostly reflecting on
the country's mourning and resilience in the weeks after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, entered the album sales chart at No. 1 on
Wednesday after selling 525,000 copies in its first week in the
stores.</LD>
<LD>   The material on the album, which has been greeted with mostly
glowing reviews, is expected to serve as the foundation of
Springsteen's summer tour with the E Street Band. The tour, which was
scheduled to begin Wednesday in East Rutherford, N.J., includes a
stop Aug. 24 at the Forum in Inglewood.</LD>
<LD>   The other new arrivals in the Top 10 on Wednesday were Linkin
Park's "Reanimation," a remix version of the group's hit album
"Hybrid Theory," and Amerie's "All I Have." The albums rank No. 2 and
No. 9, respectively.</LD>
<TE>   The nation's No. 1 single remains Wyclef Jean's "Two Wrongs."</TE>

<LD>8pm Pop Music</LD>
<LD>   The blazing performance by Australia's the Vines that was a
highlight of the recent KROQ Weenie Roast had nothing to do with the
quartet's afternoon performance slot. Singer-guitarist Craig Nicholls
has a reputation for cranking up the heat wherever and whenever the
band gets on stage. The acclaimed rockers return to the Southland for
their first round of shows since their first album, "Highly Evolved,"
made a very respectable debut at No. 11 on the nation's pop album
chart.</LD>
<LD>   The Vines, Roxy, 9009 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood. 8 p.m. $15.50.
Also Saturday. (310) 278-9457.</LD>
<TE>   8pm Dance</TE>
<TE>   A performance by Compania Juana Amaya will launch the second
annual New World Flamenco Festival. A Gypsy born in Moron de la
Frontera, one of the cradles of flamenco, Juana Amaya, 28, was
discovered early and became a lead dancer in flamenco spectaculars
when she was 14. She has toured extensively and has danced the title
role in a 1996 production of "Carmen" and the lead dance role in the
opera "El Cid" with Placido Domingo in 1999, both in Seville, Spain.
She is known for her strength and theatricality, and her commitment
to preserving the heritage of the great dancer, Carmen Amaya, to whom
she is not related, despite the name.</TE>
<TE>   Compania Juana Amaya, Irvine Barclay Theatre, 4242 Campus Drive,
Irvine. Friday, 8 p.m. Also Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 6 p.m.
$28 to $38. New World Flamenco Festival continues through Aug. 18.
(949) 854-4646.</TE>
<TE>   8:30pm Pop Music</TE>
<TE>   With apologies to Fred Flintstone, "ABBA doubles do!" Bjorn Again,
the ABBA tribute band, swings through the Southland resurrecting the
shimmering pop of the '70s Swedish hit machine. This Australian
facsimile has given some 2,500 concerts during its 13-year career.
That's longer than the original group, which disbanded in the early
'80s after both the quartet's husband-wife couples--Bjorn Ulvaeus and
Agnetha Faltskog, as well as Benny Andersson and Anni-Frid "Frida"
Lyngstad--met their marital Waterloos and divorced.</TE>
<TE>   Bjorn Again, the Grove of Anaheim, 2200 E. Katella Ave. 8:30 p.m.
$27.50 to $32.50. (714) 712-2700. Also Saturday at 8 p.m. at Marie
Kerr Park, 39700 30th St., Palmdale. Free. (661) 267-5611.</TE>
<TE>   all day Movies</TE>
<TE>   The newly installed screen at the Nuart comes alive Friday with
"3-D in Your Face," a weeklong festival of 11 campy, cultish
treasures designed to make you duck and cover. Peer through your
cool, 3-D glasses as serial killers ("Friday the 13th Part 3: 3-D"),
great white sharks ("Jaws 3-D"), iconic monsters ("Andy Warhol's
Frankenstein") and sexy airline attendants ("The Stewardesses") greet
you up close and personal. Veteran 3-D consultant Chris Condon will
supervise all screenings to ensure their optimum effect.</TE>
<TE>   "3-D in Your Face," Nuart Theatre, 11272 Santa Monica Blvd., West
L.A. Friday, "Friday the 13th Part 3: 3-D," 5, 7:30 and 10 p.m., plus
12:15 a.m. late show; Saturday, "Jaws 3-D," noon, 2:30, 5, 7:30 and
10 p.m., plus 12:15 a.m. late show; Sunday, double feature: "Andy
Warhol's Frankenstein," 1:45, 5:35 and 9:25 p.m., and "Parasite,"
3:40 and 7:30 p.m. Festival continues through next Thursday. $6 to

<TE>   Born from the ashes of the 1965 riots, the Watts Summer Festival
is the oldest African American cultural festival in the United
States. It was conceived with the intent of developing community
pride, cultural awareness and political consciousness. This year's
festival has something for everyone including carnival rides and
games; a children's village; art exhibits; concerts; a bike, car and
van show; live entertainment; a parade; food; and a film festival.</TE>
<TE>   Watts Summer Festival, 10950 S. Central Ave., Watts, Friday, noon
to 8 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Free. (323)

midsummer night's weekend, which includes a concert on Saturday and a
celebrity basketball game on Sunday. The weekend's proceeds will
benefit the Taylor Michaels Scholarship Program.</TE>
<TE>   Magic's Comedy Slam, Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, 135 N. Grand Ave.,
downtown L.A., 8 p.m. $25 to $125. VIP tickets, $500. (310) 246-4400,

<TE>   8pm Jazz</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, bassist Christian McBride made the fateful decision to
leave Juilliard after only one year of study to tour with trumpeter
Roy Hargrove. Smart move. Gigs with Freddie Hubbard, Benny Green and
others followed, and McBride went on to become one of the most
acclaimed acoustic and electric jazz bassists of the last decade.
Today at 30, McBride has worked with a wide range of artists
including not only Chick Corea, Diana Krall and Quincy Jones, but
also Kathleen Battle, Bruce Hornsby and Sting. This time around,
McBride gives two free performances with the Henry Mancini Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Christian McBride andother guests with the Henry Mancini Institute
Big Band, Friday, 8 p.m. Royce Hall, 405 Hilgard Ave., UCLA. Also

<LD>   Specialists at transforming the mundane into the magical, Regan
Patno and Julia Snyder have also transformed themselves into the
Tweaksters, a quirky performing duo as likely to turn up at Ft. Irwin
Army base in the Mojave Desert as in the Miss India pageant in
Bombay. Cruises, halftime shows, industrials and the Fox "30 Seconds
to Fame" series--they've done it all. Now they're focusing their
talents on a 60-minute family performance that blends dance,
athletics and object manipulation with their unique sense of whimsy.
The objects they manipulate include flower pots, galvanized pipe and
pingpong balls--plus one another, tweaking all the way.</LD>
<LD>   The Tweaksters, Miles Memorial Playhouse, 1130 Lincoln Blvd.,
Santa Monica. 4 p.m. Also Aug. 18 and 25, 4 p.m. $6, $5 for children.
(310) 394-4964.</LD>

<TE>   When Louis Faurer died last year at age 84, noted photographer
Arnold Newman told the New York Times, "He was a terribly underrated
photographer. Somehow, he just wasn't recognized." That could change.
A traveling Faurer retrospective, arriving Sunday at the Museum of
Photographic Arts in San Diego, will feature his better-known gritty
street photographs as well as images taken for fashion magazines.</TE>
<TE>   "Louis Faurer," Museum of Photographic Arts, 1649 El Prado, Balboa
Park, San Diego. Daily, 10 a.m.-5 p.m.; Thursday, 10 a.m.-9 p.m. $6;
students and seniors, $4; 12 and younger, free. Ends Oct. 20. (619)
238-7559.</TE>
<TE>   all day Movies</TE>
<TE>   "The Manchurian Candidate" may be the best film Frank Sinatra ever
appeared in. The taut 1962 political thriller, directed by John
Frankenheimer, stars Sinatra as a Korean War vet who believes his
platoon was brainwashed. Laurence Harvey and Angela Lansbury co-star.
In "From Here to Eternity," the 1953 film that resurrected Sinatra's
career, he earned a best supporting actor Oscar for his portrayal of
a feisty soldier who pushes Ernest Borgnine too far. Fred Zinnemann's
drama, set in Honolulu in the days leading up to WWII, makes last
year's "Pearl Harbor" look like a video game.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Sinatra double feature, New Beverly Cinema, 7165 Beverly
Blvd., L.A. "The Manchurian Candidate," Sunday, 2:50 and 7:30 p.m.;
Monday-Tuesday, 7:30 p.m. "From Here to Eternity," Sunday, 5:15 and

<TE>   The lineup of top-drawer hip-hop and R&amp;B acts couldn't get much
stronger than the one for the Beat Summer Jam 2002 on Sunday in
Irvine. Rappers Snoop Dogg, Nelly, Ja Rule and LL Cool J will be
joined by R&amp;B performers Ashanti, Tweet, Dave Hollister, Truth Hurts
and plenty more for the daylong affair. Station officials have
advised concert-goers to arrive by</TE>

play early, so late arrivals will miss one of the day's biggest

<LD>   Jennifer Aniston strays far from the gang at Central Perk with an
indie-film star turn as a put-upon Texas wife in the dark comedy "The
Good Girl." Bored with her job at the cosmetics counter at the local
Retail Rodeo and fed up with her pothead, house-painter husband,
Justine (Aniston) embarks on an initially giddy, clandestine affair
with a younger, equally unhappy co-worker, that eventually takes a
turn for the obsessive. Jake Gyllenhaal, John C. Reilly and Tim Blake
Nelson co-star as the men who make her crazy. "Chuck &amp; Buck's" writer
and director, Mike White and Miguel Arteta, respectively, re-team for
this wry look at Middle America melancholia.</LD>
<LD>   "The Good Girl," rated R for sexuality, some language and drug
content, opens Friday in selected theaters.</LD>
<TE>   8:30pm Jazz</TE>
<TE>   Two jazz legends arrive in Hollywood this weekend: Jimmy Smith and
the Hammond B-3 organ. Smith got his first organ from a loan shark in
1953 and had it shipped to a warehouse in Norristown, Pa., where he
and his father worked as plasterers. Smith, who already played piano,
claims he stayed in that warehouse six months to a year learning to
play his new "beast." But he emerged with a new sound that would
prove to be the standard for jazz organists for years to come.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Smith Quartet, Catalina Bar &amp; Grill, 1640 N. Cahuenga Blvd.,
Hollywood, today to Saturday, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.; Sunday, 7:30 and
9:30 p.m. $18 to $25. (323) 466-2210.</TE>
<TE>   8pm Pop Music</TE>
<TE>   In the beginning there was a vinyl disc spinning on a turntable.
Then in the 1970s came scratching--DJs moving a record back and forth
on the turntable to create a new sound. This early chapter of
hip-hop's genesis is explored in Doug Pray's documentary "Scratch,"
which screens tonight at Grand Performances' festival of hip-hop. DJs
Haul &amp; Mason, known for their work with the Dakah Hip Hop Orchestra,
will do a set after the film. The full Dakah Hip Hop Orchestra will
perform its organic beats, spoken word and jazz orchestrations in a
live performance Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Scratch" and DJs Haul &amp; Mason, 8 p.m., California Plaza, 350 S.
Grand Ave., downtown L.A. Also, Dakah Hip Hop Orchestra, Friday, 8
p.m. Free. (213) 687-2159 or www.grandperformances.org.</TE>
<TE>   8pm Music</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Philharmonic and music director Esa-Pekka Salonen
revisit two popular classical works at the Hollywood Bowl tonight:
the Second Symphony by Dmitri Shostakovich and Beethoven's Ninth.
Vocal soloists are Jessica Jones, Jill Grove and Nathan Berg in their
Bowl debuts, and tenor Gordon Gietz. The Los Angeles Master Chorale
returns to the Bowl with this concert, as well.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Philharmonic and L.A. Master Chorale, Hollywood Bowl, 2301 N.
Highland Ave., Hollywood, 8 p.m. $1 to $76. (323) 850-2000.</TE>

<HD>The Boob Tube Is a Scenester</HD>
<DH>TV sets, long a centerpiece at sports bars, are moving into
clubs for communal viewing</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLEE KOMAIKO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Television is expanding its sphere of influence out of the living
room and into nightclubs, where that tattered-robe-and-bunny-slipper
ensemble just won't do.</LD>
<LD>   The move is not unprecedented. TV has long had a place in discos
and bars--but as background, a visual diversion, like go-go dancers
or salted nuts. (A notable exception, of course, is its place in
sports bars, where the big game takes center stage.) Now TV is
enjoying a coming-out party of sorts.</LD>
<LD>   About a month ago, the Key Club's Heidi Richman and Stila
cosmetics introduced what was to be an eight-week "Sex and the City"
party on Sundays. It grew out of a weekly soiree her friends threw to
watch the show. "We outgrew everyone's homes, and last year we moved
into hotel suites. It was turning into this really elaborate thing.
So I thought, 'Let's do a whole viewing party.' "</LD>
<TE>   Richman had another motivation as well. "Los Angeles can be a
really lonely place," she says, "especially if you're single. So it's
great to be able to go to a place where you can share what would
usually be an at-home experience with people who are like-minded."</TE>
<TE>   Richman lined up fashion designers, hairstylists and manicurists
to round out the evenings. Buzz was strong. Then an HBO exec got wind
of it and the party was over--at least the TV part. Sunday nights
through Sept. 8 are now dubbed "Heidi's Night of Beauty." But take
heart, rumor has it that the series has migrated to a nearby
venue--sorry, we're sworn to secrecy--making for a fun progressive
evening.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, at West Hollywood's Moomba (still open despite a recent
bankruptcy filing), Greg Miller and Beth Lapides, the duo behind the
long-running Un-Cabaret comedy show (now at the Knitting Factory),
are introducing the Other Network on Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   Over they years, they met a lot of people who produced TV pilots
that never made it on-air, explains Miller. "We were like, there are
all these great shows lying around and we've never seen them, but
we'd like to, and we bet a lot of other people would too."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the shows to be featured during the six-week series were
created by Un-Cabaret alumni, such as Julia Sweeney, Merrill Markoe,
Judy Toll, Dana Gould and Bob Odenkirk, most of whom will introduce
their shows. TV veterans Judd Apatow, Rob Cohen and John Riggi will
also be represented, as will the master of ceremonies herself,
Lapides, whose comedic talk show never made it to a screen near you.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, who has been previewing the shows, calls the material
"deep, interesting, idiosyncratic and funny." But whether club-goers
are going to shell out 10 bucks to watch the tube, albeit on a very
large screen, remains to be seen. Miller and Lapides are confident
there's an ample audience of industry types, comedy fans, TV wonks
and the just plain curious. "You're seeing TV you can't see anywhere
else," says Lapides. "This isn't like you're coming to see 'Frasier'
episodes."</TE>
<TE>   As far as watching television en masse, "people like people,"
cheers Lapides. "I love watching TV alone in the dark in my room. But
I love being able to go out and run into people in Los Angeles,
people who you aren't going to run into in your bedroom--hopefully.
Plus it's Friday in the summer and we've got to have some drinks. And
this year has been particularly difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "This is sort of an attempt to give people a place to commune. I
don't think this is the best year to be alone."</TE>
<TE>   Heidi's Night of Beauty, Sundays at the Key Club, 9039 W. Sunset
Blvd., West Hollywood, (310) 274-5800. The Other Network, Fridays at
Moomba, 665 N. Robertson Blvd., West Hollywood, (310) 652-6364, or

<HD>A Changing Menu, a Festival of Flavors</HD>
<DH>Cenaduria La Casita Mexicana serves a changing menu that
seeks to sustain foods threatened by globalization</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA BURUM</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>My squash blossom soup is afloat with translucent yellow flowers and
Ping-Pong-ball-sized squash, freshly picked from a
community-sponsored garden south of downtown.</LD>
<LD>   The owners of Cenaduria La Casita Mexicana visit that plot at 42nd
and Alameda streets almost daily, picking up a variety of vegetables,
such as huauzontle, a broccoli-like wild vegetable related to quinoa,
and romerito, a stringy, spinach-like green. The unique harvest
allows Jaime Martin Del Campo and Ramiro Arvizu to cook a personal
version of cocina en temporada--the seasonal garden-to-table Mexican
food they grew up eating in Jalisco.</LD>
<LD>   Three years ago, Martin Del Campo and Arvizu quit their jobs in
airline sales and transformed a drab storefront in Bell into a space
of sun-drenched color with fresh flowers on every table. Though they
called it a cenaduria, or dinner house, it actually serves throughout
the day.</LD>
<TE>   It wasn't long before they found themselves "discovered."
Univision and Telemundo asked them to demonstrate recipes on
television magazine shows and eventually to cater company parties.
They now count the Museum of Latin American Art and the Iturralde
Gallery of Latin art as catering customers.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks ago I walked through La Casita's doors into a cheerful
world where customers are treated like invited guests and the dishes,
although nothing more than traditional home-style food, tempt beyond
measure.</TE>
<TE>   Everything about the cooking is disciplined and refined, and every
dish is made from scratch: The hot sauce, simply a thin puree of
fresh chiles, sings of pure fruit flavor with none of the vinegar
taste of a bottled hot sauce. Even the raspadas (snow cones) are
topped with sweetened fruit purees, rather than commercial syrups.
Still, dinners here usually run about $9.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Del Campo and Arvizu patterned La Casita after fondas, the
restaurants run by cooks in private homes. Fondas originated in
smaller towns, and their customers rarely expect to consult a written
menu. Instead, there would be a dialogue on what was best at the
market that day and what the cook has made with it.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, although La Casita does post a permanent menu of
breakfast items and wonderful antojitos (don't miss the quesadillas
with rajas or pumpkin flowers), the surest way to discover the day's
best offerings is a chat with your waiter. You may find an intricate
mole negro or chicken pipian with a rich, mildly hot sauce of ground
peanuts and pumpkin seeds.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesdays are pozole days, and La Casita's three versions of that
robust soup epitomize its well-bred cooking. The red and green pozole
swim with large chunks of lean pork or chicken, and the seafood
version holds clams and baby squid smaller than a thumbnail. The
pozoles are based on dried purple corn kernels, which open like
flowers in cooking and taste like earthy popcorn.</TE>
<TE>   Ask about the icy aguas frescas. With luck you may hit a day when
there's cactus fruit juice or limeade speckled with soft chia seeds,
said to aid digestion.</TE>
<TE>   The concept of cocina en temporada includes festival foods, so
around Christmas, they roast turkeys in the complex, rustic spice
paste adobo. On Independence Eve (Sept. 15), there are mild chiles en
nogada, stuffed with meat and fruit and blanketed in creamy ground
nut sauce. Dishes from la cocina de cuaresma--a repertoire of Mexican
meatless dishes--are served on Fridays throughout the year as well as
during Lent.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the restaurant's "mission" is to keep alive foods that
could easily disappear in the tumult of globalization. Arvizu likes
to describe Cenaduria La Casita Mexicana's menu as "a journey through
a traditional year in Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   Cenaduria La Casita Mexicana, 4030 E. Gage Ave., Bell. (323)
773-1898. Open 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. daily. No alcohol. Street parking;
small lot behind the restaurant. Cash and ATM cards. Dinner for two,
$15 to $25.</TE>
<TE>   What to Get: quesadillas, mole negro, chicken pipian, pozole,
cactus agua fresca.</TE>

<AU>LYNELL GEORGE</AU>
<BD>Lynell George is a Times staff writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a slip of stage, just beyond a shallow reflecting pool at
California Plaza, Issa Bagayogo, the Malian singer, strums and sways.
He serenades in a forlorn near-monotone, accompanied by a pair of
strutting backup singers and a kamele n'goni--a long-necked,
six-stringed instrument--whose plucked notes trickle under his lyrics
like creek water.</LD>
<LD>   But, as evening settles, the Paris-based Cuban crew P18 suddenly
rearranges the mood. It throws out brass notes as bright as
searchlights, steps up the beats to urgent, as if redecorating the
room. It builds an extravagant groove that overlays Cuban son with
funk and rap and then at turns adds shades of reggae--a flashy sonic
structure it calls "electropica." The crowd fills in. Some,
emboldened by the beats, take a turn around in search of a partner.</LD>
<LD>   The rest mark time until the main event, Algerian singer Cheikha
Rimitti, the "Mother of Rai " music, strides out in a dress as white
and elaborate as a wedding cake. A sparkling tiara rests atop her
long blue-black tresses. Her arms akimbo, she stares the audience
down behind her smoked lenses, while chunky rhythms build behind her.
Suddenly turning, arms close to body, gold-slippered feet shuffling
like a moving hieroglyph, she makes two passes across the stage
before a ragged voice curls out from somewhere way, way low--a map, a
road, a history unscrolling.</LD>
<TE>   Nowadays, most nights of the week in L.A., one can book passage to
some exotic elsewhere. Grand Performances is but one of many series
and venues around the city--small to big; open-air to humid
hole-in-the-wall; free to pricey--that have thrown open their doors
and booking calendars to the romance and vagaries of the world's
musics.</TE>
<TE>   What strikes a chord here are the connections: World music's
thicket of unfamiliar rhythms and languages has become our sonic
wallpaper. Over coffee in Silver Lake, you may be romanced by
neo-samba. Trying on your bathing suit in Venice, you might find your
trauma soothed by Balinese gamelan music. Your massage in Pasadena
may sweep you off to Tibet, mixed with some down-tempo electronica.
Between dinner and dessert you may pause to settle the bet of just
who indeed the French chanteuse was--and find she was from Benin.</TE>
<TE>   The city's current embrace of world music comes at a time when the
country has been criticized for being self-involved and dismissive of
international affairs. Whether our particular counterpoint to the
argument is driven by a love for the music or represents a deeper
desire to break down cultural barriers, the simple fact remains:
Crowds at L.A. venues are swelling this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, suggests Sergio Mielniczenko, DJ and director of
electronic media with the Brazilian Consulate in Los Angeles, the
rising interest reflects a search for different ways of reaching out.
"In a time of international conflict, people who are sensitive and
educated start looking for clues," he says. "Especially during a
moment of confusion and doubt, it helps us to remember that people
all over sit around, play music and sing."</TE>
<TE>   At most it takes just a simple incantation: A midsummer night. An
infectious beat. A collision of intentions--and downtown's California
Plaza is suddenly transformed.</TE>
<TE>   Gone are the staid gray and navy suits. The impossibly high heels.
The burden of laptops and bulky briefcases. Rid of their 9-to-5
skins, women wrapped in sarongs from some summer cruise long ago sway
against men in Day-Glo aloha shirts. Many more--couples, families,
singles--arrive in souvenirs out of mothballs ... old saris, peasant
dresses, kente tunics, tie-dye genie pants. All moving to rhythms of
their own design, they too are transformed, transported.</TE>
<TE>   In its 16th year, Grand Performances has been, in a sense, putting
on a moody, bountiful house party for all the grazing neighbors. Just
think "house," "party" and "neighbors" on a much more elaborate
scale. Don't be scared or put off by the patchouli body oils and the
free-form Sufi dancing. At first blush, indeed, the mood might feel
more Berkeley or Boulder "crunchy" by L.A. night life standards. But
it's so much more.</TE>
<TE>   Burrowing deeper, you find these richly curated evenings link
styles, moods, interpretations, diasporas--introducing native
Angelenos to a world that changes around them and reconnecting
transplants to their traditions and customs from home.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it is to quell homesickness or satisfy curiosity about the
jumble of sonic fragments one hears tumbling out of clubs, theaters,
parks or the left margins of the airwaves, more and more Los Angeles,
with the assistance of various producers, agents, programmers and
radio and club DJs, is bit by bit becoming a destination city.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles," says Grand Performances director of programming
Leigh Ann Hahn, "is open to collaborative opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   While the California Plaza and John Anson Ford Amphitheatre shows
have had a long (for L.A.) tradition of offering a Lazy Susan of
tastes, beats, vocal stylings (and a place set aside to dance), the
Hollywood Bowl launched its own World Music Festival series in 1998.
UCLA has beefed up its strong world music component in its Performing
Arts series. And so has the Skirball Cultural Center, which programs
evening as well as afternoon tasting menus of French Gypsy-klezmer
ensembles and Congolese rumba into the fall. And just as the summer
festivals crescendo, the World Festival of Sacred Music gears up for
September. That doesn't even begin to throw into the mix the city's
scatter of underground clubs, rooms and restaurants that transform
after-hours into low-lit boites.</TE>
<TE>   Even the heady salsa craze has given way to the lure of the
"international." "The tropical movement could only support us so
much," says the Conga Room's Brad Gluckstein, who in the fall of 2000
made a big shift to "world music," offering a lineup that can include
anything from Indian tabla to music from Mali.</TE>
<TE>   Angelenos are wrapping themselves up not just in the colorful
party raiments but also in the beats, the culture and the poetry of a
language. People love it, says Mielniczenko, "the language becomes an
instrument. It complements the lines themselves. You know something
important is being said. Doesn't matter that you don't understand.
It's that it is honest."</TE>
<TE>   From our front-row perch we learn the fado of Portugal and the
forro of Brazil from those who brought it with them. For example,
says Patricia Leao, who produces the annual Brazilian Summer Festival
at the Ford and the Brazilian Carnival at the Palladium, "when people
think about Brazilian music, traditionally it's been bossa nova and
samba." But what's blowing up in Rio and Bahia is forro--a
hard-driving music from the country's northeast region, a
hard-driving music with accordion. "Now people here want to know
exactly what forro is.... People--not just the Brazilians--want to
know about the music they are listening to. They want to know what's
happening there."</TE>
<TE>   Just as most of the country's head has been turned by the saunter
of the latest essential "exotic" or "eclectic" trend, why would Los
Angeles be any different? We're often first. We too have been charmed
by the narrative and images of the collection of Cuban heirlooms who
became known as the Buena Vista Social Club--on film and on disc. Or
barefoot, cigarette-smoking Cape Verdean diva Cesaria Evora. At one
point it felt as if all the world had copies of "Cesaria" in their CD
changers or their cars' tape decks.</TE>
<TE>   At various turns, our imaginations have been enticed, spirited off
by the fusions spawned by jazz and Latin music, bossa nova or Dizzy
Gillespie's wanderings into Cuban motifs. Later it was rock-pop Peter
Gabriel's foray--the World of Music, Arts &amp; Dance (W.O.M.A.D)
festival series. Interest in the music comes in waves, says Tom
Schnabel, host of KCRW-FM's "Cafe LA," who has long played a part in
broadening Angelenos' musical palette. "And world music is suddenly
popular again." "Again" is the operative word.</TE>
<TE>   Schnabel's voice guides many through the rough terrain of
multi-syllabic names and obscure musical genres--at UCLA as a
lecturer and on KCRW (89.9), on which he has hosted a range of music
shows for more than 20 years. He, along with Laura
Connelly-Schneider, the Hollywood Bowl's jazz and world music program
manager, now has a hand in introducing its picnicking symphony, jazz
and pop crowd to, say, the bluesy melancholy of fado and Afro pop or
helps connect the dots between Afrobeat and American neo-soul and
funk.</TE>
<TE>   The Bowl's world music series is still very much in a workshop
phase, mixing and matching artists and audiences, fine-tuning its
offerings. "We felt that the concert series should mirror what L.A.
had become," says Schnabel. "And it's always a gamble of taste." In a
city as diverse and full of distractions as this one, "you don't know
what might capture someone's attention." What Schnabel and
Connelly-Schneider don't doubt is the interest; subscription sales
went from 10% the first year to 18% in 2001, with 2002 tracking even
better.</TE>
<TE>   The city's transmogrifying demographic is a gift and a challenge.
Local programmers and producers are in discussion with various club
owners, musicians, producers and record buyers, as well as among
themselves. "It doesn't take a genius" to crack the market, says
Connelly-Schneider, but it takes creativity and patience and a
trained ear to know what's happening in the city's far-flung corners
and then bring in an audience to witness it.</TE>
<TE>   What was once a underground scene, isolated and scattered, is now
a buzzing network. "It blows my mind," says DJ Nnamdi Moweta, host of
"Radio Afrodicia" on KPFK-FM (90.7). Much of it, says Moweta, has
been neatly stitched together by the Internet, which now provides a
one-stop hookup for radio playlists, tour schedules and shopping.
"You can listen on the Internet. Find out where the party is. Buy
out-of-print or import recordings. Local artists can create their own
site. You can find out what's new and coming up. Before that I would
be fighting with my shortwave radio."</TE>
<TE>   Yatrika Shah-Rais, music programmer for the Skirball Cultural
Center and one of the rotating hosts of KPFK's morning music show
"Global Village," travels a city he now finds diverse in sounds. "For
Indian music, I might go to a Sri Aurobindo Center in Culver City.
There are shows curated by ethnomusicologists at various
universities, churches, clubs from Pasadena to the Westside that are
far and varied."</TE>
<TE>   The challenge for producers and programmers is finding a balance
between reflecting the range of ethnic communities and being
competitive. As is the case with Grand Performances, Hahn figures 60%
of the programming is reflective of the local demographic, the
balance composed of touring bands. Building support means passing out
fliers at under-the-radar clubs or learning how to tap into ethnic
networks.</TE>
<TE>   "One of my favorite stories was trying to get the word out about a
dance concert," says Linda Chiavaroli, director of communications for
the Los Angeles County Arts Commission, the aegis under which the
Ford falls. "It was Avaz, a troupe that specializes in Persian
dances, so I was trying to get to the Iranian-Persian community. The
artistic director told me: 'No problem. We'll put it on pirate radio;
there's a certain frequency everyone tunes into.' I've discovered so
much about the city through its music."</TE>
<TE>   All of these new doors opening, this mixing of venues and
specialties, is also creating fusions: "As our metabolism changes, we
push toward more," says Grand Performances' Hahn. "The overall
ecology has changed. We didn't have all those people around and in
place before. Now it's all fallen into place: The labels, the radio
stations and the presence of more international festival stages have
been an important building block."</TE>
<TE>   It's also creating a much more sophisticated audience, says David
Sefton,UCLA's director of performing arts, who adds, "I don't want to
blunder into these worlds. I want to do this in a way that makes
sense." Sefton, like many other programmers, is interested in what is
happening on the ground: how the club scene and the electronic
workshop of DJ culture, garage bands and sampling have merged to
create thickly textured music flaunting its multiple sources. "I'm
interested in the stuff that moves stuff on. I don't just want to be
doing the folkloric stuff. I'm interested in what takes it forward."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, DJ Nnamdi casts an eye over the glittering Grand
Performances stage. He leans in for a photo of Cheikha Rimitti
beaming, arms upraised, the fountains shooting up behind her--for his
growing scrapbook. He's been making the rounds. People up. Dancing.
Gone are the days that he has to fight with his shortwave radio to
beam in concerts and records from home.</TE>

<LD>Back in the day, you may have needed to know someone in the know to
find world music. Someone to shuttle you to that backyard Brazilian
party or the tiny sandwich shop where they spin soca and zouk and
have ginger beer. That you should bring a blanket and warm clothes to
hear ragas on a lawn.</LD>
<LD>   Now, though, the throwaway line--"There's nothing to do in
L.A."--has never been so wrong.</LD>
<LD>   Much of the world music scene had been underground, recalls Nnamdi
Moweta, host of "Radio Afrodicia" on KPFK-FM (90.7), who landed in
Los Angeles from Nigeria via San Francisco in the '80s. He found a
smattering of clubs like the Music Machine; C.C. Smith and Solomon
Egbuho (known on-air as Solomon Solo) had "The African Beat"; and
Mario Casetta, KPFK public radio guru, was winding listeners through
Eastern Europe or Tuva, depending on the day.</LD>
<TE>   "There were [African] juju and hi-life bands playing here. But in
those days, you could barely find Miriam Makeba or Hugh Masekela
records in the store," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Moweta has been tooling around the international music scene since
before it had a name. If you went then to record stores to find it,
you might have found a few dusty odds and ends in the "international"
bins at some of your better (read: idiosyncratic) purveyors.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a product placement thing," Tom Schnabel, host of "Cafe
LA" on KCRW-FM (89.9), says of trying to find the music in record
stores. "If it wasn't a field recording, found sound, source music or
ethnomusicology, people didn't know where to put it. The term 'world
music' emerged as a marketing category. And we've been trying to get
rid of it ever since."</TE>
<TE>   As public and college radio offered more enticements, curiosity
grew. The music--from far locations embroidering the story of a
country's politics or history or its expressions of love--provided a
diversion in the late '70s and the '80s.</TE>
<TE>   "Punk was over. Bob Marley had died," says Schnabel.</TE>
<TE>   The antidote to Yes and Journey? King Sunny Ade at the Palladium.
Five thousand people. "It really kicked in after the '84 Olympic Arts
Festival, where we had groups from all over the world and saw that
there really was audience--that this stuff has grown," Schnabel
recalls.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, people do travel more now, and consequently they've
become exposed to more ... food, coffee, music." And what does that
mean for world music? As Schnabel puts it: "There is an appetite
again."</TE>

<HD>A World Music Top 10 Sampler</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We asked Tom Schnabel, host of "Cafe LA" on KCRW-FM (88.9), to create
a guide for the novice looking to sample and explore the world music
landscape. Here are Schnabel's top 10:</LD>
<LD>   1. Caetano Veloso, "Livro" (Nonesuch)</LD>
<LD>   This is one of the most elegant albums I know of, combining
European chamberistic finesse, a la Ravel and Debussy, with subtle
but insistent African rhythms, all anchored by Brazilian Caetano's
ultra-suave voice.</LD>
<TE>   2. Olatunji, "Drums of Passion" (Columbia Legacy)</TE>
<TE>   A landmark in world music, it is one of the first African CDs to
be studio-recorded (it came out in the mid-'60s). Today this classic
of Nigerian percussion is as fresh and powerful a drum orgy as the
day it was issued, and some may remember it from Carlos Santana's
cover of one of its songs ("Jin-go-lo-ba"). This classic inspired
John Coltrane (who studied with Nigerian percussionist Babatunde
Olatunji and wrote the song "Tunji" in his honor), Dizzy Gillespie,
Mickey Hart and many others.</TE>
<TE>   3. Peter Gabriel, "Passion" (Real World)</TE>
<TE>   This album was the soundtrack to the Martin Scorcese film "The
Last Temptation of Christ." The project was produced by Peter
Gabriel, and the amazing sounds of Armenia's Djivan Gasparyan, Indian
violinist L. Shankar, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and other great musicians
make for an amazing musical tapestry. It remains the best thing about
the controversial movie.</TE>
<TE>   4. Tito Puente, "Dance Mania" (RCA)</TE>
<TE>   The tropical Latin genre isn't really world music, but Puente's
music is so full of life and so well-crafted that I had to include it
here. A 1958 recording that is still a favorite on the dance floors,
it was recorded in an audiophile manner, so it still sounds
fantastic.</TE>
<TE>   5. Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, "Night Song" (Real World)</TE>
<TE>   It's a landmark crossover collaboration between the late Pakistani
Sufi singer and producer Michael Brook. Their second collaboration,
it's one of the most successful crossover efforts to date.</TE>
<TE>   6. King Sunny Ade, "Juju Music" (Mango)</TE>
<TE>   One of the most intriguing, influential and downright amazing
albums from the Nigerian-born Ade, it helped establish the world
music genre in 1982. It amazed people with its combination of talking
drums, country-western slide guitar and elements old and new, and it
presaged the type of fusions world music would later bring us.</TE>
<TE>   7. Ali Akbar Khan, "Indian Architecture" (Water Lily Acoustics)</TE>
<TE>   This is a simply stupendous performance of classical Hindustani
ragas that must be heard, by the great master of the Indian sarod. It
also is a stunningly well-done audiophile recording.</TE>
<TE>   8. Paco de Lucia &amp; Camaron de la Isla, "Potro de Rabia y Miel"
(Philips)</TE>
<TE>   It's the last recording by the greatest flamenco singer of the
last century, paired with the top guitarist, both of Spain. It is one
of the most desperately passionate outpourings in the flamenco genre.
Camaron was taken from the hospital where he lay dying to make this
recording, filled with anguish and passion; Camaron died the next day
and will always be a hero in Spain.</TE>
<TE>   9. Djivan Gasparyan, "I Will Not Be Sad in This World" (Opal)</TE>
<TE>   An anthem and a prayer, it was renamed after the 1988 Armenian
earthquake after an old Armenian folk song. It's deep, soulful and
timeless. Brian Eno</TE>
<TE>   called this music the most soulful he'd ever heard.</TE>
<TE>   10. Milton Nascimento, "Miltons" (Columbia)</TE>
<TE>   This late '80s album featured the Brazilian singer in a spare
musical setting with just pianist Herbie Hancock and percussionist
Nana Vasconcelos. The transparent musical backdrop gives Nascimento
plenty of room to soar and remains an unusual masterpiece in his
recorded repertoire.</TE>

<HD>At the Airstream Diner, Just What Is 'Adam &amp; Eve on a

<AU>S. IRENE VIRBILA</AU>
<BD>TIMES RESTAURANT CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his tailored chefs' whites and skewed 'do, Fred Eric stands in the
middle of his new Beverly Hills diner, ringmaster to the eccentric
circus that has just arrived in this sedate enclave. Beside him, two
squat statuary dwarfs, runaways from Snow White, are doing time as
stools.</LD>
<LD>   The lines of a vintage airstream trailer posed against a Western
sunset are echoed in Airstream Diner's design. The building is
sheathed in gleaming, curvaceous aluminum. Fifties-era print curtains
hang at the aluminum-framed windows. A swatch book of period Formica,
linoleum and trailer-style upholstery completes the theme. Talk about
a blast from the past. "This is the first place I designed by myself,
and I really like it," says Eric, who also owns Vida and the 24-hour
diner Fred 62 in Los Feliz.</LD>
<LD>   The place has only been open two days when I stop in. It's fun to
watch Beverly Hills geezers in navy blazers with handkerchief
artfully tucked into the pocket peer in the doorway, bemused by this
goofy new diner. Most, though, end up taking a photocopied menu from
the pile by the door and pondering the meaning of items like "Adam &amp;
Eve on a Raft," "A Nice Tofu Scramble" or "Hunka Hunka Burnin' Love
Pancake."</LD>
<TE>   "Billion Dollar Babies", tender silver dollar pancakes sprinkled
with powdered sugar, are the best thing we try. And we're grateful
for them. The kitchen is having trouble getting the food out: small
wonder, since they've been open such a short time. The waiters look
shell shocked. One keeps asking us over and over and over again,
"More iced tea?" until we wonder whether short-term memory loss is
the problem. The fresh lemonade, incidentally, is nice and tart.</TE>
<TE>   There's a pretty good "pressed and creased" Cuban sandwich with
crusty onion rings, a Wally burger with melted cheddar or,
alternatively the Wimpy burger "for those who like it medium to well"
and a 3-ounce "Just Kid'n Burger," plus more sandwiches, egg dishes
and salads.</TE>
<TE>   Devo played the opening and have a dish named for them. Devolution
Chinese Chicken salad seems a bit mild-mannered, even bland, though,
for a tribute to Devo and the '80s. Halfway through our dinner, the
sound system comes on blasting Bill Haley and the Comets' "Rock
Around the Clock." Later comes the sound of a radio spluttering
between stations on a long road trip.</TE>
<TE>   For dessert, the berry pop tart has a certain allure. It's
homemade, tasting of cinnamon and butter and covered with a swatch of
red frosting incised with A for Airstream. A work in progress,
Airstream Diner is "always open, never closed," at least in theory.
I, for one, can't wait for the doughnut machine to be installed. Then
you'll be able to sidle up to a take-out window and come away with a
sticky, freshly made example. The shopkeepers on Rodeo Drive should
be ecstatic about that.</TE>
<TE>   Airstream Diner, 9601 S. Santa Monica Blvd., Beverly Hills; (310)
550-8883. Menu items $1.50 to $24. Currently open 9 a.m. to 11 p.m.;
starting Saturday, open 24 hours. Street and lot parking.</TE>

<HD>A Diva's Adieu</HD>
<DH>Cher's on a farewell tour, and it doesn't call for
subtlety. A media montage helps her turn back time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD CROMELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If there's ever an occasion for unbridled self-absorption, it's a
diva's farewell tour, and Cher's three-month adieu to her role as a
concert singer is every bit the over-the-top extravaganza her fans
demand.</LD>
<LD>   "OK, so, well, here I am," Cher said early in the show at Staples
Center on Tuesday, summoning waves of adulation from the crowd. That
existential epigram, with its Valley girl cadence, pretty much summed
it all up.</LD>
<LD>   A diva is a diva for many reasons, but one of the essentials is
that she's survived adversity and keeps bouncing back.</LD>
<TE>   But really, what has Cher survived? At least Liza Minnelli,
today's uber-diva, has endured a dysfunctional family, nonelective
surgery and substance-abuse problems. Cher? Mainly bad press and bad
boyfriends.</TE>
<TE>   It's been good tabloid material, and maybe that's enough for
divadom in these lean times, but it's not the stuff of true triumph
and grand tragedy. As if to compensate, the concert (which was also
scheduled to stop at the Arrowhead Pond on Wednesday) worked hard to
inflate her life into something epic.</TE>
<TE>   Cher (at that moment blond and clad in a sort of harem outfit) was
actually genuine and amusing in her initial spoken comments, when she
playfully shushed the crowd's objection to her retirement plans by
saying, "I've been a frickin' evil diva for 40 frickin' years."</TE>
<TE>   This "real" Cher is the one that makes her the most human and
self-deprecating member of the sisterhood, but she was gone pretty
early, sucked into the machinery of Las Vegas-ized production numbers
packed with dancers and Cirque du Soleil-style acrobatic action.</TE>
<TE>   The show traced the life of Cher from flower child to pop-art
fashion plate and TV star. A long montage of clips from her movies
culminated in her winning an Oscar, and excerpts from TV interviews
depicted her as bright, genuine, misunderstood and unsullied by cheek
implants.</TE>
<TE>   There might be a reason that the emphasis was on media other than
music. Despite a dusky, husky voice that has a natural appeal in its
natural mode, and despite a long list of hit records to her name, her
impact as a pop singer has been negligible.</TE>
<TE>   Her best moments as a singer Tuesday came on '60s-era folk-rock
from the Sonny &amp; Cher days, notably her radiant version of Bob
Dylan's "All I Really Want to Do." But most of the songs were calls
to calisthenics rather than interpretive challenges, dominated by
thumping synthetic rock derived from dance and disco.</TE>
<TE>   On her recent albums, the main function of the dense music is to
corral her wildly erratic singing. On stage it was primarily to push
her voice to full power, keeping it afloat and away from the dangers
of dynamic variation, phrasing and other methods singers use to
create nuance and interpret a lyric.</TE>
<TE>   But the songs weren't really the point. They were just one more
prop in the celebration of all things Cher. The presentation might
not have explained exactly why she enjoys the status she does, but
divadom doesn't necessarily stem from rational sources. It's a
self-perpetuating state, sustained by an unspoken agreement between
audience and icon--you act like a diva and we'll treat you like one.
And Cher is acting like one all the way to the final curtain.</TE>
<TE>   Cyndi Lauper's presence as the opening act was an incongruous
contrast in many ways, like a grainy old "Our Gang" comedy on a
double feature with "Star Wars."</TE>
<TE>   An '80s flash in the pan with nothing much going these days, the
New Yorker simply took over the arena on sheer determination. She
created a genuine feeling of community with the audience and used her
quirky, powerful voice to generate both touching moments and rousing
release. It may have all been aged material, but Lauper delivered it
fresh.</TE>

<DH>Programs like Family Day at the Music Center demonstrate
that dance is among the more kid-friendly performing arts</DH>

<LD>Hundreds of young children, many of whom may only have seen dance in
the form of the animated mouse Angelina Ballerina on TV, gathered at
the Music Center last month for their first taste--live--of the art
form.</LD>
<LD>   The free Family Day program was part of the Music Center's
presentation of American Ballet Theatre's production of "Le Corsaire"
(The Pirate) last month. In addition to the dance demonstrations by
professionals and students, many youngsters also were treated to the
matinee featuring the deft moves of 20 local dancers ages 11 to 17.</LD>
<LD>   Dance, the art of moving in time through space, might seem too
abstract or complicated for children. But choreographers and dancers
say it's one of the most child-friendly of the performing arts. One
need understand only a few basic guidelines before navigating the
dance waters with ease.</LD>
<TE>   Kids at the "Corsaire" program, for instance, were wearing
sneakers, not ballet slippers, as they were led through dance steps
by former Joffrey Ballet dancer Carole Valleskey. The 9- to
11-year-olds took to the moves--truly more freestyle jazz than
classical ballet--regardless. Valleskey, director of the in-school
education program the California Dance Institute, said she started
with simple moves, then put them to meter and asked for energy and
focus.</TE>
<TE>   After watching "Corsaire," the children said their favorite thing
was "watching Angel." Soloist Angel Corella did appear to fly across
the stage, mesmerizing everyone. Valleskey says, such virtuosity
accounts for a large portion of ballet's accessibility.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important thing is to take children to quality stuff,"
she said. "But for me, dance is the art form that's the most
accessible because it's about what children do all day ...</TE>
<TE>   It's bodies moving through space, and they get that pretty
easily."</TE>
<TE>   Still, parents need to prepare their children before going to a
dance concert. She prepared her group for "Corsaire" by explaining a
ballet company--what a corps is and what a soloist is, for
example--and by leading students through simple choreography so they
understood how steps are performed to meter and rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   If ever a show was meant to be understood by children, it's Walt
Disney's theatrical spectacle "The Lion King." It won Tony Awards in
1998 for best musical and choreography and was based on a hugely
popular children's film.</TE>
<TE>   The show's success--it's been running at the Pantages Theatre for
nearly two years--is in part the result of the work of choreographer
Garth Fagan. Speaking by phone from New York, Fagan said that he and
director Julie Taymor conceived their work to be family-driven, and
especially wanted to engage children.</TE>
<TE>   "The movement is very exciting," Fagan says, "and I decided to
include all types of dancing in there--modern, ballet, African,
Caribbean, hip-hop--so any and every child could plug into something
that was their thing and learn something new about other forms of
dance. You see kids in the lobby at intermission doing steps from the
show."</TE>
<TE>   Sitting through a two-hour-plus musical might be difficult for a
young child, but Fagan believes that children should be taken to
dance performances at an early age. "The sooner the better," he says
emphatically. "Outdoor performances, where they can run
around--that's wonderful at any age. For indoor performances, I think
about 4 years old, because their imagination is so fertile at that
time."</TE>
<TE>   "Just be sure," he adds with a laugh, "that they are trained for
bathroom breaks and that they are old enough to be reasoned with."</TE>
<TE>   High-energy shows like "Blast," which comes to UCLA's Royce Hall
this month, "Stomp" and "Riverdance" also have been a big draw for
kids. Offshoots of tap-dancing, these shows get hearts pumping while
putting the audience in a feel-good mood.</TE>
<TE>   Lynn Dally, artistic director of Jazz Tap Ensemble, believes it's
not so much age that dictates when a youngster should be taken to
dance concerts. They should go, she says, as soon as they can enjoy a
performance.</TE>
<TE>   "Really young kids are great to take to a casual format, where
they can stand up and bounce around....They need some preparation for
sit-down concerts. Remember," she adds, "that kids are raised on TV
and have very fast vision, so try to choose dance that's visceral and
visually compelling."</TE>
<TE>   That sounds a lot like tap dance, a form Dally can't help but
advocate. "Tap is so rhythmically engaging," she says. "Kids really
love hearing all the sounds. Tap conveys a feeling of 'You can do
this too.' When kids come out of a tap concert, they usually come out
stomping their feet."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>* The MC for the Long Beach-based hip-hop group Ugly Duckling, whose
record "Journey to Anywhere" was recently re-released by Emperor
Norton Records.</LD>
<LD>   A Mixed-Up Scene: As far as music places in Long Beach, it's kind
of a contradiction in terms. But there's a place here called Live
Bait and it's on PCH and Loynes Avenue, and they do different stuff
every night. Tuesdays they have an event called Cabana, and Fridays
they have an event called Blown Celebs, that my partner Dizzy is
involved in. I don't know what Blown Celebs means, but they've had
some groups like People Under the Stairs, Fathead and L.A. Symphony.
At Cabana, we've played there, and Jurassic 5, Visionaries and
Dilated Peoples have been there. So, that's like the only viable Long
Beach hip-hop thing you can go to.</LD>
<LD>   Faux Mayan Ambience: I'm a big, big fan of Mexican food, and I've
got this spot on Atlantic Avenue called El Patio. You can barely see
your way around because it's so dark inside. I think they keep it
dark because they have all these papier-mache-like Mayan
temple-looking objects and if it was too bright, you would see that
they were very fake. But in the dark they still look sort of
commanding. They make a good carne asada and bean burrito.</LD>
<TE>   Where Our DJ Shops: For indie-rock and hip-hop records and just a
good variety, Fingerprints in Long Beach on 2nd Street is good. Or if
you want vintage stuff, the store where our DJ shops is Bagatelle
Records on Atlantic Avenue in downtown Long Beach. It's a bit pricey,
but that's because it's the best stuff in the world. They don't fool
around with reissues there.</TE>
<TE>   Underground Hip-Hop: We've played almost everywhere in L.A. over
our little span as a group. But one of the clubs that I think is the
coolest is the Root Down. They do that every Thursday night at Gabah
on Melrose. We've played there and Cut Chemist DJs there and guys
from the Breakestra play there, so it's a real underground hip-hop
mix with the funk and soul crowd, people who like to dance and get
down and listen to James Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Free Show: On Friday mornings in Long Beach on the Pine Street
Promenade, there's a farmers market with fresh fruit and people
selling incense and all that kind of junk. They've got free music
every week and usually it's something halfway decent, blues or
zydeco. But if you like watching homeless people dance, then there's
no better entertainment. I'm not just talking about homeless people
who are struggling on the street, I'm talking about crazy people.
There's like some 70-year-old guy down there poplocking.</TE>
<TE>   The Girl From Ipanema: I just had a top-notch experience at this
place in Long Beach called Tony's. It's a French-dip pastrami place,
but the owner is Brazilian. Monday and Wednesday nights, they teach
Brazilian drumming and dancing, Saturday night is samba music, and
Sunday afternoon is bossa nova. So, that's my pick of the week,
Sunday afternoon bossa nova at Tony's.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Radio station KLON-FM (88.1) will change its call letters Friday to
KKJZ to better reflect its format of jazz and blues.</LD>
<LD>   "While our call letters have changed, we are unwavering in our
goal of bringing a wider audience and respect to jazz and blues
through our programming, promotions and events," General Manager Judy
Jankowski said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The station had been known as KLON since it went on the air in
1981 on the campus of California State University Long Beach. The
KKJZ call letters became available after a station in Portland
switched from a jazz format to soft rock.</LD>

<LD>   The Tale of the Allergist's Wife--Valerie Harper's eyes roll. Her
eyebrows rise. She flings her hands toward the ceiling. This is not
the time or place for subtlety. This is the Ahmanson Theatre stage,
and Harper is playing Marjorie in Charles Busch's "The Tale of the
Allergist's Wife." Busch describes Marjorie in his stage directions:
"She's in the throes of an epic depression. It's not quiet depression
but raging frustration. She's a volcano that explodes, simmers down
and then explodes again." Did we mention that this play is primarily
a comedy? Yes, Busch believes that volatile Marjorie, her
more-altruistic-than-thou husband, Ira (Tony Roberts), and her
brutally candid little mother, Frieda (Shirl Bernheim), are
hilarious. For much of the evening, he's right. The play has a
go-for-the-joke ethos that stops short of brilliant revelations.
Obsessive and neurotic New York Jews are not unfamiliar targets of
satire, however, and Busch's subject matter doesn't venture beyond
Woody Allen territory.</LD>

<HD>500-1 Odds? That's Not a Problem</HD>
<DH>Asia Argento is ready for anything after facing a big field
to play Vin's love interest in 'XXX'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN MAYNARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In her surreal, nightmarish directorial debut, "Scarlet Diva" (2000),
Asia Argento played a troubled young actress stalked and seduced by
men and women who stop at nothing. Among them is an American film
producer who claims he wants to cast her in a remake of "Cleopatra"
opposite Robert De Niro as Marc Antony but really just wants to get
her in bed. If "Diva" represented this intense, opinionated
26-year-old's statement on celebrity commodity, what is she doing as
super-spy Vin Diesel's love interest in "XXX," a monster Hollywood
action movie?</LD>
<LD>   "I wasn't seeking anything," says Argento. "I was disenchanted, I
guess. I didn't have an agent out here and I still don't. But this
casting director in London sent me the script, and I had seen 'The
Fast and the Furious,' which I loved. And I think the kid gave me the
inner strength to go out and get it."</LD>
<LD>   "The kid" is Anna Lou, Argento's 13-month-old daughter from a
two-year relationship with Italian musician Marco "Morgan" Castoldi.
(No longer together, they remain friends.)</LD>
<TE>   Argento beat out 500 actresses for the role of Yelena, the
tougher-than-nails Russian girlfriend of a criminal mastermind
(Marton Csokas). Her first line is a biting rejoinder to Diesel's
character, Xander Cage, that makes clear she's more than an ornament.</TE>
<TE>   "In the original script, the woman only had two scenes, and in one
of them she was unconscious because she had been tortured," says
director Rob Cohen, but "I wanted a movie that would appeal to women,
not just a testosterone fest. Asia reminded me of Ingrid Bergman. She
had a vibration that the greatest part of her beauty was her mind.
All of her intrigue wasn't her cleavage but her IQ."</TE>
<TE>   Daughter of horror film director Dario Argento and actress Daria
Nicolodi, Argento grew up in front of the camera, landing her first
role in an Italian miniseries when she was 9. She worked steadily all
over Europe until taking a self-imposed hiatus from ages 14 to 17. "I
was on this inner trip," she says, undergoing therapy, among other
things. "For those years, I didn't act, I was just a teenager."</TE>
<TE>   When Argento returned to making movies, she graduated to more
complex roles, including three films with her father: "Trauma"
(1993), in which she played an anorexic searching for her parents'
killer, "Stendhal Syndrome" (1996) and "The Phantom of the Opera"
(1998).</TE>
<TE>   In her father's films, Argento played women who were stalked,
beaten and raped, but she says she never thought twice about the
roles. "I was attracted to violence," she says. "I've always been
attracted to the dark side. I guess it's inherited from my parents.""</TE>
<TE>   With acknowledged nods to the films of Roman Polanski, Argento's
"Scarlet Diva" is a barely fictionalized road map through her inner
psyche. She and her on-screen doppelganger both had parents who
divorced, bitterly. And it's no coincidence that both her character
and her real-life baby daughter are named Anna; they were named for
her older sister, who died in a scooter accident in Rome. She was 21
and Argento was 19. Argento turned the traumatic incident into the
film's climactic scene.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to let go of the people that you love. If you let them
go, they can protect you. I believe that."</TE>
<TE>   Argento's sister's name is tattooed on her ribs and, in total, she
has four body adornments--the others being an angel on her belly, two
snakes on her lower back, and an eye on her left shoulder. "They
don't mean much," she says. "They're just beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, she's wary about Hollywood making too big a fuss over her
"bad girl" image instead of her work. She expresses sympathy for
Angelina Jolie, another off-screen siren who's received a lot of
press scrutiny. "Even if you don't care about everybody, you care a
little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Argento has played the Hollywood game before. When she was 17,
Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein helped her land a featured role
in the period costume drama "Queen Margot" (1994). Then he gave
Argento her first English-speaking starring part, the title role of
"B. Monkey," a sultry bank robber. The film had an impressive
pedigree, including director Michael Radford, fresh off the worldwide
success of "Il Postino" (1994), and a stellar supporting cast that
included Jared Harris, Rupert Everett and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. But
after a troubled production--the film was finished in 1996 but
unreleased until 1999--"B. Monkey" tanked with critics and audiences.</TE>
<TE>   But Weinstein is still a mentor figure; in fact, the indie movie
mogul sat by her side at a "XXX" junket screening last week.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't blame him. I lost my interest in 'B. Monkey' too," says
Argento. "I wanted him to be there to prove to him that it was
important that he believed in me before I ever did."</TE>
<TE>   "I think Asia has found a new maturity," Weinstein says. "She's
going to be an incredible director, but I'm urging her to act right
now. That's my two cents."</TE>
<TE>   Weinstein says he set up a meeting with her to co-star with
Anthony Hopkins and Javier Bardem, who are expected to appear in the
19th century period drama "Edgardo Mortrara." "She said the role was
too small," says Weinstein.</TE>
<TE>   The question remains: Can an outspoken woman who counts among her
heroes underground guys like street-hustler-turned-novelist J.T.
LeRoy and Abel Ferrara (who directed her in 1998's "New Rose Hotel")
live with herself for going Hollywood?</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, it's bizarre for me," says Argento. " I don't want to end
up with one label. Like in Europe, they label me 'the dark lady' and
I come out here and they label me 'kick-ass chick.' Though I'd rather
be a kick-ass chick than a dark lady at this point. It's like that
[Greek] story, Sisyphus. You feel like you're on the top of the hill,
but then you have to start all over again. But it's great. You
appreciate this job more instead of just sitting on what you already
achieved."</TE>

<HD>Life-Affirming One-Act Plays by Redoubtable Ray Bradbury</HD>
<DH>Three genial works, based on short stories from the '50s,
are grouped in 'Past, Present and Future'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ray Bradbury can spot the sinister impulses lurking in society's
shadows, but he's still more attuned to life's affirming power, its
unexpected humor and simple joys.</LD>
<LD>   These latter qualities suffuse "Bradbury: Past, Present and
Future," a trio of genial, almost poetic one-act plays presented by
Bradbury's Pandemonium Theatre Company at the Court Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   In each story, the premise is easy to guess, and it's a one-joke
payoff. Yet stylish visuals and warm portrayals by the cast of
16--which includes recognizable character actors Len Lesser (Uncle
Leo on "Seinfeld") and Pat Sturges--make the whole seem greater than
the sum of its parts.</LD>
<TE>   The title refers to the plays' settings: "A Medicine for
Melancholy" takes place in London in 1750; "The Day It Rained
Forever" in present-day Arizona; and "Henry the Ninth" on the cliffs
of Dover, England, in 2079. All three are based on short stories from
the 1950s. The first two have been presented before in L.A.; "Henry
the Ninth" is new.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Rome Smith, a longtime theatrical collaborator of
Bradbury's, directed the plays, crafting a different style for each.
"A Medicine for Melancholy" is a sort of fairy tale; "The Day It
Rained Forever" is meditative and gently humorous; and "Henry the
Ninth" whispers with the voices of Shakespeare and Dickens.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Evans' scenic design is a blank slate of skewed walls that
serve as all-purpose, slightly disorienting backdrops, while Peter
Strauss' lights evoke everything from moonlit romance to the baking
desert sun.</TE>
<TE>   Bradbury has always loved the theater, and, at 81, he's been
seeing his work produced all over town lately. His fans will take as
much as they can get.</TE>

<LD>* Tiny blue globes of subtle sweetness--blueberries are here.</LD>

<LD>   Go Dark on Sept. 11? Broadway Is Split</LD>
<LD>   To perform or not to perform? That's the question facing dozens of
Broadway shows as they approach the first anniversary of the World
Trade Center attacks.</LD>
<TE>   The show will go on at "The Producers," "Hairspray" and
"Thoroughly Modern Millie." But Disney musicals ("The Lion King,"
"Beauty and the Beast," "Aida") and more than a dozen other
productions will be dark Sept. 11. Many are scheduling a Sunday
matinee to make up for the cancellation.</TE>
<TE>   "Chicago" producer Barry Weissler said playing that day would be
too "difficult and too emotional." But others believe that business
as usual makes a positive statement.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is a whole group of people that feel, 'I am going
to an event to show that this did not hurt my enthusiasm to be a
participant in the world,' " said "Metamorphosis" producer Roy Gabay.</TE>
<TE>   Springer Opera: A Highlight of Edinburgh</TE>
<TE>   A concert production of the completed "Jerry Springer: The Opera"
has become the must-see event at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. In
its first outing since a London workshop last February, the show sold
out, drawing luminaries such as Cameron Mackintosh, director Nicholas
Hytner ("The Madness of King George") and composer Andrew Lloyd
Webber.</TE>
<TE>   Hytner described the piece as a "marriage of high and low
culture."</TE>
<TE>   "To hear the kind of vulgar chaos of Jerry Springer submitted to
the disciplines of classical opera results in more than the sum of
those two halves," he was quoted as saying in the London newspaper
the Telegraph.</TE>
<TE>   The show features expletive-filled arias, a chorus line of
quick-stepping Ku Klux Klan members and a host of pathetic talk-show
guests. Though interest from West End producers in London is great,
creators Richard Thomas and Stewart Lee have not made a decision
about the show's future.</TE>
<TE>   POP/ROCK</TE>
<TE>   Festival Seating for Springsteen Concert</TE>
<TE>   A ban on the festival seating arrangement that contributed to a
fatal 1979 stampede at a Cincinnati arena will be lifted for a Bruce
Springsteen concert this fall.</TE>
<TE>   The singer requested that the city reinstate such general
admission seating, in which fans stand instead of taking assigned
seats on the main floor. The city has allowed only reserved seating
since 11 people attending a Who concert were trampled to death after
fans rushed the doors at what was then known as Riverfront Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati police defended the decision to lift the ban for the
Springsteen concert. "They're not a crowd likely to get rowdy and
cause trouble," said spokesman Lt. Kurt Byrd. Paul Wertheimer, a
Chicago-based safety consultant, disagreed. "People all the time
forget the lessons of the past," he said.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Three members of the British rock group Oasis--guitarist Noel
Gallagher, bass player Andy Bell and keyboard player Jay
Darlington--suffered cuts and bruises Tuesday when a taxi in which
they were riding was involved in a head-on collision in Indianapolis.
Wednesday evening's concert was canceled.... The Geffen Playhouse is
extending the special engagement of mime Marcel Marceau through Aug.
25. On Friday, the show set a Geffen box-office record, selling
$34,395 worth of tickets in one day.... Island Def Jam Records is
releasing what is being billed as Mariah Carey's comeback album on
Dec. 10.</TE>

<LD>* Alison Moorer, "Miss Fortune," Universal South. In her third solo
album, this Alabama-bred singer steps away from her
neo-traditionalist country music stance for a more pop-edged,
radio-friendly approach, complete with lots of string-assisted gloss.
Moorer's soulful voice is not enough to make tunes like "Tumbling
Down" and "Cold in California" appear unconventional. You get the
feeling that her production team spent more time on the album's
musical design and lost track of the challenge of actually saying
something.</LD>

<LD>* New this week: Patrick Stettner's crackling, unpredictable "The
Business of Strangers" teams Stockard Channing, a commanding presence
in all media, and Julia Stiles, one of the most fearless and talented
young actresses in Hollywood today. The film is a witty, razor-sharp
study of character informed by Stettner's observations while working
as an office temp. A series of events brings the two women together
as they wait for their flights in an airport bar. It's at this point
that it is possible to appreciate just how adroitly Stettner has
brought very different women face to face. The writer-director
displays a sure sense of structure that is at once dramatic and
cinematic, and reveals layer after layer of character. Kevin Thomas</LD>

<HD>L'Orangerie's New Chef Returns to French Nouvelle</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA STRAND</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nouvelle Deja Vu: The search was on as soon as executive chef Ludo
Lefebvre called it quits at L'Orangerie. Whom would owner Gerard
Ferry find to fill Ludo's sizable shoes? Ferry has settled on
Christophe Eme, a 33-year-old Frenchman who was working as executive
chef at Auberge des Templiers, a Michelin two-star restaurant in the
Loire Valley. Eme describes his cuisine as French nouvelle revisited.</LD>
<LD>   "Nouvelle cuisine was very popular in the '70s and '80s," he says.
"The idea was to replace the traditional heavy sauces with juices
from meats and vegetables, but by the early '80s, chefs went crazy.
If you strip the excesses away, the idea behind nouvelle cuisine is
beautiful. It's about flavor and the quality of the ingredients."</LD>
<LD>   Eme, who started three weeks ago, will revisit nouvelle cuisine's
original form, but with his own approach. "I don't use butter or
cream," he says. "I prefer emulsions and jus. I also use flavors from
around the world. They are the accessories of the dish. It's like a
beautiful outfit--add too many pins, bracelets and necklaces, and the
clutter can ruin the look. It's the same with food."</LD>
<TE>   A New Chef at Reign: Beverly Hills' Reign has hired chef Richard
Petty to take over the kitchen from Michael Rosen. Since moving to
L.A. eight years ago, Petty has worked for Wolfgang Puck and Joachim
Splichal and has been executive chef at the Beverly Hills Hotel and
Monty's Steakhouse. "I'm cooking fresher, lighter Southern food,"
says Petty. He uses "a little bit of Memphis soul, Carolina
low-country cuisine, Cajun and Creole mixed with recipes from the
Gulf shores, all with a contemporary spin." Samples: filet mignon
with Africaine sauce and grits, fried catfish with sweet potato
fries.</TE>
<TE>   * Reign, 180 N. Robertson Blvd., (310) 273-4463.</TE>
<TE>   Dodd Mitchell Is Everywhere: It's not just one or two restaurants
that this designer is responsible for, it's Katana, Sushi Roku,
Falcon, Balboa, Pearl Dragon, Gaucho Grill (Brentwood), Avenue (opens
Sept. 1) and Voda. (How does he do it? "I work an 18-hour day. When
I've got so much going on, I sleep at the office.... I even have a
bed in the back room.") Now Dodd Mitchell is adding the Zen Grill and
Sake Bar in Westwood to his list. With its hand-carved Buddha bar and
more than 100 sakes from around the world, he says, "It will be a
spiritual experience mixed with amazing food. You'll feel you're far,
far away from the U.S."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he's at work on Dolce in the old Chardonnay
location on Melrose. "I'm blowing out the ceiling and dropping a
25-foot tree into the back patio," says Mitchell. "I want this to be
a different kind of Italian restaurant with a great Italian wine bar
... something L.A. has never seen." He's planning on opening these
two restaurants before the New Year.</TE>
<TE>   Dodd, who is a partner in all the restaurants he designs, is also
redesigning the Huntley/Radisson Hotel in Santa Monica with its
7,000-square-foot restaurant boasting a panoramic oceanfront view.</TE>
<TE>   If he keeps up this high-octane pace, soon he may have no time to
sleep.</TE>

<LD>The American Cinematheque's third annual Festival of Fantasy, Horror
&amp; Science Fiction runs tonight through Aug. 25, opening with a 20th
anniversary screening at 7:30 p.m. of "Star Trek II: The Wrath of
Khan," often regarded as the best of the "Star Trek" movies. More
than the other films in the series, it recaptures the spirit of the
beloved TV series, emerging as a brisk, handsomely designed film
whose hardware never overwhelms its humanity.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Winfield and Walter Koenig, stalwarts in an ensemble cast,
are scouting for a dead planet as a site for a life-generating
experiment when they come across a long-banished nemesis of Adm. Kirk
(William Shatner) of the starship Enterprise. Called Khan (Ricardo
Montalban, a splendid, robust villain), he is described disdainfully
as "a product of late 20th century genetic engineering." Kirk had
come to the rescue of Khan and his people years before, only to have
Khan try to steal the Enterprise and murder Kirk. What if the
cunning, megalomaniacal Khan latched on to the Enterprise's Project
Genesis, as its current mission is called?</LD>
<TE>   Writers Jack B. Sowards and Harve Bennett shrewdly shift the
emphasis away from answering that question to concentrate on how the
threat of Khan shakes Kirk out of middle-age malaise and makes him
feel young again. Shatner and Leonard Nimoy as Mr. Spock give
relaxed, engaging performances. Much of the credit for the film's
spirit must go to director Nicholas Meyer, who has understood the
necessity of preserving "Star Trek's" essential squareness while
regarding it with an affection that saves it from stodginess.</TE>
<TE>   Following a 7 p.m. Friday screening of "Jaws," Shinsuke Sato's
bleakly compelling "The Princess Blade" (2000) screens at 9:15 in its
Los Angeles premiere. First filmed in 1973 as a traditional-style
saga of samurai revenge, it has been boldly and imaginatively re-set
in the near future. For generations, members of the Takemikazuchi
clan have stuck together since losing their positions as
swords-for-hire guards to a deposed monarch. They are now in the
service of the government to put down any rebels in what has become
an escalating consumer society with an accompanying loss of freedom
of expression.</TE>
<TE>   On the verge of her 20th birthday, at which time she would become
the clan ruler with the title of princess, the peerless swordswoman
Yuki (Yumiko Shaku) learns that her mother had not been killed by
clan enemies 15 years earlier but by its current leader Byakurai
(Kyusaku Shimada).</TE>
<TE>   Yuki crosses paths with a government rebel, Takashi (Hideaki Ito),
who has grown weary of the deaths caused by his group's terrorist
attacks in the name of freedom. The two disillusioned young people
start to fall in love and begin dreaming of leaving the country for a
new life. But can they escape their violent pasts?</TE>
<TE>   Their story is told with such rigor and spare visual style that it
is quickly involving. For martial arts fans, the film is studded with
bravura swordplay staged by Donnie Yen, who choreographed the fight
scenes for the recent "Blade II."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday brings one of Curtis Harrington's best films, "Games"
(1967), in which an enigmatic Simone Signoret sets off a sinister
round of fun and games in the apartment of young couple James Caan
and Katharine Ross. It screens at 5 p.m. and will be followed by the
premiere of Harrington's "Usher," his elegant and eerie 38-minute
retelling of Poe's "The Fall of the House of Usher." Sean Nepita
plays Truman, a young admirer of the poetry of Roderick Usher
(Harrington) and comes to visit him in his elegant Hollywood Hills
castle, where Usher lives a reclusive, aristocratic existence with
his ailing sister. Usher is very grand, very formal, but is clearly
lonely and suffused with a sense of mortality, warming to Truman's
sincere, deferential manner. But will the hothouse atmosphere of the
Ushers' closed world be able to withstand the breath of fresh air
Truman represents? Photographed in rich color and an evocative play
of light and shadow by Gary Graver, "Usher" is a poignant,
exquisitely wrought vignette that marks a return to filmmaking by a
master of the macabre after too long an absence. Harrington will
discuss his films following their screening.</TE>
<TE>   Also premiering, Saturday at 8:30 p.m., is Neil Marshall's
terrific horror film "Dog Soldiers," which finds a group of British
soldiers on exercise maneuvers in a remote area of the Scottish
Highlands, where people tend to disappear.</TE>
<TE>   Before one can say "The Blair Witch Project," some very scary
stuff starts happening--scarier (and gorier) than what occurred in
that low-budget 1999 hit. Sean Pertwee, Kevin McKidd and Emma Cleasby
star. Eminently skippable is the Saturday 10:30 p.m. show, "At
Midnight I'll Steal Your Soul" (1962). An arty cross between "Psycho"
and "Blood Feast," Christophe Ali and Nicolas Bonilauri's "Le Rat"
(Sunday at 3 p.m.) is strictly for those strong of stomach. Amid a
lot of moody, shadowy visuals and gruesome images, an elderly rural
man (Marcel Fix), haunted by his childhood discovery of his mother's
horribly mutilated corpse, has apparently spent his life luring young
women to his remote and ancient house to kill them, each for a
different body part. But as we meet him, he is beginning to be
tormented by a rat scurrying through his walls and across his
floors--and also confronted with unexpected competition for victims.
Without dialogue--and with much graphic horror. (323) 466-FILM.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the Cinematheque takes a break from fantasy, horror
and sci-fi to continue its "Andy Warhol Does Hollywood" series with a
7:30 p.m. screening of one of Warhol's most accessible yet rarely
revived films, "My Hustler" (1965). Truly timeless, it's a coolly
amusing observation of a twitchy summer afternoon on Fire Island.</TE>
<TE>   "My Hustler" is essential Warhol in its casual detachment combined
with often outrageous dark humor. (323) 466-FILM.</TE>

<TE>   The Los Angeles County Museum of Art's "William Wyler and the
Tradition of Excellence" continues Friday at 7:30 p.m. with one of
Wyler's most cherished pictures, "The Best Years of Our Lives," his
1946 film from Robert Sherwood's script, which struck a deep and
lasting note with audiences.</TE>
<TE>   It masterfully tells of the homecoming from World War II of
several very different men living in the same small city, who face
challenges adjusting to civilian life. They are banker Fredric March,
soda jerk Dana Andrews and nice guy Harold Russell, who now has hooks
where his arms and hands used to be and is afraid to face his fiancee
(Cathy O'Donnell).</TE>
<TE>   The great homecoming scene between March and Myrna Loy, who plays
his wife, was inspired by Wyler's own return to his wife, Margaret
Tallichet. With Teresa Wright, Virginia Mayo and Hoagy Carmichael.

<TE>   The UCLA Film and Television Archive's 11th annual Festival of
Preservation continues at Melnitz Hall's James Bridges Theater.
Following the 7 p.m. Saturday screening of "Crooked Alley" (1922),
which was part of an early Boston Blackie series and which stars
Thomas Carrigan and Laura La Plante, "Barriers of the Law" (1925)
will screen. It is a typical crime melodrama of the period but is
exceptionally well-photographed by Walter Griffin and boasts some
strikingly composed shots. It was directed by J.P. McGowan from a
story by William Lester, and it stars two veterans of serials,
McGowan's wife, Helen Holmes, and William Desmond.</TE>
<TE>   McGowan himself plays the villain, who very successfully smuggles
liquor through the harbor at San Pedro. Holmes is the daughter of a
harbor pilot who has become ensnared in McGowan's operations. Holmes
thus falls into McGowan's clutches, escaping them only to wind up in
the arms of Desmond, who turns out to be the West Coast chief of the
IRS and therefore out to nail McGowan as his top priority. Not
surprisingly, complications escalate rapidly--and not without plot
holes. Holmes and Desmond, both nearing the end of their stardom, are
well-matched as a decidedly mature couple. "Barriers of the Law" is a
modest film, but it remains a lively diversion that makes fine use of
actual locales. (310) 206-FILM.</TE>

<TE>   Note: the Western States Black Research and Educational Center
will present Friday and Saturday at the Autry Museum of Western
Heritage its "Reel Black Cowboy Film Festival," which will salute
Glynn Turman, who stars in "Thomasine &amp; Bushrod" (1974), screening
Saturday at 4:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   There will be a banquet with live entertainment Friday evening.

<HD>Multiple Problems Put 'Inside Out' on the Couch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The title of the musical "Inside Out" suggests that its five women
who are in group therapy together are each going to get a thorough
psychological examination in song. The show looks a little like a
would-be "A Chorus Line."</LD>
<LD>   But "Inside Out," by Doug Haverty and Adryan Russ, lacks the
narrative drive engendered by the competitive element in "A Chorus
Line." It also lacks memorable songs. The characters remain largely
predictable and superficial.</LD>
<LD>   Still, it's conceivable that "Inside Out," which was known as
"Role Play" and "Reaching Up" in earlier L.A. incarnations, could be
a lot more engaging than it is in the current version, mounted by
Woodland Hills Theatre at the West Valley Playhouse.</LD>
<TE>   Noel Britton's staging is plagued by miscasting and by long
blackouts between scenes that kill the momentum.</TE>
<TE>   It's not a washout. Elizabeth Marone is tart and tough as the
executive who needs more domestic down time. Director Britton, who
plays a lesbian worried about her teenage son, sings well and has the
character's sense of cheerful denial about her nonexistent love life
firmly in hand.</TE>
<TE>   Courtney Ter-Velde and Diana March aren't bad as an overwhelmed
young mom with a flirty husband and as a stereotyped flower child,
respectively. But in terms of their looks, it would make more sense
if they switched roles. Ter-Velde's character is obsessed with her
weight. The other women scoff at her concerns, but the character
should at least look as if she might have struggled with the issue.
Ter-Velde looks so trim and compact that the subject seems to come
out of nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   As the other two women, Bonnie Robertson and Dante Montgomery
share a similar inability to project their singing voices whenever
the score gets louder than a lullaby. With Robertson, who plays the
therapist, it's not quite as crucial a problem as it is with
Montgomery, who plays a former pop star. Although the character's
star has fallen, it isn't because her voice has declined. She even
has a solo titled "All I Do Is Sing," which seems unfortunately
ironic, especially considering that her triumphant return to
performing is supposed to be the show's grand finale.</TE>

<HD>Philharmonic Shows Off Its Line for Export</HD>
<DH>With Salonen conducting, the Europe-bound orchestra gives a
robust performance of a cautious program at the Bowl.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Esa-Pekka Salonen returned to the Hollywood Bowl on Tuesday night to
lead the first of four programs this week and next that contain the
works the Los Angeles Philharmonic will take on its European tour
later in the month. And things began looking up.</LD>
<LD>   As if to indicate that the program would not be business as usual,
the orchestra was dressed in its formal concert-hall attire of black,
rather than the usual white jackets the players favor outdoors. A
spokesperson for the Philharmonic cautioned reading anything into a
costume change, saying that it was only for publicity photos. Still,
the players, who seemed to have already fallen into late summer
doldrums on opening night, must have felt different in formal attire.</LD>
<LD>   They certainly sounded different with their music director on the
podium. And Salonen's wake-up call reached the far corners of the
amphitheater, from the sound booth, where the amplification is
controlled, to the attentive, appreciative audience.</LD>
<TE>   Tour programs tend toward excessive showiness, overeager
weightiness or some surprises, the out-of-town orchestra determined
to impress in whatever way it can. However, the Philharmonic's tour
agenda is neither particularly spectacular nor uncommon. The only
rarity is Shostakovich's Soviet-inflamed Second Symphony, which will
be used as foil to Beethoven's populist Ninth at tonight's concert.</TE>
<TE>   Most of this tour will comfortably settle on colorful, well-liked
works from the early 20th century. On paper, it looks unusually
cautious for an orchestra proud of its reputation for adventure; and,
inexplicably, there is nothing by Salonen, whose music you would
imagine to be one of the orchestra's selling points.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's program was certainly a cautious one, with
tried-and-true Debussy, Bartok and Prokofiev. The soloist in Bartok's
First Piano Concerto was Yefim Bronfman, who recorded Bartok's three
piano concertos with Salonen and the Philharmonic in 1994. Though
that disc won a Grammy, I've always found it a little too fast and
insubstantial. Likewise the Philharmonic's recording of Debussy's
"Iberia," from 1996, is appealing but slightly generic.</TE>
<TE>   It was good to walk into the Bowl with those recordings fresh in
the ear, because it was immediately evident, even given the
amplification, just how much Salonen and his band have grown.
"Iberia" was extraordinary, full of Salonen's distinct musical
personality. Exotic woodwind lines in the first movement, "In the
Streets and Byways," were made to sound as eventfully pungent and
quirky as Salonen's own woodwind orchestral writing often is. The
slow movement, "Perfumes of the Night," heavy-handed on the
recording, was taken at almost exactly the same slow speed, but now,
beautifully sustained, became compellingly erotic. The spectacularly
played last movement, "Morning of a Festival Day," was unadulterated
adrenaline.</TE>
<TE>   Salonen and Bronfman have not slowed down their Bartok; if
anything the accelerations, as in the development section of the
concerto's first movement, are more daring. But, as in the Debussy,
there is a new confidence, a new level of expression, a new
immediacy. Throwing his weight into some of Bartok's most percussive
piano writing, Bronfman has become like a force of nature.</TE>
<TE>   For Prokofiev's "Romeo and Juliet," Salonen has selected his own
suite, with 11 numbers from the full ballet, encapsulating the
Shakespearean narrative. Everything always sounds better at the Bowl
after intermission, and the Prokofiev was no exception, as something
of the visceral intensity of a large orchestra was captured by the
amplification. And it was visceral intensity that Salonen was after,
in an operatically vivid and richly textured reading that
enthusiastically exploited the orchestra's big sound.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to the necessity of preparing for a tour, these four
concerts with Salonen will be better rehearsed and more interestingly
thought out than the typical Tuesday or Thursday at the Bowl. The
first of them also proved that the great outdoors can still
accommodate great music and music making. Audiences turned off by
ever increasing Bowl commercialism, they should well reconsider--at
least through next week.</TE>
<TE>   Esa-Pekka Salonen conducts the Los Angeles Philharmonic, tonight
at 8, Hollywood Bowl, 2301 N. Highland Ave., Hollywood, $1-$76. (323)
850-2000.</TE>

<DH>An exhibition of Malick Sidibe's photographs reveals his
native Mali as a young country in love with music</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA HUNDLEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A young couple dance together, heads down and close in the heat of a
late-night courtyard. A woman crouches low on a bare cement floor,
smiling shyly and clutching a glittering handbag. A man poses under a
rack of battered 45s, dark eyes gazing with sly bemusement over the
curve of his coat collar. In Malick Sidibe's photographs, the dance
halls and social clubs of mid-'60s West Africa have come alive,
captured with a strangely seductive blend of artistry, portraiture
and straight social documentation.</LD>
<LD>   Born in 1936 in Mali, Sidibe opened Studio Malick in 1958, in the
capital city of Bamako, a location from which he still works.</LD>
<LD>   Over the years, he has produced everything from family portraits
to architectural photographs. His images of Bamako's '60s and
early-'70s youth culture have made an indelible mark in the art
world, gaining him critical acclaim and exhibition around the globe.
For the Patrick Painter Gallery in Bergamot Station, actor Matt
Dillon has hand-picked some of Sidibe's best work from this period, a
group of stunning black-and-white images taken at the parties and
gatherings indicative of Mali's newly burgeoning nightlife.</LD>
<TE>   "I've never curated a show before, but I've always had a strong
interest in art," Dillon says of the show, which runs through Aug.
24. "I knew Sidibe photos and loved them. There was something so
spirited and energetic about these images, so when I was asked to do
this, I jumped."</TE>
<TE>   Sidibe's photos are alluring because they capture not only the
remarkable universality of the '60s experience but also the
exuberance of a country in the throes of reinvention. Having gained
its independence from France in 1960, Mali was moving through a
remarkable political transformation that coincided with the seduction
of its young by exported American pop culture. Soul, rock and early
R&amp;B had crossed the seas. James Brown and platforms, Jimi Hendrix and
bell-bottoms had arrived in West Africa.</TE>
<TE>   In Sidibe's photos, music is a constant. Its presence is felt
everywhere, in the movements of the dancers, in the wild grins of
partygoers, in the coy glance of a girl waiting to be asked onto the
floor. In one image, a speaker leans half-hidden in a palm tree. In
another, a battered record player sits next to stack of treasured
LPs.</TE>
<TE>   For Dillon, an audiophile, music became the show's thematic
thread. "The emphasis is less on the portraiture and more on the
parties," Dillon explains, "and music was such a part of that world.
The thing I really loved was there was a real innocence in their love
of music as well. It was without prejudice. You see one girl holding
up a James Brown album, you see Afro-Cuban LPs in the background, you
see a kid standing in a hat that says Elvis Presley across the brim,
and it's all given the same weight. They loved music without the
hang-ups that American kids might have had at the time." That
innocence can be seen in the easy trust between Sidibe and his
subjects. There is a relaxed, open feel to the photos, making it
obvious he was not only a voyeur but a participant as well. His
presence was part of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I was the artist and people trusted me," Sidibe said of his work
in a 1998 interview with Andre Magnin, curator for the Contemporary
African Art Collection, housed in Geneva. "This just made the photos
all the better. I was always on the lookout for a photo opportunity,
a light-hearted moment, an original attitude or some guy who was
really funny."</TE>
<TE>   "When he came around, they came alive," Dillon says. "There's so
much soul and spirit in those pictures and in those faces.... A
director once told me that the greatest location of all was the human
face, and I think Sidibe knew that."</TE>

<HD>A Season With 'Simpsons'</HD>
<DH>The second year of the Fox series arrives on DVD with

<LD>Don't have a cow, man! The second season of Fox's Emmy Award-winning
animated series "The Simpsons" is finally out on DVD (Fox, $50). The
four-disc set features all 20 episodes from the sophomore year of the
Fox series. Among the installments are "Bart Gets an F," the very
first "Treehouse of Horror," "Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Marge" and "The Way
We Was."</LD>
<LD>   Each episode includes wryly amusing commentary from creator Matt
Groening, as well as various producers, animators, directors and
executive producer James L. Brooks. Bonus material includes the very
first Butterfinger commercial featuring Bart as the pitchman,
interviews with Groening and Brooks, "Do the Bartman" musical video
with commentary, the "Deep Deep Trouble" music video with optional
commentary, a foreign language clip and the Simpsons' appearance on
the 1990 Emmy Awards.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Skateboard enthusiasts are the primary audience for "Dogtown and
Z-Boys" (Columbia TriStar, $20 for VHS; $25 for DVD), a fast-paced
documentary about a group of teens from Dogtown, a low-income section
of Venice, Calif., who applied their aggressive surfing style to
skateboarding in the 1970s. The Zephyr Skating Team, which used Jeff
Ho &amp; Zephyr Production Surf Shop as their official hangout, made
their mark during the national skateboard championship in 1975. They
also began skateboarding in empty swimming pools, a prelude to the
now-ubiquitous half-pipe of the extreme sports scene. Stacy Peralta,
one of the original Z-Boys, directed the film and interviews himself
and others about the goings-on that led some of the Z-Boys to success
and left others unknown. The DVD includes deleted scenes, extended
"raw" skate footage, deleted scenes and commentary from Peralta and
editor Paul Crowder.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Director Nicholas Meyer is always asked the same question about
his 1982 film, "Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan": Was that really
Ricardo Montalban's chest? On the exhilarating new double-DVD
(Paramount, $25) of the hit film--considered by most Trekkers and
critics to be the best of the "Star Trek" flicks--Meyer insists that
Montalban's mighty beefcake pecs were truly his own. The veteran
Latino actor devours the screen as the magnetic villain Khan, a role
he created on the original series.</TE>
<TE>   This new special edition features a 116-minute director's cut
(four minutes longer than the original). The commentary from Meyer is
inspired; he even confesses that he was unfamiliar with the 1966-69
NBC sci-fi series when he got the directing assignment. There's also
a fact-filled and often amusing text commentary from Michael Okuda,
the coauthor of the "Star Trek Encyclopedia."</TE>
<TE>   The second disc features three entertaining documentaries: "The
Captain's Log," which includes new cast and crew interviews with
Meyer, stars William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and Montalban and
writer-executive producer Harve Bennett; "Designing Khan," a
comparison between the production, costume and graphic designs of
1979's "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" and "Star Trek II," which had
a modest budget; and "The Visual Effects of Star Trek II: The Wrath
of Khan," which explores the then-cutting edge visual effects created
by ILM.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the disc are 1982-era interviews with Shatner, Nimoy,
Montalban and the late DeForest Kelley, interviews with "Star Trek"
novelists Julia Ecklar and Greg Cox, the trailer and storyboard
archives.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Meyer is also on hand to offer commentary on the DVD (Warner, $20)
for his first feature, the delightful 1979 romantic drama "Time After
Time." Malcolm McDowell, in his first American film and good-guy
role, plays famed British novelist H.G. Wells, who travels in his
time machine from 19th century London to modern-day San Francisco to
track down Jack the Ripper (David Warner). While in pursuit of the
Ripper, Wells finds the time to fall in love with a young woman (Mary
Steenburgen).</TE>
<TE>   In his comments, McDowell acknowledges that he jumped at the
chance to play a nice guy after bringing such nasty characters as
Alex in "A Clockwork Orange" to life. He received the script while he
was making the X-rated "Caligula" and was sick of that film's
violence and sex scenes and thought this would be a happy change of
pace. Not only did the film help change his image, he ending up
marrying Steenburgen.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Also new from Warner is the digital edition of the campy 1981
action-adventure "Clash of the Titans" ($20) starring Harry Hamlin,
Maggie Smith and Laurence Olivier as Zeus! The best thing about the
film is Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion special effects. The DVD
features a new introduction by Harryhausen and a myths and monsters
gallery.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Image Entertainment recently released Luchino Visconti's 1943
Italian drama "Ossessione" ($25), an early example of the country's
neo-realist cinema. This crackling, sexy adaptation of James M.
Cain's "The Postman Always Rings Twice" stars Clara Calmai as an
unhappily married hotel owner who finds herself drawn to a handsome
drifter (Massimo Girotti). The two decide to murder her husband, but
after they kill him, their lives fall into a downward spiral of
deception and lies. The film, which was banned and censored for
several years, is presented in its original uncensored director's cut</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Broken Lizard comedy troupe stars in and wrote "Super
Troopers" (Fox, $27), an infantile comedy about a group of misfit
state troopers from Vermont. The excellent Scottish actor Brian Cox,
who plays their long-suffering boss, is the only reason to watch this
gross-out farce. The DVD includes a "newswrap" of the troupe's
personal appearance tour at colleges; outtakes; 13 extended scenes
with optional commentary from director Jay Chandreskhar, who also
plays the role of Thorny; an alternate ending with director
commentary; and commentary from the comedy troupe.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Deuces Wild" came and went from theaters in a flash last May
despite a strong cast that includes Stephen Dorff, Brad Renfro, James
Franco, Frankie Muniz, Matt Dillon and Fairuza Balk. On the
undistinguished DVD (MGM, $27), director Scott Kalvert and editor
Michael R. Miller discuss the trials and tribulations of shooting the
low-budget action drama set in Brooklyn in 1958 on the Paramount back
lot in Hollywood. But Kalvert should get his facts straight. The film
is set in 1958, but he says in his commentary that it was 1959.</TE>

<DH>At the Drive-In wound down, but Jim Ward and two bandmates
reconfigure as Sparta</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC WEINGARTEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last year, Jim Ward and his cohorts in At the Drive-In did the
unthinkable: They broke up a successful band. After seven years and
on the brink of a breakthrough, the El Paso, Texas, rock band packed
it in, calling off a potentially lucrative career on account of
boredom.</LD>
<LD>   Although many of the band's fans felt slighted, Ward insists it
was the right thing to do.</LD>
<LD>   "You can't base a decision on money or success," says Ward, 25. "I
certainly never played in bands for that reason. We were doing it a
long time, and whether or not the world knew it, we think it ended at
the perfect time."</LD>
<TE>   Ward can afford to be philosophical about At the Drive-In's
dissolution, now that his new band Sparta--which features former
Drive-In members Paul Hinojos, 26, on guitar and Tony Hajjar, 27, on
drums, as well as ex-Belknap bassist Matt Miller, 28--is picking up
right where his old band left off. The group opens Weezer's concert
Friday at Verizon Wireless Amphitheater.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from common band members, there's a fair amount of
continuity. The aggressive, abrasive sound of Sparta's debut album,
"Wiretap Scars," due from DreamWorks Records on Tuesday, doesn't
differ much from At the Drive-In's pile-driving approach, with tracks
such as "Cut Your Ribbon" and "Sans Cosm" finding catharsis in
barbed, neatly patterned guitar noise.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the circumstances surrounding the writing and recording of
"Wiretap Scars" were worlds away from the final days of At the
Drive-In. According to Ward, the passage of time had drained all of
the passion out of his old band.</TE>
<TE>   "We all made a deal that if any one of us wanted to stop, we would
stop," says Ward, who started At the Drive-In as a high school
student in El Paso. "There wasn't a lot of drama involved. We just
wanted a change. If you're done with loving playing, you gotta stop,
no matter how big or small you are."</TE>
<TE>   Ward was ready to shed his teenage skin and make the move into
adulthood.</TE>
<TE>   "The kind of change you go through between the ages of 17 and 24
is huge," says Ward, who got married in March 2001--the same month
the band broke up--and enrolled at the University of Texas at El Paso
in a short-lived attempt to get a civil engineering degree. He even
taught himself how to build radio-controlled airplanes.</TE>
<TE>   "I was doing the stuff I wanted to do," he says. "Then Paul and
Tony came over to the house and asked if I wanted to just hang out
and sing." Ward thought he might be through with bands, but the
allure of playing with friends was pulling him back in. "I had been
playing in bands since I was 12," says Ward. "It felt weird not being
in one."</TE>
<TE>   From a few informal jam sessions emerged Sparta. Ward, who had
been relegated to backup vocals behind the dynamic Cedric Bixler in
At the Drive-in, was now up front as the lead singer. (Bixler and
former ATDI guitarist Omar Rodriguez are attracting attention with
their new band, Mars Volta.)</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you change members, the chemistry changes," says Ward.
"To me, it has made all the difference in the world. But I still
think we should look for a singer. It's a little more stressful. I
can never remember lyrics. I'm going be the youngest singer in the
world with a TelePrompTer on stage."</TE>
<TE>   Sparta, according to Ward, is that rock rarity: a functional
democracy. All of the songwriting is collaborative. "We had eight
songs in a week," says Ward of Sparta's initial convocations. "We all
contributed bits and pieces to all of the songs. It's really fun to
paint over someone else's painting, so to speak."</TE>
<TE>   Most of this material found its way onto a demo, and the response
was overwhelming, he says. Four majors were eager to sign the band,
with DreamWorks eventually closing the deal.</TE>
<TE>   "We got a lot of flak from people who said we were trying to
capitalize on the success of At the Drive-In," says Ward. "But it
wasn't like that. It was just a very easy and organic process."</TE>
<TE>   The four members of Sparta were all reared in El Paso, a city
where the Third World impinges on the First World in ways that are
impossible to avoid. From this vantage point, Ward, who grew up in an
area he classifies as "lower middle class," bore witness to an uneasy
clash of Western values and Hispanic culture.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very Catholic, and there's lots of machismo going on," he
says of his hometown. "Mexican women have a tough time there."</TE>
<TE>   There were no all-ages nightclubs to speak of, so local promoter
Ed Ivy, whom Ward considers a formative influence on his life, would
book punk bands such as Jawbox into hotel ballrooms and school
auditoriums. "We were really lucky to have Ed around," says Ward. "We
all met each other at those gigs."</TE>
<TE>   To this day, Ward resents the increasing popularity of Austin, the
unofficial music capital of Texas, which he feels has lured all of
the talent away from El Paso. Last year, Ward established a label
called Restart to help El Paso bands nurture a music scene there.</TE>
<TE>   "I really have a twisted love for the place," says Ward, who still
lives in El Paso with his wife, Kristine, an education major at UTEP.
"If a few bands from El Paso get popular, people will move there. It
may not a huge deal, but things are always happening."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sparta, with Weezer and Dashboard Confessional, plays Friday at
Verizon Wireless Amphitheater, 8808 Irvine Center Drive, Irvine, 6
p.m. $22.50 to $27.50. (949) 855-8096.</TE>

<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ventura County Fair--ensconced through this weekend--means
different things to different folks, offering entertainment,
exhibitions of all sorts, livestock and, lest we forget, art. As
usual, the fair divides its visual art into categories, the most
democratic being the amateur art exhibition. Here is where most of
the surprises lurk, with art made for its own sake, sneaking into
one's awareness for various reasons.</LD>
<LD>   Local sympathies color the effect of Larry Durham's
black-and-white rendering of the late, beloved Ojai guitarist Larry
Nass, who died too young but left many fond memories in town. Nancy
Wright's tipsy painting of "Dandy's Donuts" pays homage to funky
vernacular architecture in Southern California, and Cecilia Uber's
painting of an abandoned car in dry, overgrown grass by a decrepit
shack exerts a strong atmosphere of chic desolation.</LD>
<LD>   The professional gallery features many names that will pop up in
galleries around the area during the rest of the year. On the lawn
outside the professional gallery is a makeshift sculpture garden, its
unofficial theme being rusty metal critters. Proving that there are
many ways to envision animals in junk metal, Tesi Sanchez-Halpert's
crocodile, made from "found steel," is as roughhewn as Thomas Flores'
buffalo is a more realistic, rust-flecked concoction.</LD>
<TE>   Inside the gallery, Edward K. Hudson's "Swimming Hole" is a
high-contrast vignette that seems to blend Rockwellian wonder and
media experimentation. Rex Kochel's "Waiting on the Shelf" is a
pleasant still-life of pickled foods on a shelf, looking much like
the real thing in the the preserved foods exhibition across the way.</TE>
<TE>   * Ventura County Fair, Seaside Park, 10 W. Harbor Blvd., Ventura.
11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Ends Sunday. $7 general; $4 ages 6-12; free 5 and
younger. (805) 648-3376; www.seasidepark.org/vcfair.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Soul Man Returneth: Velveteen sandpaper soul man Michael McDonald
has his share of relatively local connections, having lived in the
Valley and then the Santa Barbara area before heading to the more
songwriter-friendly climes of Nashville. Next Thursday, McDonald
returns to the region, bringing his blue-eyed soul to the Oxnard
Performing Arts Center.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's latest efforts may have gone little-noticed on radio,
where his voice used to appear regularly as a session singer, solo
artist and member of the Doobie Brothers. But as heard on his latest
album, "Blue Obsession," he continues to make good music on the
sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   * Michael McDonald, next Thursday, 8 p.m., Oxnard Performing Arts
Center, 800 Hobson Way. $36-$41. (805) 486-2424.</TE>

<LD>As one era ends, a new one begins. While celebrating the bittersweet
glam finale of Club Make-Up on Saturday at the El Rey Theater, I
followed the flier trail to the next episode of "As the Scene Turns."
Turns out, everyone's pumpin' up the volume on "electroclash" (think
'80s new wave with a modern twist). Club 7969 in WeHo is
jump-starting again with Friday night's debut of the electroclash
club Synthetic, Jason Lavitt's new dance party. And such clubs as
Cherry, which reopens at the Key Club next Thursday, are also
spinning the "new" new wave. The music can also be heard at Rage on
Mondays and Bang! on Saturdays at the Ruby.</LD>
<LD>   In more 7969 news, the Santa Monica Boulevard venue is now hosting
the hip-hop club Hot Apple Pie on Thursdays and the '80s dance club
Velvet on Saturdays.... Dragonfly's new Sunday night club Disco
Bloodbath serves up darkwave, industrial and gothic tune-age with a
live fetish show. Ouch! ... The new Indian restaurant Tantra is
casting a spell on Silver Lake with two after-parties for the Sunset
Junction festival Aug. 24-25.... With the dog days of summer licking
at my face, I packed up the kids and cruised to Ventura on Monday to
see Sugar Ray at the Ventura County Fair. How sweet it was....</LD>
<TE>   Soul-folk crooner Jake LaBotz tickled my fancy at the Shamrock
Social Club on the Sunset Strip with selections from his new album
"Used to Be." And speaking of excellent local music, Ella Dice's
"Future Hard" offers some serious aural delights. Catch it on the
jukebox at the 4100 club. And let's not forget the new album by
Burgundy Room doorman Torrance Jackson, featuring songs by Motochrist
boy wonder Ricky Vodka. Cheers.... And for Cali-style tunes, there's
nothing tastier than "By the Way," the gorgeous new album by the Red
Hot Chili Peppers. Catch its wave, and you'll be you're sitting on
top of the world.</TE>

<HD>Her Personal Style Is in Flux, but Duboc Still Impresses</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New female artists have been coming down the pike with startling
rapidity since Diana Krall brought new life and soaring profit to the
genre of jazz singing.</LD>
<LD>   The most successful have been those who, like Norah Jones and Jane
Monheit, have carved out their own musical identities, refusing to be
limited by standard definitions.</LD>
<LD>   Southland singer Carol Duboc is taking a similar route. On Monday
night at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill, in a performance celebrating the
release of her new CD, "Duboc," she convincingly displayed the
mainstream jazz phrasing, R&amp;B grooves and Brazilian rhythms that she
has been attempting to formulate into a highly personal musical
style.</LD>
<TE>   With a five-piece band and two backup singers, Duboc's rendering
of such originals as "With All That I Am" (the title song from her
first album) and "It's a Feeling" afforded persuasive evidence of her
capacity to create material with potentially broad appeal.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, her versions of Wayne Shorter's "El Gaucho" and
Bacharach &amp; David's "Anyone Who Had a Heart" revealed that her
crystal-clear voice and warm interpretive skills can produce
similarly impressive work in other stylistic areas, with music by
other writers.</TE>
<TE>   There were a few problems, nonetheless, with the way Duboc was
presented. It was understandable that she chose her surroundings on
some of the tunes to best display her pop-oriented R&amp;B numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Other numbers--enhanced by the stirring flute work of Hubert Laws,
who sat in for a few tunes--placed her in a different sort of
energetic setting.</TE>
<TE>   Yet despite this battery of sounds, she was most effective when
she was singing in the open, free of enveloping textures, and best of
all on the rare occasion when she accompanied herself on the piano.</TE>
<TE>   What became clear by the end of her set was the fact that what
Duboc needs to take her career to the next level is a greater sense
of focus, a feeling for who she intends to be as an artist and a
conclusive answer to the question of whether she can smoothly blend
her areas of musical interest into a coherent, uniquely personal
musical style.</TE>
<TE>   If she can do so, the sky's the limit.</TE>

<HD>County OKs $2.27 Million in Grants for the Arts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County Arts Commission, largely shielded from county
government's budget crunch, has earmarked $2.27 million in grants for
nonprofit cultural groups in 2002-03, a figure just shy of last
year's $2.35 million.</LD>
<LD>   R. Renae Williams, grants manager for the arts commission, said
the grants, which are intended to support day-to-day operations,
amount to 3.4% less than was distributed last year. The county Board
of Supervisors' overall annual spending on the arts commission, which
also advises arts groups and runs other cultural programs, Williams
said, is expected to rise slightly: from $4.72 million in 2001-02 to
a tentative $4.75 million for the 2002-03 fiscal year (July 1, 2002,
to June 30, 2003).</LD>
<LD>   To balance the county's overall $16.3-billion budget, supervisors
have looked at such options as restricting spending on health
services, the Sheriff's Department, welfare and other departments.</LD>
<TE>   Arts grants will go to 196 organizations among a record 217
applicants, Williams said. She attributed the increase in
applications to the commission's campaign to seek out and encourage
folk-arts organizations. Of 75 grant recipients with annual budgets
of less than $100,000, Williams noted, 36 were first-time applicants.
Two examples: the Rangoli Foundation for Art and Culture, a Sherman
Oaks-based East Indian music and dance group that will receive $3,758
over two years; and the Venice-based Thai Community Arts and Cultural
Center, which will receive $2,000 over two years.</TE>
<TE>   The commission's largest grant went to the Los Angeles
Philharmonic Orchestra, which will receive $107,730. The orchestra is
one of 44 grant-recipient groups with annual budgets over $800,000.</TE>

<LD>For viewers who have been left scratching their heads after a
Learning Channel program, here's fair warning: Tonight's documentary
may leave you scratching everything.</LD>
<LD>   "Living With Bugs: A War of Two Worlds" (9 p.m., TLC) is abuzz
with disturbing facts (a pasta and broccoli dinner contains 270
insects and 23 maggots) and disquieting images that you may carry
with you to your grave (the time-lapse film of ravenous crawly things
making short work of a dead fox).</LD>
<LD>   The documentary, done with keen humor and startling photography,
plots insects' relentless campaign for world domination (the
unchecked spread of fire ants and Africanized "killer" bees across
the U.S.), even while we attempt to use them for our own purposes (a
locust is forced to watch "Star Wars" to learn about the insect's
collision-avoidance techniques--I kid you not).</LD>
<TE>   Sometimes we pit one insect against another. In a science lab, a
fly divebombs a fire ant's head, implanting a tiny maggot that will
eventually eat its way out.</TE>
<TE>   But just don't cross these bugs. A scientist wearing beekeeper
togs shows how squashing a single "killer" bee releases a signal that
can be detected by all other bees within a hundred yards or so. Alas,
he has to cut the show-and-tell short when the swarming bees start
getting inside his outfit.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, this is an hour that flies by.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Arden Realty Inc. reported lower earnings for the second quarter and
said it purchased an office project in Torrance.</LD>
<LD>   Arden said it acquired Gateway Towers on 190th Street near the
intersection of the 405 and 110 freeways for about $66 million from
Carlyle Group, a Washington, D.C.-based investment firm.</LD>
<LD>   The property includes two office buildings totaling almost 433,000
square feet that are about 93% leased.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles-based real estate investment trust said funds from
operations fell 6% to $46.6 million, or 70 cents a share, as revenue

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. cut the ratings of some power projects that
supply Southern California Edison to "junk" status, citing
uncertainty about the utility's longer-term credit standing.</LD>
<LD>   The rating agency cited improvements in the credit strength of the
Rosemead-based utility, a unit of Edison International, but said it
was "still impossible to determine Southern California Edison's
long-term credit-worthiness."</LD>
<LD>   SCE, which a year ago was on the brink of bankruptcy, is rated BB
by S&amp;P, a non-investment or junk rating.</LD>
<TE>   The projects were cut to BB from BBB-minus, the lowest investment
grade.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Verizon Communications Inc., the largest U.S. local telephone
company, may be required to share its profit with consumers in
California, three years after regulators ended a similar program.</LD>
<LD>   The California Public Utilities Commission said it will hold
hearings in the fourth quarter to decide whether to reinstate the
profit-sharing plan.</LD>
<LD>   The commission ended a similar program in 1999, in exchange for a
rate cut from New York-based Verizon, because it thought competition
from smaller rivals would crimp the firm's profit, a commission
spokeswoman said.</LD>

<HD>ICN Reports 30% Decline in Profit, Says It Will Release
Spinoff Proposal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News, Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. said Wednesday it would release a review of
its operations within 90 days, including a proposed spinoff of two
units, as it reported a 30% decline in quarterly profit.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of the Costa Mesa-based company jumped $1.05, or 11%, to
$10.30 on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   Investors are anxious to hear a reorganization plan for ICN,
including the spinoff of the company's international business and the
remaining 83% of its Ribapharm unit. Interim Chief Executive Robert
O'Leary is trying to improve the company's operations after replacing
former CEO Milan Panic in June.</LD>
<TE>   "We are reviewing all the products, as well as the geographic
areas we're doing business in, and we will be making decisions to
refocus our business," O'Leary said. "There have been some missteps
here, but the underlying business has tremendous upside."</TE>
<TE>   ICN reported second-quarter earnings of $16.3 million, or 19 cents
a share, down 30% from $23.3 million, or 28 cents, in the year-ago
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The results were roughly in line with Wall Street estimates, which
were slashed last month from 44 cents a share after the company
warned of the earnings shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   Sales rose 16% to $237 million, while selling and administrative
costs rose 30% to $97.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   ICN began a program to reduce overloaded wholesaler drug
inventories during the quarter and is cutting general and
administrative costs, O'Leary said.</TE>
<TE>   ICN, whose shares have dropped 69% this year, hired investment
bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and an unnamed consulting firm last
month to review its business, provide financial advice and evaluate
its spinoff plans.</TE>
<TE>   * Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. reported a decline in second-quarter
earnings on slower sales and higher spending to develop branded
drugs, but the results topped analyst estimates.</TE>
<TE>   The company also said its experimental patch for overactive
bladder, Oxytrol, could receive marketing approval in the second
quarter of next year, after being rejected by the Food and Drug
Administration earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Corona-based Watson said net income, including one-time items,
fell 9.5% to $50 million, or 56 cents a share. Operating earnings
were $44.1 million, or 41 cents, 2 cents higher than analysts'
average estimate.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue was virtually flat at $300 million. Sales of generic drugs
fell 21% to $135 million as Watson lost exclusive rights to sell
copies of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s anti-anxiety drug Buspar. Sales
of Watson's branded medicines rose 25% to $156 million.</TE>
<TE>   The company also said it expects 2002 profit of $1.60 to $1.70 a
share, compared with the consensus estimate of $1.59.</TE>
<TE>   * Clorox Co. reported profit slightly ahead of forecasts for its
fiscal fourth quarter and said it expects to beat analysts' estimates
for the current quarter and fiscal 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The Oakland-based consumer products company posted net income of
$145 million, or 63 cents a share, 2 cents better than analysts
expected. In the year-ago quarter, Clorox had operating earnings of
$107 million, or 45 cents, excluding a $21-million charge for writing
down the value of its Brazilian business and other one-time items.
Sales rose 3% to $1.14 billion.</TE>
<TE>   For 2003, Clorox said it expects a percentage rise in the low
double digits in earnings per share over the $1.92 posted in 2002, or
at least $2.11. It anticipates earnings of 50 cents to 52 cents a
share in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts were expecting $2.07 a share for the year and 49 cents
for the quarter.</TE>

<HD>Few Firms Rushing to Certify Results</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Of 704 firms that must attest to report
accuracy by Aug. 14, leaders at only 87 have done so.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD and DEBORA VRANA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Corporate leaders could begin to distance themselves from the recent
wave of accounting scandals by quickly complying with a government
order to certify the accuracy of their companies' financial reports,
public relations experts say. But so far, few have seized the
opportunity.</LD>
<LD>   To reassure investors that corporate financial reports are
accurate, the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 27 ordered
chief executives and chief financial officers at 947 large U.S.
companies to attest that their latest annual and quarterly reports
are accurate. For the 704 of those companies whose most recent fiscal
quarter ended June 30, the certification deadline is 5 p.m. EDT on
Aug. 14.</LD>
<LD>   But as of Wednesday, executives at only 87 of these companies, or
12%, had filed the required sworn statements, according to the SEC's
Web site, www.sec.gov, and filings reported by Bloomberg News.</LD>
<TE>   Explanations for the sluggish pace begin with human nature.</TE>
<TE>   "Companies are like reporters; they wait till they're right on
deadline to file," said Christi Harlan, an SEC spokeswoman and former
journalist.</TE>
<TE>   She said the SEC expected companies to file the certification
documents at the same time they filed their quarterly SEC financial
reports--known as 10-Qs--and these reports routinely are filed very
close to the SEC's mandated deadlines. When a few corporations such
as General Electric Co. filed early, it surprised the agency, which
had to post its online list of filers faster than anticipated, Harlan
said.</TE>
<TE>   The issue was complicated by accounting-reform legislation signed
July 30 by President Bush. That law, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, requires
all 15,000 U.S. public companies to certify their financial reports
and imposes criminal penalties of up to $5 million and 20 years in
prison on executives who attest to financial statements they know are
false or misleading.</TE>
<TE>   Most companies will be affected by the new law for the first time
when they file their latest quarterly financial statements--the same
deadline the SEC has imposed for certification. Legal experts said
they were unclear about several key aspects of the law, including how
to interpret the limits it places on company loans to executives and
the extent to which foreign companies must certify their results.</TE>
<TE>   Until the SEC clarifies how it will enforce the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, the law is "creating a lot of discomfort among executives and
senior management of companies, as well as their attorneys," said
Gary Apfel, a lawyer at LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene &amp; MacRae in Los
Angeles. He suggested that accounting compliance issues have become a
distraction for many top executives.</TE>
<TE>   "If you were told to file certification papers, and you could go
to prison for 20 years if they turned out false, you'd respond with
an excess of caution too," Apfel said.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate image polishers acknowledge that executives must
carefully study certification issues, but urge them to get on with it
as quickly as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "We've told our clients that the thing the Street and the public
want more than anything else is confidence that companies in which
they have invested--or just companies, period--are honest and
truthful about numbers reporting," said Ron Hartwig, director of U.S.
corporate practice for public relations firm Hill &amp; Knowlton Inc. in
Los Angeles. "And our counsel has been to be among the leaders in
committing to sign."</TE>
<TE>   At Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. in Pasadena, one of the few
companies that decided to file well ahead of the deadline, Chief
Financial Officer John Prosser said investors began anxiously raising
certification questions several weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs decided to end the discussions by filing its forms Friday,
in advance of its quarterly financial statements. When a large
institutional shareholder expressed worries over certification
Tuesday, "It was good to be able to say we'd already done it,"
Prosser said.</TE>
<TE>   Other companies filed certifications early, but only because they
routinely beat the deadline for quarterly reports. Solutia Inc., a
St. Louis chemical company that certified its financial statements
Aug. 1, has for the last several years filed quarterly results with
the SEC the same day it releases earnings, unlike most firms, said
general counsel Karl R. Barnickol.</TE>
<TE>   But most executives still are scrambling to meet with their audit
committees and, in some cases, are requiring for the first time that
their subordinates certify divisional financial results. Many are
apprehensive and some jokingly ask if they can put their assets in a
spouse's name, said attorney Frank Goldstein of Sidley, Austin, Brown
&amp; Wood in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the potential public relations implications, Goldstein
said, many see no advantage to filing early, especially because so
few other companies have done so.</TE>
<TE>   "If there was any advantage to filing early, i.e., General
Electric, that's come and gone," he said, referring to the July 31
certification by GE executives.</TE>
<TE>   The sensitivity of the issue was apparent in the attitudes of such
companies as Walt Disney Co., Mattel Inc. and PG&amp;E Corp., all of
which declined to make executives available to discuss certification.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Ford Motor Co. CEO William Clay Ford Jr., asked to
comment on certification Wednesday during an automotive industry
conference in Michigan, declined, saying: "The SEC is very touchy
about publicity."</TE>
<TE>   Ford, who had lamented in a speech that a few bad apples were
spoiling the reputations of all corporations and executives, added:
"It's only timing. We're going to do the right thing."</TE>
<TE>   Some executives have finessed the issue by pledging to certify
their results but saying they will wait until the deadline to do so.</TE>
<TE>   At Disney, which announced earnings last week, CEO Michael Eisner
and Chief Financial Officer Thomas O. Staggs have said they would
certify the results. But a spokesman said their statements would be
filed at the same time as Disney's quarterly financial statement,
which the company typically files with the SEC on the last possible
day.</TE>
<TE>   Companies that are uncomfortable over certification can get a
five-day extension from the SEC if they are filing a quarterly report
and a 15-day extension for an annual report. They just need to make
the request Aug. 15, like a tardy taxpayer requesting an extension,
said the SEC's Harlan.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say they won't be surprised if a few companies are forced
to restate their results because, as Thomson First Call research
director Chuck Hill said, "they're either under investigation for
fraud or have an idea that it's coming."</TE>
<TE>   Although many companies may have "pushed the edge of the envelope
on accounting practices," Hill said he expects them, along with a
flood of other companies, to file at the last minute.</TE>
<TE>   "What are you going to do? Say you've been too zealous and restate
last year's numbers? No!" Hill said. "You're going to hopefully
change your ways going forward, sign off on last year, cross your
fingers and hope for the best."</TE>
<TE>   To ease the corporate burden, the SEC made the filings due 45 days
after the close of the quarter, the same as regular quarterly
financial filings. Only companies with annual revenue of at least
$1.2 billion were subject to the orders. The SEC initially ordered
947 companies to certify their results, but four of those have since
agreed to be acquired, bringing the total to 943. Reports from the
239 companies whose most recent fiscal quarter didn't end June 30
will be filed over the next several months.</TE>
<TE>   The agency is sorting the statements into those that properly
certify that the financial statements aren't false or misleading,
using SEC-approved language, and those that don't--a process that
could take several weeks after the Aug. 14 deadline, Harlan said.</TE>
<TE>   Companies that don't file certification statements could face
sanctions from the SEC ranging from cease-and-desist orders to
referrals to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution, she
said.</TE>

<HD>Eisner Under More Fire as Stock Sinks</HD>
<DH>Media: Key Disney board members are putting heat on the CEO
to act more aggressively. Shares are at their lowest since November
1994.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES and CLAUDIA ELLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Questions about Michael Eisner's performance as Walt Disney Co.'s
chief executive grew sharper Wednesday as the media giant's stock
fell to an eight-year low in the wake of last week's dismal earnings
forecast and amid shakiness in the company's credit ratings.</LD>
<LD>   What makes the latest round of Disney discontent different from
numerous stretches over the last five years when Eisner has felt heat
at the company is that key directors are increasingly impatient with
its lagging financial performance and stock price.</LD>
<LD>   According to sources close to the board, relations have become
especially strained between Eisner and two of Disney's most powerful
board members, Roy E. Disney and Stanley P. Gold, whose Shamrock
Holdings investment arm has been hurt as the stock price has tumbled.</LD>
<TE>   Although neither Roy Disney nor Gold would comment Wednesday,
sources say the two are pressuring Eisner to lift the company's
plunging stock price, deal more aggressively with such issues as
turning around key divisions such as the ABC television network and
even to clarify his succession plans. Tensions have risen in recent
weeks, including some pointed exchanges between Eisner and Gold,
sources said.</TE>
<TE>   "The board is getting to the point where it is less likely they
are going to be as passive as they have been historically," said
Jeffrey Logsdon, an analyst with investment banking firm Gerard
Klauer Mattison who has covered Disney for years.</TE>
<TE>   But Disney director Ray Watson said the board as a whole supports
Eisner, who has headed the company for the last 18 years.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no interest in going out and bringing an unknown into
this company and this difficult industry when we believe we already
have the best CEO in the business. All companies are under a lot of
pressure right now. His pressure is of his own volition, and the
board is supporting him," Watson said.</TE>
<TE>   Another Disney director, who requested anonymity, said although
Eisner is clearly under pressure, as many CEOs are these days with
stock prices tumbling, "there's no coup going on. The board is taking
a collegial approach to helping create future shareholder value."</TE>
<TE>   Eisner was unavailable Wednesday for comment. Other Disney
executives declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's stock fell 48 cents, or 3.3%, to $13.90 on the New York
Stock Exchange on Wednesday, its lowest close since November 1994.
Last week, Disney announced another quarter of soft earnings, further
warning that the firm's theme park business had eroded. Two
credit-rating firms, Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's Investors Service,
subsequently said they might downgrade Disney's debt.</TE>
<TE>   Tensions at Disney also come in the wake of recent shake-ups at
three rival media companies: AOL Time Warner Inc. Chief Executive
Gerald Levin and Chief Operating Officer Robert W. Pittman resigned
under pressure; Vivendi Universal fired CEO Jean-Marie Messier; and
Bertelsmann ousted Thomas Middelhoff. It also comes as directors
throughout corporate America are being forced to do a better job of
scrutinizing company operations.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the board, given what's going on with corporate
governance, cannot ignore the need to make immediate improvements,"
Logsdon said.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview after Disney's earnings were released last week,
Eisner and Chief Financial Officer Thomas Staggs defended the
company's performance, saying its balance sheet remains strong. They
expressed confidence that the company's theme parks and ABC network
would recover when the economy stabilizes.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner also disclosed moves aimed at defusing long-standing
criticisms that Disney's board is too passive, saying he plans to
reduce its size and strengthen the role of independent directors.</TE>
<TE>   "Do I feel specific pressure?" Eisner said in that interview. "No,
we feel an obligation to do it."</TE>
<TE>   As poorly as Disney has been performing, the company can point to
the stocks of such competitors as AOL Time Warner and Vivendi, both
of which have performed even worse. Some analysts believe this has
helped deflect heat from Eisner. And, they add, some of Disney's
problems are not Eisner's doing but result from the soft economy that
has hurt the advertising marketing and tourism.</TE>
<TE>   "It's under-performing, and some of it's the fault of the
company," said analyst Tom Wolzien, with Sanford C. Bernstein. "The
biggest problem is the combination of the decline of advertising and
ratings at ABC. Theme parks are having a tough time--that's not of
the company's making. But you put that together with problems at ABC,
and people who are supporters of the stock have shifted downward."</TE>
<TE>   Although no single Disney shareholder has enough stock to
single-handedly force a change at the company, the growing rift with
Roy Disney and Gold is important. Roy Disney is the single largest
individual stockholder with 17.5 million shares, according to the
company's proxy statement, and is the nephew of Walt Disney. Gold
runs Roy Disney's Shamrock Holdings investment empire.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, they have been among his staunchest supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Gold played a pivotal role in the last coup at Disney in 1984 that
resulted in Eisner's being hired to turn the company around. In
addition, another of Eisner's longtime supporters, the Bass family of
Texas, last year divested its shares.</TE>
<TE>   But other major investors have been showing signs of impatience as
well. Said Logsdon: "Many institutional investors are very concerned
about the performance of some of Disney's assets."</TE>
<TE>   Eisner's status also has been one of the hottest topics in the
last week among financial pundits, some of whom have been calling for
Eisner to leave. In the online publication Slate, columnist Daniel
Gross published a scathing commentary titled: "The Louse in the Mouse
House--Why Disney's Michael Eisner should be fired."</TE>
<TE>   Disney's 16-member board is scheduled to meet next in late
September. Sources cautioned that the board is not united on taking
any specific action. "The board hasn't coalesced. They aren't in
camps," the source said.</TE>
<TE>   And Disney internal sources insist that the board is not badly
divided and that directors continue to support Eisner.</TE>
<TE>   But Logsdon said the future relationship between Eisner and the
Disney board is uncertain.</TE>

<HD>CEO Accused of Inflating Price of EConnect Stock</HD>
<DH>Securities: The Internet executive faces civil and criminal
charges for allegedly issuing false press releases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORA VRANA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The chief executive of EConnect Inc., a San Pedro-based e-commerce
firm, was arrested Wednesday and charged with repeated violations of
securities laws in an alleged scheme to inflate the company's stock
price using false press releases.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas S. Hughes, 52, was taken into custody at his Rancho Palos
Verdes home and later appeared in federal court in Los Angeles. He
was charged with civil and criminal violations stemming from a joint
probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S. attorney's
office and the FBI.</LD>
<LD>   Regulators hailed the case as a sign of increased cooperation
among securities-law enforcement agencies in Southern California and
as an example of the SEC's public vow to prosecute repeat securities
law offenders.</LD>
<TE>   "These actions demonstrate the SEC's commitment to 'real-time
enforcement' and to the vigorous prosecution of those who repeatedly
violate the federal securities laws," said Randall R. Lee, head of
the SEC's Pacific regional office in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint alleges that Hughes is in contempt of court for
violating the terms of an injunction issued against him in April 2000
in a prior SEC case, which prohibited him from further violations of
securities laws.</TE>
<TE>   The previous case also charged Hughes with issuing phony press
releases designed to boost the firm's stock. One of the claims Hughes
made was that the company had a "unique licensing arrangement"
involving hand-held devices made by Palm Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Since July 10, Hughes and EConnect again have been issuing "false
and misleading" press releases and have posted false statements on
the firm's Web site, causing the share price to rise more than 500%,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Those claims included that EConnect had a stock repurchase plan,
that the company received an investment of $20 million in highly
rated bonds and that the firm received a purchase order for nearly $1
million of its ECash pad product, the complaint alleges.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the ECash pad claim, "the apparent purchaser has
denied any knowledge of EConnect," the complaint said.</TE>
<TE>   EConnect's shares, traded over the counter, rose from 24 cents on
June 26 to a closing high of $2.86 on July 15. They fell back to 93
cents by July 24, the day before the SEC suspended trading in the
stock. (The share prices are adjusted for the company's recent
1-for-100 reverse stock split.)</TE>
<TE>   Formed in 1997, EConnect touted plans to be a leader in products
that would help businesses and consumers with e-commerce. Its ECash
pad was designed to facilitate secure Internet transactions from
home, the company has said. The business has yet to turn a profit.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC complaint also charges EConnect investors Richard Epstein
of Tampa, Fla., and Alliance Equities Inc. of Coral Springs, Fla.,
with violations of insider trading regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Since June, Epstein and Alliance Equities have dumped more than 74
million EConnect shares, raising about $770,000, but failed to report
the sales to the SEC and the public, the SEC said.</TE>
<TE>   The government is seeking disgorgement of the proceeds from
Epstein and Alliance Equities.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes wasn't available for comment Wednesday. Neither was his
attorney, Irving M. Einhorn. A call to the company was not returned.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, Hughes faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in
prison and a $1-million fine. The SEC also is seeking to bar him from
acting as an officer or director of a publicly traded company.</TE>
<TE>   His arraignment was set for Sept. 3.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the rash of corporate scandals this year,
regulators have been under pressure to bring securities law violators
to justice and to bring criminal, as well as civil, charges to bear,
as a deterrent effort.</TE>
<TE>   "This office and the Department of Justice are committed to
protecting the investing public from those who seek to manipulate
securities markets for their own profit," said Debra Yang, U.S.
attorney for the Central District of California.</TE>

<HD>FCC Proposes Record Penalty in Junk-Fax Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday proposed a record
$5.38-million fine against a California company that allegedly
inundated businesses and consumers with millions of pages of
unsolicited faxes.</LD>
<LD>   The action against Fax.com Inc. of Aliso Viejo was meant to send a
message to those who violate the federal Telephone Consumer
Protection Act and burden junk-fax recipients with the cost of paper,
ink and other items associated with receiving unsolicited faxes.</LD>
<LD>   The FCC also issued citations to more than 100 businesses that
used Fax.com services, saying they could be liable for financial
penalties if they continue to send unsolicited faxes.</LD>
<TE>   "We have proposed the maximum statutory fine [because] this is a
company that appears to be in the business of violating the law and
hurting consumers for profit," said David Solomon, chief of the FCC's
bureau of enforcement. "What they did was blatantly unlawful.... I
can assure consumers that we will take additional actions, if
necessary," to stop this practice.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC found that Fax.com apparently violated federal law and
agency rules on 489 occasions. It imposed the maximum fine of $11,000
for each violation. The company has 30 days to appeal to the FCC's
commissioners.</TE>
<TE>   Fax.com executives could not be reached for comment. Mary Ann
Wymore, a St. Louis attorney who represents the company, said Fax.com
believes its faxing activity is constitutionally protected free
speech. She added that the company intends to pursue its rights to
the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   "We are disappointed in the FCC's action," Wymore said. "We are
going to pursue this to the Supreme Court, and we have every
expectation that" we will be upheld.</TE>
<TE>   Although marketing by facsimile has lost some of its allure amid
the emergence of e-mail and the Internet, modern technology has
enabled Fax.com and its rivals to broadcast, for a fee on behalf of
others, millions of faxes a day at dramatically lower costs than was
possible a decade ago. Fax.com says it maintains the "the industry's
largest fax number database."</TE>
<TE>   According to the FCC and industry sources, Fax.com compiled its
formidable database by using computers to randomly dial millions of
phone numbers and "listen" for a telltale fax tone. When the machines
hear a tone, it adds the number to its database as a potential
junk-fax recipient.</TE>
<TE>   Fax.com also uses computers to send millions of faxes
electronically to other fax machines across the country with little
or no cost or human assistance.</TE>
<TE>   But the faxes can be financially burdensome, tying up recipients'
machines for hours and even endangering lives.</TE>
<TE>   Physician Robert McMeekin complained to the FCC that he received
unsolicited advertisements from Fax.com on a line that is reserved
for patient medical data and said he worried that "serious disruption
to patient care" could be caused by such unwanted faxes.</TE>
<TE>   Washington law firm Covington &amp; Burling sued Fax.com for $2.45
million in damages last year after receiving 1,634 unsolicited
advertisements during the week of June 4, 2001. "What happened to us
was very damaging ... and that's what prompted us to take legal
action," said Jason Levine, an attorney at Covington &amp; Burling. "This
was a huge problem for the firm to have our fax lines" tied up.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC said in a 1995 federal court case that junk faxes are
burdensome because they cost recipients 3 to 40 cents a page. Wymore
said the agency's estimates are inflated and based on older fax
technology that used more costly thermal fax paper.</TE>
<TE>   Today, she said, unsolicited faxes cost only 2 to 4 cents a page
and are not financially burdensome. She added that Fax.com has a
toll-free number consumers can call to be excluded from receiving
unsolicited faxes.</TE>
<TE>   However, the FCC said several consumers complained that they were
unable to be removed from Fax.com's database. The agency said
information on Fax.com's "Web site creates [an] erroneous impression"
about the steps consumers needed to take to opt out.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates applauded the FCC's crackdown, saying it was
long overdue in an industry plagued by unscrupulous operators.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a big problem because sending a junk fax is cheaper than
sending something by mail," said Steve Kirsh, who operates the
anti-junk-fax Web site www.junkfax .org.</TE>
<TE>   Faxes, he added, are "more likely to be read than e-mail." As a
result, there has been growing marketing demand for fax services
offered by companies such as Fax.com.</TE>
<TE>   "I personally get 100 junk faxes a month at home and [another] 100
faxes a month at work," Kirsh said. "It's a big problem."</TE>

<HD>Ford Hopes to Quell Emissions Rhetoric</HD>
<DH>Autos: CEO wants to work with California to resolve debate
over its new law restricting greenhouse gases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TRAVERSE CITY, Mich.</DL>
<LD>Adopting a conciliatory tone toward California's new vehicle
emissions law, Ford Motor Co. Chief Executive William Clay Ford Jr.
said Wednesday he hopes to "lower the temperature" of the debate over
automotive greenhouse gases.</LD>
<LD>   Auto makers say they plan to file suit against a law signed by
Gov. Gray Davis last month that will greatly restrict the gases
emitted by cars and trucks that contribute to global warming,
primarily carbon dioxide.</LD>
<LD>   "We'd like to lower the temperature a bit and lower the rhetoric
in California and work toward trying to get a reasonable solution,"
Ford told reporters at an annual auto industry conference at this
lakeside town in northern Michigan. He said he wanted to work with
the California Air Resources Board and state legislature to defuse
the issue.</LD>
<TE>   The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a Washington-based
grouping of most major auto makers in the U.S. including Ford, has
said it will seek to turn over the legislation by filing suit in
California.</TE>
<TE>   Ford, who has a reputation as perhaps the most environmentally
minded auto executive in Detroit, also criticized governmental
interference in the automotive business. "People used to write songs
about T-Birds and Corvettes. Now they write regulations," he said to
applause from several hundred participants.</TE>
<TE>   He wouldn't comment on whether Ford would join the lawsuit, but
said he hoped there could be a meeting of the minds with backers of
the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "In Europe you've had a collaborative effort between government,
manufacturers and NGOs [non-governmental organizations]" regarding
automotive emissions, Ford said. "Everyone's signed onto it, it's a
relatively painless procedure. Here, a lot of people are lobbing
bombs at each other."</TE>
<TE>   California Air Resources Board Chairman Alan Lloyd told The Times
on Tuesday that he plans to meet with automotive executives to
resolve differences and avoid a lawsuit. But he also called some
advertisements put out in California by opponents of the law
"misinformation" and "disgusting."</TE>
<TE>   Under the law, standards must be drawn up regarding greenhouse gas
reduction in two years.</TE>
<TE>   Diesel engines are one measure that could reduce emissions of
greenhouse gases, Ford said. Recent diesel technology can reduce
emissions and increase mileage over conventional engines by 20%-30%.</TE>
<TE>   "Clean diesel is something that in this country hasn't been well
received," Ford said. "People think of the belching buses of the '70s
and '80s, but diesels have come a long way; I would like diesels to
be part of the solution here."</TE>

<HD>Examiner to Review Global's Records</HD>

<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Global Crossing Ltd.'s financial records, already under scrutiny by
federal investigators, also will be reviewed by a court-appointed
outside examiner.</LD>
<LD>   The telecommunications firm, which filed for bankruptcy protection
Jan. 28, agreed to the move Wednesday during a hearing in Bankruptcy
Court in New York. The examiner, to be selected by the U.S. trustee,
will review Global Crossing's 2001 and 2002 books and report back to
the court.</LD>
<LD>   In approving the examiner, Judge Robert Gerber rejected a request
from two shareholders who wanted the court to take the more drastic
step of replacing the company's current executives with an
independent trustee.</LD>
<TE>   Global Crossing's accounting methods have been under suspicion
since February, when a former employee's allegations of faulty
bookkeeping triggered investigations by the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are reviewing the way Global Crossing accounted for
sales of network capacity to other telecommunications firms and are
examining the timing of certain executive stock sales. Global
Crossing operates a worldwide communications network.</TE>
<TE>   Former employees have accused the company of misleading investors
by engaging in sham deals with other firms--including Qwest
Communications International Inc.--to boost key financial figures for
both companies.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials say they are cooperating with investigators.
Global Crossing replaced longtime auditor Arthur Andersen earlier
this year, but because of the probes, the company has not filed
audited results for 2001 or 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "With all these ongoing investigations, it's natural that we would
want to appoint an independent examiner," said a company spokeswoman,
who did not want to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   The move came as Global Crossing completes negotiations with
investors to buy all or part of the company. Global Crossing on
Wednesday postponed--for the sixth time--the final bidding phase,
moving the formal auction from today to Aug. 14.</TE>
<TE>   Sources say the company's leading offers would produce a
significantly diminished payback for Global Crossing's bankers,
bondholders and creditors, a group that in May rejected an
"inadequate" bid of $750 million from Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. and
Singapore Technologies Telemedia.</TE>
<TE>   The two Asian firms now are said to be the leading candidates to
buy the company, but at a much lower price. Although one source
called the situation "very fluid," one version of the Hutchison-STT
bid gives them 62% ownership in a restructured Global Crossing in
return for $250 million to $300 million in cash and $200 million in
notes.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing's bankers would get most of the cash, $175 million
of the notes and a 6% stake in the revamped firm. Bondholders would
get $25 million in notes and end up owning 32% of the company,
according to one account. Existing shareholders would be wiped out.</TE>

<HD>Pizza Coming With Delivery Fees on Top</HD>
<DH>Reluctant to raise prices in a tough market, some add extra
charge instead</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Free pizza delivery, long taken for granted by many Americans, is
rapidly becoming a thing of the past.</LD>
<LD>   To offset slowing revenue growth and soaring labor, utility and
other operating costs, Pizza Hut, Papa John's International Inc. and
even Domino's Pizza Inc., the pioneer of free delivery, are
increasingly tacking on delivery fees of up to $1.50 in selected
markets, including Los Angeles, San Diego and Orange counties. Some
experts think that it will soon be standard practice nationwide.</LD>
<LD>   The companies say consumer opposition has been limited. But
drivers complain they receive only a portion of the so-called
delivery fees and that their tips have plummeted since their
introduction. They argue that it would be far more honest to simply
raise prices across the board so customers wouldn't mistakenly
believe drivers are profiting from new charges.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm really upset about this," said Rick, 23, a part-time driver
for Domino's in West Los Angeles who asked that his last name not be
used. He said his gratuities have fallen by 25% in recent months. "I
don't know if I'd work for them ever again."</TE>
<TE>   With the pizza business among the most cutthroat in the entire
restaurant industry, chains "can't raise prices. They're stuck," said
Christopher Muller, a professor of restaurant management at the
University of Central Florida in Orlando. That's why they are
resorting to "hidden price increases," he said, which are more
palatable to consumers and can allow the chains to continue offering
such promotions as $9.99 for a large pizza.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, pizza sales grew at a paltry 2.5% to $24.9 billion,
registering slower growth than even the sagging burger business.
Between 1996 and 2001, pizza revenue increased by an average of just
3.4% per year, compared with 4.7% for the entire fast-food sector,
said Dennis Lombardi of Technomic Inc., a restaurant research and
consulting firm in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   None of the major pizza chains has as yet rolled out delivery fees
at all restaurants. However, plagued by margin-killing price wars and
slow growth, they are expected to do so within two to three years,
said Jeremy White, executive editor of Pizza Today, a trade
publication.</TE>
<TE>   "Pizza operators have to make their money somewhere," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Beverly Hills restaurant consultant Larry Sarokin said the
chains risk alienating some customers.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're used to getting something for free for 25 years and
suddenly you have to pay for it, you might not be too happy," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Pizza Hut, the nation's biggest pizza company with 8,000 units in
the U.S., was the first of the three major pizza chains to charge
delivery fees at many outlets. After testing the concept for a year
and a half, the Dallas-based subsidiary of  Yum Brands Inc. last
summer started requiring customers to pay an average of 50 cents to
75 cents at almost all company-owned stores. About 30% of Pizza Hut's
domestic restaurants are owned by the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers consider the fees "no big deal and worth it for the
convenience," Pizza Hut spokeswoman Patty Sullivan said.</TE>
<TE>   Papa John's, based in Louisville, Ky., also is experimenting with
delivery fees. About 15% to 20% of franchise operators now charge
them, up from 7% last year.</TE>
<TE>   After much "soul-searching," Ann Arbor, Mich.-based Domino's broke
with its past and began charging fees at 100 company stores in
November and has since expanded the practice to 200 more outlets,
spokesman Tim McIntyre said. Forty San Diego franchised stores also
charge fees. The 7,096-unit chain expects to make a final decision on
the charges by year's end.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when pizza chains are embracing delivery charges,
several Internet retailers are trying to drum up business by
eliminating or reducing shipping fees, said Priya Raghubir, a
professor of marketing at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley.
Best Buy Co., for instance, has just begun offering free ground
shipping on all orders.</TE>
<TE>   The pizza giants say delivery charges have generated little public
outcry.</TE>
<TE>   However, Domino's driver Mike said more than 30 customers have
complained since the Los Angeles Domino's operator for whom he works
slapped on fees two months ago. And frustrated consumers appear to be
taking their anger out on him, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the last eight weeks, Mike, 32, a six-year Domino's driver who
asked that his last name not be used, said his gratuities have
plunged by about 50%. About a dozen customers have stiffed him
because of their opposition to the fees, he said. Others have tipped
him less because they mistakenly believe he pockets the entire
charge.</TE>
<TE>   Although Domino's and other pizza chains pay drivers a small
fee for deliveries, Mike said the 60 cents he earns for each trip falls
far short of covering his out-of-pocket expenses for gas, car
insurance and maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   Mike now routinely puts in six-day weeks and volunteers to fill in
for sick colleagues to generate extra cash. Racked with financial
worries, he no longer sleeps through the night.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not making enough money," Mike said. "I can't get out of this
hole."</TE>

<HD>Schwab Launches 'Hedged' Stock Fund</HD>
<DH>Investing: Biggest online brokerage's product will partly
bet against the market, reflecting Wall Street's sober new attitude
toward equities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charles Schwab Corp. on Wednesday opened a stock mutual fund that
will partly bet against the market, offering mainstream investors
some of the trading techniques employed by wildly popular hedge
funds.</LD>
<LD>   Schwab's move reflects both the sober new attitude toward stocks
on Wall Street and the search by the world's biggest online brokerage
for new business amid a continuing trading slump that has crushed its
earnings.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco-based company said its Schwab Hedged Equity Fund
would go "long" and "short," allowing it to play both sides of the
market.</LD>
<TE>   In a short sale, an investor borrows shares and sells them,
betting on a falling price. If the bet is correct, the investor can
buy back the shares later for less, repay the loan and pocket the
price difference.</TE>
<TE>   There are numerous other mutual funds available that use shorting
techniques, and wealthy investors have been able to buy into hedge
funds that typically go both long and short with stocks and other
investments.</TE>
<TE>   But Schwab's decision is significant because of the firm's huge
mainstream customer base.</TE>
<TE>   In a nod to the growing appeal of hedge funds, Schwab is marketing
its new fund as a cheaper, more accessible and better-regulated
alternative.</TE>
<TE>   Hedge funds, once the exclusive domain of the ultra-wealthy, often
require minimum initial investments of $1 million or more, and they
typically charge performance fees of 20% a year if their benchmarks
are beaten.</TE>
<TE>   The new Schwab fund, by contrast, requires an initial minimum
investment of $25,000 (subsequent investments must be at least
$5,000), and will carry an annual expense ratio of 2%, at least for
the first year, the firm said.</TE>
<TE>   Hedge fund industry assets have ballooned to an estimated $600
billion as well-heeled investors have sought a way to profit, or at
least stay above water, during the long bear market that has
devastated share values.</TE>
<TE>   In the first half of this year, the average hedge fund's
performance was flat, while the average U.S. stock fund lost 10%,
according to Van Hedge Fund Advisors International in Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Begley, executive vice president at Van Hedge Fund Advisors,
said that "mutual funds have had three years of underperformance,"
while many hedge funds have preserved investors' capital or posted
gains, helped by their ability to profit from falling share prices.</TE>
<TE>   "This has not been lost on the brokerages," Begley said.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts say there is a risk that the small investor is being
allowed into the hedge-fund boom--directly or indirectly--at what
might prove to be the peak of the funds' popularity.</TE>
<TE>   Although the idea of being able to profit in any kind of stock
market holds broad appeal these days, the task may be trickier than
it appears, analysts warn. Shorting can be an extremely risky
strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Some so-called market neutral funds that go long and short, such
as AXA Rosenberg Value Market Neutral and Phoenix-Euclid Market
Neutral, have posted big gains this year, according to a new report
from Standard &amp; Poor's. But other mutual funds that employ shorting
strategies have generated mixed results.</TE>
<TE>   Schwab is touting its fund as a way for it to apply its new
stock-rating system, which uses mathematical formulas to grade about
3,000 stocks.</TE>
<TE>   "This fund allows us to take advantage of those stocks Schwab
rates as 'under-perform,' " said Geri Hom, lead manager of the new
fund.</TE>
<TE>   The Hedged Equity Fund will not be market-neutral like several
long/short funds already on the market, nor will it be "fully hedged"
like the nearly 400 traditional hedge funds, said Schwab spokesman
Lance Berg.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it will hold mainly long positions, with 20% to 25% of
assets in shorted stocks. Most long positions will be in stocks rated
A or B by Schwab's formula, while short stakes mainly will be in
stocks rated D or F, Hom said.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Constant, an analyst at Lehman Bros., said he expects
brokerages to continue blurring the lines between hedge funds and
mutual funds.</TE>
<TE>   "Hedge funds are quite trendy right now. Schwab is not the first
to offer something like this, nor will it be the last," Constant
said. "It's funny how nobody at the market peak seemed to care about
capital preservation. At the trough, apparently they do."</TE>

<HD>Waksal Indicted on More Charges</HD>
<DH>Courts: The grand jury action, which the former CEO of
ImClone had sought to avoid, allows the case to go to trial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal grand jury in New York on Wednesday indicted the
high-rolling founder and former chief executive of ImClone Systems
Inc., Samuel D. Waksal, on charges of bank fraud and obstruction of
justice, the latest in a series of crackdowns on alleged corporate
wrongdoers.</LD>
<LD>   The 13-count indictment expands the case against Waksal, who in
June was charged with perjury and securities fraud, and brings more
unwanted attention to Waksal's friend Martha Stewart, who also has
been caught up in the scandal.</LD>
<LD>   The additional charges also stiffen Waksal's potential penalty; if
convicted on the bank fraud charge alone, Waksal would face up to 30
years in prison.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors had sought to negotiate a plea deal with Waksal before
a Friday deadline to indict him. A deal probably would have required
him to reveal, in exchange for leniency, whether he provided insider
tips to family and friends, including Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a painful chapter in Dr. Waksal's life," Mark Pomerantz,
an attorney for Waksal, said in a statement. "Like all Americans, he
is presumed to be innocent, and he will respond to these charges as
required."</TE>
<TE>   Waksal's troubles began late last year, when the Food and Drug
Administration declined to approve Erbitux, which the company had
touted as a breakthrough cancer-fighting drug. Prosecutors allege
that Waksal learned of the pending decision and warned family and
friends--including Stewart--to sell off ImClone shares before the
market pummeled the company's stock. Stewart denies getting inside
information.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's indictment adds allegations of wrongdoing that go back
years before the Erbitux debacle. The bank fraud count alleges that
Waksal defrauded Bank of America from April 1999 to January, using
forged documents to obtain $44 million in loans on ImClone stock he
no longer owned.</TE>
<TE>   The new charges also allege that Waksal took elaborate steps to
cover up his misdeeds, including plotting with family members to lie
to investigators about their reasons for the Dec. 27 stock sale.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also accuse Waksal of ordering the destruction of
ImClone computer files, phone messages and records of his offshore
accounts at banks in Switzerland and the Netherlands. They say the
files and records could have revealed the identities of his insider
trading partners and where he may have hidden illicit gains.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say Waksal's daughter, Aliza, made $2.5 million on her
Dec. 27 sale of ImClone stock. Waksal, a flamboyant staple of the
East Coast party circuit and celebrity gossip columns, allegedly had
tried to sell his shares but was thwarted by brokerage firms that
refused to process the orders.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators also are investigating Stewart, founder and CEO of
Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc., after learning that she
disposed of nearly 4,000 ImClone shares, also on Dec. 27, grossing
about $230,000.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart and Aliza Waksal employ the same Merrill Lynch broker,
Peter Bacanovic. Congressional investigators probing the ImClone
insider scandal are exploring whether Bacanovic could have tipped
Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart has said she had a standing order to sell her ImClone
stock if it fell below $60. Bacanovic's assistant, Douglas Faneuil,
originally said there was such an order but has since changed his
account.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is
investigating the ImClone trading scandal, said it requested
additional documents from Stewart--including e-mails and records from
her business manager.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Stewart's lawyer, the committee chairman, Rep. W.J.
"Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), and Rep. James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), chairman
of the subcommittee on oversight and investigations, requested an
interview with Stewart to clear up discrepancies between her account
of the sale and that of her broker and his assistant.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia slumped Wednesday after
reports that Congress is widening its probe into Martha Stewart's
sale of ImClone stock in December.</TE>
<TE>   The company's shares fell 8.2%, or 67 cents, to close at $7.50 on
the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has taken a beating since news
broke in early June that Stewart's name was linked to the ImClone
insider trading scandal.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal reported this week
that Faneuil told investigators that Bacanovic ordered him to call
Stewart to advise her to sell her shares because Waksal and members
of his family were dumping theirs.</TE>

<HD>DreamWorks to Develop TV Shows for NBC</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: The deal is part of a growing trend in which
networks are collaborating with outside studios.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NBC on Wednesday announced a two-year deal with DreamWorks
Television, with the network agreeing to finance new projects and
getting dibs on any shows developed by the studio.</LD>
<LD>   DreamWorks and NBC already were collaborating on one new show,
"Boomtown," about cops in Los Angeles that will air this fall on the
top-rated network.</LD>
<LD>   The deal comes at a time when NBC is under pressure to produce a
new crop of hits. Its No. 1-rated show, "Friends," probably is
entering its final season, and the network needs to prepare potential
replacements for other aging hits.</LD>
<TE>   NBC, which is owned by General Electric Co., also will have
majority ownership in the DreamWorks shows it broadcasts.</TE>
<TE>   If NBC passes on a DreamWorks show, the studio can shop it to
other networks.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, Walt Disney Co.'s ABC network announced that it
had signed a similar two-year deal with HBO Independent Productions,
a unit of AOL Time Warner Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Both deals point to a growing trend in which TV networks have been
scrambling to diversify their pool of suppliers instead of relying
largely on in-house studios for most of the prime-time programs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all part of the new way of doing business," NBC
Entertainment President Jeff Zucker said. "It's an attempt to have
different eyes look out for new projects and take bets with people
whom we believe will produce."</TE>
<TE>   The agreements also give networks an advantage over competitors by
locking up shows with the greatest chance of success and forcing
rival networks to pick over the leftovers. For the studios, such as
DreamWorks, the deals provide a source of revenue in an era of
limited resources.</TE>
<TE>   DreamWorks Television's most recent network partnership with ABC
expired in June. Under that agreement, DreamWorks produced "Spin
City," which ended its six-year run last season.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to producing "Boomtown" with NBC, DreamWorks is
co-producing with 20th Century Fox Television a nostalgic story about
an 11-year-old boy called "Oliver Beene," which is scheduled to air
on Fox in January.</TE>
<TE>   The NBC deal gives DreamWorks, which is not part of a huge media
conglomerate with an affiliated TV network, an edge in getting shows
on a network schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes sense--financially--for us to have a partner," said
Justin Falvey, co-head of DreamWorks Television. "The stars aligned
and it makes the most sense for us to be with NBC."</TE>
<TE>   Neither NBC nor DreamWorks would discuss the deal's financial
terms. Zucker also declined to say how much money the network would
dedicate to DreamWorks' productions.</TE>
<TE>   NBC signed a similar exclusive production deal in May with
producer Gavin Polone, who created the WB network's "Gilmore Girls,"
as well as HBO's "Curb Your Enthusiasm" and the Jodie Foster film
"Panic Room."</TE>
<TE>   Brad Grey Television, which produced "Just Shoot Me" for NBC, in
May teamed up with 20th Century Fox Television.</TE>
<TE>   Zucker said NBC was happy to be in a partnership with DreamWorks,
but the network has modest expectations. "Look, if we get one success
together in the two years, then this deal will have been well worth
it," he said.</TE>

<HD>Aon May Have to Restate Earnings</HD>
<DH>Insurance: The broker says the SEC questioned its
accounting practices. Shares fall 30%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aon Corp. said Wednesday that it may have to restate several years'
earnings after regulators questioned its accounting practices. The
world's No. 2 insurance broker also put its underwriting unit up for
sale, dropping plans to spin it off.</LD>
<LD>   Aon shares fell as much as 34% to a seven-year low of $13.95 on
the New York Stock Exchange as investors recoiled from another firm
with potentially unreliable accounts. The stock, which has fallen
more than 55% this year, recovered slightly to finish at $14.77, down
$6.43, or 30%.</LD>
<LD>   The Chicago-based company also said earnings would be lower than
forecast as it struggles to keep down costs.</LD>
<TE>   The move by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
resulting stock slide hurt overall confidence in the company's
management, with no sign of abating.</TE>
<TE>   "The outstanding SEC accounting issues, even if they prove benign,
will likely hang over the stock," Salomon Smith Barney analyst Ron
Frank said.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC questioned several items in Aon's accounts, including the
reporting of investment write-downs, the timing of some costs and a
reinsurance recoverable item and the decision not to consolidate
certain special purpose vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Aon said it may have to restate earnings for the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   "If [the SEC] thinks additional disclosure is appropriate, we're
going to do it," Aon Chief Executive Patrick Ryan told analysts
during a two-hour conference call.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC's questioning of Aon's accounts suggests that the firm was
aggressive with its profit reports. To remedy the situation, the SEC
demanded that the firm release more information in its financial
reports and stop using EBITDA (or earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization) numbers, which are potentially
misleading.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Aon said it was looking to sell its underwriting unit,
Combined Specialty Group, which it had planned to spin off. The
company said poor stock market conditions forced its hand.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's news caps several years of problems for Aon, which has
been struggling to consolidate its operations and cut costs after a
string of acquisitions in the 1990s. The firm grew rapidly over the
decade, becoming the only serious rival to Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos., the
world's leading broker.</TE>
<TE>   The news came as Aon reported it broke even for the second
quarter, contrasted with a profit of 11 cents a share a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Results were hurt by a $36-million charge for losses from an
underwriting agency Aon has sued, accusing it of fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding such one-time items, Aon reported operating earnings of
13 cents a share, compared with 44 cents a year earlier.</TE>

<LD>RCN Corp. said its second-quarter loss widened as the provider of

<LD>   The net loss widened to $1.05 billion, or $10.46 a share, from
$676.9 million, or $7.38, a year earlier. Per-share amounts reflect
the payment of preferred dividends. Sales rose 15% to $128 million
from $111 million. RCN shares fell 14 cents to $1.25 in Nasdaq
trading. The stock has fallen 72% in the last year.</LD>

<LD>New theaters and a space documentary were credited with Imax Corp.'s
second-quarter profit, but the company said the star in its upcoming

<LD>   The company, which has gone through extensive restructuring in the
last year, hopes its digital re-mastering, or DMR, technology, will
usher new audiences into Imax theaters.</LD>
<LD>   In its second quarter ended June 30, Imax posted net earnings of 9
cents a share, reversing a net loss of 37 cents a share in the
year-earlier period. Imax shares gained 26 cents, or more than 10%,
to $3.86 on Nasdaq.</LD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shareholders filed a securities fraud suit against AOL Time Warner
Inc., alleging the world's largest media company artificially
inflated online advertising revenue.</LD>
<LD>   Kenneth McClure, who held 10,680 shares of AOL Time Warner, is the
lead shareholder in a suit seeking an unspecified amount in damages
for the alleged securities fraud and the subsequent fall of AOL Time
Warner shares. Shares fell about 70% this year amid concerns about
growth prospects and disappointment over unfulfilled promises made
when AOL completed its $106.2-billion purchase of Time Warner in
2001.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of AOL Time Warner were up 90 cents to $10.80 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner, which has been reshuffling its top ranks in an
attempt to regain focus and credibility, said it has not seen the
lawsuit filed in Texarkana, Texas, but maintained that it properly
accounted for advertising revenue.</TE>

<LD>The U.S. government is widening its probe of the dealings of the
Rigas family, founders of troubled cable operator Adelphia
Communications Corp., to include possible tax violations, sources
said.</LD>
<LD>   The Internal Revenue Service is assisting the Justice Department
in its investigation of three members of the Rigas family, who were
arrested last month on securities fraud charges of looting the
company and using the company's coffers as their "personal piggy
bank," one source said.</LD>
<LD>   Spokesmen at both the Justice Department and the IRS declined to
comment. Attorneys for the Rigas family were not immediately
available for comment.</LD>
<TE>   John Rigas, Adelphia's chief executive who founded the company
with a $300 check in 1952, was arrested last month along with his two
sons, Timothy Rigas, chief financial officer, and Michael Rigas,
executive vice president of operations.</TE>

<HD>Gold Price Surges in Bet on New Rally</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is gold setting up for another rally?</LD>
<LD>   Near-term gold futures Wednesday had their biggest gain in six
months, in part on expectations that major mining companies will
accelerate the close-out of price hedges they previously put in
place.</LD>
<LD>   In New York, August gold futures jumped $8.80 to $314.30 an ounce.
It was the biggest one-day gain since Feb. 5.</LD>
<TE>   Gold reached a 2 1/2-year high of $327.80 on June 4, up from $279
on Jan. 1, as the metal attracted investors disheartened by the stock
market's troubles. But since the June peak, the price has pulled
back, reaching a recent low of $302.40 on July 29.</TE>
<TE>   Gold bulls say mining firms are stepping up repurchases of hedging
contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Mining companies often try to protect themselves against falling
prices by selling gold borrowed from banks, expecting to repay the
loans with less-valuable supplies later. They also can hedge by
entering into sales agreements for gold that has yet to be mined.</TE>
<TE>   Denver-based Newmont Mining, the world's largest gold producer,
said Wednesday that it reduced the amount of gold it had sold at
preset prices by 724,000 ounces in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Newmont will cut the size of its so-called hedge book, which was
6.6 million ounces on June 30, by an additional 1 million ounces in
the second half of this year and by 1.8 million ounces next year,
Chief Financial Officer Bruce Hansen told analysts.</TE>
<TE>   "These producers think gold is going to $350 or $375," said George
Dlugosh, vice president of precious-metals trading at RBC Capital
Markets in Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Newmont shares rose 65 cents to $25.60 on Wednesday. Other miners
also gained. Goldcorp rose 35 cents to $9.05, Placer Dome added 21
cents to $8.60, and Ashanti Gold jumped 43 cents to $5.13. But most
of the stocks remain far below their spring peaks.</TE>

<LD>   These sections will be rolled out at all its stores within a year,
said company Chairman Dave Gold.</LD>
<TE>   Outfitted with wood rather than metal shelving, and a separate
neon sign, these sections will peddle overstocked and discontinued
items such as cans of crab, shiitake mushrooms and imported
chocolate. Even imported Cabernet Sauvignon will be available at
selected stores.</TE>
<TE>   The idea for a gourmet section sprung from the chain's brisk
premium wines sales at a few stores in the Los Angeles area,
something it has not been able to roll out across the chain because
of the difficulty of getting liquor licenses.</TE>
<TE>   Although discount stores such as 99 Cents Only might not seem like
a draw for affluent consumers, AC Nielsen research shows that 41% of
all households with incomes above $70,000 shopped at a dollar store
last year.</TE>
<TE>   With 99 Cents' move, dollar stores may be willing to cater to
these big-spending customers, who analysts say see dollar stores as a
sort of economic sport.</TE>
<TE>   99 Cents Only's top-grossing storeis on Wilshire Boulevard near
Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   "It's amazing how broad their reach and appeal is," said Bob
Buchanan, director of A.G. Edwards Inc.'s retail research group.</TE>
<TE>   "You look at their parking lots, and there are inexpensive cars,
but also BMWs and Mercedes," Buchanan said.</TE>
<TE>   Although gourmet fancy food might seem redundant, Gold said he
feared that some customers might be unsure about what "gourmet"
means, so he tacked on fancy as well.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of 99 Cents Only Stores fell 38 cents to $22.07 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Extend Rally for 2nd Day on Cisco Gains</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: The Dow closes up 182 points. Treasury yields
drop to new lows in anticipation of a Fed rate cut.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A late-session rally pushed stocks higher Wednesday, lifting the
market for a second day as investors piled into beaten-down issues in
hopes technology bellwether Cisco Systems' higher quarterly earnings
boded well for corporate profits.</LD>
<LD>   Stocks had swayed between gains and losses throughout the session,
but investors put their pessimism aside in the final hour of trading.
A report showing consumer credit expanded in June also helped,
traders said.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 182.06 points, or 2.2%,
at 8,456.15. The average jumped at the open, then slid in and out of
negative territory throughout the day. The blue-chip measure rose
2.9% Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index gained 17.20 points, or
2%, to 876.77, while the technology-laced Nasdaq composite index was
up 21.35 points, or 1.7%, to 1,280.90. Nasdaq leapt more than 3% at
the open after gaining more than 4% on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Advancing stocks led decliners by about 2 to 1 on the New York
Stock Exchange and 9 to 8 on Nasdaq in moderate trading.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco, Nasdaq's most actively traded issue, gained 92 cents, or
7.6%, at $12.99 after the No. 1 maker of gear that directs Internet
traffic posted profit that topped consensus estimates. Cisco also
almost tripled its stock buyback program to $8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   But the firm said customers remain cautious about spending and
posted revenue that fell short of analysts' forecasts. "It wasn't
that Cisco's numbers were great, they just weren't horrible," said
Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Kirlin Securities. "Given the
environment, Cisco did well."</TE>
<TE>   In other news, wholesalers in June boosted inventories at the
fastest rate in 19 months, a hopeful sign for U.S. economic recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks had gained Tuesday on hopes the Federal Reserve may cut
interest rates sometime this year to shore up the economy. The Fed is
scheduled to meet next week. One trader said such hopes could have
fed the late-session gains.</TE>
<TE>   "You have the Fed next week and there is a lot of speculation
about a further easing of rates for the rest of the year," said the
stock index futures trader. "But volume is light and the [upward]
break was done on very thin volume."</TE>
<TE>   Treasury yields ended mostly lower after rebounding Tuesday. The
six-month Treasury bill yield fell to a record low of 1.54% from
1.61% Tuesday, and the two-year T-note dropped to 1.98% from 2.04%,
reflecting the growing expectation of a Fed rate cut.</TE>
<TE>   But the government's auction of $18 billion in new 10-year notes
attracted relatively few bids. Total bids were $23.2 billion, a low
amount for the size of the auction. The average yield was 4.39%.</TE>
<TE>   In other trading, oil prices fell 67 cents to $26.50 a barrel
after the American Petroleum Institute reported the biggest weekly
drop in U.S. refining since early March, signaling weak demand. Gold
futures had their biggest gain in six months, while the dollar
weakened against the yen and euro.</TE>
<TE>   Among Wednesday's other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Retailers of clothing and other discretionary items fell on
concerns that consumers may cut back spending. Limited Brands
declined 86 cents to $14.74 and Dillard's slipped 50 cents to $22.40.
Discount chains and purveyors of staples such as food rose. Wal-Mart
Stores gained $1.10 to $48.38. Costco Wholesale rose $1.31 to $34.53.</TE>
<TE>   * Telephone companies had the biggest declines in the S&amp;P 500
after Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers said, "We remain concerned
about service-provider business on a global basis." Verizon, the
biggest local-phone service company, fell 40 cents to $29.47. Dow
member SBC Communications fell 37 cents to $25.72. BellSouth lost 54
cents to $23.97.</TE>
<TE>   * Dow member Boeing added $1.69 to $41.10. Ryanair Holdings said
shareholders approved plans to buy 100 Boeing 737-800 planes over the
next seven years and take options on 50 more.</TE>
<TE>   * TMP Worldwide, owner of the Monster.com job-search Web site,
tumbled $4.15, or 33%, to $8.63 the day after it said it will cut
more jobs and lowered its profit forecast after revenue tumbled for a
fourth straight quarter.</TE>

<HD>Univision Trims 2002 Earnings Estimates</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spanish-language broadcasting giant Univision Communications Inc. on
Wednesday lowered its earnings estimates for the rest of this year,
saying TV advertising sales have been slower than expected and that
start-up costs for its young TeleFutura broadcast network have been
higher than anticipated.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles-based company revised its outlook during a
conference call with analysts to announce its second-quarter
earnings. The company posted a 22% decline in its second-quarter net
income to $22.2 million, or 9 cents a share, from a profit of $28.6
million, or 12 cents a share, in the same period last year.</LD>
<LD>   Revenue in the latest quarter increased 36% to $322.8 million from
$237.5 million in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   However, Univision's quarterly operating expenses increased 84% to
$157.8 million as the company spent more on programming and to
promote TeleFutura, its second broadcast network that was launched in
January.</TE>
<TE>   Univision also lost money on the World Cup soccer tournament,
which was played in South Korea and Japan. The difference in time
zones meant that most matches aired in the U.S. in the early morning
hours with limited viewership.</TE>
<TE>   During the second quarter, Univision recorded revenue from the
World Cup of $63 million and expenses of $55 million, said Chief
Financial Officer Andrew Hobson. He estimated that Univision "lost
approximately $10 million to $15 million on an operating basis" on
the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Univision also trimmed its revenue forecasts for the year to
between $1.10 billion and $1.14 billion. Three months ago, it
predicted 2002 revenue of between $1.13 billion and $1.18 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy is not rebounding, so Univision pulled in its horns
for the rest of the year," said David Joyce, media analyst for the
Miami-based investment banking firm Guzman &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Univision fell $1.40, or 6.4%, to $20.50 in after-hours
trading. They fell $2.01 to $21.90 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The stock has fallen 46% this year.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Considers Selling Profitable Video-Game Unit</HD>
<DH>Media: Analysts says cash-strapped company could raise more
than $1 billion given the current strength of the growing market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Media giant Vivendi Universal is pondering a sale of its profitable
video-games business.</LD>
<LD>   Strapped for cash and burdened with $19 billion in debt, Vivendi
Universal has been hashing out various scenarios for raising funds in
recent weeks, including the sale of the games business, according to
sources familiar with the discussions.</LD>
<LD>   The French company's new chairman, Jean-Rene Fourtou, also is
weighing the sale of its Houghton Mifflin book publishing unit, which
it purchased last year for $2.2 billion.</LD>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the games unit declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say the business, which has about $600 million in annual
revenue, could fetch more than $1 billion given the current strength
of the video-game market, which is expected to grow by more than 20%
worldwide this year.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's game unit consists of Blizzard Entertainment in Irvine;
Sierra Entertainment in Bellevue, Wash.; Universal Interactive in
Universal City; NDA Productions in Europe; and a publishing and
distribution unit.</TE>
<TE>   The unit publishes games based on its popular Warcraft, Spyro and
Crash Bandicoot franchises. Its latest release of "Warcraft III"
generated about $64 million in retail sales during its first seven
days.</TE>
<TE>   "The timing would be good for a sale, especially combined with
Vivendi's clear need for cash," said Shawn Milne, an analyst with
SoundView Technology Group in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   The difficulty, however, is in finding a buyer. Only two
independent publishers--Redwood City, Calif.-based Electronic Arts
Inc. and Activision Inc. of Santa Monica--have more than $500 million
in cash. But buying Vivendi's game unit would be uncharacteristic of
these companies, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Sega Corp., which told investors in May that it was looking for
acquisitions, has just $400 million in cash and $1 billion in debt.</TE>
<TE>   Only Microsoft Corp., with more than $30 billion in cash, would
have the funds to purchase the unit.</TE>
<TE>   EA, Activision, Sega and Microsoft officials declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi shares gained 33 cents, or 2%, to $15.15 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Consumer Debt Rises at Slower Pace in June</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. consumer debt rose in June at a slower pace than a month earlier
as consumer confidence fell amid a slump in stock prices.</LD>
<LD>   Credit card debt, auto loans and other personal borrowing rose at
a 5.9% annual rate, or $8.4 billion, in June, the Federal Reserve
said. That followed a 6.7%, or $9.5-billion increase in May that was
the largest since November.</LD>
<LD>   The slowdown in consumer borrowing coincided with a drop in the
Conference Board's index of consumer confidence in June and a 7%
slide in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index. General Motors Corp.
and other auto makers reintroduced zero-interest car loans in July,
suggesting the slowing in consumer borrowing may be short-lived.</LD>
<TE>   Economists expected consumer credit to rise by $8 billion in June.
Total consumer debt rose in June to $1.71 trillion from $1.7 trillion
in May.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sales at U.S. wholesalers rose twice as fast as inventories in June,
led by increased purchases of automobiles, computers and groceries,
government figures showed.</LD>
<LD>   Sales rose 0.6% during the month after no change in May, the
Commerce Department said. Inventories increased 0.3%, the first rise
since May 2001, after no change in the previous month. A measure of
the length of time stockpiles will last at the current sales pace
held at a record low.</LD>
<LD>   The economy expanded in the second quarter at a fifth of the
first-quarter pace, giving companies intent on controlling costs
little reason to add much to inventories. Retailers probably will
report today that their sales last month were the second-weakest this
year.</LD>
<TE>   A separate report from the Labor Department showed import prices
excluding petroleum were unchanged in July and 1.5% lower than they
were in the same month last year. Including petroleum, import prices
rose 0.4% and were 1.7% lower than July 2001.</TE>

Edwards Air Force Base.</LD>
<LD>   The Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which is
developing the unmanned combat air vehicle along with the Air Force,
said the contract would lead to design, development and construction
of two bigger X-45B aircraft by 2005.</LD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's largest auto maker, reported a powerful
jump in profit for its first quarter, helped by a robust performance
in the U.S. and a soft yen.</LD>
<LD>   Reporting quarterly earnings for the first time, the auto giant
said consolidated operating profit for April-June climbed 35.4% from
a year earlier to $3.26 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The result was well ahead of analysts' estimates, although a lack
of historical data had made forecasting difficult.</LD>
<TE>   Pushing up Toyota's profit were strong U.S. sales of vehicles such
as the Camry and the Highlander sport utility vehicle as well as a
weaker yen in the period, which inflates the value of income earned
abroad and makes exports more profitable.</TE>

<LD>Most Americans doubt new laws to reform corporate America will clean
up the kind of corruption and fraud that has dominated newspaper
headlines this year, according to a survey.</LD>
<LD>   A Columbia Law School poll of 1,000 people found 52% of Americans
think that the Sarbanes-Oxley bill, which stiffens criminal penalties
for corrupt executives and calls for an independent accounting
oversight board, won't stem the wave of corporate scandals. The
survey overall showed an increasing public distrust of the government

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nokia, the world's largest cell phone maker, plans to cut 900 jobs in
its networks division because of a continuing slump in demand for
wireless network equipment.</LD>
<LD>   The Finnish firm, which employs 19,000 in its network operations,
said most of the cuts would be made by the end of the year in batches
of "a few employees in most countries to around 100 in some larger"
ones.</LD>
<LD>   The job cuts involve mostly network delivery and maintenance
services.</LD>
<TE>   Last month, Nokia reported a 46% increase in second-quarter net
profit, mainly because of strong profitability in its key mobile
phone unit. But sales of network equipment dropped 22%, and the
company warned of tougher times ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Nokia shares fell 3 cents to $11.25 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sony Corp., the world's second-largest consumer electronics maker,
has developed software incorporating new technology to enhance the
copyright protection of music and movies available through the
Internet.</LD>
<LD>   The software, using a technology called OpenMG X, gives
distributors more control over how their digital content is used,
Sony said. For instance, it will allow content providers to limit the
number of times a song can be copied and played.</LD>
<LD>   Movies, music and games are readily available for swapping over
the Internet, sparking concern among record companies and movie
studios. Sony has blamed digital piracy for eroding profit at its
music business.</LD>
<TE>   The creator of the Walkman personal stereo plans to release
several models of its Vaio PCs this year that will act as home
servers capable of storing and playing movies and music in digital
form.</TE>
<TE>   Sony shares rose $1.35 to $43.85 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Citigroup to Require Reporting of Financing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citigroup Inc. Chairman Sanford Weill, under pressure from lawmakers
to reveal more about the company's business dealings, said Wednesday
that the firm will require corporate clients to make
off-balance-sheet partnerships public. The financial services giant
also said it will begin accounting for its stock options as an
expense.</LD>
<LD>   Corporate customers that decline to formally record a major
Citigroup financing as debt on their balance sheets will have to
agree to publicly disclose the amount of the financing, the effect it
may have on the company and any provision that may accelerate
repayment, Weill said in a memo to employees.</LD>
<LD>   "Sandy's back is up against the wall," said David Hendler, a
fixed-income analyst with independent research firm CreditSights Inc.
"These are steps in the right direction."</LD>
<TE>   Citigroup and its biggest U.S. rival, J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.,
face congressional probes and more than $36 billion in legal claims
related to their business with Enron Corp. before the energy trader
collapsed in December.</TE>
<TE>   At hearings last month, the banks' executives disputed allegations
that they helped Enron disguise debt with off-balance-sheet
partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   But congressional investigators said internal e-mails showed that
Citigroup knew Enron was masking a loan structured as a so-called
prepay transaction often used in financing commodities trades.</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Morgan said it will follow Citigroup in requiring clients to
make similar disclosures. "We haven't announced a formal policy on
this point yet, but our practice will be along the same lines," said
Joe Evangelisti, a Morgan spokesman. The bank is reviewing whether to
expense stock options, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe our new policy will encourage companies to provide
greater transparency than currently required by law and help restore
investor confidence in our financial markets," Weill said.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup also will insist that a client's chief financial
officer, independent auditors and chief attorney get a complete set
of transaction documents.</TE>
<TE>   Clients may not like Citigroup dictating what they must do, some
investors said. "Some of them might take offense," said Jim Luke, who
manages $350 million at BB&amp;T Asset Management in Raleigh, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Citigroup said that reporting options as expenses will
cost the firm 3 cents a share in 2003 and 6 cents in 2008.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup shares rose $1.12 to $31.52 on the New York Stock
Exchange, before the company's policy changes were announced.</TE>

<HD>Datek Unit Ordered to Halt Some Day Trading</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The National Assn. of Securities Dealers ordered a unit of Datek
Online Holdings Corp. to halt day trading by some customers, raising
a potential obstacle to the company's acquisition by Ameritrade
Holding Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Ameritrade and Datek must obtain NASD approval for a change in
control at Datek. Ameritrade, the nation's fifth-largest Internet
brokerage, plans to buy Datek, the seventh largest, for $1.3 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The approval may be jeopardized because the NASD has expressed
concern that a Datek unit is permitting customers to engage in an
illegal form of day trading known as "free riding," the purchase of
shares without the money to pay for them, according to a filing by
Ameritrade with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<TE>   Ameritrade and Datek say the unit, a business called IClearing
that processes securities transactions, isn't doing anything wrong,
and they will "vigorously pursue" efforts to prove their case.</TE>

<HD>Fired City Official Hits Back</HD>
<DH>Ventura: Claim by ousted cultural affairs chief is first
step in what could become a wrongful termination lawsuit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura's ousted cultural affairs manager has filed a legal claim
against the city, alleging wrongful and retaliatory termination.</LD>
<LD>   Consuelo Underwood's claim for damages covers loss of past and
future income and emotional distress, but does not specify a dollar
amount.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the right thing to do," said Underwood, who was fired in
April after only 10 months on the job. "It's an important action to
take for people to realize that there are some serious problems."</LD>
<TE>   The city plans to file a written response denying Underwood's
allegations within the next few weeks, officials said. The city has
45 days to respond.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not agree with the claim," said Linda Kegerreis, the human
resources director for the city. The city's reason for dismissing
Underwood is simple, Kegerreis said. "She did not meet the overall
performance expectations as a manger with the city."</TE>
<TE>   Underwood's claim, a required precursor before filing a lawsuit,
states that she was fired after "exposing and criticizing the city
... regarding the distribution of city funds designated for cultural
affairs and the arts."</TE>
<TE>   But Kegerreis said that was not the case. Rather, Underwood "was
terminated because of performance," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The claim also states that Underwood, who was hired in July 2001
following a nationwide search, exposed unethical conduct,
mismanagement and an official cover-up regarding distribution of art
grants. Neither she nor her attorney has elaborated on those charges.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a disservice to both parties to try this matter in
the press," said Georgianna Regnier, Underwood's lawyer. "It's
already been aired publicly and the arts community has aired their
outrage at her firing at two separate [City] Council meetings."</TE>
<TE>   One local artist said that while Underwood's firing was
unfortunate, artists are still finding open doors with the city.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not just sitting around," said Michelle Chapin, secretary
of the Ventura Artists Union. "We're professionals, we deal with
whoever goes in and out of City Hall."</TE>
<TE>   For example, Chapin said, the union is working with the city to
open a contemporary art gallery in a portion of the former Banana
Belt restaurant on California Street.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Walker, community services director for the city and
Underwood's former boss, hopes to hire a replacement by the time the
new grant distribution cycle begins next summer. He has already
interviewed two applicants and will talk to five more by early next
week, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Once the city rejects Underwood's claim, her attorney can file a
civil suit on her behalf. But Regnier says they have not yet decided
whether to do so.</TE>

<HD>Bowlers Bid Farewell to a Star</HD>
<DH>Landmark: Hundreds of Hollywood Star Lanes patrons turn out
for a final game at the local institution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE RAMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Instead of going out of business quietly, the owner of Hollywood Star
Lanes bowling alley went out with a bang and a buck.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, Star Lanes' last day after 42 years, it cost only $1
for a beer, a hot dog, some French fries. Even renting a pair of
bowling shoes. An hour of bowling, $21 an hour in the past, was only
$6.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of patrons and onlookers crowded into the place, some
waiting up to four hours for a chance to bowl one last time. Others
were there just to take in the atmosphere or to get a souvenir--a
banner or even one of the alley's decorative, neon-lighted interior
stars.</LD>
<TE>   Mostly, the crowd came to mourn Star Lanes' passing.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel horrible," said 18-year-old Lindsey Newhall. "It's the
end of an era."</TE>
<TE>   Her friend Julie Peek agreed. "You can feel a certain nostalgia in
this place," she said. "Other places aren't this way."</TE>
<TE>   Owner Sam Barnese said the $1 prices were his way of thanking
bowling enthusiasts and others who made the 32-lane bowling alley on
Santa Monica Boulevard a local institution.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, we made a lot of folks happy," Barnese said as workers
removed an ATM, pay telephones and a cigarette vending machine.
"Maybe they'll even miss us."</TE>
<TE>   That was evident as the 11 p.m. closing time approached.</TE>
<TE>   Barnese hugged longtime regulars, posed for pictures and gave away
autographed bowling pins to those who asked.</TE>
<TE>   "This is too much," he said, fighting tears.</TE>
<TE>   Some wandered around the crowded bowling alley with video cameras
recording its last night.</TE>
<TE>   Star Lanes, which Barnese and his father opened in 1960, was
closing because the Los Angeles Unified School District needs the
land for a new elementary school. After apparently telling school
officials early on that he would sell the 3-acre parcel, Barnese
later said he wouldn't give up the property.</TE>
<TE>   A judge earlier this year ruled in the district's favor, ordering
the bowling center's closure.</TE>
<TE>   District officials want the land for an elementary school that
would accommodate 800 students. The neighborhood's school, Ramona
Elementary, is only three blocks away from Star Lanes and is bulging
at its seams with 1,200 students.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles School Board President Caprice Young, who represented
the area, said officials were left with little choice because other
possible sites might have meant the loss of low-income housing, a
valuable commodity in an already overcrowded neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Barnese's bowling alley was an attractive choice because it meant
sparing homes, Young said. It was easy for officials to try to obtain
the property since Barnese was the only owner.</TE>
<TE>   And because he indicated early on that he was willing to sell, a
contention he now hotly denies, Young said district officials went
ahead and used eminent domain--the ability of governments to take
private land for the public good--after they could not reach a
purchase agreement with Barnese.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the best site," Young said.</TE>
<TE>   At the bowling alley, Young's explanation was dismissed by
patrons, many of whom signed petitions urging that Star Lanes be
saved.</TE>
<TE>   "Why destroy a family-oriented place to put in a school?" asked
32-year-old Paul Chen. "I'm not against schools, but that makes no
sense to me."</TE>
<TE>   The alley's longtime chief maintenance worker, Clay Rand, invoked
some gallows humor to illustrate the dilemma facing Barnese.</TE>
<TE>   "The school district is to us," Rand said, "what Enron was to
Arthur Andersen."</TE>
<TE>   Many in the crowd Wednesday said it made little sense to abolish a
local icon, characterized by its 1960s look, that became known
worldwide since the 1998 bowling cult film "The Big Lebowski" was
filmed there.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a great movie," Newhall said. "And the people here are
friendly."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Barnese prepared for the last night of business.</TE>
<TE>   Mindful that the alley ran out of beer the night before, the owner
told Rand to pick up 30 cases of Corona for Wednesday night.</TE>

man who offered $5,000 for the 5-foot-high neon star on one wall.</TE>
<TE>   "Talk to the school district," he said.</TE>
<TE>   School officials say the district will officially take possession
of the property at 12:01 a.m. today, leading to the possibility that
the bowling alley will be razed by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The new school should be completed in about two years, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   That didn't impress Star Lanes waitress Antonella Cannalire, 29,
who helped collect almost 6,000 signatures to try to save the bowling
alley.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids who would be in this new school could have used this
place for recreation," she said. "I think the school district people
are evil."</TE>

farewell. Newhall is a fan of the 1998 cult bowling movie "The Big
Lebowski," which was filmed at Star Lanes. "We feel horrible," said
Newhall about the demise of the 1960s-styled, neon-lighted alley.
"It's the end of an era."</CP>

<HD>Convention Board OKs Reforms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stung by criticism of wasteful spending, the Los Angeles Convention
and Visitors Bureau board approved rules Wednesday governing travel
and bonuses, and agreed to expand the board to include a critic of
past practices.</LD>
<LD>   The action came on the same day that the city Convention Center
Commission voted to meet with City Council members to express
concerns about the large number of convention cancellations and the
low number of bookings by the bureau.</LD>
<LD>   "It's no longer just a minor concern," said Commission Vice
President Lesa Slaughter. "It's now reached crisis proportions."</LD>
<TE>   Commission President Peter Zen said the convention center needs 38
conventions each year to break even, but the bureau had booked fewer
than half that number for next year as of its last report.</TE>
<TE>   The commission discussed the possibility of asking the city to
cancel its $18-million contract with the bureau to book the center
and promote tourism, but took no action.</TE>
<TE>   The bureau's board of directors voted Wednesday to expand the
panel from 15 to 18 members and appointed Slaughter to fill one of
the new seats.</TE>
<TE>   Slaughter, who served as chief of staff to former Mayor Richard
Riordan, has been a vocal critic of the bureau's spending practices,
as detailed in stories in The Times.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, she has expressed outrage about awarding bonuses to
salespeople who secure letters of intent from groups saying they may
hold a convention in Los Angeles. At least 20 conventions used to
justify about $225,000 in bonuses in the last four years eventually
canceled.</TE>
<TE>   The board voted Wednesday to require conventions to sign a
license, or contract, with the city Convention Center before the
event can be counted toward bonuses. The nonbinding letters of intent
are no longer enough to consider a convention booked for purposes of
awarding bonuses, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The new policy is similar to the standard used in other cities
with convention centers, including Long Beach and Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   The board also decided that convention salespeople will work on a
straight salary, with no bonuses, unless a specific bonus proposal is
approved by a five-member oversight panel, said board member Javier
Cano.</TE>
<TE>   Board members said the change will make sure any bonuses are
justified.</TE>
<TE>   "The board has taken informed and assertive action," said Board
Chairman Alan Rothenberg.</TE>
<TE>   The panel also approved a draft of a 20-page travel policy and
agreed to circulate it to travel industry experts before giving it
final approval.</TE>
<TE>   The Times recently reported that the bureau has spent $3 million
annually on travel, food and entertainment in its quest to promote
the city in the United States and abroad.</TE>
<TE>   During one trade mission to London, the bureau spent $10,000 for a
dinner at Kensington Palace and $84,000 to entertain tour operators
at the Wimbledon tennis championships. One delegate stayed five
nights in an $854 per-night suite at the Four Seasons hotel.</TE>
<TE>   The bureau refused Wednesday to release the new travel rules, but
said they prohibit the bureau from paying the travel expenses of
spouses and forbid the use of city funds to pay for hotel suites.</TE>
<TE>   The bill for the Four Seasons was paid for by bureau membership
dues, not city funds. The Wimbledon event was paid for from city
funds.</TE>
<TE>   "In my view [the policy] is as comprehensive as you'll find
anywhere," said board member William Kramer.</TE>
<TE>   Slaughter welcomed the appointment to the board and said the new
restrictions on bonuses are a positive action.</TE>

<HD>Disabled Youths Fit Right in at 'Camp Attitude'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIN GRENNAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When boarding a hay ride earlier this week, 14-year-old Billy Brower
of Ventura clenched his fists and started to cry. Billy, who has
cerebral palsy, was always afraid of horses, but after this
experience, he stopped to give the horse a carrot and a kiss.</LD>
<LD>   Hours before, Roman Chavez quietly declared he didn't want to go
in a boat around Lake Casitas. With some gentle encouragement, the
Santa Paula 15-year-old with muscular dystrophy took the cruise,
which he later admitted was a lot of fun.</LD>
<LD>   Billy, Roman and 21 other youths with disabilities are in Oak View
this week challenging their limits at Camp Attitude. The children,
from throughout California and Arizona, and their families are
getting a chance to scale climbing walls, swing from a cable 40 feet
in the air and take trips to the beach and a Dodger game, all for
free.</LD>
<TE>   "It's only been a day and there's already been so many fabulous
things to do," said Billy's mother, Kim Brower. "This is way beyond
anything that I had in my imagination."</TE>
<TE>   The camp was organized by Mark Zier, a former youth pastor at
Ventura Missionary Church, and Dan Whitney, an inspirational speaker
who lives in Scotts Valley near Santa Cruz.</TE>
<TE>   The pair, who met when Zier was Whitney's youth pastor in San
Diego, raised $70,000 in donations from churches, corporations and
individuals with the help of the Santa Paula Optimist Club, Zier
said, adding that organizing the camp took about 10 months.</TE>
<TE>   Whitney, 36, said he was motivated to start such a camp since his
recovery from a mountain biking accident in December 2000. After the
software salesman broke his neck, doctors told him he had a
one-in-a-million chance of walking again. He now walks, albeit
slowly, with the help of a leg brace and crutch.</TE>
<TE>   During his recovery, Whitney met Ron Heagy, a paraplegic who had
started the first Camp Attitude in Oregon two years ago. When Whitney
spoke at the Oregon camp last August, he and Zier, 56, decided to
bring a similar camp to Southern California to make it easier for
more disabled children to participate.</TE>
<TE>   The fledgling camp--held at Forest Home at Rancho del Rey, a
Christian retreat and conference center--has 40 people on a waiting
list for next year and Zier and Whitney want to eventually open one
or two camps in Arizona near Flagstaff.</TE>
<TE>   "When [children with disabilities] are lucky enough to go to a
regular camp, they feel like outsiders," Whitney said. "This is a
place where they can come and just be themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Kim and Dean Brower have taken Billy and his 16-year-old sister,
who also has physical disabilities, to several camps and day programs
for Boy Scouts and the disabled, but say this is the first weeklong
camp their children have attended designed exclusively for disabled
youths.</TE>
<TE>   The camp is a luxury the family would never have been able to
afford on its own, Kim Brower said. The best part, she said, is how
patient and accommodating the dozens of volunteers have been.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually, everywhere we go we feel like we're forcing ourselves on
people," Brower said in tears. "Here, there's not a 'No.' It's,
'Let's think. We'll work something out.' "</TE>
<TE>   In particular she praised the "huggers"--teen volunteers without
disabilities who are assigned to each camper. The interaction with
peers without disabilities is something that disabled children can
miss out on, Brower said.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Arreguin of Oxnard said the huggers for her 5-year-old
daughter Amelia, who has spina bifida, grabbed the girl and started
playing with her moments after she arrived at the camp. The next
afternoon, an adult volunteer wrapped himself around the tiny Amelia
and helped her navigate a couple of feet up the climbing wall.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually, everyone makes her feel that she needs help, that she
needs to be held," Arreguin said. "Here, she feels more like she's
equal to everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the 75 volunteers signed up for Camp Attitude after
hearing Whitney speak at their churches. Adult volunteer Kathy
Campbell of Ventura said it has been inspiring to watch the disabled
children and their families and to see the huggers eagerly take
responsibility for the campers.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been indescribable," Campbell said. "It's been a
humbling experience."</TE>

<HD>Drug, Money Probe Leads to Multiple Raids</HD>
<DH>Crime: Vehicles, guns and cash are seized after two-year
investigation by Riverside County and DEA agents. Costa Mesa car
dealer is targeted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE and CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At least a dozen federal drug agents and Riverside County law
enforcement officers raided a Costa Mesa car dealership Wednesday,
removing as many as 90 exotic cars that authorities believe are
associated with a large-scale methamphetamine manufacturing and
money-laundering scheme.</LD>
<LD>   Police said the raid on the Auto Market in the 2100 block of
Harbor Boulevard was one of several carried out simultaneously in
Orange and Los Angeles counties and the Inland Empire as officers
served 15 search warrants and made a dozen arrests.</LD>
<LD>   It was unclear if any of the arrests were made in Costa Mesa,
although Mike Angel, the Auto Market's manager, said that owner Nader
Amirvand had been taken in for questioning.</LD>
<TE>   "We're very shocked," Angel said from an El Taco parking lot next
door as TV helicopters hovered. "They have no evidence of anything."</TE>
<TE>   The Riverside County Sheriff's Department issued a press release
Wednesday evening describing the raids as the culmination of a
two-year investigation that included many electronic wiretaps and
surveillance operations.</TE>
<TE>   The department said the investigation resulted in 28 indictments
by the San Bernardino district attorney's office and that county's
grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   A Significant Raid</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big bust," said Jose Martinez, a special agent with the
federal Drug Enforcement Administration, which participated in the
raids.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to hauling off Lamborghinis, Mercedes, Jaguars,
Ferraris, Porsches and Bentleys--some worth several hundred thousand
dollars apiece--police at the locations confiscated many weapons,
illegal drugs and cash estimated at $400,000. The Riverside County
Sheriff's Department said it would hold a news conference at 11 a.m.
today, at which officers would display the items seized and name the
suspects arrested.</TE>
<TE>   The Costa Mesa raid, Angel said, began about 9 a.m., when
investigators with a search warrant asked employees to stay behind
police tape as computers, paperwork and the cars were hauled away.
The Auto Market, in business 18 years, was located in Fountain Valley
before moving to its current address two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Defends Firm</TE>
<TE>   Employees watching tow trucks Wednesday were not told by
investigators what was going on, the manager said, but knew from
television reports of alleged drug and money-laundering connections.</TE>
<TE>   "In the next few days," Angel said, "we're going to prove them
wrong. We're clean."</TE>

<HD>Perez's Partner to Serve 5 Years</HD>
<DH>LAPD: Former officer strikes plea bargain for concurrent
state and federal sentences for litany of Rampart crimes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nino Durden, the partner of former LAPD officer Rafael Perez, was
sentenced Wednesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court to a
five-year prison term for crimes connected to the Rampart corruption
scandal.</LD>
<LD>   Durden, 34, pleaded guilty in state court in March 2001 to
conspiring to obstruct justice, perjury under oath, grand theft and
filing a false police report. He has also pleaded guilty to civil
rights violations in federal court and is scheduled to surrender to
federal authorities Sept. 12.</LD>
<LD>   Under the terms of a plea agreement, he will serve the five-year
state prison sentence at the same time as a three-year federal
sentence, authorities said, and he is expected to be free from
federal prison by 2005. Because of credits for good behavior, state
inmates typically serve less than their prescribed sentences.</LD>
<TE>   Durden, who provided investigators with details on numerous crimes
that he and Perez committed, including the cover-up of a shooting of
an unarmed man, stood with his head bowed as Superior Court Judge
David S. Wesley imposed the sentence. Wesley ordered Durden to
surrender Sept. 12, saying that if he failed to do so, "There will be
consequences to pay."</TE>
<TE>   The sentencing is "another step in the unfolding of the saga" of
Rampart, head Deputy Dist. Atty. Bill Hodgman said outside court. "I
think we are considerably along the way there, but there is still
some more to be done and there is still some investigation to be
done."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has prosecuted
nine officers in connection with misconduct in LAPD's Rampart
Division. Seven officers, including Durden and Perez, have been
convicted. Three of the jury convictions were overturned and are on
appeal. One officer was acquitted and one still awaits trial.</TE>
<TE>   During extensive debriefings with prosecutors and federal agents,
Durden admitted that he and Perez shot an unarmed man, Javier
Francisco Ovando in 1996, planted a gun on him and lied in court to
help send him to prison on a 23-year sentence. Ovando, who was
paralyzed below the waist, has since been released from prison and
has received a $15-million settlement from the city of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Durden also admitted guilt in three other incidents in which he
said innocent people were either arrested or victimized. Durden said
he and Perez framed one man on a weapons charge, stole $1,300 from
another and stole property from a third, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Durden's statements to authorities served as a catalyst in
prosecuting Perez, who was sentenced in federal court in May to two
years in prison for violating Ovando's civil rights. He also served
three years in state prison for stealing cocaine from LAPD evidence
lockers before being released last year. Perez was granted immunity
from state prosecution for framing Ovando.</TE>
<TE>   Though authorities originally believed that Durden would implicate
other officers, he provided details only about crimes that he and his
partner committed. Perez, on the other hand, reportedly implicated
about 70 Rampart officers in what he said was a pattern of misconduct
that involved illegal beatings, shootings and false arrests.</TE>
<TE>   Durden's attorney, Bill Seki, said outside court that Perez's
version is exaggerated. Seki added that his client knows what he did
was wrong, but he should not have received a longer prison sentence
than Perez.</TE>
<TE>   "He's extremely disappointed and probably somewhat angry that he
has been made out to be the one to be the bad guy," Seki said.</TE>
<TE>   Hodgman said that Perez was the top figure in the Rampart
misconduct, but that Durden also committed several crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "Durden admitted his culpability in quite a range of misconduct,
so as far as I'm concerned, I think the sentence he received today
was very fair, even in light of his cooperation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hodgman said the debriefings of Durden helped provide prosecutors
with an understanding of what happened at Rampart, though he said
authorities will never completely know the extent of misconduct in
the division.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we had a situation that was more along the lines of a
communist cell-type model as opposed to a vast conspiracy," he said,
adding that Perez gave officials "some truths, some lies, some
exaggeration and some speculation."</TE>

<KH>THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR</KH>
<HD>In Visit to State, Cheney Is Mum on Backing Simon</HD>
<DH>Politics: The vice president neither sees the GOP candidate
for governor nor speaks of his campaign.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD and TIM REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>In a one-day swing through California to raise money for state
Republican candidates, Vice President Dick Cheney spoke out about the
recent wave of corporate misdeeds, defending the majority of business
leaders as forthright and upstanding.</LD>
<LD>   But the vice president did not lend a word of public support for
GOP candidate Bill Simon Jr., whose gubernatorial campaign has been
struggling to contain the fallout from a $78-million verdict against
his family's investment firm.</LD>
<LD>   Cheney and Simon were scheduled to attend a private state party
fund-raiser in Burlingame on Wednesday night. But they did not appear
in public together--even though they spent the morning just miles
apart in the Bay Area. In a morning address to the Commonwealth Club
of California at a hotel here, Cheney steered clear of the governor's
race, speaking instead about the economy and terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   Outside the hotel, more than 300 raucous protesters called for the
impeachment of the vice president, who formerly led a Texas energy
firm, Halliburton Co., which is under investigation by the Securities
and Exchange Commission for accounting irregularities.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney declined to comment on practices at the company, citing the
ongoing probe. At the same time, across the bay, Simon told members
of the Oakland Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce about his plan to
increase the state's stock of affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   He said he is confident that the White House supports him and that
President Bush still plans to appear with him at fund-raisers this
month.</TE>
<TE>   "The White House is still totally behind us," he said in a San
Francisco radio interview.</TE>
<TE>   By not publicly voicing his support for Simon during his
California visit, the vice president lent weight to speculation that
the White House would like to put space between a president trying to
craft an image of toughness against corporate malfeasance and a
Republican candidate with business problems, some political analysts
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The administration is between a rock and a hard place ... because
they want to still be competitive in California," said Jaime
Regalado, executive director of the Pat Brown Institute of Public
Affairs at Cal State Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Cheney's action is highly symbolic of an administration
that is rapidly trying to distance itself from a very poorly run
campaign."</TE>
<TE>   Publicly, the White House maintained its support of Simon's
candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   "This administration believes Bill Simon will improve California
schools, fix the economy and improve the quality of life for all
Californians," Bush spokesman Ken Lisaius said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   But a Republican source familiar with the administration's
discussions said the verdict against Simon's firm has caused
consternation at the White House.</TE>
<TE>   "They're in a lousy spot," said the source, who spoke anonymously
to preserve relations with the White House. "There is no way for them
to cancel without dealing with accusations that they're writing off
the race and writing off California."</TE>
<TE>   Cheney aides said a public appearance with the gubernatorial
nominee was never intended for this trip, during which the vice
president also attended a Central Valley fund-raiser for state Sen.
Richard Monteith (R-Modesto), who is seeking to fill the seat of Rep.
Gary Condit (D-Ceres).</TE>
<TE>   The vice president's day had been "set up this way for a while,"
said spokeswoman Cathie Martin, noting that Bush soon will attend
three fund-raisers to benefit Simon's campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Some Republican observers said that visit will be closely watched.</TE>
<TE>   "If the president later this month doesn't show up, then I think
that might be cause for concern," said GOP strategist Mike Madrid.</TE>
<TE>   As for Cheney, some questioned whether a joint public appearance
would have helped Simon, given the vice president's own association
with alleged misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   "If Cheney with Halliburton and Simon with his problems came
together on the same stage, the political cartoonists would have a
field day," said Larry Gerston, a San Jose State political scientist.</TE>
<TE>   In his speech Wednesday, Cheney said Bush is taking a firm stand
on corporate integrity because he recognizes that the country's
economic system is rooted in its faith in business leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "All of us recognize that the vast majority of men and women in
the business community are honest and aboveboard," the vice president
said before his speech was interrupted by five protesters, who
chanted "Cheney is a corporate crook!" and "No war in Iraq!" before
they were taken from the Fairmont Hotel ballroom.</TE>
<TE>   "Acts of fraud and theft are outside the norm in corporate
America, but when those acts do occur--where corporate greed and
malfeasance cause honest people to lose their jobs, life savings and
pensions--people's confidence in the system is undermined and
wrongdoers must be held to account," the vice president said.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Cheney was asked how the record of Halliburton would stand
up to corporate integrity standards now being espoused by the Bush
administration.</TE>
<TE>   After calling Halliburton a "fine" company of which he was proud,
Cheney said he could not comment because of the SEC's probe of the
firm's accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   "There are editorial writers all over America poised to put pen to
paper and condemn me for exercising undue, improper influence by
saying too much about it since this is a matter pending before an
independent regulatory agency," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, meanwhile, sought to change the subject Wednesday. He told
Oakland business leaders that California suffers from a severe
shortage of affordable housing, noting that the state's homeownership
rate is the third-lowest in the nation, just ahead of New York and
Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   "Homeownership is the cornerstone of family security, stability
and prosperity," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   The investment manager laid out a plan to increase the
availability of homes, proposing to loosen land-use restrictions on
housing developments, roll back prevailing wage laws and restructure
how local governments finance developments.</TE>
<TE>   "With your help and guidance, California can be a state that
stands for limited government and unlimited opportunity," he added.</TE>
<TE>   After his speech, Simon fielded more questions about last week's
jury verdict, which stemmed from a business deal between his family's
firm and a Los Angeles pay phone company owned by Paul Edward
Hindelang Jr.</TE>
<TE>   The jury found that the Simon investment group defrauded Hindelang
by hiding from him its plan to quickly load the company with debt and
take it public. The company ultimately was seized by its lenders.</TE>
<TE>   "There are judgments occasionally that are outlandish, and this
happens to be one of them," said Simon, who repeated his belief that
the verdict will be overturned. "It's not supported by the facts."</TE>
<TE>   In an earlier interview with a San Francisco radio station, Simon
called the verdict "silly" and "outrageous."</TE>
<TE>   "It's what's wrong, honestly, with our legal system, in terms of
some of these crazy verdicts," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've talked about stopping harassing lawsuits on the campaign
trail, and now I find myself a victim of one."</TE>

<HD>Hahn Signs Ordinances Aimed at Luring Back Former LAPD
Officers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn approved several steps Wednesday
aimed at making it easier for the Los Angeles Police Department to
rehire officers who have retired or quit to work for other law
enforcement agencies.</LD>
<LD>   The mayor, signing ordinances introduced by Councilwoman Cindy
Miscikowski, agreed to reduce the probationary period from 18 months
to six months for those officers.</LD>
<LD>   The new city laws also allow patrol officers who return to the
LAPD to reclaim the rank they held when they left and will waive the
training fees owed to the city when officers leave the department
soon after they graduate from the academy.</LD>
<TE>   In recent years, the city attorney's office has attempted to
collect those fees--$60,000 for officers who complete the LAPD
training and leave to join another department--either from officers
or from the agencies that recruit them from the LAPD. Some agencies
have agreed to pay all or part of that sum to get LAPD officers to
join their departments.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's action Wednesday represents the city's latest effort
to improve Police Department hiring and stem the depletion of the
LAPD's ranks that dates back to administration of former Mayor
Richard Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, working through the city's personnel department and the
LAPD, has accelerated the hiring process, reducing the time from
nearly a year to three months in many cases.</TE>
<TE>   He also implemented a new work schedule, allowing officers to work
fewer days a week with longer hours, fulfilling a campaign promise
that helped him secure the endorsement of the Los Angeles Police
Protective League during last year's mayoral election.</TE>
<TE>   "Today we are sending a strong message to both police officers and
the people of Los Angeles that we are looking at any and all options
that will attract well-trained officers to our police force," Hahn
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to encourage as many former LAPD officers who left in
good standing to return to a new LAPD, one that now offers a flexible
work schedule, and an organization that will soon have a new chief of
police."</TE>
<TE>   Interim LAPD Chief Martin Pomeroy, who is heading the department
while the Police Commission and the mayor search for a permanent
chief, welcomed the move. The department, Pomeroy said, will benefit
if it can bring back officers who are familiar with its training and
procedures.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said he hopes to bring the department to a full force of
10,000 officers. But Riordan fell short of that same goal and, even
though the exodus of officers has slowed in recent months, the LAPD
continues to lose officers faster than it hires new ones.</TE>
<TE>   The city has sent letters to about 400 former officers who would
be eligible to return.</TE>
<TE>   Of those, 62 have already submitted applications to be rehired,
city officials say.</TE>

<HD>2 Agents Charged in Alleged Beating</HD>
<DH>Courts: Border Patrol pair enter not-guilty pleas to
assaulting an undocumented immigrant in a Chula Vista holding cell.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Border Patrol agents faced charges Wednesday for allegedly
beating an undocumented immigrant inside a holding cell in San Diego
County--the first such criminal case in Southern California in
approximately three years, according to the U.S. attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   Robert V. Curtin, 26, and John R. Wallace, 38, pleaded not guilty
in U.S. District Court in San Diego to charges that they assaulted
Erik Mendoza-Rubio of Mexico after he was arrested last summer.</LD>
<LD>   A federal grand jury indicted the two agents Friday on charges of
violating Mendoza's civil rights and abusing their official powers.
If convicted, they could receive a maximum of 10 years in prison and
fines of up to $250,000. They remain free on $25,000 bond.</LD>
<TE>   Mendoza, 21, will be allowed to remain in the United States until
the resolution of the case, U.S. officials said. He could not be
reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Curtin's and Wallace's attorneys strongly denied the charges
Wednesday but said that neither they nor their clients would comment
in detail.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Bauman, a spokesman for the patrol's San Diego sector, said
the men, who joined the force about six years ago, were put on paid
administrative leave Wednesday. They had been transferred to office
duties last summer when the investigation began, Bauman said.</TE>
<TE>   "They are innocent until proven guilty," he said. "These agents
will have an opportunity to address the accusations in court. U.S.
Border Patrol agents are held to the highest professional and moral
standards ... and allegations against two individuals should not be
allowed to tarnish the reputation of nearly 10,000 dedicated agents
nationwide."</TE>
<TE>   The Border Patrol's San Diego sector employs 1,700 agents and is
responsible for guarding 66 miles of the border with Mexico. The
region has historically been a hotbed of migrant smuggling.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Tenorio, who is prosecuting
the case, said Mendoza was arrested by San Diego police last Aug. 30
in Chula Vista. Mendoza was a passenger in a car that allegedly held
two smuggled migrants in the trunk, Tenorio said. Because he was
suspected of being an illegal immigrant and possibly a smuggler, he
was turned over to the U.S Border Patrol.</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza was transferred to a holding cell in the agency's Chula
Vista station. He was never charged with smuggling.</TE>
<TE>   In the holding cell, the indictment alleges, Curtin and Wallace
assaulted Mendoza causing "bodily injury." Tenorio said he could not
discuss the extent of the injuries, but they were severe enough to
require medical treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "We get quite a few allegations" of abuse by Border Patrol agents,
Tenorio said, but "it is pretty hard to corroborate them. In this
one, we had reliable corroborating evidence."</TE>
<TE>   Tenorio said he would not elaborate on the evidence until the
trial, which is yet to be scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   He said the last time a Border Patrol agent in the
California-Mexico border was criminally charged was nearly three
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   There have been prosecutions in other parts of the country. Two
years ago, a Border Patrol agent in Hidalgo County, Texas, was
indicted on charges that he beat a suspected illegal border crosser
in the head with a flashlight.</TE>
<TE>   Tenorio said many cases are handled administratively. Earlier this
year, another San Diego Border Patrol agent who had been accused of
abuse agreed to resign to avoid prosecution, Tenorio said.</TE>
<TE>   Claudia Smith, border project director with the California Rural
Legal Assistance Foundation, a migrants advocacy and watchdog group,
said that reports of violence by Border Patrol agents have dropped
significantly, but that rough treatment persists.</TE>
<TE>   Migrants tell her they are safe as long as they don't run from the
agents, Smith said. But "whether they run or not, or mouth off or
not, it is no justification for excessive use of force."</TE>

<HD>Defendant in '84 Slayings Testifies</HD>
<DH>Trial: He denies killings and says he made up story about
a gunman to avoid extradition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Josif Jurcoane testified Wednesday that fear of being wrongly accused
of a double homicide made him flee to Mexico 18 years ago and then
fabricate a story about a killer nicknamed "El Loco" to avoid
extradition last year.</LD>
<LD>   But Jurcoane, 52, steadfastly denied during his murder trial that
he was the triggerman in the July 4, 1984, slayings of Antelope
Valley rancher Lloyd William Bryden, 67, and Bryden's live-in
girlfriend, Alice B. McCannel, 39.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors, who are seeking life imprisonment without parole, say
Jurcoane was prompted to violence by an argument between his wife and
McCannel over the ownership of livestock.</LD>
<TE>   Defense attorney Arnold M. Notkoff told Judge Shari K. Silver he
had advised his client not to take the witness stand. But Jurcoane
insisted on doing so, and once on the stand he wavered over the
details of his story.</TE>
<TE>   Under questioning by Notkoff, Jurcoane said he was at a Palmdale
bar when he heard about a slaying at the ranch where he had worked as
the manager until three weeks earlier. He said he fled to Tijuana
because he had been fired after an argument with Bryden over job
responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Jurcoane, speaking through an interpreter, told the seven-woman,
five-man jury in San Fernando Superior Court that he knew he was
going to be accused.</TE>
<TE>   After his arrest in Mexico, Jurcoane testified, he lied to Mexican
immigration official Sonia Luz Jimenez-Vargas about seeing a man,
whom he knew only as El Loco, shoot the ranchers to death with a
12-gauge shotgun that belonged to Jurcoane. He said he thought the
story would go no further than the official's files.</TE>
<TE>   Jimenez-Vargas testified earlier in the trial about her interview
with Jurcoane, which resulted in his extradition.</TE>
<TE>   Under cross-examination by prosecutor Rouman Ebrahim, Jurcoane
denied owning the shotgun thought to be the murder weapon and denied
knowing anyone named El Loco. He then testified he could not remember
whether he told Jimenez-Vargas that he witnessed the slayings.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you ever consider telling the truth ... instead of making up
a story?" Ebrahim asked.</TE>
<TE>   "No," Jurcoane said.</TE>
<TE>   Notkoff called two witnesses to answer prosecution testimony last
week by Jurcoane's 22-year-old daughter, Josephine, who was 4 at the
time of the killings. She told the jury she heard gunshots and then
saw her father return home and hastily pack his clothes before
vanishing on the day her two neighbors were slain. The family lived
in a trailer adjoining Bryden's 450-acre Mountain Brook Ranch near
Palmdale.</TE>
<TE>   During brief testimony, Jurcoane's son, David, 20, said his sister
never mentioned hearing shots or seeing her father grab clothing and
hastily depart after the slayings.</TE>
<TE>   Josephine Jurcoane "didn't come forward until nine or 10 months
after her father was arrested," Notkoff told the court.</TE>
<TE>   Psychologist Nancy Kaser-Boyd testified that the memory of a
4-year-old "is rather unreliable." Under questioning by the
prosecutor, she acknowledged that a "traumatic experience" such as
the abrupt disappearance of a parent is an event that could
accurately stick in a child's memory.</TE>
<TE>   Closing arguments are expected to be heard today.</TE>

<DH>Inquiry: Board blames Roy Ratliff for shootout with
deputies hours after he kidnapped two girls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kern County sheriff's deputies acted within department policy and
state law when they shot a career criminal in a dry riverbed 12 hours
after he kidnapped two teenage girls at gunpoint from a Quartz Hill
overlook, a sheriff's review board found Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   After more than a dozen interviews with law enforcement officials
and the victims, the panel concluded that Roy D. Ratliff, 37, touched
off the Aug. 1 gunfight by pointing a .38-caliber handgun at a deputy
and firing out the driver's side window of a stolen Ford Bronco.</LD>
<LD>   Deputies James Stratton and Larry Thatcher fired 17 shots at
Ratliff, who died of a gunshot wound to the left cheek, the Kern
County coroner found.</LD>
<TE>   "It was the suspect's actions that caused the deputies to use
deadly force," Kern County Sheriff's Det. Cmdr. Marty Williamson
said. "The suspect had the opportunity to surrender and he failed to
do so by arming himself and firing a weapon at the deputies."</TE>
<TE>   Tamara Brooks, 16, and Jackie Marris, 17, told investigators that
Ratliff, who was facing a potential third-strike offense, also made
comments before and during the shootout that he would not go
peacefully, Williamson said.</TE>
<TE>   After the rescue, The Times followed its practice of not naming
the victims of sexual assault without their permission. The practice,
established to protect victims' privacy, was waived after the girls
agreed to tell their story on television.</TE>
<TE>   Williamson said Wednesday that the deputies asked Ratliff "on
numerous occasions" to put down his weapon and get out of the
vehicle. "They told him to stop, show his hands and gave him numerous
opportunities to surrender. He threatened to kill the girls and the
deputies."</TE>
<TE>   The shootout on a desolate stretch of road off California 178
ended a harrowing ordeal that began with the predawn kidnapping Aug.
1 of the teenagers from separate vehicles parked at a local overlook
known as Quartz Hill Mountain.</TE>
<TE>   The review board heard evidence that after the shots fired by
deputies, Ratliff fell back into the vehicle before again raising his
handgun at Deputy Thatcher, causing Thatcher and Stratton to fire a
second volley that included the fatal shot, Williamson said.</TE>
<TE>   About the same time, the girls started to scream.</TE>
<TE>   One escaped through the rear car window and the second got out
after climbing over Ratliff, slumped in the front seat, Williamson
said.</TE>
<TE>   The board determined that the evidence supported the deputies'
contention that they were unaware the girls were in the vehicle when
the shooting began.</TE>

<HD>County to Fund Study of Military Museum</HD>
<DH>Supervisors: Board OKs a feasibility study on converting a
former Tustin blimp hangar.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County supervisors have bought into plans for a military
museum, deciding this week to spend at least $88,000 to see whether
one of the twin hangars at the closed Tustin Marine Base can be
pressed into service.</LD>
<LD>   A veterans group has proposed converting the 18-story northern
hangar into a showcase for exhibits that reflect life in wartime and
pay homage to the county's 250,000 veterans. The hangar will be
transferred to the county from the Navy following environmental
cleanup of the cavernous structure.</LD>
<LD>   According to plans, the hangar would be filled with thousands of
items donated by about 40 private collectors. Planes, tanks, trucks,
Jeeps, uniforms and photographs are expected to be among the
donations.</LD>
<TE>   Museum organizers have received $2 million of vintage tanks,
landing craft, uniforms and other equipment restored for the movie
"Windtalkers," a Nicolas Cage drama about Marines assigned to protect
Navajo encryption experts in the Pacific during World War II.
Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to pay for the study.</TE>

<HD>Landowner Denies Bulldozing Oaks</HD>
<DH>Hillsides: County says William Kaddis illegally cut down
301 trees near Ojai and faces $3 million in fines, but he contends he
is victim of hate crime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The oak trees are gone. All 301 of them.</LD>
<LD>   The question is, who removed them?</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County officials say property owner William Kaddis used
bulldozers last fall to illegally plow over the trees, leaving barren
nearly half of his 43-acre hillside property outside Ojai.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, Kaddis faces up to $3 million in fines in what
officials believe is the largest illegal tree-removal case in county
history.</TE>
<TE>   But Kaddis, an Egyptian real estate broker, has denied that he
uprooted the trees and contends that he is the victim of a racial
hate crime. He has sued the county for $10 million, accusing
inspectors of trespassing on his property during a visit in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the Ventura County Board of Supervisors rejected
Kaddis' appeal of an earlier Planning Commission ruling. Now the two
sides appear headed for court.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Steve Bennett, whose district includes Kaddis'
property, said he was swayed by "overwhelming evidence" presented by
county planners.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a real rape of the land," Bennett said Wednesday. "You
just can't restore it in the foreseeable future."</TE>
<TE>   Kaddis and his attorney could not be reached for comment
Wednesday. But Kaddis has suggested several theories on how the trees
were uprooted.</TE>
<TE>   Testifying before the Planning Commission in April, Kaddis said
that owners of nearby properties were upset that he had purchased the
$615,000 property near Lake Casitas. One of them disgustedly asked
him, "Where the hell are you from?" he said, and an anonymous letter
threatened that he would be harmed and his groves burned.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not a lawbreaker!" Kaddis told the commissioners. "I'm a
Christian! All of a sudden, when I come to Ventura County, I am
suddenly a lawbreaker!"</TE>
<TE>   But county officials have pointed out that a property owner is
ultimately responsible for land-use violations, even if the
individual did not know that the violations had occurred.</TE>
<TE>   County workers first learned of the tree removal from Kaddis'
neighbors. Inspectors visited the property Oct. 11 and found nearly
20 acres cleared of trees and brush, according to a Planning
Commission report.</TE>
<TE>   They also found a worker, who identified himself as Kaddis'
employee, using a bulldozer to push previously downed trees and brush
into piles. Kaddis did not have permits to uproot the trees or to
remove the brush.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fairly easy to see he was violating the ordinance," said
Scott Ellison, a senior planner with the county. "We could certainly
tell a violation had occurred, and was occurring before our eyes."</TE>
<TE>   Kaddis has acknowledged that he rented two bulldozers during
September and October, but has said they were used to clear brush,
not to knock down trees. Throughout the appeal process, Kaddis has
offered several explanations for the trees' removal from his
property.</TE>
<TE>   One of Kaddis' theories is that the trees were uprooted before he
acquired the property in July 2001. Another is that vandals may have
cut down the trees in a possible hate crime, according to county
documents.</TE>
<TE>   Kaddis filed a complaint in January with the Sheriff's Department,
stating that he had received racist hate mail, was threatened
verbally by neighbors and that his property had been vandalized.</TE>
<TE>   Kaddis turned over to authorities an envelope left on his property
that contained "a typed letter threatening him and expressed
contention with proposed use of the site (i.e. church, campsite for
children or sanctuary for battered women)," according to a Planning
Commission report. "The letter appears to take credit for the dumping
of oak tree brush on the site and for the on-site vandalism."</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department investigated Kaddis' report, but found
"no evidence of a credible threat," according to county documents.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a California Department of Fish and Game biologist who
visited the property Aug. 29 wrote that the "oak woodlands [were]
pristine and undisturbed," and that no tree removal had occurred
prior to that date.</TE>
<TE>   A certified arborist later determined that the trees had been
removed after Kaddis had bought the property.</TE>
<TE>   With the trees removed, county planning officials are concerned
about the potential for erosion, as well as possible stream sediment
buildup.</TE>
<TE>   "It would take hundreds of years to replace an oak tree forest,"
Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   In deciding the penalty for the tree removal, county officials
have several options. They could fine Kaddis as much as $1 million.
Or, they could order him to purchase 20 acres of oak forest in the
county and donate the land to a conservancy or the state as open
space.</TE>
<TE>   A third option would require Kaddis to plant new trees to replace
the mature oaks that were uprooted. Because trees can't always be
replaced with a one-to-one ratio, it may take 50 small trees to
replace one oak, Ellison said.</TE>
<TE>   This last option would be the costliest. Ellison estimates the tab
could run in excess of $3 million to pay for hundreds of oaks and the
acreage on which to plant them.</TE>
<TE>   Oak trees are only part of Kaddis' troubles.</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, he has been investigated by the Ventura County
Public Works Agency, the county Resource Conservation District and
the California Department of Fish and Game on suspicion of various
violations.</TE>
<TE>   Until the tree issue is resolved, Kaddis also will not be allowed
a permit for the 35 dogs he is currently housing illegally in a
kennel on his property, Ellison said.</TE>

and taken to the Orange County Jail, where he was booked on a murder
count and held on $250,000 bail.</LD>
<LD>   "He'd been looked at from Day One, and we finally put a case
together that we feel will stand the rigors of court," said Sgt.
Kevin Thomas, a Fountain Valley Police Department spokesman.</LD>
<LD>   Johnny Tran was killed, and three of his friends wounded, in the
shooting four years ago in the 8900 block of La Dona Court.</LD>

<HD>Freeway Race Ends in Death</HD>
<DH>Crash: Teen who exits car after it hit divider is struck
twice. Six vehicles were in speed contest.</DH>

<LD>A race on the Riverside Freeway in Buena Park late Tuesday left one
man dead after the car he was riding in slammed into a wall and he
was hit by two cars after getting out of the vehicle, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Chad Mester, 18, of Long Beach died at the scene of the accident,
which occurred near Beach Boulevard shortly after 10 p.m. Tuesday and
closed several lanes in both directions.</LD>
<LD>   Mester was riding in a 1993 Toyota driven by an unidentified
18-year-old Cypress man, who lost control of the car and rammed into
the divider, California Highway Patrol Officer Denise Quesada said.</LD>
<TE>   Mester was killed when he got out of the mangled vehicle in the
carpool lane and was struck by a 1999 Mercedes-Benz traveling about
65 mph, Quesada said. The teen was thrown into the opposing carpool
lanes, where he was hit again, this time by a Chevrolet van traveling
about 60 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses told police that the Toyota was among about a half a
dozen cars racing on the freeway at speeds in excess of 100 mph. None
of the other vehicles involved in the drag race stopped after the
accident.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you race on public roads, you put yourself and the
innocent public at risk," Quesada said. "They were taking a big
chance."</TE>
<TE>   Three people were hospitalized, including the driver of the
Toyota, who suffered major injuries.</TE>
<TE>   No arrests have been made, but the investigation is continuing.</TE>

<HD>Police Warn of Serial Rapist Targeting Elderly in Homes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles police are searching for a serial rapist who has attacked
or robbed three elderly women in Hancock Park and Hollywood in the
last two weeks and tried to assault at least two others who escaped.</LD>
<LD>   "We have a very sick individual who is preying on our senior
citizens," said City Councilman Tom LaBonge, who represents the area.
"It's very scary."</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, police issued a warning and a sketch of the man. It
will be posted at senior citizens centers and other locations.</LD>
<TE>   The first attack took place on the afternoon of July 27. An
87-year-old woman home alone near 3rd and June streets in Hancock
Park stepped into her backyard for a moment, leaving her back door
open. When she returned, an intruder inside demanded her money and
ransacked her house. Then he sexually assaulted her and locked her in
a closet. When she freed herself, he was gone.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, a 75-year-old woman was watching television in her
home in the 6000 block of Ivarene Avenue in Hollywood when an
intruder suddenly put his hand over her mouth. He demanded money,
went through her things and sexually assaulted her.</TE>
<TE>   Two days earlier, two women are believed to have foiled the same
man, said Det. Mitzi Roberts. An 81-year-old living near Vine and
Melrose asked a man for identification when he tried to enter her
home, and he fled. And an 82-year-old woman in the same area refused
to open her door.</TE>
<TE>   Then, last Sunday afternoon, an 82-year-old woman in Hancock Park
answered a knock at her door, and a man forced his way in and robbed
her.</TE>
<TE>   In most cases, the attacker has taken money and jewelry.</TE>
<TE>   All the women described the man as olive-skinned, 25 to 35, with a
receding hairline, sometimes wearing a black ball cap.</TE>

<HD>Using a Map to Spot Sex Convicts</HD>
<DH>Crime: O.C. officials hope the Web-based system will let
residents locate offenders in their area. Supervisors will vote on
the plan Tuesday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citing the kidnap-murder of Samantha Runnion and other crimes against
children, county officials want to create an interactive map showing
the general location of Orange County's 2,709 sex offenders and place
it on the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   The plan, which would allow the public to review the map through
the county's Web site, was proposed by Supervisor Todd Spitzer and is
endorsed by Sheriff Michael S. Carona. The Board of Supervisors will
vote on the proposal Tuesday, and Spitzer said he hopes to have the
system in operation within 30 days.</LD>
<LD>   Under Megan's law, named for a 7-year-old New Jersey girl who was
raped and killed by a paroled sex offender, a database listing sex
offenders is available via computers at sheriff stations. To access
the information, residents must fill out and sign an application to
receive a sex offender's name, birth date, criminal record and
picture--but no address.</LD>
<TE>   Spitzer said the Internet map would make it easier for residents
to learn whether sex offenders live in their neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, it's of utmost importance for the public to know where the
sex offenders reside," Spitzer said. "If a crime happens, hopefully
this will provide greater protection."</TE>
<TE>   The system would not provide the sex offender's name or address.
Rather, it would place a marker in the offender's location. It's
unclear how specific the map would be.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego County recently launched an online map. Officials in
Ventura are considering the idea while Los Angeles' board recently
voted to put an online map on its Web site.</TE>
<TE>   But critics worry that the Internet map could lead to more
harassment of sex offenders.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a panacea for the public, and I believe the harassment issue
is real," said Scott Ciment, a Newport Beach criminal defense
attorney and legislative advocate for California Attorneys for
Criminal Justice.</TE>
<TE>   After going online to view San Diego County's site, Ciment found
that an offender can be located even though the address is not
listed. The map places a blue dot over several homes on a block,
narrowing down where the offender lives. Ciment is also troubled by
the suggestion that Samantha's abduction could have been prevented by
such a system. He pointed out that the man accused in her slaying
lived in Riverside County and was not a convicted sex offender.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said the Orange County map would warn residents that
harassing sex offenders is a crime. And Carona said he believes the
map would benefit the public.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is very, very solid," the sheriff said.</TE>

<HD>Davis, Energy Board Defy U.S. Order</HD>
<DH>Power: Agency told state to disband panel and create one
without political appointees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis and his appointees to the board that oversees most of
California's electrical transmission system defied the federal
government Wednesday by refusing to disband the board and create a
new one free of political influence.</LD>
<LD>   The vote by the governing board of the California Independent
System Operator sets the stage for a showdown with the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, which has been pushing states to relinquish
control of their transmission grids in favor of standardized rules.</LD>
<LD>   Last month FERC, the nation's top regulator of power prices,
ordered Cal-ISO to dissolve its governing board of five Davis
appointees in favor of a politically independent board chosen by a
committee.</LD>
<TE>   Davis, who was burned by an electricity deregulation plan that was
crafted before he became governor but went awry on his watch, said he
wants to yield no more authority to FERC and its campaign to foster
private electricity markets.</TE>
<TE>   "The Federal Regulatory Energy Commission order is wrong, and it
comes at the worst possible time," Davis told the Cal-ISO board at a
meeting in Sacramento. "Just as the energy market is beginning to
stabilize in California, they want to reshuffle the deck and take a
giant step backward."</TE>
<TE>   The governor also said he would support a ballot measure this year
or in 2004 that asks Californians whether control of hundreds of
thousands of miles of transmission wires should be in state or
federal hands.</TE>
<TE>   "Their voice would speak volumes not only in Sacramento but in
Washington," he said.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) said this week that he will
sponsor a ballot measure to guarantee state control of the grid if
the Legislature fails to pass a constitutional amendment.</TE>
<TE>   The four members of the Cal-ISO board--there is one vacancy--voted
unanimously to defy the FERC order and instead ask the federal panel
to withdraw it.</TE>
<TE>   The issue probably will wind up in federal court, said Davis legal
advisor Barry Goode.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Cadden, FERC director of external affairs, said no state
governs its transmission system like California.</TE>
<TE>   Since January 2001, the state's biggest buyer of electricity has
been the state itself, which stepped in to serve the customers of
ailing utilities.</TE>
<TE>   "In the Midwest, New York, the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland
Interconnection, New England," said Cadden, "no one on the board has
economic interest."</TE>
<TE>   Amid several recent scandals that highlight corporate governance,
Cadden said, "it seems to me that people would want a completely
independent board."</TE>
<TE>   California and FERC have been arguing about who should oversee
Cal-ISO since 1997, when FERC approved California's deregulation plan
in nearly every element except for Cal-ISO oversight.</TE>
<TE>   Based east of Sacramento in Folsom, Cal-ISO is supposed to serve
as a sort of neutral traffic cop to ensure the steady, smooth flow of
electricity on 75% of the state's transmission grid. Cal-ISO took
control of those wires from the state's private utilities as part of
deregulation.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, as the state's deregulated market began to collapse under
high prices and power shortages, Cal-ISO was overseen by a
FERC-dictated, 26-member board of "stakeholders." Three of the board
members represented power plant owners, and three were chosen by
private utilities.</TE>
<TE>   That board deadlocked repeatedly over whether to limit the prices
Cal-ISO would pay for the last-minute power needed to balance the
grid.</TE>
<TE>   In December 2000, FERC emasculated the board, making it advisory.
In January 2001, with the state gripped by the threat of blackouts
and two big utilities teetering toward bankruptcy, Davis signed a
bill that created an entirely new Cal-ISO board of his appointees.</TE>
<TE>   FERC questioned Davis' authority to do so but did not challenge
him until last month.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would we possibly go back to this nightmare when all we did
every day was scramble to see if we could find power to keep the
lights on that day?" Davis said. "That is a nightmare that I want to
recede in my mind, not revisit."</TE>
<TE>   As justification for their vote Wednesday, Cal-ISO board members
cited a letter sent Tuesday by state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer warning
that following the FERC order would violate state law.</TE>
<TE>   Back at FERC headquarters in Washington, a federal mediator said
Wednesday that he was "extremely optimistic" that California would be
able to renegotiate a majority of the long-term power deals it
entered into last year when the market was at its peak. California
officials are seeking a $21-billion reduction on $43 billion in
long-term contracts.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to tentative agreements reached with five power
companies, "significant offers" have been exchanged by the state and
eight other sellers, said Curtis L. Wagner Jr., FERC's chief
administrative law judge.</TE>
<TE>   Some offers would require the state to drop any legal action
against the companies.</TE>
<TE>   "If settlement can be reached on terms such as those that are now
being discussed, the people of California will receive both lower
rates and sufficient electric power to fulfill their needs for many
years to come," Wagner said in a report to FERC's governing board,
which assigned him to try to broker an agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Wagner scheduled a round of meetings Aug. 28-30 in Washington to
resolve outstanding differences.</TE>

<HD>Stargazing at Grauman's Puts Idols Within Reach</HD>
<DH>Famous hand and footprints offer a unique way for tourists
to connect with entertainment legends.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FERRELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"It's ironic that in Hollywood, where history is written on the wind
and where our product deteriorates with time ... the cement in
Grauman's forecourt is the only lasting memorial to artists who've
made Hollywood famous."</LD>
<LD>   --Hedda Hopper,</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Times, 1953</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With no video, no lasers and not a single moving part, the colored
slabs of concrete at Grauman's Chinese Theatre present an eerie
interactive experience.</TE>
<TE>   Memories dance in the elliptical courtyard of the garish movie
house on Hollywood Boulevard. At least a million tourists a year are
believed to visit the shrine to film stars, living and dead, and no
two visitors experience it the same. They move across the handprints,
shoe prints and signatures in cement, as Lou Sitran did, and see
scenes. They hear snippets of old dialogue. They feel joys and
heartaches and moments of laughter they may have felt a year ago or
half a century ago, sitting in a theater or in front of a television.</TE>
<TE>   "I gotta million of 'em!" Sitran, on vacation from Detroit,
exclaimed as he found the prints left by Jimmy Durante on Halloween
in 1945. The great stage and film comic, known for his oversized
"schnoz" and several trademark lines, including that one, died 22
years ago in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the spectral hands in cement remain a powerful artifact to a
man like Sitran, who laughed at Durante's shtick as a youth. Now in
his own middle age, Sitran found himself looking back, his mind
swirling with images, as he located the monuments of Humphrey Bogart
and Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth and Elizabeth Taylor, Jack Nicholson
and Sidney Poitier.</TE>
<TE>   "There's Shirley Temple," he said, staring at the spot where the
child star wrote "Love to you all" above her signature in 1935. A
young girl's grin, her curls, her audacious antics--they are alive
for Sitran, but not for everyone. Culture changes. Bright lights
fade.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little disturbing," Sitran said, to realize that many know
the name only as a liquor-less cocktail. "Some of these kids [today]
would say, 'I drank one of those.' "</TE>
<TE>   More than 170 slabs fill the Grauman's courtyard, and a few more
are added each year to empty patches. The first, signed by Mary
Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, who co-owned the theater with
Grauman, were cast in 1927, when the ornate, pagoda-topped movie
palace was opened. Lore holds that theater mogul Sid Grauman came up
with the idea of preserving footprints in cement through
serendipity--he accidentally stepped in a wet piece of concrete
himself during construction.</TE>
<TE>   Grauman, however, would not make his own prints part of the
showcase until 1946, the year that Bogart, Gene Tierney and Louella
Parsons joined the ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   The magic of the place is that you can state with certainly that
you were right where your idol was--and even prove it. You can snap
the photo. You can compare your hand to Arnold Schwarzenegger's,
literally stand in the shoe prints of Steve McQueen or Lana Turner.
You can press your fist into the exact spot where John Wayne cast his
fist in 1950, seeing him in your mind, his Army helmet cocked
sideways.</TE>
<TE>   You can connect, as nearly as it's possible to connect, with
legends that are forever out of reach.</TE>
<TE>   "Although it's cold cement, you're actually touching part of the
stars," said author Gloria Koenig, who wrote in detail about the
courtyard's 40-foot walls, its stone sculptures and the elaborate
interior of the 2,258-seat theater in her book, "Iconic L.A.: Stories
of L.A.'s Most Memorable Buildings."</TE>
<TE>   No attraction in Los Angeles County is as sought out by tourists
from throughout the world as the theater forecourt, she said, an
assertion bolstered by a traveler survey of a few years ago. Ninety
percent of those who visit Hollywood make it a point to stop here,
said Leron Gubler of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. "Without
doubt," he said, "it's the most famous movie palace in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Like fossil records, the hand and footprints give a sense of scale
to stars you probably will never see, even if they are living.</TE>
<TE>   "You relate to them different," said Mike Orem, a Whittier
resident "doing the tourist thing" with out-of-town guests. "You
relate to them as people."</TE>
<TE>   Orem's eyes scanned the pavement and picked out the prints cast by
Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon--who can forget them as "The Odd

<TE>   Catie Stibel, 17, of Great Falls, Mont., couldn't believe she got
to stand where Tom Cruise stood. Her uncle, John Stibel, who lives in
Culver City, found himself reminiscing about Red Skelton--the
stand-up comic who amused an earlier generation of television
audiences as "Clem Kadiddlehopper" and "Freddie the Freeloader."</TE>

<TE>   During the summer tourist season, 100 visitors often crowd the

disgorge new groups with clockwork regularity. Costumed figures pace
the sidewalk out front: a whip-toting black cat, Wonder Woman, Yoda
from the "Star Wars" films and Marilyn Monroe.</TE>
<TE>   Jessie Brennan, 16, was here from Austin, Texas, and looking for
the real Marilyn's footprints. Brennan is such a fan that she
collects Marilyn Monroe mugs, posters and statuettes. "I even dyed my
hair blond," she said--though it is back to brunet.</TE>
<TE>   Trod under by the throngs are the prints of stars already largely
forgotten: Jack Oakie, William Lundigan, Constance Talmadge, Monty
Woolley.</TE>
<TE>   Colleen Moore, among the first to press her hands into the
concrete in 1927, is fading. Long ago, a fan named her daughter after
the actress. That young Colleen Moore grew up, married and became
Colleen Moore Fabbri. Now she too is dying. Her daughter, Nadine,
returned from missionary work in Spain and drove north from Oceanside
to have her photo taken beside the handprints of the actress.</TE>
<TE>   "This will mean something when Mom's not around," Nadine Fabbri
said. "It will mean something to my kids, if I ever have them. I'll
say, 'Your grandmother was named after her--whoever she was.' "</TE>

<HD>Sight of Each Other Still Days Away for Twins</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Formerly conjoined sisters remain heavily
sedated, but doctors are optimistic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ. F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA physicians say it will be at least a few more days before
1-year-old Guatemalan twins Maria Teresa and Maria de Jesus Quiej
Alvarez can open their eyes and get their first glimpse of one
another.</LD>
<LD>   The formerly conjoined twins are in critical but stable condition
after a 22-hour operation to separate them. Maria Teresa underwent
five more hours of surgery Tuesday to remove a pool of blood that had
formed under her scalp.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, doctors expressed confidence that both girls would
survive.</LD>
<TE>   "These children are very sick, but we take care of sick kids all
the time," said Dr. Andy Madikians, the attending physician in the
pediatric intensive care unit at UCLA's Mattel Children's Hospital.
"Once we get the breathing tubes out, we'll have a better way of
judging."</TE>
<TE>   The pair lay motionless Wednesday in separate beds in a corner of
the unit, each attached to a cardiac monitor and a ventilator.
Bandages covered the tops of their heads and were wrapped under their
chins, obscuring most of their faces. Under the bandages, Maria
Teresa had a device to measure the pressure inside her head. Both
twins were heavily sedated.</TE>
<TE>   The sedation "gives us a good 24 to 48 hours to let the brain
relax after the surgery," Madikians said. Within the next day,
physicians will start reducing the anesthesia, and the girls will
start breathing on their own within a week, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The first 48 hours are more critical," Madikians said. "Every day
after that, the chances of swelling are less and less."</TE>
<TE>   Each twin has a nurse assigned to her around the clock.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference Wednesday, the girls' father marveled at how
different las Maritas look, now that they are separated. He said he
has trouble recognizing their features.</TE>
<TE>   The father, Wenceslao Quiej Lopez, 21, attended the conference
with two nieces, his cousin and his wife, Alba Leticia Alvarez, 22.
Alvarez, who has avoided media contact in recent days, stood by her
husband but did not answer any questions.</TE>
<TE>   "They give thanks to God that their children are doing well," said
Berta Acosta, a pediatric intensive care unit nurse who translated
for the father. "He feels that the future looks very bright for his
children. It was difficult to care for them when they were attached."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez wasn't the only one who was grateful. The Guatemalan consul
this week sent a letter of thanks to the UCLA doctors and "all
concerned" for this "marvelous gesture of good will."</TE>
<TE>   The consul, John L. Uhmen, wrote that the Guatemalan people in
that Central American nation and all over the world are following the
events with interest.</TE>
<TE>   "From the bottom of our hearts, thank you!" he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The girls were born with their skulls fused at the top so they
faced opposite directions.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA surgeons worked through the night Monday to cut through the
bone, redirect shared blood vessels and cover the exposed brain with
skin.</TE>
<TE>   An international medical charity, Healing the Children, paid to
fly the twins and their mother to Los Angeles and persuaded UCLA
physicians to perform the surgery. The doctors donated their
services.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA hopes to recoup the cost of the twins' care, estimated at
$1.5 million, through donations to a fund set up in the sisters'
names.</TE>
<TE>   Donations to UCLA should be made payable to the UCLA Foundation
and mailed to UCLA Medical Sciences Development, 10945 Le Conte Ave.,
Suite 3132, Los Angeles, CA 90095. Donations for the twins should go
to Healing the Children, Box 221478, Newhall, CA 91322.</TE>

<HD>'Dirty Bombs' Drop Dilemma on West</HD>
<DH>Moral and other questions encircle this new threat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM COHEN</AU>
<BD>Sam Cohen is a retired nuclear weapons analyst who
invented the neutron bomb concept.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The United States nabbed a U.S.-born citizen who converted to Islam,
joined Al Qaeda and, so the government claims, plotted to attack the
U.S. with a primitive radioactive device--a high explosive encased in
a radioactive shell that upon detonation would spread radioactivity
over a limited but densely populated area.</LD>
<LD>   There are other ways that a terrorist state can cause the same--or
worse--mayhem.</LD>
<LD>   Iraq, for example, could deliver a specific radioactive
agent--produced in a simple, cheap nuclear fission reactor--via a
ballistic missile that deposited pinhead-size radioactive pellets
over a vastly larger area.</LD>
<TE>   Not only is this diabolical scheme technically simple, but there
are no international treaties forbidding or constraining it. (Nuclear
arms control treaties have focused solely on nuclear explosives.)</TE>
<TE>   There would be no massive urban devastation and no long-lasting
contamination. The purpose would be to force the evacuation of a city
for weeks or months, with no significant level of casualties. The aim
would not be to destroy the city and kill its inhabitants, as
happened to Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</TE>
<TE>   Unless the offensive missile is attacked before the radioactive
pellets are released into a certain pattern, the effectiveness of the
radioactive material is virtually assured. The pellets will float
toward the surface and will be invulnerable to defensive "kill"
mechanisms.</TE>
<TE>   Such a strategic radiological attack is greatly more moral than
the primitive Nagasaki-type fission bombs that Iraq purportedly has
been building.</TE>
<TE>   During the Persian Gulf War, Iraq attacked Israel with a number of
short-range Scud ballistic missiles armed with large payloads of high
explosives. Not much damage was done, and Israel was pressured by the
U.S. to not retaliate in any form.</TE>
<TE>   Now let's suppose that sometime soon, in response to U.S. military
actions, Iraq conducts radiological attacks on Israeli cities. This
could be provocative for Israel and would pose the problem as to
whether it should use its high-yield nuclear weapons against Iraq
regardless of possible U.S. (and international) objections.</TE>
<TE>   From a moral standpoint, would the temporary evacuation of Tel
Aviv justify the obliteration of Baghdad?</TE>
<TE>   Resolving such a dilemma in advance would be hideously complex and
perhaps not even possible, but nevertheless this is a matter that
should receive the most serious consideration.</TE>

<HD>A Relationship With Bite</HD>
<DH>After so many betrayals, Kurds will be cautious about deals
with the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN McKIERNAN</AU>
<BD>Kevin McKiernan produced the PBS documentary "Good
Kurds, Bad Kurds."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a Kurdish proverb that warns that someone who has been bitten
by a snake will "always be careful of rope." That's good advice for
the State Department to remember as it opens strategy sessions today
in Washington with leaders of the Kurds and other Iraqi opposition
groups.</LD>
<LD>   The Kurds have been burned before and, of the groups invited to
Washington this week, only they have a military presence inside Iraq.
That fact is of considerable appeal to Pentagon planners hoping to
duplicate the United States' success with indigenous fighters in
Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Today, two rival factions, the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, rule an area in northern Iraq roughly
twice the size of Massachusetts. The region has been under Western
protection since 1991. With a combined army of 80,000 lightly armed
peshmerga ("those who face death"), the Kurdish troops might be
recruited as a new "Northern Alliance" in a ground campaign to unseat
Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<TE>   But this is not the first time the U.S. has encouraged the Kurds
to rise up against Baghdad, and many Kurds are wary of betrayal. "We
are not 'soldiers on demand' or 'custom-made revolutionaries,' "
Kurdistan Democratic Party leader Massoud Barzani told me in a recent
interview in northern Iraq. "We won't permit another sellout by the
United States," he declared, referring bitterly to the uprising
fomented in Iraq by the CIA in 1975 when it armed the Kurds through
the shah of Iran.</TE>
<TE>   As a favor to the shah, then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
secretly arranged for $16 million to bankroll a Kurdish uprising
against the Iraqi government. But the funding was a ploy, according
to a 1976 study by the House Select Committee on Intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the United States never wanted the Kurds to win, the
once-secret report said. Funding continued only until Kissinger
brokered a deal with Hussein to cut off support for the Kurds in
exchange for Iraqi land concessions to the shah.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq, knowing in advance that aid would be cut off, was able to
launch a decisive search-and-destroy campaign against the
unsuspecting Kurds only one day after the agreement was signed.</TE>
<TE>   Had the United States not encouraged the Kurdish rebellion, the
House report said, "The insurgents may have reached an accommodation
with the central government, thus gaining at least a measure of
autonomy while avoiding further bloodshed."</TE>
<TE>   The Kurds, as another of their old sayings goes, had no friends
but the mountains.</TE>
<TE>   The Nixon administration refused to extend humanitarian assistance
to the refugees it had helped to create, and Iran forcibly returned
about 40,000 Kurds to Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Declassified State Department cables from the period reveal that
U.S. agents protested the sudden abandonment of the Kurdish allies.
Kissinger dismissed such concerns. According to the House report, he
remarked to a staff member at the time, "Covert action should not be
confused with missionary work."</TE>
<TE>   The leader of the abortive 1975 uprising was Massoud Barzani's
father, Mulla Mustafa Barzani. When the elder Barzani died in exile
in a Washington hospital four years later, Massoud was at his side. I
asked the younger Barzani what advice his father had given him at the
time. "The biggest shock of his life," the younger Barzani said, "was
betrayal by the U.S. He told me to be cautious."</TE>
<TE>   The Kurds bring to Washington bitter memories of what followed the
CIA debacle.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, Hussein's army destroyed 4,000 Kurdish villages,
killing or "disappearing" 200,000 Kurds.</TE>
<TE>   There seemed to be no stopping Hussein. But even after he ordered
the chemical attack that killed 5,000 Kurdish civilians in the city
of Halabja, the White House refused to support trade sanctions
against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   There is also the sad chapter in Kurdish history following the
Gulf War in 1991, when the elder President Bush exhorted Iraqis to
rise up against the dictator.</TE>
<TE>   The Kurds took the cue, but they found themselves abandoned, their
hasty rebellion crushed by Hussein without interference from the
West. More than 1.5 million Kurds fled to the mountains of Iran and
Turkey; thousands died.</TE>
<TE>   Today, many see a "golden era" in Iraqi Kurdistan. The economy of
the Kurdish region is good, people have jobs, the shops are full of
imported products. There are Internet cafes, satellite TV stations
and cellular telephones. There is a respectable court system
alongside ministries of health, education and transportation. In
short, the Kurds have far more at risk now than the Northern Alliance
did before U.S. bombs started falling in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The Kurds may be willing to partner with America again, but this
time they are demanding a "transparent"--not covert--guarantee that
they won't be left holding the bag.</TE>
<TE>   They want protection against reprisals from Baghdad, which could
include chemical attacks. They also need to believe that if Hussein
is overthrown, he won't be replaced with an ex-general or some other
autocrat.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Kurds enlist in a new uprising, the U.S. will have to
convince them they will play a genuine and significant role in a
post-war Iraq.</TE>

<HD>Yes, He's a Retread, but Gore Could Roll to Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD>James P. Pinkerton writes a column for Newsday in New
York. E-mail: pinkerto@ix.netcom.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Does Al Gore have a chance against George W. Bush in 2004? That was
the question on everyone's mind at the Democratic Leadership
Council's "national conversation" in New York City last week. Answer:
Maybe Gore has a pretty good chance.</LD>
<LD>   Democratic insiders are not overly fond of the former vice
president; most would be happy if he went back to Harvard. But
they're sort of stuck with him. Why? Because for the last two years,
Democratic pols have kept their party faithful whipped up by
proclaiming that Bush &amp; Co. "stole" Florida and the 2000 election
from Gore.</LD>
<LD>   That guaranteed cheer line encourages Democratic rank-and-filers
to think that Gore deserves another shot at Bush. Indeed, according
to the latest available poll numbers, from Zogby International, Gore
leads the Democratic 2004 presidential primary field with 41% of
likely Democratic voters. The runner-up, with 6%, is Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman (D-Conn.), who has said he won't run if it means going
against his 2000 ticket-mate.</LD>
<TE>   Tied for third place on the Democrats' primary preference list, at
5% each, are a number of Democrats, including the Rev. Al Sharpton.
Which is to say, with the nominating campaign just 18 months away,
Gore doesn't have a single credible rival.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the New York Times' decision to give the ex-veep a plum
spot on its Sunday op-ed page was a major step forward in his
comeback. The article was standard Gorespeak, including his hint-hint
conclusion that "a major correction is needed in the course of our
nation."</TE>
<TE>   Former Clinton White House aide Maria Echaveste had to admit to
CNN's "Inside Politics" that Gore's article was "a campaign speech, a
defense of 2000 and also a defense, I think, of 2004." Still, the
placement of the piece spoke volumes about the Democratic
establishment's opening its heart yet again to the former vice
president.</TE>
<TE>   Most Republicans figure that if Gore could not win in 2000 with
the benefit of incumbency, he is not going to turn around and defeat
an incumbent president two years hence. Indeed, the most recent 2004
general election matchup poll, taken by Bloomberg News, showed Bush
beating Gore, 56% to 32%.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the polls also show a softening in the president's support. As
the respected Washington analyst Charlie Cook wrote Tuesday, Bush's
approval rating has fallen to 65%, down from the high 80s right after
Sept. 11. Yes, the Texan was still above the historical average
presidential approval rating of 56%, but a closer look at the
"internals" of the poll showed distinct weakness; his "strongly
approve" rating, for instance, has fallen to just 32%.</TE>
<TE>   But isn't Gore just a retread? Sure, he is. But oftentimes in
American history--most of the time, in fact--the retread wins the
rematch. There have been six presidential campaign double-headers,
and in four of those, the loser in the first contest was the winner
in the second contest.</TE>
<TE>   But what about the war on terror--most obviously, a crusade
against Iraq? Wouldn't an "October surprise"--an election-eve attack,
as imagined in the 1997 movie "Wag the Dog"--help Bush by rallying
Americans 'round the flag and to the Republican banner? John
Podhoretz, a pro-Bush hawk writing for the New York Post, was
alarmingly blunt on July 16: "Go on, Mr. President, wag the dog."</TE>
<TE>   But cynical movies and even more cynical pundits notwithstanding,
an Iraq attack might not work out well for the GOP. War, even
victorious war, often boomerangs politically.</TE>
<TE>   James Polk triumphed over Mexico in 1846-47 yet did not seek
reelection in 1848, and his party lost the White House. Democrat
Woodrow Wilson led America to victory in World War I and still his
party was clobbered in 1918 midterm elections, and he lost the White
House in a landslide two years later. And Bush's own father, the 41st
president, won a smashing victory over Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War and
yet lost the presidency in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   The lesson seems to be that the American people don't really like
war. What they want is peace and prosperity. And if Bush can't
deliver both, the voters will be looking for an alternative in
2004--even Al Gore.</TE>

<HD>Stop Your Grousing, Auto Makers, and Get the Gases Out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL ZICHELLA</AU>
<BD>Carl Zichella is the regional staff director of the
California-Nevada-Hawaii field office of the Sierra Club.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The auto industry howled when Gov. Gray Davis signed California's
landmark global warming control bill. Litigation to overturn the new
law, which restricts automobile emissions of carbon dioxide and other
so-called greenhouse gases, was threatened before his signature was
dry.</LD>
<LD>   For auto industry observers, there was a sense of deja vu about
this hysterical response. Every time the government has required new
safety or efficiency standards, auto makers have claimed that the
result would be financial ruin, the elimination of thousands of jobs
and the loss of consumer choice.</LD>
<LD>   The truth is that the industry was wrong at every turn, and it is
wrong now. Car makers, instead of suing to overturn this much-needed
law, should get busy complying with it. No new technology needs to be
developed.</LD>
<TE>   This is the industry that fought turn signals, seat belts and
safety glass. Henry Ford II called laminated windshields, padded
interiors and collapsible steering wheels "unreasonable, arbitrary
and technically unfeasible."</TE>
<TE>   When Congress required auto manufacturers to build cleaner cars in
1973, the industry response was hyperbolic. "If GM is forced to
introduce catalytic converter systems across the board ... it is
conceivable that complete stoppage of the entire production could
occur," warned a GM vice president. The company easily complied,
consumers benefited and GM suffered no appreciable hardship.</TE>
<TE>   In 1974, a Ford official told a congressional committee that
"corporate average fuel economy"--CAFE--standards would "result in a
Ford product line consisting either of all sub-Pinto-sized vehicles
or some mix of vehicles ranging from sub-sub-compact to perhaps a
Maverick." That couldn't have been more wrong.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Rocky Mountain Institute, from 1977 to 1983
American-built cars increased in efficiency by seven miles per
gallon. From 1977 through 1985, the U.S. gross domestic product rose
27% while oil imports fell by 42%. OPEC lost an eighth of its market.
Few public policies have ever been such a resounding success. Vehicle
choice expanded while oil prices declined.</TE>
<TE>   The sky isn't falling for auto manufacturers, but the planet is
getting warmer, and the consequences for California are severe. If
the snowpack in the Sierra declines, bitter competition for water
will result since about 70% of California drinking water originates
there.</TE>
<TE>   Further, farmland will become more arid and sea levels will rise,
reducing food production and flooding coastal cities. Forests will
shrink and some of the most valuable wildlife habitat on Earth will
vanish or be altered.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that some simple solutions are at hand. This year
Ford sponsored a "Future Truck" competition for university
engineering students to build more-efficient sport utility vehicles.
If you believe the industry's rhetoric, you'd think that SUVs will be
abolished. But Ford's "Future Truck" contestants showed the
ridiculousness of this charge.</TE>
<TE>   Students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison this year modified
a Ford Explorer to get the equivalent of 38 mpg. Others built a GMC
Suburban that emits about half the carbon dioxide of the production
version. More-efficient vehicles mean less CO2 emissions. You don't
need to require mileage standards--something that federal law forbids
the state to do--to get these benefits; all the state needs to do is
require the auto makers use the best technology available.</TE>
<TE>   If university students can do this, why can't the Big Three? Ford
boasts that it plans to introduce a hybrid gas-electric SUV in 2003.
This model would meet the standard far ahead of the new law's
generous 2009 deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of suing California, auto makers should do what is right
and comply with the law.</TE>

<LD>As the Bush administration weighs various plans for toppling Saddam
Hussein, European allies are becoming increasingly jittery. Last
week, President Bush repeated his determination to oust Hussein but
Wednesday showed welcome signs of temperance, saying he will be
"patient and deliberate" and consult with Congress and "friends and
allies."</LD>
<LD>   Bush aides said he was only restating policy, but unless the
president really does give the allies more than lip service, he risks
splintering NATO over the most momentous issue it has faced since the
end of the Cold War.</LD>
<LD>   Already the issue of intervention has become the key issue in
Germany's September federal election. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder,
who is running against conservative challenger Bavaria Gov. Edmund
Stoiber, announced Monday that "we're not available for adventures,
and the time for checkbook diplomacy is over once and for all."</LD>
<TE>   In Britain, Prime Minister Tony Blair is coming under increased
pressure from within his own Labor Party to temper his support for
war; Tam Dalyell, a senior member of Parliament, is calling upon him
to recall Parliament from its summer recess to debate intervention.</TE>
<TE>   How concerned should the U.S. be? The European record in facing up
to tyrants--whether it was appeasing Hitler or, more recently,
Slobodan Milosevic--is nothing to boast about. Passivity and
hand-wringing have been the hallmark of European governments. But the
questions they are raising are not unreasonable. These questions are,
in fact, similar to those put forth by cautionary voices in the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   Many hawks close to the administration, such as former CIA
Director R. James Woolsey and former Pentagon official Richard Perle,
dismiss the Europeans as little more than wimps and maintain that the
U.S. can do the job by itself. But the value of having the European
allies on board should not be underestimated. A unilateral American
action would set a dangerous precedent for India, China or Russia to
launch their own wars. There are also immediate practical advantages:
Should a war be successfully concluded, European peacekeepers could
help reconstruct Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The war on terror can be prosecuted much more effectively with the
allies than against them. If Bush truly believes that Hussein must be
removed, he needs to make the case not only at home but abroad.</TE>

<HD>The Troubling Saudi Factor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The discovery that 15 of the 19 hijackers Sept. 11 were Saudi Arabian
was a shock to Americans who had seen the kingdom as a solid ally
despite its deep cultural differences with the United States. The
alliance remained after 9/11, but the U.S. view of the Saudis began
to shift. This week's disclosure that a briefing for a Pentagon
advisory board called the kingdom an adversary of the United States
and a backer of terrorism strains the ties even more. The Bush
administration hurried to distance itself from the comments and
reassure the Saudis. But that doesn't mean either nation can entirely
dismiss the harsh views in the briefing, given by a Rand Corp.
analyst.</LD>
<TE>   The analyst, Laurent Murawiec, told the civilian Defense Policy
Board that "Saudi Arabia supports our enemies and attacks our allies"
and is "the kernel of evil, the prime mover, the most dangerous
opponent" in the Mideast. Those statements are 180 degrees from the
long-standing policy of the U.S. government, but they do reflect the
beliefs of a number of influential conservatives. The Defense Policy
Board, which advises the Defense Department, consists of former
government officials including Henry A. Kissinger, who, according to
the Washington Post, disagreed with the analysis. The briefing said
that if the Saudis did not do more to crack down on terrorism, their
oil fields and overseas financial assets should be "targeted." What
that would amount to was not specified.</TE>
<TE>   A Western diplomat in Saudi Arabia said recently that both Riyadh
and Washington had high-level diplomats trying to hold the
relationship together at a troubling time. The diplomat acknowledged
that there was some "cultish feeling" among Saudis for Osama bin
Laden as a man who forsook vast wealth to fight Soviet invaders in
Afghanistan. The envoy also said the Saudi government, which stripped
Bin Laden of his citizenship several years before the attack on the
World Trade Center, had tried to preach a message of "tolerance and
moderation" to its subjects since Sept. 11. That message needs much
repeating.</TE>
<TE>   The Saudi government views itself not just as a civil authority
but as a custodian of the holy places of Islam, the religion that
began on the Arabian peninsula. There are different brands of Islam
just as there are different branches of Christianity. The Wahhabi
school of Islam, which dominates Saudi Arabia and arose there, is the
most conservative and the one often taught abroad in Islamic schools
financed by the Saudis. In countries such as Malaysia and Turkey, a
more moderate form of Islam is practiced.</TE>
<TE>   The United States should press for a reexamination of Saudi
religious schools to ensure they are not nurturing future terrorism.
Although it is wrong to blame Sept. 11 on religion, it is reasonable
to ask why so many hijackers came from one country. Saudi leaders owe
it to the 9/11 victims to seek answers instead of brushing aside that
painful fact.</TE>

<LD>The Colorado River is running at a relative trickle this drought
year. Once-foaming white rapids in some sections are dribbles. The
Rocky Mountain snowpack that recreates the river every year was scant
last spring. Colorado and other states are understandably stepping up
pressure on California to begin cutting back its excessive use of the
river's water.</LD>
<LD>   California has less than five months to put its water thrift plan
in place or face a dramatic cutback by the Department of the
Interior. The department has warned state government water officials
and the directors of the giant urban and agricultural water districts
every year that they have to find ways to reduce their take of the
Colorado River by enough to meet the annual household needs of 1.6
million families.</LD>
<LD>   For years, the other Colorado River states didn't mind
California's excess use, since they weren't using their full
allocations and there was a surplus.</LD>
<TE>   And California did develop a plan to meet its Colorado River limit
over 15 years. A key to it was a deal in which the San Diego County
Water Authority would buy about 200,000 acre-feet a year from the
Imperial Irrigation District, which has its own sources of water; the
accord called for farmers to be paid to fallow their land. That
agreement is falling apart, but the need to cut back remains.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Interior Secretary Bennett Raley is under increasing
pressure from the other states to cut California's take of the river
if the state fails to meet a Dec. 31 deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes it seems like every drop of water in the Southwest is
spoken for more than once. For instance, the farmers of the Imperial
Water District currently dump the runoff from their irrigation into
the Salton Sea. Though the runoff is polluted, it is relatively fresh
for the super-salty, desolate Salton Sea and keeps it from dying for
lack of new water. If farmers fallow the land so they can sell their
water allotment to San Diego at a handsome price, the runoff will
cease and the district might have to pay millions of dollars to
mitigate the damage to the Salton Sea.</TE>
<TE>   Saving the Salton should not be put on the backs of the Imperial
Valley farmers and should not be allowed to stop this water trade.</TE>
<TE>   To see a real environmental catastrophe, imagine urban Southern
California suffering an immediate cut of more than half its Colorado
River water supply. Picture brown gardens, empty swimming pools,
unflushed toilets, zero development and high-technology companies
fleeing.</TE>
<TE>   State and federal governments can help by assuring farmers they
won't be held responsible for the fate of the Salton Sea. Then both
sides should sign the deal without quibbling.</TE>

<LD>Re "Church Can't Back Abuse Settlement, Cardinal Law Tells Judge,"
Aug. 3: Cardinal Bernard Law is, as usual, a bit late. When he
testified that the Archdiocese of Boston might face bankruptcy if it
followed through on the terms of the settlement agreement, Law failed
to see that the archdiocese was already bankrupt. It bankrupted
itself when it tolerated and assisted the predatory behavior of Paul
Shanley and John Geoghan. It bankrupted itself when it treated the
survivors of sexual abuse as a legal problem, rather than as people
who deserve love, compassion and support.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Law raises the specter of bankruptcy and parses legal
details. The Archdiocese of Boston has no shortage of assets. If it
wanted to make good on the settlement, it could devise a way.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Law scurries for cover behind the details of the legal
system. If he had shown this much attention to legal niceties many
years ago--when he was first confronted with the behavior of
pedophile priests under his supervision--he would not need to search
for legal cover now.</LD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Your Aug. 6 editorial, "Secrecy vs. the Republic," addressed only
part of the violation of rights committed by our Justice Department.
We the people do need to know the names of those jailed after the
9/11 attacks. We also need to protest in favor of the constitutional
rights that prohibit their detention without due process. This point
was driven home to me during a discussion at the Manzanar exhibit at
the Japanese-American National Museum last Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   One of the survivors of the camp and I bemoaned the fact that the
violations of U.S. law based on racial profiling that led to that
camp were being used today against Arabs living in our country, many
of whom are U.S. citizens. Let's not destroy our democracy in an
attempt to save it.</LD>

<TE>   Re "U.S. Ordered to Disclose Names of Detainees in Sept. 11
Inquiry," Aug. 3: I commend U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler's
ruling that the Justice Department may not keep the names of
detainees secret "in the interest of national security." Remember,
the approximately 73 individuals still being detained have not even
been charged with committing a crime.</TE>
<TE>   Kessler was absolutely correct in noting that secret arrests are
odious to a democratic society. So are Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft's
concept of justice and President Bush's insistence on secrecy in
developing policies that affect the lives of us all.</TE>

<TE>   Kessler's ordering of the Justice Department to release the names
of the Middle Eastern and South Asian persons who were taken into
custody after Sept. 11 came just a day after Duane Noriyuki's
poignant July 31 article describing the experience of some Japanese
Americans who were detained at Manzanar during World War II. Of the
1,182 people Ashcroft says were detained, 73 remained in custody as
of mid-June. According to your story, the Justice Department concedes
that "few if any being held had direct complicity in, or knowledge
of, the Sept. 11 attacks" and says that they are being detained
because they violated immigration laws and should be deported. There
was no mention in any of this of due process of law for the
detainees.</TE>
<TE>   The presidentially appointed commission that investigated the
incarceration of Japanese Americans, which resulted in the apology
signed by former President Bush and $20,000 to each internee,
concluded in its report that the incarceration was the result of war
hysteria, racial prejudice and a failure of political leadership.
Does any of this sound familiar today, relating to how our government
deals with those protected by our Constitution? If the Manzanar
Historical Monument exhibit does not cause Americans to resolve not
to allow Manzanars to occur again, our efforts are in vain.</TE>

<LD>Twenty years ago I would have agreed with the sentiment behind "Limit
Wilderness Roads" (editorial, Aug. 3). But these days I believe that
some environmental organizations and The Times are completely out of
touch with what should be considered "wilderness." I, too, do not
want to see the development, mining or logging of many of these
remote areas, but I do believe many of the areas where roads already
exist should have remained open to all forms of recreation. Long ago,
it seems, the tide changed from protecting sensitive and unique
wilderness areas to just flat-out denying motorized access to large
portions of public land in the West.</LD>
<LD>   The areas where off-road vehicles are still allowed are completely
over-impacted. And then I see areas that have been closed to motor
vehicles, particularly in the deserts, that are no longer being
enjoyed by anybody--no hikers, no equestrians, nobody. Why are these
lands being "saved" from motor vehicles when no one else wants to
visit them?</LD>

<HD>Flag of St. George Rises Over Union Jack</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It now appears that the British are as ignorant of their own history
as we Yanks ("St. George Usurps Union Jack as Flag of Choice in a
More English Britain," Aug. 4). The original Union Jack, which
consisted of the Cross of St. George for England superimposed on the
Cross of St. Andrew for Scotland, was introduced after the accession
of King James VI of Scotland to the throne of England as King James I
in 1606. It symbolized that the two realms were equal--a
multicultural statement if ever there was one. The Cross of St.
Patrick, which represents Ireland and is not even mentioned in your
article, was added in 1801 as a sign that Ireland was also equal to
the others, especially after the abortive United Irish independence
movement had called attention to English abuses there.</LD>
<LD>   There is nothing wrong with displaying English pride by showing
the colors of St. George, but the flag shouldn't be thought of as a
multicultural emblem in opposition to the Union Jack any more than
the flag of California should be considered a multicultural symbol in
opposition to the flag of the United States of America.</LD>
<LD>   James Warren</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was mildly amusing to read that the famous Union Jack flag of
the United Kingdom, once seen as a symbol of racist oppression, has
been usurped by the Cross of St. George. Evidently, the Cross of St.
George is now perceived as a show of support for multiculturalism and
also interpreted by some as a magical antidote to English (white)
racism.</TE>
<TE>   Oh that the pundits of radical racial division in this country
would accept the Cross of St. Andrew (the "Southern Cross") as a
symbol of multicultural unity instead of ethnic/cultural animosity.
Think of all the problems it would solve.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I've been involved in hospital trauma care for about 17 years. In
this time I've seen that about 70% of these cases are due to alcohol
use. I suggest putting an extra tax on alcohol instead of increasing
the property tax. After all, alcohol is one of the main factors, if
not the main factor, in these cases and, consequently, the hospitals'
expenses. Why punish the property owners instead?</LD>
<LD>   Mehmet H. Ozgur MD</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Raising taxes to subsidize trauma care is a bum idea ("County
Board Puts Measure to Fund Emergency Care on November Ballot," July
31). Sure, trauma care is the greatest show on Earth. But does it
make sense that teams of health professionals work round the clock to
save a few lives in trauma centers while elsewhere many die of
neglect and medical errors?</TE>
<TE>   We need genuine reform of the health-care system, not more public
money for a better show.</TE>

<LD>Re "Sugar and Spice and a Parent's Worst Fears," Commentary, Aug. 4:
In pondering John Balzar's commentary, my concerns for children reach
beyond their safety alone.</LD>
<LD>   As a second-grade teacher, I work with children who are generally
never able to explore their neighborhoods or play away from home
because of safety concerns and parents who work long hours. What I
see are children who are growing up playing video games and watching
TV during most of their free time. This limits the development of
creative imagination. It frequently has a stifling effect on a
child's academic growth, as the child cannot envision the world
beyond his or her residence and a display screen.</LD>
<LD>   Children need to be free to explore their environment--to watch
ants carry food to their holes, to lie on the grass and look up at
clouds, to play with and admire the simple elements in the world
around them. If our children are not allowed the opportunity to do
these simple activities, they do not develop a wholesome curiosity
about a vast, wonderful world of possibilities. The loss of such
creative thinking abilities will most likely inhibit our country's
future success.</LD>

<LD>Joe Loya's "Keating and Me" (Opinion, Aug. 4) brought back memories
of Mike, a neighbor of ours in my parents' working-class Chicago
neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   Before Mike became an accomplished, hard-working electrician he
did some hard time for armed robbery. One day he asked if I'd like to
meet some of his friends. We parked the car in an alley on the Near
West Side, entered a garage that housed only a large, round oak table
lit by a single bulb peeking out of a green glass shade. Five or six
men were playing poker. It was as if I had stepped into an Edward
Hopper painting.</LD>
<LD>   On the trip back to our apartment building, Mike advised me to
stay away from losers, saying: "Kid, crime doesn't pay. I should
know. But if you're gonna steal, steal big."</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>David S. Cunningham III, the lone Los Angeles police commissioner to
go against the mayor who appointed him and vote to give Bernard C.
Parks a second term as chief, was reappointed to the commission
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Cunningham said he wondered whether Mayor James K. Hahn would back
him again after the vote on Parks. The fact he was renominated "says
that Mayor Hahn is really a man of his word ... that when a
commissioner chooses to exercise independent judgment, he or she is
not penalized for doing that," said Cunningham, 47, a land-use
attorney.</LD>
<LD>   In confirming Cunningham for a five-year term, council members
praised him for his independence--a quality that Councilwoman Ruth
Galanter called "a little too rare" in city government.</LD>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the mayor appoints and fires police commissioners,
but the panel is intended to be independent. It operates like a
company's board of directors, with the police chief as chief
executive.</TE>
<TE>   The Police Commission is now working on finding a replacement for
Parks.</TE>

<HD>Family Files Wrongful Death Lawsuit in Cocaine Overdose of
Woman, 25</HD>
<DH>Courts: The defendant, who is an L.A. lawyer, denies
allegations that he delayed seeking medical help at Montecito hotel
until it was too late.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Erika Balogh, 25, was dead of a cocaine overdose for several hours
before her married lover, a successful Los Angeles litigator, sought
medical help at their Montecito hotel, according to a wrongful death
lawsuit filed by her family in Santa Barbara County Superior Court.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Barbara County coroner has ruled Balogh's Jan. 16 death
from "acute cocaine toxicity" accidental.</LD>
<LD>   But prosecutors said they are still reviewing the police
investigation reports and have not decided if criminal charges will
be filed, Deputy Dist. Atty. Hilary M. Dozer said Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   Balogh's mother and twin sister, residents of the Santa Clarita
Valley, are suing attorney Keith B. Bardellini, who at the time of
Balogh's death was in the Santa Barbara area on business for the Los
Angeles law firm of Buchalter, Nemer, Fields &amp; Younger, where he was
an equity partner.</TE>
<TE>   In the lawsuit filed last week, Balogh's relatives alleged that
Bardellini, of Pacific Palisades, provided Balogh with illegal drugs,
and then when she overdosed, failed to seek medical attention to try
to save her life until it was too late.</TE>
<TE>   They are seeking unspecified actual and punitive damages. The case
has been assigned to Santa Barbara County Superior Court Judge James
W. Brown.</TE>
<TE>   "In my judgment, when you put someone in harm's way, you have an
obligation to help them," said the family's attorney, Richard G.
Tarlow of Calabasas.</TE>
<TE>   Bardellini, 49, now a partner at the Los Angeles firm of Blecher &amp;
Collins, denied the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   "I am outraged that anyone would suggest without any factual
backup that I would engage in such morally reprehensible conduct," he
said. "It is inconceivable to me that anyone would ignore a person in
medical distress, and I did not do so."</TE>
<TE>   Bardellini said there is no evidence to show that he knew Balogh
was in medical distress and failed to act.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a classic example of the tort system in California that
encourages plaintiffs' lawyers to make allegations that are
sensational and at the same time provide the basis of a lawsuit
without any concern about the lives that they are destroying in the
process," he said. "The memory of this beautiful woman is clearly
tarnished by this lawsuit."</TE>
<TE>   Balogh's relatives--mother Erzsebet Horvat and sister Eva
Balogh--also are suing the Montecito Inn for failing to respond to a
complaint about excessive noise coming from Balogh and Bardellini's
hotel room earlier that morning, when Tarlow alleges that Bardellini
realized Balogh was dead or dying and failed to act, according to the
lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel's manager, Danny Copus, said his staff was not negligent
in any way. He said they were unaware of the noise complaint until
the guests in the room next to Balogh and Bardellini's told hotel
personnel about it when they checked out at noon.</TE>
<TE>   By then, Copus said, it was hours later and the police had arrived
at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Bardellini met Balogh two years earlier when he represented
Balogh's live-in boyfriend in a business litigation matter, and they
began an intimate relationship, according to the lawsuit. Balogh
accompanied Bardellini, who is married and has two children, on
business trips outside of Los Angeles, the suit says.</TE>
<TE>   The suit alleges that on the evening of Jan. 15, Balogh and
Bardellini had a late dinner at the Montecito Inn, then retired to
their hotel room, where they indulged in illicit drugs and sex.</TE>
<TE>   Between 6 and 8 the next morning, Bardellini awoke and found
Balogh unconscious in their bed. About the same time, the suit
alleges, another hotel guest reportedly heard a man in Bardellini's
room scream repeatedly, "Why don't you get up!"</TE>
<TE>   After trying to wake Balogh, Bardellini showered, dressed and left
the hotel, arriving at a 9 a.m. deposition in the Montecito area at
11:45 a.m., according to the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to the hotel about 1:30 p.m. and asked hotel staff to
request medical help because "his wife was having trouble breathing,"
the suit says.</TE>
<TE>   Balogh, who was found on the bed, covered by a sheet, was
pronounced dead at 1:32 p.m., with authorities estimating she had
died six to 12 hours earlier, according to the coroner's report.</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. Phil Willis, a spokesman for the Santa Barbara County
Sheriff-Coroner's Department, said the exact time of death could not
be determined because the windows were open and the temperature of
the room was below 65 degrees when they arrived. Cocaine ingestion
also makes it more difficult to determine a precise time of death, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Balogh, a tall blond with blue eyes, was born in Romania and
emigrated to the United States as a child. She graduated from Taft
High School and attended Pierce College in Woodland Hills and Cal
State Northridge, Tarlow said.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of her death, she was enrolled at Sonoma State and
wanted to become an attorney.</TE>

<HD>Judge Backs Lynwood in Suit Over Billboard Fees</HD>
<DH>Court: A pact the ex-mayor's sister had with the city is
ruled invalid. She says she was owed up to $2 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TED ROHRLICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sister of former Lynwood Mayor Paul Richards has lost a court
decision in her bid to collect up to $2 million she says the city
owes her for negotiating a billboard contract on its behalf.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Emilie Elias dismissed
Paula Harris' lawsuit, which had asked the court to force the city to
arbitrate her claim.</LD>
<LD>   Although Harris' contract with the city contained an arbitration
clause, Elias ruled that the contract was invalid. Elias made the
ruling Aug. 1, but lawyers in the case received it in the mail this
week.</LD>
<TE>   Richards voted last year to award a no-bid contract to his sister
that called for her to receive a 20% commission on any billboard deal
she negotiated. At the time he voted to hire her, Richards had one
such deal with Regency Outdoor Advertising already in the works,
correspondence shows. That deal, which was finalized under Harris'
auspices, was similar to the one Regency proposed to Richards.
Regency was to pay the city up to $5 million for the right to erect a
dozen signs on city property along the Century Freeway. The city then
would pay Harris up to $1 million as a commission.</TE>
<TE>   That arrangement was imperiled in November when Richards won
reelection but lost an ally who had given him a three-vote City
Council majority. The new majority, led by Richards' replacement as
mayor, Arturo Reyes, voted to cancel Harris' contract as well as the
Regency deal.</TE>
<TE>   Harris filed a claim against the city, demanding payment of the $1
million she said she was owed for the Regency deal and another $1
million she believed that she would have had an opportunity to make
through other deals. Regency also has threatened to sue.</TE>
<TE>   Elias ruled that Harris' contract was invalid because her brother,
while mayor, failed to sign it. The city manager signed it instead.
But the judge said the Richards-led City Council had told the city
manager only to negotiate a deal with Harris, not to sign one. That,
the judge said, would have required a separate action.</TE>
<TE>   City Atty. Michael Montgomery, who was hired by the new council
majority, said Wednesday that "it was just poorly done. They got the
wrong person to sign it."</TE>
<TE>   But he said he believes that he would have been able to challenge
the contract successfully anyway as a deal that lacked public
benefit.</TE>
<TE>   Harris' attorney, Rickey Ivie, said she will appeal. This is only
the "first round," he said.</TE>

<HD>Wealthy Residents Urge Higher Taxes on Rich</HD>
<DH>Budget: Group says state needs the money to balance this
year's and future spending plans and preserve vital services like
health care.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>It's a rare day when people ask the government to tax them more, but
that's exactly what dozens of California's wealthiest residents are
urging state leaders to do as a battle heats up over a new state
budget.</LD>
<LD>   Concerned about proposed trims to health care and other vital
services, 88 of California's high-income earners, including actors Ed
Asner and Richard Lewis, are releasing a letter today asking Gov.
Gray Davis and legislative leaders to reinstate top income-tax
brackets to help balance this year's budget and future ones.</LD>
<LD>   "This is about the devastation to needed services in the state and
thinking about something other than your own wallet," said signatory
Roy Ulrich, a Santa Monica attorney and president of the California
Tax Reform Assn.</LD>
<TE>   "It makes me sleep better at night," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If revenue is not found to reverse proposed cuts, Ulrich warned,
all Californians will be affected.</TE>
<TE>   "We may be separated by neighborhoods, but we are not separated in
terms of a failed health-care system," he said. "We all use trauma-
care centers."</TE>
<TE>   The letter comes as Democrats who control the Assembly struggle to
pass a $99-billion spending package that cleared the state Senate on
June 29.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans are blocking the plan due to its reliance on more than
$4 billion in new taxes and revenue, in part by raising the state
cigarette tax to $3 per pack.</TE>
<TE>   The tax package failed to clear the Assembly on Wednesday on a
50-20 vote after several hours of particularly bombastic oratory.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Assemblyman Ken Maddox (R-Garden Grove) compared the
budget to a giant mosquito carrying the West Nile virus.</TE>
<TE>   To balance the spending plan, Davis and his fellow Democrats have
proposed a combination of new taxes, spending cuts, borrowing and
fund transfers.</TE>
<TE>   Their approach is similar to one used by former Gov. Pete Wilson
when he faced a $14-billion hole during the recession of the early
1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Even with those steps, state analysts predict that California will
face five more years of shortfalls.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblywoman Helen Thomson (D-Davis) is among the Assembly
Democrats who have publicly supported taxing top earners to prevent
health-care programs and other key state services from being
diminished.</TE>
<TE>   "To make the kinds of cuts that Republicans are proposing we would
have so little left in terms of health care, parks and education,"
Thomson said.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't need to make such draconian cuts that it puts California
behind such states as Missouri and Georgia," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) previously proposed
increasing the highest individual tax brackets from 9.3% by adding
10% and 11% brackets.</TE>
<TE>   Estimates of the revenue that would be generated by his plan range
from $2.7 billion to $3.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The Burton plan died, however, after it failed to garner the
single Republican vote necessary to pass the budget out of the
Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who believes that the state has become too reliant on
personal income tax revenues, also opposes the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, advocates for the poor have continued to push for
higher taxes on the rich.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Wright, organizing director of the health-reform group
Health Access, said proposed cuts have put access to health insurance
for hundreds of thousands of Californians at risk in addition to
hospitals and trauma centers.</TE>

removing as many as 90 exotic cars that authorities believe are
associated with a large-scale methamphetamine manufacturing and
money-laundering scheme.</LD>
<LD>   Police said the raid on the Auto Market in the 2100 block of
Harbor Boulevard was one of several carried out simultaneously in
Orange and Los Angeles counties and the Inland Empire as officers
served 15 search warrants and made a dozen arrests.</LD>
<LD>   It was unclear if any of the arrests were made in Costa Mesa,
although Mike Angel, the Auto Market's manager, said that owner Nader
Amirvand had been taken in for questioning.</LD>
<TE>   "We're very shocked," Angel said from an El Taco parking lot next
door as TV helicopters hovered. "They have no evidence of anything."</TE>
<TE>   The Riverside County Sheriff's Department issued a press release
Wednesday evening describing the raids as the culmination of a
two-year investigation that included many electronic wiretaps and
surveillance operations. The department said the investigation
resulted in 28 indictments by the San Bernardino district attorney's
office and that county's grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big bust," said Jose Martinez, a special agent with the
federal Drug Enforcement Administration, which participated in the
raids.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to hauling off Lamborghinis, Mercedes, Jaguars,
Ferraris, Porsches and Bentleys--some worth several hundred thousand
dollars apiece--police at the locations confiscated many weapons,
illegal drugs and cash estimated at $400,000. The Riverside County
Sheriff's Department said it would hold a news conference at 11 a.m.
today, at which officers would display the items seized and name the
suspects arrested.</TE>
<TE>   The Costa Mesa raid, Angel said, began about 9 a.m., when
investigators with a search warrant asked employees to stay behind
police tape as computers, paperwork and the cars were hauled away.
The Auto Market, in business 18 years, was located in Fountain Valley
before moving to its current address two years ago.</TE>

<HD>Courthouse Child Center to Open</HD>
<DH>Long Beach: First such facility in L.A. County system
provides a safe waiting area.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY McCARTNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two years ago, Beverly Fancher spent an hour walking the five floors
of the Long Beach courthouse, counting children left unattended in
the hallways. She saw 60.</LD>
<LD>   Today, the first supervised Los Angeles County courthouse
child-care waiting area will open, giving parents who have to appear
in court a place to leave their children in comfort.</LD>
<LD>   The waiting room is a world apart from the courthouse corridors.
The former office has shelves filled with children's books, board
games, stuffed animals and Legos. At the center of the room is a Sony
PlayStation 2, something that has judges wanting to come to Room 101
between hearings.</LD>
<TE>   It has been redecorated to resemble an African rain forest, a
Middle Eastern palace and a Latin American street.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a humane and caring way to respond to the fact that children
are brought to courthouses for reasons beyond their control," said
Aviva Bobb, Los Angeles County's supervising judge of family law.</TE>
<TE>   "If you walk down the second floor of this building at 8:30 in the
morning, it's really heartbreaking to see these kids just milling
around," Bobb said.</TE>
<TE>   The waiting area can accommodate up to 20 children ages 13 and
under.</TE>
<TE>   Fancher's Long Beach-based nonprofit organization, For the Child,
will staff the room and provide referral information for parents who
need medical services or counseling.</TE>
<TE>   Each child will be given a book to take home, Fancher said.</TE>
<TE>   By law, any courthouse built or remodeled in California after 1999
must provide a children's waiting area. Several surrounding counties
already have courthouse waiting areas, and Los Angeles County plans
to add waiting areas to its Pomona, Compton, airport area, Van Nuys
and downtown courthouses by early 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach's waiting area is being paid for under a three-year,
$300,000 grant. The money comes from a 50-cent tax on cigarettes
approved in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Deborah Andrews said she has often seen parents with
children in strollers wheel them outside the courtroom before
testifying.</TE>
<TE>   For older children, Andrews said, providing a safe waiting area
also protects the child, who otherwise might have to sit in on a
domestic violence hearing in which both parents testify about a
beating the child may have witnessed.</TE>
<TE>   Two years after her head count of unattended children, Fancher
surveyed the new carpet, fresh paint and video games.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping the room neat is not a priority.</TE>
<TE>   "I just hope it will start looking used," she said.</TE>

<HD>Sex Exploited in Van Dam Trial, Attorneys Say</HD>
<DH>Court: Both sides focus on the recovered pornography and
the lifestyle of the slain girl's parents in their final statements.
The jury is set to take the case today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>As the trial of the man accused of killing 7-year-old Danielle van
Dam moved within a day of going to the jury, opposing attorneys
Wednesday exchanged bitter accusations about which side is exploiting
the issue of sex.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Dusek is slated to finish his rebuttal
argument today, and the case against David Westerfield should then be
presented to the six-man, six-woman jury after 27 days of courtroom
activity, testimony by 116 witnesses, and more media coverage than
any criminal case in San Diego County history.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the dueling accusations about sexual activity, the case
may be decided by which set of scientific experts the jury believes.
Dusek presented criminalists and DNA experts who say blood, hair and
fibers link Westerfield to the crime, while defense attorney Steven
Feldman called two insect experts who asserted that the bugs found on
Danielle's body show she was killed after Westerfield was being
watched continuously by police.</LD>
<TE>   In his closing argument, Feldman lashed out at Dusek for allegedly
trying to bias the jurors against Westerfield by showing them
pornographic pictures of children and then claiming that the pictures
prove that Westerfield harbored sexual fantasies about young girls.</TE>
<TE>   Several jurors began to weep Tuesday when Dusek showed them the
pictures, just as they had done when the pictures were  presented as
evidence by a police computer expert.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman said the question is not whether the pictures are
repugnant but whether--without any corroborating evidence--they prove
that Westerfield had sexual fantasies that led him to sneak into his
neighbors' home and kidnap their child.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that the vast bulk of the pornographic pictures on
Westerfield's computers were of adults, not children.</TE>
<TE>   "Gross? OK. Disgusting? OK. Inappropriate? OK. Enough to shock
you? OK. Enough to bias you against Mr. Westerfield? Definitely,"
Feldman said. "That was [the prosecutors'] plan. What they did was
take two or three images out of thousands and say this is a true and
accurate portrayal of Mr. Westerfield."</TE>
<TE>   But Dusek, in his rebuttal, said it was Feldman who was exploiting
sex as an issue in an untruthful way.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that in his opening statement weeks ago, Feldman
mentioned that Danielle's parents, Brenda and Damon, had used the
family garage to drink, smoke marijuana and engage in "risque sexual
behavior" and that their lifestyle contributed to Danielle's
disappearance and murder because it created an atmosphere in which
strangers could come and go.</TE>
<TE>   "He was feeding off whatever media you may have seen before this
trial began," Dusek said.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman, apologizing for his loud voice and emotional style, told
jurors not to be afraid to tell Superior Court Judge William Mudd if
they become deadlocked at 11 to 1 or 10 to 2. The sanctity of the
jury system is in your hands, Feldman said.</TE>
<TE>   "You're all that separates us from the Taliban," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dusek called Feldman's strategy "desperation, exaggeration, 'let
me hook one juror--just one.' "</TE>
<TE>   Along with murder and kidnapping charges, Westerfield also is
charged with misdemeanor possession of child pornography. Feldman had
sought to have that charge separated from the murder and kidnapping
case.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield, 50, a self-employed design engineer, did not testify
during the trial and sat impassively during the closing arguments,
occasionally taking notes. If he is convicted, the jury will then be
required to decide whether he should be executed or sentenced to life
in prison without parole.</TE>
<TE>   Danielle disappeared Feb. 2 from her parents' home. Her nude,
decomposing body was found Feb. 27 in a rural area.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield had been arrested Feb. 22 based on the discovery of
Danielle's blood, hair and fingerprints in his recreational vehicle.</TE>

<LD>More than 1,300 marijuana plants worth an estimated $4.6 million were
confiscated from an outdoor garden near the Siskiyou County community
of Happy Camp after they were spotted by a patrol flight, police
said.</LD>
<LD>   The 9-foot-tall plants were being watered by a drip irrigation
system and appeared to be managed by an experienced grower, according
to sheriff's deputies.</LD>
<LD>   No one was in the garden when police arrived, but there was
evidence that someone had been living on both Forest Service land and
private property in the Independence Creek area southwest of Happy
Camp, deputies said.</LD>

<LD>Police are seeking a man who attacked a woman in Yorba Linda, then
fled after she kicked him in the shin.</LD>
<LD>   The 46-year-old woman was walking east on Esperanza Road toward
New River about 7:30 a.m. Tuesday when the man--whom she had seen
exposing himself under a bridge--ran down a ramp, grabbed her from
behind and pulled her toward some bushes, according to Det. Kory
Dodd, a spokesman for the Brea Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   The woman, trained in martial arts, fought off the man before
jumping a fence and flagging down a motorist.</LD>
<TE>   The attacker, who fled on foot in an unknown direction, was
described as about 5 feet, 7 inches tall, 160 to 180 pounds, with
dark brown hair, bloodshot green eyes and a face appearing "weathered
and rough," police said.</TE>

<HD>Car Insurance Discount Defeated in Committee</HD>
<DH>Senate: Vote is a blow to firm that donated to seven of the
panel's nine members. Bill would have allowed rate break for
continuous coverage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIRGINIA ELLIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Legislation that would allow automobile insurers to offer discounts
to customers who have continuously purchased insurance was defeated
in a key Senate committee Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The measure, AB 1488, fell one short of the five votes it needed
to win approval in the nine-member Senate Insurance Committee.
Chairwoman Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough) said it is not likely to be
acted on again.</LD>
<LD>   It was a severe setback for Mercury Insurance Group, a Los
Angeles-based company that had sponsored the measure in the hope of
short-circuiting Insurance Commissioner Harry Low's plan to prohibit
the discount.</LD>
<TE>   Mercury had given campaign contributions to seven of the committee
members, with some coming just days before the panel was to consider
the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Company representatives argued that the discount was a boon for
consumers because it allowed them to shop for the best rate and still
get a discount for having maintained insurance coverage. Under Low's
regulation, companies would be able to offer a "loyalty discount"
only to customers who stayed with the same company.</TE>
<TE>   But Mark Savage, an attorney representing Consumers Union and the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Greater Los Angeles, said
for longtime customers to get the discount proposed by Mercury, new
purchasers of insurance would have to pay higher rates to make up the
difference.</TE>
<TE>   He said the higher rates would fall disproportionately on the
poor, many of whom are buying coverage for the first time in order to
comply with the state's mandatory insurance law.</TE>
<TE>   Speier, who voted against the bill, said both types of
discounts--the one for loyalty and the one for maintaining
coverage--were unfair because customers who didn't quality for the
break had to pay higher rates.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the whole concept is problematic," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Among those supporting the bill was Sen. Don Perata (D-Alameda),
who received a $25,000 contribution from Mercury shortly before the
first hearing on the bill June 26. He said he favored the legislation
because it would give working-class people in his district a greater
ability to shop around for the lowest insurance rates. Perata said
the contribution from Mercury did not influence his position.</TE>
<TE>   Others who voted for the bill included Sens. Ross Johnson
(R-Irvine) and Nell Soto (D-Pomona), who each received $3,000 from
Mercury. But Sens. Martha Escutia (D-Whittier) and Liz Figueroa
(D-Fremont), who also received $3,000, voted against the measure.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Jack Scott (D-Altadena), who collected $3,000, and Sen. Bill
Morrow (R-Oceanside), who got $1,000, were not present for the
voting.</TE>

<HD>Black Inmates Allege Abuse</HD>
<DH>Courts: Orange County officials defend record but won't
talk about three prisoners' case.</DH>

<LD>Three black inmates at the Orange County Jail charge in a federal
lawsuit filed Wednesday that a group of deputies known as the "psycho
crew" and "suicide committee" harass and abuse African American
detainees.</LD>
<LD>   The suit was filed by Richard P. Herman, the Laguna Beach attorney
who is asking a federal judge to hold the Sheriff's Department in
contempt of court.</LD>
<LD>   Herman maintains that the deputies' actions violate a 1978 federal
court order aimed at stemming jail overcrowding.</LD>
<TE>   Herman contends that deputies are routinely disregarding jail
policy, resulting in abuses at the jail.</TE>
<TE>   The suit says the deputies hurl racial slurs at black inmates,
beat them and psychologically abuse them. The court documents include
handwritten statements from three inmates.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's Department officials declined to comment. "It is the
practice of the Sheriff's Department not to comment on these kinds of
matters before our legal counsel reviews the court documents," said
spokesman Jon Fleischman. "We stand by the fact that Orange County
jails are among the best run in the nation."</TE>
<TE>   This is the third case Herman has filed alleging wrongdoing by
sheriff's deputies in recent months. A suit filed last month accused
deputies of forcing inmates to stand naked in cells.</TE>
<TE>   "These are only allegations and we feel comfortable about our
ability to defend the Orange County jail system in court," Fleischman
said.</TE>
<TE>   Herman, he added, "files many, many claims against our jail system
... and it's important to note that many of these claims are never
substantiated beyond the allegations made."</TE>

<HD>Knott's Sued in Death of Woman</HD>
<DH>Courts: The 20-year-old died a day after riding
Montezooma's Revenge. Family seeks damages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The family of a 20-year-old woman who died last year after suffering
a brain hemorrhage while riding on a Knott's Berry Farm roller
coaster sued the amusement park and its parent company Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The wrongful death suit, filed in Orange County Superior Court,
alleges that Montezooma's Revenge is unsafe and that the Buena Park
theme park inadequately warns riders of the risks.</LD>
<LD>   "You don't expect to go to an amusement park and end up in a body
bag," said Barry Novack, a Beverly Hills lawyer who is representing
the family of Justine Bolia. "This was a beautiful, creative young
woman."</LD>
<TE>   Bolia, a visitor from Africa who was an aspiring singer and model,
died Sept. 1, one day after riding Montezooma's Revenge.</TE>
<TE>   Novack said an autopsy found Bolia, a roller coaster aficionado,
had a preexisting brain aneurysm that she was unaware of. The ride's
force led the aneurysm to hemorrhage, causing death, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If that preexisting condition is put into the right set of
environmental factors, it bursts and bleeds and leads to a coma,"
Novack said.</TE>
<TE>   A Knott's spokeswoman said company officials had not seen the
lawsuit and declined comment. State regulators allowed the ride to be
reopened within days, saying there was no evidence it contributed to
Bolia's death.</TE>
<TE>   Montezooma's Revenge accelerates to 60 mph in three seconds and
roars forward then backward through a loop seven stories high.
Millions of people have ridden it since its 1978 opening, according
to park officials.</TE>
<TE>   The suit seeks compensation for medical and burial expenses and
damages for emotional distress suffered by her parents, three
brothers and an aunt who were with Bolia when she climbed on the
ride.</TE>

<HD>District May Use Surplus for Benefits</HD>
<DH>L.A. Unified: Supt. Roy Romer says financial windfall will
cover $38.5-million cost. Union leaders attack proposal, saying it's
only a stopgap measure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Unified School District Supt. Roy Romer said Wednesday
that he will propose using as much as $38.5 million in surplus funds
from the last fiscal year for employee health benefits.</LD>
<LD>   He said the money would come from a $60-million to $65-million
surplus that the district recently discovered after overestimating
last year's expenditures.</LD>
<LD>   Though union leaders have been negotiating with the district for
months, staged a series of rallies and even threatened to strike this
fall over health benefits, they said they will reject Romer's
proposal. They say it would only be a stopgap measure to cover them
for next year.</LD>
<TE>   "If they were serious they would have come up with ongoing money
so we wouldn't have the same problem on June 30, 2003," said John
Perez, president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, the district's
largest union, with 47,000 teachers, librarians, counselors, school
nurses and other members.</TE>
<TE>   Perez said that Romer was trying to undermine the union's morale
by offering the onetime funding arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   Romer said the district may be able to find permanent funding for
health coverage by drawing from other programs.</TE>
<TE>   Health benefits have been a main sticking point because of
increasing costs. A union-controlled L.A. Unified health benefits
committee found that the district would have to pay an additional
$78.5 million to keep its current level of coverage in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Romer said the district paid $495 million for benefits last year
and estimated that at present growth rates, annual health coverage
costs could reach $995 million in five years.</TE>
<TE>   "Efficiencies and incentives need to be put into this program,"
Romer said.</TE>
<TE>   He suggested, for example, that couples working at the district
should not get two health plans. Romer also said that the district
could offer district employees incentives to use their spouse's
health coverage.</TE>
<TE>   The district has already paid $40 million to cover increased
health-care costs for next year, and until this week Romer had
repeatedly said he didn't know where to find the extra $38.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Perez said that the district has always had enough money to pay
for health benefits for its employees, but unwisely spent the money
on outside consultants and construction projects.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to health benefits, the union is seeking a 5% raise
for its teachers, which would cost the district $125 million. Romer
says there is not enough money to satisfy the union's demands. But
union leaders say the district will not be able to attract and retain
qualified teachers without better pay.</TE>
<TE>   About 200 teachers and other union members held a rally at Manual
Arts High School in South-Central Los Angeles and are planning
another today at Sepulveda Middle School to protest the district's
failure to permanently fund health benefits and to provide the raises
they seek.</TE>
<TE>   Romer said it was unfortunate that he did not have a better handle
on how much money the district had--especially because the Board of
Education had to make deep midyear cuts to make up an unexpected
$110-million shortfall. But he said finding a year-end surplus is not
unusual.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a budgetary system that is very complex and large," said
Romer, explaining that L.A. Unified has more than 6,000 accounts and
that $65 million was a little more than 1% of the district's total
general fund budget.</TE>
<TE>   "You saw me before that board cutting and cutting and cutting with
the understanding that we had no ending balance," Romer said.</TE>
<TE>   Now Romer said he would be able to pay for health benefits through
2003, and perhaps use some of the remaining money for salary
increases or to cushion the district against more budget cuts in
Sacramento.</TE>

<HD>Mediator Rules Against MTA on Bus Crowding</HD>
<DH>Transit: The agency is found to exceed standards agreed
upon with the riders union.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A mediator has ruled that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's
bus service does not meet the strict standards on overcrowding
established in a federal agreement.</LD>
<LD>   The MTA and the Bus Riders Union, lead plaintiff in the federal
consent decree that forced massive improvements to the countywide bus
system, have clashed since 1996 over whether the transit agency is
limiting the number of people forced to stand on crowded buses, as it
agreed to do.</LD>
<LD>   The clash has played out in numerous courtrooms, with the MTA
repeatedly appealing the consent decree only to be rebuked by federal
judges and, in March, the state Supreme Court.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Donald Bliss, the Washington lawyer appointed to
mediate the dispute, issued a ruling stating that the MTA has
violated overcrowding standards on at least 68 bus lines over the
last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Bliss' ruling was based on statistics provided by the Bus Riders
Union and the MTA, in addition to a memo acknowledging overcrowding
on the lines signed last week by representatives of both sides.</TE>
<TE>   The riders' organization praised the ruling, characterizing the
MTA as deceitful and uninterested in the best interests of its core
customers: low-income bus riders. As he has done repeatedly, Union
director Eric Mann said the MTA buses are "massively overcrowded" and
called for 250 more buses to be put on the street.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA downplayed the ruling. A spokesman said the agency's bus
service is much improved, partly because of the consent decree. He
pointed to the near-total replacement of an aging fleet of nearly
2,200 buses with new vehicles and the fact that most lines do not
have significant overcrowding problems.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA continues to reason that the overcrowding benchmarks do
not represent a complete picture of what the bus system is like.
"It's just impossible not to have too many people standing at certain
times," said Marc Littman, an MTA spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Far more important than the haggle over whether eight or 11 people
on average are standing on MTA's rush-hour buses is the next step:
what to do about it.</TE>
<TE>   Bliss has directed both sides to study why buses are too crowded
and then give him recommendations on how to solve the problem. If the
two sides fail to come to an agreement, Bliss will step in to offer
his own solution sometime in the next three to four months.</TE>

<HD>Nixon Sisters Settle Dispute</HD>
<DH>Courts: Mediation forges accord on how to spend $20-million
bequest to library.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Richard Nixon's daughters have resolved their two-year fight over how
to spend a $20-million bequest for their father's presidential
library in Yorba Linda.</LD>
<LD>   Tricia Cox and Julie Eisenhower completed a court-ordered
mediation Wednesday, but details of the private meeting were not
released.</LD>
<LD>   "It was amicably resolved, but I cannot get into the details of
the resolution because the parties wanted to keep them private," said
Jack Falk, an attorney for the Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace Foundation
in Orange County.</LD>
<TE>   Nixon's longtime friend, Key Biscayne banker Charles "Bebe"
Rebozo, left 65% of his estate to the library on the condition that
the sisters and another Nixon friend, Robert Abplanalp, approve the
spending.</TE>
<TE>   The trust, formed after Rebozo died in 1998, gave the foundation
$781,000 in 1999 but nothing since.</TE>
<TE>   A check for $1.3 million intended for taxes has been frozen.</TE>
<TE>   The sisters fought over whether the library should be operated by
the family, which was Cox's view, or by a 24-member board, the
preference of Eisenhower and the library foundation.</TE>
<TE>   In January, the foundation sued in both Florida and California to
unfreeze money.</TE>
<TE>   In June, Miami-Dade County Judge Maria Korvick ordered the
face-to-face mediation between the daughters, Abplanalp, estate
trustees and representatives of the library.</TE>

<HD>Nurses Begin 4-Day Walkout</HD>
<DH>Labor: St. Vincent staff strikes for higher pay; Queen of
Angels workers agree to new pact.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Registered nurses at a Los Angeles hospital launched a four-day
walkout Wednesday, the same day health workers at another facility
announced a three-year contract following months of negotiations and
two strikes.</LD>
<LD>   About 350 registered nurses at St. Vincent Medical Center are
expected to strike in a push for salary increases, especially for
senior staff members, said David Johnson, spokesman for the
California Nurses Assn.</LD>
<LD>   The hospital has hired temporary nursing staff to ensure patient
services are not disrupted, officials said. Administrators said they
have not been given a chance to renew negotiations since nurses
rejected a tentative agreement in mid-July.</LD>
<TE>   Nurses at St. Vincent contend they are not paid comparably to
others in the area with their level of experience.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not fair," said Michelle Cabauatan, a nurse at St. Vincent
for five years. She said new hires are paid more than she is.</TE>
<TE>   "We're the ones mentoring and guiding them, but they're getting
the bonuses."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, nurses and other health workers at Queen of
Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center celebrated a contract
with parent company Tenet Healthcare Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement will raise salaries at least 11% over three years,
reduce employees' out-of-pocket costs for health benefits and include
nurses on committees that make staffing and patient care decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Workers said perseverance, including six months of negotiations
and two walkouts earlier in the summer, paid off.</TE>
<TE>   "We moved workers to fight for themselves," said social worker
Sonya Jimmons. "And that unity and strength moved Tenet past their
last, best and final offer."</TE>

<HD>Landowner Denies Bulldozing 301 Oaks</HD>
<DH>Hillsides: County says William Kaddis illegally cut down
the trees near Ojai and faces $3 million in fines, but he contends he
is victim of hate crime.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The oak trees are gone. All 301 of them.</LD>
<LD>   The question is, who removed them?</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County officials say property owner William Kaddis used
bulldozers last fall to illegally plow over the trees, leaving barren
nearly half of his 43-acre hillside property outside Ojai.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, Kaddis faces up to $3 million in fines in what
officials believe is the largest illegal tree-removal case in county
history.</TE>
<TE>   But Kaddis, an Egyptian real estate broker, has denied that he
uprooted the trees and contends that he is the victim of a racial
hate crime. He has sued the county for $10 million, accusing
inspectors of trespassing on his property during a visit in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the Ventura County Board of Supervisors rejected
Kaddis' appeal of an earlier Planning Commission ruling. Now the two
sides appear headed for court.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Steve Bennett, whose district includes Kaddis'
property, said he was swayed by "overwhelming evidence" presented by
county planners.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a real rape of the land," Bennett said Wednesday. "You
just can't restore it in the foreseeable future."</TE>
<TE>   Kaddis and his attorney could not be reached for comment
Wednesday. But Kaddis has suggested several theories on how the trees
were uprooted.</TE>
<TE>   Testifying before the Planning Commission in April, Kaddis said
that owners of nearby properties were upset that he had purchased the
$615,000 property near Lake Casitas. One of them disgustedly asked
him, "Where the hell are you from?" he said, and an anonymous letter
threatened that he would be harmed and his citrus groves burned.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not a lawbreaker!" Kaddis told the commissioners. "I'm a
Christian! All of a sudden, when I come to Ventura County, I am
suddenly a lawbreaker!"</TE>
<TE>   But county officials have pointed out that a property owner is
ultimately responsible for land-use violations, even if the
individual did not know that the violations had occurred.</TE>
<TE>   County workers first learned of the tree removal from Kaddis'
neighbors. Inspectors visited the property Oct. 11 and found nearly
20 acres cleared of trees and brush, according to a Planning
Commission report.</TE>
<TE>   They also found a worker, who identified himself as Kaddis'
employee, using a bulldozer to push previously downed trees and brush
into piles. Kaddis did not have permits to uproot the trees or to
remove the brush.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fairly easy to see he was violating the ordinance," said
Scott Ellison, a senior planner with the county. "We could certainly
tell a violation had occurred, and was occurring before our eyes."</TE>
<TE>   Kaddis has acknowledged that he rented two bulldozers during
September and October, but has said they were used to clear brush,
not to knock down trees. Throughout the appeal process, Kaddis has
offered several explanations for the trees' removal from his
property.</TE>
<TE>   One of Kaddis' theories is that the trees were uprooted before he
acquired the property in July 2001. Another is that vandals may have
cut down the trees in a possible hate crime, according to county
documents.</TE>
<TE>   Kaddis filed a complaint in January with the Sheriff's Department,
stating that he had received racist hate mail, was threatened
verbally by neighbors and that his property had been vandalized.</TE>
<TE>   Kaddis turned over to authorities an envelope left on his property
that contained "a typed letter threatening him and expressed
contention with proposed use of the site (i.e. church, campsite for
children or sanctuary for battered women)," according to a Planning
Commission report. "The letter appears to take credit for the dumping
of oak tree brush on the site and for the on-site vandalism."</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department investigated Kaddis' report, but found
"no evidence of a credible threat," according to county documents.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a California Department of Fish and Game biologist who
visited the property Aug. 29 wrote that the "oak woodlands [were]
pristine and undisturbed," and that no tree removal had occurred
prior to that date.</TE>
<TE>   A certified arborist later determined that the trees had been
removed after Kaddis had bought the property.</TE>
<TE>   With the trees removed, county planning officials are concerned
about the potential for erosion, as well as possible stream sediment
buildup.</TE>
<TE>   "It would take hundreds of years to replace an oak tree forest,"
Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   In deciding the penalty for the tree removal, county officials
have several options. They could fine Kaddis as much as $1 million.
Or, they could order him to purchase 20 acres of oak forest in the
county and donate the land to a conservancy group or to the state as
open space.</TE>
<TE>   A third option would require Kaddis to plant new trees to replace
the mature oaks that were uprooted. Because trees can't always be
replaced with a one-to-one ratio, it may take 50 small trees to
replace one mature oak, Ellison said.</TE>
<TE>   This last option would be the costliest. Ellison estimates that
the tab could run in excess of $3 million to pay for hundreds of oak
trees and the acreage on which to plant them.</TE>
<TE>   Oak trees are only part of Kaddis' troubles.</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, he has been investigated by the Ventura County
Public Works Agency, the county Resource Conservation District and
the California Department of Fish and Game on suspicion of various
violations.</TE>
<TE>   Until the tree issue is resolved, Kaddis also will not be allowed
a permit for the 35 dogs he is housing illegally in a kennel on his
property, Ellison said.</TE>

while traveling through Europe with his mother. His art studies at
Harvard were interrupted by service in the army during World War II
and later the Korean War. In between wars, he returned to Harvard,
earning his bachelor's and master's degrees. He completed work for
his doctorate in 1955.</LD>
<LD>   He served as curator of drawings and prints at the Cooper Union
Museum from 1955 to 1964, when he left to join the Smithsonian
American Art Museum. In 1969 and 1970, he served as director of the
Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Design in New York. In the 1970s, he taught
at Middlebury College and later became president of appraisals for
Christie, Manson &amp; Woods International in New York City. He moved to
La Jolla after retiring in 1990.</LD>

<HD>Matthew Robinson Jr., 65; Original Cast Member of 'Sesame
Street'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Matthew T. Robinson Jr., an original cast member on television's
"Sesame Street" and longtime writer for "The Cosby Show," died at his
Los Angeles home Monday after a 20-year battle with Parkinson's
disease. He was 65.</LD>
<LD>   He entered show business as a writer and later producer and on-air
talent at WCAU-TV in his native Philadelphia in the early 1960s.</LD>
<LD>   He joined "Sesame Street" in 1969 as a producer. He later was cast
as Gordon, the resident father image in the popular preschool
program, to replace the professional actor originally hired for the
part. He remained in that role until 1971.</LD>
<TE>   He went on to write for two top-rated '70s sitcoms, "Sanford and
Son" and "Eight Is Enough." Then, for seven seasons beginning in
1983, he wrote for Bill Cosby's show. He co-produced as well as wrote
many episodes.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson also wrote and produced films, including "Save the
Children" and "Amazing Grace."</TE>
<TE>   A chance meeting with Lincoln Perry, better known as Stepin
Fetchit, one of America's first black movie stars, led him to write a
well-received one-man play, "The Confessions of Stepin Fetchit,"
which was produced off-Broadway in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1982. His
struggle with the disorder inspired his daughter, actress Holly
Robinson Peete, and her husband, NFL quarterback Rodney Peete, to
start the HollyRod Foundation in 1997, which provides support to
those afflicted with the disease.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson is also survived by his wife, Dolores; a son, Matt
Robinson III; and five grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. Friday at the Writers
Guild of America Theater in Beverly Hills. Donations in lieu of
flowers may be sent to HollyRod Foundation, which can be reached at
(310) 385-1590 or at www.holly rod.com.</TE>

<LD>Crews struggled Wednesday to control a fire that has blackened more
than 80 square miles of mountain and desert terrain in eastern San
Diego County.</LD>
<LD>   More than 3,000 firefighters concentrated on protecting the rural
town of Ranchita and tried to control the fire on the Los Coyotes
Indian Reservation and in Anza Borrego State Park.</LD>
<LD>   The wildfire has swept across more than 53,000 acres and destroyed
25 homes. It began July 29 when a National Guard helicopter on an
anti-drug patrol clipped a power line. The fire is 60% contained.
Firefighters expect to have it fully contained Sunday and
extinguished four days later.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Navy has not decided whether to repair its oldest and last
diesel-powered submarine almost three months after it nearly sank 100
miles off San Diego, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The research submarine Dolphin suffered $10 million in damage due
to massive flooding caused when the wrong gasket installed on a door
was unable to withstand the pounding of heavy waves. The May 21
accident occurred as the sub was running on the surface while
recharging its batteries.</LD>
<LD>   Navy spokesman Lt. Kim Marks said the Navy is exploring other
options for its research and development program rather than
repairing the Dolphin.</LD>
<TE>   Built in 1968 as a one-of-a-kind research vessel, the 165-foot,
950-ton sub was involved in testing most of the innovations in sonar,
acoustics, weaponry and communications equipment.</TE>

<HD>Groups Sue to Block Federal Use of Undersea Sonar System</HD>
<DH>Ocean: Coalition fears creatures will be hurt or killed.
But Navy downplays risk and says plan is needed for protection from
ultra-quiet submarines</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HYMON and TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a bid to prevent "a massive degradation of ocean ecosystems," a
coalition of environmental groups has filed a lawsuit to block the
U.S. Navy and National Marine Fisheries Service from deploying a
powerful new sonar system.</LD>
<LD>   The groups, led by the National Resources Defense Council, said
the Navy's low-frequency sonar would maim or kill whales, dolphins
and other sea creatures that rely on a delicate acoustic environment
to find food and mates, communicate and travel migratory routes.</LD>
<LD>   "If we flood the oceans with high-intensity, low-frequency sound
carrying enormous energy--energy large enough to affect the bodies of
these organisms mechanically--we're killing them," said George
Woodwell, a member of the resources council board and director of the
Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts.</LD>
<TE>   Last month, the National Marine Fisheries Service agreed to exempt
the low-frequency sonar from the Marine Mammal Protection Act after
determining that the system would have a "negligible impact" on any
species. The result is that the Navy has permission to "harass" and
potentially injure whales while conducting exercises with the system.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike passive sonar--which listens for ambient noise--the new,
"active" sonar transmits powerful signals to detect objects in the
water.</TE>
<TE>   But environmentalists said the fisheries service's ruling was
backed by inadequate science and may kill members of protected
species in U.S. waters. This, they said, violates several federal
laws, including the Endangered Species Act.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon Helm, a spokesman for the fisheries service, said he was
disappointed that the lawsuit was challenging the agency's scientific
findings. "All told, we addressed 280 issues before we made our
decision," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Navy officials have said that the Surveillance Towed Array Sensor
System is needed to protect aircraft carriers and other warships from
new ultra-quiet submarines being built by several nations, including
Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Such submarines could allow a hostile country to send an attack
sub within striking distance of a U.S. ship in international waters
without being detected. The threat from the new submarines, the Navy
said, is "real and increasing."</TE>
<TE>   "We are disappointed that some groups refuse to accept scientific,
peer-reviewed findings [about the possible harm to whales] and
instead rely on misinformation and unrelated facts," the Navy said in
a statement released in response to the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy and the fisheries service contend that the sonar's impact
will primarily be local and that strict precautions will be taken to
protect whales and dolphins. The Navy has even vowed to shut down the
system if any animals swim too close to the ships.</TE>
<TE>   But the National Resources Defense Council argues that the sonar's
impact will be global in scale.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference Wednesday, members of the group said sound
waves from the sonar could travel hundreds or thousands of miles
beneath the sea.</TE>
<TE>   Both the frequency and volume of those signals could kill a whale
by causing internal tissues to tear, in the same way an opera singer
can shatter a glass with a high note, said Naomi Rose, a marine
mammal scientist with the Humane Society.</TE>
<TE>   Rose and other officials from the resources council pointed to the
beaching of 16 whales in the Bahamas in 2000. Some of the whales
died. The Navy admitted that its use of sonar caused the beaching but
said it was a different type of system that used higher frequencies
than the new system would employ.</TE>
<TE>   The resources council believes that at least 10 other nations may
be developing similar sonar systems. Such widespread development,
they fear, would smother the global undersea environment with noise
pollution.</TE>
<TE>   "Sound is to marine mammals what sight is to human beings," said
Joel Reynolds, a resources council attorney. "If we interfere with
their ability to hear, and if we recklessly turn our oceans into an
acoustic traffic jam, then we threaten a broad range of species who
depend on ... their ability to hear and be heard."</TE>
<TE>   The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco.
Joining the resources council in the suit are the Humane Society,
League for Coastal Protection, Cetacean Society International and
Ocean Futures Society.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the resources council said they may seek a temporary
restraining order to prevent deployment of the system, which could
begin as soon as Sept. 17.</TE>

<HD>Tax Cut on Film Wages Advances</HD>
<DH>Capitol: A state Senate panel approves a bill designed to
keep TV and movie production here. Critics say the state can't afford
it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGG JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>As state legislators prepare to slash spending and increase taxes to
bridge a $23.6-billion budget shortfall, a key Senate committee
Wednesday approved a bill to cut taxes on motion picture industry
wages.</LD>
<LD>   The legislation, which supporters say is needed to prevent Canada
and other foreign and domestic competitors from siphoning off movie
industry jobs, would cost the state an estimated $650 million in lost
revenue over five years, according to a Senate staff analysis.</LD>
<LD>   But supporters of Assembly Bill 2747-- approved 4 to 0 by the
Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee--say the legislation would pay
for itself in the long run by keeping high-paying film industry jobs
in California. The bill, written by Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson and
sponsored by Gov. Gray Davis, would offer a 15% tax credit on
qualified wages.</LD>
<TE>   A Senate staff analysis, however, concluded that the tax credit
"is likely to have a marginal impact on where productions are
filmed."</TE>
<TE>   "The problem of runaway production is real," the analysis
continued. "The proposed credit, much of which would go to producers
who have no intention of leaving California, seems a blunt instrument
to use in this battle."</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the state can't afford the tax credit, especially with
California facing its worst budget crisis in a decade.</TE>
<TE>   "We think if you're going to attack the problem, it needs to be
done in a targeted way," said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for the
California Tax Reform Assn. "Otherwise we are going to be losing a
whole lot of money and we're not going to be getting much bang for
the buck."</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg and other critics of the bill suggested that Washington,
D.C., not California, should take the lead by pursuing a North
American Free Trade Agreement complaint against Canada for poaching
U.S. film jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Industry advocates dismissed that suggestion as foolhardy.</TE>
<TE>   "It would trigger a trade war," said Bruce C. Doering, national
executive director of the International Cinematographers Guild.</TE>
<TE>   Supporting the movie industry should be a no-brainer for the
state, supporters say.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a jobs bill," Doering said. "It's a well-paying,
nonpolluting industry that every other government wants. It's time
our government steps up to level the playing field."</TE>
<TE>   The industry has lost thousands of jobs in recent years as other
countries--and other U.S. states--have aggressively courted
California's glamour sector with tax credits, rebates and other
incentives. Because of tax breaks, lower labor costs and other
factors, production companies can reduce their costs by at least 15%
by filming in Canada, industry officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand [critics'] concerns," said Sen. Jack Scott
(D-Altadena), a key supporter of the bill, who said many of his
constituents had lost their jobs to "runaway" movie productions in
Canada and elsewhere. "But I think if we can stop that hemorrhaging,
the money to the state will be increased."</TE>
<TE>   The state's Franchise Tax Board estimates that passage of the bill
would result in a $25-million loss in revenue in 2004-05, the year
the tax credit would go into effect. The revenue loss would soar to
$175 million in 2005-06, then drop to between $110 million and $115
million until the credit expires in 2009, the state estimates.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Finance projects that the economic stimulus
effect of the credit would reduce overall revenue loss by 20%.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposed bill, a 15% tax credit would be granted for
wages paid in film productions with total wage payments between
$200,000 and $10 million. The credit would apply to the first $25,000
in wages paid.</TE>
<TE>   Only pay directly related to producing the motion picture would
qualify for the credit, which would exclude wages paid to lawyers,
accountants, marketing specialists and other jobs indirectly related
to the production.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, which already has passed the Assembly, must be approved
by one more committee before moving to the Senate floor.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Must Pay Cleanup Costs at Waste Site, Court Decides</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. government must pay the entire cost of cleaning up a
hazardous waste site in Los Angeles, a federal appeals court has
ruled.</LD>
<LD>   In their appeal to the court, lawyers for the federal government
had said that Dow Chemical should share in the cost to clean up the
site, which was polluted during World War II efforts to produce
synthetic rubber. The plant is located just east of Torrance. But the
three-member panel for the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals called
the case "shocking" and Tuesday upheld a decision by a lower court.</LD>
<LD>   "The government is trying to take money from firms it conscripted
for a critical part of a great war effort," said the decision. "The
polluting conduct was completely under the direction of the
government, it was legal at the time, and the government promised to
hold the polluters, who acted as government agents, harmless."</LD>
<TE>   The judges were referring to a 60-year-old agreement between the
federal government and Dow Chemical in which Dow Chemical would
operate the plant as an "agent" and "at the expense and risk" of the
government.</TE>
<TE>   The plant was built at the height of World War II when most of the
regions that produced natural rubber were in Japanese hands and the
United States needed synthetic rubber for everything from gas masks
to medical supplies.</TE>
<TE>   The production created waste that was kept in pits and polluted
the ground as well as some water.</TE>
<TE>   In its appeal, the government argued that Dow should have to share
some cleanup costs because it supervised the digging of the waste
pits. But the judges ruled that Dow was just doing what the
government asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Dow's role was more nearly analogous to a soldier's than to a
commercial tenant's," the judges ruled.</TE>
<TE>   Dow operated the plant until 1955, when it was sold to Shell Oil,
which made synthetic rubber there until 1972. In 1983, its new owner,
developer Cadillac Fairview/California Inc. sued Dow, Shell, the U.S.
government and several rubber companies to cover the expense of
investigating soil pollution. Several cross suits have followed, and
a lower court ruled that the government should pay for cleanup costs.</TE>
<TE>   An appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is "within the realm of
possibility," said Dana Perino, a spokeswoman for the Department of
Justice. "But those decisions aren't made lightly, so we are still
reviewing our options."</TE>

<HD>Fire District Mounts Building Project</HD>
<DH>Modernization: Eleven inadequate stations will be rebuilt
or relocated, though funding is not complete. Work begins with new
headquarters.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Suffering from old age and poor location, several Ventura County fire
stations and administration buildings are slated to receive
much-needed modernization this decade.</LD>
<LD>   Construction is set to begin this month on the first of three
buildings at the Ventura County Fire Protection District
headquarters. Additionally, 11 fire stations would ultimately be
rebuilt or relocated. The capital improvements are projected to cost
an estimated $45 million, though much of the financing is yet to be
obtained.</LD>
<LD>   The building program would be the largest ever for the county Fire
Department, Fire Chief Bob Roper said Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   "These buildings were built in the 1940s and '50s," Roper said.
"[Since then] the population has increased in the county and certain
roads have changed."</TE>
<TE>   The county Board of Supervisors approved hiring a consultant last
month to manage the projects and suggested the district seek funds
from various state and federal grants in addition to its own budget.</TE>
<TE>   Money for five of the 14 projects has been secured, said Nick A.
Rollins, the Thousand Oaks project manager hired by the district.</TE>
<TE>   Construction of a new $3.4-million fire district headquarters at
Camarillo Airport is scheduled to begin later this month and be
completed by May, with state and local funds covering the entire
cost. The 10,000-square-foot, two-story building would include
renovations to the existing structure.</TE>
<TE>   A new "burn building" is needed at the headquarters, but no money
has been found for the $4-million training facility that simulates
fires.</TE>
<TE>   Also at headquarters, a $3.2-million communication center would be
housed in a two-story, 10,000-square-foot building and include a
dispatch center and offices, and sleeping, shower and eating areas.
Funds have not been located, but the district wants to complete the
burn building and communications center by late 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of improvements would modernize 11 fire stations that
have structural deficiencies, such as engine rooms that are too small
for today's larger fire engines, a lack of separate facilities for
male and female firefighters and locations in the middle of flood
plains. Construction for the new stations would also improve seismic
stability and energy conservation, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "The fire stations are just old," county Supervisor John Flynn
said.</TE>
<TE>   The stations to be improved are in Moorpark, Ojai, Oxnard, Susana
Knolls, Simi Valley, Meiners Oaks, Piru, Fillmore, Lake Sherwood,
Thousand Oaks and in southern Ventura County west of Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark's outdated station will be the first one rebuilt. A
$2.4-million facility, near High and Magnolia streets, is expected to
be completed by May 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The station was originally built to house the fire chief and his
family in one building and the station in the other. Today the fire
engines are separated from the main station.</TE>
<TE>   "In the winter, we basically have to run outside in the rain or
whatever to get to the engine room," said Fire Capt. Rick Bell.</TE>
<TE>   Improvements at the other fire stations include taking the fire
station near Malibu out of a leased building to a permanent site,
moving the Ojai station from a site where dirt and slag underground
produce potentially harmful gases and moving the Fillmore station
from a flood plain where the Sespe Creek has overflowed into the
building several times.</TE>

<HD>Sparkletts, Black Drivers Settle Bias Suit for $1.24
Million</HD>
<DH>Settlement: Firm was accused of giving them only inner-city
routes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Black truck drivers who deliver Sparkletts water in the Los Angeles
area will share in a $1.24-million settlement of a class-action
lawsuit that charged the bottled water company's former owner with
racial discrimination, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission announced this week.</LD>
<LD>   The drivers accused McKesson Water Products Co. of assigning
African American employees to so-called "ghetto routes" in low-income
neighborhoods, which are less profitable than those in more affluent
communities.</LD>
<LD>   Because pay and promotions were tied to the profitability of
routes, black drivers invariably made less money than their white
colleagues, according to the lawsuit filed in 1998.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Florence-Marie Cooper approved the settlement
in March and ratified a formula to distribute the money two weeks
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Lawson, an Oakland attorney who represented the workers,
said that about 85 current and former McKesson drivers will soon
receive checks ranging from about $1,000 to $27,000 each.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, McKesson was acquired by the French conglomerate,
Groupe Danone, which assumed responsibility for implementing the
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the money, the company has agreed to implement a
wide range of anti-discrimination policies, including a formal
job-bidding system and new criteria to determine route assignments,
compensation, promotions and performance evaluations.</TE>
<TE>   Anna Y. Park, regional counsel for the EEOC, praised Groupe
Danone, saying that it inherited the problem and has demonstrated a
sincere commitment to nondiscrimination in the workplace.</TE>
<TE>   The EEOC investigated the drivers' claims and joined in their suit
against McKesson.</TE>
<TE>   "We look forward to moving ahead with Danone's culture and values
to ensure that our company is a great place to work for all
employees," said Michael Harrison, vice president and general counsel
for Danone.</TE>
<TE>   Park said the EEOC will work with Danone over the next five years
to see that the settlement is fully implemented.</TE>

<HD>Woodward's Three Homers Not Enough</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dan Wilson spoiled shortstop Chris Woodward's big game.</LD>
<LD>   Woodward hit three home runs for Toronto, but Dan Wilson homered
in the top of the 10th inning to lift the Seattle Mariners over the
Blue Jays, 5-4, Wednesday night in a game that featured seven homers.</LD>
<LD>   "I'll remember it as the day I hit three home runs, but also as
the day we lost," said Woodward, who received three cigars after the
game. "It would have been a lot better had we won."</LD>
<TE>   Woodward, who had eight home runs in 148 at-bats this season, had
the first multihomer game of his career. He tied the score, 1-1, with
a drive against Joel Pineiro in the fifth inning, put the Blue Jays
ahead, 3-2, with a solo shot against Pineiro in the seventh, and tied
the score, 4-4, against Kazuhiro Sasaki with one out in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Woodward said an error he committed in the third inning carried
over into his at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   "It helped me in a positive way," Woodward said. "I was mad. It
got me focused more. It made me step it up a notch."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson homered against Luke Prokopec (2-9). Sasaki (3-5) pitched
two innings for the victory.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners took a 4-3 lead in the ninth. Reliever Scott Cassidy
hit Jeff Cirillo with a pitch, Ichiro Suzuki singled and Mark
McLemore put down a sacrifice bunt.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto closer Kelvim Escobar then hit John Olerud with a pitch
before Edgar Martinez hit a run-scoring single. Bret Boone followed
with a fly out to right fielder Jose Cruz Jr., who threw out a
sliding Suzuki at home.</TE>
<TE>   New York 6, Kansas City 2--Roger Clemens came off the disabled
list to throw seven sharp innings, getting home run support from
Jorge Posada and Derek Jeter at New York.</TE>
<TE>   Driving off the mound with strength and purpose, Clemens (9-3)
showed no ill effects of the injured right groin that had kept him
out since July 13. He struck out eight in his 289th victory, passing
Tommy John for sole possession of 21st place on the all-time list.</TE>
<TE>   Posada drove in four runs with a three-run homer against Jeff
Suppan (8-11) and a bases-loaded walk, and Jeter hit his first homer
in a month.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 6, Tampa Bay 2--C.C. Sabathia got his elusive seventh
victory and Karim Garcia hit a two-run homer for the Indians at
Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Sabathia (7-9) won for the first time since June 28--a span of
seven starts--by limiting the Devil Rays to two runs and five hits in
seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   Tanyon Sturtze (1-12) got the loss and Steve Cox homered for the
Devil Rays, who are 3-17 on the road since June 19.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 6, Minnesota 4--Gary Matthews Jr. had three hits and two
runs batted in at Baltimore, and Scott Erickson (5-10) overcame his
own shaky fielding to earn his second victory since April 28.</TE>
<TE>   Melvin Mora had two hits and drove in two runs for the Orioles,
who built an early 5-0 lead against Rick Reed (9-6) and held on.</TE>
<TE>   It was the third consecutive loss for the Twins, their longest
skid since they dropped three in a row June 19-21.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 7, Detroit 2--Kevin Mench hit a tiebreaking single and Alex
Rodriguez had a two-run double in Texas' five-run 11th inning at
Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Carl Everett also had a run-scoring single and Rafael Palmeiro hit
a sacrifice fly.</TE>
<TE>   Former Tiger Francisco Cordero (1-0) pitched two scoreless innings
to help send Detroit to its ninth defeat in 11 games.</TE>

<HD>A's Catch Red Sox in the Long Run</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Center fielder's grab preserves 3-2 win, pulls
Oakland into tie for second with Boston in wild-card race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Terrence Long figures it was the best catch of his career. He wasn't
getting any arguments from the team he robbed.</LD>
<LD>   Oakland's center fielder raced to the right-center field fence,
reached into the Boston bullpen and made a game-ending, backhanded
catch that robbed Manny Ramirez of a three-run homer and preserved
the Athletics' 3-2 victory over the Red Sox on Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   "A little bit of surprise, and a little bit of luck," Long said.
"Once I got close to the track, the ball was hit high enough that I
was able to slow down in case I had to jump."</LD>
<TE>   He didn't have to, but he couldn't avoid jubilant right fielder
Jermaine Dye's tackle after the play</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody's got to tell him he's 6 feet 6, 220 pounds," Long said.
"He can't be jumping on me like that."</TE>
<TE>   Long's catch helped reliever Billy Koch escape a jam for the
second consecutive inning to earn his 28th save.</TE>
<TE>   Koch walked Johnny Damon and gave up a single to Trot Nixon with
one out in the ninth before striking out Nomar Garciaparra. Ramirez,
who hit his 19th homer leading off the fourth, sent a drive that kept
carrying.</TE>
<TE>   Koch ran out to shallow center to give Long a grateful hug.
Several other A's ran out to celebrate.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great catch," Boston bullpen coach Bob Kipper said. "No.
1, he gets to it. No. 2, he catches it. No. 3, he hangs on to it."</TE>
<TE>   It was the fourth consecutive victory for the A's, who tied the
Red Sox for second place in the American League wild-card race, 1 1/2
games behind the Angels.</TE>

<HD>Kennedy Earns Return Ticket</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Adam Kennedy, whose hold on his position was tenuous at best in
spring training, has won the second-base job for next season, General
Manager Bill Stoneman said.</LD>
<LD>   Kennedy is hitting .302, a batting average that ranks second among
the Angels behind Garret Anderson and second among American League
second basemen behind Alfonso Soriano of the New York Yankees. In
addition to providing offense from the ninth spot in the batting
order, he has thrilled management and the coaching staff with his
tireless work in improving his defense.</LD>
<LD>   And, Stoneman suggested, Kennedy has attracted the interest of
other major league teams.</LD>
<TE>   "He's having a heck of a year," Stoneman said. "The way Adam has
played on both sides of the ball--offensively and defensively--has
shown everybody here and on other clubs that he's a very good major
league player."</TE>
<TE>   Although Manager Mike Scioscia says he believes Kennedy can hit
left-handers, he generally benches Kennedy against them, in favor of
Benji Gil.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not my call. That's up to Mike," Stoneman said. "My call
is, do I want him on the Angels or not? Darn right I do."</TE>
<TE>   Gil, in the final year of a two-year contract, batted a
career-high .296 last season. He is batting .270 this season, with
two hits in his last 21 at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   The spring pressure on Kennedy in part reflected the projection
that top infield prospect Alfredo Amezaga would advance from triple-A
this year to Anaheim next year. But Amezaga, 24, is batting .240 at
Salt Lake, where the high altitude generally inflates offensive
production, and he could earn a return ticket there next season for
more work on his switch-hitting.</TE>
<TE>   "Patience pays off in this business. It will with him," Stoneman
said. "This guy is going to be a very good major league player."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, reliever Al Levine met with Scioscia and pitching
coach Bud Black to discuss his role. Levine opened the season as the
primary set-up man for closer Troy Percival, but that role is now
shared by Ben Weber, Scott Schoeneweis and Brendan Donnelly.</TE>
<TE>   Levine mopped up Tuesday, pitching the final three innings of an
11-2 victory. Scioscia did not rule out Levine returning to the setup
role but said the Angels want him to pitch extended innings in case
he is needed as a spot starter.</TE>

<HD>Lieber to Have Elbow Surgery</HD>

<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chicago Cub right-hander Jon Lieber, a 20-game winner last season,
will undergo reconstructive elbow surgery that will sideline him for
a year, the team said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Lieber, 32, is 6-8 with three complete games and a 3.70 earned-run
average. He was 20-6 with a 3.80 ERA last season.</LD>
<LD>   The ligaments in Lieber's elbow are worn and thin, Cub General
Manager Jim Hendry said. Lieber was put on the 15-day disabled list
Friday because of right elbow tendinitis that has bothered him all
season.</LD>
<TE>   "He's optimistic that this will prolong his career," Hendry said.
"He obviously wants to pitch three or four more years, and the only
way he thinks he can do that is to have the surgery."</TE>

<TE>   New York Met co-owner Fred Wilpon asked a federal court to dismiss
claims by his longtime partner that the team's appraisal was unfair.</TE>
<TE>   Wilpon sued Nelson Doubleday last month in an effort to force him
to sell him his 50% share based on a $391-million appraisal of the
team by Robert Starkey.</TE>
<TE>   In an answer to the lawsuit, Doubleday said Tuesday the
commissioner's office was "in cahoots" with Wilpon to put an
artificially low value on the team.</TE>
<TE>   Doubleday also accused Commissioner Bud Selig of conspiring with
Starkey, a former Arthur Andersen accountant, to "manufacture phantom
operating losses" in the sport's books, allegations Wilpon and Major
League Baseball denied.</TE>
<TE>   Doubleday contended he did not know the extent of the work Starkey
did for the commissioner's office and said the appraisal should be
thrown out because of conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   Wilpon's lawyers said Doubleday adviser Dick Cummins attended an
owners' meeting Nov. 27 during which the extent of Starkey's work for
baseball was discussed. The lawyers also said Doubleday had access to
the minutes from a meeting Jan. 16 that detailed Starkey's work for
the commissioner's office.</TE>
<TE>   Doubleday, using this year's $660-million sale of the Boston Red
Sox as an example, says the Mets have a much higher value than
Starkey's appraisal.</TE>

<TE>   Texas put right-hander Chan Ho Park on the 15-day disabled list
because of a blister on a finger....Minnesota left-hander Eric Milton
was put on the 15-day disabled list because of a knee injury that
will sideline him for at least a month....Boston put right-hander
Rolando Arrojo on the 15-day disabled because of a bulging disk in
his back....Dave Burba, released last week by Texas, signed with
Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Colorado Manager Clint Hurdle agreed to a two-year contract
extension with club options for the following two seasons.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Tracy Not Ready to Let Beltre Clean Up Just Yet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Manager Jim Tracy has said he likes to keep his hottest hitter behind
No. 3 batter Shawn Green in the lineup, and with that in mind, he
admitted Wednesday he has considered moving third baseman Adrian
Beltre to the cleanup spot.</LD>
<LD>   "But I'm not ready to do that," Tracy said. "I'm aware of what I
said before, but you don't want to make a rash decision that sends a
message through the clubhouse that we haven't hit well for 25 games,
and it looks like we're in a panic mode. It's not going to be that
way."</LD>
<LD>   No Dodger struggled more than Beltre in the first four months of
the season--from June 29 to July 24, Beltre could not lift his
average above .240.</LD>
<TE>   But when the July 24 trade for utility player Tyler Houston
threatened to cut into Beltre's playing time, he responded by going
17 for 46 (.370) with four homers and 15 runs batted in during his
next 11 games.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy moved Beltre from the sixth and seventh spots to the fifth
spot this past week, and now that Beltre has snapped out of his
season-long funk, Tracy doesn't want to put too much pressure on
Beltre by hitting him cleanup.</TE>
<TE>   But if the Dodgers don't get more offense from the fourth spot,
which produced two RBIs in the first 25 games after the All-Star
break, Tracy may have no choice but to promote Beltre again.</TE>
<TE>   "If my hand gets forced because we're not getting it done behind
Shawn Green, then I will make that adjustment," Tracy said. "But if
you start doing things that are drastic ... you don't want to send a
message that's going to have people looking around and feeling the
guy in charge doesn't realize the offense has gone cold, but they're
all trying to rectify it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Mark Grudzielanek took the blame for a baserunning
gaffe that resulted in two runners on third base in the second inning
of Tuesday night's 3-1 loss to the Pirates.</TE>
<TE>   With Beltre on first and one out, Grudzielanek hit a blooper to
left that outfielder Brian Giles dived for, but the ball hit Giles in
the head and caromed toward center.</TE>
<TE>   Beltre headed for third while center fielder Adam Hyzdu retrieved
the ball, and Beltre was held by third base coach Glenn Hoffman. But
Grudzielanek didn't pick up Hoffman's stop sign around second and
continued to third, where Beltre was easily tagged out.</TE>
<TE>   "I got to third and I was like, 'What in the world?' "
Grudzielanek said. "I didn't think it would have been a close play at
the plate at all. It was just a weird play. But I should have looked
up. I took it for granted, I assumed [Beltre would score], and that
hurt us. It cost us a run."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Giles, whose flying header would have looked great on a World Cup
highlight show but will probably land him on a baseball bloopers
video, remained on the ground for several moments after Tuesday
night's play.</TE>
<TE>   When a trainer hustled to left field and asked if Giles was OK,
Giles said, "Yeah, I'm just too damn embarrassed to get up."</TE>
<TE>   Giles also had a little beef with the official scorer: "Why didn't
I get an assist?"</TE>

<HD>Former Baseball Coach at Anaheim Canyon Dies</HD>

<AU>Eric Stephens</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hi Lavalle, who coached Compton Dominguez and Anaheim Canyon to
Southern Section baseball championships in his 35 years as a head
coach, died Wednesday of complications from stomach cancer at St.
Joseph Hospital in Orange.</LD>
<LD>   Lavalle, 75, coached at Dominguez from 1958-72 and at Canyon from
1973-92, recording a 453-331-17 record. After winning the 1972
Southern Section title in his final game at Dominguez, he turned what
was then a new school at Canyon into an Orange County baseball power.</LD>
<LD>   At Canyon, he reached three Southern Section title games and won
the 3-A title in 1984 by defeating Lompoc. Nine of his players
appeared in the major leagues, including Ken Landreaux, Jim Rooker,
Rob Deer, Steve Scarsone and Doug Linton.</LD>
<TE>   Lavalle remained on the Canyon staff after his retirement and
worked with the pitchers. He was an assistant to Mike Najera and
coached with his son, Kevin, during the last three seasons under Joe
Hoggatt.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the Canyon program," Hoggatt said. "He started this
program. If it wasn't for him, we wouldn't be where we're at today.
The best thing about him was that he was a teacher. Everyone knew him
and no one had a bad word to say about him."</TE>
<TE>   Lavalle had been hospitalized since June 7 after undergoing
surgery to remove tumors from his stomach.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral services are pending.</TE>

<LD>Maybe Groom On The Run or Slippery When Bet can be the first two-time
winner at Del Mar.</LD>
<LD>   They're matched against each other in today's seventh, a 1
1/16-mile turf allowance for California-breds.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Kirk and Judy Robison and trained by Dean Greenman, Groom
On The Run used a strong late rally to win at today's distance on the
grass by 1 1/2 lengths on July 31. It was the second win in seven
starts for the 3-year-old gray son of Runaway Groom. He will again be
ridden by Alex Solis.</LD>
<TE>   Slippery When Bet, a 4-year-old Russian Courage gelding, had won
six days earlier at 1 1/16 miles on the dirt. The 5-2 second choice,
he prevailed by a neck over California Goal and it was eight lengths
back to third-place finisher Delong.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: California shipper Boozin' Susan will make her
first start for trainer Linda Rice in today's eighth at Saratoga. The
3-year-old French Deputy filly had a bullet drill over the track (47
flat on Aug. 2) and will be ridden by Jose Santos in the allowance
race at six furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Russell Baze. The country's winningest rider in 2002
began the Bay Meadows Fair meet by winning with four of his seven
mounts.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Victor Navarro. The jockey finished Santa Rosa with
only one win from 30 mounts.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Runaway Rubi, Rmisvesta
and Bruheria in the sixth, singling Groom On The Run in the seventh
and using Bet On Brad, Classic Run, Burning Bay, Sarah's Beau and
Fight For Freedom in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 4/29. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $19/$175.60. Total money bet: $222.</TE>

<HD>Prep Stars Lectured on Steroids</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Author of 'Underground Steroid Handbook' says
psychological effect makes it tough to stop.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former steroid user told a group of about 50 elite high school
baseball players competing in the Long Beach Area Code Games this
week about the frightening psychological cycle of the illegal
substance.</LD>
<LD>   "Once you start taking steroids, you're not going to want to
perform without them," said Michael Zumpano, who co-wrote "The
Underground Steroid Handbook" in 1981. "You feel a difference, and
you're not going to even feel like getting on the field if you can't
have them."</LD>
<LD>   Zumpano, 45, used steroids in an attempt to become a bodybuilder,
but he saw some of the damage they caused shortly after his book came
out. Now a vehement critic of their use who runs a Concord-based
nutritional supplement company, he addressed the players as part of
the first steroid-alternative clinic at the Area Code Games. Over two
days, Zumpano spoke to 250 players selected by major league scouts to
compete in the weeklong event at Blair Field.</LD>
<TE>   Twenty-four former Area Code players were taken in the first round
of the 2001 amateur draft.</TE>
<TE>   Zumpano acknowledged the allure of steroid use--"When you see
[major league players] hitting home runs and getting bigger bucks,
it's quite a temptation," he said--but listed nutritional
alternatives that contribute to the maintenance of a strong, healthy
body.</TE>
<TE>   He endorsed nutritional supplements containing creatine, which is
purported to boost muscle mass, and cited a number of recent studies
that showed there were no adverse health effects related to creatine
use.</TE>
<TE>   Zumpano's products have been used by four-time Tour de France
winner Lance Armstrong, Arizona Diamondback star pitcher Randy
Johnson and the Concord De La Salle High football team, which has
posted a national-record 125-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   But Jason Dominguez, a junior pitcher for Chatsworth High, said he
doesn't see the need for supplement use.</TE>
<TE>   "I personally will never put that stuff in my body," said
Dominguez, who is playing for a team selected by Milwaukee Brewer
scouts. "That's just not me. I've gotten this far doing what I do, so
I might as well keep doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Perales, a senior center fielder for Santa Ana Mater Dei
High, said he doesn't understand why players, even at the major
league level, use steroids and told himself he wouldn't ever take
them.</TE>
<TE>   But Zumpano cautioned that the teenage players might not recognize
the need for steroids because they haven't reached the point where
their bodies stop functioning at optimal levels.</TE>
<TE>   "When they start to get up to 26, 28, 30, their body isn't going
to work the same way that it works now when they're 18 or 19," he
said. "But they have to keep the same schedule they always had to
keep. And that's when they're starting to make the big bucks. They
don't want to end their career then. They've got to keep their
performance high at that point. So [steroid use] is a big
temptation."</TE>

<LD>Although it seems impossible to believe, some horse will win
tonight's sixth race.</LD>
<LD>   The eight thoroughbreds in the $2,500 claimer are a combined 0 for
80, but one of them will be a maiden no longer after the 4
1/2-furlong contest is history.</LD>
<LD>   A 5-year-old gray son of Cee's Tizzy, Applicator is the likely
favorite in the second leg of the night's second pick four. Owned by
Jose Gutierrez and Guillermo Nunez and trained by Jesus Nunez, the
gelding is one of only three members of the field who has been second
in a race and he has done that twice.</LD>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Alpine Socialite. 2. Errli Melodi. 3. Chenilles
Dasher. 4. Fra Amici. 5. Danes Degaulle. 6. Applicator. 7. Hot
Diggity Vet. 8. Under My Wing.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Red Ino Go, Alpine Socialite and EG Special in the
first, use Errli Melodi and the Virama-Tetris entry in the second,
single Chenilles Dasher in the third and use Fra Amici, Bobbin Lee
and Fair Adobe in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Flo Joes Legacy makes his first start in
California in more than a year in the fifth. Leeper has his claiming
price halved as he tries for the sixth time to break his maiden in
the sixth.</TE>

<HD>Ramsey Signs With Redskins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One day after his rights were nearly traded to the Chicago Bears,
first-round draft pick Patrick Ramsey signed with the Washington
Redskins on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The quarterback from Tulane received a five-year, $5.7-million
deal with a $3.1-million signing bonus, according to a football
source speaking on condition of anonymity.</LD>
<LD>   However, it's unlikely Ramsey will be included in what is now a
three-way battle among Shane Matthews, Danny Wuerffel and Sage
Rosenfels for the starting job.</LD>
<TE>   "Obviously you can't get four quarterbacks ready to play,"
first-year Coach Steve Spurrier said. "It's hard to get three. We've
been rotating three, and it's worked out pretty well in practice. But
now we're getting closer to the season, you start rotating two."</TE>
<TE>   Ramsey said it was "a definite blow" when he learned he might be
going to the Bears, especially since he has already bought a
townhouse in Northern Virginia. With the trade not completed, he
arrived at training camp late Wednesday with the prospect of playing
for a coach who considered him expendable less than 24 hours earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole deal's been crazy. It's an unfortunate situation. I'm
just thrilled to be here at this point," Ramsey said. "I'm just
learning the way this league works, and I was broken in early, I
guess."</TE>
<TE>   The signing ended a 16-day holdout for the last pick in the first
round of April's draft. The pace of negotiations so frustrated the
Redskins that they contacted Chicago and other teams, but Bear
General Manager Jerry Angelo balked at the asking price of a 2003
first-round pick and second-year guard Mike Gandy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans signed Coach Jim Haslett to a four-year contract
extension. He was in the final year of a three-year deal.</TE>
<TE>   Although Haslett would not say how much the deal is worth, it is a
raise from the base salary of $900,000 in his original contract.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great opportunity to do something over the next few years,
and build something long-term," Haslett said. "You don't want to
build a team that will win one year and then lose and be up and
down."</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Mickey Loomis said the deal puts Haslett in the
upper echelon of NFL coaches. There also is a provision in the
contract that extends the deal by one year each time the Saints win
their division, through 2010.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Safety Leomont Evans walked into the Houston Texans' camp and
insisted his career is not over.</TE>
<TE>   "If everything's fine, I'll be out there," Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   Evans bruised his spine in a collision during the Hall of Fame
Game on Monday night against the New York Giants.</TE>
<TE>   Evans was released from an Ohio hospital Wednesday morning and
spent the night at a Houston hospital for evaluation. He said he
feels fine except for persisting pain radiating down from his neck.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Redskin defensive lineman Santana Dotson, 32, was put on the
injured reserve list after surgery for a ruptured left Achilles'
tendon that could end his career.</TE>
<TE>   The 11-year veteran was injured Tuesday in a pass rush drill
during his first practice of training camp.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Running back Luke Staley's future with the Detroit Lions is
uncertain after he injured a knee that was reconstructed last season
when he was playing at Brigham Young.</TE>
<TE>   Staley, the Lions' seventh-round draft pick, has sat out a week of
practice because of the injury. Coach Marty Mornhinweg said a doctor
gave Staley three options.</TE>
<TE>   "No. 1 is to put the brace on it and play," Mornhinweg said. "No.
2 is to have surgery on the [ligament] again, plus some other
procedures that will make it better again. The third option is to
simply retire.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he will retire. He insinuated that he wants to play
and that he'll wear a brace."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Barry Bonds must wait at least another day for his 600th homer.
Instead, Jeff Kent took all the bows at Pacific Bell Park.</LD>
<LD>   Kent hit an early two-run homer, then slid home with the winning
run on Benito Santiago's infield single in the 10th inning as the San
Francisco Giants beat the Chicago Cubs, 4-3, Wednesday night for
their fourth straight victory.</LD>
<LD>   One night after hitting his 599th homer, Bonds went one for three
with a double and an eighth-inning walk.</LD>
<TE>   Montreal 4, St. Louis 1--Vladimir Guerrero hit his 29th home run
at St. Louis and the Expos sent the Cardinals to their seventh
consecutive defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero needs one homer to become the fifth player to hit 200
before his 27th birthday, which will be Feb. 9.</TE>
<TE>   Tomo Ohka (9-6) gave up six hits in 5 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 7, Florida 2--Roy Oswalt (13-6) gave up three hits in
eight innings and Jeff Bagwell homered and doubled to lead the Astros
at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Daryle Ward and Geoff Blum each drove in two runs to help Houston
win its fourth in a row and 12th of 15.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 6, New York 2--Glendon Rusch stymied his former
teammates and drove in two runs at Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Rusch (6-11) gave up six hits in six shutout innings to win for
the first time since June 25 at St. Louis. He beat Jeff D'Amico
(5-10), who gave up six runs and seven hits in 5 1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 7, Cincinnati 2--Todd Helton hit a grand slam and Larry
Walker hit a three-run homer at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Jennings (12-5) gave up five hits in eight innings and tied
the team record for most victories by a rookie pitcher, which had
been set by Armando Reynoso in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 5, Philadelphia 2--Jake Peavy pitched 6 2/3 strong
innings and Ryan Klesko homered and drove in three runs at San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Peavy (3-4) retired 11 consecutive batters at one point in the
game.</TE>

<HD>Maddux Can't Complete the Job</HD>
<DH>Baseball: He leaves early because of a strained muscle and
Durazo, Finley rally Arizona over Atlanta, 6-3.</DH>

<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Greg Maddux threw five strong innings but left with a strained muscle
in his right side and the Arizona Diamondbacks beat Atlanta, 6-3,
Wednesday night, ending the Braves' seven-game winning streak.</LD>
<LD>   Erubiel Durazo doubled twice, scored two runs and drove in the
go-ahead run in Arizona's three-run eighth inning. Steve Finley had a
two-run double in the inning against former Arizona reliever Darren
Holmes (2-2).</LD>
<LD>   Matt Mantei (2-1) got the victory despite giving up a two-run
game-tying 431-foot homer to Chipper Jones in the eighth.</LD>
<TE>   Plate umpire Angel Hernandez threw out Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox
in the top of the third inning, then ejected pitching coach Leo
Mazzone while reliever Mike Remlinger, who left because of an
undisclosed injury, was being replaced in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Maddux, who has a 1-5 career record against Arizona, gave up one
run and three hits.</TE>
<TE>   Remlinger gave up a leadoff single to Tony Womack in the eighth,
then was replaced by Holmes with a 2-and-0 count on Craig Counsell.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona had taken a 3-1 lead in the seventh thanks to reliever Tim
Spooneybarger's throwing error.</TE>
<TE>   With the score tied, 1-1, Spooneybarger walked Finley. David
Dellucci bounced one to the pitcher, but Spooneybarger's short throw
sailed over the head of first baseman Matt Franco, and Finley raced
home from first.</TE>
<TE>   Catcher Henry Blanco threw Dellucci out at third on the play for
the second out. But Barajas hit Spooneybarger's next pitch into the
left-field seats.</TE>

<HD>Skating Union Joins Bribery Investigation</HD>
<DH>Olympics: At request of IOC, organization will look into
allegations involving reputed Russian mobster.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The International Skating Union has promised to obey a mandate issued
last week by International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge
and will investigate allegations that a reputed Russian mobster
conspired to fix the pairs and ice dance figure skating competitions
at the Salt Lake City Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   Although ISU President Ottavio Cinquanta has characterized the
charges against Alimzhan Tokhtakhunov as "gossip" and has not taken
action, IOC spokeswoman Giselle Davies said Wednesday the ISU assured
Rogge it will look into the matter.</LD>
<LD>   "As stated last week, the ISU have told the IOC that they will
investigate the issue," Davies said. "We have since received
confirmation in writing from them that they will immediately start an
investigation on receipt and after verification of information and/or
evidence from the U.S. Department of Justice."</LD>
<TE>   Tokhtakhunov, a native of Uzbekistan, was charged in federal court
in New York with trying to bribe officials and arrange a deal to help
a Russian pair and a French ice dance duo win their respective
events. He was arrested last week in Italy, where he has a home, and
is being held in a Venice jail. His lawyer, Luca Saldarelli,
requested that he be released and placed under house arrest, and
Judge Giannicolo Rodighiero is expected to rule on that within five
days.</TE>
<TE>   Tokhtakhunov said he plans to resist extradition efforts, which
will prolong the resolution of the case. Tokhtakhunov has said he's
innocent and disputed the legitimacy of wiretapped conversations
cited by U.S. prosecutors in their criminal complaint. Italian police
have also said they have wiretap evidence he might have contacted as
many as six judges in arranging a vote-swapping deal.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Figure Skating Assn., in a letter to Cinquanta made
public Wednesday, urged the ISU "to move with all deliberate speed"
in following through on the decision it made in June during its
Congress to form an ethics commission. USFSA President Phyllis Howard
urged that the new body be independent of the ISU's ruling Council,
which passes judgment on ethics violations.</TE>
<TE>   A USFSA proposal to impose a lifetime ban against judges or
officials found guilty of "misconduct or ethical violations" was
thwarted at the ISU Congress because the language was deemed too
vague to be enforceable.</TE>
<TE>   Howard said she is hopeful the latest scandal --and the Salt Lake
City pairs judging controversy--won't hurt the sport's attendance or
TV ratings.</TE>
<TE>   "We do feel responsibility and we do have to take some steps to
ensure public confidence is restored," she said.</TE>

But Houston may be without forward Tina Thompson, who suffered a
right hip injury in the final seconds of Tuesday's victory over
Cleveland. The Sparks, idle since Sunday's victory over Utah, have a
modest two-game winning streak. But a victory is critical to Los
Angeles, which must fly to Utah after the game for a Friday rematch

<HD>WTA Plans to Keep Event at Manhattan Beach</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The annual WTA tour stop in Manhattan Beach appears to be staying
put.</LD>
<LD>   Management of the Manhattan Country Club and the owners of the
women's tennis tournament held there each August are close to
agreement on a four-year deal to keep the event at the cozy facility,
both sides said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Tournament director Gus Sampras--vice president of the tennis
division for International Management Group, which owns the
tournament--said the deal was "85-90%" complete and probably will be
in place within the next month.</LD>
<TE>   The news is another blow for the Anschutz Entertainment Group,
which is building a state-of-the-art tennis complex as part of its
Home Depot National Training Center in Carson and hopes to lure ATP
and WTA events to the facility.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the promoters of the ATP's annual tour stop at UCLA
said they have 80 years left on a 99-year agreement to keep their
men's tournament at the school and have no intention of breaking it.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras, older brother of tennis star Pete Sampras, said IMG had
talked with AEG about moving the Manhattan Beach event but preferred
to remain.</TE>
<TE>   "Our intention is to stay where we are," Sampras said. "We enjoy
our partnership with the Manhattan Country Club. It's a great,
intimate event and it's appealing to us to keep it in this
community."</TE>
<TE>   The Manhattan Country Club, with a stadium that seats about 5,300,
began hosting the event in 1983, when it moved from the Forum, and
the tournament has enjoyed a rich history, attracting a strong field
each summer. The draw for this year's event, the JPMorgan Chase Open
taking place this week, included five of the world's top 10 players,
among them top-ranked Serena Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Previous champions of the U.S. Open warmup include Williams,
Martina Navratilova, Chris Evert, Steffi Graf, Monica Seles and
Lindsay Davenport.</TE>
<TE>   Davenport, a three-time winner of the event and the defending
champion, said the players enjoy the venue's convenience and its
prime location, within steps of shopping and a resort hotel and only
about a mile from the beach.</TE>
<TE>   The AEG facility, scheduled to open next summer at Cal State
Dominguez Hills, will include a stadium expandable to 13,000 seats.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is, you move it to a huge stadium, where there's tons
of courts, and a lot of times you get half-full or quarter-full
stands watching matches because the stadium is almost too big,"
Davenport said. "Here, the stadium's just about a perfect size for a
women's tennis tournament ... and you really get the crowd into it.</TE>
<TE>   "I like it here. I hope they stay."</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Scott, general manager of the Manhattan Country Club, said
he did not feel threatened by AEG.</TE>
<TE>   "There are disadvantages to the other location that I don't think
can be immediately mitigated, if ever," he said of the Carson site.
"So we're confident that our location is the best location for this
event.</TE>
<TE>   "The location as well as what we have to offer. I think there's
really a distinct difference between competing at a venue of this
nature and competing at a more explicit commercial venue at perhaps a
less desirable location."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Capriati, asked what she'd think of a 24-hour tennis
channel on TV: "I think it would be good, as long as they focus on
the good things and the positive things and don't try to make up
stories. Keep it to the tennis and the good things people should hear
about."</TE>
<TE>   Would she watch? "Maybe," she said. "If I was really bored."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Drug policies in the three other major sports:</LD>
<LD>   NFL</LD>
<LD>   There is random testing by an outside agency throughout the year
for steroids. Ephedrine and related supplements were added July 1 to
the list of banned substances.</LD>
<TE>   The testing for illegal drugs takes place at announced times, such
as at the beginning of training camp, and players selected randomly
by a computer program can be tested during the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   A player testing positive goes into the league program, which is
conducted by an outside agency, and the player is subject to random
testing. In addition, any player who is convicted of a crime
involving illegal substances or alcohol use (such as driving under
the influence) is placed into the program and can be randomly tested.</TE>
<TE>   Penalties are in stages. A first violation results in a player
being placed in the program, and there is no penalty. A second
violation results in a player being subject to a suspension, usually
four games. A third violation results in an indefinite suspension,
most often set at one year. There is an appeal system, with the final
decision up to the commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   Steroid violators can be suspended for four games for a first
violation and six games for a second.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NBA</TE>
<TE>   Some steroids were also added to the league's banned substances
list during the last collective bargaining negotiations, and all
players will be tested when training camps open in October.</TE>
<TE>   Rookies will be tested four times a season on a random basis.</TE>
<TE>   A player also can be tested during the regular season if an
arbitrator decides, after a hearing, there is reasonable cause to
believe a player has used, possessed or distributed any prohibited
substance.</TE>
<TE>   NBA players who test positive at training camp must undergo a
mandatory counseling program. A second positive test results in a
$15,000 fine, and any third or subsequent positive test results in a
five-game suspension.</TE>
<TE>   Penalties for illegal substances such as cocaine, heroin and PCP
are much more severe than those for marijuana. A positive drug
test--or a conviction or guilty plea to a crime involving one of
those drugs--can lead to disqualification from the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone testing positive for steroids gets a five-game suspension
for the first offense, a 10-game suspension for a second offense and
a 25-game suspension for a third offense.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NHL</TE>
<TE>   Similar to baseball policy that has been in place. Only those who
have admitted drug problems or have been convicted of drug problems
are tested.</TE>

<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although the Liberty, Mystics, Fire and Storm might disagree, the
biggest game of the WNBA's regular season will be played tonight when
the Sparks and Comets square off for the third and final time.</LD>
<LD>   The game will go a long way to deciding the Western Conference's
top seeding. Should the Sparks win, they will lead by 1 1/2 games
with three to play. Those final games, against Utah, Minnesota and
Phoenix, are on the road, but it seems a good bet Los Angeles will
win two of them.</LD>
<LD>   If Houston wins, the Comets will take the season series, 2-1. Then
if the teams end the season in a tie, the Comets will have home-court
advantage in the playoffs. Houston finishes the season at home, where
the Comets have won 12 straight, against Sacramento and Minnesota.</LD>
<TE>   The game may serve another purpose. The league's race for the
most-valuable-player award appears wide open, so tonight's game might
eliminate the candidacy of either the Comets' Sheryl Swoopes or the
Sparks' Lisa Leslie.</TE>
<TE>   The league doesn't have an award for comeback player of the year.
If it did, Swoopes would be a unanimous choice. After sitting out the
2001 season because of a torn ligament in her left knee, Swoopes is
very close to the statistics she accumulated during her 2000 MVP
season. She is second to Indiana's Tamika Catchings in WNBA scoring
at 17.9 points a game and in steals, with 82 to Catchings' 84.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie, the defending MVP, is averaging 16.6 points. That's almost
three points below last year's average. But Leslie leads the WNBA in
rebounds, and is second in blocked shots.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie and Swoopes stand tall in an MVP field that includes
Catchings, New York's  Tari Phillips (although, as a center, she
should do better than 6.9 rebounds), and Seattle's Lauren Jackson
(who will split some votes with teammate Sue Bird). Washington's
Chamique Holdsclaw would have been a runaway winner for the award if
she hadn't missed so many games because of an ankle injury.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the real beauty of tonight's showdown will be the game's
intensity level. Respect for each team is considerable on both sides.
So is the contempt.</TE>
<TE>   Houston still considers Los Angeles a paper champion, winning last
year's title only because the Comets lost Swoopes to injury and
Cynthia Cooper to retirement.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks admire the Comets' status as the league's four-time
champion but can't stand listening to the trash talk, or put up with
what they consider is more than just "physical play" by Houston.</TE>
<TE>   It may be just a game, but the result could have a lasting impact
on the teams' playoff psyches.</TE>
<TE>   Too Quiet</TE>
<TE>   There has apparently been no discussion on a new deal between the
players' union and WNBA management negotiators. Nada. Zippo.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it has something to do with the union seeking to have an
independent auditor examine the WNBA's books, and the WNBA owners,
ahem, politely declining.</TE>
<TE>   It was a good idea for both sides to stop speaking publicly on a
new contract to replace the working agreement that expires Sept. 15.</TE>
<TE>   But it's a bad idea, even with this latest charade, that there is
no dialogue being exchanged. Silence, in this case, is not golden.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign Season</TE>
<TE>   Now that the Phoenix Mercury season is all but over, with 10
losses in the last 11 games, Hall of Fame player and TV analyst Nancy
Lieberman is openly campaigning for the head coaching job.</TE>
<TE>   "If they talk to me, I'm the person for that job," Lieberman told
the Arizona Republic. "I know I am. I was very disappointed when
[Cynthia Cooper, who resigned on June 26] got hired. Not to say she
wasn't the one, but I was professionally disappointed."</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman's previous WNBA coaching stint was in Detroit, where she
had a 46-48 record in three seasons. She was replaced by Greg
Williams after the 2000 season.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Seth Sulka has indicated he will talk to several
candidates about the job, including interim Coach Linda Sharp.</TE>

<HD>Afghan Firefight Kills 16</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Raising fresh doubts about security in this troubled Afghan capital,
gunmen assaulted a hilltop army post Wednesday, touching off a
three-hour gun battle that killed 16 people on Kabul's southern
outskirts.</LD>
<LD>   The firefight came a day after U.S. soldiers killed four men in a
car in eastern Afghanistan. That incident was in the same area of
Konar province where Americans killed two men Monday, and Afghan
leaders said the U.S. military operations had made local people edgy
and angry.</LD>
<LD>   Elsewhere, a U.S. soldier was wounded Wednesday while on patrol
south of the eastern city of Khowst near the Pakistani border,
according to Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff. The soldier's name and condition were not released, but Myers
told reporters at the Pentagon that he was wounded in the chest.</LD>
<TE>   Wednesday's battle near Kabul began about 7 a.m. when guerrillas
armed with AK-47 assault rifles rushed an army post on a hill in the
Bagrami district, about six miles south of the center of the capital,
said Col. Haji Rashid, a local police commander.</TE>
<TE>   The army commander for Kabul, Bismillah Khan, said his soldiers
chased the attackers as they retreated to a nearby mountain, then
surrounded and killed them.</TE>
<TE>   Khan's deputy told government television that 12 attackers and
three soldiers died. In addition, a civilian apparently caught in the
cross-fire died, said Maj. Angela Herbert, a spokeswoman for the
multinational peacekeeping force that patrols Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Khan said the assailants were "Arabs and Pakistanis," and his
deputy told national television that they were members of the Al
Qaeda terrorist network. Neither said how this had been determined.</TE>

<HD>IMF, in Its Largest Bailout, Will Lend Brazil $30 Billion</HD>
<DH>Economics: The deal comes amid concerns about instability
spreading through the recession-racked Latin American region.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES</DL>
<LD>The International Monetary Fund agreed Wednesday to its largest
bailout ever, a $30-billion loan to Brazil that comes amid growing
social unrest and political upheaval in South America.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement came at the end of a three-nation tour of the
continent by U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill. The visit
coincided with a major shift in U.S. policy, with the Bush
administration showing increased willingness to rescue the region's
troubled economies.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neill's trip, which ended here Wednesday, also saw $1.5 billion
in bailout funding for Uruguay and a U.S. promise to help speed
assistance to Argentina.</LD>
<TE>   "Brazil is on a solid long-term policy trend which strongly
deserves the support of the international community," IMF Managing
Director Horst Koehler said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The IMF loan may have tossed a lifeline to the moribund candidacy
of ruling-party candidate Jose Serra, the choice of the international
investment community. The decision comes just two months before a
hotly contested presidential election in which polls show Serra
running a distant third to two left-leaning challengers.</TE>
<TE>   A statement from Brazil's Economy Ministry said the government "is
convinced that the [IMF] accord will serve the national interest and
hopes the accord will be supported by the leading presidential
candidates."</TE>
<TE>   Serra praised the agreement, saying "it increases our future
economic security." But the front-runners in the election--both
strong critics of U.S. foreign policy--remained silent.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is the IMF's largest donor and would have had an
important say in the negotiations over the loan.</TE>
<TE>   The IMF agreement also came amid growing concerns about political
instability spreading through a region racked by deepening recession.
In recent weeks, violent protests have hit Uruguay, Peru and
Paraguay. In Bolivia, the radical left made dramatic gains in June
elections.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere has the economic crisis frayed the social fabric as much
as in Argentina, where nearly a quarter of the work force is
unemployed, according to official figures.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill's visit to Buenos Aires on Wednesday was perhaps the most
tense of his trip, with thousands of protesters gathering there for
anti-U.S. demonstrations.</TE>
<TE>   For one day, all Argentina hung on the lisping speech of the
white-haired American in a charcoal suit, the highest-ranking Bush
administration official to visit their country since it suffered a
calamitous financial collapse late last year.</TE>
<TE>   After a downtown news conference here, the climax of a 24-hour
visit, it became clear that Argentines would have to settle for much
less than their Brazilian and Uruguayan counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill offered mostly platitudes, words of encouragement and the
promise of "technical" help with the IMF--but no firm sense of when
Argentina's wait for aid might end.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that with the right polices in place the people of
Argentina will succeed," O'Neill said.</TE>
<TE>   Like most Latin Americans, Argentines feel a deep ambivalence
toward the United States. They believe, correctly or not, that the
fate of their country is in the hands of American officials and
bankers who are not doing enough to help them. But many also believe
that foreign aid has become an albatross that keeps Argentina at the
mercy of outsiders.</TE>
<TE>   "They lend us $100 and then charge us $500 to pay it back," said
Mario Baeza, an unemployed man who joined a demonstration Tuesday
night.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the secretary's itinerary in Buenos Aires was kept a
closely guarded secret, lest he be accosted by the thousands of
Argentines who promised to greet him with ribald chants and burning
Stars and Stripes.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill came, in part, to show Argentines he felt their pain,
despite a history of comments many here consider insensitive. Before
leaving for South America, he suggested aid to Argentina and other
countries might find its way to the Swiss bank accounts of corrupt
officials instead of the needy.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, by contrast, he was deferential and polite, offering
praise to Eduardo Duhalde, Argentina's lame-duck president, who is
leaving office early in the wake of popular discontent against his
economic policies.</TE>
<TE>   "My hopes for Argentina are high," the Treasury secretary said
after meeting with Duhalde and his economy minister, Roberto Lavagna.</TE>
<TE>   For months, U.S. and IMF officials have badgered their Argentine
counterparts to put their fiscal house in order as a condition for
further support. Argentina stopped making payments on part of its
$104-billion foreign debt earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   In Brazil, the new loan is also meant to encourage belt-tightening
policies, even after a new government is elected in October.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. analysts said the IMF loan is designed to try to lock in
current government fiscal policies by making the additional money
contingent on Brazil maintaining its current budget surplus,
excluding debt payments of 3.75% of gross domestic product.</TE>
<TE>   They said that whether the IMF is successful in halting the fall
of the Brazilian currency, the real, and stabilizing financial
markets depends on the reaction of opposition candidates Luiz Inacio
Lula da Silva and Ciro Gomes.</TE>
<TE>   "It really depends on whether they react in a reasonable way,"
said Edwin M. Truman, a former assistant Treasury secretary for
international affairs. "If they do, the [IMF] program has a
reasonable chance of success. If they don't, the whole thing is out
the window."</TE>
<TE>   But the opposition in Brazil--as elsewhere on the continent--is
under pressure to meet the needs of millions of unemployed workers.</TE>
<TE>   During his visit to Argentina, the U.S. Treasury secretary took
pains to show that he, too, cares about those hit hardest by the
region's crisis.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill paid a visit Wednesday morning to a "community kitchen"
that feeds children in Merlo, a poor suburb of Buenos Aires.</TE>
<TE>   Alerted by television reports that an important American had
arrived, hundreds of people gathered outside and whistled loudly when
O'Neill emerged through the front door--he smiled and waved, perhaps
unaware that whistling is equivalent to booing here.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, a much smaller group of leftist demonstrators threw eggs
at his motorcade as it left the downtown Economy Ministry building.</TE>
<TE>   The secretary's car sped past a line of people outside a bank--a
ubiquitous sight here. Across the street, in the Plaza de Mayo,
police were raising barriers to guard government buildings against an
expected anti-O'Neill protest.</TE>
<TE>   "If he had come here with good intentions, he could go to the
Plaza de Mayo without any problems," said Carlos Echaeue, a
66-year-old retiree, who stood near the end of the bank line. "But
the best he's going to do is give more money to the politicians for
them put in their pockets."</TE>
<TE>   Like nearly everyone else in line at the bank, Echaeue was waiting
to buy dollars. He would be exchanging pesos for bills with O'Neill's
signature.</TE>
<TE>   Because of security concerns tied to the protests, O'Neill
canceled two announced stops. One was at a Ford auto plant, where
workers were preparing to plaster anti-American posters across the
factory. He was also a no-show at the Eva Peron hospital in Merlo,
where another large crowd had gathered.</TE>
<TE>   Even before O'Neill's visit, Argentine officials had done their
best to downplay hopes it would lead to quick American aid.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not expecting him to be like Santa Claus, with a bag full
of presents," said Alfredo Atanasof, the president's Cabinet chief.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Peter Gosselin in Washington contributed to
this report.</TE>

<HD>In Rebuke of Taiwan, China Raises Specter of Military Clash</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>China's state-run media said Wednesday that Taiwan faces a greater
risk of military confrontation with the mainland after comments by
the island's leader supporting the idea of a referendum on
independence.</LD>
<LD>   "We must not delude ourselves that the separatists [in Taiwan]
will abandon their pro-independence pursuit overnight," said a
commentary by an unidentified military source in the China Daily. "If
we want to strive for peace, we have to be fully prepared for
military action."</LD>
<LD>   The source stressed that China seeks peaceful reunification of
Taiwan and the mainland, but added that "peace will have to be
safeguarded and won through the use of force" if "radical"
pro-independence moves take place on the island.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, the government of Taiwanese President Chen
Shui-bian canceled a military drill planned for next week to avoid
"misunderstandings," a spokesman in Taipei, the island' s capital,
told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The bellicose rhetoric out of Beijing, though not unusual in the
war of words across the Taiwan Strait, was the harshest in the
current clash between the two archrivals.</TE>
<TE>   Chen surprised many observers with remarks over the weekend that
expressed support for allowing Taiwan's 23 million residents to
decide whether the island should pursue statehood. He told a group of
pro-independence supporters that in reality, there already exists
"one country on each side" of the roughly 90-mile-wide Taiwan Strait.</TE>
<TE>   Chen's Democratic Progressive Party advocates independence for
Taiwan, a former military dictatorship that has transformed itself
into one of Asia's most freewheeling democracies.</TE>
<TE>   But upon his surprise election two years ago, Chen promised not to
do anything to provoke the mainland. He has also made some
conciliatory overtures.</TE>
<TE>   Though still suspicious of his intentions, Beijing responded
cautiously, and some small progress seemed possible.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Chen's government is trying to contain the furor sparked by
his latest comments, which it says were misreported, over-analyzed
and blown out of proportion.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Chen described his remarks as a "statement of
[Taiwan's] sovereignty and parity" with China, but he refrained from
calling the island a separate nation.</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese government's reaction so far has been sharp but less
than what might have been expected. On Monday, it issued an almost
perfunctory statement warning Chen of "disaster" if he continued down
the road to Taiwanese independence.</TE>
<TE>   Even Wednesday's rhetoric appeared only in the China Daily, an
English-language newspaper read mostly by foreigners, and on the
People's Daily English Web site, not its national Chinese print
edition. A separate editorial carried by several mainstream Chinese
newspapers blasted Chen for being provocative, but it did not include
any military threat.</TE>
<TE>   The Communist regime here makes such threats whenever it is
displeased with moves by Taiwan or when it tries to influence events
on the island, such as the election that brought Chen to power.</TE>
<TE>   China watchers are accustomed to periodic statements from Beijing
reserving the right to use force to recapture Taiwan, which it
considers Chinese territory. China's defense minister, Gen. Chi
Haotian, made such a declaration on the nation's Army Day, two days
before Chen's remarks.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the current denunciation of Chen develops into the same
sustained campaign China mounted against his predecessor remains to
be seen.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, then-Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui angered
Beijing by suggesting that the two sides deal with each other on a
"state-to-state" basis.</TE>
<TE>   Chen has dropped that formulation. However, he has also refused to
accept China's assertion that Taiwan and the mainland belong to a
single country. The two have been governed separately since the
Communist takeover of China in 1949.</TE>
<TE>   Polls on the island consistently indicate that the majority of
residents prefer the status quo, neither unification with China nor
independence from it.</TE>

<HD>Promised Land for Donkeys</HD>
<DH>The animals, heroes in the Bible, are used in Mideast
attacks and otherwise mistreated. A determined Briton offers them a
sanctuary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GAN YOSHIYA, Israel</DL>
<LD>Few animals can match the donkey for its biblical reputation.</LD>
<LD>   In the Old Testament, a talking ass saved the prophet Balaam from
doom as they plodded down a road toward the angel of the Lord. Balaam
couldn't see the angel, but the donkey could. The animal's power of
spiritual perception, coupled with its newfound voice, spared rider
and mount from being struck down by the angel's flaming sword.</LD>
<LD>   In the New Testament, Jesus made his final entry into Jerusalem
seated on a young donkey as residents strewed palm fronds in their
path. For Christians, the triumphal ride on Palm Sunday fulfills a
prophecy that the long-awaited Messiah would appear in just this way,
mounted humbly on a colt.</LD>
<TE>   All that renown was millenniums ago. Nowadays, despite its
illustrious pedigree, the donkey is a less-than-exalted creature in
the Holy Land, a gentle beast of burden that can't get any respect.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, what often gets heaped on donkeys is abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Some donkeys here get their ears lopped off by rowdy young boys
for no other reason than sport. Others have been doused with gasoline
and set ablaze or beaten to death with a hammer--also for fun. Many
are painfully hobbled by their owners, who tether them with wire or
rope wrapped so tightly around their hoofs that the restraints become
embedded in the flesh.</TE>
<TE>   The creatures are even vulnerable to the bloody politics that roil
this part of the world. Not long after the current intifada broke out
in September 2000, Palestinian militants tried to use an
explosives-laden donkey cart to kill Israeli soldiers in the Gaza
Strip. The donkey and the cart blew up before they reached the
intended target. A few weeks later, another donkey was killed by a
grenade thrown by Israeli soldiers who feared it was a walking bomb.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, during a Palestinian protest over Israeli
reoccupation of the West Bank, an unlucky donkey, deemed to represent
Israel, was paraded among the crowd and then punished by the
demonstrators, who sliced off both its ears and its tail, according
to animal rights activist Lucy Fensom.</TE>
<TE>   Fensom knows the story because that mutilated donkey is now in her
care--along with 42 others she has rescued from neglect and
mistreatment over the last 2 1/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   Together they live on a four-acre plot of land in Gan Yoshiya, a
small, dust-choked residential neighborhood about an hour's drive
north of Tel Aviv. This is Fensom's Safe Haven for Donkeys in the
Holy Land, a sanctuary she set up for abused and injured donkeys to
live out their days in peace.</TE>
<TE>   From here, Fensom, a 31-year-old transplanted Briton, pursues a
quixotic but impassioned one-woman campaign to save as many of these
animals as possible and to elevate the donkey's lowly status.</TE>
<TE>   Barriers Are Many</TE>
<TE>   It's an uphill battle. Complicating her efforts are cultural
differences, linguistic barriers, a lack of funds and criticism from
those who say she shows more concern for animals than she does for
her fellow human beings.</TE>
<TE>   Fensom knows that her efforts can seem frivolous in a place full
of so much human misery. But she brushes such complaints aside.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, I care about people ... but because humans suffer, it
doesn't mean animals have to suffer as well," she said. "We need
balance in the world. We need people who care about people, people
who care about kids, people who care about old people and people who
care about animals."</TE>
<TE>   Fensom seems to draw inspiration from her surroundings, an ancient
land where donkeys have had roles--even speaking parts--in mystical
stories about the human and the divine.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely feel like there's some higher source driving me to
do this," Fensom said. "It's kind of like I've been chosen.... I feel
like I'm on a mission."</TE>
<TE>   Fueling her missionary zeal is a deep love of four-legged
creatures--about the closest thing there is to a secular religion
back in Fensom's native country. "You know how the English are with
animals," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A British animal rights group gave Fensom the start-up
money--about $60,000--to establish her donkey refuge three years ago.
England itself is home to the world's largest donkey sanctuary, in
Devon, which has taken in more than 8,300 donkeys since its founding
in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   The need for a shelter in Israel occurred to Fensom while she was
working for the Jerusalem Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals in the early 1990s. A haggard-looking donkey was often
hitched near the society's offices, brought by its Bedouin master who
worked in the factory across the street.</TE>
<TE>   Fensom began tending to the donkey when she could and grew
increasingly attached to it. After returning to Britain a few years
later, she arranged for the animal to be shipped there--a mission of
mercy that caused a minor stir in the British media--and lo, the idea
of a promised land for donkeys in Israel was born.</TE>
<TE>   She gave up her job as a British Airways flight attendant and
moved back to Israel to establish her donkey haven in late 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Donkeys, Fensom said, are considered "the lowest of the low" in
the Holy Land, despite their long association with biblical history,
from the ancient judges of Israel who rode on white donkeys to the
stable animals that, by tradition, witnessed Jesus' birth.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the story of Balaam and the talking ass, recorded in the
Book of Numbers, the prophet strikes his mount repeatedly with his
staff until the angel of the Lord reproves him: "Wherefore hast thou
smitten thine ass these three times?"</TE>
<TE>   The donkey's docile, plodding nature and sturdy constitution have
made it an ideal pack animal throughout the Middle East for
centuries. In Israel and the Palestinian territories, donkeys are
used heavily by Arabs and Bedouins for transport and hauling.</TE>
<TE>   Animals Go for $20</TE>
<TE>   They are the grunts of the animal work force--far less prized than
horses, which are expensive and regarded as noble and spirited.</TE>
<TE>   A donkey, by contrast, can be bought for as little as 100
shekels--about $20--so not much value is placed on their welfare.</TE>
<TE>   Every week, Fensom goes on a patrol of nearby villages, looking
out for donkeys tied up in fields, pulling carts or simply roaming
free, abandoned by owners who no longer have any use for them.</TE>
<TE>   She never goes out without two must-haves by her side. One is a
kit stocked with de-worming medicine, antibiotics, syringes,
bandages. The other is a man named Jaber Keadan, a veterinarian from
a nearby town whom she hires to accompany her.</TE>
<TE>   Keadan, an Arab, acts as a fellow rescuer, translator and
mediator, running interference for Fensom in a traditionally
male-dominated society. "It's vital to have him with me, because me
alone, it would never be accepted," she said. "They'd think, 'Western
woman--[she's] mad.' "</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon, under blistering sunshine, the pair went
prowling for donkeys in the town of Taybe, about 15 minutes from Gan
Yoshiya.</TE>
<TE>   Within an hour, they came upon half a dozen of the animals owned
by various local families.</TE>
<TE>   A few appeared to have been treated well, although lack of access
to water was a common problem. But another donkey stood alone on a
dusty slope, three of its hoofs shackled together with a metal chain
and some cord, which had bitten deep into its flesh. The donkey, a
male, was too skittish to let Fensom and Keadan tend the wound,
bucking and braying in fear.</TE>
<TE>   The youth who owned the creature showed little concern for its
welfare. Instead, with some friends, the boy taunted the beast and
chucked sticks and stones at it until Keadan ordered him to stop.</TE>
<TE>   "Why can't he pick on someone his own bloody size?" Fensom
muttered, then turned to Keadan. "Jaber, how do we get through to
them?"</TE>
<TE>   "They do it because they can, because the donkey is rather a weak
animal and won't complain," Keadan explained. "Donkeys are
replaceable."</TE>
<TE>   Keadan, 34, is a soft-spoken man with a bushy beard who trained as
a vet in Romania for seven years. He hadn't given much thought to the
plight of donkeys until Fensom contacted him. What convinced him to
join up with her was the fact that donkeys figure in Islamic
teachings too, not just in Judaism and Christianity.</TE>
<TE>   One Islamic story tells of two fallen soldiers whose acquaintances
are called on by the prophet Muhammad to testify to their character
before burial. Silence reigns, until someone volunteers the fact that
he saw the soldiers solicitously watering the horses and donkeys that
took them into battle.</TE>
<TE>   "I can guarantee you that these two men are in paradise," Muhammad
responded.</TE>
<TE>   The donkeys Fensom takes home with her are usually already
abandoned and therefore more vulnerable to random cruelty.</TE>
<TE>   In rare instances, she has offered to buy donkeys that have
especially grievous injuries. Once, when a crowd of onlookers tried
to prevent her from rescuing two beaten strays, she lapsed into what
she sheepishly calls her "crazy white woman act"--screaming and
cursing and generally being furious. She got the donkeys.</TE>
<TE>   Fensom gives a name to every animal she takes in. (There's no
Eeyore, but there is a Harry Potter.) She can describe every donkey's
temperament and foibles as they shamble about their large pen, the
air thick with the sweet smell of hay and other, less salubrious
odors that attest to the animals' presence.</TE>
<TE>   They come in many shapes, sizes and colors--gray, brown, russet.
Most are females. The males get castrated, though some seem not to
notice and have to be segregated from the general population. "We
call them the Bad Boys," Fensom said.</TE>
<TE>   Blind and Earless</TE>
<TE>   Some of the donkeys have had parts of their legs amputated because
their restraints had gouged so deep that gangrene set in. One donkey
was blinded through mistreatment. A few are missing ears.</TE>
<TE>   Holly and Hannah, two new arrivals brought in by a friend of
Fensom's, had wire wound so tight around their muzzles--for no
apparent reason--that it permanently disfigured them, making their
faces look more like a camel's.</TE>
<TE>   "When I saw the wire in their mouths, I said, 'For God's sake,
what makes people do this kind of thing?' " Fensom said.</TE>
<TE>   The pair are now recovering nicely. Fensom has only once had to
have a donkey put down.</TE>
<TE>   "They're much stronger than horses in their ability to cope," she
said. "If something goes wrong with a horse, they go down like that.
But donkeys are very hardy. Looking at one, you might never know he's
ill. They suffer in silence--that's what we say."</TE>
<TE>   Her work starts practically at dawn every morning and runs through
the evening. A skeleton staff helps keep her 43 charges groomed,
watered and fed.</TE>
<TE>   When not tending the animals, she edits a newsletter and a Web
site (www.safehaven4donkeys.org) for her supporters, most of whom are
back in Britain, where her sanctuary is a registered charity. She is
trying to drum up interest in her "Adopt-a-Donkey" fund-raising
campaign to augment her meager annual budget of about $170,000, which
comes entirely from donations. The landlord wants to raise the rent
on the property, and she worries that her neighbors may start
complaining about the noise and the smell, though so far they've been
understanding.</TE>
<TE>   Fensom would like to expand her project, both in space and scope.</TE>
<TE>   One dream is for Palestinian and Israeli children to come on tours
together to her shelter, where they can learn about the importance of
being kind to animals.</TE>
<TE>   "That," she said, "would be my contribution to the peace process."</TE>
<TE>   Chu was recently on assignment in Israel.</TE>

<HD>Iraqi Strategy Centers on Cities</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Intelligence officials say Hussein plans on
drawing U.S. forces into dangerous urban warfare while avoiding
desert fighting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER and JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has told regional government officials
that he aims to thwart any U.S. invasion by avoiding open desert
fighting and massing his military in major cities where civilian and
American casualties would be highest, current and former U.S.
intelligence officials say.</LD>
<LD>   In meetings in recent weeks, the U.S. officials say, Hussein has
outlined a strategy that appears to center on drawing U.S. forces
into Baghdad and other urban settings where his equipment and troops
would not be as exposed to America's warplanes and high-tech
weaponry.</LD>
<LD>   Hussein's statements have been relayed to U.S. intelligence
operatives through Iraqi defectors and opposition groups in contact
with officials in Hussein's ruling Baath party.</LD>
<TE>   Hussein did not discuss detailed strategy in the sessions,
intelligence sources said, but directed the officials to be prepared
for urban fighting.</TE>
<TE>   His planning appears to be driven partly by lessons from the 1991
Persian Gulf War--in which Iraqi tanks and other equipment were
easily destroyed in the open desert by American aircraft--and by the
significant erosion of Iraq's military capability since then.</TE>
<TE>   Urban fighting is one of the most daunting scenarios U.S. military
planners face. Baghdad in particular is a sprawling setting, where
Hussein's forces would have significant advantages.</TE>
<TE>   Military targets in Baghdad are sprinkled among a population
approaching 5 million. Hussein has constructed an elaborate warren of
underground bunkers and escape routes. U.S. soldiers would probably
have to slog through Baghdad's streets wearing chemical-weapons suits
and carrying extra equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The signals from Hussein come as the White House appears to be
moving forward with plans for war. President Bush and his national
security team were briefed on several options Monday by Gen. Tommy
Franks, head of U.S. Central Command. Reportedly among them was a
so-called inside-out plan in which the United States would strike
Baghdad first in an attempt to decapitate Iraq's military capability
and cause a collapse of the regime.</TE>
<TE>   Given Hussein's signals and the evolving direction of U.S. plans,
military analysts said it appears increasingly likely that any U.S.
invasion would involve significant urban fighting.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost a foregone conclusion," said Michael O'Hanlon, a
military analyst at the Brookings Institution. Hussein "won't fight
out in the desert."</TE>
<TE>   But if the strategic outlines are starting to emerge, experts and
intelligence officials said it is extremely difficult to calculate
how urban fighting in Iraq would play out.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. defense and intelligence officials acknowledge that they
don't know where Hussein is hiding many of his chemical and
biological weapons, let alone how he might use them in a pitched
battle for Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   Experts also say it is difficult to assess how long it would take
for U.S. forces to seize Baghdad, partly because it's hard to know
how long Hussein's elite troops and intelligence agencies would
remain loyal in the face of an American siege.</TE>
<TE>   Bush on Wednesday promised to be "patient and deliberate" in
considering options concerning Iraq but signaled that the United
States remains committed to toppling a dictator accused of developing
weapons of mass destruction and supporting terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "These are real threats, and we owe it to our children to deal
with these threats," Bush said in a speech at Madison Central High
School in Madison, Miss.</TE>
<TE>   White House Debate</TE>
<TE>   The question of how the U.S. deals with those threats has prompted
a fierce debate within the administration.</TE>
<TE>   A number of Pentagon planning documents have been leaked in recent
months outlining options ranging from an Afghanistan-style mix of air
attacks and Special Forces maneuvers to an all-out invasion by as
many as 250,000 U.S. troops.</TE>
<TE>   Amid this saber-rattling, members of the Iraqi parliament vowed
Wednesday to resist a U.S. invasion, and Hussein is scheduled to
deliver a nationally televised address today to anxious citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein's comments on a defensive strategy represent the first
indication of how he intends to respond to any U.S. attack. A former
U.S. intelligence official said he was told of Hussein's comments
during recent meetings with Iraqi dissidents and opposition groups in
London. A U.S. defense intelligence official said American
intelligence has collected similar information and considers it
reliable.</TE>
<TE>   Another U.S. intelligence official said he could not confirm
accounts of Hussein's meetings and was skeptical that such
information would find its way out of the country. But he said an
attempt to force the United States into urban fighting "is the best
of a bunch of bad options" for the Iraqi dictator if the U.S.
invades.</TE>
<TE>   The current and former intelligence officials spoke on condition
they not be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein's apparent aim is to "force the Americans to come in and
create a lot of collateral damage, which will get the international
community to get in and stop the fighting," the former intelligence
official said.</TE>
<TE>   Many European and Arab leaders, including U.S. allies, are urging
the United States not to invade Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The Domestic Factor</TE>
<TE>   Hussein also apparently believes that urban fighting "will inflict
heavy casualties on the Americans," eroding U.S. support at home, the
former official said.</TE>
<TE>   America pulled out of Somalia after 18 U.S. soldiers were killed
in fierce street fighting in Mogadishu in 1993. The fighting was
dramatized in the 2001 movie "Black Hawk Down."</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials said it might not be necessary for U.S. troops
to enter Baghdad and engage in street fighting. Rather, advances in
precision-guided weapons could enable the United States to hit almost
any important target by air. And if Hussein holes up in one of his
many bunkers, they said, U.S. forces could choke off the city and
wait him out.</TE>
<TE>   One complication for military planners is assessing the allegiance
of Iraqi troops, particularly the elite Republican Guard.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think Hussein would survive long," said a former CIA
official with extensive experience in the region. "But that's the
problem: We don't know what the breaking point is for his supporters.
Does a solid month of B-52 strikes do it, or do we need people on the
ground?"</TE>
<TE>   Some former Iraqi military officials insist that Hussein's regime
would crumble quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Former Gen. Najib Salhi, who defected in 1995, said in a recent
interview that Hussein's forces would turn on him the moment U.S.
troops started to roll toward Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   "Only a few hundred will stay loyal to Saddam until the last
minute," Salhi said. "Everybody in Iraq will be against him.... It's
going to be a big collapse, like a building demolished with
dynamite."</TE>
<TE>   But military experts said the United States can't afford to count
on that and that airstrikes may not be adequate to seize the city.
Hussein survived bombing of his hiding spots during the Gulf War, and
the U.S. may not be willing to wait out a desperate dictator with
chemical weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have a sense that [Hussein's] various praetorian guard
formations are guerrillas or house-to-house fighters," said John Pike
of GlobalSecurity.org, an independent defense policy group. "But if
the thing does not spontaneously fly apart, and if it does turn out
there are substantial numbers of armed people prepared to resist, it
could be real nasty."</TE>
<TE>   It's possible, Pike said, "that it takes a week for U.S. forces to
get from Kuwait to the west side of Baghdad, then three months to get
to the east side of Baghdad."</TE>
<TE>   A Postwar Decline</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's capabilities have eroded significantly since the end of the
Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein has been unable to maintain much of the machinery used to
fight the war because Iraq relied on foreign technical experts to
service its French and Russian aircraft and other equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Morale is so low that regular army troops would probably defect in
large numbers, leaving only a corps of 100,000 Republican Guards
defending Hussein, defector Salhi said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Iraq retains the most formidable military in the Persian Gulf,
with 424,000 men, 2,200 tanks, 3,700 other armored vehicles and 2,400
artillery pieces, according to the Center for Strategic and
International Studies.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps half its 316 combat aircraft remain capable of carrying
out missions.</TE>
<TE>   Military analysts consider it likely that U.S. soldiers would face
chemical or biological weapons if they fought an urban battle in
Baghdad, because Hussein would have little to lose.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, he killed thousands of Kurds and Iranians with
chemical weapons. His forces dispersed chemical weapons during the
Gulf War but did not deliver them, according to a CIA report.</TE>
<TE>   "He will not hesitate to use these weapons," said Salhi, adding
that Hussein's storage and delivery of such weapons left them
unreliable.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq has planes equipped with chemical "sprayer" tanks and has
experimented with unmanned planes that CIA officials believe have
been modified to disperse chemical or biological agents.</TE>
<TE>   A United Nations report has concluded that Iraq may have hidden as
many as 6,000 chemical weapons from U.N. weapons inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   "The end result is likely to be that Iraq would succeed in
launching some [weapons of mass destruction] strikes against U.S.
coalition forces, targets in neighboring states, and/or Israel,"
Anthony H. Cordesman, a military strategist at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, concluded in a recent study of
military options against Iraq.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>ANKARA, Turkey</DL>
<LD>A key Iraqi opposition figure said Wednesday that his group would not
"blindly" commit to any U.S. plan to topple President Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   "We have made no decision yet to participate or not in the
attack," said Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan, one of two Kurdish factions controlling northern Iraq. He
was in Ankara for a meeting with Turkish leaders before flying to
Washington for meetings with U.S. officials and other opposition
figures.</LD>
<LD>   "We are not for blindly participating in any attack or in any
plan," Talabani said after talks with Turkish Foreign Ministry
officials. "We are not in favor of having a new dictatorship
replacing the old one."</LD>
<TE>   The leader of the other major Kurdish faction, the Kurdistan
Democratic Party, said last week that his forces would not get
involved in a U.S. attack without assurances of their future autonomy
and safety.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi Kurds control an autonomous zone in northern Iraq that could
become a key base if U.S. forces tried to oust Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Talabani told Turkey's private NTV television he was
confident that the Iraqi opposition could unite against Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a high possibility of unifying the opposition," NTV
quoted him as saying. "I think a new front will emerge."</TE>

<HD>Palestinian Cabinet Backs Pullout Deal</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Officials tentatively approve plan in which
Israelis would leave some occupied areas in exchange for a crackdown
on militants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. MICHAEL KENNEDY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>The Palestinian Cabinet gave tentative approval Wednesday to a deal
in which the Israelis would withdraw from some occupied areas in
exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on militants living there.</LD>
<LD>   But after Palestinian and Israeli security officials met to work
out specifics, an aide to Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat said Israel had imposed new conditions that were "impossible
to accept."</LD>
<LD>   Nabil abu Rudaineh wouldn't give details but called the session a
failure. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli side.</LD>
<TE>   As the deal was debated, the Israelis launched raids in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip in their latest effort to arrest or kill
operatives who they say are instrumental in the attacks that have
left more than 600 Israelis dead in the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian reaction to the proposed Israeli withdrawal had been
mixed, with some of the leadership contending that the only
acceptable deal is a pullout from all Palestinian enclaves.</TE>
<TE>   But Israeli Defense Minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer was adamant that
the first withdrawals be something of a pilot project, in which the
Palestinian Authority would be rewarded with more pullouts if it was
successful in keeping militant groups such as Hamas under control.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good step and a political step as long as it leads to the
full withdrawal from Palestinian areas," said Palestinian Planning
Minister Nabil Shaath.</TE>
<TE>   Ben-Eliezer told Shaath this week that Israel wants to begin the
pullback in the Gaza Strip, where the Palestinian security apparatus
is still largely in place. The Israelis have occupied some parts of
Gaza for almost two years and reoccupied seven of eight West Bank
cities in June in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent attacks, most of
them suicide bombings.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to tentatively accept the Israeli withdrawal plan
came as a senior Palestinian delegation left for Washington for talks
with U.S. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. However, the militant
Hamas organization rejected the "Gaza first" proposal, characterizing
it as an Israeli public relations ploy. Ismail abu Shenab, a senior
Hamas official in Gaza, said the proposal was intended to dampen
international criticism of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, Israeli troops launched well-orchestrated
raids throughout the West Bank and Gaza in which at least five
Palestinians were killed and many more were arrested.</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank town of Tulkarm, Israeli troops backed by
helicopter gunships and armored vehicles stormed a building in the
early morning, killing four Palestinians, including one wanted for
more than a year in connection with the execution-style slayings of
two Israeli restaurant owners.</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis surrounded the home of Ziad Mohammed Daas, a local
leader of the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militia affiliated with
Arafat's Fatah movement. In the ensuing gun battle, Daas was killed
by an Israeli sharpshooter after the Palestinian had fled to the roof
of his building. An additional 15 Palestinians were arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Israel also launched a daybreak raid in Bethlehem, arresting
Yehiyeh Daamseh, an explosives expert who had been the object of an
intense Israeli search for months. He is accused of having
orchestrated several suicide bombings, including one in Jerusalem
last March in which 11 Israelis were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the Israelis arrested Daamseh, his home was razed by
bulldozers. The soldiers carried out the demolition two days after
Israel's Supreme Court ruled that such action was permissible.
Palestinian security officials said the Israelis discovered an
explosives belt inside the house.</TE>
<TE>   And after a night in which Israeli troops moved closer to Gaza
City to conduct house-to-house searches, another Palestinian militant
was shot and killed as he stood on the roof of his home. Hussam
Hamdan, 27, a member of Hamas, was shot by Israeli snipers in the
Gazan town of Khan Yunis.</TE>
<TE>   In northern Israel, an Israeli Arab was indicted in Nazareth on
Wednesday and charged with failing to tell authorities that she knew
a suicide bomber was on board the bus that was blown up Sunday,
killing nine people.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment charges Yassra Bakri, 28, of the Arab village of
Beineh with not telling anyone after the suicide bomber warned her to
get off the bus. She and a friend got off and the two caught a taxi,
which followed the doomed bus for about 20 minutes, the indictment
said. The taxi passed the bus when it stopped to pick up passengers
at the Meron junction, where the explosion occurred. Israel Radio
said the woman had several friends who remained on the bus.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a tanker truck loaded with almost 4,000 gallons of fuel
was blown up by a bomb Wednesday in the Tel Aviv suburb of Rishon Le
Zion. The driver was only slightly injured because he had stopped at
a gas station to have his brakes checked and was not in the truck.</TE>
<TE>   In Ramallah, the Palestinian city just north of Jerusalem, a
firing squad executed a convicted killer and rapist in the courtyard
of Yasser Arafat's compound just as Cabinet members were arriving for
their meeting about the Israeli withdrawal offer.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir Atari, 26, who escaped the compound jail when Israeli
forces entered the headquarters in June, was brought by car with his
hands tied behind his back. He was allowed to speak with a Muslim
cleric before being executed.</TE>

<DL>KUMHO, North Korea</DL>
<LD>Amid fireworks and applause, North Korean officials and
representatives of a U.S. government-led consortium marked a new
phase in the planned construction of two nuclear reactors Wednesday.
But a senior U.S. official said the North wasn't complying with the
terms of the deal.</LD>
<LD>   Under a 1994 U.S.-North Korean agreement, the consortium was to
build the reactors to meet the Communist country's desperate need for
power. In exchange, the North said it would freeze its suspected
nuclear weapons program and allow international scrutiny.</LD>
<LD>   North Korea has yet to open its facilities to inspections by the
International Atomic Energy Agency.</LD>
<TE>   North Korea "must start meaningful cooperation now" with the
agency "and must comply with all of its obligations," said Jack
Pritchard, a State Department official.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA suspects that the North might have stockpiled enough
plutonium to make one or two atomic bombs. Pyongyang denies it.</TE>
<TE>   Pritchard said the North's failure to allow inspections, which
would take three to four years, could undermine the $4.6-billion
reactor project. Political tension and funding problems have delayed
it for several years, prompting criticism from North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Pritchard spoke at a cement-pouring ceremony at the reactor site
in Kumho, a remote, coastal region near the border with Russia.
Attending were 100 government representatives from the United States,
Japan, South Korea and the European Union, all members of the
consortium.</TE>

<HD>Saudis Say They Won't Give Access for Iraq Hit</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JIDDA, Saudi Arabia</DL>
<LD>The Saudi government will not give the United States access to bases
for an attack on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, but its foreign
minister said Wednesday that the kingdom does not intend to expel
American forces from an air base they now use for flights to monitor
Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   In an interview, Prince Saud al Faisal said the U.S.-Saudi
alliance is as solid now as it was before Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   He said Osama bin Laden, who was stripped of his Saudi
citizenship, sought to drive a wedge between the two countries when
he chose 15 Saudi citizens to be among the 19 hijackers who took part
in the terrorist attacks on U.S. targets.</LD>
<TE>   As for a possible strike on Iraq, Saud said, "attack is not the
right policy to take."</TE>
<TE>   Opposition to a U.S. move to overthrow Hussein is gaining strength
in Europe as well.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview published Wednesday, German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder said military action would wreck the international front
fighting terrorism worldwide, throw the Mideast into turmoil and hurt
the world economy.</TE>
<TE>   Saud said his government has made no secret of its opposition to a
U.S. strike on Iraq. Asked if the kingdom would allow the United
States to use Saudi facilities for such an attack, the prince said:
"We have told them we don't [want] them to use Saudi grounds."</TE>
<TE>   The United States reportedly has quietly moved weapons, equipment
and communications gear from Saudi Arabia to Al Udeid Air Base in
Qatar in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said that talk
of a U.S. strike against Hussein was hypothetical and that President
Bush had not asked the Saudis for use of their territory.</TE>

<HD>Discord Intrudes on Eve of Talks</HD>
<DH>Mideast: The head of a Palestinian team meeting with U.S.
officials today criticizes Bush's demand for new leadership to enact
reforms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The United States today begins the first high-level talks with
Palestinian officials since President Bush called for a new
leadership to replace Yasser Arafat as a condition for establishing a
Palestinian state in three years.</LD>
<LD>   But the two-day talks produced conflict even before they began.
Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat on Wednesday rejected the
Bush administration's call for alternative leaders to mediate the
implementation of political, economic and security reforms.</LD>
<LD>   "That cannot be acceptable," said Erekat, who will head the
three-member delegation in Washington. "Where do you think I come
from--from Mars? I am part of President Arafat's leadership."</LD>
<TE>   Erekat also warned at a news conference that removing or
marginalizing Arafat, the Palestinian Authority president, would
produce chaos.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians will hold talks today with Secretary of State
Colin L. Powell and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice on
political and security issues, followed Friday by discussions with
the U.S. Agency for International Development on the Palestinians'
worsening living conditions.</TE>
<TE>   The talks are expected to be a test of whether Bush's strategy to
revive the peace process, outlined in his June 24 speech, is likely
to go anywhere anytime soon.</TE>
<TE>   The strategy is a carrot-and-stick approach: holding out the
incentive of statehood on condition of overhauling Palestinian
institutions and ending violence against Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "The purpose of these meetings will be to hold discussions and
exchange views on a wide range of issues, including Palestinian civil
reform efforts, a renewal of security cooperation [and] progress on
political dialogue," State Department spokesman Philip T. Reeker
said.</TE>
<TE>   But the real issue for the Bush administration is whether the
United States and the Palestinians can agree on reforms that will
change the Palestinian system enough to limit Arafat's power or
supplant him.</TE>
<TE>   "We want in the end a political system that provides for real
separation of powers and no concentration of authority in any one
person or position and a legislature that really functions as it
should in a democratic order," said a senior administration official
who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the three leaders coming to Washington are new appointees
to the Palestinian Authority Cabinet. Powell has praised both Economy
and Trade Minister Maher Masri and Interior Minister Abdel Razak
Yehiyeh as "individuals that seem to be not only asserting authority
and trying to work on the transformation, but seem to be acting with
authority."</TE>
<TE>   The administration is also looking to promote Palestinian-Israeli
cooperation so that the two sides can test a pilot project in which
Israel withdraws troops from a few areas, to be replaced by a new
Palestinian security force trained by Egypt and Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   But an end to the wave of Palestinian attacks and suicide bombings
is critical to getting that project off the ground. U.S. officials
have a "strong message" for the Palestinians that nothing significant
can happen until the violence decreases, the administration official
added.</TE>
<TE>   The administration is playing down prospects of any breakthroughs
or major agreements. This is expected to be the first of several
rounds of talks, according to the State Department.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an opportunity to have an exchange of views. We met a
couple of weeks ago with a similar delegation from Israel, and now we
are meeting with a delegation of Palestinians," Reeker said.</TE>

<HD>Tobacco Tax Might Fund Preschools</HD>
<DH>Education: Plan targets 100,000 children in L.A. County.
Critics worry about quality control.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA RIVERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A local commission with the power to dole out tobacco tax money to
programs for children is expected to take up a proposal today that,
if approved, would attempt to give every toddler in Los Angeles
County free access to full-day preschool.</LD>
<LD>   If successful, proponents say, it could recast the lives of
thousands of ordinary families and become a model for communities
across the nation.</LD>
<LD>   But some child educators question whether the still-sketchy
proposal to establish universal preschool in Los Angeles County is
wishful thinking on a grand scale.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, some warn that it could create a cottage industry that
would be impossible to monitor for quality while diverting millions
of dollars away from other needs.</TE>
<TE>   Those starkly divergent views are expected to come to a head today
as the Los Angeles County Children and Families First Commission,
which oversees Proposition 10 tobacco-tax revenues, is set to decide
whether to spend that money to make preschool available to all
families that want it, regardless of income.</TE>
<TE>   The plan would seek to provide opportunities to more than 100,000
Los Angeles County children who today cannot find a place in a local
preschool and would cost upward of $100 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Even as today's vote approached, details of the proposal still
were being negotiated. But some aspects were taking shape Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates said they want to target 3- and 4-year-olds initially,
for instance, and to dramatically expand the region's existing
child-care services, including Head Start programs, child-care
centers and the number of home-based child-care providers.</TE>
<TE>   According to backers of the preschool idea--including filmmaker
and child advocate Rob Reiner, who spearheaded the 1998
proposition--the programs that the tobacco money would pay for would
stress reading and math skills but also try to provide low- and
middle-income families with access to child-care services that
otherwise would be too expensive for them to afford. The initiative
would pay to train new preschool teachers and to find new spaces for
preschools.</TE>
<TE>   It would first be targeted at neighborhoods with low-performing
schools, because studies show that children living in these areas are
the ones who most benefit from early education.</TE>
<TE>   The aim of advocates is to enroll at least 70% of the county's
300,000 3- and 4-year-olds in the voluntary program.</TE>
<TE>   Still to be determined is exactly how families would access the
program, how much it would cost per child and how caregivers who
qualify to operate preschools would be paid.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably one of the most important investments that Prop. 10
could make," said Yolie Flores Aguilar, who directs the county's
Children's Planning Council. "Los Angeles County has one of the
weakest child-care systems in the state. But I have to come at it
from the vantage point of the child. My worry is that so little is
known about what this would mean. I'm waiting to see the details."</TE>
<TE>   The stakes of the debate extend even beyond its implications for
educating local children. Backers hope that the county can become a
model for the nation, creating new opportunities for young people
despite geographic challenges and an enormously diverse population.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles County could be a beacon if they pass this," said
Helen Blank, child-care program director for the Children's Defense
Fund, a Washington, D.C.-based child advocacy group. "Preschool is
one of the first building blocks in education reform. Study after
study shows that it makes a difference in how children will do when
they reach school."</TE>
<TE>   Failure, however, could dampen efforts to expand such programs.
The worst-case scenario, according to child educators, would be to
have Los Angeles stumble into an ill-conceived program that sticks
kids in low-quality care and does nothing to prepare them for
kindergarten.</TE>
<TE>   Across the state, 58 county commissions are administering money
supplied to them by Proposition 10, which levies a 50-cent tax on
every pack of cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   Some have used revenues from the cigarette tax for prenatal
services, parent training and other programs.</TE>
<TE>   But there has been no attempt to marshal the money for a program
as broad as universal preschool.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, the commission that administers the local
share of the tax revenue receives about $160 million a year, though
that amount is expected to decline as smoking decreases.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents said a fully mapped plan of action is not likely to be
available for months.</TE>
<TE>   But the nine Proposition 10 commissioners will be presented today
with a set of objectives and strategies that could begin rolling out
over the next year and stretch into the next decade.</TE>
<TE>   Teresa Nuno, director of programs and planning for the Los Angeles
County commission, said the plan will address quality, availability
and affordability of the programs, and will make suggestions as to
how the county might manage to recruit and train people needed to
care for children.</TE>
<TE>   The plan calls for creating a single set of standards for
preschools regardless of their setting and recommends establishing a
credentialing program for teachers and caregivers. It also would
create an independent body to monitor preschools and evaluate the
program.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the preschool proposal acknowledge that tobacco
taxes will not provide enough money to pay for the entire effort, but
they say they hope to enlist state and federal help as the program
takes hold.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an amazing opportunity to spark a larger debate and bring
in more resources," said Ben Austin, a spokesman for Reiner. "Prop.
10 can't do it alone and wasn't designed to. Los Angeles can show
that it can be done and bring others on board, because it's going to
require general funds from the state and from the feds and a lot of
public will."</TE>
<TE>   State officials say that if the measure passes, they will be
looking at Los Angeles closely as a model for other cities. But they
promised no money.</TE>
<TE>   "We applaud the Prop. 10 commission for getting focused on
something that could potentially have great impact for Los
Angeles--and because L.A. is so large--for the state of California,"
said Secretary of Education Kerry Mazzoni. "But given the budget
deficit, right now we can't contemplate any kind of additional
expenditures."</TE>
<TE>   A recent UC Berkeley study found that at least 100,000
preschool-aged children in Los Angeles County are on waiting lists
for subsidized care.</TE>
<TE>   But although many educators agree that providing quality preschool
is an important goal, some remain dubious about the proposal being
debated in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   They are especially skeptical that home-based child-care providers
could be trained to provide the kind of care needed.</TE>
<TE>   "What you don't want to do is simply pay more money for a system
you already have," said Steven Barnett, a Rutgers University
professor and director of the National Institute for Early Education
Research.</TE>
<TE>   "If you give family child-care providers the responsibilities for
the educational preparation of kids, you have to give them the
qualifications," Barnett said. "And if they get the qualifications,
how can you possibly afford to pay them a teacher's salary? I think
the answer is you can't."</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Wangling TV interviews with high-profile newsmakers has never been a
pretty business: The competition between shows is intense and the
ethical lines fuzzy. But some TV news veterans say the feeding frenzy
reached a new level of hysteria last weekend, when the ABC, NBC and
CBS morning news programs battled it out for an interview with the
two Antelope Valley girls who had been rescued after a kidnapping.</LD>
<LD>   Since Monday, when NBC's "Today" show aired an exclusive interview
with the two girls, the three programs have traded allegations of
dirty tricks, none on the record, and none agreeing on the exact
details of what happened. One producer was said to have swerved into
another on the highway; one was said to have sobbed to the girls that
she would be fired if the interview didn't take place. Another was
alleged to have called the police to complain that the competition
was stalking the girls, in order to keep them away.</LD>
<LD>   The only thing those involved agree on is that fighting it out
over two underage girls who had just been through a harrowing
kidnapping and rape ordeal was an unseemly indicator of the
high-stakes pressure in the business.</LD>
<TE>   "These kids and families are simply not used to this kind of
thing," said Dr. Billy Pricer, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department chaplain in Lancaster who has been serving as the girls'
therapist. Because of the trauma they went through and the newness of
the media frenzy, he said, "it's easy for them to be swayed by
whoever has possession of them at the time." He said he was
"disappointed that there wasn't more cooperation."</TE>
<TE>   The competition has been ratcheted up in recent weeks due to a
confluence of nail-biting, tear-jerking stories--a spate of child
kidnappings and a dramatic rescue of coal miners--and new cable
personalities such as CNN's Connie Chung trying to put themselves on
the map. The free-for-all atmosphere has blandishments flying,
producers playing cat and mouse, and jilted networks charging that
the opposition is using ethically questionable practices.</TE>
<TE>   In the weekend dust-up, NBC admits that a producer for "Today"
bought one interviewee $80 worth of clothes, using an NBC credit
card. An NBC News spokeswoman said that the clothes were bought after
the interview was secured and that the employee bought them "because
she felt bad for someone going through such an emotional time."</TE>
<TE>   The action violated NBC News' policies, and network sources said
the employee has been suspended for about a week and the division is
meeting with employees to reiterate its policies. The spokeswoman
said she couldn't comment on the specifics of an internal personnel
matter.</TE>
<TE>   It turns out that was only one element of a ferociously
competitive effort for network supremacy.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous local and national media outlets converged on the
Antelope Valley late last week hoping to land interviews, no doubt
inspired by the willingness of one of the victims to talk to the
media. Pricer said he passed some requests along to the girls and
Glen Scott, an uncle of one girl, said he got requests through the
hospital where they were treated.</TE>
<TE>   One request came from the "Today" show's Katie Couric, already in
Los Angeles to tape an exclusive interview with Priscilla Presley.
After many conversations and family meetings, Scott said his niece
decided to do just one interview, with the "Today" co-anchor. "I made
a suggestion that Katie Couric would be a good choice. She's
responsible, and she would be respectful," Scott said.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking only for his family, he said that there was never any
intention to do interviews with ABC and CBS, and that "there was no
coercion; we weren't forced to do this, we weren't bribed." He added,
"I'd like the world to know she's a responsible journalist and a
wonderful human being."</TE>
<TE>   But Pricer, who had been in contact with the other girl's family,
thought there would be three interviews: Couric, followed by the
others, "one, two, three," at a Lancaster-area Marriott hotel. ABC
and CBS also thought they'd be interviewing the girls.</TE>
<TE>   At the last minute, Pricer said, he was told to go to a different
hotel, a move ABC and CBS sources allege was an effort by NBC to keep
the girls away from its rivals. ABC and CBS went to the second hotel,
where NBC had booked most if not all of the rooms, and they set up
cameras in a public area, hoping to catch the girls after they
finished with NBC.</TE>
<TE>   That made the families uncomfortable, Pricer said, and they asked
him to tell ABC and CBS to return to the Marriott, where the girls
would return later. The networks complied, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But then, he said, something changed, and he points to NBC. "I
witnessed them saying [to the girls], 'You shouldn't do the
interviews,' " he said. "They were adamant."</TE>
<TE>   Later, he said, NBC whisked the girls off in limos for an
undisclosed location.</TE>
<TE>   ABC and CBS didn't get the interviews they thought they were
getting. An NBC source said it had always understood that the
interview was exclusive.</TE>
<TE>   As one NBC employee said, "No one should walk out saying they are
very pleased with how people acted. It was inappropriate for 'Today'
to buy a gift for the guest, but all the bookers on the scene acted
inappropriately."</TE>
<TE>   Not true, said Shelley Ross, executive producer of ABC's "Good
Morning America": "I'm very proud of the professionalism and
integrity of our booking department. Everybody does play by the rules
here."</TE>
<TE>   As for whether law enforcement got involved, ABC and CBS sources
said the local police confronted them at the hotel, saying there had
been a charge they were stalking the girls. An NBC source said they
called the police at the request of the families, to escort the girls
out. Scott said he saw no police when he left the hotel with his
niece.</TE>
<TE>   And the Lancaster authorities can't corroborate that they were
called to the scene. "I'm not aware of any problem with the media at
all," said Sheriff's Capt. Tom Pigott. "I know [the girls] have
reached celebrity status. I'm sure that will wax and wane."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Andrew Blankstein contributed to this report
from Lancaster.</TE>

<HD>TV Appearance of Teen Victims Suggests Rape Stigma Is
Fading</HD>
<DH>Attitudes: Openness about the ordeal is a sign that the
crime is less a cause of guilt and shame.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NORA ZAMICHOW</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Days after being abducted and raped, two Antelope Valley teens went
on national television.</LD>
<LD>   As cameras rolled, Tamara Brooks, 16, and Jackie Marris, 17, told
of being tied with duct tape and rope, of their drunken captor
loading his gun and threatening their lives. They described how they
later attacked him, one girl stabbing him in the neck and the other
smashing his face with a whiskey bottle. They spoke of watching their
captor die in a shootout with sheriff's deputies.</LD>
<LD>   Critics harpooned the girls' parents for allowing the NBC "Today"
show interview and being dazzled by a chance at celebrity rather than
focusing on the recovery of their children. But experts say the TV
appearance points to a shift in how people view the victims of sexual
assault.</LD>
<TE>   The stigma, they say, is not what it used to be. The girls'
appearance marks a new attitude of empowerment, the sense that they
have no cause for shame.</TE>
<TE>   "Twenty years ago, no one talked about rape," said Marie Lena,
president of People Against Rape. "We've gone from 'Don't talk' to
'Stand up and talk.' "</TE>
<TE>   In general, people are more open to talking about sex, said
clinical sexologist Ava Cadell, who credits President Clinton with
ushering the topic of oral sex into America's living room.</TE>
<TE>   This loosening up, she said, also included thornier topics such as
sexual assault. "In my work with rape victims, it's no longer as
taboo as it was. Women don't have the guilt and shame that they did.
And people are not pointing fingers saying, 'It's your fault.' "</TE>
<TE>   This year's highly publicized accusations against priests may also
be contributing to an environment in which it is easier for victims
to reveal their experience, said Tamara Kreinin, president of the
Sexuality Information and Education Council.</TE>
<TE>   "When there are a series of cases, people are more comfortable
talking and feeling supported by society," Kreinin said. "When
something is talked about a lot, a social norm of support is
created."</TE>
<TE>   In the past, most women did not report being raped, experts said.
They wouldn't tell family members or police because they felt the
crime cast doubt on their integrity and intentions. Even 20 years
ago, many people still viewed rape victims as women whose behavior or
attire elicited sexual assault.</TE>
<TE>   Today, rape is seen as a crime "not of passion but of anger,
control and domination," Lena said. The antidote is to restore a
sense of safety, power and trust. Over the years, the notion that
speaking out is both empowering and therapeutic has gained momentum.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, TV news and talk shows are happy to comply.
Getting exclusive interviews from victims has become big business.
Bookers for TV shows often tell victims they will feel better.</TE>
<TE>   Those involved with treatment of rape victims disagree. "Talking
in a therapy relationship is different than being on national
television," said Gail Abarbanel, director of the Rape Treatment
Center at Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   After the girls' rescue, The Times followed its longtime practice
of not naming sexual assault victims without their permission. The
practice, established to protect victims' privacy, was waived after
Tamara and Jackie agreed to tell their story on television.</TE>
<TE>   In explaining why she agreed to the TV interview, Tamara Brooks
said , "It wasn't like I was pressured one way or the other. It was
up to me. My parents said whatever I felt comfortable doing, they
were behind.</TE>
<TE>   "Me and Jackie want to get the message across to everybody to
never give up on anything," she said. "If you ever give up, you've
lost. Whatever obstacles you have, you've got to fight your way
through it."</TE>
<TE>   Tamara was also clear that she and Jackie wanted to keep some of
their privacy. "It's just retelling the story and it's not hard to
talk about it, but I let everyone know there are certain things I
will not talk about and I think everybody knows what I'm talking
about."</TE>
<TE>   Tamara's father, Sammie Brooks, said he believed the public
spotlight would help his daughter recover.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she's having fun with the publicity," said Brooks, a
teacher at Antelope Valley College. "People wanting to see her and
have her on TV and magazines is good healing for her."</TE>
<TE>   Brooks, who is separated from Tamara's mother, said he hasn't seen
his daughter since he picked her up after the rescue last Thursday.
Since then, his daughter has been "on tour," he said. "It gives her
something to draw on so the horror of the experience will be
balanced."</TE>
<TE>   Billy Pricer, a therapist working with the girls and their
families, said the teens "felt they needed to get their story out to
help other young girls."</TE>
<TE>   "It's very therapeutic," Pricer said. "They have a good
attitude--you can either get better or get bitter. And, they chose to
get better."</TE>
<TE>   Jackie and Tamara have been inundated by interview requests for
the past week. Hollywood producers wanted to buy the rights to their
story. Three network morning news shows wooed them.</TE>
<TE>   At first, the girls decided to go on all the morning shows, but
said they were talked out of it by NBC staffers after they agreed to
appear with Katie Couric on the "Today" show. (Tamara said she
thought Couric was "really cool and sweet.")</TE>
<TE>   Couric's exclusive interview aired Monday. NBC officials have
since disclosed that the show's booker bought Jackie an $80 pair of
pants, a violation of NBC's standards. The purchase was made after
the girls agreed to appear, said Allison Gollust, spokeswoman for the
"Today" show. "The booker felt bad for someone going through such an
emotional time," she said.</TE>
<TE>   During the interview, which was taped in Lancaster, Tamara and
Jackie finished each other's sentences. They exchanged knowing
glances. They reached out for each other's hands.</TE>
<TE>   They told Couric about their abduction, their struggle with their
captor and their rescue. But there was one word they never uttered:
Rape. Nor did Couric.</TE>
<TE>   NBC spokeswoman Gollust said there were no restrictions set for
the interview. "We believe our questioning of them was appropriate
given the circumstances," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The closest that Couric got to asking about rape was when she
inquired: "Did he hurt you in any way?"</TE>
<TE>   Tamara quickly shut down the question, saying: "Yes, but that's
something we won't discuss."</TE>
<TE>   Several experts felt the omission was telling.</TE>
<TE>   "What's significant is they're not talking about the one part of
the crime that no one wants to talk about," Abarbanel said.</TE>
<TE>   Rape remains an underreported crime, she said. One in six women is
the victim of a rape or attempted rape, Abarbanel said. Of those, 16%
are reported to police, she estimated. The statistics, she said,
indicate the stigma many victims still attach to the crime. "Always
behind silence is a sense of shame."</TE>
<TE>   The teens' appearance on national television shows progress, said
Nancy Raine, author of "After Silence: Rape and My Journey Back." "In
an ideal world, all [rape] survivors would love it if this was a
crime like all other crimes, where if it came up that you'd been
raped, it would not plunge the listener into silence and discomfort."</TE>
<TE>   Others said the TV interview is evidence that victims were
becoming emboldened. "Increasingly, women are unwilling to be silent
victims," said Linden Gross, author of "Surviving a Stalker."</TE>
<TE>   Today, Tamara Brooks said she is comfortable with her new fame.
"It's fine. I guess you could say I'm like a celebrity."</TE>

<LD>   Residents of the Rogue River Canyon hamlet of Agness held their
ground as prevailing winds kept the Florence forest fire at bay and
firefighters extended defense lines.</LD>
<TE>   Florence burned six miles from Agness, which has a population of
about 150.</TE>

<HD>Springsteen Delivers a 9/11 Message for His Fans</HD>
<DH>Music: The rocker opens U.S. tour not far from where
terrorists struck in N.Y. It was an emotional night in an area where
many of the nearly 3,000 attack victims lived.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GERALDINE BAUM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Any Bruce Springsteen concert is a festival of emotions, but rarely
more so than here Wednesday night as the veteran rocker opened his
U.S. tour across the river from where the World Trade Center towers
fell 11 months ago.</LD>
<LD>   Springsteen's new compact disc, "The Rising," is a reflection on
the nation's resilience and mourning in the months after the
terrorist attack, and the New Jersey native wasted no time in giving
the hometown audience songs that expressed what many had seen and
felt on Sept. 11 and what has continued to haunt them.</LD>
<LD>   Backed by the E Street Band, Springsteen opened the concert at the
Continental Airlines Arena with the album's title song, a statement
of optimism and faith that is built around these uplifting lines:</LD>
<TE>   Come on up for the rising</TE>
<TE>   Come on up, lay your hands in mine</TE>
<TE>   Come on up for the rising</TE>
<TE>   Come on up for the rising tonight</TE>
<TE>   While most people were standing, they began whooping and swaying
after that refrain. They knew what Springsteen was referring to when
he sang about the ascension of the firefighters with a "60-pound
stone" on their backs and a "half mile of line" on their shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   Later, however, there were tears on the faces of some fans as
Springsteen turned to melancholy tunes from the new album, including
"Empty Sky" and "You're Missing," both expressions of loss.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the evening was not all somber. During the cheerful "Waitin'
on a Sunny Day," the arena house lights were turned on briefly as the
audience sang the lyrics to the new song back to Springsteen. He
smiled for the first time in the concert and said, "I'm very
impressed."</TE>
<TE>   The show's setting, of course, gave the evening an especially
poignant edge. Many of the nearly 3,000 people killed on Sept. 11
were from New Jersey, including more than 150 from nearby Monmouth
County, where Springsteen owns a farm.</TE>
<TE>   The evening's mood kept changing, with most of the 11 new songs
bringing people to respectful attention and old songs, like 1975's
"Thunder Road" and 1984's "Glory Days," driving them back to carefree
years when a midweek concert and several beers didn't seem like such
a stretch.</TE>
<TE>   During "Glory Days," the house lights went on and people looked
around at each other, apparently unembarrassed to be shaking rounder
stomachs and singing lyrics with meaningful expressions. Yes, they
were all still here, another communal marker in what has been a tough
year for New Yorkers and their neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Max Cripe, 51, in a Boston College sweatshirt, grabbed his wife
during "Glory Days" and started swinging her around. She pushed him
back and giggled.</TE>
<TE>   Before singing "Mary's Place," from the new album, Springsteen
explained that it was inspired by his memories of being 12 years old
at the Jersey shore with his family. The song inspired such an
uplifting of people's spirits that Springsteen shouted, "Turn it up,
turn it up, turn it up!" as if to see how far they'd go.</TE>
<TE>   Springsteen--who also performed such earlier tunes as "Born to
Run," "Prove It All Night" and "Badlands"--used "Mary's Place" to
introduce his band members, teasing each one, even making a Viagra
joke when he introduced his backup singer and wife Patti Scialfa.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Henderson, a Wall Street money manager, came to the concert
with his wife and the widow of one of his best friends, a Cantor
Fitzgerald broker and Springsteen fan who died on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   They had, he said, all rocked together at many Springsteen
concerts over the years, and this one was another of those "firsts"
after the death--for the widow and Henderson who has attended 47
Springsteen concerts.</TE>
<TE>   "People who aren't here are still going to be with me, with us, as
we sit inside that arena," said Henderson in the parking lot before
the concert. He stopped talking suddenly and put on his sunglasses
even though this subdued tailgate party was in the shade.</TE>
<TE>   Charlton Bulkin, who came here from Atlanta, said he had to be in
New Jersey to experience the words, the music, the man in the place
close to where it all happened on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "Springsteen has this uncanny ability to paint a huge picture, a
mural, with just a couple of words," said Bulkin, 29. "These songs
reached me, helped me figure out what I was feeling."</TE>
<TE>   The new album--whose first-week sales of 525,000 were the highest
opening week for any Springsteen album since Nielsen SoundScan began
monitoring U.S. sales a decade ago--marks the second dramatic step in
Springsteen's return to his '80s role as a dominant creative and
commercial force in rock.</TE>
<TE>   As his sales dipped after the break-up of the E Street Band in the
late-'80s, Springsteen's relevance in rock was frequently questioned.
But his 1999 reunion tour with the band was widely seen as a triumph
and dates for the new tour, which includes an Aug. 24 stop at the
Forum in Inglewood, have been instant sell-outs.</TE>
<TE>   Though the album's themes and the accompanying tour could lead to
charges of exploitation, Columbia Records has been careful in the
marketing and promotion of "The Rising" to avoid any mention of Sept.
11.</TE>
<TE>   "If it was almost anybody else, I'd have a more cynical view of
this," said Jeff Pollack, a media consultant for music and radio
channels worldwide. "But when it comes to Bruce, he has shown too
many times that he is the real deal."</TE>
<TE>   Springsteen has promoted the new CD ceaselessly. In the last two
weeks, he has appeared on the covers of Time magazine and Rolling
Stone, as well as appearing on the "Today" show, "Late Night With
David Letterman" and "Nightline" with Ted Koppel.</TE>
<TE>   Pollack said that kind of promotion is important in getting music
exposed in today's marketplace, pointing out that even groups like U2
must energetically promote new albums to get them to sell in large
numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "The more complex the album--musically and lyrically--the more
difficult it is to get air time," Pollack noted, adding, "Nothing is
automatic anymore when you consider how many entertainment
opportunities people have nowadays. Nothing."</TE>
<TE>   After the nearly 2 1/2-hour concert, Jimmy Steal, program director
of KPWR-FM in Los Angeles, said he felt the hardcore fans had come to
hear the new material, and seemed captivated.</TE>
<TE>   "Bruce comes, he inspires, he rocks and then he leaves," said
Steal.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no pretension here tonight and in a world where
everything, everything, involves two or three layers of hype, he
walks a straight line."</TE>
<TE>   Another fan, Mick O'Hare, an electrician from south New Jersey,
mumbled to no one in particular as he slowly made his way through the
crowd out of the arena, "I'm tired but I needed that."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Robert Hilburn in Los Angeles contributed to
this report.</TE>

<HD>President, in Miss., Takes Tough Stand on Business Fraud</HD>
<DH>Visit: He expresses sympathy for those who lost jobs,
savings over WorldCom and repeats a desire to see dishonest officers
do 'hard time.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MADISON, Miss.</DL>
<LD>President Bush came here Wednesday to express his sympathy for the
thousands of Mississippians who lost their jobs and their savings
because of WorldCom Inc., the telecommunications giant headquartered
nearby that filed for bankruptcy last month amid accusations that its
executives defrauded investors.</LD>
<LD>   "You know what it means to be let down by shady corporate
practices," he told 1,000 flag-waving, foot-stamping people packed to
the rafters in a sweltering high school gym.</LD>
<LD>   As he vigorously denounced "corporate malfeasance," Bush also
reiterated his desire to see dishonest executives do "hard time" for
"cooking the books."</LD>
<TE>   In a brief visit to a region of the country known for its
multimillion-dollar jury awards in personal injury cases, the
president also inveighed against "junk and frivolous" lawsuits,
saying that they threaten the well-being of the national economy.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's late-morning remarks here overlapped a speech in San
Francisco by Vice President Dick Cheney. The split-screen
juxtaposition served as a fresh reminder that the rash of corporate
scandals continues to cast a cloud over the Bush administration, with
lingering questions dogging both the president and the vice president
over their own business practices before taking office.</TE>
<TE>   In his remarks, Bush sought to redirect the debate as he focused
on corporate reform and issued an animated call on Congress to impose
limits on medical malpractice reform.</TE>
<TE>   "People who dedicate their lives to building the company who hired
them deserve better--not only here in Mississippi but all over the
country," the president said.</TE>
<TE>   In calling for federal limits on malpractice suits, he declared:
"Too many frivolous lawsuits in this state are being filed against
doctors.... And too many juries' awards are out of control."</TE>
<TE>   Before his speech, Bush met privately with 10 area residents,
including doctors, nurses and one laid-off WorldCom employee.</TE>
<TE>   Bush reported afterward that they are "disillusioned, like me and
others, about the corporate fraud which is taking place in our
country."</TE>
<TE>   Before returning to his ranch near Waco, Texas, the president
spoke at a $1-million Republican fund-raiser, with the proceeds
divided evenly between Rep. Charles W. "Chip" Pickering (R-Miss.) and
the state GOP.</TE>
<TE>   Pickering's reelection bid is noteworthy on several counts.</TE>
<TE>   Because Mississippi lost a House seat in reapportionment after the
2000 census, Pickering faces another House incumbent, Democrat Ronnie
Shows.</TE>
<TE>   It has become a bellwether race--and a test of the Democratic
Party's broad-brushed effort to tie Republicans, including Bush and
Cheney, to the corporate scandals.</TE>
<TE>   A victory by Shows could provide Al Gore with a new sense of
vindication for his controversial 2000 campaign message of "the
people versus the powerful."</TE>
<TE>   Shows' campaign mantras have included "Jobs, greed and trade" and
"Little guy versus big guy."</TE>
<TE>   Shows' campaign believes that such themes have a special resonance
here because of WorldCom, whose two top executives, accused of hiding
billions of dollars in expenses and lying to investors, have been
charged with securities fraud, conspiracy and filing false statements
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Pickering, an ex-legislative director for Senate Minority Leader
Trent Lott (R-Miss.), is the son of a federal judge Bush nominated to
the U.S. Court of Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   That nomination was defeated in a straight party-line vote by the
Senate Judiciary Committee in March after he was strongly criticized
by women's, civil rights and liberal organizations.</TE>

<HD>Tiny Skipper Butterfly Makes Endangered List</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RENO</DL>
<LD>A thumbnail-size butterfly found only in northwestern Nevada and
northeastern California was given permanent protection Wednesday
under the Endangered Species Act.</LD>
<LD>   The listing published in the Federal Register makes permanent an
emergency action taken in November by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service to protect the Carson wandering skipper.</LD>
<LD>   "We know of only two populations of the skipper, and both are
threatened with habitat destruction," said Bob Williams, supervisor
of the Fish and Wildlife Service in Nevada.</LD>
<TE>   "Butterflies are important environmental monitors," he said. "They
react to slight changes in their habitat, which can be a signal that
something is wrong in that area."</TE>
<TE>   One small population of skipper is found in California's Lassen
County near Honey Lake, the other in Warm Springs Valley north of
Reno, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   The Fish and Wildlife Service, which is charged with enforcing the
Endangered Species Act, took the emergency action last year out of
concern that pending water export projects and other threats would
doom the skipper butterfly to extinction.</TE>

<HD>Jets' Vapors, Temperature Linked</HD>
<DH>Science: The 9/11 flight ban let scientists track the
disappearance of cirrus clouds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Newsday</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>An unexpected experiment--the sudden three-day grounding of air
traffic after last September's terrorist attacks on New York and the
Pentagon--shows that high-altitude jet contrails are having an
important effect on temperatures, scientists said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Because thousands of commercial flights were canceled after the
disaster, the researchers said, a thin blanket of cirrus clouds that
often forms from water vapor exiting jet engines in high traffic
corridors was absent. The lack of clouds allowed daytime temperatures
at ground level to rise and nighttime temperatures to fall.</LD>
<LD>   The researchers said the loss of cloud cover caused by the
grounding of commercial planes led to a 3.5-degree Fahrenheit
increase in the difference between the highest day temperature and
lowest night temperature over the United States. Their report showing
the human impact on temperature was published in today's issue of
Nature.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the first really concrete evidence that jet contrails are
influencing temperature," said climatologist David Travis at the
University of Wisconsin, lead author of the study. "Prior to now,
most of the evidence was circumstantial.... No one had actually
looked at temperature data to see if we could detect a contrail
influence."</TE>
<TE>   Atmospheric scientist Stan Chagnon, who spent his career at the
University of Illinois studying the cirrus cloud phenomenon, stated:
"Here is the proof, baby. It's right there. It's irrefutable proof of
the effect of contrails on climate."</TE>
<TE>   The high-altitude cirrus clouds are thought to reduce heating
during the day by blocking some sunlight, and prevent cooling at
night by keeping infrared energy from radiating away into space. The
result is less of a difference between day and night temperatures.</TE>
<TE>   For about 50 years scientists have tried to understand whether
contrails from aircraft are doing anything. More than 30 years ago,
atmospheric scientist Walter Orr Roberts, founder of the National
Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., was showing
time-lapse movies illustrating how the thin white stripes from jets
spread out--and sometimes cover much of the sky.</TE>
<TE>   In the new research after Sept. 11, Travis and colleagues from
Pennsylvania State University gathered data on maximum and minimum
day and night temperatures from 4,000 weather stations within the 48
coterminous states. They looked back as far as 1971, comparing those
data to the recent three-day no-flight period.</TE>

<HD>Forecaster Lowers Hurricane Estimate</HD>
<DH>Weather: Expert puts season prediction at nine due to
changing Atlantic conditions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Tropical Storm Cristobal spun harmlessly at sea off the North Florida
coast Wednesday as a noted hurricane forecaster said recent climate
changes signal an unexpectedly quiet Atlantic hurricane season.</LD>
<LD>   Colorado State University professor William Gray, who has had some
success in predicting the severity of hurricane activity in the past,
lowered his prediction for the current season from 11 named storms,
an above-average season, to nine, a below average one.</LD>
<LD>   A strengthening El Nino, the Pacific warm-water phenomenon that
tends to diminish Atlantic hurricane activity, and cooling Atlantic
surface temperatures, increasing sea pressures and the strengthening
of tropical Atlantic easterly trade winds set the stage for the
reduced forecast.</LD>
<TE>   "We have rarely witnessed the rapid and simultaneous types of
Atlantic basin hurricane-inhibiting conditions that have taken place
between April and July this year," Gray said in a news release.</TE>
<TE>   On May 31, the day before the start of the six-month Atlantic
hurricane season, Gray predicted 11 named storms and said six would
become hurricanes, two of those "major" storms with winds of more
than 111 mph.</TE>
<TE>   His revised forecast released Wednesday predicted nine named
storms, four hurricanes and only one major hurricane. He also said
the probability of a major hurricane hitting the U.S. coast was 49%,
below the long-term average of 52%.</TE>
<TE>   Three weak tropical storms have already formed in the Atlantic,
Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico this year.</TE>

<HD>Bush Blamed on Child Health Funds</HD>
<DH>Programs: California and three other states received
improper waivers, GAO finds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A government report released Wednesday faulted the Bush
administration for allowing federal funds to be diverted from
programs serving poor children.</LD>
<LD>   The administration exceeded its legislative authority in granting
California and three other states special permission to use child
health funds for other purposes, according to the General Accounting
Office. The administration's actions, it said, could deprive some
children of health insurance even in states other than the four cited
in the report.</LD>
<LD>   The report prompted two senior senators to contend that the
waivers approved for the states violate federal law and pit poor
children against adults in the struggle for limited health-care
funds.</LD>
<TE>   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and Charles
E. Grassley of Iowa, the committee's top-ranking Republican, said
they would take legislative action if necessary to prevent the
administration from continuing to let funds intended for the State
Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) be diverted.</TE>
<TE>   The GAO report was issued just days after a separate study found
that nearly 5 million poor children who qualify for the SCHIP program
remain unenrolled and uninsured.</TE>
<TE>   "These children should never have to compete with childless adults
for the use of remaining SCHIP funds," Baucus and Grassley wrote in a
letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson.</TE>
<TE>   The report by the GAO, the nonpartisan, investigative arm of
Congress, also chastised the Health and Human Services Department for
making "inappropriate and impermissible" budget calculations and for
failing to adequately inform the public about the proposed changes.</TE>
<TE>   The charges leveled by the GAO and other critics of the waiver
policy echoed what has become a common criticism of the Bush
administration: that its policymaking process sometimes leaves
Congress and the public out of the picture.</TE>
<TE>   "The real issue is what's at stake and who is looking after the
interests of low-income beneficiaries" of the Medicaid and SCHIP
programs, said Diane Rowland, executive director of the Kaiser
Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured.</TE>
<TE>   The waiver process, in which state and federal officials negotiate
behind closed doors, allows states to radically restructure their
programs without the input or oversight of Congress, state
legislatures or the public, she said.</TE>
<TE>   HHS officials, who had already responded in writing to the GAO and
the Finance Committee leaders, renewed their defense of the waiver
process.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is not getting health insurance as a result of this
program," said HHS spokesman Bill Pierce. Thompson "wanted to allow
states to be as creative and have as much flexibility as possible,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   About 40 million low-income families and children received health
coverage last year under Medicaid--the program for low-income
families and senior citizens and the disabled--and under SCHIP, which
provides health care to children whose families are not poor enough
to qualify for Medicaid. Expenditures for the programs were $232
billion last year.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government provides more than half the funds for the
two programs--the states pay the rest--and the states have to follow
certain guidelines to qualify for the federal money.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the basics, however, states may offer as many benefits to
as many people as they choose. Some two-thirds of Medicaid spending
goes for "optional" services, mostly nursing home care for the
elderly and disabled.</TE>
<TE>   The SCHIP program contains yet another administrative wrinkle:
Congress appropriated a fixed amount of money, $10 billion over 10
years, and specified that money left unspent by one state could be
reallocated to others. The Congressional Research Service said last
year that 19 states had spent less than 25% of their SCHIP funds.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration, which supports a shift of government
power to the states, has encouraged state governments to tailor their
Medicaid and SCHIP programs more closely to their own needs, as long
as such changes still meet the program's basic obligations and do not
require increases in federal funding. As virtually all the states
have suffered revenue shortfalls in the last year, more and more have
looked to Medicaid and SCHIP for spending cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen states have applied to HHS for Medicaid or SCHIP waivers.
So far, the administration has approved four of them:</TE>
<TE>   * California, hoping to increase the number of children enrolled
in the Healthy Families program, was allowed to use unspent SCHIP
funds to cover uninsured low-income parents and guardians of eligible
children. Gov. Gray Davis, citing the state's budget woes, has
delayed the expansion.</TE>
<TE>   * Arizona was told it could use SCHIP funds to cover adults who
have no children.</TE>
<TE>   * Utah expanded its Medicaid program to enroll more adults but
reduced the number of health services covered under the program and
increased patient co-payments.</TE>
<TE>   * Illinois won a waiver to use Medicaid funds to expand
prescription drug coverage to low-income seniors.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the administration's requirement that waivers entail no
new costs, the Utah and Illinois waivers will cost the federal
government millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Baucus and Grassley objected most strenuously to the Arizona
waiver.</TE>
<TE>   "You should not continue to approve waivers that divert funds set
aside by Congress for children to insure childless adults," they
wrote to Thompson.</TE>

<CX>   Child health--A story Thursday in Section A on the diversion of
federal health funds from poor children reported that four states had
received permission from Washington to use child health funds for
other purposes. Only two states, Arizona and California, received
such permission, and California has not yet taken advantage of its
new flexibility. The other states, Illinois and Utah, have diverted
funds from other health programs.</CX>

<HD>Military Is Missing 2 Computers</HD>
<DH>Security: The laptops belong to Central Command, which runs
Afghanistan operations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>TAMPA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Two computers are missing from the Florida headquarters of the U.S.
Central Command, which is running the military operation against the
Taliban and Al Qaeda forces in Afghanistan, a military spokesman said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "I can confirm two computers are missing. An investigation is
underway," said Lt. Col. Martin Compton of Central Command, located
at MacDill Air Force Base here.</LD>
<LD>   Compton would not say what the missing computers were used for or
how long they had been gone. But in Washington, Air Force Gen.
Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told
reporters that one of the missing computers was believed to contain
classified material.</LD>
<TE>   The disclosure came two days after a government report said the
FBI, Immigration and Naturalization Service, and three other Justice
Department law enforcement agencies had found that at least 775
weapons and 400 laptop computers were stolen, lost or missing over a
recent two-year period.</TE>
<TE>   Asked at a Pentagon briefing about the problem of security, Myers
said it was not clear what happened to the computers.</TE>
<TE>   "In the end, security comes down to individual responsibility," he
said. "It comes down to your trust and confidence in the people that
work there. And you do all the appropriate checks and all that sort
of thing to ensure that the people have the right background."</TE>
<TE>   Central Command is responsible for military operations in most of
the Middle East and nearby areas. It uses units from all the U.S.
military services.</TE>
<TE>   Several U.S. allies that have sent forces to Afghanistan have
representatives at Central Command headquarters, including Britain,
Canada and Australia.</TE>

<HD>D.C. Mayor Loses Effort to Get on Ballot, Vows Write-In
Drive</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Mayor Anthony Williams renewed his pledge to conduct a vigorous
write-in campaign Wednesday after the District of Columbia's Court of
Appeals rejected an eleventh-hour attempt to get his name on the
Sept. 10 Democratic Party primary ballot.</LD>
<LD>   Campaigning amid rush-hour commuters at a subway stop in Northwest
Washington, Williams vowed to "take my message to every voter on
every street in the city."</LD>
<LD>   A reform candidate who four years ago wowed the city's
professionals with promises to revitalize the local economy and
invigorate a sluggish bureaucracy, Williams was breezing toward
reelection when calamity hit.</LD>
<TE>   Aides charged with collecting 2,000 signatures on petition drives
turned in 10,102. But most were clear forgeries--page after page of
signatures in identical handwriting or in the name of celebrities,
including U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, actor Kelsey Grammer and
British Prime Minister Tony Blair--none of whom is a registered voter
in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The D.C. Board of Elections and Ethics, finding the petitions
tainted by the specter of fraud, kicked Williams' name off the
ballot, leaving voters with a field of long-shot candidates, such as
Faith Dane, a 79-year-old exotic ballet dancer.</TE>
<TE>   A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals upheld the board
Wednesday, saying it had "substantial evidence in the record
supporting its conclusion that the integrity of the nominating
process had been undermined by forgeries and possible fraud."</TE>
<TE>   In a city that votes overwhelmingly Democratic and
liberal--Democratic Party nominee Al Gore got 85% of the vote in
2000, and Green Party candidate Ralph Nader almost beat Republican
nominee George W. Bush (6% to 9%)--the failure to make the Democratic
primary ballot is significant. But Williams, who could lose his
$1.4-million war chest if he runs as an independent, has vowed to
mount the write-in campaign for the Democratic nomination.</TE>
<TE>   "I am energized and have spent the past several weeks out in the
community talking to voters and hearing their thoughts," Williams
said in a statement issued by his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Los Angeles, the 51-year-old Williams is a son of the
Ivy League--he has degrees from both Yale and Harvard--and is known
for sporting bow ties and using arcane references in his public
speeches. "Running this city is like Roebling trying to build the
Brooklyn Bridge and digging and digging for the bedrock," he said of
early efforts to clean up the city's padded payroll and inefficient
services.</TE>
<TE>   On first being elected four years ago, Williams was embraced by
the city's elite, who had grown embarrassed by the personal excesses
of Marion Barry, a 12-year mayor who was convicted of drug
possession.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, Williams' reputation is on the line. But Williams'
press secretary, Tony Bullock, says the petition imbroglio has
energized the mayor. Waving an unsharpened pencil at supporters
Wednesday evening, Williams said he hoped that voters would sharpen
their pencils and come out to vote on Sept. 10.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Cauman, a woodworker who has lived in Washington for 29
years, said he planned to vote for the mayor, despite differences
over neighborhood issues. "He gives us a good image," he said. "He's
why the city is thriving."</TE>

<HD>2 Nevada Teens Sentenced for Beating Muslim Men</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RENO</DL>
<LD>Two teenagers have been sentenced to up to 40 years in prison for the
baseball bat beatings of two Muslim men outside a Sparks mosque.</LD>
<LD>   David Nolette and Scott Cannady must serve at least 14 years under
the sentence handed down by Washoe District Judge James Hardesty for
last year's beating of Dr. El Tag Mirghani and Mohammed Sanad.</LD>
<LD>   The youths were also ordered to pay $563,000 in restitution to
Mirghani and $850 to Sanad.</LD>
<TE>   Mirghani suffered serious brain injuries and was forced to give up
his medical practice. Sanad suffered a broken arm.</TE>
<TE>   The March 16, 2001, beating and robbery occurred as Mirghani and
Sanad left an evening prayer service at the Northern Nevada Muslim
Community Center in Sparks.</TE>
<TE>   According to testimony, the youths sought money for drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Nolette was 15 at the time of the attacks. Cannady, who pleaded
not guilty by reason of insanity, was 17. Both were convicted on four
counts each of battery and robbery with a deadly weapon and
conspiracy to commit robbery.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors acquitted Nolette of attempted murder and deadlocked on the
same charge against Cannady. Prosecutors decided not to retry him on
that count.</TE>
<TE>   Police rejected the view that the attack was a hate crime.</TE>

<HD>Energy Dept. Rule Eases Claims Process for Nuclear Workers</HD>
<DH>Health: White House reversal, expected today, will end
contractor appeals over medical panel findings that illnesses are
job-related.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Under pressure from Congress, the Bush administration has decided to
reverse policy and quit fighting illness compensation claims from
Cold War-era nuclear weapon workers who were exposed to toxic
chemicals.</LD>
<LD>   Final Energy Department regulations expected to be issued today
instruct contractors not to contest medical panels' findings that
workers' illnesses are related to job exposure.</LD>
<LD>   The new rules reverse a decades-old policy and differ from a draft
proposal circulated earlier this year that allowed contractors to
contest such findings, and even said the Energy Department would help
pay for appeals.</LD>
<TE>   Lawmakers from states with nuclear weapon plants said the
administration's original proposal ran counter to the intent of a
bill Congress passed two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears that DOE has addressed the major concerns that were
raised about the draft rule last spring," said Sen. Fred Thompson
(R-Tenn.).</TE>
<TE>   Thompson added that more workers now could be compensated.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Miller, a policy analyst with the Government
Accountability Project, a Washington watchdog group, said Energy
Secretary Spencer Abraham "overrode his own staff and really deserves
some credit for reversing some of the flaws in the previous rule."</TE>
<TE>   The rule is aimed at helping thousands of workers across the
country who were exposed to toxic substances at Energy Department
facilities run by government contractors.</TE>
<TE>   Those workers were not included in a year-old federal program that
provides medical care and $150,000 each to weapon plant workers made
ill by exposure to radiation or silica and beryllium, which cause
lung diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Congress told the Energy Department to help such workers
file claims under state workers' compensation systems.</TE>
<TE>   "This rule is directed at ensuring that DOE assists as many of
those contractor employees, who may have been exposed to toxic
substances while working at DOE facilities, as possible in obtaining
the state workers' compensation benefits they deserve," Abraham said.</TE>
<TE>   Uniform Guidelines</TE>
<TE>   Under the new rule, the Energy Department will establish a uniform
standard for physicians to consider when determining what made a
worker sick.</TE>
<TE>   "A single causation standard rather than 50 different state
standards is a major help," said Sen. George Voinovich (R-Ohio).</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers also praised the uniform standard for being generous
rather than restrictive. It says a claimant should be reimbursed if
exposure to a toxic substance on the job was "a significant factor in
aggravating, contributing to or causing the worker's illness or
death."</TE>
<TE>   The new regulations also provide that only a majority vote is
needed to find in favor of a claimant; that change compares to a
unanimous vote required under the old policy.</TE>
<TE>   The potential cost of claims is in the hundreds of millions of
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Many weapon plant contractors are self-insured and are reimbursed
by the Energy Department for workers' compensation costs.</TE>

in the 1980s. The Mount Clemens, Mich., native also was convicted of
armed robbery in suburban Detroit and served time in his home state.</TE>

<HD>Bush Plan Would Give States Leeway on Clean Water</HD>
<DH>Resources: The federal government would lose veto power on
pollution programs. The changes would create loopholes,
environmentalists warn.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In what environmentalists say is a significant rollback of the Clean
Water Act, the Bush administration has decided to amend a critical
water pollution program to give states much greater leeway in
deciding which waterways need to be cleaned and crafting plans to do
so.</LD>
<LD>   Under this proposal, the federal government would not have power
of approval over state plans for cleaning waterways, but instead
would "trust the states," according to an EPA outline.</LD>
<LD>   Environmentalists warned that the proposal, which is still being
drafted, would undermine the landmark 1972 legislation, which has as
its primary goal to make all waterways suitable for fishing and
swimming.</LD>
<TE>   But EPA officials countered that they are responding to the advice
of a National Academy of Sciences' panel, which called for a more
science-based approach to the federally mandated program that
requires states to clean up lakes, rivers and other bodies of water.</TE>
<TE>   The goal is to give states "more cost-effective and better ways to
manage the program," said Benjamin H. Grumbles, deputy assistant EPA
administrator for water.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal, which would not require congressional approval to
implement, reflects the Bush administration's emphasis on giving
states more authority over a broad range of government programs, a
trend that environmentalists resist because most states traditionally
have been less aggressive than the federal government in forcing
industries to clean up pollution they created.</TE>
<TE>   The program in question, Total Maximum Daily Load, includes about
21,000 waterways, or about 40% of the nation's total. They are
classified as polluted despite the installation of pollution controls
at factories, wastewater treatment plants and other facilities with
discharge pipes. Agricultural runoff and urban storm water are major
sources of the pollution in these waterways.</TE>
<TE>   EPA officials would not reveal the details of their plan to amend
the Total Maximum Daily Load program, but a document provided to
congressional staffers outlining the proposal shed light on the
agency's thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Under the current program, states are required to list each
polluted lake, river or other body of water. Waterways are considered
"impaired" if there are any credible data that they are polluted.
Once a lake or river is on the list, states are required to determine
how much pollution it can take and still meet water-quality
standards--its total maximum daily load--and then allocate how much
pollution can come from each source.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal would raise the bar on how much information is needed
to put a waterway on the list. This would allow states to determine
that they do not have enough data on a particular lake or river, thus
removing it from their list of impaired waterways. By doing so, they
could avoid, or at least delay, the complicated and costly process of
determining how much pollution can be allowed and from which sources.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal would also make it easier for states to reclassify
the uses of the waterway, thus possibly permitting higher levels of
pollutants.</TE>
<TE>   The National Academy of Sciences' panel noted that because many of
the waterways were put on the lists without adequate water-quality
data, they may not actually violate water-quality standards.</TE>
<TE>   But environmentalists warned that the changes would create huge
loopholes that would allow states to avoid the difficult task of
cleaning up these lakes and rivers.</TE>
<TE>   "If finalized, the impact of this proposal will be that your
children and your grandchildren will have to get used to living with
dirty water," said Joan Mulhern, senior legislative counsel for
Earthjustice, a national environmental law group. "There is no other
program under the Clean Water Act that will get the water clean."</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Rosenberg, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, said the fact that the states have done so little to
implement the program to date shows that they should not be given
even more leeway.</TE>
<TE>   Although total maximum daily loads have been required by the Clean
Water Act since its implementation, very few were developed. In
recent years, citizens' groups began suing the EPA to seek these
designations. To date, there have been about 40 legal actions in 38
states, and the EPA is under court order or consent decree in many
states to ensure that total maximum daily loads are established,
either by the state or by the agency.</TE>
<TE>   California has made more headway than most states in implementing
the program, in hopes of cleaning its 1,400 dirty waterways.</TE>
<TE>   "Trusting the states is a completely bankrupt approach to
implementing the program; that's what's failed for the last 30
years," Rosenberg said. "If EPA seriously thinks the waters of the
U.S. are going to be made clean by cutting out citizen enforcement
and trusting the states, they might as well call for revoking the
Clean Water Act entirely."</TE>
<TE>   "The real agenda is to get as many of the waters off the list so
they don't have to do" total maximum daily loads, he added.</TE>
<TE>   But Grumbles said the EPA would continue to oversee whether states
determine how much pollution a waterway can take, as required by law.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not backing away from a strong federal EPA role," Grumbles
said.</TE>
<TE>   But the EPA would not oversee the states' plans for cleaning up
the waterways, as was the plan under the Clinton administration's
rules. Those rules were put on hold first by Congress and then by the
Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA proposal is supported by the state sewer treatment
agencies and state water pollution control administrators, which
complain that current rules are unworkable and antiquated.</TE>

<HD>Natural Hormone May Lead to New Weight-Loss Drugs</HD>
<DH>Health: Researchers say the long-lasting appetite
suppressant could lead to new weight-loss drugs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Researchers have identified a hormone naturally produced by the body
that cut the amount of food volunteers consumed by up to 36%, a
finding that could eventually lead to new types of natural
weight-loss drugs.</LD>
<LD>   The hormone "is what stops you from having a third helping," said
Dr. Stephen Bloom of Imperial College in London, who led the study.
The hormone, called PYY3-36, was shown to reduce food intake in rats
over a long period, the team reports in today's issue of the journal
Nature.</LD>
<LD>   New ways of controlling weight gain are desperately needed. Some
researchers estimate that as much as 60% of the American population
is overweight, and the obesity epidemic is extending to childhood.
About 13% of children and 16% of adolescents are estimated to be
overweight, and the proportion is growing rapidly, fueled by fast
food and lack of exercise. New studies have shown that obesity is the
second leading cause of preventable deaths, after smoking.</LD>
<TE>   Weight-loss drugs and programs are a $40-billion-per-year
industry--and growing. There are about 15 drugs for treating obesity
that are in human clinical trials or about to begin them, according
to a recent study by the market research firm Marketdata Enterprises
Inc. But many diet drugs produce only modest weight loss. The loss
does not persist for long periods and most drugs have undesirable
side effects, such as hyperactivity and extreme dry mouth.</TE>
<TE>   "If we are to combat the global obesity epidemic, such
breakthroughs [as this] are urgently needed," wrote Dr. Michael W.
Schwartz of the University of Washington in an editorial in the same
journal.</TE>
<TE>   Experts agree that it will be years before a useful drug can be
produced from the new finding--if one can be at all. One stumbling
block, for example, is that the hormone cannot be administered orally
because acids in the stomach would destroy it.</TE>
<TE>   But this discovery certainly represents one of the most promising
leads in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Many hormones that reduce appetite have been identified, "but this
one has important features that distinguish it from the others," said
Dr. David E. Cummings of the Veterans Affairs Puget Health Care
System and the University of Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Its effects lasted longer than those of other hormones and
repeated injections produced long-lasting appetite suppression and
weight loss in rats, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Others don't do this," he said. They change eating patterns but
don't produce long-term weight loss. Moreover, most of the other
substances previously identified have not been tested in humans, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Cummings himself made a splash earlier this year with the
discovery of another hormone, called ghrelin, that increases
appetite. PYY3-36, he said, "is the anti-ghrelin."</TE>
<TE>   The existence of PYY3-36 has been known about for some time, but
the new study is the first to show what it does.</TE>
<TE>   Bloom and colleagues from Oregon and Australia demonstrated that
the hormone, a peptide containing 34 amino acids strung together, is
produced in the intestines following a meal. Its natural function is
to make you stop eating because you feel full, said team member Dr.
Caroline J. Small of Imperial University.</TE>
<TE>   The team gave injections of the drug under the skin to rats that
were exposed continuously to food, as well as to rats that had been
starved for 24 hours. Both groups showed marked decreases in
appetite. Importantly, the drug did not lose its effectiveness after
repeated administration, as has been observed with many other such
hormones.</TE>
<TE>   The results were also significant, Cummings said, because the team
administered the drug at very low doses that were comparable to
levels found naturally in the bloodstream.</TE>
<TE>   The British team then infused low levels of the hormone directly
into the bloodstream of 12 human volunteers, while infusing a placebo
into a control group of 12 other adults. Two hours later, all the
volunteers were allowed access to a buffet. Those who received the
hormone ate 36% less food than those who received the placebo. They
continued to eat less for at least 12 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Because PYY3-36 must be given by infusion, it is unlikely to
become a significant weight-loss drug itself, Bloom conceded.</TE>
<TE>   "But it may be possible to identify foods which cause the release
of more PYY3-36, helping to naturally limit appetite, or it may be
possible to create a tablet with a similar effect, providing an
excellent, natural and safe long-term treatment for obesity," Bloom
said.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers have many hurdles to overcome before then, noted Dr.
Richard Atkinson, president of the American Obesity Assn. Rats
exposed to many other appetite-limiting hormones have been shown to
develop a tolerance, and some fear that humans would develop a
similar tolerance to PYY3-36.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to give this every day for months and see if it results
in significant weight loss," he said.</TE>

<HD>Angels' Loss Is a Blooper</HD>
<DH>Baseball: White Sox defeat Anaheim, 7-6, when Clayton's
ninth-inning hit barely eludes drawn-in infielders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>A swing, a broken bat, a soft liner into no-man's land.</LD>
<LD>   That's how the Angels lost Wednesday, on a ninth-inning single by
Royce Clayton that barely cleared the heads of the drawn-in
infielders. The Angels lost to the Chicago White Sox, 7-6, after the
usually reliable bullpen failed to get the six outs necessary to
deliver a lead to closer Troy Percival.</LD>
<LD>   "Everybody's been dogging us," reliever Ben Weber said. "Go ahead
and dog us some more."</LD>
<TE>   For all its anonymity, the Angel bullpen has the best earned-run
average in the American League. Weber, a 31-year-old rookie last
season, converted all four save opportunities during Percival's
recent stint on the disabled list. Brendan Donnelly, a 31-year-old
rookie this season, had not given up a run since returning from the
minor leagues July 13 and has stranded all 14 runners he has
inherited this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Those guys have been fantastic all year," Manager Mike Scioscia
said. "They're going to continue to be there for us."</TE>
<TE>   With no lead for Percival to protect, Donnelly, who entered the
game in the seventh, returned to the mound for the ninth inning. With
the score tied, 6-6, Carlos Lee led off with a single. After Magglio
Ordonez struck out, Paul Konerko singled Lee to third.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels then walked Frank Thomas intentionally, loading the
bases, and deployed their five-man infield. Darin Erstad moved from
center field to first base, with first baseman Scott Spiezio moving
to second base and second baseman Adam Kennedy moving almost directly
in front of the base.</TE>
<TE>   On the first pitch, Clayton poked a broken-bat single into shallow
right field, with Lee scoring the winning run. Had the infield been
playing at normal depth, the first baseman might have had a chance to
make the catch, but the Angels had moved all five infielders in for
the chance to field a ground ball and force Lee at home.</TE>
<TE>   "Our confidence will be fine," Angel starter Kevin Appier said,
"but it's kind of a bummer to be so close to winning and not be able
to pull it out."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels led, 4-2, after four innings and increased the lead to
6-2 on solo home runs by Troy Glaus and David Eckstein.</TE>
<TE>   Within two innings, the lead was gone.</TE>
<TE>   Appier had retired seven of eight hitters entering the sixth
inning, but Konerko doubled and Thomas homered to pull the White Sox
within 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   Appier completed the inning without further scoring, and Scioscia
turned the game over to the bullpen, needing six outs to get the game
to Percival.</TE>
<TE>   Weber retired the first two batters in the seventh inning. He then
hit Lee, with Ordonez following with a home run that tied the score,
6-6. Weber had not given up a home run since May 7.</TE>
<TE>   White Sox Manager Jerry Manuel has enough trouble in his own
clubhouse without raising eyebrows in opposing clubhouses, but in
trying to compliment the Angels for their success he used a word that
rankled them.</TE>
<TE>   "Anaheim is a team I think is overachieving," Manuel said Monday.
"They have a manager who is doing a tremendous job. They have some
players overachieving and doing the right things."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia appreciates a compliment as much as the next guy, but he
did not care for the word "overachieving."</TE>
<TE>   Said Scioscia: "I don't think we have anyone having an
uncharacteristically horrible season that would drag you down. I
don't think we have anyone having an uncharacteristically good season
that would lift you up."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels had the fourth-best record in the league at the
All-Star break but had the minimum one player selected to the
All-Star game.</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher Jarrod Washburn said he and Percival discussed Manuel's
quote.</TE>
<TE>   "We were trying to figure out who the overachievers were,"
Washburn said. "We've got a bunch of guys doing what was expected of
them.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't agree with him at all. But I guess that tells us what he
thought of us at the beginning of the year."</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Air It Out</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Ashby strong at the start, Green at the finish of
4-0 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It wasn't the kind of blowout the Dodgers need to release the
pressure of a recent string of grueling, close games, but for at
least one inning Wednesday night, the Dodgers could breathe without
the aid of an oxygen mask.</LD>
<LD>   That luxury came courtesy of right fielder Shawn Green, who turned
a one-run lead into a four-run cushion with a solo home run in the
seventh inning and a two-out, two-run single in the eighth,
catapulting the Dodgers to a 4-0 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates
before 31,588 in Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Andy Ashby (8-9) gave up five hits in 7 1/3 shutout innings,
striking out seven and walking two, to win his first game since June
23, third baseman Adrian Beltre continued his torrid streak with
three singles and a run, and closer Eric Gagne recorded the final
four outs for his 37th save, as the Dodgers improved to 9-17 since
the All-Star break but remained a half-game behind San Francisco in
the wild-card race.</LD>
<TE>   "That was great, because that was something we haven't seen a
whole lot of in the last 26 games," Manager Jim Tracy said of the
ninth-inning lead. "With two runs [in the eighth] everyone could sit
back and take a deep breath.</TE>
<TE>   "What we saw tonight was the way we won a lot of games in the
first half. ... We got brilliant pitching, made no mistakes
defensively and got enough offense to win."</TE>
<TE>   The outcome was still in doubt in the eighth, though. Trailing,
2-0, the Pirates threatened when shortstop Jack Wilson singled with
one out. With No. 3 hitter Brian Giles, who bats left-handed, coming
up, Tracy pulled Ashby in favor of left-hander Jesse Orosco, who had
retired the last nine batters he faced, five on strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   But Orosco walked Giles, bringing Tracy to the mound again. In
came right-hander Paul Quantrill, and out went Aramis Ramirez on a
slow roller to short that advanced the runners to second and third.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy then summoned Gagne to face left-handed Armando Rios, who
tapped a weak grounder to second to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Green, who blasted Brian Meadows' first pitch of the seventh
inning over the wall in center for his 31st home run, stroked a
grounder into right field against Joe Beimel to score two runs in the
eighth, providing Gagne a soft cushion. Two Pirates reached base, but
Gagne retired Jason Kendall on a slow roller to second to end the
game.</TE>
<TE>   "Green got that huge home run, and that allowed us to exhale,"
Dave Roberts said. "To get those insurance runs, with the way Ashby
was throwing, was huge. Green is a big part of our offense, and the
numbers bear that out. To have him swinging like he did tonight
really helps."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers had scored a total of two runs in Ashby's last two
starts, a loss and a no-decision, "but he never pointed a finger,"
Tracy said of Ashby. "There was never a hint that a loss or
no-decision came because of no run support, and don't think his
teammates weren't aware of that. That says a lot about a 12-year
veteran who is endeared by his teammates because of his character."</TE>
<TE>   Ashby suffered three losses and four no-decisions in his previous
seven starts, but he has given up only two earned runs in 20 1/3
innings of his last three starts.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not gonna get too overly confident, but it feels good right
now," Ashby said. "I went through a stretch where I was thinking too
much. It was frustrating, but part of the game is going through the
ups and the downs. The main thing is to stay positive. Nobody here
has any quit in them. We're all gonna get through this thing
together."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers took a 1-0 lead in the fifth when Beltre, who is 20
for 49 (.408) in the last 12 games, singled and scored on Brian
Jordan's double to left.</TE>
<TE>   Third base coach Glenn Hoffman found himself in almost the exact
same situation in the fifth Wednesday as he did in the second
Tuesday, with Beltre heading toward third and the ball rattling
around in the outfield.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday night, Hoffman held Beltre, and the Dodgers wound up with
two runners--Beltre and Mark Grudzielanek, on third. Beltre was
tagged out, the rally died, and the Dodgers went on to lose, 3-1.
Wednesday night, Hoffman gave Beltre the green light. Beltre beat
Wilson's relay to the plate, and the Dodgers broke the scoreless tie.</TE>

<LD>A golden goal in the 101st minute by high-scoring forward Carlos Ruiz
carried the Galaxy past the San Jose Earthquakes, 1-0, Wednesday
night at Spartan Stadium and into the U.S. Open Cup semifinals
against Dallas.</LD>
<LD>   The defending U.S. Open Cup champion Galaxy will play host to
Dallas, 1-0 overtime winner over the Colorado Rapids, on Sept. 3 at
Cal State Fullerton's Titan Stadium at 8 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   Ruiz silenced what was left of a crowd of 6,481 in the 11th minute
of overtime.</LD>
<TE>   Camped near midfield, Ruiz took a long curling pass from Ezra
Hendrickson, who was on the right sideline after separating himself
from Jeff Agoos and shielding the ball from the San Jose defender.</TE>
<TE>   With Earthquake defender Jimmy Conrad closing in, Ruiz turned
toward the San Jose goal and lightly tapped the ball over the head of
the onrushing Conrad with his right foot and gained control while on
the run.</TE>
<TE>   No one was between Ruiz and San Jose goalkeeper Jon Conway, who
guessed left while Ruiz went right, firing a right-footed shot from
about 14 yards out and depositing the ball into the upper right
corner of the net.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's official. Hot drivers are cold, way cold, so cold that frost is
forming on them.</LD>
<LD>   The upshot of this week's decision by the USGA and the Royal and
Ancient to reverse their field and scale back on the standards of
what they consider legal golf clubs is this: The major club
manufacturers are angry, anyone who bought what they thought was a
legal club is going to be angry and everyone else is weary about the
whole thing.</LD>
<LD>   In essence, the issue of what constitutes a legal golf club is
back to square one, exactly where it was in June 1998 at the U.S.
Open when the USGA introduced its plan to limit the so-called
springlike, or trampoline effect of thin-faced, technologically
advanced drivers.</LD>
<TE>   The R&amp;A never had any limits, so at the very least, there is
agreement between golf's two rule-setting bodies. That must be good.
There are just a lot of problems in the aftermath.</TE>
<TE>   The facts: The coefficient of restitution, or COR, the measurement
of the amount of force with which the ball comes off the club, is
officially .830, beginning in 2003. On May 9, a proposal by the USGA
and R&amp;A established a higher, .860 limit, for nonskilled players
until 2008, but that idea is gone now.</TE>
<TE>   So that means anyone who purchased a "hot" driver can't use it
now, at least if you want to play in a club event or post a handicap
or play under USGA rules.</TE>
<TE>   Callaway has a program to take the ERC II driver back and
substitute a conforming driver. Plus, the company hedged its bets,
anticipated something like this happening and has a conforming club
ready to go--the Great Big Bertha II, which is making its debut this
week at the PGA Buick Classic.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, TaylorMade, the other heavyweight clobbered by the
USGA, is trying to assess the damage, which is considerable. The
"hot" R500 driver is now toast. All the money TaylorMade spent in
research and development and advertising is similarly toasted.</TE>
<TE>   Assuming that the .860 COR would stand, TaylorMade aggressively
shipped the R500 clubs to retailers, who sold thousands. All those
clubs are probably going to be returned by golfers wanting their
money back--and a new club that conforms. It's shaping up as a huge
financial challenge for TaylorMade, which still hasn't commented on
the USGA-R&amp;A move or how it will react.</TE>
<TE>   As for Nike Golf and Acushnet, which makes Titleist, they had no
problem with the USGA's new rules, and for good reason. Neither
manufactures a nonconforming driver.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the world of golf had better start getting used
to the new law in town. No one argues that a worldwide standard is a
good thing, but how high or low to set the bar is quite a different
story. The USGA insists it needed to step in before technology got
out of hand.</TE>
<TE>   However, critics say the USGA's intentions are based more on
instinct and feeling instead of numbers, because scores haven't
changed much in recent years ... although driving distance is up. But
you could blame that on the ball. Can't you just see the fight over
that one?</TE>
<TE>   Contrarian</TE>
<TE>   One manufacturer who doesn't give a darn about the COR limits is
Next Technology Golf, which has a magnetic assembly inside the club
head of its 360-cubic-centimeter driver and conforms to the USGA
guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Update</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods received a liberal dose of criticism in the media and
prompted Martha Burk of the National Council of Women's
Organizations, which is assailing Augusta National about not having
women members, to single him out for being wishy-washy.</TE>
<TE>   All of that happened when Woods failed to take a stand on the
issue in some remarks he made at the British Open.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Woods clarified what he said and now says he believes
that women ought to be members at Augusta National, but he thinks his
opinion doesn't carry much weight.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone has to understand that Augusta isn't quick to change
things," Woods said on his Web site, www.tigerwoods.com. "No matter
what I or the press say, they do things at their own pace, such as
allowing the first black golfer to play or join the club, and won't
buckle to outside pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "Would I like to see women members? Yes, that would be great, but
I am only one voice.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not even a regular member, I'm an honorary member, and it's
going to take a lot more than me, a women's group or the media for
Augusta to change its policy."</TE>
<TE>   More Tiger</TE>
<TE>   Does this sound like getting your proper rest? Woods and Mark
O'Meara played a round at Hazeltine at Chaska, Minn., to prepare for
next week's PGA Championship, then Woods had a 7 a.m. tee time
Wednesday in the pro-am at the Buick Open at Grand Blanc, Mich.</TE>

<TE>   Beem Him Up</TE>
<TE>   The quote of the week is from Rich Beem, who won the International
last week at Castle Rock, Colo., but had to wait out Steve Lowery's
charge that included an eagle and a double eagle. Beem stood at the
back of the 18th green and kept taking off his cap and then putting
it back on.</TE>
<TE>   Said Beem: "My hair used to be blond and now I'm sure it's gray."</TE>

<TE>   The second quote of the week is from Carol Semple Thompson, 53,

wasn't sure about the precise distance.</TE>
<TE>   Said Thompson: "It looked like a mile."</TE>

<TE>   Last week's most-searched athlete on Lycos was Anna Kournikova,

<LD>   What: "Winning Women"</LD>
<LD>   Where: WE: Women's Entertainment, Friday, 7 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   ESPN has its "SportsCentury" series. Fox Sports Net has "Beyond
the Glory." Now the WE: Women's Entertainment channel, formerly the
Romance Classics channel, checks in with a 13-week sports documentary
series.</TE>
<TE>   The series, with actress Alexandra Paul serving as host, makes its
debut Friday night. The half-hour shows will profile two female
athletes each week. The athletes featured in the first show are
surfer Serena Brooke and softball player Lisa Fernandez.</TE>
<TE>   The profiles are only eight to 10 minutes in length and thus
somewhat incomplete. In the segment on Fernandez, there is no mention
that she was a pitcher for UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   The viewer doesn't learn much about Brooke except that she is a
seven-year pro still seeking her first world championship, and that
she came back to compete one day after a chin injury requiring 26
stitches.</TE>
<TE>   There are two better stories in the second show, airing Aug. 16.</TE>
<TE>   One is about Joy Liu, a Harvard graduate and third-year Columbia
law student who is 13-0 as an amateur boxer. Liu, who doesn't look
like a boxer, sometimes spars with male boxers.</TE>
<TE>   About boxing, Liu says, "The best part is when you land a really
good punch, when you tag 'em with a real clean jab that snaps their
head back. There's a sick, perverted pleasure in that."</TE>
<TE>   The other athlete profiled on the Aug. 16 show will be Dee Dee
Crawford, a champion bull rider.</TE>

<HD>Players Propose Steroid Testing</HD>
<DH>Baseball: It's not as stiff as owners would like, but
union's plan is seen as a step in the right direction on a key issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Major League Baseball Players Assn. made a major policy shift
Wednesday in calling for its members to be tested for steroids,
pleasing owners and continuing the positive tone of intensifying
collective bargaining talks.</LD>
<LD>   The union addressed a key issue in ending its long-standing
opposition to mandatory drug testing after former stars Ken Caminiti
and Jose Canseco recently said steroid use is rampant in the major
leagues, submitting a proposal that would subject players to one or
more unannounced tests in 2003 to determine the extent of steroid
use. If the survey showed use of fewer than 5%, a second round of
tests would be conducted in 2004 to verify the results.</LD>
<LD>   If more than 5% of the tests were positive in either survey,
players would be randomly tested for two years. The union did not
indicate whether its proposal includes a penalty component for
players who test positive for steroids, but Rob Manfred, baseball's
lead labor lawyer, said it does, though he declined to elaborate on
specifics.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the right thing to do," said catcher Paul Lo Duca, the
Dodger player representative. "The owners think that we don't want to
have [testing], but there wasn't any [opposition] from any of the
[player reps] on the conference call that we had to approve it.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the players thought it should have been even stricter.
There are a lot of players who do want to clean up the game."</TE>
<TE>   Owners have proposed a more comprehensive testing program. The
sides did not discuss the core issues of revenue sharing and a
payroll tax in talks that are scheduled to continue today, and the
union might set a strike date Monday when its executive board meets
in Chicago. If a date is set then, it is expected that it would be
Sept. 1 or Sept. 16.</TE>
<TE>   But owners were encouraged by the union's new stance on steroid
testing, saying its proposal marked another positive step in talks
characterized by more civility than previous contract negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "Given this is a priority issue for us, we were pleased because it
was a forthcoming proposal," Manfred said. "The proposal, in terms of
the history of the parties' relations on this topic, and the
principles the union has always adhered to in this area is ... this
is a very significant proposal. It is the kind of proposal that will
put us on the path toward an agreement [on that issue]."</TE>
<TE>   Under the owners' proposal, players would be tested three times a
year for steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs, and once a
year for illegal drugs such as cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal also contains a component to address over-the-counter
supplements such as ephedrine.</TE>
<TE>   The union wants teams to show "reasonable cause" to test players,
and in a statement suggested that the program end after two years if
the level of use has "meaningfully abated."</TE>
<TE>   Progress was made in the areas of funding of deferred player
compensation, and the sides exchanged proposals on minimum salary,
the players' benefit plan and debt regulation, but steroid testing
was the big item on the table.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, it was a serious issue, which is why I spent so much
time making sure membership was properly informed," union chief Don
Fehr said. "We wanted to come up with what the players felt was the
best way to approach it, and we believe we accomplished that."</TE>
<TE>   Baseball has lagged behind the NFL and NBA in efforts to crack
down on steroid use, but the revelations by Caminiti and Canseco
apparently spurred the union to soften its opposition to testing.</TE>
<TE>   Caminiti told Sports Illustrated he used steroids during 1996,
when he was selected the National League most valuable player for the
San Diego Padres, adding, "At least half the guys are using
steroids." In a radio interview, Canseco estimated that 85% of major
leaguers use steroids, and said he planned to write a book about drug
use in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that we're going to have testing now is a good thing,
but the way they went about what they did was wrong," Dodger second
baseman Mark Grudzielanek said of the former stars. "Did it benefit
the game? Well, yes and no. We're going to have testing now like the
other leagues do, but the way everything came out was wrong."</TE>
<TE>   The NFL began with an annual steroid test during training camp in
1987. Steroids are a prohibited substance in the NBA, and the NHL
permits the testing of players only if there is cause.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to do this to ease people's minds, both in the game and
outside the game," Grudzielanek said. "A lot of players feel it's
unfair, and not right, for someone to be using something illegal to
enhance their abilities, and do something you're not normally capable
of doing. Hopefully, this will help us get an agreement done."</TE>

<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pete Sampras' title drought stretched to 32 tournaments Wednesday
with a 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (4) loss to Australian Wayne Arthurs in the
Cincinnati Masters Series at Mason, Ohio.</LD>
<LD>   "Maybe he wasn't at his peak, but it's always great to get a win
over one of the best players ever," Arthurs said. "Yes, he's maybe a
little bit more vulnerable than he used to be."</LD>
<LD>   Sampras, who has not won a tournament since winning Wimbledon in
2000 for his 13th Grand Slam title, could not overcome Arthurs'
strong serve in the second-round match.</LD>
<TE>   "He's got a huge serve, one of the best serves on the tour, and he
backs it up with a big second serve," Sampras said. "He's dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded Lleyton Hewitt, the U.S. Open and Wimbledon champion,
advanced to the third round when Davide Sanguinetti withdrew because
of a right toe injury. Hewitt led, 5-0, when Sanguinetti withdrew.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth-seeded Tim Henman tumbled out along with Sampras, falling,
7-6 (3), 6-2, to Fernando Gonzalez. Andy Roddick, seeded 12th,
defeated Nicolas Kiefer, 6-4, 6-3, and 16th-seeded Carlos Moya
defeated Sjeng Schalken, 6-2, 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   Jurisprudence</TE>
<TE>   Former middleweight boxing champion Michael Nunn was charged in
Iowa City, Iowa, with possession of cocaine with intent to deliver,
federal prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Nunn, 39, was arrested Tuesday night in a hotel at Davenport,
Iowa, after allegedly buying $24,000 worth of cocaine from an
undercover FBI agent, said Al Overbaugh, spokesman for the U.S.
Attorney's office. The charge carries a minimum sentence of five
years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Nunn is being held by at the Muscatine County Jail without bail.
He is scheduled to appear at a detention hearing Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Nunn won his first title in 1988 when he beat Frank Tate to win
the International Boxing Federation middleweight title.</TE>
<TE>   Former Texas men's basketball coach Tom Penders denied any
involvement in ordering the release of a former player's grades to
the media in 1998, a controversy that led to his leaving the
university.</TE>
<TE>   Penders testified in his own defense in a defamation lawsuit filed
against him by Eddie Oran, his former assistant, who alleges Penders
defamed his character in the aftermath of the release of Luke
Axtell's grades to a local radio station.</TE>
<TE>   Basketball</TE>
<TE>   The Cleveland Cavaliers signed second-round draft pick Carlos
Boozer, a 6-foot-9 forward who finished his career at Duke with the
highest field-goal percentage (63%) in school history.</TE>
<TE>   Boozer averaged 18.2 points and 8.7 rebounds last season for the
Blue Devils and was selected most valuable player of the Atlantic
Coast Conference tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Vlade Divac of the Sacramento Kings has changed his mind and will
play for Yugoslavia in the World Championships Aug. 29-Sept. 8 at
Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Among Divac's teammates will be point guard Marko Jaric, who is
expected to join the Clippers for the upcoming season.</TE>
<TE>   Motor Sports</TE>
<TE>   Christian Fittipaldi is leaving CART to join Petty Enterprises in
a combined Busch and Winston Cup program next season.</TE>
<TE>   The nephew of two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Emerson Fittipaldi
has been a regular in CART for eight years, all but the first with
Newman-Haas Racing.</TE>
<TE>   Kyle Petty, chief executive of Petty Enterprises, said Fittipaldi
will compete next year in the Busch Series, and in a handful of
Winston Cup and ARCA events.</TE>
<TE>   Plans are for the 31-year-old Brazilian to move to NASCAR's top
stock car series in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Hockey</TE>
<TE>   ESPN is reducing the number of NHL games on its schedule by 30%.</TE>
<TE>   Regular-season games on ESPN and ESPN2 will drop from 102 to 71
next season. The network televised 128 games in 2000-01. Also, ESPN
is shifting NHL games from Wednesday to Thursday to make room for NBA
games.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN is scheduled to show 21 games and ESPN2 50. About 60% of
ESPN's games will come after the All-Star break. Hockey ratings
slipped 17% on ESPN and 8% on ESPN2 last season.</TE>
<TE>   Center Radek Bonk of the Ottawa Senators was awarded a two-year,
$6.7-million contract in arbitration, nearly doubling his salary from

<HD>Shuffling Out of Buffalo</HD>
<DH>Johnson escapes the Bills for rebirth with Tampa Bay</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The meeting was brief, the request bizarre. Tampa Bay Coach Jon
Gruden didn't ask Rob Johnson to throw a pass or even set foot on the
football field. A stack of videotapes told Gruden everything he
needed to know. Well, almost everything.</LD>
<LD>   "He asked me to lift my shirt to see my abs," said Johnson, 29.
"He's just crazy like that. He wanted to see how hard I've worked."</LD>
<LD>   Johnson was happy to oblige, and, apparently, Gruden was
sufficiently impressed. The Buccaneers promptly signed him to a
one-year, $650,000 deal. He's now competing for the starting
quarterback job with incumbent Brad Johnson and Shaun King, and
Gruden has raved about the former USC standout.</LD>
<TE>   Keeping up his washboard abs has never been a problem for Johnson;
he simply didn't have the stomach to stay in Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, the decision was mutual. The Bills wanted to renegotiate
the final season of his five-year, $25-million contract. He didn't
want to take a pay cut--and didn't want to stay in Buffalo,
anyway--so he felt relieved when the team released him.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted out a year before that," he said, referring to when the
Bills were weighing whether to keep him or Doug Flutie. "When they
were dragging the process out, I called them and said, 'Listen, I
don't want to be there. If this is that tough of a decision for you,
let me go.' But when they said they wanted to keep me, I wanted to be
there."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the situation was toxic. The knocks on Johnson were
plenty--he was too indecisive with the football, always searching for
the big play; he was too brittle, having suffered 13 injuries in four
seasons with the Bills, including a broken collarbone that kept him
out of eight games in 2001; and he was a sack magnet, dragged down an
average of once every seven plays last season. Then, there were the
whispers that he would rather risk his body by taking a sack than
risk his passer rating by throwing away the ball. Those accusations
have haunted him since college.</TE>
<TE>   Some of his numbers are impressive. In four seasons with the
Bills, Johnson had the franchise's best completion percentage (60.5)
and its lowest interception percentage (2.56). But he was 10-17 as a
starter, including 1-7 last season. Regardless, some Tampa Bay
insiders believe he will wind up as the Buccaneers' starting
quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing about Rob is, people think he's some kind of
reclamation project," said John Lynch, Tampa Bay's Pro Bowl safety
who has known Johnson since Lynch played at Stanford. "Shoot, Rob's
been a productive quarterback in this league. He took a team to the
playoffs. There was some controversy because of the Flutie thing, and
last year he was on a bad football team. So he's had some tough
circumstances. But he's a talented player."</TE>
<TE>   Folks in Buffalo saw Johnson as a California surf punk straight
out of central casting, more GQ than QB. He is quick to point out he
has only surfed once this year and says he's as dedicated as anyone
in the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I think [that image] hurt in Buffalo," he said. "My family's from
Pittsburgh, my mom was born in Buffalo, but they just see surfer guy.
Just because I live in California. It's kind of a stereotype. They
believed the perceptions and didn't try to see that I worked hard."</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers are giving him a chance to reboot his career. He
and workmanlike Brad Johnson are sharing reps with the No. 1 offense
at training camp, and, although Brad is still penciled in as the
starter, no one doubts that Rob is making a hard push for the job.</TE>
<TE>   Gruden, who has built a career around his ability to mold
quarterbacks, sees untapped potential in Rob, who is very mobile and
has first-class arm strength.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be the first to say I like this guy," said Gruden, who
helped Rich Gannon go from a sturdy, part-time starter with Kansas
City to a Pro Bowl quarterback for Oakland. "I see something in this
guy. Brad's our starter, but Rob's a guy we think a lot of."</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers are holding training camp at DisneyWorld, and
thousands of fans gather at the sports complex each day to watch
practices. They roared with approval last week when Rob hummed spiral
after spiral to his new teammates. Gruden has rebuilt the notoriously
underwhelming offense, adding players such as receiver Keenan
McCardell and tight ends Ken Dilger and Marco Battaglia. And, of
course, Rob Johnson is a big part of that.</TE>
<TE>   "Being through what I've been through, you respect your playing
time a lot more," Johnson said. "You realize that it's very fragile.
You can get replaced at any second. So a sense of urgency has come
over me. I want to play now, and I don't want to get hurt again."</TE>
<TE>   Time will tell if Johnson can redefine his career the way Gannon
did, whether he's devoted enough to do so. Gannon was so dedicated,
he was given a key to the Raider facility so he could watch videotape
before sunrise.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if Rob's there yet," Gruden said. "God knows if he's
up at 6 a.m. But I'm trying to stimulate him where he feels the
urgency to be just like that."</TE>

<DH>With Chick Hearn's passing, another link to the golden era
of colorful sports nicknames is gone</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The early days of Chick Hearn at the microphone were also the days of
Wilt "the Stilt" Chamberlain and Jerry West, otherwise known as "Mr.
Clutch."</LD>
<LD>   Hearn's career as the Laker announcer's career progressed through
Magic and Silk. It was no surprise when, after watching forward James
Worthy produce one clutch performance after another, Hearn coined the
name "Big Game James."</LD>
<LD>   Hearn, who died earlier this week, hailed from a more colorful
time in our sporting past. It was a time when players had nicknames
such as Pee Wee and Crazy Legs, Broadway Joe and the Bronx Bull. Ted
Williams was "The Splendid Splinter," Teddy Ballgame and The Kid.</LD>
<TE>   That era could be long gone.</TE>
<TE>   "Sports nicknames are becoming much fewer and not nearly as
interesting," said Edward Callary, former president of the American
Name Society. "Instead of the Splendid Splinter, we have Mark McGwire
as Big Mac. I mean, how clever is that?"</TE>
<TE>   It might seem trivial, this matter of the vanishing moniker, but
people who study language suggest it illuminates a shift in how fans
watch games, if not a sea change in the culture at large. They
believe it says something about who Americans have become.</TE>
<TE>   "That was an earlier, heroic, more innocent age," said Geoffrey
Nunberg, a Stanford linguistics professor and San Francisco Giants'
fan. "We aren't like that anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Nicknames have always been an intimate lingo, terms of endearment
circulated among a close-knit group. Family. A squadron of fighter
pilots. The Mafia.</TE>
<TE>   In the world of sports, however, they were often coined and
publicized by sportscasters such as Hearn, said Terry Pruyne, who
collected 20,000 of them for his book, "Sports Nicknames."</TE>
<TE>   The best sobriquets reflected a player's persona. Joe DiMaggio was
as majestic as a "Yankee Clipper" and Pete Rose intense enough to be
"Charlie Hustle." Jack "The Assassin" Tatum tackled like one on the
football field. Hockey goon Dave "Tiger" Williams skated ferociously.</TE>
<TE>   Such insights were not always flattering. After a baserunning
error in a 1908 game, the otherwise competent Fred Merkle would
forever be known as "Bonehead." Chuck Wepner was called the "Bayonne
Bleeder," an accurate but unfortunate tag for a boxer.</TE>
<TE>   Even worse, Pruyne found that many nicknames were
unimaginative--scores of "Leftys" and "Reds"--while others were
bigoted, derived from skin color or religion.</TE>
<TE>   For good or bad, this language was more closely associated with
sports when fans felt chummier about their teams, said Callary, an
English professor at Northern Illinois University who busies himself
with onomastics, the study of names and naming practices.</TE>
<TE>   Years ago, in his native Baltimore, it was common to see legendary
quarterback Johnny Unitas--"Johnny U"--on the street. Other Colt
players attended prayer meetings at Callary's neighborhood church.
"These were guys who lived in our town," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Now the best players become free agents and franchises move across
country for the promise of a new stadium. Fans are no longer
relegated to the local ballpark or radio station--they can choose
from half a dozen games on cable each night.</TE>
<TE>   Add rising ticket prices and labor disputes to the equation and,
as Callary said, "I don't think we feel the same way toward our
players. We've just put so much distance between ourselves and them."</TE>
<TE>   If anyone has tried to keep nicknames alive, it has been
sportscaster Chris Berman, who grew up reading about the likes of
Frank "Home Run" Baker, Mordecai "Three Finger" Brown--a pitcher
maimed in a childhood accident--and Walter "Big Train" Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   As a counselor at summer camp, Berman renamed all the kids in his
cabin. In college, he and his pals "hung names" on players they read
about in box scores. This quirk became a professional trademark when,
as an announcer for the then-fledgling ESPN, he uttered the words:
"Frank 'Tanana' Daiquiri."</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't planned but I guess it worked," he said. "We did a few
more and everyone seemed to enjoy it."</TE>
<TE>   Fred "Crime Dog" McGriff. Eric "Sleeping with" Bienemy. Andre "Bad
Moon" Rison. Edgar "Trailer for sale or" Renteria.</TE>
<TE>   Berman is quick to acknowledge that his word plays and pop culture
puns, delivered tongue in cheek, are not like nicknames of old. He
figures the traditional style served a purpose--in its time.</TE>
<TE>   "Way back when, most of the people in America never went to a
game, so they were doing it off visualization," he said. "The
Splendid Splinter was descriptive of how Ted Williams looked. And we
had Sliding Billy Hamilton with 912 stolen bases."</TE>
<TE>   That might still work for fighter pilots and recent gangsters such
as John "The Dapper Don" Gotti and Vincent "The Chin" Gigante because
they are not on television daily. But in sports, cameras peer into
every dugout and inside every facemask, leaving little to the
imagination. "There's less language because we see all of them,"
Berman said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps fans see too much.</TE>
<TE>   Many old nicknames had a sense of grandeur, said Nunberg, the
linguistics professor who wrote "The Way We Talk Now." He is thinking
of the Galloping Ghost and the Sultan of Swat when he explains: "It's
about heroes ... these Homeric heroes and the way we portrayed them."</TE>
<TE>   Such adoration might be impossible when every barroom brawl,
divorce proceeding and arrest for drug possession makes the nightly
news. Athletes are exposed in much the same way politicians are.
Imagine if fans had known that Mickey Mantle got in a brawl at the
Copacabana or stepped to the plate with a hangover, as he later
acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   "The players all had feet of clay but it wasn't covered," Nunberg
said. "Now that we know, these people cannot be given a reverential
status."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Pruyne has noticed a new trend: the commercialized
nickname.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, entrepreneur Charlie O. Finley was looking for ways
to market his baseball team, the Oakland A's. He not only dubbed his
star pitcher Jim "Catfish" Hunter, he concocted a story about Hunter
running away from home as a child to go fishing.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, "Air Jordan" was a shoe marketing campaign before
it was shorthand for basketball star Michael Jordan. Athletes have
followed the lead of rap singers who deliberately craft their
personas.</TE>
<TE>   "In Los Angeles, Shaquille O'Neal has a thing about giving himself
names like 'The Big Aristotle,' " Pruyne said. "Players see the value
of nicknames."</TE>
<TE>   That notion got dragged into the courts last December when a man
claimed he helped Philadelphia 76er star Allen Iverson come up with
"The Answer." The plaintiff was seeking 25% of the profits Iverson
has earned from lines of clothing and shoes connected to the
nickname.</TE>
<TE>   "All the marketing and image consciousness ... these names sound
like they come from a public relations department," said Ron Shelton,
the former minor league baseball player who became a film director
and created characters such as Crash Davis and Ebby Calvin "Nuke"
LaLoosh in "Bull Durham."</TE>
<TE>   Not that spontaneous and descriptive names are extinct. The likes
of Jevon "The Freak" Kearse and Frank "The Big Hurt" Thomas still
populate sports pages. But Shelton joins a chorus of skeptics who
believe modern names--from the Bus to the Big Unit--are no match for
Shoeless Joe and the Georgia Peach. "We've lost that real character
identity," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Or, as Simon and Garfunkel sang: "Joltin' Joe has left and gone
away."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that is why Berman senses an appetite for the names he
invents. Players eagerly adopt them--McGriff is widely referred to as
"Crime Dog" and Rison had "Bad Moon" tattooed on his biceps. Viewers
write letters pining for something to fill the void after Lou "The
Toe" Groza and Smokin' Joe Frazier.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, that language was colorful," Berman said. "Now there's less
mystery. There's not as much poetic license."</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OREGON CITY, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Portland Trail Blazer guard Damon Stoudamire won a ruling Wednesday
that could force the dismissal of a felony drug charge.</LD>
<LD>   Clackamas County Circuit Judge John Lowe ruled that marijuana
found at Stoudamire's suburban Lake Oswego house after police were
called to investigate a burglar alarm could not be used as evidence.
A prosecutor said he would appeal the ruling.</LD>
<LD>   Police found a large bag of marijuana behind an attic door while
searching the house for intruders after two neighbors reported
Stoudamire's front door was ajar and the alarm was beeping inside an
hour after Stoudamire left for a game Feb. 23.</LD>
<TE>   Lowe said he could find "no precedent in this state for upholding
such a search of a private residence."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Lowe rejected the two strongest arguments prosecutors
made for the search, ruling there was no legal justification without
a warrant and that Stoudamire had not given consent.</TE>

<HD>Rummenigge Rips Ronaldo for Attempt to Leave Team</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former German national team striker Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, now the
president of Bayern Munich, Wednesday slammed the ongoing saga of
Brazil World Cup winner Ronaldo, whose attempt to leave Inter Milan
despite having four years left on his contract appears temporarily
stymied.</LD>
<LD>   European champion Real Madrid announced that it no longer is
interested in acquiring Ronaldo, who appears likely to remain in
Italy this season, unless another wealthy club comes calling.</LD>
<LD>   But Rummenigge, a former Inter Milan player, criticized the entire
affair as an affront to the sport.</LD>
<TE>   "It's an absolute farce, in my view," Rummenigge said in Munich.
"When a player is injured for two years [as Ronaldo was] and pockets
100% [of his salary, as Ronaldo did], then plays in the World Cup,
which provides no benefit for his club, and then wants [to leave and
seek] a new contract, you have to ask yourself about that player's
character and that of his advisor.</TE>
<TE>   "That can't be the future of football. We don't want this kind of
legionnaire system."</TE>
<TE>   The Italian news agency ANSA on Wednesday reported that Ronaldo
had met with Rinaldo Ghelfi, Inter Milan's chief executive officer,
on Tuesday night and would be staying with the Serie A club.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo's agent, Alexandre Martins, who had made the initial
overtures to Real Madrid, said the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   "He is an Inter player and will remain an Inter player 365 days a
year for four years," Martins said. "He has a contract that he wants
to respect and, therefore, he will continue to work with Inter."</TE>
<TE>   That contradicted Martins' earlier comments about Ronaldo being
unhappy at Inter and also Ronaldo's remarks on the player's own Web
site.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who really know me know that money isn't the most important
thing for me," Ronaldo said. "I'll respect until the last moment the
club that stood by me even during my difficult times and I'll respect
my contract, as I always have, but I hope that the situation will
evolve in a positive way for me and for Inter in the next few days."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Inter Milan was said to be far advanced in talks to
acquire Italian national team defender Fabio Cannavaro from Parma for
an undisclosed but substantial fee, and the name of Europe's
wealthiest club, Manchester United, also surfaced as a possible
bidder for Ronaldo.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Unbeaten on Tour</TE>
<TE>   The United States under-23 national team, the 2004 Olympic team in
the making, completed a four-game tour of England unbeaten Wednesday
when it defeated the Manchester United under-21 team, 3-2, in
Carrington.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. fell behind in the first half but got goals from Jason
Thompson, Alecko Eskandarian and Ned Grabavoy in the second 45
minutes to earn the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the tour, the Americans had beaten the under-21 teams
of Bolton Wanderers, Huddersfield Town and Crew Alexandria.</TE>
<TE>   Reyna Injured Again</TE>
<TE>   Claudio Reyna, the U.S. World Cup captain playing for Sunderland
in the English Premier League, will miss Sunderland's two-game
preseason trip to Spain because of an injured groin, the club said.</TE>
<TE>   Reyna is expected to be fit in time for the Aug. 17 season opener
against Blackburn Rovers, who start U.S. goalkeeper Brad Friedel.</TE>
<TE>   South Africa Hijacking</TE>
<TE>   Albert Mokoena, chief operating officer of the South African
Football Assn., escaped unharmed but lost his luxury car when he was
accosted and had the vehicle hijacked by two men in Soweto near
Johannesburg.</TE>
<TE>   The men held Mokoena captive for two hours after first failing to
start the car themselves and then ordering Mokoena to drive from the
crime scene. He was later released.</TE>

<HD>One and Only Williams Rolls</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Playing first match as top-ranked player, Serena is
rusty but beats Krasnoroutskaya, 6-4, 6-2.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If this was a homecoming coronation of sorts, Serena Williams was
properly outfitted, a shiny tiara in her hair and her magic wand in
her hand. OK, not exactly. Then, how about a tennis racket instead of
a magic wand?</LD>
<LD>   The reigning Wimbledon and French Open champion played her first
match since officially becoming the No. 1-ranked player in the world.
It was on Wednesday night at the Manhattan Country Club in Manhattan
Beach, a few miles away from her childhood home in Compton. It made
sense, after all, her tennis journey started nearby and now she was
able to come home to celebrate reaching the pinnacle of her
profession.</LD>
<LD>   Though an achy left knee and a month off from tournament action
prevented perfection, simple power and star presence were enough
against Lina Krasnoroutskaya of Russia in the second round at the
JPMorgan Chase Open. The top-seeded Williams had eight aces and
double-faulted four times, winning, 6-4, 6-2, in 66 minutes.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm definitely happy to be back," she said. "I'm really excited.
I love it out there. I love the atmosphere. It's just what I love to
do."</TE>
<TE>   The buzz around Williams' recent ascent to No. 1 created a
big-match feel. She wore a patch on her left knee, saying she needed
to see the doctor recently to get it examined but never considered
skipping Manhattan Beach. It would have been hard to miss this
special homecoming.</TE>
<TE>   "I always really get excited when they say, winner of French Open,
every time they say winner of Wimbledon," Williams said. "It's really
special for me."</TE>
<TE>   It was an erratic match for both. Williams declared herself rusty.
And though the 18-year-old Russian produced some hard-hit winners,
she was also shaky, having been off the circuit since the Australian
Open in January recovering from a severe ankle injury. It wasn't long
ago she still felt pain in her left knee and ankle.</TE>
<TE>   She said she was not intimidated by playing Williams, adding that
fate maybe had something to do with her drawing Serena in the second
round. If anything, she figured Williams could be vulnerable early in
a tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Williams was not pleased with her game, which was littered with
unforced errors. In fact, Krasnoroutskaya won the opening game of the
match, holding at love on four mistakes by Williams. But Williams
managed to break serve early in both sets.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm figuring, why am I playing like this?" Williams said. "I'm
No. 1 in the world. We all have some tough days. I'm just glad I was
able to get through the match."</TE>
<TE>   Several other seeded players were not as lucky, unable to survive
the second round. Eleni Daniilidou of Greece defeated No. 6 Daniela
Hantuchova of Slovakia, 6-4, 6-2; Ai Sugiyama of Japan upset No. 7
Elena Dementieva of Russia, 6-2, 6-7 (5), 7-5; Amanda Coetzer of
South Africa took out No. 11 Anna Smashnova of Israel, 6-0, 6-2; and
Janette Husarova of Slovakia beat No. 14 Meghann Shaughnessy, 6-4,
6-4.</TE>
<TE>   A tired and flu-riddled Jelena Dokic of Yugoslavia, who was a
finalist at La Costa on Sunday, won her first match, defeating Tina
Pisnik of Slovenia, 6-3, 6-2, in the second round. Dokic, seeded
fourth, is in the same half of the draw as Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Williams will play No. 15 Nathalie Dechy of France today in the
third round. Wednesday's result put Williams' winning streak at 20
matches. She has not lost since the final of the German Open at
Berlin in May, going out to Justine Henin of Belgium in three sets.</TE>
<TE>   Life at the top requires a different outlook, apparently. Her
standard is a bit higher now.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, I used to say, 'Come on, Serena, you'll never be No.
1 doing this,' " Williams said. "And now I say, 'Come on Serena,
you'll never be No. 1. Uh, oops, you are No. 1.' It's not the same.
Obviously I would like to reach a new level.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to be No. 1 for just a couple of weeks. I would like
to hopefully stay there for a little while."</TE>
<TE>   And get a few more shots at wearing new gowns at the Wimbledon
champions dinner.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really a fabulous, fabulous dress," Williams said. "I was
definitely the belle of the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Williams has not lost her sense of humor since gaining
the No. 1 spot.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, she's stuck on herself," she said of herself, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   Williams departed the interview room, wearing a towel around her
shoulders over her tennis outfit.</TE>
<TE>   "I could be the belle of the ball wearing this," Williams said.</TE>

<HD>A Violent Inaugural in Colombia</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER and MAURICIO HOYOS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>In an attack blamed on leftist rebels, mortars rained down on
Colombia's presidential palace and downtown neighborhoods Wednesday
just moments before President Alvaro Uribe, who has vowed to crush
the guerrillas, took the oath of office nearby.</LD>
<LD>   Uribe swore before the nation's Congress to restore order to the
war-torn nation, apparently unaware that several blasts had just
rocked historic downtown Bogota, killing at least 14 and wounding 69.</LD>
<LD>   Neither Uribe nor any of the dozens of heads of state and
diplomats attending the ceremony were injured. The U.S. delegation
was headed by Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick and Ambassador
Anne W. Patterson.</LD>
<TE>   The attacks were a terrifying demonstration of how Colombia's
internal conflict, which pits leftist guerrillas against the army and
right-wing paramilitary groups, is escalating. The explosions were a
grim indication of the guerrillas' power and a signal of the dark
days ahead for Colombia, a nation racked by deepening anarchy, war
and drug trafficking.</TE>
<TE>   Panic reigned in the minutes after the explosions. Air force jets
and military helicopters thundered overhead. Bodies lay twisted in
rubble. Most of the dead, which included three children, were killed
in a slum about 800 yards from the palace. Some buildings were left
with gaping holes.</TE>
<TE>   The hard-line president urged an end to the country's nearly
40-year-old conflict even as ambulances and army soldiers rushed to
scenes of destruction blocks away.</TE>
<TE>   "Our idea of democratic security requires that we work to provide
effective protection to all members of the public," Uribe said. "A
whole nation is crying out for respite and security."</TE>
<TE>   After the inauguration, Uribe left Congress and was immediately
met on the steps by the nation's top generals. As the nation watched
on television, he calmly received news of the attacks in his first
emergency security council meeting. Within hours, he delivered a
proposed referendum to Congress, seeking greater powers for the
executive branch to deal with the country's conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities blamed the blasts on urban militias of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the country's
largest guerrilla group, which frequently uses homemade bombs in its
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrillas have recently launched an all-out war against the
symbols of South America's oldest democracy, threatening mayors,
congressmen and now the president himself.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has become increasingly involved in the conflict, with
Congress recently voting to allow military equipment previously
devoted to combating drugs to be used in the battle against the
rebels. Bush administration officials have promised that no ground
troops would be sent to the embattled country, though military
trainers are already in place.</TE>
<TE>   Colombia has received nearly $2 billion in the last several years
from the U.S., mostly to fight drug trafficking. Colombia produces
90% of the cocaine sold on U.S. streets. Thanks to profits from that
trade, the guerrillas have grown dramatically over the last decade to
a force of about 17,000. In the past, battles were mostly confined to
the countryside. But as Wednesday's attacks showed, the rebels have
increasingly brought the war into the city, launching a wave of urban
bombings in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   "This shows the type of conflict we have, and the challenges we
are facing," said Sen. Antonio Navarro, a former guerrilla from a
now-defunct group, who, like many others inside, thought the blasts
were part of a gun salute to the new president.</TE>
<TE>   The mortars, which were apparently launched from a home in a poor
neighborhood less than half a mile west of the palace, took place
despite strict security measures. More than 200,000 police and
soldiers patrolled the nation's streets, including 12,000 police
officers in Bogota. About 25 square blocks around the presidential
palace were closed off, all air traffic was shut down, and a U.S. spy
plane patrolled the skies.</TE>
<TE>   At least one of the mortars apparently went astray, landing in a
slum about five blocks from the palace, killing 11 people. Three
presidential guards were injured when other mortars landed in an
entrance to the palace leading to an underground garage. The palace
received light damage.</TE>
<TE>   Police had detained 20 suspects by late Wednesday but made no
arrests. At least 98 homemade grenades were reported discovered in
the home from which the mortars were apparently launched. The house
was rented two months ago, an indication that the plan had long been
in the works.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Baron said he was sleeping in a homeless shelter when he was
awakened by a blast and saw a head roll by. The area around the
shelter was covered with blood. Many of the dead were apparently
killed while gathered around television watching the inauguration.</TE>
<TE>   "I blame this on the new president," Baron said.</TE>
<TE>   The 500-year-old district surrounding the palace has been the site
of terrorism before, most notably in 1985, when guerrillas from
another group seized control of the nation's Supreme Court, resulting
in a bloody standoff that left more than 100 people dead, including
11 Supreme Court justices.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, at least four other bombs exploded around the
capital near the nation's military school. Firefights with guerrillas
erupted throughout the country.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks seemed to fulfill predictions of a bloody future for
Colombia. Peace talks broke down in February, and the rebels went on
a series of sabotage missions, blowing up electric towers, dams and
bridges.</TE>
<TE>   Uribe, who survived an assassination attempt while campaigning in
April, was elected in May largely on his promise to crack down on the
rebels, who have terrorized the country with kidnappings and attacks
in which civilians have often been killed. Uribe's father was killed
by guerrillas in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   In his inaugural address Wednesday, Uribe told the nation of 40
million not to expect dramatic solutions to the many problems that
afflict them. He ticked off a list of misery: Unemployment at 16%,
half the nation in poverty, half the world's reported kidnappings and
about 34,000 killings a year. He promised hard work, political
reforms and a smaller, more efficient government.</TE>
<TE>   "We will launch an administration which is honest, efficient and
austere," Uribe said. "It cannot work miracles, but it will work."</TE>
<TE>   Rarely has a national leader elicited such equal parts of hope and
fear. Colombians expect Uribe to crack down on the guerrillas, but
they also know that such tactics will plunge the country into a dark
and bloodier period.</TE>
<TE>   The bombs that greeted his administration only served to
underscore that fear. "It is going to get much worse before it gets
any better," said Jorge Rojas, head of one of the country's leading
peace organizations.</TE>
