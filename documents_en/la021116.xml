<HD>At opera company, it's time to adapt</HD>
<DH>San Francisco Opera is slimming its next season to
compensate for a $7.7-million shortfall in a sluggish economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Boehm</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Faced with a $7.7-million deficit, the San Francisco Opera is cutting
one production from its 2003-04 season and substituting a less costly
mounting of Mozart's "The Magic Flute" for the larger, more expensive
Rimsky-Korsakov piece it had announced.</LD>
<LD>   The move is expected to save $2 million, Vanessa Bartsch, an opera
spokeswoman, said Friday. The dropped works, Weber's "Der Freischutz"
and Rimsky-Korsakov's "Le Coq d'Or" (The Golden Cockerel), would have
driven up costs because they required expanded choruses and sets
shipped in from elsewhere. The current season of 12 operas remains
intact, Bartsch said -- one of them being a short, five-performance
run of "Madame Butterfly" in January aimed at bringing in new
audiences. With the just-announced cuts, the company will stage only
nine operas next season.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco Opera, second nationally to New York's
Metropolitan Opera in annual spending, has been hailed for
adventurous plans and impressive recent achievements, including
launching Jake Heggie's "Dead Man Walking" two years ago, and
well-reviewed new premieres this fall of Olivier Messiaen's "Saint
Francois d'Assise" and the currently running "Kat'a Kabanova," by
Leos Janacek.</LD>
<TE>   Since her arrival in 2001 after nine years as a top administrator
of Germany's Stuttgart Opera, general director Pamela Rosenberg's
agenda has included introducing new operas, expanding rehearsal time
and launching "Animating Opera," an initiative to enrich audiences'
enjoyment and understanding by devoting parts of each season to
thematically linked works. Both "Der Freischutz" and "Le Coq d'Or"
were to have been components of "Animating Opera."</TE>
<TE>   The $7.7-million deficit accumulated during the 2001-02 fiscal
year that ended July 31. Opera officials say attendance took a
post-Sept. 11 dip last season, dropping from 86% to 79% of capacity
in the 3,200-seat War Memorial Opera House. So far, Bartsch said,
this year's attendance is down an additional 4% from a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, the downturn in the economy in Silicon Valley is not
helping us, and the stock market being in the tank," Bartsch said.
"It's facing all arts organizations, and we're trying to adapt to the
situation and take responsible steps."</TE>
<TE>   Between post-Sept 11 drops in tourism and the deflation of the
dot-com economy, "San Francisco gets a double-whammy," said Mark A.
Scorca, president of Opera America, a national service organization.
"The environment in which they operate really took a hit on both
fronts."</TE>

<HD>Something new joins the mix</HD>
<DH>Singer-songwriter- producer-arranger and longtime Largo
denizen Jon Brion takes his material to Spaceland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Cromelin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Hi, I'm Bobby Bare Jr."</LD>
<LD>   Jon Brion has never met the rock musician who's introducing
himself at the back bar at Spaceland, but when Bare, who is opening
for Brion tonight, asks if he can use a piece of equipment Brion has
left on the stage, he treats him like an old friend.</LD>
<LD>   "Anything you want, just grab anything -- guitars, amps," says
Brion, who's just finished his sound check at the Silver Lake rock
club. A few hours later, Bare is wrapping up his set, and there's
L.A. pop sophisticate Brion on the stage with the singer and his
rowdy, rough-hewn Nashville band, roaring through a raucous,
ingenious splicing of the Who's "Baba O'Riley" and the Cars' "My Best
Friend's Girl."</LD>
<TE>   Obviously, Brion's gift for musical mingling has survived his
transition from the Largo, the club across town where his
long-running Friday residency regularly attracts illustrious guest
partners (Elvis Costello, Michael Stipe, Elliott Smith, et al) and
has established the singer as a unique performer.</TE>
<TE>   The Largo shows, Brion says, represent a self-imposed challenge to
make the solo singer-songwriter experience something unique and
unpredictable. Operating without the net of a set list, he invents
songs on the spot and responds to requests. He spins from something
avant-garde to a cheesy pop hit, and he supplements his guitar and
piano with the sounds of antique Edison cylinder players and music
boxes, schoolroom phonographs and electronic loopers that allow him
to overdub layers of his playing and singing.</TE>
<TE>   After appearing there with obsessive regularity over six years,
Brion has become a magnet for pop aficionados and the focus of the
Largo's circle of performers, which includes singer-songwriters David
Garza and Grant-Lee Phillips.</TE>
<TE>   But Brion is also a familiar name beyond that circle. He's
produced records for such A-list artists as his old friend Aimee
Mann, Fiona Apple, Rufus Wainwright, David Byrne and jazz pianist
Brad Mehldau. Brion also enjoys dropping in on friends' recording
sessions to add a tambourine part or a guitar lick (among his first
jobs after moving to L.A. from Boston 11 years ago was session
guitarist).</TE>
<TE>   Tapping his orchestral side, Brion arranged and conducted the
strings on the new Tom Petty album, and he's also scored three of
director Paul Thomas Anderson's movies, including "Magnolia" (which
earned him a Grammy nomination) and the new "Punch-Drunk Love."</TE>
<TE>   It's an exhilarating pace for a pop-preoccupied guy like Brion,
but one thing has tended to get lost in the shuffle -- his own music.
His one album, "Meaningless," was distributed only through his Web
site after Atlantic-affiliated Lava Records dropped him for being too
problematic, promotionally speaking (i.e., radio probably won't go
near it).</TE>
<TE>   Brion has finally pumped himself up to deal with it.</TE>
<TE>   "I do know I have to slant it more toward my writing and
performing," he says. "It isn't balanced right now.... But I don't
want people to look at it as the vanity project of a producer. It
shouldn't be looked at as having less merit because of these other
things I do. I do feel like I'm fighting that a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Brion, an enthusiastic talker who hops from topic to topic with
little prompting, is sipping a Coke as he readies the second week of
his residency at Spaceland, which takes place every Wednesday this
month. Brion has assembled a three-piece rock band to back him in a
loud set of mostly original material, launching himself into a new
career phase as he approaches 40.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always found it slightly preposterous, the 'You need to hear
my music' thing, and I might not be doing it if it wasn't for a few
people I care about going, 'OK, it's beginning to bug me that people
don't know what you do.... You have more to offer than the people out
there doing it for the wrong reasons.'</TE>
<TE>   "They laid out clear enough cases to why I should do it where it
made sense to me. Just doing it for the sake of promoting myself was
never enough incentive. But a few people I really respected made me
feel like there's some value in this.... It was really touching."</TE>
<TE>   Brion, who has begun production on another Apple album and is also
recording material of his own, isn't playing it completely straight
at his Spaceland nights. He opened the initial show with a "mini
Largo set," and next Wednesday he'll precede the rock with a string
quartet playing "distorted Gershwin and Ellington."</TE>
<TE>   It's all part of the Brion imperative: Mix it up.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one of the good things about my career," he says. "For
years I was told I really had to do one thing and for years I
refused, and now it's panned out that I'm known for doing a bunch of
things, so it's worked out OK.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if there's anything useful I do, it's giving evidence
that you actually can do what you want with your life."</TE>

<HD>The scary 'Ring' is a pleasant surprise</HD>
<DH>DreamWorks' thriller could hit $100 million by Monday,
happily catching its studio marketers off guard.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elaine Dutka</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No one saw it coming: the box-office clout of "The Ring," an
unheralded remake of a Japanese horror film that could crack the
$100-million mark by Monday -- outdistancing higher-profile fare such
as "Red Dragon" and becoming a huge word-of-mouth hit.</LD>
<LD>   Not the critics, one of whom predicted that "mass popularity will
elude it because it has a no-name cast, cryptic tone and obscure
origins." Not the public, which had little awareness of the movie 10
days before its Oct. 18 opening. Not even DreamWorks Pictures, the
studio that released it.</LD>
<LD>   "We'd be liars if we didn't say we were surprised," said marketing
chief Terry Press. "It would be nice to take credit for being
geniuses, but most of the second part of the campaign was born out of
panic. When people congratulate us we smile weakly, since, prior to
the opening, it was a nail-biting couple of weeks."</LD>
<TE>   After a series of promotional course corrections, the movie took
off, becoming mandatory viewing in some quarters of the teenage
population (the film is rated PG-13). Part of the phenomenon can be
chalked up to a grass-roots Internet campaign that never mentioned
"The Ring" by name but spread the notion of its premise (a videotape
that kills) as a Japanese urban legend.</TE>
<TE>   In the film, directed by Gore Verbinski ("The Mexican," "Mouse
Hunt"), a haunted videocassette strikes viewers dead a week after
they watch it. A telephone call ("the ring") with a simple message
("seven days") informs people of their plight. Seattle newspaper
reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), the aunt of one victim, tries
to unravel the mystery with the help of a former lover (Martin
Henderson). Because they, and her son, have all seen the footage,
it's an archetypal race against time.</TE>
<TE>   Walter Parkes, co-head of DreamWorks' motion picture division,
bought the project in January 2001, just hours after the studio
watched the original on, appropriately, a badly dubbed videotape.</TE>
<TE>   Hideo Nakata's "Ringu" had been one of the country's
highest-grossing pictures, a cult phenomenon of sorts. An adaptation
of the novels of Koji Suzuki (a sort of Stephen King of Japan), it
spawned a virtual Ring Cycle -- a sequel, a prequel and a TV show.</TE>
<TE>   The release has been the most "schizophrenic" of his career,
Parkes concedes: a rare instance in which the subjective and the
objective clashed. He knew that audiences, especially younger ones,
responded passionately to the material. But tracking polls reflected
little knowledge of the $42-million movie -- or desire to see it. On
Oct. 11, 400 sneak previews held in 200-seat theaters were only 60%
to 70% full. Had the advertising and Web campaigns missed their mark?
Or had research merely failed to pick up teens, the film's primary
audience?</TE>
<TE>   The studio quickly revamped the TV ads, which initially featured a
circle -- a central image in the film -- with the line, "Before you
die, you see the ring." Adding audience reaction spots, they figured,
would play up the "fun" aspect, and featuring the well into which
Keller falls added mystery and specificity. Two weeks before the
opening, newspaper ads put a human face on the movie by inserting a
shot of Watts screaming.</TE>
<TE>   A decision was made to open in 1,981 theaters, fewer than the
2,500 initially planned. Better to let word of mouth build, the
reasoning went, and let the theaters fill up. "The experience of
seeing the movie with a large audience far outweighed the benefit of
going really wide," said DreamWorks distribution head Jim Tharp.</TE>
<TE>   The strategy worked. "The Ring" took in $15 million during its
first weekend, considerably more than the $10 million to $11 million
the studio had expected. With the addition of 600 screens, the box
office take was $18.5 million the next weekend. Though most movies
drop an average of 35% to 40% on the third weekend, Tharp notes, "The
Ring" broke the rules: The film took in $18 million on that go-round,
and $15.5 million during weekend No. 4 in 2,900 theaters.</TE>
<TE>   With more than half of its audience younger than 25, "The Ring"
has morphed into a big date movie and a communal screamfest for 13-
to 16-year-olds. Elated executives knew they had something big on
their hands when informed that two teens had come to a Halloween
party dressed as Samara, a character in the film.</TE>
<TE>   "You shouldn't underestimate the importance of the PG-13 rating,"
Press says. "Teens can't believe they get to go to a scary movie
unaccompanied by their parents."</TE>
<TE>   Cutting some gore to get the rating, Parkes says, made for a
better picture, one more aligned with the dreamy suspense of David
Lynch and M. Night Shyamalan's "The Sixth Sense" than with the more
conventional "Scream."</TE>
<TE>   Projections call for the movie to take in upwards of $125 million.
And because the studio has already approached Verbinski, Watts and
screenwriter Ehren Kruger ("Arlington Road") about a sequel, there's
the distinct possibility of an afterlife.</TE>
<TE>   The ending of "The Ring" plays well into a sequel, said Parkes.
But the challenges remain. "Naomi follows the clues on the tape in
the original, so we have to broaden the concept," he explained.
"Having the video out in the world is a good setup, of course, but
what seems like a gimme is not."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Billy Childs is a Los Angeles jazz treasure. As a pianist, he
possesses the improvisatory skills and powerful sense of swing one
associates with world-class artists. He is a thoughtful observer of
the jazz scene with a born educator's insightful view of its many
complexities. And, perhaps most importantly, Childs is an inventive
composer and arranger whose efforts in those areas consistently
expand the dimensions of the jazz genre -- and beyond. (His
commissioned works have been performed by ensembles from the Los
Angeles Philharmonic to the Dorian Wind Quintet.)</LD>
<LD>   All those qualities were on display Thursday night at Rocco's when
he offered a kind of workshop performance of a group of compositions
for a jazz chamber ensemble consisting of saxophonist Bob Sheppard,
guitarist Larry Koonse, harpist Carol Robbins, bassist Reggie
Hamilton and drummer Marvin "Smitty" Smith, with Childs leading the
proceedings from the piano.</LD>
<TE>   The works were diverse: "Aaron's Song," a lighthearted, gently
swinging tribute to his son; "American Landscape," a piece triggered,
Childs noted, when he began hearing phrases steeped in the triadic
melodies typical of patriotic songs; "Hope in the Face of Despair,"
in which currents of musical optimism were enhanced by Sheppard's
well-crafted soloing; and a lush, harmonically layered arrangement of
"Scarborough Fair," inspired, said Childs, by the Simon &amp; Garfunkel
version, but clearly the expression of his own fertile imagination.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, in particular, established a rhythmic foundation that was
both energizing and supportive; Koonse, who seems comfortable in
almost any musical setting, soloed with a careful ear for his musical
surroundings, and the lead players -- Childs, Robbins, Koonse and
Sheppard -- convincingly assembled the many subtle cross currents of
musical timbre and color coursing through Childs' beautifully
conceived compositions and arrangements.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With the nation's moviegoers and critics embracing Eminem's
performance in "8 Mile," this should be a moment of supreme triumph
for rap music.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to the eloquent, liberating elements in director Curtis
Hanson and writer Scott Silver's tale of a young man's struggle to
achieve his rap dreams, millions of skeptical adults are beginning to
understand what young rap fans have been declaring for almost two
decades -- that the ghetto-spawned sound is a vital American art
form.</LD>
<LD>   But the celebration of "8 Mile" has been tempered by tragic
reminders of rap's violent roots, and by continuing links to that
violence.</LD>
<TE>   Eight days before "8 Mile" opened in 2,470 theaters on Nov. 8, Jam
Master Jay, the influential DJ in the seminal rap group Run-DMC, was
gunned down in his Queens, N.Y., recording studio. The search for the
killer and the motive continues.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Los Angeles authorities arrested three associates of
Marion "Suge" Knight, the co-founder of the notorious Death Row
Records who now runs Tha Row Records, on suspicion of conspiring to
murder a gang rival.</TE>
<TE>   These were two very separate incidents.</TE>
<TE>   Like Run-DMC's music, Jay (real name Jason Mizell) was a positive
social force, someone who stressed the importance of education and
generously helped neighborhood kids with their own rap aspirations.</TE>
<TE>   Knight isn't a suspect in the case that led to the raid Thursday
on his office and various homes, police said. But there is a long
trail of violence surrounding him.</TE>
<TE>   The danger is that these incidents will detract from rap's
newfound respect or cause some to see Eminem's talent as an anomaly
rather than as part of the best rap tradition.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest loser in not recognizing rap's creative value wouldn't
be the music, which can continue just fine without adult endorsement.
The loser would be parents who fail to see that the music is a way to
communicate with young people who are fascinated and inspired by it.</TE>
<TE>   Not all rap is artful, by any means. Like rock, much of it is
contrived, derivative and exploitative. Even some of the finely
crafted albums are filled with an unsettling violence and rageSome of
the R-rated images are graphic descriptions of the rapper's harsh
background, but often they are a reflection of society's fascination
with sex and violence -- an outgrowth of rappers' love of such
gangster movies as "Scarface" and "The Godfather."</TE>
<TE>   But the heart of the music -- from Run-DMC and Public Enemy to Ice
Cube and Shakur to Eminem and OutKast -- is as liberating as
Hendrix's guitar or Dylan's words.</TE>
<TE>   And for all the thug life imagery, the best rap shares another
quality with rock: inspiration.</TE>
<TE>   In the loosely biographical "8 Mile's" most powerful scene,
Eminem's character draws strength from every moment of humiliation
and anguish in his troubled childhood. He then takes all that pain on
stage with him in a battle-of-the-stinging-words showdown with
another rapper, unleashing the emotions with the fury a boxer brings
to the ring.</TE>
<TE>   It's an electrifying scene that not only links Eminem to the star
power and charisma of film appearances by Elvis Presley and Prince,
but also helps illustrate the mix of personal testimony and rigorous
craft that fuels the most gripping rap.</TE>
<TE>   The inspirational elements in "8 Mile" aren't just from a
filmmaker's imagination. Much of the power of the film comes from the
way it draws from the tension and personal struggle in Eminem's
private life.</TE>
<TE>   One of the things that struck me about Eminem the first time I met
him in a Sherman Oaks recording studio two years ago was how much he
believed in music as a positive force in his own life. It echoed
sentiments I had heard over and over from rock and rap musicians,
from John Lennon and Kurt Cobain to Ice Cube and Dr. Dre.</TE>
<TE>   Plagued by criticism by everyone from parent groups to Capitol
Hill for the violent images in some of his music, Eminem, then 26,
said, "I don't think music can make you kill or rape someone any more
than a movie is going to make you do something you know is wrong, but
music can give you strength."</TE>
<TE>   The music can, he added, make a "15-year-old kid, who is being
picked on by everyone and made to feel worthless, throw his middle
fingers up" and stand up for himself. "This is what music did for
me."</TE>
<TE>   This self-affirmation is the message that runs through "8 Mile"
and the best of rap, one that helps youngsters grapple with their own
issues of identity and the future. In the conflicting signals this
week from the rap world, it's also a message that should stand above
all others.</TE>

<HD>Michael is still a thriller</HD>
<DH>Adoring fans in normally quiet Santa Maria turn out in
front of the courthouse to see the pop star.</DH>

<DL>SANTA MARIA</DL>
<LD>Don't think for a second that people aren't used to a touch of
Hollywood in this unflashy city 2 1/2 hours north of Los Angeles.
Why, just a few years back, locals like to brag, they filmed parts of
"Grumpy Old Men" somewhere around here. And three or four decades ago
the great Cecil B. DeMille cast the region as a Holy Land body-double
in his epic "The Ten Commandments."</LD>
<LD>   But there's celebrity, and there's Celebrity. There's Charlton
Heston in long white whiskers, and there's the Prince of Pop in
sunglasses and surgical mask. There are star-gazer trials, and
there's Michael Jackson being sued for millions by a longtime
business associate for allegedly reneging on two 1999 New Year's Eve
concerts.</LD>
<LD>   Time will tell, but this could be as much celebrity as some Santa
Marians can stomach.</LD>
<TE>   "This [case] is a big deal, but it's a quiet place for the most
part," said Darrell Parker, court administrator for Santa Barbara
Superior Court, as he chatted with reporters Thursday morning in a
parking lot. "This is an agricultural community. Most of the farmers
don't give a damn."</TE>
<TE>   At that moment the wind shifted, delivering a blast of warm, sour
air from the farmlands just outside of town. Parker grinned. "That's
the fertilizer you smell," he said.</TE>
<TE>   You could sense that other potent currents were swirling in this
fast-developing burg of 80,000, which now rivals its swanky neighbor,
Santa Barbara, as the county's largest. Formerly a dusty inland farm
town, Santa Maria has grown into a more complex quasi-urban area
where Latinos now make up the majority. At times, the tensions are
palpable.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Corbett, a columnist for the Santa Maria Times who has
written sympathetically about a 24-year-old undocumented Mexican farm
worker accused of dumping her newborn son in a trash receptacle, says
her case has split the community and prompted the most vicious hate
mail he's ever received. As for the region's feelings about its
wealthiest resident, Corbett said, "The way people are here, it's
like, 'Michael is wonderful and don't ask questions.' "</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of the 450 autograph hounds and well-wishers who
came out to cheer the singer's appearance on Thursday afternoon were
Latino and African American. Their profile contrasted sharply with
most of the sheriff's deputies and police officers on hand, as well
as the media swarm and the jury sequestered inside.</TE>
<TE>   Surface appearances are, of course, always a matter of intense
interest where Jackson is concerned. On Wednesday, the first day of
testimony, the doe-eyed singer turned up with his trademark kabuki
coiffure, wearing a surgical mask and a bandage on his nose. But what
type of bandage, 8 billion human beings wanted to know?</TE>
<TE>   Several media professionals busied themselves with these critical
matters the next morning while awaiting Jackson's arrival. "Hey,
Larry, I just got a good description of his nose from the court
reporter who sits right next to him," one reporter burbled into her
cell phone. "It's being described as a transparent bandage, not
flesh-colored."</TE>
<TE>   The case of Marcel Avram vs. Michael Jackson, which is expected to
run far into December, is being heard in Superior Court here because
Jackson's palatial Neverland estate lies nearby in the Santa Inez
Valley. Though locals said that Jackson is rarely seen in town (Hint:
Try evenings at Toys 'R Us. Seriously), sightings have become a
popular local pastime.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to like to dance around in my diaper to Michael Jackson,"
said Heather Anadon, 18, by way of explaining why she had come out at
sunrise with her friend, Olivia Acton, 19, to stand behind a police
barricade in hopes of spotting the singer. Both had brought their
uniforms from Hot Dog on a Stick, where they work, in hopes of
getting Jackson to autograph them.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the peanut gallery had been packed with high school
students -- until the authorities started taking down names to report
as truants. Some said the turnout had been fanned by a morning-radio
personality who was giving away "Free Michael" T-shirts. If you're a
teenager, said Anadon, Santa Maria is not exactly a happening place:
"All you have to go to is the movies and miniature golfing."</TE>
<TE>   Corrie Bryson, 39, brought her four children to the courthouse on
Thursday -- Chryshea, 6; Chynna, 11; Anthony, 13; and Jason, 8 --
reasoning that it was cheaper than four concert tickets. "To get that
live glimpse of an icon, they would probably have to pay $500,"
Bryson said. "That's mainly the thing, to see him, to support him."</TE>
<TE>   Away from the crowds, the sentiments were harsher. "I think it's
disgusting," said Donna Kraus, a retiree who moved from West L.A.
several years ago. "I think he's weird," Kraus continued as she
rested on a bench by the carousel at the town mall. "He's not a man,
he's not a woman, he's just nothing."</TE>
<TE>   For all the pregame chatter, Jackson's second day in court had all
the makings of a spectacular anti-climax. By 10 a.m. nearly all the
players were in place: Avram, the plaintiff; the lawyers for both
sides; Superior Court Judge Zel Canter; reporters; photographers; and
several spectators who'd won lottery slots for the few remaining
seats.</TE>
<TE>   But the piece de resistance didn't arrive. No explanation was
given. Court was recessed until 1 p.m., and most of the gathering
straggled off to lunch.</TE>
<TE>   Cassie Cespedes, a petite, middle-aged woman who'd literally
jumped for joy when hers was the first name called in the lottery,
wasn't giving up hope of seeing "my idol." Clutching a tattered
Special Olympics envelope that she hoped to ask Jackson to sign,
Cespedes, who has epilepsy, is a Special Olympics athlete and a
karaoke singer. Her two favorite numbers are "I'll Be There" and
"Dancing Machine," both '70s Michael signatures. Finally, the hour
arrived and the piece de resistance pulled up in a Ford Econoline
van. After a delay of several minutes, a black umbrella popped open
and Jackson stepped out underneath it, looking like a figure in a
Magritte painting.</TE>
<TE>   Then he did something unexpected. He began working the crowd. He
signed photos, album covers and whatever else was thrust at him,
posed for the cameras, and after several minutes blew kisses as his
handlers bustled him into the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   At last, court was in session. While chants of "Michael! Michael!"
could be heard outside during Jackson's testimony over the next 3 1/2
hours, his performance was decidedly undramatic. "I don't remember,"
he said repeatedly in response to questions from the plaintiff's
attorney, Louis Miller. "I don't understand the question." Between
responses, Jackson often paused for glacial intervals. Occasionally
he rocked slightly, back and forth, giggled, or smiled toward his
supporters in the audience.</TE>
<TE>   After a long "comfort break" shortly after 2, Miller resumed his
questions, but with a frustrated edge. When Jackson asked for what
seemed like the 100th time for a question to be repeated, Miller
retorted, "I'm going to let the court reporter do it because I'm
getting a little tired of standing up here myself."</TE>
<TE>   By now it was growing dark, and the judge and attorneys turned to
procedural matters after dismissing the jury. Jackson was due to fly
to Germany soon to collect a humanitarian award. Did the plaintiff's
attorney think he could wrap up his questioning before that? Miller
wearily replied that he would try.</TE>
<TE>   Then a side door opened and Jackson swept out to sign more
autographs and hug a young fan in a wheelchair.</TE>
<TE>   As the crowd pressed forward, a sheriff's deputy rolled his eyes.
"For this guy?" he asked a reporter.</TE>
<TE>   Yep, for this guy -- not fully boy or man, neither visibly black
nor visibly white. Enigmatic, adulated, ridiculed, real but not real,
and always somehow beyond reach even when he's only a few feet away.</TE>

<LD>REGARDING Brian Lowry's column about "The West Wing" ("How High Can
You Fly on a Left 'Wing'? Viewers Cast Their Vote," Nov. 13): Here's
the problem with "The West Wing" for many of us: We can't hear and
can't understand what's going on. No, we're not deaf and yes, we can
manage a remote control. Some of the actors don't enunciate, some of
the lines are so clipped and fast, and some of the references are so
subtle. And it's gotten worse this season.</LD>

<TE>   I am a liberal Democrat, mind you, but I think the show has slowed
down quite a bit. I'd like more of the feisty first lady and C.J.
Right now, it's too much about a bunch of smart, yet somewhat boring,
white guys.</TE>
<TE>   Terri de la Pena</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I don't believe the problem is in the show's being too liberal, as
the talk-radio pundits rather predictably insist.</TE>
<TE>   From its premiere, the great appeal of "West Wing" has been its
fantasy projection of a moral White House, an escapist parallel
universe where the inhabitants are serious-minded, well-intentioned
public servants, as opposed to the dissolute frat boys and craven
corporate hyenas that actually hold those jobs. This was the show's
appealing whimsy -- admirable politicians -- until the end of last
season, when Aaron Sorkin hit on a story line wherein President
Bartlet and his chief of staff conspired to assassinate the foreign
minister of a fictional Middle East country. They actually killed a
guy, cold-blooded assassination, and then spent the delightful
opening episodes of this season covering up the crime.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Doyle</TE>
<TE>   Burbank</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WITH the media all but ignoring the liberal political agenda these
days, I thank God for Aaron Sorkin, who presents a thoughtful
alternative view on the major issues facing the White House. I may
not always agree with the way "West Wing's" President Jed Bartlet
handles situations, but I do agree with him far more frequently than
I agree with George W. Bush. Until the Democrats can find someone to
adequately represent their political platform, I am happy to have
Sorkin speak on my behalf.</TE>

<LD>IT'S a wonderful thing to hear of the joy of the resident priests in
the new cathedral being thankful for their new "digs," and the
importance of lovely sculptures and fountains for them to behold
("When Neighbors Spoil the View," by Larry Gordon, Nov. 12). They
must feel blessed that the archdiocese could afford such a
magnificent environment to inspire them to even greater acts of
charity, and perhaps poverty.</LD>
<LD>   If only their inspirations stopped at their property line, the
people of L.A. could worry a bit less about their next county tax
bill. It seems almost uncharitable to gaze past the sculptures and
fountains from the windows of the multimillion-dollar cathedral and
complain about functional buildings when church programs for the
needy are being cut, people are being laid off, and the county can't
fund emergency rooms.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe it's time for spending, like charity, to begin at home, with
the church offering to donate part of the downtown space for
emergency care.</LD>

<LD>I was disgusted by Hillary Johnson's column on Keith Richards and
Cher ("Keith Richards and Cher: Two Extremes of Aging Ungracefully,
Nov. 12).</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps the shallow Johnson will print photos of herself so that
we can be sure she's not "impaired" and "willfully ugly," as she
claims Richards is, or a "runaway replicant" and "tragic figure," as
she blames Cher for being.</LD>
<LD>   And while she's at it, please have Johnson list her many
accomplishments toward art and culture, which I'm sure she must have
to point her poison pen at such monolithic targets.</LD>
<TE>   Better yet, spare us from having to read future cheap shots
disguised as societal commentary.</TE>

<TE>   QUALITIES that seem to connote an adult for Johnson -- such as
conformity and narrow-minded conservatism -- are what the Rolling
Stones, the Beatles and other similar rock giants have always stood
up against, expressing our longing to be allowed to be ourselves and
not follow society's dictates.</TE>
<TE>   So Hillary, I'll take this "prehistoric reptile" of a rock 'n'
roll animal over the maturity of the Christian Right, the Enronians
and the seriously prehistoric politicians like Cheney, Bush, Dick
Armey and other "adults" who more likely appeal to your sense of

<LD>YOUR picture and article about the Air Force jazz ensemble gave me a
jolt ("To Swing Is Also to Serve," by Lynell George, Nov. 12). Sixty
years ago, I was in the Army Air Corps, taking basic training in
Atlantic City. Basic training is basic training in any service, and
is not fun. We marched across town to the landfill that served as our
drill area. The one bright spot was when we fell in behind the Army
Air Corps Band. On those occasions, the trip seemed to be much
shorter. You can only imagine how it felt marching several miles to
"The Saint Louis Blues March."</LD>

<HD>A writer's life without 'Bonnie'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I am one of the several writers who was fired from the sitcom "Life
with Bonnie" by Bonnie Hunt. In Mark Sach's article of Nov. 11 ("In
the World of TV Casting, Nothing's Set in Stone"), he discusses the
program and states that "as the ratings softened, the series' writing
staff was cut loose," implying that the staff was somehow viewed as
responsible for a poor showing by the program. This conclusion is
illogical and uninformed, as every episode up to the time of the mass
firing had been written by Hunt and her partner, Don Lake.</LD>
<LD>   The writing staff was not used, and had, in fact, been barred from
the set. In addition, and perhaps most telling, no one ever bought
the staff lunch. In the world of television, there is no greater
slight, or truer death knell.</LD>

<HD>Caltech rejects Serra's massive wall sculpture</HD>
<DH>President cites campus protests. School will give students
greater voice in selecting a replacement project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bettijane Levine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Caltech President David Baltimore sent an e-mail to members of his
Pasadena campus community on Friday morning to say that the school
will not accept artist Richard Serra's hotly debated design for a
massive sculpture.</LD>
<LD>   "This is not a judgment about the quality of the proposal, but
rather a judgment about the needs of the campus," Baltimore wrote.</LD>
<LD>   Debate over the proposed 80-ton zigzagging steel wall planned for
a lawn in front of the school's biological sciences buildings began
months earlier. Students protested the divisive nature of the
monumental artwork and the lack of procedures for them to air their
views. Baltimore was not available for comment about his decision.</LD>
<TE>   The artist's wife, Clara, e-mailed a statement to The Times on
Friday regarding the rejection of the design. It says that Baltimore
"has decided not to build a Richard Serra landscape sculpture that
Caltech had asked the artist to propose...." It also said that among
the reasons Baltimore cited for the rejection were "student protests,
pressure from faculty members, and the risk that his decision to go
ahead with the sculpture might undermine his authority on campus."</TE>
<TE>   Serra said Baltimore also cited a "health issue" in relation to
"educating the future leaders of America." But the Serra statement
adds that for the sculptor, "the fear of further controversy is
insufficient reason not to build the sculpture...."</TE>
<TE>   Hall Daily, Caltech assistant vice president for government and
community relations, said the debate over the Serra piece had
ultimately been a good thing for the school, in that it had "led to
an incredibly healthy debate on this campus. It shows that this
university, which is renowned for scientific and engineering debate
-- for research and discovery at the very edges of human knowledge --
also has a very spirited interest in ... modern art and, in
particular, monumental art." Daily also said that "one of the results
of this experience has been to add student representatives to the
campus arts committee."</TE>
<TE>   The decision not to accept Serra's design, Daily added, means that
the arts committee will work with the city to find a different
project to fulfill the city requirement for public art.</TE>

<LD>Pianist Andre Watts was reported in fair condition Friday after
paramedics rushed him to a hospital Thursday night, half an hour
before he was scheduled to perform with the Pacific Symphony at the
Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa.</LD>
<LD>   Watts, 56, underwent emergency surgery for a subdural hematoma --
or spontaneous bleeding -- in the brain, at Hoag Memorial Hospital
Presbyterian in Newport Beach, according to a hospital spokesperson.</LD>
<LD>   "Things are looking very encouraging," said Hoag Hospital
neurosurgeon Dr. William Dobkin, who performed surgery on Watts
Thursday night. "But for his specific skills, it will take time to
know the impact of this event. He'll probably be in the hospital for
four or five days. It will probably be a month or two before he is
back to feeling normal."</LD>
<TE>   Watts, who lives in New York, had played Brahms' First Piano
Concerto with the orchestra on Wednesday and was scheduled to repeat
the work Thursday night and this afternoon at the center.</TE>
<TE>   The Thursday program was revamped; pianist Markus Groh will
substitute for him today. Patrons who attended Thursday's concert can
also use their tickets for the Saturday concert or exchange them for
a voucher for another Pacific Symphony concert.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Detroit-area rapper who plays a bit part in Eminem's blockbuster
debut movie was shot on 8 Mile Road in Detroit, the street that gave
the film its name, authorities said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   An unidentified assailant shot 26-year-old Ali Miyzaan in the
stomach outside Detroit's Phoenix Theater after he dropped in for the
premiere of "8 Mile" last Saturday, police spokesman Glen Woods said.</LD>
<LD>   He said Miyzaan had been trying to break up a fight outside the
theater when "somebody shot him from somewhere." Woods said no
arrests had been made and that Miyzaan was not seriously injured in
the attack, which appeared unrelated to the violence targeting some
of America's top hip-hop stars.</LD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eminem was the big winner at the MTV Europe Music Awards in
Barcelona, taking trophies for best album, best male singer and best
hip-hop artist.</LD>
<LD>   Kylie Minogue, Linkin Park and the Red Hot Chili Peppers each won
two prizes Thursday night. The ceremony offered few surprises because
Eminem was the clear pre-show favorite. He performed a selection of
his most popular songs to a screaming crowd, but left out the
expletives.</LD>
<LD>   Visibly moved, the rapper thanked the audience and fans for their
support, saying: "Thanks a lot. I couldn't do it without you guys."</LD>

<HD>Poster to pedestal</HD>
<DH>Coming soon to LACMA ... Sculptor Keith Edmier and his
muse, Farrah Fawcett, make art together.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One day when he was in the fourth grade, Keith Edmier of Tinley Park,
Ill., entered a Kay-Bee Toy &amp; Hobby Shop and laid eyes upon a certain
poster of a certain smiling actress with blond tresses and a red
swimsuit. The year was 1976, maybe 1977, and this was something like
love at first sight.</LD>
<LD>   "That image," Edmier said the other day, "was the most beautiful
picture I'd ever seen. It was pure."</LD>
<LD>   And it set an imagination in motion. Someday he and Farrah would
be together, and barriers would fall away and a video camera would
roll, and clothes would be shed, and he'd sculpt Farrah, and Farrah
would sculpt him. In fact, Farrah would make a life-size bronze
sculpture of him, muscled and naked. And then the results would go on
display in the largest encyclopedic art museum west of the
Mississippi.</LD>
<TE>   All right, perhaps that's not exactly what Keith Edmier imagined
back then. But that's what happened.</TE>
<TE>   Edmier and Farrah Fawcett, once distant figures on opposite ends
of the celebrity spectrum, are now collaborators. Their joint
artistic venture, "Keith Edmier and Farrah Fawcett 2000," comes to
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on Thursday as the marquee
attraction in an exhibition that examines the relationship between
celebrity and fan, and also between projection and reality. The
central work is a pair of sculptures: a reclining marble sculpture of
her, done mostly by him; and a standing bronze sculpture of him, done
mostly by her. Along with the sculptures there are a few smaller
works, and photos, video images and sketches made as the project
evolved. If this seems odd and unnerving from a distance, it's often
been that way up close as well.</TE>
<TE>   On their first day of collaboration, with roles and objectives
still largely undefined, "we started undoing the boxes of clay,"
Fawcett recalled in an interview at Edmier's Venice studio. "I
remember being filled with trepidation, thinking 'OK, now, can I
touch the clay?' It was much, much, much more tense than a first
date. There was more riding on this."</TE>
<TE>   Their work has drawn backing from the Art Production Fund, a New
York-based nonprofit organization that supplies funds for artists'
projects; and Rizzoli, which is publishing "Keith Edmier and Farrah
Fawcett: Recasting Pygmalion" this month. It also attracted curator
Lynn Zelevansky, who brought the project to LACMA.</TE>
<TE>   With this collaboration, Zelevansky writes in an exhibition essay,
"Fawcett has played a provocative game ... : She is challenging the
public to see her as a complex and engaged human being, not simply
the object of projected fantasy."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, LACMA is playing a provocative game too. Though
Fawcett's talents as an actress have been widely acknowledged, her
greatest fame is as one of television's original "Charlie's Angels"
in 1976, and her best-known previous artwork is probably the series
of paintings she did in a 1997 Playboy video, applying paint to her
body, then rolling on canvases.</TE>
<TE>   "Is this a joke?" asked one LACMA member in an e-mail to the
editor after reading of the exhibition. "While there are still things
about LACMA I appreciate ... am left scratching my head as to what
exactly their commitment to fine art is."</TE>
<TE>   "I knew we'd be accused of sensationalism," said Zelevansky. "But
it was a project that I really believed in, initiated by an artist
with whom I've wanted to work for many years. And for me, the whole
notion of the muse looking back and gaining a voice is a very
important idea."</TE>
<TE>   The project began with Edmier, 35, who studied at CalArts and
worked in the film business (he did special-effects makeup on "Barton
Fink," "Texas Chainsaw Massacre III" and other movies) before moving
to New York and embarking on a career as an artist in the early
1990s. For most of the last decade, his specialty has been the
grown-up probing, in sculpture, of his own old, childish ideas.</TE>
<TE>   For one piece in 1996, Edmier tracked down Evel Knievel, an old
hero. For another piece, he invoked the girl who inspired his first
crush -- a girl who wore her blond hair in a feathered style inspired
by a certain television star. Through these and other sculptures and
installations, Edmier won a growing reputation, including solo
gallery shows from New York to London, Paris and Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   But he hadn't found a way to face head-on that transcendent moment
in the toy store -- until 1999. Then, after one letter failed to get
through, he found a way to reach the actress, relying on curator
Irene Tsatsos of Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions as an
intermediary.</TE>
<TE>   As Edmier knew from an old profile in the teen magazine Dynamite,
Fawcett studied art herself. In fact, the year Edmier was born, 1967,
Fawcett was a 20-year-old art major at the University of Texas at
Austin. Her professional acting career took off the following year
when she moved to Los Angeles for the summer. Years later, as a
television and movie star living in the Hollywood Hills, she set up a
tin-shed art studio in her yard.</TE>
<TE>   Edmier's request got her attention, Fawcett said, "specifically
because he obviously knew about my interest in art, and my
sculpture."</TE>
<TE>   They met in May 2000 and hit it off. Soon a plan was launched:
That August, Edmier would make a portrait of Fawcett, and Fawcett
would collaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Once the studio space was secured and supplies were on hand, "we
basically just started pushing clay around, talking," Edmier
recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Working on an early press release to summarize their project,
"we'd get as far as, 'Keith and Farrah intend ... ' and he'd get
hysterical laughing," Fawcett said.</TE>
<TE>   At first the two worked together on an image of her. But as the
project developed, their thinking widened, and Fawcett set to
sculpting Edmier while Edmier was sculpting her.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a few bumps in the road -- their first terra-cotta
collaboration exploded in the kiln -- the partnership stretched to
two years, on and off, enduring Sept. 11, family crises and the
unpredictable nature of Fawcett's acting gigs.</TE>
<TE>   The sculpture of Fawcett was cast in fiberglass, shipped to Italy
and copied by craftsmen into marble. The figure of Edmier was cast in
bronze in upstate New York. Among the other pieces they made
together: multiples of "Shell," a large clamshell made of melted
crayons and filled with beach sand from Padre Island, Texas. A
handful of the smaller pieces have been exhibited in Europe, but the
central dual portrait is going public for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Though the image of Fawcett is a nude, the supine figure lies in
the most demure pose possible, which is not a coincidence. Fawcett
wore a bathing suit and a chiffon cover-up for most of the work, and
"I know when I was up on the clay, I was very conscious of revealing
as little as possible. The intention was not to make it erotic."</TE>
<TE>   The male figure, on the other hand, stands tall and conceals
nothing. That posed a challenge for Fawcett, who'd never sculpted
male genitals before. Yet the strangest thing about posing nude, said
Edmier, was "how normal it all felt."</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, Edmier and Fawcett learned enough about each other
that the two of them, both single, can do a fair imitation of a
long-married couple. In fact, Edmier said, "we've had a personal
relationship." Between them, it is established that he is the morning
person, she is the night person. He is inclined to trust his memory;
she takes notes, makes sketches, dates Polaroids. He is the one who
has worked with unorthodox materials like dental acrylic; she is the
one with more experience in clay.</TE>
<TE>   Working with Edmier, Fawcett decided, was "like meeting with a
secure director, a Robert Altman, who says, 'What are your ideas?' "
And in their working relationship, she added, "we were able to sort
of leave my celebrity out of it."</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not the art is worthwhile, audiences and critics will
soon have a chance to judge. And the marketplace may as well. Edmier
and Fawcett will replicate some of their works in editions of up to
10, and Edmier's dealer, Friedrich Petzel in New York, has already
sold three pieces from the "Shell" edition. (Petzel declined to
disclose prices.)</TE>
<TE>   "I hope we can just make some of the costs back," said Edmier.</TE>
<TE>   As for the distance now between the star and the fan, things have
changed since that day at the toy store.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had to pick people who really knew me, through work, through
frustration, through extreme happiness, through extreme creativity --
you know, the whole realm -- I would say: Keith does," said Fawcett.
"And he's known me for less time than a lot of people."</TE>

<HD>Justice Dept. opens alt-weekly inquiry</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Department of Justice has begun what some legal experts
believe is a serious investigation into whether the country's two
largest alternative newspaper chains violated federal antitrust laws
when they closed competing weeklies in Los Angeles and Cleveland,
thereby dividing the markets between them.</LD>
<LD>   If federal prosecutors find sufficient evidence to pursue a case,
it would be a novel moment on at least two counts: One would be the
spectacle of the nation's leading alternative weeklies, with their
roots in the insurgent journalism of the 1960s counterculture, being
treated like a 19th century cartel. The other would be the very
strait-laced John Ashcroft's Justice Department entering the legal
lists to uphold the commercial rights of massage parlor operators,
escort services and phone sex operators, which provide the bulk of
the chains' classified advertising.</LD>
<LD>   In a deal executed last month, Phoenix-based New Times Media
agreed to shut down its 6-year-old Los Angeles paper in exchange for
more than $8 million, ceding its Southern California niche to the
L.A. Weekly, which is owned by New York-based Village Voice Media.
The latter also agreed to close its Cleveland Free Times in return
for a much smaller cash payment from New Times, which continues to
publish its Cleveland Scene.</LD>
<TE>   The closures left Voice Media with seven alternative papers -- the
largest of which are the L.A. Weekly and New York's Village Voice.
New Times has 11 weeklies in cities ranging from Palm Beach to San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Voice CEO David Schneiderman told The Times that
neither he nor his New Times counterpart, Jim Larkin, were concerned
about their bargain's antitrust implications, since both Los Angeles
and Cleveland retain numerous other print and broadcast outlets.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, federal authorities are not so sure: On Nov. 8, the
Department of Justice served both companies with a demand that they
turn over all documents, correspondence, e-mails and telephone
messages relating to the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Larkin nor Schneiderman returned phone calls requesting
comment. However, a spokesman for Voice Media read a prepared
statement confirming that "we are in receipt of an inquiry from the
Department of Justice and the company will be responding to it fully
and in due course."</TE>
<TE>   This week, federal prosecutors also began interviewing former L.A.
Weekly and New Times Los Angeles employees, seeking information about
the two papers' competitive relationship.</TE>
<TE>   Among those the government lawyers either have questioned or are
seeking to interview are the Weekly's former publisher Michael
Sigman, ex-editor Sue Horton (who now edits The Times' Opinion
section), former classified advertising director Jim Kaplan, one-time
City Hall columnist Marc Haefele and former New Times columnist Jill
Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   According to those already interviewed, the questioning -- all of
which was done by telephone -- was conducted by attorneys Maurice E.
Stucke and Carol Bell from the Department of Justice's antitrust
division.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those interrogated say Stucke and Bell were joined by
lawyers from the U.S. attorney's offices in Los Angeles and Cleveland
and by a representative of the California Department of Justice in
sessions that lasted for as long as two hours.</TE>
<TE>   All of those interviewed were asked whether they had memoranda or
e-mails from or to Schneiderman. Those who said they did were asked
to turn them over and were told the documents would be subpoenaed, if
they declined.</TE>
<TE>   Neither federal nor state prosecutors returned calls seeking
comment.</TE>
<TE>   However, if some of the questioners were deputy U.S. attorneys,
according to Don T. Hibner Jr., an antitrust specialist in the Los
Angeles law firm of Sheppard, Mullin, Richter &amp; Hampton, "it means
they're thinking beyond civil penalties to criminal prosecution.
Involving the U.S. attorneys means they're looking toward grand
juries and indictments. That's not surprising, since what they're
investigating looks very unusual, a pure market division involving
cartel-like activity."</TE>
<TE>   If Voice Media and New Times are found to have violated antitrust
laws, according to Hibner, the executives involved could be liable
for individual fines of up to $300,000 and the companies for as much
as $10 million. If the chains' actions affected interstate commerce,
they could be held liable for fines many times that under a separate
federal statute, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kaplan, who was fired as the L.A. Weekly's classified advertising
director Aug. 8 -- about a month after the chains began secretly
negotiating their deal -- said he has told federal prosecutors that
sexually oriented advertisers "have been really burned by this deal.
Competition from New Times was all that kept us from raising our
rates. With that gone, these guys are reeling with no place else to
go. They're beside themselves over this."</TE>
<TE>   Kaplan said that in the nine months before he was hired by the
Weekly on Sept. 4, 2001, the paper -- acting on instructions from
Voice Media -- had raised its adult advertising rates by 45%.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of the adult advertisers wouldn't pay and migrated to New
Times," he said. "That cost the Weekly about $20,000 a week in lost
classified reve- nue.</TE>
<TE>   "Then I was hired and told I had to get that money back. To do it,
I had to offer rates lower than the adult advertisers had been paying
before the increase. Even then, we never got some of them back.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time, I was friendly with New Times' classified
advertising director, and he told me that after our increase, money
just poured into his paper. Like I say, we got some of it back, but
from then on the competition was fast and furious. It was something
we were constantly concerned about."</TE>
<TE>   According to Kaplan, adult ads provide about 70% of the Weekly's
approximately $6 million in annual classified advertising. The
paper's total annual ad revenue, he said, is about $25 million. Other
former Weekly executives confirmed Kaplan's figures.</TE>
<TE>   Kaplan also believes that national advertisers -- who conduct
interstate commerce -- also have been victimized by the deal between
Voice Media and New Times.</TE>
<TE>   National advertisers purchase space in the L.A. Weekly through a
consortium called the Assn. of Alternative Newspapers. Space in New
Times' papers is sold through a competing alliance called the Ruxton
Group.</TE>
<TE>   "We were absolutely going head-to-head for every national ad,"
Kaplan said. "It was a huge competition."</TE>
<TE>   Others interviewed by federal prosecutors say the Justice
Department also is interested in the deal's impact on the variety of
journalism in both cities. That does not surprise Hibner.</TE>
<TE>   "Editorial content has been deemed a federal concern under the
Newspaper Preservation Act," he explained. "To the degree this deal
removes editorial choice from consumers, it is bound to concern
Justice."</TE>
<TE>   As one L.A. Weekly staff member, who asked not to be identified
put it: "When one paper eliminates the voice of another paper -- no
matter who or what they stand for -- it's not good for the city and
it's not good for the democratic process. Nobody can argue that the
problem with American journalism is that it has too many voices."</TE>

<LD>Santa Claus stabbed on a hilltop in Nazareth. A bride from Ramallah,
staring into space in her Cleveland home. A modern-day Joseph being
arrested by Israeli soldiers for seeking a place for his wife to give
birth. An angry young Muslim in Brooklyn pulling an elderly Orthodox
Jew from his car and pounding him to the ground.</LD>
<LD>   These images -- allegorical, sad, violent -- come from films about
the Middle East presented in Los Angeles this week at the American
Film Institute's AFI Fest 2002 and the UCLA Film and Television
Archive's "Intangible Cartographies: New Arab Video" program (both
end on Sunday). Over the past two years, the public has seen
countless news-related images from the Middle East but has rarely
experienced personal storytelling from filmmakers working there,
particularly in Arab communities, programmers said.</LD>
<LD>   "One of the motives is to both enrich and complicate people's idea
of what the Arab world is," said David Pendleton, programmer of the
UCLA event.</LD>
<TE>   As the United States gears up for a possible war with Iraq,
filmmakers' perspectives are more pertinent than ever, said Nancy
Collet, director of programming for AFI Fest 2002. "People can see
the similarities between us and people living in the Middle East but
also the differences and gain an understanding of them so they will
not think of them as the enemy," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Filmmaking conditions vary from country to country in the Arab
world, noted John Sinno, president of Seattle-based Arab Film
Distribution, which distributes Arab films in the U.S. Saudi Arabia,
for instance, has no film industry and few, if any, films come out of
Iraq. In some countries, like Syria, the film industry is monopolized
by the government. Morocco and Tunisia have had a vibrant cinema,
financed and influenced by the French.</TE>
<TE>   Until recent financial problems and competition from India cut
into production, Egypt was a leader in film production. But the West
ignored most of the films until the 1980s, when films from Iran
screened at international festivals and won awards, Sinno said. Only
a small fraction of films from the Middle East find their way to the
United States, and less than a handful make it into general
distribution.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike news, films from Arab or Islamic countries offer viewers an
unabridged view of the filmmakers' world, Sinno points out. "By
simply watching a scene you get so much information," he said. "I've
heard people say so many times, 'There are no camels. They drive
cars.' "</TE>
<TE>   AFI's Collet said she scoured festivals worldwide to come up with
the international films from 37 countries shown in the festival,
including a short film from Israel, "Boys, Girls." The films about
the Arab world include:</TE>
<TE>   * "Divine Intervention," a Cannes jury prize winner. In a
patchwork of surreal vignettes, writer-director-actor Elia Suleiman,
42, the son of a Palestinian resistance fighter, reveals the harsh
and uncertain lives of Palestinians living in Nazareth, a city with
the largest Arab population in Israel. In an allegorical sequence,
boys chase Santa Claus, a knife in his chest, up a hill. Motorists,
routinely stopped at a checkpoint between Ramallah and Nazareth, are
humiliated and robbed by armed Israeli soldiers. Neighborhood streets
are peopled with lost tourists, uncooperative neighbors who throw
garbage into one another's yards, and a driver who curses everyone he
sees. Amid the chaos, a couple struggle in vain to keep their love
alive.</TE>
<TE>   * "Wedding in Ramallah," a documentary by Australian Sherine
Salama, daughter of a Palestinian mother and Egyptian father. Salama
follows Bassam Abed, a divorced Palestinian living in Ohio, as he
returns to Ramallah in 2000 to enter into an arranged marriage with
Mariam, an arrogant but sheltered young woman. When violence erupts,
Bassam returns to telephone repair work in Cleveland where his
co-workers confuse Palestine with Pakistan. Mariam and her girlfriend
dream of moving to America for its modern kitchen appliances. But
when Mariam arrives, she finds herself alone and isolated while
Bassam works two jobs to make ends meet.</TE>
<TE>   * "West Bank Brooklyn" a first feature by writer-director-actor
Ghazi Albuliwi, 26, a stand-up comic who was born in Jordan and
raised in Brooklyn by traditional immigrant parents. The film's three
young protagonists, all fictionalized aspects of Albuliwi's own life,
meet the crises of an arranged marriage, the death of a Palestinian
uncle and a job working for a Jewish shut-in. One turns to secular
American values. One becomes a fervent Muslim. One befriends his
Jewish employer. Throughout, the characters are continually tuned to
radio and television news from their parents' homeland. After the
terrorist bombing of the U.S. Navy destroyer Cole, the character
played by Albuliwi is so afraid to appear Arab that he starts
dressing like a Puerto Rican and calling himself "Tito."</TE>
<TE>   "That USS Cole scene could have been 9/11, easily," said Albuliwi,
who attended the AFI festival to look for a distributor for the
$100,000 film he financed with help from family. He said he still
doesn't tell people of his Arab descent. "It's a fear all Arab
Americans have. You don't know what's going to happen," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The AFI festival also includes two films from Iran, "To Stay
Alive," a film from director Dariush Mehrjoui about a poor woman
medical student forced into an arranged marriage with an older,
wealthier man, and "Iranian Spread," about the journey of a
counterfeit bank note and the moral decisions made by the people who
touch it.</TE>
<TE>   The AFI fest has drawn large crowds of ethnic supporters to "Small
Voices," a Filipino film about an inspiring teacher, and "Ararat," a
film by Canadian writer-director Atom Egoyan about the Armenian
genocide. Some filmmakers, however, were not surprised that the films
from and about the Middle East were less well attended by the local
Arab community. The difference, they said, is Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "Before 9/11 when I curated programs, at least half the audience
was Middle Easterners, and most Arabs of one sort or another," said
Jayce Salloum, Canadian filmmaker and UCLA program coordinator for
the series of short, experimental films.</TE>
<TE>   The UCLA program includes "CyberPalestine," a video by Suleiman
that shows a modern-day Joseph looking for shelter so his wife can
give birth. When he is arrested by Israeli soldiers, Mary becomes a
single mother. Many of the shorts are abstract or allegorical,
Salloum said. One danger of using a traditional narrative format is
that they may reinforce stereotypes, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Collet said films from the Middle East can also show Americans how
they are perceived abroad. As shown in "Wedding in Ramallah," media
images have helped create the dream among Middle Easterners of
finding a better life in the United States. "We have stereotypical
images of what Palestinians, Iranians and Israelis are going through
that are not accurate. It's very likely they have the same
stereotypical images of us," she said.</TE>

<HD>The shift from Ozzie to 'The Osbournes'</HD>
<DH>A documentary follows the medium from its tame image of the
1950s to the present day's taboo-breaking shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Suzanne Somers watches the Samantha character get naked on "Sex
and the City," she has to laugh. In the late 1970s, the producers of
Somers' sitcom "Three's Company" had to tussle with the censors just
to get the word "toilet" on the air.</LD>
<LD>   The boundaries have evolved steadily in half a century of
broadcasting, from "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet" to "The
Osbournes." TV Land chronicles that shift in a breezy but revealing
one-hour special, "Inside TV Land: Taboo TV," Sunday at 9 p.m.
Naturally, the network's Web site warns, "Viewer discretion is
advised."</LD>
<LD>   In its early years, the medium was expected to serve as a moral
guidepost for the nation. Married couples slept in adjacent beds and
Barbara "I Dream of Jeannie" Eden had the most famous navel never
seen on TV.</LD>
<TE>   Producers got bolder in the 1970s as Norman Lear tackled bigotry
and other raw topics on "All in the Family" and its spinoffs in the
1970s. "Maude" took on abortion before Roe vs. Wade and "The
Jeffersons" featured the first black-and-white married couple in
prime time.</TE>
<TE>   Taboo busters have often sparked anger. In 1989, "thirtysomething"
lost advertisers when it showed two men talking in bed, but it helped
pave the way for gay-themed series like "Will &amp; Grace."</TE>
<TE>   Despite advertiser pressure, robust ratings have helped producers
such as Steven Bochco of "NYPD Blue" push the limits.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, cable has accelerated change: With its cocktail
of sex, cursing and violence, "The Sopranos" is a hit, like it or
not.</TE>
<TE>   TV, after all, is a business, and low ratings are the biggest
no-no.</TE>

research using radio signals. Dawn Levy, a science writer with
Stanford University's media office, said the correct way to describe
his work is to say it involved bouncing radio signals from Earth to
the moon as a way to map the moon, and bouncing radio signals to
spacecraft exploring planets as a way to study planet atmospheres.</LD>

shows that Key3Media owned before Rosen became its chairman in 2000

<HD>Amgen Sues U.S. Over Payments</HD>
<DH>The biotech firm seeks to block a reduction in the Medicare
rate on outpatient Aranesp use.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Denise Gellene</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moving to protect its turf against archrival Johnson &amp; Johnson in the
lucrative market for anemia treatments, Amgen Inc. on Friday sued the
federal government for slashing the Medicare reimbursement rate on
its drug Aranesp.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, seeks an
injunction to prevent the rate cut, which would make Aranesp more
expensive for hospital outpatient treatment than the Johnson &amp;
Johnson anemia drug Procrit.</LD>
<LD>   At stake is a portion of a Medicare market for anemia drugs worth
nearly $1 billion annually. In its suit, Amgen said it could lose
sales of $86 million to $119 million in 2003 unless an injunction is
granted. According to one congressional study, Medicare drug payments
for Procrit are second only to those for a medication commonly used
for prostate cancer.</LD>
<TE>   Aranesp and Procrit are used to treat patients with anemia caused
by kidney disease or chemotherapy treatments for cancer. Amgen
considers Aranesp, launched just a year ago, its single most
important drug and the key to winning a long-running competition with
its estranged business partner, Johnson &amp; Johnson. J&amp;J markets
Procrit under a contentious 17-year-old licensing agreement with
Amgen, which invented the drug.</TE>
<TE>   Procrit is J&amp;J's brand of EPO, a genetically engineered copy of
the protein that spurs production of red blood cells. Aranesp is a
modified version of the EPO molecule that Amgen said is more potent
than Procrit and does not have to be taken as often. Thousand
Oaks-based Amgen launched Aranesp last year to regain markets it long
ago ceded to J&amp;J in Europe and the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen's dispute with Medicare centers on an arcane pricing
mechanism that assigns higher reimbursement rates to new drugs to
encourage and reward innovation. Medicare proposed in a tentative
reimbursement schedule last summer to cover Aranesp at the higher
rate. Under the proposal, Aranesp would have been a more economical
choice for hospitals than Procrit.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with a potential loss of market share, J&amp;J argued that
Procrit and Aranesp are functionally equivalent and should be
reimbursed at the same rate. After reviewing 40 scientific studies,
meeting with Amgen and J&amp;J representatives and hiring an independent
contractor to review the data, Medicare sided with J&amp;J.</TE>
<TE>   In its suit, Amgen argues that Medicare broke the law when it
lowered the reimbursement rate for Aranesp, and that it used a faulty
methodology to determine equivalent doses of the drugs.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Medicare had no comment on Amgen's suit, which
names Medicare administrator Thomas Scully and Tommy G. Thompson,
secretary of Health and Human Services.</TE>
<TE>   The suit is part of a highly visible campaign on the part of Amgen
to assert its claim in the hospital outpatient market. Late Thursday,
Medicare delivered hundreds of pages of documents to seven
congressional leaders who demanded to see the paperwork that
supported the agency's decision.</TE>
<TE>   Washington health policy analyst Robert Laszewski called the
lawsuit an aggressive step that could signal that Amgen fears losing
on the lobbying front.</TE>
<TE>   But Amgen faces long odds in court, said Ira Loss, a Washington
policy analyst. The company must show that Medicare acted in an
arbitrary manner, ignoring public input and expert opinion, which is
very difficult. "I would not count on them winning any kind of court
decision," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If Amgen fails, it would be a rare setback for the world's largest
biotechnology company, which is among the most aggressive
pharmaceutical companies in Washington. Amgen has successfully
defended its reimbursement rate for Epogen, the brand of EPO it sells
to dialysis patients, despite proposals by Medicare to cut it.</TE>

<HD>Homestore Investors Raise New Claims About AOL Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edmund Sanders</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In March 2001, officials at Homestore Inc. were worried.</LD>
<LD>   Though Wall Street viewed the online real estate company as an
island of stability in a dot-com storm, Westlake Village-based
Homestore was scrambling like everyone else. A grim-faced Peter B.
Tafeen, at the time Homestore's executive vice president, walked into
the office of the chief financial officer and broke the bad news:
Homestore would miss its quarterly revenue target by $15 million.</LD>
<LD>   But Homestore was saved from a Wall Street pounding thanks to a
timely deal with the America Online unit of media giant AOL Time
Warner Inc., according to a description of the deal included in an
amended lawsuit filed Friday by Home- store investors led by the
California teachers pension fund.</LD>
<TE>   The suit raises new claims about AOL's alleged role in propping up
Homestore. It also supports assertions that AOL made to government
investigators that Eric Keller, a fired AOL executive, masterminded
most of the deals. But the suit also claims that others inside AOL
took part in or knew about the activities, including Keller's boss,
David Colburn; AOL Senior Vice President Steven E. Rindner and former
Chief Financial Officer Joseph A. Ripp, now vice chairman of the
Internet unit.</TE>
<TE>   An AOL spokeswoman declined to comment Friday. Keller and Colburn
did not return phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   According to the suit, Keller, Colburn, Tafeen and others helped
devise a plan to secretly allow Homestore to funnel $15 million of
its own money through third-party vendors, then to AOL and back to
Homestore.</TE>
<TE>   AOL's Keller helped Tafeen recruit the third-party vendors, the
suit alleges. Homestore allegedly purchased worthless assets from the
companies, with the understanding that they would use most of the
money to buy advertising on a Web site jointly operated by AOL and
Homestore. As part of a revenue-sharing agreement, Homestore received
$15 million in ad revenue, which it used to meet its Wall Street
targets, the suit alleges.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for Tafeen questioned the allegation Friday, saying
Homestore had other revenue-raising options and would not have needed
to resort to such a deal.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the first deal was completed, AOL began negotiating
to buy Homestore. The lawsuit claims the acquisition was an attempt
by the executives to "cover up" the deal by allowing the bogus
transactions to be written off by the larger AOL in a merger.</TE>
<TE>   Talks fell through, however, and Keller was suspended in the
summer of 2001 when it was discovered that he tried to backdate a
contract to help one of the third-party vendors, according to sources
familiar with the AOL investigation. He was later fired. Colburn was
fired earlier this year. When Keller left, he and Tafeen had been
working on a second ad deal to give Homestore $31.5 million in ad
revenue, the suit claims.</TE>
<TE>   AOL's Rindner and Ripp took over negotiations and began asking
questions about the deal, expressing concerns about whether AOL would
collect the money from the third-party companies, the suit says.
"This, in and of itself, was an acknowledgment by AOL of its
knowledge of the round-trip nature of the deal," the suit says. But
AOL agreed to complete the deal anyway, according to the suit.</TE>

<HD>CEO Received $1-Million Loan, Cadiz Discloses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael A. Hiltzik</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cadiz Inc. disclosed Friday that it made a $1-million loan to
Chairman and Chief Executive Keith Brackpool in July, only weeks
before such loans to corporate officers became illegal.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Monica company reported the July 5 loan as part of a
quarterly filing with federal regulators. Brackpool put up 226,515 of
his Cadiz shares as collateral for the loan.</LD>
<LD>   Cadiz had not previously disclosed the loan, even though
Brackpool's shareholdings were the subject of a separate disclosure
filing in August and were discussed during a conference call with
investors fully a month after the loan was executed.</LD>
<TE>   Such transactions have become controversial as a result of widely
publicized abuses by executives at WorldCom Inc. and other failing
companies. They were among the corporate practices targeted for
reform by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which was making its way through
Congress at the time the loan was executed. The act, which President
Bush signed into law July 31, rendered most corporate loans to
corporate officers illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Blackpool is a close associate of Gov. Gray Davis and an advisor
to him on water policy.</TE>
<TE>   In arranging the one-year, 6% loan from his own company, Brackpool
pledged as collateral Cadiz shares then valued at $1.33 million. The
value of the shares conformed to a provision in the loan document
requiring that Brackpool maintain collateral worth 133% of the
outstanding loan balance as security.</TE>
<TE>   Since the date of the loan, Cadiz shares have plummeted in value.
At Friday's closing price of $1 on Nasdaq, Brackpool's original
pledged shares were worth only $226,515. Cadiz declined Friday to say
how much of the loan remains outstanding but said it is
collateralized "by assets ... in excess of that required under the
note."</TE>
<TE>   Disclosure of the loan comes a month after the Metropolitan Water
District canceled a $150-million water storage partnership with Cadiz
that was expected to produce as much as $1 billion in revenue for the
company over 50 years. Because the company had long promoted the
project as the key to its future, the cancellation raises questions
about Cadiz's long-term viability.</TE>
<TE>   "They had their balance sheet structured to get them to the point
where they'd have the project in place," said Michael Crawford, an
analyst at B. Riley &amp; Co. of Santa Monica and a holder of Cadiz
shares. "That was quashed, and now they have to restructure the
balance sheet." Crawford maintains a "buy" rating on the shares.</TE>
<TE>   In its regular quarterly financial statement Friday, Cadiz
revealed that its finances are more precarious than it had previously
indicated.</TE>
<TE>   In the report for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, the company
said it must raise $15 million in new financing for its Sun World
agricultural subsidiary in the next year, in part as a condition for
renewal of a crucial $35-million credit line from ING Baring Bank. Of
that $15 million, the company said, $5 million would be used to
retire a two-year loan to Sun World that comes due Dec. 31.</TE>
<TE>   Cadiz left unclear how it intends to raise the alternative
financing for Sun World but did say the infusion is crucial to its
survival.</TE>
<TE>   "The company's ability to operate is dependent on our ability to
successfully obtain the working capital" provided by the credit line,
the filing said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the interest rate on the ING loan -- assuming it is
renewed -- would rise dramatically, to as much as 12% annually from
less than 4.8% currently.</TE>
<TE>   The source of the cash Cadiz forwarded to Brackpool is unclear; as
of June 30, five days before the loan, the company said it had only
$1.3 million in cash on hand.</TE>
<TE>   The purpose of the loan was not stated in the documentation
disclosed Friday. But at the time, Brackpool apparently was facing
margin calls on about 500,000 Cadiz shares he had pledged as personal
collateral at an undisclosed bank.</TE>
<TE>   Those shares had lost half their value during June, and the bank
apparently was pressing him to cover the decline. Before he could
make other arrangements, the bank sold the shares on its own, raising
about $2.2 million, according to a previous public filing by
Brackpool.</TE>

<HD>Industrial Output Falls; Consumers More Upbeat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Ahmann</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. industrial output stumbled badly in October, but consumers'
spirits rose early this month, according to reports released Friday
that showed an economy ailing but not crumbling.</LD>
<LD>   Another report showed an unexpectedly sharp rise in wholesale
prices, the largest in nearly two years. However, economists
dismissed the gain as a reflection of temporary factors and not a
sign that long-dormant inflation was stirring.</LD>
<LD>   Industrial production dropped 0.8% last month, the third
consecutive decline and the biggest slide since September 2001, the
Federal Reserve said. Economists had expected a drop of just 0.3%.</LD>
<TE>   Although that report showed the manufacturing sector, which bore
the brunt of last year's recession, backsliding, a separate survey of
consumers offered hope the economy would manage to hold its ground.</TE>
<TE>   The University of Michigan's preliminary November consumer
sentiment index rose to 85 from a nine-year low of 80.6 in October,
market sources said. That put a halt to a five-month slide in
sentiment and beat forecasts of an increase to 82.3.</TE>
<TE>   The data helped calm concerns the holiday shopping season could
prove disturbingly weak, although the optimistic tone was tempered by
the industrial output report, which showed an economy still mired in
what Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan referred to Wednesday as a "soft
patch."</TE>
<TE>   Factory output, which accounts for the largest portion of total
industrial production, slid 0.7% in October, its third straight
monthly drop, but at least some of the decline was due to an auto
parts shortage from a shutdown of West Coast ports that curtailed car
makers.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, industrial output, excluding autos, was down 0.4%,
while output outside the high-tech sector -- computers,
semiconductors and communications equipment -- fell 0.9%.</TE>

<HD>Gateway Shares Drop 15% on Disclosure of SEC Probe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joseph Menn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of personal computer maker Gateway Inc. dropped 15% Friday
after the company disclosed that the Securities and Exchange
Commission is investigating its financial reporting from 2000, the
last time it showed a full-year profit.</LD>
<LD>   The probe began in December 2000 and "appears to be focused on
past activities," Gateway said late Thursday in a statement and a
quarterly regulatory filing.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of the Poway, Calif., company dropped 63 cents to $3.56 on
the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   The inquiry, which could conclude by March, probably focuses on
the same issues that led Gateway to restate its 2000 results in
February 2001, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   That restatement and simultaneous changes in accounting policies
dropped the net income for 2000 by $74.5 million to $241.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the adjustment was from a bigger write-down for
investments in technology companies. Smaller factors included the
correction of accounting irregularities at a foreign subsidiary, an
issue of revenue recognition and increased reserves for loan losses.
Gateway said it didn't expect the probe to have a material effect on
the company's financial position, and it said it had settled
shareholder lawsuits stemming from the restatement with insurance
policy proceeds.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts were unhappy both with the investigation and with the
timing of the news.</TE>
<TE>   "We are somewhat perplexed by Gateway's decision to wait to
disclose the investigation for nearly two years," Banc of America
Securities analyst Joel Wagonfeld wrote to clients Friday.</TE>

<HD>AOL, Cendant Added to Fraud Suit</HD>
<DH>The California State Teachers' Retirement System expands
its existing lawsuit against Homestore and its former executives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. Scott Reckard and Edmund Sanders</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors led by California's teacher-pension fund sued AOL Time
Warner Inc. and Cendant Corp. on Friday, contending that the two
corporate giants played key roles in Homestore Inc. financial frauds
that cost investors hundreds of millions of dollars.</LD>
<LD>   Maintaining that the case "represents the very worst of the
Internet 'bubble,' " the filing greatly expands an earlier lawsuit
that had named as defendants Homestore, five of its former
executives, business partner L90 Inc. and PricewaterhouseCoopers, the
accounting firm that certified Homestore's initial public offering in
1999 and then audited its financial statements.</LD>
<LD>   The amended suit places AOL and Cendant at the top of a list of 17
companies that allegedly helped Homestore inflate its revenue by
$192.6 million in 2000 and 2001. That fraud, the suit alleges,
allowed Westlake Village-based Homestore, which places residential
real estate listings and related services on the Internet, to beat
analysts' expectations and yielded its insiders more than $70 million
in stock-sale profits.</LD>
<TE>   The suit also names 10 individual defendants, seven of whom are
former Homestore executives. They include founder Stuart H. Wolff,
chief deal maker Peter B. Tafeen and three financial executives who
already have pleaded guilty to criminal fraud charges and are now
cooperating with federal authorities. It also names former AOL
executives David Colburn and Eric Keller, along with Richard A.
Smith, the chairman of Cendant's real estate division. New York-based
Cendant franchises the Coldwell Banker, ERA and Century 21
brokerages.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of AOL and Cendant declined to comment Friday on
the suit, which they had not seen. Homestore also declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Accounting practices at AOL, which operates the America Online
Internet service, are being investigated by the Justice Department
and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company also faces
shareholder lawsuits in New York accusing it of accounting fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's amended class-action complaint, seeking damages on behalf
of all Homestore shareholders, was filed in federal court in Los
Angeles by Bay Area law firm Cotchett, Pitre, Simon &amp; McCarthy.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Joseph W. Cotchett referred calls to the California State
Teachers' Retirement System, the lead plaintiff in the case. CalSTRS
Chief Executive Jack Ehnes said that in addition to recovering
losses, he hopes to send a message to Wall Street that corporate
governance must be taken more seriously.</TE>
<TE>   "This case started with a single-company focus, but it's blossomed
into a corporate house of cards," Ehnes asserted.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't just a few low-level employees at one company gone
astray. This is corporate greed at the highest levels."</TE>
<TE>   Ehnes said shareholders lost more than $1 billion, including $9
million by CalSTRS. Homestore's stock peaked in January 2000 at
$122.25 a share. It closed Friday at $1.02, up 2 cents, in Nasdaq
SmallCap trading.</TE>
<TE>   The suit contends Homestore, to meet Wolff's ever more aggressive
revenue goals, began engineering phony deals that grew in complexity
over time.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of AOL, Homestore allegedly bought goods and services
it didn't need from vendors, with the unwritten provision they would
buy advertising on AOL.</TE>
<TE>   AOL then forwarded most of the funds to Homestore via profit
sharing and advertising deals, the suit says.</TE>
<TE>   "It is beyond doubt that AOL knew the exact details of the deal
and knowingly participated in Homestore's scheme to defraud the
investing public," the suit says.</TE>
<TE>   The suit contends that AOL provided critical assistance by
enabling Homestore to meet its quarterly financial targets.</TE>
<TE>   The suit claims that at least four AOL executives knew about the
bogus deals, including Keller and Colburn, who allegedly agreed not
to document some of the transactions to avoid a paper trail.</TE>
<TE>   Neither returned phone calls Friday. Wolff also could not be
reached. A lawyer for Tafeen questioned the allegations against his
client.</TE>
<TE>   Two other AOL executives, Steven E. Rindner and Joseph A. Ripp,
took over one questionable deal after Keller was fired in 2001 and
tried to unwind it, according to the suit. But AOL completed the
deal, even though the executives realized it was improper, the suit
says.</TE>
<TE>   Another company whose AOL dealings have come under scrutiny is
Mountain View, Calif.-based Veritas Software Corp., which said
Thursday that it is cooperating with the SEC's probe of AOL.</TE>
<TE>   The allegedly fraudulent deals with Cendant, a New York-based
franchiser of hotels, rental car agencies and real estate brokerages,
include a highly complex agreement in early 2001 in which Homestore
acquired Cendant's money-losing Move.com online business, plus
Cendant's Welcome Wagon operation, in return for 21.4 million
Homestore shares that were worth $750 million at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Those transactions, the suit says, were linked to another
agreement in which Cendant placed $95 million in a trust with the
understanding it would spend $80 million on Homestore commercial
products and services.</TE>
<TE>   According to the suit, Cendant real estate chief Smith, who joined
Homestore's board, participated in deals designed to generate phony
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The suit contains what the plaintiffs say are details of specific
meetings at which Homestore executives allegedly discussed fraudulent
deals -- even spelling out obscene language purportedly used by a
former executive when he learned that Barbara Alexander, the
Homestore director who headed the company's audit committee, had been
asking bluntly whether the company was "buying" revenue.</TE>
<TE>   It also describes a study commissioned by Joseph Shew, then
Homestore's chief financial officer, that calculated the especially
aggressive deals were actually costing the company $3 for every $1 it
booked as revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The suit describes deals in which Homestore stock or stock
warrants were issued to Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and General Motors Corp.'s
GMAC Mortgage in 1999 and Bank of America Corp. in 2000. The lenders
then announced they would spend millions of dollars marketing their
services on Homestore sites or using Homestore to design their Web
sites, substantially boosting the real estate company's revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The suit describes the BofA deal as an "illegal transaction" and
describes the bank as a "participant" in the schemes, but does not
include it among the defendants. Wells and GMAC aren't named as
defendants or participants. BofA and Wells Fargo representatives
declined to comment. A GM spokesman could not be reached.</TE>

<HD>A Sixth Up Week Posted by Dow</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stronger-than-expected consumer sentiment gave Wall Street a lift
Friday, sending the Dow Jones industrial average to its sixth
straight weekly advance as investors clung to hopes of a
strengthening economic recovery.</LD>
<LD>   Investors fretted over terrorism fears and brokerage downgrades of
General Electric and Intel for much of the day before deciding that a
spate of mixed economic news wasn't so bad after all, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow rose 36.96 points, or 0.4%, to close at 8,579.09. Earlier
in the day, blue chips dropped as much as 81 points.</LD>
<TE>   The broader market finished mixed. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite
fell a fraction of a point to 1,411.14. The broader Standard &amp; Poor's
500 gained 5.56 points, or 0.6%, to 909.83.</TE>
<TE>   Winners led losers by almost 3 to 2 on the New York Stock Exchange
and were about even on Nasdaq. Trading was moderate.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, the Dow gained 0.5% to post its sixth straight
weekly advance -- its longest weekly winning streak in 3 1/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   Nasdaq climbed 3.8% and the S&amp;P 500 rose 1.7% after snapping a
four-week winning streak last week.</TE>
<TE>   Early Friday, stocks may have been held back by an FBI warning of
a possible new Al Qaeda attack.</TE>
<TE>   But a reported rise in the University of Michigan's consumer
sentiment index for November later buoyed expectations for holiday
spending.</TE>
<TE>   Among the day's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * GE fell 64 cents to $23.86 after J.P. Morgan Securities cut the
company's stock to "underweight" and trimmed its 2003 estimates,
questioning the credibility of the firm's forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   * Intel dropped 41 cents to $18.80 after Merrill Lynch downgraded
the chip maker's stock to "sell" from "neutral."</TE>
<TE>   * Citigroup helped boost the Dow, advancing 76 cents to $36.90.
The bank's Salomon Smith Barney unit and rival Credit Suisse First
Boston would pay fines of about $200 million each to federal and
state regulators to settle probes into the firms' stock research, a
source familiar with the talks said.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street's biggest firms have been holding talks with
regulators to resolve conflict-of-interest questions with a broad
settlement that would include fines and changes in how research
departments operate.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, FleetBoston Financial said it was negotiating with
regulators to settle probes into the underwriting of new stock
offerings by Robertson Stephens, its brokerage unit, which is in the
process of closing. FleetBoston shares rose 22 cents to $24.93.</TE>
<TE>   * Friday's gainers included Santa Clara-based Roxio, which rose 47
cents to $3.85 after saying it would buy Napster.</TE>
<TE>   Gap rose 92 cents to $14.82 after the clothing retailer reported
third-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street's estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Among other retailers, Kohl's jumped $3.19 to $66.90 and Ross
Stores gained 97 cents to $44.95.</TE>

<HD>Messier Dogged by Questions</HD>
<DH>The former Vivendi Universal chief, out promoting a book on
his tenure, is unable to keep attention away from government probes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Achrene Sicakyuz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Deposed Vivendi Universal Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier stepped
into the spotlight Friday to promote his new tell-all book, "My True
Diary," about his stormy tenure at the top of the giant media
conglomerate.</LD>
<LD>   But the reporters he had summoned were more interested in the
troubled chapter that has come since he left the company.</LD>
<LD>   Messier was peppered with questions about the investigations
tprosecutors in France and the United States have launched amid
allegations of fraud and other corporate misdeeds while Messier was
at the helm.</LD>
<TE>   "I refuse to discuss these investigations. Vivendi is no Enron,"
he said, referring to the fallen U.S. energy trader, "so I am not
afraid to go to jail."</TE>
<TE>   "Let the judges do their job," Messier added at the news
conference, which capped a weeklong media blitz.</TE>
<TE>   Messier said he had not received a summons from magistrates
investigating the case in Paris, but was ready to answer officials'
questions about Vivendi's accounts.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been no fraud or financial manipulation at Vivendi," he
insisted.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi, under Messier's watch, is being investigated on several
fronts.</TE>
<TE>   France's market watchdog has been scrutinizing the company's
financial records. Prosecutors in Paris also have been investigating
whether Vivendi falsified financial reports to calm investors. The
company's stock price has plummeted 80% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Across the Atlantic, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District
of New York has opened a preliminary criminal investigation, while
the Securities and Exchange Commission's Miami office has been
conducting an informal inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   Since a boardroom coup led to his ouster last summer, Messier has
spent much of his time writing his new memoir, which chronicles his
reversal of fortune. In it, he reminisces about his days at the top
-- when he went rafting with Bill Gates and had tete-a-tetes with
Robert Redford. Such encounters helped him cultivate an image as a
jet-setting Hollywood executive, but drew the ire of France's more
staid corporate elite.</TE>
<TE>   Messier acknowledges making mistakes while transforming the
historic water company into a media giant designed to rival AOL Time
Warner Inc. Under Messier's leadership, Vivendi bought Universal's
entertainment holdings and accumulated nearly $19 billion in media
debt.</TE>
<TE>   "We may have done too much too fast," he writes. "We should have
limited our transactions to the most strategic ones and not cared
about the ones that had less priority."</TE>
<TE>   But Messier says he is by no means the only one to blame.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been converging elements and mistakes I made, but also
the shift of the market that led to this situation," he said at the
news conference.</TE>
<TE>   Messier's publisher, Balland, had no information Friday on how
sales were going but said 40,000 copies had been printed -- a sizable
distribution in France.</TE>
<TE>   Messier's book-tour-turned-media-offensive angered some Parisians.
"He is so disconnected from the basic citizen," said Isabelle
Roelhich, 35, a translator who vowed never to buy the book. "I think
he is repugnant. He gave a very arrogant image of France, and I think
it's a shame."</TE>

<LD>Microsoft Corp. for the first time is providing details on how much
money its individual products are earning -- and losing.</LD>
<LD>   The figures contained in the software giant's fiscal first-quarter
filing late Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission
include no major surprises.</LD>
<LD>   But the numbers underscore how patient the Redmond, Wash., firm is
with units that are a long way from breaking even -- and the enormous
profitability of the flagship products, which allow Microsoft to keep
investing in new areas for years.</LD>
<TE>   At the head of the cash-cow list is Windows, the operating system
powering more than 90% of the world's personal computers. Microsoft's
"client" division, which is home to Windows, boasted operating income
of $2.48 billion on sales of $2.89 billion in the three months ended
Sept. 30.</TE>
<TE>   The "information worker" division -- driven by the Office set of
word-processing, spreadsheet and other programs -- produced income of
$1.88 billion on sales of $2.39 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The only other segment in the black was the one producing
Microsoft's server operating systems, which reaped $519 million on
sales of $1.52 billion. All three of these divisions improved in
sales and profit from a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Some of that money went to finance the four other operating
businesses, the most costly of which was "home and entertainment,"
featuring the Xbox video game console. That unit lost $177 million on
sales of $505 million.</TE>
<TE>   Negative profit margins also were attributed to the MSN Internet
access and services segment, which lost $97 million on sales of $531
million; and hand-held and mobile phone software, which drained $33
million on sales of $17 million.</TE>
<TE>   And the "business solutions" effort to sell software to small- and
medium-size businesses, lost $68 million on sales of $107 million.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft shares lost 30 cents Friday to close at $56.69 in Nasdaq
trading.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In a blow to the tobacco industry, the Louisiana Supreme Court has
ordered a plan for a class-action trial that will first focus a
jury's attention on whether cigarette makers conspired to keep
smokers hooked.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, filed in 1996, asks for the tobacco industry to pay for
smoking cessation programs and medical monitoring for Louisiana
smokers. The trial's first phase will concentrate on such issues as
the marketing of cigarettes to children, alleged manipulation of
nicotine levels and whether the industry engaged in fraud and
conspiracy.</LD>

<LD>A federal grand jury is investigating a 2000 El Paso Corp. natural
gas pipeline explosion that killed 12 people and has subpoenaed
internal company documents, the company said.</LD>
<LD>   There was no indication whether the probe is a criminal
investigation, but the involvement of the U.S. attorney's office

investigation and another by the Department of Transportation's

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission filed an emergency request in
U.S. District Court in Riverside this week to halt the sale of
securities in Carlsbad-based California AutoCare Corp., an auto
repair company that the SEC said is controlled by Joseph Sanfellipo
of Laguna Beach.</LD>
<LD>   The court issued a temporary restraining order late Thursday and
appointed a receiver and froze the assets of the defendants, SEC
senior trial counsel Karen Matteson said. Matteson alleged that
Sanfellipo's company raised $1 million from about 1,000 investors
over a two-month period by materially misstating the company's
operations and prospects.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC accused Sanfellipo and three others, James E. Gasper of
Solana Beach, Kimball R. Vance of La Quinta and Elihu M. Sigal of
Palm Desert, of violating federal broker-dealer registration
provisions. Sanfellipo was also accused of violating anti-fraud
provisions of federal securities laws.</LD>
<TE>   None of the defendants could be reached for comment Friday. Calls
to company offices were not returned.</TE>
<TE>   Sanfellipo was the target of a previous SEC action. In 1998, he
was ordered by the commission to cease and desist from future
securities fraud violations in connection with the sale of securities
in Packaging Plus, which the SEC alleged had materially overstated
its assets, revenue and income.</TE>
<TE>   A hearing on whether a preliminary injunction should be issued
against the defendants is scheduled for Nov. 25.</TE>

<HD>Overseas Sales Help Parent of Sizzler</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Increased sales Down Under helped the parent of the Sizzler steak
restaurant chain post a fourfold increase in earnings for its second
quarter ended Oct. 13, the parent firm said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Sherman Oaks-based Worldwide Restaurant Concepts Inc. said net
income for the quarter was $1.4 million, or 5 cents per share,
compared with last year's $355,000, or 1 cent per share.</LD>
<LD>   Revenue was $64.4 million, a gain of 7.5% over the $59.9 million
posted in the same period last year.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the upbeat news, Worldwide shares lost 27 cents Friday to
close at $2.22 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The company -- which emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
in 1997 -- owns, operates or franchises 322 Sizzler restaurants in
the U.S. and abroad.</TE>
<TE>   It also operates 109 KFC restaurants, primarily in Australia, and
is planning to expand its Pat &amp; Oscar's quick-casual restaurant
chain, which has 15 outlets, mostly in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Charles Boppell said that though domestic
same-store sales were down -- 4% for Pat &amp; Oscar's and 1% for Sizzler
-- sales were up in Australia. Sizzler Australia saw a 9.4% hike in
same-store sales and KFC reported a 5.9% gain over the year-ago
period.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy has slowed our domestic sales growth," Boppell said.
"Our guests are managing their checks down in this difficult
environment."</TE>

<HD>Sports Agent Steinberg's Firm Awarded $45 Million</HD>
<DH>Jury determines that rival stole information and clients
and threatened blackmail.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ralph Frammolino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sports super-agent Leigh Steinberg won a decisive victory Friday when
a jury awarded his Newport Beach firm $45 million after finding that
a former protege unfairly started a rival agency and stole away some
of football's biggest names.</LD>
<LD>   The award capped a bitter six-week trial in Los Angeles federal
court that pitted Steinberg, whose career was an inspiration for the
hit movie "Jerry Maguire," against former best friend and partner
David Dunn, considered one of the most savvy contract negotiators in
pro football.</LD>
<LD>   Steinberg's reputation took a thrashing in the trial. The agent
admitted to battling alcoholism and witnesses for Dunn and his
breakaway company, Athletes First, portrayed Steinberg as an
out-of-touch businessman and abusive boss. Former Super Bowl
quarterback Drew Bledsoe, now of the Buffalo Bills, took the stand to
say he was among those athletes who followed Dunn to the new firm
because he was disgusted by Steinberg's boorish behavior.</LD>
<TE>   But in making the award, the eight-person jury shrugged off those
criticisms and sided with Steinberg's firm, Steinberg &amp; Moorad. It
had contended that Dunn and five other former employees plundered
everything from players' cell phone numbers to proprietary
information such as whether certain athletes preferred grass to
artificial turf. After the February 2001 office rebellion, Dunn and
company allegedly threatened to blackmail Steinberg into silence.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, I haven't lived a perfect life, but I don't think anybody
has," Steinberg said Friday from Miami, where he was with one of his
clients, running back Ricky Williams of the Miami Dolphins. But "as
it regards representing athletes, I've tried to comport myself with
as much dignity and honor as possible."</TE>
<TE>   He added that he was "excited, gratified and pleased" that jurors
"saw through the unethical behavior, lies and character
assassination" by Dunn and Athletes First.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn and Athletes First vowed to appeal the verdict, which they
said demonstrated the difficulty faced by small firms that "become
the litigation target of a billion-dollar company admittedly out for
'a pound of flesh.' "</TE>
<TE>   Asked if the award ultimately would put Athletes First out of
business, as was claimed during closing arguments, general counsel
Mark Humenik said, "I think that's certainly a strong possibility."</TE>
<TE>   The jury found against Dunn and his firm on four key issues:
breach of contract, unfair competition, tortious inducement of breach
of contract and tortious interference with prospective economic
advantage. It rejected claims of false advertising.</TE>
<TE>   The total damages awarded to Steinberg &amp; Moorad amounted to $44.66
million. The jury socked Dunn personally with $2 million in
compensatory damages and an additional $2.66 million in punitive
damages, finding he acted with "oppression, fraud and malice."
Athletes First was hit for $20 million in compensatory and $20
million in punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't enough for Steinberg. His legal team plans to return
to U.S. District Judge Ronald S. W. Lew's courtroom next week to
request as much as $70 million in additional damages by arguing that
Dunn "unjustly enriched" himself by that amount. It also wants a
ruling barring Dunn from representing any clients who formerly were
represented by Steinberg's firm.</TE>
<TE>   The jury, which deliberated 3 1/2 days, also rejected three
counterclaims by Dunn.</TE>
<TE>   Juror Irvin DePriest, a former parole officer, would say only that
no single piece of evidence tipped the decision. "I think it was
everything collectively," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Dunn accused Assante Corp., the Canadian financial
services firm that bought Steinberg &amp; Moorad in 1999, of fraudulently
inducing him to sign a three-year extension to his employment
contract.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for Steinberg's firm, however, maintained that Dunn had
willingly agreed to the contract that forbade him from competing with
his old employer for two years if he were to quit.</TE>
<TE>   The attorneys also introduced evidence that Dunn and others tried
to blackmail Steinberg into silence after they left. The most telling
document was a memo written last January by Brian G. Murphy, now
chief operating officer of Athletes First, detailing Steinberg's
failings. Murphy wrote that Steinberg's fear of having such secrets
made public "could prove to be useful in negotiating a settlement."</TE>
<TE>   "If we wanted to, we could rip apart his marriage, his reputation
and his career," Murphy said, adding that the mere threat of exposure
would "drive Leigh insane."</TE>
<TE>   Steinberg said Friday that the memo played an important part in
the case. "I think it was a very damning document," he said.</TE>

<HD>Former Policyholder Takes Insurer to Task</HD>
<DH>Chiropractor's disability benefits were cut off by
UnumProvident</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Girion</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the eve of the birth of her first child 12 years ago, Joan
Hangarter bought an insurance policy that would pay her a monthly
benefit if a disability ever prevented her from working as a
chiropractor.</LD>
<LD>   Hangarter kept up her end of the bargain, sending in monthly
premium checks for more than seven years that totaled more than
$3,000 annually. When a painful joint condition forced her to quit
her $100,000-a-year practice in 1997, she began collecting her
$8,100-a-month disability benefit. But after 18 months, her insurance
company, now part of UnumProvident Corp., canceled her payments,
declaring that she was no longer disabled.</LD>
<LD>   Now a divorced mother with two children, Hangarter, 53, has
struggled for more than three years to get by without the payments.
She lost the home she was about to buy when UnumProvident cut her
off. The family was evicted and for a time lived on welfare.</LD>
<TE>   Hangarter sued and this year won a $7.67-million jury verdict. The
award was upheld Wednesday by a federal judge in San Francisco. The
company is appealing.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Novato, Calif., woman who was so proud of the home
and lifestyle she once provided for her family recently filled out
school free-lunch applications for her son and daughter and begged
the local youth softball and soccer programs to let them play for

<TE>   "This company caused my worst nightmare to come true," she said.
"They are hurting people. They are destroying people's lives."</TE>
<TE>   Hangarter is one of many policyholders across the country who
blame Chattanooga, Tenn.-based UnumProvident for cutting off their
payments and plunging them into hardship and despair.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's largest seller of disability insurance is fighting
scores of lawsuits that accuse it of using improper hardball tactics
to cut legitimate claims in an effort to boost its bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   In upholding Hangarter's award this week, U.S. Magistrate James
Larson ordered the company to refrain from many of the tactics
alleged in the suits, including using biased doctors to make
assessments, spying on policyholders' activities and shredding claims
information.</TE>
<TE>   J. Christopher Collins, UnumProvident's senior vice president and
deputy general counsel, accused plaintiffs' lawyers of "demonizing"
responsible claims management practices.</TE>
<TE>   "Our claims decisions are made within the context of a sound, fair
process that we have worked hard to build," the company said in a
statement. "Still, we can and do make mistakes. And when we become
aware of an error on our part, we work urgently to correct the
situation."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the suits portray the benefit cutoffs as part of an ongoing
scheme. According to court documents, UnumProvident increased its
"net termination ratio" target -- the value of terminated claims
compared with new claims -- from 84% to 90% in 1996. By the end of
1997, that goal was 124%.</TE>
<TE>   The company aggressively sold so-called own-occupation disability
policies to self-employed professionals such as Hangarter in the
1980s and early 1990s. People in California and Florida were primary
sales targets.</TE>
<TE>   "They sold these policies when the market was real good," said
Tampa, Fla., lawyer Frank Winkles, who has several suits pending
against the company. "They could invest premiums and make lots of
money." But two things then happened, said Winkles: The market
softened "and they found out these professionals get sick just like
everybody else."</TE>
<TE>   Ray Bourhis, the San Francisco lawyer who represents Hangarter,
said he is considering a class-action lawsuit on behalf of
policyholders who may not be aware that their claims never should
have been terminated.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to be responsible for what has happened in the past,"
he said. "This is not just some mistake. It is unconscionable to deny
disability benefits to people with AIDS, with heart disease, with
Parkinson's, who are quadriplegic."</TE>
<TE>   Hangarter was pregnant with her daughter when an insurance agent
approached her about buying the disability policy.</TE>
<TE>   "She was very insistent," Hangarter recalled. "She explained to me
this would keep a roof over my head if anything should happen. She
said unexpected things occur, and I was going to be a mother. So it
just clinched at that point.... How could I not?"</TE>
<TE>   When doctors told her she could no longer perform the physically
demanding body manipulations her patients needed, Hangarter was glad
she had purchased the insurance. Then the company dropped her.
UnumProvident maintained this week that she no longer was disabled.</TE>
<TE>   "Joan Hangarter is a chiropractor with tennis elbow," Collins
said.</TE>
<TE>   But Judge Larson said the company's conduct was so egregious that
the jury had ample reason to include $5 million in punitive damages
in its award to Hangarter. MRI evidence showed and doctors testified
that she suffers from a worsening condition that causes severe pain
in her shoulder, arms, elbow and neck.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite conclusive evidence that plaintiff was unable to work,"
Larson wrote, "defendants subjected her to a biased medical
examination, then re-characterized her occupation as a business
owner, rather than a chiropractor, and claimed she was not totally
disabled because she could perform bookkeeping or teach a class or
two or see two patients per hour."</TE>
<TE>   Hangarter said the notion that she would fake her disability makes
no sense.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved my patients," she said. "I had a fabulous practice. I
loved what I did. It wasn't a job. I owned that practice for 18
years. It was a life. Why would I deliberately walk away?"</TE>
<TE>   The day the jury sided with Hangarter, she left the courthouse and
went to the store with food stamps.</TE>
<TE>   It could be years before the company exhausts its appeals, and in
the meantime she is surviving off a loan she took out as an advance
on her judgment.</TE>

<HD>Webcasters Free to Reach Deals</HD>

<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Webcasting bill passed by Congress early Friday morning could
save many small Internet radio stations from financial ruin, but it
does little to solve the fundamental problems facing the Webcasting
industry.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, H.R. 5469, leaves numerous Webcasters in the same
dilemma they've been in for months: Unless they can persuade record
labels to accept lower fees, they'll have to pay a sizable amount of
their revenues in royalties to labels and artists.</LD>
<LD>   The measure would give SoundExchange -- the royalties arm of the
Recording Industry Assn. of America -- the freedom to strike deals
with small commercial Webcasters and noncommercial Internet stations,
including college and community broadcasters. It also would give
those Webcasters a one- to six-month reprieve from royalties so they
can try to negotiate discounts.</LD>
<TE>   One group of small Webcasting businesses already has reached
agreement with the RIAA, and the bill would allow them to implement
that deal. The same terms would be available to other small
Webcasters, but some say the rates -- either 8% to 12% of revenue or
5% to 7% of expenses -- are unacceptably high.</TE>
<TE>   The prospects for other Webcasters seeking lower rates aren't
good, said attorney David Oxenford, who bargained for the group. "I
know how hard our group had to fight to get the numbers that we got,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the political support that small Webcasters found in Congress
should help them as they seek better terms, said Alex Alben, vice
president for public policy at Webcasting technology firm
RealNetworks Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the RIAA is negotiating in good faith to create a stable
base for Webcasting," Alben said. "And they should, right? They get
paid a royalty on Webcasting; they don't get paid a royalty on
regular broadcasting."</TE>
<TE>   Internet radio has grown rapidly in popularity since it was
launched in the mid-1990s. Its hallmark is a diversity of programming
that's hard to find on conventional radio.</TE>
<TE>   That's why many artists and labels are eager to see Webcasting
flourish. However, they want entrepreneurs to pay for the music they
use to build their businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their growth, many Webcasters have struggled financially
in the midst of a broad advertising slump. Low royalties, they say,
will give them time to establish themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Stations that don't strike their own deals must pay the rates set
in July by the Librarian of Congress: 0.07 cent per listener per song
for commercial stations, and 0.02 cent for noncommercial ones.</TE>
<TE>   Hilary Rosen, chief executive of the RIAA, said her group would
rather negotiate deals with Webcasters than have the royalties set by
arbitrators.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand that people don't want to pay what's there. But
businesses have costs, and this is one of their costs." She added,
"I'm not sure that we have further obligation to build [the
Webcasters'] profits. We've extended ourselves pretty far."</TE>
<TE>   The two sides have had trouble finding a middle ground, and few
Webcasters have been able to strike royalties deals. The shortage of
negotiated agreements led federal arbitrators and the Librarian of
Congress to rely on a single deal between the RIAA and Internet
powerhouse Yahoo Inc. when setting royalty rates for the entire
industry.</TE>
<TE>   That's one of the fundamental flaws in the arbitration process,
critics say. Another problem is the expense, which deters small and
noncommercial Webcasters from taking part.</TE>
<TE>   Although there was a broad consensus in favor of overhauling the
way royalties are set, there wasn't enough time late in the session
to do that, said David Whitney, chief counsel for Sen. Jesse Helms
(R-N.C.). A former broadcaster, Helms intervened in the waning days
of the Senate to help reach the final compromises in H.R. 5469.</TE>
<TE>   The main goal was to clear the way for negotiated settlements,
rather than imposing rates and terms on Webcasters -- particularly
those who weren't at the bargaining table, Whitney said. He added
that the RIAA has said it wants to negotiate market-based rates, "and
that's a process we want to encourage."</TE>

<AU>Milla Goldenberg</AU>
<BD>Milla Goldenberg is a graduate student in journalism at
USC.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We've all been through it. We sit at the computer, morning coffee in
hand, directing our browsers to the venerable www.nytimes.com. The
home page loads the latest news on the screen, ready for our eager
eyes. We click on the top story and begin the journey. And just as
we're getting to the good stuff, a few paragraphs in, zoooom!</LD>
<LD>   A digital car drives by, trailed by the Honda logo. Or maybe it's
the Absolut vodka bottle, doing a little interactive dance as you
move your mouse over it.</LD>
<LD>   Creative ads, yes, but what are they doing in the New York Times?
And on www.washingtonpost.com, www.latimes.com, www.msnbc.com,
www.salon.com and virtually every other popular Web site around, news
and otherwise? I've never clicked on the ads, and I suspect many
others haven't either. Not only are they annoying, they're
ineffective, as their appearance makes me less likely to visit the
site again or buy the advertisers' products. It's the worst form of
marketing -- a blitzkrieg that renders viewers helpless. There's no
way to bypass it, and when it finally ends and allows me to resume my
news reading, something's lost.</LD>
<TE>   As studies show, Web readers like myself scan the news, often
perusing just headlines in the interest of saving time. We don't have
10 seconds to spare on a full-screen AT&amp;T Web commercial, complete
with annoying jingle.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, Web sites need to cover costs through advertising, just
as newspapers and broadcasters do. But TV commercials can be switched
off and newspaper print ads that are not of interest can be easily
ignored. Why can't sites just stick to the flashing banner ads that
instruct me to "catch the monkey to win $20"? News organizations
should be ashamed; www.nytimes.com, which breaks Internet records
with its 10 million visitors a month, is the worst offender -- a
playground bully that can get away with anything.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, the Web was founded on free exchange, and as the dot-bomb
crash proved, making a site profitable is difficult (except,
apparently, for pornographers). Yet even these screen-invading ads
haven't helped digital news make a buck. In a survey of 429 newspaper
Web sites worldwide, just 17% reported earning a profit.</TE>
<TE>   Some Web news sites, battered by plummeting ad revenue, are
starting to charge for access, which only drives readers away. Others
have decreased the frequency of the ads because of reader complaints
and are thinking of charging users. But the online Wall Street
Journal, which recently raised its subscription rate, is losing money
despite its 642,000 paying subscribers. So what can be done?</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps news companies should stop separating their digital
budgets from their paper and broadcast ones. Or maybe they should
take a lesson from the digital Topeka Capital-Journal, which in 2001
reported profit exceeding $500,000, made in part by building Web
sites for corporate clients and branding itself as an information
center that hosts local mini-sites.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the only hope for these sites is to make a superior product
that attracts the most readers, enabling them to suspend the most
annoying ads and charge advertisers premium banner rates. Maybe
that's a daydream, but I need something to think about while the
10-second AT&amp;T commercial is obscuring the news on my screen.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The following is from a column by California prison inmate Vonda
White. She is the cellmate of Jeri Becker, a convicted murderer
recently approved for parole by the state parole board and lauded for
her rehabilitation; Gov. Gray Davis, however, reversed the parole
board. White, also convicted of murder, has served 25 years of a
seven-year-to-life sentence. Her column appears in a publication of
the Catholic Women's Network of Santa Clara County.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Many years ago when my roommate Jeri and I first met, we agreed on
a premise: that when equally matched, the positive tends to outweigh
the negative. After agreeing, we proceeded to test our premise at a
"Long Termer'' meeting at which a large group of frustrated and
dissatisfied women had targeted the chair of the organization and
were determined to put her out of office (as though such an action
would solve their problem). Because of Jeri's determined positive
action and my equally determined positive support at that meeting,
the large negative faction did not prevail.</LD>
<TE>   On a larger scale these days, we find ourselves bending to another
seemingly overwhelming negative force, the governor's policy of "The
Only Way You Will Parole Is in a Pine Box."</TE>
<TE>   Those of us who are responsible for taking a life are expected to
(and do) work unceasingly to rehabilitate ourselves, to learn to
recognize and heal our deepest problems, and to show that we have
deep anguish over the gravity of our actions and have sought with our
whole souls to make what amends are possible.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it is not for us to decide when and if we are suitable
for parole, and when denied, we are left feeling defeated and
hopeless for a time. We cannot live indefinitely like this, year
after year; in time, a death sentence looks easier to bear. And when
finally found suitable for parole and faced with a wall even higher
and more implacable than the first, the resulting strain and anxiety
are correspondingly greater.</TE>
<TE>   These days, being found suitable for parole is like being stuck in
a revolving door that brings us to the exit, then doesn't stop. It
catapults us right back inside.</TE>
<TE>   We don't cope very well. We weep uncontrollably at the smallest
things, or not at all when we should be upset. We flatten out, sleep
a lot, eat a lot and blow up, or eat nothing and wither. We go into
negativity, seeing the world with a "nothing good about life"
attitude.</TE>
<TE>   We get sick, catch every cold and flu in season, have migraines,
exaggerated PMS and menopausal symptoms, develop exotic diseases and
some not-so-exotic but more deadly, like cancer and heart disease.
And we die steadily at younger ages.</TE>
<TE>   We become compulsive/obsessive, smoking like chimneys, throwing
ourselves perpetually into work, physical exercise, art, cleaning
frenzies -- and yes, drug use, both legal and illegal. We haunt the
clinics, mental and medical, and we go to church as though our lives
depended upon our presence there.</TE>
<TE>   We escape into television and books, sex and rock 'n' roll -- all
without balance, because alone, we don't have the means to restore it
any more than we had the means previously, to rise above the traumas
that brought us down to this point in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, no situation is utterly hopeless, and each of us can
return to life and hope, even though in the throes of damaging events
we are often too numb to recognize the hand of God working in us and
for us. It is then that we need the strength of one another -- the
love and compassion that grow with our own dawning sense of the
possibility of the positive.</TE>

<LD>Environmentalists are bracing for the return of the undead in
Congress, particularly the opening of the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge to oil drilling. This proposed industrialization of fragile
tundra will almost certainly return to life with the new Republican
Senate majority.</LD>
<LD>   Other Bush administration proposals that will continue to speed
along include the smashing of popular rules to restrict polluting
snowmobiles in national parks, the revved-up opening of public land
for destructive coal mining and oil and gas drilling and even an
attack on the nation's most basic environmental law.</LD>
<LD>   There was no substantial debate on the environment in the midterm
campaign, overshadowed as it was by terrorism and related matters.
This has allowed the administration to work quietly and attract
little attention to many of its initiatives.</LD>
<TE>   One of the administration's more obscure moves may be its most
far-reaching -- an attack on enforcement of the landmark National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969, signed into law by President Nixon.
The Bush team wants to limit the required environmental studies on
the effects of energy production, logging and other controversial
uses of federal waters and land. An assistant Interior secretary,
Lynn Scarlett, said the administration wanted to return to the
original intent of the law as a "tool that can help us make wise
decisions."</TE>
<TE>   This is bureaucratic doubletalk. Environmental studies often
disclose unexpected potential for major damage. They also measure
cumulative effects. They allow the public to participate by attending
meetings and writing to the agency involved. They force federal
agencies to weigh the value of a project -- from a highway
modification to a strip mine -- against the harm caused, to consider
alternatives and mitigate damage. Under the reinterpretation, many
federal actions can be exempted. Others can proceed with a
less-rigorous environmental "assessment."</TE>
<TE>   The process can be cumbersome. That's the way it should be. The
law forces federal officials to think harder about the consequences
of their actions and gives citizens some say in how the federal
estate is cared for.</TE>
<TE>   The law itself says its purpose is to recognize "the critical
importance of restoring and maintaining environmental quality"
through the use of "all practicable means and measures." The
administration must not remold it to fit a different intent.</TE>

<LD>The day after 9/11, the French newspaper Le Monde published the
memorable headline, "We are all Americans." A year later, it's nearly
impossible to imagine that phrase on French lips -- or in much of
Europe.</LD>
<LD>   The French government prolonged the United Nations debate on Iraq
for weeks. Germany, still host to more than 70,000 U.S. troops and
once home to nuclear missiles aimed at the Soviet Union, recently
ended a national election campaign that turned on who could deliver
the sharpest denunciation of Washington's possible invasion of Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   The lightning rod for these sharp cross-Atlantic divisions is
Iraq, but the underlying reason is deeper: a fundamental concern
about U.S. power and how it will be used.</LD>
<TE>   American foreign policy writer Robert Kagan, viewing the United
States from his base in Belgium, argues that "Americans are from Mars
and Europeans are from Venus," a divide he thinks will endure. Kagan
writes in the magazine Policy Review that Americans generally split
the world into good and evil, friends and enemies. Europeans see a
more complex picture. Kagan says U.S. military strength produces a
propensity to use that strength, while Europe's military weakness
produces an aversion to using power.</TE>
<TE>   America is a "behemoth with a conscience," Kagan says, a believer
that its power must be a means of promoting a liberal world order.
But at least some Europeans believe that their continent's postwar
integration of nations, especially the linking of historical enemies
France and Germany in the European Union, shows that the rule of law
can trump sheer power.</TE>
<TE>   The foreign affairs commissioner of the European Union, Chris
Patten, recognizes the differences between Europe and the United
States but emphasizes the bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Patten said in an address to the Chicago Council on Foreign
Relations that Europe and the U.S. were simultaneous "cousins and
strangers" trying to overcome differences that derived from history
and geography. The cross-Atlantic partners were unified in the Cold
War; more recently they have worked closely on peacekeeping in
Afghanistan and freezing terrorists' bank accounts. But Patten said
Europeans might not have understood "the extent of the U.S. trauma"
caused by 9/11. To them, the "war on terror" is a metaphor; to
Americans it's actual combat against those who exposed U.S.
vulnerability at home. Still, Patten chided Americans for branding as
appeasers Europeans who tried to discern causes for alienation and
hatred that led to terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Tensions between allies are not new. President Franklin D.
Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill did not see
eye to eye on every aspect of their partnership in waging World War
II. The Bush administration has gained a reputation for unilateralism
and a willingness to go it alone, but it accepted European advice to
seek support at the United Nations for its campaign to disarm Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides need to understand the roots of each other's
positions. Both U.S. military "hard power" and Europe's "soft power"
of peacekeeping and foreign aid have a necessary place in the world.
This adds up to more than America making dinner and Europe doing the
dishes.</TE>

<LD>When the last fugitive member of the so-called Symbionese Liberation
Army appeared in a South Africa court this week, dozens of colleagues
at the university where he was a lecturer turned out to cheer him.
They called James Kilgore -- they knew him by a false name -- a
caring man, deeply committed to social causes. Friends and neighbors
said similar things about four other former SLA "soldiers" who had
gone on to be parents and professionals with mortgages, no more a
threat to society today than, well, Myrna Opsahl was 27 years ago
when she went to deposit church collections at a suburban Sacramento
bank and was shot to death during a robbery.</LD>
<LD>   Emily Montague, Bill Harris, Michael Bortin and Sara Jane Olson
pleaded guilty last week to second-degree murder in that 1975
slaying. A day later, Kilgore was arrested in Cape Town. He is
awaiting extradition and reportedly negotiating for the same
six-to-eight-year sentence reached in the others' plea agreements.</LD>
<TE>   The mystery is not how these graying baby boomers, now older than
the mother of four they left to bleed to death, went on to live
upstanding, middle-class lives but how they lived almost three
decades with their own lies. The first lie was that the mayhem
wrought by their crackpot band of wannabe revolutionaries was a
normal response to abnormal times -- a reaction to the turbulence of
the war in Vietnam and other upheavals of the late 1960s and early
1970s. While millions of protesters marched peacefully for free
speech, civil rights and an end to the war, the SLA's first act --
soon overshadowed by the kidnapping of newspaper heiress Patty Hearst
-- was assassinating Oakland's first African American school
superintendent for supporting mandatory high school IDs. Some
revolution.</TE>
<TE>   Harris and Montague served eight years in prison for the Hearst
kidnapping and other crimes; the late recruit Olson, like Kilgore,
went underground. All vehemently denied having anything to do with
the robbery-turned-homicide, even after Olson's 2000 arrest on
decades-old charges of conspiring to plant pipe bombs under Los
Angeles police cars triggered the reopening of the case. They denied
it, that is, until the making of a plea agreement, which the Opsahl
family supported on the condition that the defendants publicly
acknowledge responsibility. In court last week, one by one, they did
so.</TE>
<TE>   The slaying, said Montague, a computer consultant who lived in
Altadena until her arrest, was "something I've thought about every
day for the last 27 years." For the Opsahl family's sake but also for
Montague's, Harris', Bortin's and Olson's, we can only hope that such
remorse was true, however many decades delayed.</TE>

<LD>Re "A Loud 'Yes' on Health Care," editorial, Nov. 11: The Times asks
rhetorically, "Do ordinary people want action on the health-care
problems that politicians love to ignore?" You bet we do. But not by
taxing citizens. Rather, the action we want is stopping the
ever-rising "swelling immigrant population" mentioned later in the
editorial that is causing the state's health-care meltdown. Too bad
California's massive congressional delegation loves to ignore the
problems caused by mass immigration. As a result we face a
health-care crisis with no end in sight.</LD>

<TE>   Guess when this was written: "In the U.S. we have had a long
experience with sickness insurance both on a nonprofit and commercial
basis. Both forms have been inadequate with respect to the protection
they furnish, and the latter -- commercial insurance -- has in
addition been too expensive for people of small means."</TE>
<TE>   It has been said that Americans will try everything wrong before
they try the right thing. That's the story of health care:
incremental change with no reform, Band-Aids without a cure,
attending to only those problems that require the least political
cost and a fundamentalist faith in the marketplace.</TE>
<TE>   But health care doesn't respond to marketplace principles. How can
supply and demand, or competition between providers, determine the
cost of health care when government subsidizes 50% of it? Does anyone
truly shop around for the lowest-cost health care? Drugs and medical
technology that provide only a 5% improvement in health can be 100%
more expensive.</TE>
<TE>   We now spend more than $1.3 trillion on health care and yet, in a
recent comparison with 12 other Western countries, the quality of our
care ranked second to last. The number of Americans without health
insurance, now at 45 million, will continue to increase. More
Americans will have to choose between medication and paying for
groceries. And more will go without the health care they deserve --
until we eventually adopt a single-payer national system. Our present
market-driven nonsystem, as former editor of the New England Journal
of Medicine Dr. Arnold Relman has said, "has no incentive to support
a common social good."</TE>
<TE>   The quote above was written more than 65 years ago by the
committee that created Social Security -- and deliberately excluded
health insurance for all.</TE>

<LD>It appears that the head of the California Highway Patrol is shocked
-- shocked -- that cell phones are involved in a large proportion of
crashes ("Phones Blamed in More Crashes," Nov. 10). Gee, he oughta
get out more.</LD>
<LD>   And I would recommend that he get out on a bicycle around Los
Angeles so that he would be much more aware of cell phone drivers and
their dangerous habit. I'd also recommend that he read the studies
that show hands-free phones don't help. He should also be made aware
of the new text-messaging, picture phones and dashboard televisions
about to swamp the market.</LD>
<LD>   The camel is already in the tent, and hanging a pine-scented air
freshener around its neck isn't going to help.</LD>
<TE>   Dennis Crowley</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While cell phones may be to blame for some accidents, the solution
of mandating hands-free devices is misguided. The psychology
department at the University of Utah did a study on driver
performance and cell phone use. The researchers concluded that
hand-held and hands-free cell phones resulted in equivalent
"dual-task deficits" (driving and cell phone use). Use of either cell
phone type resulted in similar slow reaction times, such as the time
needed to depress the brake pedal in an emergency. Test subjects were
more likely to collide with a pace car while on the cell phone,
regardless of whether it was hands-free or not.</TE>
<TE>   If California is really interested in preventing collisions, the
state will have to ban all cell phone use.</TE>

<LD>Re "Vote for a Party, Then Have a Party," Opinion, Nov. 10: Jennifer
Price's contention that if election day were turned into a more
festive occasion, more people would come out to vote seems like
wishful thinking to me. It isn't because we're not having a good time
that those of us who dislike voting don't get over to the polls. It
has more to do with unresponsive politicians -- politicians who are
more interested in personal gain or career advancement than in
serving their constituencies; politicians who lie; politicians who
have no respect for taxpayers' money and spend it like it's an
endless ocean of water; and, worst of all, politicians who are
callous and irresponsible.</LD>
<LD>   Making voting an easier chore or turning it into an occasion for
partying will not rectify the problem. But leaders who have their
constituencies' best interests at heart, who really want to make it a
better world, will go a long way toward solving the voter turnout
problem. I mostly quit voting when I was in my mid-20s because of
Lyndon Johnson, who promised not to take us deeper into Vietnam and,
after he was elected president, turned around and did just the
opposite.</LD>
<TE>   I remember how that shocked and demoralized me. I felt as if I had
been badly misused by my president. After that experience, I soured
on politicians. In the years since, after observing the behavior of
countless elected officials, my sour feelings and opinions have
become even more deeply entrenched. It's too demoralizing to bother
voting for someone who does not engender trust and confidence.</TE>
<TE>   Sandra L. Lerner</TE>
<TE>   Canoga Park</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Price is right. We don't make a big enough deal about elections.
We should; it should be a sort of mock holiday, like the Super Bowl.
On Nov. 5, I voted in my first-ever election. And it was a great
feeling. I felt like I did my duty as an American. But I have a
better explanation as to why voter turnout was so low in California.
First, it was a midterm election. Second, look at the two candidates
we had running for governor! These are the two biggest geeks I have
ever seen. No wonder nobody wanted to vote.</TE>
<TE>   I remember at the beginning of the year I was looking forward to
voting for Richard Riordan; he has done far more for Los Angeles than
Gov. Gray Davis has for the state. Unfortunately, I didn't get a
chance to. Let's wait until 2006 and see whether Arnold
Schwarzenegger runs. I guarantee voter turnout will be higher; he's
already got my vote.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Fabrick</TE>
<TE>   La Crescenta</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Price has some great ideas and ideals but doesn't meet the reality
test. America will not take a day off to vote and then party.
Increasing turnout and participation is a critical need to create the
democratic society we aspire to. While I would love to have media
outlets such as The Times, the networks, cable news, cover all of the
opinions on an issue (not just Republican and Democrat but
Libertarian and Green too), this may be too optimistic, given the
economic rewards that the media have for keeping the status quo.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the next best way to entice voter turnout is for those who
wear the "I've voted, have you?" stickers to get an additional 10%
off at participating stores. Grocery and department stores have sales
for Veterans Day, Memorial Day, Mother's Day, -- so if they're always
going to be having a sale, why not reward those who have voted? It
increases business for the participating stores at no cost to
government while rewarding and celebrating what makes America great:
freedom and capitalism.</TE>
<TE>   Craig B. Coogan</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I wholeheartedly support a special day for elections -- maybe
Citizens' Day or Democracy Day -- but not calling it a holiday. It
should be made on a Wednesday so that some people would not be able
to make it a three- or four-day weekend and leave town or go fishing.</TE>

<LD>Re "High School Curriculum Should Be More Relevant," Voices, Nov. 9:
LAUSD Board President Caprice Young sounded off on the need to expand
school-to-career programs that will excite students about academics
and decrease the dropout rate. Specifically, she cites the multimedia
programs that have sprung up on some campuses. Ironically, her
remarks appeared on the same day that The Times gave voice to
numerous parents and teachers who are appalled at the burgeoning
class-size problem in our schools, a problem that has its roots in
the school board's twisted priorities.</LD>
<TE>   Our district added an average of two students into every room this
fall. Young needs to learn to put two and two together. When the
school board determined this year that yet more kids must be crammed
into each classroom, innovative programs such as those she claims to
support were hit like any other. As one of the teachers embracing the
"entrepreneurial movement for change" she lauds, I have brought over
$80,000 worth of computers, video equipment and graphic arts software
into my Reseda High classroom at virtually no cost to the district.
However, this semester the 23 freshman students entering our New
Media Academy can only look longingly at a wasted investment. The 10
additional students stuffed into the computer lab make it impossible
to teach our introductory digital arts course. Two dozen computers,
34 students. Do the math.</TE>

<LD>Thank you for "Beef Up the Biotreaty," your Nov. 12 editorial urging
Undersecretary of State for Arms Control John Bolton to work to
strengthen the biological weapons treaty rather than subvert it. The
U.S. must do all it can to ensure that all nations that have
biological agents be required to submit to international standards
for their use, storage and disposal. This is the only way to slow the
spread of dangerous biological and toxic weapons. As you point out,
new technologies are resulting in an alarming increase in the
bioweapons danger to Americans and to the rest of the world.</LD>

<HD>Pacheco's Friend Torres Took a Flier on Sleaze</HD>

<LD>After the ugly campaign that just finished, it's hard to believe that
the nastiness has already started for the 2003 City Council race
("Candidate Complains of Attacks in Mailers," Nov. 12). As a resident
of Eagle Rock, I voted for Nick Pacheco in the last election.
However, I am deeply disturbed by the offensive mailers that were
sent out against Antonio Villaraigosa.</LD>
<LD>   Pacheco's claim that he had nothing to do with the mailers just
doesn't seem to ring true. The offensive fliers were sent out by
Pacheco's law school buddy and supporter Ricardo Torres. When Pacheco
again denied any involvement with the mailers, he also noted that
"when you send out facts, it's tough to mount a legal challenge."
That is certainly a backhanded denial if I have ever seen one.
Political pundit Lanny Davis noted that whoever sent out the mailers
"can't take enough showers." Ricardo, please pass Nick the soap.</LD>

<TE>   Re "2nd Mailer Attacks Villaraigosa's Private Life," Nov. 11: Go

Villaraigosa will get my vote, and there's nothing you can do about
it.</TE>

<TE>   Shame on Torres for his flier, in which he attacked Villaraigosa
for having "white advisors" (Nov. 9). If he wants to go after
Villaraigosa, why not focus on issues, such as his support of
convicted dope dealer Carlos Vignali for a pardon? I offer no
apologies for being white. I voted for Pacheco. He evidently no
longer wants my vote, or he would not acquiesce to the denigration of
white people. Let's see whether Pacheco has the moral courage to
repudiate this racist flier and the man who created it.</TE>

<TE>   The Times has reported two incidents involving local electoral
politics that run counter to the prevailing trend of increased
tolerance and colorblindness in our community. A supporter of Pacheco
assailed Villaraigosa's candidacy for the 14th District City Council
seat, saying that Villaraigosa was betraying Latino constituents at
the urging of "white advisors" and "gringos." "Challengers File for
School Board Races" (Nov. 10) reported that school board member David
Tokofsky was being criticized by "some Latino political consultants"
because he "doesn't fit the profile" of his heavily Latino
constituency.</TE>
<TE>   While this kind of politics may serve a particular candidate's
short-term interest in animating his or her base by invoking group
pride and disdain for the "other," it ultimately hurts us all. At the
very time when polls and societal trends point to increasing
tolerance, this anachronistic appeal to bigotry simply cannot be
tolerated. Political, media and community leaders, whatever their
political stripe, must condemn these tactics in unambiguous terms.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "No to a Far-Right Court: Use Filibusters," by Erwin Chemerinsky
and Catherine Fisk, Commentary, Nov. 11:</LD>
<LD>   It is remarkable that less than a week after voters nationwide
repudiated the Democrats' lack of constructive political engagement
and affirmed their support for President Bush, Chemerinsky and Fisk
called for the Democratic Party to use filibusters to attack judicial
nominees whom they interchangeably characterize as "far right" or
"conservative." As "ample precedent" for this tactic, they offer all
of two examples of Republican filibusters during the last 34 years.</LD>
<LD>   As an attorney, I am constantly reminded of the consequences of
vacant judicial posts. The inability of some of Bush's nominees to
get out of the Senate Judiciary Committee has been a disgrace. That
Chemerinsky and Fisk would now encourage Democrats to renew that
confrontational approach in Senate filibusters is utterly
irresponsible. It will also further marginalize the Democratic Party.</LD>
<TE>   Arthur I. Willner</TE>
<TE>   Tarzana</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chemerinsky and Fisk's commentary might have mentioned that for
more than 50 years the country has expected and accepted that the
Constitution will be rewritten by "test cases" instead of
constitutional amendments.</TE>
<TE>   A judicial nominee's views on abortion wouldn't matter if the
Constitution plainly stated what Roe vs. Wade established, that a
woman has a right to privacy in the first trimester of her pregnancy.
Similarly, civil rights and women's rights would not depend on a
favorable interpretation of the 14th Amendment if the Constitution
plainly prohibited racial and gender discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   The country has ceded vital policymaking powers to the judicial
branch -- the unaccountable branch of government that the founders
excluded from policymaking.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate confirmation hearings are now the last opportunity for
the people of the United States, through their elected
representatives, to have any say at all in the making of law and
policy on issues that deeply concern them.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Shelley</TE>
<TE>   Sherman Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chemerinsky and Fisk's commentary stating that the Democrats must
filibuster Bush's judicial nominees misses the mark in one important
way. The American people voted for a right-wing House, a right-wing
Senate and a right-wing president. Why should the Democrats rescue
the American people because they decided to vote this way?</TE>
<TE>   The media have repeated consistent warnings since the George H.W.
Bush administration about the threatening specter of right-wing
judges. No one listened. The American people should suffer the
consequences of electing a president and a Congress with stunted
views of individual rights and civil liberties.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout history, our liberal courts have desegregated schools,
enhanced our rights to privacy (which we all cherish), enforced the
1st Amendment by eliminating forced prayer in public schools and
demanded that the states pass laws that comport with constitutional
minimums.</TE>
<TE>   We are too comfortable. We take our rights for granted. Perhaps if
we experience the reversal of Roe vs. Wade, the outlawing of the use
of contraceptives, the banning of "immoral" books and movies and the
bringing back of forced school prayer, then the American people will
be outraged enough to never vote again for the fringe right wing of
the Republican Party.</TE>
<TE>   Give the people what they voted for and let them face the
consequences of that vote.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey L. Hoffer</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If there was ever a time to utilize the senatorial filibuster on
judicial appointments, the next session of Congress is that time. The
current unelected president should not mistake the vote on Nov. 5 as
giving him carte blanche to swing the federal courts to the far
right. To the contrary, that vote was to support U.S. foreign policy,
period.</TE>
<TE>   It is time that the Democratic Party discovers its manhood and
delivers that message to George W. Bush and the Republicans, come
2003!</TE>
<TE>   Bob Teigan</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chemerinsky and Fisk state, "If outspoken liberals were
unacceptable judicial nominees during the Clinton administration,
then extreme conservatives are equally unsuitable now."</TE>
<TE>   Let's see if I've got it right. Their radicals are "outspoken,"
while the other guys' radicals are "extreme." Perhaps the reason
Chemerinsky was not nominated for that U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals judgeship was not the reason stated in the column but his
lack of fairness and intellectual integrity.</TE>

<LD>I read with amusement "Egyptian TV Fuels Hate," your Nov. 11
editorial regarding the Egyptian soap opera accused of anti-Semitism.
When one considers that the Hollywood machine has been spreading lies
and distorted images of Arabs (the other Semites) for over a century
now, it is rather ironic that you choose to be outraged by a small
Egyptian production loosely based on a work of fiction. Movies such
as "True Lies," "Delta Force" and even "Lawrence of Arabia," just to
name a few, come to mind. I do not recall your angry editorials then.
People who live in glass houses ought not to be throwing rocks.</LD>

<TE>   The Times is to be commended for bringing to public attention the
popular Egyptian TV series based on "The Protocols of the Elders of
Zion." This documentary, based on a lie, was made for the explicit
purpose of inciting anti-Israel, anti-Jewish emotions within the
Egyptian community during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The U.S.
strongly urged the Egyptian government to withdraw the series but was
rebuffed.</TE>
<TE>   How sad that an opportunity to educate its citizens for peace is,
instead, used by the Egyptian government to continue its negative
attitude toward Israel -- despite the fact that a peace treaty exists
between the two nations. How tragic that the next generation of
children is being inoculated with the poison of hatred that seems to
run rampant in the world, threatening not only today's children but
tomorrow's as well.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your editorial explicates one of the roots of the Arab-Israeli
discord. Ostensibly, both sides are caught in a vicious cycle of
fueling hatred upon each other, convincing each side that peace will
never be possible between them. What can be done to break this
vicious cycle? Your intimidating and arrogant editorial on the
Egyptians was not useful.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your willingness to expose the barrage of propaganda lies about
Jews in the Arab press may serve as a moderating influence and aid
the cause of peace in the Middie East. Many experts feel that the
anti-Semitic lies and distortions over the last few years in the Arab
press and Palestinian school textbooks have led to the climate of
hate that fuels the present conflict.</TE>

<LD>Re "Making a Nonviolent Act a Third Strike Is Just Plain Crazy," Nov.
10: Steve Lopez may be against the three-strikes law, but it will be
a long time before it is repealed or even modified. The reason:
craven politicians who fear losing reelection. No politician wants to
be called "soft on crime," and this includes even thinking about
whether the law could be improved, say, by counting only violent
crimes.</LD>
<LD>   The same goes for the death penalty. When alleged sniper Lee Boyd
Malvo, who was admittedly accused of some heinous crimes, was
arrested in Maryland, where they do not execute minors, Atty. Gen.
John Ashcroft facilitated his transfer to Virginia, where minors can
be executed. This was received with widespread satisfaction. Virginia
is a state that destroys DNA evidence after an execution lest it be
used to show that the accused was innocent after all. When did we
become so bloodthirsty?</LD>

<HD>Betrayal of Innocent Children and Priests</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm glad to see that the Catholic bishops are now emphasizing the
rights of innocent priests ("Bishops Change Tone on Abuse," Nov. 12).
If they had only been so concerned about the rights of innocent
children! But they were not. They were interested only in protecting
the reputation of the institution and of the priests who had
committed criminal acts.</LD>
<LD>   As a Catholic I am beginning to wonder what other crimes have been
kept secret to protect the reputation of priests, bishops and the
institutional church. If priests are "being unfairly judged by the
misdeeds of other priests," it may be because bishops have hidden
their crimes not only from the public but also from their brother
priests. They have betrayed the people they serve and the many
innocent priests they are now trying to protect.</LD>

<HD>Eddie Bracken, 87; Comedy Star in Film and on Broadway</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eddie Bracken, a mainstay of Paramount comedies and musicals in the
1940s and a favorite of director Preston Sturges, who cast him in the
madcap "The Miracle of Morgan's Creek" and "Hail the Conquering
Hero," has died. He was 87.</LD>
<LD>   Bracken died Thursday from complications of surgery in a hospital
in Montclair, N.J., according to his oldest daughter, Judy Gordon.
She said her father had crushed a disk in his neck in a fall in his
home in Glen Ridge, N.J.</LD>
<LD>   Connie, Bracken's wife of 62 years, died in August.</LD>
<TE>   "He missed her, but he loved life and was carrying on nicely,"
Gordon said. "He had a couple of movie offers and was being
interviewed for books. He was full of life and looking forward to
lots of things."</TE>
<TE>   Bracken brought that same sense of vitality to his film roles in
the '40s and early '50s, when he was often cast as the over-eager
bumbler with names like Basil "Dizzy" Evans, Norval Jones, Woodrow
Lafayette Pershing True- smith, Ogden Spencer Trulow III, Orville
Wingait and Frederick Winthrop Clopp.</TE>
<TE>   One critic at the time described the typical Bracken role as "the
long-suffering, plaintive type who muddles through difficult
situations, never knowing quite how he escapes with a whole skin."</TE>
<TE>   Among Bracken's 35 films are "Caught in the Draft" (1941), with
Bob Hope; "The Fleet's In" (1942), with Betty Hutton; "The Star
Spangled Rhythm" (1942), with Bing Crosby and Hutton; "The Girl from
Jones Beach" (1949), with Ronald Reagan; "Summer Stock" (1950), with
Judy Garland and Gene Kelly; and "We're Not Married" (1952), with
Mitzi Gaynor and Marilyn Monroe.</TE>
<TE>   "When I think of Eddie Bracken, I just want to smile," Ann Miller,
who co-starred with Bracken in the 1940 film "Too Many Girls" and
decades later on stage in "Sugar Babies " and "Follies," told a
reporter last May. On Friday, Miller said, "His kind of comedy would
be good today -- he never went out of style."</TE>
<TE>   Bracken achieved his greatest screen successes in "The Miracle of
Morgan's Creek" and "Hail the Conquering Hero." The films, both
released in 1944, established Bracken as both an actor and a
comedian.</TE>
<TE>   In the hilarious and racy-for-its-time "Miracle," he's cast
opposite Hutton, who drinks at an all-night party, gets pregnant and
can't remember the name of the father. Bracken is her faithful
boyfriend, who winds up marrying Hutton and becoming father to the
"miracle": sextuplets.</TE>
<TE>   In the satirical "Hail the Conquering Hero," he plays a small-town
military reject who unwillingly poses as a Marine war hero who is
caught up in a wave of hometown hero worship.</TE>
<TE>   Writer-director-producer John Hughes, who worked with Bracken on
three of his later films -- "National Lampoon's Vacation," "Home
Alone 2: Lost in New York" and "Baby's Day Out" -- describes
Bracken's '40s-vintage screen persona as "sweet and manic."</TE>
<TE>   "There was a real sort of boy-next-door quality to him," Hughes
told The Times Friday. "But he had this mania about him. The reason
we used him in 'Vacation' was that tongue-tied bit that he did, where
he's about to blow up and then he just stops.... 'What were you
saying?' He could turn that on a dime."</TE>
<TE>   Hughes first met Bracken on the set of "Vacation," the 1983 comedy
starring Chevy Chase, which marked a return to the big screen for
Bracken.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd see him arrive, and you'd think it was a poet laureate or
something; you didn't think it was this comic actor," Hughes
recalled. "He was a very dignified man and just so tremendously
skilled in that old style."</TE>
<TE>   Whenever he could, Hughes said, he would sit and chat with
Bracken, this "direct link" to Sturges and old-time Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd tell Preston Sturges stories, and I'd sit there and think,
'He was actually there. He was part of that whole thing.' "</TE>
<TE>   Born in Astoria, Queens, in 1915, Bracken was 4 or 5 when he began
a show that became an older brother to amateur contests at the
Astoria Grand Theater. Bracken would sing and dance and then take
home first prize.</TE>
<TE>   While in elementary school, he began appearing as the rich kid in
"The New York Kiddie Troupers," a series of silent movie shorts
filmed in New York.</TE>
<TE>   As a teenager, he toured the country in a show called "Lottery," a
parody of early melodramas. He received his big break in the
mid-1930s when director George Abbott cast him as the lead in the
national touring company of "Brother Rat," a comedy about life in a
Virginia military academy.</TE>
<TE>   Bracken went on to appear in Abbott's Broadway production of the
comedy "What a Life," the forerunner to the radio and film series
about teenager Henry Aldrich, whom Bracken played when the play went
on tour. By the end of the national tour, his leading lady, Constance
Nickerson, became his wife.</TE>
<TE>   In 1939, he was co-starring on Broadway in "Too Many Girls," a
Rodgers and Hart musical, when he caught the eye of Hollywood, which
brought him out to appear in the movie version.</TE>
<TE>   While Bracken was waiting, his daughter said, he was cast in the
comedy "Life with Henry," which starred Jackie Cooper as Henry
Aldrich and Bracken as his best friend, Dizzy.</TE>
<TE>   During his early days after being placed under contract at
Paramount, Bracken had to compete with Bob Hope for parts.</TE>
<TE>   "Which was ridiculous because we're nowhere near alike," he said
in an interview last May. "And then we did 'In the Draft' together,
and Louella Parsons said I stole the picture, so he refused to work
with me again."</TE>
<TE>   Bracken earned two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one for
his radio series, "The Eddie Bracken Show," and the other for his
work on television, including appearances on "The Dick Van Dyke
Show," "Rawhide" and "Murder She Wrote."</TE>
<TE>   Bracken, who returned to the New York stage in the 1950s, appeared
with Carol Channing in the late '70s touring revival of "Hello,
Dolly!" which also ran on Broadway and earned Bracken a Tony
nomination.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his daughter Judy, Bracken is survived by his four
other children, Carolyn, Michael, Susan and David; nine
grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   The family is planning a memorial service.</TE>

<HD>Orange County's Jobs Put Crowds on the 91</HD>
<DH>Survey studies Inland Empire commuter patterns. Only 17%
are headed to L.A. County.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Yi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly three-quarters of commuters who use the chronically congested
westbound lanes of the Riverside Freeway every morning are headed to
jobs in Orange County's northern, northwestern and central cities,
according to a report released Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The survey, the first comprehensive study of commuting patterns on
the only major corridor between the rapidly growing Inland Empire and
Orange County, found that more than 40% of the westbound traffic
ultimately ends up in cities such as Anaheim and Santa Ana.</LD>
<LD>   An additional 20% are workers going to jobs in northwestern towns
such as Huntington Beach and Westminster, and about 11% to northern
cities, including Fullerton and La Habra.</LD>
<TE>   The findings, presented at the Orange County Transportation
Authority's board meeting Friday, will have important implications
for solutions to the jampacked conditions on one of Southern
California's most congested freeways, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Motorists make about 250,000 daily trips on the Riverside Freeway.
That number is expected to rise to more than 400,000 by 2025.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are doing is trying to learn where they are going so we
come up with proposals that make more sense," OCTA spokesman George
Urch said.</TE>
<TE>   Urch said the survey -- a collaboration between the OCTA, the
Riverside Transportation Commission and the Southern California Assn.
of Governments -- confirmed officials' suspicion that the
destinations were concentrated in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Only 17% of Riverside County commuters on the 91 Freeway are
headed to L.A.; 10% are on their way to Orange County's southern
communities.</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of the drivers, 82%, traveled alone, and the greatest
number of them -- 44% -- came from the Corona and Norco areas, which
have experienced tremendous housing growth in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Another 24% came from the Riverside and Rubidoux areas.</TE>
<TE>   "They have the houses, we have the jobs," Urch said.</TE>
<TE>   The study was conducted by videotaping traffic on the freeway
between 4 and 10 a.m. during a two-day period in June. License plates
were matched with addresses, and surveys were sent to 53,876 homes.
About 7,300 drivers responded.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation officials in both counties are considering a number
of solutions to ease the traffic, including adding a parallel freeway
and building a 10-mile tunnel underneath the Cleveland National
Forest.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Urch said, the OCTA will move quickly to add
lanes to the freeway as soon as the agency buys the toll lanes owned
by the California Private Transportation Co.</TE>
<TE>   Only about a quarter of survey respondents said they used the toll
lanes, which can cost as much as $4.75 during peak hours.</TE>
<TE>   Under a clause between the company and the state, Caltrans was
prohibited from making improvements on the freeway. Urch said the
OCTA is expected to complete the $207-million purchase of the toll
lanes by early next year.</TE>

<HD>Doctors to Explain Hormone Therapy</HD>
<DH>The Oxnard symposium is designed to clear up confusion
generated by a study outlining risks to menopausal women who take
estrogen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Catherine Saillant</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many women are frightened by conflicting reports about the safety of
hormone therapy -- so much so that some are simply throwing away
their pills.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors across Ventura County say they see it every day.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't tell you how many messages have come across my desk: 'I
stopped taking my estrogen -- just wanted you to know,' " said
Ventura cardiologist Thomas Kong.</LD>
<TE>   To address the confusion, Community Memorial Hospital will hold a
women's health symposium at 1 p.m. today at the Tower Club in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   About 200 women are expected to attend. In fact, so many women
have registered that other workshops will likely be organized, said
Dr. Ronna Jurow, the panel's moderator.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of interest, because everyone is so confused," said
Jurow, a Ventura gynecologist who teaches a class in women's health
at USC.</TE>
<TE>   Three physicians on the panel will explain that hormone
replacement therapy can be a safe and effective way to treat
menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness, as long
as doctors follow some common-sense guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   The doctors are hoping to calm fears that hormone therapy is too
risky. That appears to be the overriding message women have received
from a much-publicized study that found a slightly increased risk of
heart disease, stroke and breast cancer in women who used a
combination of estrogen and progesterone.</TE>
<TE>   Findings in the Women's Health Initiative Study, released in July,
have been fiercely debated. Some experts say it is conclusive
evidence that hormone therapy should be prescribed only with extreme
caution while others argue that the risks have been overblown.</TE>
<TE>   In October, the North American Menopause Society recommended that
hormone therapy be limited to the shortest duration possible to
relieve menopausal symptoms but no longer be recommended for
prevention of heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   But the society's advisory committee could not reach consensus on
how long hormones should be prescribed for such problems as night
sweats, mood swings and vaginal atrophy.</TE>
<TE>   About 38% of post-menopausal women nationally were on hormone
replacement therapy at the time the study's findings were released.
That number is expected to multiply in coming years as female baby
boomers reach the end of their fertility.</TE>
<TE>   Those women need clear guidance, medical experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is: This is an individual choice," Jurow said.
"There are lower dosages, there are patches and there are creams. I
don't care what kind of estrogen a woman takes as long as it's
estrogen."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Martha Gonzalez, a Ventura endocrinologist, said she, too,
believes hormone therapy has real benefits for post-menopausal women.
By consulting closely with their doctor, most women can safely take
hormones, she said. "I tell my patients I'm going to take estrogen
until I die," said Gonzalez, 49. "I want my bones, I want my heart
and I want my brain. I want to be able to have sex. I don't want to
have depression or saggy skin. If I get breast cancer, I will get
newer and bigger breasts."</TE>

<LD>A San Fernando Valley father of an alleged rape victim tracked down
his teenage daughter's attacker and shot him three times, police said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Martin Hernandez, 39, was arrested on suspicion of attempted
murder and was being held in lieu of $500,000 bail at LAPD Foothill
Division jail.</LD>
<LD>   Police said Hernandez overheard his 17-year-old daughter tell her
brother and her boyfriend that she had been sexually assaulted
Thursday night by family friend Jose Argueta, 25.</LD>
<TE>   Argueta had offered the teen a ride, then drove her to Sepulveda
Recreation Park where he assaulted her, police said. Afterward,
Argueta drove her home.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez later tracked Argueta to Pacifica Hospital of the Valley
in Sun Valley, where he shot him with a .25-caliber handgun, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   Argueta, 25, was arrested on suspicion of rape and was being
treated for minor gunshot wounds to his torso in the jail ward at
County-USC Medical Center in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   He's being held in lieu of $50,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a double tragedy," said LAPD Robbery Homicide Det. Jesse
Alvarado.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got to deal with his daughter who was assaulted, and he's
probably going to jail and won't be around to take care of his kids,"
the detective said of Hernandez.</TE>

<HD>Claim Filed in Shooting</HD>
<DH>Girl, 14, wounded by Ventura officer pursues legal action
against the city and county.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Chawkins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Attorneys for a 14-year-old girl shot by a Ventura police officer who
ordered her to drop a kitchen knife have filed a civil claim against
both the city and Ventura County.</LD>
<LD>   The claim, which is the first step toward a lawsuit, contends that
the shooting by Officer Kristin Rupp was "without justification or
excuse." It also accuses the county of failing to properly train the
girl's foster family and failing to provide adequate treatment for
her injuries.</LD>
<LD>   Rupp, 23, has been cleared of wrongdoing by a departmental
investigation. The girl, a Chinese immigrant who had been in this
country for just two years, awaits trial Dec. 16 on a charge of
assaulting an officer with a deadly weapon.</LD>
<TE>   According to police, the girl was threatening to kill herself when
her foster parents called police to their Ventura home May 5. Instead
of dropping the knife when ordered, she advanced toward Rupp,
prosecutors have said. The girl was shot three times.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Chinese American community in Los Angeles and in
Ventura County are following the case closely, said Dr. George Yu, an
Oxnard physician who is active in a number of Chinese organizations.</TE>
<TE>   "We're calling for the dismissal of criminal charges" against the
girl, he said. "The district attorney is just trying to cover up a
mistake by a rookie officer."</TE>
<TE>   The girl was raised by her grandmother in China and immigrated to
join her father, who ran a Newbury Park restaurant. She was placed in
foster care after she and her father fought over a boyfriend.</TE>
<TE>   "She was mentally distraught," Yu said. "What she needed was
help."</TE>

<HD>Billy Guy, 66; Baritone Was an Original Member of the
Coasters</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Billy Guy, an original member of the Coasters, the Los
Angeles-originated rhythm and blues-based comedy quartet that
recorded "Charlie Brown," "Yakety Yak" and other hits of the 1950s
and early '60s, has died. He was 66.</LD>
<LD>   Guy, a baritone who memorably sang the lead on the group's 1957
hit "Searchin' " and was one of the quartet's main comic voices, died
of cardiovascular disease Tuesday in his Las Vegas apartment.</LD>
<LD>   Considered by some the preeminent vocal group of the early days of
rock 'n' roll, the Coasters were formed in 1955 and produced by the
legendary songwriting team of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller.</LD>
<TE>   Debuting with "Down in Mexico" in 1956, the Coasters recorded a
string of Leiber and Stoller hits that, in addition to "Charlie
Brown" and "Yakety Yak," included "Along Came Jones," "Poison Ivy,"
"I'm a Hog for You," "Young Blood" and "Little Egypt."</TE>
<TE>   The Coasters, Times pop music critic Robert Hilburn wrote a few
years ago, "made some of the most entertaining and imaginative
records of the '50s -- marvelously funny and often satirical looks at
the world, mostly framed through a restless teen perspective."</TE>
<TE>   In 1987, the Coasters were voted into the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame.</TE>
<TE>   "Billy was one of the main clowns in the group, a very bright guy,
very talented," Stoller told The Times Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Stoller said he and Leiber "looked upon the Coasters as our own
voice. We wrote the songs for them, and we shared a sense of humor."</TE>
<TE>   Leiber would sometimes sing a line of a new song for Guy, "and
Billy would take it from there with the same sense of humor, the same
delivery, only better," Stoller said.</TE>
<TE>   The Coasters would perform in theaters, Stoller recalled, "then
they'd come back and show us how they performed [the songs] on stage,
and we'd fall on the floor. Then we'd start teaching them the new
songs, and they'd fall on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the most fun of any of the artists we worked with."</TE>
<TE>   The feeling was mutual from Guy's standpoint. "We had more fun
than any group," he told the Milwaukee Journal in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Itasca, Texas, in 1936, Guy was singing in a duo called
Bip and Bop when he was recruited to become a member of the Coasters,
whose name referred to the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   The Coasters evolved out of the Los Angeles-based R&amp;B group the
Robins. The group signed with Leiber and Stoller's Spark record label
in 1954 and scored West Coast hits with the songwriting team's "Riot
in Cell Block 9," "Framed" and "Smokey Joe's Cafe."</TE>
<TE>   After Leiber and Stoller became independent producers for Atlantic
Records, they tried to bring the Robins with them, but part of the
group decided to stay with their manager.</TE>
<TE>   Two Robins -- lead singer Carl Gardner and bass singer Bobby Nunn
-- stuck with Leiber and Stoller and, teaming with Guy and tenor Leon
Hughes, formed the Coasters.</TE>
<TE>   The group, however, underwent various personnel changes over the
next few years.</TE>
<TE>   Nunn was soon replaced by Will "Dub" Jones and Hughes was replaced
by Young Jessie, who was replaced by Cornell Gunther, who in turn was
replaced by Earl "Speedo" Carroll.</TE>
<TE>   Stoller recalled that one of the key sounds in the Coasters for
quite a few records, including "Yakety Yak" and "Charlie Brown," was
a harmony duet by Gardner and Guy.</TE>
<TE>   But on "Searchin'," Stoller said, "that was Billy all the way on
the lead. And also on 'Along Came Jones,' the little part in the
middle was Billy, who went, 'eh, eh, along came Jones....' And he
also was the lead on 'Little Egypt.' "</TE>
<TE>   Stoller likened the Coasters to a vaudeville group or a commedia
dell'arte troupe.</TE>
<TE>   "They each played a different role," he said. "Billy frequently
played kind of the country bumpkin, like on 'Little Egypt,' where
he's the rube who walks into the tent show, and on 'Searchin'' also.
Carl was more like the straight man and, of course, the bass singers
were always the father figure or the heavy. When Cornell was in the
group, he'd do the female role if there was one.</TE>
<TE>   "They all played a role, but Billy was definitely a master of
comic timing."</TE>
<TE>   In his later years, Guy led a group that billed itself as the
Coasters -- as did Gardner and, at various times, many other former
members -- thus provoking a series of legal disputes over who owned
the rights to the group's name.</TE>
<TE>   Guy reunited with other former Coasters members about a dozen
years ago to perform at a party hosted by the American Society of
Composers, Authors and Publishers in honor of Leiber and Stoller's
long collaboration.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the last time I think I saw him face to face," Stoller
said, "and he was just as wonderful as ever."</TE>
<TE>   Guy is survived by his companion, Vanessa Van Klyde; a sister; a
brother; a son; and a daughter.</TE>

<HD>Roland Hanna, 70; Jazz Pianist, Composer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roland Hanna, a classically trained jazz pianist and composer known
for his inventiveness at the keyboard and his thorough understanding
of the roots of jazz and other styles of music, has died. He was 70.</LD>
<LD>   Hanna died Wednesday in a hospital in Hackensack, N.J., as a
result of a viral infection of the heart. He became ill several weeks
ago while on tour with his trio in Japan, said his agent-manager,
Abby Hoffer.</LD>
<LD>   Billed as Sir Roland Hanna since being knighted in 1970 by the
government of Liberia in recognition of benefit concerts he had
performed in the African nation, the Detroit native worked briefly
with Benny Goodman, Charles Mingus and Sarah Vaughan in the late
1950s, while also leading his own small groups in New York City.</LD>
<TE>   In 1967, he joined the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Orchestra, which
played regularly at the Village Vanguard, and continued as a regular
until 1974. In 1965, he also became a member of the New York Jazz
Sextet, which played about 20 concerts a year. By the early 1970s,
the group became the New York Jazz Quartet which, in 1975, became
known as Sir Roland Hanna's New York Jazz Quartet.</TE>
<TE>   Hanna, jazz critic Don Heckman wrote in The Times in 1997, "is a
far-too-little-recognized jazz great.... He comes from a generation
of pianists who prided themselves on the ability to play
hard-swinging bebop as well as rhapsodic ballads."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, Hanna melded his love of classical music and jazz by
forming a trio of cello (he had learned to play the instrument in
high school), flute and French horn. The trio appeared before jazz
and chamber audiences, performing Hanna's original music, which, he
quipped, included "everything from Bach to Hanna, from 1685 to 1988."</TE>
<TE>   It's essential, Hanna said in a 1988 Times interview, "that we try
to pull people that play classical music into the area of what we
call jazz -- make them see that it's one music."</TE>
<TE>   Hanna, who recorded more than 30 albums, questioned why he should
be expected to prefer one type of music over the other.</TE>
<TE>   "For the average person, music is separated into categories, but
not for me," he told The Times. "To me, music is food, and I don't
have to say, 'These are apples and these are pears.' I can say, 'This
is music, and it tastes good,' or vice versa. Others have to know
what they're eating."</TE>
<TE>   For Hanna, it broke down this way: "Classical music has always
been a driving force for me, but jazz is my natural music. It's the
music of my people; it's the music of my soul."</TE>
<TE>   Hanna used his flair for jazz improvisation as a launching pad for
composing. "Improvising is a way of getting the adrenaline flowing,
to make sure there are new and fresh ideas to be written down," he
told The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Although he was a serious composer and adept at playing cello,
Hanna considered playing piano his strongest suit. "I try to bring to
the performance a kind of spiritual dignity that I hope comes
across," he said. "Whether I'm playing the blues or a Rachmaninoff
concerto, I want people to see that music is not just entertainment,
but it's a self-contained entity that's to uplift all of us, one way
or another. It's given to help people through this very difficult
life."</TE>
<TE>   Hanna's father taught him to play piano early. By age 11, he was
studying classical piano, and while in high school, he met future
jazz great Tommy Flanagan, who became a major influence. "He sort of
made it seem like I could do it too, so I jumped in," Hanna told The
Times in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   After serving in the Army in the early 1950s, Hanna studied first
at the Eastman School of Music and then at the Juilliard School of
Music, where he graduated in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   In the late '80s and early '90s, Hanna worked with the Lincoln
Center Jazz Orchestra and the Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra.
He also toured as a solo pianist with the Smithsonian's traveling
Duke Ellington exhibition in 1999. Although Hanna continued to play
in jazz clubs and at festivals, he primarily earned his living
teaching. He taught music at the Manhattan School of Music, the New
School and Queens College, regularly taking time out to tour.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife of 48 years, Ramona; four children; six
grandchildren; two sisters; and three brothers.</TE>

<HD>Felon Gets 25 to Life in $12 Theft</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Holly J. Wolcott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ventura County career criminal has been sentenced to 25 years to
life in prison for stealing $12 worth of sundries from a Santa
Barbara County grocery store.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Barbara Superior Court Judge Frank Ochoa imposed the
sentence Thursday on Ronald Steven Herrera, 57.</LD>
<LD>   Herrera was found guilty last month of commercial burglary and
felony petty theft for stealing lip balm, breath spray and a bottle
of wine from a Carpinteria Vons store. The burglary was Herrera's
third felony conviction under the state's three-strikes law, an
initiative approved by voters eight years ago that mandates a life
term for a third felony if the first two were serious or violent.
Herrera's attorneys have said they plan to appeal.</LD>
<TE>   "He may have taken approximately $12 worth of items, but the fact
remains he is a violent serious offender who cannot function in
society," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Darryl Perlin. "He is the kind of
person the voters and Legislature don't want out on the street."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the three-strikes law -- the nation's harshest measure
for repeat offenders -- was challenged before the U.S. Supreme Court
under the principle that the penalty is unconstitutional because it
constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. A ruling is due in several
months.</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa denied a defense motion that the defendant's 17 prior felony
convictions not be taken into account during sentencing, Perlin said.</TE>
<TE>   "Judge Ochoa then indicated that he felt, based on his two decades
of service on the bench, that Ronald Herrera is as bad as he has
seen. 'Horrific' is the word he used," Perlin said.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Public Defender Jeff Chambliss, who was not available for
comment Friday, argued at trial that his client has a brain defect
that prevents him from remembering things, including whether he had
paid for the items at the store.</TE>

<HD>'He Bashed My Head In,' Woman Says of Ex-Spouse</HD>
<DH>The Newbury Park accountant who was beaten in her home in
1999 testifies in civil trial. Lawyer for her ex-husband says there
is no evidence against him.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Newbury Park accountant who was beaten in her home three years ago
identified her ex-husband in court Friday as the attacker who
bludgeoned her with a flashlight, leaving her brain-damaged and
partially paralyzed.</LD>
<LD>   Cradling her limp left arm as she sat before jurors in a
wheelchair, Linda Morrisset described her bitter divorce from
businessman Lee Mannheimer and testified that he tried to kill her
during a dispute over custody of their young son.</LD>
<LD>   "He bashed my head in," Morrisset said.</LD>
<TE>   She described him as a hostile and controlling bully who had
frightened her during their nine-year marriage.</TE>
<TE>   "He lost his temper a lot; he was always yelling. I was afraid of
him," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Morrisset's testimony launched what is expected to be an emotional
four-week civil trial in Ventura County Superior Court. She sued
Mannheimer two years ago for assault, battery and intentional
infliction of emotional distress.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit was filed after prosecutors declined to charge
Mannheimer in connection with the near-fatal Sept. 11, 1999, attack
on Morrisset in the hallway of her former home in the Santa Rosa
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   She was found lying in a pool of blood the next morning by a
family housekeeper.</TE>
<TE>   Morrisset, 51, identified Mannheimer, 59, as her attacker after
she awakened from a 16-day coma. Authorities arrested the Westlake
Village businessman on suspicion of attempted murder.</TE>
<TE>   But he was released after prosecutors decided there was not enough
evidence to file criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said the biggest stumbling block was Morrisset's
inability to fully recall the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer was arrested in the assault partly because he had been
the focus of a federal murder-for-hire investigation involving his
wife in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   He was never arrested in the murder-for-hire case, however, and
Superior Court Judge Henry Walsh has limited how much jurors in this
trial will hear about it.</TE>
<TE>   Although the 1999 assault case remains unsolved, Morrisset said
she is certain her former spouse did it.</TE>
<TE>   During opening statements, attorney Allen Ball said that evidence
will show Mannheimer wanted his ex-wife dead and entered her home in
the fall of 1999 to accomplish his goal.</TE>
<TE>   There had been a mix-up that night over where the couple's
9-year-old son would sleep, and Mannheimer became enraged, the lawyer
said.</TE>
<TE>   "They found Linda unconscious on the floor, beaten so badly and so
repeatedly that her brains were escaping from her skull," Ball said.</TE>
<TE>   He told jurors that blows from the flashlight were so severe they
crushed his client's skull and left dents in the wooden floor.</TE>
<TE>   "The evidence will show that that man did it," he said, pointing
to Mannheimer seated in the courtroom. "He did it out of rage, and he
did it out of emotion."</TE>
<TE>   In his opening statement, Mannheimer's attorney, Greg Ramirez,
said that there is no evidence linking his client to the assault.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors will hear testimony from a German au pair who says he was
home with Mannheimer and the 9-year-old boy the night of the assault,
Ramirez said.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence will further show that Morrisset gave four or five
conflicting statements to investigators after emerging from her coma,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   She has a motive to implicate her former spouse, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Mrs. Morrisset admits that she hates Mr. Mannheimer," Ramirez
said. "And she hated him before Sept. 11, 1999."</TE>
<TE>   Lastly, Ramirez said his client is too squeamish to commit such a
bloody attack.</TE>
<TE>   "Lee Mannheimer is a coward," Ramirez said. "He is not the type of
man who would carry out this type of vicious assault."</TE>
<TE>   Morrisset's current husband, Richard Morrisset, 49, is also suing
Mannheimer for the losses he suffered after his wife was confined to
a wheelchair.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez suggested that Richard Morrisset is seeking money -- an
accusation the man denied Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer also testified briefly late Friday, denying that he was
involved in a 1993 murder-for-hire plot. His testimony will resume
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Ramirez said the case is an extension of the
couple's acrimonious divorce, for which Morrisset filed in 1993. He
said that she is seeking more than $1 million in damages.</TE>
<TE>   The current suit is one of several filed by the divorced couple
after the 1999 attack. Mannheimer sued his former wife for slander
after she accused him of trying to kill her.</TE>
<TE>   Those claims were dropped before trial last week.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer also filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the
Ventura County Sheriff's Department five months after his arrest in
September 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to false arrest claims, Mannheimer alleged detectives
had maliciously launched a child-welfare investigation that resulted
in his son being removed from his custody for more than three months.</TE>
<TE>   The federal case was settled earlier this year after the county
agreed to pay him $125,000.</TE>

<HD>OCTA Hires Expert to Help Fix Flaws in Freeway Bridge</HD>
<DH>Project oversight will be reviewed after concrete is found
breaking from the 55/405 carpool ramp.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Weikel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Grappling with flaws found in a $12-million freeway bridge, the
Orange County Transportation Authority decided Friday to review its
oversight procedures for construction projects and hire an outside
expert to help repair the damaged span.</LD>
<LD>   The OCTA board of directors agreed unanimously to spend up to
$100,000 for the services of Freider Seible, a highly regarded bridge
expert and dean of UC San Diego's engineering department.</LD>
<LD>   Seible has been helping the agency and Caltrans assess the damage
to the carpool connector at the interchange of the San Diego and
Costa Mesa freeways, one of the busiest in the country. OCTA
officials now want him to help find a solution.</LD>
<TE>   The towering flyover is part of a $125-million project to improve
the interchange. The ramp was scheduled to open in April, but repairs
could postpone that until the end of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Work was stopped in August after construction crews found that
concrete had cracked and fallen off large sections of the sides on
the elevated roadway. Although the bridge is in no danger of
collapsing, its ability to carry heavy loads over many years has been
compromised.</TE>
<TE>   Board members said an outside expert is needed, given the number
of agencies and private contractors involved in the project. OCTA is
paying for the work. Caltrans is administering the project and
providing oversight as well as design criteria.</TE>
<TE>   CH2M Hill, an international engineering firm, designed the bridge.
The prime contractor is C.C. Myers Inc., a construction company based
in Rancho Cordova, near Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to get solutions and avoid finger-pointing," said Arthur
Leahy, OCTA's chief executive officer. "That is hard to do sometimes
with different perspectives, competing interests and substantial
costs. We need to protect the taxpayers' interest."</TE>
<TE>   The OCTA board also agreed to work closely with Caltrans to find a
solution and assess whether the authority's oversight procedures are
sufficient.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA had hired a private engineering firm to monitor the
construction and progress of the interchange project, including the
two-way carpool connector.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer, OCTA board chairman, said he was
concerned that he and his colleagues were not regularly or fully
informed about work on the bridge.</TE>
<TE>   With better information, he said, the construction defects might
have been avoided.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer cited a Caltrans memo showing that C.C. Myers told the
transportation department about potential reinforcement problems in
June 2001, more than a year before the defects were discovered.</TE>
<TE>   Records show that a Caltrans engineer, the designer and the
contractor discussed the concerns and apparently concluded that no
further reinforcements were necessary under Caltrans' design
guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   Board members, however, said they did not learn about the memo
until this month -- 16 months after the concerns were raised with
Caltrans and two months after the defects were found.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to do a reassessment of our procedures and how we get
information," said Tim Keenan, vice chairman of the OCTA board. "We
need to see if we can be better and more informed."</TE>
<TE>   Under Friday's measure, board members and the news media will
receive regular updates on the bridge repair effort.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) said he has asked
Caltrans for records related to the carpool connector. He plans to
convene a Senate Transportation Committee hearing in Orange County to
determine what happened.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn, a committee member, said he also wants to make sure that
Caltrans recovers the costs of repairs from the designer and
contractor if the companies are held responsible for the defects.</TE>

<HD>UFW Pensions Catch Many by Surprise</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Fred Alvarez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the card arrived alerting Perfecto Becerra that he might be
eligible for a United Farm Workers pension, he said it was "like
money from the sky."</LD>
<LD>   The retired Oxnard vegetable picker was a strong union supporter,
attending conventions and marching with Cesar Chavez over more than
two decades with the UFW. But he didn't realize when he left the
fields that he could draw a monthly check merely by contacting the
UFW upon retirement.</LD>
<LD>   Now he does. The 68-year-old laborer received a lump sum,
retroactive payment of nearly $11,000 on Friday at the UFW's Oxnard
office -- nearly the equivalent of a year's pay for the average farm
worker.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, he will receive $249 a month for the rest of his life
from the pension plan, a hallmark of the benefits won for farm
workers in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent all of these years not knowing this money was available,"
said Becerra, who accepted an oversized check during a ceremony
attended by union members. "I think there are a lot people like me
who don't know they are owed this money."</TE>
<TE>   Workers such as Becerra are the focus of an ongoing UFW campaign
to reach thousands of aging farm workers who could be owed millions
in pension funds under the retirement program established by Chavez,
the union's founder.</TE>
<TE>   Growers pay anywhere from 5 cents to $1 per hour worked into the
plan. The fund, which is the country's first and only pension program
for farm workers, is valued at nearly $100 million and has 10,000
members.</TE>
<TE>   But UFW officials estimate there may be as many as 2,000 retired
workers who are eligible for benefits but don't know they have money
coming.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, a $48,000 check was presented to a Salinas-area
farm worker who didn't realize he qualified for a UFW pension. And
earlier this year, the union handed a $73,748 check -- its biggest
retroactive benefit ever -- to a retired farm worker in the same
area.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal is to contact them, or have them contact us, and get them
their pension benefits," said Douglas Blaylock, the fund's
administrator.</TE>
<TE>   Becerra worked for an Oxnard harvester for nearly 20 years and
should have started drawing from the pension fund three years ago, at
age 65.</TE>
<TE>   The retired worker said he was going to spend the fruits of his
labor on home repairs and providing for his two grandchildren and one
on the way.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very nice this happened," he said.</TE>

<HD>Offer Withdrawn; Historic Chinese Church Still for Sale</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>K. Connie Kang</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Korean congregation that offered $1.1 million to buy a historic
Chinese church in Lincoln Heights has withdrawn its offer after
opposition to the sale became public.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't want to be in the position of forcing out the
congregation that is worshiping there," said the Rev. Woo-Jung Kim,
pastor of Dong Kwang Presbyterian Church in South Los Angeles,
referring to the Cantonese-speaking group that currently uses the
church. "It doesn't seem like the right to thing to do among
Christians."</LD>
<LD>   Kim said he and his congregation had been unaware of the
controversy surrounding the sale of the old True Light Chinese
Presbyterian Church building by the Presbytery of San Gabriel until a
Times story earlier this month.</LD>
<TE>   The Rev. Thomas G. Rennard, top regional administrator for the San
Gabriel presbytery, confirmed that the sale had fallen through and
that the property on Griffin Avenue is back on the market. The
presbytery governs 45 congregations of the Presbyterian Church USA in
northeastern Los Angeles, the San Gabriel Valley and surrounding
areas.</TE>
<TE>   Rennard said, however, that a new offer, which presbytery
officials will review, came in Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Before the presbytery agreed to sell the property to Dong Kwang,
two other congregations had submitted bids: a Buddhist congregation
in the neighborhood and Young Nak Presbyterian Church of Los Angeles,
the largest Korean church in the United States, according to church
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Irvin Lai, a leader of the Lincoln Heights Neighborhood Ministry,
which ministers to mostly poor Cantonese-speaking immigrants, opposes
the sale of the church, whose roots go back 126 years in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Michael Mata, professor of urban ministry at the
Claremont School of Theology, who is familiar with the controversy,
suggested that the Cantonese community might be able to come up with
the money to buy the building or to pay for existing programs there
and expand them to reach out to Latino immigrants who now are the
majority in the neighborhood.</TE>

<HD>Sisters Still Standing Up; Speaking Out</HD>
<DH>The Sisters of  Social  Service, celebrating their 75-year
jubilee, follow the activist vision of their founder to fight poverty
and injustice.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>On a bright afternoon earlier this week, two Roman Catholic sisters
sat on the stoop of their assisted-living quarters near downtown Los
Angeles with spirits as bold as the day they entered religious life
-- one of them more than half a century ago.</LD>
<LD>   As Sister Virginia Fabilli, 84, held a poster protesting the
possibility of war in Iraq, Sister Christa Salinas, 62, rang a bell
as passersby honked and waved.</LD>
<LD>   When a Vietnam veteran stopped to show them his battle scar and
voice opposition to war, Salinas clanged her bell noisily and yelled,
"You're right! No war! God bless you!"</LD>
<TE>   In other parts of Los Angeles, their fellow Sister Diane Donoghue
is pressing for more low-income housing. Sister Maribeth Larkin is
organizing neighborhoods of mostly poor immigrants to speak up for
their rights. Sister Theresa Marie Chen is arguing on behalf of her
mentally ill clients in jails, courts and federal bureaucracies.</TE>
<TE>   In Sacramento, Sister Simone Campbell is directing the first
political lobbying organization ever established by a group of
California women religious: Jericho, an interfaith coalition that
advocates for the needs of the poor in housing, health care and other
fields.</TE>
<TE>   More than 75 years after establishing themselves in Los Angeles,
the good Sisters of Social Service are still raising Cain.</TE>
<TE>   Today , the sisters will mark the end of their yearlong 75th
jubilee celebration with a Mass of Thanksgiving at Our Lady of Grace
Church in Encino. A reception will follow at the nearby Holy Spirit
Retreat Center, which the sisters operate as a place of spiritual
repose that welcomes 12,000 people a year of all faith backgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   Their social and political activism distinguishes the sisters from
many of the 125 institutes representing 1,800 women religious in the
Los Angeles Archdiocese. But it reflects the bold, reformist vision
of their founder, Sister Margaret Slachta, the first woman elected to
the Hungarian Parliament.</TE>
<TE>   In 1923, Slachta and a few others split from another religious
group and formally established the Sisters of Social Service. At a
time when most women religious were cloistered behind convent walls
or clustered in hospitals or schools, Slachta's desire to walk the
streets to care for the alienated and poor represented a radical
notion -- one that has remained the community's driving mission.</TE>
<TE>   "When we see a problem, for better or worse, we tend to jump on it
and do something about it," said Sister Deborah Lorentz, 62, a
licensed acupuncturist who aims to offer effective but more
cost-efficient Eastern medical therapies to the poor. "We tend to
attract people willing to stand up and speak out."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the sisters pressed for reforms in prison
conditions, labor practices and what they saw as other social
injustices. During World War II, according to a written history of
the group, the sisters sheltered thousands of Jews from the Nazis by
dressing them in religious clothing and helping them cross the
Hungarian border with Vatican credentials. One of their members,
Sister Sara, was killed by the Nazis.</TE>
<TE>   In 1926, Sister Frederica Horvath traveled to Los Angeles to
establish the U.S. branch of the organization, which now counts 100
members in the United States, the Philippines, Mexico and Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   "They are right in the forefront of doing the social work of the
church," Sister M. Faith Clarke, archdiocesan vicar for women
religious, said of the sisters. "From the very beginning, they've
mingled right with the people."</TE>
<TE>   Maria Rivas, 42, is one of countless numbers of people touched by
the sisters' work. On a crisp morning this week, the Mexican
immigrant picked up two bags of groceries at the Regis House, a
community center run by the sisters near UCLA. With that gift of
food, three generations of her family -- including daughter Nancy,
20, and her 4-month-old granddaughter Thaily -- will be able to eat
for the next week. Rivas, a naturalized U.S. citizen, said she has
been looking for work for months to no avail; her husband, who is in
Mexico awaiting documents to immigrate, sends money only
intermittently, usually $20 or $50 at a time.</TE>
<TE>   "The sisters here are very, very good," Rivas said. "I see them
give socks and pants to homeless men and boiled eggs to people on the
streets."</TE>
<TE>   The stories of the sisters are as varied as the people they serve.
Chen, for instance, is a native of Taiwan whose decision to enter the
religious life was prompted by a powerful spiritual moment: Reading
the Gospel of John one day, in which Jesus tells Peter to feed his
sheep and follow him, Chen said she burst into uncontrollable tears
and felt God calling her into service. A mental health specialist,
Chen helps her patients, who suffer maladies ranging from
schizophrenia to bipolar disorder, with what she calls "life
management."</TE>
<TE>   One moment, Chen said, she'll be calming a patient suffering from
delusions; another moment she might be at the Social Security
Administration trying to unravel the red tape regarding a missing
payment.</TE>
<TE>   Others say their call to service developed more gradually. Sister
Marie Lindemann, for instance, said she was drawn in step by step:
first working as a counselor at one of the group's summer camps, then
as an "affiliate" who experienced living with them for six months and
finally becoming a novice in 1996, taking courses with other sisters
in subjects ranging from liturgy to scripture to the group's
Benedictine spirituality.</TE>
<TE>   A youth minister at St. Columbkille and Church of the Nativity in
Los Angeles, Lindemann said she was attracted by the group's
independent, pioneering spirit and balance of "play and pray." She
expects to take her final vows next June. "It's a miracle of God,"
said Lindemann, "that I am a Sister of Social Service."</TE>
<TE>   For others, such as Sister Rochelle Mitchell of the Holy Spirit
Retreat Center, the deep prayer life coupled with the group's social
activism proved a powerful draw. A native of Ventura and daughter of
a probation officer, Mitchell said she had always experienced sisters
as people who were "pretty much in convents and only came out to
teach."</TE>
<TE>   But the Sisters of Social Service did not wear habits. From their
founding, well before the liberal reforms of the Second Vatican
Council in the 1960s, the sisters wore simple gray dresses to blend
in with the people they served. They also projected what Mitchell
called a "freedom of spirit" -- whether working all night on skid row
or getting down and dirty in the softball diamond with children
during their summer camps.</TE>
<TE>   When she entered the group at age 18 in 1959, Mitchell said she
was not sure religious life would be a lifelong vocation. Her parents
were not wildly enthusiastic, she said, perhaps fearful that the
decision not to marry and raise her own family would destine her to a
lonely old age. As it turned out, Mitchell said, she never wavered in
her decision, and ultimately her parents were won over. At her 25th
anniversary celebration with the sisters in 1987, she said her mother
turned to her and said: "I can see you are very loved."</TE>
<TE>   The question of marriage and children was one that bedeviled women
such as Fabilli. The daughter of Italian immigrants, Fabilli said she
had always imagined herself with a family of her own before entering
the group in 1950. Those dreams have long been replaced by a broader
purpose -- from working for desegregation in the 1950s to a
still-passionate political advocacy expressed through reams of
letters to elected officials on everything from the danger of land
mines to human rights in Guatemala and what she regards as obscene
levels of U.S. military spending.</TE>
<TE>   "I decided I would prefer the religious life because of a deeper
union with Christ and because I felt I could do more good for more
people than if I married and could just help my own family," Fabilli
said.</TE>
<TE>   Although their average age has been inching upward -- the median
is now estimated to be 63 -- the sisters say younger women are
increasingly joining their community, including some from Mexico, the
Philippines, Nigeria and other nations. And though they don't
envision numbers to ever rival the larger orders -- the Sisters of
St. Joseph of Carondelet, for instance, have seven times as many
members in Los Angeles -- they say they hope that their bold style,
creative vision and deep commitment to Christ's gospel of service to
the poor will continue to define and nourish them.</TE>
<TE>   According to Lorentz, Slachta envisioned a pyramid-like structure
in which most members would do the work of "drying the tears" --
working in parishes and community centers, feeding the poor,
counseling the troubled and educating young people. A smaller number,
she believed, should be involved in "movement work," which these days
means organizing for labor rights, anti-abortion policies or better
housing.</TE>
<TE>   At the top of the pyramid would be those working in politics and
government, Lorentz said. She herself has protested the forcible
return of Salvadoran refugees during their country's tumultuous civil
war and was arrested for civil disobedience in protesting the nuclear
arms race.</TE>
<TE>   For the sisters in California, 1986 marked their political coming
of age when they voted to establish a political lobby to press for
issues affecting the poor. Headed by Campbell, the now-interfaith
coalition expects to focus on health-care reform in the coming year,
pushing especially for universal health coverage.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, the sisters are launching an
"Adopt-a-Legislator" program in which several communities of women
religious have signed up to pray for specific legislators and, if the
spirit moves them, to contact them.</TE>
<TE>   "We need one sister for each of 121 elected officials, including
the governor," Campbell said, "although everyone tells me the
governor needs more than one."</TE>

<LD>Restrictions on immigration since Sept. 11 and a drop in donations
have led Lutherans to make extensive cuts in one of their programs
for refugees and newcomers to the United States.</LD>
<LD>   The Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service eliminated 14 jobs
and froze salaries last month to stabilize the agency's finances.</LD>
<LD>   Before the restructuring, the agency employed about 70 people at
the national office in Baltimore and in other parts of the country.</LD>
<TE>   The ministry is supported by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America, the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod and the Latvian
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.</TE>
<TE>   Annie Wilson, a top administrator of the immigration agency, said
about 80% of her ministry's budget comes from the federal government
and, since the number of refugees is down by thousands because of the
terrorist attacks, federal funding has been reduced as well.</TE>

<HD>Bush Disavows Remarks by Evangelists on Islam</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush characterized Islam as a peaceful faith this week,
distancing himself from controversial remarks by some prominent
evangelical Christians.</LD>
<LD>   "Some of the comments that have been uttered about Islam do not
reflect the sentiments of my government or the sentiments of most
Americans," Bush told reporters as he met with U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "Islam, as practiced by the vast majority of people, is a peaceful
religion, a religion that respects others," Bush said. "By far, the
vast majority of American citizens respect the Islamic people and the
Muslim faith. After all, there are millions of peaceful, loving
Muslim Americans."</LD>
<TE>   In recent months, U.S. Muslim groups have called on Bush to
respond to remarks by the Revs. Pat Robertson, Franklin Graham and
others who have described Islam as inherently violent.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Jerry Falwell, in a recent interview with CBS' "60
Minutes," said he had concluded from reading Muslim and nonMuslim
writers that the Prophet Muhammad "was a terrorist." Falwell said
that Muhammad "was a violent man, a man of war."</TE>
<TE>   Bush did not mention any of the Christian leaders by name, but
told Annan that "ours is a country based upon tolerance.... We
respect the faith, and we welcome people of all faiths in America,
and we're not going to let the war on terror or terrorists cause us
to change our values."</TE>
<TE>   A senior official said the administration recognized that comments
by Falwell and others had angered Muslims abroad and caused them to
question whether they represent the opinions of the White House and
of the American people. Bush felt the need to go beyond earlier
statements of toleration for Islam and repudiate the comments, the
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is particularly delicate for the Bush administration
because conservative Christians are a major source of political
support for the Republican Party. Also, Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein is trying to fan anti-American sentiment by charging that
Bush hates Islam.</TE>
<TE>   A representative of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said
he welcomed Bush's words. "Obviously, we'd like to hear him repudiate
these people by name, but we appreciate that he's moving in that
direction," said spokesman Ibrahim Hooper.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesmen for Robertson and Graham declined to comment.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The two top leaders of the Presbyterian Church (USA) said they oppose
a proposal pushed by members of an Orange County church to convene a
special nationwide church meeting to discipline churches and pastors
who have ordained gays and lesbians.</LD>
<LD>   Presbyterian church law bans the ordination of noncelibate gays
and lesbians, but some churches have sidestepped the rule.</LD>
<LD>   Two members of a Presbyterian church in Newport Beach, have
circulated a petition to force a special assembly to deal with the
issue.</LD>
<TE>   One of them, Alex Metherell, said church leaders have left the
denomination in a "constitutional crisis" by ignoring violations of
church law.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to regional church leaders, the Presbyterian's Stated
Clerk, Clifton Kirkpatrick, opposed the move, saying "there is no
constitutional crisis," and intervention by an assembly into the
church's 190 courts "would create just such a crisis."</TE>
<TE>   In a separate letter, the denomination's Moderator, Fahed
Abu-Akel, said a special assembly would drain money from the
cash-strapped church and upset its judicial processes.</TE>
<TE>   "The time, energy and money that we would spend on a special
meeting need to be spent in mission in the name of Christ," Abu-Akel
said in his letter.</TE>

<HD>Jewish Groups File Suit to Display Menorahs</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Jewish groups filed a federal lawsuit this week to challenge an
ordinance that bans anyone but the city from holding events or
erecting displays at a downtown Cincinnati plaza during the holiday
season.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, which calls the city law unconstitutional, was filed
by Chabad of Southern Ohio, which is affiliated with the Lubavitch
movement, a Hasidic group that has sought to set up prominent
Hanukkah menorahs in many cities. The group wants to put a menorah in
the city's Fountain Square.</LD>
<LD>   City officials had said the ordinance, which was passed in April,
was intended to encourage economic development by keeping the square
uncluttered during the year's busiest retail season.</LD>
<TE>   The ordinance prevents the Ku Klux Klan from erecting a cross in
the square, as it did for several years in the 1990s. In 1993, a
federal judge granted an injunction blocking city attempts to prevent
Klan displays.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nation's Roman Catholic bishops will spend the next two years
debating whether to convene the U.S. church's first plenary council
since 1884.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops agreed this week to a
rough timeline for calling a council. If called, the council would be
open to all bishops, as well as to representatives of seminaries and
colleges, priests and lay groups.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this year, a core group of eight bishops circulated the
proposal for a council to deal with issues facing the church, such as
sexual morality, evangelization and authority. So far, more than 100
bishops have signed on to the proposal.</LD>
<TE>   Under the proposal passed this week, the bishops will revisit the
idea when they meet next June in St. Louis, and then again during
their summer meeting in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Archbishop Daniel Buechlein of Indianapolis, the chairman of an ad
hoc committee of bishops studying the issue, said if the proposal is
approved, the council would probably not be held until 2005 or 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Bishops are "all over the lot" on fundamental issues facing the
church, he said, but he added that it would be "very valuable if we
look at the identity and role of bishops and priests."</TE>

<HD>Payments on Homes Allegedly Siphoned</HD>
<DH>O.C. developer who left several projects unfinished is
suspected of paying off his bills with money that buyers gave him for
upgrades.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. Reza</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County developer who left several housing tracts in
Southern California unfinished, including one in Yorba Linda, is
under investigation for allegedly using money received for home
upgrades to pay off his company's bills instead.</LD>
<LD>   Records filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court show that
Timothy N. Roberts, a Villa Park resident, is the subject of a probe
into allegations of grand theft, fraud and illegal diversion of funds
intended for the homes at La Vina Estates in Altadena.</LD>
<LD>   A search warrant affidavit said investigators are trying to
determine the amount involved.</LD>
<TE>   A nine-page statement filed Oct. 28 by Los Angeles County district
attorney investigator Peter A. Parsons said a former salesperson who
worked for Roberts at La Vina told investigators "there were no funds
to complete the building project because Roberts was stealing the
money." A former business partner of Roberts' also told investigators
that Roberts "stole" money from the La Vina project, court records
show.</TE>
<TE>   According to court documents, Roberts told investigators: "There
was a lot of stealing from Paul to pay Peter that went on," but he
denied using the money for his own purposes. A prosecution statement
alleges that Roberts diverted funds to cover expenses, corporate
overhead, contractors and payroll.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts declined to comment Friday. Parsons, the lead investigator
in the Los Angeles County case, said only that Roberts "is under
criminal investigation."</TE>
<TE>   At issue is money that buyers paid up front for improvements to
their new homes when they signed contracts with Roberts' company,
Compass Homes. The upgrades included tile work, kitchen appliances
and cabinets. Investigators believe Roberts collected hundreds of
thousands of dollars or more for the upgrades. The funds were
supposed to remain impounded for that purpose.</TE>
<TE>   But according to one example in Parsons' affidavit, Roberts
diverted $108,949 given to him by home buyers to accounts his company
had at three Orange County banks. The money was supposed to have been
deposited at Orange Coast Title and Escrow to pay for upgrades to the
homes, according to prosecutors. Court records say the buyers of the
La Vina homes lost all of the money they paid for such work.</TE>
<TE>   Compass Homes abandoned developments at La Vina as well as two
Orange County tracts, Yorba Linda Estates in Yorba Linda and Hewes
Estates in Orange. The Orange County developments are not part of the
Los Angeles County district attorney's probe.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, banks foreclosed on millions in construction
loans for Roberts' three projects. The Yorba Linda development was
forced into involuntary bankruptcy by home buyers in a desperate
attempt to keep their houses. Residents are trying to negotiate a
settlement with two lenders for the Yorba Linda project.</TE>
<TE>   Buyers who signed contracts with Roberts in Yorba Linda also
agreed to pay thousands up front for upgrades and other options. Like
residents at La Vina, the Yorba Linda home buyers are unlikely to
recover that money and will have to pay thousands more if they want
to keep their homes -- to cover such things as payments on loans that
were made to the developer.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County authorities opened an investigation of Roberts
after officials from the California real estate commissioner's office
looked into complaints from buyers who signed contracts for 26 homes
in phase three of the La Vina project. State officials forwarded
their findings to the district attorney for more investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The state Department of Real Estate has issued four
desist-and-refrain orders to stop Roberts from developing projects in
Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside counties.</TE>

<HD>Giveaway Could Cut Excessive Watering</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In an effort to reduce urban runoff, county water officials plan to
offer thousands of sophisticated home-sprinkler devices that control
the amount of water used for landscaping.</LD>
<LD>   The $1.6-million program is designed to prevent people from
over-watering their flower beds and lawns, said Keith G. Coolidge, a
spokesman for the Municipal Water District of Orange County. The
district hopes to reduce the amount of urban runoff, which flows to
the ocean, causing pollution.</LD>
<LD>   The program will replace 5,000 automated sprinkler systems in
Orange County homes for free on a volunteer basis. The program will
start next summer.</LD>
<TE>   The controllers manage water usage by monitoring local weather and
climate information. Coolidge said the information is then
transmitted to the controller by pager.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes homeowners set their automated systems once -- like me
-- when you put it in and then they forget about it," Coolidge said.</TE>
<TE>   Studies have shown that the devices can save a household 57
gallons of water a day.</TE>
<TE>   To participate in the program, contact Joe Berg, the water
district's programs manager, at (714) 593-5008.</TE>

<HD>Ruling Due on Girl in Killing of Actor</HD>
<DH>Police are still looking for two adult suspects in the
slaying of Merlin Santana a week ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 15-year-old girl in custody in connection with the murder of
television and film actor Merlin Santana has been ordered to return
to court Dec. 10, when a judge will determine if she should be tried
as a juvenile or an adult.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities believe the teenager was the driver of a car used in
the shooting and not the one who pulled the trigger, a district
attorney's office spokeswoman said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Sandi Gibbons said the Juvenile Court petition against the girl,
who also is charged with attempted murder, alleges that "a principal
was armed with a rifle," which means authorities believe someone
other than the girl actually did the shooting.</LD>
<TE>   Police were still looking for two adult suspects Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The teenager's identity has not been released.</TE>
<TE>   Santana, 26, best known for his role as Romeo Santana on TV's "The
Steve Harvey Show," was shot last Saturday as he sat in a parked car
with a friend in the 3800 block of Victoria Avenue in South Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The friend, who was not hurt, drove to Crenshaw and Exposition
boulevards and flagged down a police car.</TE>
<TE>   Santana died at the scene, according to Los Angeles Police Lt.
Clay Farrell.</TE>
<TE>   The New York-born Santana, whose parents emigrated from the
Dominican Republic, had appeared with Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro
in the film "Showtime," released this year.</TE>

<HD>William Schutz, 81; Psychologist, Writer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mary Rourke</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William "Will" Schutz, a psychologist and pioneer of the human
potential movement, died Nov. 9 at his home in Muir Beach, Calif. He
was 81, and suffered a cerebral hemorrhage.</LD>
<LD>   As a faculty member of the Esalen Institute in Big Sur starting in
1967, Schutz led group encounter sessions that urged complete
openness and honesty.</LD>
<LD>   "If two people hated each other, Schutz might get them to wrestle
then and there," Calvin Tomkins wrote in a profile of Esalen founder
Michael Murphy for the New Yorker magazine in 1976.</LD>
<TE>   A prolific writer, Schutz described many of his training
techniques in "Joy," published in 1967, the year he joined the staff
at Esalen, a center for experimental education. The book helped
launch the institute from a small retreat and think tank to a
nationally known center.</TE>
<TE>   Other faculty members at the time included Frederick "Fritz"
Perls, who founded gestalt therapy, and Ida Rolf, who invented
"rolfing," or deep massage.</TE>
<TE>   In a published tribute at the time of his death, Schutz's family
wanted him remembered as a man with "a brilliant mind" who also was
at home in the physical world. At sports events, they wrote, "he
consumed hot dogs and garlic fries with mustard-stained hands."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Chicago, Schutz earned a doctorate at UCLA and began his
teaching career at the University of Chicago in 1950. He later taught
at Tufts University, Harvard University, UC Berkeley and the Albert
Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. He went on to be the
chairman of the holistic studies department at Antioch University in
San Francisco until 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Schutz also worked as a consultant to businesses and the military
from the 1950s on. He led training seminars based on his theory of
interpersonal behavior, and developed the "Fundamental Interpersonal
Relations Orientation" questionnaire that became a widely used tool
in his field.</TE>
<TE>   He once explained a basic conflict that he found in many
businesses that called on him for advice: "Almost every organization
I have ever worked with claims to place a high value on empowerment.
Almost none really means it."</TE>
<TE>   For example, he said, when he asked bosses to close their eyes and
"say the first thing that comes into your head when I say 'creative,'
" the replies included "beard," "sandals," "dirty," "unreliable,"
"late reports," "never there when you want him." When he asked for
word associations for "uncreative," the answers ranged from "neat" to
"reliable."</TE>
<TE>   Getting corporate executives to break through their habit of
self-deception to allow for the flow of creative ideas became
Schutz's goal. In 1980, he founded Will Schutz Associates in San
Francisco, offering training and consulting.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, he sold his company to Business Consultants of Japan
International, which became known as BConWSA International, but
remained president until his death. The company Web site asserts: "We
are fiercely dedicated to lowering the 'defense costs' of doing
business, i.e., pretending, blaming, shaming, avoiding, bullying,
whining, criticizing, attacking, denying, plotting, kissing up,
hidden agendas, etc."</TE>
<TE>   Schutz is survived by his wife, Ailish; and five children. A
memorial celebration will be held at 11 a.m. Sunday at Mill Valley
Community Center in Mill Valley, Calif.</TE>

<HD>Dr. Herbert Weiner, 81; Pioneer in Psychosomatic Medicine</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elaine Woo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Herbert Weiner, whose pioneering research into mind-body
connections contributed to the rise of psychosomatic medicine as a
distinct field, died of lung cancer Tuesday at his Encino home. He
was 81.</LD>
<LD>   A psychiatrist who taught for two decades at UCLA, Weiner had an
international reputation as a leading researcher in the field.</LD>
<LD>   He was the author of two books, "Psychobiology and Human Disease"
(1977) and "Perturbing the Organism: The Biology of Stressful
Experience" (1992), and he co-wrote or edited 20 others. He also was
the editor of a leading journal, Psychosomatic Medicine, for a decade
ending in 1982.</LD>
<TE>   "He brought a level of scientific inquiry to the field," said Dr.
Michael Irwin, a professor at UCLA's Neuropsychiatric Institute. "He
asked, 'How do we set up experiments to evaluate how the brain
communicates with the body and how stress impacts health?' That was
his stamp."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1950s, Weiner investigated how psychological processes and
behavior affected the development of gastric ulcers and other
diseases and found that stress was a contributing factor.</TE>
<TE>   He later conducted research on the effects of behavior on other
illnesses, including peptic ulcers, bronchial asthma and rheumatoid
arthritis.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, Weiner was one of the first researchers to report on
the behavioral effects of hydrocortisone, a drug commonly used to
treat auto-immune disorders such as asthma.</TE>
<TE>   He also was involved in studies that contributed to the
development of psychoneuroimmunology, which examines the influence of
the brain on the immune system. Among the seminal studies he
participated in was one showing how grieving over spouses who died of
lung cancer impaired the immune systems of women.</TE>
<TE>   Weiner was also known as an exceptional teacher who trained more
than 120 physicians and researchers. According to Irwin, many of his
students have won prestigious awards and headed the psychiatry
departments of leading universities.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Vienna in 1921 and raised in London, Weiner came to the
United States with his family in 1939. He graduated from Harvard
College in 1943 and earned his medical degree from Columbia
University in 1946.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1950s and '60s he was a researcher at Walter Reed Army
Hospital in Bethesda, Md., and at Albert Einstein College of Medicine
in New York. From 1969 to 1982, he headed the psychiatry department
at Montefiore Hospital and Medical Center in Bronx, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, he became the chief of behavioral medicine at UCLA and
worked at the university's Neuropsychiatric Institute and Brain
Research Institute. He retired last year.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife of 49 years, Dora, a professor of
medical humanities and history at UCLA; three sons, Tim of Mexico
City, Richard of Brussels and Tony of Arlington, Mass.; seven
grandchildren; and a sister, Mary Black, of Beaufort, S.C.</TE>

<HD>Prayerful Balinese Gather to Purge Bombing Site of Evil</HD>
<DH>Thousands of Hindus flock to site of Oct. 12 attack in
hopes of restoring peaceful atmosphere on island where tourism is
key.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard C. Paddock</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KUTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>In an elaborate ceremony of prayer and animal sacrifice, thousands of
Balinese Hindus gathered Friday to drive away evil and purify the
site where 191 people died last month in a car bombing.</LD>
<LD>   The islanders asked for forgiveness, prayed for the victims of the
attack and expressed hope that visitors from around the world will
soon come back to their homeland.</LD>
<LD>   "No more blood and tears in Bali," Indonesian Welfare Minister
Yusuf Kalla told the crowd. "Bali must be returned as a land of
opportunity, a land of joy and happiness."</LD>
<TE>   The worshipers, wearing their finest clothes and carrying small
offerings, sat cross-legged in the street in orderly rows that
stretched for blocks from the crater left by the Oct. 12 blast.</TE>
<TE>   A temporary temple was erected in the rubble of the destroyed Sari
nightclub, the main target of the attack. Surrounded by gutted
buildings and piles of debris, high priests sat on a wooden platform
and led the crowd in prayer and chanting.</TE>
<TE>   One priest, seemingly in a trance, slashed the throat of a pig and
drank blood from the animal's neck. At a nearby ceremonial site at
Kuta beach, other priests took two calves out to sea in small boats,
weighted them down and pushed them overboard.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 79 animals were sacrificed for the ceremony, including
roosters, ducks, dogs, pigs, goats, cows and water buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers of the event said such sacrifices are a long-held
tradition and were a necessary step in restoring balance to the
universe after the bombing. The animals will be reincarnated as
humans, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Balinese Hindus are deeply religious, and every house has its own
temple. There are ceremonies to mark all major occasions, including
births, deaths, birthdays, marriages, the purchase of property and
the construction of a house.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's ceremony was one of the biggest and most intricate ever
held on the island, organizers said, and most of Bali's 3.2 million
people were involved.</TE>
<TE>   In villages and towns across the island, they said, people who
didn't come to the bomb site held small ceremonies at local temples
or at home to pray for the victims and drive out evil.</TE>
<TE>   Officials estimated that more than 10,000 people attended the main
ceremony. The worshipers lined up facing the bomb site, even though
few were close enough to see it.</TE>
<TE>   Sastra Wayan, 38, manages a restaurant near the site that has been
closed since the blast. After the purification was complete, he said,
he would be able to reopen today.</TE>
<TE>   "I am sitting here to take part in the ceremony to cleanse the
location of the evil spirits," he said shortly before the prayers
began. "At the moment, this place is like a cemetery, and we want to
purify it so people can live in this area again."</TE>
<TE>   The Balinese Hindus have maintained their unusual culture for
centuries despite being surrounded by Muslims, who today make up the
vast majority of Indonesia's population.</TE>
<TE>   The bombing was the biggest disaster to strike Bali in living
memory and has devastated the island's tourism industry, one of its
biggest sources of income. Some hotels report occupancy of less than
10%.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities believe the bombing was carried out by Islamic
terrorists seeking to create chaos in Indonesia that would lead to
the formation of an Islamic state.</TE>
<TE>   One suspect has been arrested -- a devout Muslim who goes by the
name Amrozi and is connected with an Islamic school in a remote
village in East Java province. He has confessed to buying the car and
explosives used in the bombing and has told police that one of his
six brothers, Ali Imron, a teacher at the school, also was involved.
Police are looking for as many as nine more suspects.</TE>
<TE>   "We are happy that he is arrested, and we also pray that the
police will be able to arrest the others," said Luh Kamiyati, 40, a
doctor who attended Friday's ceremony. "We hope that the perpetrators
will be brought to justice, and we pray this tragedy will never
happen again."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Amrozi's confession, many Balinese blame themselves for
the bombing. Some say they became too lax in praying and holding
ceremonies in the Kuta area, one of the more commercial parts of the
island.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel responsible for what happened," Dewi Darmawati, 26, said
after taking part in the ceremony. "We don't know what we did wrong.
Maybe we forgot God, or forgot to pray to God, but we feel
responsible for what happened."</TE>
<TE>   Among those attending were Indonesian officials, foreign
ambassadors and families of the victims, including many from
Australia who flew to Bali at the Indonesian government's expense.
President Megawati Sukarnoputri, who has said little about the
bombing despite having visited the scene twice, did not attend.</TE>
<TE>   "Our hearts go out to the Balinese people for having endured this
terrible tragedy," said U.S. Ambassador Ralph Boyce, who attended the
event. "But today's ceremony also marked our mutual commitment to
continue the struggle against terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Holy water was brought from special sites all over Indonesia.
Dozens of priests dressed in white and carrying small silver buckets
walked through the crowd, sprinkling it.</TE>
<TE>   Most men wore traditional sarongs, and many wore T-shirts
specially made for the occasion that read "Bali Loves Peace, 12
October, 2002." A large peace sign was painted on one of the few
fragments of the Sari Club still standing.</TE>
<TE>   At the bomb crater--a hole in the street about 2 feet deep--people
left offerings of flowers, money, eggs, rice, fruit and incense.
Nearby, some families had posted photos of the loved ones they lost.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers of the ceremony said workers would begin hauling debris
from the Sari and another destroyed nightclub and dumping it in the
sea today.</TE>
<TE>   Many participants at the ceremony said they felt relieved
afterward and were optimistic that the island would soon get back to
normal.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like now we can return to what we had before the tragedy,"
said Nyoman Kastika, 32, a driver who works near the blast site.
"There will be a lot of tourists coming to Bali."</TE>

<HD>War, Peace Not in Hands of Inspectors, Blix Says</HD>
<DH>The chief U.N. weapons monitor, known for his quiet
independence, is heading for Baghdad determined only to do the right
thing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maggie Farley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>What happens next in Iraq may rest on the gray-suited shoulders of a
74-year-old Swede who insists that his job is simply looking for
weapons and reporting the facts. But the facts he chooses to report
to the Security Council will help determine whether there will be
peace or war.</LD>
<LD>   The world will be watching when chief weapons inspector Hans Blix
arrives in Baghdad on Monday with an advance team of inspectors, who
are scheduled to resume their work Nov. 27, almost a month earlier
than required. Their first task will be to clean the pigeon droppings
out of their old center of operations. The birds have been the only
occupants since the U.N. inspection team withdrew four years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Then the work will get even messier: The inspectors must scour a
country the size of California for chemical and biological arms that
are suspected to be in underground and mobile labs and for documents
that could be contained on easily hidden CD-ROMs in people's homes.</LD>
<TE>   A team of atomic scientists from the International Atomic Energy
Agency will work in tandem with Blix and his staff to hunt for
nuclear weapons programs -- a slightly easier task because of the
size of the equipment required and the radiation that would be
emitted.</TE>
<TE>   Blix's sometimes rumpled appearance belies a precise and scholarly
mind, and he is known to be very careful, often legalistic, but
quietly independent.</TE>
<TE>   "He may look like he's nice, but he can be tough," said Christer
Ahlstroem, deputy director of the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Facing potential obstruction from Iraqi officials, and sniping
from hawks in Washington who see inspections as a quagmire, Blix is
philosophical.</TE>
<TE>   "It's certainly a significant job that we have, and we would like
to go through it in such a way that war could be avoided," Blix said
Friday at a news conference here.</TE>
<TE>   "However," he insisted, "war and peace are not in our hands."</TE>
<TE>   That responsibility lies with the Security Council -- and Iraq, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most important moments for Iraq, Blix said Friday, will
come by Dec. 8, when Baghdad must make a complete declaration of its
missile and weapons capabilities. As recently as Wednesday, Iraq
insisted that it has no weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   But ever the diplomat, Blix says Iraqi officials still have some
time to find something they might have overlooked.</TE>
<TE>   "The Iraqi declaration is a very important document, and we hope
that they take it very seriously," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Blix said he hopes that countries with intelligence about any
violation will share it with his team to investigate "before it
becomes a breach" of the U.N. resolution passed last week. The
resolution gives the inspectors the right to search mosques,
presidential sites, individuals' homes, "anywhere, any time, at
night, during the holidays," he said. "There are no sanctuaries."</TE>
<TE>   In previous inspections, tricks to obstruct inspectors have ranged
from closing bridges and roads to simply shooting at the monitors.
This time, Blix expects better cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   "One flat tire is one thing," he said. "If they have four flat
tires on the way out, delaying us much more, then it may be a
different thing.... I think we will have to use our common sense in
judging if something is a way of preventing us, of hindering us, in
the inspection or if it is not."</TE>
<TE>   If he sounds like a lawyer, it's because he is. Born in Uppsala,
Sweden, in 1928, Blix studied at Columbia University and Cambridge
University and taught international law at Stockholm University. He
joined the foreign service and became Sweden's foreign minister in
1978. In 1981, he became director general of the IAEA in Vienna, a
post he held until his retirement in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Blix could still be hiking in the Swedish mountains with his wife,
Eva, instead of taking a job that is like rolling a boulder up a
hill. But above all, he is a man of duty. He did not volunteer for
this post, but when U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan asked him -- in
desperation -- to take it, he felt he had to say yes.</TE>
<TE>   In January 2000, after inspectors had been kept out of Iraq for
more than a year, the secretary-general had considered nearly 25
candidates before settling on an eminent Swede with disarmament
experience: Rolf Ekeus. After Russia and France vetoed Ekeus, Annan
called Blix out of retirement. Blix and his wife were on a voyage to
Antarctica.</TE>
<TE>   "I was taken out of the refrigerator, literally," he jokes.</TE>
<TE>   Blix gained his experience in the 16 years he headed the IAEA -- a
performance that earned him mixed reviews. Critics say that the
agency missed Iraq's nuclear buildup in the 1980s and that only in
1991, after the Persian Gulf War, did more aggressive inspectors at a
nuclear power site catch scientists trying to enrich uranium.</TE>
<TE>   "Blix was fooled for years," said David Albright, the president of
the Institute for Science and International Security think tank in
Washington, who worked closely with the IAEA when Blix led it. "He
ran a toothless agency, and despite many reports that Iraq had a
nuclear program, they didn't do anything.... The IAEA just got
declarations and checked them."</TE>
<TE>   Blix concedes the point, saying that the international rules that
mandated nuclear inspections at the time didn't provide for intrusive
investigations. Thanks in part to his later efforts, the ground rules
for inspection are tougher.</TE>
<TE>   "We learned our lesson," he said.</TE>
<TE>   To many of his critics, Blix redeemed himself in North Korea. In
1992, despite being told by agency inspectors that the North was
clean, he assembled his own team and caught scientists trying to make
nuclear weapons fuel.</TE>
<TE>   "His actions almost created a war," Albright said. The U.S. had to
step in and defuse the crisis. "Despite the cost to him, he did it.
People inside were furious."</TE>
<TE>   Some critics -- notably, hawks in Washington who never wanted to
go through the U.N. in the first place -- think that Blix is not the
man for the job.</TE>
<TE>   After several visits to the White House this year, he is keenly
sensitive to the depth of skepticism in Washington about the
effectiveness of sanctions -- and the pressure on him to provide an

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>The U.S. and Australian embassies on Friday warned that international
schools in Indonesia were at risk of terrorist attack and told
parents to consider keeping their children home.</LD>
<LD>   The warnings cited "credible information."</LD>
<LD>   Most international schools closed in Jakarta, the capital, because
of the warning.</LD>
<TE>   "The [U.S.] Embassy has received credible information about
possible targeting of schools in Jakarta associated with Western
interests," Friday's announcement said.</TE>
<TE>   It was relayed via e-mail to registered U.S. citizens living in
Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   "American citizens should consider avoiding school attendance at
this time," the warning said. A similar warning was posted on the
Australian Embassy Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Among the schools that closed was the Jakarta International
School, which is attended by hundreds of American children.</TE>
<TE>   Since an attack on the Indonesian island of Bali on Oct. 12 that
killed 191 people, most countries have urged their citizens living in
Indonesia to exercise caution. Some nonessential staff members at the
U.S. Embassy have left the country.</TE>

<HD>By Stepping Aside, China's Jiang Made His Mark on History</HD>
<DH>The changes at the top in Beijing constitute the most
orderly transfer of power in the country's history -- and perhaps a
blueprint for the future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Chu</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>Perhaps nothing in Jiang Zemin's time in power became him like the
leaving of it.</LD>
<LD>   As he stepped down this week after 13 years as Communist Party
chief in favor of a younger replacement, the 76-year-old leader may
have moved a step closer to his yearned-for recognition as one of the
great figures in modern Chinese history.</LD>
<LD>   In a country used to purges and heavenly mandates for its rulers,
his relinquishing of the top job set a precedent for voluntary
retirement by China's leaders, who have historically clung to office
as long as possible.</LD>
<TE>   "In terms of Chinese politics, this is pretty significant," said
Dali Yang, a political scientist at the University of Chicago, who
predicted that the transition will serve as a blueprint for passing
on power from one generation to the next.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Jiang, five other senior officials gave up their party
posts this week, completing the most orderly transfer of authority in
53 years of Communist rule. The new crop of leaders will be led by
Vice President Hu Jintao, 59, named party chief Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Jiang will disappear into the twilight. He succeeded in
stacking the upper echelons of power with loyalists, ensuring he will
have at least an informal say in major decisions in the short term.
He retains control of the party's military commission, which oversees
the world's largest standing army, and isn't due to hand over the
title of president to Hu until March.</TE>
<TE>   But his retirement from the most important post of all, Communist
Party general secretary, is a sign of progress in a country often
governed by personality and whim, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "This transition marked a big step forward in the
institutionalization of the succession process," said Andrew Nathan,
a China scholar at Columbia University. "Jiang was not purged before
his time in office came to an end -- he left office peacefully. The
military did not intervene or exert any influence that I can see. The
elders did not intervene."</TE>
<TE>   Jiang's voluntary exit, along with the return of Hong Kong to
Beijing's control, the country's weathering of the Asian financial
crisis, its accession to the World Trade Organization and the effort
to divest the military of its business interests, will figure high on
China's list of achievements under Jiang.</TE>
<TE>   But he also leaves behind glaring problems, such as the
dangerously large gap between China's nouveaux riches and its
unrelieved poor, which has led to protests by out-of-work laborers
and farmers.</TE>
<TE>   And a smoother, more rules-based succession is but a small
improvement when measured against the fact that China remains a
single-party state that crushes organized opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Those hoping that the Hu era will usher in political reforms to
match China's economic and social changes are likely to be
disappointed. The regime, even in its new form, remains committed to
liberalizing China's economy but preserving the party's grip on
power.</TE>
<TE>   "It's common wisdom that the party has to move in the direction of
[economic] reform and opening up. Nobody would dare switch direction,
because otherwise it'll lead the party to its grave," said Zhang
Lizhong, 60, a retired party cadre. "But there hasn't emerged a
figure like [final Soviet President Mikhail S.] Gorbachev in China
yet. So don't expect too much."</TE>
<TE>   Much has been made of Hu's relative youth in a country where
white, dyed or no hair seems a prerequisite for an office in
Zhongnanhai, the central government compound. In popular political
parlance, Hu and his cohorts are members of the "fourth generation"
of leaders, in line after Mao Tse-tung, Deng Xiaoping and Jiang.</TE>
<TE>   This is the generation that found promising young careers
interrupted or ended by the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when Mao's
tumultuous campaign of "class struggle" trumped concepts of merit and
common sense. The excesses of the period instilled in Hu's
technocratic generation an aversion to radical ideology and a
preference for pragmatism.</TE>
<TE>   But that doesn't mean support for liberal democratic ideals. Hu
and his cohorts were weaned on the idea of strong centralized rule
and the primacy of the Communist Party.</TE>
<TE>   Real political reform, many scholars predict, won't be in the
cards until a takeover by the fifth generation, many of whom cut
their teeth in the post-Mao era and were educated in the West.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not expect to see any political breakthroughs in the way
China is governed for at least another decade," said Joseph Fewsmith,
an expert on Chinese politics at Boston University.</TE>
<TE>   Observers therefore don't expect the new leaders to enact a bold
vision for China's future.</TE>
<TE>   This is especially true now that the inner sanctum of Chinese
politics, the Politburo Standing Committee, has been expanded from
seven members to nine -- a victory for Jiang, who was able to get
five proteges onto the ruling body.</TE>
<TE>   Government decision-making in China these days is an exercise in
consensus-building, in contrast to the diktats issued by leaders such
as Mao or Deng.</TE>
<TE>   "Hu's special skill is consensus-building," Nathan said. Hu "can
lead as a convener and spokesman for the collective. That may be all
that he aims at and what he is good at."</TE>
<TE>   Even if Hu has a vision for China, his colleagues would constrain
him from pushing it through.</TE>
<TE>   As it is, hardly anything is known of Hu's personal views. He has
managed to rise to the top mainly, it seems, by being cautious,
having powerful patrons and showing respect for the old guard,
particularly Jiang.</TE>
<TE>   Until he can build up his power base and move allies into key
positions, analysts expect that he will continue the policies of the
previous administration.</TE>
<TE>   Membership in the WTO will pry open protected markets and put
China on a more equal trade footing with other countries. Experiments
in rural tax reform will go on, as will attempts to reweave a social
safety net.</TE>
<TE>   "Partly under Jiang and [Premier] Zhu Rongji, a lot of the tough
reforms have already been undertaken," said Yang of the University of
Chicago. "Hu Jintao and his colleagues really inherit a much calmer
policy agenda."</TE>
<TE>   What political reform there is will probably occur at the edges --
for example, in further streamlining of China's bureaucracy or making
party positions more competitive. "Nothing that will rock the boat,"
Yang said.</TE>
<TE>   One area where the new regime is expected to press forward is the
protection of private property and business, an indication of just
how much the party has changed from its unreconstructed Marxist days.</TE>
<TE>   Jiang's keynote speech at the congress last week explicitly called
for the protection of private property. This week, the congress gave
its formal blessing to his campaign to let capitalists join the
Communist Party.</TE>
<TE>   And for those in Washington keeping an eye on the shake-up in
China's leadership, Beijing is likely to continue making warmer
Sino-U.S. ties a pillar of its foreign policy.</TE>
<TE>   Relations have improved somewhat since the standoff over a U.S.
spy plane that collided with a Chinese fighter jet 18 months ago.
Last week, Beijing surprised many observers by voting with the U.S.
in favor of a U.N. resolution against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts detect a shift in China's foreign policy from emphasizing
solidarity with the developing world to acting as the big power it
increasingly wants to be. This bodes well, experts say, for Sino-U.S.
relations.</TE>

<HD>Palestinians Kill 12 in Ambush</HD>
<DH>Assailants attack Jewish worshipers and their armed escorts
in the West Bank. A sharp Israeli military response is expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Palestinian assailants ambushed Jewish settlers walking from Sabbath
prayers accompanied by army guards Friday night in the West Bank city
of Hebron, killing at least 12 Israelis and wounding more than 15
others in a hail of grenades and automatic-weapons fire, the Israeli
military and witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   The attack, in a city that has long been a tinderbox of religious
tensions, was among the deadliest aimed at Jewish settlers during the
more than 2-year-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</LD>
<LD>   The ambush was staged in a narrow thoroughfare known as
Worshipers' Way that leads from a settlement outside Hebron to an
ancient and much-disputed shrine inside the Palestinian city.</LD>
<TE>   The militant group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the
ambush. The army identified the dead as four soldiers, five
paramilitary border policemen and three settlers.</TE>
<TE>   Islamic Jihad had vowed vengeance after the killing last Saturday
of the group's military leader in the northern West Bank, in a
confrontation with Israeli troops.</TE>
<TE>   After Friday night's attack in Hebron, Israeli troops launched a
manhunt, firing flares skyward, sending armored vehicles into the
streets and storming several houses, according to Israeli television.
Helicopters circled as townspeople fled the onslaught, and witnesses
said two Palestinians were killed. It was not known if they were
involved in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Ariel Sharon held late-night telephone
consultations with his defense minister, Shaul Mofaz, and a sharp
military response was widely anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   But Israeli commanders have acknowledged that the army is running
out of targets; Israeli troops already occupy or encircle most of the
West Bank's major cities and towns, where they have arrested dozens
of militants in recent days.</TE>
<TE>   Israel is in the midst of a heated political contest, with general
elections scheduled Jan. 28, and the attack could put pressure on
Sharon to expel Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat.
Sharon's challenger for the leadership of his conservative Likud
Party, new Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has urged Arafat's
expulsion.</TE>
<TE>   Hebron is a volatile city, and incidents such as this one -- on
holy days or at sensitive sites, or both -- tend to inflame passions
on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians are observing the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and
have bitterly protested the Israeli military incursions that have
taken place in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip since it began.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's attack, described by officials as having the hallmarks of
a carefully plotted ambush, took place around 7:30 p.m., when Jewish
worshipers from the settlement of Kiryat Arba, just outside Hebron,
customarily walk to and from Sabbath prayers at the stone-domed Tomb
of the Patriarchs. The site is held sacred by Jews and Muslims alike
as the burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob.</TE>
<TE>   The gunmen were believed to have taken up positions on a hilltop
known as Abu Sneineh, which overlooks the route used by the settlers.
Soldiers and medics who rushed to help the group came under fire
themselves from snipers in other, higher positions.</TE>
<TE>   A fierce exchange of gunfire ensued and lasted at least an hour,
according to witnesses, pinning down the wounded and their would-be
rescuers.</TE>
<TE>   Hebron, where about 450 Jewish settlers live among about 120,000
Palestinians, is a city rich in biblical associations, but it also
has a blood-soaked recent past. The city, 25 miles south of
Jerusalem, is the only one in the West Bank where settlers and
Palestinians live in such close proximity.</TE>
<TE>   Hebron settlers are considered among the most militant in the West
Bank. The settlers clash frequently with not only their Palestinian
neighbors but with Israeli soldiers deployed to defend them.</TE>
<TE>   In 1929, Arab riots broke out in Hebron, and dozens of the city's
Jews were massacred. Today, almost every street and square in the
Jewish areas is named for Jews killed in the riots. Jews began moving
back into the old Jewish quarter after Israel captured the West Bank
in the 1967 Middle East War.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, a U.S.-born doctor from Kiryat Arba, Baruch Goldstein,
stormed into the Tomb of the Patriarchs and sprayed worshipers with
gunfire, killing 29 Palestinians and injuring more than 150 others
before being overpowered and killed.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's claim of responsibility by Islamic Jihad, issued by the
group's Syria-based leader, was carried on the Qatar-based satellite
station Al Jazeera. A spokesman for the group in the Palestinian
territories, Mohammed al Hindi, didn't repeat the claim but told
reporters, "Our jihad will continue until victory or martyrdom."</TE>
<TE>   Arafat's Palestinian Authority normally has control over most of
Hebron, but Israeli troops patrol in and around Jewish areas in the
city center, as well as the settlements on Hebron's outskirts,
imposing tight curfews on thousands of Palestinian residents during
times of unrest.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, Israeli troops had pulled back from most of the
Palestinian-controlled parts of the city, and the town had been
largely quiet.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials swiftly denounced the attack, which was the
deadliest against Jewish settlers since 11 people were killed in an
attack on a bus outside a West Bank settlement in December 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Hours after the attack, the army blew up a metal workshop in Gaza
City where Israelis say weapons were made. It was the third such
strike in the same area this week.</TE>
<TE>   The Foreign Ministry called the Hebron attack a "Sabbath
massacre," adding in a statement, "No political process can take root
while these atrocities continue to be carried out by Palestinian
terrorists."</TE>

<HD>Death Toll Reaches 118 in Latest Nepalese Strife</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>KATMANDU, Nepal</DL>
<LD>The death toll climbed to at least 118 in two remote Nepalese towns
that were attacked by thousands of Maoist rebels, igniting pitched
battles with security forces, officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   About 3,000 rebels Thursday night stormed the town of Jumla, 225
miles northwest of Katmandu, the capital, and reportedly used
villagers as "human shields" during the nightlong gun battle.</LD>
<LD>   At least 95 people, including 55 guerrillas and 37 security
personnel, were killed in the fighting, the Defense Ministry said in
a statement. A top bureaucrat and two civilians also died.</LD>
<TE>   "Villagers say terrorists had carried away many bodies of their
colleagues while fleeing," the ministry said.</TE>
<TE>   "The rebels might have suffered more casualties, as the search for
bodies is continuing in neighboring areas," another official said.</TE>
<TE>   There was no comment from the rebel group.</TE>
<TE>   In another attack Thursday evening, at least 23 policemen were
killed when the rebels struck a police post in Gorkha district, 55
miles northwest of Katmandu.</TE>
<TE>   The assaults followed a national strike called this week by the
rebels, who are battling to topple the monarchy and set up a
communist republic in the impoverished Himalayan kingdom.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the rebels also bombed a rural airport tower at
Jumla and set fire to buildings housing government offices.</TE>
<TE>   "Many buildings were smoldering when a rescue team of soldiers
reached [them]," an official said.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels, inspired by the revolutionary ideas of the late
Chinese communist leader Mao Tse-tung, have a strong presence in
Jumla and Gorkha.</TE>
<TE>   Top Maoist leaders earlier this week repeated -- as a condition
for ending their 6-year-old revolt -- a demand for the formation of a
new constituent assembly to draft a fresh constitution that would
abolish the monarchy.</TE>
<TE>   They vowed to continue their battle if authorities refused. More
than 7,100 people have died in the revolt.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels ordered this week's three-day strike to protest King
Gyanendra's sacking of the elected government in a dispute over the
timing of elections, branding it a "regressive" step.</TE>
<TE>   Gyanendra fired Sher Bahadur Deuba as prime minister last month
after Deuba sought to delay the elections because of rebel threats to
disrupt them. The king named a strong royalist, former Prime Minister
Lokendra Bahadur Chand, to return to the post on an interim basis.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Planes Hit Iraqi Targets After Coming Under Attack</HD>
<DH>In America, debate continues whether the shooting by
Baghdad should trigger war.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Gerstenzang</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. aircraft and Iraqi ground forces exchanged fire Friday south of
Baghdad while American officials continued debating among themselves
and with U.N. diplomats whether such incidents reach the threshold
for going to war with Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   The Pentagon said U.S. aircraft dropped precision-guided bombs on
Iraqi air defense and communications facilities near An Najaf, about
85 miles south of Baghdad, at 10:50 p.m., in response to antiaircraft
artillery fire and Iraq's launching of surface-to-air missiles at
allied aircraft patrolling the area.</LD>
<LD>   The incident is similar to hundreds involving U.S. and British
aircraft patrolling the "no-fly" zones of northern and southern Iraq
for the past 11 years. But Friday's exchange carried added
significance because some U.S. officials maintain that the U.N.
Security Council resolution toughening arms inspections in Iraq had
also lowered the bar for initiating military action against Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<TE>   But military officials suggested that the Bush administration was
taking a low-key view of the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "It has no effect on the U.N. resolution; this happens all the
time," said Navy Lt. Cmdr. Matthew Klee of the U.S. Central Command
in Tampa, Fla., which directs U.S. military operations in the Middle
East.</TE>
<TE>   And a Pentagon official, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said the administration was considering the incident the same as
other Iraqi violations of its obligations under a variety of U.N.
agreements over the past decade.</TE>
<TE>   "People want to see this as a trigger for war. That's not what's
going on," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials had said that U.N. Resolution 1441 contained no
"hidden triggers" that would be used to launch war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   However, some officials on the National Security Council staff and
at the Pentagon have since argued that Iraqi potshots in the no-fly
zones are sufficient violations to lead the administration to ask the
U.N. Security Council to declare Iraq in "material breach" of the
resolution. Such a declaration would be a prelude to military action.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said Thursday that the United
States would look with "great seriousness" on Iraqi hostile acts
aimed at U.S. and British warplanes patrolling the zones.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's exchange of fire was the first since Iraq said Wednesday
that it would allow U.N. inspectors to search for chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons and facilities in which such weapons
of mass destruction could be produced.</TE>
<TE>   The no-fly zones were established after the Persian Gulf War in
1991 to protect Kurds living in the north and Shiite Muslims in the
south.</TE>

<HD>U.S. and Allies Tighten Noose on Illegal Oil Shipments
Through Gulf</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ABOARD A NAVY PLANE OVER THE STRAIT OF HORMUZ -- As the Bush
administration considers a military strike against Iraq, the U.S. and
its coalition partners have stepped up pressure on Saddam Hussein's
regime by blocking the flow of illegal Iraqi oil through the Persian
Gulf.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Navy and those of other nations have attempted for a
decade to enforce a United Nations order limiting Iraqi oil
shipments. But that effort has been significantly bolstered in recent
months with additional planes and ships and a newly aggressive
attitude.</LD>
<LD>   Navy P-3 Orion surveillance planes track hundreds of vessels in
the Gulf, looking for oil smugglers. Suspect vessels are watched and
sometimes boarded at gunpoint by sailors from U.S., British and
Australian warships.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, the Orions watch for terrorists who might be
tempted to strike a military or commercial ship, particularly at the
Strait of Hormuz, where the Gulf squeezes down to a 40-mile-wide
funnel between Oman and Iran.</TE>
<TE>   "Our job is to stop the bad guys from doing bad things and make
sure the good guys can navigate freely," Lt. Cmdr. Gilbert Hageman
said recently as his Orion patrolled at more than 20,000 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Crew members on the aging P-3s joke that they are the Highway
Patrol of the Persian Gulf, pulling over bad drivers and protecting
good ones. The path used by tankers attempting to smuggle oil the
roughly 900 miles from Iraq to the open sea is known as the Smugglers
Superhighway.</TE>
<TE>   The effectiveness of the stepped-up interdiction effort is
unclear.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Navy statistics show that, compared with a year ago, more
than twice as many potential smugglers are being tracked and five
times as many are being turned back. Vessels that lack a letter
authorizing their shipment under the United Nations' "oil for food"
program, which allows the Iraqi government to raise money for
humanitarian purposes by selling oil, are turned back to port. By
Navy figures, nearly 43,000 tons of oil was turned back in September.</TE>
<TE>   But there are also indications that Iraq is managing to smuggle
more oil to market through overland routes, particularly with the aid
of Syria. Analysts also note that economic pressure has rarely worked
to force Hussein to moderate his ways.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it's not a knockout punch," a Western diplomat said of the
interdiction effort, "but it's a nice jab to his face."</TE>
<TE>   The program consists of at least three phases.</TE>
<TE>   First is a screen of ships near the Iraqi access in the northern
reach of the Gulf. A team of U.S., British and Australian warships
led by an Australian commodore is backed by Orions peering down from
above.</TE>
<TE>   If suspected ships slip past that screen, the Strait of Hormuz
allows a second opportunity. The navigable channel is only a few
miles wide, and the Orions have photographic technology that can
detect a sailor swabbing a deck.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not the action heroes, but we're helping out in the long
run," said aviation warfare systems operator Tammy Gonzalez, 24, of
Hillsboro, Ore. "We're not focused on, 'Oh my God, we may go to war
with Iraq.' We're just doing our job every day."</TE>
<TE>   Electronics technician David Winther, 34, a 17-year veteran from
Fond du Lac, Wis., said the daily cat-and-mouse game with oil
smugglers reminds him of the Cold War, when the Orions hunted for
Soviet submarines.</TE>
<TE>   "When the [Berlin] Wall went down and the Soviets went bankrupt,
it got boring for a while," he said. "Now with the advent of this,
it's a lot more exciting again."</TE>
<TE>   The Screaming Eagles squadron, based on Whidbey Island in
Washington state, is capable of keeping at least one plane in the air
24 hours a day so that nightfall does not provide safe haven for
smugglers or terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "The traditional role of the U.S. Navy is to keep sea lanes open,"
said Hageman, 33, of Birmingham, Ala. "It just so happens this one is
at the choke point of the world's economy."</TE>
<TE>   If smugglers get past the Strait of Hormuz, a rotating task force
of Canadian, Dutch, U.S., Italian, Australian, German, French,
British and Spanish planes and ships awaits in the Gulf of Oman to
give chase.</TE>
<TE>   Although there may have been bickering at the U.N. about how to
respond to Hussein, naval forces in the region appear to be working
in tandem.</TE>

<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>The Colombian army Friday rescued a Roman Catholic bishop and a
priest from Marxist rebels who kidnapped them four days earlier,
authorities said, in what the government hailed as a major victory
for its tough new security policies.</LD>
<LD>   Anti-guerrilla troops pounced on a group of six suspected
guerrillas and rescued Msgr. Jorge Enrique Jimenez and the Rev.
Desiderio Orjuela on Friday morning, in mountains near where they
were kidnapped Monday outside the capital, Bogota, the army said. The
kidnappers were alleged to be members of the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or FARC.</LD>
<LD>   One suspected rebel was killed and two captured in the operation,
which involved a manhunt led by the army's commander in chief, Gen.
Carlos Alberto Ospina. Combat continued into the afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   Torn between laughter and tears, an unshaven Jimenez thanked God
and the Virgin Mary as well as the army and President Alvaro Uribe,
and said he believed the prayers of the nation were with him
throughout the ordeal.</TE>
<TE>   Jimenez, 60, the bishop of Zipaquira, near Bogota, and president
of the conference of Latin America's Catholic bishops, thanked
Orjuela for refusing to accept an offer by the captors to be set
free.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me he was my bodyguard," Jimenez told a news conference
after the two men clambered out of a helicopter at a Bogota army
base.</TE>
<TE>   The kidnapping, in a week when Uribe's government marked 100 days
in office, drew international condemnation and posed a tough test of
the new president's promises to restore law and order in a country
torn by a 38-year-old war.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to work day and night, with all our energy, to free
Colombia of terrorism and violence," the president said.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Russia on Friday urged U.N. weapons inspectors returning to Baghdad
to focus on their work and avoid a repetition of their departure four
years ago, which triggered U.S.-led airstrikes against Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Foreign Minister Yuri Fedotov said the United Nations
experts, whose advance party is due in the Iraqi capital Monday,
should establish how Baghdad has built up its arsenal since
inspections ended.</LD>
<LD>   "We need now to compare the current state of affairs with that
which existed at the end of 1998, when the former head of the U.N.
commission, Richard Butler, unilaterally withdrew his colleagues from
Iraq," Fedotov told the Itar-Tass news agency.</LD>
<TE>   "That was how he cleared the way for strikes against that
country," he said. Russia had bitterly criticized the Australian
diplomat for not consulting the U.N. Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   Butler ordered his inspectors out of Iraq after complaining that
Baghdad was not cooperating with them. A U.S.-British bombing blitz
followed.</TE>
<TE>   Moscow, a Baghdad ally from the Soviet days with key oil interests
in Iraq, wants to ensure that U.N. weapons inspections are not used
by Washington to justify a military invasion to oust President Saddam
Hussein, a stated U.S. policy goal.</TE>

<HD>U.S. May Punish Colombia Air Force</HD>
<DH>Ambassador advises cutting off aid to an elite unit for
allegedly stalling probe into a 1998 bombing that killed 18
civilians.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. Christian Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>The U.S. ambassador to Colombia has recommended suspending funding to
this country's most elite air force unit, saying it has been
stonewalling an investigation into a bombing four years ago that
killed 18 civilians.</LD>
<LD>   Ambassador Anne W. Patterson also has pledged to help Colombian
investigators in their efforts to track down three U.S. citizens who
allegedly participated in the bombing of the tiny village of Santo
Domingo in December 1998, U.S. congressional sources said.</LD>
<LD>   The steps signal a U.S. resolve to force the Colombian military to
comply with basic human rights norms in exchange for continued
American aid in fighting this country's long and bloody internal
conflict.</LD>
<TE>   They are also an attempt to bring to a close one of the most
notorious cases of alleged human rights abuses involving the
Colombian military, which in recent years has dramatically improved
its record of repression against civilians suspected of guerrilla
activity.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very encouraged that despite the cover-up by some in the
Colombian air force, the U.S. ambassador is trying to see justice
done in this case," said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat
who has long monitored the case.</TE>
<TE>   In recent communications with congressional and embassy officials,
Patterson said she has recommended that the State Department
decertify the air force's 1st Air Combat Command, the unit involved
in the incident, for the organization's failure to adequately
investigate the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Under the so-called Leahy Amendment, U.S. aid and equipment can
flow only to those Colombian military units that have been certified
as being free of human rights violations, or who are actively taking
steps to bring suspected violators to justice.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has contributed nearly $2 billion to Colombia over the
last several years to combat drugs and fight rebels who have battled
to take over the country for nearly four decades. At least three
Colombian army units have been decertified; this would mark the first
time the air force has faced such a drastic move.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson's recommendation to remove the certification, which is
expected to be adopted by the State Department in the near future,
would severely affect the air unit, which accounts for 20% of the air
force's combat capabilities and relies on U.S. munitions and training
for its operations.</TE>
<TE>   The Santo Domingo incident began when a Colombian helicopter crew
belonging to the 1st Air Combat Command dropped a U.S.-made cluster
bomb on the town during a military operation against leftist
guerrillas hiding in the jungle nearby, according to an investigation
by the Colombian inspector general's office.</TE>
<TE>   The Times reported this year that military and court records show
that two U.S. companies, Occidental Petroleum and AirScan Inc.,
helped in the planning and execution of the operation around Santo
Domingo, which lies 30 miles south of an oil pipeline operated by Los
Angeles-based Occidental.</TE>
<TE>   The Colombian helicopter's crew members have testified that they
were acting under guidance from U.S. citizens who were flying a
surveillance plane belonging to AirScan, which was patrolling the
battlefield.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, AirScan was under contract with the Colombian air
force to patrol the pipeline, the subject of frequent rebel attacks.</TE>
<TE>   AirScan has denied any involvement in the operation, and a company
official declined to comment Friday. Occidental says it can neither
confirm nor deny whether it supplied food, fuel and planning
facilities to the military on the day of the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson's decisions are certain to step up pressure against both
the Colombian air force and the U.S. citizens involved in the case.
The Coast Guard has opened an investigation into whether one of those
citizens, Joe Orta, who was allegedly piloting the AirScan plane, was
a military officer on active duty with the U.S. Coast Guard at the
time of the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Colombian air force officials did not return calls for comment
Friday. Orta did not respond to a message left at his family's home;
in the past the family has declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson's recommendation comes at a time when the air force has
come to play an increasingly important role in the Colombian
conflict, which pits leftist rebels against the military and an
illegal army of right-wing paramilitary fighters. The air force, and
especially the 1st Air Combat Command, has recently increased its
missions against the rebels, claiming to have killed as many as 100
at a time in attacks.</TE>
<TE>   As a whole, the air force receives between $30 million and $40
million a year in U.S. aid, although it could not be determined
Friday how much of that goes directly to the 1st Air Combat Command,
according to Adam Isacson, an expert on the Colombian military with
the Center for International Policy, a left-leaning Washington think
tank.</TE>
<TE>   "If aid is cut off, it will cripple the air force for a while,"
Isacson said. "It'd be huge."</TE>
<TE>   There have been two parallel investigations of the incident. Just
last month, the Colombian inspector general's office, which acts as a
sort of internal affairs office for the government, issued a finding
that two of the Colombian air force helicopter crew members
deliberately dropped the bomb on the town.</TE>
<TE>   The office sanctioned pilot Capt. Cesar Romero and crewman Hector
Mario Hernandez with three-month suspensions from the military, the
harshest administrative penalties available under Colombian law. The
sentence is subject to appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The Colombian military's investigation into the incident, however,
has little to show other than thousands of pages of documents.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Colombian air force Gen. Hector Fabio Velasco has
emphatically denied air force responsibility in the killings, first
suggesting that a guerrilla car bomb planted in the town detonated
prematurely.</TE>
<TE>   However, he has repeatedly changed his story. At first he denied
that the air force dropped any bombs during the operation, despite an
internal report within days of the Dec. 13 incident to the contrary.
Later, he insisted that the bomb was dropped at least a kilometer
from town.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, when Colombian and FBI forensic tests indicated that
pieces of shrapnel found in the bodies of the victims were probably
fragments from a U.S.-made cluster bomb, Velasco asserted that the
guerrillas had somehow obtained a U.S. cluster bomb and used it in
the construction of their car bomb to implicate the air force.</TE>
<TE>   Velasco's strong positions and public statements have put in doubt
the integrity of the military investigation, because the judge in the
case is a lower-ranking officer.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Patterson indicated that the U.S. is partly to blame
for the slow pace of the investigation, congressional sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson acknowledged to congressional officials that the U.S.
Embassy has long misplaced a videotape taken by the AirScan plane on
the day of the bombing that contains both video and audio.</TE>
<TE>   The Colombian military has a copy of the videotape, but it lacks
audio. The Colombian pilots accused of the bombing have maintained
that on the day of the attack, they heard the AirScan pilots warn
another Colombian air force helicopter involved in the attack to stop
shooting at civilians. They have accused the Colombian military of
deliberately erasing the audio portion of the tape to turn them into
scapegoats.</TE>
<TE>   The Times asked for a copy of the tape earlier this year, but
embassy officials said they did not possess one.</TE>
<TE>   In answering a Freedom of Information Act request, the State
Department did not include a copy of the tape among the released
documents.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson promised that the embassy would transcribe the tape as
part of the ongoing investigation, congressional sources said. She
didn't explain how the embassy had misplaced the crucial piece of
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   It is not known when the tape was found.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson also told congressional officials that the embassy had
located the three men working for AirScan on the day of the bombing
and is willing to help transmit any request from the Colombian court
system to the U.S. court systems to question the men.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups welcomed the United States' newfound
commitment to the case.</TE>
<TE>   "This position will give a big push to the investigation," said
Tito Gaitan, a lawyer for Minga, a Colombian nonprofit group that has
represented the victims in the case. "This is the time to rectify
past failures and get to the truth."</TE>

<HD>New Evidence of Fraud in Power Crisis</HD>
<DH>Workers at AES Corp. and Williams Cos. agreed to idle
California plants to drive up electricity prices, federal regulators
allege.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Rivera Brooks</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New evidence has emerged that AES Corp. and Williams Cos. conspired
to squeeze electricity supplies to California in early 2000, drawing
an angry response Friday from state officials and bolstering
contentions that the enormously expensive energy crisis was at least
partly a fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Indications of bogus power plant shutdowns, released Friday by
federal regulators, may threaten a settlement unveiled Monday in
which the state agreed to drop lawsuits accusing Williams of price
gouging during the energy meltdown of 2000-01 in exchange for
concessions by Williams on long-term electricity contracts.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission released a previously
sealed investigation Friday showing Williams employees cutting deals
in April and May 2000 with AES employees to shut down one Southern
California power plant that AES operated for Williams and prolong a
maintenance closure at another.</LD>
<TE>   The FERC investigation found that Williams employee Rhonda Morgan,
in two taped telephone conversations, told an AES worker on April 27
that "Williams wanted the outage to run long" at a Long Beach power
plant that had closed for repairs two days before.</TE>
<TE>   In a conversation later that day with Eric Pendergraft, identified
in the FERC report as a high-ranking AES employee, Morgan said, "I
don't wanna do something underhanded, but if there's work you can
continue to do ... "</TE>
<TE>   Pendergraft responded: "I understand. You don't have to talk
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   AES extended the outage through May 5.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, which has a contract to market the electricity from AES
electricity plants in California, earned more than $10 million by
selling more expensive electricity from other AES plants to the
California Independent System Operator during the outages at the Long
Beach and Huntington Beach plants totaling 17 days, FERC
investigators found.</TE>
<TE>   AES and Williams settled the inquiry in April 2001, without
admitting wrongdoing, after Williams agreed to refund $8 million to
Cal-ISO -- $2 million less than the profit Williams made. Cal-ISO
runs electricity markets for last-minute power and operates the
long-distance transmission grid serving about 75% of the state.</TE>
<TE>   The disclosures give added juice to accusations that energy
suppliers worked together to drive up prices in the state's
electricity markets, which were created under California's ill-fated
venture into power deregulation.</TE>
<TE>   In May, FERC released Enron Corp. documents showing that the
energy company used trading tactics to create artificial shortages
and boost prices.</TE>
<TE>   Former Enron trader Timothy N. Belden has pleaded guilty to
conspiracy to commit wire fraud in connection with the ploys, and the
Justice Department and the California attorney general are pursuing
separate antitrust investigations against other energy suppliers,
including AES of Arlington, Va., and Williams of Tulsa, Okla.</TE>
<TE>   The fresh evidence released Friday presented California officials
an opportunity to renew demands that FERC order $9 billion returned
to the state for alleged overcharges during the energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   But a top state official said California is unlikely to gain any
ground in that proceeding because the allegations come as part of an
investigation that was settled last year and because a recent FERC
ruling limited the kinds of evidence that the state can present.</TE>
<TE>   At the very least, the damaging new details gleaned from recorded
conversations between Williams and AES employees -- who at times
laugh at their "games" that earned Williams a more than tenfold
profit on its power -- gave California politicians a chance to claim
vindication and accuse FERC of moving too slowly to help the state.</TE>
<TE>   FERC, which acts as a sort of federal utilities commission, was
criticized Tuesday in a report by the Democratic staff of the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee, which said the commission failed to
devote enough resources to respond aggressively to reports of price
gouging or other misdeeds.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost a year and a half ago, when I went public with charts and
graphs that showed power plants shut down for maintenance at
sometimes four times the normal rate, the energy companies and Vice
President [Dick] Cheney scoffed at the implication that the energy
supply was being manipulated," Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we know the truth. FERC should immediately order refunds for
California. We want our money back from this thievery."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, called the
allegations "very serious" and said they could threaten the
settlement with Williams, which the Davis administration had
estimated would save the state as much as $1.4 billion in power costs
over 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   "We have until Dec. 15 to pull the plug on the settlement ... and
we can continue to pursue criminal fraud charges," Maviglio said.</TE>
<TE>   Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities
Commission, said the FERC report lent credence to a recent PUC report
that concluded that the state's generators withheld power from the
state, causing unnecessary blackouts.</TE>
<TE>   "This shows that FERC, despite all of its promises, is not doing
its job," Lynch said. "FERC, even when they catch the energy
suppliers in shenanigans, they slap them on the wrist."</TE>
<TE>   Lynch said the new evidence would not aid California's demands for
power refunds because FERC ruled Nov. 1 that the state could not
present evidence of market manipulation in the proceeding.</TE>
<TE>   A FERC spokesman declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Williams and AES denied wrongdoing Friday, and Williams said the
state was aware of the FERC findings when it negotiated the
settlement announced Monday. That deal requires $417 million in
concessions from Williams, including a $147-million cash payment.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, in a statement, acknowledged that some employees engaged
in "an inap- propriate conversation" about whether to extend the
maintenance period at the Long Beach plant. But both companies said
the outages were legitimate and were conducted during the normal
spring maintenance period.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan was disciplined and later fired as part of a recent
downsizing of the company's troubled trading operation.</TE>
<TE>   Overall system reliability and the prices paid to other market
participants were not affected by the outages, Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   The FERC investigation concerned the operation of the AES-owned
Alamitos power plant in Long Beach and AES' Huntington Beach plant --
both large facilities containing several smaller plants. Both plants
had generation units under contract with Williams to provide
electricity to Cal-ISO at $63 a megawatt-hour -- enough power to
supply about 750 typical homes for an hour.</TE>
<TE>   The shutdowns allowed Williams to sell power to Cal-ISO from other
AES plants at a premium price -- $750 a megawatt-hour, FERC documents
show.</TE>
<TE>   The FERC report, which had been under seal, was released Friday in
response to a court order sought by the Wall Street Journal, which
first reported details of the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The probe made use of telephone conversations between workers,
which are routinely tape-recorded in the energy trading industry.</TE>
<TE>   At Huntington Beach, an unnamed AES worker told a Williams
employee that AES wanted to shut down one of its generation units on
May 6, 2000, because Cal-ISO was not paying enough for the unit's
electricity to cover the air pollution credits that AES would have to
buy to run the unit, the documents show.</TE>
<TE>   The request was unusual because the unit in question was required
to operate under contract to Cal-ISO to provide a reliable source of
electricity.</TE>
<TE>   "The Williams employee laughed, saying, 'That's weird,' " the FERC
report said. "The AES employee responded, 'Yeah, They're playing
games.' The AES employee added that AES was 'mad because of emission
credits, or afraid they're all going to get used up or something.'
... He added that 'it's just some big game they're playing right
now.' The Williams and AES personnel laughed throughout the
conversation regarding AES' shutdown plan, calling the events 'pretty
wild' and 'kinda interesting,' " the report said.</TE>
<TE>   In a later conversation, a Cal-ISO coordinator objected to
shutting the unit to conserve pollution credits. In a taped
conversation with Morgan, who monitored AES outages for Williams, the
Cal-ISO coordinator said: "So take some of that money that you just
raped us out of Alamitos 4 and buy some damn credits."</TE>
<TE>   Morgan laughed and said, "Good answer, man," the report said.
Morgan later confirmed to the Cal-ISO official that there was nothing
wrong with the unit.</TE>
<TE>   Williams subsequently changed its reason for the outage, saying
the company needed to dredge mussel shells and other debris that were
clogging cooling seawater tunnels that fed the power plant.</TE>
<TE>   The Cal-ISO coordinator refused to accept that reason, saying he
had worked at the plant when Southern California Edison owned it and
mussel shells had never been a problem because Edison routinely
flushed the tunnels with hot water. AES did not take that precaution,
the FERC report said.</TE>
<TE>   Williams later changed its explanation again for the outage,
saying it was not for maintenance but was instead an unspecified
"forced outage," which Cal-ISO accepted.</TE>

<HD>Republican Lawmakers Vow to Fight New Taxes</HD>
<DH>With talks nearing on the 2003-04 state budget -- and its
projected $21-million shortfall -- Davis, Democrats face a fight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregg Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Republican Assembly leaders on Friday denounced Gov. Gray Davis and
Democratic legislators as reckless spendthrifts and vowed to oppose
any new taxes in the scramble to address the state's newly projected
$21.1-billion budget shortfall.</LD>
<LD>   Davis aides responded angrily, accusing the Republicans of
shattering efforts to build bipartisan cooperation in the budget
negotiations that begin next week among Davis and legislative leaders
of both parties.</LD>
<LD>   Even if every Democratic lawmaker votes for the 2003-04 budget
that Davis must propose by Jan. 10, final passage next summer will
require the support of at least six Republicans in the Assembly and
two in the Senate.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, hours after the state legislative analyst's office
revealed its 2003-04 budget projection, Davis invited Assembly and
Senate leaders from both parties to a "Big 5" meeting next week to
discuss possible solutions to the shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   In a Friday news conference, Republican Assembly Leader Dave Cox
of Fair Oaks and Assemblyman John Campbell of Irvine caustically
defined the philosophical divide between Democrats and Republicans in
the budget debate.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats blame the funding crisis on a national economic downturn
and say the only solution is a mix of spending cuts and higher taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Republican legislators characterize the problem as a simple case
of Democratic extravagance that can be fixed by cutting taxes and
state spending.</TE>
<TE>   The looming deficit is the result of "delay, wishful thinking and,
frankly, the arrogance of our colleagues on the other side of the
aisle," Cox said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' press secretary, Steven Maviglio, castigated Cox and
Campbell for their comments.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor's disappointed at the tone and the rhetoric the
Republicans unleashed today," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's shameful they come out of the box to try to make
this so political."</TE>
<TE>   If Davis and Democratic legislators are to find any common ground
with their political opponents, they will have to soothe simmering
Republican fury over what GOP legislators see as having the 2002-03
budget rammed down their throats.</TE>
<TE>   "The history is not real good," Campbell said later Friday in an
interview.</TE>
<TE>   "For them to expect us to forget all that, that's unreasonable on
their part," the assemblyman said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and the Legislature struggled to fill a $23.6-billion
shortfall in the $98.9-billion budget for 2002-03, with Republicans
refusing to vote for a general tax increase.</TE>
<TE>   Cox and Campbell accused Davis of not living up to a late-summer
agreement that finally broke the two-month budget stalemate by
failing to carry out an early retirement program involving about
10,000 state employees and an across-the-board 5% cut in state
spending.</TE>
<TE>   Finance Department officials said the administration is working to
fulfill both commitments.</TE>
<TE>   Republican legislators refused to discuss specific cuts, pointing
instead to proposals floated last June that they said would cut $5
billion from the state budget.</TE>
<TE>   Maviglio blasted the Republicans for criticizing Democrats while
failing to specify how they would fill the $21.1-billion budget hole
without raising taxes.</TE>

<HD>Murder in the Family</HD>
<DH>Teenager and her boyfriend deny killing four of her
relatives in the home she shared. They express sorrow, but say little
of the crime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carla Hall</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a family of beautiful girls, Monica Diaz was the chunky one. "They
called me Chubby Checkers," she says.</LD>
<LD>   She was a Diaz living with the Flores family -- a niece living
with her aunt and uncle and their children.</LD>
<LD>   The only person she felt she belonged with was Michael Naranjo.
While her family teased her about her weight, the boy told her she
was beautiful.</LD>
<TE>   "When Michael came along, he was so easy to talk to," she says.
"He used to say, 'I love you so much. No one will ever appreciate you
like I do.' He used to call me his Cinderella."</TE>
<TE>   She smiles sheepishly as she tells her story, her wrist chained to
a wall at the Twin Towers jail in Los Angeles. In jail-issue blue top
and baggy pants, she sits in a visiting booth on a fall afternoon,
clasping the phone receiver behind a glass wall. She turned 19 on
Halloween.</TE>
<TE>   Michael, also 19, sits one jail tower away. Both are charged with
four counts of murder and one of attempted murder. Both have entered
not-guilty pleas.</TE>
<TE>   In the early hours of July 21, 2000, authorities allege, Michael
stole into the four-bedroom Flores home in Pico Rivera and, with
Monica's help, stabbed Richard Flores, 42, his wife, Sylvia, and
three of their children -- young Sylvia, 13, Matthew, 10, and Richard
Jr., 17. Of the five, only the elder Sylvia survived.</TE>
<TE>   Untouched in the rampage were Monica's half sister, Laura
Reta, and the eldest Flores daughter, Esperanza, who were both 18 and
shared a bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities allege that Michael did most of the stabbing but that
Monica's "involvement in this crime is equal to" that of her partner,
says sheriff's Sgt. William Marsh, lead investigator on the case.</TE>
<TE>   Naranjo and Diaz spoke in separate interviews this fall, their
first since being jailed.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting behind glass partitions in their respective towers, they
appear mild-mannered and affable. He smooths back his longish hair as
he names his favorite bands and speaks respectfully of his
girlfriend's uncle, the man he is charged with knifing to death. She
is given to giggles and occasional tears as she talks about the
family she is accused of plotting to kill.</TE>
<TE>   She says she harmed no one and found out about the alleged plot
only after the stabbings. "I'll have to live with the fact that I
didn't tell anyone about what happened," says Monica, who has a
court-appointed attorney.</TE>
<TE>   She won't call Michael the killer but says: "Michael does feel bad
for everything that happened.... I know if he could go back in time,
none of this would have ever happened."</TE>
<TE>   Michael, who is represented by a public defender, won't discuss
the attack but describes how he feels about the deaths.</TE>
<TE>   "Sad," he says. "You read about these things in newspapers. Then
something like this comes along and it's 10 times worse."</TE>
<TE>   Which leaves the question: Why would Michael and Monica massacre
most of her family?</TE>
<TE>   She describes a life that evokes the name Michael gave her,
Cinderella -- the girl treated dismissively by her family but like a
princess by her boyfriend.</TE>
<TE>   Monica says she knows that her family has "suffered a lot these
past two years, but this gets so one-sided. They make it sound like
'The Brady Bunch,' but it wasn't."</TE>
<TE>   It was a blended family. Sylvia and Richard Flores were raising
their children as well as the two daughters of Sylvia's sister, who
died in 1987. Monica and Laura had different fathers but were raised
together. They shuttled between their maternal grandmother and their
Aunt Sylvia.</TE>
<TE>   Monica was 8 when she and Laura moved permanently into the Flores
house. Bedroom space was tight, so some kids slept two to a bed.
Never officially adopted, Monica and Laura got the same discipline
and love as the other children, say family friends.</TE>
<TE>   Sylvia handled medical claims for a group of doctors, and devoted
the rest of her time to her children. Richard rose up through the
ranks of a custom woodworking company to become a purchasing agent.
He was 6 feet 9 and fond of gold jewelry, an affectionate father who
liked to tease and was protective of all the girls, by most accounts.</TE>
<TE>   But Monica was unhappy. There's a teen angst to her complaints:
When she played basketball to please her sports-obsessed family, her
aunt and uncle sometimes missed her games. They were always there
when Esperanza, a city-ranked high school player, or little Sylvia, a
budding phenomenon, played.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Sylvia, Esperanza and Laura describe a family that
traveled together in their 12-seat van. They squabbled and teased and
laughed together. "We were a combination of 'Cosby' and 'Roseanne,' "
says Sylvia.</TE>
<TE>   They were proud of Monica's intelligence -- she helped the others
with their homework -- and never forced her to play sports. Sure,
Sylvia says, they missed a few of Monica's games but never during
summer league. Sylvia says the children's taunting "wasn't to the
heart. They had their disagreements with each other, but the next
minute you saw them hugging. Despite what she says, we were a real
good family."</TE>
<TE>   Monica says she kept her feelings inside. Then she began dating
Michael in April 1999. They met in Junior ROTC at El Rancho High
School. He became her confidant, her boyfriend, the biggest fan at
her games. They walked to class together, and after school spent
hours on the telephone. They marked each other with hickeys, and left
bruises from their roughhousing.</TE>
<TE>   She dreamed of studying biology, Michael of being a Marine. But
when his grades slipped, his parents forced him to quit ROTC, court
records say. "If he had stayed in ROTC, senior year he would have
been commander of the platoon," says Monica, who also quit.</TE>
<TE>   Monica's family and friends say Michael was an introspective
teenager who dressed in black. He liked to collect knives. "I thought
it was an ROTC thing," said Daniel Gonzales, Monica's friend and
neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   Michael denies the story, circulating since his arrest, that he
was a black-coated Goth steeped in punk music.</TE>
<TE>   "I listen to lots of stuff," he says from a visiting booth in
jail, his dark hair pulled into a ponytail, close-cropped on the
sides, a tiny hoop earning in each lobe. "My five bands are Queen,
Nirvana, the Beatles, Metallica and Green Day."</TE>
<TE>   As for his knife collection, he says, "That's a long story."</TE>
<TE>   Monica says he gave her three. He also collected Zippo lighters,
one of which he converted into a tiny flashlight for Monica,
engraving it "For My Little Munchkin."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm scared of the dark," Monica says with a giggle.</TE>
<TE>   He gave her jewelry and videos. One day at school, she says,
she was craving chili cheese fries, so he ran to a taco stand and
returned, red-faced and sweaty, with her order.</TE>
<TE>   He also had a temper, she says: "Michael, he's nice, but when he
gets mad, it's everybody run and hide. After being with Michael a few
months, people at school said, 'If you break up with him, tell me the
day before so I won't come to school.' "</TE>
<TE>   Michael may not have been a parent's idea of the perfect
boyfriend, but the elder Floreses thought it wise to embrace him.
Richard Flores once took his prized samurai sword from a safe to show
a fascinated Michael, Sylvia says. The boy came for dinner, picnics
and birthday parties. "He was over too much," remembers Sylvia. "We
wanted him to go home."</TE>
<TE>   Sylvia says she felt sorry for him. Monica, she says, told her
Michael had tried to commit suicide four times, something Monica
denies.</TE>
<TE>   But as summer 2000 approached, Richard Flores was growing
increasingly worried about the relationship. He thought Michael was
weird. Sneaky, he told Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Michael says he has no complaints about Richard: "He was keeping
an eye out -- making sure I was an all-right guy. They were all
pretty nice to me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On the night of July 20, 2000, little Sylvia and Monica played
together in an El Rancho High summer league basketball game.</TE>
<TE>   In the stands sat most of her family. But Michael wasn't there. He
didn't have a ride.</TE>
<TE>   When they got home, Monica and little Sylvia climbed into the bed
they shared. Esperanza, the last to arrive home, bid her parents good
night and slipped into her bunk bed in the room she shared with
Laura. She phoned a cousin to chat, then drifted off to sleep about 1
a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime later, Michael allegedly entered the house through the
back door that investigators say Monica had left unlocked.</TE>
<TE>   Police say the killers moved through the house swiftly and
methodically.</TE>
<TE>   They had two locking-blade knives, a balisong -- or butterfly --
knife favored for hand-to-hand combat, a double-edged throwing knife
and a dagger. The handles of some of the knives were wrapped with
cord and cloth tape, for a better grip, according to investigators.</TE>
<TE>   They started with little Sylvia. She was stabbed repeatedly, from
her throat to her abdomen, a piece of silver duct tape left dangling
from her cheek.</TE>
<TE>   In the next room, Richard Jr. was knifed and slashed across his
throat. Matthew was partly disemboweled.</TE>
<TE>   Michael, investigators allege, next made his way to Richard and
Sylvia's bedroom. A sleeping Sylvia was stabbed first. She awakened
to see her husband struggling with an assailant she could not make
out in the dark.</TE>
<TE>   With her foot, Sylvia says, she pushed against the attacker,
surprising him and prompting him to jump off the bed. He stumbled
back and left the room, closing the door behind him.</TE>
<TE>   Michael escaped on his bicycle and rode 2 1/2 miles home to his
parents' house, according to investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Esperanza was awakened by sounds from her parents'
room. As the back door was shut, she heard the rattle of the ceramic
chili peppers strung outside. She went to the hallway and saw her
father clutching his throat. He fell to the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "Call 911," said her mother, lying on the bed. She had been
stabbed in her chest, her torso and chin. Esperanza tried the phone,
but the line was dead. She ran across the street to the house of
Manuel and Helen Yglesias and pounded on their door. The couple
called police, then went to the house with Esperanza.</TE>
<TE>   "We could hear Laura screaming," remembers Manuel Yglesias. "The
whole neighborhood could hear her." Inside the house, Esperanza saw
Monica ministering to her aunt's wounds.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so ironic," says Monica now. "Everyone said, 'If you hadn't
applied direct pressure, she would have died.' "</TE>
<TE>   Monica told detectives she had gotten out of bed to use the
bathroom and, while there, heard footsteps. Frightened, she didn't
budge until she heard her sisters' voices, she told authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators say they found two knives in that bathroom. Later
that
day, Sgt. Marsh showed Monica crime scene photos of the knives in the
bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, that's a butterfly knife. I have one just like it," she
told Marsh, according to court records. But she insisted that they
weren't there when she was hiding.</TE>
<TE>   The following day, Esperanza, Laura and Monica were called to the
sheriff's station. Monica took Michael along. He agreed to be
interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   A bandage on his forearm caught the attention of investigators. He
first said troublemakers at school had thrown broken glass at him,
authorities said, and without being asked, he peeled off the bandage.</TE>
<TE>   It was a diagonal straight edge. That doesn't look like a glass
cut, the investigators told him. Michael changed his explanation --
he had cut himself with a razor blade intentionally but didn't want
Monica to know. The next day, investigators began following him.</TE>
<TE>   Within a few days, investigators matched Monica's and Michael's
fingerprints with the prints on the knives and duct tape found at the
home. They also identified Michael's fingerprints on batteries inside
a military-style flashlight found in the Flores house.</TE>
<TE>   Five days after the killings, detectives arrested Monica at the
home of one of Sylvia Flores' brothers.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly afterward, Marsh found Michael at his parents' dining room
table eating a Burger King Whopper. Out of deference to his parents,
Marsh took him outside to handcuff him.</TE>
<TE>   A search of the house turned up more than 15 knives, a manual on
close combat, a book on serial killers and a book called "Stalk to
Kill." In the garage, authorities said, they found a spool of white
cord -- the same kind used to wrap the knives' handles -- and blood
on Michael's bicycle.</TE>
<TE>   The next week, close friends and family gathered for a private
viewing of the four open caskets. Sylvia, still recovering from
wounds, attended in a wheelchair. She drew Esperanza and Laura close
to her.</TE>
<TE>   "You love your sister, you hate what she did, and she will pay the
price," Sylvia told them. "But she is still your sister."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the two years since she was nearly killed, Sylvia Flores has
refashioned her life. She fulfilled her dream of being a hairdresser.
She took up bowling again. She celebrated her 40th birthday this year
with a party. She returned to the house on Marjorie Street and lived
there more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   "Why not?" she says. "This was my house for 16 years. There are no
bad memories. Except for that day."</TE>
<TE>   Recently, though, she moved out, renting it to friends. It had
gotten too big for her.</TE>
<TE>   Esperanza, 21, is a full-time student at the University of La
Verne. Laura Reta, 20, works, attends Bryman College and lives with
her boyfriend in Los Angeles. This summer she gave birth to a
daughter, Ashley. Sylvia attended the delivery.</TE>
<TE>   An inch-long scar traces a diagonal path across Sylvia's chin. "I
hate it," she says.</TE>
<TE>   She refuses to see or speak with Monica, preferring to wait for
the trial.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the case trudges from one minor court hearing to
another. One is scheduled for next week. Sylvia goes to all of them,
frustrated at the slow pace. A trial could begin in January,
prosecutors say.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't hate her," says Sylvia Flores. "I don't know what drove
her to that point."</TE>
<TE>   One time Monica got her on the phone, and Sylvia scolded her.</TE>
<TE>   "She's guilty of something," Sylvia says. "She didn't say to me,
'Help, Mom, get me out, I had nothing to do with it.' She said, 'You
don't know what happened.' "</TE>
<TE>   Her cousin, Esperanza, visited Monica and came away unmoved by
Monica's tears.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a faker," says Esperanza. "She read a lot of books on how
murderers get off."</TE>
<TE>   In the more than a year she was in juvenile hall, the 5-foot-3
Monica says, she ballooned from 172 pounds to 250.</TE>
<TE>   "All I wanted to do was sleep and eat," she says. These days, she
exercises and has taken up drawing. She's down to 165 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   The only time she ever sees Michael is in court. But he writes her
letters.</TE>

<HD>9 Gay Linguists Discharged From the Army</HD>
<DH>Soldiers' dismissals stem from violations of the 'don't
ask, don't tell' policy. Critics call move unwise, given a shortage
of Arabic translators.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Johnson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Army has discharged nine student linguists, including at least
six learning Arabic, for violating the "don't ask, don't tell" policy
covering homosexuals in the military.</LD>
<LD>   The dismissals occurred over the last year at the Defense Language
Institute in Monterey, the Army's principal language training center,
at a time when the U.S. has been attempting to increase proficiency
in Middle Eastern languages.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the discharges occurred after trainees voluntarily made
their sexual orientation public. Two men were dismissed when they
were found together after curfew, said Harvey Perritt, a spokesman
for the Army Training and Doctrine Command at Ft. Monroe, Va.</LD>
<TE>   The Army said it is simply carrying out a Defense Department
policy established by the Clinton administration and that the
students, by their actions, identified themselves as gay.</TE>
<TE>   But gay activists and some in Congress say the dismissals show the
policy is unworkable, unfair and unwise while the military is
preparing for possible action in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a new height of stupidity," said Rep. Barney Frank, an
openly gay member of Congress from Massachusetts. "If anything is a
critical need right now, it is people conversant in Arabic."</TE>
<TE>   The "don't ask, don't tell" policy was created to protect national
security. But Frank and other critics say it is having the opposite
effect.</TE>
<TE>   "This puts prejudice ahead of national security," Frank said.</TE>
<TE>   The Monterey post is an elite language training facility for a
variety of sophisticated jobs in foreign countries, including
conducting covert operations.</TE>
<TE>   Arabic is one of the most difficult languages to learn, according
to Don Hamilton, a staff member of the National Commission on
Terrorism. The commission produced a report two years ago describing
a "very severe" shortage of translators, and Hamilton said it can
take two years to become even modestly proficient in Arabic.</TE>
<TE>   The discharged students were at various stages of training and
included six learning Arabic, two taking Korean and one studying the
Mandarin dialect of Chinese, Perritt said. Lawyers for the soldiers
gave a slightly different accounting, saying seven were learning
Arabic, one Mandarin and one Korean.</TE>
<TE>   The students were all part of the fiscal year 2002 class of 516.
Of the total, 365 graduated.</TE>
<TE>   "This really illustrates the fallacy of this policy," said Sharra
Greer, a spokeswoman for the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network in
Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   "We are losing qualified, skilled people because of it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   According to critics, the policy was an attempt to distinguish
sexual orientation from behavior. Under the policy, soldiers are to
keep sexual preference a private matter.</TE>
<TE>   "That difference is a complete myth," said Greer, who said the
policy has been interpreted to include jokes or statements
sympathetic to homosexuals.</TE>
<TE>   She said the two linguists caught after curfew were not found
engaged in sexual activity. The curfew violation gave the military
cause to search the room. A Valentine's Day card was found, along
with a non-pornographic gay movie, Greer said.</TE>
<TE>   Critics said the students harmed their case by flouting rules, but
Greer argued that if a heterosexual couple had been caught together
after curfew, the repercussions would have been far less severe.</TE>
<TE>   The other seven came forward over a period of months, in part
because they were concerned by the atmosphere of hostility at the
institute and were allegedly harassed by other students, Greer said.</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Belkin, an assistant professor of politics at UC Santa
Barbara, said 23 other militaries around the world have already
lifted bans on gays.</TE>
<TE>   Greer said many who were discharged left regretfully.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people, if they were allowed to serve openly, would continue
serving," she said.</TE>

<HD>Intense Debate at Hearing Tackles Issue of Nurse Staffing
at Hospitals</HD>
<DH>Caregivers say they have too many patients to handle
safely. Hospital officials say a nurse shortage keeps them from
adding personnel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Richardson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How many patients can one nurse safely care for?</LD>
<LD>   That question was debated Friday at a spirited hearing in downtown
Los Angeles about state regulations that will set staffing ratios at
hospitals.</LD>
<LD>   The Legislature three years ago asked the California Department of
Health Services to determine the ratios. At the first of three
hearings, about 300 people from a variety of organizations, hospitals
and unions turned out to comment on the department's proposals.</LD>
<TE>   Hospital industry officials argue that California already has one
of the worst nurse shortages in the nation and that rigid staffing
requirements would be nearly impossible to meet.</TE>
<TE>   Many nurses say, however, that they are so overloaded that they
fear for patients' safety, and that better working conditions would
lure nurses back to the field.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Bailey, a nurse at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, said
she cares for as many as eight patients at a time, and others told of
caring for 12 in one shift.</TE>
<TE>   "I am responsible for coordinating my patients' care, all their
medications, the X-rays, all their lab work," Bailey said. "If I am
lax in that at all, a patient could have a poor outcome."</TE>
<TE>   Nurses from Massachusetts, where similar legislation will be
introduced next month, and Arizona and Missouri traveled to Los
Angeles to lend their support.</TE>
<TE>   "We're fighting exactly the same problems in Massachusetts," said
Julie Pinkham, executive director of the Massachusetts Nurses Assn.
"What's driving nurses out of the field is going to work knowing you
can't do an adequate job," she said. "It's not like if you make a
mistake [in other jobs]. You have to face family members."</TE>
<TE>   Under the state's proposal, hospitals would be required to have an
initial ratio of one nurse for every six patients in medical/surgical
units, reduced to a 1-5 ratio after one year. Most hospitals in the
state now have a 1-6 ratio.</TE>
<TE>   The California Nurses Assn. and the Service Employees
International Union, which represents registered and vocational
nurses, both would prefer 1-4 staffing ratios in medical/surgical
units.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a historic moment for nursing," said nurse Luisa Blue of
SEIU. But she said the state ratios are so lenient that staffing
would be improved only at the worst hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   The two nursing groups differ on one key point: The association
wants staffing ratios to be specific to registered nurses -- not
licensed vocational nurses. Because vocational nurses must be
supervised by RNs, the patient load on registered nurses will not
decrease if they are still monitoring vocational nurses' patients,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The union supports allowing up to 50% staffing by vocational
nurses, as the state proposes. The union says vocational nurses
should be allowed to perform up to their legally determined scope of
practice.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the California Healthcare Assn., which represents
the hospital industry, asked the state to remember that hospitals
have alternatives to meeting staffing ratios: They can always
downsize.</TE>
<TE>   "My colleagues will comply with the law, but severe staffing
requirements would cripple most hospitals," said Stefanie Mearns of
the association. "I imagine you will see hospitals close or they will
close down their emergency rooms."</TE>
<TE>   The other Department of Health Services hearings on nurse staffing
will be held Tuesday in San Francisco and Dec. 4 in Fresno.</TE>

<LD>A South African court Friday freed James Kilgore, a former member of
the radical Symbionese Liberation Army accused of a 1975 bank robbery
and murder in Sacramento, pending a formal extradition request to
stand trial in the U.S. But he was rearrested by police after the
ruling.</LD>
<LD>   "It is quite shocking and strange for this court to hear there is
no documentation forthcoming from the United States," said Magistrate
Hafisa Mohamed, who freed him.</LD>
<LD>   But minutes later, policemen arrested Kilgore on charges of
entering South Africa illegally several years ago, said his lawyer,
Mike Evans.</LD>
<TE>   South African police first arrested Kilgore, 55, last week at his
home in a Cape Town suburb, where he had been living under the name
Charles William Pape.</TE>

<HD>Protester Goes Out on a Limb in Bid to Save Ancient Oak</HD>
<DH>Santa Clarita activists turn to a professional sylvan
sitter to slow expansion in suburbia.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>To construction workers hammering away at new houses, John Quigley is
just a "crazy dude." But the quixotic tree sitter who has vowed to
save an ancient oak from bulldozers has become a kind of Thoreau in
suburbia.</LD>
<LD>   Perched about 40 feet up a broad oak that's about twice the age of
the nation, Quigley has become an environmental phenomenon after two
weeks of sylvan-squatting on the outskirts of Santa Clarita.</LD>
<LD>   The county is forcing the developer to tear out the 400-year-old
tree to accommodate widening of a canyon road for new subdivisions
that have spread across the area.</LD>
<TE>   News of his sojourn has traveled fast enough to reach "Remedy," a
27-year-old EarthFirst! activist who has been sitting in a coastal
redwood in Humboldt County for eight months.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's great," she said by cell phone. "Even if you're in
suburbia, you're still on Earth."</TE>
<TE>   "You still have a responsibility to the water and to the air. So
many of these actions have been in the backwoods. The issue doesn't
make it into the forefront of people's minds. To have it happen in
suburbia is just awesome."</TE>
<TE>   Quigley's protest, however, didn't just "happen." It was planned
by an otherwise staid environmental group of professionals and
homemakers who grew to believe that pedestrian protests over runaway
growth were falling on deaf ears.</TE>
<TE>   What Santa Clarita activists decided they needed was a tree
sitter, a professional willing to rough it for them. They turned to
the Internet and turned up Quigley, a 42-year-old Pacific Palisades
resident who in 1995 squatted in a tree in British Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully what it does is inspire people around here to get
involved earlier in the process so this kind of thing doesn't happen
again," Quigley said from his perch beside Pico Canyon Road. "This is
something we should be valuing and it is not being valued by the
county or the developers. It's just something in the way."</TE>
<TE>   The tree-sitting saga has touched a chord, drawing scores of
residents to Tree 419, so designated by county bureaucrats involved
in widening Pico Canyon Road.</TE>
<TE>   "The tree may be more of a symbol that we'd like to resolve this
issue [of sprawl] in a different way, instead of letting things get
to this point," said Laurene Weste, a member of the Santa Clarita
City Council, which voted 3 to 2 last week to ask the county to find
a way to save the tree.</TE>
<TE>   Far from the stereotype of vegan tree cuddlers, Santa Clarita's
nascent environmental movement preferred to sue rather than squat --
until they opted to reach into the playbook of radical groups such as
EarthFirst! and Greenpeace.</TE>
<TE>   "We've made a fuss about frogs and toads disappearing, but this
oak tree does really seem to get people's attention," said Larry
Kanner, 61, a member of both of the river valley's major
environmental groups: Friends of the Santa Clara River and the Santa
Clarita Organization for Planning and the Environment (SCOPE). "I
think people are starting to feel closed in on from every direction
around here."</TE>
<TE>   Lynne Plambeck, president of SCOPE, sent out an urgent e-mail
seeking an experienced tree sitter when she found out the group's
attempts to save Tree 419 had failed.</TE>
<TE>   Quigley got the e-mail from a friend in late October, and the
environmental educator leapt at the chance. "I thought, 'They're
never going to find someone who can put it together so fast out
there,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   The protest was as obscure as EarthFirst! efforts to stop logging
in the Pacific Northwest until the developer, John Laing Homes,
entered the picture and moved the tree closer to a date with the
bulldozer.</TE>
<TE>   Mothers with babies, construction workers, hordes of media and
curious suburbanites have since flocked to the site, where Quigley
sat Friday atop a platform the size of a door, holding off sheriff's
deputies, firefighters and a crisis negotiator. A troupe of Native
Americans even arrived Friday night to claim the site might be an
ancient burial ground. They perfomed a ceremony and songs for any
spirits in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Quigley's newfound friends bring him so many plates of hot food
each night that he can't eat them all. Some backers risked arrest and
hopped the fence, camping out below him and hoisting supplies up by
rope -- and his waste back down in jars and bags. One man even
climbed the tree to join him for a time.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's pretty cool and he should stay up there," said
Matthew Zubal, a 10-year-old who peered through a chain-link fence
authorities put around the tree. "Me and my friends used to climb
this tree. I think it's cool that people want to move here, but 85%
of the reason they want to move here is because of the views. There's
not going to be a view if they tear it all down."</TE>
<TE>   John Zirbel, 38, who has lived in Santa Clarita since 1969, called
the issue a "no-brainer."</TE>
<TE>   "This is a 400-year-old tree and it's been taken for granted,"
Zirbel said. "They're just so quick with the way they cut stuff down
around here. There's got to be a better way of doing this."</TE>
<TE>   But Javier Puentes, 38, who has lived in Stevenson Ranch for nine
years, said new residents in the area are peeved at the congestion
that is snarling the west side of the Santa Clarita Valley.
"Everybody has a passion for something and it looks like this guy has
a passion for a noble thing, but he's holding up a lot of
production," Puentes said.</TE>
<TE>   Construction worker Gabriel Rojas, 23, a Canoga Park resident who
was working Friday at a nearby development, was more blunt. "The
guy's a crazy dude," he said in Spanish, adding that the county
should get him down and widen the road.</TE>
<TE>   Quigley, meanwhile, huddled out of sight atop his plank in a
sturdy crook of the tree, where he had a supply of peanut butter,
avocadoes, cereal and granola, along with a sleeping bag and climbing
ropes rigged to the branches. Ropes dangled down to the tree's
bottom, where supporters on lawn chairs kept an eye on sheriff's
deputies filming them from behind the fence.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, Lt. Tim Dolan of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department wondered how he would get Quigley down, but awaited word
on whether the developer wanted to press trespassing charges.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever happens, I hope he gets down safe," Dolan said. "I don't
want to see him fall out of the tree. I don't want to see any
deputies fall out of the tree. I've just finished my 30th year, and
I've never seen anything like this."</TE>
<TE>   Quigley said he would offer no resistance, but he wasn't going to
make an arrest easy for officers.</TE>
<TE>   "If they send deputies up, I'll make sure I'm attached to the tree
in such a way that they'll have to take some serious efforts to get
me out," he vowed.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Minnesota, Quigley studied drama at San Diego State
University then moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career. The
change of scenery, he said, shocked him into environmental activism.
He works for Earth Day Los Angeles and the Malibu Foundation, an
environmental group working on water pollution issues.</TE>
<TE>   Daryl Cherney, an EarthFirst! organizer who sat in trees in the
early 1990s, said tree-sitting has slowly moved into the mainstream
since it began in the early 1980s. "What we used to say is we're
fighting tree by tree, so it doesn't surprise me that it's moving
into more urban areas," he said. "I think it's a natural
progression."</TE>
<TE>   Mary Lightheart, a 56-year-old grandmother who chained herself to
a tree for three weeks in Fayetteville, Ark., two years ago, urged
Quigley to stay put Friday. Her protest didn't save the tree from a
strip-mall developer, but she said it kindled an environmental
movement that has since elected a more "green" mayor and City
Council.</TE>
<TE>   Whether a similar mind-set shift will occur in the suburban
fringes of Los Angeles County remains to be seen. County Supervisor
Mike Antonovich, whose district covers that area, has said he
supports removing the tree. On Friday, he requested a crisis
negotiator to try to talk Quigley down.</TE>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Republican Tom McClintock and Democrat Steve Westly remained locked
in a too-close-to-call race Friday as ballots continued to be counted
from their Nov. 5 election for state controller.</LD>
<LD>   With an estimated 243,000 votes still to be tallied, Westly held a
21,309-vote lead over McClintock -- 3,211,783 to 3,190,474, a margin
of only 0.3%.</LD>
<LD>   Westly said his calculations indicated that when the count is
finished, probably next week, he will win narrowly. McClintock said
he would rather be ahead than behind, but declined to forecast the
outcome.</LD>
<TE>   In the tight contest for the 12th Senate District seat in the San
Joaquin and Salinas Valleys, Republican Jeff Denham of Salinas has
claimed victory over Democrat Rusty Areias of Merced, 48.4% to 47.1%.
An Areias spokesman said many ballots are yet to be counted, and they
will determine who wins and loses.</TE>
<TE>   In other undecided races, Democrat Nicole Parra held a bare
187-vote lead over Republican Dean Gardner for an Assembly seat in
the lower San Joaquin Valley. In a San Diego County race for the
Assembly, Republican Shirley Horton led Democrat Vincent Hall by
1,629 votes.</TE>

<HD>White House Insists Its Focus Is on Al Qaeda</HD>
<DH>The recent capture of a top operative is cited to rebut
charges that the U.S. effort is foundering.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Miller and Josh Meyer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Struggling to account for a torrent of fresh threat warnings and the
reappearance of Osama bin Laden, the Bush administration scrambled
Friday to defend its handling of the war on terrorism and counter
criticism that it is preoccupied with Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, bristling at questions
about the administration's priorities, said President Bush's first
order of business each day is assessing the nation's progress against
Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups.</LD>
<LD>   "He does not begin his day on Iraq," Rice said. "He begins his day
on the war on terrorism and the threat levels, and the threat
information that we have about the United States."</LD>
<TE>   The administration sought to bolster its case by presenting new
evidence of success against Al Qaeda, declaring that one of the
terrorist network's top operatives was recently captured and is in
American custody. Officials declined to identify the figure.</TE>
<TE>   Rice's remarks and disclosure of the capture were part of a
concerted effort by the White House to blunt renewed criticism from
legislators and foreign leaders that the hunt for Al Qaeda is failing
from neglect.</TE>
<TE>   In Germany on Friday, Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer warned that
the administration's focus on Iraq is dangerously misguided.</TE>
<TE>   "International terrorism is the No. 1 danger," Fischer told the
German parliament. "I need it explained to me how we ended up making
Iraq the priority."</TE>
<TE>   The White House is suddenly sensitive to such second-guessing
largely because of the reappearance this week of Bin Laden -- who
some U.S. officials assumed was dead -- as well as a flurry of
ominous new intelligence signals.</TE>
<TE>   Citing an increase in intelligence traffic not seen since before
the Sept. 11 attacks, the FBI issued an alert late Thursday that Al
Qaeda may be planning spectacular new strikes on U.S. targets.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said there was no specific information indicating where
or when possible attacks might take place. And the warnings prompted
no change in the nation's color-coded alert scheme, which remained at
yellow, indicating an elevated risk of attack.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's developments underscore how the White House increasingly
finds itself in the seemingly contradictory position of claiming
significant success in disabling Al Qaeda even as it warns that the
nation may be no safer now than it was before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Rice straddled both those positions Friday, recounting the success
of the war in Afghanistan and citing "numerous senior leaders of Al
Qaeda that have either been eliminated, incarcerated or detained
someplace."</TE>
<TE>   She echoed Bush's frequent warnings that the struggle against
terrorism is long-term. "It took a while for Al Qaeda to become the
organization that it is," she said. "It's going to take a while to
break them up."</TE>
<TE>   She also stressed that Al Qaeda is "an adaptable organization. We
have to assume that it's trying to adapt."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, legislators and terrorism experts said Al Qaeda appears to
have evolved considerably over the past year. The conflicting signals
emanating from the White House, they said, can be explained at least
in part because the genuine successes in the war on terrorism have in
many ways shifted -- rather than eliminated -- dangers.</TE>
<TE>   "Paradoxically this recent spasm of Al Qaeda activities could be a
reflection of our success," said Bruce Hoffman, Washington director
of Rand Corp., a think tank based in Santa Monica. "We've forced them
onto softer, more accessible targets."</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman cited recent Al Qaeda strikes on a nightclub in Indonesia
and a French tanker off the coast of Yemen. "It's little consolation
for those tragically involved," Hoffman said, "but we're talking
about a different level of operation between attacking the Pentagon
and a bar in Bali."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the
Senate Intelligence Committee, concurred.</TE>
<TE>   "We disrupted their sanctuary [in Afghanistan]," he said. "It's
going to be harder for terrorists to continue to train, plan and
execute big terrorist attacks. But it doesn't preclude dispersed
terrorists from acting."</TE>
<TE>   The latest FBI warning was prompted in part, officials said, by
the Bin Laden audiotape that surfaced this week, in which he praises
recent strikes in Indonesia and Yemen and calls for stepped-up
attacks against the United States and its allies.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon Johndroe, a spokesman for the U.S. Office of Homeland
Security, said state and local authorities have been put on
heightened alert.</TE>
<TE>   "In selecting its next targets, sources suggest Al Qaeda may favor
spectacular attacks," the bulletin said, citing targets that offer
"high symbolic value, mass casualties, severe damage to the U.S.
economy, and maximum psychological trauma."</TE>
<TE>   It mentioned the "aviation, petroleum, and nuclear sectors" in
particular, but allowed that "softer targets would be easier for
sleeper cells already in the U.S. to carry out."</TE>
<TE>   Rice said the U.S. is taking steps to "bring additional protective
measures, particularly to critical infrastructure locations around
the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether the reemergence of Bin Laden and the flurry of new
threats argue against action in Iraq, Rice repeated controversial
administration claims that Iraq and Al Qaeda are linked.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a relationship here," she said, citing claims that Iraq
has provided training to Al Qaeda in chemical and biological weapons.
She also alluded to a widely disputed report that an Iraqi agent met
with one of the Sept. 11 hijackers in Prague last year. The CIA has
said there is no evidence to support that claim.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials confirmed Friday that a senior Al Qaeda operative
had been captured recently. One U.S. official described him as "in
the top dozen or two" in the Al Qaeda command structure.</TE>
<TE>   Officials would not identify the detainee, but it is not a
household name, a U.S. official said.</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence officials said they continue to analyze the Bin Laden
tape. Analysts remain convinced that it is the terrorist mastermind's
voice on the recording, but technical analysis has so far been
inconclusive.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden, the founder and a principal financier of Al Qaeda, is
blamed for directing the Sept. 11 attacks against the United States.
But Rice indicated that U.S. intelligence does not know whether Bin
Laden continues to serve as the operational leader of the terrorist
network.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we can be certain of what role Osama bin Laden is
or is not playing," she said. "What we have to assume is that
whatever Al Qaeda is doing in terms of command and control has to be
different than what it was doing before because they don't have the
home base in Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   The tape was aired on Al Jazeera, the Arab television network, on
Tuesday. In the past, similar messages by Bin Laden were released
shortly before a major attack. However, in several cases Bin Laden's
message was aired on the Al Jazeera network at least two months
before an attack.</TE>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>American fighter jets pounded suspected enemy positions in
Afghanistan after two U.S. bases came under rocket fire in the east
of the country, the U.S. military said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   In the first attack Thursday evening, nine 107-millimeter rockets
were fired at a U.S. military base near Gardez. The rockets landed
near the base but did not cause any casualties, the military said in
a statement from its headquarters at Bagram air base, north of the
capital, Kabul.</LD>
<LD>   The military called in A-10 fighter planes, which dropped several
bombs and fired about 2,000 rounds of ammunition. Troops found a
suspected enemy vehicle and destroyed a rocket that had not been
fired.</LD>
<TE>   Several hours later, a U.S. base in Lwara, 110 miles southeast of
Kabul, came under rocket and mortar fire, and at least one round
exploded inside the compound, the military said. Soldiers from the
82nd Airborne Division moved on the launch site, trading gunshots and
mortar fire with the suspected attackers.</TE>
<TE>   An A-10 plane fired rockets at the launch site and dropped a
500-pound bomb after three suspected enemy fighters were detected
moving, and another aircraft dropped a 1,000-pound bomb shortly
afterward, the military said.</TE>
<TE>   There were no coalition casualties. The military said it believes
that at least two of the attackers were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad came under fire
Friday from suspected Al Qaeda or Taliban fighters, Police Chief Haji
Ajab Shah said. Four rockets hit a high school, which was empty, and
the airport, but caused no casualties. The airport's runway and other
key facilities were not damaged, Shah said.</TE>
<TE>   Low-level attacks aimed at U.S. forces and other targets have
become common in the restive border region between Afghanistan and
Pakistan, where U.S. troops are hunting for Al Qaeda and senior
Taliban fugitives. But the attackers' crude rockets rarely hit their
targets.</TE>

<HD>Terror Suspects to Stay in Hong Kong</HD>
<DH>Magistrate puts off until January extradition hearing of
three men indicted in San Diego.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tyler Marshall</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>HONG KONG</DL>
<LD>Two Pakistani nationals and a U.S. citizen who are fighting
extradition to the United States on terrorism-related charges won a
brief reprieve in a local court Friday but are expected to face a
full hearing in early January.</LD>
<LD>   The men -- Syed Mustajab Shah, 54; Muhammed Abid Afridi, believed
to be in his 20s; and a 57-year-old naturalized American named Ilyas
Ali -- were indicted by a San Diego grand jury recently in connection
with allegations that they tried to buy four U.S.-made Stinger
missiles to resell to members of the Al Qaeda terrorist network.</LD>
<LD>   They were arrested in a sting operation in September after
allegedly trying to set up the deal during a meeting at a central
Hong Kong hotel with FBI agents posing as arms dealers. The three
purportedly offered the agents 1,320 pounds of heroin and 5 tons of
hashish in return for the missiles and an undetermined amount of
cash.</LD>
<TE>   According to the indictment, they told the agents that they
planned to sell the missiles to members of the Taliban movement from
Afghanistan, many of whom evaded the U.S.-led military sweep through
that country last year and are now believed to be in the wild
mountainous regions that divide it from Pakistan. The Taliban and Al
Qaeda worked closely during the former's years in power in
Afghanistan, and remnants of both are believed to still cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   The three suspects had initially agreed to be returned to the
United States to face charges of drug peddling but then resisted when
the terrorism charge was added this month. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft
reportedly discussed the case with Hong Kong authorities during a
brief visit to the region last month.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence for the extradition provided by U.S. authorities is said
to include several audio recordings and videotapes of meetings in
both Hong Kong and the United States. Magistrate Ian Candy set Jan. 6
as a provisional date for the hearing, pending a review of the
evidence by the defense.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence was received from the United States only late
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   During Friday's court proceedings, Hong Kong Justice Department
prosecutor Wayne Walsh -- in effect representing the United States in
the case -- expressed concern about a possible leak to the media of
tapes that had been given to the defense.</TE>
<TE>   "They could be used to compromise undercover agents used in this
case and other ongoing operations," Walsh told the court.</TE>
<TE>   The three men, wearing civilian clothes rather than prison garb,
stood behind a steel-bar barrier along one side of the courtroom and
followed the proceedings through an Urdu-language interpreter.</TE>
<TE>   The hearing was the first in Hong Kong involving suspected Islamic
terrorists since the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>

<DL>NEW DELHI</DL>
<LD>The United States has removed some legal hurdles delaying military
sales to India and now is discussing selling it electronic ground
sensors for use along the Pakistani border, officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   India has said it wants such sensors to monitor infiltration of
Islamic militants from Pakistani territory.</LD>
<LD>   "We are in discussion with the [Indian] Ministry of Defense right
now," a U.S. official said on condition of anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   Two U.S. government teams and a group of American defense
contractors visited India this week. American military manufacturers
are seeking a place in the Indian market, where Russia is the No. 1
military supplier.</TE>
<TE>   India's border with Pakistan extends from Himalayan slopes in
Kashmir to scorching deserts in Rajasthan. Many areas include thick
forests and are prone to infiltration by militants, smugglers and
illegal immigrants, military officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Relations between New Delhi and Washington were strained during
the Cold War, when India was a Soviet ally, and hampered by economic
sanctions imposed on the New Delhi government after it conducted
underground nuclear tests in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Most sanctions were lifted in 2001 after India supported the
U.S.-led war on terror.</TE>

<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>A judge has sentenced a former Mexican army major to 60 years in
prison, an unusually heavy sentence, for helping drug lord Amado
Carrillo Fuentes escape capture, the Justice Department said Friday
in a statement.</LD>
<LD>   Victor Soto Conde was discharged from the army and fined $38,000
as part of the same sentence for organized crime drug trafficking and
money laundering.</LD>
<LD>   Soto used his inside knowledge of army operations to tip off
Carrillo about a raid to capture him at the wedding of his sister in
the northern state of Sinaloa.</LD>
<TE>   The drug trafficker's alleged lieutenant, Ismael Zambada, paid
Soto for providing the information.</TE>
<TE>   Carrillo fled the wedding shortly before police and troops arrived
to arrest him, but later died in a botched plastic surgery operation.</TE>
<TE>   The sentence is the maximum allowable under Mexican law, which
does not allow for life imprisonment.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Two people were killed and nine wounded after a bomb exploded on a
bus in southern Pakistan on Friday, police and emergency workers
said.</LD>
<LD>   They said the blast occurred at a bus station in the city of
Hyderabad, 100 miles northeast of Karachi.</LD>
<LD>   "Eleven people were injured in the blast. Two died on the way to
the hospital," said an official of Edhi Ambulance Service, adding
that the bomb had been placed underneath a seat.</LD>
<TE>   All those killed and injured were Pakistani, local police officer
Ejaz Bhatti said.</TE>
<TE>   Bomb disposal officer Mohammed Ramzan said the device was locally
made from about a pound of explosive and had been fitted with a
timing device.</TE>
<TE>   Similar bus bombings have occurred periodically in Pakistan and
have been blamed on Indian intelligence agencies or on ethnic or
sectarian violence between extremists from the Sunni and Shiite sects
of Islam.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan has also seen a number of attacks against Western and
Christian targets in the last year blamed on Islamic militant groups.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, a child was killed and more than a dozen people
wounded in a bomb blast near Pakistan's aeronautical complex near the
capital, Islamabad.</TE>

<HD>His Target: Crime in South L.A.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew Blankstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vowing to strike at crime where it is most prevalent, Los Angeles
Police Chief William J. Bratton is planning to unleash a sustained
crackdown on gang-related violence in South Los Angeles, aides said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Bratton called a meeting of top commanders Wednesday to develop a
long-term strategy for dealing with growing concerns about the
explosion in violent crimes, specifically homicides in three of the
four divisions that make up the LAPD's South Bureau -- 77th Street,
Southeast and Southwest.</LD>
<LD>   Collectively, 227 of the 570 homicides citywide this year have
occurred in those three divisions -- about 40% of the homicide total
in the city's 18 police divisions, according to department
statistics.</LD>
<TE>   In the short term, the initiative is expected to include
deployment of crime-suppression officers from the LAPD's elite
Metropolitan Division. Future efforts would include further
coordination with federal, state and county law enforcement agencies,
department officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton will discuss his plans and hear from residents at a
meeting this morning with a neighborhood safety council in the
Crenshaw district, which is represented by Los Angeles City
Councilman and Assemblyman-elect Mark Ridley-Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll take our time doing this and make sure it's done right,"
Bratton said Friday afternoon. "We can't allow the horrendous
violence that's taking so many lives and causing so much fear."</TE>
<TE>   Since his selection as chief, Bratton has emphasized that
long-term solutions to crime must include community involvement. But
in waging a battle against violent crime in South Los Angeles,
Bratton confronts a complex and emotional history epitomized by the
aggressive anti-gang initiatives of former LAPD Chief Daryl F. Gates,
Ridley-Thomas said.</TE>
<TE>   While many residents in the area have begged for a tougher stance
against street gangs and vandalism, they have also bristled at past
policing methods that they perceived as brutal, racist and dismissive
of civil rights.</TE>
<TE>   Gates flooded South-Central streets with officers in Operation
Hammer, which targeted gang members but swept up many innocent
residents. Incidents under Gates included the infamous 1988 Dalton
Avenue drug raid in which LAPD officers smashed furniture, slashed
sofas and punched holes in the walls of apartments.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to know the history and you have to build up goodwill,"
Ridley-Thomas said. "The difficulty is that Bratton remains an
unknown [here], and until he displays what kind of chief he is going
to be, there's a risk involved in any high-profile or heavy-duty
tactics.</TE>
<TE>   "Because police work is imprecise, there will be the predictable
mistakes made and there will certainly be problems with officers who
violate people's rights. He must be on hand to deal with those
issues."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Bratton said Friday that he is mindful of the
community's sensitivity and does not intend "to send in the cavalry."
He said he intends to institute assertive, rather than aggressive,
policing that emphasizes respect for civil rights.</TE>
<TE>   The paradox, Bratton said, is that community residents "want
strong police, visible policing, but they don't want racial profiling
and policing that's not constitutional. We're committed to that. We
can build a trust between the officers and the community."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton has also promised to communicate closely with community
leaders and said last month that he was devising a system to quickly
notify them in case of any problems. The chief has stopped short of
committing to an overall deployment plan for the area, saying he must
first conduct a top-to-bottom review of the department that takes
into account the specific jobs and placement of each officer.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton also said he is waiting for the implementation of his
Compstat computer system, which will allow him to track and attack
crime in real time.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to provide police services to all the communities in
the city of Los Angeles," LAPD spokesman Lt. Horace Frank said.
"Clearly there are some that will require more resources than others.
We'll make those decisions to deploy personnel based on the needs."</TE>

<CX>   Traffic accident -- A story in the California section Saturday stated
incorrectly that a garbage truck struck an MTA bus in downtown Los
Angeles about 6 a.m. Friday. In fact, the bus struck the garbage
truck. The circumstances that led to the accident are under

<HD>Orange County's Jobs Put Crowds on 91 Freeway</HD>
<DH>Survey studies commuting patterns from the Inland Empire.
Only 17% of drivers are going to L.A. County.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Yi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly three-quarters of commuters who use the chronically congested
westbound lanes of the Riverside Freeway every morning are headed to
jobs in Orange County's northern, northwestern and central cities,
according to a report released Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The survey, the first comprehensive study of commuting patterns on
the only major corridor between the rapidly growing Inland Empire and
Orange County, found that more than 40% of the westbound traffic
ultimately ends up in cities such as Anaheim and Santa Ana.</LD>
<LD>   Another 20% are workers going to jobs in northwestern towns such
as Huntington Beach and Westminster, and about 11% to northern
cities, including Fullerton and La Habra.</LD>
<TE>   The findings, presented at the Orange County Transportation
Authority's board meeting Friday, will have important repercussions
for solutions to the jampacked conditions on one of Southern
California's most congested freeways, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Motorists make about 250,000 daily trips on the Riverside Freeway.
That number is expected to rise to more than 400,000 by 2025.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are doing is trying to learn where they are going so we
come up with proposals that make more sense," OCTA spokesman George
Urch said.</TE>
<TE>   Urch said the survey -- a collaboration between the OCTA, the
Riverside Transportation Commission and the Southern California Assn.
of Governments -- confirmed officials' suspicion that the
destinations were concentrated in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Only 17% of Riverside County commuters on the 91 Freeway are
headed to L.A.; 10% are on their way to Orange County's southern
communities.</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of the drivers, 82%, traveled alone, and the greatest
number of them -- 44% -- came from the Corona and Norco areas, which
have experienced tremendous housing growth in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Another 24% came from the Riverside and Rubidoux areas.</TE>
<TE>   "They have the houses, we have the jobs," Urch said.</TE>
<TE>   The study was conducted by videotaping traffic on the freeway
between 4 and 10 a.m. during a two-day period in June. License plates
were matched with addresses, and surveys were sent to 53,876 homes.
About 7,300 drivers responded.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation officials in both counties are considering a number
of solutions to ease the traffic, including adding a parallel freeway
and building a 10-mile tunnel underneath the Cleveland National
Forest.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Urch said, the OCTA will move quickly to add
lanes to the freeway as soon as the agency buys the toll lanes owned
by the California Private Transportation Co.</TE>
<TE>   Only about a quarter of survey respondents said they used the toll
lanes.</TE>

<HD>Call for New Hires Creates Stir</HD>
<DH>Bratton's pitch to grow department to 12,000 officers
challenges city leaders to take action, observers say. Goal faces
tough obstacles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Megan Garvey and Beth Shuster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton, asked again this week to
say how big the department should be, finally had an answer: "12,000
minimum."</LD>
<LD>   The new chief's declaration sent mayoral aides scrambling and
created a stir at City Hall. Bratton's "minimum" represents a more
than 30% increase in the 9,000-member force and is 1,500 more than
the highest level authorized by the city.</LD>
<LD>   Such a large jump in sworn officers raised questions: How would
they find enough qualified recruits? And how could the city pay for
them?</LD>
<TE>   Bratton said Friday that he was not making a demand when he
mentioned the 12,000 number to members of the Los Angeles Chamber of
Commerce. In fact, he had not discussed any specific numbers with his
bosses, Mayor James K. Hahn and Police Commission President Rick
Caruso.</TE>
<TE>   But Bratton's move showed moxie, said Bill Wardlaw, one of Hahn's
political advisors. The new chief made his pitch to top
businesspeople with some influence at City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "I do think it was a very shrewd thing on his part," Wardlaw said.
"He's now focused everybody, challenging them in a positive, not a
negative, way."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton, sworn in last month, was chosen by the mayor in large
part because he promised he could reduce crime without new hires.</TE>
<TE>   "He has told me he can bring down crime," Hahn said Friday. "He
has said it is doable."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton never said he was satisfied with the size of the Los
Angeles Police Department, which at one officer per 400 residents has
one of the worst ratios among the nation's big cities.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly the city needs more; it always has needed more," he said
Friday, when reporters pushed him to clarify his statements from the
day before. "But the reality with the budget situation right now --
we'll go with 9,000."</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the former New York police commissioner has said the
time to push for new resources is within the first six months of
being hired.</TE>
<TE>   But Bratton reiterated his commitment Friday to "make do" with the
force he inherited after presiding over his first LAPD graduation
ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a team player. This city does not have the money at this
particular time," Bratton said. "If we prove what we can do, maybe at
some point we'll be able to go back to the voters and say 'Give us
more and we'll do more.' "</TE>
<TE>   "But," he said with a shrug, "we have what we have."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said Friday he will wait to review Bratton's promised
top-to-bottom LAPD analysis before approving new hires, which cost
the city $100,000 per recruit. Hiring enough new officers to fill a
12,000-strong LAPD would cost an estimated $300 million, city
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor cautioned that cost as well as difficulty recruiting
qualified men and women pose obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the difficult thing right now is we need our revenue
picture to improve before we can really talk about that," Hahn said.
"And, you still have the issue of recruitment."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor pointed out that the LAPD only recently has been able to
fill police academy classes.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton's 12,000 response at first stunned City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "I was wondering what he was thinking," said City Controller Laura
Chick, who previously served as head of the City Council's Public
Safety Committee. "But then I realized that he's setting the stage.
He's being a truth-teller and sending a message to the
decision-makers in the city."</TE>
<TE>   Police Commission President Caruso said that he believed there
will be commission support for more officers. At minimum, Caruso
said, the City Council should fund enough hires for the 10,500
officers already authorized.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we need to get that done, and it's achievable within 12
months," Caruso said. The ranks of the LAPD could be filled with a
combination of new recruits and "bringing back seasoned officers who
-- for whatever reason -- in the last couple years left."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles City Councilman Nick Pacheco, chairman of the Budget
and Finance Committee, said Friday he anticipated hard decisions
ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "If Chief Bratton starts delivering on his promises to improve
policing, we're going to have to make tough choices between more
officers and library hours and other programs," Pacheco said.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said Friday he meant no offense when he told Chamber of
Commerce members: "Shame on Los Angeles" for failing to increase the
size of the police force during the late 1990s, when the city enjoyed
a budget surplus.</TE>
<TE>   "In some respects, [L.A.] took great pride in the fact that they
were doing it with less," Bratton said. "Doing it with less has a lot
of ramifications."</TE>
<TE>   Former L.A. Mayor Richard Riordan, who was elected largely on a
promise to build the LAPD from 7,000 to 10,000 officers, said Friday
he backed Bratton.</TE>
<TE>   "My theory is you never look back. You accept what problems you
have and you move forward," Riordan said. He credited a strong
economy and police scandals with dampening recruiting efforts,
keeping him short of his 10,000 goal.</TE>
<TE>   "Being a police officer is a tough life," Riordan said, "and
somehow or another Bratton has got to use his popularity to help
people understand that."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan said he thought that Bratton was clever for putting out a
high but reasonable number for the force early on in his tenure.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something that has to be said. It should be a goal," he
said. "And maybe we'll get to 12,000 five years from now."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An honorary Danish consulate has opened in Studio City to replace the
Los Angeles consulate office that was closed by Denmark's government
in May as a cost-cutting measure.</LD>
<LD>   The new office, located at 12444 Ventura Blvd., will be operated
by volunteer Stig Stenhoj and one paid staff member. It will renew
passports for Danish citizens and aid stranded Danish tourists who
have lost their passports or money or simply need help.</LD>
<LD>   The newly elected Danish government decided earlier this year to
close consulates in Dusseldorf, Germany, and Los Angeles. The L.A.
office had about 12 employees, said Troels Jakobsen, former deputy
consul general.</LD>
<TE>   Jakobsen will head up a new Los Angeles-based Trade Commission of
Denmark that will assist Danish companies wanting to do business in
the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Danish citizen Jens Welling said he is concerned that the local
Danish community has lost an important voice with the closing of the
larger, full-service Los Angeles consulate.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no doubt the whole community disagrees about the
solution," said Welling, a board member of the Danish American
Chamber of Commerce and owner of a marketing company in Whittier.</TE>

<HD>Revision Cuts Past Dispute on Redevelopment</HD>
<DH>City Council approval advances the proposal for the eastern
end of downtown with the blessing of some of the project's earlier
critics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jocelyn Y. Stewart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The debate surrounding a new plan to redevelop industrial areas on
the eastern end of downtown Los Angeles might have left some City
Hall observers feeling that they had heard it all before.</LD>
<LD>   As with the controversial City Center Redevelopment Plan approved
earlier this year, city officials said the Central Industrial
Redevelopment Plan would generate tax revenue and attract private
investment, all while providing housing and jobs.</LD>
<LD>   Once more, advocates argued that the plan would do little to
benefit the low-income residents and homeless people who live in or
near the area. Once again, there was talk of a lawsuit.</LD>
<TE>   But on Friday, the Los Angeles City Council approved the new
redevelopment plan -- and it did so with the support of some of its
earlier critics.</TE>
<TE>   "We've achieved a real win-win," said David Farrar, chairman of
the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency's Board of
Commissioners.</TE>
<TE>   Technically, the council didn't change the redevelopment plan -- a
potentially lengthy process. But it did revise a key document that
will guide that plan.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles City Councilwoman Jan Perry said the revisions should
address concerns about displacement of current residents. The project
will help by providing jobs for those with low skills.</TE>
<TE>   "This plan is critical," said Perry, whose district includes part
of the project area. "It is the right thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   The new plan is, in many ways, the sister of the City Center Plan.
But where the City Center redevelopment project area encompasses a
mixed-use area, the new plan covers an area -- 738 acres -- where 61%
of the land is being used for industry and less than 3% is
residential.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say the area has been left behind. Only 3% of the
industrial buildings meet contemporary size standards. The buildings
offer few amenities and 89% of the industrial buildings were
constructed before 1980. The area's narrow streets make transport
difficult. Businesses and jobs have left for modern industrial parks.</TE>
<TE>   "We intend to assist businesses in the area by modernizing their
infrastructure," Farrar said in a statement. "For the businesses and
workers in this area, this [plan] is desperately needed and long
overdue."</TE>
<TE>   Officials estimate that, over 45 years, the plan will generate
$575.3 million in "tax increment" -- money that would go toward the
redevelopment projects. Under the plan, $140 million would be set
aside for affordable housing. An estimated 1,500 units of housing
would be created.</TE>
<TE>   The goals of the plan include upgrading buildings; improving area
traffic flow; increasing the stock of permanent affordable housing,
with support services where possible; and housing for residents at
all income levels, as well as artists.</TE>
<TE>   At a joint meeting Nov. 6, the City Council and CRA's board of
commissioners heard testimony from supporters and critics of the
plan. Echoing the views of several speakers, Victor Franco Jr. of the
Central City Assn. urged the council to adopt the plan. "In order to
successfully eliminate blight," he said, "we believe public
intervention through the redevelopment project is necessary."</TE>
<TE>   The plan's supporters include the Central City Assn., Central City
East Assn., and some local artists, developers and architects.</TE>
<TE>   But several advocates and downtown residents testified at the
hearing that the plan should provide housing affordable by current
area residents, including the homeless and those on general relief
and Social Security. Speakers also pressed for specific goals for
hiring local residents.</TE>
<TE>   The Coalition to End Hunger and Homelessness estimates that at
least 2,700 adults and children live in the area. Organizers also
estimate that a significant number of people live on the streets and
in encampments.</TE>
<TE>   In the Skid Row/Central City East region of the project area
alone, there are at least seven emergency and transitional housing
facilities. The area also includes 16 supportive housing projects
operated by nonprofit developers and at least six privately owned
residential hotels, according to the coalition.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara J. Schultz of the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles said
the current plan falls short. "Fifteen hundred new units is nice, but
it's not nearly enough, especially considering the displacement," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Schultz said, the plan approved Friday had been improved by
the council's actions and her clients were "generally quite pleased
that the council heard the community's input and added more
specificity."</TE>
<TE>   Don Spivack, a CRA spokesman, said modifications approved Friday
"specifically address the concerns that many people had" about
ensuring the "preservation of the existing housing and adding to the
housing supply, particularly."</TE>
<TE>   The new plan also calls for providing housing affordable by people
classified as having extremely low, very low and low incomes.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, it includes the goal of encouraging and facilitating
access to employment for low-income residents. It now provides for
the involvement of local social service agencies in the development
of programs to train and place residents in jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Pete White, executive director of the Los Angeles Community Action
Network, said the negotiations between the city and organizations
that led to the plan "set a precedent for the value of communication
among all the stakeholders."</TE>
<TE>   White said that while the changes do not represent total victory,
they bring the Central Industrial Redevelopment Plan closer to what
the community needs.</TE>
<TE>   White and other advocates can't say as much for the other  project
downtown.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel the same sort of thinking should go into resolving the
City Center plan," he said. "If we can recognize the housing needs in
a clearly industrial area, we can clearly recognize the need for
housing and jobs in a heavy residential area."</TE>

<LD>A San Fernando Valley man tracked down the man who allegedly raped
his teenage daughter and shot him three times, police said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Martin Hernandez, 39, was arrested on suspicion of attempted
murder and was being held in lieu of $500,000 bail at the Los Angeles
Police Department's Foothill Division jail.</LD>
<LD>   Police said Hernandez overheard his 17-year-old daughter tell her
brother and her boyfriend that she had been sexually assaulted
Thursday night by family friend Jose Argueta, 25.</LD>
<TE>   Argueta had offered the girl a ride, then drove her to Sepulveda
Recreation Park, where he assaulted her, police said. Afterward,
Argueta drove her home.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez later tracked Argueta to Pacifica Hospital of the Valley
in Sun Valley, where he shot him with a .25-caliber handgun, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   Argueta, 25, was arrested on suspicion of rape and was being
treated for minor gunshot wounds to his torso in the jail ward at
County-USC Medical Center in Los Angeles. He's being held in lieu of
$50,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a double tragedy," said LAPD Det. Jesse Alvarado.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez has "to deal with his daughter who was assaulted, and
he's probably going to jail and won't be around to take care of his
kids," the detective said.</TE>

<HD>Stocking Stuffers: Mink Slippers, Lie Detectors</HD>
<DH>Beverly Hills merchants concoct a 'Top 10' holiday gift
list that includes the Portable Truth Machine for $4,900.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Pool</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a moment to savor. No, not ogling the $30,000 diamond pendant
or the $70,000 lynx throw rug or the $285,475 Lamborghini.</LD>
<LD>   The most memorable moment Friday came when the public relations
man unveiling holiday gifts touted as seen only in Beverly Hills was
hooked up to a lie detector.</LD>
<LD>   The $4,900 VSA-15 Portable Truth Machine was halfway down the "Top
10" holiday gift list issued by the Beverly Hills Chamber of Commerce
and Civic Assn. amid trumpet fanfare at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel.</LD>
<TE>   Like businesspeople everywhere, merchants in Beverly Hills are
feeling the effects of the recession.</TE>
<TE>   So they are trying to jump-start this year's holiday shopping
season by concocting a mock gift list that showcases items ranging
from "the extravagant to the affordable."</TE>
<TE>   The sports car anchors one end of it. A pair of $50 Nike
action-hero sneakers is at the other.</TE>
<TE>   "Our list features items that just can't be found anywhere else,"
said Ali Soltani, the chamber president.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're finding this too good to be true, I can prove I'm not
lying," added the chamber communications director, Michael Robinson,
who unveiled the 10 items one by one and ceremoniously removed a
cloth covering the phonebook-size Portable Truth Machine.</TE>
<TE>   "The VSA-15 electronically analyzes a person's voice for
micro-tremors that occur with stress and deception," Robinson told
onlookers. "The human ear can't hear it. But the VSA-15 can."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson finished showing the other items on the list -- which
included $50 chocolates, $65 holiday cards, $760 mink slippers, a
$1,000 changeable-face wristwatch and an $8,500 diamond ring.</TE>
<TE>   Then he retired to a nearby room and gamely hooked up the VSA-15
microphone for a reporter.</TE>
<TE>   OK, he confessed: Some of the items on the list are available
outside of Beverly Hills. Like the car, the sneakers, the watch and
even the VSA-15, which is also sold at Counter Spy Shops in New York,
Washington, Miami and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're really trying to show with the list is, you can find a
gift in Beverly Hills no matter what your price point," Robinson
said. "And that's the truth."</TE>
<TE>   The digital readout on the VSA-15 registered no micro-tremors when
he said it.</TE>

Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   The train was late by just a few minutes, but none of the

vehicle, and reality sets in," said Gerald C. Francis, general
manager of rail operations for the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority, which will operate the line.</LD>
<TE>   When it opens in July, the $725.5-million, 13.7-mile Gold Line
will run through Chinatown, Mt. Washington and Highland Park.
Planners envision as many as 250 trains and 38,000 riders a day on a
route that will take about a half an hour to complete, from Sierra
Madre Villa in Pasadena to Union Station in downtown L.A.</TE>
<TE>   As the train began its journey, it jerked backward for a moment
before leaving South Pasadena's Mission Station. It reached a top
speed of 30 mph with only a whisper of noise. Along the route, police
blocked off intersections and people waved from the streets. One
person held up a sign, "You've Got Rail!"</TE>
<TE>   For MTA train operator Gwen Bonville, a member of the start-up
team that has been testing the trains and the track for two months,
Friday's trip was cause for a bit of nervousness.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is here," she fretted, including her bosses' boss and
"all of the bigwigs."</TE>
<TE>   "I convinced myself that this is what I do every day," she said
after completing the 1 1/2-mile trip from South Pasadena to Pasadena
in under three minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Another operator returned the passengers to Mission Station less
than 15 minutes after they embarked.</TE>
<TE>   How was the ride? Train aficionado Tom Nelson gave it his stamp of
approval. "It compares with the airport express train in Hong Kong,"
he said. "This was similar in feel: a good, smooth ride."</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly gave a sense of comfort and security," said Pasadena
Mayor Bill Bogaard, who welcomed the riders to the Fillmore Station
in Pasadena and then boarded the train going south. "There was
nothing unsettling at all about it."</TE>
<TE>   The Gold Line is regarded as a key element in the region's growing
transit network. From it, riders will be able to connect with the
MTA's light-rail system, which already covers roughly 60 miles, and
with Amtrak, Metrolink and buses.</TE>
<TE>   The Gold Line will be linked with a planned six-mile Eastside
line, with construction scheduled to begin next year.</TE>
<TE>   An extension of the Gold Line, to the Los Angeles County limits in
Claremont, is also being planned.</TE>
<TE>   MTA began construction of the Gold Line in the early 1990s. But
the transit agency, crushed by debt from the construction of its
separate 17-mile subway system, floundered at the task.</TE>
<TE>   With cost overruns dogging the Pasadena line, a frustrated state
Legislature took the project away from the MTA in 1999 and created a
construction authority whose sole task was to build the line. It is
now about 85% complete, with stations nearly finished and track and
power systems almost in place.</TE>
<TE>   "We are on schedule, we are on budget and we are looking forward
to opening in July 2003," said Paul Little, a Pasadena city
councilman and chairman of the Gold Line construction authority. He
was among the passengers Friday, as were county Supervisor Mike
Antonovich and Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank), who was a state
senator when the line started construction.</TE>
<TE>   "This may be the last free ride for some of us," Little quipped
before boarding the train.</TE>

<HD>Zoo Conservation Program Starts in the Parking Lot</HD>
<DH>As the L.A. facility undergoes a major makeover, one of its
improvements will be an innovative 'green' area for visitors' cars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patricia Ward Biederman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As soon as the rains started last week, Bill Lukehart rushed out to
the parking lot at the Los Angeles Zoo to take photographs.</LD>
<LD>   The zoo's 39-year-old project manager was thrilled to see
rainwater filling a trench that runs along the zoo's roadway in
Griffith Park. He hopes that soon the zoo will have an innovative
"green" parking lot, lined with rows of native plants that help clean
and control storm water, and "solar trees" that generate electricity.</LD>
<LD>   The solar trees -- steel structures covered with solar panels and
photovoltaic cells -- are on Lukehart's wish list, waiting for the
necessary funds. But the parking lot already includes a demonstration
of what the project could be.</LD>
<TE>   As rainwater accumulates in the trench, the runoff is sucked up by
native sycamores and grasses. The plants clean the water and release
it back into the air by the process of transpiration.</TE>
<TE>   The zoo is in the early stages of a major makeover, but it's the
parking lot that gets Lukehart really jazzed. The parking lot of
tomorrow, he said, will be a compelling exhibit in its own right --
showing the many benefits of building in environmentally friendly
ways.</TE>
<TE>   The parking lot also will be part of the California-themed section
of the zoo, which includes the entrance and the Channel
Islands-inspired Sea Lions Cliffs, now under construction.</TE>
<TE>   "The mission of the zoo is about education and conservation, and
what better place to demonstrate sustainable building practices than
a California-themed parking lot?" he said. "We want to be a regional
model."</TE>
<TE>   The 30-acre lot that he envisions, on the same site as the
existing one, will provide 3,500 parking spaces. About 1.5 million
people visit the zoo each year.</TE>
<TE>   The lot already is being rebuilt to better reflect its Southern
California setting. The Australian eucalyptus trees are being
replaced with native sycamores, oaks and other indigenous plants.</TE>
<TE>   Without irony, Lukehart refers to the parking lot, with its
burgeoning number of native plants, as a garden -- one that reflects
the subtle seasons of Greater Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "When you arrive in this garden this time of year, the sycamore
trees are turning California gold, and the clumping grasses are going
to seed," he said. "It gives you a sense of place. You're immersed in
California here."</TE>
<TE>   The parking lot will have greenbelts or swales of native trees and
plants, such as those along the road.</TE>
<TE>   "These are replicated riparian corridors where water can get back
into the ground," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Permeable paving also will be used. Before the parking lot was
asphalted, Lukehart said, 60% of the rainwater that fell on the area
went back into the ground. "As soon as you put in asphalt, 98% of the
water goes directly to the L.A. River and then to the ocean," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, as plans for the zoo's makeover were being hammered out,
environmental groups were asked to identify what was most important
to them.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Hartman, treasurer of the California Native Plant Society,
praised the zoo planners for getting input from concerned people
early in the process.</TE>
<TE>   "They did the right thing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lukehart ticks off the key elements of the innovative lot. Its
most visionary feature is the solar trees. Covering three acres,
these futuristic structures will shade visitors' cars and may
generate 30% of the electricity that the zoo uses, Lukehart said.</TE>
<TE>   Without shade, the asphalt and the surrounding area get hotter
when baked by the sun, he said, and "more heat means more air
conditioning."</TE>
<TE>   The plan also calls for three acres of native trees.</TE>
<TE>   The Economic Development Group of the Los Angeles Department of
Water and Power will invest $3 million in the project. The zoo hopes
to get the rest of the money from grants and other city funds.</TE>
<TE>   Lukehart already can see what the new lot will be like.
Schoolchildren, getting off their buses, will spot the parade of
solar trees and ask their teachers, "What's that?" There will be
explanatory signs and exhibits, and zoo docents will be able to start
their spiels in the parking lot by explaining how plants filter water
and the purpose of photovoltaic cells.</TE>
<TE>   For Lukehart, it's every bit as exciting as swimming hippos. He
predicts: "All our guests are going to see this."</TE>

<HD>Kaiser Will Pay $1-Million Fine for Death</HD>
<DH>The state's biggest HMO gives in to regulators who said the
firm failed to deliver timely care to a woman who died of an
aneurysm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Ornstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kaiser Permanente, the state's largest HMO, has agreed to pay a
$1-million fine for what California regulators called fatal lapses in
the treatment of a patient, officials announced Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Kaiser had vigorously fought the penalty in state and federal
proceedings, but decided it was time to move on.</LD>
<LD>   The fine, initially imposed in May 2000, is the state's largest
against a full-service health maintenance organization, said Daniel
Zingale, director of the California Department of Managed Health
Care.</LD>
<TE>   The state alleged that Kaiser failed to deliver urgently needed
care to 74-year-old Margaret Utterback, who died in 1996 of an
abdominal aortic aneurysm. The state also claimed that Kaiser had
"systemic" problems treating patients in a timely manner.</TE>
<TE>   Zingale said the fine sends a message to all HMOs that violating
patient rights laws carries consequences. "This means that the debts
to society are being paid, and I think that creates a safer
environment for patients," Zingale said.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, Kaiser claimed that Zingale's agency had no right to
oversee the quality of medical care that its 6.3 million patients in
California receive. This week, Kaiser officials conceded that the
state has the authority to discipline the HMO, but denied that their
medical-care system was flawed.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesman Jim Anderson said the HMO giant gave up its protests in
the case to "put this all behind us."</TE>
<TE>   "There are many, many more areas where we agree with the [HMO
regulators], and that's what we're trying to emphasize by doing
this," Anderson said. "The point of this is to move forward and not
to dwell on what went on in the past."</TE>
<TE>   Some of Kaiser's critics praised the HMO for paying the fine and
possibly turning a corner. They said Kaiser's new chief executive
officer, George Halvorson, has taken a more conciliatory approach
with state regulators since taking the job this year.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope it's not just a face lift but a heart transplant," said
Jamie Court, director of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer
Rights, which has sued Kaiser in the past. "The recalcitrance that
has marked Kaiser's problems with the public is certainly fading."</TE>
<TE>   Court also pointed to Kaiser's decision in September to donate $1
million to Duke University so a 3-year-old Northern California child
can get an experimental stem-cell transplant in an effort to save him
from a deadly disease. Kaiser had previously denied coverage for the
procedure.</TE>
<TE>   Since May, Kaiser has been working to develop clinical guidelines
to help doctors recognize the type of aneurysm that killed Utterback,
who lived in San Leandro. That work is ongoing, Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   According to state documents, Utterback's problems with Kaiser
began Jan. 26, 1996, when she woke up with a pain in her side and was
unable to get a doctor's appointment. After repeated calls to Kaiser,
she finally got a 4:15 p.m. slot, but showed up at the doctor's
office two hours early in tears.</TE>
<TE>   Though she asked to be seen early three times and "squirmed in her
chair and held onto her side" in view of the reception desk, she was
not seen by her doctor until 4:30, the documents state.</TE>
<TE>   Almost immediately, the doctor diagnosed an aortic aneurysm and
paramedics were called, but an hour passed before Utterback reached a
hospital. Her aneurysm burst within minutes of her arrival. She was
rushed to surgery, but the hospital staff was never able to stabilize
her and she died a day and a half later.</TE>
<TE>   Later, her family began to complain about her treatment. And in
May 2000, the state Department of Corporations, which previously
regulated HMOs, imposed a $1-million fine on Kaiser. Zingale's
agency, which took over the case later that year, increased the fine
to $1.1 million in February 2001, citing the deaths of two other
Kaiser members from undiagnosed aneurysms.</TE>
<TE>   The HMO's lawyers attempted to have Zingale found in contempt of
court by U.S. District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew because they claimed the
regulator improperly cited the deaths of two Medicare enrollees in
justifying its fine. The judge refused that request in December 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser also appealed to a state administrative law judge in
Oakland. In May the judge struck down the fine, saying Zingale had
overstepped his authority and was not entitled to regulate the
quality of medical care that patients receive.</TE>
<TE>   Zingale overruled the judge's decision -- which is his right under
state law -- saying it would have gutted the state's
patient-protection laws. The regulator did, however, drop the two
other patients from the case and lowered the fine to the original $1
million.</TE>
<TE>   Utterback's daughter, Terry Preston, led a crusade for four years
to hold Kaiser responsible. She never sued the HMO, preferring
instead for the state to send a message to all health plans with a
tough fine. She will not receive any of that money.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really just about saving lives," Preston said Friday.
"Now maybe they'll start considering people first before they start
cutting back."</TE>

<HD>'He Bashed My Head In,' Woman Says of Ex-Spouse</HD>
<DH>A Newbury Park accountant who was beaten in her home in
1999 testifies in civil trial. Lawyer for her ex-husband says there
is no evidence against him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Newbury Park accountant who was beaten in her home three years ago
identified her ex-husband in court Friday as the attacker who
bludgeoned her with a flashlight, leaving her brain-damaged and
partially paralyzed.</LD>
<LD>   Cradling her limp left arm as she sat before jurors in a
wheelchair, Linda Morrisset described her bitter divorce from
businessman Lee Mannheimer and testified that he tried to kill her
during a dispute over custody of their young son.</LD>
<LD>   "He bashed my head in," Morrisset said.</LD>
<TE>   She described him as a hostile and controlling bully who had
frightened her during their nine-year marriage.</TE>
<TE>   "He lost his temper a lot; he was always yelling. I was afraid of
him," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Morrisset's testimony launched what is expected to be an emotional
four-week civil trial in Ventura County Superior Court. She sued
Mannheimer two years ago for assault, battery and intentional
infliction of emotional distress.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit was filed after prosecutors declined to charge
Mannheimer in connection with the near-fatal Sept. 11, 1999, attack
on Morrisset in the hallway of her former home in the Santa Rosa
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   She was found lying in a pool of blood the next morning by a
family housekeeper.</TE>
<TE>   Morrisset, 51, identified Mannheimer, 59, as her attacker after
she awakened from a 16-day coma. Authorities arrested the Westlake
Village businessman on suspicion of attempted murder.</TE>
<TE>   But he was released after prosecutors decided there was not enough
evidence to file criminal charges. Investigators said the biggest
stumbling block was Morrisset's inability to fully recall the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Mannheimer was arrested in the assault partly because he had been
the focus of a federal murder-for-hire investigation involving his
wife in 1993. He was never arrested in the murder-for-hire case,
however, and Superior Court Judge Henry Walsh has limited how much
jurors in this trial will hear about it.</TE>
<TE>   Although the 1999 assault case remains unsolved, Morrisset said
she is certain her former spouse did it.</TE>
<TE>   During opening statements, attorney Allen Ball said that evidence
will show Mannheimer wanted his ex-wife dead and entered her home in
the fall of 1999 to accomplish his goal.</TE>
<TE>   In his opening statement, Mannheimer's attorney, Greg Ramirez,
said that there is no evidence linking his client to the assault.</TE>
<TE>   The current suit is one of several filed by the divorced couple
after the 1999 attack.</TE>

<CX>   Murder-for-hire probe -- A story in the Nov. 16 California section
erroneously reported that Westlake Village businessman Lee Mannheimer
was the focus of a federal murder-for-hire investigation in 1993. In
fact, it was state and local investigators who conducted the inquiry,

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Such a deal: On the subject of employment, Dani Wawrzenski of
Palos Verdes Estates came upon a pizza company's flier, which
consisted of various dinner specials as well as one "free" offer (see
accompanying). What a concept! You go to work for a company and they
pay you -- you don't have to pay them!</TE>

<TE>   Playing chicken with the CHP: On the Web site of the California
Highway Patrol, Vince Stickel came across a dramatic series of
dispatches about an intruder at the CHP's L.A. Communications Center
(see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Reading from bottom to top, Stickel provided this translation:
"There is a live chicken in the north end of the communications
center parking lot."</TE>
<TE>   "Would someone please take some chicken food out there?"</TE>
<TE>   "Can we please get Animal Control started for the dangerous
chicken?"</TE>
<TE>   "Unable to locate on the chicken -- LACC parking lot is secure."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Such street sorrow: The day after Halloween, I believe, is now
considered the start of the holiday shopping season (or is it the day
after the Fourth of July?). Anyway, Rod Samonte of Burbank snapped a
shot of a sign over a Pasadena parking garage that pretty much sums
up what traffic is going to be like as Christmas approaches (see
photo).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chew on this: The police log of the Los Alamitos News-Enterprise
said that a woman took her boyfriend's "$1,000 pair of dentures
during an argument."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More food for thought: A customer who had just emerged from the
bathroom of a pizza shop "said one of the stall dividers fell on him
and [he] wanted a free pizza," reported the Saddleback Valley News in
Mission Viejo. The manager agreed to the deal. You know how
mollifying mozzarella can be.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: The "Free Job" photo reminded me of the scene in
"What's New Pussycat?" in which Woody Allen mentions to Peter O'Toole
that he works in a striptease parlor in Paris. How much is the pay?
O'Toole asks him. Allen mentions some small amount, $50 a week or so.
Not much, O'Toole comments. Allen replies that it's all he can
afford.</TE>

<HD>Wild About Taming Mustangs</HD>
<DH>Instructor at desert ranch boot camp teaches people how to
'gentle' the animals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Hymon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Standing in the dining room of Lifesavers Ranch in the Mojave Desert
east of Lancaster, a horseman is explaining what motivates a wild
mustang.</LD>
<LD>   "A horse," Jerry Tindell says, "gains its courage by being
afraid."</LD>
<LD>   Tindell's audience is made up of about 20 horse owners and
prospective owners who have gathered for mustang boot camp on this
brilliant autumn day. The purpose of the camp is to help people
befriend and tame animals that until recently were among the biggest,
fastest and most formidable wild creatures still running loose in
America.</LD>
<TE>   Tindell tells how the constant vigilance that enabled the mustangs
to survive in the wild makes them standoffish and fearful around
people who adopt and try to domesticate them. Often, the horses are
not easily ridden -- assuming that their owners are lucky enough to
get a saddle on them.</TE>
<TE>   One woman tells Tindell that she often can't get near her horse. A
man complains that his mustang only wants to mope about and act like
a "lawn ornament." Another woman says her otherwise courageous
mustang turns into a terrified ninny around her baby girl.</TE>
<TE>   Tindell listens sympathetically and then takes the class outside
to a dusty corral, where an edgy mustang named Wimpy waits. Wimpy was
long ago gentled -- today's politically correct term for broken. But
Tindell still asks everyone to back several feet away from the
corral's iron fence, lest Wimpy defy his name and begin kicking.</TE>
<TE>   In the language of pop culture, Tindell is known as a horse
whisperer, but he prefers to be called a horseman. A resident of
nearby Hesperia, he was hired by Jill Starr, the director of
Lifesavers Ranch, to teach at the boot camp because of his ability to
firmly but gently persuade stubborn horses to do exactly what he
wants them to do.</TE>
<TE>   Tindell has the air of a man who grew up around horses, which he
did. He likes to joke that he didn't begin riding until he was 6
weeks old because his mother was overprotective. Everything he does
reeks of confidence. Using subtle pulls on the rope, eye contact and
voice commands, he quickly has Wimpy trotting tight circles around
him.</TE>
<TE>   "Sadly, most of the people who adopt the mustangs are first-time
horse owners," Tindell says later. "But people fall in love with
them. The problem is it's like taking a deer home and putting it in
your living room and turning on the lights. Man, what a wreck!"</TE>
<TE>   There are about 40,000 mustangs living today in the remote deserts
and mountains of 10 Western states. They usually travel in small
bands commanded by a stallion, are notoriously shy and, in many of
their haunts, seldom seen.</TE>
<TE>   The mustangs are, in fact, descendants of the Old West. Their
ancestors were released to the wild, mostly in the late 1800s and
early 1900s, by an assortment of people and groups, including the
U.S. Cavalry, Native American tribes, miners, homesteaders and those
who no longer needed them or who couldn't afford to keep them.</TE>
<TE>   The horses breed prolifically, and they have no natural predators.
To keep their population in check, the U.S. Bureau of Land
Management, which oversees the public lands where most of the horses
live, removes thousands of the mustangs from the wild each year --
11,764 in 2001 -- and puts them up for public adoption. This is done
to reduce overgrazing on land expected to provide forage for cattle
and wildlife such as deer, elk and antelope.</TE>
<TE>   The bureau often, but not always, finds good homes for the
mustangs. Some owners are abusive. Others get frustrated with the
training process and sell their horses. Because there is little
demand for the mustangs, they are sometimes auctioned to
slaughterhouses catering to an overseas market in horse meat.</TE>
<TE>   Jill Starr founded Lifesavers Ranch to save as many of the horses
as she could from the slaughterhouse. Weary of city life and a job in
the music industry in Los Angeles, she said, she drained her pension
fund and bought the 16.5-acre spread in 1993. After Wimpy, then a
mistreated mustang, fell into her hands, she established the ranch as
a nonprofit sanctuary for abused wild horses.</TE>
<TE>   Starr hears about neglected mustangs from friends of friends or
through a network of wild-horse activists. She frequently travels the
horse auction circuit around the Southwest, leaving the ranch with a
trailer that rarely returns home empty.</TE>
<TE>   If the horses she acquires are relatively healthy, she will try to
find them new homes. If not, she lets them live out their lives in a
series of corrals she calls her geriatric row. There are usually a
dozen or so mustangs on the ranch along with wild burros, quarter
horses and draft horses she couldn't resist helping.</TE>
<TE>   "We can only save so many horses, because we only have so much
space here, and we're limited by staff and money," Starr says. "One
thing we can do is hold these boot camps so that people who adopted
the mustangs can keep them."</TE>
<TE>   As Starr speaks, Tindell prowls the corral, where there is no
shortage of misunderstandings going on between horse and human. The
students have spread out, each leading a horse by a rope. With mixed
success, they're trying to persuade the horses to move right, move
left, circle and accept a halter.</TE>
<TE>   One woman digs in and tugs on a rope, trying to get her palomino
to step forward. It stands its ground and tugs back. Hard.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, Dick Blizzard, a general contractor from Palmdale, is
faring better. He is, Starr thinks, still a little stiff, but his
chestnut mustang Geronimo is cooperating with his every request.</TE>
<TE>   Geronimo is Blizzard's second adopted mustang. He acquired the
horses during what he calls his midlife crisis -- "they're my red
Corvette" -- with his goal being to use them on camping trips into
the Sierra wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   But before he can mount one horse, load the other with 150 pounds
of supplies, and ride up steep mountain trails, Blizzard needs to
make sure neither of his steeds starts bucking each time it sees
something that's new to it.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Blizzard finishes boot camp by guiding Geronimo
through an obstacle course that includes plastic streamers hanging
from poles and wobbly wooden ramps. The point is to have Geronimo
follow Blizzard as he would a stallion in the wilds -- as the mustang
encounters things utterly foreign to him.</TE>
<TE>   Geronimo passes with flying colors, fear having melted into trust.</TE>

<HD>Actor Arrested on Obscenity Charge</HD>
<DH>'Pee-wee Herman' surrenders following probe in which his
art collection was seized.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Winton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Actor Paul Reubens, better known as "Pee-wee Herman," was arrested
and charged Friday with misdemeanor possession of obscene material
improperly depicting a child following a yearlong investigation by
the Los Angeles Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   Reubens, 50, who gained tabloid notoriety after he pleaded no
contest to misdemeanor indecent exposure in connection with a 1991
arrest in a Florida adult movie theater, surrendered to the LAPD. He
was booked at the Hollywood Division station and released on $20,000
bail.</LD>
<LD>   The arrest comes a day after actor Jeffrey Jones, whose roles have
included the principal in "Ferris Bueller's Day Off," was booked on a
more serious felony count of using a teenage boy in sexually oriented
pictures or films and misdemeanor possession of child pornography.</LD>
<TE>   An LAPD investigation into Reubens and Jones began last year after
a 17-year-old boy made a complaint to authorities. Police said
Reubens was booked based on evidence gathered by detectives last
November when they served a search warrant at his Hollywood Hills
home and seized his large art collection, which includes erotic
images. Investigators also seized Reubens' personal computers.</TE>
<TE>   Blair Berk, Reubens' attorney, said the misdemeanor charge is
"untrue and without merit." Reubens, she said, "has never at any time
knowingly possessed any artwork from his extensive vintage and
antique art collection even remotely related to anything improper."</TE>
<TE>   District attorney spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said the office
determined that the evidence seized did not warrant a felony
prosecution and referred the matter to the Los Angeles city
attorney's office, which prosecutes misdemeanor offenses.</TE>
<TE>   City attorney spokesman Ana Garcia said the criminal complaint
filed against Reubens charges him with misdemeanor possession of
material depicting a child under the age of 18 engaged in sexual
conduct as defined by California state law.</TE>

<HD>Marlton Square Project Gets the Go-Ahead</HD>
<DH>Council unanimously backs southwest L.A. development,
despite some reservations on the city commitment to $38.5-million
subsidy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The City Council approved the Marlton Square shopping and residential
development in southwest Los Angeles on Friday despite reservations
by some members about the city's commitment of $38.5 million in
public subsidies to the project.</LD>
<LD>   The heads of the NAACP's and Urban League's Los Angeles chapters,
as well as Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) were among
the three dozen supporters of the project urging the council to act
against blight in the Crenshaw/Baldwin Hills area.</LD>
<LD>   Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, whose district includes the project
and who is leaving the City Council this month for the state
Assembly, called Marlton Square "a significant step forward for both
economic development and economic justice."</LD>
<TE>   The $123.1-million development on 22 acres -- including the
run-down, 1950s-era San Fernando Plaza shopping center -- would
feature 140 detached, single-family homes, 180 units of rental
housing for low-income seniors and 140,000 square feet of retail
space.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn praised the council for acting on Marlton
Square, which has been his top economic development priority. "Not
only will this project eliminate blight from this neighborhood, it
will build an entire mixed-income, mixed-use community," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The property, just west of the Baldwin Hills Shopping Center on
the south side of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, has been targeted
for redevelopment for more than a decade, according to John Mack,
president of the Urban League's Los Angeles chapter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a long, hard struggle, but it means so much," he said.
"It has potential for economic impact on an area of this city in
great need. It provides great hope."</TE>
<TE>   The project has taken on a high profile because supporters say it
is a vital part of revitalizing South Los Angeles and because of the
developer's political campaign contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Developer Christopher Hammond, his firm Capital Vision Equities,
its employees and their family members contributed tens of thousands
of dollars to Hahn's anti-secession campaign and Ridley-Thomas'
Assembly race.</TE>
<TE>   The firm also hired the former chief of the city's Community
Redevelopment Agency to help push the project through.</TE>
<TE>   The council voted unanimously to approve the financing plan and
authorize negotiation of a development agreement, but members Nate
Holden and Cindy Miscikowski voiced reservations about the financing.
The proposal would commit 20 years' worth of federal anti-poverty
Community Development Block Grant funds to make the development
pencil out.</TE>
<TE>   Asserting that the use of such funds for a private mall would be a
change in city policy, Holden said projects in his district had been
turned down for similar public financing.</TE>
<TE>   He described such subsidies as "a gift of public funds under the
guise of doing a good project for the community."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to vote for this," Holden said, "but when my projects
come up in my district, I want the same consideration from my
colleagues."</TE>
<TE>   Miscikowski complained that the project had bypassed the normal
process of review and negotiation by the CRA and that the developer
had not submitted a letter of credit or other financial commitments
to the private portion of the funding.</TE>
<TE>   Without firmer commitments, the project could jeopardize the
scarce block grant funds that are already insufficient to finance all
the city projects underway, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are putting aside and holding $38 million of public money,
including money that has already been committed in [Community
Development Block Grants] to other projects," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The councilwoman added that the CRA usually requires a financial
commitment before city funds are provided.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Eric Garcetti sought to address concerns about using
block grant money by amending the council action to ask that other
funds, whenever possible, be used instead.</TE>
<TE>   However, Chief Legislative Analyst Ron Deaton said no other funds
have been identified.</TE>
<TE>   "There never is a development that is perfect," Garcetti said.
"But this is the right project to do."</TE>

<HD>Siphoning of Payments for Homes Alleged</HD>
<DH>A developer who left Altadena project unfinished is
suspected of paying off his bills with money that buyers gave him for
upgrades.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. Reza</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County developer who left several housing tracts in
Southern California unfinished is under investigation for allegedly
using money received for home upgrades to pay off his company's bills
instead.</LD>
<LD>   Records filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court show that
Timothy N. Roberts, a Villa Park resident, is the subject of a probe
into allegations of grand theft, fraud and illegal diversion of funds
intended for the homes at La Vina Estates in Altadena.</LD>
<LD>   A search warrant affidavit said investigators are trying to
determine the amount involved.</LD>
<TE>   A nine-page statement filed Oct. 28 by Los Angeles County district
attorney investigator Peter A. Parsons said a former salesperson who
worked for Roberts at La Vina told investigators "there were no funds
to complete the building project because Roberts was stealing the
money." A former business partner of Roberts' also told investigators
that Roberts "stole" money from the La Vina project, court records
show.</TE>
<TE>   According to court documents, Roberts told investigators: "There
was a lot of stealing from Paul to pay Peter that went on," but he
denied using the money for his own purposes. A prosecution statement
alleges that Roberts diverted funds to cover expenses, corporate
overhead, contractors and payroll.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts declined to comment Friday. Parsons, the lead investigator
in the Los Angeles County case, said only that Roberts "is under
criminal investigation."</TE>
<TE>   At issue is money that buyers paid up front for improvements to
their new homes when they signed contracts with Roberts' company,
Compass Homes. The upgrades included tile work, kitchen appliances
and cabinets. Investigators believe Roberts collected hundreds of
thousands of dollars or more for the upgrades. The funds were
supposed to remain impounded for that purpose.</TE>
<TE>   But according to one example in Parsons' affidavit, Roberts
diverted $108,949 given to him by home buyers to accounts his company
had at three Orange County banks. The money was supposed to have been
deposited at Orange Coast Title and Escrow to pay for upgrades to the

<HD>Ruling Due on Trial of Girl in Killing of Actor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 15-year-old girl in custody in connection with the murder of
television and film actor Merlin Santana has been ordered to return
to court Dec. 10, when a judge will determine if she should be tried
as a juvenile or an adult.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities believe the teenager was the driver of a car used in
the shooting and not the one who pulled the trigger, a district
attorney's office spokeswoman said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Sandi Gibbons said the Juvenile Court petition against the girl,
who also is charged with attempted murder, alleges that "a principal
was armed with a rifle," which means authorities believe someone
other than the girl actually did the shooting.</LD>
<TE>   Police were still looking for two adult suspects Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The teenager's identity has not been released.</TE>
<TE>   Santana, 26, best known for his role as Romeo Santana on TV's "The
Steve Harvey Show," was shot last Saturday as he sat in a parked car
with a friend in the 3800 block of Victoria Avenue in South Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The friend, who was not hurt, drove to Crenshaw and Exposition
boulevards and flagged down a police car. Santana died at the scene,
according to Los Angeles Police Lt. Clay Farrell.</TE>
<TE>   The New York-born Santana, whose parents emigrated from the
Dominican Republic, had appeared with Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro
in the film "Showtime," released earlier this year.</TE>

<HD>Airport Screener Curb Is Rejected</HD>
<DH>Federal judge issues an injunction barring the U.S. from
enforcing a citizenship requirement. But most of the jobs have
already been filled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Weinstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal district court judge in Los Angeles on Friday barred the
U.S. government from enforcing a post-Sept. 11 law that permits only
American citizens to work as airport screeners.</LD>
<LD>   However, the ruling will have no immediate impact on staffing at
Los Angeles International Airport or hundreds of other airports
around the country, since most jobs created by the law already have
been filled by U.S. citizens.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi issued his ruling -- which
ultimately could affect eligibility for screening jobs at every
airport in the nation -- in response to a lawsuit filed in January by
the American Civil Liberties Union.</LD>
<TE>   Takasugi rejected a request from Justice Department attorneys that
he stay his decision to issue a preliminary injunction pending an
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an extremely important ruling," said ACLU lawyer Ben
Wizner, who represented the plaintiffs, eight permanent resident
aliens and one man from American Samoa, who held jobs as screeners at
LAX and San Francisco International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   "Our hope is that a strong statement from a federal judge" that
the law's constitutionality is dubious "will encourage Congress to
reconsider" the hiring restriction, Wizner said.</TE>
<TE>   Some members of Congress already have suggested amending the
Aviation and Transportation Security Act, but no action has been
taken.</TE>
<TE>   One proposal would make individuals from American trust
territories eligible for screening jobs. One of the plaintiffs is
from such a territory -- American Samoa -- and Justice Department
attorney Elizabeth Shapiro cited the potential change in the law in
urging Takasugi not to grant the injunction.</TE>
<TE>   Both Shapiro and U.S. Transportation Security Agency spokesman
Robert R. Johnson said they would make no comment on a possible
appeal until they had studied the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in the process of beginning to review the decision and
decide what the next steps will be," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department spokeswoman Barbara Comstock said that because
the suit has not been certified as a class action, "the injunction
does not apply nationwide, but only to the plaintiffs in this case."</TE>
<TE>   The ACLU suit contends that the citizenship restriction in the
Aviation Transportation and Security Act, enacted last November, is a
violation of constitutional equal protection rights.</TE>
<TE>   ACLU lawyers also assert that the section of the act is
"irrational" and could weaken airport security by removing thousands
of experienced employees from the system.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department attorneys replied in briefs and in court Friday
that there were legal precedents granting the government authority to
restrict certain jobs to citizens.</TE>
<TE>   They also argued that the plaintiffs had made no showing that they
would be irreparably harmed if the injunction was not granted.
Moreover, government lawyers contended that restricting the screening
jobs to citizens would help restore confidence in airline security.</TE>
<TE>   "That is the same mentality that led to the internment of Japanese
Americans during World War II," said Mark Rosenbaum, legal director
of the ACLU of Southern California, after Friday's hearing.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the ACLU attorneys stressed in a brief, "no
government report has ever identified the citizenship or nationality
of screeners as having any connection to deficiencies in aviation
security."</TE>
<TE>   The suit also emphasized that there is no citizenship requirement
for airline pilots, flight attendants, baggage handlers or National
Guard troops stationed at airports to enhance security after the
Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Takasugi, who earlier this week denied a government motion to
dismiss the suit, disagreed with the government on all major issues.</TE>
<TE>   In that decision, the judge acknowledged that "improving aviation
security is a compelling governmental interest."</TE>
<TE>   However, he said, Justice Department lawyers had not demonstrated
that "categorical exclusion of all noncitizens from employment as
screeners is the least restrictive means" to achieve that interest.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, Takasugi said in his order Friday, the plaintiffs
have "sufficiently alleged a constitutional deprivation to warrant a
finding of irreparable harm."</TE>
<TE>   Irreparable harm is a critical element a plaintiff must
demonstrate in order to obtain a preliminary injunction. The other is
the likelihood that the plaintiff will ultimately win the case.</TE>
<TE>   A judge also normally considers whether the balance of hardship
favors the plaintiffs, and in some instances whether the public
interest will be advanced by granting the injunction.</TE>
<TE>   Takasugi said Friday that granting the preliminary injunction
would simply "maintain the status quo" pending an ultimate
determination of the law's constitutionality.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Takasugi said, "Because the termination of
plaintiffs' employment could constitute a constitutional deprivation,
the public interest will be advanced by granting the preliminary
relief."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, before Takasugi ruled, thousands of noncitizen
screeners lost their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   When the suit was filed, about 25% of the 28,000 pre-boarding
screeners at U.S. airports were permanent resident aliens rather than
citizens.</TE>
<TE>   At some airports, the percentage of noncitizens was far higher --
about 40% at LAX and more than 50% in San Francisco, Sacramento,
Miami and Washington Dulles.</TE>
<TE>   The government set a deadline of Nov. 19 for all screeners
employed by the newly created Transportation Security Agency to be
citizens, with the exception of five airports where there is a pilot
program to use private contractors under the supervision of the TSA.</TE>
<TE>   Those five airports are in San Francisco, Kansas City, Mo.,
Rochester, N.Y., Tupelo, Miss., and Jackson Hole, Wyo.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, TSA spokesman Johnson said it was his understanding
that all the new jobs had been filled, with the possible exception of
positions at the airports with the pilot programs.</TE>
<TE>   A source at LAX said that Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta
plans to hold a news conference Monday to announce that the deadline
has been met.</TE>
<TE>   LAX hired its 1,600 screeners by Nov. 5, giving it the largest
passenger screening force among the nation's 429 commercial airports.</TE>
<TE>   ACLU attorney Wizner said four plaintiffs who work at San
Francisco still have their jobs. He said the ACLU would work
diligently to help them keep their posts in light of Friday's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   As a practical matter, if the decision is not reversed,
noncitizens who are permanent residents will be eligible to apply for
screener jobs in the future, not that they are guaranteed of getting
jobs, Wizner said.</TE>
<TE>   The decision was hailed by the Service Employees International
Union, which represents 2,000 airport screeners and was a party to
the suit.</TE>
<TE>   "The citizenship requirement was out of tune with basic American
values and didn't do anything to make airports safer," said Eliseo
Medina, the union's executive vice president.</TE>

<HD>Sign Directs Sister Cities to Diplomatic Soap Opera</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Massie Ritsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn flies off today on a trade trip to
Asia, a downtown sign pointing toward L.A.'s sister cities could
serve as his compass. That sign, however, has already threatened to
knock the mayor's diplomacy off course.</LD>
<LD>   At 1st and Main streets, a stone's throw from City Hall, the
oversized street sign indicates the directions and distances of Los
Angeles' 20 sister municipalities. When the marker went up in
September, officials at the Chinese Consulate were incensed that one
arm pointed toward "Taipei, Taiwan."</LD>
<LD>   The implication that Taiwan is a nation contradicts the United
States' "one China" policy -- to say nothing of the view of the
People's Republic of China that the island is a renegade province.</LD>
<TE>   "We expressed our concerns very quickly, shall we say," said
consulate spokesman Lai Po.</TE>
<TE>   To Taiwan's local diplomats, the sign looked fine.</TE>
<TE>   They appreciated L.A.'s "friendly gesture" toward their capital
city, said Chung-Chen Kung, deputy director general of the Taipei
Economic and Cultural Office.</TE>
<TE>   Caught in the middle of this international incident was Councilman
Tom LaBonge, who had been behind the creation of the 32-foot Sister
City Monument. He got the idea after watching an old "Road" movie,
starring Bob Hope and Bing Crosby."It's very exciting to see so many
people turn their necks to see the sign ... but I didn't realize the
challenges that exist between the people" of Taiwan and mainland
China, LaBonge said. "Everybody's very passionate."</TE>
<TE>   LaBonge asked the U.S. State Department for advice.</TE>
<TE>   At dinner this week, he consulted the visiting mayor of Berlin,
another L.A. sister. The councilman also talked to Sister Cities
International, the Washington organization that matches cities to
improve relations.</TE>
<TE>   The group often sorts out seemingly small disputes between China
and the island formerly called Formosa, said Cynthia Maka, Sister
Cities' director for Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese delegates have stormed out of the organization's
conferences at the sight of Taiwan's flag, and the Taiwanese have
registered their own share of complaints.</TE>
<TE>   To keep the decorative street sign from distracting Hahn on his
10-day tourism-and-trade mission, a rush order was put in to alter
the sign.</TE>
<TE>   By Thursday it matched the policy of the United States and Sister
Cities International:</TE>
<TE>   "Taipei Municipality, Taiwan, China."</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese were pleased. But to the Taiwanese, suddenly the sign
was "not a very good gesture," Kung said.</TE>
<TE>   "We will not intervene -- we are not a Communist regime," he said.
So Hahn will still be welcomed Nov. 26 in Taipei.</TE>
<TE>   But Los Angeles should know that bowing to pressure from the
People's Republic "will create a very uncomfortable feeling for the
people living here who are originally from Taiwan," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles has sisters on every continent, and all 20 cities with
which it has such ties are listed on the downtown sign -- from Athens
to Mexico City, St. Petersburg to the Chinese port of Guangzhou,
formerly Canton.</TE>
<TE>   To please everyone in this latest dispute, Sister Cities' Maka
suggested that Los Angeles strike country names from its monument.</TE>
<TE>   More optimistically, she wondered whether the spat might present
an opportunity for L.A. to broker lasting peace between mainland
China and Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we can bring them together," she suggested, "to start
talking more -- in a safe place."</TE>
<TE>   For now, that place probably isn't at 1st and Main.</TE>

<HD>5 Held in Vandalism of Freeway Murals</HD>
<DH>CHP says the suspects are leaders of tagging crews that
compete to do the most damage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Reich</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five people suspected of doing more than $1 million in graffiti
damage, mainly to murals along Los Angeles freeways, have been
arrested on suspicion of felony vandalism, the CHP said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Bryan Acee, who is in charge of the California Highway Patrol's
graffiti task force, said the four men and one woman, all in their
20s, are leaders of so-called "krews" that have been competing with
one another to see which could do the most damage to specific murals,
such as one at 4th Street on the Harbor Freeway in downtown Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Some also are believed to be gang members, he said.</LD>
<TE>   As the six-week investigation proceeded, "we learned more and
more," Acee said. "The contests are to see which 'krew,' or crew, can
do the most damage to a specific mural in a limited time. The loser
then either has to go on to another mural or join the winners.
Mostly, it's older people, well beyond teenagers, who are the key
participants."</TE>
<TE>   Acee said that during the investigation, aided by the Los Angeles
and Redondo Beach police departments and the Los Angeles County
Probation Department, the taggers told him they got the paint from a
European paint company for free. In exchange, Acee said, the taggers
agreed to identify the company on the defaced murals. He would not
name the company, but said the paint was sold through the Internet
and has indelible characteristics that make it difficult to remove.</TE>
<TE>   Acee also would not identify the suspects, pending more arrests.
Two of them, he said, surrendered at the CHP office "so that we would
not go to their homes."</TE>
<TE>   CHP Officer Jeff Loftin said several murals had been damaged along
the Harbor and Hollywood freeways. Community parks along the Harbor
Freeway also were struck. The investigation included damage to
private property in Redondo Beach. Evidence taken during the arrests
included etching tools, aerosol paint cans, ammunition and narcotics.</TE>
<TE>   A private group, the Mural Conservancy of Los Angeles, has been
helping to restore the damaged murals. Conservancy President Bill
Lasarow said it also has been developing techniques to better protect
them.</TE>
<TE>   The state recently allocated $1.7 million to Caltrans' Los Angeles
district to restore and protect murals, Lasarow said.</TE>

<LD>A planned overhaul of the nation's bankruptcy laws was pronounced
dead Friday in the Senate, less than a day after House members voted
first to kill the bill, then to revive it in altered form.</LD>
<LD>   Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said the Senate would not
take up the measure in the final days of the lame-duck session
because the House had reneged on a delicately crafted compromise
involving abortion protesters.</LD>
<LD>   "The House Republicans killed bankruptcy for this year," Daschle
said. "It's as simple as that."</LD>
<TE>   The measure's demise demonstrated the ongoing political potency of
the abortion issue and its ability to add controversy to unrelated
issues. In this case, it drove a wedge into the ranks of Republicans
who favored virtually everything else in the bankruptcy bill.</TE>
<TE>   "Shame," said Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.),
lamenting that the bill had been derailed "over a two-paragraph
provision" that was tangential to its core.</TE>
<TE>   Banks and credit card companies have been pushing for years for
revisions in federal law to make it more difficult for consumers to
wipe away their financial obligations by filing for bankruptcy. A
record 1.4 million bankruptcy cases were filed last year, compared
with 298,000 in 1985, according to the American Financial Services
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would have made it more difficult for Americans to
eliminate their debts entirely in bankruptcy court. A new "means
test" would have required filers with the ability to repay at least a
portion of their debts to do so.</TE>
<TE>   The measure also would have cracked down on a legal loophole that
allows bankruptcy filers in several states to keep expensive homes.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer groups have vigorously opposed the measure, saying it
would enrich big lenders at the expense of cash-strapped borrowers.
They also faulted the bill for doing little to stem the proliferation
of credit cards, which they argued entice some consumers to assume
more debt than they should.</TE>
<TE>   A previous version of the legislation almost became law in 2000,
but President Clinton declined to sign it. This year's bill appeared
likely to make it over the top, until it became mired in the politics
of abortion.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democrats, led by Sen. Charles E. Schumer of New York, had
insisted on amending the bill to restrict protesters from using
bankruptcy filings to avoid paying court fines for blockades or other
illegal acts at abortion clinics. The provision was opposed by
antiabortion lawmakers, particularly House Republicans, who said it
would water down 1st Amendment rights for one group of protesters but
not others.</TE>
<TE>   After months of negotiations, congressional conferees agreed on
compromise language that would prohibit any protester blocking
legitimate businesses from using the bankruptcy law to avoid fines.</TE>
<TE>   The compromise was backed by GOP leaders. But a handful of
rank-and-file Republican House members still opposed it, arguing it
was clearly aimed at antiabortion activists who in the past have used
the bankruptcy law to avoid paying fines.</TE>
<TE>   In the narrowly divided House, the dispute was enough to shoot
down the bill when it reached the House floor Thursday afternoon. As
it became clear the measure lacked majority support, more than 80
Republicans broke ranks with their leaders on it. They joined with
Democrats, who opposed the measure as bad for consumers, to block
consideration of the bill, 243 to 172.</TE>
<TE>   The rebuff stunned representatives of the big banks and other
financial institutions who had lobbied hard -- and contributed
generously -- to get the bankruptcy bill enacted.</TE>
<TE>   As the House session extended into the early hours of Friday,
chastened GOP leaders tried to repair the rift with the financial
community by seeking House approval of a new version of the bill with
the abortion-related provision removed. The stripped-down legislation
was approved, 244 to 116, in a roll call that ended about 2 a.m.
(EST).</TE>
<TE>   Some Democrats, saying the bill would be dead on arrival in the
Senate without the abortion-related provision, derided the GOP
strategy as a "midnight stunt" designed to mend fences with angry
business supporters.</TE>
<TE>   And on Friday, Daschle said the amended bill would not see the
light of day in his chamber.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a compromise that was the product of virtually years of
work," Daschle said. "You had Republicans and Democrats who
recognized the fragile nature of this compromise, and yet the
Republicans defeated it."</TE>
<TE>   Daschle said he did not plan to bring up the bill for a floor vote
before the lame-duck session ends next week. Even if he did, "it
would never pass," Daschle said. "It would be subject to a
filibuster" by supporters of abortion-rights.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Thomas Carper (D-Del.) said that after talking with some of
his Democratic colleagues Friday, it was clear that bankruptcy reform
stood no chance of passage this year.</TE>
<TE>   Carper suggested that Senate Democrats engage in high-stakes
political poker with House Republicans by restoring the provision and
sending the bill back for another vote. But he said his Democratic
colleagues thought that impractical, with most House members having
left town, probably for the year.</TE>
<TE>   The sequence of events was hailed by antiabortion advocates, but
left bankruptcy reform advocates downcast.</TE>
<TE>   "This vote proves that politics makes strange bedfellows," said
Roberta Combs, president of the Christian Coalition of America. She
noted that Democrats, including many abortion-rights advocates, had
joined with GOP abortion foes "in providing the pro-life movement
with one of its most stunning congressional victories."</TE>
<TE>   American Financial Services Assn. spokesman Tom Lehner lamented
the bill's failure. "It just sets a terrible precedent that
conference reports agreed upon by House and Senate negotiators can be
derailed by those who don't support what's in them," he said.</TE>

<LD>NASA delayed the launching of space shuttle Endeavour until late next
week, giving engineers more time to evaluate two potential problems.</LD>
<LD>   Endeavour was to leave on its mission to the international space
station last Monday, but the countdown was halted because of a leak
in the astronauts' oxygen supply system.</LD>
<LD>   While replacing the leaky hose, workers accidentally knocked a
platform into the shuttle robot arm. The arm was scraped, and tests
were ordered to determine whether the damage was more than skin deep.</LD>

<HD>Congress Passes Bill to Create Commission on Terrorist
Attacks</HD>
<DH>President's signature is expected. The panel, called for by
victims' families, will report on failures leading to 9/11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>An oft-delayed bill establishing a new commission to examine last
year's terrorist attacks won final congressional approval Friday and
will soon become law.</LD>
<LD>   The creation of the commission ensures a continued focus on the
intelligence and policy failures that preceded the brazen,
destructive strikes against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon
on Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   The commission is modeled after similar panels that investigated
the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy. Advocates hope it will take a broader and
deeper look at the government's pre-Sept. 11 lapses than inquiries by
Congress and the Bush administration.</LD>
<TE>   The legislation was championed by Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman
(D-Conn.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.), as well as many other lawmakers
sympathetic to the persistent demands for an outside probe from many
families of those killed on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Different versions of the bill won huge majorities in the House
and Senate earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush initially resisted the proposal, saying a
commission could prove to be little more than a distraction to his
war on terror.</TE>
<TE>   Later, though, he embraced the legislation and molded it to his
liking. The final bill, for instance, lets the president name the
chairman of the 10-member panel.</TE>
<TE>   The House approved the final bill early Friday. Hours later, the
Senate gave its unanimous consent. The bill, which Bush is expected
to sign, was attached to annual intelligence legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's long overdue," said Kristen Breitweiser of New Jersey, whose
husband, Ronald, was killed in the collapse of the Trade Center and
who is active in a network of victims' families. "We worked almost a
year trying to get this done."</TE>
<TE>   She said she hoped the commission would focus on how the
government can prevent further attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "My husband's dead; he's not coming back. What I want the
commission to do is plug the holes, fix the problems, so that I know
my daughter and I are safe," Breitweiser said.</TE>
<TE>   The 10 members of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks
Upon the United States would be evenly divided among Republicans and
Democrats. The chairman would serve with a vice chairman named by
congressional Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   The commission will be empowered to issue subpoenas upon agreement
of the chairman and vice chairman or a majority of members.</TE>
<TE>   The panel would examine such areas as intelligence failures,
funding of terrorist networks, diplomacy, immigration policies and
aviation security.</TE>
<TE>   It is to report findings and recommendations to the president and
Congress after 18 months.</TE>

<HD>Homeland Security Measure Dominates in Senate Session</HD>
<DH>In voting to force action on bill, 17 Democrats join 47
Republicans and one independent to thwart filibusters. Final vote is
set for next week.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate voted decisively Friday to force final action on a major
homeland security bill, but Democrats charged that the fine print
contained needless breaks for drug companies, airport security
screeners, offshore tax evaders and even Texas A&amp;M University.</LD>
<LD>   Republicans warned that a Democratic amendment to block those
provisions could kill the bill, which President Bush made the top
priority for the lame-duck Congress.</LD>
<LD>   And in other developments on legislation concerning terrorism, the
Senate cleared for Bush's signature a bill establishing an
independent commission to look into government breakdowns exposed by
last year's terrorist attacks. It also scheduled a final vote for
next week on a bill that would give the insurance industry support in
the event of future terrorist strikes.</LD>
<TE>   But what held center stage Friday was the bill to authorize
creation of a Department of Homeland Security.</TE>
<TE>   First, the Senate voted, 65 to 29, to force action on the bill,
and scheduled a final vote for next week on the most significant
government reorganization in more than 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   In the preliminary vote -- a victory for the Bush administration
-- 17 Democrats joined 47 Republicans and one independent to thwart
any filibusters. California's senators, both Democrats, were divided:
Dianne Feinstein supported the president's position; Barbara Boxer
opposed it.</TE>
<TE>   Then, sharp debate erupted over details in the 484-page homeland
security bill that had received little notice before the House
approved it Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, assembled by White House and congressional negotiators
last weekend, spells out the structure and duties of a new Cabinet
department projected to have roughly 170,000 employees drawn from 22
federal agencies. The largest among them are the Coast Guard, the
Transportation Security Administration, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service and the Customs Service.</TE>
<TE>   But the bill also contains seven GOP-favored provisions that have
drawn scathing attacks from Democrats. Three of those concern
liability protections for businesses.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, drug companies that make mercury-based vaccine
preservatives would win special protection under language inserted in
the bill for the first time within the last week.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic Sens. Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Joseph I.
Lieberman of Connecticut said the provision would undermine pending
lawsuits that allege such preservatives have caused autism in
children.</TE>
<TE>   GOP Sens. Bill Frist of Tennessee and Phil Gramm of Texas
countered that their goal was to help ensure that drug companies
would be able to supply products useful for protecting people against
biological terrorism attacks. Vaccines have been a focus of
government planning for defense against attacks of smallpox and other
deadly agents.</TE>
<TE>   The administration also weighed in. White House spokesman Scott
McClellan said the vaccine provision would not bar parents or others
from suing vaccine makers. Rather, it would require them to seek
compensation first through an out-of-court award program, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We support [the provision's] being in the legislation," McClellan
told reporters. "That's our position. And we urge Congress to act and
get this legislation to the president's desk quickly."</TE>
<TE>   The two other liability-limiting provisions would authorize the
homeland security secretary to grant legal protection to businesses
that sell certain "anti-terrorism technologies," and would provide a
similar shield to airport security companies. Those provisions,
though, were not entirely new. Similar language was approved by the
House in July.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats also objected to four other provisions, which they said
would:</TE>
<TE>   * Shield the new department from certain open-government laws;</TE>
<TE>   * Create barriers to the issuance of emergency security rules for
airlines and railroads;</TE>
<TE>   * Neutralize a Senate-approved measure to bar government contracts
with corporations that have moved their headquarters offshore to
avoid U.S. taxes; and</TE>
<TE>   * Give Texas A&amp;M the inside track for a government-funded homeland
security research center.</TE>
<TE>   The university is not mentioned in the bill by name. But Democrats
said the criteria for the center spelled out in the bill pointed
directly to A&amp;M.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's take out all this terrible special-interest legislation
that has nothing to do with homeland security," Daschle said.</TE>
<TE>   Gramm defended most of the targeted provisions as measures that
would help ensure efficient government. The provision concerning the
research center, he conceded, was somewhat less defensible.</TE>
<TE>   But the former A&amp;M economics professor insisted that the
university in his home state was only one of several -- including the
University of California -- that could land the center.</TE>
<TE>   Gramm also said he was not personally responsible for the
language. Its authorship, like that of many of the provisions in the
bill, was not clear. But several key Texas Republicans in the House
had a hand in drafting the overhaul bill, including Majority Leader
Dick Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay.</TE>
<TE>   Texas A&amp;M also houses the presidential library of former President
Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic amendment to block the provisions -- also scheduled
for a vote next week -- is significant not only for the substance of
the issues involved. It also matters a great deal procedurally, which
is why Republicans warn that the bill could be imperiled.</TE>
<TE>   The reason is that the House may decide not to approve changes
made to the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Constitution, both houses of Congress must approve
identical legislative language before a bill may be sent to the
president.</TE>
<TE>   The House sent the Senate its bill, then left Washington after
wrapping up work early Friday. Most House members believe the chamber
is done for the year, though it will meet next week -- in a session
expected to be sparsely attended -- for routine business. Whether
lawmakers can be called back to Washington for a vote on Senate
revisions to the homeland security bill is unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democrats said any revisions could be waved through the
House on a voice vote because that chamber has approved two versions
of the bill this year by wide margins.</TE>
<TE>   "Would the House let it die?" asked Sen. John B. Breaux (D-La.).
"I don't think so."</TE>
<TE>   However, John Feehery, a spokesman for Speaker J. Dennis Hastert
(R-Ill.), said the House would be unlikely to send such a major bill
to Bush without a recorded vote of its members. Senate amendments,
Feehery said, could kill the bill.</TE>

<HD>Skin Warning for Painkiller Issued</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>People who develop a rash upon taking a new painkiller called Bextra
should immediately stop the drug because it has been linked to some
rare but life-threatening skin diseases, federal health officials
warned Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The Food and Drug Administration has about 20 reports of serious
reactions -- including the skin diseases Stevens-Johnson syndrome,
toxic epidermal necrolysis and exfoliative dermatitis, as well as
allergic reactions -- among Bextra users since sales began in March.</LD>
<LD>   The FDA estimates that 800,000 to 1 million people had recently
begun taking Bextra when the reactions were reported. The immune
system-linked skin disorders are thought to be more likely during the
first few weeks of a drug's use than after the body becomes
accustomed to the medicine.</LD>
<TE>   Still, because those skin conditions are so rare, the FDA was
surprised to see even that small cluster reported during Bextra's
first year of sales. The conditions can be life-threatening, and some
patients were hospitalized.</TE>
<TE>   Bextra treats arthritis and menstrual pain by reducing
inflammation.</TE>

<HD>Unions See 'Hostility' in Bush Federal Jobs Plan</HD>
<DH>His privatization proposal is called offensive and the
bidding process unfair.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Cleeland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration's initiative to privatize thousands of
federal jobs was widely viewed by labor leaders Friday as part of an
aggressive campaign to weaken unions, a move they said has been
emboldened by recent Democratic electoral losses.</LD>
<LD>   "This is yet another indication of the administration's hostility
toward labor, and an especially blatant one for government
employees," said Bill Samuel, political director of the AFL-CIO.</LD>
<LD>   The White House announced plans Thursday to put as many as 850,000
federal jobs out to competitive bid under rules that the largest
government workers' union said clearly favored private contractors.</LD>
<TE>   Combined with the administration's insistence on diluting civil
service protections in the proposed Homeland Security Department and
its intervention in the ongoing labor dispute at West Coast ports,
the plan struck labor leaders as an indication of troubling things to
come.</TE>
<TE>   "The attacks on unions weren't so overt over the last two years,"
said Bruce Raynor, president of the garment workers union UNITE.
"This is an act of war."</TE>
<TE>   White House spokeswoman Clare Buchan said the administration had
no anti-union agenda and was merely looking for ways to reduce
government costs. She noted that union firms are free to compete for
government contracts under the privatization plan. "The proposal is
part of the president's management initiative, which is aimed at
making government more effective and more cost-efficient for the
American people," she said.</TE>
<TE>   As far as the president's overall relationship with labor, Buchan
said: "We will work with anyone who wants to work constructively and
in a bipartisan way to advance the president's agenda."</TE>
<TE>   The AFL-CIO, a national federation of unions that represents 13
million members, doesn't see things that way. On its Web site, it
catalogs nearly 100 antilabor actions taken by the Bush
administration -- from the repeal of ergonomics rules to tax cuts it
claims unfairly benefit the wealthy. The federation has objected to
scores of Bush appointees, including his first two picks for
secretary of Labor and the Labor Department's top lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   And then there is the personal. AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney
has never met with President Bush -- a slight that federation
spokeswoman Denise Mitchell calls "unprecedented" in the federation's
history.</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney, who campaigned strongly for Democratic nominee Al Gore
throughout the presidential race, extended an olive branch to Bush by
telephone the day the Supreme Court made him president, she said.
Bush returned the call two weeks later. The two have not spoken
since. Promises of follow-up meetings with senior White House
advisors never materialized, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "After six months," Mitchell said, "we just gave up."</TE>
<TE>   Buchan, the White House spokeswoman, would not directly address
Bush's relationship with Sweeney, but said: "There are many voices in
organized labor. We've worked with labor unions and have very good
relationships with a number of them."</TE>
<TE>   She referred specifically to James P. Hoffa, president of the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and Douglas J. McCarron,
president of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of
America, both of whom have been actively courted by the
administration in what many observers view as an attempt to split the
labor movement.</TE>
<TE>   McCarron broke away from the AFL-CIO last year and has been openly
critical of Sweeney. While the Teamsters remain in the federation,
Hoffa and Sweeney have had differences.</TE>
<TE>   While the Teamsters have backed several Bush initiatives,
including his bid to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil
drilling, spokesman Bret Caldwell noted the union is often at odds
with the administration.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly are aware that many of the decisions coming out of
the White House are not labor-friendly," he said. "However, we
believe that eliminating the dialogue could only make it worse."</TE>
<TE>   The plan that sparked Friday's hand-wringing is not expected to
have an immediate impact on labor unions, but it could slowly sap the
strength of public sector unions, which represent about 37% of
eligible workers and are in a far stronger position today than
private-sector unions, which represent only 9%.</TE>
<TE>   Wiley Pearson, a policy analyst at the American Federation of
Government Employees, which represents about 600,000 federal workers,
said that under current rules, government employees competing for
their own jobs win more than half of all bids.</TE>
<TE>   But he said the latest proposal opens many more jobs to
contracting and tilts the bidding process in favor of private firms.</TE>
<TE>   "We expected a major rewrite of the rules," he said. "What
surprised us is that there's no subtlety about it."</TE>

some concerns, putting a curtain in his cell for privacy, for
instance, and the judge refused to intervene. He also denied a

<HD>Families Suspect a Link Between Missing College-Age Adults</HD>
<DH>All four disappeared within 170 miles of one another after
leaving a bar or a party.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. PAUL, Minn.</DL>
<LD>Four college-age adults have gone missing in the last few weeks in
Minnesota and Wisconsin, all after leaving a bar or a party, and
their families said they suspect a link.</LD>
<LD>   The relatives met here Thursday to urge police to step up their
investigation -- one they said has lagged because the missing are
adults.</LD>
<LD>   "Seems like this stuff's all got to be connected somehow," said
Brian Guimond, the father of Josh Guimond, a 20-year-old St. John's
University student.</LD>
<TE>   The four disappeared within 170 miles of one another.</TE>
<TE>   Josh Guimond was last seen about midnight Saturday as he left a
party on the Collegeville campus, about 70 miles west of Minneapolis.
Divers searched a nearby lake, and dozens of state National Guard
soldiers were called in, but they have found nothing.</TE>
<TE>   He was the fourth young adult reported missing since Oct. 30, when
21-year-old Erika Marie Dalquist was last seen leaving a Brainerd bar
with a man. The only one who wasn't in college, Dalquist worked at a
telemarketing company.</TE>
<TE>   The next night, Christopher Jenkins, a 21-year-old senior at the
University of Minnesota, disappeared after leaving a Halloween party
at a Minneapolis bar.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, Michael J. Noll, a junior at the University of
Wisconsin-Eau Claire, was last seen leaving a local bar on his 22nd
birthday.</TE>
<TE>   The families said they believe that authorities would have been
quicker to respond to the cases if the missing people were a few
years younger.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's painfully evident these are kids," said Jenkins'
mother, Jan Jenkins.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike in cases of missing children, many police departments wait
a few days before investigating missing adults because so many return
home on their own.</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins said the families were left to deal not only with fear for
their children but also with organizing search crews and private
investigators on their own.</TE>
<TE>   "This has got to be the most gut-wrenching, terrifying situation
parents could find themselves in," Jenkins said.</TE>
<TE>   The acting commissioner at the Department of Public Safety said
officers were doing the best they could.</TE>

<DL>SCURRY, Texas</DL>
<LD>A man with a shotgun threatened a rural East Texas high school Friday
morning until students, the principal and a teacher wrestled him to
the ground, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The 18-year-old man, a former student at Scurry-Rosser High
School, went into the school office and ordered students into the
cafeteria, said Principal Richard Sneed.</LD>
<LD>   The man was pouring gasoline on the floor when faculty members and
students decided to subdue him, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   "He did not say a word, didn't really look at anybody," said
Courtney Robertson, a junior. "Everybody was crying, it was horrible.
We thought we were all going to die."</TE>
<TE>   Robertson said the principal and a teacher slowly walked up to the
man and grabbed the gun, then wrestled him to the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "I shoved the barrel up toward the air," Sneed said. "A couple of
football players and teachers came up and we got the weapon secured.
He never said a word."</TE>
<TE>   No injuries or gunfire were reported, but classes were canceled
for the rest of the day.</TE>
<TE>   Kaufman County Sheriff David Byrne said the man, who was in
custody, will probably be charged with an array of offenses,
including aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.</TE>
<TE>   The school, about 30 miles southeast of Dallas, has about 220
students.</TE>

<HD>Rescuers Unable to Save Second Horse From Florida Sinkhole</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SANFORD, Fla.</DL>
<LD>A 50-foot-wide, 30-foot-deep sinkhole destroyed a barn, killing two
horses despite rescuers' desperate efforts to save the second one
early Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Bob Bonwit, who had returned home from his nursing job Thursday
night, was walking to his barn to feed carrots to his horses when he
discovered that a sinkhole had engulfed the barn.</LD>
<LD>   The horses were at the bottom of the pit, which was rapidly
filling with ground water. By the time Seminole County sheriff's
officials and other fire-rescue personnel had arrived, the
17-year-old horse, Jack, had drowned. The other horse, 13-year-old
Magic, was perched atop the dead horse, barely keeping his nose above
water.</LD>
<TE>   Workers placed a harness around Magic and tried to lift him out of
the hole, but his back legs were stuck in the mud. He died from
internal injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "Their horses were their family," family friend Michelle Grossman
said. "They would rather have had their house go than their horses."</TE>

<HD>Ruling Ends Ban but Limits Tests of New Sonar</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth R. Weiss</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge on Friday lifted a worldwide ban on the U.S. Navy's
powerful new sonar, allowing tests for the submarine detection system
in areas of the western Pacific that have fewer whales.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Magistrate Elizabeth D. LaPorte in San Francisco signed a
temporary agreement between Navy and environmental lawyers that
permits limited tests until the court resolves a federal lawsuit. The
suit claims insufficient restrictions were placed on the sonar system
to avoid harassing or killing whales.</LD>
<LD>   The area approved for testing is in deep waters of the western
Pacific, east and south of Japan, stretching south to the
Philippines. This large area avoids migration routes of whales, as
well as their breeding and feeding areas, marine scientists
concluded. The area excludes a narrow strip--roughly 70 miles
wide--placed off-limits to protect sea life around the Mariana
Islands.</LD>
<TE>   "This is an indication of the environmental community and military
negotiating an agreement that serves all interests," said Joel
Reynolds, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council.
"It's a clear indication that environmental protection and national
security are not necessarily at odds."</TE>
<TE>   Maureen Rudolph, a Justice Department attorney representing the
Navy, declined comment other than saying that Navy tests and training
missions with the new sonar can continue across "a fairly large
area."</TE>
<TE>   The Navy had planned to cover about 14 million miles of the North
Pacific with low-frequency active sonar, called the Surveillance
Towed Array Sensor System, between now and mid-August. The Navy has
developed the system to protect warships against super-quiet diesel
submarines, owned by Russia and other nations.</TE>
<TE>   But last month LaPorte blocked Navy plans, ruling that the
deafening sounds could cause irreparable harm to whales and other
marine mammals with sensitive hearing.</TE>
<TE>   She sided with environmentalists who have grown increasingly
concerned about the impact of military sonar, which has been blamed
for the mass die-off of whales in the Bahamas and the Canary Islands.</TE>
<TE>   Intense bursts of sound, scientists have discovered, can tear
apart delicate air-filled tissues in the ears and brains of whales.
The mammals suffer from internal bleeding and then wash ashore dead,
necropsies show.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy points out that its low-frequency sonar has never been
implicated in these mass strandings. Instead, Navy officials
acknowledge, a different, mid-frequency sonar system was to blame.
That system does not have the extended reach of the low-frequency
system.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to balance environmental concerns with national security,
LaPorte approved a temporary injunction sought by environmentalists,
but she also ordered both sides to work out acceptable places where
the Navy could use the sonar in readiness training for antisubmarine
warfare.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers and scientists met repeatedly during the last two weeks
behind closed doors to identify areas that would minimize encounters
with blue and gray whales, humpbacks, sperm whales and other types
that migrate along the coasts or crisscross the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists were particularly concerned with Navy plans to
operate in whale-abundant waters of the China Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk
near Kamchatka and the Sea of Japan.</TE>
<TE>   All of those areas were excluded, as was all of the eastern
Pacific, including waters around Hawaii and off the coast of
California and Mexico. The agreement left portions of deep "blue"
ocean, which generally lack the upwelling of plankton that attract
fish and marine mammals.</TE>
<TE>   "The Navy wanted 14 million square miles, an area four times the
size of the United States," Reynolds said. "Since they were talking
about testing and training, we thought this could be done in a more
focused area."</TE>
<TE>   The smaller area designated, he said, "minimizes exposure of a
long list of endangered and depleted species."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the Navy wants to comb 75% of the world's oceans with
low-frequency active sonar that can "light up" enemy submarines with
acoustics, much the way a floodlight can illuminate an intruder in a
darkened backyard.</TE>
<TE>   The shipboard system consists of an array of 18 speakers capable
of releasing 215-decibel bursts of low-frequency waves that can
travel hundreds of miles before dissipating.</TE>
<TE>   The National Marine Fisheries Service in July decided that the
sonar would have "negligible impact" on any marine species so long as
it operated at least 12 miles from shore and was immediately turned
off if sailors spotted any whales.</TE>
<TE>   In permitting the sonar, the fisheries service granted the Navy an
exemption to the Marine Mammal Protection Act to harass or injure up
to 12% of any species of whales, dolphins or other protected marine
mammals.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists filed suit, claiming that the permit violated a
number of federal laws.</TE>

<LD>Astronomers using Hawaii's Keck II telescope have detected the
largest volcanic eruption in the solar system on the surface of Io, a
Jovian moon.</LD>
<LD>   The eruption took place in February 2001, although analysis of the
image was only recently completed. It occurred near an area on Io
known as Surt.</LD>
<LD>   "The Surt eruption appears to cover an area of 1,900 square
kilometers [733 square miles], which is larger than the city of Los
Angeles and even larger than the entire city of London," said Franck
Marchis, a UC Berkeley research associate who co-led the analysis
team. "The total amount of energy being released by the eruption is
amazingly high."</LD>

<LD>Harbor seals can discriminate between calls of peaceful orcas and
ones that would devour them for dinner, scientists in Canada and
Scotland reported in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature. The
animals' discriminating ears were revealed in experiments in the
waters off British Columbia. The seals were played recordings of
different orca calls, and the scientists watched their responses.</LD>
<LD>   When the calls were of harmless fish-eating orcas, the seals
seemed indifferent. But when the calls were of orcas that relish seal
meat, the seals moved from the water surface (where they were more
visible) and swam further away from the sound.</LD>
<LD>   The seals were also wary of recordings of harmless but unfamiliar
orcas that live in Alaskan waters. The scientists conclude that
harbor seals have evolved to err on the side of caution, but can
eventually learn when a call is not a threat.</LD>

<LD>Stargazers in Europe, Britain and North America are in for a treat
next week and have prime viewing positions for what could be the
biggest natural fireworks display of the 21st century.</LD>
<LD>   During Tuesday's early hours, thousands of meteors, or shooting
stars, will light up the night sky as they enter the atmosphere at
speeds of about 160,000 mph.</LD>
<LD>   "It is a natural fireworks display, a celestial spectacle," said
professor Mark Bailey of the Armagh Observatory in Northern Ireland.</LD>
<TE>   Known as Leonids because they originate in the constellation Leo,
the meteor storm will be in two bursts Monday night and early
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Britain and Europe will have the best views for the first burst.
People in North America are best placed to see the second barrage
Tuesday about 2:30 a.m. PST.</TE>
<TE>   Although a full moon might dull the spectacle a bit, this year's
storm could be the biggest for the next 100 years, with 1,000 meteors
per hour trailing across the sky in the first burst and as many as
6,000 per hour during the second.</TE>

<LD>A U.N. body has voted to restrict the international trade of big-leaf
mahogany, sea horses and 26 species of sea turtles, but failed to
pass legislation to protect two species of threatened sharks.</LD>
<LD>   The 160 delegates at the Convention of International Trade in
Endangered Species voted overwhelmingly this week to limit trade of
big-leaf mahogany by listing it as a threatened species.</LD>
<LD>   Brazil, Bolivia and Peru -- the countries with the largest
mahogany reserves -- opposed the initiative on the grounds that their
conservation measures were sufficient to protect the tropical
hardwood tree, which has been decimated in recent decades.</LD>
<TE>   A U.S. initiative to protect sea horses, whose numbers have
declined by as much as 95% in recent years because of overfishing to
supply traditional medicine and aquarium industries, also passed
unanimously.</TE>
<TE>   The delegates also approved an initiative sponsored by China, the
U.S. and Germany to restrict trade of 26 species of sea turtles whose
numbers have declined precipitously from habitat destruction and
pollution.</TE>
<TE>   Delegates, however, failed to muster enough votes to pass two
proposals to protect two shark species. The whale shark -- the
world's largest fish -- and its smaller cousin, the basking shark,
have been hunted heavily for their fins, which are used in Asian
cuisine.</TE>

<HD>Lavin's Young Bruins Low-Bridged by Branch</HD>

<LD>Got a good feeling about this UCLA season.</LD>
<LD>   Why? As Robin Williams said in "The World According to Garp" when
he made an on-the-spot decision to buy a house after a plane had just
crashed into it, "It's been pre-disastered!"</LD>
<LD>   Every couple of years, Steve Lavin's team endures a loss that
belongs in the UCLA record books, such as the school's largest losing
margin, 48 points at Stanford in 1997, or fewest points scored at
Pauley Pavilion, 43 against Gonzaga in 1999.</LD>
<TE>   The Bruins lost their first exhibition game in nine years this
week, falling to Branch West Basketball Academy on Wednesday, 92-67.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always been a setback or even a [bad] stretch that's become
our springboard," Lavin said Friday. "I think it's because we learn
more through setback or failure.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm kind of glad, from the standpoint that we were kind of
humbled and humiliated. We can go back to the floor and try to get
better."</TE>
<TE>   Bruin fans, your worst fears were realized. They desperately
missed Dan Gadzuric in the middle and were outrebounded, 45-24.</TE>
<TE>   Point guard Cedric Bozeman's assist-to-turnover ratio was even, at
3-3.</TE>
<TE>   They couldn't free their top scoring threat, Jason Kapono, and
four players took more shots than he did.</TE>
<TE>   They still have four months to address those questions, but right
now there's this: Branch West Academy?</TE>
<TE>   It sounds like some ritzy prep school. Actually, it's a
developmental program to help get basketball scholarships for high
school players with college aspirations, featured on the Web site
www.branchwest.com. It's run by Bob Gottlieb, who was a head coach at
Jacksonville and the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee, and an
assistant under Eddie Sutton at Creighton, Tex Winter at Long Beach
State and Ralph Miller at Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-year-old program has branches in Thousand Oaks and
Huntington Beach. It features three AAU teams, as well as the
traveling team of former college players that plays exhibitions
against NCAA teams.</TE>
<TE>   Gottlieb's Branch West Basketball Academy also takes second
billing to his wife's interior design company on their home office
answering machine.</TE>
<TE>   "She's the boss," Gottlieb said.</TE>
<TE>   The roster constantly shifts, but Wednesday's edition of Branch
West (the name pays homage to his father's New York Ford dealership,
Branch Motors), featured Gottlieb's son Doug, the point guard on the
Oklahoma State team that went to the Elite Eight in 2000, and Horacio
Llamas, who played 28 NBA games with the Phoenix Suns. Against the
Bruins, they were led by former Quinnipiac scorer Nate Poindexter,
who had 21 points and 12 rebounds. Llamas had 15 points and 10
rebounds and Gottlieb made all six of his shots, including four
three-pointers, for 16 points.</TE>
<TE>   Branch West made 52.5% of its shots, 14 of 25 from three-point
range. Exhibition teams often have hectic travel schedules -- Branch
West arrived at the arena at 6:30 for a 7 p.m tipoff against
Mississippi State and wound up losing by 20 -- but Gottlieb made sure
his team had three days off before facing the Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew UCLA was going to be a special game for us," Gottlieb
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Then we caught a hot hand. We shot the lights out. There weren't
too many teams that were going to beat us."</TE>
<TE>   Especially a team that featured six players making their first
appearances in UCLA uniforms. It's a team that's short on veterans.
It has only two seniors, Kapono and Ray Young, and Young redshirted
last season. Junior T.J. Cummings has started only seven games.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this still is going to be a damn good UCLA team,"
Gottlieb said. "My only concern from Steve's point of view is ...
talent but inexperience. They don't have enough juniors and seniors
that are going to be key players. You define a team by its junior and
senior class, not its freshman and sophomore class."</TE>
<TE>   He could see that inexperience show in Dijon Thompson, who showed
flashes last year that he has it.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to be a top-flight player," Gottlieb said. "He still
looks like he's not ready in terms of self-confidence. He turned down
a couple of open shots that, if he were a mature, confident player,
he would not turn down."</TE>
<TE>   He liked the big kids, 6-foot-11 Michael Fey and Ryan Hollins,
even though they scored only two points apiece and Fey grabbed two
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Fey is one of the big keys," Gottlieb said. "They really
need his size and rebounding and inside presence. How fast he comes
is going to be the key to their season."</TE>
<TE>   "Hollins has tremendous upside. He's probably a little more away."</TE>
<TE>   The only good thing for the Bruins is that inexperience diminishes
with every game. The freshmen will practically be sophomores, the
sophomores nearly juniors by the time the NCAA tournament rolls
around. That's when Lavin's teams tend to peak and make it all seem
better, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Gottlieb had to go. His flight was about to leave for his team's
next game, against Marshall in West Virginia today.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins don't leave the state until they face Duke at
Indianapolis later this month. Even before they get to the
treacherous part of a schedule that Lavin called the toughest since
he got here, they have a long way to go.</TE>
<TE>   "It may get worse before it gets better," Lavin said. "The whole
idea is, come March, we could be a dangerous team. You just don't
know until you actually start playing the games. That's what's good
about finding out as soon as possible where the deficiencies lie.
Sometimes the bottom falls out [during the season] and there's not
enough time to patch it up."</TE>
<TE>   Lavin used a lot of sailing metaphors. But it might be easiest to
sum it by saying the ship's taking on water ... and it hasn't even
left the dock.</TE>

<HD>Fullmer Wants Full-Time Job</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During the Angels' run to the World Series championship, Brad Fullmer
accepted his relegation to platoon status for the good of the team.
As the Angels defend their title next season, Fullmer hopes to be the
everyday designated hitter.</LD>
<LD>   When the Angels acquired him last January, they trumpeted him as
their regular designated hitter. But he soon was benched against
left-handers, and finished the season with 429 at-bats, the lowest
full-season total of his major league career.</LD>
<LD>   "I consider myself an everyday player," Fullmer said Friday. "I
think I should have 500-some at-bats."</LD>
<TE>   Fullmer hit .289 with 19 home runs, one year after Angel DHs
combined to hit .212 with eight home runs.</TE>
<TE>   After starting Fullmer five times against left-handers in April,
Manager Mike Scioscia started him only twice against them the rest of
the season.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia has said he believes Fullmer can hit left-handers, but
his career average against them is .223 and right-handed hitting
Shawn Wooten, the other half of the platoon, returns next season.
Fullmer is eligible for arbitration -- and with it a nice raise from
his $3.75-million salary.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Bill Stoneman said the Angels can afford to retain
Fullmer, who could cost as much as $5 million and still might not
play every day.</TE>
<TE>   "That's Mike's call," Stoneman said. "Mine is, does he fit on the
club? The answer is yes. Right now, we've got him penciled in."</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer, 27, who is not eligible for free agency, declined to
discuss whether he would seek a trade but said he would like to play
regularly "wherever that may be." Stoneman declined to say whether
any teams had inquired about Fullmer this week at the general
managers' meetings, but a trade could be difficult at a time even
big-spending teams are cutting payroll.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dave Wallace, Dodger senior vice president of baseball operations,
is being considered for a similar position with the Boston Red Sox,
sources said. General Manager Dan Evans said the Red Sox have not
asked permission to interview Wallace, who recently rejected a
lucrative offer to become the New York Mets' pitching coach for the
second time.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts to contact Wallace were unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox would be especially interested in Wallace if
27-year-old Theo Epstein is promoted to general manager, believing
they need to surround the young executive with a veteran group of
baseball people. Wallace was considered one of the best pitching
coaches while serving in that role for the Dodgers and Mets, and many
officials on other teams said he is the Dodgers' most respected
baseball executive.</TE>
<TE>   Evans declined comment on whether he would permit Wallace to
interview with Boston.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers announced there will be no increase in season-ticket
prices for next season.</TE>

<HD>Jackson Seeks an End to Augusta 'Apartheid'</HD>
<DH>Reverend says he will organize protest at the Masters
unless club has a female member before tournament in April.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lance Pugmire</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Rev. Jesse Jackson said Friday he will organize a major protest
during the Masters at Augusta National Golf Club unless the club
admits a female member before then.</LD>
<LD>   "I believe the wall of discrimination will crumble before then,
but if it doesn't, we will have students, women, pro athletes and
public officials step in," said Jackson, president of the
Chicago-based Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. "This insult is not limited to
women. Apartheid, whether it be racial, religious or gender, as it is
in this case, goes against the fabric of America."</LD>
<LD>   Jackson said his ability to orchestrate effective picket-line
protests -- he recently addressed striking longshoremen in San Pedro
-- will focus significant attention on the absence of a female member
at private Augusta National, the site since 1934 of golf's first
major tournament of the year.</LD>
<TE>   The club's chairman, Hootie Johnson previously dropped event
sponsors, including IBM and Coca-Cola, so they could avoid the
pressure being applied by Martha Burk's National Council of Women's
Organizations. Johnson recently told reporters a woman would not
become a member at Augusta National before next year's Masters on
April 10-13.</TE>
<TE>   "The tide is too great for Hootie to buck," Jackson said. "We have
women in the Senate, women in combat, women in the Cabinet. Here's a
guy thumbing his nose to the world by saying a woman can't be a
member at his golf club."</TE>
<TE>   Club officials refused to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said several factors led to his involvement, mostly that
he assessed the Georgia club's exclusion of women to represent "the
very idea of apartheid." He expressed displeasure that few PGA Tour
golfers had spoken publicly about the need for a policy change at
Augusta National and criticized club members, some of whom are black,
for not more actively engaging in the national debate.</TE>
<TE>   Burk too has promised a protest of the policy during the Masters.
She says protesters should be expected when the 67th Masters
tournament begins.</TE>
<TE>   "If nothing has changed, I'm sure we're going to see some public
demonstrations of unhappiness," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She said she does not know how many protesters to expect, but she
said some students on spring break were potential demonstrators.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said earlier this week that he has given little or no
thought to the specter of protesters at the Masters, or how such a
scene would affect those in the television audience.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't have an idea," Johnson said. "I don't know that.
What I do know is that our patrons will handle it well, if there are
demonstrators."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said the challenge presented by Augusta National's policy
is not nearly as daunting as those faced in past civil rights
crusades in the South. But he said the importance of the protest
extends far beyond what some have dismissed as much ado about what
would be a minor accomplishment -- arguing for the possible right of
a woman to be a member at one of the nation's most exclusive golf
clubs.</TE>
<TE>   "Your sense of justice must be indivisible," Jackson said. "This
goes beyond the country club. It's a huge symbol, just like Rosa
Parks getting out of the back of that bus in Montgomery [Ala.] This
is about the entire issue of gender inequality and it goes against
the essence of the idea that women are members of the human family.
This has great significance, and it is a fight that will be won. It
has to win. This policy is un-American."</TE>

<HD>Cubs Take a Giant Step With Hiring of Baker</HD>
<DH>Team will pay popular manager $14 million in hope he can
help it end decades of futility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Teddy Greenstein</AU>
<BD>Chicago Tribune</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>CHICAGO -- Dusty Baker has been known for the toothpicks that dangle
from his mouth, the wristbands he wears on his arms and his ability
to meld the frostiest of personalities.</LD>
<LD>   Now Johnnie B. Baker Jr. will be known around Chicago as a man
who's confident enough -- or perhaps crazy enough -- to believe he
can help bring a winner to Wrigley Field.</LD>
<LD>   "I love challenges," Baker said Friday after being named manager
of the Cubs.</LD>
<TE>   After more than three days of wrangling over money, the Cubs
reached agreement with Baker just before 7 p.m. CST Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Neither side would disclose terms of the four-year deal, which is
believed to be worth about $14 million, which would make him
baseball's second-highest paid manager, behind the Yankees' Joe
Torre.</TE>
<TE>   The 53-year-old Baker said the Cubs "dug a little deeper" toward
the end of the negotiations. "We were creative and came up with ways
to make it work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   When General Manager Jim Hendry's search began nearly seven weeks
ago, he did not know if Baker's reported feud with Giant management
would compel the three-time manager of the year to leave the team.</TE>
<TE>   Hendry didn't even know how Baker felt about Chicago -- the team
or the city.</TE>
<TE>   But Hendry knew enough about Baker to make him believe he was the
perfect fit.</TE>
<TE>   Even if there was only a small chance to hire him, Hendry was
content to let other candidates accept other managerial jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The Texas Rangers snapped up Buck Showalter. The Oakland A's
promoted Ken Macha. The Seattle Mariners hired Bob Melvin on Friday
to replace Lou Piniella.</TE>
<TE>   "Jim's first choice was Dusty Baker," team President Andy MacPhail
said. "His second choice was Dusty Baker and his third was Dusty
Baker. So he kept after it."</TE>
<TE>   Baker said many factors compelled him to accept the Cubs' offer.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Matthews, a close friend who's in line for a Cub coaching
job, sold him on the city. Cub TV analyst Steve Stone stressed the
team's base of young talent. Baker's wife, Melissa, has family in the
area.</TE>
<TE>   Former manager Don Baylor, fired by the Cubs in July, offered the
temporary use of his condo and apparently didn't try to poison Baker
on the organization.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to [focus] on the positives Donnie gave me," Baker
said. "I wish Donnie still could be in this job. I trust his opinion
big-time and he gave me as much info as he possibly could."</TE>
<TE>   But the most important information came from MacPhail and Hendry,
who convinced Baker that the organization's goal was not simply to
make money and attract big crowds to Wrigley.</TE>
<TE>   "Andy MacPhail and Jim Hendry, they're really set on winning,"
Baker said. "I know I'm not a miracle man. I don't know if it's going
to take a year or two years or whatever. But we're dedicated to
winning.</TE>
<TE>   "A number of players have indicated that they would possibly like
to come to Chicago and play for me. They're dedicated to bringing in
the best players that the budget will allow."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Cubs might now actively pursue Jim Thome, who hit 52
home runs for Cleveland last season. They've already acquired catcher
Damian Miller from Arizona in a trade.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an enormously popular manager with his players," MacPhail
said. "As result, the field of players that would like to play for
the Cubs has increased with tonight's announcement by a large
amount."</TE>
<TE>   Baker had a .540 winning percentage in his 10 seasons in San
Francisco. Five of his teams won 90 games, and the Giants fell one
victory shy of a World Series title last month.</TE>
<TE>   The Cubs will be Baker's biggest managerial test. They haven't won
a World Series since 1908 and have made the playoffs only three times
since 1945, their last World Series appearance.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to get rid of the stigma that the Cubs can't win and that
they can't win playing daytime baseball," Baker said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Melvin, the Arizona Diamondbacks' bench coach, was hired as
Seattle's first new manager in a decade, replacing Piniella, who left
to become the Tampa Bay Devil Rays' manager. Melvin was one of four
finalists, including Dodger bench coach Jim Riggleman.</TE>
<TE>   Melvin, 41, a former major league catcher, is the 12th manager in
Mariner history.</TE>
<TE>   He was given a two-year contract.</TE>

<HD>For Ayala, Good Doesn't Cut It</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It starts with his first name. What kind of a fighter goes by Paulie?
The boxing hero of all those Sylvester Stallone movies was named
Rocky. His stumbling, bumbling brother-in-law was named Paulie.</LD>
<LD>   It continues with his nickname. Paulie Ayala doesn't have one.</LD>
<LD>   His opponent in tonight's World Boxing Council featherweight
championship fight has a great nickname. Nobody has trouble picturing
Erik "El Terrible" Morales as a fighter.</LD>
<TE>   Meeting Ayala wouldn't give you much of a clue, either. He's
quiet, humble, respectful and a devoted family man to his wife and
two kids.</TE>
<TE>   Because Ayala is a master boxer rather than a knockout puncher,
it's understandable that he has not caught on with the public despite
an impressive record and an esteemed list of opponents reduced to
notches on his championship belts.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, tonight's main event at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay
Events Center between Ayala and Morales has been a tough sell.</TE>
<TE>   Ayala will bring a 34-1 record into the ring tonight, but he has
only 12 knockouts. He has beaten Johnny Tapia twice and Clarence
"Bones" Adams -- talk about a great nickname -- twice. But all four
of those victories came by decision.</TE>
<TE>   Ayala is trying to do something about his knockout ratio through a
vigorous weight program. "I'm a lot stronger and bigger now," he
said, "and it shows. I have never relied on my punching power. I have
relied on being smarter and quicker."</TE>
<TE>   If he starts racking up knockouts along with victories, it would
broaden his appeal. So would a name change. How about Paul "The
Predator" Ayala?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Morales' concern is neither name recognition nor knockout power.
He is 41-1 with 31 knockouts. But he can't seem to get over the
defeat, which came in June when he lost a close decision to Marco
Antonio Barrera. Some thought Morales had won the fight, just as some
thought Barrera won the first meeting in 2000 when Morales eked out a
split-decision victory.</TE>
<TE>   Morales, still bitter, sees a much darker reason for the defeat in
the 126-pound division.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people thought it was a fixed fight because everybody
knows I won," he said. "But the judges gave it to him. I did my job
in both fights and won both fights. Do I care? Marco Antonio Barrera
is not the most important thing in my life. I've got a lot of plans.
I want to go to 130 pounds. If I never fight Barrera, I couldn't care
less."</TE>
<TE>   Which means, of course, that he cares very much.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Morales can at least take satisfaction from getting a
second shot at the belt he lost in June. Barrera, refusing to pay the
WBC sanctioning fees, announced before the second match that he
wouldn't accept the title if he won it.</TE>
<TE>   So the WBC, always looking for fresh money, will bestow its
scorned title on tonight's winner. As long as he pays up.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Promoter Bob Arum approves of Oscar De La Hoya's plan for a
junior-middleweight tournament.</TE>
<TE>   As long as there are no upsets.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya is proposing to put three top 154-pound fighters into
his three-fight event and fill the fourth slot himself. There would
be two semifinal matches and a championship.</TE>
<TE>   In Arum's mind, the logical matchups would be De La Hoya against
Shane Mosley and Fernando Vargas against Vernon Forrest in the first
round.</TE>
<TE>   "My interest in this is that it provides a viable opponent for
Oscar in the second round," said Arum, who considers De La Hoya a
lock against Mosley. "You can call it a tournament or put whatever
label you want on it, but that's what this is all about. It's a good
idea to have Vargas and Forrest fight. If Vargas wins, the rematch
against De La Hoya is huge. If Forrest wins, it makes him bigger than
he is now because he beat a huge Hispanic fighter."</TE>
<TE>   There are obstacles. Vargas, due to come before the Nevada State
Athletic Commission Wednesday after testing positive for steroids, is
expected to receive a suspension of an indeterminate length. And
before Mosley can fight De La Hoya, he is expected to face Raul
Marquez in a February match.</TE>

<LD>What is the surest sign of celebrity?</LD>
<LD>   The answer comes from the National Farmers' Union, an organization
representing farmers and growers in England and Wales.</LD>
<LD>   It recently conducted a telephone survey of 200 farmers and found
that they are naming their bovines after actors, Denzel Washington;
singers, Posh Spice and Kylie Minogue; girlfriends of princes,
Camilla Parker Bowles, and soccer stars, Beckham and Bergkamp.</LD>
<TE>   That's David Beckham of Manchester United and Dennis Bergkamp of
Arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   "The influx of celebrities is just as likely to be felt in a
farmer's field as in cities and towns," said Tim Bennett, NFU deputy
president, on the organization's Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "These days, Marigold, Bluebell and Buttercup have to compete with
Kylie and Posh."</TE>
<TE>   For the record, two cows in Bennett's herd are named Penelope and
Priscilla.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time:  What was unusual about the way Rod Carew of the
Minnesota Twins won the American League batting title in 1972?</TE>
<TE>   Si o no: The Spanish daily, El Mundo, conducted an Internet poll
after tennis player Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, a four-time Grand Slam
winner and former No. 1, retired this week: Should she be considered
the best Spanish athlete of all time?</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez-Vicario lost this vote with 62% saying no, and 38% voting
yes.</TE>
<TE>   Low profile: Ken Rosenthal of the Sporting News discovered a
remarkable, rare species -- a front-office executive not in search of
recognition:</TE>
<TE>   "Don't tell Twins' General Manager Terry Ryan he's the Sporting
News executive of the year," Rosenthal wrote. "Ryan isn't looking for
praise, he's seeking to avoid it. He once warned a writer planning to
write a favorable piece, 'Don't make me puke.' "</TE>
<TE>   Of the 47 votes, Ryan received 23. Just keep it quiet.</TE>
<TE>   Slippery slope: People are wondering how long it will take for
late-night TV host Dave Letterman to whip up a top 10 list about
Sacramento State football players applying nonstick cooking spray to
their uniforms during a game against Montana last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   There was this headline in the Independent Record of Helena,
Mont.: "Sac State in Sticky Situation."</TE>
<TE>   Jon Kasper of the Missoulian summed up the fine mess with this
opening paragraph: "A very large egg landed on the face of the
Sacramento State's football program Thursday. At least it won't
stick."</TE>
<TE>   Law of averages: Colorado Avalanche defenseman Derek Morris scored
his first goal of the season earlier this month in a loss to the
Vancouver Canucks and was appropriately sarcastic.</TE>
<TE>   "After about 50 shots, it's about time it went in," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The wait for goal No. 2 wasn't as long.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday, he scored in the first period of Colorado's 3-1 victory
over Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Carew won it without hitting a home run.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: President Bush, on former Detroit coach Scotty
Bowman, when the Red Wings appeared at a White House ceremony
honoring its Stanley Cup victory: "He gets these ruffians skating in
the same direction."</TE>

<HD>Energy Crisis for Clippers</HD>
<DH>Playing the second of back-to-back games, they start out
flat and stay that way in 112-88 loss at Portland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Corey Maggette missed a hurried jump shot on the Clippers' first
possession Friday against the Portland Trail Blazers. Eric Piatkowski
missed a bank shot, then made a bad pass. Michael Olowokandi missed a
shot. So did Andre Miller. Olowokandi committed a turnover.</LD>
<LD>   At the other end of the court, the Trail Blazers were everything
the Clippers were not during a comprehensive 112-88 victory before a
crowd of 18,723 at the Rose Garden. Starting with energetic.</LD>
<LD>   Forward Scottie Pippen made a layup on the Trail Blazers' first
possession. Bonzi Wells hit two free throws. Rasheed Wallace dropped
in a lob pass from Pippen. Pippen made a 19-foot jumper and a free
throw.</LD>
<TE>   And so it went.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing to say," Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry said. "We
were awful. I think this was the worst game we've played [in the
two-plus seasons] I've been here."</TE>
<TE>   By the time Maggette made a jumper for the Clippers' first points,
3 minutes 12 seconds had elapsed and the Trail Blazers had a 9-2
lead. It would only get worse for the Clippers, who trailed by as
much as 85-51 late in the third quarter during another forgettable
trip to Portland.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, the NBA's assist leader last season, had one assist to go
with 19 points. The Clippers made 31 of 73 shots (42.5%) and 19 of 33
free throws (57.6%). They committed 22 turnovers, which led to 35
Portland points. They were outrebounded, 47-28.</TE>
<TE>   Was it any wonder the Clippers lost their seventh consecutive game
at Portland and 19th in their last 20? Their only victory during that
stretch was on April 11, 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers' hearts and minds seemed to be elsewhere Friday, one
night after Tracy McGrady torched them for 35 points in a 101-80 loss
to the Orlando Magic at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   The only question after the Trail Blazers built a 59-38 halftime
lead was how big the final margin would be. Gentry gave most of his
starters the fourth quarter off, although it could be said that they
took the first, second and third quarters off, too.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers missed open shots and free throws, handed the ball to
the Trail Blazers at the slightest hint of pressure and were hammered
on the boards.</TE>
<TE>   It was that kind of night.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't match their intensity," Piatkowski said. "I think they
outhustled us on every play. We didn't run our offense. We were
selfish at times. We had complete breakdowns in all facets."</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers had been struggling, losing six of nine before
Friday. Coach Maurice Cheeks benched point guard Damon Stoudamire and
replaced him with Derek Anderson, a former Clipper, who responded
with 28 points on nine-for-15 shooting. Pippen, a forward, played
point guard.</TE>
<TE>   Cheeks also didn't play Antonio Daniels until the fourth quarter,
with victory well in hand.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it was Cheeks' lineup changes or Clipper ineptitude, the
Trail Blazers toyed with their visitors from start to finish. Perhaps
it was a combination of the two.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to play defense," said Elton Brand, who had 10 points
and 10 rebounds. "We have to stay in front of our men. Turnovers are
hurting us. We're not executing our offense. But we need to play 'D'.
"</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers don't have much time to fret about their worst
performance of the season. They play host to the Seattle SuperSonics
on Sunday, then play Monday at Golden State to complete a stretch of
four games in five days.</TE>
<TE>   A difficult schedule was no excuse for the Clippers' woeful play
Friday. Or Thursday against the Magic, a team the Clippers defeated,
120-117, with an inspired performance Sunday at Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same team that played well in Orlando and played well in
Miami," Gentry said. "We've got to find a way to come back from this.
We had another horrendous start. You can't play uphill all the time."</TE>

<HD>While Team Plays, Odom Trudges Along</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Lamar Odom spent another day and night of tedium. He shot baskets
with his teammates hours before the doors to the Rose Garden opened
to the fans Friday. He performed all the pregame rituals his
teammates did, but with one noteworthy difference.</LD>
<LD>   While the rest of the Clippers dressed in their red road uniforms
and played against the Portland Trail Blazers, Odom finished his
workout, showered and changed into street clothes to watch his
teammates play their ninth game of the season.</LD>
<LD>   "I want to play bad," Odom said. "I want to play some basketball."</LD>
<TE>   Because of a sprained right ankle and a sprained right wrist, he
hasn't played since going on the injured list Jan. 24. He has had
surgery on his wrist and re-injured his ankle since last season
ended.</TE>
<TE>   Although Odom is eager to move up his return date, it's expected
to be Christmas before he is fit to play. Odom originally injured his
wrist in a fall during a game Dec. 16 against the Detroit Pistons.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like a baby learning to walk," he said. "If it were just
my wrist, I would be ready to play. But my ankle is not there yet.
It's definitely getting stronger. I've started running again. I'm
doing everything on the court now. I'm not babying it. I'm off the
[stationary] bike and the treadmill.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm diving right in."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trail Blazer guard Jeff McInnis, on leaving as a free agent after
being the starting point guard with the Clippers for two seasons:
"I'm not the first and I'm sure I'm not going to be the last. I felt
it was all good when the season ended. Then when I left they said so
many bad things about me. Looking back, I don't know what kind of
relationship we had."</TE>
<TE>   McInnis signed with the Trail Blazers after it became clear the
Clippers intended to pursue Andre Miller last summer.</TE>
<TE>   "There are good fans here," McInnis said. "They boo you if you're
not playing well. Just like it was in L.A."</TE>
<TE>   McInnis said playing a reserve role has been an adjustment, but
he's not about to complain to Portland Coach Maurice Cheeks.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to work for it," McInnis said. "Damon Stoudamire is a
good player. Hey, I've been in the CBA. I worked hard to get here.
It's a tough situation."</TE>

<LD>The Big Sky Conference didn't exactly stick it to four Sacramento
State defensive linemen who greased their jerseys for a game.</LD>
<LD>   Brad Osterhout, Bilal Watkins, Ben Fox and Eric Broden were
reprimanded Friday, but can play against Weber State today.</LD>
<LD>   "The Big Sky was very concerned that coaches may have been
involved," conference Commissioner Doug Fullerton said.</LD>
<TE>   "Had the coaches been involved, we would have considered this a
more serious ethical problem. It appears one player initiated the
incident. While we in no way condone this action, we feel that a
reprimand is the appropriate response."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ater taking a hard fall early in Friday night's game against Georgia,
Texas guard T.J. Ford rebounded to match his career high with 22
points to go with eight assists as No. 4 Texas overcame a 10-point
second-half deficit to beat No. 16 Georgia, 77-71, in the Coaches vs.
Cancer Classic at New York.</LD>
<LD>   Georgia, which was playing without two of its best inside players
-- Chris Daniels was suspended for one game by the NCAA, Steve Thomas
three games by the school -- got to within 71-69 on a three-point
basket by Ezra Williams with 55 seconds left.</LD>
<LD>   But Ford scored with 29 seconds left and Brandon Mouton made four

Texas.</LD>
<TE>   No. 18 Marquette 73, Villanova 61 -- Marquette took an 11-2 lead,

<HD>Ducks Sharp, so They Get Point</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>These things are expected here.</LD>
<LD>   The Red Wings' Brett Hull plops his carcass down in the slot and
waits. Goal.</LD>
<LD>   Teammate Sergei Fedorov has time to line up an uncontested shot
like he's on a putting green. Goal.</LD>
<TE>   Those things are rock-solid certain, as predictable as a bumpy cab
ride in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Now for something that can raise an eyebrow, make a person do a
double take. How about the Mighty Ducks being a little unhappy with
getting just one measly point out of Joe Louis Arena?</TE>
<TE>   Fedorov did his bit. He had enough time to dash off a note to
former girlfriend Anna Kournikova before firing a shot past goalie
Jean-Sebastien Giguere with 20.8 seconds left for a 2-1 overtime
victory that sent 20,058 home relieved Friday. Hull had already done
his bit, tying the score with a one-timer five minutes into the third
period.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, however, were not in the mood to take the point and
skedaddle.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a big point for us, but the way our mind-set is now,
this doesn't put us on cloud nine," Duck center Matt Cullen said.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks' feet should have been airborne.</TE>
<TE>   Giguere was brilliant, stopping 43 of 45 shots. The Ducks, who had
played Thursday in Columbus, gritted out 65 minutes. The overtime
loss gave the Ducks points in six consecutive road games, a franchise
record.</TE>
<TE>   And still they craved more.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed with giving up that goal [in overtime]," Coach
Mike Babcock said. "We weren't going to get another point for the
tie, but the moral victory is something special."</TE>
<TE>   The bird-in-the-hand fact is the Ducks are 5-1-1-2 in their last
nine games and have moved into second place in the Pacific Division.
But expectations seem to have changed for a team that used to be
happy with scraps off the table from teams like the Red Wings.</TE>
<TE>   "We came into this building and played a great team and did get a
point," defenseman Keith Carney said. "We're on the road getting
points and that's going to mean a lot. Now when we come to Detroit,
we expect to play hard and we know we can get some points out of the
game."</TE>
<TE>   Fedorov got Detroit the two points Friday. He cruised into the
Duck zone in overtime and patiently waited for an opening. He fired
his shot into the left corner.</TE>
<TE>   "[Brendan] Shanahan ran into me in the crease and created some
obstruction," Giguere said. "It would have been a tough call to make,
but I don't think the goal should have counted. I didn't see the
shot. You give a chance like that to a guy like [Fedorov] and I can't
see him, he's going to score."</TE>
<TE>   Just about everything Giguere saw, he stopped. From the start, he
frustrated the Red Wings. They had only 10 shots in the first period,
but six were quality chances.</TE>
<TE>   In the second period, a freak ricochet left the Red Wings with a
three-on-none rush. Giguere held his ground and Kirk Maltby fired a
wild shot over the net.</TE>
<TE>   "On that kind of play, you got to show patience and try to get the
guy to panic a little bit," Giguere said.</TE>

<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>It was a tough night for the Mighty Ducks, losing to the Detroit Red
Wings in overtime, 2-1. It was a painful night for Duck center Marc
Chouinard.</LD>
<LD>   Detroit's Pavel Datsyuk flipped a puck that ricocheted off
Chouinard's forehead in the second period, opening a gash that took
seven stitches to close. Chouinard returned to play 2 minutes 56
seconds later and won eight of nine faceoffs in the third period and
overtime.</LD>
<LD>   Afterward, he was still a little dazed.</LD>
<TE>   "It still hurts," Chouinard said. "I never saw the puck coming. I
was a little lightheaded at first, but it's better now."</TE>
<TE>   Chouinard does not wear a visor on his helmet.</TE>
<TE>   "That's something I'm going to look at now," Chouinard said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Right wing Alexei Smirnov, one of the Ducks' promising young
players, was sent to minor league Cincinnati on Friday. He was
scheduled to play three games, then rejoin the team in New York on
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Smirnov, 20, has struggled in recent games and was a healthy
scratch Thursday against Columbus. He had one goal and one assist
this season, both in the season opener against St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Petr Sykora's second-period goal gave him points in six
consecutive games. He has three games and three assists in that time.
Sykora has six goals and 12 points this season.</TE>
<TE>   Stanislav Chistov and Andy McDonald assisted on the goal.</TE>
<TE>   Chistov is second among rookies with 11 points, behind Chicago's
Tyler Arnason, who has 12.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some of the world's top professional golfers have assembled at
Monarch Beach Golf Links in Dana Point this weekend to kick off the
made-for-television season with the Hyundai Team Matches, but an
amateur created the biggest stir Friday during the pro-am -- former
President Clinton.</LD>
<LD>   Clinton played in a group with PGA Tour player Fred Couples,
Hyundai executive vice president B.H. Sung and Kevin Allen of the
Washington Group.</LD>
<LD>   Clinton's day included several mulligans, a handful of shanks and
a few balls in the water, but the lowlight came on the 18th hole,
when he hit a spectator in the leg with his second shot.</LD>
<TE>   Kevin Krogmeier, a lawyer from Monarch Beach, had been heckling
Clinton's club choice -- a fairway wood -- and telling him to switch
to a five-iron. Clinton, who reportedly carries a handicap between 12
and 14, ignored the advice. He swung the wood and hit a dead pull,
the ball striking Krogmeier in the left shin. Krogmeier, standing
about 20 yards away, hopped up and down, then got an autographed ball
from Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   The real golfers take center stage today at 7:50 a.m. The format
is team best-ball match play. The PGA Tour, Champions (formerly
Senior PGA) Tour and the LPGA Tour have separate tournaments taking
place simultaneously. The finals are Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champions are Couples and Mark Calcavecchia from the PGA
Tour, Lorie Kane and Janice Moodie from the LPGA Tour and Allen Doyle
and Dan Quigley from the Champions Tour.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kraft Nabisco Championship has changed its eligibility
requirements for 2003, including exempting the top five players from
the LPGA's other three majors, an expansion from the top three
players who are currently exempt. Also, the top 70 players from the
official money list will be exempt for the 2003 tournament, instead
of the top 60 who are eligible now.</TE>

<LD>Kevin Brulois, one of the top two runners on Long Beach Poly's boys'
cross-country team, had an appendectomy Wednesday and won't run today
in the Southern Section preliminaries at Mount San Antonio College.</LD>
<LD>   Coach George Wright, who has guided Poly to the top ranking in the
state Division I poll, said it's too early to tell if Brulois could
race in the section championships Nov. 23 or in the state
championships Nov. 30, assuming the Jackrabbits advance that far.</LD>
<LD>   "He seems pretty optimistic," Wright said, "but it's going to
depend on what the doctors say."</LD>
<TE>   The preliminaries start at 7:56 a.m. with a Division V boys' race.
The last race, a Division II girls' heat, is scheduled to begin at
3:44 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Lena Bettis of Riverside North, the defending state champion in
the girls' long jump, has committed to Penn State and is expected to
sign a letter of intent today.</TE>
<TE>   Bettis, who took recruiting trips to Miami and Penn State, has a
career best of 19 feet 10 3/4 inches in the long jump and will be the
No. 5 returnee in the nation for the 2003 season.</TE>
<TE>   Ashlee Brown, Bettis' teammate and the two-time defending state
champion in the 300-meter low hurdles, has yet to commit to a
four-year school. She has taken recruiting trips to Miami, Penn
State, Illinois and Arizona State.</TE>

for the Sierra League football title, won a series of coin flips
Friday and was named the league's No. 1 team heading into the
Southern Section Division II playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Damien (8-2, 3-1) is the No. 2 team based on its victory over
Ayala (8-2, 3-1) on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Newport Harbor won a coin flip with Laguna Hills and Irvine Friday
to settle a three-way tie for second place in the Sea View League
football standings. The Sailors (7-3, 3-2 in league) finish behind
Santa Ana Foothill (8-2, 4-1)</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Hills (6-4, 3-2) also receives an automatic berth in the
Division VI playoffs as the league's No. 3 team based on its 33-6

<LD>Crenshaw tight end Chris Porter fumbled away a scoring opportunity in
the first half but he did no such thing with the game and the
Coliseum League title on the line Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   Porter caught a five-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Andrew
Simpson with 45 seconds left to give the Cougars a come-from-behind,
19-18 victory over Dorsey at Jackie Robinson Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Kevin Menjivar's only successful extra-point try enabled Crenshaw
to end its league season undefeated at 5-0. The Cougars, 7-3 overall,
may be in line for the No. 2 or No. 3 overall seeding at today's City
Section playoff pairings meeting.</LD>
<TE>   Dorsey (4-6, 3-2) took an 18-12 lead with 3:40 remaining when
Donald Prince completed a pass to Jerome Johnson and the big tight
end shook off two tacklers to score on a 70-yard reception.</TE>
<TE>   Crenshaw, which rallied from a 12-0 halftime deficit, put together
a game-winning, 54-yard drive by handing the ball off to running Dary
Adway for five of the first six plays. Adway, who had 110 yards in 18
carries, gained 41 yards and picked up two first downs.</TE>
<TE>   With the Dons focused on the run, Porter got loose in the end zone
and Simpson found him.</TE>
<TE>   Crenshaw scored two quick touchdowns in the third quarter to tie
the score.</TE>
<TE>   Mebane, who comes in at fullback on short-yardage plays, scored
from one yard out and Adway added a nine-yard touchdown run to take
advantage of a Dorsey fumble. But Menjivar missed both point after
tries to leave the score tied at 12-12 entering the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   -- Eric Stephens</TE>

<TE>   Franklin 21, Eagle Rock 19 -- Narciso Diaz completed 11 of 17
passes for 229 yards and two touchdowns for the Panthers, who won
their 12th Northern League title in 13 years.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz completed a 67-yard touchdown pass play to Brandon Powers in
the second quarter and added a 17-yard scoring strike to Danny Irbina
in the third quarter. Diaz leads the City Section with 32 touchdown
passes and is second behind Eddie Miller of Venice with 2,841 yards
passing.</TE>
<TE>   Powers had four receptions for 130 yards and Stevie Ramirez added
four for 53 yards for Franklin (9-2, 5-0), which clinched a spot in
the Championship playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Earnell Bowers returned the second-half kickoff 98 yards for a
touchdown and John Paul Yniquez's one-yard touchdown run pulled host
Eagle Rock (7-3, 3-2) within 21-19 with 1:19 left in the third
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Celis completed eight of 14 passes for 101 yards for the
Eagles, including a 26-yard touchdown pass play to Luis Estrada in
the second quarter. Estrada caught four passes for 68 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Torres rushed for 59 yards and a touchdown in 10 carries,
and Darryl Swim intercepted a desperation pass at Franklin's 25-yard
line with no time remaining to preserve the victory.</TE>

<LD>Teams with .500 records typically aren't expected to do much in the
Southern Section football playoffs. La Puente Bishop Amat might be an
exception.</LD>
<LD>   The Lancers rolled up 397 yards rushing and thoroughly dominated
two-time defending Serra League champion Santa Margarita during a
37-20 victory Friday night at Saddleback College, solidifying Bishop
Amat's once-shaky playoff aspirations.</LD>
<LD>   The Lancers (5-5, 2-3 in league) won their final two games to
finish in a three-way tie with Anaheim Servite and Los Angeles Loyola
for third place in league.</LD>
<TE>   A series of coin flips will be held this morning to determine the
league's third and final guaranteed playoff entry.</TE>
<TE>   Bellflower St. John Bosco (8-2, 5-0) defeated Santa Ana Mater Dei,
28-27, in overtime, on Thursday to win the league title. Mater Dei
(8-2, 3-2) finished second in the league.</TE>
<TE>   The teams that lose the coin flips must hope for at-large berths
in the playoffs -- a likely proposition given the relative weakness
of at-large hopefuls in the three other Division I leagues.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita (6-4, 1-4), No. 20 in The Times' rankings,
suffered a first-to-worst turnaround in league play but will probably
receive an at-large postseason berth because of its six victories and
difficult nonleague schedule.</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles trailed by 10 points late in the fourth quarter and had
a chance to cut the deficit to eight on a two-point conversion
attempt, but receiver Bobby Whithorne was stopped just short of the
goal line after catching a pass from Case Colaw.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Amat's Vincent Vasquez corralled a high hop on the ensuing
onside kick and returned it 51 yards for a touchdown for the final
margin.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Seals finished with 187 yards rushing and two touchdowns in
25 carries for the Lancers, who registered their first victory over
Santa Margarita in three tries.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always been this good," Seals said. "We had a couple of
games where we came out flat, but we've always been here."</TE>
<TE>   -- Ben Bolch</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Loyola 21, Anaheim Servite 12 -- Bo Renaud rushed for 165
yards and two touchdowns in 34 carries and Scott Doke completed 13 of
23 passes for 260 yards and a touchdown to lead the Cubs to the upset
at Fullerton High.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola (7-3, 2-3) trailed, 6-0, at halftime but scored touchdowns
on three of its first four second-half possessions.</TE>
<TE>   Doke completed six of eight passes for 139 yards in the second
half and hit Jesus Cuellar for a 45-yard touchdown to make it 7-6
only 1 minute 55 seconds into the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Renaud, who gained only 32 yards in 10 first-half carries, turned
it around in the second half, scoring on runs of two and seven yards
to give the Cubs a 21-6 lead with 6:13 left.</TE>
<TE>   No. 15 Servite (7-3, 2-3) went 80 yards on eight plays on its
first possession, capped by a 43-yard catch-and-run score by Matthew
Slater.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Coffelt, who hit Slater for a 53-yard score with 5:04 left,
finished seven of 19 passing for 154 yards. Slater caught five passes
for 124 yards.</TE>

<LD>Sean Edwards scored from the one-yard line with 2 minutes 5 seconds
left to lift Palmdale to a 20-15 upset victory over Lancaster
Antelope Valley in a Golden League game Friday night at Palmdale.</LD>
<LD>   Edwards' score capped a 10-play, 72-yard drive that began after
Antelope Valley, ranked No. 23 by The Times and No. 4 in the Southern
Section Division III poll, had taken a 15-14 edge with 5:40 left on a
40-yard reverse halfback option play from Juan Rayford to Eric
Wickliffe and a two-point conversion pass from quarterback Johnny
Walker to Danny Leist.</LD>
<LD>   The victory moved the Falcons (9-1, 4-1 in the league), the No.
6-ranked team in Division III, into a tie with Antelope Valley (8-2,
4-1) for the league title, but Palmdale will go to the playoffs,
which start next week, as the league's No. 1 team based on
head-to-head competition. Highland (7-3, 3-2) lost its bid for a
three-way tie with a 22-12 loss to Quartz Hill.</LD>
<TE>   On the winning drive, quarterback Jacob McCravey completed two key
passes for five and 38 yards to JaVonte Holmes (four catches, 62
yards) and also ran for three yards and a first down on a
fourth-and-one play with 3:50 left. McCravey was 12-of-23 passing for
148 yards and one touchdown with no interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Palmdale, which took a 14-7 halftime lead, limited Antelope
Valley's vaunted triple-option attack of Walker, Kreig Peters and
Sean Wallace to a combined 84 yards rushing. The Antelopes, who had
averaged more than 300 yards a game, were held to 162 yards.</TE>
<TE>   -- Lauren Peterson</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hacienda Heights Los Altos 29, La Verne Bonita 0 -- Knowing that a
loss would drop it to third place in the Miramonte League, the
Conquerors scored on three of their first four possessions at Bonita
and went on to force a three-way tie for the league title.</TE>
<TE>   Los Altos (8-2, 3-1), ranked No. 17 by The Times and No. 1 in
Division VI, had already won a coin flip and knew, with a victory, it
would be the league's No. 1 team in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Bonita (5-4, 3-1) will go in as the No. 2 team, and Covina Charter
Oak (8-2, 3-1), a 49-7 winner over Pomona Garey, is No. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Drayton scored twice, from 13 yards for a 7-0 lead and from
two yards to make it 20-0 in the first minute of the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   In between, Randall Brown, who set up the first two scoring drives
with 15-yard punt returns, scored on a 37-yard draw play with 1:33
left in the first quarter. Brown carried 19 times for 140 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Los Altos scored in the fourth quarter on a 13-yard pass from
Carlos Ordonez to Caleb Flores, and its defense added a safety in the
game's final minutes.</TE>
<TE>   -- Martin Henderson</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard 35, Camarillo 13 -- Quarterback Tim Eglin ran for one
touchdown and threw for another and slot back Marcelino Villavicencio
scored one touchdown rushing and another receiving to help visiting
Oxnard (9-1, 5-0) win its third consecutive Pacific View League
title.</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo (5-5, 3-2) cut a 14-10 halftime deficit to 14-13 with
5:55 left in the third quarter on a 26-yard field goal by Chris
Chase. But Villavicencio capped a 10-play, 83-yard drive with a
six-yard touchdown run with 10:16 left in the game, and tailback
Aaron Brown scored six minutes later on a three-yard run to cap a
five-play, 69-yard drive.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard, the No. 2 team in Division IV, capped its scoring with
2:16 left when linebacker Moises Rosales scored a touchdown on a
65-yard interception return.</TE>
<TE>   Eglin rushed for 74 yards in seven carries, including a 52-yard
touchdown run in the first quarter, and completed five of eight
passes for 72 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Villavicencio had two carries for 53 yards and two receptions for
49 yards.</TE>
<TE>   -- John Ortega</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Riverside North 28, Moreno Valley Canyon Springs 17 -- Behind the
passing combination of Dion and Damon Morton, the Huskies won the Ivy
League title outright with the victory at Canyon Springs.</TE>
<TE>   Dion, a junior quarterback, threw for 224 yards and three
touchdowns and his twin brother caught five passes for 87 yards and a
touchdown as North (7-3, 5-0) won its second league title in three
years.</TE>
<TE>   Canyon Springs (8-1-1, 4-1) took a 3-0 lead on a school-record
54-yard field goal by Mike Hughes on its first possession.</TE>
<TE>   But North needed only four plays, including a 28-yard scramble by
Dion on North's first play, to take a 7-3 lead on Josh Barnett's
34-yard run. It was the first time this season that the Cougars
trailed in a game.</TE>
<TE>   A 55-yard reception by Adam Wright on the final play of the first
quarter set up Dion's 12-yard touchdown pass to Damon.</TE>
<TE>   -- Dan Arritt</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Monrovia 45, Temple City 35 -- Monrovia overcame a 14-3 first-half
deficit by scoring 28 points thanks to Temple City turnovers to take
the Rio Hondo League title over the defending champions at Monrovia.</TE>
<TE>   Monrovia (10-0, 5-0) won in spite of 425 all-purpose yards from
tailback Desmond Reed, who accounted for all five scores for Temple
City (7-3, 4-1). Reed tallied three rushing touchdowns to go with 170
yards in 16 carries and kick returns of 87 and 85 yards for scores.</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcats were led by Adam Gabriel, who rushed for 144 yards in
24 carries with one touchdown.</TE>

<LD>Opponents can examine all the game films they want and listen to
endless pep talks from their coaches, but finding a strategy to
defeat unbeaten Woodland Hills Taft in the City Section playoffs that
begin next week is going to be an overwhelming task.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think anybody can beat us when we play like this,"
All-City receiver Steve Smith said Friday night after the Toreadors,
ranked No. 5 by The Times, dismantled Lake Balboa Birmingham, 30-6,
to win the West Valley League championship and wrap up a No. 1
seeding for the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Taft (10-0, 5-0) gave up a touchdown on Birmingham's opening
possession, then didn't allow the host Patriots (7-3, 4-1) to come
close to scoring again. It was 48 minutes of focus and domination
against a team that might be the second-best in the City.</LD>
<TE>   For the 10th consecutive week, the Toreadors refused to allow a
ballcarrier to reach the 100-yard mark. This time, it was UCLA-bound
tailback Dennis Keyes facing the wrath of Taft's swarming defense. He
was limited to 86 yards. Quarterback Ryan Lombardo was sacked four
times and completed 12 of 24 passes for 125 yards with three
interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Taft's offense had 413 yards. Quarterback Cary Dove
completed 17 of 25 passes for 246 yards and one touchdown. Ian Bell
rushed for 78 yards and backup Litrele Jones had 66 yards.
Defensively, Eddie Lewis and Wallace Bates had two sacks each. Taft
had lost to Birmingham the last two years because of its failure to
stop the running game. Not this time.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the best feeling ever right now," All-City linebacker Lance
Broadus said. "They thought they were going to do a three-peat on us
and we had to prove them wrong."</TE>
<TE>   What makes Taft so imposing is its offensive speed and numerous
weapons. It's almost like watching a video game unfold before your
eyes, with Coach Troy Starr picking and choosing what to do. From
Dove's passing to Bell's running, from throwing to Steve Smith, Paul
Pratt or Noah Smith, the options are plentiful.</TE>
<TE>   Starr even added a new wrinkle Friday, the screen pass to the
fullback. Broadus caught the short pass and ran 31 yards for a
touchdown late in the second quarter to give Taft a 16-6 lead. Dove,
who's 6 feet 3 and 180 pounds, has gained 15 pounds since last
season. He scored on a one-yard run on the final play of the second
quarter, dragging a Birmingham defender into the end zone for a 23-6
halftime lead.</TE>

<DH>Moorpark is more competitive but loses again to Westlake,
20-14</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Bresnahan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Someday, Moorpark High will defeat Westlake Village Westlake in
football.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, the same used to be said of Moorpark defeating
Carpinteria in football, and it took 52 games for that losing streak
to end.</LD>
<LD>   Moorpark's drought against Westlake isn't nearly that long, but
the Musketeers on Friday night lost for the fifth consecutive year to
the Warriors -- and this one really hurt.</LD>
<TE>   Playing before an estimated 7,500, the largest crowd in Moorpark
history, Westlake (8-2) claimed its third Marmonte League football
championship in four years with a 20-14 victory. The Warriors, 7-0 in
league play, have won 28 of their last 29 league games.</TE>
<TE>   The upside for Moorpark, which finished the regular season 9-1,
6-1 in league: Well, at least it was close. Westlake had won the
previous four games between these programs by a combined score of
150-20.</TE>
<TE>   This time, it took a game-saving interception in the end zone in
27.8 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Starting from its own 19 with 1 minute 45 seconds left in the
game, Moorpark drove to the Westlake 14. But on third and 10, Eddie
Garcia's pass intended for Dennis Pitta was tipped by Westlake's
Michael Stuart and grabbed by Cody Cipriano.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't bat it down and give them another chance. We made a
play on it," Westlake Coach Jim Benkert said. "I'd hate to have had
them line up for one more play."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the way Garcia and Pitta had been connecting, one more
play might have been enough for Moorpark.</TE>
<TE>   Pitta, fast and rangy, had 13 receptions for 175 yards, including
four for 53 yards on Moorpark's last-ditch drive.</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark outgained Westlake, 357-230, but fell victim to three
turnovers -- two fumbles and the interception -- a safety and smart,
ball-control play by the Warriors, who got 104 yards and a touchdown
in 31 bruising carries by Merrill Mullaly.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly the Musketeers showed plenty of progress -- this game
and this season -- but that was of little consolation to Coach Tim
Lins.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't say we're happy with progress," he said. "We wanted to
win this game."</TE>
<TE>   And "we" meant just about everybody, school Principal Anna
Merriman among them.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the tears in her eyes after the game, she said: "We
share their pride and we share their pain.... My heart is just broken
for these kids."</TE>
<TE>   If nothing else, Moorpark showed that its top-rated defense -- the
Musketeers had allowed only 64 points this season before the game --
was no fluke and that it might be good enough to play deep into the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Westlake's Benkert, for one, thinks so. "This is a good football
program," he said of the Musketeers. "Coach Lins has done a good job
of building this thing from the ground up. They're obviously ready to
compete and obviously ready to win. I look for them to go a long
way."</TE>
<TE>   Going in, the Musketeers believed they still had plenty of
doubters.</TE>
<TE>   "You can sense it around the league -- it's like we shouldn't be
doing this well," Rob Dearborn, a former Moorpark football coach who
is now the school's athletic director, said a couple of days before
the game. "Everybody sees Moorpark like it was when I moved into the
area 20 years ago, as a train stop, a ranching community of a couple
thousand people."</TE>
<TE>   That train stop is now home to a population of nearly 33,000, but
Moorpark is still a one-high school town, and the campus is bursting
at the seams, having added 37 classrooms the last two years trying to
keep up with burgeoning enrollment.</TE>
<TE>   With the growth has come a measure of success in sports. Moorpark
won or shared four championships in its first four years in the
Marmonte League. But lagging behind, like a weighty caboose, has been
the football team.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, football at Moorpark has never been confused with Santa
Ana Mater Dei or Long Beach Poly. The Musketeers lost 46 consecutive
games from 1977 through 1982, one of the longest losing streaks in
Southern Section history.</TE>
<TE>   And there was that losing streak -- 51 in a row -- against
small-school power Carpinteria, a record of futility believed to be
unmatched in high school football.</TE>
<TE>   On occasion, good fortune smiled upon the football program, as it
did in 1997, when Moorpark finally defeated Carpinteria, 33-0,
prompting former coach Ron Wilford to say with relief, "There is a
God in Moorpark."</TE>
<TE>   The victory happened to be in a playoff semifinal, and a week
later, Moorpark defeated Santa Monica St. Monica to win its only
Southern Section football championship.</TE>
<TE>   But that was in Division X. A year later, Moorpark was moved up to
Division IV, where it has struggled against the traditional powers.</TE>
<TE>   Lins, soft-spoken and well-respected, is in his fourth season as
coach. He guided Encino Crespi to seven playoff berths from 1989-98
-- six of those coming in Division I -- and was an assistant at
Crespi in 1986 when the Celts became the only San Fernando Valley
team to win a football championship in the largest division.</TE>
<TE>   Lins, who has lived down the road from Moorpark High for nearly 20
years, snapped up the job when Wilford resigned, trading in the
pressure of guiding one of the most distinguished programs in the
Valley for the lower-stress, cozy-commute job at Moorpark.</TE>
<TE>   Wilford, who came back to Moorpark after two years as an assistant
at Pierce College, is in charge of a defense that doesn't scare many
people on paper.</TE>
<TE>   The Musketeers, led by 6-foot, 185-pound inside linebacker Wes
Pryor, are vastly undersized, with only three defensive starters
weighing more than 200 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   "You look at us and you say, 'How are we 9-0?' " Wilford said this
week. "We ask ourselves the same question as well."</TE>
<TE>   And now the Musketeers are asking, sadly, how are they 9-1 and
still without a championship?</TE>
<TE>   "We were this close," Lins told his team after the game, holding
his fingers about an inch apart.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is: How are we going to finish the season? We need
to get ready for next week."</TE>
<TE>   Ah, but at least there is a next week -- the playoffs -- this
year.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Those who liked Thunderello at 48-1 in the Breeders' Cup Sprint three
weeks ago will have to settle for a much shorter price on the
3-year-old Montbrook colt today.</LD>
<LD>   A hard-fought, half-length loser to favored Orientate at Arlington
Park in his first appearance in a graded stakes, Thunderello is the
likely favorite against seven other sprinters in the $300,000 Frank
J. DeFrancis Memorial Dash at Laurel Park in Maryland.</LD>
<LD>   One of his rivals in the DeFrancis, a Grade I stakes race, is
Avanzado, who has won three in a row since coming to the U.S. earlier
this year.</LD>
<TE>   Trained by Doug O'Neill for the Cees Stable, the 5-year-old
Argentine-bred won two races at Del Mar before shipping to Belmont
Park where he won the Forest Hills Handicap on Oct. 6.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Calder will offer an all-stakes pick four, starting
with the $150,000 Bonnie Heath Turf Cup Handicap at 1 1/8 miles on
the grass, then the $200,000 Elmer Heubeck Distaff Handicap at 1 1/16
miles, the $150,000 Jack Dudley Sprint Handicap at six furlongs and
the $200,000 Carl Rose Classic Handicap at 1 1/8 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Puxa Saco, who made a successful California debut
in the Anoakia at Santa Anita on Oct. 20, will bid for her fourth win
in five tries in the $100,000 Moccasin at seven furlongs at Hollywood
Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Richard Dutrow Jr. The trainer leads the Aqueduct
standings and won with 13 of his first 32 starters.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: The field in today's second at Golden Gate Fields. The
nine maiden claimers are a combined 0 for 101.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three with Binny's Trick in the sixth,
Miss Continental, Excessive Warrior and My Babycakes in the seventh
and Marshall Rooster, Studio Time, Don't Holler and Trilogy in the
seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Winners (through Thursday): Previous day/meet total: 1/11. Money:
Previous day/meet total: $7.20/$57.60. Total money bet: $114.</TE>

<DL>EDMONTON, Canada</DL>
<LD>One of the Kings' most highly regarded prospects was charged with
sexually assaulting and attacking a woman Wednesday morning in
Boston, where the club's top minor league team was celebrating rookie
initiation night.</LD>
<LD>   Joe Corvo, a 6-foot-1, 200-pound defenseman who was MVP last
season of the Kings' American Hockey League team at Manchester, N.H.,
pleaded not guilty to the felony charges at his arraignment in Boston
Municipal Court.</LD>
<LD>   Corvo, 25, is accused of grabbing a female patron's buttocks at a
downtown restaurant and lounge about 1:30 a.m., the Suffolk County
District Attorney's office spokesman told the Manchester
Union-Leader.</LD>
<TE>   Corvo was asked to leave the restaurant but returned a short time
later and punched the 34-year-old Boston woman in the face, the
police complaint said. The woman collapsed to the floor, where Corvo
kicked her several times before fleeing to a nearby pub, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Corvo was arrested and charged with one count each of indecent
assault and battery on a person at least 14 years old, assault and
battery with a dangerous weapon, his foot, and assault and battery.
Freed on $5,000 cash bail after his arraignment, he is scheduled to
return to court for a pretrial conference Nov. 25.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted of the indecent assault charge, Corvo could face up
to five years in state prison. If convicted of assault and battery
with a dangerous weapon, he could face up to 10 years in state
prison.</TE>
<TE>   King General Manager Dave Taylor declined comment, but the club
issued a statement.</TE>
<TE>   "The Kings and Monarchs wish to state that we hold our athletes to
a strict code of conduct and expect them to act professionally and
responsibly both on and off the ice," the statement read in part.
"Our respective organizations will be proactive in gathering the
relevant facts as they become known and any disciplinary action that
may stem from this will be an internal matter."</TE>
<TE>   Corvo was on the ice for Friday night's game at Manchester.</TE>

<HD>Murray Says He Feels Fine</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although Laker Coach Phil Jackson said Friday he believes Tracy
Murray hasn't fully recovered from "pretty major surgery" on his hip
in April, Murray said he's fine, even though he had tried merely nine
three-pointers in six games. "I don't think anybody in this league is
100%, but compared to last year, it's much better," Murray said. "My
hip is not locking up. I don't have my explosiveness back, like if I
tried to dunk, but I feel great."</LD>
<LD>   If anything has been difficult, he said, it's been dealing with
the team's early struggles, not any physical struggles of his own.</LD>
<LD>   "None of us like losing," Murray said. "We all have to step up.
We've got to play with the pride and heart of champions. It doesn't
matter if Shaq is here or not. Through difficult times, everybody has
got to pull together.</LD>
<TE>   "We can't point fingers, and we haven't gotten to that point.
That's what bad teams do. That's what I noticed -- this team doesn't
do that."</TE>
<TE>   He also said he can accept a reduced role, if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now my role's not very big," he said, "but if I'm not
playing I'm cheering the team. As a 10-year veteran, I understand my
role."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Forward Devean George, troubled by a painful right foot, underwent
an MRI exam and was told by Dr. Philip Kwong he has tendinitis. He
was not available Friday, and Jackson said George probably wouldn't
play Sunday against Houston. He will be evaluated on a game-by-game
basis.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Samaki Walker, who sustained a slight sprain of his left ankle in
Thursday's practice, was in the startling lineup. But Jackson said
the lineup at the end might not be the same as usual. "I told guys it
will be who's playing well in the ballgame," he said, "rather than
guys we had going down a lot of stretches."</TE>
<TE>   Walker played 41 minutes, including most of overtime, scored 12
points and had 12 rebounds in the 96-89 win.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal, targeting next Friday for his return from toe
surgery, said he hasn't had any kind of setback that would change his
plans.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Finally Stop Bleeding</HD>
<DH>L.A. ends losing streak at four games and avoids cellar
with 96-89 overtime victory over Warriors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>His upper lip was swollen and his speech thickened, but Kobe Bryant
didn't mind paying the price of a chipped tooth, bloodied mouth and
four stitches on the inside of his lip if it meant helping the Lakers
end their four-game losing streak.</LD>
<LD>   "I liked it," said Bryant, the victim of a mouth-to-forehead
collision with Antawn Jamison in the fourth quarter. "I think I
shoulda been a boxer. I get off on stuff like that. It feels good."</LD>
<LD>   It might not have felt so good if the Lakers hadn't held on for a
96-89 overtime victory over the Golden State Warriors before a
sellout crowd of 18,997 Friday at Staples Center. And in truth, it
was as ugly as Bryant's mouth, no matter that Bryant scored a
season-high 45 points on 18-for-40 shooting.</LD>
<TE>   "I hate overtime. I wanted to go home," said Robert Horry, who
scored seven of his nine points in the extra period, including a
three-point basket that gave the Lakers the lead for good and a
three-point play off a layup and flagrant foul.</TE>
<TE>   "It was my fault we went to overtime. I should have shot instead
of throwing the ball away."</TE>
<TE>   Golden State had erased a 10-point Laker fourth-quarter lead and
tied the game with 4.2 seconds left on a three-pointer by Jason
Richardson. Horry's subsequent errant pass set up the collision
between Bryant and Jamison with six-tenths of a second to play.</TE>
<TE>   The Warriors took a brief lead in overtime, but Horry, hobbled by
a bad heel and sore legs and sore temper, took charge.</TE>
<TE>   "We shouldn't have even gone to overtime," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But they did, and thanks to Horry, the Lakers (3-6) avoided the
indignity of a five-game losing streak and of dropping to last place
in the Pacific Division behind the Warriors (2-8).</TE>
<TE>   "We may need a couple of wheelchairs to play some of those guys
out there," said Laker Coach Phil Jackson, who never experienced a
five-game skid with the team but had one with the Michael Jordan-less
Bulls in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he was impressed by the team's late effort and saw reason
for optimism while the Lakers await the return next week of Shaquille
O'Neal, Jackson chose to see the pessimistic side.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw them lose a 10-point lead in the last four minutes of the
ballgame," he said. "A team as experienced as we are shouldn't do
that.... It was an effort we had to make in the fourth quarter. To
get a victory ultimately is what the struggle is all about."</TE>
<TE>   The operative word there being "struggle." The Lakers could never
shake the Warriors, who shot 36.6% from the floor, and their offense
was Kobe-heavy. Besides Horry's late exploits, the only other bright
spots were the 12 points and 14 rebounds collected by Samaki Walker,
and the 14 rebounds pulled down by Rick Fox.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said he wasn't hoping Bryant was his normal self after the
collision, "I was hoping he might not be his normal self in the sense
somebody else might take some shots. We needed somebody to step up
and at that point, nobody was meeting those demands."</TE>
<TE>   Said Bryant: "We just wanted to get a win. I think it's important
for the other guys to get some confidence. Samaki played well, and
Brian [Shaw] got some minutes. The important thing is to get their
confidence going."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson had said before the game that even though he knew Friday's
loser would occupy last place in the Pacific Division, it was too
early to worry about such things. If the fear of being last didn't
inspire the Lakers, it did seem to give impetus to the Warriors, who
hung tough in the third quarter and pulled ahead, 55-53, taking
advantage of a 3 1/2-minute silence by the Lakers' offense.</TE>
<TE>   Each time the Lakers seemed ready to pull away -- such as after a
dunk by Bryant gave them a 63-57 lead with 2:06 left in the third
quarter -- they sabotaged their own cause with poor defensive
rebounding, poor shooting and turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not feeling sorry for ourselves without Shaq," Walker said.
"We've been in these games and have the potential to win them and we
should. It's minor mistakes, turnovers, mental errors in the final
minutes that have cost us."</TE>
<TE>   Said Fox: "We wanted to stay in the present and think about this
team and not about how many games until Shaq comes back. We haven't
played like a championship team and we know it. Having a championship
emblem on our chests doesn't mean people are going to give it to us."</TE>

<LD>When the Lakers lost to the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday, it was the

in fashionable streetwear recovering from late-summer toe surgery.</TE>

<TE>   January: Commence occasional limping; express mild disappointment
that team has a 16-24 record in his absence.</TE>
<TE>   February: Launch non-contact, non-stress toe manipulation therapy
program.</TE>
<TE>   March: Announce return from off-season surgery on March 30, just
in time to play self into shape with 10 games remaining in season.</TE>

<TE>   Reading of another of Shaquille O'Neal's hostile responses to
comments about his weight leads me to suggest that he put a sock in
it -- perhaps prohibiting him from putting in it one or more of the
four club sandwiches he's said to consume before games.</TE>
<TE>   Shaq, news flash: It's not attractive, healthy or athletically
advantageous for you to weigh in the mid-300s. I'm little caring
about your attractiveness, somewhat concerned about your health and
more interested in your athletic performance. Reduce your weight to
around 300. See if you don't play better, harder and longer. See if
you don't play, at all.</TE>

<TE>   Chick would be so proud that Shaq waited until his summer cop job
was finished before getting his operation.</TE>
<TE>   Chick would be so proud of Mitch Kupchak for thinking the best
players for Laker fans to enjoy are Samaki Walker, Devean George and
Soumaila Samake.</TE>

<TE>   I, for one, do not like reading about athletes and writers who use
injuries as an excuse for nonperformance. Tim Brown's write-up of the
Lakers' loss to the Washington Wizards seemed to do just that.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Devean George did have two achy ankles and maybe Robert
Horry did have a sore left heel and sore right foot. As a fan, you
don't want to hear excuses from these high-paid professionals.
George, Horry and Phil Jackson simply got out-thought and
outmaneuvered by a well-designed play by the Wizards.</TE>

<LD>Separate Team Game From Individual Award</LD>
<LD>   It is ridiculous that although Alex Rodriguez had a better
all-around season than anyone in the majors, Miguel Tejada took MVP
honors simply because he played on a better team. The reason Tejada's
A's made it to the postseason was because they had the best pitching
staff in the American League.</LD>
<LD>   Imagine how truly abysmal the last-place Rangers would have been
without A-Rod's 57 homers and 142 RBIs.</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps in the future, the Baseball Writers Assn. of America could
avoid these obvious injustices if, instead of most valuable player,
they either called it the Best Player on the Best Team Award or,
preferably, the Best Player in the League. In which case, Rodriguez
would have won the award hands-down.</TE>

clear that Mr. Sterling doesn't care whether the Clippers win or
lose, and obviously doesn't care about being the laughingstock of the

<LD>I see where the Thousand Oaks City Council awarded UCLA football
Coach Bob Toledo the key to the city. I didn't realize that
mediocrity was acknowledged with such rewards. My first inclination

<TE>   Fifty years ago, when I was a boy, I asked my dad which was the
best team in college football. His answer was, "On which Saturday?"</TE>
<TE>   Nothing has changed. Anyone who follows I-AA football knows how
great real playoffs and real champions are. Sometimes a lower seed is
the best team. With greed and ignorance running I-A, we'll never know
who the best team really is. Each year there are half a dozen teams
that have a legitimate shot to win but are not even considered. There
will never be a Cinderella story while the NCAA (read corporate
money) sends out the invitations.</TE>

<LD>Why all the befuddlement at the dismal attendance at the women's
tennis championships at Staples Center? There are three reasons for
the paltry turnout -- prices, prices and prices!</LD>
<LD>   The cheapest seats within the same ZIP code as the court sold for
$50. Add to that the $15 for parking, and it's obvious that this
event was priced to exclude all but the ultra-rich or those with
connections.</LD>
<LD>   If Staples Center set the prices, it should be excluded from
consideration for all future tennis events. Instead of being a
supreme showcase, this tournament was an embarrassment to the game of
tennis.</LD>

have been better used for the women's Gold Cup soccer tournament.
Instead of a few people nice and warm inside Staples, there were
thousands of screaming fans ignoring the cold, rain, wind and fog to
cheer on the U.S. women at the Rose Bowl.</TE>

<LD>I'm not a horse racing snob but I definitely enjoy the sights and
sounds of live horse racing. It's 10 times more appealing than the
constant clanging of bells in a casino.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, in response to the recent Breeders' Cup scandal, where some
marginally intelligent frat brothers cooked up a past-posting scheme
on an unsecured tote system, Hollywood Park decided it would no
longer allow bettors to replace their bets when a horse is scratched.</LD>
<LD>   Decisions like this will only alienate those who genuinely enjoy
live racing. Greed and the desire for big dollars through off-track
betting may create greater profits and more gambling but they detract
from the spirit of horse racing.</LD>

<LD>Stick by your Constitutional rights, Hootie Johnson, and you will get
plenty of male support to maintain Augusta as it is. Maybe it's time
to form a National Council of Men's Organizations to counter Martha
Burk and her National Council of Women's Organizations. What are Burk
and her girls doing for the women of Afghanistan, where real needs
exist?</LD>

<TE>   Is anyone else out there sick of reading about Ms. Burk's asinine
efforts to gain membership at Augusta National for a few token rich
women? If Ms. Burk could enlighten us as to how her efforts will help
solve some of the major problems encountered by women in the U.S. and
around the world, my wife and I will be the first to picket outside
the gates of Augusta.</TE>
<TE>   Ed and Jane Brooks</TE>

<TE>   Augusta National, like any private social group, has every right
to restrict its membership to those persons deemed acceptable by the
current members and the bylaws. It doesn't mean that they're
anti-female, it simply means that they're all-male. I belong to a
local organization which is also all-male, but I don't believe
there's a single misogynist in the group.</TE>
<TE>   Because Martha Burk is chairwoman of the National Council of
Women's Organizations, it would be interesting to know how many men
sit on her board of directors.</TE>

<TE>   That man Hootie says, "I seldom have any regrets, I don't look
back much." Well, I could amputate the majority of fingers on one
hand and still represent the African American membership at Augusta.
I could then turn around and hack off the remaining fingers on that
one hand and represent the female membership at Augusta. All male,
all white, and all rich.</TE>
<TE>   Don't look back much? Why would he? At Augusta, it still looks
very much like the past.</TE>
<TE>   D.A. Jones</TE>
<TE>   Fresno</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a woman, I'm ashamed of Ms. Burk's organization, which does not
represent most of the women of America. As a golfer, I am proud of
the example of excellence each year in Augusta. This lady's
politically correct agenda threatens an institution. Who's
intolerant?</TE>
<TE>   Neva McMurray</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After losing his first four races, two at 11-10 odds, Red Hot Blitzer
is on a roll.</LD>
<LD>   The 2-year-old gelded son of Red Hot Rhythm has won three in a row
and will try to keep the streak alive in tonight's $35,000 Corona
Chick Handicap, to be run at 400 yards.</LD>
<LD>   Red Hot Blitzer, owned by Evelyn Stark and trained by Paul Jones,
hasn't lost since Aug. 1. He broke his maiden on Aug. 25, then won
two allowance races and now will try to stretch his speed over an
additional 50 yards.</LD>
<TE>   Red Hot Blitzer will carry co-high weight of 125 pounds, as will
Special Cartel, a recent stakes winner at Lone Star Park for co-owner
and trainer Jose Antonio Flores. Dennis Means will ride the gelded
son of Corona Cartel, who broke his maiden in his first start April
11 at Los Alamitos.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Highly Rated. 2. Modern World. 3. First Dashatac. 4.
Fleet Year. 5. Bf Pretty Woman. 6. Miss Sky Dasher. 7. Miss Curley
Lite. 8. Juvimiss. 9. India Lee. 10. Red Hot Blitzer. 11. First Down
Devil.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Highly Rated, Chase A Blurr and Mighty Smooth Dash in
the first, single Modern World in the second, use First Dashatac,
Wanna Dash Again and Draw Down in the third and Good Presentation,
Fleet Year and Northern Sleet in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Pritzi Fast should improve second time out in
the sixth after breaking slowly against better competition. Raise
King is properly spotted in the ninth after breaking his maiden last
month.</TE>
<TE>   Post time: 6:30 p.m.</TE>

<HD>Even Brown's Influence Can't Help Grizzlies Yet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two days of practice under the direction of Hubie Brown weren't
enough for the Memphis Grizzlies to reverse their losing ways.</LD>
<LD>   Wally Szczerbiak scored six of his 22 points in the last two
minutes at Memphis, Tenn., to spoil Brown's return to coaching as
Minnesota defeated Memphis, 99-95, handing the Grizzlies their ninth
consecutive loss.</LD>
<LD>   "We asked a lot," said Hubie Brown, who returned to coaching after
16 years away. "We're very happy with what they did in two days and
how they accepted the hard work."</LD>
<TE>   Brown began working with the Grizzlies on Wednesday, one day after
former coach Sidney Lowe resigned with Memphis the only winless team
in the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   Memphis (0-9) trailed by only one point when Szczerbiak made a
three-point basket with 28 seconds left to give the Timberwolves a
97-93 lead. It was Minnesota's only three-pointer.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Garnett led the Timberwolves with 28 points. Gordan Giricek
led Memphis with 25 points, and Drew Gooden had 18.</TE>
<TE>   The Grizzlies were tougher on defense than they have been for much
of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Memphis point guard Jason Williams, criticized for slacking off on
defense, often picked up his man in the backcourt. "That's the first
time I ever played defense like that in my whole career," Williams
said. "It's not like I can't do it. It's either do it or sit on the
bench and I don't like sitting on the bench."</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 88, Houston 87 -- Stephon Marbury scored 10 of his 20
points in the fourth quarter, including a layup with 6.3 seconds left
that gave the Suns a victory at Phoenix. Shawn Marion scored 27 and
Penny Hardaway was two rebounds shy of a triple-double as the Suns
won their fourth in a row. Marbury's game-winner was the only basket
for either team in the last 2:02.</TE>
<TE>   Yao Ming scored in double figures for the first time in the NBA
with 10 points on five-for-six shooting in 14 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 111, Sacramento 97 -- Desmond Mason had 20 points and tied
a career-high with 17 rebounds, leading six players in double figures
for the SuperSonics at Seattle. At 7-2, the Sonics are off to their
best start since opening 9-2 in 1999-2000. The Kings, already missing
point guard Mike Bibby (foot) and reserve forward Scot Pollard
(back), didn't have sharp-shooting Peja Stojakovic, who sat out
because of a strained foot tendon.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 84, Denver 79 -- Voshon Lenard scored 19 points and
Antonio Davis had 18, the two combining for the Raptors' final 12
points as at Toronto. After Davis' two free throws cut Denver's lead
to two, Lenard made a three-pointer to give Toronto the lead for good
with 1:47 left.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 103, Milwaukee 100 -- Ron Artest scored 22 points and made
the game-winning three-point play in overtime as the Pacers remained
unbeaten at Indianapolis. With the Pacers trailing 100-99, Artest had
the ball in the low right post. He spun around Ray Allen, tossed up a
leaning, one-handed shot and went crashing to the floor as the ball
went through.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 93, Miami 84 -- Jason Kidd scored 33 points and made
two pivotal plays midway through the second half to lead the Nets at
Miami. The Heat has lost four in a row and is 1-6, its worst start in
eight seasons.</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans 105, Chicago 87 -- Baron Davis and David Wesley scored
22 points apiece as the Hornets improved to 6-0 in their new home.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 86, Utah 75 -- Richard Hamilton scored 25 points as the
Pistons improved to 4-0 at Auburn Hills, Mich.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The Dallas Mavericks stayed unbeaten because Dirk Nowitzki kept
connecting and Shawn Bradley kept the Boston Celtics from the basket.</LD>
<LD>   Nowitzki scored a season-high 32 points and the 7-foot-6 Bradley
blocked five shots and changed many others as the Mavericks won 97-86
Friday night to improve to 9-0.</LD>
<LD>   Bradley didn't start because of an upset stomach, but played 36
minutes and made all four of his shots .</LD>
<TE>   "Bradley was sensational," Dallas Coach Don Nelson said. "I told
him he needs to get food poisoning again."</TE>
<TE>   The Celtics (6-3) had their winning streak end at six as Paul
Pierce scored only nine points and Antoine Walker had only four of
his 22 in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "It was hard but we made it harder on ourselves," Pierce said.
"The zone really bothered us."</TE>
<TE>   So did Nowitzki.</TE>
<TE>   "He gets out and runs the floor well," Walker said. "He's very
aggressive in transition. That's when he looks for his shot."</TE>
<TE>   The win was the Mavericks' sixth by 10 or more points as they
became only the sixth team in 19 years to start 9-0 or better.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fun," Nowitzki said. "We know the streak is going to end
sooner or later, but then we'll just try to start another one."</TE>
<TE>   If the Mavericks defeat New Jersey on Saturday and the Lakers on
Tuesday, they would be the first team to go 11-0 since Atlanta and
the Lakers both reached that mark in 1997-98.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley felt weak but didn't have to move much in Dallas' 2-3 zone
defense.</TE>
<TE>   "The plan was to play two to three minute spurts," he said, but
"it seemed to go OK."</TE>
<TE>   The Celtics' last lead was 16-15, but they cut the deficit to
76-70 with 8:35 left on consecutive 3-pointers by Walker and Tony
Delk.</TE>
<TE>   The Mavericks regained control with a 10-0 run that made it 86-70
with 6:16 left. Michael Finley started it with a three-point basket,
Nowitzki made two jumpers and Walt Williams ended it with a
three-pointer.</TE>

<LD>Tony Stewart made things even tougher for Mark Martin.</LD>
<LD>   Winston Cup points leader Stewart qualified sixth Friday for the
season-ending Ford 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway in Homestead,
Fla., while Martin -- the only other driver with a shot at the
championship -- will start 34th in the 43-car field. Kurt Busch won
the pole.</LD>
<LD>   Stewart leads Martin by 89 points and can clinch his first title
by finishing 22nd or better in Sunday's race, no matter what Martin
does.</LD>
<TE>   More bad news for Martin: Stewart won two of the three previous
races at the track after starting seventh and 13th.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a good lap," Stewart said. "We're normally bad to the bone
on Sunday here and our car is really, really good in race trim, so
I'm pretty excited about Sunday now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bliss capped his return to NASCAR's truck series by winning
the championship at Homestead-Miami Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Hornaday, a former truck series champion, won the Ford 200 in
a Chevrolet entered only this once as a teammate to Bliss.</TE>
<TE>   Polesitter Bliss finished fifth to win his first title, beating
Rick Crawford by 46 points. Ted Musgrave finished second in the race
in a Dodge, and wound up third in the standings.</TE>

<TE>   Bruno Junqueira, in a Lola-Toyota, guaranteed a front-row start
for Sunday's Mexico Grand Prix -- the final CART event this season --
by leading the first day of qualifying with an average speed of
116.703 mph at Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   Lleyton Hewitt has the No. 1 ranking. He also has a semifinal
berth at the season-ending Masters Cup, thanks to Carlos Moya.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt, the defending champion in the eight-man tournament,
advanced to the semifinals when Moya outlasted French Open champion
Albert Costa, 7-6 (7), 3-6, 6-4, at Shanghai, China. If Costa had
won, Hewitt's season would have been over.</TE>
<TE>   The last semifinal spot went to Juan Carlos Ferrero, who defeated
Jiri Novak, 7-5, 6-3. The round-robin portion of the tournament ended
when Switzerland's Roger Federer beat Thomas Johansson, 6-3, 7-5.</TE>
<TE>   Figure Skating</TE>
<TE>   American skater Sasha Cohen got off to a shaky start in Paris in
her quest for a second Grand Prix victory.</TE>
<TE>   The 18-year-old completed a solid triple lutz-double toe loop jump
during the short program at the Lalique Trophy, but then fell on a
much easier double axel. She is in second after the short program
behind Japan's Yoshie Onda. Sarah Meier of Switzerland is third.</TE>
<TE>   Golf</TE>
<TE>   The teams of Hale Irwin-Tom Kite and Mark O'Meara-Tom Watson won

<HD>Victory in Court Exacts a Price From Steinberg</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Show him the money!</LD>
<LD>   A Los Angeles jury awarded NFL super-agent Leigh Steinberg $44.6
million in damages Friday after ruling that his former business
partner, David Dunn, conspired to heist his high-profile clients.</LD>
<LD>   Steinberg, for years viewed as an idealist who brought a human
touch to an otherwise soulless industry, now has a courtroom victory
-- and a shredded reputation.</LD>
<TE>   There was a time Steinberg was the most powerful agent in
football. Almost every quarterback of consequence was a client, among
them Troy Aikman, Warren Moon, Steve Young and Drew Bledsoe. ESPN
would set up shop in his offices on draft day, and invariably he'd be
there entertaining the top college prospect and the player's family.
He had Aikman endow a scholarship at UCLA and Young do the same at
Brigham Young. He was all about the people. He cared.</TE>
<TE>   That was his image, one he had cultivated since his days as
student-body president at Cal, when he set out to reshape one small
corner of the sports world. In the aftermath of a remarkably messy
trial, it's hard to tell what's sincere and what's a sham.</TE>
<TE>   Is Steinberg the man who put character above everything or the
binge drinker who took credit for the achievements of everyone around
him? Is he the consummate protector who fought to educate the
football world about concussions or the bumbler who once fell down
drunk in a hotel lobby and told a male employee: "I want to eat your
leg"?</TE>
<TE>   Is he neither? Or both?</TE>
<TE>   "Did I have a drinking problem? Yeah, I did, and I conquered it,"
Steinberg said. "But so did George Bush, and he's running the
country."</TE>
<TE>   The empire Steinberg now runs is significantly smaller than it
once was. He has 26 players, down from a high of 90. He still has
some household names -- Ricky Williams, Edgerrin James, Kordell
Stewart, Mark Brunell -- but he may never have a Sunday like the one
a few years ago, when 14 of the quarterbacks playing that afternoon
were his clients. He no longer scares the competition.</TE>
<TE>   "Would I worry about going up against him for a player? Never,"
one agent said. "There was a time I would."</TE>
<TE>   When Steinberg talks about his post-verdict future, he talks about
a smaller, more manageable business. Ninety clients is too many, he
says now, a much better size is 40 or 45. He speaks of getting back
to his roots, back to his days fresh out of Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an aspect of this that's fun and challenging and
invigorating," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His longtime business partner, Jeff Moorad, says the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   "Our commitment to serve our athletes is as strong as it's ever
been," Moorad said.</TE>
<TE>   For Steinberg, the challenge is hanging onto the clients he has
and rehabilitating his image enough to attract more. He was in Miami
on Friday, helping Dolphin running back Williams with his charity.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never claimed to be a perfect human being, nor do I think
anyone else is who represents athletes," Steinberg said. "But when it
comes to the representation of athletes, for 27 years our clients
have gotten the absolute best."</TE>
<TE>   There's no denying Steinberg's image is seriously wounded. And he
probably won't see that mountain of cash. Most of the money will go
to Assante Corp., parent company of Steinberg &amp; Moorad Sports
Management. What the verdict does, more than anything, is send the
message that a renegade employee can't destabilize an agency by
walking away with all the cornerstone clients.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Steinberg won Friday, the trial represents a
devastating loss. Or, in the words of fellow NFL agent James Gould:
"If you believe what you're fighting for is worth it, sometimes
you've got to get naked in front of the world. Welcome to your $44
million."</TE>
<TE>   Spinning His Wheels</TE>
<TE>   Marcellus Wiley, a Pro Bowl defensive end for the San Diego
Chargers, has made some big plays this season -- including stripping
the ball from Marshall Faulk last Sunday when the St. Louis running
back was about to score -- but he's stuck on four sacks. Wiley, who
attended St. Monica High, reached double digits in sacks the last two
seasons. He's coming off a groin injury that kept him out of three
games. Still, it frustrates him that sacks are only trickling in.</TE>
<TE>   "You kind of rev your engine up and you're staying in park," he
said. "You feel like you went zero to 60, but all you did was rev the
RPM up and make a lot of noise."</TE>
<TE>   Thinking Inside the Box</TE>
<TE>   Could the Arena Football League wind up, say, replacing NFL
Europe? It isn't a bad idea, considering the indoor game doesn't need
as large a crowd to pack a house, and the up-tempo version might be
more appealing to fans who didn't grow up watching the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   "If 15,000 people show up at an NFL game, it's an embarrassment,"
AFL Commissioner David Baker said. "If 15,000 people come to an arena
game, it's a party."</TE>
<TE>   Baker and Casey Wasserman, owner of the L.A. Avengers, as well as
other AFL executives, stopped by The Times for lunch Friday with a
group of editors and writers.</TE>
<TE>   Around the League</TE>
<TE>   AFC EAST -- In a Q&amp;A that ran Friday in The Times, Joe Namath
intimated that the New York Jets, who have the league's highest
payroll, are overpaying some players. And he's right. For instance,
running back Curtis Martin is the NFL's second-highest-paid player
this season, making $13.5 million, yet he's in danger of falling
short of 1,000 yards rushing for the first time in his career. Martin
has 463 yards in 124 carries, ranking him 30th among running
backs.... Romantic fool, that Chad Pennington. He took his playbook
along on his honeymoon cruise so he could study the West Coast
offense as he and his bride toured the Caribbean. The dedication is
paying off. The third-year quarterback has led the Jets to
consecutive victories, and the team has gone from an all-but-kaput
1-4 to 4-5 and a game out of first place in the division.
Pennington's success has to make Bill Parcells feel good. Parcells
might be a great coach, but a lot of people think he's only an
average judge of talent. He had 31 picks from 1997 through '99, and
only four are still on the Jet roster.</TE>
<TE>   AFC NORTH -- The good news for folks in Cincinnati is Sunday's
game against Cleveland is sold out. The bad news is it's just the
eighth sellout in 21 games since the opening of Paul Brown Stadium.
Three of those sellouts were for Brown games, three for Steeler
games. The other two sellouts -- against Chicago and Tennessee last
season -- were due to walk-up crowds.... Heinz Field is a beautiful
stadium, but the grass playing surface is sub-par. That has Steeler
owner Dan Rooney mulling a switch to artificial turf, perhaps
FieldTurf, which is used in the new stadiums in Seattle and Detroit.
Eleven NFL teams, including the Steelers, use it for their practice
fields.... Pittsburgh linebacker Joey Porter on how Atlanta was able
to overcome a 17-point deficit in the fourth quarter and ultimately
walk away with a tie: "I can't put my thumb on it." That's OK, Joey,
we'll settle for a finger.</TE>
<TE>   AFC SOUTH -- Indianapolis running back Edgerrin James missed the
last two games because of a hamstring injury. So he was on the
sideline last Sunday when little-known James Mungro made his NFL
debut against Philadelphia, rushing for 114 yards and two touchdowns.
But James is itching to get back for a lot of reasons. For one, he
earns a $1.38-million bonus if he reaches 1,000 yards rushing. He
needs 477 more, which works out to $2,893 per remaining yard. In
other words, move over Mungro.... In their first five games, the
Tennessee Titans ventured into the red zone 14 times and scored 12
touchdowns (85.7%). In their last four games, they've only scored six
touchdowns in 17 red-zone opportunities (35.3%). But here's the
strange part: The Titans started 1-4 and, even though their red-zone
percentages have nose-dived, have won their last four....
Jacksonville plays at Houston on Sunday, meaning Jaguar Coach Tom
Coughlin will be matched against his former defensive coordinator,
Dom Capers, and offensive coordinator, Chris Palmer. Capers is coach
of the Texans, and Palmer is their offensive coordinator. Those three
men were the first head coaches for the last four expansion teams:
Capers (Carolina, Houston), Palmer (Cleveland) and Coughlin
(Jacksonville).</TE>
<TE>   AFC WEST -- The Denver Broncos are starting to hate Mondays. And
can you blame them? During their two Monday night appearances this
season, the Broncos have been outscored, 52-10, in the first half and
68-33 overall.... He might be the best tight end in the business, but
Kansas City's Tony Gonzalez was limited to one catch for six yards at
San Francisco. Gonzalez griped he was being held by 49er linebacker
Julian Peterson. The complaints resonated with Chief Coach Dick
Vermeil, who said of Gonzalez, "People grab and hold him so much
coming off the line of scrimmage. It's not called, and [officials]
will say, 'Well, he's not the primary receiver.' And I'll say, 'He
might have been, or he very well could have been.' " The league might
fine Gonzalez for shooting off his mouth, but, with his $10-million
signing bonus, he can afford it.... Jerry Rice is taking pains to
respect the territory of Tim Brown, the focal point of Oakland's
offense before Rice crossed the bay. "He knows the offense in and
out, and he's the type to basically keep everybody pretty level,"
said Rice, who leads the team with 60 catches for 781 yards with five
touchdowns. "Me, I have a lot of years of experience, but I can get a
little hot at times. He's the captain of the ship." Maybe so, but as
long as Brown has 10 fewer catches and three fewer touchdowns than
Rice, it ain't the Love Boat.</TE>
<TE>   NFC EAST -- In speaking with Indianapolis reporters this week,
Dallas Coach Dave Campo was especially chatty. "Is it cold up there?"
he asked on a conference call. "It's a little nippy down here. Matter
of fact, it's real cold in this building. They're shutting the heat
off on us." And all that implies.... Tiki Barber leads the Giants in
rushing yards (672) and receptions (47). The last Giant to lead the
team in both categories at the end of the season was Joe Dawkins in
1974.... Philadelphia's defense racked up 24 sacks for minus 138
yards in the Eagles' last three wins. In losses to Tennessee,
Jacksonville and Indianapolis, they collected a total of two sacks
for minus 2 yards.</TE>
<TE>   NFC NORTH -- For the third time this season, Green Bay safety
Marques Anderson was selected the league's defensive rookie of the
week. He returned an interception for a touchdown against Detroit
last Sunday, having already scored on an errant Joey Harrington pass
earlier in the season. Anderson, a former UCLA standout whose
successes were chronicled in this space last week, is a leading
candidate for defensive rookie of the year, especially now that
Carolina's Julius Peppers is serving a four-game suspension for
testing positive for a banned substance.... Not a happy homecoming
for Detroit receiver Bill Schroeder, an former Packer who dropped
three passes in his first return to Lambeau Field last Sunday. The
second pass glanced off his hands and was picked off by Anderson. The
final gaffe: A ball slipped right through Schroeder's grasp in the
end zone on the last play of the game, a would-be cosmetic touchdown
in a 40-14 laugher. "That was one of the most embarrassing days of my
career," said Schroeder, who played for the Packers from 1997 through
last season.</TE>
<TE>   NFC SOUTH -- New Orleans quarterback Aaron Brooks is gaining a
reputation as one of the league's best closers. When the Saints came
from behind to beat Carolina last Sunday, it was the eighth
fourth-quarter comeback of Brooks' career. And it was the fifth time
he has orchestrated a game-winning drive on his team's final
offensive series. "He's done that since he's been in the league," New
Orleans Coach Jim Haslett said. "He doesn't get rattled." ... On the
flip side is Carolina, which has lost five games this season after
leading in the fourth quarter. So surrendering 14 points to the
Saints in the final 31 seconds was nothing new for the Panthers. The
club won't be hiring any sports psychologists to lecture the players,
though. "You could bring in psychologists until the cows come home,"
quarterback Rodney Peete told reporters. "It's definitely a mental
game, don't get me wrong. You have to have the mental toughness to
play this game and be able to find a way to go a little bit extra in
the fourth quarter to make those plays.... But until every person
looks themselves in the mirror and says, 'Look, I'm going to get it
done,' that psychologist isn't going to be able to penetrate
anybody."</TE>
<TE>   NFC WEST -- Seattle receiver Darrell Jackson, who suffered
seizures in the locker room last month after absorbing a
helmet-to-helmet hit against Dallas, has not returned to full-speed
action. He practiced a bit this week, but the Seahawks don't expect
him back in full until next week at earliest.... After botching a
snap on the Seahawks' 10-yard line during a 27-6 loss last Sunday,
Arizona center Jason Starkey attributed the miscue to a sprinkler
head that snagged the ball. The Cardinals have lost three in a row.
"If we don't start winning, I'll be in charge of watering that
field," Coach Dave McGinnis said, only half-joking. "I'll need to
know where those sprinkler heads are."</TE>

<HD>Dolphins' Carter Out of Hospital</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Miami Dolphin receiver Cris Carter was released from a hospital on
Friday and watched his team practice for the first time since being
sidelined because of kidney problems.</LD>
<LD>   Carter, who had been hospitalized since Nov. 9, said he hopes to
begin practicing within two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm feeling a lot better," Carter said. "We're going to take it
slow. I need my kidneys to recover."</LD>
<TE>   A variety of factors, including fatigue, dehydration and flu,
contributed to the kidney problems, Carter said.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Dave Wannstedt is targeting the Dolphins' Dec. 1 game at
Buffalo for Carter's return.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good to see him out of the hospital and with a smile on his
face. We'll probably have another meeting with the doctors on Monday
or Tuesday," Wannstedt said. "But we're optimistic."</TE>
<TE>   Carter's teammates were surprised by Carter's presence at
practice.</TE>
<TE>   "He brought a smile to everyone's face when he came out there,"
said James McKnight, who replaced Carter in the starting lineup.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   All-pro running back Marshall Faulk might return to practice today
with the St. Louis Rams hoping his injured legs will feel good enough
for him to play Monday night against the Chicago Bears.</TE>
<TE>   Faulk didn't practice Friday, but Coach Mike Martz said he was
making progress. Faulk, listed as questionable for the game, ended up
watching practice after doing some running on a treadmill.</TE>
<TE>   "He did quite a bit, actually, just to see where he was and get
some cardiovascular training going," Martz said. "He's still got a
little bit of soreness."</TE>
<TE>   Faulk sprained his right ankle and strained a tendon in his left
foot last Sunday against San Diego. The ankle is more of an issue
than the foot.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little pessimistic about it, but we'll just see," Martz
said. "If he's ready, he's ready. We've been through this before, and
Marshall is always very optimistic about these things."</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Lamar Gordon will start if Faulk, who has missed seven
games in eight-plus seasons in the NFL, isn't able to play.</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Warner, who will be the backup quarterback to Marc Bulger
against the Bears, handled scout team duties Friday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis Colt running back Edgerrin James went through a full
practice and is expected to play Sunday against the Dallas Cowboys.</TE>
<TE>   James missed the last two games because of a strained hamstring
and torn rib cartilage.</TE>
<TE>   "He did well," Coach Tony Dungy said. "He said that he feels well.
He's running well, so right now it looks optimistic."</TE>
<TE>   James, who missed most of last season with a knee injury, likely
will share time with backup James Mungro.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore Raven Coach Brian Billick is expected to make a
game-time decision on whether linebacker Ray Lewis will play against
the Miami Dolphins this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis was upgraded to questionable. The all-pro has missed five
straight games because of a partially left dislocated shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   "Ray had a good week. We'll see how he is come Sunday," Billick
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis participated in practice Thursday and a walkthrough Friday
but said his shoulder was sore.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dallas Cowboy offensive lineman Larry Allen won't play Sunday at
Indianapolis, missing his fourth consecutive game because of an
injured left ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Dave Campo, speaking after practice, would not address
Allen's status beyond Sunday. There have been strong indications that
if the seven-time all-pro didn't play this week he would have
season-ending surgery.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay rookie running back Travis Stephens was put on injured
reserve because of a dislocated left big toe.</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers filled the roster spot by signing defensive tackle
DeVone Claybrooks from the practice squad.</TE>

<LD>SAM FARMER'S NFL RANKINGS AND COMMENTS:</LD>
<TE>*--*
Rank  Team (rec.)          Comment (last week's rank)
1     GREEN BAY (8-1)      Packers have won 20 in a row when leading
                           at halftime. (1)
2     SAN FRANCISCO (7-2)  Niners have an NFL-low eight turnovers. (3)
3     NEW ORLEANS (7-2)    Last time they played Atlanta, Saints gave
                           up 260 yards rushing. (6)
4     TAMPA BAY (7-2)      After a week off, Buccaneers are as
                           healthy as they've been all season. (7)
5     DENVER (6-3)         With Trevor Pryce nursing a sore knee,
                           Broncos had no pass pressure. (2)
6     SAN DIEGO (6-3)      Demoralizing loss at St. Louis could take
                           its toll on Chargers. (5)
7     PITTSBURGH (5-3-1)   Steeler defense can't seem to stop anyone
                           on third down. 8)
8     NEW ENGLAND (5-4)    Taking the Oakland crowd out of things
                           early will be key. (9)
9     PHILADELPHIA (6-3)   Eagle offense is stuck in neutral. (4)
10    ATLANTA (5-3-1)      Michael Vick has one interception in 205
                           attempts. (11)
11    ST. LOUIS (4-5)      Marc Bulger has one more glorious week
                           before it's back to the bench. (13)
12    OAKLAND (5-4)        Finally winning in Denver was a huge
                           morale boost. (16)
13    BUFFALO (5-4)        Bills are allowing a staggering 29.9
                           points a game. (10)
14    KANSAS CITY (4-5)    Priest Holmes has scored a touchdown in
                           seven consecutive games. (12)
15    MIAMI (5-4)          Jay Fiedler's thumb cast is off, but he's
                           probably out until early December. (14)
16    TENNESSEE (5-4)      Titans haven't been able to score in the
                           red zone lately. (15)
17    INDIANAPOLIS (5-4)   Will the transgressions of Jim Irsay
                           become a distraction? (20)
18    N.Y. JETS (4-5)      The biggest change in the Jets is the
                           run-defense resurgence. (22)
19    N.Y. GIANTS (5-4)    Kerry Collins has played better since Jim
                           Fassel began calling plays. (24)
20    BALTIMORE (4-5)      Looks as if Jeff Blake will keep his QB
                           job for the foreseeable future. (21)
21    JACKSONVILLE (4-5)   Think Tom Coughlin liked sticking it to
                           Steve Spurrier? (23)
22    WASHINGTON (4-5)     LaVar Arrington has six sacks in five
                           games, and eight overall. (17)
23    CLEVELAND (4-5)      Browns still in playoff hunt, but a loss
                           to Bengals would be crushing. (25)
24    ARIZONA (4-5)        Jake Plummer has five of his 20 comeback
                           victories vs. Eagles. (19)
25    SEATTLE (3-6)        Seahawks have all but run out of
                           linebackers. (28)
26    DETROIT (3-6)        Lions reached double digits for dropped
                           balls against Green Bay. (18)
27    CAROLINA (3-6)       Suspension of Julius Peppers slams the
                           door on this season. (26)
28    DALLAS (3-6)         Offensive line has been a joke, a cruel
                           one. (27)
29    CHICAGO (2-7)        From bad to worse: Now WR David Terrell is
                           out for the season. (30)
30    MINNESOTA (2-7)      Upset alert: Packers have lost seven of
                           nine at Metrodome. (29)
31    CINCINNATI (1-8)     Aw, what the heck -- why not guarantee a
                           victory over Cleveland. (32)
32    HOUSTON (2-7)        By beating Jacksonville, Texans can
                           actually sweep a series. (31)</TE>

<HD>Hurricanes Earn Tie With Flyers, 1-1</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jesse Boulerice scored his first NHL goal and point against his
former team as the Carolina Hurricanes tied the Philadelphia Flyers,
1-1, Friday night at Raleigh, N.C.</LD>
<LD>   The Flyers ended Carolina's three-game winning streak. Still, the
Hurricanes improved to 4-0-2-1 seven games into their nine-game
homestand and have points in 11 of 12 games.</LD>
<LD>   The overtime loss at the RBC Center was 2-1 to the Flyers 10 days
ago. Since then, Philadelphia is 0-2-2.</LD>
<TE>   Paul Ranheim hit the crossbar with 14:15 left as the Flyers
pressed for the go-ahead goal early in the third but couldn't cash in
against Kevin Weekes, who has given up only 15 goals in his last nine
starts.</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy Roenick scored Philadelphia's only goal on its first shot,
but the Flyers were 0 for 3 on the power play and have gone scoreless
in 22 consecutive chances.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 3, Buffalo 2 -- Alexander Mogilny scored goals 2:13 apart
at Buffalo, N.Y., as the Maple Leafs extended the Sabres' winless
streak to 10 games.</TE>
<TE>   Mikael Renberg also scored, and Ed Belfour stopped 35 shots for
Toronto, which scored three second-period goals in less than three
minutes to overcome a 1-0 deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 5, Atlanta 1 -- Tony Amonte had a goal and an assist at
Atlanta as the Coyotes used two quick strikes to end a three-game
losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Amonte and Mike Johnson scored 50 seconds apart early in the
second, and Landon Wilson and Daniel Briere had goals in a 32-second
span late in the period.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 4, Colorado 2 -- Mike Modano earned his 1,000th career
point, and Niko Kapanen scored a shorthanded goal with 3:29 left,
carrying the Stars to victory at Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado goalie Patrick Roy became the NHL career leader in
minutes played, but he couldn't prevent the Avalanche from losing in
regulation on the road for the first time this season. Roy broke the
mark held by Terry Sawchuk.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 2, Chicago 2 -- Chris Simon's power-play goal with 1:26
left in the third period lifted the Blackhawks into a tie at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Housley also scored for the Blackhawks, who outshot the
Capitals, 38-16. Jocelyn Thibault made 14 saves as the Blackhawks
extended their unbeaten streak to five games (3-0-2).</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 5, Montreal 1 -- Jamie Langenbrunner scored two goals
for the second straight game to lead the Devils at East Rutherford,
N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Gionta, Sergei Brylin and Patrik Elias also scored for the
Devils, and Martin Brodeur made 20 saves to improve his record to
10-4.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 4, San Jose 2 -- Dave Andreychuk set an NHL record by
scoring his 250th career power-play goal as the Lightning won at
Tampa, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Andreychuk was tied for the record with Phil Esposito, a radio
broadcaster for the Lightning.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton 5, St. Louis 0 -- Anson Carter and Marty Reasoner each
scored twice and Tommy Salo made 29 saves for his first shutout of
the season as the Oilers won at Edmonton, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Comrie had a goal and two assists, and Ryan Smyth had three
assists for the Oilers, who played their first game at home after a
3-3 road trip.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Under-20 Team Beats El Salvador</HD>
<DH>Soccer/ DAILY REPORT</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Under-20 national team qualified for the FIFA World Youth
Championship in the United Arab Emirates in March by defeating El
Salvador, 1-0, on Friday at Charleston, S.C.</LD>
<LD>   The only goal of the game came in the 85th minute when a corner
kick by D.C. United winger Bobby Convey was inadvertently headed into
his own net by Salvadoran defender Alexander Escobar.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. played all but the first 19 minutes a man down after D.C.
United forward Santino Quaranta was red-carded by Mexican referee
Armando Archundia for kicking Escobar from behind. Thomas Rongen, the
U.S. coach, was ejected in the 87th minute, apparently for dissent.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier, Canada and Haiti played to a 1-1 tie. The Canadians can
join the U.S. in the March 25-April 16 world championship if they
defeat or tie the U.S. on Sunday or if El Salvador beats or ties
Haiti that same day.</TE>
<TE>   Friedel Surgery</TE>
<TE>   U.S. national team goalkeeper Brad Friedel will have surgery next
week to remove damaged cartilage from his left knee and is expected
to be sidelined for at least two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, he will miss just a couple of games," said Graeme
Souness, Friedel's coach at Blackburn Rovers of the English Premier
League.</TE>
<TE>   McDermott Quits</TE>
<TE>   Marcia McDermott, who coached the Carolina Courage to the
championship of the Women's United Soccer Assn. this season and was
WUSA's only female coach during the league's first two seasons,
resigned to pursue other interests.</TE>
<TE>   Under McDermott, the Courage finished in last place in the
eight-team league in 2001 but rebounded to win the title a year
later. Her overall record was 20-17-7.</TE>
<TE>   Champions League</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Real Madrid of Spain was given an interesting
challenge when the draw was held to put the final 16 teams in the
European Champions League into four groups of four for second-round
play.</TE>
<TE>   Real Madrid, a nine-time European champion, will face AC Milan,
the second-most successful team in the competition's history and one
of this season's favorites, German champion Borussia Dortmund and
Russian longshot Lokomotiv Moscow in the home-and-home, round-robin
series that begins Nov. 26 and lasts until March 19.</TE>
<TE>   The full draw:</TE>
<TE>   Group A: Inter Milan (Italy), Bayer Leverkusen (Germany),
Barcelona (Spain) and Newcastle United (England).</TE>
<TE>   Group B: Ajax Amsterdam (Netherlands), AS Roma (Italy), Arsenal
(England) and Valencia (Spain).</TE>
<TE>   Group C: Borussia Dortmund (Germany), AC Milan (Italy), Real
Madrid (Spain) and Lokomotiv Moscow (Russia).</TE>
<TE>   Group D: Juventus (Italy), Basel (Switzerland), Manchester United
(England) and Deportivo La Coruna (Spain).</TE>
<TE>   Earthquake Theft</TE>
<TE>   Three masked and armed robbers stole $60,000 in cash and 3,000
tickets worth $30,000 from a stadium box office in Pescara, Italy,
late Thursday, escaping with funds that had been raised through
soccer to help the victims of last month's earthquake in the region
that killed 29 people, including 26 children.</TE>
<TE>   The Italian soccer federation condemned the crime, calling it "a
shameful act against solidarity in sport." Italy's national team is
scheduled to play Turkey at the stadium Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Sacks Are His Bag</HD>
<DH>Arizona State's Suggs has a shot at NCAA unofficial record
and Trojans' Palmer is the next obstacle standing in his way.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arizona State defensive end Terrell Suggs leads the nation in sacks.
Also, apparently, in horsepower and fuel consumption.</LD>
<LD>   "He plays with a very big motor," USC Coach Pete Carroll said.</LD>
<LD>   Said Arizona State Coach Dirk Koetter, "He's got a great motor
that never stops running."</LD>
<TE>   Relentlessly rushing passers in overdrive, Suggs is a sack
machine. The 6-foot-3, 252-pound junior has recorded an NCAA-record
19 1/2 of them this season. But because the NCAA did not recognize
sacks as an official statistic until 2000, Suggs is still chasing the
unofficial record of 24 1/2 set by Pittsburgh's Zeke Gadson in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   USC will try to stymie Suggs' pursuit of the mark -- and
quarterback Carson Palmer -- when the eighth-ranked Trojans play
Arizona State in a Pacific 10 Conference game today at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   "The faster you go, the more the other team is going to have to do
to stop you," Suggs said. "I want to be like the LaVar Arringtons and
the Julius Peppers. Even if they don't have a good game
statistically, people watch them in the stadium or at home on TV and
say, 'That guy never takes a play off.' "</TE>
<TE>   Suggs presents USC tackles Jacob Rogers and Winston Justice with
their biggest challenge of the season. The Trojans have given up only
18 sacks, the second-lowest total in the conference.</TE>
<TE>   "He uses his speed to get up the field and beats guys around the
corner," said Rogers, a 6-6, 305-pound junior. "He catches people
jumping out, and then he goes inside. He does a good job of taking
advantage of what you give him."</TE>
<TE>   Justice worked overtime this week preparing for Suggs, also known
as T-Rex. Justice, a 6-6, 305-pound freshman, studied film and
corralled defensive end Kenechi Udeze after practice for extra reps.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'll do well and can make a little name for myself by
keeping him out of the backfield," Justice said. "That's my goal for
the week."</TE>
<TE>   Suggs arrived at Arizona State in 2000 hoping to start plays in
the backfield rather than finishing them there. He'd rushed for more
than 2,200 yards and had scored 26 touchdowns as a senior running
back at Hamilton High in Chandler, Ariz., but was buried on the depth
chart in Tempe.</TE>
<TE>   Suggs switched to defensive end and made an immediate impact,
recording 10 sacks as a freshman. Last year, he made 18 tackles for
losses, including 10 more sacks.</TE>
<TE>   Suggs has four or more sacks in a game twice this season,
including a career-best 4 1/2 against Washington on Oct. 19. He leads
the conference with 26 tackles for losses, two shy of the Pac-10
record set by Ron George of Stanford in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how fast he is, but it's too fast," Carroll said.
"You can double him and chip him and do all the tricks and he keeps
coming."</TE>
<TE>   Suggs sacked Palmer twice last season while making a season-best
five tackles for losses, but USC won, 48-17, ending a four-game
losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer has vaulted into consideration for the Heisman Trophy by
passing for 1,113 yards and 13 touchdowns in the last three games. He
said he couldn't worry solely about Suggs when facing the Pac-10's
fifth-best defense.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a great player, but as a defensive lineman he can't take
over the game like [USC safety] Troy Polamalu can," Palmer said.
"I'll make sure I know where he is and make sure we're doing the
right stuff to take care of him, but he's not in my mind-set going
into every play. I'm not going out of my way to change my game for
him."</TE>
<TE>   Suggs said there would be no bull's-eye on Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   "I get more hyped by how good the teams are, not the individual
players," Suggs said. "This USC team is great and there is not a
better place than the Coliseum for college football.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great stage to show what you can do."</TE>

<KH>No.8 USC VS. ARIZONA STATE Today at the Coliseum, 4 p.m., TBS</KH>
<HD>Clarity Now Begins at Home</HD>
<DH>Trojans getting an edge from the Coliseum, and they want to
keep it going against Sun Devils.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The crowds that fill more than half of the cavernous Coliseum will
never be mistaken for the rowdy throngs at Oregon's Autzen Stadium,
Washington State's Martin Stadium or Washington's Husky Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   But USC's historic home is currently one of the toughest places in
the Pacific 10 Conference for opposing teams to win.</LD>
<LD>   Eighth-ranked USC takes a seven-game home winning streak into
today's homecoming game against Arizona State. It is the Trojans'
longest home streak since they won 10 consecutive games during the
1987-88 seasons. Six of the seven victories were against Pac-10
opponents.</LD>
<TE>   "It's such an important element of your program to control," Coach
Pete Carroll said of the dominance at home. "You can talk about it,
sell it and take pride in it. Having a little string going is huge
and you build on that.</TE>
<TE>   "The players are jacked about doing something here and keeping it
going."</TE>
<TE>   The winning streak started last season with a 48-17 victory over
Arizona State on Oct. 13. The Trojans finished the season by winning
four of their last five regular-season games, including home
victories over Oregon State and UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   USC, 7-2 overall and 5-1 in Pac-10 play, opened this season with a
nonconference victory over Auburn at the Coliseum. The Trojans also
defeated Oregon State, California and Washington at home.</TE>
<TE>   USC has drawn an average of 58,940 in the 92,000-seat stadium this
season. More than 65,000 are expected today and the Notre Dame game
on Nov. 30 is already sold out.</TE>
<TE>   "Other teams come in thinking it's not going to be loud, but
sometimes it gets going in there on the big third downs and the crowd
gets into it," senior offensive lineman Zach Wilson said. "If we keep
playing as well as we have been and keep this home streak going, no
one is going to want to face USC at the Coliseum."</TE>
<TE>   Today's game is USC's first at home since Oct. 19, when the
Trojans defeated Washington, 41-21, the first of three consecutive
games in which they scored more than 40 points.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Carson Palmer played his way into Heisman Trophy
consideration during the stretch as USC stayed on track for a
possible berth in the Rose Bowl or other bowl championship series
game.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer completed 22 of 32 passes for 317 yards and four touchdowns
in a 49-17 victory over Stanford last week and became the school
record-holder for career touchdown passes with 62.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State (7-4, 4-2 in Pac-10), led by sophomore quarterback
Andrew Walter and junior defensive end Terrell Suggs, won its first
four conference games before giving up a combined 99 points in
consecutive losses to Washington State and California.</TE>
<TE>   Walter has passed for more than 400 yards four times this season.
He threw for a conference-record 536 yards in a 45-42 victory over
Oregon on Oct. 19, and 477 yards in a 55-38 loss to Cal last week.</TE>
<TE>   Walter established a school single-season record of 2,992 passing
yards, breaking the mark of 2,878 yards set by Danny White in 1973.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd compare him to what Drew Bledsoe probably looked like as a
young kid," Carroll said. "Just a fantastic natural arm. They know
what they've got and they're going with it."</TE>
<TE>   Suggs leads the nation with an NCAA-record 19.5 sacks.</TE>
<TE>   With games against UCLA and Notre Dame coming up, Palmer said the
Trojans cannot look past the Sun Devils.</TE>
<TE>   "If they win this game and the next, there is a shot they could go
to a better bowl than we can," Palmer said. "They've got some good
players and they play well together, so it's not a pushover game."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said the Trojans are counting on a spirited homecoming
crowd to help them extend their winning streak at the Coliseum and
continue one of the most promising seasons in years.</TE>
<TE>   "Fans are up and they are getting after teams when they're coming
in and out of the tunnel," Carroll said. "I'm hoping that continues
to be a factor for us."</TE>

<LD>ARIZONA ST. (7-4, 4-2)</LD>
<LD>   vs. No. 8 USC (7-2, 5-1)</LD>
<LD>   Today, 4 p.m., at the Coliseum</LD>
<TE>   TV -- TBS.</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KMPC (1540).</TE>
<TE>   WHEN USC HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Carson Palmer is at the controls of an offense that
averages 33 points a game and has scored 40 or more in the last three
games. Palmer passed for 1,113 yards and 13 touchdowns with only two
interceptions in the victories over Washington, Oregon and Stanford.
Freshman wide receiver Mike Williams will play, despite a sore left
ankle, and senior Kareem Kelly appears to be back at full speed.
Justin Fargas got only nine carries against Stanford, but he will
start again at tailback. Eric Torres will start in place of Lenny
Vandermade at left guard. Tackles Winston Justice and Jacob Rogers
will try to control Sun Devil defensive end Terrell Suggs, who leads
the nation with 19.5 sacks.</TE>
<TE>   WHEN ARIZONA STATE HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   Sun Devil quarterback Andrew Walter passed for 477 yards last week
against California, his fourth 400-yard game of the season. Receiver
Shaun McDonald ranks third in the Pac-10 with 71 receptions for a
school-record 1,207 yards and is averaging 17 yards a catch. The Sun
Devils rushed for only 166 yards in their last five games. Cornell
Canidate, who has gained a team-best 493 yards, is injured and will
be replaced by junior Mike Williams. USC safety Troy Polamalu is
still nursing a high right ankle sprain but made a team-best 13
tackles last week against Stanford. The Trojans rank first in the
Pac-10 in pass defense, surrendering only 200.2 yards a game. Marcell
Allmond and Darrell Rideaux will start at cornerback, but freshman
Justin Wyatt also will play.</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO USC VICTORY</TE>
<TE>   1. Prevent the big play. As often as Arizona State throws the
ball, quarterback Andrew Walter is certain to accumulate yardage. But
if the Trojans limit Walter to short completions, they will wear down
the Sun Devils.</TE>
<TE>   2. Contain Terrell Suggs. Arizona State's defensive end loves the
big stage and is capable of disrupting the Trojan offense. The
offensive line must keep the national sack leader away from
quarterback Carson Palmer to avoid tackles for losses, or worse.</TE>
<TE>   3. Avoid looking ahead. With UCLA and Notre Dame up next, the
Trojans must focus on the Sun Devils. Turnovers, penalties and other
costly mistakes could start USC on a season-ending slide.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC tight end Alex Holmes does not recall all the specifics of the
play, but he remembers the aftermath.</LD>
<LD>   Last year against Arizona State, Holmes scored the first touchdown
of his Trojan career when he caught a four-yard pass from Carson
Palmer in the third quarter of USC's 48-17 victory.</LD>
<LD>   "I stood up and kind of lost it, putting my hands in the air,"
said Holmes, a 6-foot-3, 265-pound junior. "Everyone made fun of me,
but I was waiting for it for a while. It was pretty exciting."</LD>
<TE>   After a slow start this season, Holmes is providing the Trojan
receiving corps with a valuable weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Wide receivers Mike Williams and Kareem Kelly and flanker Keary
Colbert are spreading defenses, allowing Holmes to get open over the
middle.</TE>
<TE>   Last week against Stanford, Holmes caught three passes for 57
yards and scored his first touchdown of the season by bulling through
a defender to complete a 22-yard play.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time I get the opportunity to get some momentum going, it
makes it more difficult to tackle me," said Holmes, who has 17
receptions for 199 yards. "I just want to keep getting open and give
Carson another option."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shaun McDonald, Arizona State's 5-9, 172-pound junior wide
receiver, leads the Pacific 10 Conference with 109.7 receiving yards
per game and is second in receptions (71).</TE>
<TE>   McDonald has 2,669 career receiving yards and needs 324 to pass
John Jefferson as the Sun Devils' all-time leader.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be a change for us because we've become
accustomed to playing against bigger receivers in the Pac-10," USC
cornerback Darrell Rideaux said. "It's going to be a track meet."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State, celebrating its 25th year as a member of the
Pac-10, is the only conference member that does not have a losing
record against USC.</TE>
<TE>   USC and the Sun Devils are tied in their all-time series, 9-9.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State has not defeated the Trojans at the Coliseum since
1996.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC's seven-game winning streak at the Coliseum is still a long
way off from the school record for consecutive victories at home. The
Trojans won 20 consecutive home games in 1919-23 and 1927-29.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC safety Jason Leach is the cousin of Arizona State safety
Alfred Williams.... USC is 50-24-4 in homecoming games since 1924.</TE>

<LD>As first games go, USC's opener was neither memorable nor historic,
save for the fact the Trojans were playing in their first Women's
Preseason NIT.</LD>
<LD>   But the Trojans won't throw back the results -- a 63-55
first-round victory Friday over Northern Arizona, before 1,107 at the
Sports Arena.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans next travel to Fort Collins, Colo., to play No. 19
Colorado State on Sunday in the quarterfinals. Colorado State
defeated San Francisco, 76-58, Friday.</LD>
<TE>   USC forward Rachel Woodward led all scorers with 15 points. Ebony
Hoffman added 14 points and a career-high 18 rebounds. Also key were
13 points from Jessica Cheeks, who has shifted to shooting guard
after struggling at times last season as the point.</TE>
<TE>   "That's my normal spot," said Cheeks, who made six of 13 shots and
grabbed five rebounds. "The point is more structured. You have to
call plays, make sure people are in the right spot, set up other
people to get the ball. This year I'm trying to score, but still get
other people involved."</TE>
<TE>   Lacey Tolbert led Northern Arizona (0-1) with 14 points.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's game was the first meeting between the schools as well as
the first time Northern Arizona Coach Meg Sanders had competed
against USC's Chris Gobrecht as a peer. Sanders played for Gobrecht
at Cal State Fullerton in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   For 13 minutes the Lumberjacks played the Trojans even, 18-18.
Then USC used a 14-2 run in the final seven minutes to take a 32-20
halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   Northern Arizona hung around in the second half from long
distance. All six of its three-point field goals (in 12 attempts)
came in the final 20 minutes. Missing 10 of 24 free throws, USC
couldn't pull away. Yet the closest Northern Arizona came was 57-50
with 1:27 left to play.</TE>
<TE>   "They played well and were very scrappy," Gobrecht said of
Northern Arizona. "We won the game at the end of the first half. But
we have better people than we showed tonight. And we know this."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In first-round games of the Women's Preseason NIT, Kendra Wecker
had 20 points and 12 rebounds to help No. 5 Kansas State defeat Ball
State, 71-61, at Manhattan, Kan.... Tanisha Wright scored eight of
her 19 points during a key second-half run as No. 14 Penn State beat
Bucknell, 86-72, at State College, Pa.... LaToya Thomas scored 26
points and Tan White had 23 as No. 24 Mississippi State defeated
South Alabama, 87-61, at Starkville, Miss.</TE>
